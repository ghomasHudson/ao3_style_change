The Stark Tower was among one of the biggest in New York City. The bright and large letters at the top of the tower always lit up the night sky, while keeping up an impressive display during the day. Steve hardly found it difficult to locate the building. It was relatively new, but he knew the streets of his home fairly well. It wasn’t hard to track down the right address once Steve knew the streets around the building.
,” to himself over and over while he struggled to breathe properly. This wasn’t what he had wanted to happen. Tony wanted the baby so badly, but he physically wasn’t able to take care of himself enough to save that precious baby. Tony had been helpless, and that fact alone was enough to get him crying as he suffered through the worst physical and emotional pain he had ever endured. This was like losing Steve a second time, a second time that Tony couldn’t help what outcome came of it.
Tony was so caught up in charging forward and looking ahead of him that he didn’t expect a hand to reach out and grab his neck as he ran past some barrels. He let out a choked scream as he was pulled back and lifted into the air, the hand around his neck tightening and closing off a bit of his airway. He flailed against who had snatched him up far too easily, and he knew the scent of the brute was that of an alpha, a starved one at that. The alpha’s grip was far too tight for Tony to break free from, and that scared him perhaps even more than those guns did.
"So did Howard Stark. The two of them worked hard to get us where we are today. We owe a lot to them."
“What? A map? Coordinates?” Steve stepped closer to Bucky, looking over the papers that had been recovered.
“Then understand it somewhere else,” the colonel snapped back. “If I read the posters correctly, you got someplace to be in thirty minutes.”
“Mm, but do you like getting rough or are you one of those ‘gentle lover’ types? You like the dirty talk, or the soft praises? I need to know if I should get into an innocent omega act or if I should play up my kinky knot-hungry side.”
“I’m sure you are. Unfortunately we just got here, and I’m guessing you’re expected to be here a bit longer.”
“I’ve never been serious about an alpha before, and I’m seriously considering you, so,” Tony turned around completely to wrap his arms over Steve’s shoulders and looked into his blue eyes, “Is there anything special you’d like an omega to do for you? Other than sit prettilly on your knot, of course.”
“I’m sure he missed you just as much as you missed him,” Bucky spoke up, poking his head into Tony’s field of vision.
With another wave of the scent of slick hitting his nose, Steve groaned again, pulling away from the kiss and moving lower to lick up the fresh slick. He hoisted Tony’s legs over his shoulders and closed his eyes, tasting the omega’s sweet slick.
“At least my family’s company would be, I’m sure. But they wouldn’t be interested in the fact I built a fully functional robot that could clean my room for me when I was five using spare parts I stole from my dad's home work space and the easy bake oven my parents got me for christmas. No one wants tech made by an omega. Dad made sure to pound that in my head. Literally.”
“You did scare me pretty good,” the omega said as he took Steve’s hand and let himself be helped out of the car. “You owe me more than just opening a car door for me and helping me out.”
Entering the room, Maria made a beeline for the bathroom Tony had in his room, sighing when she saw him hunched over the toilet. She waited until he had a break from heaving, then she knocked on the door frame, getting on her knees next to her son.
“Some, yes, but I made sure to add some chocolate chip ones for you.” Maria moved back to the stove to flip the pancakes. “I added some cinnamon ones for Steve as well.”
“Some of these men need medical attention.” Another pause. “I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.”
A big smile filled Steve’s face as he let himself be led by Tony, his heartbeat maybe speeding up just a little bit. “You seem eager to dance,” he said once the two of them were on the dance floor and moving to the music.
Reaching the forty-fifth floor, the blond stepped out of the elevator and took in his new surroundings.
Somehow Tony stayed awake through the whole plane ride, though he remained feeling numb. His eyes stared out the window, emotionless, red, and dried up. How his heart ached for Steve to come back with that bright smile on his face and his blond hair just slightly out of its normal style. Tony would have given anything to bring Steve back, but there was nothing he could give. Tony was alone without his alpha once more, and he hadn’t realized until that moment just how much he had changed in the time he had known Steve.
“Privilege of being born to rich parents, I guess, but I’m not trying to intimidate you, I want to be adorable to you.”
Steve knew where he had heard those words before. In 1941. A baseball game he had attended as a fan. He had been at that game.
The new guy was another omega with dark curly hair, though he seemed more reserved than Tony was. He also was wearing glasses that he pushed up his nose as he looked at Steve. “Who’s the new guy?”
When Tony took off his arc reactor, the pain in his chest suddenly increased, and he gasped before he powered through the pain, tossing the reactor onto the floor and out of his reach before taking off his top. He grimaced through the pain, the top of the uniform sticking to his skin as he peeled it off. It was then that he saw how bad his injuries were.
Tony whined, clearly not wanting to worry about his clothes getting ruined by slick or cum. “I think you should just keep your mouth shut for now.”
As soon as the man was down, Tony ran towards the flaming body, curious about the technology he had used, but his attention was changed immediately when he caught a whiff of Steve’s scent, and then Steve was right in front of him, looking a bit shaken but still pushing forward. Tony nearly collapsed when he whined and dropped his gun to hug his alpha tight. He let his guard down as Steve hugged him back and kissed the top of his head.
“You know that’s not what I meant,” Howard said sternly. “You’re not doing much to help around here.”
The alpha looked down at the paint and sighed. “Sorry, I thought this shirt was clean when I changed into it before coming here.”
“We don’t know that until we try it out.” Not waiting for an answer, Tony rushed out from behind the trees and tore away the cloth that covered the reactor. Holding his gun in one hand, he sprinted forward, twisting the casing of the reactor so the shielding mechanism would turn on. Once he turned it, he started shooting at the Hydra agents, taking cover behind trees as he slowly made his way back to the gates of the base.
“Sorry, I just don’t want your dad to get suspicious. He already isn’t exactly fond of the fact that we’re dating.” Steve brushed back some of Tony’s hair and sighed.
Tony smiled and closed his eyes, “I’m going to nap. I don’t mind if you carry me back to the bed once the water starts getting cold.” he muttered.
“There’s not enough time,” Steve replied. “This thing’s moving too fast, and it’s heading for New York.”
Hello guys! So first I want to start off by thanking you guys for reading. I'm glad this fic has been received very well! Second, I would like to announce that I will be taking a break from posting for a couple weeks, since these next two weeks are dead week and finals week for me in school, so I thought it best that I focus on that until the semester is over. Thank you guys so much, enjoy some more smutty scenes in this chapter, and I'll have another update for you guys in a couple weeks!
“If I were to take a guess, I’d say it was because they had just lost their friend. Tony was excited to tell Steve about their little one, I don’t think he’d want the news to come right along with mourning a friend. Life and death are hard to take together. The baby would take away from needed mourning and the mourning would take away from the joy.”
Tony was always watching Steve when he was home, or in London rather. It was beginning to feel like home the longer they stayed. The omega wanted it to feel like home too. He wanted Steve to be home more often, but knowing the supersoldier was one of the world’s best defenders during the war, he understood that Steve was not always going to have the time to be home. London always felt lonely when Steve wasn’t there, despite the millions of people living there. Tony also felt like he was useless while sitting at the base or at the apartment, just watching clips sent back from the missions or looking at photographs they had taken while in their spare time. He wanted to do something, be useful, or at least be sent home so he could help his mother out at the real home.
Tony’s face turned bright red, “If I end up working for your Hydra people, I’ll be in the lab all the time outsmarting the alpha scientists, so obviously I’d occasionally see you to outsmart you, too.” he excused. “I’ve done enough secret hacking to know that alpha scientists can be rather stupid.”
Steve said nothing else as he and Tony continued to cuddle through the movie JARVIS had chosen for them. Occasionally one of them would move to grab a snack, but for the most part the two just remained in a cuddling position, so only enjoying being together at home rather than at the gala where paparazzi and exes lurked about. Here at home it was better, warmer, happier. And to Steve, perhaps home didn't just mean the place he lived anymore. Home was Tony curled up with him on the couch watching a movie and simply enjoying each other's presence.
Silence filled the room, Tony looking down at his bed in contemplation and bewilderment. Maria was about to speak up again when Tony’s eyes widened and he took in a deep breath.
Steve looked at the ground as the announcer on the radio got excited. He knew the next play like it was the back of his hand.
Still, Maria insisted she needed to come help and Tony knew he couldn’t say no to her, not when there were pictures of him and Steve to show her. Thankfully he had left his uniform back in London with Steve, because Maria would have had a fit about that. Her reaction probably would have been similar to Howard’s… though maybe not as dramatic. Still, that was a secret Tony was going to keep from his mother at least for a little while, unless Howard had sent his wife a letter saying how bad their son was being. Either way, Maria would probably find out eventually.
“Of course we are,” Howard said with a smile, petting Tony’s hair. “We want what’s best for you, and we both agree that this plan you have is for the best.”
Being curled up helped none, so Tony sat up and groaned louder, then he cried out at a sharper pain. He started hyperventilating as the pain only seemed to grow worse, and a wetness seemed to build up around his waist. There was no way this could have been one of those heats omegas could experience after losing their alpha early in life, or even just a random heat during pregnancy. Nothing related to heats could really hurt that bad, not as bad as Tony hurt. He thought he was done with pain, he thought he was doing good, but of course how cold he see just how bad a condition he was in when he was constantly bombarded by his fear and anxiety? How could he see what he was doing to his own body?
“Oh my god, Steve…” Tony was wailing as he clung to his alpha, finally being freed from the sickness he had suffered through for years. “You’re alive, I knew you were alive!”
Tony looked up at him, unshed tears very clearly gathering in the corners of his eyes. The poor omega was flooded with emotions and he couldn’t bring himself to let them out properly.
“There are a lot more cameras here than what I saw in the car,” Steve said, smiling as Tony guided him through the crowd.
Steve let out a quick sigh of relief. "Sorry, I don't think I've ever had an omega be so forward with me like that before."
When Tony and Peggy arrived at the bar, they were greeted with a multitude of alphas acting polite and complimenting them as they walked inside. It was a bit annoying, but at least they knew Steve was inside, and if any alpha tried anything, they would soon have a big blond captain to deal with.
“I saw things out there, Tony,” Steve said quietly after a bit. “Not necessarily things that were scarring, but… things I don’t want to see again, but I know I have to.”
Tony shivered a little, knowing exactly what type of gaze his mother was talking about. “Yeah, but we better not go too deep into that topic because I may need to kick you out.”
"I know all of this is sudden, but you have a place here," Fury reassured Steve. "You'll belong with us soon enough. Just hang in there."
Tony choked back more tears as he listened to Steve’s words. They were all true, and no matter what Howard had ever said to Tony, none of it mattered. Tony was special, and Steve could see that. Steve wanted to protect what was special about Tony, even if it meant yelling in Howard’s face and telling the beta just how much Tony meant to the alpha. The mental image of Steve telling Howard to fuck off made Tony feel warm inside, and he decided right then that he wanted to stay with Steve the rest of his life.
Tony didn’t have to wait long for that to happen, because Steve was covering him with his body and grabbing his cock to stroke it and push him closer to the edge. Tony gasped and whimpered, eyebrows turned up almost as far as they could go as Steve jerked him off while also still thrusting into him. It was almost too much stimulation. The stars he was seeing before got more intense, and his breath kept hitching on his moans and cries. Tony was in no way able to form coherent words for Steve to hear. He was far past that point as he was pushed closer and closer to his climax. He could feel his stomach tighten up, and it would only take a few more strokes…
this morning he was shoving his face in my ass and licking up my slick like I was the fountian of fucking youth or something.”
"Captain," the alpha agent said, saluting Steve with an arm made entirely out of metal and donning a red star. "I heard rumors you were bringing back some guests. Turns out they were true."
Being satisfied with his performance, Steve sat back finally and wiped his face off, not bothering to wipe his hands on the sheets before he was grabbing Tony’s hips and pulling them up more. He settled his cock between the omega’s ass cheeks and thrusted a couple times to coat himself in Tony’s slick. He was pleased with all the noises his omega was making, so he growled back as a response, and then finally he pressed the tip of his cock against Tony’s waiting hole.
Tony shook his head. “Nothing. He’s not even responding to my ring. When I tap it, it sends a little vibration to a matching ring Steve has,” he explained when Peggy looked confused. “I made them…”
“We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass,” the older man replied, taking a stack of papers from a blonde female agent. “What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map. You think you can wipe Hydra off it?”
"Wonder why…" Bucky glanced back at the two, who had started a makeout session just outside the elevator. He sighed and turned back to Clint. "I can show you your room while those two are busy. I don’t think they’ll want to do anything else but each other for a while.”
Maria, who was at the stove making the pancakes, turned quickly with wide eyes. A smile quickly graced her face when she noticed it was her son who had made noise. “Tony, oh I’m so glad to see you’re awake!” She hurried over to the brunet omega and pulled him into a tight hug. “I was wondering how much longer you were going to be in heat.”
Swallowing, he wiped his hand on his pants and watched as Steve stopped running, looking at the plane as it sped away from him. Tony whined, then yelped as the car screeched to a halt beside the super soldier.
“Tony, take it easy, stress isn’t healthy for you,” the doctor said, trying his best to comfort the distressed omega. “We’ll take care of everything, okay? All the tests and checkups will go as smoothly as possible, and we’ll get you some vitamins to help stabilize your hormones and strengthen you up a bit more.”
“Well then, maybe I’ll go down tomorrow to watch you work some before we go out to get some lunch on me?”
“I like a good classic burger. I’m kind of a plain Jane when it comes to being adventurous with food.”
“By the time he’s done that, it could be too late.” Steve threw on a heavier jacket and put the belt on. He grabbed his shield and bag and started to head back out.
“It’s adorable.” Tony smiled. “Don’t worry, alpha, Not like I’m going to drag you off to bed right away. I know what my reputation in the media says, but I don’t actually sleep with anything that moves. I like to have a few dates first.”
Tony rolled his eyes with a smile. “Okay, Captain. You didn’t need to bring up that old-ass alpha when you’re enough alpha for me.”
Bruce smiled, leaning into the large alpha and pressing a kiss to his jaw, “Glad you could make it.” he teased. “This is Rhodey’s new friend Steve, and uh, I guess Tony’s proclaimed him as his new boyfriend, so he’ll likely be in the group more often from now on.”
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up,” the omega said as he looked down at his almost empty plate. Suddenly he didn’t feel like eating anymore.
“So dependent on me now, are you?” Tony smirked. “Maybe I’ll stay here where it’s safe and you can send me letters again.”
“Hopefully.” Tony nodded, “Or we get the chance to bow out early and go back to one of our places—preferably mine as I have a working elevator.”
“Does this mean we should go shopping some time soon? Your birthday is in a couple months after all.”
Sighing softly, Steve pulled Tony close and hugged him tight, attempting to ease the distressed omega as best as he could without upsetting Tony. Of course the whole situation was already upsetting, but Steve did his best to make it less upsetting. Knowing that his omega was going to be shipped home as soon as his heat was over was distressing even to him.
“No to the lip gloss, but I’ll do the eyeliner.” Tony moved himself to the vanity and sat down, taking the earrings out of the box and putting them on. He turned his head from side to side and smiled. They weren’t too big or too small, and they caught every bit of light, no matter what direction his head was turned. By the time he had put the matching brooch on, Peggy had already slipped into her dress and was approaching Tony from behind.
“Well as long as you’re Tony’s alpha, you’re always welcome here, no matter what may be going on.” Maria smiled and patted Steve’s cheek gently.  “You’re family here, and I hope you consider yourself to be family.”
To say Howard was pissed was an understatement. He was fuming mad, probably the angriest Tony had ever seen him. He felt bad for not telling him, honestly, surprising him at the landing strip where he had a plane ready to fly was not the best idea. But Tony hardly cared about anything but the fact that Steve was leaving him, and he didn’t know exactly how to process that as Howard continued to yell at the alpha.
“Tony? Honey, are you alright?” Maria knocked on the door to her son’s room for the third time that day. It had been a week since Steve had left, and Tony had spent more time in his room than out of it. Maria had grown concerned for Tony, even though she knew he needed space after his alpha had left.
Tony paused, swallowing and taking shaky breaths. “I know you were there for the whole thing… but losing your daddy hurts… it hurts a lot, Little Bitsy.”
“I was healed enough that I didn’t have pain any more. But that doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you two are home again, and I don’t have to worry about random alphas trying to hit on me and take me home with them.”
“I might not have even noticed you back then. I was a little bit of a rich-boy jerk. Rhodey helped with that of course, since he was my roomie, and living together really kick-started our friendship, but yeah.”
Both Peggy and Howard were soon relieved of watching over the unconscious omega as the ambulance arrived and took Tony out on a stretcher. The medic who had been in the base offered to take both betas to the hospital to wait for Tony to be available for visitation, and he reassured them the whole trip that Tony was going to be fine, even if he himself wasn’t fully sure. But he knew a little comfort for the two would make them feel better, and he wanted them to be as stress free as possible.
Huffing, Tony sat down on one of the boxes. “Fine, but only because Steve will yell at me if I don’t.”
"You could say he died. A new Captain took his place when he woke up from the ice in a German laboratory 70 years later." Steve flicked his eyes up to Tony's, reaching forward to take the omega's top off.
“Right… Just don’t fuck up again. And give me a day or two before you try anything. That includes trying to kiss or hug me.”
“The right partner… but I suppose I can fancy a dance with a soldier for now, if only to let these two have a dance together as well.” Peggy took the arm Bucky offered her, chuckling as Tony flushed darkly. “Oh eight-hundred, Captain,” she said to Steve just before she disappeared with Bucky.
Tony didn’t want help. He wanted to die. He wanted to be with Steve again and nothing else. Tony didn’t care about getting help for his wounds or his broken heart. There was just nothing anyone could do that could help Tony.
“I absolutely promise. Maybe I’ll stay locked inside you longer because you’re such a perfect match for me.” Steve crooned with a hint of a growl, nuzzling Tony’s jawline and attempting to scent again.
“Hey.” Tony nudged Steve’s arm with his shoulder. “It’ll be okay. The war will end eventually, and you’ll have your friends back, plus… an omega to keep by your side if you’d like.”
Later that night, after Tony had eaten, drank water and settled into his nest, the omega’s body started heating up; waking up the sleeping brunet with an uncomfortable feeling of loneliness. The preheat was brutal, but Tony knew it was going to be without his alpha. At least he still had his thoughts to fantasize with, plus all his toys that his mother had so helpfully tucked away underneath his bed. Still, it was going to be a long heat without Steve around to make Tony feel better.
So the family waited and mourned the loss of yet another family member in just a few weeks. No one was as broken as Tony was, the poor omega losing his whole world so quickly after gaining it all just as quickly. Only a few years of knowing Steve had led to love, a deep bond, the promise of marriage, and a child to love in the future, but the rage of the war had snatched that all away from Tony, as if he was being punished for fighting a war he didn’t belong in. Over the few days Tony was in the hospital, that was his mentality. Everything he had done in the war that went against what society wanted from him was being punished by way of losing nearly everything he had loved. It was all his own stupid fault for getting involved with Steve in the first place. If he had just stayed home with his mother the day Steve had been injected with the serum, none of his trauma would have ever existed.
“You say sorry as if you aren’t talking to a guy who still has a grease stain on his pants from an incident earlier today.”
"I'm so sorry, Tony," Steve crooned softly. "If I had known you when you were in college, I would have tried to stop what he did to you."
“Five years of mate sickness is quite a long time, especially if you choose not to move on from your old mate,” Howard said, trying to make sense out of the situation. “I don’t want you to be sick any more than you have to, and if you’ve ran these numbers and they look good… then I’m okay with you going through with this.”
Feeling like he was getting close to reaching his limit, Tony, turned his head to the side and glanced back at Steve, letting out a long breathy moan. He could only imagine what this rut would be like once he fell into heat, because Steve was already more amazing than usual. The rut definitely intensified the moment.
“And me, though I’m disappointed if you are only here to whine like a child, Anthony.” a man said, appearing behind Steve and Tony.
“Don’t be too hard on him,” Peggy urged. “But we have a mission on our hands, and we need to get out of here quickly if we’re going to do this. You’d better get the plane ready to fly, Mr. Stark.”
Steve reacted almost violently to Tony’s orgasm, growling loudly and pushing Tony’s hips down into the sheets. His knot inflated and pulled against Tony’s entrance as he was locked inside, and then after a few more struggling thrusts, he himself came with his climax, biting down on his own lips as he groaned and filled Tony deep with his seed. There was no second thought to the action, just the feeling of love and appreciation for such a good omega.
“Hu.” Tony attached himself to Steve’s arm as they walked in side for what he was now deeming ‘the quest for the softest jammies’, since apparently there would be pajamas hidden away in a sea of—everything.
It didn’t look hopeful. Howard skidded into the locker room while breathing heavily, just in time to see Tony’s hand fall against the floor and watch his son go alarmingly still.
“That would be excellent,” Steve said as he picked up Tony and carried  him off to what was now their tent, a smile on his face the whole way until they disappeared from prying eyes.
“I’ll try. I suppose I can’t sit on your knot while you drive.” Tony teased as he climbed into the car.
Tony shuffled back over to his bed. If his stomach wasn’t upset, he’d have flopped right onto the bed and screamed as loud as he could. He just wanted his nightmare to end, and he liked to think he could just blame it all on Steve being gone, so his body was just out of wack without him around. But… being sick like he was didn’t exactly add up with Steve being gone.
Sighing, Tony looked down at the blankets balled up in his hands. He wanted to scream and cry some more, but having his father there, actually supporting him for once, made his need to cry go away just a little.
There was silence between them as Bucky finally caught up to Tony. “You’ve got a fast omega,” he commented as he caught his breath. “Now go get a room before Howard decides to confront his son.”
Steve sighed as he was left alone. Sure, he thought Tony was cute. He was small and sassy; how was that not cute? Then he thought how he never really thought about any omega like this before when he was just a beta. That serum changed a lot more about him than he originally thought. Not that it was all bad. He actually had physical and emotional changes when around omegas and alphas, which was an odd sensation he had never experienced before but rather liked.
“Well, I’d like to say these bags are for good reason. Been working nonstop to get your alpha back to you.”
“He’s gotten attached to you, and he barely knows you. Why the hell would you bring him over here when you two are nearly complete strangers?” Howard put his hands on his hips with a huff and a glare at the blond that could kill.
Those words made Steve tense up, Tony could feel it through the light coat he wore. There was a lot of alpha tension in the air that Tony really didn’t like, and this time he let out the whine he realized he had been holding in. He didn’t like how Steve was called a chorus girl, but Steve especially didn’t like it. Phillips had been supportive of the super soldier project after all, up until he decided that one super soldier wasn’t enough for his precious army. Steve had a lot of potential, he just wasn’t ever given the chance to prove so.
When the car was closer to the plane, Steve got out of his seat and planted his foot just outside the car door. He held his shield close to his body, chest heaving as his nerves keep his heart pounding. “Keep it steady,” he shouted at the colonel, preparing to duck under the blades propelling the plane.
Almost as soon as their joy of the new year ended, Steve was sent on another mission to take down a larger Hydra base located in Belgium. While he was gone, Tony approached his dad and spent many days in the lab with him. Tony had a plan brewing, one that he was sure his father wouldn’t approve of, and maybe even Steve wouldn’t approve. It was a risky plan, one that Tony planned to bring up on the date the two would be having as soon as Steve got back to London. Thankfully he didn’t have to wait too long for his alpha to return, because Steve was hurrying home with the Howling Commandos as quick as he was allowed. Tony got word mere hours after the base had been destroyed that the soldiers were already on their way home. Quick and to the point, the brunet had thought to himself that day.
Walking along the hall naked after a private session was common, so passing omegas barely glanced at him as he passed by. Finally, he reached the dorm he shared with Clint and he unlocked the door, stumbling in and grinning guiltily at Clint who was up and pulling on a pair of tight fitting pants. “Ears in yet?”
“I really wanted bread,” Tony argued. “My stomach isn’t upset right now anyways. I figured I can eat what I wanted.”
Steve smiled back as she walked away, his blue eyes then settling on Tony looking rather bored in his chair. “You look thrilled to be here.”
Tony hadn't realized up until that point just how much bigger Steve was after having the serum injected into him. Steve wasn't the little guy that Tony met on that fateful day; he was undoubtedly a super soldier, a man that honestly fit in better as an alpha than the scrawny beta he had been before. Tony groaned as he continued to look over the alpha's body, noting the differences the serum had brought on. Hell, Tony even dared to glance down at Steve's groin, promptly whining again and bringing his hands up to grasp Steve's biceps. Good lord, he had no idea how this was going to work.
When the party was finally over, Tony retreated back to his room as soon as he could get away. He didn’t want to say goodbye to all the old, rich alphas and their omegas. Something about seeing those omegas being forced to obey their mates made Tony feel sick to his stomach. It made him hope for better omegan rights in his lifetime, if he was lucky.
Steve pulled the omega’s legs apart just enough for him to slip through and crawl the rest of the way onto the cot. He braced himself with his hands over Tony, and the brunet gently squeezed his legs against Steve’s torso.
!” Tony gasped. This was new. Alphas had demanded he go down on them before, but never once had one gone down on him, and here was this new alpha, willingly and eagerly shoving his face between his ass cheeks, not just licking up slick, but also getting it all over his face—which
“I know…” Tony shook his head, looking up at his friend with wide eyes, eyebrows turned upwards. “I… I need to talk to you when we get back to London. Alone. It’s… it’s something that’s honestly scaring me a bit, and I need to tell someone.”
After the war, Tony, never went back to his old self, and he struggled for so long just to find the motivation to get out of bed every morning and seize the day.
Tony looked up, tears glittering in his eyes, though they didn’t fall. “Dad took my pills. He dumped them down the drain, and he’s sending me back home after my heat is over.”
Steve crooned happily at being called alpha, holding Tony closer while they waited for his knot to release. About an hour passed before finally he was able to slip out of the omega and peel off the condom, tossing it in the trash before grabbing a towel and some water. He was aware of Tony watching him as he dumped the water on the towel, then moved back over to the cot and spread the omega’s legs to clean him up.
“I think they’ll be more than willing to join the fight again,” Steve countered. “They’ve been through hell but they’re still soldiers. They’d defend their home to their dying breath if they could.”
“If you’re finished, my father would like to see you,” Tony spat bitterly, crumpling up the designs for Steve’s new suit in his hand.
“Well, I may not be able to help you much during your heat, but I can offer to help make your day better.”
But finally, they made it inside and Tony took a moment to pause and look Steve over again, “Still surviving?”
“And you’re feeling well enough to eat sandwiches? I would have thought you’d want the soup I made for you.”
“You can’t leave me,” Tony whispered, closing his eyes and crying silently. “Not after you kissed me…”
Tony nodded and hooked his arm around the one that his alpha offered, leaving the apartment while briefly saying goodbye to Howard. When the door closed behind him, he popped up on his toes and kissed Steve’s cheek. “I’m glad we finally got to go on this date.”
“But you might also attract a bunch of dogs.” Tony chuckled, “I hear dogs like to play with sticks.”
“That’s not what this is about, I promise. But I wanted to tell you… some alphas only get ruts once or twice a year, and I had one back in February, right after you left. That…” Steve paused, clearing his throat. “Well, I mean I don’t want to compare it to your heats, because I know spending those alone are miserable.”
When the two omegas arrived at Steve's parked car, the alpha was already standing there, a leather jacket over his blue button up and a pair of sunglasses protecting his eyes from the morning sun. He turned to look at Clint and Tony, unlocking his car and opening the trunk. "Put your things back here. It's a bit of a drive to Hydra, so make yourselves comfortable."
When Tony had finally gotten around and hurried down the stairs, he saw Steve standing at the front door talking to a man dressed in an army uniform. Tony’s blood froze in his veins as he picked up on bits of the conversation.
Tony and Steve had dressed up quite nicely to attend the party, despite Tony opposing his mother’s nagging to attend. Truth be told, he really had just wanted to spend time with Steve alone in his room. Steve had dressed in his army service uniform, and he wasn’t the only one. There were some veterans attending the party, as well as other currently active servicemen who happened to be on leave along with Steve. Tony, who was practically clinging to Steve’s side, was dressed in a more flashy top that had a tail that ran nearly the whole length of his legs, along with a simple pair of tighter fitting slacks. To say that the alpha and omega couple stole the show was an understatement. Several of the guests, mainly the servicemen, wanted a chance to talk to Steve and playfully flirt with Tony. That, however, was quickly shut down by the omega as soon as one of the alphas winked at him and hinted at some very obscene things right in front of Steve.
Howard finally got to pull away from the meeting he was dragged into after the base had mostly cleared out. Not once had he seen Tony when he had the chance to glance up, and he hoped that his son had been able to return, despite losing Steve. Howard had to remind himself that he had to be gentle with his son, because otherwise, he might lose all contact with Tony due to the actions of his past.
Maria nodded in understanding. “Meet me in the garage when you’re ready. It’s just going to be you and me today.”
Steve furrowed his eyebrows together before he finally opened his eyes and looked around from the laying position he was in.
“Yessss alphaaaa.” the omega whined. It was torture, and most omegas hated it when a knot deep inside them shifted and tugged at their overly stretched holes, but Tony loved it, and truthfully, it wouldn’t take much to make him cum again and again, even if it was a dry climax.
The Stark Manor in Malibu soon came to view as Jarvis continued to drive through the cold rain. Tony felt his heart beat quicker, an old reaction that occurred naturally, because he had never really liked returning home, especially if his father was there. He knew Howard wasn’t home, but his mother was, and she hadn’t seen her son since he started going on tour with Captain America. Maria was surely ready to give Tony the biggest hug ever, though Tony would have to tell her to go easy. He had, after all, injured his rib once more.
Tony’s eyes snapped wide open, then closed again with a louder moan. More slick ran out of his body, coating Steve’s stomach in it. The scent of omega in heat intensified the more slick was spread out over the alpha’s body, which as a result only made Steve more eager to fuck Tony.
Steve flushed a little. “I… I do care about your health. I want to see you happy and healthy, of course.”
A head of blond hair whipped around, blue eyes wide and a low whine escaping from the alpha’s throat. Alpha and omega were aware of each other, but neither of them knew where each other were, and it began to distress the both of them a little. Thankfully, the stress didn’t last long, because Steve soon spotted Tony through the crowd of people and called out to him, causing those around the alpha to move away and make a path.
“Steve, is that you?! Are you alright?” Tony pushed the commando out of the chair and sat down with wide eyes, Peggy grabbing the chair behind him.
Tony looked a little disappointed, but he knew Steve was going to be working on actual military stuff after saving all those soldiers in Italy. "Then I'll be hoping for no dire situations to come up."
“Yes, it reminds me of—” Tony paused, looking around as he realized he was in Pepper’s office, and not his lab, “JARVIS, bring up project twenty-two-B.”
Steve knelt down on the ground and got between Tony’s legs, reaching up to shove the omega’s shirt off and toss it to the side. The small moan he received made him smile as he leaned forward and planted a kiss to the center of Tony’s chest. Pulling back, he pulled off the gloves he wore, tossing them into the start of a pile of the clothes. Next to come off was the helmet, his blond hair standing up on end from sweat. His jacket soon followed, being tossed into the pile. His lifted his eyes to Tony’s tilting his head to the side with a look of relief to just be back with Tony and to be alone with him like this.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t really care… okay I do care, but I don’t think I can really get an A&W burger around here.”
“Okay, so not Peggy. You can’t move out with your mom because she lives with your dad, you’d never move in with Colonel Phillips…”
“I think I can agree on that. Maybe there’ll be some kids running around when there’s a fire blazing and we’re sitting on the sofa with some cups of coffee. Might even have a dog too.”
Steve's eyes widened as he caught the slight whiff of flirtiness in the omega's scent. It was nice to see Tony be a little like his old self, but still, they had a visitor. "Yes, my omega, everything," he managed to say without sounding too excited.
Tony managed a light chuckle at his parents’ reactions. “Mom, Dad, I’m not thinking of suicide right now, I promise. I don’t really feel like I want to die anymore. But I’m still bonded to Steve… maybe not completely, but enough to make me physically sick sometimes. The doctor did confirm I have mate sickness.”
“He’s got every reason to fight, Mr. Stark,” Peggy stepped in. “From what I’ve heard, he’s capable of fighting just as well as the others.”
Sure enough, Steve’s thrusts got unsteady and lost their rhythm, the blond grunting and quickly shifting his hands from Tony’s hips to the poles that kept the cot’s shape. They creaked in opposition while Tony was pressed down into the cot more than before, a little whine of anticipation escaping the omega.
“I still had hoped we’d have a nice evening all the way through despite knowing Ty and Justin would be there. I should have known better.”
“I’ll see what I can do.” Steve moved his leg back to its original position, getting a sigh of relief out of his omega. “We just need to make sure that Schmidt doesn’t get ahead of our attacks on his bases.”
“Who’s the one who put that thing in the young man’s chest?” one doctor asked, and Howard raised his hand a little. “You did a good job for having no experience. You’ve saved him.”
“He roped me into funding the food and beverages, so he only invited me for the games. So how do you know  Rhodey?” Tony asked, slipping out from behind the entertainment center.
“I’m glad Dad left before Steve’s rut started, because that would have been a mess to deal with if he found out about Steve and I.” Tony sighed as he jumped up onto the island counter in the middle of the kitchen, wrapping his arms around his middle.
“Good to know. I’ll have to have JARVIS put together a playlist you’ll enjoy for some of the times you visit me in the lab while I’m working.”
Tony gave a little half-laugh at that. “Maybe you’d still be stupid if you were a beta. Can’t change a personality, even if you turn the person into an alpha.”
The omega laid in silence for a while, glancing around his room and noticing the bouquet of flowers sitting on the counter next to the sink. He couldn’t make out what the card said next to the vase, but he guessed they were from his mother.
“Sorry, food rations don’t do much to help that.” Steve knelt down and pushed Tony’s hands away, taking it upon himself to get the omega to his own orgasm. It wasn’t much longer before Tony was breathing hard and leaning heavily against his alpha, moaning and letting out other little noises until he cried out and came in Steve’s hand.
"Free food I'm down for any time." Steve chuckled. "I'll head over as soon as I have everything packed up."
The four of them walked over to a table that had a larger map on it, each of the Hydra bases marked with a little flag with the letter H on them and a little factory looking marker. There were six in total. Tony wondered who made the markers and flags as Steve started talking.
“Yeah, healing if I didn’t have these bandages on.” Tony grunted and grimaced, catching his breath as he struggled to breathe properly with the bandages on.
"If I'm with you in the middle of your heat and they tell me to leave, unless it's dire, I'm not leaving you."
Clint pushed himself up and leaned over Steve’s seat, snigging, “Oh my god, you really do smell like…”
Everything was so confusing to the alpha, so he ran, trying to find an escape route as he slammed open a pair of metal doors.
“Howard,” Maria said. “Do you really think this is best for Tony? I don’t want to sound like I’m opposing this but… well dang it, I don’t want to lose my baby boy.”
"Don't worry, I'll try my hardest. Besides, my sister might not want me around for long anyways." Bucky chuckled as he hugged Tony back with one arm.
Howard held his wife close and sighed. "Steve probably didn't know Tony was pregnant either… He wouldn't have let Tony fight if he knew."
“So helpful. I hope you’re not planning on taking me to the dumpster of a high end place. I would have gotten dolled up for nothing.”
Tony got up from his seat and tackled Steve in a hug, or the best attempt at a hug he could give around the table and chairs. “Thank you, I won’t let you down, I promise.”
“Some of my clothes may be a bit big on you, but I think the right pair of pants and the right top will make you look like the world’s most attractive omega.”
“Sure. When I was in the army, there were actually several omegas enlisted with us. They could come up with a mean growl, and they’d use it often when we’d spar.”
The omega looked over at the man. “I must have missed it. Then again, this is the first thing I’ve seen in here that I actually like.”
“No, you don’t understand… You need to know this. Steve and I shared my heat… and he was in rut at the same time. We…” Tony swallowed again, putting a hand over his stomach subconsciously. “We forgot to use protection and… Peggy, I’m pregnant!”
"Well, I do like when omegas wear little lacy things underneath their normal clothes. Gets me excited knowing they've got something pretty on that no one else can see. But really you don't have to do anything for me if you don't feel like it. I'm not going to force you to do anything for me."
“You were so good, Tony,” Steve breathed out, his breath tickling the small hairs on the back of Tony’s neck. “Such a good omega…”
"I'll show you, you'll see. Starting with our first date. I'll buy lunch, you don't worry about it… Even though a lunch won't be financially devastating for you."
“You big softie, of course I will,” the omega practically wailed as he threw his arms around Steve’s neck and cried happy tears.
The alpha, Bucky, nodded. "All targets were eliminated. It was an easy mission. They never heard me coming."
“Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he’s a god and he’s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.” Colonel Phillips pointed to a map of the world, pointing around the New York City area.
Tony covered his eyes as he started crying again, and it was all Steve could do to not whine and make it known that he didn’t know how to comfort his mate who had left his parents behind. But the alpha knew he had to comfort Tony even if he didn’t know the best way to do so. All he did was hold the omega closer and crooned. In a matter of seconds, Tony was calming down and curling up into Steve, and in the back of his mind, Steve made a note that this was probably how things were going to be for a while, especially after all Tony had gone through, and Steve was okay with that fact. He would be there for his mate in rain or shine, no matter what.
“I’m glad you decided to clean up before coming down, because you smell so nice now.” Maria smiled and reached a hand out to ruffle her son’s hair, still a bit damp from the water.
More silence. Tony didn’t know what to say. He knew what Steve was implying what Steve knew he needed to do, and Tony wanted to scream and object. Steve couldn’t leave him again, not when he couldn’t come back. It was unfair. They had plans for the future! They were going to get married, and they were having a baby together, it just wasn’t fair for Steve to leave again!
“Others seem to think the opposite.” Shaking his head, Tony leaned forward, his head resting on Steve’s chest. “We need a vacation.”
"I'm not drunk," Steve protested. "Just came here to get away." He stepped inside and started unbuttoning his shirt, turning to watch Tony closer the door to the room.
“Well, I was just thinking of how many major bases we had left to take down. Is this the last major base before we find the last one?”
“You’re just like all the other soldiers. You wanted to become one, and now you have.” Tony scoffed, throwing his empty hand in the air with another frustrated noise.
Slipping behind the screen, Steve set his uniform on the bench next to Tony’s civilian clothes before pulling the omega into a gentle kiss. It wasn’t hidden very well, because Tony may have been just short of the screen, but Steve practically towered over it. Regardless, Tony pressed closer to his alpha with a sigh, closing his eyes while he kissed Steve. He could feel the alpha shake just slightly, a hint of sadness filling Steve’s scent, no doubt as the alpha thought of Bucky.
The brunet shook his head, clearly not thinking he would be the one to be stuck to his partner’s side, despite spending nearly every minute with the alpha. “Nope, I’ve lived over 20 years without an alpha, I can do 20 more.”
“I make enough money myself through commissions,” Steve said. “Again, I don’t care about Tony’s money.”
“Fuck me, alpha,” Tony demanded, squeezing his legs around Steve tighter, and he got exactly what he wanted as soon as the words were out of his mouth.
“Well, you can look over the videos your father recorded for you. We do have those on file and ready for you to watch if you would like.”
“Fuck,” the omega whispered when Steve sucked harder than previously and started bobbing his head at a decent speed. “S-steve…”
Only a short distance was left before the limo arrived at the gala. As soon as the car was parked, Steve was noticing all the flashing cameras pointed directly at the car.
Steve tilted his head to one side. “No, I doubt that… I think they’re jealous because they don’t have me as a boyfriend and you do.”
Walking inside, there were hardly any customers shopping, mainly employees were walking around, going about their jobs with rather bored expressions. At least where Tony and Steve had walked in, the clothing department was close by, so it didn't take long for Steve to direct the omega towards the pajamas area of the omegas' section.
Steve smiled. “I wasn’t saying you couldn’t go. I still believe in the little guys fighting. I’m just telling you that you’ll be in enemy territory. Plus you’ll be around a… lot of alphas. The army is basically all alphas.”
“I know, sweetie, but I’m right here for you, and you’ll have me as long as I’m still breathing. You’ll get through this, okay?” She smiled and kissed Tony’s forehead, wiping away the tears that started falling again. “I love you so much, Tony.”
“Alright.” Tony tapped his knuckle on the window to signal for it to be opened and it was, a gloved hand appearing to help Tony out first to be greeted by the flashing cameras and the noise of the crowd mixed with the calls from reporters. He stepped to the side to give Steve room to get out as well.
Grumbling, Tony helped clean the lab, his anger still high as he did so. How could Steve be so stupid? He guessed that even becoming an alpha even if you weren't born one made you become a stupid alpha anyways. What a waste of time. Tony had given so much to Steve that meant a lot, and all that was thrown away after Steve decided he needed something sweet the day after telling Tony they would go on a date.
Steve’s hands very quickly flew to Tony’s hips as he woke up, a low throaty groan filling the room as his blue eyes focused on Tony. A new wave of his rut hit him all at once, and then he was growling as he made Tony move faster, demanding that the omega keep up with his seemingly insatiable need.
“The wounds were too deep. There wasn’t time to take them out, I had to… I had to put this in his chest. I-It's keeping the shrapnel away from his heart.”
“Time travel may not be possible… but I’ve been working on some calculations, and… well, all I’d really need is the materials to make this possible.”
Steve crawled onto the cot slowly, one foot still on the ground so he didn’t flip the cot over. He gently placed his hands on Tony’s knees, silently asking for permission to spread them. There was a bit of hesitation, but before long, Tony relaxed his legs and nodded at Steve, taking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly.
“Seems like news of my way of waking you up this morning has traveled. Must have been a nice way to wake up." Steve drove away from the building, not looking back as he took the two omegas away from their old lives.
“To a point,” Fury confirmed. “We also know how and when your parents died, if you’d care to know that information.”
The doctor returned soon after with results from the tests, and they were grim, as was expected. “I’m sorry to say, but Tony has miscarried… The baby has been lost.”
“I think we’ll be fine if we follow the plan. We haven’t lost one of the commandos yet to these battles, so don’t be the first.”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed his cheek. “Peggy called and told me what happened… I… I couldn’t let you be alone.”
“It seems we will have some time, yeah. Lead the way, we’ll pick up where you left off this morning.” Tony said, moving Clint’s bag to lean up against Bucky’s door.
Steve chuckled, starting to head to the entrance of the base. "You're nothing like your dad from what I've seen. I wouldn't give him credit for any part of your life either."
“Yeah…” Howard looked down at his arms, still covered in dried blood. “He’s my son, by the way. His name is Tony.”
Steve smiled at the agent and pulled him in for a quick hug. "Good to see you again, Bucky. Was your mission successful?"
"I agree. Maybe we can splurge on some more expensive pajamas in the future." Steve pulled Tony close and nuzzled him. "But for now these are perfect. Wanna get some snacks while we're here as well?"
“He won’t get suspicious if we do this quickly.” The eager omega released Steve’s cock from its cloth prison and groaned, taking it in before unzipping his own pants and shoving them off. If he was going to produce any slick, he sure as hell wasn’t going to get it on his pants. Thankfully there were things in the closet that the two of them could use to clean themselves after they were finished.
Tony sighed, deciding he wasn’t hungry enough to snack on cereal. “I thought I finally found an alpha I could be with, but then he just goes and kisses that damned beta girl like she was his savior.”
“Why should I? You decided a blonde beta took your fancy today rather than the omega you’ve been seeing for months now.”
“Oh my god, Steve,” Tony cried as they collided, the omega burying his face in Steve’s chest and inhaling as he let his tears stream down his face. Tony still smelled like he was in heat, but his scent was mixed with relief and happiness.
” his legs looped around Steve’s waist, and he began to suck on the alpha’s shoulder, leaving behind a darkening mark.
Peggy knew Howard was too worried to hear the murmurs from the doctors in the hallways, the talk of letting Tony drift off while making him comfortable in his last moments. It was something Peggy didn’t want to hear being spoken of,  but the reality was that not very many people survived cardiac arrest, even if they were resuscitated.
Steve smiled as he led Tony to his room, planning on spending the rest of the morning with the omega he felt would soon be his.
Howard ran a hand through his hair. “You’re too distracted by that boy… Don’t be disappointed when you can’t see him today. His world doesn’t revolve around you, you know.”
“It’ll happen, just wait.” The blond left a gentle kiss on his omega’s cheek just before the plane touched down, and everyone on the plane got to their feet and prepared to jump out as soon as it stopped rolling.
Steve smirked back. "Oh, so you're wanting me to be your alpha now? I didn't take you for falling for someone so easily."
There was a quick vibration from the ring Tony wore, and he had to hold back his tears as he watched his alpha be carried away, unsure if he was going to come back.
Steve called out to the omega, but when Tony kept walking, Steve sighed and turned back to Justin. "Look, I know we've just met, but that was rather unkind to say to my date. You're working to make a terrible first impression for yourself "
Tony studied Steve a long moment before sighing, “Fine, but if you can’t pay up, i’ll have my family’s lawyers hunt you down.” he said, standing up and taking Steve’s wrist, pulling him up and guiding him towards the side rooms used for private sessions. As he went he made a gesture to Clint so the other knew where he was going so someone else could handle the floor rounds.
Grabbing a chair with a sigh, the woman responded. “Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects.”
“Well, just don’t expect to be invited in every time you come over.” The older man sat down with a groan and started dishing out their meal.
A whine escaped Tony’s lips as he looked with wide eyes at his mother. The fear in his eyes was hard to miss. “I can’t… No, I need him here, I need to be with him!”
Peggy sighed. “He was an agent of Hydra, the Nazis’ scientific branch. Hydra is led by Johann Schmidt, a man whose power is based off of fantasy and legend. His goals are somewhat similar to Hitler’s, though we think Schmidt might be trying to break away from the Third Reich.”
“My son could get killed out here! And he’s in heat now? Are you stupid, Rogers? He should be home where he’d be comfortable and with his mother to help him!”
Both parents smiled at their son they were so incredibly proud of, and they both kissed one of Tony’s cheeks before Howard guided his son over to the machine.
Making up his mind, Howard grabbed one of the smaller knives and the lighter he had in his pocket, sterilizing the blade before, with a shaking hand, he dug it into the middle of his son’s chest. There was so much blood, and it was clear that Tony had lost a lot already, but if could get conscious once more, Tony might be able to get to a doctor to get more blood if he needed it. It was impossible to tell just how much blood he had lost already, but Howard hoped that he hadn’t already lost more than a third. Otherwise, it was almost guaranteed that Tony would die.
Tony sighed as he stepped back to Steve and wrapped his arms around him. “I’m so glad you’re back,” he said in a soft voice.
"These are… incredible," he finally spoke while pulling out a small sketchbook. "You came up with all of these?"
The next day ended similarly, though Tony didn’t throw up any on the third day. He simply just felt nauseous, but finally on the fourth day he got a well needed break. Tony felt nearly back to normal, not feeling nauseous at all or feeling much pain. He was happy for all of two days before he was suddenly thrust back into what felt like scheduled discomfort and nausea.
“We need to get Steve on that plane,” Peggy said when Colonel Phillips met them near a row of cars that had been parked in the hangar. “Otherwise we lose this fight.”
Sighing and pulling himself out of his day dreaming, Tony picked up a small box of medical supplies and carried them over to the wagon the other boxes were being stacked on. As much as he wanted Steve to join him in heat again, Tony knew that each time Steve joined him, they were risking being caught or having a pregnancy scare. Tony had heard of couples being so in the moment that they forgot to use protection, and of course it ended in pregnancy. It was a scary thought, though pregnancy couldn’t happen outside of heats. Still, having an unplanned pregnancy right now, well, it just wasn’t a good time.
Day two of waiting yielded the same results. Tony remained unconscious but steady in breathing and heartbeat. The nurses made sure that Howard and Peggy were getting enough to eat while they watched over Tony, as well as making sure that Tony was getting the required nutrients he needed to stay healthy while recovering. The waiting process seemed to take forever to Howard, though by medical standards, only two days of waiting for a patient to wake up was not as hard as waiting for years. Still, Howard only grew more concerned by the day, even though he was reassured patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were resuscitated typically woke up in a couple days. Howard wasn’t informed of how low the survival rate was, but he figured that if Tony wanted to keep living, he would fight as hard as he could.
Reluctantly, Tony stepped to the side so Steve could walk in. The brunet probably slammed the door closed a little too hard, but surely his father understood. “I still don’t want to talk, so don’t think that the bottle of whiskey you brought today is going to do anything.”
“Then you need to tell the colonel not to make you go anywhere until next month, because my heat is due to hit at the end of this month.”
“I hope you find Bucky,” Tony said quietly, to which he received a hug from the alpha. He inhaled the rich scent of Steve, letting out an involuntary moan.
Finally Steve made his last thrust with a strangled sounding groan, pushing his hips against the back of Tony’s and effectively pushing the omega even more into the cot. The sounds coming from the brunet were small and quiet, cute almost, Steve thought to himself as he made a few small thrusts, making sure he was in a comfortable position for his expanding knot. He was filling Tony up with his knot, and god did it feel good. It felt right, it felt like this was how everything was supposed to feel. Good, satisfied, comforted.
However… the heat would happen after the mission, so Steve would be able to stay with Tony and join him in his heat. Steve would just have to be really discreet about it, since Howard still, to their knowledge, didn’t know that their relationship wasn’t purely romantic, but also sexual.
“I know just the place.” Tony smiled. “Oh and I am counting it as our first date. The gala can be our second.”
Steve had a look in his eyes that wasn’t there before. It was more primal, and it was such an intense gaze that made Tony freeze and look at the alpha helplessly with wide eyes. He was at the mercy of his alpha, he couldn’t do anything unless Steve told him to. And oh god he wanted to hear that voice go rough and deep with his alpha tone.
Tony jumped when he felt one of Steve's hands gently grip the back of his neck, holding him down on the cot while the other hand brought Tony's hips up into the air, the perfect submission pose. Tony moaned into the pillow his face was resting on while Steve’s hands moved down his body and rested on his raised hips.
Ironically, back in America, no one knew Captain America’s omega, so Tony was an open target for anyone who walked passed him. Thankfully the terminal wasn’t too far away. Tony hurried as fast as he could without running, eager to see familiar faces again. Knowing that Jarvis would be waiting for him kept him moving, eyes straight ahead so he didn’t have to deal with the hassle of making eye contact with a random alpha.
Steve ran as fast as he could as he heard the woman’s voice suddenly around him and enhanced greatly in volume.
Having Steve back was so relieving to Tony. He hadn’t realized how stressed he got while the alpha was away. As soon as Steve was back in the picture, Tony was more relaxed about nearly everything. Doing chores were less of a hassle, prepping for his next heat went much smoother, and even working on his own designs for weapons and armor proved to be more enjoyable. Tony wouldn’t admit that he had become completely dependent on his alpha, but certainly being around him had turned him into a bit more of an omega than he had been in the past. Not that that was a bad thing. Tony was actually liking having Steve around to do some things, like getting objects off high shelves and opening jars that were being particularly tough to open.
The wiggling seemed to help, because Steve was growling louder and shifting until Tony was beneath him, a panting and whimpering mess ready to take his alpha. Steve bathed in the omega’s scent when he leaned down to lick Tony’s neck where his scent gland was. The action caused a shiver to run through the omega’s body, and Steve growled once more at the shiver, knowing full well how much power he held over Tony in that moment.
“Have I ever told you how glad I am to have you back?” Tony asked while opening his eyes again to look at Steve.
Tony caught his thoughts wandering again, which seemed to be happening quite a lot. Living with his father, it was hard to properly take care of heats when they came. Howard still didn’t know just how intense a relationship his son was in, which was honestly a miracle by any means. Tony was surprised his father hadn’t figured it out yet, because sometimes Steve couldn’t help kissing Tony right in front of everyone and it was hard to ignore how red the omega’s face was after being kissed. Nevertheless, Tony and Steve’s sexual relationship was still a secret to Howard and Maria Stark.
Staring at the front doors to the manor with his umbrella keeping him dry, Tony swallowed and kept his eyes trained on the handle. In his hands were some of his bags, Jarvis getting the rest of his things out of the car, and setting against his chest were small, cold pieces of metal that had all Steve’s information on them. Tony had insisted on Steve keeping his dog tags, but secretly he was happy that the alpha had told him to take them. At least it was one thing that he could have on him at all times that smelled like his alpha.
Steve nodded. “Well, ruts are a bit different compared to heats, aside from the obvious,” Steve continued. “Heats you can feel coming only hours before, if that. Ruts you can feel coming days, even weeks before. I don’t know when your next heat is due to arrive, but… I just want you to know that I can feel another rut coming. I’ve felt it for about a week now, and I don’t know how much longer until it finally hits.”
“Now don’t go thinking that way,” Howard said gently. “There’s no way of knowing what Steve was thinking in that moment, and even if he had known, he might have still chosen to go down. We don’t know, Tony… But if there’s one thing I do know, it’s that he loved you very much, and if he’s still alive somehow, I know he’d be fighting his way out of the ice and snow to come back to you.”
Tony looked at Steve, his eyes a little teary from just how sensitive he was where they were connected, and then he smiled. It wasn’t the same cocky smirk he’d shown previously to Steve, it was softer, almost shy with how content he was feeling. “Pretty omega?” he fished.
The hospital was bustling with people, both patients and medical staff. Several beds were filled up with injured soldiers, and Howard worried there wouldn’t be room for his own little soldier. He was reassured that there was an empty room ready to take Tony, however, and that eased his worry if only slightly. With Peggy, he waited until the doctors had Tony medicated, to take away the pain and swelling, and monitored closely for any signs of heart failure. It took a while, but finally Howard and Peggy saw the doctors approach, and none of them looked grim at least.
Happy and content, Tony didn’t even notice when another alpha approached and tapped Steve on the shoulder.
“Yeah, yeah. Always need the rest.” Tony smiled at Peggy. “Take the day off, get a cup of coffee, enjoy your free time, Agent.”
“Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers… killed in action. Period.”
“I don’t give a damn about your opinions,” Phillips grumbled. “I took a chance with you, Agent Carter, and now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead. All because Rogers brought his little omega with him and wanted to protect him, and you helped him.”
Tony sighed as he watched Steve turn and exit the stage, grunting a little as the pain in his rib returned briefly. He was glad it was healed all the way, but every once in a while, if he made a wrong move, his side would hurt for a brief period of time. As the alpha passed him, he didn’t try to say anything or touch him. He looked upset enough already. Maybe after getting out of his costume, which was still stupid looking, Steve would feel a little better.
leave a lingering scent of omega out where anyone could smell it on him. To Tony, that meant that Steve not only wanted to scent the omega in a natural attempt to stake his claim, but also
“That was only twenty percent my fault.” the omega insisted, “And besides, why would I destroy such a work of art as this guy? Unless I’m taking him apart with my mouth I just want to admire him!”
"I do have a car. I'll let you know what to do before I pay in the morning, then while I pay you can talk to your friend and meet me by my car when I'm done."
Steve couldn’t really help the slight blush that crossed his cheeks. “I’m sorry about all that happened to you. I tried to save you sooner, but…”
Howard grumbled as he walked away, heading to the cockpit of the plane to start take off procedures.
"I'm sure you could. Rolled your ankle, felt too uncomfortable around other alphas, had a bit too much to drink, all possible excuses."
Tony smiled and nodded. “Thank you. Um… if it wouldn't be too much trouble, I’d like to see those videos now, or sometime soon.”
Steve shook his head with a smile. “Sorry, you need to wait to see it. Otherwise all the excitement would be taken out of it.”
Peggy hung up, leaving Tony in silence with Jarvis and Maria’s hands still on his shoulders. When Peggy could no longer hear him, he wailed and sobbed, mourning the loss of his friend that he hadn’t seen since August, and now he wouldn’t ever see Bucky again. The pain of knowing that Bucky was lost forever weighed heavily on the omega, his hormones already a mess from being pregnant.
He started to move his hips against the alpha’s closing his eyes as he stopped himself from straight up slapping Steve awake. Luckily Tony didn’t have to wait for long for Steve to finally wake up. The room was practically saturated with the omega’s scent, so it was only a matter of time before the alpha responded and woke up, wide eyed and intensely focused on his omega.
Another big thank you for TiBun for being my beta reader in this fic. Without her, The Strongest Hearts wouldn't have turned out as great as it did. I couldn't be more grateful for her help and encouragement, and for tolerating the long time it took for me to write this fic.
Even after leaving the hospital and going through a full physical recovery after the miscarriage, Tony was never really the same afterwards. For months after, he was victim to his depression and anxiety, often being closed off to the world and those who cared about his well being. After the United States Army recognized him as an official soldier in the war, several of the Howling Commandos came to visit Tony in his home in Malibu, and he was so very glad to be surrounded by friends he cared deeply for. He was especially glad when Peggy came to visit. Tony often found himself glued to her side, almost literally, when she was around. She was the closest living friend he had, and he was determined not to lose her to some catastrophic event as well.
Once they pulled into the private parking garage of Tony’s tower, Tony stumbled out and lead the way up to his penthouse apartment at the top where he was quick to shed his fancy clothes so he could pull on his new pajamas. Immediately, the omega felt himself relax and calm some of the lingering anxieties from the confrontation with Justin.
The omega grabbed the pallet Peggy had pointed to and slowly painted on the black eyeliner, giving himself wings as an added flare. He admired his work before adding some to his bottom eyelids, then closed the cake pallet and set it back down. Maybe he needed to do a bit of contouring too, but he was happy with just the eyeliner.
“That’s why I’m here…” she sighed and moved to sit on Howard’s lap instead, looking up into his eyes, “The doctor’s worried. He feels at this point that there isn’t much he can do. Tony needs the feeling of security, and Steve isn’t here to give him that. It’s up to us to try, and hope that it’s enough to bring back his appetite before it’s too late and he loses the very last thing he has of Steve…”
All the soldiers ended up returning to the base that was their safe haven in London, Howard waiting there to hear the news of how the mission went. He was worried he wouldn’t see his son among the soldiers filing in, but he didn’t have much more time to search before he was pulled away to begin formulating a search plan, first to find whatever source of power Schmidt had been using, but also to search for Steve, as he had learned the grim news from Colonel Phillips. It was painful to hear, knowing how close his son had been to the captain, but he refocused his mind on the search plan. He didn’t notice when Peggy and Tony slipped in last behind all the soldiers and Howling Commandos.
“Oh, they’ll definitely be asking about you. If anything, I’ll only give them the base facts. Your name, and the fact that you’re my date. They want to know more? They can google you. Unless you want to say more.”
But there was still one spark of hope left; the baby growing inside him was still healthy despite the warning the doctors gave Tony about stress, both physical and mental. The baby was the last thing Tony truly felt he had that still had the spark of Steve’s spirit in it. His baby, whom he had called Little Bitsy on the plane, gave him some sense of a will to live. Little Bitsy was what kept Tony going, what kept him from ripping out the arc reactor in his chest and letting himself die while laying on his bedroom floor with a suicide note in hand.
“Howard? Are you in here?” Peggy’s voice spoke up, startling Howard a bit. She stepped into the locker room, and to her horror she saw so much blood on the floor along with Howard hunched over Tony with tears in his eyes.
Tony was absolutely sick of everything! Why couldn’t all his symptoms just magically go away? He’d be a lot happier if he was healthy again and could await his alpha’s return in peace without having to run the bathroom what felt like every ten minutes.
“You wouldn’t be able to keep your hands off of me. Once the war is over, you’ll be stuck to my side like glue, I guarantee it.”
The rest of the car ride was spent in silence. Steve was as confused as ever, but he still couldn't stop thinking about Tony. His ring had broken on impact with the ice back in 1945, and he was devastated that he didn't even have the pieces to try to put it back together. He didn't have a ring to show off anymore to say he was getting married. And hell, he worried that Tony had moved on from him and married some other alpha, had a family with that alpha and had just completely forgotten about him. He'd be heartbroken to find that out, but could he really blame Tony?
Tony winced at Peggy’s sharp words. He knew she was going to be upset, but somehow he didn’t think of how upset she would be.
Quickly shedding his fancy clothes, Tony fell back on his bed and into the half made nest that had slowly been falling apart since the end of his heat back in August. Soon it would be time to build it back up again, but that could wait. All Tony wanted that night was to curl up with Steve and sleep peacefully while the worries of the world faded away. Sighing, he curled up on his side and closed his eyes, listening to Steve move around the room and eventually join him on the bed. He instantly felt better once the big alpha wrapped his arms around him.
Steve gave a short nod. “All for the glory of Hydra, and to provide better lives to a couple of omegas who deserve far better than what they have right now.”
Tony got out of the back of the limo in an omega style tux of his own, a hint of glitter in the threads of fabric to make him stand out when the light hits it just right, a bright red tie, and a pair of sunglasses on his carefully makeuped face. He strolled into the building and up to Steve’s floor, grumbling about the broken elevator the whole way before pausing at Steve’s door, pulling out his phone to double check he had the right one. Then he finally knocked.
“Hurt… want these bandages off.” Tony opened his eyes again and looked over at Peggy standing in the doorway. She understood the look he gave her, and she stepped out to find a nurse.
Before too long, mother and son were on their way to the nearest shopping mall, intent on buying new clothes and perhaps a few cute things to add to the house decor. It was a much needed distraction for Tony, as he had a lot on his mind. With Steve being overseas and the omega’s heat coming up, there was a lot of stress that needed relieving, and a shopping trip was exactly what Tony needed.
Trapped. Tony loved feeling trapped under an alpha. Though he’d never admit it to any of the alphas that had paid to bed him. He just couldn’t resist the omega side of him that loved being pushed down and held close by a much larger alpha body. He had the same physical wants and needs as any omega—he just hated the restrictions society placed on them because of those wants and needs.
“Mr. Stark, with all due respect, that’s a lot for an omega in heat to go through,” Peggy spoke up. “It’s better that he stays in the camp until his heat is over, then you can send him to London.”
“I…” Tony fidgeted with his hands as he looked up at Peggy. “Steve and I got… close over the holidays. Like, we shared one of my heats together.”
“Do you have an appointment?” the receptionist asked, not bothering to look up from the computer screen as he typed away. “Or are you here for the prosthetic conference?”
Once Maria was gone, Peggy, came back around to the side of Tony’s bed. “I told the doctors that the bandages wouldn’t be helping, but they didn’t listen. Thankfully these nurses are willing to help you feel more comfortable. You’re also on a liquid suppressant, so your heat isn’t as bad as it could have been.”
Humming, Tony relaxed again and closed his eyes, “Tomorrow is going to be interesting… Stone doesn’t like it when his omegas run off, so we’ll have to be sneaky about it. I hope you have a car or something.”
Tony gagged again and turned his face back to the toilet, shaking terribly and whining between heaving. When he was finally finished, he clung to the toilet like letting go would cause him to throw up again. Of course, he didn’t when Maria coaxed him away and cleaned up his face, but his stomach was still upset.
The omega groaned at his mother, but he silently thanked her. “Anyways, clothes shopping sometime within the next few months sounds great. Any excuse to… do anything other than dwell on the fact that my alpha is on the other side of the world.”
Steve groaned again, straightening up and shuffling forward until his erection was pressing against Tony's ass eagerly. He hardly had to move before Tony was begging even more to have his alpha inside him. Steve smirked at the begging, liking that only he got to see the omega like this. This act, this behavior was all his to enjoy.
“As long as we’re both soft and cuddly once we change.” Tony said, digging through the rack of pajamas, looking for the softest one in his size, regardless of color. Sure, red was his favorite, but they seemed limited in choices already, so why bother with worrying about color.
“I haven’t had a good warm meal for a while anyways. Thank you for the invitation.” Steve smiled at Howard as the meatloaf was placed on the table.
Obadiah hummed and chewed on his lip. "Well alright then… but there will be some alphas who won't be happy that I promised you'd get a dance with them. Seems like you won't be available for those."
“Hey, sweetie,” Maria said with a smile, running a hand through Tony’s long dark curls of hair after he had sat down. “Are you feeling alright today?”
That got a laugh out of the omega, but also a playful punch thrown in Jarvis’s direction. “Okay, I think you had too much to drink.”
The blond didn’t take long, knowing how much Tony loved cheeseburgers and knowing how hungry the both of them were after only having a light lunch. He was in and out of the changing room in a flash, sporting his tan army dress shirt, pants and tie. Tony wasn’t too fond of the outfit, but they got respect wherever they went because of the outfit, so it was good for something at least.
The two finally arrived at their date location, Tony looking up from Steve’s neck to see where they were. Boasting that it was established in 1874 stood the Criterion Restaurant, a place that Tony knew royalty and parliament members dined. Getting out of the car, the omega looked wide eyed at the entrance of the restaurant.
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Tony muttered, trying not to let his tears fall as he pulled back and smiled. “We shouldn’t keep her waiting any longer. I’ve been gone far longer than I anticipated.”
When breakfast was all cooked, Tony easily scarfed down three plates of food, and there was still tons more food left over for Steve to have whenever he woke up and came down the stairs. In the meantime, Tony dumped his used dishes into the sink and wandered around the manor for something to do. It seemed that Maria and Jarvis had begun setting up holiday decorations, which Tony loved. Everything already felt more light and cheery, except for the fact that Bucky was still over in London working with the Howling Commandos. Remembering that simple fact, Tony sighed and looked up at the large tree set up in the parlor. He missed the alpha dearly. Bucky had always given him great hugs, and that was what Tony wanted in that moment.
Tony didn’t make any sort of sound of agreement, he just curled back up underneath his blankets and heaved out a large sigh, as if he was relieved to finally return to resting. By the time Howard had gathered everything up and left the room, the omega was already half asleep.
“I’ve only had as much as you’ve given me,” Jarvis argued, though he did stand up and offered his hand out to Tony.
“Smell his face if you don’t believe me; he was down there. And now he’s taking us both away with him.”
Whining, Tony looked down at his captor and tried to kick at him. His efforts were useless though, and the omega was thrown to the ground and pinned down by the wrists with the alpha’s hands, his ankles being bent a strange way that prevented him from kicking out again.
"Sorry, I thought you heard me call your name. I should have knocked or cleared my throat or something." Steve rubbed the back of his neck. "Sorry…"
Steve’s apartment was cold and quiet. It felt lifeless at Tony helped bring his things in, and he wanted to cry again. He had already cried so much, but there was a lot that had happened all at once, and his poor hormones were suffering. At least there was something he could do to help liven up the room. He unpacked the framed drawing that Steve had given him for Christmas and leaned it up against the wall on top of a bookshelf. It brought back a little warmth into the apartment, but it would never be enough to make up the coldness that Bucky’s absence would leave in both Steve and Tony’s hearts.
Clint didn’t respond, so it was clear his ears were not yet in, so Tony stumbled forward, tackling the other omega down onto one of the beds.
Steve felt a shiver go down his spine as the omega looked up at him with a smirk that held a lot of power in it. “Exactly how far away is your room from theirs?”
Steve seemed to puff up, taking in the praise he got from the other soldiers, but he didn’t pay mind to it for long. He looked back down at Tony and wrapped his arms around him before pulling him into a deep and longing kiss. Clearly he had been wanting to kiss Tony again for a long few days. “I missed you so much,” he said after pulling back.
“I did, but…” Tony sighed. “Maybe this conversation would be better off starting at the beginning of the story.”
Tony sighed, looking down at the floor. “I really don’t want to go back to our apartment tonight. I’d rather stay with you.”
The two remained there for the rest of the day until food was needed, which Steve took it upon himself to make. He wasn’t going to make Tony do anything that society viewed as chores that omegas usually did when a couple lived together. Tony deserved time to relax and do as he pleased while his alpha did the normal chores he usually did. After dinner, Tony cried himself to sleep with Steve curled up around him, crooning deeply to help the troubled omega fall asleep easier. They both had a rough week ahead of them, so they were determined to help each other as much as possible before they were going to be separated.
Nothing. No response came, and that was that. Steve was gone, and Tony didn’t want to admit it was true. “Steve?
“Good…” Tony sipped his wine, hand shaking as he worked up to his plan. “I uh… I hope this next mission won’t be too dangerous.”
“Okay… We’ll probably go around four, so we have things to make dinner with.” Maria smiled. “And make sure to dress warm, okay? If you’re feeling better, I don’t want you to get worse.”
The older Stark went back to the front of the plane with a quick pace, clearly not wanting to see his son or even talk to him. The mission was more important to him in that moment than his son who was suffering from a heat and was watching his alpha leave him while in heat.
The omega didn’t wake up until late in the night, the moon high and full and shining soft light into the room. When Tony woke, he moaned softly, not yet willing to wake up his alpha. He sat up slowly and took in a deep breath, Steve's scent thick with rut, causing a wave of slick to rush out of Tony's body. He moaned again, moving his legs so he was sitting indian style and balling up his fists in his lap. An intense feeling of need made Tony shiver, and he looked over at Steve’s sleeping figure, which only made him produce more slick.
That afternoon, Tony and Howard began work on the machine that would hold the omega in suspended animation. It looked very similar to the chamber that Steve had been in to get injected with the serum, though there was more of a window to see inside, just for someone to check if the omega was still alive from time to time. There was still a lot of math to do, but Tony and Howard worked together to check, double check, and triple check all the numbers. They were finally able to confirm that the machine would run for a very long time, running off of a larger arc reactor that was about the size of a small tractor tire. The two spent weeks creating the reactor, and using Tony’s smaller reactor as a base, they were able to get it working to full capacity just a day after it was completely built.
All the survivors had been given the orders to move out and head back to London, as soon as the dead and wounded were counted. Tony knew he should have been counted in that wounded number, but he needed to know when and if Steve radioed in to ask for help. He needed to be there for his alpha, no questions asked. Besides, he still really wasn’t in any pain, or at least he couldn’t feel any pain despite finding it hard to keep himself upright , and his heart was beating at a normal pace. Or at least, normal for needing to talk to Peggy after all that had happened in the capture of the Hydra headquarters. Tony knew Peggy was going to be furious with him, but Tony would argue that he had to come, had to fight. Besides, he was still alive and wasn’t even beginning to have a protruding belly quite yet, and as long as he was alive, surely the baby would be perfectly fine.
"And that's why they call you the Winter Soldier." Steve turned to the omegas and smiled. "Tony, Clint, this is Sergeant James Barnes, he's an old friend from back in the war."
Waiting for that moment of Tony’s awakening was proving to become more difficult, and Howard began to worry about making a call to Maria and break the news to her. He didn’t want to make the call, but by the end of the second day, the chances of Tony waking up and surviving seemed very slim. Howard probably had an understanding of why, but Peggy knew the situation better, and if Tony had made his decision that living without Steve wasn’t worth it, even with a baby that Steve was the father of, Tony wasn’t going to wake up ever.
"Never said I expected you to believe it, but I could damn well show you. Getting that serum injected into my body turned me into the alpha I am." Steve spread Tony's legs open and settled between them, licking up the exposed skin up to the collar around Tony's neck.
Three in the morning came around and Tony had barely slept for a couple hours. He was wide awake when he had to hurry off to the bathroom once more. He just wanted a break from throwing up, because at that point he wasn’t throwing up bad food any more, and his throat was hurting pretty bad. Stomach acid was never fun to throw up.
Looking down, Tony noticed a familiar glow emanating from his chest, and the source of that glow hurt. He couldn’t identify why it hurt until he focused and thought. The arc reactor. It was
“That’s not why I’m scared,” Howard snapped. “You keep acting like you’re not an omega, and that will get you in trouble one day. I know you were training for something, but I didn’t say anything. I figured I would give you a chance to prove you were smart, but you really blew that.”
Peggy searched her closet, picking out a pair of pants that were a dark grey, then she picked a top that flared out at the bottom. She held it up to Tony, tilting her head in thought. “Why don’t you go put on those pants real quick, and tuck your shirt into it. Lose the suspenders for now.”
The walk was somewhat long, but Tony was there at the front of a team of alphas and betas, feeling almost like he was leading them to battle, though he knew it was really Phillips leading them. Sighing, Tony walked on, keeping his rifle close to his body, eyes roaming over the trees and looking for any abnormalities.
“Bucky, you’re back.” Tony smiled and hugged the alpha, glad to see his friend back from the latest mission. “I assume this means Steve is back too?”
Winter soon turned to spring in Malibu as the months passed. Tony had forgotten how lonely he got sleeping in his own bed that smelled like only himself. There had been several nights where he crawled into bed with his mother, comforted by the slight scent she gave off. With her being a beta, it was sometimes difficult for Tony to find comfort when snuggling up to her, but she had her own distinct scent that wasn’t entirely muted by her neutral secondary gender. Tony was grateful she at least had some sort of scent as opposed to no scent at all.
“I can do lacy underthings.” Tony shrugged, “Single omegas are very limited on what we can shop for and cute panties are one of those few things. I have a decent collection already.”
Tony clutched his stomach with another cry before he reached as far as he could to turn on the lamp on his nightstand. Yellow light flooded the room, and Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach as he saw the bright red blood covering the blankets, sheets, and shirts he had been huddled under. He started to panic, whispering “
“I should have had Jarvis tell someone of his condition when he was dropped off at the plane to be taken back to London…” Maria sighed.
Tony rolled his eyes with a chuckle. “I’m sure that’s it, and they’re not staring at me because I’m currently the only omega in here and I’m all dressed up.”
“Get everything off of him and put clean clothes on. As soon as the car’s ready, we’ll go to the hospital.”
“It just might...being drunk, I am more easily intimidated by overbearing alphas, and in my attempt to get away I could trip and hurt my ankle.”
It wasn’t much longer before the entire Hydra base was burning to the ground and the Howling Commandos left to trek back to their camp. Steve and Tony hung at the back of the pack, taking guard once more as they walked. Being at the back also allowed them to reach for each other’s hands and hold tight, both glad they made it out alive. It may have been a short mission, despite being one of the major bases, but the tank explosion had taken care of most of it anyways. Tony had been thrilled either way, and he couldn’t wait to go on the next mission.
Tony trusted her, hoping she left a note or something… or hoping that she didn’t leave any sort of note. “Okay, so where are we changing our clothes at?”
“The hell I’m not,” Tony grunted as the ringing in his ears subsided a little. “Gotta keep going. Gotta help Steve…”
Tony looked up at his king, the magnificent blond that had stolen his heart in a matter of months when they first met. He smiled and reached up to touch Steve’s cheek. “You have no idea how much I really love you…”
“Alpha please,” Tony begged, his arms spread out over his head while looking up at Steve. “Take me alpha…”
“Oh? How are you going to teach me?” Tony asked as he grabbed himself a glass of champagne from the tray Jarvis was carrying around.
A few days passed of Maria taking care of Tony, and he seemed to get a little better. His back pain remained, but his cramping did eventually go away, much to his relief. Having being taken care of properly and cleaning up when he could put him in a better mood, especially after allowing his mother to take care of him. Trying to take care of himself like he used to had proven to be not a good idea, Maria decided.
When he knocked, he didn’t expect to get a response. After being met with silence several times before, Howard never expected his son to respond to knocking on his door, and this time was no exception. When no response came, Howard carefully balanced the tray on one hand before opening the bedroom door and slipping inside. He set the tray down on a nearby accent table before closing the door behind him.
“Okay, I’ll see if our doctor can do a house call then.” The woman smiled comfortingly at her son. “I’ll be right back after I make the call, okay?”
“I should have told Steve before we attacked the Hydra base, or told him over the radio when he was on that plane. Maybe he wouldn’t have decided to go down with the damned thing.”
With all the commandos scattered, it was easier for the Hydra agents to single others out, and of course they chose Tony to focus on since was clearly the new one. Tony was quickly surrounded, guns aimed at him as he looked around. They were shouting at him, mostly in German, but he paid their words no attention. He had a trick up his sleeve to get him out of the situation. Now if only Steve would look over and see the trick be put into motion...
The three were silent until they got back to their little camp. Tony couldn’t exactly control his thoughts very well as he helped pack up and get ready to move to the extraction point. It was hard enough not to glance over at his alpha and think of how they missed spending yet another heat together. Sure, the suppressants were working well and keeping his heat at bay, but as soon as they got back to London, Tony was sure that his father would take away the pills, and the poor omega would careen into a heat with him being totally unprepared. It wasn’t the most ideal situation.
“And you’ll do all this for us, even if neither of us agree to being your mate? You’ll give us both better lives for possibly nothing in return?”
Of course, none of that mattered to Tony. All he could feel was emptiness, a hole in his being that was suddenly ripped open and left to decay while he was left alive with a physical hole in his chest. Everything about him hurt. His soul, his body, his mind, everything was hurt and broken, and Tony felt he had no way of healing after all he had gone through.
“We are taking the fight to Hydra,” Phillips replied. “Pack your bags, Agent Carter. You too, Stark. We fly to London tonight.”
“I love you guys too,” the omega responded. “I hope… that Steve is found alive soon, and we can all be together again…”
A heavy sigh escaped Tony’s lips as he let his arms drop back to his sides. "It won't, but I'll stay. I don't want to be around a bunch of drunk alphas anyways."
Maria nodded. “You finish eating then, and I’ll go get you some medicine.” She stood up, setting down the magazine she had been looking at, then ruffled Tony’s hair as she walked past him.
Steve smiled. “Well, I’ll have to show you some of my favorites. I find they’re the best to dance to, when you have the right dance partner.”
Nodding, Steve pulled Bucky in for a half hug, patting his shoulder before looking back down at Tony. “I believe you need me for something now…”
The omega blinked up at Steve as if the thought had never occurred to him before, “I...omegas can do that and have it be effective and not….laughable to alphas?”
“I need you to stay here, Tony,” the blond said, seeming to ignore what the omega had said completely.
“Perhaps one day you will have them again,” Jarvis said with a comforting hand on the omega’s shoulder.
Steve growled and highly considered chasing after Justin, but he knew that Tony was hurting more, and he needed comforting and reassuring. Sighing, the alpha started his search for Tony, and luckily he found the omega sitting at the bar with a glass in hand amongst the crowds of people loitering about. Steve had become familiar with Tony's drinking problem, and he had been thankful to see the omega not drink so much whenever he was around. But clearly what Justin had said had upset Tony greatly, and seeing the omega in a heap at the bar made Steve's heart sink.
Most of the other cars on the road were also convertibles, which was a pleasant sight. To know that so many others were enjoying the nice day was a comfort, that the world wasn’t so bad, and the war was far away from the mind. Yes, Tony was going to be fine being without Steve for a little longer. By the time Steve would be coming home, Tony would be preparing for yet another heat, and then they could just focus on being together until Steve was called back to London again. Hopefully that wouldn’t be too soon after he came home.
“Bucky!” Tony quickly pulled away from his alpha, rushing into the arms of his best friend with a wide smile on his face. Bucky’s familiar scent was also comforting to the brunet, the peppery smell feeling almost like a second home, some place Tony could be safe and not worry about the troubles of the world. He casually ignored seeing his father pull away from the group to jog over to the hanger entrance where Maria was still standing after Tony had left her side to find Steve. He’d greet his father later. For now, he had Steve and Bucky to catch up with, and he knew his mother wanted to catch up with Howard just as much as Tony wanted Steve to hold him. He was sure Howard wouldn’t be upset at a delayed greeting from him.
Steve smiled wider. "Thank you. You look stunning." The blond grabbed his keys and exited his apartment, locking it behind him. "Alright, I think I'm ready to go."
That was when he noticed the tears rolling down the omega’s face. He sighed and let his shoulder’s drop. “I’m sorry, Tony… I didn’t mean…”
As tense as the drive might have seemed, Tony still found himself grabbing one of Steve’s hands while he drove and rubbing the alpha’s knuckles in an effort to keep himself calm. There was no mistaking the distressed omegan scent filling the car. All Steve wanted to do was hold Tony close and tell him that everything was going to be okay. They would get to spend some down time together as opposed to a mission out on the battlefield. And besides, Steve was anxious to see Tony in heat with his newly buffed up body. Not that the heat was more important than comforting Tony, but staying with the omega and helping him through his heat was at least part of comforting him.
“I know…” Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him close. “I sure hope that doesn’t happen though.”
"None of it matters now. What matters is that we get our son back to top health and we save that baby of his. In this condition, I don't think either of them will survive if we don't try harder."
“You really need to let me set you up with a better system, Honeybear.” a muffled voice was saying from behind the TV setup, as if whomever was speaking had something held in their mouth.
“So what do we do now?” Tony asked when he had calmed down more. “The war’s over. The world doesn’t need Captain America and the Howling Commandos anymore, so what’s a couple of war veterans out of time got to do in a time period in the future?”
The two friends headed out once Tony’s things were packed into a taxi. Usually Tony would have delighted in watching the buildings of London pass by, but this trip, he just kept his head down, eyes trained on the floor. Several thoughts rushed through his mind as he rode in the car, and there were things he wanted to say, but he figured Peggy could wait to hear them. The news of him being pregnant could wait until the initial mourning of Bucky was over.
“You sure? I was the one to ask you out...and I even let you choose the type of food and you chose something so….normal. Most of the past people I’ve invited out to eat always choose someplace pricy…”
“Y-yeah,” Tony said shakily. He looked up at the heart monitor when it beeped, indicating that Tony’s heart rate went up rather dramatically. “Damn it… Can you, uh… leave me alone for a bit?”
Beside him Steve also sat up, calling out for the commandos to sound off. All of them responded, much to Tony’s relief. The couple’s eyes met each other as they both caught their breath, and then smiles broke out on their faces. As they smiled, the shielding mechanism on Tony’s suit finally gave out, sparking a couple times before disappearing completely. Tony chuckled.
“I know you have been busy trying to find Steve, darling, but… maybe you should take a break and go see Tony.” Maria suggested.
“Ruts can make omegas go into heat if they happen before the scheduled heat,” Steve said, taking one of Tony’s hands and wrapping it up in both of his. “I’d at least hope you’re starting to have urges to nest again.”
Howard looked down at the papers, noting the designs with a sigh. "Looks like I've got some ideas for a new suit to work on…"
Steve sighed and looked up at Tony, smiling guiltily. “You’re right… Right now is about us.” He stood up slowly, hooking his thumbs into the waist of Tony’s pants.
“You would never look good in a dress to be truthful,” the agent said as they finally reached the top of the stairs.
"I wouldn't care either way," Steve said with a shrug. He spotted a gas station and pulled into a parking space. "Alright, let's get you two some food."
“It’s a good way to save money after a move.” She agreed, “But after this project I doubt you’ll be hurting for the money.” she opened a door and gestured him inside.
Steve growled, grabbing Fury’s shoulder to stop him. “Then what the hell are we doing here? Quit playing games, I want straight answers right
Everyone in the room turned to Steve, looking at him like he was crazy for suggesting the plan. Even Tony was a bit surprised that Steve wanted to go in guns blazing, but he put his hands on Steve’s shoulders instead, looking at him expectantly.
As much as Tony hated to move, he knew he would feel better in the tent that didn’t reek of other alphas. Those scents only made his head hurt and his stomach hurt worse. He let himself be helped up by the agent, though he found it hard to move without feeling slick exit  his body and make him feel disgusting. The humidity after the rain helped none, only making Tony feel more disgusting and sick.
Asleep for 60 years? Sure that wasn’t right. But then again, nothing looked familiar. New York wasn’t New York any more. If the man was correct, then…
“See? I can get to work on it after I have those tools, as soon as you are ready! No more random clicking or squeaks in your ears. You’ll have hearing of quality.” Tony promised, petting Clint’s hair.
Pulling back, Tony looked at his mother with watery eyes. He took a moment to respond, but he nodded. “There… were some things I didn’t eat. They didn’t look appetizing,” Tony admitted.
The rest of the car ride was silent in terms of talking, the two omegas eating their breakfast while Steve drove, scarfing down a doughnut and coffee as he drove. When they finally arrived at the base, Steve pulled out an ID card to hand to the guard who stood at the entrance to the property. His card was approved, and then the guard looked in the backseat and took note of the two omegas. He contacted someone over the radio, warning whoever was on the other side of the two newcomers. Steve thanked the guard and proceeded onto the property, the large iron gates falling behind them as the alpha drove.
“Peggy,” He said, catching the attention of the beta as they headed up the radio tower inside the Hydra base’s hangar. “I wanna talk now.”
"Sorry I've been taking so long here. The guys know how to put away their drinks. I guess they're just recovering from having been held captive for a while."
“You’re a stupid alpha,” Tony said after his crying had settled once more. “This is why we shouldn’t make more super soldiers like you. They’d all turn into stupid alphas.”
The day Tony's heat ended started slow. His heat had ended some time in the early morning, so when he woke up, he was painfully aware of how disgusting he was. There were a lot of dried body fluids on him, and he was in desperate need of a bath or shower. Groaning, he got out of the nest, that was pretty much destroyed, and stretched, grimacing when he felt a bit of pain in his rear. Looking over at the calendar, Tony tried to figure out what day it was. He narrowed it down to December 13th or 14th. He’d have to check with his mother.
“Oh, you know, it’s a constant battle for the respect I am owed as an absolute genius with three doctorates, two masters, and a few just for fun throw-away degrees in various fields, with the people I work with who thinks this is no place for an omega because omegas are supposed to be submissive and small and soft-spoken, not loud and smarter than the alphas, and if they are they aren’t supposed to show it. Alpha pride is so easily bruised—no offence. —They all wish I was an alpha like my dad so they don’t feel bad for being outsmarted by an omega. And I’m sure you expected me to just say it’s great and leave it at that, but I tend to talk too much so this is what you get.” Tony laughed. “Honestly, if I could just drop the whole board meetings and crap like that and just sit in my lab working, that’d be great. But ‘
After waiting for Steve’s knot to deflate, the two cleaned up together and dressed in soft pajamas so they looked decent enough to join Maria and Jarvis in the parlor for unwrapping presents and eating a nice breakfast. They came down the stairs together with arms locked and smiles wide as they smelled the amazing cooking of Maria and Jarvis. Tony pulled away from Steve to greet his mother with a kiss on the cheek and a hug. He could already tell it wouldn’t be long before breakfast would be ready, and he sat on the island while he waited, Steve coming up beside him and waiting with him.
