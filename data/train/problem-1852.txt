“I suppose you wouldn’t recognise it,” John returned.
John knelt down and held the boy’s arms. There were tears in Sherlock’s eyes but he looked at John steadily.
“Actually, she’s not in Berlin.”
"Yes!" he shouted, leaping into the air. "Oh, yes!" he said again, striding across the room and pushing his hand back through his hair. "John, do you understand what this means?" He turned on his heel and swept directly back up to John, gripping his shoulders. His eyes were filled with the excited, mirthful energy he rarely allowed others to see but that John knew so well: a sinister kind of cheerfulness. The colours in his eyes shone, lit by an internal electricity. John loved that look. It was radiant, like catching a sunrise if sunrises were unpredictable and that much more spectacular for it.
Tweedledee held up a vial of liquid and Moran carefully filled the syringe. Tweedledum ripped open Sherlock’s shirt.
John took a deep breath and the music began.
want is so bloody important? You didn’t want to deal with the consequences of
He was angry. Even if Sherlock wasn't an observational genius, he knew John too well to miss the signals. What had changed? He'd seen John's expression from a distance when John had first spotted him. John had smiled; he'd been pleased to see him, as Sherlock had predicted he would be. What had happened in the past minute to change his mood? Though he knew psychology to be one of the more inexact sciences, he estimated that John’s change of emotion might have something to do with Switzerland.
John felt his chest tighten almost painfully as he recalled the consulting detective’s expression in that moment, cold mask of aloof detachment stripped by exhaustion and pain, and what John saw there was powerful enough to haunt his dreams. He’d been too upset at the time to properly consider what the emotion in those normally guarded eyes meant (having just learned everything he knew about his wife was a lie), but he’d had plenty of time later, lying awake at night or sleeping fitfully. The vision came back to him again and again.
She had
, Mycroft’s lips tightened at the memory. Magnussen had known weaknesses, pressure points, better than anyone—he’d known Sherlock was his.
dizzy the way blood never made him, the fury flooding upwards as he demanded, “
John’s eyes fluttered shut as he attempted to turn his focus inward. He needed to bring up to conscious thought what previously had been nothing but murky, subliminal hints and innuendo. In order to determine how Sherlock thought of him, he would have to think like Sherlock. Evidence. He needed to sort through the evidence to gauge what was real and what was not. It was all there in his memory, but he’d never dared look at it too closely for fear of what he’d find. Now he’d have to haul all of it up out of the dark rivers of his subconscious mind.
Sherlock blinked in surprise. It was the first time John had ever inquired about the title or composer of a piece. “It’s from
“Molly, I need your help. Meet me in the lab. Ten minutes.”
“The papers haven’t even gone through yet,” Mary shot back at Sherlock. “I’m much closer to family than you are.”
“That’s nice of you,” he murmurs, then offers a hand. “I’m John.”
The oppressive brightness is gone. John stands before him with a pointed frown, emphasizing the crows feet, the thin line of his mouth. There’s the everpresent edge of concern and exhaustion writ upon his very countenance. Still, despite his obvious despair, his hair is sideswept in the style Sherlock prefers, and he’s painfully irresistible.
0^0^0^0
He wonders what he could have said, convinced there exists a string of words that even his dull little mind could weave together that would have stopped Sherlock from plummeting to the ungiving sidewalk below. Half-formed confessions and praises blend, serving only to intensify the twisting guilt that perpetually claws at his ribcage. His therapist says it’s not his fault. Lestrade, Molly, the battery of acquaintances he sometimes elects to keep in touch with, they all say:
it doesn’t. If John could bend the laws of physics to the secretive whims of his heart, Sherlock would have never collided with that sidewalk in the first place.
“You asked for one more miracle,” he breathes. John’s mouth quirks in a half-grin.
“You always feel pain, Sherlock,” the other man murmurs. His neck cranes to the side with a sickening
“This doesn’t feel real,” he speaks aloud. The flat darkens at his words; it’s no longer the sundew stretch of light, more a morbid shadow cast about the lonesome space.
It’s too much. The great Sherlock Holmes lies comatose in a nondescript hospital bed and Mycroft, always the epitome of icy composure, is stripped bare, right down to his sorrowful bones. And it was all
The painting seems to grow in size at Sherlock’s cautious approach, and by the time he reaches it, it’s nearly taking up the entire wall. He clamors up on the couch and can feel something emanating off the stretched canvas; it feels like little gusts of cold wind, like there’s a different world just on the other side. Hesitating a moment, he turns back to glimpse John one last time, and the man is finally smiling properly, laugh-lines crinkling about his eyes. He gives a tight nod – a silent affirmation that Sherlock nonetheless understands:
“Let’s assume all of the prostitutes at Monroe’s use this lip gloss, which is mixed with”— he glanced over the results of the analysis—“what looks like a variation on the newly popular five-methoxy-di isopropyl tryptamine.”
“No,” John cut him off. “I’m not leaving. I’m going to ignore him, and we’re going to finish this game.”
“It was an experiment,” Sherlock said with abrupt dismissiveness.
“Look at the bruising around the puncture! He was clearly stabbed postmortem.”
John would have asked what other result Sherlock had expected from having a man the size of an elephant crushing his larynx, but Sherlock was already typing again. John checked his phone.
detective. His beautiful, maddening, genius, dangerous, delightful, high-functioning sociopath detective to whom he’d been irrevocably bound from the start. He’d been fooling himself if he’d ever thought otherwise. No number of girlfriends, not a wife, not even Sherlock’s death had been strong enough to pull them apart. No matter how many times either had strayed, they’d always ended up back at each other’s sides. They belonged to each other, and John could have laughed at how painfully obvious it had always been.
“And eat it? You have to eat it. You can’t just throw it at the ceiling or something.”
John locked his eyes on Sherlock’s. “I will lie to you when I want to."
Sherlock had spent the last few hours in the study of his mind palace, as he usually did on the nights when he slept. Sherlock had lucid dreams; he'd had them since he was young. From the moment he fell asleep to the moment he woke he was aware he was dreaming. He could control his own words and actions almost as precisely as he could while conscious. And although he could control what others said and did too (this had afforded him many entertaining nights winning at chess while Mycroft wore a hat adorned with fruit), he typically allowed the people he met in his mind palace to speak freely; witnesses from his cases, suspects, murderers—he let them do and say what they would, and he was often able to obtain a clue, glean a detail from their speech or actions he had missed during the day.
John looked at Sherlock strangely. "I was joking. I don't really think she'll dump me over it. The whole thing would just be a lot less painful if I knew what I was doing."
His untouchable flatmate had never been sexually interested in anyone before. Why should he be interested in John now? Irene Adler had come the closest, and she had been, well,
“I’m afraid it’s a rather posh affair. Black tie, you know how these things are,” she looked worriedly at John as though he might back out.
He went to the kitchen to make tea.
He replayed the events of yesterday: Sherlock appearing in Ireland, the fight on the cliffs, sharing the hotel room…
. You need to face me because otherwise you’d have to face yourself. And we both know you can’t handle that. You’re an idiot, Sherlock. You’re drowning in your own mind and you still need me to distract you from it.”
The solider who met mortal danger with clear eyes and a steady hand was afraid of one thing: Sherlock’s death.
“Sebastian Moran,” Sherlock said, reaching out his hand. “Pleasure to meet you.”
“My mother was forty when Sherlock was born. My parents already had two children and they certainly hadn’t planned on a third.”
“What’s this?”
here? On the one hand, if he did, he supposed it would be easier for Sherlock to wake him if he was in pain or if he needed something. On the other hand, sleeping in Sherlock’s bed… with Sherlock in it… John tossed aside the thought. Sherlock had been drugged, injured, and almost killed tonight, and now he was asking John to stay with him—whether for comfort (John couldn’t imagine) or convenience (more likely), or whatever reason, it didn’t matter. If Sherlock needed him here, he would be here.
“I can’t do this. I can’t give you that much and still not be a priority for you.”
John glared. “Oh I don’t know, why would someone dump a boyfriend if he leaves her in bed to go help his mad flatmate measure the living room? It was probably just a whim.”
An average (read: substantially more boring) person probably would have proven his hypothesis correct, but
“Tell me, I couldn’t decide”—Sherlock shut his laptop and jumped up on couch—“do you think I’m prettier in the red or the blue?” he asked, holding up two of his dressing gowns.
John’s smile broadened.
In the beat of the few seconds Sherlock paused, John’s neck had flushed red and Sherlock realised how intensely he must have been staring. He blinked a few times to rectify the situation and said, “I need to go to the lab tonight.”
Assassin, John scoffed inwardly. Maybe Mary knew him. John scanned the criminal record. Status: Inmate; Offense: Murder, first-degree, multiple.
"The chair will be easier to move without you in it."
He placed his hand gently on the boy’s arm, moving the light away.
“They’re right you know,” John had said, apparently just sitting on the edge of the bed in his boxers at this point.
“Yes, he needs a lift home,” he replied, indicating Sherlock’s unconscious form on the gurney. “See that he gets there.”
He crumpled the poem and tossed it to the floor. He didn’t need his brother’s help.
John knew he would still lose him for endless stretches of hours or even days to his work, but as long as Sherlock wanted him there at his side through the cases, and as long as Sherlock would reach for him in between, then it was fine. It was all fine.
“Goodbye, John.”
Sometimes he started text messages. Because just the possibility of reaching across the void to the one pinpoint of light glowing so faintly and so far away in London—the potential for even an electronic connection—was enough to send a thrill down his spine and through to his fingertips. But he couldn’t. He needed to know if his hypothesis was correct.
His only choice then was to duck the man—get around him fast enough to get to the door. The road wasn’t far off; there was a slim chance he could make it, flag down a car... Sherlock scoffed inwardly. Even considering this possibility seemed stupidly optimistic, pathetically naïve.
But if John was determined to be self-deprecating this evening Sherlock wasn’t going to indulge it by arguing with him. He supposed he could have asked John to stay in tonight, but he didn’t want to deprive John of his required goldfish time. Perhaps if John didn’t get enough goldfish time he might want to leave. Sherlock didn’t want John to leave.
“Take these,” John said, handing Sherlock the pills and water. “Oxycodone.”
He couldn’t change his brother, but he could prepare him. He wouldn’t send the boy out into the battlefield snivelling and defenceless. He would give him the necessary armour to fight. The wind might rage around him, but Sherlock would remain standing. Mycroft would see to it.
“Monroe’s. Tomorrow night. Ten o’clock.”
John considered. “I’m not sure it does.”
John's 'room' was more like a flat within the palace. There was a separate room for his office, which was divided in half—one side of the room dedicated to all of the information about John's training and career as a doctor, and the other side dedicated to his military career. Certificates, awards, medals, diplomas, and photographs decorated the walls. Sherlock could come here anytime he needed anything specific about John's professional career.
She shrugged. “You know, the war. He said he’s had them ever since they sent him back to London.”
John flexed his hands and took a deep breath. He hadn’t been able to say it at the time. But he owed it to Sherlock to say it now. He walked over to where Sherlock was sitting and cleared his throat.
“I’m afraid that, as usual, you are entirely missing the point.” The disappointment in Mycroft’s tone was something Sherlock had learned to tune out from an early age. “The theory regards love as a vulgar distraction for an idle mind and a dangerous weakness for a powerful one. It is illogical to make oneself vulnerable in exchange for an arrangement that can only end in loss and pain.”
“Then why are you mentioning her?”
not see him?” Sherlock asked plaintively.
“Sounds like Moriarty again.”
Billy. He could call Billy.
Sherlock’s throat felt dry. Possibilities for sentences were sluggish about forming in his mind. Despicable
Mycroft.
John wondered if Sherlock would be as patronising with his scarf wrapped and tied around his face. He clasped his hands together to prevent them from trying it. “So what’s my role then?”
“Tak odejdi, pokud chceš dělat hloupou!” Sherlock strode over to where she was standing and knocked her hand out of the way.
Sherlock’s eyes were still closed when John went back to reclaim his mouth. Sherlock parted his lips immediately and John was more than happy to indulge the request, keeping his tongue slow, controlled, while Sherlock explored it carefully with his own. John deepened the kiss, losing himself in it, pouring everything into it that he needed Sherlock to know.
Mary, in her wedding dress, stopping his heart—
John shot him a glare. Sherlock took it in stride. If he had an unmarked corpse for every glare John threw at him he would be a happy detective.
“Why yes, Sherlock, that’s just the thing I need right now. It’ll be a great distraction from my impending divorce.” John glared at the empty chair. “It’s so kind of you to not completely forget about me at a time like this.”
But no, John couldn’t be sure of anything, because Sherlock was different. Like him, Sherlock didn’t have friends or best friends either. John had no frame of reference, there was nothing to compare him to; there was nothing like Sherlock. But the lines of friendship and
Sherlock looked back at the ground. “But erm,” he hesitated, “it could also be because it’s not enough. They said I’m a sociopath. It made mummy cry. They said sociopaths don’t love as much as other people, but, John”—Sherlock looked up at him with large eyes—“I love you more than anything.”
Pause.
Sherlock had used fire to expose Irene’s, and Magnussen had used fire to expose Sherlock’s.
“Because the receipt has gone missing. And they won’t accept it back without it.”
He hung up.
“ALL RIGHT, WATSON!”
“Don’t go, don’t go, please don’t go,” Sherlock was murmuring into his jacket.
“From
“I was talking to you,” John growled.
"Oh, I've got it," she said brightly, digging into her purse again and pulling out an envelope. "All three bodies." She read his blog; of course she'd come prepared. The dubious legality of such a transaction was something John ignored with practised ease. To operate strictly within legal limits would defeat the purpose of a consulting detective altogether.
Sherlock looked up at him. “Want to do some more?”
John leaned into his flatmate’s wiry, sturdy body, thinking of the road through Hell they’d taken to get to this point. Walking through the door of 221B just now had felt like coming home from Afghanistan—wounded and weary, but this time he had someone to come home to. And not just anyone. The person who held him now was his comrade in arms, his flatmate, his detective, his scientist, the man who had saved him again, this time by inventing an impossible antidote, and by simply being who he was: genius, beautiful, inexplicable, infuriating, endearing, intimidating, immature, challenging, wonderful—someone to die for, but more importantly someone to live for.
Sherlock had almost forgotten what it was like to come home to a flat that wasn’t empty. He regarded John, who was curled on the couch wearing a long-sleeved shirt and pyjama bottoms. He took a step closer and John stirred.
Sherlock looked over at John, who shrugged.
Kathleen had said
“No, not boring. Heavy,” John corrected, heaving the bags up and dropping them down on top of his flatmate.
"No!"
John switched his gaze to Sherlock’s face and was startled to see the detective looking at him with plain, unreserved amazement. He was breathing heavily, eyes fixed on John’s. John felt himself involuntarily draw in a breath. Sherlock’s pupils were contracted to pinpoints, irises blown wide: the kaleidoscope colours in his eyes were dazzling, beautiful to the point of distraction and it took John longer than he would have liked to realise his pupils shouldn’t be contracted in the dim lighting. John held the side of Sherlock’s face with no small amount of concern.
“Actors are always dramatic,” John muttered.
"How likely is that to happen?"
“In addition to Monroe’s, Moran owns several other businesses in London,” Sherlock continued. “His name isn’t on any of the official documentation but I found repetitions. If you’re not interested in running an establishment by the books you need an agreement with your book keepers. The real estate agents and lawyers that can be paid to alter a few names and numbers are valuable assets for the white collar criminal and good tracing makers for me. Moran used the same people to set up several of his businesses, which evidence suggests operate dually as fronts for the more lucrative drug trade.”
“The car will be at Baker Street to pick you up in one hour. Be prepared. It may be a private jet, but that doesn’t mean anyone is eager to wait on your whims.” Mycroft’s tone was no less patronising over the phone than it was in person.
“There we are,” Bauer said as she set the tea tray down on the coffee table. She sat down in a matching green armchair across from them. For John’s sake Sherlock made a half-effort restrain a grimace as he was forced to read, through scratches in the fabric, the various explicit scenes that had occurred there. His skill in deduction was one he wished he could at least occasionally turn off.
. What kind of question is that? What does it have to do with Amy’s death? Who the hell are you anyway? Do you even work for the police?”
Harry’s advice was lurking in the back of his mind. At the moment, the back of his mind was the only place it was allowed.
This is about me. I'm a doctor and I’m good at it and
Not the other way around. Sherlock thought he could kiss him like that and then walk out without a word? Three days and no word?
Now he realised he might have been wrong, because Sherlock reached out his hand for the phone and said, “Please.” The effect of the word was to deprive John of any choice in the matter. Sherlock pocketed the phone and remained immersed in studying whatever was under the microscope that day.
necessary to please a sexual partner. He assumed that would mean hurting John, and he wouldn’t do that either.
John rubbed his hands over his face. Of all the goddamn cab drivers to get tonight. This guy had better hope Sherlock was alive. John did not have the best track record with cabbies.

“It’s hardly one of the more impressive of my accomplishments.”
been more justified.
“I know you’re supposed to leave now because I told you that, but”—Sherlock’s smaller hand tightened around John’s—“but don’t go. I’m sorry if it’s not enough but it’s everything I have. Please, stay with me.”
He looked around the empty flat. There were mugs and cups and saucers left around the living room from where Sherlock had evidently been moving restlessly the night before. John could almost see his pacing—the mug left on the mantel, the saucer on the table by his laptop, the cup on the windowsill… John shook his head. His flatmate was truly— John stopped mid-thought as something twigged in his memory.
Sherlock swung the laptop shut and stood up, using his height to his advantage.
Five hours and half a pack of low-tar cigarettes later Sherlock discovered with finality that the poem was not a cypher. He had employed every method of cryptography he knew and yet it would not break. He was forced to face the inevitable conclusion: the poem was only a poem.
“It’s small,” John said, eyeing it sceptically.
“What?”
Of course he was aware that Sherlock resembled the men in
“Cor, this is going to be the most bloody expensive fare I’ve had in ages,” the driver said gleefully. “You better be able to pay all this.”
Fortunately, this was not the first time he’d lived without John. Having met the doctor at the age of twenty-seven, he’d had a few years before John to find strategies for living independently. He knew what he had to do; he just didn’t want to do it.
"Let me see it!"
And suddenly there was Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock lowered his hand. "What?"
Sherlock smiled broadly and John wished there were more things besides murder and drugs that could get him to smile that way.
“Have you heard from Sherlock today? Did you see him last night?”
The rush was pleasurable enough to make his head tip back and his eyes flutter shut.
“Finish that sentence and consider your toothbrush donated to science.”
John. An echo in his mind.
“Some tea would probably be good for—”
“It’s just—well, he’s Sherlock. I can’t have him offending everyone there. The ladies on the board are—let’s just say their sense of humour isn’t as good as mine.” Her voice picked up its insistence. “He’s
It turned out that John's landlady, who had expressly promised he wouldn't have to dance, was as underhanded and manipulative as her mad scientist tenant.
He snatched the file and Lestrade let him take it.
John kept his eyes moving between the stripper and the detective. He had to appreciate the exceptional circumstance of being at a strip club with Sherlock Holmes. Even a Sherlock who was not remotely paying attention was an extraordinarily out-of-place figure at a pole-dancing performance.
The pain, when she was gone, was surprising. He hadn’t had much experience with psychological pain, and was amazed at how he’d underestimated it. He felt torn inside out, like his nerves were exposed and everything hurt. He was drowning and he couldn’t breathe and he knew that
“Shut up. I did it for my own sake. I wasn’t about to sit there and watch a grope-fest.”
John gestured to the wall behind him and Sherlock's eyes followed. He went still, undoubtedly replaying the kiss, the same flashing images (hands, eyes, lips, tongue) that were searing John's mind.
“Not why,” Sherlock said, swiftly scribbling a note across his calculations. “When.”
“Really.” Sherlock wasn’t looking at him.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock crouched in front of him and scrutinised his face with concern.
John thought the information that his role would be ‘imperative’ for an appointment with a prostitute did not bode well. “Where are we meeting her?” he asked warily.
“Excellent,” Mycroft said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “If you don’t mind I’ll just have a word with the doctor about Sherlock’s treatment.”
"We are not professionals."
John Watson was the only person Lestrade knew who could actually feel
Lestrade coughed and said, “Yeah, well…”
John smiled. Sherlock, god he’d missed him. His phone buzzed again.
Sherlock fell asleep on the carpet beside Redbeard and at three o’clock in the morning Mycroft knelt by his side. He put his arms around his brother’s shoulders to raise him up, and still half-asleep Sherlock automatically, like he’d done when he was much younger, wrapped his arms around Mycroft’s neck. Mycroft lifted him without difficulty—the boy was too thin—and carried him to Sherlock’s bedroom. When he put him down in his bed he was already sleeping—that deep, trusting sleep only children can manage. When he woke the next morning Redbeard was gone.
The consulting detective’s work was everything to him, and John was more.
“Nightmares,” Mary said simply when he caught her alone. “I thought you’d know—you lived with him.”
John put his elbows on the kitchen worktop and his head in his hands. This wasn’t the first time he’d been caught off-guard by these thoughts. They ambushed him unexpectedly, time and time again, and now he recognised the automatic sensations of disgust and hatred coursing through his body. He’d survived the last year mainly by blocking out these thoughts, working double shifts at the surgery, spending more time at the gym than he had since university—he’d even joined an amateur rugby team just to get out of the house on Saturday afternoons—but they always caught up with him. And each time his barriers broke down and the flood of arguments, the knowledge of injustice, washed over him he’d had a blow-out row with Mary.
Pause.
She bit her lip, more furious with herself than she’d ever been. She had miscalculated. When she’d turned from Magnussen and shot Sherlock she had placed a bet that if it came down to it, John would choose her over Sherlock. And a year later, standing in the kitchen and looking into John’s icy, dark blue eyes, she lost that bet.
Sherlock was pulled away and John found himself unable to protest. There were people around him fussing over monitors and Sherlock was gone.
Sherlock’s eyebrows jumped up. “What?”
This was the reason why Sherlock had to go in for the psych test and Mycroft hadn’t. Mycroft had the wherewithal to pretend to empathise, to pretend to care about other people. Sherlock didn’t have the patience. His psych test came back labelling him a ‘high-functioning sociopath’ and their mother had cried. Sherlock didn’t understand. He was only six years old at the time.
The detective snaps his hand to his side, the strange luminescence of his favorite painting forgotten, and spins around to face John head-on.
, strung along like a helpless puppy following at the heels of men who are always three steps ahead, their mental acuity too sharp to bother with divulging their secrets to someone so ordinary and
He’s so caught up in discussion with Dr. Taylor, and so raw from sleep deprivation bisected with sheer joy, that he fails to notice Mary hovering in the doorway, staring at Sherlock with an impish smile, and Sherlock glaring defiantly back.
When John yanks back the privacy curtain, he’s startled by Mary, who was evidently about to do the same.
Sherlock’s blood is mixed with rainwater in the gutters beneath West Smithfield and John’s future feels as unfathomable as it had after his return from Afghanistan, and there isn’t a damned thing he can do about any of it.
“Right,” the detective leaned into John’s forehead, working on slowing his rapid pulse. “I never imagined this was where our first kiss would happen,“ he admitted with a smile. John grinned.
“I don’t want you to feel that way ever again. Ever.” His voice was rough. “What do you need?” he asked, echoing Molly’s words from so long ago. Blinking, Sherlock was momentarily lost in a flashback to that time. How could he possibly deserve the friends he had?  His gaze refocused to the present, onto John’s shattered and shocked expression. It was raw and in John’s eyes he could see revelation and love and it almost broke him. He could be nothing less than completely open. He had no energy left for masks and half-truths.
“John.” He made the letters of his name sound like a prayer. “Nothing would make me happier than you and Rosie staying permanently.” John gave a small sigh of relief. Although, the corollary of that statement, the relationship part, was not yet addressed.
“I’m sorry, John, I’m so sorry,” Sherlock’s voice was thick over the phone. Had John been able to focus, he would have suspected that his friend may be sharing his tears. “Take deep breaths, John. I’m right here. It’s ok,” he repeated. Slowly, John’s hiccupping tears subsided and his heart rate slowed. He was able to talk again.
“Yeah. This kind of weather reminds me of the desert,“ he said quietly, not waiting for a response. “The nights were so long out there. The darkness was vast and deep. At 4 am, the silence was like a thick blanket smothering all sounds of life. I used to leave my tent, stand out behind the camp, and look at the stars.” His voice seeped into the silence of the flat and he felt his friend’s tension slowly easing. “There were so many stars, Sherlock. I wish you could’ve seen it. Londoners have no idea how many you can see when you’re far from the lights and noise of the city. I found it soothing to feel so small and so insignificant in a massive universe. My mood seemed less heavy, my worries less burdensome.” Sherlock had turned his head and he gazed at his doctor’s profile, loosening his knot of tension and relaxing into the cushions. “We are here for so little time. Just a brief flicker in a sky of bright flames.” John finally turned his head when he felt a clammy hand cover his own. “You alright?” he asked, barely audible. Sherlock’s swallow echoed in the dark.
“Hey,” John interrupted him, hanging the dish towel on over the oven handle and turning his full attention to his flatmate. “Sorry for what, Sherlock? Being human? Needing someone? This is what people do. It’s what friends do. This is what you and I do for each other—sometimes…less often than we should. Or could.  And I hope I don’t have to apologize for needing someone, too, “ John paused, tentative and looking away for a moment.  “Because I’ve needed you since the day we met.” Sherlock’s gaze shot up to meet his doctor’s, shocked. He audibly swallowed.
John’s steps thudded on the stairs as he lugged three bulky bags of groceries up to 221B. He arrived at a door slightly ajar and concluded that they had a visitor before he heaved himself through it, nearly tumbling into the sitting room. He had barely caught his breath, irritably wishing that Sherlock would help with the shopping just ONCE,  before looking up to find a very tense conversation taking place. Mycroft Holmes, clad in an impeccable gray suit, sat primly at edge of John’s own chair, across from Sherlock. That, in itself, wasn’t unusual at all, as he visited Baker Street fairly frequently these days. More alarming was the haunted pallor on his flatmate’s face. Sherlock was slumped and staring, looked as if he had just seen a ghost. John nearly dropped the groceries, but managed to set them down on the spot and took a step toward his friend.
Mycroft had a car ready for them in London. They climbed out of the chopper and John looked at his friend,
“To what?” Sherlocked asked, his voice at an octave that cut through the daytime clatter of the street, a pitch that John felt in his chest.
“Yeah, he said you can’t sleep and you won’t accept any help,” John said, busying himself in the kitchen with tea.
“I’m lucky.” He turned and headed toward his guest room, leaving Sherlock filled with a nebulous warmth.
“You need it right now. I can help you manage it when we get home. Sherlock,” John started, anger making its way into his tone, “How the fuck did this happen? Wasn’t there someone in the room with you? Did Lestrade really send you in to interview someone alone??” Sherlock would’ve shaken his head, but it ached too much and he grimaced.
“I can see that. Let’s give it a shot,” his friend said, as he pushed himself off the couch to order.
“Nothing in particular,” he answered vaguely.
“I’m not leaving you and Rosie,“ he rasped into his doctor’s hair. “I told Mycroft to fuck off.” John barked out a slightly giddy laugh at Sherlock’s use of profanity. He used it so infrequently that when he did, it held so much more weight. And if ever there was a perfect time to apply it, this was it. After a moment, he stepped back, sniffing and clearing his face with his sleeve.
“Obviously.”  John grinned.
“That, maybe?” he answered with a question, glancing over his shoulder at John’s arm suspended behind his back. John began to trace long lines up and down the man’s back with his fingertips, varying the direction at times, making long slow circles over and over and over. Gradually, he felt Sherlock’s tension ease and muscle by muscle his body relaxed. Eventually he slowed, as his arm tired.
“No, stop, Sherlock.  Stop apologizing. I realized it at the pool, with Moriarty. I knew, then, that I’d do anything for you. Absolutely anything. And when you were gone, I swore to myself that I would never, ever again love someone without telling them. I  told myself—if I can make it through this, I will not live life the same. But then you had to come back right when—”
“OK?” John asked, leaning back slightly to look into his detective’s eyes, but they were closed against the onslaught of sensation and emotion. “Hey, is this ok?” he repeated the question, running his thumbs over Sherlock’s, resisting the powerful pull to drag his lips against every inch of his friend’s long neck unless he was certain it was welcome. Sherlock finally opened his eyes and they were a tumultuous sea of desire and fear.
“To say you have a lot to process would be an understatement.” Sherlock sighed in response while John set two mugs out on the counter. “Is Mycroft getting some rest?”
“Nope, your turn. Truth,”  he interrupted. I ached with the pain of his honesty, but I  knew that we needed this debridement in order to heal. We had to complete what we had started on this strange winter night that had brought us together.
“…because you are everything to me.”
“Now, if you could write as well as you shoot…”
Sherlock looked at him defiantly.
Lestrade shrugged. “There aren’t any other consulting detectives. If we lost you then who would we have to annoy us at crime scenes?”
“God, is that what you think of me? Is that what you think I want? In all this time have you not figured it out?”
Sherlock’s gaze hardened even as he felt his muscles melting soft.
“You can’t tell me any more about what happened here?” Lestrade asked, irked by Sherlock’s demanding tone. “How did he die if it wasn’t the stab wound?”
John kissed Sherlock on the kitchen table and Sherlock responded wonderfully, melting into the kiss and wrapping his arms around him and holding him like he needed him.
"Well, that's all right, thank you for the dance. I think I see my nephew over there. Perhaps he'll be my next hostage." She winked at him.
John sighed, shutting his eyes. “And I know who he’ll tell it to first,” he said, pushing himself off the wall.
“Because the poison increases its effects exponentially. It starts slow, just a few basic symptoms of hypotension, which almost any otherwise healthy adult would ignore. It increases in very small increments. The victim doesn’t notice. And then BAM”—Sherlock slapped his hand down on the table—“he’s in shock. Confusion. Delirium. No time to call the ambulance. Dead.”
“You know I feel like we’ve been here before.”
“I need you to be awake…”
Settling on a decision, he tore himself away from John’s side and slipped back into his bed, prepared to feign sleep in an instant.
Sherlock had played many pieces for John from the
He began to play from memory. He knew some songs so well he could put his hands on autopilot, muscle memory freeing his mind to consider any problem undistracted. The piece was complex, the bowing fast and complicated, but he’d repeated it so often in youth the notes came to him instinctively.
“Is it possible Sherlock Holmes is hungry?”
John cleared his throat. "Well, we don't, er—"
John grinned despite his exhaustion. He was rarely able to surprise Sherlock and he had to appreciate the moment. He dropped his bags beside his armchair and flopped down into the seat. He drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair and looked curiously up at Sherlock. “Are you all right?”
Moriarty’s ideal employee. Moran had evidently proven himself worthy of controlling England’s drug trade in the master’s absence.
John slatted his eyes at his suddenly chipper flatmate. He did not like that tone on Sherlock one bit.
“Is negligible enough to discount.”
The bathroom door reopened and Sherlock's bedroom door slammed shut.
"No, John your
“Except the last one they were some of Karina’s regular clients,” she said. “I saw that last one once. He liked the knife too.” She rested the blade against John’s inner thigh. His military training had taught him not to squirm, and he didn’t.
John glanced over the words one more time. “It says you’re human. It says you’re allowed to love.” He shrugged, refolded the paper, and handed it back to Sherlock.
Sherlock was holding him like he was something important, precious even, and John hated that he was just understanding now, when it was too late.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
“That cabbie thinks we’re nutters,” John breathed.
But Sherlock was ready for it. “I always know what you think; it’s rarely interesting and usually to do with tea.”
Sherlock seemed to have the same idea because he pulled back and grabbed John’s wrist, dragging him along until John had recovered enough to keep pace as they made their way out of the park.
The dream had shown him everything. His subconscious fears…
Concentrate.
John reached to touch the scar, but his eyes darted to Sherlock’s face for confirmation. Sherlock was simply watching him. He didn’t say no. John lightly brushed over the spot on his chest. After just over a year the scar had flattened and faded. The ring was silvery white now. He remembered when it had been gushing red. He remembered Sherlock on his back, on the floor of Magnussen’s office—he blinked hard to shut out the image, but he couldn’t help the surge of hatred toward his ex-wife that coursed through him. It was smooth, youthful, unblemished skin torn open, ripped apart. It had healed well but it would never heal entirely. A beautiful body forever marred by
Mycroft opened his umbrella against the light raindrops as he exited the hospital.
“Why is it all so dull?” he demanded of it. “Human bodies are wondrously complex, but humans are idiots. Mindless work, mindless eating, mindless television..." He pulled his feet up onto the chair, hugging his knees to his chest. "Dull, dull... The average person is nowhere near as intelligent as his circulatory system. It's pathetic."
John leaned forward and Sherlock yielded, allowing John to solely support him, pushing him down into the grass. Lying fully on his back again Sherlock licked at John’s lips and John opened them, encouraging Sherlock’s tongue as it met and stroked his own. Sherlock slid his hands down John’s sides, and down over his hips to his thighs, playing for a moment with the hem of his shorts. John noted with interest Sherlock’s fingers moving around and over the tops of his socks, stroking the sides of his calves.
“Do you mind if I decide tomorrow morning? It’s not until 1.” Silently his friend nodded, his gaze affixed to the fire. “OK, I’m going to try to get some sleep. “ John placed his glass in the sink and Sherlock followed. “Thanks, Sherlock. Thank you for thinking of coming here, and sharing your family with me and with Rosie.” Sherlock locked the depths of his sea glass gaze on him and for a moment, he seemed to almost say something before changing his mind.
“Are we done?” I murmured into the hair behind his left ear.
“Would you, um—“ he broke off to clear his throat, his gaze focused on Rosie. “Um, watch her, I need a minute.” The scrape of his chair on the floor sliced through the sudden silence and he was on the staircase to his room before Sherlock could open his mouth to respond. Sherlock filled his lungs, swallowed some coffee and reached for the letter on the table. After his suspicions were confirmed, he thought for a moment. He wasn’t sure whether John would want time alone or whether he needed to talk. John was better at knowing these kinds of things than he was. His heart, however, compelled him to go to his friend. Rosie kicked her legs as he lifted her from her chair and scooped up her toast and baby food. He knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door and found her delighted to watch Rosie for a little while.
“You have a very valid point, Mr. Holmes. I may need to remain within arm’s reach for at least one night. If not more.” The flirtatious smirk slipped from the detective’s face as he whispered,
“I promise,” was all he could muster.
“Forevermore, “ he answered as their lips met.
“No, I’m glad you called me. I wasn’t really sleeping. I was just laying here…thinking. Trying to sleep. You’d think I’d be tired.”
“Yes. I wanted to be…..I wanted to be whole and healthy, in case you and Rosie…if you wanted….well, I just wanted to get sober and be there for you and Rosie, if you let me.”
“Nothing that concerns you, John,” Mycroft dismissed him. “Oughtn’t you put away the milk?” John glared at him, not moving a muscle. Mycroft continued the discussion as if he were no longer there,
“You can go ahead if you want, John, get back to work. I can meet you at home later.” John looked up surprised and concerned,
“Of course,” John said quickly “of course. Rosie and I are happy to have him. He’s always welcome here.”
“Christ, your toes are so cold, we’re going to have to check for frostbite in the morning!” John exclaimed in a loud whisper. He slid his leg between mine, sandwiching my feet between his own in an attempt to provide warmth to every inch of my freezing skin. “We’re staying this way until you stop shivering,” said John, managing to infuse his authoritative doctor tone into a whisper. I hummed my assent into the nape of the doctor’s neck. I would be content to remain in this position for eternity. “Were you up, out of bed? How did you get so cold?” I was reticent to tell John about the dream, about waking shivering on the floor. I had the dreams mostly under control and didn’t need to worry John with them. He accepted my silence and the hypnotic sensations of our synced breathing and shared body heat lulled us back into slumber. My last lingering thought was that I would have sabotaged the heater many winters ago had I known this would be the result…
“Sherlock, come on, come to bed,” he said gently, touching his arm. Sherlock moaned in reply. Gently, John pulled him up, supporting him around his waist and taking him to his bedroom.
“I never expected to be anyone’s husband,“ nearly echoing his own words from long ago. John grinned,
“I don’t know what to do with this, John. It’s telling me that I just need one hit. That’s it, I can stop after one. But I know I won’t. And I can’t, I can’t use, I can’t lose you and Rosie again.”
“You can lay her down if she’s asleep,” he murmured. Sherlock hummed and placed her gently on her back in her crib. He followed John back to the couch, where John had poured the last drops of the wine into their glasses and placed them on the coffee table in front of them. The doctor looked at his friend from the side, and somewhat hesitantly asked,
Cold, cold, cold, bitter, freezing, icy cold snuck into the cracks between my gloves and my sleeves, penetrating my skin, my blood, my bones. The stench of stale hay and manure saturated my matted hair and filthy clothing. I had been here three nights waiting for the man to return to this god-forsaken abandoned barn in this god-forsaken frozen wasteland of a country. My breath was suspended in frozen clouds before me and I wasn’t even certain I could pull the trigger of my weapon should the cretin ever turn up again. My fingers throbbed and my toes were completely numb. I closed my eyes and drifted to Baker Street, sitting by a warm, glowing fire with John….John…Christ, I miss John….no, I can’t go there or I’ll be lost. I can’t be distracted by sentiment, I have to remain alert….
“I don’t know how to incorporate this new knowledge, this whole experience, to catalogue everything and integrate it. I don’t know how to make this part of my history and part of me.” His voice shook, like his hands in his hair, interlaced behind his head which hung low. “Everything was a lie and everything I’ve become, everything I am is a fabrication, layers and layers of false defenses without substance, without a foundation. A shell. I don’t know who I am anymore, John.” His breath came in staccato bursts and his shoulders started to shake. John could no more resist the impulse to take him in his arms than he could stop his own heart from beating.
Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, spattering the hard stone floor with a chaos of color. The church was only about half full of mourners, but spilling over with grief. There was a preponderance of military uniforms in attendance, in combination with family and friends. The sight of the man’s wife and young children was more than most could withstand, precipitating sobs from some and the subtle throat clearing/eye swipe maneuver of those unaccustomed to openly grieving. After the service and eulogy, the group proceeded to the gravesite. When the wife tossed her handful of soil onto the casket, John’s shoulders stuttered and he turned toward Sherlock, whose hand came up to gently grasp his arm, as John subtly hid his tear streaked face in the shadow of his friend. At the end, John moved slowly through the group, talking quietly with former comrades, and finally expressing his condolences to the family. As people began to slowly peel off from the group and depart, John began a slow walk away from the car. Sherlock paused,
“I—we….I don’t want to mess this up, y’know? Because it’s us, and without us, I have—I have nothing. I mean… you know that I love you, right? You must’ve deduced that by now. You are a genius, after all.” Sherlock’s world stopped. His brain stopped processing outside stimuli and was consumed with only one thought. John Watson loved him. John Watson loved HIM. He stared so long that they nearly missed the walk signal. A few people moved impatiently past them and John began to feel quite awkward and more than a little panicky. “It’s ok, I mean, if it’s too much or too soon to say something like that, you don’t have to feel the same way, I just—” Sherlock suddenly grabbed his hand, dragged him across the street at the last moment and doubled their pace. They were approaching 221B. “OK,” muttered John.  A few minutes later, after nervously fishing in his pocket, John was attempting to insert the key with shaky fingers when the detective suddenly wrapped his arms tightly around his waist from behind, burying his face in his neck and humming out a sigh. John reached back with his free hand, cupping the back of Sherlock’s neck, keeping him close as he released a relieved breath and said, “So you’re not mad, then? I was afraid—“.
The glowing red numbers assaulted John’s eyes, declaring that it was 2:16am when something had him clawing from the edges of consciousness. He opened his eyes and immediately checked the crib, but found Rosie sound asleep. He also found Sherlock’s bent form sitting at the edge of his bed. Slanted lines of street light slithering in between the blinds shingled his back. John cleared his throat before croaking,
“Yes, “ he said, in an octave lower than usual, that raised chills. “The answer has always been yes. Always.” John’s breath came quick and heavy.
“Truth or truth. I told a truth, now it’s your turn,” John responded matter-of-factly, as if this was a common occurrence between flatmates sharing a bed in the dead of night. I smiled again and said teasingly,
“Let’s not waste any more,” he murmured in between tasting John’s upper lip and his lower lip, between breathing in his scent and exhaling years of need, between reining in his desperate rush and savoring the sensation of John’s stubble against his cheek. John’s arms slipped around the taller man’s neck, losing himself in moist heat, the taste of tea and safety. Moments later, he reluctantly leaned away and pulled back for oxygen.
“This is ridiculous. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m so—“ Sherlock began.
“I haven’t been very hungry,” he admitted.
Dinner was a casual, friendly affair with a great deal of conversation that morphed into lively debate over everything from politics to physics. Sherlock seemed more relaxed than was typical for him in the company of his family. John wasn’t sure whether it was related to Mycroft’s absence or the general sense of security that they seemed to share of late. Whatever the cause, John concluded that this had been a good idea. It was offering him both distraction from his sadness and comfort from a sense of family. He actually felt content by the time Rosie was fast asleep and Sherlock’s parents had also retired to their room. He sat by the fire with Sherlock, sipping whiskey, his thoughts unusually empty. Sherlock broke the silence,
“And I never thought I’d have a husband. Life is funny like that. The things you don’t expect, the things you were never looking for, turn out to be the best things in your life.”
“I can wait for you at the car if you’d like some time to yourself.” His friend whirled around, displaced anger distorted his features.
“OK.” He took a fortifying breath. “After that, I’m going to Baker Street. Mycroft said it’ll be declared structurally sound so that we…I…can go through the rubble and see if anything can be salvaged.”
“I’m glad you weren’t,“ he said somewhat harshly, his sharp gaze grazing the shadowed planes of John’s face.  “I was captured many times, tortured, beaten, left to die. I was so alone for so very long.” He trailed off, lost in a memory just over John’s left shoulder, the desolate look on his face gnawed at John’s gut.
“You beat me to it.” John said, seemingly apropos of nothing.
“Not very long. I must’ve woken you when I got out of bed, I’m sorry. John, I….” he couldn’t find the words to articulate his thoughts. “I…I want to be a part of her life, and yours. A permanent part. Always.” Sherlock looked apprehensively at the doctor. John was slightly taken aback by the anxiety he saw in his friend’s eyes, but given his own behavior lately, he understood Sherlock’s insecurity.
“John, I may have a concussion. I’ll need close monitoring. Throughout the night, probably.   You may have to stay close, doctor.” A sparkle-twinkle lit his gaze as an answering grin spread across his doctor’s face.
“Are things OK? Were you texting Mycroft?” Sherlock smiled at him,
“Yeah, I think that’s enough,” John responded with a soft chuckle against my chest.
“No, but I’ve never seen this genius do it before.” Sherlock picked Rosie back up and headed toward the door,
“Thanks.”
“Sherlock, are you alright?” Sherlock didn’t look up at him, his gaze distracted and distant as he murmured.
“When we were kids, Harry and I used to play truth or dare. As we got older, our dares became so reckless that mom said we were only allowed to play truth or truth. Besides, I figure that you and I have completed a lifetime’s worth of dares in a decade, anyway. But we have a significant deficit of truths between us.” Blue-green eyes flash bright enough to see in the pitch dark. A deficit. An accurate word chosen by a physician. I hesitated and the cold, dark room waited to hold our secrets in suspended animation.
“You too. Good night, Sherlock.”
“Yes, Dr. John Watson, now where is he?” She directed him to Room 9, where he arrived to find Lestrade at the door, texting furiously.
“John, I’m ok. It’s not Greg’s fault.” John’s head swiveled around to meet his friend’s gaze, unaware that Sherlock had risen and was now sitting up behind him on the bed. He felt shot through with building-heat-rage, but something he saw in the detective’s eyes gave him pause. He slowly took a deep breath with a long exhale, very deliberately relaxed his hands. He looked into the floor when he cleared his throat and said quietly,
“I doesn’t take a genius to change a nappy, John.” The doctor laughed,
“If?” he prompted gently.
“Yes, Sherlock, yes.” John quickly replied, having the advantage of having two working hands to run over Sherlock’s face and into his hair as he peppered his high cheekbones and jaw with kisses between words. “A thousand times, a million times, all the time, for as long as I can remember. Never doubt that.” Relief filtered through the detective and he pulled John impossibly closer with his one functional arm.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said suddenly, stopping his friend in his tracks. “For dinner. “
“Yeah, of course, Sherlock. Always. You’re her Godfather, my closest friend. That’s what I want, too. Why are you thinking about this?”
“I don’t know,” he murmured, sounding lost. “I need something real to hold onto. Something steadfast that I can count on. I feel untethered, even my memories are unreliable. My mind palace is susceptible to corruption, John. What isn’t? What in life…in my life, can’t be corrupted?”
“Yes. After this.” The tension I felt in his body escalated my own. My heart was beating so wildly inside my chest that it could have cracked John’s rib where it pressed against mine. I anxiously awaited his answer. I knew what I wanted—I desperately wanted more.  Yet, even more desperately, I didn’t want to lose John for it. My arms squeezed him more tightly of their own accord—in anticipation of the potential loss of the most important thing in my life.
“We should have a housewarming party,” John suggested. Sherlock was thankful for the change of topic. He cleared his throat.
He approached slowly, hesitantly, and knocked gently against the wood before easing the door of John’s room open. John was clutching old photo album, slowly turning the pages with a faraway look. Sherlock sat beside him on the bed.
“Mmm hmm.” Sherlock absorbed this, blinked quickly and swallowed. “The rest of your life?” John nodded again, feeling as if he was standing on the precipice of the rest of his life.
The week trudged on, filled with surgery shifts for John and settling back in for Sherlock. John stopped by Baker Street a couple of times to check on the progress. It somehow looked remarkably the same—Sherlock (often after soliciting John’s opinion) had chosen much the same furniture and décor. Unbeknownst to John, Sherlock had also added a new feature to the upstairs bedroom--in addition to the bed that would be John’s (should he choose to stay over now and then), he had placed a crib. With Anthea’s help, he had also bought a box of diapers, a diaper pail and wipes. He was barely able to wrap his head around the notion that he had purchased baby items for Baker Street, but he was eager to make staying at Baker Street easy for John and Rosie. He wanted them to feel at home. John had vaulted up the stairs to see his room before Sherlock had a chance to mention any of this to him. Sherlock’s stomach clenched—what if it had been too presumptuous? But when John returned, the broad smile on his face was all the evidence Sherlock needed to know that the effort had been appreciated and well worth it. When John finished making tea, he handed the cup to Sherlock, their fingers momentarily overlapping, leaving Sherlock’s tingling.
“Oh, God, yes.” John pressed their lips together as Sherlock softly moaned into his mouth. The detective’s hands slid up to cradle John’s face and he pressed the length of his body against his doctor’s. Their lips moved gently, opening, softening, easing, permitting, inviting, growing, building. Heat engulfed them as their breath quickened and their kiss took on a new meaning and destination. Sherlock discovered an actual need for oxygen and pulled ever-so-slightly away, hands still wrapped around John’s skull and his waist. His eyes remained closed, foreheads pressed together as he caught his breath.
The sharp morning chill was defenseless against their combined heat beneath the duvet. John slowly filled his lungs with Sherlock scented air and felt moist breath against the back of his neck. He lay close, but not touching. Close enough to know he wasn’t alone, but not close enough to lead to a possibly premature discussion. John turned onto his back and tenderly observed the sleeping detective. Sherlock looked younger in the relaxed lull of sleep. The thought crossed his mind that he felt more comfortable waking next to his friend than he had his wife—but the thought was immediately washed away with a brief wave of guilt. Sherlock, perceptive even in his sleep, slowly opened his eyes to find John’s gaze on him. In a rare, unguarded moment, he smiled a slow, lazy, genuine smile at his doctor. It would have been impossible not to return it, though John didn’t even try to resist. Nor did he try to explain the rays of sunshine that seemed to come from his own chest, radiating heat to every extremity.
“Yes, I’m ok, John, I’m right here,” his voice was now soft and a little broken. “Nightmare?”  Despite his monumental efforts, the doctor was unable to alter the typical progression of his nightmare resolution. They always ended with tears. Always. He was powerless to prevent it.
“There is nothing—“ Sherlock’s words rumbled into his mouth “—to be sorry for.” And he continued to delve again and again into the doctor’s mouth, tangling their tongues, learning the inside of his mouth, grasping the back of his skull with his long, pale fingers, sending white-hot bolts of electricity down John’s sternum, straight to his core, leaving him breathless-gasping and devoid of reason. Finally, remembering where they were, John pulled back just a hair.
“Yes, I’m just….” John tugged his hand. “Let’s walk home. I think better when I’m moving.” Sherlock’s lips quirked up and John left his fingers tangled gently in his detective’s as they slowly walked toward the edge of the green lawn, to where the bustling sidewalk would take them back to Baker Street.
“But,” Sherlock stammered uncharacteristically at the doorway of John’s bedroom, “this is….was…your bed with Mary, John. It’s not my place,“ he looked down as he said the words.
“Holmes, Sherlock Holmes, where is he?” She looked up at him, who-do-you-think-you-are indignant, but then her shuttered face abruptly broke into an incongruous smile, obviously recognizing him.
Happy babbles filtered through the baby monitor, drawing John to wakefulness. He yawned into a smile, feeling his arm still clutched to his flatmate’s chest as inky black curls tickled his nose. He leaned away to glance at the time, the numbers on the clock faded in the full morning sunlight. By some miracle, Rosie had allowed them extra sleep this morning.
At breakfast, Sherlock tipped a spoon of peaches into Rosie’s mouth with one hand while he perused the paper with the other. John went about making toast and coffee.
“Truer words have never been spoken.”
Eventually the dark times came, as they always had, but less intense--sometimes a few hours, sometimes a few days, but they were shared and assuaged with tea and warm-feet-afternoon-naps and whiskey-before-the-fire evenings, telly-on-the-couch nights, and silent walks, arms gently bumping. The heat and sunlight of family (toast in triangles and toddler size jumpers in the laundry) seeped into the corners of his Mind Palace and illuminated them, sweeping away the cobwebbed crusty bit-not-good thoughts. The cases came too, as they always do, but they were not the wild jumping-between-rooftops, narrowly-escaping-knives kinds of cases, but the less intense, solving-the-crime-using-deduction-think, John, think! kinds of cases, solved from the living room walls spattered with pictures and stringed thumb tacks. Some crime scenes were visited but more often images were sent and viewed on laptops to the soft background clicks and clacks of children’s toys or the soft hum of children’s shows. A year of contentment glowed beneath Sherlock’s normal pallor and warmed John’s gaze, softening the angles of the doctor’s face and the sharp edges of the prior year. There was no time for dating between the Friday-evening-take-away-curry and Angelo’s super-special-Saturday-spaghetti made with care for his favorite little detective. No time between surgery shifts and late-night-cases. And John didn’t miss it. He didn’t miss awkward first questions and fumbling first kisses. He didn’t miss long evenings spent tolerating dull conversation while wondering if Sherlock was running about in alleys, risking his life without his conductor of light. He now touched Sherlock often and softly and the more he did it, the more he wanted to do it. Thoughts had begun to flit through his mind—of leaning into him on the couch, of the nape of his neck bent over the microscope, of the errant curl over his left eye. They came unbidden, but not necessarily unfamiliar or unwelcome. John hadn’t quite decided what to do with them yet. They were distracting, in a pleasant, day-dreamy way, not a panicky way. For now, he was sitting with them. Holding them.
The tantalizing aromas of a fry-up and coffee drew the detective from his slumber and into the kitchen. Rosie was happily shoving eggs around on her plate in her high chair while her father was just plating their breakfasts. He turned from the stove, with the plates in hand and stopped short with a warm smile for the sleep-mussed detective leaning against the doorway.
Hours later, they created a surprisingly domestic tableau in John’s house. They sat at the dinner table, laughing as they tried to get Rosie to ingest more pasta than she projected. Dinner had been relaxed, as they talked about how Sherlock’s conversation went with Molly. As John had predicted, though she had been very hurt, Molly was forgiving. It would take time for things to get back to normal between them, but they had started down the road to recovery. Sherlock was immensely relieved and grateful. He valued their friendship more than he could express to her. He and John were finishing a bottle of wine as John took Rosie to the bath. When he passed through living room again, Sherlock was intently texting with a frown.
“I did sign up for this. I signed up for it the day you walked into the lab at Bart’s. I signed up for anything and everything that involves being a part of your life. It’s an honor to help you raise your daughter, John Watson.” He had drifted closer to John, their hands linked again. They stood at the edge of the park, in view of the busy street, but John didn’t see anything but the heat in Sherlock’s gaze. He didn’t hear anything but the low timbre of his voice. “And if there’s anything else you want from me, it’s yours. Anything. All that I am, all that I have is already yours.” John forgot how to breathe, filled with awe and fear. How did he deserve the love of this amazing man?
When John woke from a deep, and miraculously dreamless sleep, their backs were pressed against one another. He felt the warmth of his friend against him, his ribs moving with deep even breaths. He felt affection move through him like a tidal wave. He wasn’t sure what was happening to him. All he knew was that he had witnessed an astounding amount of kindness, bravery and humanity yesterday and it had left him in absolute awe of his best friend. Sherlock had changed since his return from the dead over a year ago. He had matured as a friend, as a brother, as a human being. He was more honest with his emotions, more giving, more accepting and more generous with his care. It was John himself who had been childish and reactionary of late, displacing his anger at himself onto all the wrong people. The events of yesterday were clear evidence that John needed to make some changes in himself in order to be worthy of this man’s friendship. He didn’t want to wake him, but he needed to hold him. The urge was irrepressible. He turned over and fit himself against Sherlock’s back, slipping an arm over his waist. Sherlock stirred, settling back against his friend, covering John’s arm with his own, and returned to snoring. John, too, drifted back to sleep.
I pushed myself to standing, shivering so hard that walking to the thermostat was arduous. I glared at the indicator, tapping on it, as if that would alter the reading. It couldn’t possibly be that cold in the flat!  I flicked the switch on and off aggressively, to no avail. The heater was broken on the coldest night of the year.
“Oh, good, thank you. Christ, I hope they can come tomorrow to fix it. Otherwise we’ll all have to sleep in the sitting room with a fire.” John propped himself up on his elbow and scrutinized me in the dim light. “Sherlock you’re shivering so hard you’re going to break your teeth. You have no body fat. Go get the blanket from your bed and come up here.” That was an offer I could not refuse. I hurried downstairs and returned immediately to spread the blanket from my bed over John’s. Doubt, however, gave me pause….John really wanted to share his bed with me? I wanted nothing more in the world than to share warmth and sleep next to this man, but—
“Hm?”
“Mycroft,“ the doctor warned, his anxiety growing exponentially with each passing second.
“Any time, Sherlock. Every time. Please come to me every time you have an urge to use. Promise me.” John’s gaze held a passionate insistence that was reinforced with his hand on Sherlock’s bicep. A warmth filled Sherlock, tingling in his stomach to his to his fingertips and he swallowed audibly. He didn’t know how much longer he could go without telling this man just how much he meant to him. He was certain that he was already telling him with his eyes—he could only hope that John was even less observant than usual at 3:30am.
“I’ll never smoke another cigarette again,” A bubble of laughter escaped from John and tightened his embrace.
“I—“ the detective started, pausing to clear his throat, and starting again, roughly. “I’ve had dreams since I came back.” John waited. The silence was pregnant, but he refrained from prompting the detective. “When I was gone, I….I experienced many things. I was….tortured. Beaten. Starved.” The doctor unintentionally grasped his hand more tightly and turned to meet Sherlock’s gaze. “The worst was…” he turned his gaze to the window, sighing deeply.
“I missed you. I missed you *so* much when I was gone,” I finally whispered in a tremulous yet emphatic voice. “I know that I had the very unfair advantage of knowing that you were alive, but it still hurt so deeply to miss you every minute of every day. I didn’t expect that. I had never cared about anyone before, so I vastly underestimated how painful it was going to be. It hurt more than the bitterly cold nights, more than the knife wounds, more than the hunger, more than the lashes on my back. It was…one of several major miscalculations on my part. ” The click of my swallow echoed in the thick silence of the room into which neither of us dared to breathe. “Truth,” I demanded with a sudden exhale.
“Thank you,“ he said, in relief. “It feels more manageable now.”
“Good,“ he seemed to need to absorb the information. “I thought I was taking a risk there, but I couldn’t stop. Not after so long. We will continue this at Baker Street, then?” John’s smile lit his face like the sun and he nodded.
“Seriously, John? They already think we are in a romantic relationship. We live together with your daughter. We stayed in the same room last night.” Sherlock’s familiar acerbic tone soothed John’s anxiety. The logic of his statements was irrefutable.
“I’m sorry.”
“Yes, I was thinking we would stay tonight.” John knew that wasn’t what exactly what Sherlock had been suggesting, but he was so thrown off by his physiological response (because that’s all it was, right?) to Sherlock that he went for the easier answer. “Thai?”
Relief flooded through Sherlock as he clutched his friend to his chest, once again. They remained there for a few more moments before John pulled away, sniffling with a gentle laugh.
“I know, Sherlock. I know we both miss her. It was never your fault--”
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice heavy with some unnamed emotion. “I talked to you, too. All the time. I heard you, I even saw you in crowds, on the tube. I thought I might be going mental. Other people thought I might be going mental,” his eyes closed against unbidden and unwanted memories of pain that haunted him still.
John wasn’t certain what woke him in the pre-dawn hours. The bed felt empty and his hand met cold sheets where Sherlock had lain. A twinge of anxiety crept into his chest as he grabbed his robe and left the room. After quickly surveying the living room and then peeking out the front window to see if he had stepped out for a smoke, John’s fear was skyrocketing. Then, he remembered the final room he had yet to check. The door to Rosie’s room was ajar and Sherlock sat in the rocking chair next to her crib. He was gazing softly at John’s daughter, looking up slowly when John walked in. The expression in his friend’s eyes was unfathomable.
“No, no, that’s not it, we’re fine,” John read the fear on his features and quickly reassured him. He slid closer to Sherlock, taking his hand, and chastised himself for allowing his love to experience the discomfort of that uncertainty. Especially since his very goal tonight was to remove all uncertainty.
“Hey,” he said, touching Sherlock’s arm, grounding him in the present. Sherlock shook his head, clearing cobwebbed memories, finding John’s eyes again. He had never spoken to anyone of that time and he spoke now with an undercurrent of urgency,
“What don’t you know, Sherlock?” Sherlock sighed deeply and looked toward the door of his bedroom, face written with apprehension. Realization dawned on the doctor and with it came a wave of sadness. Sherlock now associated his bed with nightmares, with fear and negative experiences. John knew the feeling well and it was horrible. It was awful when the one place where you were supposed to feel secure enough to relax became aversive—when the thought of entering your own bedroom and laying in your bed made your palms slick and your stomach churn with dread. Sometimes sunset alone triggered anticipatory anxiety. He knew exactly what Sherlock was experiencing.
The next evening, after fetching a suitcase of clothing for himself and Rosie, John was back at Baker Street, standing in the kitchen, stirring sizzling meat while Rosie played with plastic cups on the floor.
“Can’t sleep, either, then?” Unsurprisingly, Sherlock didn’t answer, didn’t look up, head still tucked into his arms which were wrapped around his knees, impossibly flexible for a grown man.
“You’re going to be cold, Sherlock.”
“If you had come back earlier….if I hadn’t been so far into it with Mary….” John leaves his sentence unfinished. His eyes find mine in the dark, and I can read the regret despite the lack of light and the passage of time.
“First for everything.”  He leaned forward, elbows on knees, his head in his hands, rubbing aggressively at his temples and scalp. “I just don’t know how to do it.” His tone betrayed his mental agony.
“Thank you,” he whispered. John gazed unabashedly at his friend’s features, his hand still in the detective’s.
“Hey,” John said, working to catch his friend’s gaze. “I’ll be with you. Let’s go lay down together. Maybe it’ll help.” The detective’s relief was apparent and he turned away as his eyes filled. John stood, grasping the man’s hand and pulling him up. They stumble-walked into Sherlock’s room and collapsed on the bed. John situated himself on his side, facing his friend who stared anxiously at the ceiling and agitatedly pulled at his own hair with one hand.
“Alright,“ he said cautiously, catching up with the ex-soldier. Slowly, they walked the perimeter of the graveyard while John took deep breaths.
“What happened today?” The detective sighed, his dark curls dropping low on his forehead. Filtered light from the street lit half his face, the other half in shadow.
“Yeah,“ he finally muttered. “I have to.” Sherlock felt his indecision, his reluctance, overpowered by his sense of duty and obligation.
“Sherlock, I don’t know how to do this. I’ve never had this with a man before, I don’t know that I’ve ever had a healthy relationship with anyone before—” Sherlock once again stopped his speech once again, this time by leaning in, slowly inhaling his doctor’s scent as he whispered against the shell of his ear,
“Our first kiss? You thought about it?”
“Nothing helps.” He said despondently. “I don’t want sedatives. I’m actually trying to stay sober, John. I don’t know what to do. I just need to shut down my hard drive.”
“She’s still with her sister until the renovations are complete. Mycroft said that would take about a week.”
“I’m okay now, I can go back—“ but John chose that moment to tighten his grasp and move his thumb gently over his friend’s skin.
“Who is it?” He asked, knowing that one of the young men in fatigues, smiling at the camera, was no more.
“I know. You’ve apologized, I accepted, we’ve been over this. But it’s just coming back now because I’m going to a funeral again. God, I hated standing at your grave and yet I kept going back because I just wanted to talk with you. It’s all I wanted, more than anything, just to talk with you one more time.” Sherlock’s heart ached and he swallowed a knot down from his throat into his chest, making it hard to breath. John felt his friend’s breath catching. He turned in his arms, facing him. “I’m sorry. It’s over, I’m not trying to make you feel guilty about it. I’m just…it’s the funeral. It’s bringing it all back.”
He rushed into the A&E, barking at the woman in white behind the desk,
“I’ll help with that,” John interjected. “Give them to me and I’ll administer them. I’m a physician and his….his flatmate. I won’t let him overuse them” The doctor nodded, handing the prescription to John and bidding them farewell.
“Why would I ask you to come if I wanted to be by myself, Sherlock? I want you with me. I always want you with me.” John’s tone was cold and sharp and Sherlock froze. The doctor’s affect was at complete odds with his words and Sherlock wasn’t sure which to heed.
“Sherlock, you can always wake me. I’m glad you came to me,” John said, as he ran a hand over the detective’s back, noting his freshly damp and clean smelling T-shirt. He must have taken a shower to try to temper the urges. When Sherlock finally looked up, his eyes were wet with unshed tears,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Yes, fine.” John could see that things were by no means fine.
“The rest of our lives,” he said, his smile growing wider. “So it was kind of a proposal?”
“Alright, yes, it’s a proposal. I had no intention of proposing to you 5 minutes ago, but that doesn’t make any less sincere. Because there’s nothing I want more. Just you and me and Rosie until the end of our days.”
“No, stay here. I think she’ll be fine with the extra blanket. If she’s too cold she will wake up and tell us about it. Come here, come closer. “ John pulled me tightly against him, pressing his back into my chest. My body craved his on so many levels and my heart fluttered as I struggled to keep my thoughts pure.
“Good.” John’s eyelids drifted shut while his hand remained affixed to Sherlock’s arm. The detective whispered,
“We can’t?” Sherlock looked perplexed and John laughed.
“Does this feel right?” His voice was barely audible, his breath puffed gently against John’s lips.
Sherlock was the next to wake, mid-morning light shafting through the blinds. He felt the heat against his back and the arm anchoring him. His breathing quickened with the awareness that John had either consciously or unconsciously pulled him close and he smiled into the pillow. Knowing the tumult that the next days were going to bring, he took this moment for himself. He shored up the strength and stability that John gave him and coveted it away for the coming days. He was able to stave off the chaos of his thoughts for another few minutes and breath in John’s scent, to allow it to permeate his thoughts like curls of smoke, drifting around and through, obscuring his pain. Now, feeling at least somewhat fortified, he pulled away from John and climbed out of bed to face his demons.
Sherlock was lying on his side, arm wrapped around John’s neck from behind. He grunted trying to control John’s flailing, which slowed after a moment, and Sherlock was alarmed when John suddenly went limp in his arms.
He risked a glance upward but John’s expression, for once, was unreadable.
“How could you possibly be interrupting anything?” Sherlock wanted to know. “Our time is entirely occupied by trivia. We do nothing but wait in anticipation for your intrusions.”
He looked back toward the living room. He would have liked to at least change into his pyjama trousers first, but Sherlock didn’t seem interested in letting go of his arm. John sighed inwardly. In truth he was exhausted, and flopping down into bed—any bed—didn’t seem like such a bad idea.
“David Rodgers: Death by poison. Dragged to an alley and stabbed postmortem as a cover-up. Neil Parker: Death by poison. Shot in his own flat postmortem and burglary staged as a cover-up. But these two…” He tapped the pictures of Brandon Riley and Amy Elliot. “They break the pattern in more ways than one. They died only days after receiving the poison. The poison was allowed to run its course in the other cases, killing the victims in about two weeks’ time. Why were these two killed prematurely?”
