"Well, thank you, dear boy. You know, I did once dream of doing so. Once my father passed, I took up the Mantle and continue running the Addison Apartments." he replied.
Dean had only taken a bite from it before spitting it out into a napkin, "You guys know I'll eat pretty much anything, but this? Ugh. It smells rancid and tastes worse."
Garth wrote something down and nodded at the orderlies, signaling that they had finished their session. They came in, ushering Dean to his room, where Dean lay down, awake for the rest of the day thinking about what he would tell Sam and coming up blank.
Dean turned to him "As far as I know, yeah. According to the 5'0 he'd have to plead guilty, anyway. They had caught him in the act. I'm supposed to testify against him, it'll be my first time out in a while"
"Wait!", called Cas, but it was already too late, Ben had already disappeared into the floor. "Fuck!" Cas yelled.
Dean sighed and agreed, knowing that if Cas didn't berate him, Bobby would- for not being thorough. They both traced the walls with their hands, searching for any hidden switch or something. They found nothing until Cas tried to move the hands on the clock and they quickly flew back to 3:14. Dean wasn't sure what to do with that, so he kept walking around, trying to find an answer.
"Score! Now Cas'll see Ben for sure!" He celebrated.
Cas gently shoved him, exclaiming, "Hey, I heard that! No murder, Dean."
"Little one, I admire your world view. But that's just how things are." She let go and went back to rocking back and forth- this time starting past Dean- at nothing.
Almost immediately, Ben materialized.
"I'm sorry, daddy. I just- I lost and I-I," Ben started crying, wiping at his eyes with his hands.
"Look, if you won't tell me why you were crying, can you at least tell me why you hate me? I have done nothing to you, but it's day after day, man." Dean’d be lying if he said he wasn't curious.
"A dark place."
"Y'know, I don't actually think you're a bad guy. Just someone who's afraid to be himself." Dean sighed before continuing, "look, dude, I don't normally offer this- but if you ever need to talk or get away, you can come hang out with me. I won't judge you."
Dean didn't know if it was alive, but he doubted it.  Its nose and mouth were in the water and bubbles weren't coming. It didn't speak, just kind of stared off in space.He looked closely and noticed maggots crawling between the stomach rolls it now had with ease, and flies buzzed loudly around its head. The wings had completely fallen off and were now just the skeletal structure. He was glad it got the water it so desperately needed, but it hurt to see it like this. It reminded Dean of someone he knew, but he couldn't quite put his finger on who.
"Hi-ya, Dee." He greeting
The cut scene ended and took Dean back to the level selection menu. He selected the second one. It read:
"You're seriously telling me you don't remember the last few seconds? The glitching and explosion of light from your computer?" he asked, incredulous.
She didn't answer him, but rubbed her hands over her crystal ball and transported him to a blank paper. There was nothing- no one around that he could see. Even the familiar sounds of the last place faded away. It was just him and this space here. He walked forward again, not knowing what to expect.
It startled Dean when the stall opened to Crowley. His eyes were red-rimmed and his nose looked like he’d rubbed it raw. He was looking down, and his posture seemed that of someone who felt ashamed, "Thank you, S-Dean. I-uh, found this on your desk." He handed Dean an envelope with his name on it. Inside was a journal page. "I had been planning on binning it, but.... Look.-"
"Od to what wonk lliw uoy. emit ni delaever eb lliw gnihtyreve." the mysterious voice replied before Dean promptly blacked out, again.
"But I-I," She looked close to tears, thankfully the lights started flickering, a man came up from the toilet. The same way Ben did last time he'd appeared to Dean- first muscles, then skin. He was a tall, red-headed woman. She was crying- near nonstop, definitely more than Ben had been.
"I thought we were friends, Dean. But you did it. You touched my ponies."  As he spoke, he dragged down the zipper holding his skin together. Suddenly, though, a skeleton with bright yellow eyes sat where he had been.
Sam shrugged, taking a bite of his salad. "I tried. He wouldn't tell me. Said it was your story to tell. Oh, but he asked me to tell you that Charlie is still the same through I have no clue what that means. Who's Charlie?"
It tried talking to him, but he didn't understand. Coming through with poor reception. He told the head so, but it kept trying before it ultimately disappeared. "That was weird," he said to himself. "But then again, so is my life."
"Blank paper?" said another
Mrs. Carrigan stood at the front of the room, her voice sickly sweet. "That doesn't look like math work to me, Mr. Winchester.”
"There is, a catch though," Gath said hesitantly, "They want you to treat it like a normal session. Talk to him about you life in the apartments. I'm to sit in and monitor and only interfere if you become volatile again."
"Sure, Cas. I'll see what I can do. Why don't you head back home and take a moment to process? This has to be overwhelming." Dean didn't know if he was doing the right thing, but he wanted to try. Cas nodded, and they went their separate ways.
Well, Dean got his answer. He took the ladder leading down. And saw a stick woman without her body. She was crying heavily.
Dean selected the last unlocked level, Chapter 8, and the text read, "After learning what Sean had a hand in, Mrs. Mills reached out to a friend for help. They would meet up later that night."
As he walked up, it unfolded to reveal a heavily detailed elder. She held a crystal ball in both her hands, as if cradling it. He'd never met her before- he was sure of it, and yet she felt familiar all the same. "Are you the prophet?" He asked.
Excited by the warning Castiel let go of the man’s cock and reached around with both hands to dig his nails into the meat of Dean’s ass where his pants had slid down, and held him in place. The pain must have been the trigger because the next thing he knew Dean was spilling heavily down his throat with a shout that he just managed to cut off and turn into rough ragged, choked off grunts. It was a good thing he was mentally ready to swallow because the teasing dribbles he had gotten was nothing compared to the full load he got.
“Ohh…” Dean moaned, dropping a hand to drag it through his hair urging him on.
“Blue reminds me of you,” Dean said quietly, his voice startling him from the captivating view.
Hope you enjoy my gracelings <3
“Was the mouse worth it?” Castiel asked Zazzles seriously, and the dog leaned forward trying to lick his face which he took as a yes. Huskies and their play drive he chuckled inwardly.
“This is Seraph,” Castiel told him, gesturing towards one of the medium sized kennels that held a scrawny black cat they guessed to be about two years old, and her fresh litter of kittens. “She only came in about a week ago. Very pregnant at the time as you can tell.”
Enjoy my little gracelings <3 extra love to my friends/supporters encouraging me along the way :)
Watching as Dean rocked back and forth on his heels, Castiel shrugged off his lab coat. The coat wasn’t something required of the job, but it reminded him of his trenchcoat, and he enjoyed the familiarity of it. It gave him time to note the man’s nervous habit, and the awkward stiffness in his body language. Was he still that uncomfortable around him despite all their lighthearted and playful texting?
“Boy! Did you hear me? Get your butt in gear! That young man can wait,” Missouri chastised him loudly, peeking around the corner. “Rosie is here, and that litter of pups ready for their shots arrived early. You’re lucky it’s lunch time. I told them you were finishing up the sandwich you never actually brought.”
Is this also where I tell you I finally have an outline, and it's roughly guesstimated to end up an 111k and 37 chapter fic? Oopsies?
“Shuddup,” Dean mumbled back at him defeatedly.
“Hell yeah it will,” he said, and Castiel couldn’t practically see the man’s hair standing up on his arms, if the hard twitch of his cock hadn’t been a dead give away to his excitement.
With all that being said....
Bingo Square: Karaoke
Dean = PinkSoliderBoyTwink
“Nice clinic you got here Cas,” Dean nodded approvingly looking around the waiting area.
Hopefully the good stuff lives up to the hype many of you praised me for in that regarding sexting/dirty talk. -cringe- Still not 100% confident in my abilities, however I sure as fuck had fun writing that bit! Both boys are guilty of being incredibly naughty......I'm looking at you this time Cas LMAO
Taking himself in his hand Dean stared at the picture intently, licking his lips and reading over the person’s words again as he stroked himself to complete hardness. They could suck him. They could definitely suck him if that was the way they talked. Then again there wouldn’t be any talking in this situation on his end.
“No. No I just never really…uh been public with a guy,” Dean admittedly sheepishly flickering his eyes between his face and the grass with pink cheeks.
“It’s a girl, and I’ve named her Ezekial,” he said fondly.
Just like the very first message implied would happen, Dean’s toes curled, and he bent his knees so he could dig his heels into the mattress while beginning to thrust up into his hand. All while holding his phone in a death grip. Beads of precum were smoothing the glide even more now from where he had started to really leak from the words.
I'm having loads of fun writing this thing despite Dean's torture LOL xD he and I are really toeing a fine line here on a few things. So far I think I'm keeping the balance though! Will it last? Yea....probably not.
“Who’s this little guy?” Dean asked in a soft sweet tone, bending down to look at the five tiny kittens and specifically pointing out the mostly black girl that had a variety of orange and white spots.
“So this is where your flowers are?” Dean asked as they walked towards the backdoor. “Here at the clinic? I thought they were at your place?”
Thank you for reading this abomination if you made it this far <3
We will top out somewhere around 45-50k probably. Hopefully. Cross your fingers....
The man’s idea to come by his work had been an exciting suggestion. Not only could he show and share the professional part of his life with him, but he could see him again without asking him out on a date. Something he wasn’t entirely sure if Dean wanted or not. There were only so many clues he could pick up via text, and he wasn’t all that great at it if he was being truthful.
Started out weird, but now I need this in picture format along with more flowers during sex scenes. A different use than the standard rose petals on the bed. More....need more than 100 words finally....
“So you do?” Castiel asked for clarification looking at him pointedly.
As soon as he hit send, Castiel cursed himself. Dean was so bad about that. Making him get lost in the moment. Was that an inappropriate way to breach the topic of seeing him again or could it be taken as a flirtation?
PS. Lyrics belong to know one. Just total bullshit I made up on the spot.
Apologies for the delay. I had a very bad weekend, and it is hard to channel this Castiel when I'm drunk, hungover and royally pissed off consistently for days LOL all of that emotion went into another fic xD
Reaching around Castiel just let himself go, and slipped his thumbs into the man’s ass crack, stroking the fabric as he moved him forward so his jerks were more controlled by space. It created smaller, looser tugs that had his hips beginning to rock as he thrust up into Dean fist. The man twisted his wrist in a clearly practiced movement, and rotated his thumb in a circular fashion under and on top of the head each time he tugged upwards.
The guy wanted to suck his dick though, not the other way around. Well….not his dick, but still the visual was there. At least for him. Maybe the guy needed his own visual since they didn’t know who they were talking to. Obviously it was someone they had a thing with, and whoever they were was at least pan or bi. They had to be if they had a cock and was also itching to suck one.
Feeling the vibration in his pants pocket, Castiel ignored it despite the urge to reach for it. As much as he wanted to keep texting Dean he did have a job to do. Although it seemed to be growing just a little bit harder since they had taken up texting. Perhaps he needed to leave his phone in his bag. Then again how were emergencies supposed to contact him? During the day he supposed they could just call the office directly, and at the point they needed his cell he would be off the job free to do as he wanted anyways.
Thankfully the man seemed much more comfortable texting than he had been in person. Well more like sober in person. He was on a whole new level of comfortable with himself when he was drunk. The playful and teasing connection came naturally between them apparently, and even via text Castiel was enjoying it greatly. It just slipped in through their basic communication and questions. Dean was, for the lack of better wording, something else. Something else that intrigued him.
They hadn’t discussed their pasts in depth yet, although Castiel was sure already some of it had to do with being the only one to take care of his little brother. Not to mention working himself to death starting at the early age of sixteen like he had been told. Of course he had no doubt he was still leaving out a lot of personal details. His own well off upbringing made it hard to imagine what all Dean had gone through.
“Oh….” Castiel gasped in surprise, parting their lips only a hair and opening his eyes from where they had shut.
Dean nodded his head approvingly, so Castiel reached forward and cradled the man’s jaw with one hand. Softly guiding their lips back together he made his own hum of approval. His face had just the tiniest bit of stubble on it that was enjoyable to brush against.
Precome was steadily leaking onto his tongue, and when he tried to lap at the flavor while still stroking Dean whimpered. The sound was beautiful, making him suck the man even harder until he was essentially fucking his face. Castiel welcomed it by going with the movement, relaxing his throat and allowing him in as far as he wanted to go. Which was apparently pretty far as he began reaching his peak.
Fun fact: I had to rewrite the first scene like 6 times because Dean's balls were in such a twist I thought he was going to castrate himself.
“Well even though he works with humans, and my focus is animals….I think I could make it work for you,” Castiel said, incredibly pleased with the change of mood. “I did start off with a focus in human medicine after all.”
Instead he focused on the second picture. The true tease. While his mouth had only slightly been open in the first one, just enough to tease him with what he could have, the second was a close up.
With a new approved mission Castiel didn’t waste any time. He quickly tucked the panites down beneath the man’s scrotum before taking his balls into his hand. A gentle tug earned him a small groan from Dean, and he could feel them tighten in his palm as he sucked him down without hesitation.
Also....one of your desperate to know questions is answered in here :D you're welcome.
“Was I presumptuous?” he asked, beginning to feel foolish for letting his emotions take over, as Dean looked back towards the visible parking lot nervously. They hadn’t kissed since that night after all, and they had just come off a sensitive subject.
-------------------------------------
I might even switch up next chapter to Cas's POV.....hmm? Maybe? We will see.
Still Dean didn’t recognize the phone number it had come from, and the only person in his real life that knew of
Bingo Square: Rainbow
“I’m surrounded by animals everyday. Why would I need to take pictures from the internet?” he asked, curious about the weird assumption.
All the while though the man continued to stroke him generously through his orgasm. It felt short lived, but it was intense enough to make up for the short period of time he got to experience it. Especially when Dean began nuzzling his nose under his ear like he was enjoying the warmth or the scent of him. The action made him attempt a laugh that he didn’t have enough air for yet.
Castiel watched with a warmth of joy as Dean cooed at the kittens, and stroked Ezekial gently with his finger through the bars. A look of affection etched over his face. He briefly wondered how severe the man’s allergy that he told him about was, but he was sure Dean knew how to take care of himself. Still it might be best if they got some fresh air for him. Plus there were the flower beds he could show him. They had talked briefly about his love for gardens, and he was quite proud to share them.
“Now don’t try and clean it at home with anything as it could damage the tissue further,” he continued. “There may be a scar from one spot. Just keep an eye on it, and after seven to ten days depending on how it looks you should be able to take the cone off. Give him breaks if you want, but watch him the entire time to make sure he isn’t rubbing or pawing at it which could reopen it and start the healing process all over again. Pat down with a damp cloth gently if there is any drainage. Don’t wipe. There shouldn’t be any though.”
Dean licked his palm and started to work his hand up and down his shaft enthusiastically. Whatever his name was really knew how to paint a picture. Hell if he had to guess he would say the man did this a lot. Because now that he had a face, a mouth, to go along with the words the visual was as vivid as if it was happening to him that very moment.
Perhaps this was a bit of luck after all. Luck wasn’t something that usually came his way in his personal life. Often it was completely lackluster, and dull. This was anything but lacking in excitement though luster. The way the man had gone from dirty talk to apology after apology was just down right funny, and cute. What would it hurt to tease the guy? Especially if he was that embarrassed.
The man was gorgeous in a dangerous kind of way. Blue eyes sparkling like the ocean in contrast to the dark hair that appeared to be black, untamed in every way. Even the five o’clock shadow somehow radiated “I’m the boss”. Dean ignored the lingering question of why he was wearing a partly undone white button up at 11pm while jerking off though.
Zazzles wounds could easily turn into infection if he were to go without a cone, and wasn’t properly monitored at all times. Getting his nose dirty would be too easy given the nature of dogs in general. He could already see the young dog burying it in the dirt looking for moles since it liked the chase.
Chewing on his lip Dean let his thumb swipe over the screen of his phone slowly. Tracing the bubble of words and outline of the picture once again. Was this some stroke of good luck or just some kind of fucking tease? Was it a test? It could be any of them he guessed, but why would someone include a picture? What were the odds of any of those scenarios?
“Have you thought about adding a little shade around here?” Dean asked, pushing his flannel sleeves up to his elbows as they began walking around the middle beds slowly. “I mean fuck I don’t even have fur, and I’m already sweating.”
“It was a long time ago. It’s fine,” Dean said more or less to himself. “Yes and no. I….when I was little our house caught fire. I was four, but it was bad or well ‘traumatic’ enough they call it, that I retained a few memories. Sammy was only like six months old at the time, and I can remember him in my arms running out of the house. Nothing but orange, red, and yellow on each side of me. Like a hot ass tunnel. Then I remember watching my dad throw himself out of the front door just as a loud crash or explosion or something sounded. After that I only remember the feeling of Sammy’s weight in my arms.”
Because yes I can work angst in under 1000 words when I'm in a mood.
Dean’s upper lip twitched, staring at the hardened cock standing tall and proud. Completely swollen with it’s defined head bulging, and shining with what was obviously precum smeared over the slit. Two fingers were spread around the bottom of it’s thick base pushing down the curls to frame it. Honestly the most enticing part was what those long fingers were attached to. The large hand was big enough to almost cover the entire black bush of pubic hair. Almost.
I was editing this and questioning why I make my chapters so long xD
Bingo Square: Sandstorm
It would be a lie to say that the night they spent together hadn’t been the best one in a long time. How could he not want to see that beautiful man again? While there were no expectations, and he didn’t know what Dean thought of what happened, he couldn’t let the possibility slip away like a drunken one night stand. Their casual conversation during dinner, and before they had gotten wasted was far too much fun for that.
Half of the time he didn’t know what the man was talking about. That only spurred Dean on further, trying to educate him in pop culture. Castiel didn’t mind though because he loved listening, well reading, the man’s passionate attitude on whatever subject. It kept telling him more and more about him.
Does Cas not actually know he sexted Dean?
“Sure did,” the gruff owner spoke, encouraging the dog to sit, which it didn’t. “Broke some of the wire fencing by the shed trying to get a mouse and just….blood everywhere. He was a determined little shit.”
“Good point,” Dean conceded with a small one shouldered shrug.
“I have some here, and at home,” he explained. “I thought it would be good for the animals to have something to explore, and some extra smells when the handlers and owners walk them around. Plus they are beautiful and add to the scenery. Not to mention it encourages the bee and butterfly populations as well.”
Nodding, and mentally stashing that information away for later, Castiel resisted guiding the man out of the room by the small of his back. That was an urge he never had had before, but the thought of doing such a casually intimate act sounded enticing. Dean just made him want to hold him. He wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing really given their current status of….well he didn’t know what they really were.
“Better?” he asked.
-insert sobbing because that triggered remembering the confession line-
(See the end of the chapter for
The action for some reason caused Dean to laugh lightly, although he didn’t know why. Probably the kiss he realized. It wasn’t like the tattoos were actually any kind of damage. They were just symbolism, but still. Just imagining that scenario as an adult was horrible. Then imagining his child having to go through that was painful.
Yes all my SPN followers/commenters get a cute name now because you make me feel special LOL
“You were I believe the equivalent of ‘eating me alive’ on the dance floor,” Castiel reminded him, unbelieving that he might be embarrassed or shy about that. “Surrounded by only God knows how many people may I remind you.”
I'd like to add some information about myself here.
I have no idea....but I mean Cas cares about everything...
I was stuck on this one....but thanks to a chat and some freaky friends throwing me a curve ball I figured something out.
Bingo Square: Thin Ice
Taking the dog’s head in his hands he studied it closely as they tried to lick him. It definitely wasn’t severe despite one cut being large enough there was a flap of skin. Nothing was too deep that needed stitches though. A general cleaning would work.
When the phone in his hand vibrated less than a minute later, Dean nearly vibrated out of his skin along with it. The little red number one for a new message taunting him before he pushed through the worry and opened it.
Dean’s thumb stilled, and his grip tensed a little around his hand. Apparently the meaning was a personal topic. He instantly regretted pushing the boundaries. Perhaps they were much like scars. Most had a reason or meaning, and some were less than pleasant memories.
-evil elmo fire gif-
Castiel pursued his lips in thought. He had made sure they had just the right amount of flowers to not look uncontrolled, but now that he thought about it, what good did that actually do for his patients' health besides scent entertainment? The hot and occasionally muggy weather of summer, dogs specifically needed shade to stay cool. Especially those with double coats. Had he really gotten so lost in something so menial that when it came to the big picture he forgot about something so crucial?
Castiel felt an odd amount of happiness hearing the man remember him talking about them. Especially since the topic didn’t sound like one he was all that interested in. The same way he wasn’t exactly into cars, but he enjoyed reading Dean’s enthusiasm behind the subject.
Hallowing his cheeks Castiel rolled his tongue around the edge of the head he could feel. Sucking someone uncut wasn’t proving all that much different, but it gave him more to play with. Teasing the skin back and forth as he bobbed up and down, along with his hand as he pumped in to match the speed.
phone was Anna. Even disregarding the unfamiliar number she wouldn’t be one to send him what he was reading and looking at anyways. While his wife knew of his sexuality, supported him with everything, she wasn’t about to send him dick pics and dirty talk. That was just fucking weird.
Getting lost in the feeling more than he should, Castiel let his other hand simply roam Dean’s body to re-familiarize himself with it. He was firm and as well filled out as he remembered. An explosion of desire shot through him with the memories and flirting they had shared so far. It caused him to begin caressing his side with the same fluidity of their mouths moving together, until finally he dipped into his pants wanting to feel his heated skin.
Bingo Square: Experiments
More Cas POV because for some reason when I wrote this fic all his chapters turned out longer -shrug- As always I present to you more fluff. Or at least that's what it feels like to me. Hope you enjoy though <3 you were originally going to get phone sex, but the boys just wanted to chat playfully. Blame them for denying your smut needs. Otherwise the chapter would have been longer. I suppose some like short ones though? I hope anyways.....
“What do these mean?” Castiel asked, tracing their lines with his eyes although he wanted to with his fingers. “Did you get it because you considered being a firefighter?”
What Dean really wanted to know though was who that hand, that cock, belonged to. The picture actually looked genuine, and real with a sliver of bright orange underwear nestled under what he could see of the heavy scrotum sitting on top. No, it wasn’t like some stolen image off of google.
“Thank you. It only cost me my future first born child,” Castiel told him honestly, and Dean’s resulting laugh was a deep, beautiful sound. “Would you like me to show you around? I can show you the kittens I sent you a picture of.”
Dean let out a steading breath, and opened his camera while slowing his hand. Instead of gripping the bottom of his cock tightly like so many people did with these kinds of pictures, which in his opinion were dull and unsavory, he chose to loosely hold himself. Keeping his first two fingers behind the middle so his erection stayed steady, he pressed his thumb up against the edge of his tip to show them the definition. Show them where they could run their tongue.
Dean groaned and gripped the base of his cock tightly. That was what he knew the guy was hiding. Maybe he was one of those quiet kinds that were totally filthy animals behind closed doors. The ones that would tear you apart until you were a sobbing mess of ecstasy.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want Dean,” he started apologetically. “I didn’t…”
Dean appeared to study the various flowers and shrubs for a second, taking it all in. Everything from cosmos and tiger lilies to irises, and roses. All were placed aesthetically to Missouri’s liking. The woman had insisted he couldn’t just throw it all out “willy nilly like that” like he had originally begun to.
It was torture. Pink plush lips parted with his wide thumb resting on the corner, and his forefinger on the other. There was his clearly wet tongue curled up around his upper lip.
Can you believe my original goal word count for this fic was 15k? This is why I can't be given word limits or one shots. They are just impossible. O_O
Yes the chat conversation involved is actually the chat helping influence this xD GREATLY I might add. Our nicknames are nearly the same also, but I did alter some slightly for privacy purposes. You can have fun guessing which one is me! Because yes this was basically a real life one,  and how our chat works LOL you will also get the meaning behind Dean's nickname when a certain someone discovers it. That is going to be a fun moment haha for me at least. Dean? well....probably not
Instantly made me think of the scenes on the show because Dean's an epic singer always!
Castiel had a feeling from what he had observed about him that it was the latter. Sure it may have been a bit much trying to contact him the day after a night of drinking, but he had felt the need to apologize for Gabriel once more. To let Dean know he was serious about wanting to see him again.
For those few that have been following since the PWP one shot.....I believe majority of your questions are finally answered here. You're welcome ;D
Hope you enjoy some insight into Cas's POV. I'm a sucker for POV changes to give you the full view!
“Nothing. It’s adorable,” Dean elaborated, gesturing to the kittens. “More power to ‘em. I mean come on. I call my brother Samantha, and friend Charlie Charles all the time. I actually think it’s kinda cute. Isn’t that right you little fuzz balls. Yes, yes I am.”
“Really, it’s fine doc,” Dean tried to laugh it off further with a dismissive wave, but it was obvious he came up short.
Gripping the small wedge available of the man’s panties tightly, Castiel moaned shamelessly trying not to bite down on the man’s lips as his orgasm started to crest. Then it turned into a full on whine when Dean abandoned his mouth to latch onto his neck. The increased pressure all around him caused his entire body to spasm as he started to come. For a hand job it was surprisingly short circuiting in a way that had him holding onto the man like a lifeline afraid he would fall. Until he remembered he was pressed up against the shed, and at that point he briefly felt embarrassed for coming so quick and hard.
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” Castiel started trying to get his attention and calm him down, but he realized it was pointless as it quickly became a chant driving the man to go faster.
I don't find it a big deal at all, and find it unnecessary really, but for the sake of risking unfavorable comments I'm going to put a warning <---- that a/b/o is DISCUSSED briefly. This is NOT an a/b/o fic. Just the dynamics are thrown around a little in conversation.
For days now he had been texting Dean. At first he had worried he wouldn’t get a response once the man had left his house, and he hadn’t for over twelve hours when he finally caved and the sent the first message. Castiel wasn’t sure if that was due to Dean’s job or nerves.
Enjoy <3
Tilting his head, Castiel admired them as well. He had been there when they were born out of fear for the mother dying during birth due to her emaciated state. At the very least he would have been likely to save the kittens, but the mother had pulled through and was recovering nicely with some high protein food to make up for her energy put into milk production.
Bingo Square: Emergency
Here it is. The end of the road for this fic unless for some reason it explodes and people want a sequel or something. I say that because it does feel like I’m robbing you a little and there is potential there, but I truly can’t take anymore fluff. It’s been more stressful than fun. I wanted to pull my hair out, and that’s not how it should be for me.
That’s why he had his private phone. This phone. The one place he could indulge, and be himself. Well as much as you could be virtually anyways. Aside from going by the name Michael, and saying he was a mechanic like his dad, the rest was pretty true to who he was. The only other time he could come close to who he truly was, was at home with Anna.
“Hmmm. Is that going to make you feel better?” he asked with a grin, feeling emboldened by his decision. “A good doctor’s goal is always to make their patients feel better.”
Castiel snorted, imagining Dean’s blush. He always got what was clearly playfully defensive whenever he brought up any of his confessions from the dance floor. Even to the point he wanted to argue romantic comedies and music with him.
More behind that username later in the story 😈😘
Does Dean not recognize Cas?
“How is it you know so much about trees?” Castiel asked, finally taking a breath.
Pulling on the fabric, Castiel wiggled it around until it was wedged between Dean’s ass cheeks. He didn’t want him to doubt the decision for even a second. Just as through text, or that night they were grinding together, the idea….no, the knowledge, that this handsome man wore panties? Then this time it was for him, and because he had simply playfully asked? It caused lust to start coursing through him. His mind became muddled with images of what was covering Dean’s bulge that he had felt growing steadily against his own crotch as they pressed together.
Castiel was not all that surprised to see what was revealed looked just like actual womens panties. There was no extra space for his testicles let alone his full blown erection The flushed swollen head was peaking out of the tight band where a tiny black bow rested. Both the angry red colored skin of his cock, and the black contrasting beautifully with the pale blue fabric.
After recently learning Dean had a cat allergy and was hesitant about them, he had taken to sharing with him some of the more loving cats he had ever come across. A few stories, and even a few about his patients. Crookshanks was an orange male tabby cat he had seen earlier that day, but definitely was not one of the nice stories.
He hesitated a moment- and then stepped into the darkness. He didn't know where he was going, but he walked forward with purpose. In the chair sat Metatron again. But he'd lost weight. The large man Dean had seen last time was all saggy skin and sharp bones.
"I can't... We can never leave..." she trailed off.
~ 13 years ago, Azcro High. Maddison, New Jersey. Dean's sophomore year. ~
There were several moments of silence and Dean worried he'd said the wrong thing before the man behind the door spoke up, "... You're... a good person, Dean... A real friend." He then closed his mail slot and ended the conversation.
"What the hell," Dean panted, "just happened."
"Where have you been, kid? I was getting worried," said Greg.
Again he walked up to the machine and before Bobby or Cas could say or do anything, Dean yanked the cord from the wall and watched as the spirit in the middle of Mr. Carrigan's chest disappeared.
"You know I'm not actually gay, right? Well, Charlie is and Cas is.... whatever he is. But they're good people. How could anyone hate those two dorks?" Dean replied fondly.
Garth smiled brightly at him and told him it was a wonderful idea. Dean couldn't think of what to say, only reminded him to not serve him bologna.
Well, that made sense. He thanked her and moved on. Standing in front of the ladder was a huge scribbled monster with one eye.
It seemed to think a moment before nodding. Good enough for Dean. "Did Mrs. Carrigan do this to you?" Cas asked before Dean had a chance.
He went back to Cas's room, "Hey, dude. Can I have a piece of paper and a pen? I saw this symbol in your kitchen, and I want to send it to Bobby- See if he knows what it is."
"Wha-" he mumbled as he startled awake.
"I'm not entirely sure," she replied, "but I found something else- missing person from 1993. Ben Breadon, 7 years old. He lived here with his mom, Lisa, and her husband, Greg. He must be the son that the chick in my bathroom was babbling on about."
"Horrible things happen when the sun burns out." That seemed as close to a yes as he was getting.
"Hello? Sir? Can you hear me?" Castiel called out, not receiving an answer. He stepped closer, shouting now, "Mr. Carrigan? Can you hear me?"
"I love you too, Bobby." he snarked.
"We should probably get into those rooms, Dean. Just in case." Cas supplied when he'd finally caught up with his own mind.
They all walked to the cooler, and Castiel lifted the lid. Inside were piles of human skin soaking heavy in blood. Bobby turned away and vomited on the floor while Dean could only stare at it in silent horror.
"Why not?" it seemed like a genuine question.
"Eons ago, we created a Great Hole in the papery fabric of this world. A Hole that contains the cumulative knowledge of all the universe."
He saw nothing for a bit, and was losing hope before he saw an archway, through which he could see a dark bathroom- the toilet intact. He stepped through hesitantly. He was still a bit frightened of toilets, if he were being honest. While this one seemed normal, he gave it a wide berth- just in case.He heard screaming and a fight, but didn’t open the door until all sound stopped. He stepped back into Mrs. Mills' apartment.
Dean interrupted, "I won't tell anyone. I promise. Thanks." He said holding up the envelope. He turned, focused on the page- not noticing Crowley's eyes following him and a sad smile appearing on the other boy's face when Dean left the restroom.
"Huh? No, I've never been. But my mommy would sometimes go with Mrs. Novak."
"Dad's trial is tomorrow. Is it true he's representing himself?" Sam, ever the lawyer, seemed confused.
Dean shot up out of bed, panting hard and reaching for his prosthetic. He felt too bare, too wild without it.
On the way to the science lab, Dean spotted a paperclip on the ground and picked it up. Never knew when one might need to pick a lock. He continued to the lab, greeting Cas and Charlie, who were both crowed around the microscope when he arrived.
Dean boarded the elevator and went to the third floor. Skipping Chuck and Benny, he walked into 304. He could've sworn someone lived there, but the apartment was completely bare and no one answered him when he called out. Just in case, he pulled out the Game boy, and walked further into the apartment.
"Would you have been at Lake Windigo?" He asked.
Dean told him everything he knew, "Cas and Charlie ruled out most meats, but it still bugs me we don't know what it is." writing the checks for the bills- copying his Dad's chicken scratch signature with ease.
Dean was in the empty, white space again. The same one from before the puzzle box disappeared. It hurt to be here, everything was too bright. The head he'd seen in Cas's treehouse in front of him, speaking. Dean couldn't understand it, but it was more clear than last time. Even the features were more clear. He could see short, blonde hair and eyes so blue they rivaled Cas's.
The older man spluttered into the phone, gave Dean another warning and hung up. Dean then walked into Charlie's room.
Dean was more comfortable with this topic, already hashed it through with Garth. "It's not like that. It's not a 'trigger' and I'm not afraid of lunch meat. It's just one of those things where I got into something I shouldn't have, and now I can't eat it. Why didn't you ask Bobby on the way? He knows all the details. "
Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, she dropped from the noose and her body split in half, with a black, smoky mass coming out from her discarded body and screeching at him. Dean blacked out again, and when he came to, Cas stood in front of him, hands on his knees and panting hard- a strange device in his right hand.
"Sure, let's do your bathroom first? It's closer."
Dean couldn't help but feel disappointed by how unhelpful it was, but in his experiences ghosts couldn't lie. He sighed, knowing he'd made a promise. Like Castiel tried to do earlier, he moved to the other side of the bed where the machine whirred, taking a deep and reaching for the cord when he heard footsteps outside.
"My apologies, Dean."
There was a letter addressed to Dean, though-no return address, no stamp, nothing except his name. Not suspicious at all, Dean thought to himself, opening the envelope. Inside held another journal page. He put in the brown leather cover he had inside his pocket to read later. He went upstairs, taking the bills and placing them on the kitchen table. On the refrigerator was a note.
That settled it, Dean decided. Charlie was awesome.
"No!" Dean and Gabe yelled at the same time.
"So we'll investigate after school. Today is going to be another late day for her, so it'll give us sometime." suggested Charlie.
(See the end of the chapter for
But he tried, his feet slamming down on the ground and leaving dark, bloody footprints behind him. As he ran he came across machines, he didn't know what they did, but to put space between him and the monstrosity, he knocked them over as he came across them. It seemed to work when he came across a broken door and could no longer hear the beast. He pushed the door, watching in awe as the pieces faded away.
"Pink is for everyone, baby. Your daddy has been filling your head with all kinds of bad ideas." She'd say, giggling at Dean's attempt of a serious face. "Now, come eat your lunch, baby, and when you're done, you can play some more."
He moved forward again, now running into a stick woman with a triangle head. "What's with your friend back there," he asked.
" n-- -af-, --n-"
"Lisa," he called, "can you hear me?"
"Dude, you don't remember? I found it in your mom's wooden chest? In the tree house?"
He had to carry on though, no matter how much it hurt, he had a toilet to fix- so he stepped on, using it as a bridge. Each step sunk into the flesh, and when Dean lifted his foot to take the next one- he would see skin and blood stuck to his tennis shoes. It turned his stomach. He was grateful when his feet landed back onto the brick. He breathed a moment, trying to keep himself from throwing up before continuing again. The journey harder now, he'd accidently killed something by just trying to help.
"Gabriel could have the right idea, though. If there is an issue with the meat product in our sandwiches, I'd like to look at it on a microscopic level, however it would be helpful to know what the exact ingredients are."
"Huh, you haven't been able to summon him?" Dean shook his head, "Maybe finding that rosary will help. Y'know connection to belongings and all that."
"Oh, c'mon y'all," Benny complained, "don't ruin lunch for me. It's the only time-a day I can eat."
"Dude," Dean gagged, "It smells like *** in here."
He held his Gameboy out, the same way he did in Charlie's bathroom, and walked around the treehouse. There was mostly nothing until he came across the same picture of Cas and his family from earlier. He pressed the button and unlike Ben and the other ghost, this was just a floating head-shape. The eyes and mouth blurred out, and it didn’t really have a nose. It didn't have a consistent skin color either. It flashed between the colors of the rainbow. Like static on a TV.
If he noticed the concerned looks Bobby and Cas shared, he said nothing about it. Together, they left the room and walked back towards the other room. Cas unlocked the door, and they stepped in. On the walls were more newspaper clippings about missing people in the town, and saws of various sizes and shape. All of them had coats of old and new blood. Across from the door sat an ominous cooler, blood coating the lid. Finally, further into the room- a machine with many levers- also saturated in blood.
"He's got a kid- about 5. I don't know why the school included this in his file, but the little guy loves cats even though he's allergic."
Dean was playing in the field by his house. The worries that five-year-olds carried now barley crossed his mind as he ran, pretending to be an air-plane. He decided he needed a rest, so he ran towards his mother who sat, relaxed, on a pink blanket. He would always wrinkle his nose at it. Pink was a color for girls- he'd say. His mom would laugh, hold his little face in her hands, and kissed every freckle she could see. He didn't really mean it- he actually liked the pink she surrounded herself with, he just wanted to hear her laugh- it was the best sound he'd heard in his 5 short years of life.
He couldn't get through with the pony in the way, Dean turned around to look for an exit or something. A dark wall blocked off the other end, but he spotted a ladder nearby. He didn't really see another way out, so he climbed up into a narrow hallway- there was another ladder that went up and right next to it, there was a large switch with lights above it.
Dean pulled it out of his pocket again, walking up to Mr. Carrigan, the light going crazy. He pressed the buttons, and from the man's chest, a dark, formless... thing emerged. Dean wasn't sure what to call it. It scared both boys when it spoke.
"Oh, man. You kiss your daddy with that tongue? I bet he--" Dean didn't finish his taunt, as Crowley's fist connecting with his prosthetic interrupted him.
Gabriel rolled his eyes, "Get bent."
Well, he thought, no pressure. He stepped forward to grab the journal, but found his feet heavy and difficult to move. Still, he pushed forward, grabbing it. As soon as he touched it, his ears started ringing. It grew louder and louder, he could barley stand it. It was too loud. It hurt so badly. It felt like someone familiar trying to reach through though, so he spoke.
He glanced behind himself. A monstrous combination of a man was running up behind him. The head misshapen, close to normal shape, but not quite. Chest concave, from as far away as Dean was, he could see every rib. Its hands hung far past what Dean could only assume were knees. Its skin was a sickly white, and it snarled and snapped at Dean, as if trying to consume him. Every step it took, it filled the area with a thunderous sound, and it ran with such speed Dean barely hoped he could outrun it.
He never knocked anymore and just walked in. He walked the opposite way of Cas's room to the kitchen, having noticed Jimmy working on the sink. He knew the Novaks had given him a permeant invitation to dinner- he still liked to give them a heads up if he planned on eating with them.
They both said quick goodbyes before Dean was off. He wondered if there were any more strange symbols around the building, so he went up to the fifth floor. He started in 502. Someone had left a birdcage in the middle of the floor. Dean pulled out his Gameboy, which had lit up. And again, when he pressed the buttons, symbol came flying at his face. He'd kept the paper that Cas gave him and drew the new symbol. Dean then went down. He knew there wouldn't be anything on his floor, so he went to Metatron's old place.
"D-dean?! Ugh, go away, can't I get some privacy," they sounded like Crowley, but... stopped up.
"I'm sorry, man, they never really stick around long." he gave Cas a minute to process what he'd just seen before speaking up. "We need to get into that bedroom, but it's boarded up. Do you or your dad have any tools I could use to get us in?"
I headcanon Cas as autistic because I am autistic. The way my autism presents is the way I wrote Cas’s autism. Please, do not complain about it in the comments. It’s much more apparent in this chapter because he’s in it more.
Dean nodded and ended the conversation there. He learned a while ago; it was best to just let Jimmy do what he wanted to. Arguing with him solved nothing. He said his goodbye and went into Cas's room. He knew the other boy had already gone up to Charlie's, but he was still trying to kill time to give Bobby a head start. He got to the middle of the room, when he received a text from said older man.
"Bobby, every time something happens here its covered up. We don’t know how deep this goes. You have to help us."
"A ghost goat, apparently. That shouldn’t surprise me, but that came out of nowhere. I should probably let Charlie know this thing can bring in ghost animals." Dean replied. He shot her a text, taking long enough for both of them to calm down.
SO life update: My 3-almost-4 year old sister fractured her wrist, work has been so bonkers that I barely have time to write, and I barely have enough to pay my bills this month. Also I deleted the tumblr page. I'll bring it back when I finish the story- for extra lore and stuff.
"Is this the field of Death?"
"Hey, yeah! Where'd you find that?"
"Do you know where your daddy is?"
It was finally the day. Sam's visitation. Dean took Garth aside early that morning and asked if it could be a lunch session. He couldn't stand the thought of Sam seeing him without his prosthetic, but if his brother was anything like him, he'd ask anyway. This way, he could pretend the glimpses he would allow Sam to have were accidents.
Dean sent a thanks over his shoulder as he bundled up. He headed out into the snow. It bit harder now that he didn't have anyone to talk to. The snow crunching beneath his feet seemed louder. And the climb up the ladder to the treehouse seemed longer. Dean felt he was being a little dramatic, it was just a treehouse.
Bingo Square: Topaz
“Why do you keep calling me doc?” Castiel asked, looking for a less sensitive topic, and out of actual curiosity. “Yes I have a doctorate degree, and yes I’m an animal doctor, but we are always referred to as vets.”
Not my kink at all, however now I'm stuck with this embarrassed blushing Dean that I can't get out of my head. I need to see it LOL
1. You get a longer chapter because....well....you do?
“Indeed. I did,” Castiel growled in response, kissing him roughly again unable to help himself.
Walking towards the kennels Castiel tried to judge the distance that would leave room for them to grow to maturity while also leaving room for any additional kennels. Those were definitely needed to be as close as possible to the outside kenneled dogs to keep them the coolest. The closer shade would allow them to be even cooler than the simple coverings they currently had. Perhaps a third tree on the side of the shed that faced north as to not prevent the current flowers from their needed amount of direct sunlight would also be beneficial. How had he been so stupid not think of any of this?
After cleaning the furry troublemaker up, Castiel sent them on their way with reassurance and a smile. Despite the dog’s confusion for their new torturous necklace, he went to the front desk for his next patient's paperwork. Just a routine yearly check up for heartworms, and flea and tick prevention. They weren’t here yet though so he would give them five to ten minutes before moving on to the next one as long as the patient after them didn’t arrive early. So he allowed himself to slip away for a moment and indulge in his private life by checking his messages.
Because apparently my ice cold heart of stone contains marginal amounts of fluff.....
“I’m glad you could come Dean,” he said genuinely.
“Fuck,” Dean mumbled leaning over him, and bracing his hands on the metal shed. “Are you gonna suck me doc?”
“Dean,” Castiel breathed, bringing the man’s hand up instinctively to kiss the tattoo like it was a wound. “I don’t know what to say. That’s incredibly brave for such a small child.”
"I'm afraid I know nothing about bologna. This room is my prison, my tomb of infinite sorrow, I can never leave this state." It moaned.
"But of course," she replied. Dean got the feeling this was a recurring joke between them. He didn't know how he knew, but he did.

Dean helped Gabriel up off the floor and the boys made their way out of the building.
Another room, Dean hoped it was the last one. He led her through the one directly across from her again. Thankfully, it led to a room without anymore doors. Stood in the middle of the room was Greg. His hands were over his eyes, and he was crying. Dean led Anna to him.
"Don't mind my sister," she said, "she's just cranky because of the sun. Long ago, the beast cursed our ancestors. Since then, they have drawn us without limbs. If you wish to learn more, seek the prophet, beyond the field of death."
Together, they left and walked down the hall where Dean picked the lock, with Cas keeping a lookout. The coast stayed clear, and they were in fairly quick. However, As soon as they stepped in an awful stench assaulted their nostrils.
Charlie turned back to her computer, "Better find it then."
"Bugger off, squirrel, I have more friends than you ever will!" Crowley exclaimed. It sounded more like he was trying to convince himself rather than Dean.
Dean, at that moment, noticed the light on the Gameboy glowing a bright blue. He looked at her empty stare and pressed the buttons. In her chair, she rocked back and forth rapidly, visible electric shocks surrounded her. Her form flickered along with the lights, between the old woman that Dean knew and love and a decayed corpse wearing her clothes. Suddenly, it stopped the old woman disappeared. Instead, a younger woman, with bright red hair in Rowena's signature bun, sat in the still rocking chair.
He crawled into her lap, asking for cuddles without speaking. Peanut butter sandwich in hand. He ate quickly and spoke with his mouth full. "Mama, can you tell me that story about the angel again?"
He received a glare because it, which he ignored as he stepped further into the room. Inside were multiple bales filled with dirty adult diapers. On the walls were newspaper clippings overlapping each other, all talking about Mr. Carrigan's death. In the center of the room lay a mostly naked and chubby man- his only covering being a diaper wrapped around his waist. He was hooked into beeping machines that whirred and as they did so, pumped his lungs with air. What Dean could only assume was more human waste stained the bed where he lay on. His eyes stared into at the ceiling blankly. Not registering anything around him.
"She shouldn't get back until late, so I think we," Charlie looked directly at Dean, "should do our homework before you guys break in."
"If y'all aren't gonna-"
The next room held three more identical doors, Dean didn't know which to send her through so he guessed and took her directly up. The next room was very much the same, empty, three more doors. He took her through the door directly ahead of her. And again it led through to an identical room. He led her to the room at the bottom.
"I found a key to the first room, Dean. We can get in now." Cas said, holding a strange-looking key.
"An entrepreneur! In my building, truly an inspiration, a young man. However, I have to admit, I'm quite happy with my life here. I can continue my father's dream and make tea for my tenants. It really is the best of both worlds."
He pulled it out of his pocket, and sure enough, the light was on, mocking him. Dean walked closer to the stain and pressed the buttons. Suddenly a goat appeared: first bones, then his muscles, and fur. Although most ghosts dean had seen still had their heads, this one's floated about an inch above its body, blood that never landed dripped from its open neck. It "baaa"ed at him twice, then once, and another two times and disappeared in reverse of the way it'd came.
"No! Just no. I'm not into dudes, Cas. he's not- No. He wants a bribe for the list. How do you know his name anyway?" Dean told himself he wasn't jealous, but even he could hear the bite in his voice.
He walked forward, feeling the need to get out. It took a moment, but he eventually came across a gap he needed to get across- the only issue with it seemed there was an abomination of a pony in his way. Dried and saggy purple skin stretched painfully over sharp bones- knobby knees stuck out at horrifying angles and the ribs were clear as day from where Dean stood a couple feet away. What Dean could only assume were lips,  barely existed anymore- they were just a thin line of chapped skin and dried blood- Dean could see yellowing teeth. Its green eyes were bloodshot- in the worst way. The wings on its back were gigantic, but balding. Only a few thin feathers held on, but they looked horribly mangled. It looked like once it had a horn, but now in the middle of its forehead was a large hole where it must've fallen off- dried blood decorated the edges of it.
She turned to him with a frown, "I can't find anything on past murders- and I've looked everywhere. The only one that comes up is Metatron, but look at the photo." She scooted her chair closer to her bed so Dean could see the article she pulled up.

"I- I'd love to give it back, Dean, really I would," he sounded like he was begging for his life, "b-but the kids next door keep knocking my shelves over- it-it's the only thing holding them up right now."
He was soon playing as Cas's mom, which felt all kinds of wrong. He led her through similar mazes as the last level, but these electric ones where Rowena's were spikes. Her level also had buttons he had to lead her to in order to unlock the next area of the level.
He didn't want to think about though, so he moved to 502. Inside there were newspaper clippings nailed to the wall. He read the titles as he walked past. "The boy that shouldn't be alive.", "Father and Son go missing after crash", "Boy abducted by small blue woman."
Cas looked heartbroken so Dean changed the subject, He held the rosery up with two fingers, "this yours, Ben?"
He went to Cas's room and told him to follow. The other boy rolled his eyes, but did as he was told. They went to the elevator and up to the fifth floor, Dean filling Cas in on their way up. Cas wasn't sure if it would even work, but he could sure as hell try. They walked straight into 504 Where Dean pulled out the super GBA again and pressed the buttons.
"Weird," he said aloud to no one, but selected the next level which presented him with: "She knew not why this place called to her, yet could not prevent her feet from treading the dirt path before her. Perhaps it was simply curiosity, or perhaps it was destiny."
"Dean, there was no metal box. The rubix cube had your attention, though." Cas replied, confused. "Dean, try to get some sleep tonight. You're wearing yourself out."
"Charlie, you're awesome. While you do that, I'm gonna this baby for a test drive." He shook the Gameboy in his hand.
She faded away again, and in Dean's hand now was an old hand held phone. The handset was black, like a void, and the golden buttons seemed to float on it rather than in it. He dialed in the numbers she'd said, not understanding why, but knowing to do so anyway. After he did though, everything faded, and black, a comfortable feeling, the darkness, in front of him- a brown, leather-bound journal surrounded him, floated in midair. Cas's mom didn't reappear, but he could hear her this time, more clearly than she'd ever been.
"That's what we're hoping for, buddy."
"Very good." they spoke together, and it labeled their dialogue as the council," the preparations are now complete. Stay within the circle while we perform the summoning. "
"Hey, Jimmy." He greeting the man.
Ben tilted his head, confused, "What do you mean? I've been here the whole time."
"Holy crap, holy crap, Holy crap!" Charlie yelled, jumping in circles and flapping her hands, "That was a ghost! A real, conscious ghost!"
"I don't understand. What?" he asked.
Everyone else followed Dean to the library. The only times he'd been there had been to gather for group huddles when at least two people opted out. They stood close together and whispered so no one could hear them.
He knocked on Chuck's door and heard a yelp from behind the door. "Chuck! Open up. They'll be quieter, now - Crowbar." Dean yelled.
"I got this," Cas waved the device in the air, still panting, but mostly recovered, "from Charlie. She said that theoretically it could overload a spirit. Banishing it forever. After she gave it to me, I rushed upstairs to make sure you were okay. "
[and for the people who want to comment but don't know what to say: The song stuck in my head this week is: So far Away by Avenged Sevenfold. What about you or what song have you recently heard that made you feel something?]
The older man looked into the room behind Dean and replied with a raised eyebrow, "I can see that."
Dean winced, "That's fair. Sorry again."
"I'll stay, but Dean- if we don't live through this, I... I love you."
When Dean looked up, the spirit of Lisa materialized in the noose. Her eyes bulged, her tongue stuck out of her mouth- swollen and blood filled, her face purple and strained. She made a series of choked sounds, like she was trying to speak, but could not.
"Do you think Castiel found closer in that or do you you think it wounded him more, Dean?" Gath asked, sat across from him as always, Dean's prosthetic on the table between them.
He suddenly felt the need to check on Rowena again, so he walked into her place, and up to her chair. His Gameboy was acting up yet again, but when he pressed the buttons on it and her body started convulsing. Surrounded by static, she looked as though she were a corpse. Her skin either pulled tight against her skull or missing altogether. Dean quickly put the Gameboy away, unwilling to see that again.
"What the hell?" Cas said in disbelief.
"There are no happy endings in reality, dearie. We all get the same terrible ending... death." Ever the downer. Although he agreed with her, he still argued.
"Here, man. I still don't understand why you want this but just stay out of trouble, yeah? World could use more kids like you." he handed Dean a piece of paper- a label from a pack of bologna. On it read:
Dean, too focused on getting away, entered the first door he came across- that turned out to be the boy's restroom, where he heard crying coming from the last stall. He also noticed a crumpled up paper next to the trash. He picked it up and despite what John had taught him; he read it.
"D-dean?! Ugh, go away, can't I get some privacy," they sounded like Crowley, but... stopped up.
"Yes, Benny." They all replied in unison, letting him have whatever he wanted of the rest of their lunches.
"Oh," Ben suddenly remembered something, "Daddy and I were playing hide and go seek. "Gotta go, Dee!"
