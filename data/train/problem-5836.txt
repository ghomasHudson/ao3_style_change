Natasha sat down in a chair and leaned forward. “You guys are never going to believe this. Miles actually has a spider sense a lot like Peter Parker’s. He always knew when I was sneaking up on him. Didn’t you Miles?”
“I am a good kisser though, right?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows at Steve and smiling winningly.
“That’s on him,” Carol replied. “You have to take care of yourself right now. If Rhodey was here he’d tell you—”
--and a woman on the back of a winged horse in the background. He shook his head in amazement, putting his phone away as he sat down next to Steve.
Steve shook his head. “It’s not just about me. It’s about all the people who are going to read that and feel hated too.”
Tony wondered if Sam believed he'd be willing to break the law. He knew how it looked--until now he'd done everything the government asked. He'd done it partly because someone had to be there and better him than anyone else. But there was no looking back. He'd wanted control over the process and in doing so had lost control of what really mattered.
“I could never do that to you,” Steve whispered. “I couldn’t…” He hugged Tony so tight that Tony thought he would break, but Steve held him together. Steve could always hold him together like this.
They rounded the corner. Steve smashed the guard stationed at the door with his shield and kicked down the old wooden planks with a crash.
Tony felt the power on his suit crackle and go out--he'd been hit with an EMP. He whirled and elbowed his opponent in the face the good old-fashioned way as he tried to reboot power. That was just annoying.
Rhodey was still wearing his armor, but he had lifted the face plate and Tony could see that he was pretty bunged up. He looked at Natasha. She was silent, her eyes empty and Tony looked away quickly, knowing that she had probably fought with Barton. It had to be terrible that this had torn them apart too. Tony felt his own chest tighten. It had come between friends and siblings, so why not lovers?
"Easy, Cap," Tony interrupted, taking him by the shoulders. "It has nothing to do with chance. You made all this happen."
Steve turned to Jan. “If he saw half of what just happened with Galactus, he’s going to be terrified. He doesn’t know we’re the good guys. Hulk, maybe it would be a good idea if you took a few steps back. No offense.”
The tears dried on Steve’s face, he looked drained and pale. Tony sat down in a chair in front of Steve, like the breath had been knocked out of him. When he looked back up to meet Steve’s eyes, he saw the same guilt and shame that he felt, but he still almost couldn’t believe it, because if Steve didn’t blame him for everything that had happened, maybe, maybe Steve didn’t hate him.
Miles hopped down from where he was sitting next to Sam and ran over to Tony and Steve. “Dad, if Pops thinks you can’t protect yourself but you’re an Avenger then can I be an Avenger? Can I be an Avenger now?”
“It didn’t mean anything?” Tony asked in disbelief, taken aback, feeling like he had been punched in the face.
"Sleeping in a chair can't possibly be good for your back." When Tony didn't respond, Steve repeated, "Get in,” and Tony sat down on the side of the bed before he really had time to think about the mistake he was making.
Tony hummed to herself as she polished the mask of her suit. It had been a week since the Battle of New York. She still felt a bit banged up, bruised here and there, with some cuts that were still healing, but she was mostly back to her normal self.  Except there was one thing that was still bothering her.
"I want this fight over as fast as possible," Wanda said, and rose in the air, flying towards Red Skull. "Steve, Tony, protect Bucky and my brother. Sam, Natasha, with me."
Sam hugged him back hard. “I wouldn’t ever have gotten a chance to beat your ass at running if you’d died on me,” he murmured, tears stinging his eyes.
“Maybe because I was closer to where you were,” Tony wondered out loud. He was sure if Wanda had been able to control who she sent the vision to, she would’ve picked someone like Sam or Bucky. Someone Steve trusted.
He felt like he’d grown closer to Natasha in the past week than in the years they had fought side by side.
Bucky looked uneasily between them. “That actually might work. That’s about the last goddamn place they would look.”
“Looks like it,” Natasha replied with a smile. “Hey Miles, bet you can’t find me if I hide! But you have to count to ten first.”
Tony blinked back the tears in his eyes, staring at Steve in horror. “No, I realized that we were both wrong.”
He ran his hand up Steve’s chest and kissed him again, gripping his shoulders and then sliding his arms around the back of Steve’s waist. Even with his own suit and Steve’s body armor between them, he could feel Steve’s body molding to his own. Steve tilted his head to the side, pressing himself close to Tony and breathing out a sigh when they pulled away, faces still close.
Steve sighed. “But it does matter this time. I can’t let this slide, not when they’re bringing Peggy into it. They—they think that if I’m married to you, that it means I’m gay and that I never loved her, and how could Captain America be gay, right?” He started punching the heavy bag again. “Wouldn’t that be terrible? Wouldn’t that just be the end of American values?” Steve’s last punch sent the heavy bag flying across the room. “Captain America can’t be gay,” Steve went on, shoulders stiff with anger as he caught his breath. “Don’t they know I fought a war against people who believed the same homophobic bullshit they do?”
Tony pulled him into his arms. Steve gingerly relaxed. He was so silent Tony didn't realize he was crying at first until his chest was heaving. It surprised and saddened Tony---the quietness. Sobs shook his body but he choked back the sound, breathing heavily against Tony’s neck. Tony held him tighter and it felt like Steve was almost going to crush him in return. Tony pulled him gently back onto the bed, wrapping his hand around the back of Steve’s head and holding him close.
It was Steve who spoke up next. “Don’t get me wrong, this is good news…but it was so important to you, and you just let it go?”
Steve's eyes slowly wandered over Tony's armor. "I hope not too many. It's fun when it's a little rough." Then, in a low voice that made shivers run up Tony’s spine, "Where's that kiss you promised me? I gave you mine."
It was every bit as good as she thought kissing Captain America would be. Eve’s lips were soft, her eyelashes brushing against Tony’s cheek. Tony grinned as she pulled back. Eve opened her eyes slightly and then closed them again she leaned back in for another kiss. Tony obliged, pulling Eve closer as she sat up on the edge of her work table. She wrapped her legs around Eve’s waist and trailed her hands up to her shoulders.
Tony turned pointedly to Steve. “—and then I gave him true love’s kiss and we lived happily ever fucking after. Steve, what the fuck?” he whispered.
Tony watched Steve's expression close off in a way Tony hadn't seen in a long time, and it made his heart ache with the awful familiarity.
“I’m prepared,” Tony said suddenly. Steve turned to look at him. “I want to adopt him,” Tony continued, his voice firmer.
“My marriage is a sham,” Tony said as he plopped down on the couch next to Rhodey, who was playing a video game with Carol.
“It’s not that I don’t want you to touch me,” Steve almost snapped, then clenched his jaw and looked down.
“I’m not going to let him get to you again,” Tony said quietly. “I swear to you. We’re a team now. We’ll all be here protecting each other. And we’ll have your back. As far as I’m concerned that’s the most important job anyway.”
Tony looked down, smiling despite himself. “I always thought you’d have kids before I did. If I even had kids.”
He didn’t have anything particularly witty to say after staring at Steve’s bare chest, so he just said, “I hate you.”
“I don’t know if he’ll make it, but he’s alive,” she said. “It’s lucky you got there when you did to shield him. The bullet only grazed his side.”
Steve shrugged, and smiled brighter, and there was something hard and fearless in his eyes. Tony thought he looked more like his old self than he had in a long while. "Like we finally have a lead. I'm ready to put an end to this."
Helen tapped her keyboard nervously, hit reply, and then hesitated. In a new tab she typed a search for Jane Foster.
It was a long wait in front of the door. Clint had gone to see Wanda. Bucky kept pacing back and forth, although the news about Wanda had calmed him slightly—she had been missing for a long time. But they were all on edge, and finally Sam got to his feet in frustration. “You’re not going to make that door open any faster by pacing in front of it, man. Just sit down and wait like the rest of us.”
“Right, sorry.” He stole a glance at Steve’s pale face and stepped out into the hallway. Natasha appeared around the corner and rushed up to him. “Bad timing, doctor’s in,” Tony explained, and Natasha sat down on the bench and looked hard at the door.
Sam and Bucky spent the day with Steve, but Tony was allowed to watch over him again that night. They didn’t talk—not about the war.
Before they split ways again, Tony grabbed Steve's shoulder. "Wait--if the Stone can mess with time like this, what's to say if Red Skull hit you with the it he couldn't reverse your healing, or--"
Tony’s head swam as he stared at the doctor, clean and petite in her hospital dress. He swallowed, still processing all this new information, residual panic and grief still coursing through his body as he tried not to tremble from the sheer effort of keeping it together.
Tony sat down next to Miles and put his arm around him, Steve on his other side. “Don’t worry, Steve and I have some ideas about that.”
“Now that I’m done telling the little fucker all about your embarrassing childhood, you’ve got some explaining to do, Rogers.”
Steve was still in his uniform, bloodied, his shield tossed across his chest. Tony sat for hours next to him before even moving. He was numb down to the very core. He stared at Steve’s lifeless body, trying to understand what had happened, how he had let it happen. The air around Steve seemed to pulse. This wasn’t real. This was a nightmare.
And then he was holding his head in his hands, crying silently, and Pepper was holding him—sweet, kindhearted, forgiving Pepper who still somehow loved him after all this.
Sam flew over and dropped directly in front of Steve, blocking his way. “What the hell is going on? We were
He looked over at Miles and saw that his lips were starting to tremble. “My…my mama always made me a…a…” He didn’t finish the sentence as large tears started to roll down his face. Tony knelt down and pulled him into his arms, rubbing his back. He lifted Miles into his arms and sat down on the couch.
Tony knelt at Steve’s feet, taking his hand. “Steve, baby,” he whispered, looking up at him. He didn’t even have time to mentally yell at himself for calling Steve “baby.” Blame it on years of getting used to saying that out loud to Pepper or something. Steve's jaw was still strong, trembling slightly as he closed his eyes to stop the tears.
"Right," Steve said, "we want to pick as many of them off as possible, but quick enough and quietly enough that Red Skull isn't alerted in time to make an escape."
Sam grinned and Steve put his head in his hands. “Glad you asked. His name is Bucky. We play a fun game where we annoy Uncle Bucky whenever we can.”
He put his coffee down suddenly as an invisible shape jumped on his shoulders and clamored around. Natasha ran into the room and put her hands on her hips, eyeing Sam, who was still clearly balancing an invisible stowaway.
“Well, I called this, byyyyy the way,” Sam said, drawing a circle around Steve and Tony in the air with his finger. “
"Hey..." Tony rushed forward and pulled Steve into his arms, his heart racing a thousand beats a minute. Steve stiffened, gripping Tony’s shoulder angrily with one hand as if to push him away, but unable to summon the strength.
Tony looked away again, tugging his hand away from Steve. “You’re a stubborn motherfucker, I’ll give you that.”
The noise faded and Tony looked up uncertainly at Steve. “Look, I just don’t understand why you would—”
“Isn’t it? In all the years you’ve been fighting, there hasn’t been any grey area? Something that made us compromise our own ideals in the pursuit of our
Tony looked away, slumping down on the couch. “That’s it. Next time Galactus decides to vacation on earth, I’m making sure he doesn’t leave in one piece.”
Tony sent a quick text to Thor on the off chance he's respond, though they hadn't heard from him in months.
Another laugh. “Okay. I just wanted to say I think it’s great that you adopted Miles with your best friend, Tony, I really do. I bet Steve will be a great dad. And I know you will be too.”
‘No one really needs spiderman. They did perfectly fine when you were out of commission because you decided to quit’.
“Of all the stupid-” he cut himself off. “Home now. Or I will come and get you.” He did not sound very happy. I was in for it now…
I answered this time. “Where the hell have you been? Do you realize how worried I was when you weren’t in your room this morning? When Friday said you weren’t even in the compound!?”
“Uh...sorry guys, I gotta take this…” Peter said. They all noticed the uncertain sound that was in his voice.
Tony and I walked out, I climbed into the passenger seat of the Audi and let my mind replay the events. I felt almost...lighter...I guess...Tony was right. I hadn’t noticed how much I was actually holding in.
“I’m glad you like it. But don’t talk with your mouth full,” Steve said smiling. Peter rolled his eyes and continued eating, slowly. By the time the teen was done, his plate was still full-ish due to him only eating the smallest bites and only when someone looked. The teen got up, hoping that he wouldn’t get caught, slipped past the table, scooted his food in the trash, and rinsed his plate. Everyone else was almost finished, Tony being the first. Then Steve, and so on.
“Do you wanna-” Sam didn’t even have to finish. Peter got up slowly and the two made their way to the kitchen. Sam sat in the living room with Bucky. Peter went to the kitchen. His eyes were red and puffy from crying as he shoved himself into Tony’s arms. Tony got over the initial shock of Peter throwing himself at him and hugged the teen back.
He remembered sitting in front of Steve’s body after the shooting, and wondering if he’d ever have it in him to love like this again.
She’d thought she had found on one of the government’s storage facilities for Stark equipment, and so she had gone alone, knowing she could take out any opposition she met. There were crates stacked high along the wall, like she’d expected. She passed by them, drawn to the end of the room, and stopped short.
Steve turned around, pulling off his hand wraps. “Besides, why couldn’t I be bi? Would that be so hard to believe?”
“I’m not hungry,” Steve replied. “It’s like before the serum. I’m tired. And I can’t breathe.” He pressed a hand over his chest. And then darkly, "I
All of the battles had come down to this one. They were all fighting this time, not split up into teams, not being careful and conserving their energy. It was all or nothing—it couldn’t go on much longer anyway, it just couldn’t. Or maybe Tony just didn’t know if he could.
“My…my mom always got raspberry ice cream,” Miles said quietly. Tony followed his gaze to a little boy and his mother standing on the beach hand in hand.
“You know, Pops would rather jump out of a plane with no parachute than stay out of a fight. It nearly gives me a heart attack every time. Are you sure you’re not related to him?”
Rhodey disappeared down the hall and Tony turned to look after him, feeling his heart wrench in his chest. At least he hadn’t driven away all his friends. Rhodey would probably never really know how much Tony needed him there.
Natasha smiled sadly and shrugged. "I said I had believed what I was doing was right but…" She trailed off. "Clint knows that I…" She sighed and shook her head. "I tried to apologize to him for my part in this, and he said, 'don't take all the blame yourself, Nat, leave some for the rest of us.'" She hummed a bit of a laugh. "You and me, we always wanted to believe that there’s a right side to be on, some sort of redemption at the end of all this to right our wrongs, but I'm starting to think in this one there’s only losers."
Peter fell asleep against Bucky’s shoulder almost the second he sat down. Tony was talking to Steve about what happened in the courtroom and Natasha covered Peter with a soft blanket. As soon as he was sure Peter was asleep, Bucky moved him so that the teen’s head was resting on the couch cushion and his legs over Bucky’s lap.
Peter bent over the girl, an array of emotions ran through him. “Oh my god…” He whispered brokenly. His hands shaking, his mind a mess, Peter left the scene, not wanting to think about it anymore. He swung furiously to the Stark tower, went through his open window, ran to the bathroom and ended up on the floor by the toilet throwing up. He couldn’t get the image out of his mind.
Clint was the silly Uncle. Bruce was the science Uncle. Rhodey was the favorite Uncle. Sam was the fun Uncle. Nat reminded him of the sweet and caring Aunt May before Uncle Ben died. And Tony and Steve were like the parents he never had...well didn’t remember. Peter didn’t know what to think about the fact that Tony and Steve were like the parents he never had. A few fond memories ran through his head, making him smile. But as his thoughts drifted elsewhere again, his smile faded.
Peter sat with Rhodey, Clint, and Bucky in the living room. The four of them were playing UNO. So far Rhodey was winning, Peter was right behind him. Clint and Bucky were losing majorly. Peter’s phone rang. The teen looked at the contact and his smile fell almost instantly.
“But I was right there! I could have saved her...But I couldn’t because I’m weak…” Peter said. “I’m stupid...I just stood there...I couldn’t move...I-” Peter stopped talking. The memories were vivid and clear in his mind.
The voices were less muffled now as the teen became more aware instead of trapped in his own mind. “She won’t be calling you again Peter. That’s for sure. We just need you to breathe buddy,” Tony said softly. Peter wanted to crawl in a corner and die. He was still shaking. Though breathing came slightly easier, it was still hard. His heart still pounded against his ribcage painfully. Peter was glad he stayed home that day. Otherwise, he would have been at school when that happened. And, the teen didn’t need or want that.
He woke up without his neck aching, or his eyes hurting, or that dizzy hollow feeling of sleep deprivation. He was warm, and relaxed...and his hand was resting against Steve’s arm.
“I love you, I love you so much,” Tony muttered incoherently against Steve’s neck, and he felt Steve’s arms tighten around him.
Thor opened the door cautiously. Miles was sitting on the floor with Peter, who was reading him a book. He was wearing a spidersuit just like Peter’s but with darker colors. He looked up to see Tony, Steve, Sam, Natasha, Clint and Thor and jumped to his feet.
Steve raised his eyebrows. He couldn't help a smug smile as he looked at Tony. "Oh, I think you can find a way to convince me."
"Wouldn't want him becoming a workaholic like his dad, now would we?" Steve said dryly, smiling at Tony.
Bucky seemed to ignore that and walked slowly into the room, glancing around. He stopped in front of the table and then leveled a look at Tony. "What is this."
"Then what the fuck is it about, Tony?" Rhodey asked impatiently. He'd come up the stairway to see Tony standing there in his armor on the roof, a scene they both knew usually only happened when Tony was drunk.
Tony shook himself awake and rolled over on top of Steve. “Not so fast.” He leaned down and kissed Steve on the mouth, pushing his shirt up over his chest. Steve moaned in surprise, arching his head back so Tony could kiss his neck.
Bruce had just finished his coffee. “I know the other guy congratulated you guys, but I want to, you know, as myself.”
“Come on,” Rhodey replied, rolling his eyes. “Even before you came out to me in college, I could tell...do you remember after you got your heart broken by Rumiko and we were out at a bar and we ran into my friend from the Air Force?”
Tony sighed. “And that used to be so cute. Steve, will you get our child down from the ceiling. I’m not tall enough for this shit.”
Tony glanced at Steve, who was pursing his lips. “No flying until you can drive, young man,” he decided.
“Bucky’s making pancakes,” Sam said, eyes wide. He looked down. “Okay, I’m just gonna…” He closed the door.
Tony shook his head vigorously, partly to reassure himself that he was awake and not imagining what Steve was suggesting. "What?! No." He squeezed Steve's shoulders and let his hands slide down the front of Steve's chest. "You sure you don't think this is moving too fast?"
“One week. One week without another alien invasion. That’s all I ask!” Clint grumbled to the Hulk, who he was perched on top of.
Tony smiled disarmingly. “Always so formal with you military types. For the last time, call me Tony.”
Janet flew over and landed, becoming her normal size again as she put on Sam’s googles. “What’s the plan?”
“Next time we adopt a child together let’s just give them your paperwork first. Worked like a charm,” Tony muttered, elbowing Steve in the ribs as they walked to Miles’ room. “We need to ask him first if it’s okay though. I…” He stopped, looking down at his hands.
He felt violated. The one thing he was supposed to tell Steve—in some other alternate version of events were things were okay between them—and now she knew it. He was ashamed that he could ever love Steve this much and not deserve his love in return. And he was supposed to be the only one who knew.
“Look, I don’t care when you were born. It’s the twenty-first century,” Tony snapped. “Are you telling me that it would bother you if Steve dated a guy?”
Steve bit his lip and tried to give Tony a serious look. “I don’t have enough to take you on a honeymoon, Tony. If anyone should be paying for the honeymoon it’s you.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve replied, waving Sam away as he offered the inhaler. “Enjoy this while it lasts.”
“Pepperrrr,” Tony groaned, rubbing his eyes with his hand. “I mean, everyone’s a little bit gay for Captain America—”
Steve’s back was pressed to Tony's chest, and Tony didn't know where to put his face, because nestling it tenderly at the back of Steve's neck seemed inappropriate.
Normally Tony would let whoever was intruding deal with the embarrassment of seeing him in bed with someone, man or woman—but there was something about how secretive he’d been about his feelings for Steve, even about sleeping in his room—that made Tony leap for his shirt and try to destroy any possible evidence of what they’d been doing.
Steve groaned and Tony glanced at him, thinking about what Bucky had said. Steve looked up, noticing Tony’s gaze.
“Just understand you’ve saved my life in more ways than one,” Steve said quietly. “I don't know what kind of man I'd be not to see that.”
There was dirt on Steve's helmet and face, and a satisfied smirk on his lips. He grabbed Tony's face and kissed him--kissed him hard like they were reuniting after a long separation and not just a battle, kissed him like they'd won, and they'd done it together.
“Uh, guys, there’s a lot of paperwork involved here,” Rhodey interjected. “It’s not guaranteed that either one of you could adopt him, even if you wanted to.”
“Tony, hey—” Steve stopped him, a hand on his shoulder. “When you came back from the lab earlier, that was the first time I saw him smile since we met him. I think I need you to do this with me.”
“If that’s what it takes,” Eve replied after a moment, and Tony reached up to hold the side of her face suddenly. Eve opened her mouth in surprise and then Tony kissed her, cupping the back of her waist and pulling her closer as she felt Eve’s lips part beneath hers.
But they were interrupted as Steve entered the room carrying Miles. “You fucking punk,” Bucky said with a huge smile. “Congratulations.”
“I know this has been really scary, but it’s safe now,” Jan said, reaching out to touch Miles’ shoulder.
“Thanks, Bucky,” Tony murmured, and Bucky squeezed his shoulder. Tony cleared his throat. “Sorry I assumed…”
Tony squinted at her. “I’m trying to seduce you here. I thought I was doing a pretty good job of it too.”
Peter clutches his hands to his chest. “Now that this is—now that—if you ever need a babysitter if you guys like, you know, need any alone time, I’m the guy to call! Me and Miles had a lot of fun, and I got him to bed on time and everything and—”
Bucky shrugged. “Better, I guess. You’ve been spending a lot of time with him too. What do you think?”
Steve was still not quite ready for battle, and Tony saw how much it frustrated him to be kept back while they were in the field. But he also knew that Steve was unwilling to go into the field before he was ready. He wouldn’t do it, not when Hydra still had that poison.
Tony didn't know how many hours later Steve returned, only that he did, and he looked worse than Tony felt. If that was even possible. His face was red, but drawn, and his expression hard as stone. He looked tired as the grave.
Tony narrowed her eyes. “Yeah, I’m not a prude. You should try it sometime. Having fun. Look, you just seem like you’re going crazy cooped up in here. Get out more. It’d be good for you.”
Tony spread his arms defensively. “No, I have no idea. All I see are his gorgeous blue eyes and handsome face and his broad shoulders and I’m just—”
“It’s just too much,” Steve finished, looking up sadly at him. “Being next to you, but not really having you at all.” Tony looked at him in confusion. “I know it’s selfish. You need me too, and I-I want to be here for you. But I can’t do it anymore.” He looked away. “I can’t stand having you just out of my reach, and—
It was a large room with concrete walls, boxes of what seemed to be weapons stacked along the sides. In the center of the room was a chair, the man in it unmistakable. Red Skull rose to his feet. A flash of anger and surprise darted across his face.
—” He stopped, cutting off the anger in his voice. “I guess you didn’t know.” Tony’s heart wrenched at the guilt in Steve’s voice. “But I just need you to know I wouldn't—”
“Clint, what do you know about ladies,” Natasha murmured, smiling as she kissed him on the cheek. Clint shrugged and started blushing as he grinned at her.
. Tony held the side of his face and all of a sudden Steve was melting into him, wrapping his arms around him, breathing out a deep sigh like all he'd ever really wanted was to do this, and that was really not something Tony could process, not while his lips were glued to Steve's, and Steve was holding him like he really loved him and had loved him all this time. Tony felt like he needed to pinch himself or slap himself across the face. Hard. Because it was still too much to believe. He sighed into the kiss because he was going to damn well enjoy it even if he didn't understand it.
Steve looked small on the hospital bed, the breathing apparatus, IV and other machines dwarfing him and casting a faint shadow over his face. His eyes were closed. His chest rose and fell slowly, but just that little movement was enough to make Tony's heart ache with relief so strong he wanted to yell.
“I know you are.” She placed a hand on his shoulder and Tony put his hand over it. He had missed her after they broke up—he had missed her so much. It had been a long time since he didn’t have that hollow feeling in his chest of missing someone.
Miles breathed out a sigh. “It’s just…if someone has my abilities and chooses not to use them, they’re responsible for bad things happening, you know? I want to do something, and—”
Tony scoffed in mock irritation as Sam flew Miles out of the room. “I’m the fun dad,” he called. “Steve is the…Steve.” He waved at Steve, who raised his eyebrows and tried not to laugh.
Steve sighed and nodded, seeming to accept what Tony was saying. “So, if you feel that way, why would you try to shut me out?”
Steve let out a laugh. "Not that kind of chance. I mean, after I put the plane in the water, after I lost my chance with Peggy." He looked away. "I thought I'd never have it again...a normal life, maybe even a family." Tony pulled Steve closer, unsure of what to say, but Steve continued, resting his hands over Tony's.  "When I woke up in this era, I had no one, I had nothing. You gave me a home." He looked up into Tony's eyes again. "I'm not very good at this, but that's what I wanted to say."
He hadn’t asked his teammates before he did it. The thought that they might be disappointed in him had crossed his mind, but he didn’t care anymore. He still believed they needed some oversight--but not when Steve might die for this. Never. Nothing was worth Steve's life.
“Cap? You want the pistachio, don’t you.” Steve nodded and Tony grinned. “Miles, just so you know, pistachio is an old person flavor.” Miles put a hand over his mouth as he giggled. “And I’ll have coffee, please.”
Wanda snarled, finally separating Pietro from Red Skull in the next instant. As Bucky, Steve, Natasha and Sam converged on Red Skull, Wanda landed by Pietro.
Now it was empty. Tony got up and slumped down into the couch with a drink. It was moments like this, when he was tired and looking into the bottom of a glass and couldn’t help himself, that he missed Steve the most. And he hated it, and he hated himself for it.
Tony grinned and took out his phone. “Easy, Thor. No punching—not yet anyway. I’ve got to make a call.”
He pulled Steve down into a kiss, and Steve moaned quietly as Tony pushed his shirt up to his chest. "It's not a big deal anyway, baby," Tony murmured. "Not unless you think it is."
? The terror of the dream still gripped him as he tried to make himself aware of his surroundings--of Steve. He knew Steve knew plenty about survivor's guilt.
“You realize in the span of 30 seconds you just divorced me and then asked me to marry you again,” Steve asked, and Tony kissed him on the cheek.
Might be true in time--it had taken time for him to be able to think about Pepper and not instantly want to get blackout drunk. It still hurt a bit even now to remember the time they had together, if he was being honest. Time could heal this thing over Steve...but right now all he could think was that sounded like such a lie.
Tony woke up with a start, still wedged under Steve. Steve immediately moved backwards just a little to give him more room.
At some point he saw the guard’s signal and he put 100% into the repulsors. He wasn’t sure what happened first. He was at Steve’s side in an instant, shielding his body with the armor. The gunshot struck and ricocheted off the armor and then he turned to see one of the guards raise his gun and point it directly at them. He grabbed Steve with one arm and turned to block him with his body, sent a repulsor blast at the guard, but not before he released the fatal shot.
Tony blasted a Hydra agent who whose gun was trained on Natasha as she scaled up the far wall. Pietro narrowly managed to duck a man swinging at his head before Tony blasted the man too.
“Come on.” Steve put Tony’s arm around his shoulders and held him up by the waist. Tony’s room was close to Miles’ so it wasn’t long before Tony finally slumped down onto his bed.
Tony took a step forward cautiously, his heart racing, and glanced down at Steve’s mouth before he could stop himself, then up to meet his eyes. “If it didn’t mean anything…” he started, hoping his voice wasn’t trembling. “Can we…”
doesn’t die easy. At some point I started not wanting to go back in the ice. I had a family. And then, the courthouse…I’m not ready to die, not anymore. I'm not done."
It’d been after Pepper left him, Tony remembered. She’d left before he really became a wreck. He was grateful for that.
Tony rolled her eyes. “I’m sure there are even some young men who’d find you attractive even if you are the dull soldierly type.”
Tony opened his mouth to speak. “You were in the ice but we couldn't wake you up...” His voice cracked and he stopped abruptly. “I was just there watching—”
“I should have told you,” Tony repeated lamely, his voice catching in his throat, and then kissed Steve on the mouth.
Suddenly a bolt of lightning struck the landing strip outside the window and Thor appeared, wearing full armor. He strode towards the door and flung it open, then grabbed Tony and Steve and pulled them into a big hug.
“I did everything I could,” Tony said, pleading, trying to convince himself as much as her. “I swear to God, I—”
Miles was curled up, still in his spider PJs. Tony smiled and turned to Steve. “You know, Miles wants to be a superhero because of you. No matter what people say about you, people are always going to be inspired by you too, because that’s what you do. You make people want to be the best version of themselves.”
They all woke up around noon. After a long night of fighting, no one was prepared to do anything that day. Especially not Tony, who was feeling the bumps and bruises much more acutely now.
Rhodey and Natasha came in and collapsed on the sofas and Tony got to his feet and ran into the living room. It had been another late night mission. They had learned the hard way that they had to take turns fighting these battles.
It went on like that, for a while. He worked and slept. He started to sleep better. A few times he woke up with his hand brushing against Steve’s shoulder or elbow, but for the most part they didn’t touch.
He forgot what he was doing, then remembered, he was texting Pepper. He fiddled with his phone. Before he could mentally yell at himself for not making up his mind, the door to his lab opened and he sprang up.
Pietro was struggling against the magic that had hit him, but it looked like he was trapped under an immense weight. He had moved his finger maybe a few inches in the time they'd been talking.
When the meeting was finally over everyone stood up and shuffled towards the door. Tony tried to find Steve, but he had disappeared. Before he knew it, he was the last one in the room with Fury.
“No, I’m good,” Tony said replied with a forced smile, and he heard Sam begin to laugh behind him. Natasha was smiling. They all needed a laugh. He turned to see Steve standing next to Sam, a small smile on his face. He had just come back from his own training with Sam and Bucky.
Tony hummed his acknowledgement. When he sat down, Steve rested his hand on Tony's shoulder like it was suddenly the most ordinary thing in the world, but that simple gesture made Tony's stomach turn over. He reached up to rest his hand over Steve's and held it there.
He decided that it wasn’t a question he wanted answered, and stayed out of Steve’s way. Natasha started spending time helping Sam and Bucky with their diligent effort at making sure Steve ate enough and got what exercise he could manage. They took turns watching over Steve at night, but Tony slept better at his bedside than anywhere else. It didn’t take long for it to happen again—the nightmare where Steve was lying dead on the courthouse steps. Only this time he was trying to say something before he died, struggling to form words as life left his eyes, his hand grasping, frantic, at Tony's shoulder.
Tony grinned and bit his lip, sliding his hands appreciatively up Steve's arms and then down his chest. "Fair enough, Rogers."
Tony wiped his tears away quickly. “Makes two of us,” he spat out, instantly hating how bitter the words tasted in his mouth.
“Whoa,” Rhodey said with a laugh. “You don’t know he’s straight. He could be just as much of an idiot as you are and never got the courage to do anything about it.”
He kissed Miles on the forehead and pulled Steve after him out onto the balcony. He cleared his throat, suddenly nervous.
The mixture of aggravation, affection and arousal in Steve's voice was enough to make Tony's head spin, and really, why was he trying to talk Steve
“Fuck,” Tony muttered, and Steve pulled him down by his collar of his shirt for another kiss. It was slow this time, unhurried. Steve cupped the back of his head, still running his fingers through Tony’s hair after they pulled apart.
Steve lifted him effortlessly to his feet and Tony stumbled after him back to bed. He crumpled onto the mattress, rolled onto his side, drying his tears and looking away from Steve. Steve put a hand tentatively on his shoulder and Tony flinched.
"It'll be good to have you." The soft warm smile Steve gave Tony was not lost on him, and even though it only lasted a moment, the warmth it sent through Tony lasted a
Suddenly shy, Miles walked cautiously over to Thor and solemnly shook the Asgardian’s giant hand. He pulled off his mask as Steve picked him up.
He took Tony’s hand and pulled it over his side as he turned his back again. Tony’s heart thudded in his chest and he closed his eyes and then opened them--Steve brought his hand all the way around to hold his waist, pulling Tony closer, and then lifted his shoulders, as if he expected Tony to put his arm underneath. So Tony wrapped his other arm around Steve and felt him settle back down with another sigh.
Jan put her hands to her mouth. Miles covered eyes as he started crying, and Steve looked at Tony before taking a step forward. He took off his helmet.
Tony let out a laugh and threw a pillow belligerently at Steve, who threw it back at him. “You’re the worst, Rogers.”
The last of the Time Stone's energy faded from him, withering his body until it fell apart and became smoke. Steve watched the smoke dissipate with a hard look on his face, then glanced sideways at Bucky. Bucky clasped his shoulder and breathed out a sigh.
Steve grinned and waved to them before giving Miles a little kiss on the forehead and going downstairs. Tony slumped down and stared into his coffee cup.
Tony felt a hollow feeling in his chest. He knew Natasha had been close to him. Here they were again, feeling the same thing.
He busied himself by making Steve breakfast. He remembered exactly how he liked his eggs, and hoped Steve wouldn't think it was awful that be could make him breakfast like they hadn't just been on opposing sides of a war.
“And then I realized that it wasn’t worth your life,” Tony replied, raising his voice. “Hell, you gave yourself up to the police. Don’t talk to me about giving up the cause—”
Something in Tony snapped. “NOTHING is more important to me right now than you,” he said, whirling to face Steve. “Definitely not some stupid document. But that didn’t stop me from almost getting you killed." He buried his face in his hands, unable to look at any of them. “I’m sorry, Steve, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he whispered. He felt a hand on his, and looked up.
Miles paused and then nodded vigorously, his eyes lighting up. “Are you--are you gonna teach me how to build one? Can we make a big one? My mom always said that I was really good, and I want to make one that can run up and down walls and do all these crazy things and—”
what I want, Tony,” Steve replied earnestly. “And I’m not…any good at any of this without you, either,” he added, and allowed himself a small smile. “After everything, I’m just I’m lucky that you still want this.”
He collapsed on his work table, alone for the first time in over a week. It wasn’t worry for Steve, or guilt, or shame that was foremost in his mind, it was exhaustion. He could barely lift his head when he heard the knock on the door.
Rhodey pulled Tony into a hug and then squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “Congratulations, you guys. I’m proud of you.”
Tony came forward and knelt down beside Steve, his heart aching in his chest. “Hey Miles,” he said quietly. “I’m Tony. And this is Steve—he’s one of the best we’ve got. You’re safe with us. We promise nothing’s gonna happen to you.”
“And then all I had to do was change the pattern to fit him and voila, mini Spiderman!” Peter explained as he walked in between Tony and Steve. “He picked out the color scheme and everything.”
Pepper shook her head. “Tony, you look exhausted. When was the last time you got a full night’s sleep? In a bed?”
Steve let go of him and slowly stripped his shirt off over his head, looking Tony in the eye. “Come and get it.”
Steve stood up and helped Tony to his feet. “I miss training with you. Spend less time in your lab and more time on the mats and you’ll get an edge on me in no time.”
“You should be,” Peter started. “You have every right to be…,” Peter’s tone was quiet, breakable. He sniffed, bringing up an arm to wipe the tears that strayed from his eyes. “I broke my promise...I...I-” Peter cut off with a sob. Natasha sat on the edge of the bed. Her facial expression was soft.
After dinner, I went back to my room to finish my homework. I don’t know how much longer I worked on it before my eyelids started getting heavy. I yawned, stretching my aching muscles. I took out my suit and told Friday to let Tony know that I was going out.
The rest of the morning went by smoothly. They had breakfast talking happily amongst themselves, no one brought up Peter’s panic attack from earlier in the morning. Peter hung out with Steve and Bucky most of the day. Peter had grown on Bucky in just the little time they spent training.
It was the middle of the night when Tony heard a noise from Steve’s room. He opened the door to see Steve pale, sitting up in bed, coughing. He rushed to his side.
Tony helped him to the elevator, still holding him up as he leaned against the wall. He felt panic flaring up in his chest. His throat felt raw from all the crying. Out of earshot of the others, Tony murmured, “Hey, you know what, I’ll let Sam switch out for me, how’s that? I know I’m probably the last person you want to see right now. I’ll…go, as soon as we get back.”
“There’s no good reason,” Tony replied. “You just have to understand that’s it not your fault. I know a thing or two about absent fathers. You can’t blame yourself, okay Miles? Maybe one day your father will realize that he made a huge mistake. But…right now you have me and Pops who love you, and Uncle Rhodey and Sam and Bucky and Aunty Nat and I don’t think you’ve met Thor yet but you’re going to love Thor, and…you’ve got a whole family now to take care of you. We’re going to keep you safe.”
After Tony was satisfied that the building was empty and that they could make a safe exit, and that Pietro wasn't going to pass out, he picked his way across the ruined floor of the building as quickly as he could. Steve dropped is shield and pulled him into his arms and for a while they just held each other. Even through the armor it felt incredible. The dust was still settling around them.
"No you don't, Tony," Wanda replied. He followed her gaze to Pietro, who was just getting into the quinjet as they approached.
. He sat up slowly, wincing, and fumbled for his phone. Where the hell was everyone? Panic settled back into his stomach.
Tony narrowed her eyes. “Okay, Rogers.” She grinned at Eve and pulled her into a deep kiss, taking her time as her hands ran up the soldier’s muscular back to cup the back of her head. She finally broke away and glanced down at Eve’s mouth, which she planned on getting much more used to kissing. “It’s a deal.”
Tony sighed. “I’m trying, but have you seen this guy?” He turned back to Steve, who had pulled his shirt over his head. Tony felt himself blushing and forgot all the jabs he was going to make at Steve and did his best not to stare.
Tony felt hot and cold, pins and needles like he was going to faint. He lay down quickly with head against the arm of the couch and closed his eyes. “No, no, that’s not—what do you mean, missing?”
Which, of course, was impossible, Tony realized, as Steve, dazed, finally managed to pull his too-tight shirt back down over his chest.
Peter looked up again, the eyes on his mask widening. “Really? Does this mean I’m the official Avengers babysitter?”
Tony raised her eyebrows and shrugged, absently running a hand through her short hair and hoping she didn’t look too scruffy. “Nothing, Cap. Still testing those laboratory muscles of yours? You know, they’re just as good as they were before the whole saving New York thing.”
They pulled apart, and Tony had to take a deep breath to recover. "I could get used to this. After a battle. Calms my nerves."
to hear those words and he closed his eyes, letting himself relax against Steve, like a coiled spring gradually releasing. “I missed you too."
Tony shrugged and glanced at Steve, then looked away, grinning. Bucky wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and ruffled his hair. “
They were going to take him to court. They had won. So why did Tony feel so hollow? He scrolled down and stopped cold. There was a picture of the court, the steps...he recognized it. Above it read the title “
Steve pulled away, breathing a little harder, and glanced down at Tony's mouth. "You'd tell me if I was terrible at this, wouldn't you? It's...been a while."
“All those things...all the things I said and did--I'm--I'm so, so sorry. I know that's not enough, but I hope you will allow me the chance to earn your friendship back. I don't deserve it...I just hope you'll let me, if that’s what you really want. I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you. And that's the truth.”
Natasha jumped to her feet at the sound of footsteps, and Tony stood stiffly as Clint, Sam and Bucky walked towards them down the hospital corridor. God, they weren’t ready for this, he wasn’t ready for this.
“I don’t have any hiding places left,” Steve breathed out, sitting down on the side of the bed. Wanda stood in the doorway—she had been up on her feet for a few days now.
Tony did, and Rhodey agreed it probably wasn't the best idea to sleep in his bed. He looked so sad and concerned that Tony wished he hadn't confessed any of it in the first place. But Rhodey was right, and Tony figured he should break it off with Steve.
Sam came in. He looked at Tony, how his face was smudged with grease, then around at the chaos of his lab.
Tony shrugged. “Your choice.” She stretched her arms above her head and let out a sigh as she walked back to her work table. “Just another week. May as well make something of it. I guess you are an old fogey though.” Tony smiled to herself—she could practically hear the look of exasperation on Eve’s face.
Sam frowned, shaking his head and then stifled a laugh as Miles kicked him accidentally with his foot. “Nope. Haven’t seen him, technically speaking.”
“If you don’t want me to run the story, I don’t have to,” Karen added. “If you wanted to keep out of the press a little longer—”
Tony looked away from Bucky, turning to Steve. “What do you want? If you want to hide out in Stark Tower, you’re more than welcome. I’ll make myself scarce.”
She had flown to New York immediately, a whole fourteen hours from Seoul. Tony didn’t remember how much money he had promised her but it had been a lot. He had almost forgotten about calling her until she appeared in the dark room and taken his body. It was an afterthought. Tony had already given up.
Tony smiled at that. Carol watched his smile fade slowly until he had given up on the attempt entirely, and said, "Tony, you can't control what he does. You've done what you can."
“I love you,” Steve said, unable to look at him, his shoulders crumpled and his voice unsteady. He looked like he had been shattered. “I’ve loved you for years, before…”
Tony still hadn’t told anyone about it. He’d gotten so close to telling Pepper. He hadn't seen her since she’d visited, and they only spoke briefly on the phone. It was on the tip of his tongue, but he never managed to say it.
“It’s not just Miles I’m worried about.” Steve paused and took a deep breath. “It’s everything we’ve done…together, everything we’ve….”
“Sleep, Tony,” Rhodey reminded him, and Tony looked up. Rhodey motioned with his head to Pepper, who stood behind him, a worried expression badly disguised on her face.
“No,” Steve replied, signaling Tony to stand down. “I’m fine, Tony. Whatever hit me was small. I’m betting it was just a kid.”
Rhodey glanced at Tony thoughtfully. “It’s okay, man.” Tony raised his eyebrows and Rhodey shook his head. “You don’t have to do this with me.”
Tony looked away from Bucky’s piercing gaze. “Talk later, metal man.” He knocked his knuckles against Bucky’s prosthetic arm and Bucky followed him humorously with his eyes as he walked off the mat.
“What scares me more is the idea that maybe none of this would’ve happened. If we had never found him after the battle, or if we had but we hadn’t been able to adopt him…”
Steve turned and surveyed the rest of the Avengers. "I know we're all anxious to get out and kick some Nazi ass, but are you guys gonna be okay sitting this one out?"
“The war was killing me, Steve,” Tony said, afraid to look at his face. The silence that followed was somehow worse.
Tony groaned. “What, am I supposed to have planned this since I was ten? Make lists of names if I have a boy or a girl? Because guess what, Steve, this one already has a name.”
“So…maybe I just wanted to tell you again,” Tony said, spreading his arms defensively. “It was my last chance. I thought.”
“Congratulations, Captain,” Thor continued. “I truly am happy for you both.” He slapped Tony’s shoulder again.
Steve Rogers was feeling it for the first time. And that made Tony feel so irrationally angry and so relieved and so sad and so full of utter self loathing--
“No.” Tony blushed as he glanced at Steve as he stepped out of his suit. “Oh. Uh. Yeah, you know actually it’s our anniversary, buddy. That’s why…” He motioned between himself and Steve. “All the smiling and blushing.”
“On a beautiful summer day, you’ll find a lot of families enjoying ice cream and the view of the New York skyline down by the water, but Tony Stark, Steve Rogers and their son Miles are one family you might not expect. Stark and Rogers met as Avengers; their partnership developed from friendship into love over the years, and they were recently married in a private ceremony. After the devastation caused by Galactus, Stark and Rogers adopted the orphaned Miles Morales. Meeting them for the first time, I was struck by the fact that two of New York’s most famous superheroes do what everyone else does on a Sunday afternoon—spend time with their family. Their son Miles is shy but extremely sweet, and even at five years old it’s easy for Rogers to lift him up onto his shoulders. It is a relief to know that for the people risking their lives to keep New York safe, to whom we owe so much, there is such a thing as a happy ending. According to Stark, their marriage…”
Tony grumbled and moved over slightly. Steve’s shoulder was warm against his. “If I steal the covers, don’t let it end our fake marriage, okay honey?”
Tony didn’t realize he hadn’t taken off his suit until Pepper reminded him. They were waiting outside Steve’s room. Pepper tried to stifle her gasp when she saw all the scrapes and bruises and Tony wished for the hundredth time she didn’t have to see him like this. It had been bad enough when they were together.
“I’m trying,” Steve said, and he sounded like he'd had the life drained out of him. “God, am I trying.”
After that, the security forces had appeared, Tony remembered, but not in time to catch the shooter. Steve was carried away. Tony stood in shock, unable to move.
They were tangled together like they usually were in the morning, and Tony was pleasantly warm, half in between sleeping and waking. He sighed, melting against Steve, hoping that it could last a little longer, he brushed his hand down to Steve’s waist, accidentally catching the bare skin below the hem of his shirt. Steve started under his touch. He looked down at Tony, sleepy, arms wrapped around him. Tony looked up at him in confusion.
“I know, but I want to do everything at the right pace, like you said, and one day, when it’s the right time…”
"Captain America. Feeling better after the poison, I see," he hissed. "I had hoped that making it with the power of an Infinity Stone would defeat you once and for all."
Rhodey picked up the paper and looked at it. Tony figured that he and Steve really did look like a married couple in the picture, with Steve’s hand resting over his. He winced.
“Yeah, you’re right, you’re a prude,” Tony shot back. “Every woman in New York wants to sleep with you, and probably half the men, but you—what, you want to be fake married to ME of all people?”
Steve’s cheeks turned pink and he smiled. “Not technically. I mean, you’ve taken me to dinner plenty of times.”
“This is already my second batch,” Bucky explained, pointing to Thor, who was probably on his fifth cup of coffee and was finishing up a large number of baked goods.
Tony laughed in surprise. “You already are.” He looked up at Steve, who was smiling slightly. “But yeah… of course you can.” He shared another glance with Steve and Steve nodded. “We’ll train you,” Tony finished. “But no vigilante-ing until you’re at least sixteen, okay?”
Steve raised his eyebrows, smiling, but then he continued. "It's...not just that. You tease me all the time about being 90 and being--"
Tony squeezed his hand. "Well I couldn't just leave you there in the ice, all dressed up with no place to go," he joked, but his eyes were serious. After a moment he said, "Finding you was the best day of my life. Or at least...it used to be." That was before he had a son--before he even considered what it would be like to have his own family--and before Captain America decided Steve Rogers still had one more chance at a normal life.
And after that, Tony somehow wound up keeping a watch over Steve every night, until it became part of the routine. Sam didn’t ask him about it, he just let him be.
Steve was looking at him hard, and Tony had a hard time resisting him when he was like this. He looked away, and then down at his hands. He nodded. “I won’t shut you out.” God, he had never really wanted to.
The reason they had gotten into this argument in the first place. “There’s no going back to how things were,” Tony stated flatly.
Tony whirled to see Bucky elbowing a guy in the face, and then knocking him out with a quick strike of the end of his gun. But the noise of the man's yell was drawing more attention.
“After Nat was done dragging me across the mat." They both knew what he’d been doing in the lab, but they didn’t talk about it. With a poison that powerful, Hydra was even more of a dangerous enemy than before. Even a small dose had nearly killed Steve, and when it didn’t, put him out of commission for a long time. They’d all sleep easier once they had a lead.
Nat had just thrown Tony for probably the hundredth time on the mat. He groaned and got up, massaging his shoulder.
“But you’re here, and I can’t talk to you, and it’s almost worse than if we didn’t talk at all, if you didn’t even look at me—”
Not even Peggy, even though she was alive, and he knew that had broken Steve’s heart, knowing everything he had missed out on, everything that could have been.
Steve shrugged and gave that buoyant relaxed smile. "I think...I think I did.” He was silent for a moment. “I'll always be afraid of losing this life we've made. But afraid of that poison? Not anymore. Not with an antidote. It helps that Red Skull is dead. I'm not gonna lie, it felt
Bucky walked into the living room, throwing his jacket down on a chair. “Uh, guys? There’s a kid playing in Hulk’s room. Do you know about this?”
“This early in the morning? After you just went on a run?” Tony asked in disbelief. “Ugh, you’re horrible. Maybe in a bit. Keyword being maybe.”
He stared at Steve’s face as if he could will him alive again. “I thought I knew what the worst thing would be,” he reasoned, “I thought I’d be ready. For the end. And now the worst thing has happened. The thing I can’t live with…has happened.” The tears drying on his cheeks felt cold.
The next chapter will be posted soon I hope, since it's almost done. It will be about as long as this one. Edit: it's up!!
Sure, they kept bumping their noses into each other, and kissed until they couldn’t breathe, and all Tony’s attempts at dirty talk failed because Steve kept telling him to stop talking. “You’re no fun,” Tony gasped, as he ground his cock against Steve’s, watching Steve’s abdomen tense as he breathed under the rhythm of Tony’s hand. Steve telling him to shut the fuck up as he lay there panting, gorgeous and messy, made Tony want to joke about something better to do with his mouth, but there would be plenty of time to blow Steve later--
Tony gritted his teeth and threw his phone on the floor, sitting up straighter. There had been so much red in his dream. A stream of scarlet. It had to be Wanda.
"He's...okay I think," Wanda breathed, shaken, looking into Pietro's panicked, frozen eyes. "But it's like Red Skull just
“How did I fuck myself over this badly?” Tony asked, turning abruptly to Rhodey. He could always count on Rhodey to see through 100% of his bullshit, and in a way it was a relief to talk about it with him. “He’s one of my best friends, who I’ve known for years, and is a minimum of 150% straight, and now I’m being forced to live a life of fake marital bliss—”
"As long as the Avengers exist, I wouldn't be too sure of that. You don't scare me. You already tried killing me, and you failed," Steve said. Tony thought he sounded beyond pissed off that Red Skull was still alive and talking.
“S-sorry Mr. Harris. I’ll do better,” I said. He nodded in approval, I took my leave. There goes my semi-good mood. All my teachers think I’m a slacker. So, when I got home, I stayed in my room doing all my homework and not letting anyone in.
Tony was a mess…..well, they all were. One minute, Peter was okay, he was laughing, smiling, talking, having fun. And the next...he was attempting suicide. They knew he was broken, but none of them realized the true extent of his pain. Bruce was just barely keeping his cool as he watched over Peter.
My mind was screaming at me, the voices never left. They were a constant in my mind, never-ending insults and hate against myself. Everything that’s been happening these past several months was still at the front of my mind. I wanted to forget about it all, but that was proving hard, impossible even. As I sat at the table I poked at the sandwich on the plate.
When I came to...well more like became aware, I heard a persistent beeping sound. Then, with great fear and something else I couldn’t describe, I realized I was still alive. The beeping sped up along with the beating of my heart. Suddenly there were voices, thick with worry. “Pete, it’s okay. You’re okay.” The voice, oddly familiar. Everything came back to me, smacking me in the face hard. Tony finding me, trying to commit suicide. I couldn’t breathe. I tried to commit suicide...and I failed...I’m a failure.
Peter and Clint were best friends. They would prank together, laugh, be happy. Nothing could tear those two apart. They were inseparable mischief makers.
“I guess...after my Uncle Ben passed away…” I said. Even though it’d been a while ago, the memory was still fresh in my mind. “Aunt May….she was never the same after that…”
“Wh’re? W’at ‘appned?” The teen’s words slurred with grogginess. Tony opened his mouth to explain, but before he could even utter a single word, Peter was already hyperventilating again. Eyes wide with pain, fear, and hurt.
“You aren’t doing so well in class right now you’re sitting at a D. I want that back up to an A. I know it’s hard with everything that’s going on, but school is important as well. You were doing so well first quarter. Show me that you actually care about your grades.”
“Who are you? And why the hell are you calling me at-” I paused to look at the clock. “-four thirty in the morning?”
I felt better this morning than I did yesterday as I got ready for school. I really didn’t want to go, but I knew I needed to. I grabbed my notebook and newly finished homework and put them in my bag. I headed to the kitchen to grab a quick breakfast. I poured my cereal in a bowl and ate. Then Happy took me to school.
“The guys who shot you were lucky you’re the walking definition of a human disaster,” Bucky interrupted. He hauled Steve to his feet. “Come on, we’re going for a walk. Don’t wimp out on me, Rogers. Nauseated?”
“We were outgunned,” Natasha added and Tony almost jumped. “It’s weird,” she continued, in a pensive voice, “Clint usually pairs up with Wanda, but I guess they’re switching their teams.”
“I just wanted to say…Steve needs you. Maybe he doesn’t make it very clear.” Sam looked down. “You know, there’s something he used to say. ‘If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this together.’ That can still be true.” He looked back at Tony.
"I know…it must have been tough, waking up to a completely different world, and you couldn’t go back—I-I can’t even imagine how much. But we’ll fight him together, send him back where he belongs, if that can make anything better—”
Natasha gave him a rare smile--not one of her bittersweet ones but a real one--and leaned her head against his shoulder.
“I don’t know,” Steve replied. “It could take a while, but it just seems unfair to the kid to make him wait for something permanent, and then just to be uprooted from one place to another.”
"Fuck, Steve, we--" Tony panted, and looked down at Steve’s lips, still parted and slightly pink from kissing.
The poison still in Steve's body affected him in fits of pain, nausea, difficulty breathing. It was hard to tell which were conditions caused by the poison or the serum being repressed. It was disturbing for Tony to see Steve reluctant to even go on a walk, but he was grateful that Sam and Bucky were just as concerned as he was. It almost felt like he wasn't needed. Which was fine.
“Not a perfect soldier, but a good man,” Tony said quietly, and he knew it was mean. He knew and he said it anyway. “That’s how it goes right?”
“Dad,” Miles complained. “I want to fight bad guys now. I know, I know, I’ll wait until I’m older, but—”
But sometimes Tony wanted to hold Steve just to feel how good it felt, not because he was a mess. Tony cursed inwardly and turned over, his back brushing against Steve’s shoulder. He was suddenly extremely grateful that he had never told Rhodey or Pepper any of this because he was sure they would think this was a huge mistake.
It was just your run of the mill alien invasion. Fury wanted them split up into two teams, one for each arm of the attack. Steve, the Hulk, Clint, Nat and Bucky would be on the ground while Tony, Rhodey, Sam, Carol, Jan and Thor took the sky.
Steve easily got an armbar and then helped Tony to his feet. Tony used that moment to take him off guard and trip him but in a moment he had already lost his position and Steve had pinned him again.
Steve sat down on the couch behind him, and Tony hammered the piece of armor in front of him until it was flattened. The hammer blows died away into silence.
“Okay,” Tony replied, and then leaned in to give him a small kiss on the mouth. He still couldn't believe this was real as they pulled apart and he squeezed Steve’s shoulder.
“No, it’s not.” Steve hands tightened, hanging by his belt. “Everything’s different now…if something happened to you…”
The hunt for Red Skull continued.  They found a few Hydra outposts, but the raids brought back no new information. After receiving new intel that Natasha collected, Tony, Carol and Sam were somehow never fast enough to reach the new location in time before everything had been cleared out. Tony got immense satisfaction from how well the three of them worked as a team, but it was overshadowed by the frustration of chasing leads over and over and over and coming up empty-handed.
He looked at her and sighed. "Last time all of us we were on a battlefield together...well, you know."
“Like I said, I was gone for FIVE minutes…” Bucky leaned forward, lowering his voice. “Are...you and Steve…”
Steve took his hand and pulled it to his own chest, closing his eyes. “Tony…” Tony looked at him in confusion, his heart leaping frantically in his chest. Not Stark.
Eventually Carol sent them all to bed. "You're heading out in the early morning. I suggest you all get a few hours of sleep."
"You know that's not all we are,” Steve said, still smiling. “We're teammates, we're friends, we're...well, sometimes you infuriate me so much I want to kiss you just to see the shocked look on your face, sure."
“Don’t call me that.” Well, there went that idea. “I’m not yours,” Steve said stiffly, and Tony was right back to panicking. He should never have let Steve pull him into his bed, not when he felt the way he did about him. There was nothing about that that wasn’t dishonest as fuck.
time," Steve interrupted. "Wanda was right: time’s caught up with you.” With that, he punched Red Skull hard across the face.
They boarded the quinjet in the dark hours before dawn, and Tony felt too wired for the battle ahead to feel any exhaustion, too distracted by memories of last night to feel properly nervous.
Tony held him for a long time. Although Steve's tears were almost over before they started, Tony didn’t want to let him go. After some time, Steve shifted.
Natasha’s eyes flickered up to Tony. “Ever since Ultron, he kind of took her under his arm. I just noticed that she wasn’t there, that’s all.”
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Helen continued. “His body completely shut down, but it’s still fighting the poison. It’s my hope that I can strengthen his immune system enough that he can fight it on his own.”
Steve nodded at both of them with gratefulness. Then he glanced to Tony, almost shyly, across the room. "Our first mission together since...well, since we stopped being a team. What do you say?"
Tony composed himself and turned back to look at Steve. He had to sell this lie convincingly, because he wasn’t ready to tell the truth. “I wanted to tell you…that you’re the best man I’ve ever known. That I care about our friendship. That I’m sorry.”
“A hostile?” Tony landed next to him, raising his repulsors. “Are you okay? It’s not like Galactus to have sidekicks.”
Steve stood frozen for a moment. Then he seemed to make a decision and came to Tony’s side. He knelt down between his legs on the floor and pulled him into his arms. Tony let out a shuddering sigh and dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve rubbed his back gently, his hand eventually settling around Tony’s shoulders, squeezing slightly. They sat like that for a while, until Steve’s voice finally brought Tony back to reality.
“What is wrong with me…?” Peter whispered brokenly, the teen got up and found a bottle of pills He opened the cap and poured as many as he could fit in his hands. He grabbed a cup of water and downed the ones in his hands. Peter began to feel slightly lightheaded as the pills ran through his system. He downed another small handful. His thoughts were beginning to become mottled. He fell to the ground unable to keep himself up anymore. His hand was still bleeding, the blade being clenched in his hand causing the cut to become bigger.
“Karen, what’s going on tonight? Anything?” I asked her. She responded with ‘no’. I was a calm night in New York. I landed on a building, it didn’t take me long to see a girl on the edge. She looked like she was about to jump, I heard faint crying. “Hey,” I said softly so I didn’t scare her. She whipped herself around to face me. “Why don’t you come away from the ledge..?”
Peter sat down at the table. “Thanks, Aunt May,” He said. He took a couple of bites and then jumped up. “I’m going to be late for school. See you, Aunt May.”
Hands grabbed at his wrists, pulling his hands off his head. Arms wrapped around him. A voice cooed softly in his ears. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me!” the teen yelled in anguish. “Cause there’s obviously something wrong because people don’t just freak out for no reason do they?!”
“There’s nothing to tell,” was what I said. ‘I just really wanna die or just disappear from the face of the earth’. Was what I wanted to say.
I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to see them, but I didn’t want them to be angry. I knew they’d be angry at me. Steve left the room.
Peter woke up...or more like, he jumped up. He couldn’t remember the nightmare, but he knew it was bad. Peter dug through his bag and got out his Spiderman suit. “Friday, don’t tell anyone I’m leaving,” The teen said quietly.
“We know…” Natasha’s voice was teary. “But, that’s why we’re here. You don’t have to go through this alone.”
Peter opened his eyes, laid in bed for a few more minutes and decided to get up. ‘Nothing is wrong. I have to show them that,’ he thought. Begrudgingly, the teen slipped out of the warm covers.
The phone was taken out of a shaking Peter’s hands. “He will not be coming home. And if you EVER call him again…” Tony said.
The school day was very long for Peter. Flash kept uttering words of insult that Peter tried his hardest to ignore. The final bell finally rang. Peter shut his locker, locked it, and walked outside. Happy, of course, was there to pick him up. But he didn’t look very happy about it.
As soon as Peter finished his homework, he went to the kitchen. There were several unopened bottles of wine on the counter. There were at least empty bottles in the trashcan. Bottle caps littered the once clean counter. The teenager sighed to himself and began cleaning up. Organizing the bottles, throwing empty ones along with their caps in the trash. Peter then grabbed a wash rag and wet it under the faucet and wiped down the counter.
Peter put his head in his hands and pulled at his hair. Tears sprang in his eyes, he didn’t know why he felt like crying. He didn’t understand why he was overreacting. Peter didn’t understand why he was the way he was, all panicky all the time. Peter tried to take deep calming breaths as he started panicking again.
The teen woke up and walked to the lounge room. He heard the news playing. “Madison Lyons was found dead in an alley earlier this morning. The kidnapped girl was raped and then shot. More information about her coming soon,” The reporter said. Peter felt his breathing quicken. His hands began to shake as he walked in. Another reporter was at the scene. There was a headline. ‘Where is Spiderman?’ “Why wasn’t she saved like so many others? Where was the vigilante when she needed him like so many others?”
Now, they all sat around the table eating Steve’s homemade tater tot casserole. Laughing and smiling all the way. That was the first night in a long time that Peter let himself be truly happy, that he felt truly happy. The Avengers were Peter’s family now, and the teenager would never go back to the way he was living before.
They were ganging up on me now. I looked from Tony to Bruce to Steve. They all held that certain look of ‘Listen to us’. “You all think this is a good idea? Pushing me to talk about stuff that I just want to forget!?”
Peter’s hand started to sting. Crimson blood began flowing onto the floor. The teen didn’t care. He needed the pain, and soon it became numb. Nothing could compare to the debilitating guilt he felt for not saving the girl.
“Don’t try to deny your feelings because you think you should be feeling something else,” Bucky said. Peter’s eyes snapped to him. The teen then looked down.
Tony laughed. Peter let himself laugh as well. Peter hopped off of Steve’s back. Tony walked in front of Steve and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. “I should have known you were behind this,” Steve said.
The next morning was Monday. Peter was going back to school on the strict order he would call Tony, no matter the time if something went wrong or if he had any symptoms of a panic attack or if Flash wouldn’t leave him alone. Peter didn’t have any problems, until health class. Flash walked in, looking angry. They were in the mental health unit.
Peter stopped, thought for a minute, then wrote something else down. He closed his notebook and crawled into his bed. It was Sunday morning, Peter could sleep in.
“Yes! Because of your dumbass, I got in trouble. They think it’s my fault you tried to kill yourself. And to be frank, I wish you would have succeeded.”
Peter, of course, refused to leave her. She was the only family he had left. So, Peter stayed. He took the blows she delt as if he completely deserved it. He took her words to heart. Peter stopped sleeping due to nightmares. His grades were beginning to slip. Flash was getting even more relentless and cruel.
“Yes. It’s fine. I’m fine. Everything’s fine.” Peter didn’t even sound so sure himself. “It’s fine...it’s going to be fine…” Peter kept mumbling to himself. Natasha knew a panic attack when she saw it.
After lunch, I headed to my next class. Took some notes, almost fell asleep twice. Did my work. Then last hour came along. History. I took some more notes and then we watched an ‘informational’ movie. Which just happened to be an old history movie. Instead of really watching the movie, my thoughts drifted elsewhere.
“I’m sorry May...I’m so sorry,” Peter said softly. May held him out, hands on his shoulders, arms extended.
“Peter.” Tony’s voice was harsh. “Stop apologizing for things you have absolutely no control over,” Tony’s voice got a little softer as he noticed Peter flinch at his harsh tone. Tony walked over so he was in front of the teen. “It’s okay Peter.” Tony brought a thumb up to Peter’s cheek and wiped his tears away.
Doesn’t he understand that I don’t want to be here anymore? That I’m tired of trying? That I’m tired of everything bad happening to me and any good I do comes backlashing at me?
“Peter it’s okay. Calm down.” Now she wanted him to calm down?? No fucking way that was happening. Peter’s thoughts were running about a mile an hour. His whole body was shaking. He squeezed his eyes shut and whimpered softly.
Peter looked back down. Silence fell over the room. It would have been a comfortable if there wasn’t so much tension in the air. It was a while before anyone said anything. “Can we watch a movie...maybe forget about this…?” Peter asked.
“I’m doing fine.” I hadn’t meant to sound so angry. I felt Tony’s gaze burning a hole through my back. I turned around. Tony had one eyebrow raised.
“Let me know if Peter wakes up. Also, let the others know Peter’s sleeping if they decide to come barging in loudly.”
“Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t feeling well?” Tony asked as he stopped running his fingers through Peter’s hair. He sounded minorly upset, though he kept his voice soft. Peter didn’t say anything. He just closed his eyes again. Tony resumed carding his fingers through the teen’s hair.
“It’s been...useful,” Peter said trying to find the right words. “But...not as much as I thought it would be.”
“Peter breathe.” A voice cut through everything else going on in my head. I sucked in a breath. I didn’t even realize I’d been holding my breath. Tony’s worried face was in front of mine. Steve was standing off to my right looking just as worried. Bruce on my left. The light was almost blinding. I kept them squeezed shut.
Hands. Hands were on me. Taking the bottle of pills from my own hands. I protested madly. There were voices. Angry, worried, hurt voices. I didn’t care. All I could think of was the sweet release of death.
I was glad that Tony wasn’t more upset than he actually was. It was nice...knowing that someone cares just that much for you. Even if it seems like the world’s given up on you. I went to my room and got out my notebook.
I felt my knees buckle under my weight. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. I didn’t want anyone touching me. It took me a minute to realize that it was my own body making that horrid screeching sound. May...she was supposed to love me right...she loved me...right?
“I don’t believe that.” Peter completely shut down. He didn’t say anything. Bruce gave him props for trying. “If you want to talk, I’m here.”
“It-It’s not okay though!” I yelled with a sob. “I promised...I promised I wouldn’t let it get to me…”
“Of course, Peter.” The lights went out, leaving Peter covered in the warm white covers. Peter let his eyes fall closed.
“We took you in because we wanted to, not out of obligation. We aren’t just going to up and leave,” Clint said. Peter sniffed back tears.
Peter sniffed, instantly regretting calling Happy. “I-I’m s-sorry...Just...something…” Peter paused, “Something came up...and I’ll just….I’m sorry for bothering you...nevermind.”
Peter didn’t say anything for the next two hours. Didn’t move from his spot, didn’t watch TV, didn’t do anything. It was starting to worry Tony and Steve to no end. Then, Peter finally moved.
“Shh Pete, it’s okay. It’s okay.” Now I knew that voice. Tony. “I know that was hard. But it’s going to be okay. I need you to calm down so we can get out of here,” Tony said.
The next three days went by smoothly for Peter. Well, as smooth as they could go for someone with a terrible case of depression and anxiety and everything else that could be wrong, he did often, find himself thinking about the girl. He truly wanted to save her...but he found himself frozen...unable to do his job. Tony didn’t seem mad at all, and in fact, he actually called the school to yell at the principal on Peter’s behalf. Everyone tried to keep up a light mood for Peter. They could see through the mask he was putting on.
“Wow, Pete. That’s impressive,” Tony said peering over my shoulder. I finally took a good look at what I was drawing. It didn’t look all that impressive, it was the face of the wolf, definitely, maybe slightly under-detailed.
I don’t know how long it was we stood there talking before she finally let me help her down. We sat on the building talking until daybreak.
Peter grabbed the sides of his head, pulling on his hair, trying to get the voices to shut up. But, it seemed as though they wanted Peter to listen, to follow what they say. “Stop it! Stop it!” Peter yelled over and over again. Tony came bursting into the room as soon as Friday notified him of Peter’s actions.
“Don’t be sorry. It’s not your fault.” There was a gentle hand rubbing circles on his back, another carding fingers through his hair. Peter felt himself falling asleep.
“Is...is it bad that...that I miss her…?” Peter asked. They all knew instantly what he was talking about.
I sat with the others in the living room. It was finally the weekend and I was exhausted. Mentally and physically. I was trying to remember to write negative thoughts down, but with everything going on it was hard. I grabbed my notebook from the table beside me.
I was beginning to lose my appetite again, but Tony, Steve, and Bruce are refusing to let me leave the table until I’ve finished. Which...is understandable...but...frustrating. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. No one was in the kitchen at that point in time. I took a bite of the sandwich. I’m not gonna lie...it was pretty tasty for a simple grilled cheese. But, how was I supposed to enjoy it when my thoughts were screaming insults.
“Of course we’re back, you didn’t think we’d leave you behind did you?” Tony asked the question, though he knew the answer. After about five minutes, Tony spoke up, “Alright kiddo, as much as I love your hugs, I need to get cleaned up. Why don’t you sit in here and wait?”
Peter shot up, he felt wetness on his face only to realize he was crying. Steve and Tony’s worried face over his own.
Tony left Peter’s room and closed the door. Peter flopped down on his bed exasperatedly. The teen was heading in a downward spiral. Everything was going….wrong. Nothing was going the way Peter wanted it to go. Peter was soon pulled into a nightmare filled sleep.
A hand was placed gently on his shoulder. Peter couldn’t help but flinch slightly. “It’s going to be okay Pete. No matter what,” Tony said softly.
‘Always freaking out, even if there is no reason. You can hear it in their voices that they are getting tired of your lack of self-preservation. Constantly needing heavy reassurance about every single thing.’ *
Peter awoke with a start. His breathing was erratic. His heart was pounding madly against his ribcage. For some reason, he felt as if this wasn’t the first time he’d woken up like this. Peter laid his head back down and tried to get his breathing under control.
I know I was a burden to my Aunt. I had these powers and I couldn’t save Uncle Ben. She was forced to work a lot of hours just to keep up with feeding me. She was also going through her own mental battles. I didn’t mean to burden her with myself. I didn’t mean to burden anyone with my own problems, that’s why I kept everything in, so I didn’t burden anyone.
Once I finally got my breathing under control, I slipped out of bed and walked quietly to the kitchen. I grabbed a glass and started filling it with water. I tried to remember what about that nightmare was so scary. After filling my glass, I went back to my room, turned on my desk light, opened my notebook and grabbed a pen.
Bruce came into my vision, I still couldn’t hear what they were saying, then everything came rushing back at me.
“Yeah.” Tony and Peter headed to the communal area. Peter flopped himself onto the couch beside Bucky and Tony walked up behind Steve and hugged him.
“Tony, come on. This isn’t good for you,” Steve said with concern as he once again tried to coax Tony out of the lab. Tony finally turned to look at Steve. His eyes had lost all shine and were dull. This only caused Steve’s concern to grow.
I felt my anger drain completely. I knew he was worried. “Yeah…I know..and I’m sorry too,” I said. “For worrying you.”
Once Peter got away from the living room, he pressed the accept button and put the phone to his ear. “Hello…?”
“Tony. He’s seventeen. He literally lost everyone in his family. We’re all he has left. The kid’s right to freak out like he is,” Steve said wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist, then leaning down and giving Tony a quick kiss.
Peter ran off. Tony and the rest of the Avengers were called. Dr. Hensen voiced her concerns about the teen. Tony was worried sick about Peter. Steve was a hot second behind on the worry scale. It took them almost 20 minutes to find the teen. Tony rushed over to Peter, his anxious growing as he looked at the teen passed out on the ground. Steve picked Peter up, they took him back to the compound, to Bruce.
“I know Peter,” Sam said looking at Peter with a concerned glance. “Just know, you can say anything in here. What is said in here, stays in here, unless I see otherwise.” Peter looked down at his hands. His vision was blurring once again with the threat of tears.
In truth, Peter was tired. Tired of being pushed around by Flash. Tired of being weak. Tired of being scared. Tired of being broken. Tired of being ignored. He was tired of being tired. In the ten days, Peter was suspended, the teen spent a lot more time contemplating suicide. He wanted to be free of this life...but he didn’t want to...no he couldn’t break his promise to Bruce. He promised he wouldn’t let it get to him. And there he was, sitting on his bed, wondering if the world would actually be better without him.
I hope you enjoyed chapter three. I know...still not very good. I have issues, everyone thinks it's good and I think it's trashy. I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
“How could I not have seen it?” Tony asked brokenly. “How could I not have seen that it was that bad?”
Tony left Peter’s room and filled the rest in on what happened to Peter. That first night, was restless for all of them. Peter would wake up every few hours screaming. Thankfully, with the sedative still in his system, he was easily coaxed back to sleep. They say it’s always the first night that’s the worst. Little did they know it was just going to get harder.
I wanted to tell them what was happening, but I could only get out a high-pitched whine. I felt hot tears sliding down my cheeks. Bruce looked away from me, probably to talk to Steve and Tony.
Peter clenched his jaw as tight as he could. Peter felt the couch dip in on the other side of him. “You aren’t stupid hun,” Natasha’s abnormally soft voice rang around his head. “There’s nothing wrong with you. You’ve been through a lot of shit lately. You can’t blame yourself for panicking, it’s by no means your fault.” Peter felt a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Mr. Stark called. Said he was going to come and get you if you don’t get home soon or call him back,” she said.
‘Woke up from a nightmare that I can’t remember. Those are sometimes the worst because you know you had one but you don’t know why you so suddenly woke up freaking out. I probably won’t be sleeping again anytime soon’.
“What the hell are you doing?” Aunt May’s voice reached his ears. Peter whipped around to face his aunt, who looked very...very angry.
“M’fine,” the teen mumbled after finishing the bite of food. He someone’s thumb rub against his cheek.
“Peter’s heart and breathing rate are dangerously high,” Came the AI’s voice, somehow she sounded slightly concerned. Peter got up as fast as he could before he ran. He heard them yelling after him to stop. When he got to the main lobby, he couldn’t run anymore. He couldn’t breathe. He had to stop. Black spots danced in his vision. He felt dizzy. Peter leaned heavily against the wall. The elevator dinged and Peter couldn’t even find it in himself to run. Everything was muffled. It was like he was in a pool, his head was swimming. Tony’s face was in front of his. His vision blurred. His eyes rolled back into his head. The teen fell unconscious.
“We should have realized how bad it was…” Clint said sitting on the end of my bed. I swallowed hard. His words only made me feel more guilty. I couldn’t talk. I knew if I did, I’d cry. Again. I could already feel the horrible sadness in the deep pits of my stomach.
“He’s okay...my diagnosis is a panic attack. It doesn’t seem like that would be too far off considering what Lana told us…,” Bruce said. “I’ve got him on a mild sedative, he’s likely to wake up confused and panicking so, we’ll have to watch him closely. I don’t want him alone at all.”
You saw the summary. Please don't read if any of these topics trigger you. Please read at your own risk. You have been warned. This chapter is basically based on the recent and really bad panic attack I had earlier this week. Also, there is some STONY finally
Peter groaned as he came to awareness. There were fingers carding through his hair and quiet breathing.
Steve left the room. Peter shakily went into the bathroom. He turned the water on as hot as he could stand. Peter grabbed a change of clothes, undressed, grabbed his razor, and stepped into the steaming water. He sighed as the water helped relax his aching, tense muscles. Peter pressed the blade to his skin, only wincing slightly when the blade pierced through his skin. Peter watched as blood, tears, and water swirled down the drain. He couldn’t forget about his past if it kept punching him in the face.
Monday finally rolled around, Peter was not looking forward to his appointment with Dr. Hensen that afternoon. At all. In fact, he was dreading it. The only reason he was going was to make Tony feel better. Peter sighed to himself as he sat in homeroom listening to the teacher drone on and on about finals coming up. Soon the bell rang. Peter forced himself not to think about the appointment that afternoon, but it was hard not to. Peter ignored his history teacher’s lecture, hoping the end would come soon, but at the same time, wishing it wouldn’t.
I waited. Clint was the first to walk in. Then Tasha, Sam, and Rhodey. They all looked tired. In fact...every single one of them looked exhausted. Tony and Bruce looking the more so than the others. I was feeling super guilty now.
Finally, the teen said something, “I didn’t think it was this bad.” Peter tried to sit up, almost immediately regretting his actions as his head began to spin.
Peter got up and walked to the living room. The lights were dim and the TV was playing a show that Clint seemed to be extremely interested in. Tony and Steve were sitting on one of the couches. Bucky on the end of the same couch. Natasha and Clint were occupying the love seat. Nat had her legs strung over Clint’s lap. Sam was in one chair and Rhodey in the other. Peter went to the only spot available, between Bucky and Tony.
“I know…” Peter whispered. He pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around his legs. His head rested on his knees. “Bruce…?”
“N-no of course not!” Peter stuttered out of fear. May was now right in front of him. She struck his cheek, then reached around him, grabbed one of the bottles, and then walked back into her room, shutting the door. Peter was frozen on the spot. He could feel himself shaking. The teen finished cleaning up and then looked around the living room. There were pill bottles everywhere. Peter quietly cleaned up and then went to his room.
“That mother-” Tony cut himself off. “Let’s get you home. I’m going to talk to the principal again.” Tony sounded exhausted. I didn’t blame him.
I hope it didn't seem too rushed. I know there's a lot going on in this chapter, but I know how it feels to have a lot going on, so it's easier to write and it makes more sense to me than it might other people. So, I really do hope that you guys are enjoying this story.
“Nice of you to join us, Pete,” Bruce commented. It was light-hearted, but I couldn’t help but see the other side to it. I sat down and everyone started eating.
“m’ sorry guys…” I felt sick. Not like the ‘I’m going to throw up’ sick, but the ‘my anxiety is so high’ sick. Natasha, for once, had emotion on her face. She looked like she was about to cry. She walked over to me and pulled me into a hug.
The thought of food still making him nauseous, he ignored the hungry feeling and sat in the living room. “Fri, where is everyone?”
None of them would ever understand why the teen would apologize after he had a panic attack of any kind. “Don’t be sorry Peter.”
Wow, I'm on a role. I'm really loving writing this story. I really hope you guys like reading it as much as I love writing it.
‘She’s in jail because of you!’ His mind screamed. Peter let loose a quiet sob not able to stop the sound from escaping his lips. ‘She’ll never forgive you!’ To stop himself from making any more noise he shoved a bite in his mouth. He could feel their eyes on him. Especially Nat, Tony, and Bucky.
Peter Benjamin Parker, with his big brown doe-eyes, as the Avengers finally realized, was too pure for this world. Peter Parker was loved by all of them. Peter was to be protected at all costs. When Peter was happy, smiling, laughing, it was completely contagious. No one could keep themselves from being happy. When the teen was smiling, they could swear that it actually lit up the room like fireworks on the fourth of July.
“Mr. Clint, Mrs. Romanoff, and Mr. Barnes are currently still asleep. Boss is in his lab and Mr. Rogers is in the gym,” Friday said.
“You will find the right people. But, for right now, you should probably talk to someone other than me. I can’t help you anymore. But if you want or need anyone to talk to, I’ll be there.”
The morning went by smoothly. Ned and I talked about our project we had in chemistry, we also worked on it some. Lunchtime came along. I munched on an apple, listening to Ned ramble about whatever it was he was talking about. MJ sat down. We carried on a conversation, well, MJ and Ned did. I just sat silently listening.
Steve collapsed on the couch and Tony leaned down and squeezed his pecs. “Morning, gorgeous.” Steve shook his head, smiling and doing a bad job of covering up his blush.
Tony and Rhodey landed next to Sam and looked up where he was pointing. Under the side of an overturned building, there was a small shape of a boy, clinging to the concrete. Tony flipped off the infrared and the shape was invisible again.
Tony grinned back, but found her eyes falling to Eve's lips again. She glanced away. “So you’re keeping an eye on me, huh?”
Red Skull suddenly feinted to the side and flew around Wanda, channeling magic towards Bucky in a blinding stream. Steve only barely managed to deflect it with his shield--he was sent flying with the force of the impact. Wanda threw Red Skull violently aside with her magic at the last minute.
“Tony,” Eve whispered, and Tony hummed in response, holding the back of Eve’s neck as she kissed down to the collar of her shirt.
He must have looked starstruck when he pulled away because Steve smiled warmly, and Tony had never seen that particular smile on his face before, that sweet and open and filled with adoration and with peace.
Tony tossed the paper away. When he turned around, Rhodey was standing in the doorway. Tony sighed and dropped his head into his hands as Rhodey sat down next to him.
“Okay, just checking in. I know he means a lot to you. It can’t have been easy making up after that, is all I’m saying.”
Once the cold had faded, Tony wrapped his arm around the back of Steve’s waist and drifted off to sleep again.
Wanda waited for him to look at her. When he finally met her eyes again, she spoke. "We did this. It's over." Tony tried to stop his lips from trembling and Wanda said, "It's okay."
By the time he was finished with the suit it was after 2 A.M. and he collapsed over the table and the horrible unseated feeling came rushing back. He felt sick to his stomach. Looking around frantically for something else to work on, his eyes fell upon the couch on the other side of his lab. This was not the time, he thought with a groan. He was doing everything in his power
, and I still haven’t even gotten to see him. I never even got to say goodbye to him,” he hissed. “Do you realize that? Does this matter to you?”
“I hear congratulations are in order,” Fury said, his eye twinkling. “Give Cap my regards as well. It’s an unconventional arrangement you two have to be sure, adopting a kid together.”
He walked mechanically to the kitchen. He found himself staring into the bottom of the third cup of coffee before anyone else was awake.
"As much as I hate to agree with him, Stark is right,” Bucky murmured, and Tony turned to see the man standing on the other side of the kitchen.
The supersoldier closed the distance between them and put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, looking closely at the scrape on her cheek. Tony squirmed under Eve’s hands but it was no use.
"I'm not afraid of monsters," Miles insisted, snuggling down farther under the blankets. "I'm a superhero."
Steve went limp. Tony turned to look at him and that awful second seemed to be an eternity. His eyes were still open. He looked at Tony for a moment that seemed to drag until he slowly collapsed against the stone steps. There was blood flowing from his side where the bullet had struck him.
“Okay,” Miles replied, hopping down onto the floor and hugging Tony. Tony motioned quickly for Steve to join and Steve smiled and knelt down to wrap his arms around both of them.
Tony was almost concerned for Steve's asthmatic lungs, but he was a little too angry to be. Instead he found himself sitting at his work table trembling with rage and grief. Trying not to cry just made him feel worse. And it all ended up coming out anyway as he worked, doing anything to keep his hands busy. He ended up getting tears all over his work and throwing it aside in frustration.
Rhodey elbowed Tony. “So is this final?” he asked. Miles clamored down from Sam’s shoulders and looked up at Rhodey in awe.
“I know, you’re gonna say ‘on your left,’” Sam murmured, taking the cup from Steve when he was finished. “Save your breath. It’s alright, I—I got what you were trying to say.” He smiled, and when Steve started to smile weakly back, Sam’s smile burst into a grin. “Son of a bitch.”
“Ugh,” Tony grumbled. “Can you believe this guy? First he marries me without asking, now I have to pay for the fake honeymoon?”
"Kissing. I haven't had a lot of practice with it, or..." Steve looked like he would rather be out in the field getting shot at than admit it. "Sharon and I never even really dated, and between that and, and now--"
Tony bumped his shoulder against Steve’s. “Anything would’ve been wishful thinking, you know? You didn’t know I was bi either, you hypocrite.”
Usually jokes like that earned him a smile or laugh from Steve, but this time he was silent, staring at the floor. Tony dropped his hand from Steve’s shoulder. “I promise I’ll be careful, okay?”
“It’s not about strength or size, Tony,” Steve pointed out. He stretched his shoulders, breathing out a deep sigh. “Jiu jitsu is actually perfect for someone like you or Nat.”
Tony looked abruptly away and let her words settle into the silence. "Isn't this a terrible idea? All of us being around each other again, just pretending nothing happened, never able to fix things?"
After some time they got themselves cleaned up and went back to necking, which was really even hotter than Tony could have imagined with the way Steve's hair was messed up and his clothes were rumpled from sex, his sweatpants sitting almost obscenely low on his hips.
Rhodey grinned and looked up at Tony. “Hey buddy, I can’t wear it all the time,” he explained to Miles.
It had been after they fought Ultron. The flight to Korea had been long. Tony had been the only one who thought it was a good idea. Pietro had been dead, but acceptance was never Tony’s strong suit.
He stopped abruptly high up over the steps of the courthouse. Large marble columns flanked the dark mouth of the building. There was no one on the steps. Was he too late? No, that wasn’t possible.
It still sounded so strange to hear Steve say that. And he said it so easily, so surely, like it was just a fact of life that Tony, almost despite his efforts to pick this apart and find some flaw and some plausible deniability, couldn't help but believe him. He was so screwed.
“I don’t know what you’re going to do with that, but be careful. If exposed to air for enough time, it evaporates. If you inhale the fumes, it could make you very sick, even knock you out.”
“Sorry…about the other day,” Steve murmured, putting his hands in his pockets as he looked away. “I just didn’t know you wanted something like this, that’s all.”
Tony let out a humorless laugh. “Yeah. But maybe it would be simpler if you just adopted him without me—”
Steve looked down, his cheeks beginning to turn pink. "Unless you're too tired. I know you were pretty wiped out last night."
“Hey. We’ve gone on hundreds of missions just like this before. It’s going to be fine. It’s the same—”
And yet somehow it made him sadder than before. More lonely. He hated himself for wanting something that was so preposterous for him to want, and for withdrawing when they were all so close to feeling like a team again, just because one man didn't love him the way he wanted to be loved, the way he fantasized about being loved, when he couldn't stop himself from imagining it and he was too weak to stop it.
“I don’t think those things are allowed at school anyway,” Miles pointed out, shouldering his backpack, which was full of supplies, presents and snacks from the Avengers.
“A bed does sound pretty good right about now,” Steve said, glancing at Tony. “I’m gonna go shower. I’ll be quick.”
He pulled away from the hug. Wanda reached up and brushed a tear from his cheek, which earned her a shaky smile.
When they came back to Stark Tower everyone was visibly more relaxed. Wanda was slumped across one of the couches trying to kick Clint off the end where he was trying to fight for some space. Pietro, reduced to a sluggish speed after all the fighting that day, was watching with amusement. Rhodey had given up trying to interfere. Bucky and Natasha were busy discussing knife fighting techniques in excited, hushed tones in the corner, while Vision listened politely. Jan was taking something out of the oven and trying to use her oven mitts to fend off Carol, who was always on the lookout for a free meal.
Bucky looked back and forth between them. “O…kay? Well the kid is climbing up the walls, just so you know.”
Tony glanced at Steve and winked. “No, somebody’s gotta tell it. May as well be you,” he said, turning back to Karen.
Tony spent the night sitting beside Steve’s bed, and finally fell into a fitful sleep, collapsed on the arm of the chair.
Bucky stood behind Sam silently, his expression less friendly. Tony looked away. “Great job I did of that.”
