Thump.
“Steve.”
Steve takes another breath.  His lungs expand.  His heart beats, though he could swear it was too mangled to do so.
Thump.
He doesn’t touch Tony’s face.  Doesn’t run his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Between his sobs, the boy could barely string a sentence, yet Tony understood the devastating words. “All that I have is yours – the richest food, the finest clothes, the softest bed. Still, you would rather be with your friends, starving in the cold, as you plot the next protest or maybe even my death?”
Steve bit back a groan. "Thank you, sir," he said.
Tony smiled back at the grinning young man. How little had changed. How much sway he still held over him despite the passage of time. He wouldn’t be the first nor the last king to bring a dynasty to a close, all for a pretty face. But, at least, he would be doing it on his own terms.
“You’re so perfect like this,” Tony said. “But knowing you, it won't be long before you're right back here. Am I right?"
“No, you didn’t.”
“Yep,” Steve said, taking out a guard with a flick of his shield. "You know I never liked him."
“Yes! Yes!” Tony gasped as Steve began to fuck him in earnest.
, and
Tony considered the strange creature. How he longed to tame the wild beast, for the boy to sit at his feet and eat from his hand. Yet, his beauty lay in his straight back, the proud lift of his head, the wild look in his eyes. It was something he’d always known - a wild stallion's free spirit was part of his charm. Taming one went against the course of nature. Keeping one would be a sin.
Tony swallowed his hurt, barely masking his pain. “Why? Why do you have to fight me all the time? Is your life here so hard? Do you hate me all that much?”
Tony put down the crop to review the results of his work – red stripes covering the graceful swell of his bottom to the middle of strong thighs. He ran his fingers gently over the raised lines, eliciting a whimper from the well-punished boy, whose body continued trembling with violent sobs.
It seemed to work, and Tony could feel Steve’s heartbeat slowing down. Even though the alpha kept his fingers buried in Tony’s ass, he was moving them slower now. “Those clothes should be illegal,” he huffed, with whatever remained of his anger.
I’m so sorry for posting this so late. I had a draft ready for the second chapter when I posted the first one and I thought I could edit it in three days. But the plot bunnies didn't leave me alone and it's swelled to three times its length.
Tony froze, freeing Steve’s cock from his mouth. He looked at him in concern. “No, my love. It will hurt. I don’t want to hurt you anymore.”
Still panting, Steve rested his head on the bed beside Tony’s. He placed his weight on his knees and elbows, careful not to crush him under his weight.
Tony began to move, painfully slowly as he fucked his face. Steve struggled to control his breathing, timing his breaths when Tony pulled out of his throat. He felt the tears springing to his eyes, rolling down his cheeks as he worked hard at the task.
“Yes, sir. Please, sir. I’ll be good, sir,” he gasped, trying to catch his breath.
“Absolutely!” Aurora cheered, grinning broadly, all three men hugging her tightly before she said her goodbyes and climbed into the cab waiting for her outside.

was released, Aurora boarded the StarkJet and flew to LA. She went straight to the hotel as soon as she arrived and started getting ready. She had just slipped into her mid-calf length black dress and was sitting on the edge of the bed strapping on her heels for the evening when there was a knock on the door.
On the 23rd of December, after Rori came home from her final exam, the team gathered around on the various sofas and beanbags with pizza boxes strewn between them as they watched Die Hard. Aurora was laying across one of the sofas, her slipper clad feet in Steve’s lap and her head settled on a cushion on Natasha’s who was running her hands through the teenager’s hair. She shuffled around on the sofa, pulling her phone from her pocket as it buzzed about halfway through the movie. A smile stretched across her face as she read through the text.
“No,” Steve replied immediately. “If I hadn’t been so hellbent on joining the army I wouldn’t have been given the serum and I never would have come out of ice or met Tony… or you.”
“And I thought I explained that we need to go bigger than a YouTube video for your first single,” he said, his tone exasperated.
“No dad,” Rori said, biting her bottom lip nervously. “I’m going on my own.”
She stepped back from his grasp to look him up and down, taking in the bright red floral pants and black button up.
“I love you too,” he promised, leaning forward to lock their lips together.
“What if I lose him?” she whispered into the darkness. “I can’t lose another parent, Harry. I can’t.”
Cause I let my guard down
She took a deep breath, steeling herself emotionally for the final chorus. She dropped her voice, softly singing the next few lines before throwing her arms out wide and closing her eyes as she belted out the second to last line of the song.
“Nervous?” he asked as they both sat down facing each other. Aurora gave a quick nod and a small smile in response, tucking a lose strand of hair behind her ear. “Don’t be,” Letterman added, “we’ll only talk about what you’re comfortable with and if you don’t want to answer any of my questions just say so and we’ll skip to the next one. This isn’t live so we can just take our time.”
“We exchanged presents this morning,” Rori replied in confusion. “You gave me a StarkPhone.”
Without waiting for a reply from her father, she turned on her heels, scooped her bag off the nearby couch and headed for the elevator.
Aurora stared at Harry in shock.
There are going to be some Instagram posts for this chapter but I'm going to combine them with the ones for the next chapter so once that one is posted I'll put up the Instagram posts to avoid spoilers :)
“God you sound like my mother,” Mark sighed, causing Rori and Tony to chuckle. “I’ll tell you what I tell her; I’m a 27 year gay man, I’m in no rush to settle down.”
“Yeah,” she nodded, “Maybe a month or two after we started the band, we’d decided we were just going to cover songs we liked, but I was also writing a whole heap at the time and Dad helped me get an agent and I started licensing them out and some big names started picking them up and recording them.”
Instead of replying she kissed him deeply, putting all her love and appreciation in the way her lips moved against his.
“But the album is just as much yours as it is ours,” Louis argued, pouting slightly as he threw his arm around his friend, a little drunk and feeling very sure of himself. “The fans’ll love it. We could do
“JARVIS alerted me too, thought Aurora might need to talk,” Sam explained. “Or that you might.”
“I hope you're right,” she said. “I just want people see what I’m trying to do here and not just think I’m trying to capitalize on the family.”
“They sound like wonderful people,” Letterman added.
“More than you can possibly imagine. I grew up really poor, so this is still very overwhelming. My mum was 19 when she fell pregnant with me and her parents kicked her out of home when she told them. She was living in her car and desperately trying to convince anyone to give her a job and she got really lucky that she met the right people when she needed them most.” She paused in her story, but after a quick nod of assurance from Letterman she continued the tale. “She walked into a bar in Wimbledon called the Golden Stag, explained her situation and asked if they had any waitressing or kitchen jobs going and the owners Helen and Greg pretty much adopted her straight away. Within a couple of days, not only did they give her a job, but they converted the office space above the bar into a tiny little one bedroom apartment and let her live there rent free. I honestly don’t know whether we would have survived without them over the years. They became the only family that we had, and I grew up thinking of them as my grandparents.”
year at Columbia, Aurora was sitting in the library with a few friends from one of her painting classes. It was the end of September and they were talking about the fact that she would be at the CMAs in a little over a month. They were chatting happily when the first sound of gunfire rang out, at initially she didn’t realize what it was. Her first thought was that someone had set of firecrackers in the hallway outside the library and then realization dawned. Rori saw the fear in the eyes of other students around her as everyone scrambled for somewhere safe to hide. They’d all run through the drills countless times over the years and every one of them knew what to do, stay away from windows, hide behind something solid and stay quiet. When she’d first moved to America the concept of an active shooter was so foreign but that had been years ago now and there had been countless school shootings across the country since. She could feel her heartbeat in every limb, her breathing rapid and her hands were trembling as she cowered under the table in the library beside her friends. She remembered watching a documentary on the Columbine massacre and let out a small whimper as she remembered those kids also hiding under tables in the library.
“Aurora?”
“Thank you,” Aurora said. “Big fan of yours too.”
“Pops?” She mumbled, squinting up at him from where her head rested against his shoulder.
“Hi,” she replied nervously. While they had gotten along easily when they met in London a few weeks ago, Rori had not been lying when she had told Steve that Tony seemed afraid of talking to her. Now that she knew the reason behind his hesitancy, she was determined to bridge the distance between them. If she was going to live here with him for the next 2 years, then she needed to create a relationship with her father. “What are you working on?”
A chorus of Christmas greetings rose up from the patrons perched at the bar as Aurora and her mother headed out into the cold winter night, wrapping scarves around themselves and tugging woollen hats down over their ears, walking through the Wimbledon streets towards their favourite dessert bar for their annual Christmas eve waffle tradition. Despite the freezing weather, there were plenty of people out and about, finishing off the last of their shopping or heading towards the tube to go home to their families. They walked slowly, admiring the Christmas lights and decorations hung in shop windows and strung about the lampposts that lined the busy street. They finally reached the warmth of the dessert bar, quickly removing their coats, scarves and hats as they slid into their regular booth, waving at the staff behind the counter and sharing cheery holiday greetings. After ordering more food then either would ever be able to finish, Louise launched into an animated story of something funny that had happened to her during her shift earlier in the afternoon. She was a bartender and waitress in the pub below their apartment and she knew that her daughter loved hearing all of the crazy stories she had about the things that always seemed to happen inside their little pub. The regulars were like Aurora’s crazy aunts and uncles given that she had spent her entire life living in the apartment upstairs. Louise had been 19, single and 4 months pregnant when she had walked into the Golden Stag asking for work. Helen and Greg, the couple who owned the Stag had taken pity on the young women and not only had they immediately put her to work but they had also quickly turned the unused rooms upstairs into a cosy little apartment for the soon-to-be new mother. They had lived there ever since, and Aurora had loved every moment of it. Her mother was one of her best friends, while Helen and Greg had very quickly taken on the role of doting grandparents for the young girl. Now, only 2 weeks before her 16
“Harry,” Aurora gasped, placing her hands on either side of his face and pulling his head up to kiss him desperately. “I love you too. I’m the lucky one.”
“She was in surgery last I heard,” Happy told him, swinging the car out into traffic and heading for the hospital. “How are you?”
“Aurora. I thought we wouldn’t be seeing you until next week in London,” Anne said in surprise before hugging the young woman warmly. “It’s so lovely to have you here. Come on in.”
Aurora’s eyes started to well with tears in response to Anne’s kind words, and the two women hugged each other again before Robin came over to interrupt.
“Thank you,” Rori replied with a soft smile, very aware of both of her fathers watching their interaction. “I never expected you to be here, or the other guys.”
“I’m collaborating with a band called Boyce Avenue, so the three members are going to be here until Monday to record in the studio,” Aurora explained, growing more nervous with every second as Nat and Clint shared a look that could only spell trouble for her.
Tony chuckled at her frustration. “I think you’ve got a pretty good excuse,” he said. “Not that there’s anything wrong with having a good cry when it’s needed.”
“I’m already planning the next one,” she told her father. “It really is addictive.”
“Now that you've finally,” Gary began, Aurora joining him on the second half of the line, “lost what you thought that you needed, never would have treated your heart, like you did. What goes around comes back around.”
They played most of
“What happened?” he asked, falling to his knees beside the couple.
The show opened not long after the girls took their seats and within a few minutes the judges were introduced and Aurora and Ella were standing up in their seats, cheering along with the rest of the crowd, whistling and hollering extra loud at Nick’s introduction.
A few days after the launch of the band, 2 weeks before Christmas, Rori was at home, lounging on the sofa when it dawned on her that neither Tony nor Steve had made any mention of Christmas over the past few weeks.
“You don’t just get over it,” Sam replied. “You talk about how you felt, and you let the people around you help you.”
“So, lads,” he said, “second last show tonight. Thought I’d get you a surprise gift.”
“Me to,” Rori replied, her fingers tangling themselves in his curls. She pulled him back into another kiss, deeper than the last, her breathing turning shallow as his hands rested on her hips, pulling her flush against his torso. They sprung apart a few minutes later when someone coughed loudly behind Harry. They both blushed profusely as Ella grinned back at them.
The flight was the longest 8 hours of Harry’s life. He’d tried to call both Tony and Steve before he boarded the plane, but when neither answered he’d opened up the JARVIS app that Tony has installed on his phone when he last visited the tower. He informed JARVIS of his flight details and asked the AI to let both of Aurora’s parents know that he was on his away and then he turned his phone to airplane mode and ran his hand over his face, exhausted but unable to sleep. By the time he reached JFK, Harry was unsure how he was still on his feet. He was beyond tired and scared to the point of being sick as he walked through the terminal, his duffle bag hanging from his shoulder, grateful that there weren’t any fans to stop him for a photo. He recognised Happy once he made it to the curb and slipped into the backseat of the town car, closing his eyes as he lent his head back against the seat for the brief moment it took Happy to round the car and climb into the driver’s seat.
“Easy El,” Rori laughed. “We’ve been dating for 3 days, let’s not go talking about weddings and kids ok.”
“Now that we’ve talked family life, let’s talk music,” Letterman said. “You started your band not long after you moved to New York, is that correct?”
“But the shooting did happen, and you just had surgery last week,” Tony bit back, his voice starting to rise.
“Ok,” she agreed, unable to stop the excited grin that split across her face.
Don’t forget to leave a comment :)
“You know there’s an incredible Arts school only a few blocks from here.”
“Well then I won’t hold it against you,” he promised. “At least tell me I was your favourite though.” The blush returned to her face in full force causing him to break into another tear-inducing bought of laughter. “Damn,” he sighed. “Who was it then?”
Ella was the first person to rush forward and throw her arms around her best friend. “Happy Birthday Rors,” she cheered. “Were you surprised?”
“No thank you, dear,” Helen replied with a warm smile, “you two go have fun.”
The following night Aurora watched the boys from the side of stage and once they left the stadium, she spent the evening wrapped up in Harry’s arms back at the hotel.
“Waiting for me to what, love?” he pressed when she left the sentence unfinished.
of January, Aurora once again made her way back to the Golden Stag. She offered a wave of greeting to Greg behind the bar when she walked through the front door and headed over to one of the booths along the wall to wait. Her best friend, Ella, walked through the door 15 minutes later.
Silence hung in the air, neither man knowing how to respond.
“Thank you,” Rori told him. “He said you built the studio for him when he moved in last year.”
“Don’t know what I’d do without you,” she said when they pulled apart.
He led her over to some seats nearby and the three of them sat down.
“Shall we?” Harry asked, gesturing to the front door in front of them. Aurora nodded, placing her hand on his offered elbow as he ushered her into the high ceilinged foyer. “Everyone’s out back,” he said as they walked down the hallway.
“That actually sounds perfect, Harry.”
“You haven’t ruined my company, have you?” He quipped.
“I don’t need your permission,” Aurora reminded him, her stubborn tone matching her fathers, her determination drying her tears the way nothing else could have. “I’m going.”
“JARVIS?” Aurora added, “could you order us some waffles too please?”
“I’m Spider-Man, by the way,” the costumed man offered. “Huge fan, Mr Iron Man, sir.”
Eventually everyone started to yawn, and the night wound its way to its conclusion with cars called and everyone hugging each other goodbye. Harry walked with Aurora to the front door, waiting with her until her car arrived to take her back into the city. He held open the door for her as she climbed in and then surprised her by joining her on the backseat.

“Yeah,” Rori confirmed, “in the summer before my Junior year of high school.”
“Why not? Where are you going?”
Hope that you don't run from me
I've been going out of my mind
“It could be fun?” she replied, her voice lifting at the end as if in question, hesitant to seem like she was inserting herself into a moment that should be theirs.
At the end of her first week in LA, Aurora, Trevor and Matthew all took their turn in the recording booth to lay down the vocals for each track and then they decided to take the weekend off before returning Monday morning to film the music videos.
, a soft smile ghosting over her lips as she listened to Harry’s voice, leaning her head back against the seat with her eyes shut as the plane began to taxi down the runway. She let herself wallow in her sadness, knowing that she would need to put it aside when she reached home in about 2 hours’ time. Leaving Harry was never easy, and she hated the months they spent apart but at the same time she had desperately missed her family and was anxious to see them again. She was also excited to start back at school the following week, eager to begin her final year of college, knowing that once she graduated she would be free to travel the world with Harry and very little would keep them apart now that the band was going on Hiatus for the next year and a half.
“Got the surgeon in the afternoon,” Rori replied.
“Can I get a rain check?” Rori replied, “I’ve got plans tonight.”
and Charlie Puth’s
When he opened the door, he found most of the Avengers team sprawled out across the hard, unforgiving seats, a few looked up at the sound of his entrance and offered him sad, exhausted nods in greeting. It was Steve who stood and made his way over to Harry. Tony remained in the seat next the one Steve had just vacated, his head buried in his hands, somewhat oblivious to anything around him.
“So, I’ve had an idea for tomorrow night,” Louis announced. “Since it’s the last night of tour and Rori’s graced us with her presence, what if we pulled you out on stage with us love and you joined us for a song?”
“Merry Christmas Dad,” she murmured in reply, causing both of them to freeze for a moment. Tony recovered first, his face splitting with a gigantic grin and he just hugged her even tighter, chuckling when Steve wrapped his arms around both of them, sandwiching Rori between the two men.
“Well I’ve got another surgery coming up next week, but the doctors are talking about another 3 or 4 surgeries early next year so it’s gonna be a while till I’m back in the studio, but maybe we can start by dealing with the requests you said you already have.”
Harry and Aurora were wrapped tightly around each other in Harry’s bed, savouring the final hours before Aurora's flight when her phone started ringing on the bedside table. Harry was closer so he reached for it, passing it over and she briefly saw Marks name and face before she pressed it to her ear, her cheek still flush against Harry’s bare chest.
“Louis and his girlfriend Eleanor, Liam and his girlfriend Sophia, Zayn and Niall,” Harry listed. “We always get together after we spend Christmas with our families,” Harry explained. “We have a games night with the girlfriends and just hang out as friends before all the craziness of touring kicks off again.”
“No,” Rori interrupted. “Tomorrow night is about you boys. It’s the last tour show and the night before the album drops. I don’t want to step on that.”
Aurora walked off the stage after the sound check to find Steve glowering at the side of stage. “You ok Pops?” she asked.
Sam appeared at the door a couple of minutes later.
Anne and Robin flew in on the 23
They posted there first cover 3 weeks after forming the band, and with the help of Rori’s twitter account and existing channel
century. To say that it was a difficult adjustment period would have been a gross understatement. In the first week of waking up he was introduced to Director Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D, and was quickly brought up to speed on the big milestone moments he had missed in the last 70 years, or at least the moments that Fury decided were most crucial for him to be caught up on. After a week he had travelled to London to see Peggy Carter and had been both overjoyed and devastated to see the only surviving person from his old life. Upon returning to New York he had been informed that he would be meeting with another member of what Fury was calling the Avenger Initiative and he was left frozen in shock when the man had entered the room. The newcomer had looked so strongly like his old comrade Howard Stark and if Steve had not just returned from seeing an elderly Peggy he may have begun to fear, once again, that this was all an elaborate hydra plot and he was not in fact in the future. After only a few minutes talking to Tony, it was clear that this man was nothing like his father. He was funny, a dry, scathing humour but funny none the less and he wasn’t trying to ease Steve into the conversation like everyone else had since he’d awoken. Tony didn’t wait for anyone to catch up to his train of thought and Steve respected the older man’s confidence. After that first day the pair had hit it off, becoming fast friends and once Tony had learnt that Steve was living at S.H.I.E.L.D in a tiny bunk room, he had immediately informed Steve that he was moving in with Tony. Steve appreciated Tony’s friendship more than words could explain and the two men found living together in Stark Tower as easy as breathing. While Steve appreciated Tony (and JARVIS)’s help in learning about the modern day, Tony enjoyed having someone around to share meals with (and cook said meals), although he was too proud to admit to Steve in those early days just how much he had craved the easy companionship. Over the course of the year that Steve had spent living with Tony, their friendship had grown until eventually it had morphed and changed into something more. At first Steve had been scared of the change, given the era in which he had grown up, but as with everything else scary and new in 2010, Tony had been there to help Steve understand and accept that everything was different now. It had in no way been a simple or easy transition, but Steve could honestly say that he had never been happier standing in the penthouse at the top of Stark Tower, watching the man he loved working away as the sun began to set over the city laid out below them.
“Sleeping Beauty,” he tried again. “You know, because her name was Aurora?”
“No, it’s not that.” She shook her head, taking a breath before she explained. “You haven’t seen me without the bandages and there’s a lot of scar tissue.”
“Yeah,” she mumbled, finally sitting up and allowing her father to crush her in a tight embrace.
“Good to see her laughing again, hey lad?” he asked.
“Harry,” Rori replied. “Now, everyone leave me alone and watch Bruce Willis save Christmas.”
“I want to meet her,” Tony announced. “I need to meet her.”
. She had writing credit on almost every track on the new album, but after talking about it with the boys, they had decided that
Aurora was grinning from ear to ear when the song faded out to silence, immensely proud of the song and all the work they’d put into it over the last week.
“I’m glad you are. He’s told me a lot about you. Hasn’t shut up about you really.”
“Haz,” he whispered, unable to make his voice any louder but not needing to in the dead silence of the room. Harry looked towards Liam, his phone still pressed to his ear as it continued to ring and ring and ring. Liam turned his phone around to show the others the photo, watching as all the colour drained from Harry’s face. He hung up his phone, knowing now that there was no one to answer his call.
“I missed you,” she whispered when they pulled apart. “You look fantastic by the way.”
For your eyes only
“It’s not silly, love,” Harry promised. “I feel the same, and I really wish we were gonna be together when the hiatus announcement drops.”
Your face lit up when you opened the door to be greeted by all 5 members of One Direction, Harry standing in the middle wearing her favourite grin. She laughed as she briefly realised that they were also wearing all black outfits, ensuring that it would look as though she had intentionally dressed to match them. Harry stepped forward, sweeping her into his arms and pulling her into a bruising kiss as the other boys pushed passed them into the hotel suite.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I got an email from a young girl in London a few weeks ago who believed that she’s your daughter,” Pepper said in a rush.
“Hey,” he greeted as she walked towards him.
“I’m really happy for you,” Ella said.
While she was in surgery, Steve and Tony went back to the tower to shower, change clothes and update the team while Harry remained in the waiting room having refused when both men had tried to convince him to go with them. Instead he used the time to call Louis, filling him in on everything the doctors had told them and getting updates on the status of the tour he was currently missing. They had 2 shows out of 6 to go in London when Harry had left, and those along with the Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham shows had all been postponed. Louis told Harry that they were rescheduling the shows for the week following the Sheffield shows that were originally slated to be the end of the tour. This left Harry with 2 weeks in New York before he needed to fly back, although Louis promised that if he needed longer, they would make it work.
The silence that followed his words was thick in the air. No one moved, barely even breathing as the words slowly settled between them. Louis was the first to recover, quickly looking to Harry in dawning horror as Harry pulled his phone from his pocket, already dialling Aurora’s number. Liam also pulled his phone out, pulling up the latest news report. He gasped in shock when the first article included a photo of Steve carrying Aurora out of a building, blood soaking through both of their outfits.
“And then I was thinking I’d really like to do some YouTube collabs, but I have no idea how to make that happen.”
As the evening continued, Rhodey stood, delivering his Best Man speech full of embarrassing anecdotes about his best friend and leading the crowd in a toast to a long and joyous lifetime. Once Rhodey returned to his seat, Aurora stood, taking his place at the microphone on the small stage. As she began to speak, Madz and Xavier filed onto the stage behind her, picking up their guitars in preparation.
“I’m not flying out for another few days,” he replied, not understanding what she was really confessing to.
“This is fantastic Steve,” Happy announced as they all dug into the food spread out across the table.
“You have to go,” Rori urged, pushing him away gently, noticing Niall still waiting by the gate. “Call me when you land.”
“Huge bands on YouTube,” Rori explained. “I think Boyce Avenue have about 5 and half million subscribers. To work with either of them makes a real statement on the platform.”
“We’ve actually called it quits,” Rori chuckled in response to Letterman’s surprise. “We’ve all had an incredible time over the last year and a half, but the wedding last month was our last gig since we’re going our separate ways for college. I’m staying here in the city, but the boys are off to the west coast. It was a great opportunity for all of us but we’re each excited to go our own ways for a while.”
“Good to see you again darl,” he said as the two hugged. “But let’s go, the car’s waiting for us out front.”
“You said you were just going there to cheer Harry up and then you were coming home,” Tony reminded her accusingly. “There was no mention of performing.”
“No, I’m ok,” she promised as he grabbed her around the waist and took off for the tower. They arrived on the balcony a minute later and Tony placed his daughter back on her feet as the suit begin to recede from his body.
“What the fuck is happening?” Rori asked her father, receiving a heavy sigh in response. “I’m looking at everything online and JARVIS is saying they’ve gone completely off the grid.”
“Hello love,” he greeted, throwing an arm around her shoulders when she returned his greeting.
“Probably a good idea,” he chuckled. “I think everyone else is gonna be feeling pretty miserable tomorrow morning. Mind if I ask why?”
“I know,” Rori mumbled. “I know it was stupid. I’m sorry.”
“What’s going on,” Louis asked as he and Liam walked over to join the other two on the sofa.
“I like that idea,” Rori smiled. “Sounds like a plan.”
Aurora wiped away the tears pooling in the corners of her eyes as Tony and Steve exchanged their vows. As Maid of Honour she stood to the left of the two grooms, while Rhodey stood to their right as Best Man. Given that this was the wedding of Tony Stark and Captain America no expense had been spared and the amassed crowd of everyone who was anyone sat under a large canopy of white flowers in the Grand Ballroom of The Plaza Hotel. Steve stood tall in his navy blue dress uniform, while Tony had opted for a crisp white tuxedo. Rhodey was also in full dress uniform, while Aurora wore a floor length designer burgundy gown which perfectly matched the peony boutonniere in her father’s lapel.
“Jesus how old are you?” Rori asked, swinging around to look at her saviour.
“I’m not sure I could handle a big party or anything, but a tree and some decorations would be nice,” she replied.
“With who?”
“Oh, Harry’s family just got here,” Rori said, breaking through Jay’s thoughts. “I better go say hi.”
“Well you need to,” her agent replied. “The response to the Rascal Flatts cover you posted a few days ago is great. Everyone loved it, including Rascal Flatts.”
“Boyce Avenue and Our Last Night want to collab with me,” she explained.
Following the second week of Aurora’s art show, she flew out with the boys for Cardiff, Wales for the start of the next leg of their tour on the 5
“It’s decided then,” Louis announced. “We’re doing this! I’m thinking we slot it in after
“Any chance you’re done being mad at me yet?” she asked.
“Ok, we’ve maybe spent a bit of time together since I flew in on Sunday,” Rori admitted.
Steve looked up from his sketch book to find Aurora standing in the doorway of his art studio, looking shy with her sketch book and pencil case tucked under one arm.
It was Harry’s turn to blush as Aurora burst out laughing. “Hey Lou, can you do me a favour and fuck off please?” Harry asked. Louis joined Aurora in her laughter, stumbling a little in his drunken state as he stepped forward to place his hand on her shoulder.
“That would be great,” Harry said with a huge grin. “You should come with us for some of the tour before you go back to school.”
“I take it you surprised Harry by flying in a week early?” Anne asked once she turned away from her task. “I’m sure he was thrilled.”
“I’m just so glad I didn’t burst out sobbing halfway through,” Rori admitted, “Although I was crying by the end.”
(I feel it, I feel it)
Christmas with Anne, Robin and Gemma was filled with plenty of tea, cosy sweaters, cheesy movies and more food than any of them could eat. By the evening, Aurora was collapsed on the sofa, snuggled up against Harry’s side, sharing a soft blanket as the sound of Michael Bublé filled the living room and Gemma and Anne danced across the rug.
“What the hell happened?” Aurora asked, tears beginning to roll down her cheeks, causing Harry to rush to her side and pull her into his arms.
“I guess it just wasn’t something we wanted to explore,” Rori answered with a shrug. “The band was never meant to be as big as it was. It was just a fun little high school thing, but after the story leaked about me being a Stark it just blew up. None of us ever planned on being famous musicians, you know?”
“Well it’s beautiful,” Anne smiled. “You should both be very proud of it.”
“I was holding my breath,” Rori replied. “We all watched him fall and I just kept waiting for the suit to fire up and for him to fly away but he just kept falling and then the Hulk leapt up and caught him and I don’t even consciously remember standing up or deciding to move but all of a sudden I was running out of the school and a teacher was screaming at me to stay inside but I just knew I needed to get there. I guess it was lucky that he fell near the tower and I was running so fast down the middle of the street, I guess I got to them about 10 minutes after he landed. As soon as I saw that he was alive I just collapsed.”
“I’m starting college next month,” Rori replied. “I got into Columbia University to study fine art and I’m hoping to keep growing my song writing career.”
“It’s nice,” Tony said. “Did you draw it up yourself?” Aurora nodded that she had, tracing her index finger over the ink, smiling at the memory of sitting in the tattoo studio with the two boys, Louis laughing at her as she winced when some of the heavy shading was done.
Don’t forget to leave a comment :)
“Right,” Rori agreed. “Thank you, Sam.”
They sat in silence for a while as Aurora tried to organise her thoughts and absorb Sam’s advice.
The concert continued on with Rori having an incredible time, letting herself pretend she was just another fan in the crowd, screaming along to her favourite songs, but every so often when he passed by her section of the crowd, Harry’s smile would grow and he would throw a wink or blow a kiss in her direction, causing those around her to meltdown and swoon at their idol. Half a dozen songs after he first spotted her, all 5 boys returned to the raised section of staging and Harry sat himself down directly in front of her, with Niall sitting to his left with his guitar. The young couple locked eyes as Zayn sang the opening lines of
“Yeah, the boats rocky,” Rori parroted sarcastically. “That’s definitely why you can’t walk straight.”
They fell silent for a moment, sitting in their shared confessions for a beat before Rori spoke again. “I miss you.”
“You’re welcome, Rori,” Gary said. “There’s actually something we wanted to ask you before you leave. We usually perform at the CMAs in November and me and the boys were talking last night. We were wondering if you’d want to come down and debut
A few minutes later, when she was still shaking and gasping for breath, Harry realised that he was out of his depth. “JARVIS?” he asked. “I need you to get Sam down here now.”
“Told you, you’d be great,” he smiled as she approached him.
“Sure thing, love,” Anne smiled, kissing Harry’s cheek before she left with one last wish of good luck.
“Miss you when I go home too Lou,” Rori promised. “Life’s too boring without my big brother around.”
“Sharing is caring,” Rori joked, laughing loudly when Harry pulled her to her feet and out of Liam’s arms. “Rude!” she giggled, kissing his cheek. She looked back at Liam, glad to see that Harry’s joke had broken the sombre mood they had slipped into, even if he didn’t know that’s what he’d done.
“You had a lot on your plate kiddo,” Tony explained, running his hand through her hair. “Steve and I were pretty sure it’s what you would have wanted us to do.”
“It doesn’t feel real,” she whispered. “Like, I know I have the injuries to prove it, but I feel like I made it up. How could it be real? How could anyone do that?”
Aurora and Harry flew into Columbus, Ohio the day before the band was scheduled to perform there, and while Harry headed for the stadium for rehearsals and interviews, Aurora took a cab to a local music studio.
“If you’re smiling like that while texting a boy then I hate to break it to you but you’re dating,” Clint offered. “I don’t make the rules.”
“Hey love,” Louis greeted Rori with a huge smile. “You ready to do this?”
after the X Factor show and the couple spent the week leading up to Christmas finishing the decorations around the penthouse, watching sappy Christmas themed romcoms and going ice skating in Central Park.
“Of course, I trust you Mark,” Rori promised, beginning to walk again, pressing her thumb firmly into the palm of her other hand nervously. “You wouldn’t be my manager if I didn’t trust you but I’m nervous. I’ve never performed without the guys and millions of people watch the AMAs. What if I screw up?”
“I tried a sip of Harry’s champagne once but otherwise nope.”
“Sounds like a panic attack,” Tony told his daughter. “I had them after the wormhole.”
After the ceremony, while the guests made their way to the gilded Terrace Room, the wedding party made their way outside and across the street to take photos in Central Park, before returning to the hotel to be formally introduced to the waiting guests. Rhodey escorted Aurora into the room first and the pair made their way to the table at the head of the room as behind them Tony and Steve made their entrance, hand in hand to the announcement of, “Mr and Mr Stark-Rogers.”
“That’s very sweat of you H, but I’m not having sex with you on a crowded boat,” Rori chuckled. Harry pouted and returned to leaning against her shoulder, his arms tightening around her waist instead.
“Yeah I did. Some of those girls are absolutely vicious.”
“I could go down there with you if that would help,” Harry offered.
“Ok, have fun kids,” Tony replied. “Make sure you’re back before it gets dark.”
Harry had been right that no one was carding the guests at the afterparty and Aurora easily glided into the venue, ordering a coke at the bar before finding a stool by a table over against the wall. She looked out across the dancefloor and the steadily growing crowd, sipping on her drink and starting to question why she had come. She was not a huge fan of parties, never having been the type to get invited to them in high school and although she had attended a couple of events at the Columbia sorority houses since classes had begun two months earlier, she hadn’t really enjoyed them. She didn’t drink and had never really been great at making friends easily even before she had to worry that people were only being friendly because of her parents. Before she could convince herself that it had been a mistake coming out, she spotted the One Direction boys arrive. She stayed on her stool for another 20 or so minutes before Harry spotted her through the crowd and made his way over to her side.
“God, he’s not due back until Christmas,” Tony sighed.
“There you are,” he said softly, announcing his presence so as not to startle her. He made his way across the room, taking a seat beside her and reaching out to take her hand when she still didn’t turn away from the window. “You ok?” he asked, turning her hand over in his and smiling softly at the diamond ring settled there.
“JARVIS?” she called out, “What do Tony and Steve usually do for Christmas? When do they get a tree or decorate or anything?”
and in an attempt to avoid the paparazzi, Happy picked them up from the airport and brought them to the tower. Once they arrived, Anne pulled Harry into a tight hug while Robin went to greet Aurora. After dropping their bags in one of the guest rooms they all headed for the kitchen where Steve was cooking dinner for everyone. It was a casual night in, just Harry, Aurora and their parents with the rest of the Avengers having dinner on another floor to give them some time with Anne and Robin. Once dinner was finished and the dishes were cleared, they all moved into the living room to watch a movie and stayed up late into the night sharing stories of Christmases past. Aurora always loved when Anne would tell stories from when Harry was little, and he would bury his face in her shoulder as he blushed in embarrassment. Steve entertained them all with stories of Christmases in the 1920s and Aurora shared a few tales from her own childhood. The large pine tree in the corner provided the room a soft glow as they chatted, and the large wall of windows looking out over the city provided a beautiful backdrop. Aurora nuzzled into Harry’s chest as conversation flowed until she finally dropped off to sleep. Everyone took that as a sign to turn in for the night and Harry gently lifted Rori into his arms and carried her to bed.
“I love you,” Harry murmured once her laughter died to down to quiet chuckles. “You look so beautiful. This dress is incredible.”
They lapsed into silence for the rest of the drive and when they finally arrived, Happy walked Harry passed the media camped outside the front doors, waiting for any updates on the survivors.
“Like Tony said,” Steve replied, “Aurora’s so incredible and being her dad is probably the best thing I’ve ever done with my life. I’m very lucky to have her as my daughter. As our daughter.”
“Harry,” Steve said, pulling him into a hug. “Thanks for coming.”
“Thank you,” she gasped, trying not to cry again. “God damn it. I feel like all I ever do these days is cry.”
“Talk to you soon Mark.”
She chuckled, leaning up to kiss his cheek before disappearing into the crowd. She returned after a while, a glass of water in hand and Harry’s arm darted out to pull her against his side as soon as she reappeared. She rested her head against his shoulder, secure against him as the conversation swelled around her.
“Sounds like fun,” Rori said as the pair finally reached the back of the large house to find the previously mentioned group sat around a fire pit on the patio.
Harry opened his arms in silent invitation, breathing a sigh of relief when she accepted, nestling against his chest as his arms wrapped around her protectively.
I've been emotionally listening to Rascal Flatt's 'How They Remember You' EP and wishing they weren't ending the band because I adore them so it was natural that I had to make them collab with Aurora. If you've never listened to them, I would highly recommend even though I know that a lot of people hate country. At the very least go listen to 'Hands Talk', 'Yours if you want it' and of course 'Are you happy now?'
“It always made me feel better - after,” Steve said. "It made me feel like yours again."
“Damn right,” Tony said, smiling approvingly. “Give me one good reason not to tan your hide.”
“I don’t know,” Steve said, plucking at the blades of grass. “I guess it would have been easier if I hated you. Like I was supposed to. You took away my parents, my home, everything I ever cared about. You stood in the way of our freedom. I wanted so badly to hate you back then.”
Steve’s eyes flew open and he breathed shallowly through his parted lips. “You wouldn’t hurt me. I just – I just want to feel you,” he gasped, his voice a desperate whisper.
Steve gulped. He knew the answer. Still, he struggled to say it.
It didn’t take long for Steve to reach his climax. He came with his head thrown back, eyes closed and lips parted, sobbing his pleasure as he spilled over his stomach. Tony fucked him through his orgasm, watching Steve as he lay, calm and pliant, waiting for him to reach his. It came swiftly, the waves of pleasure building up at the base of his cock, before cresting as he spilled deep inside his boy, marking his insides.
Tony clicked his tongue in disapproval as he stopped his assault. He slid a hand between his legs, stroking the length of his swelling cock. The rough hand around him provided Steve with an incentive to stay still, or at last not to jerk away, so Tony could leave broad stripes on his bottom as he sobbed into the carpet.
Tony had come to see the light, and it revealed all the cracks and flaws in the system. Perhaps, some of Steve’s beliefs hadn’t been so absurd.  Democracy wasn’t a bad idea. After all, any other man or woman would have been more qualified, more capable, more functional at being a king than he was.
“They used to be, until they developed a more violent agenda of their own. Order through chaos. Something like that," Steve said, shaking his head. "They're against the accords," he added.
He was quiet now, silent tears running down his cheeks as he strained in misery, his muscles flexing and unflexing as he endured the harsh strokes on his thighs. His back was coated in perspiration, the evidence of his suffering in the sultry evening heat.
“I know,” Tony said, letting out a bitter laugh.
Under them was the book they’d read together -
Exhausted, Steve lay in bed, trying to catch his breath. Tony wiped him with a towel, rinsing it in a washbasin, as he cleaned the drying tears and sweat from his beautiful face. He went over the rest of his body, memorising the feel of each plane and curve, while he removed all the traces of sweat and come. The red marks on his bottom would fade in a week or so, but hopefully, Steve would remember him for longer than that.
Tony gazed at his sweet, loving husband, and wondered where the feral alpha from a moment ago had disappeared to. “Want no one else,” he promised as he pulled Steve right back into his arms.
“Not sorry for running though?” Tony asked, noticing the omission. “You’re going to try again, aren’t you?”
Tony had washed him in the shower, gently running the washcloth over his sore bottom as he cleaned the oil and come off of him. He’d towelled him dry, patting him gently before ordering him back over the bed.
*** The End ***
“I’ll be damned. The prodigal son returns,” Tony said, as Gerald nuzzled the back of his hand.
Tony lowered his smarting hand, and placed his palms on the insides of his thighs, to spread himself wide for Steve.
And Tony had been so, so wrong.
Tony’s hands caressed the boy’s bare back, smoothing away the tension under the skin before coming to rest at the swell of his firm cheeks. Parting them, Tony could see the dusky pink cleft and his tender rosebud. It was just as he’d ordered - washed and oiled for his pleasure.
“I missed this,” Steve said quietly, above the cackling of the fire. “I missed you.”
Tony made a sound of approval, sliding his other hand down his body so he could fondle the firm balls and take hold of the young man’s cock. Humming appreciatively, he gave it a few slow strokes until Steve thrusted forward in an attempt to fuck his hand. Tony squeezed Steve's cock in warning, as he withdrew his finger, smacking his naughty hole several times to calm him down. “Patience, love. There’s a lot we need to talk about.”
It wasn’t an unusual punishment. Applying the crop to a boy’s tender hole was widely considered an effective method of discipline. Even young princes like Tony hadn’t been spared during his formative years.
Blue eyes widened with understanding as Tony climbed off, watching the young man pull his vest over his head and slide his shorts off.
“Gotcha!” Steve said lightly, as a look of triumph spread across his face. “Admit it then. All this – the clothes, the club, falling off the stage, are part of your grand plan to get dicked.”
“Zemo,” Steve echoed, with contempt. From his satchel, Steve pulled out a box and handed it to Tony. “We found this among his possessions, at our last raid. I think it belonged to your father.”
But why?
His heart had long been broken.
“No,” he answered, before opening his mouth to accept Tony’s cock again. It pushed against the walls of his throat, making it hard to breathe, and by the time it was over, he was feeling lightheaded.
It wasn’t long before cool leather caressed his rim. Tony tapped on it, lightly, a few times, practising his aim, before bringing it straight down on the target.
Unless it was the truth.
In those times of darkness, Tony wondered if he would once again see the light of his life. If he got to set eyes on his angel, just for a moment, he’d happily spend eternity in heaven or hell or wherever they sent people like him - the ones who did all the wrong things for the right reasons, fucking everything up as they bumbled along their way.
Steve shot him a dark look. “Obviously not enough,” he whispered harshly and nibbled on an earlobe. “Do you have any idea how you looked, dressed in that see-through number with those pants hugging your round ass?"
“Did I hurt you?”
A warm tongue slipped into his mouth, and Tony closed his eyes as the scents of chocolate and vanilla mixed together in a heady rush.
Tony watched, open-mouthed and slack-jawed, as Steve took down three more guards, one of whom was about to plunge his knife into Tony’s chest. Tony knew Steve was strong and able. He could tell from the way his muscles rippled, from the effortless way he carried Tony to bed. But out here, he was in his element - beautiful, powerful.
Tony ignored his pleas, so Steve sighed and resumed the position. In no time, warm hands were on his bottom, examining the damage it had taken.
“Sir…” he whimpered.
It didn’t take long for the belt to do its work, turning Steve into a sputtering mess. He found it increasingly hard to hold his position, often twisting away from the pain.
“He’s my friend.”
“They get punished,” he mumbled.
Steve did, spreading them as much as he could.
They kissed for a long time. It could have been seconds, minutes or hours. Tony neither knew nor cared. It felt like time had stopped as the world crumbled to their feet. There was no pain, no suffering, no war.
“We lay low. Try not to get killed. Fury is cleaning house as we speak. Then, the accords. The monarchy is over, but nobody wants to see you gone. We need you, Tony, as an advisor, a minister. You can even run for president if you want,” he added, only half-joking.
Preoccupied with the safe return of his lover, punishment had been the farthest thing from his mind. Quite frankly, all Tony wanted to do was to hold him and kiss him and tell him he was forgiven, but that wouldn’t sit well with the other generals. After all, it had been their men that the boy had wounded in his escape. Stane would have very much liked a public display, perhaps shoving the boy atop the wooden pony, a cruel mockery of his failed escape. If not that, then, at the very least, they would have demanded a beating as recompense for their men’s suffering.
Inwardly, Steve groaned. He didn’t want any more punishment, and not on his hole, but there was no point in begging. He learnt that the hard way. “Yes, sir,” he said instead, trying his best to be the good boy Tony wanted him to be.
“Hurt me back,” Steve told him, taking one of Tony's hands and pressing it against his damp cheek.
Tony felt loved and cherished, and wet and open, with the combination of spit and slick dribbling down the back of his thighs. He wanted more. He needed more. He whined when Steve pulled away, and wiggled his bottom in invitation.
Tony thought they would be over that by now. The boy had promised to stay. He’d pledged this loyalty to him. Tony liked to think that he had finally become accustomed to palace life and fond of Tony’s company. But at times like these, Tony had to confront the bitter truth - that he had only offered himself in exchange for the freedom of his comrades - Barnes, Wilson, Romanova. It was no coincidence that he’d tried to escape the day after fresh plans to pursue said rebels had been approved.
Tony had his reasons for putting it off, the obvious one being that he had no wish to hurt his precious wildling. More importantly, he knew this was a last resort. If punishment as harsh as this failed to break his spirit, then nothing ever would.
Tony nudged his legs apart. “Spread,” he said. “You know the drill.” Steve felt his face burning with shame as did, well aware of what was on display.
“And now it is?”
Steve moaned. He was. The ladies at the spa had scrubbed his cleft and taint too, so the whole area was pink and sensitive to the touch.
“All eyes were on you, following the sway of your hips, staring at the jiggle of your round ass. They have no right to look at you like that. You’re mine,” Steve complained, and stuck out his bottom lip unhappily.
Tony turned around to kiss his lover’s parted lips, slipping his tongue into that warm mouth.  His hand trailed down Steve’s chest, caressing his soft skin before finding his hard and wet cock - proof of his desire.
Abruptly, he turned the other way, not wanting the younger man to see the tears in his eyes. Steve shifted to lie on his side, holding Tony and nuzzling his back, pressing his hardness against Tony as he softly kissed his neck.
“Are you going to be good now?” Tony asked, when he finally decided he'd had enough.
Steve watched them for a while with a look akin to fondness. “He missed you.”
Tony’s gaze shifted from his horse’s face to Steve’s and back. “Yeah. Missed him too.”
They had been fighting. Steve was talking about Athens, and their successes, extolling the merits of a democracy. And Tony had been hurt, offended even, at how passionate he was about having him replaced.
Tony was not amused. “Down,” he whispered, pointing at where he wanted him with his shoe.
“I believe you,” Tony said, planting a kiss on the middle of his bottom, where a red mark was beginning to appear. “Shhh… Shhh… It’s all right, my love. You’re doing so well. Can you turn over now? Turn around and lie on your back?”
Still, it finally got too much. Steve broke away, covering his striped bottom with his hands. The cruel belt crashed across his hands, causing Steve to squeal and jump up, making for quite the comical sight.
Tony hummed. “You know, you're right. Your poor bottom has had quite enough,” he said, and Steve felt himself feeling light with hope. Then, Tony’s hands were spreading his cheeks, giving Tony a good view of what lay between. Tony stroked his cleft, drawing circles around his hole. “But we’ve neglected this, haven’t we?”
Tony’s body melted into the bed as he felt light and soft. He floated away, unaware that Steve had pulled all the way out until he slammed himself back in.
“Perfect. This will make the crop more enjoyable. Don’t move,” Tony ordered before leaving him, presumably to fetch the wicked riding crop.
“Thank me properly,” Tony said as he grabbed a fistful of Steve’s hair, so Steve trailed behind him toward the bed, still on his hands and knees.
“So, it’s been a day of revelations,” Tony said, lying down beside Steve, completely exhausted. “Is there anything else I need to know before I try to get some sleep?”
Tony made a soft sound of protest as the intrusive fingers delved in and out, and kindled a fire which soon spread to the rest of his body. “You’re my alpha,” Tony said in what he hoped was an appeasing tone. “Can’t possibly forget that. You remind me every day.”
It didn’t take long before Tony was gasping and moaning. “Oh - oh Steeeeeeve!!!” he moaned as he spilled all over his stomach, his thighs trembling from the waves of pleasure still cresting through his body.
“What - is this an olive branch?”
He turned Steve over, so he lay on his elbows and knees, punished bottom in the air. With a steady hand, he drizzled the oil from the bottle directly down the cleft, spreading it evenly so a thick layer coated the swollen boycunt, and slowly worked his fingers into the pretty pink rose.
“Don’t we all?” he asked, sardonically. Tony sank back, resting his weight on his elbows, as his head reeled with all the information. He fixed his eyes on the younger man. “Why didn’t
. “I’m sorry,” he said.
Steve’s eyes flew open as he bit his lower lip, as if deep in thought. “No, I don’t think so,” he said slowly. “Oh, except…” he trailed off.
This takes place about a year after the events of chapter 1! I don't think there is anything requiring a warning in this chapter, but please let me know if I missed anything out. I hope you like it. :D
“And?”
Steve was on the bed, head buried under a pillow as he stayed on his hands and knees. His back was arched so his bottom stayed raised in the air. His legs were spread, giving Tony the perfect view of his hole, his balls and his soft cock.
“You see,” Tony said slowly, slipping his finger back inside his soft cunt, slowly fucking his sweet boy, who was so so so soft, warm and tight. “We're going to need a new home.” His fingers moved in a slow circle, stretching the ring of muscle. “This cabin is a real tight squeeze. I mean there’s barely any room for two,” he said, stressing the word as he inserted a second finger, drawing a choked gasp from Steve, who squeezed back in response.
“Oh!” Tony moaned as sweeping fingers brushed over his sweet spot. He bit his bottom lip to stifle another moan. “Is it working?” he asked.
“Talk? About what?” Steve whined, which earned him a glare from Tony.
“Prove it then," Steve said. “Kiss me,” he asked.
“No, I don’t,” he admitted. “Sometimes…”
It was an obsession. Like a long line of great leaders before him, besotted with a pretty face. And his was indeed beautiful, with his soft hair, wet eyes and pink lips, swollen from biting down on them in an attempt to remain silent while his well-muscled body struggled in his binds.
Tony didn’t even know.
“No, not at all.” Tony put his arms around the small of his back as Steve pressed a soft kiss to his neck.
“Come for me,” Tony said.
Tony brought his palm down on his left bottom cheek, causing Steve to gasp in surprise. “I asked a question,” he said. He brought his palm down on his right cheek too. No favourites.
They lay there for a couple of minutes to catch their breaths, with Tony holding Steve close to him, rubbing his hands up and down his back.
A wave of sympathy washed over him as he listened to his pained cries. It was the rebel's nature to be defiant. That was exactly why he’d joined the revolution, idealistic and naïve that their uprising would stand a chance against his armed forces.
He heard the rustling before he saw – the unmistakable shaking of that blonde head as a loud sob pierced the silence. “I can’t,” the boy cried.
Tony sat up slowly, climbing over Steve to straddle his hips and brushed away the long bangs away from Steve's eyes. In those moments of silence where they just gazed at each other, Tony learnt that Steve had the longest lashes he’d ever seen and there were tiny flecks of green in his blue eyes, which still burned fiercely.
Tony resisted the urge to roll his. Of course, Steve, unwaveringly loyal to the ones he loved, would think so. “Then why did Zemo insist?” Tony countered, remembering the general’s damning evidence of Barnes’ guilt.
“What happens now?” Tony asked, the next morning, as he watched Steve saddle the horses in preparation of their long journey.
“Yes, sir,” he sobbed.
It was really challenging to write the plot and the feelings and the smut altogether and it really makes me respect writers like sabre who do the worldbuilding and plotty twists and sexy smut all in the same story!
“Beautiful,” Tony said, admiring his little display of humility. “I think I’ll keep you like this for a while, let the lesson sink in.” Tony’s fingers trailed over his hole and the cleft, finally cupping his balls. “How do you feel?” he asked.
“That so? Having fun now?” he asked after a particularly hard thrust.
“No, not yet,” Tony said, keeping his breathing even and his voice level.
Tony ran a hand through Steve’s long hair, softly tugging at the roots, and Steve’s eyes flickered in silent understanding. They’d done this so many times that no words were needed. Shifting so that Tony was sitting on his bottom, Steve got to a kneel.
They never spoke of it. And that was the first and only time Steve had tried to take his life.
Steve sighed in relief as the soothing gel made contact with his sore skin. A generous layer was applied over his bottom, and Tony took the time to rub it into his cleft and hole.
“What did I tell you in the car just a couple of hours ago?”
Steve could only nod his head, too far down to speak. Lining the tip of his cock with Steve’s hole, Tony pushed, slipping in easily due to the extensive preparation. It was warm and tight and clenching around him in a way that felt like heaven. Tony would stay buried in Steve forever if he could, but his bossy lover was rocking his hips, pleading, demanding that he move.
It reminded Tony of the first time they made love.
Steve wanted to go home.
“You’re too good for me. Someday, you’ll realise you want something better,” he said, with a face all serious as he explained himself. “I just want to hold on to you as long as I can.”
Tony moved in time with Steve’s thrusts, and arched his back as Steve continued to pound his sweet spot, all the while whispering filthy nothings in his ear while he could only clench weakly around Steve.
A hand stroked Tony’s length while the other fondled his balls, and the combination of sensations turned his brains to mush. “Steve… Oh Steve!”
“I tend to get carried away.”
Steve did, lying on his back so Tony could see his flushed face and heaving chest. Tony straddled his hips, sweeping Steve’s long bangs to one side. Placing a kiss in the middle of Steve’s forehead, he whispered. “My dear, headstrong boy. So clever and determined. Always a way out with you. Mine,” he said, kissing the spot again.
Tony scrambled to comply with the long list of demands, and spread his knees as far as he could. Large, warm hands were soon on his cheeks and pulling them apart to inspect his slick, wet hole.
It was a warm evening, so they were comfortable in their underclothes, neither of them embarrassed by the lack of clothing. Using branches that Steve had skinned and sharpened at one end, they skewered the fish and roasted them over the fire, shoving the thick end of the spit into the ground to free their hands.
