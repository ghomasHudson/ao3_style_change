Fuck.
At least there’s one thing that Tony and Steve could agree on: paperwork. Not the most stimulating topic for friendships to blossom from but Tony wasn’t exactly expecting to develop a close relationship with Steve while he worked for him, anyway.
But considering Tony’s reckless personality and his well-known carefree behavior, Steve highly doubted he would even be aware of a fight between the brunet and his ex before it was all over. Tony could be so discreet sometimes. And dangerous.
“Did you want to make those kisses, by-the-minute?”
“Maybe we should catch up on all we’ve missed being apart this past year.” Steve suddenly proposed after splitting their embrace. “How about getting a coffee together, tomorrow? Preferably a chocolate-hazelnut flavored one?”
Stopping their journey on the bridge above the relaxed and shallow river, the couple leaned next to each other against the railing, resting their bodies after a long night of commotion.
Steve sighed softly in relief, a surge of hope creeping its way into his heart for a moment before subduing into a strange rest of partially comfort, and the other part full of admiration for the girl who basically ran Stark Industries.
So essentially, it was all just a miniature scavenger hunt. Sure, it was an odd method to confess your love to your crush, but it would certainly get the job done better than Tony just outright babbling about the emotions that he felt and didn’t fully understand, right at Steve.
“Good.” Tony separated from Steve but his hand was still gently gripping the blond’s wrist. “Because the party only starts when I arrive, and I’m obviously not going if you won’t be there.”
Steve ignored Tony and Clint as they began to argue over who should hold the popcorn bowl — “Clint, you
‘Yes, ma’am,’ he agrees promptly and wonders why the only women he’s even know personally are scary.
'I won't tell him,' Pepper finally agrees, 'but we're going to talk about this again when I get there.'
Thor nods solemnly and Clint shrugs,
'You have me,' Tony just smiles and presses an alcohol flavoured kiss to his lips.
'I'm worried I've lost my virginity to a phone!' Steve blurts.
'Yeah, they did,' Tony agrees. 'A very tasteful light blue carpet. It, apparently, goes very well with the even lighter blue walls and the furniture that'll turn up tomorrow.'
'Good morning, Tony,' he greets the other man in confusion.
The rest of his team needs him.
‘Can’t that wait?’ Steve asks as another spray of sparks fly across the workshop from one of the automated workstations.
Tony fiddles with his glass as he tops it up then paces the room,
‘Yes.’
'He's forgiving me for Jim, so he'll forgive me for this, right Jay?'
'Hmm,' Natasha apparently approves. 'Good.'
Steve is getting far too used to this.
'Alright,' he laughs and presses the buttons he's memorised to mean a simple white coffee with one sugar.
‘I’ll… go then.’
'Of course, Mister Stark,' she smiles. 'Would you like a straw with that?'
Tony’s noticeably forcing himself to stop touching the arc reactor where it’s bothering him. He’s broken into a sweat as a he starts to run a fever, which is worrying but not as worrying as when Steve notices that he’s bleeding.
‘I’m fine,’ Tony interrupts. ‘Jarvis, how often do I have nightmares now?’
Steve visibly hesitates, but then his shoulders slump a little and he picks up the basket. Tony steps well out of his way as he moves to the lift and watches as he steps inside.
'Even better, it turned itself on,' Tony walks in a circle and swears a few times before continuing. 'The readings since then are stable though.'
'Well met, brother of my shield brother!'
Steve carries his muffins onto his floor and places them on the coffee table. He glares at them for a moment.
*          *          *
‘Sure, Tony,’ Steve agrees reluctantly and steps into the corridor to speak to one of the agents posted as guards.
'See what Pepper found for me?'
Steve's world crashes to a stop for the second time today.
Tony pulls away after an eternal moment and the helmet is in place before Steve opens his eyes.
'Next time I say you can come I'm making sure Natasha can come too,' he threatens good naturedly.
'Sir is my primary concern,' Jarvis reverts to sounding like a computer when he doesn't want to talk.
Which car?
'I missed you,' Steve types back candidly.
‘What did we tell the board at the time?’
The next chapter is pretty damn fluffy to apologise for breaking all your hearts/souls/lives etc. It isn't ready yet though, so maybe tomorrow?
'So it's gone midnight... I did promise Pepper that I would spend today licking Steve,' Tony gazes over at the exit.
'Tony!' he shouts down the comm. desperately.
When Tony speaks Steve almost jumps.
'I'm glad I...'
'Tony, please. Just spend some time with Steve; try to relax and maybe a new solution will come to you.'
Tony looks up in surprise,
'Jarvis, fly a couple of the suits out to the Mansion for me,' he adds as he walks to the lift.
'Wonderful,' he slumps over onto his back and pushes the covers from his face.
Pete grabs his blanket and holds up his arms to be picked up. Steve obliges him and has stepped out of his suite before he remembers he isn't wearing a shirt.
Tony grins as he presses a quick kiss to his boyfriend's leg and then resumes circling his hole before pressing back in. Thrusting his tongue in and out makes Steve make the most awesome noises.
'Marvellous,' he stretches and relaxes back bonelessly.
He's a really crappy boyfriend.
'I'm painting Captain America,' Pete tells him.
'Fuck yes!' Tony hisses as his own release washes over him.
He giggles and tries to stop himself but then Steve is clutching him close and laughing too,
Steve starts painting an Iron Man suit with a child's proportions; Tony should get a kick out of it.
That's a thing? Steve thinks and then draws a complete blank on what he could even possibly say.
'Good,' Steve arches his back and pulls off his t-shirt as Tony sits back to give him space. Tony grinds down against his crotch and Steve makes a strange yelping-whining noise and clutches and Tony's hips.
'Sorry, baby,' he presses a kiss to his son's head. 'I'll be back soon.'
Upstairs on the Avengers' communal floor Clint and Natasha are lounging and watching a different news channel. They both look over at him intently when he steps off the lift.
'Very cool,' Thor nods.
'I... Excuse me?' Steve stutters.
'Jarvis taught me to take photos and videos,' Steve blushes as he gestures with his phone. 'And showed me how to save them to the server.'
'Wow,' Steve murmurs and glances at him.
Tony’s laughing,
Fury wants a debriefing.
He looks out the window and across the gardens behind the mansion,
'Look,' he interrupts her with the tone she knows he means he's actually being serious, 'what does it matter? It's just DNA. If he wants to be in the kid's life, he will be, if he wants to be responsible for helping look after him and protect him, he can. What does it matter if I don't tell him? If he doesn't want anything to do with him then it's for the best that he doesn't feel obliged.'
Wait, the Mansion?
And if you're all very good I should have a second chapter up later tonight...
'It helps that he isn't scared of him,' Natasha adds with a smirk.
Steve’s heart breaks a little.
‘I’m fine,’ Tony agrees and then winces and puts a hand to the glow in his chest. ‘Actually this hurts like hell, but I’m not in danger any longer. Jarvis, I still have some pain killers down here somewhere?’
Jarvis directs him back to the ballroom and he steps into the room to see Tony's already dropping down to meet him.
Steve, Bruce, Clint and Natasha are just chatting in the area that’s become their communal living space when suddenly the lights adjust down, some music starts playing quietly and the door opens. Tony steps though holding the suitcase suit, which he drops by the door, and a tablet.
'Do you not?' Thor gazes at him innocently.
'Alright,' Tony shrugs, 'but I'll give you fair warning; Pete hogs the sheets and wakes up at a horrifyingly early time in the morning.'
'The basket of a hundred muffins I gave him yesterday when I told him about... our son.'
Tony has another coffee and showers as he deals with his messages in his head and then gets a little distracted by a new idea for propulsion for the Quinjets.
'Oh,' Tony blinks. 'Well, he hugged me and I nearly licked his neck.'
Tony pulls himself away gently and pants as he takes himself in hand and quickly jerks off before crawling further up the bed and curling against Steve's side.
'I love you,' Tony informs him as he relinquishes his son and attacks his breakfast.
'Your Dada gave you some spending money, right Pete?' he checks.
'Oh. Are horses better than cars?'
'I'm not going down there like this.'
Steve sighs and leans against the wall,
The boy on Steve's lap then squirms enough to get to the floor and run to the man who is apparently his father.
'With me?' Tony laughs with a pure amusement that only breaks Steve's heart more.
‘What?!’ Steve doesn’t even know what to say to that.
'Indian?' Natasha sniffs.
'A garden?' he gives Steve a bemused look. 'One, yes, of course there's a garden; it's a mansion. Two, haven't you been there before? And Three, he isn't going to be playing in the garden.'
'Good,' Pepper approves and walks closer.
This all comes back to Tony not thinking well enough of him to trust him with this.
'Yes it is,' Tony agrees as Pete tries to pull it from its sheath.
Tony pulls off to press kisses to Steve's navel,
‘Of course, sir,’ Jarvis sounds resigned.
'Hey,' Tony just hugs him back, 'that's fine; you're coming with me. You can play in my workshop while I'm working. We'll take your toys with us, ok?'
But it is mortifying.
'The shrapnel's from a bomb, actually,' she corrects. 'Are you back at the Tower?'
'Hungry, huh?' Tony just smiles at him as he cuts the apple into slices. 'There you go.'
They meet Tony’s jet while still over the ocean. Tony uses up most of the remains of the arc reactor’s power by going across to the jet to collect the new reactor while they’re still in mid-air.
Tony can't think of a single thing to say.
'Please.'
'What did he do?'
Tony named their son after him and Bucky?
‘I forgive you, sir.’
'It's a boy,' Bruce adds, 'for what it's worth.'
‘You didn’t make him explain?’
'Thanks,' he smiles. 'Can I help at all?'
Steve’s military training is the only thing that stops him spinning to check on Tony.
'It's a real sword!' Pete grins at him.
'AIM are into some weird ass shit,' Tony informs them.
Bruce just smiles,
Tony just hums vaguely.
'Good, because Anthony is a pretty terrible name,' Tony smirks.
'Sir is aware of the situation, Captain,' Jarvis replies tersely. 'We shall update you when we can,' the line cuts off.
'Thanks, Jay,' he straightens his jacket. 'When the last of your sensors arrive from the Tower have them sent up.'
'The famous Ms Potts again?'
'I don't understand,' Steve admits. 'You always act like Howard was such a terrible father but...' he falters when Tony gives a fake laugh.
‘Do you want to watch a movie with us?’ Steve asks hesitantly.
‘I told you,’ she tells Tony warmly. She takes the glass from Steve and hands it to her boss.
'Tony...' Steve looks so devastatingly confused.
'He's three!' Tony spins back around to snap at them.
But yes, once again a double update, so be good and I'll be back in a few minutes ;-p
'I'm not going to sleep with him,' Tony tells him again. 'I know all the reasons it would be a terrible idea.'
Steve stares at the closed door for several seconds after Tony has left with his son.
'You're not his uncle,' Tony's looks a little pained, 'you're Cap.'
‘Sure,’ Tony accepts, ‘if you think so.’
And then freaks out a little when he realises that he is.
'In bed,' he looks back to his work. 'It's really quite late.'
'I might be wrong,' Pepper allows. 'People hero worship Tony all the time and Steve doesn't have that many friends.'
'I am merely curious how many things we can do together,' Tony tells him as he wriggles out of his clothes.
‘You are welcome, sir,’ Jarvis responds promptly.
Steve sits down across from Tony and leans against the wall,
'Pass the Korma,' Tony beckons and serves his son once Bruce has put the dish in front of him.
'The Stark Industries store at Columbus Circle,' he guy looks miserable. 'Please believe me?'
Which isn't to say he stops thinking about him or what happened over the phone.
Dummy chirps angrily and pokes his head into Steve’s eye line to reach the reactor.
‘Monaco,’ if Tony says anything else Steve doesn’t hear it as the lift doors close behind him.
'Ok...' he feels Steve nuzzle his hair. 'Love you...'
He gets up from the table,
‘If Jarvis is wrong and his memory doesn’t come back he won’t learn trust us again if we just let him go.’
Pepper doesn't bat an eyelash.
'Yeah,' he laughs.
Tony laughs easily,
'You may not believe me, Captain, but sir did believe this would not hurt you.'
'Clone?' Tony tips his head in the identical way to Peter earlier. 'No. I don't know who the other parent is.'
'Good morning,' Bruce steps into the kitchen and eyes them both.
'I just don't understand why you didn't trust me!' Steve suddenly snaps. 'Why don't you trust me? What do I have to
'Of course, and Cap actually. Pete is quite convinced that Cap making me coffee in the morning is essential for my health,' he aims for charming with his grin.
'Agreed,' Thor rolls the car towards him, 'I shall be most careful so that I am able to return it to you undamaged.'
'Sure...' Steve shakes his head and refocuses on Pete. 'Hey, buddy, would you like to do some painting?'
Steve suddenly was facing with the one truth that he was absolutely not prepared for this evening: Tony had probably never come to the masquerade ball in the first place.
“I know,” He repeated, again. “I know I should’ve have went to go find him, but Rhodey just dismissed me every time I went over to Tony’s place to talk. He wouldn’t let me in, no matter what I did.”
“Oh, okay,” Steve reached for a handful of popcorn, wrapped his arm around Tony’s hips, once the brunet had calmed down, and pulled him closer so they could cuddle. “Hey, do you think we could watch something else after this movie?”
───────
The blond grinned as he stroked one hand through Tony’s messy, yet elegantly-styled hair.
“Geez, sorry,” Bucky chuckled and held up his hands in surrender. “I’m sure it tastes amazing.”
“You dumbass,” Tony laughed softheartedly. “The truth is: I’m beginning to think that my dad was actually sort of right…”
“Do you see how many people are crowded around that thing?” Tony raised his eyebrow at the blond. “This is so dumb to post a piece of paper as the official casting list, why couldn’t they just personally email us? I’m not going in there until all these people start to leave.”
Rhodey’s dark-brown eyes were already lighting up as his head immediately came up with a solution to Steve’s concerns. They twinkled as Rhodey smiled smugly, his gaze never leaving the blond’s face as he addressed both Bucky and Steve at the same time.
And Steve’s beautiful signature was sealed in ink below it.
“Sorry!” The person said as the two of them simultaneously jerked their hands back. “Didn’t see you there, my bad.”
“Sorry, Rhodey, but I guess we’re going to have to tell the rest of the guys that Steve won’t be able to make it,” Bucky turned to Steve at the end of his sentence and glared at him. “
Bucky chuckled and scratched the back of his head, “Seriously? Steve, c’mon, I know you’re busy and all, but you really have to get it together.”
“It’s just…” He faltered. “You love me. You
more recent offers, ranging from photographs from the late 1800’s to autobiographies by today’s famous celebrities. Almost every single person’s hands within the library, including the ladies behind the front desk, were grasping a book with their noses buried a foot into it.
“Miss, would you mind if we used the back storage room to talk really quickly, please?” Pepper forced a minute smile.
Tony should have really chosen someplace better to spend his weekend.
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
Steve frowned, “Why don’t we both get our minds off of these… situations, that we’re, admittedly and awkwardly in? Do you want to go somewhere that we can — I don’t know — talk in peace? If you would like to, that is.”
“I don’t want him for his money, or for his fame, or even for just the drama that comes with dating a person like him, I just… I just want his presence. It’s the most colossal thing that I miss about him: his presence.”
He halted for a second to consider his next words, but not unsure of what to say next.
“What’s got you in such a good mood, Steven?” His father, King Joseph, asked. “Were you thinking about Anthony again?”
“Are you sure, Tones?” The blond questioned, concerned. “You don’t seem fine to me.”
“Stay away from Tony.” Steve warned him, cold and calmly. “Step even ten fucking feet near him and every bone in your body will be reduced to ashes and dust before you can even process it and you’ll wake up in a full-body cast in the fucking hospital. Understood?”
“I’m sorry for getting so worked up over this, Steve. But have you seen yourself? You haven’t eaten a proper dinner in a week! And I highly doubt that your lunches
More often than not, attempting to get his friends and coworkers the credit that they deserved was almost impossible. Especially when he was a world-famous artist and millionaire. People seemed to only want to pay attention to him yet Steve hated diminishing the significance of his friends whenever they stood next to him at a press conference. It was always a horrific and unbearably guilty feeling but his friends never seemed to mind. They were the best that Steve could ever ask for, in that way.
The blond plastered on a shaky smile and gestured for everyone to rise.
about it - but no promises.”
The first part, the 11.8767%, would just be the chance of the blond never finding out about Tony's feelings for him at all.
Sadly, Steve was too preoccupied getting a thank-you kiss from Tony and gleefully tasting the chocolate on the brunet’s lips, to notice what Clint had just said.
Steve’s heartbeat echoed and thumped against his eardrums but that didn’t stop him as he rushed forward, finally feeling the missing warmth of Tony’s body within his grasp and he learned down to catch the brunet’s surprised gasp in-between his lips.
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
“Hey, Tones!” A voice pierced through the thoughts running at a million miles an hour in Steve’s head.
If there was one thing that James Rupert Rhodes was good at that wasn’t sculpting, it was convincing his idiotic best friend to actually take care of himself every now and then. Sure, he wasn’t as good as or as intimidating as Pepper, but he still got the job done.
Pepper rolled her eyes and pushed her neatly tied ponytail of strawberry blonde hair behind her head.
He couldn’t possible fuck it up anymore than he already had if he went to go apologize to Tony tomorrow, right?
The college student glanced at each one of his friends in the conference room where they were all currently, patiently awaiting for him to speak. All of them had been kind enough to follow him and support him as he tried to reach out to his once-boyfriend and previous absolute-light-of-his-life. The one who he had lost all because of his own idiotic assumptions.
He rushed off into the night in search of his pickup truck.
Ignoring Tony’s pleas to come back, Steve jammed his key into the ignition and sped away into the haunting silence of the night.
It was probably unhealthy to be so colossally in love with someone this much — but if that’s what it takes, then Tony would unhesitatingly give his entire life if it meant he could never stop being so childishly in-love with Steve. It was honestly overwhelming how committed he was to the blond.
“Schedule an appointment with me, any time, any day; just be on time.” She told the group as she dusted off her skirt to leave. “And Steve? Good luck. You’re going to need it. After all, we’re all just hoping for the best here. Tony included.”
The nightclub or the bar nearby sounded really nice right about now. Maybe he should even go to the local Chinese restaurant to try some of their supposed “fantastic” cuisine.
“ciao” - hi
Tony asked within his head.
The brunet turned to face Steve and the two of them reached up and removed their masks at the same time.
Steve pulled apart for a second to look at his boyfriend’s face again, “I will, but just wait until Christmas Morning, sweetheart.
“Thank you for that.” She nodded in appreciation. “That’s all I really needed to hear. That you’re still willing to put in everything you have and could possibly offer to prove that you still love him. That’s all I really wished to hear from you today.”
A comforting silence settled between the two as the guests circled around them began to separate. The pair, unaware of their actions, simply stared into each other’s eyes until they were suddenly interrupted by the clapping that accompanied the King and Queen of Americandia arising onto the grand stage.
At that point, Steve couldn’t hold back anymore as his heart caved in to his natural instinct as he stepped forward, scooped up Tony in his arms—and kissed him. Their lips connected and their bodies fit together perfectly, like the pieces of a puzzle snapping together to form a bigger picture. And that picture was just being constructed and fabricated out of the recent rediscovery of this feeling that Steve just sometimes forgot was always there and when it does finally decide to show itself—it was like floating on a cloud and getting high off of the sunshine up in the sky.

“Thank you for understanding. And for being willing to listen,” Steve added. “And for giving up some of your precious time to hear me out.”
in the main entrance of Columbia University, his eyes widened as he read the very first name on the sheet of paper.
“Took you two long enough,” Clint rolled his eyes. “I — more like
───────
And with those final words, Steve entered the kitchen, scooped up the rag that had been left on the island, and immediately started helping Tony finish cleaning up the rest of the kitchen.
“Tony! Can’t you wait one second so I can at least finish my breakfast, first?” Steve complained while clutching his honey-biscuit and tried to act sour so Tony could slow down from his excited pace.
The last time that Steve had eaten an exotic dessert was a couple of months ago when he had tried Chinese red bean pudding and as expected, he had loved it. It didn’t take much to win Steve over with some strange sweets or impress him with some tropical recipes due to the standards that he grew up with during his childhood. And now that the was all grown up, Steve had still managed to keep that youthful love of sugar along with him into his life as an adult.
“So, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda?” Tony smirked as he tipped his head to the side towards the book and moved aside for the other to see. “Didn’t know a guy like you would be interested in a book like this.”
“For god’s sake, Steve!
. More than half of the credit was owed to his good friend Bruce, who actually helped him to formulate and create the right chemical makeup for his fantastic art supplies. But since when has anyone appreciated a scientist for his ingenious, scientific work instead of downright ogling at the pretty natural landscape painted by an artist who used that scientist’s work?
“That’s all I needed to hear,” Rhodey smiled, “Thanks, Tony.”
for an entire week. He’s never tried it but Steve knows that he’s never going to forget last month where his stomachache lasted over a whole day just because of all the poor-quality food that he’d consumed.
“Perfect.” The unknown person finished for him. “Wasn’t it?”
“Steve, if you don’t want to kiss, that’s totally fine,” Tony told his best friend with an oddly pained-expression, without facing him, and Steve immediately felt guilty for pushing him away. “We don’t have to do anything that’ll make you uncomfortable.”
Too bad everything he has ever wanted was just within an arm’s reach away but still managed to escape his grasp every time. It drove Steve insane with heartache and agitation.
“I love you.” Steve suddenly cut in on his inner voice.
“Fine, Steve. I’ll let you see him, at most for an hour. Alright?” She finally offered. “Even I have to admit that you guys were the cutest and most perfect couple in the room, no matter how much I want to bitch-slap your face right now.”
“I think, I finally found it,” Steve breathed, watching and cherishing the way Tony’s captivating eyes coruscated as they reflected the cosmos and its stars, above. “The two of us… We’re…”
Tony almost said the phrase, “
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
“I got the lead.”
Steve slowly cracked opened his eyelids, expecting a disgusted expression to be on Tony’s face—only for the first thing that his vision was greeted by to be the brunet’s glowing, beautiful face, graced with a smile that could compete with all the stars in the universe. The sound of thundering applause and whoops that echoed throughout the theater as the audience cheered for the magical kiss that had just taken place between the story's main couple only added to the mystical and sensational feeling that swarmed the blond's gut as he grabbed Tony's hand and led him off stage.
Steve sighed in exasperation, “I say it once in fourth-grade and now you’ll never let me live it down, won’t you?”
“For the last time, it looked like hot chocolate!”
So naturally, the brunet found himself inching closer and closer to Steve each time he sat down next to the football player for lunch, despite his mind profoundly warning him to refuse the urge to. Every attempt at a release of the grip that Steve’s enchanting personality had on him only drove Tony deeper into his heart-aching longing for the blond.
Meanwhile, Rhodey invited Rogers to settle down and chat about Tony’s schedule and what times were best for him to stop by and bring Rogers some food.
‘One hour forty seven minutes, sir.’
'I'll remember you said that the next time I fancy company on my morning jog,' Steve shoots back as he leads the way back down the hall.
'No, ma'am,' he straightens up where he's sitting. 'Good morning.'
‘What? No! I just… I didn’t know… something and when I said so he got really angry with me.’
‘Tony’s arc reactor was damaged,’ Natasha explains calmly and the expression on the agent’s face makes it clear Tony didn’t say anything was wrong.
'You don't have to be,' Tony wrinkles his nose. 'Just don't tell Cap.'
'I'm sorry,' Tony tells Steve again. 'I thought I was past having...'
Steve nods helplessly and lets himself be towed to the penthouse.
Getting one of each of the Avengers action figures was necessary though, and he couldn't help the cuddly shield. The three tubs of Lego technic just make sense and so do the large number of toy cars, the road mat to go with them and the multilevel car park and garage. As for the paints and crayons, what kid doesn't like that shit? And the three remote controlled cars were just too good not to get, though, actually, if he just adjusts the gearing... But not right now. The bicycle is, admittedly, not the most practical toy at the top of a skyscraper, but the penthouse is pretty open plan and he doesn't have carpets.
'Jarvis has been in SHIELD's systems for a long time,' Tony returns his gaze more permanently to the engine. 'He told me before Thor had even taken Loki back to Asgard.
'Yes, kid?'
'I had another panic attack,' Tony admits with a quick glance towards his son.
'Please, Cap,' Tony silences all protests. 'Just look after him. Do not let him out of your sight. Don't even let the SHIELD doctors take him anywhere. You stay with him at all times. Promise me?'
‘In the bottom drawer of your desk, sir,’ Jarvis replies.
'I flirt with everyone.'
'Are you trying to use the moral lessons from films to navigate human feelings again?'
'Hey,' Steve murmurs into his ear. 'Do you want to talk about it?'
'We can seriously take this?' Clint takes another slow lap of the Audi as Steve straps Pete in.
'I do,' Steve agrees. 'I still think they're... over the top.'
'How can you be beating me at this?! Man, this just isn't right.'
He assumes there's more in Steve's life than the Avengers and working out but other than sketching he doesn't really know what he man does with his time.
‘Hey, Cap,’ Tony doesn’t look up. ‘Bit busy right now. If this is SHIELD business I’ll remind you that consulting hours are…’ he trails off as he scowls down at what he’s doing.
'Dada says you're busy lots,' Pete gazes at him trustingly.
This is more than Steve was hoping to get out of this evening.
'All day, sir? Or do you plan to dismiss Captain Rogers after breakfast so you might prepare to see him at lunch?'
'Your son,' Tony corrects and tips his head. 'Of course you can see him.'
He pushes his fingers through his hair with a sigh,
'Tony...'
She blinks in surprise,
'He's your son,' his voice is finally steady and he keeps Steve's gaze.
'No flowers, got it,' Tony nods.
Just as he's expecting things to heat up he feels Tony shake his head and push himself up a little. He turns his head to look up at him. Tony's expression is nervous determination for a split second before morphing into a cocky smile.
Pete considers it,
'I did,' Steve nods, 'he's getting ready to see Colonel Rhodes now.'
He groans and presses his face into his pillow.
Pete looks less convinced now Tony's departure is imminent.
'Thanks Thor, come on kid, eat this before you sleep?'
'This is Stark tech,' Tony just smirks, 'and Jarvis can keep them private; how do you think they work in the field?'
'Jarvis, order a new one.'
His heart is hammering.
'There you go, kiddo,' he tucks him into the bed in the master suite. 'We should probably try out your bed sometime, you know?'
'We would be a terrible match.'
He crashes his lips to Steve's and wraps his arms tight around his neck. Steve responds to the kiss beautifully but he feels his hands flail for a moment before settling on his back.
'I already told you you'd get a repeat performance,' Tony tells him as Steve stares hopelessly at the alley wall.
'You are incredibly sweet.'
'Of course he'll know you're his father. You can...' Tony just seems bewildered. 'As much as you want, Cap; Jarvis will always let you up.'
‘I am sorry, Ms. Potts,’ Jarvis interrupts. ‘Mr. Stark is currently unavailable and has demanded no interruptions. He has put his workshop in lockdown.’
'Pete, where are you?' Dada scowls.
'No, sweetheart,' Tony's voice is low and firm. 'You haven't. You haven't lost anything. What we... That wasn't... No. You're still as wholesome as ever. It wasn't sex. I'm certain there are rules about being able to at least see each other for it to count as sex.'
‘I would stay quite large. Pretty certain actually. Yep. Definitely poisoned,’ the armour lands beside him and stumbles to its knees.
'You need a drink or anything, kiddo?'
'Go away, Dummy...' he tries pressing his face further into his pillow.
greatestest?’
'This may surprise you, but I didn't actually run into many kids in need of saving in the middle of Hydra bases,' Steve hisses at him.
'Tony,' his entire face lights up as if Tony's the best thing in his world.
Fuck this man is responsive.
'Dunno,' Pete pouts.
'We should have actually told them,' Steve adds regretfully.
How could the man he knew back in the war have allowed his son to be so damaged?
It may have been a bit of a media smile as Steve's dims a little.
He watches Steve swallow heavily and look away,
~Teri
'Alright,' Tony turns back to the press, 'I have a second announcement for you today, you lucky people,' he leans down and scoops his son into his arms. 'This is Peter Jarvis Stark and he's my son.'
'You're welcome.'
'Steve?' his voice sounds broken.
'Sure,' he goes to sit with Pete and doesn't  let himself watch Steve go.
'Captain America is a very busy man,' Tony flashes up a smile for his son.
The look on Steve's face when he's trying to be diplomatic is precious; the man has no poker face at all.
'The dark grey,' he calls back, 'double breasted.'
That fuzzy Iron Man onesie from Rhodey is inspired.
His unofficial second in command is...
What should he do? Tony clearly intends for the boy to live with him and Pete, so when does Steve get to see him?
'Alright,' Steve agrees and tries to imagine Tony's face if Steve presented him with a painting.
'The numbers are very promising, Mister Stark,' one of the men says.
'Your loss,' Tony shrugs and returns to the sofa with his drink.
'Eliminating the nature verses nurture variable,' Fury mutters to himself; a statement that Steve resigns himself not to understand.
'I can't...' Steve bites his lip. 'He'd like that?'
'Meeting resistance,' Natasha tells him and he can hear gun fire down the corridor.
'Pepper, this is Peter Jarvis.'
'How long have you known?' Bruce asks quietly as Clint practically shakes with rage.
‘Of course, sir.’
'I...' Steve's holding his wrist.
'Good day, Captain Rogers,' the man greets him with an English accent.
'There isn't a puppy in here, is there?' Steve asks quietly.
'I don't cheat.'
'Not often.'
Tony stops but doesn't turn around,
He forces both arms to his sides.
'Alright,' Steve smiles and nudges Tony with his arm, 'thanks, Tony.'
'Where's mommy?' he sounds scared.
'You should have told me.'
*          *          *
It’s heartbreaking to think that Tony lived through this, and that he lived it much longer than Pete had to.
'Can't have that,' Tony grins at him, 'tell me what I can do for you.'
Steve snaps out of his distraction and reaches a hand towards Tony who takes the prompt and steps back into Steve’s arms.
She's teasing him.
'She did not,' Jarvis agrees.
'He's yours,' Rhodey grumbles as he follows him out, 'what did you expect?'
'Is that alright, Pete?' Steve smiles. 'You can come and play with me when your Dada has his meeting?'
'He would.'
'Please...' is all Steve can say as he stares into Tony's eyes.
'What?' Steve snaps, but when he meets Tony's gaze he just looks lost.
'Come on,' Tony scowls, 'I want to.'
Ok. Captain America is holding his hips and breathing over his cock while perched on the edge of the sofa in his workshop.
Tony doesn't trust him, but he hasn't restricted his access to Pete and he seems willing to let him have a role in Jim's life too.
'You're supposed to be being a second adult here,' he looks around as they step out of the shop.
'Seriously? You must have better things to do than sit in on my Board meeting,' reads the message.
'Tony!' Steve shouts again as Hulk looms over Tony, still looking furious.
'Shhh, sorry Pete, it's just me.'
'I'd love to come,' Steve interrupts. 'If there's room for me?'
‘Steve?’ he jumps.
'I think I can manage to fit you in, big boy.'
'Thor is going to teach me,' Pete beams.
Tony shrugs a shoulder,
'You'll have your own phone, baby,' he tells his son. 'And you can call me and Jarvis directly.'
'I may have dared to enter a 24 hour mall on my morning run,' Steve admits, 'and they had some clothes in his size. You don't mind, do you?'
'And of course Pete has nothing to do with it,' Steve teases her nervously.
'Pete?' Steve asks in alarm and then grins as Pete collects a couple of items from his side of the bed.
'Yes, sir.'
‘What should we do?’ Steve leans against a nearby worktable.
'Alright,' Steve tries not to sigh too audibly, 'thank you then.'
'Coffee,' Tony tells him promptly. 'And I'd like it if you kept me company?'
He glances at the blonde head on his shoulder; how the hell has he become this for Captain America?
'How do you know?' Steve checks his opponent is unconscious.
‘Speaking to someone about it might help,’ Steve tells him doggedly. 'There are professionals in medical who can...'
Steve shrugs and turns to put Bruce's breakfast in front of him,
'When did I turn it on?'
Steve tries to be optimistic whenever possible,
'On your two o'clock, sir,' Jarvis tells him.
'Tony, your conference call is at eleven,' Pepper gestures with her tablet. 'We should have the numbers in from California this afternoon and you know the Gala is a week tomorrow?'
'You knew I'd buy several thousand dollars worth of toys and have nowhere to store them?'
'Oh,' Steve repeats.
'It won't change anything,' he adds quietly after he's finished eating.
*                                  *                                  *
‘It’s fine,’ Tony dismisses from midair. ‘Head wounds always look worse than they are.’
'Not my best work,' he admits. 'Not sure there's a suave way to do this one, Jay.'
'It's Thursday; you've been down here three days,' Steve doesn't let go of him. 'Tony, what's wrong?'
'Dummy and I searched,' Jarvis clarifies. 'You and Butterfingers concentrated on maintaining house security and monitoring any use of sir's finances.'
'Speaking of...' Steve mutters and fumbles to take a photo with his phone. He then gazes at it adoringly so Tony can be pretty sure his tech is proving itself.
'Excuse me for not wanting to be stuck in a time loop,' Tony snaps.
'Ok,' Pete drops the remote for the car and follows Steve to his dining table.
'And you know what? Maybe Steve wouldn't do that. Maybe he'd stick it out for the kids and the team and he'd see I was happy and he'd just be stuck in a relationship he didn't want anymore and that isn't any better than him leaving.'
Tony bites his tongue and keeps smiling,
'You think Steve wouldn't be a good father?'
'You're my favourite,' Tony tells him and falls asleep.
'We'll keep people back,' Natasha calls after him as Steve runs to his partner.
'Tony, you aren't Howard, and Steve isn't Maria.'
'Agent Romanov's arrival on this floor is imminent.'
'He can't have gone far?' he pleads.
He sniffs and wipes and his eyes.
'Cap,' Pete beams at him.
‘You are correct, Captain. I request you do not inform SHIELD of my presence; sir feels it best if Fury underestimates my capabilities.’
'Whatever. How did he fix it in the end?'
It's five days before Tony is due to have his surgery and he's dragged the current inhabitants of the tower with him to a Stark Industries meet-and-greet.
He sits down and opens up the envelope.
‘That’s…’
'Sir, Ms Potts is showing a reporter and photographer to the study,' Jarvis tells him.
'You think so?' Steve smiles hopefully.
'Of course, sir,' Jarvis has probably already drafted a press release. 'Will the press room on the tenth floor in half an hour be adequate?'
'Dada, why has Cap not come?'
'Fair enough.'
'Alright,' Tony accepts the keys and steps around him. 'Jarvis, collapse the suit.'
'Do you need anything?'
Steve can't concentrate on what it is that Tony's doing other than that there's suction and heat and friction all in the right ways. Occasionally Tony will pull away just enough to make him whine before sucking him all the way back in.
'Here!' Pete lets go of his hand and runs off down the hall before careening through a door to the left. He jogs after him and catches the door before it swings closed, 'Alfred, this is Cap!'
‘Do I need to give you an allowance for babysitting your brother?’
His own smile dims a little.
'Goodnight, Tony,' Steve rolls his eyes.
Tony glances over his shoulder expecting the Captain to have arrived, but there's no one there.
'But it's ok, because we're Starks?'
A slightly harder bite is all it takes to throw the blonde over the edge with a wail. Tony follows him a moment later and slumps, panting, into Steve's arms.
'I'm close,' Tony grits out after a minute. 'Steve...'
'Jarvis activated the ceiling turrets,' Tony gives in. 'Kept them aimed at Steve until I told him to stand down.'
Steve blushes beautifully and licks his lips,
Steve is trying to think of an appropriate response for that when the bedroom door is jerked open.
'If you might take a suggestion, Captain, I suggest telling sir that your uniform is tight and you hope he may be able to help you with that,' Jarvis sounds far too amused about this.
‘Yes,’ Jarvis responds promptly. Steve wonders if it’s his imagination or if the AI is actually being short with him.
'An incubator,' Bruce likes to repeat things when he's tired.
There are voices coming to him as if from a distance; people are talking and someone says his name. The voices are raised, but he doesn't pay them any attention.
'There,' Tony points as his son looks on in fascination, 'the belt will slip... But if we put this on here...' Tony seems to always know where to find a tool box.
Steve lets out a breath,
Steve makes the effort to swallow down his panic.
'If he needs anything at all,' he tells Jarvis, 'tell me, ok?'
'I wasn't even sure you were awake,' Steve replies and glances away as Tony stretches his arms over his head.
Steve should never have asked.
*          *          *
'He's my what?' Steve looks so honestly, trustingly, confused.
'There are limited number of life lessons to be gained from an animated chipmunk,' Pepper is still smiling.
'So that you wouldn't climb him like a tree and blow his forties mind?'
'Cap!' Tony picks up immediately, 'how can a help you this time?'
Clint is funny.
'I seem to have lost out in this scenario,' Steve points out with a very fake pout.
'Well, ok,' Steve's flustered look is hidden when Tony just looks back down at his work. 'When do you want breakfast?'
'If I'm wrong Jarvis will cut the feed with ten seconds to go.'
'The others like you,' Tony stays paused in the corridor.
'Alright,' Steve agrees. 'Be safe.'
mention Howard in private.
'You're really romantic...' Steve can't stop himself smiling.
Clarke returns with a small box and hesitates at the register.
'I'm not telling you that you have to trust him,' Pepper tugs his hair and then soothes again, 'I'm telling you that's why he's upset.'
Steve just grins at him.
'They're for you,' Tony tells him and hands them over before taking several hurried steps backwards.
'An hour or so,' Jarvis replies quietly. 'Have a good night, sir.'
Steve likes to think he's managing this situation quite well, all things considered; he hasn't yelled at Tony, he hasn't run away screaming, he hasn't fainted or started stuttering.
‘Get Dummy to box up a reactor and get someone to put it on the jet. I’ll meet it in Hawaii or Malibu.’
'The generator sir made was for Doctor Richards and he has been known to experiment with alternate realities,' Jarvis points out calmly. 'Perhaps you have received information from these realities through extremis from the device.'
thing.”
His classmates would chide him for not accepting to go on a date with some of these “gorgeous” girls, but he couldn’t care less. Steve only had eyes for one person and after years of painfully watching from the background of Tony’s romantic affairs, the brunet was finally available after just recently breaking up with Tiberius Stone.
Holy shit.
“sugo” - a type of meat sauce
Ever since Steve could remember, he had always loved the arts and when he met a certain brunet in 6th grade in his Theatre 1 class, he had only grown to cherish and love his time in the arts even more. Originally, Steve was more of a visual arts person but when his Ma persuaded him to finally join theatre because of his love of musical theatre, he had reached a point where he had never been more grateful for is mother in his entire life.
“Knock yourself out, but be careful. And keep an eye on Sam and Bucky for us, would you? Steve and I really don’t need a repeat of last year.”
And Steve, being the most-perfect human being to ever exist on this planet, had anticipated this and planned it all out — just for Tony.
“I always feel like I’m in a fairytale when I’m around you.” Steve responded, with a tender look in his eyes.
“We’re about to run through the choreography for ‘Satisfied’ one last time before we break for lunch,” Tony informed him with a huge smile. “Care to join us?”
“You know what, that’s a perfect idea! Let’s go out to celebrate!”
Steve bit his lips, hesitantly. “Are you sure?”
sauce, some
huge-ass crush on you.”
“Tony, look up,” Steve suddenly told him after disconnecting their bodies.
! Also, I brought him some of your other foods but I don’t think Steve’s tried them yet. And I’ve known him ever since he was still in NYU getting his art degree.”
“Nothing,” Steve cursed in his head.
“Alright, fine.” The blond said with an amused expression on his face as he grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him ever closer to him, until their chests were pressed against each other. “I love you.”
“… Really?”
Gripping the book tightly, Tony willed his eyes to focus, his awareness of the blond’s presence evaporating, and finally read the very first words of line 24.
Pepper had been the one to find him outside of her complex’s front door; soaking wet, shivering in rain, and clutching what little belongings that he had managed to take with him at the last minute. His imagination could only picture the image that Pepper must have discerned before her that evening.
Tony counted 7 various knives that hung from a knife rack above the counters furthest from him and he spotted at least a dozen more shoved into a knife block that was moved aside to the end of the counter. Both sets of knives were undoubtedly covered in a thin layer of dust and Tony only confirmed his suspicions as he strolled through the kitchen, racking his fingers over the numerous kitchen appliances and scrunching his nose in the disgusting way that the whole room was being kept in. Sure, the kitchen might
before - up to the point where he could practically guess their personality type, average income, and behavioral patterns the moment that he meets them. Yet this one blond manages to skew all of Tony’s whole plate of expectations right off the countertop in his mind and defies all of the social norms that wealthy, famous, and popular millionaires have become to be known for.
What the
“Definitely.”
“That’s… amazing, Tones,” Steve said as his heart began to tug in two opposite directions, attempting to choose whether to be happy for the brunet or to be sad that there would be bad news soon to come: Tony could be leaving Steve, forever.
A groan escaped his lips before he could muffle it, and Steve slumped down into his office chair. He couldn’t remember the last time he’s eaten a proper dinner since all his suppers this past week has merely consisted of leftovers from lunch, frozen
“So, I’m assuming the reason why it has a giant chunk cut out of it is because you ate some of it for breakfast?”
Yanking down Steve to his height, he felt his breath hitch and Tony grinned as his mouth met the blond’s. The first touch between them sent shivers and sparks down his spine and Tony mentally thanked the entire universe for being reading enough books to be properly prepared for the experience.
“Please, Pepper,” Steve beseeched to her once more. “I just want to talk to him. Just let me see him and explain.”
. Just randomly drop it to me on a random day at a random time that you know a millionaire,
The brunet pushed past the remaining crowd of bodies all scrounging for a glimpse of the casting list until he could finally get a clear view. As he peaked at the paper, his curious expression froze in an unbelieving stare that Steve thought was inhumanely cute. He counted exactly fourteen total seconds for the brunet to finally come to his senses and when he finally did, Steve expected Tony to be ecstatic about the role that he got until—
Abruptly, Steve realized that he may have just discovered his favorite flavor of anything ever created: Chocolate-hazelnut.
More silence.
He felt better about his heartbroken rambling when he realized that he was talking about his pathetic, lovesick life to a stranger who he would probably never see again after tonight.
They propped themselves up against the railing, perceiving the untouched tranquility that was almost invisible against the noise and bustle of the nearby kingdom.
But Steve just couldn’t find the word to describe it all.
.” He paused. “Sometimes, I swear, there’s no other words in the whole entire,
“I know and I’m so fucking sorry — I know you don’t feel the same way about me and I just want to apolo—“
“But Tones, he paid you really well! You’ve got to realize that even if your dad is a complete jerk, at least you were somewhat surviving off of him!” Rhodey growled. “Now you’re just lazying around listening to rock music and leaving heaps of scrap paper all over your apartment floor!”
A nearby owl’s hoots echoed into the crisp, cool air.
almost dropped the food in his hands in astonishment as he gawked at the blond; he was really just expecting a man in his mid-forties or fifties, but he wasn’t too upset when he had to finally face reality.
Tony beamed smugly but was grateful for Rhodey’s statement nonetheless, “It’s
Tony took out his favorite glass pan for
“Definitely.”
… and he’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
The blond shook his head in disbelief and gaped down at the brunet with nothing but love seeping into the corners of his eyes.
“What are you waiting for?” Bucky hissed in his ear as quietly as he could manage. “Just say that you’re going to apologize or something already!”
“I don’t know maybe,” the brunet shrugged as he shifted his body closer to Steve’s until they were basically pressed up against each other.
Ignoring his thoughts and carefully setting down the frappe to the side, he shivered out a timid, “Hey Tony.”
“He’s in there. I’ll go in first to warn him beforehand, okay?”
get accepted, I’ll be off to work for him and I won’t have any money troubles whatsoever once I do!”
The archer groaned with a mouthful of un-chewed popcorn, “Ugh, great. Now I don’t feel like eating this popcorn anymore because you got that image is stuck in my head!”
Something was odd about this stranger... Something about those eyes just seemed so familiar... Steve felt like he could stare into them for all of eternity and yet, still feel deprived of their elegance. However, he knew that this wasn’t the first time that he felt this way about someone’s eyes. But he just couldn’t place his finger on when the other time was.
His parents glanced at each other before turning back to their son, both with a wide, entertained smile on each of their faces.
Steve ignored him and looked at Rhodey, “Uh, well, Rhodey… I don’t really know if I can even fit a personal chef into my schedule.”
“I just don’t. I have my reasons,” Tony said, “Don’t question me.”
“I can’t wait to do this for the rest of my life.”
Steve blushed, “That’s right. And you were babbling about me, all this time, were’t you?”
───────
Tony rolled his eyes, “I don’t know, you big sap. By saying, ‘I love you’?”
Nat didn’t take her eyes off of the TV screen and replied a swift, “The Polar Express,” before she put a bunch of her own popcorn that she was holding in her palm, into her mouth.
Tony’s neck and ears turned slightly pink.
“Of course, sir. How warm would you prefer it to be?”
Speechless, Steve felt his heart plummet down to the core of the Earth.
Steve sighed as she left and glanced up at his computer screen to scan the remaining buyers that he still had to write a letter to. There were only 5 names left on the screen but considering at the speed that it takes for him to handwrite sincere letters that he was sure wouldn’t offend his patrons, it would take him more than just a few hours to finish them all. Consequently, that probably meant he would have to miss dinner. Again.
It took at least a whole month to formulate a single, overly-elaborated, but simple plan.
“Yes,” Tony breathed and he scooted closer to Steve. “Hell yeah.”
“It’s just… It’s just the confirmation; the knowing that he’s there, alongside me, without a doubt, that he’s there no matter what I’m going to drag him through, that’s what I miss the most about him. The fact that he was loyal to an infinite degree and that he would always be there when I turned around to look behind my back, or when I looked across from our cafeteria table, or when I reached around for him at night and felt his hand grip mine… He would always be there to help me. To… to give me every last bit of his love.”
“Natasha, please!” He begged in annoyance.
“Can you be
And then, all of a sudden, Steve had just found himself experiencing the worst day of his entire life. The day that he had lost Tony.
Another groan escaped Steve’s lips as he put his head in his hands.
Steve tried not to let it disconcert him too much, but the repeated excuses and slow withdrawals that Tony had started displaying to the blond recently, dug into his heart more than he wanted to admit to himself. Each lie spoken to Steve’s face, each hasty attempt to suddenly leave when they were keeping each other company, each broken promise to come back as soon as he could — shattered the prince’s spirits and heart, slipping him into a brief period of despair and misery. Nevertheless, he quickly recovered, plastering an unauthentic smile onto his face to convince his parents and the entire castle staff that he was fine, although Steve knew that they could easily see right through his facade.
“Hey.”
“Nope,” Tony remarked, popping the ‘p’ at the end. “This is the torture that you’ll have to endure when you’re dating me.”
Pg. 171-172, Lines 1-23: “the poem” “I’m more than a little ambivalent over expressions of tender devotion” “This one day a year because greeting card companies profit off store-bought emotion.” “A romance-industrial complex so fueled by commodification of feeling” “Serves only to further homogenize all and promote what’s at best, unrevealing.” “It’s not just a lack of precision—this one-size-fits-allness—that leads me to mope.” :I think you and I share the same disillusionment, sprouted from long-buried hope.” “I worry, as you do, love dulls us to cold hollow sockets that ache for a joint.” “If ends are encoded in every beginning, we wonder, then what is the point?” “You’re right to be highly suspicious of seemingly mandated acts of affection,” “When all pretty words are a means to an ultimate heartbreak, a grand misdirection.” “I can’t guarantee that this letter won’t lead to us both one day broken and blue.” “All being said, though? You turn me to mush.”
According to Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Bucky, Sam, and basically everyone who attended MIT, it was that big of a problem.
“You mean be with you forever and ever? Definitely.”
“It means that I wasn’t a coward for wanting to go to a party. An incognito one, in fact; one where your face is covered up so no one will know who you are and thus, won’t be able to openly judge you.” Natasha fired back at the general. “Besides, have you seen all the royal guards who are actually attending and dancing without a care in the world? Why can’t you be more shameless like them, Ты идиот?”
It was a moment of absolute perfection. The taste of caffeine reentered Steve’s mouth again as he shut his eyes and clasped the back of Tony’s neck. Their bodies met in the middle and pressed against each other — like polar magnets attracting each other together, like two ends of a knot — after being forced too long apart. He felt his skin shiver from the genius’ bare touch but continued holding onto him, his hunger for his contact growing more evident than ever. A sudden shift of Tony’s figure caused Steve to pick him up and the brunet obeyed by wrapping his legs around the blond. With their posture in Steve’s favor, he diligently slammed Tony into the wall behind him without pausing to disconnect their lips. When they were both drained out of breath, the two detached and rested their foreheads against each other.
───────
─────── ♡ ───────
It must be a coincidence, Steve decided.
He preheated his oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and hurried back to his simmering sirloin. As stupid as it was to admit it, Tony had never been even remotely satisfied whenever he worked for Obie, Howard, or any of those other snobby rich restaurant owners. He’s tried working at a low-paying fast food retail job before and that definitely did not take away any of the problems that he had encountered while working at more high-end jobs. On the contrary, it probably just
Bucky then focused his gaze at Steve and stated, “You do realize that you’re a millionaire, right? You’re a real, goddamn, fucking millionaire, Steve! Your company isn’t going to become corrupted and its stock isn’t going to crash if you just take one little break for a proper dinner for once!”
I might one day transform this chapter into Steve's POV, but that probably won't happen for a while. In the mean time, here's the message that Tony sent Steve looking for:
The brunet’s smile and jaw dropped.
───────
Tony advanced forward until he was so close to Steve that he swore he could feel the heat radiating off of him.
It was so enormous of a problem that the only solution, — with the help of Tony’s friends’ pushing and encouragement — was to finally confront Steve about his feelings.
“Not exactly,” Steve replied, still reluctant about his decision in trusting his partner to take him ice-skating.
'Love the uniform, Spangles.'
'Hulk likes Stark,' Clint shrugs helplessly.
Pete looks over at the bedroom door and then back to him
'I made him cry first,' Steve shoots a look at Pete.
'I want that,' Steve soldiers on. 'What you did to that man. I want you to do that to me.'
‘No,’ Steve retorts, ‘he’s completely against the idea. Steve Rogers thinks you deserve it today though.
'Certainly, sir.'
'Pete?' Dada appears on the screen.
'I'm so sorry,' Steve keeps apologising to him as they wait out of the way for the press to disperse.
'Those are coming with us, huh?' Pete scrambles back over into his arms and manages to jab him in the neck with the sword hilt.
'Hey,' he may allow himself to press his nose against Steve's skin.
‘Thank you. Umm, Tony, I think this is just hot water.’
'He is trying.'
'He just turned up!'
'Sorry,' Steve pulls back enough to smile at him; he doesn't look very sorry.
'That was quite a crazy week.'
He can't promise Pete he'll be around all the time when he doesn't know for sure if he'll be allowed to be.
Some part of him is a good soldier after all because he falls in step with her without a word.
'I know my limits,' Tony lets his eyes close.
'Bye Tony,' Steve tries not to grin like a loon.
'Pepper!' At least someone knows how to answer the phone.
Because Tony&Hulk are adorable and I'm not sorry.
'You are,' Steve tells him readily. 'Tony, you're amazing.'
I do know that Tony is being an absolute idiot in this fic! It isn't his fault; he's a damaged soul.
'You are welcome, Captain,' Jarvis would clearly be smirking if he could.
'You know slang now too?'
'Bacon and eggs?' Clint asks as he walks them closer.
'This doesn't make any sense, Jay,' Tony shoves his chair back from his desk and spins in a circle. 'Either I'm completely misunderstanding what Reed has written or he's, what? Written it wrong in case it gets into the wrong hands? He's not that responsible.'
'That place three blocks over that does that paella,' Tony tells him.
'Sir,' Jarvis chimes in and instantly has Tony's full attention.
When Tony wakes up he makes his way automatically to the nearest coffee machine. He doesn't really notice that he's in his workshop until he's most of his way through a third mug of coffee. He looks around blearily.
'Sure,' Steve agrees. 'Where's Pete?'
'Is everything alright?' Steve's on his feet now.
'Would you... If anything happens to...'
'You aren't telling Steve about his son because you think Pete will be jealous of his brother?'
Tony just keeps walking towards him and then sheds his shirt.
'What happened?' Steve calls as Natasha and Clint jog up the path to join them.
'You're trying to kiss me,' Tony continues. 'You love it when I bite you, but you're close and you want my tongue in your mouth, don't you?'
Pepper is keeping herself distracted, or trying to, but she keep shifting her gaze towards her boss. Rhodey doesn't bother to pretend; he stands at the window and glares at the activity around his friend.
'Hey, I may not be as smart as you, but I know being paid nothing four times is still nothing,' Steve pokes him in the side.
'Why is the Gala here?' Steve stirs the eggs. 'You must have other properties?'
He parks the bike right by the main double doors and gets off to untie his bag. The doors open as he starts up the steps and a man in a suit looks down at him.
'Dada!' Pete appears from behind the counter.
'There would be far too many dicks in one bed for me,' Natasha deadpans.
'I doubt it,' Tony pets his hair.
'You just need to apologise,' Rhodey puts a hand on his shoulder. 'Explain why you didn't tell him and hope he understands.'
'No,' he blurts, 'wait. It wasn't you. I don't think you'd... I just... You sounded just like Maria. I mean my mother. Her tone whenever she... When she was about to... I'm sorry. It wasn't you. Please don't go.'
He opens the box to find a small white baby grow. On the front are written the words 'My Daddy is a Captain!' over an image of his shield.
'You don't have to,' Tony replies sleepily and snuggles a little closer.
Which doesn't stop him from curling up in Tony's bed at night, while the genius is still up and working, and feeling a little sorry for himself.
'Mute,' Tony rolls his eyes. 'Blonde, Jarvis?'
Great.
No, he tells himself firmly, if he gives up on this now all he'll have done is prove Tony right to not have believed in this. It must count for something that he, at least, trusts Tony?
Dinner is a more restrained affair than is usual when they all sit down together, but it's still clearly exciting enough to exhaust Pete.
'You have given him no other reason for your decision.'
'Certainly, sir.'
He gives up, for now, once his son is awake. Instead he takes Pete down to the workshop and shows him a car engine.
'Tony is never going to trust me with his sons ever again,' he isn't really listening. He finds a bench against the wall and sits down with his face in his hands.
Also he and Pepper both know that they're going to have an argument and they prefer to do that in private.
‘No, why?’
Jarvis turns the volume back up as Steve leaves.
'Alright you, what is this? Blackmail?'
He can't think what they are, right now, but he still drops his gaze to his son and steps away from Steve.
'Hey, come on,' Tony presses a kiss to his son's hair, 'we're Starks; we don't need anyone else.'
'You miss me, sugarpuff?' Tony relaxes against his chest and runs a hand through his hair.
He settles down on his back and gazes at Tony's son beside him,
Steve just holds him tighter,
It's longer before Steve finally succumbs.
'Yeah,' Tony puts the tablet back down. 'Terrine, risotto and the mousse. Cap, have you chosen?'
'Tell me about it,' he sighs.
Pepper appearing from her room stops him from saying anything to spoil things.
'Ok,' his son waves goodbye to You and runs to join him in the lift.
'We're getting there,' Tony pets him even as he starts thrusting in earnest against his abs.
*          *          *
Steve can't stop smiling.
'So there may be a third Stark on the way,' Bruce slumps back in his chair.
'Now, perhaps,' Thor nods, 'but as your sword arm strengthens the weight shall merely feel welcome.'
He shrugs,
'Bruce,' Steve smiles, 'I'm so glad you're here. Sit, have a coffee,' he pushes a mug into his hands, 'I'm making pancakes.'
He walks back into his living room and glares at the muffins. And spots the envelope.
'I got back to the tower, asked who was in and was told you weren't. You don't go running at half four in the morning unless you're upset,' she bumps their shoulders together. 'When you still weren't back by quarter to seven I got Jarvis to track you and got a cab.'
'Bruce is coming?' he's surprised.
‘Yes,’ Steve smiles in amusement, ‘but as he’s not real then it basically counts as talking to yourself.’
'No, thank you,' she's watching him. 'Steve, I just want to thank you for looking out for Tony. He doesn't have many friends he can rely on for this sort of thing.'
‘Right…’ Tony gets up; presumably content in the belief he’s diverted Steve from the point.
'Do you want a list of Captain Rogers' preferences, sir?'
'She probably paid them off,' Tony turns to look at him now, but his eyes are shuttered.
'Jarvis,' Steve calls out as he gathers up some paper to start drafting his report of the mission, 'can you order me a camera? There should be photos of this time and I'm not sure Tony will remember to take any.'
'A nerf gun,' Tony agrees. 'There's a bow and arrow version around here somewhere too,' he grabs it from Steve and shoots his son who shrieks with laughter and runs around dodging.
'I know what I'm doing,' is the eventual reply. 'I designed it, I know how to disarm it.'
Ok. Steve's definitely going to worry, but he can't say anything.
'Just do what you do best, Tony.'
‘Oh, no, thanks Jarvis, that’s fine.’
'I stuck it to the fridge, it seemed appropriately cliché.'
He moves his own hand away to get a good grip on the back of Steve's head so that when he nips experimentally on the soldier's lip he stays with him when he flinches away,
'I have found research suggesting forty five minutes should be adequate,' Jarvis tells him.
Tony huffs,
Tony sits at the little table in Steve's kitchen and watches him vaguely as he moves around getting things from cupboards. It occurs to him that in the last three days it never occured to him to ask Steve what he'd been doing while Tony was upstairs in his workshop.
'When?' Tony asks, because of course he's curious.
Will he look like Tony or him? Brown eyes or blue? Blond or brunette? What if he doesn't have the serum? Could he be sickly, like Steve was?
'I'm just thinking about what happens when the second baby is born,' Tony admits. 'If he actually looks like Steve I guess I just hope no one jumps to the right conclusion.'
'The cupboard above and the left of you for plates, Captain,' Jarvis interrupts.
'Yeah,' Steve's fond look for Pete seems to be transferring to him too.
'Not as much as I like him,' Steve sighs.
'Your son?' Clint stares. 'Ok, a bit embarrassed I didn't see it before; he looks just like you.'
‘Do you know where he is? He should be taking it easy after that hit he took.’
Steve grins to himself.
'Galas for the charities supported by the Maria Stark Foundation are always held at the Stark Mansion,' he shrugs.
Tony has glanced at the reactions of the rest of his team and then fixed his gaze on Fury,
'We're good here,' he tells the archer. 'Tony's keeping him calm so we should have Bruce back shortly.'
'Yes, shhh!' Steve hushes him quickly, 'your Dada needs some more sleep.'
‘Start the movie, Jarvis,’ he instructs when Clint has made his choice.
The AI stays silent but Steve barely notices,
'Is it important?'
'I'm fine,' Tony retorts, 'you have a free pass.'
Natasha and Bruce make similar, but less enthusiastic, motions towards greeting their fellow Avenger. Quickly the exchanges establish that there's nothing wrong and Thor is just visiting.
Rhodey's gaze sharpens,
'You're generous and selfless,' he looks like complimenting Tony may be causing him pain. 'Show him that you want him involved in your sons' lives.'
She turns up at the tower while they all happen to be lounging in the kitchen and takes the glass of juice out of Tony’s hand and holds out some paperwork.
'I shall inform you of any developments to James Stark's situation, Captain,' he assures.
'I like you.'
'It is two am, Captain Rogers,' Jarvis answers as Tony refocusses his brain on the outside world.
'Captain?' Fury's voice cuts through his thoughts. 'Would it be alright with you if we debrief now?'
'Jarvis is faking a history for Pete and Jim,' Tony tries to explain. 'Camera phone photos taken over a distance are easy to fake and he'll make it look like they were dated a while ago. If I leak the information in the right way they'll believe it's true. If I then publicly request that people stop calling up the lady that is my surrogate then they'll all be so busy trying to find her that they'll leave us alone.'
I say 'may' because I haven't written it completely yet but I have a good idea how this -verse can fit the movie.
Pete's still sleeping so he puts him down on the sofa as he gets back to work. Jarvis settles the armour in sentry mode and stands beside his brother.
He likes his cars.
'I know,' he cuts him off. 'I know I can trust him; he's... Steve...'
'Tell me you have coffee,' Tony points a finger at him.
And who could have taught him that other than Steve?
‘Fuck,’ Tony agrees and jets off back into the air and away from the battle.
'Master Stark,' the man, Steve is assuming he's a butler, calls up, 'your guest has arrived.'
‘Come on, let’s get you seen by medical,’ Steve moves to usher him towards their approaching transport.
Did they go without him?
'Right. What food do we have up here?'
'Ok,' she raises her hand to her face in an aborted motion to bite her nails. 'Work on this today but if you loop again take the day off, do you understand?'
'Series E defence bonds: each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.'
He also tells Steve he’s going to send Fury the bill for Tony’s time, but he’s grinning so Steve figures even if he actually does send Fury a bill at least Steve was the one to put that smile on his face.
Steve had always felt that their relationship — although it hadn’t started off as perfect as the storybooks and fairytales said it would have — evolved into something that seemed even too far-fetched to be in a romance novel. Everything, from his college-life to his relationship, felt like he had just suddenly received it or stolen it from the destiny of some make-believe princess’. Things weren’t supposed to turn out this
Now, Tony was starting to get really anxious. He peeked over the top of his mini snow-fort and when he saw no sign of Steve, his mind immediately started fabricating a million different scenarios to explain why Steve had suddenly gone quiet.
While the blond was inspecting the foreign delicacy, Rhodey said, “If you don’t like it, I’ve still got plenty of other stuff in my car. In fact, I’ll go get them now. Hopefully, they haven’t been ruined by now; the sun’s not out so I’m not that worried. Anyways, let me know what you think of it when I get back.”
“Please, Ma,” Steve groaned. “I know it’s wrong to force my emotions onto him, so I won’t, and you shouldn’t either. Please promise me, that you’ll let him choose for himself whether he wants to stay with me — just as a friend, or not.”
But Steve couldn’t help the loving smile from blossoming across his face.
“Because…Because it would show him that I cared. That I truly wanted him back. When we were still together, he…he had never liked it when I courteously asked for something and always insisted on giving me whatever I wanted straightaway without having to plead to him. And this time, I’m going to listen to him. I’m not going to beg him to come back to me. I’m going to let him choose whether he wants to listen to me or not because I never gave him a choice when I left him on that day.” Steve shuddered at the honesty dripping from his carefully chosen words.
“I meant for you to hear that,” He grinned, mischievously. “Anyways, I guess we both should get going now. Ugh, my parents will be furious when they find out that I had sneaked out of the castle before my ‘evening-attire-fitting’ just to come and visit you.”
For Steve, who had known Tony ever since they were infants — it was blatantly apparent that Tony was lying. However, any other person would immediately believe him and not catch a thing about the change in his tone or the way he started clenching his left fist in his right hand. Tony was a fairly good liar, but Steve had been observing his nervous ticks for longer than he could remember.
“I know, Ma.” Steve responded, his voice laced with self-pity. “But no one else is
“What the absolute-fuck?!” Tony exclaimed as his face flushed an angry shade of pink. “Why the hell was Tiberius Stone casted as Maria Reynolds?! That fucking guy has the attitude and personality of a female dog: A complete bitch!”
speaking a foreign language then I’d like to ask how you managed to graduate high school.”
And if he had to stay in New York City for the rest of his life and never get the chance to travel anywhere else in the world, as long as he could still stay in contact with Tony, he would be perfectly content. Steve wasn’t willing to lose the one good thing in his life so soon even though their graduation day just kept getting closer and closer.
, - he’s an absolute evil piece of
are you doing here?”
Suddenly, the grand clocktower that resided in the tallest tower of the Americandian castle, rung deafeningly, signaling midnight had occurred and the start of a new day had begun.
“That was delicious,” Rogers told the brunet with a smile. “I don’t think I’ve ever had such good food in my life.”
“Just follow me.”
For fuck’s sake.
Steve flushed with anguished embarrassment.
“Well? Did you get in?” Tony asked. “And also, just as importantly, did I get in?”
Tony muffled a short “Coming,” against Steve’s lips but it wasn’t until the movie was already five minutes in that they rejoined the rest of their team on the couch.
“This guy that I’m honestly,
Out of the corner of his field of view, Steve noticed Clint shake his head in disappointment.
“Wait, really?” Tony seemed unconvinced. “Does that mean that we get to work together?”
Steve’s vision began to blur from tears.
“Yeah, right,” Bucky snorted, “Like I’m ever going to accept that you are blatantly putting your health in danger and that you’re overworking yourself for the most pointless reasons ever.”
“Yep, anything for you, Honeybear.”
“Yeah, yeah…” Steve grinned like a fool. “Definitely. I would love to keep working with you, Anthony Edward Stark.”
“And you know what?” Tony murmured, his lips inches from Steve’s. “That’s honestly
It didn’t help that not long after he had joined Steve’s
Steve’s encouraging smile gradually vanished as he resorted to listening to the beguiling person next to him blither on.
“Warm enough not to melt our skin off, please.”
Tony sighed and persisted on, “Don’t be. I just want you to be comfortable with what you’re doing.”
“Definitely.” Tony agreed while wrapping his arms around Steve’s torso and burying his face in his chest. Steve reciprocated by completing their embrace and locking his hands together behind Tony’s back; his nose buried in Tony’s floral-smelling hair. The touch of the genius’ head digging into the area right above his heart, sent shockwaves of emotion and desire through his body.
He felt exultant.
True to his word, — as Bucky told him to: “stop moping around,” — Steve turned to the nearest lady, flashed her a heart-melting but professional smile, and began to waltz with her. Throughout the next few songs, he drifted through the flock of masked-attendees while constantly switching partners, and tried to disregard the many high-heeled shoes that accidentally stepped on top of his leather boots.
Every one of his friends; including Sam, Nat, Bucky, Bruce, Thor, and Clint gaped at him wildly and unbelievingly, with mainly confused looks. Natasha studied his form up and down like Steve had just said the worst thing he could feasibly produce out his mouth.
He just hoped his plan would work and Steve would get what he’s been wanting to tell him for months.
This man was gorgeous - but that didn’t mean that Tony should immediately start trusting him and acting as his personal slave just because he was a pretty blond. His face instantly twisted in a scowl at the thought but he held it back as Steve Rogers finally reached him and stopped in front of Tony, politely holding out his right hand.
“Okay, so what if I did? You still forced me in the first place!”
Natasha grimaced as her gaze traveled to Pepper’s still preoccupied form.
And suddenly, all of Tony’s previous exhilaration vanished as he cocked his head up to peer up at Steve. The blond’s heart began to beat rapidly as he realized that Tony had just pushed away and forgotten the crazily, marvelous luck that had just happened to him to ask Steve if he had gotten in or not. The fact that Tony even cared made his senses perk up as a billion longing thoughts raced through his head.
This time, no quick-witted, smug remark that came in response.
Shoulders slumped, Steve struggled to brush aside his disheartened thoughts and turned to the person standing by his side.
The genius’s mouth curled upwards into an ambitious smile that appeared when he suddenly decides to challenge the extent of the world’s technology that Steve recognized and knew all-too-well.
“You did it,” observed Bruce. “You convinced her into giving you a new hope.”
meant to him right now.
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
“No! Uh, it’s just really hot in this library, that’s all,”
Because this view was otherworldly. Just like the one person who brought him here.
“So, me and Steve have been talking and we think that we have the best possible schedule figured out for you. You’re going to have to wake up fairly early to be able to make breakfast for Steve but he says that he’s okay with you cooking it the night before and just bringing in to him in the morning, too. You can bring his breakfast to his penthouse if he’s not yet working in his office and during lunchtime, you’ll have to deliver his food to him wherever in the tower he might be. Dinner is similar to breakfast in terms of delivery; just find out if Steve has gone home or not and give his food to him there. Of course, you’re welcome to use his kitchen if you need it to and he’s given you the okay to let you stay in one of the extra rooms of his penthouse if you’d like. Also, he says that you can just chill in the penthouse whenever you have free time or are just not busy; the fridge is also open for you to help yourself to. Does this all sound good to you?”
No words in the entire fucking universe, could ever express how much Tony absolutely loved Steve, right now. No cosmic, extraterrestrial force could ever make the brunet love him anymore than he already did, right at this moment. It was literally impossible for there to be anything that ever existed in this world that could even come close to conveying how much Steve meant to Tony right now — how much just the blond’s simple
Their lips latched together again before either one of them could comprehend what they were doing.
More smashes and sounds of breaking ornaments and glass echoed through the halls of the tower before the racket finally settled down to some disturbing sounds of heavy breathing.
Steve rambled, his throat becoming hoarse from the pangs emerging from his lungs. “I can’t get him out of my thoughts, he’s eternally there and it’s killing me not knowing how he’s doing. And I’ve been enlightened that I’m a goddamn asshole for what I’ve done, and I’ve accepted the probability that Tony could quite loathe me right now, but it doesn’t change how much I want him back. And not for the reasons that you think.”
, in my heart. You have been in my heart ever since I met you and I certainly never let you leave it when I left you that day. You were always there for me, and no matter how badly I wanted to be there for you, no matter how badly I wanted to be by your side through everything life was intending to throw at us — I had left, but only physically. And that’s where I fucked up. I left you behind physically but I would never let you leave my heart. And I never did because I’m here now, to ask you to come back into my heart and my life, but physically because you had never truly left either of them in the first place.”
His fear of rejection hadn’t caused Steve to be afraid of talking to Tony until he started noticing the brunet growing more and more distant with each passing day. Dreading the thought that Tony could be avoiding Steve because he found no interest in being his friend anymore, he began to distance himself from the other in return, hoping that if Tony really wanted to continue to stay by the blond’s side, he would come to Steve first.
But Rhodey and Bucky were already too far gone into the idea. Possibly the thought of their friend actually getting to eat an adequate meal every night was more than enough to convince them to make the decision for Steve.
One day after his frantic worrying; once Natasha finished telling him to stop panicking, Tony made sure to check that Steve had received a notecard from Bruce, during the blond’s biochemical engineering class, telling him to go to the library and find the book with the class number: PS3602.O255, from the MIT library catalog.
“I’m not sure; I’m actually looking for him right now, and I’d very much like for that to be kept quiet and to not be declared to the entire party —from the top of the orchestra’s stage — by a soon-to-be-drunk moron, if you wouldn’t mind?”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
“What are we watching again?” He asked her, hoping the redhead could hear him over the noise of Tony and Clint still fighting over the popcorn.
This was a bad idea, right? Or was it a good one?
Tony nodded in thanks and when Rhodey motioned for him to sit down, he took a seat on the right side of his best friend, letting Rogers sit alone on the sofa on Rhodey’s left.
Either way, after having to restrain himself from pressing his tongue to the bottom of the glass container just to get another taste, Steve ultimately decided that
The genius stopped himself from almost scowling right in front of this extremely-attractive young man named Steve and bit his bottom lip, unconsciously.
The brunet patiently obliged Steve’s instructions and headed towards the front of the library, even though he was itching to open the book already. And there was Steve — standing there in all of his 6’2” glory.
Everything was absolutely perfect: the comfortable presence of his boyfriend, the sweet taste of love, kisses, and cotton candy still lingering upon his mouth, the gentle caresses that Steve and Tony would give each other every few seconds — it was all undoubtedly and certainly, heavenly — but the blond still felt that even
He paused to peer out the window, displaying a tender look as his hair was basked in a golden glow.
“You’re an idiot.”
───────
Blushing from the compliment, Steve replied, “Just picked it up throughout the years, I guess. Although, I was mostly taught the basics by my parents.”
Deciding not to kill the friendly mood, Tony wiped his face of any negative emotions and plastered on a curious smile as a replacement, “I’m Tony, by the way. Tony Stark.”
“What is it?” He questioned.
“Sure, Tony. Whatever you say.”
“I feel like I’m living in a fucking fairytale.” Tony sighed happily after catching his breath.
“Ever since you decided to wear that,” came the starry-eyed reply. “Actually, no. Ever since I met
“Nah, I’m good, you can have it. After all, I’ve read it like a million times, already. One of my favorites, remember?”
“Wait, you were talking about me all this time?” Steve’s eyes widened in shock.
The genius smirked mischievously as he seized the humongous popcorn bowl that the whole team shared, “Good. That means more for the rest of us you popcorn-hog,”
Tiberius Stone. Hell’s finest, and worst, spawn. The perfect person to interrupt his chance to be alone with Tony.
There were about three thousand things that could go wrong during the actual performances and was there even a possibility that Tony actually liked him back?
you have an IQ of 234.”
The redhead continued, “He’s hurt, too. You can see it in his eyes. They flash something unfixable every time he talks about you. I highly doubt anything you try will repair that gaping hole that you had left in his heart a year ago.”
“Happy Four-Year Anniversary, Anthony Edward Stark,” Steve reciprocated the kiss. “Even though I technically said it first.”
“Fine. But just for you and only for this winter.”
. Not only was he persistently just there, unfailingly by my side, but he took care of me like I was the last person on the entire fucking Earth. He…He would watch over me when I was sick, when I had nightmares and memories of my...my mother, when I missed her so much that it was physically impossible for me to do anything else other than cry. He never failed me, and I’m not going to fail him now either, especially when I’m this close to at least possessing a small chance.”
Judging from the number of invitations that were going out to all the people of the allied kingdoms within S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve’s downfall would probably show up tomorrow evening at the party and snatch Tony out of his life before the blond could even find the other prince within the onslaught of guests coming into the ballroom.
───────
Steve hesitated before finally giving in.
His head pounded as his memories raced him back a year to the day that Steve had left early from Tony’s mansion, believing that his boyfriend was ditching him to hang out with one of his stupid ex’s when really, it was actually one of Stark Industries’ most important, private business meetings scheduled that year; one that he was being forced to attend by his father. And when Tony skipped out on the meeting to chase after Steve in a frantic, desperate attempt to apologize, Howard had caught him and decided that on that day he had enough of his son’s behavior.
“Well, you know how Tony got offered a real acting job at Broadway last night? But here’s the catch: You were too!”
Steve’s eyes dimmed in thought as he flicked his gaze up at Pepper, before immediately shifting it down again to study his clenched and sweaty hands.
. As Tony stood there just watching the two eat away the leftover scraps of fresh rucola and cherry tomatoes, his head began to automatically clear itself of all the worries of the
Tony suspects laughter.
'Good night, Jay.'
'Granted,' he allows. 'What would Pepper tell me to do?'
'I hope he need never find out,' Jarvis points out.
*          *          *
'Jarvis, where's Tony?' he asks as he wraps a towel around his hips and starts rubbing his hair dry.
Tony scowls at one of his messages from R&D. Didn't he respond to this a few days ago? Maybe it's from someone else in the same department and somehow the message hasn't reached them?
‘I’m really not…’ Steve keeps glancing at the ceiling.
'I am honoured, sir.'
'Ok. Tomorrow?' he looks so earnestly hopeful.
'Would ham sandwiches do for you, Captain?'
'Yeah yeah,' Tony gets to his feet and stretches. 'I'm going...'
'If you know that,' he realises he's sitting very rigidly but can't make himself relax, 'then you know it doesn't really matter what I want.'
'Dada is feeding his brain,' Pete declares.
'Why would anyone want that?' Steve asks in confusion.
'Yeah?' Steve grins. 'Ok.'
It’s a week later when Steve walks into the kitchen to find Tony sitting on the island fixing the microwave and muttering about ‘god-damned demigods’. He can’t help but stride across the room and scoop Tony into a hug; Tony yelps in surprise but relaxes again then laughs,
'I don't...' Steve stutters to a halt and emits an embarrassing whine when Tony bites his neck. 'Please...'
Pete nods against Steve's neck.
Tony grins,
'Yes,' he agrees as he makes sure all the cars are up the right way.
'I was attempting to hint towards what you have just discovered,' Jarvis agrees. 'Sir had one parent who neglected him, one who actively abused him and a parent-like mentor who tried to kill him; he is unlikely to trust his son with many people.'
He bites his lip as he glances at Pete.
'Well, I didn't know that, did I?' Tony retorts as he turns around.
‘In StarkTower,’ Steve agrees.
Tony stares at him.
'Yes, Jarvis?'
'Oh, that's quite a nice upgrade I'm getting.'
'I'm his favourite billionaire and he's my favourite super soldier,' he grins. 'Does that make it fair?'
Steve has noticed that Tony and Pepper never seem to need to wait for the lift; he suspects Jarvis.
'I didn't think he'd willingly leave your side,' he smiles as Tony's focus visibly flicks to his little display every few seconds.
'Stark has it,' Fury repeats. 'And when do you suppose he'll hand it over?' he looks straight at Steve.
'Any chance Rhodey would let me off telling Steve about Jim on the basis I just raked open my childhood?'
'Turn it off,' Steve instructs with a scowl.
'You are coming with me,' he confirms. 'We're going to the Mansion. Oh, Cap, get his bike?'
'Sorry?' Tony splutters. 'You came in your pants, untouched, from giving me head; Rogers, that's unreasonably hot.' He pulls Steve back into a kiss, 'very, very hot, Steve.'
Alfred mutters something about learning to answer your own damn door and leaves the way they came.
He gets a better grip on Steve, who's still riding out his own release, and boosts himself to get his legs around the soldier's waist. He hears himself, as if from a distance, making a desperate whining sound. Steve has him presses against the wall now lets out a groan and bites against Tony's shoulder.
Tony just shrugs,
He's dancing to his music as he works when he's alerted to Steve's return by a drop in the volume.
'That's all, Mr Stark,' she smiles. 'I'll let you know when the more serious side of the press decide to comment on the actual point of the press conference.'
‘He’s in lockdown? Jarvis, please, open the door?
Pete wakes with a start as Tony brushes his hand through the boy's hair,
‘But if you are a Dada-y will you not visit anymore?’
'I'm sorry,' Tony tells him. 'I just didn't want you to be tied down.'
'Are you always this horny or is it just today?' Tony asks.
Steve shoots a vague glare at the ceiling,
‘Let’s do this then.’
'Was Pepper very angry?' he looks apologetic again.
He opens his mouth and tries to think of something, anything, that will stop Tony looking at him as if he's insane.
Pete thinks about that,
Natasha just blinks slowly but Clint grins,
'Do you have any idea how many people would like to get their hands on my son?!' Tony's voice rises. 'Do you have any idea what they could have done with him?'
'Not quite,' Steve presses a kiss to his wrist, 'I still want you to... be inside me though.'
But maybe he should have.
'I love Indian,' Clint declares and homes in on the hottest of the available dishes.
'On your left, Iron Man,' Steve calls as he drops and rolls under some fallen masonry.
'Kay!' Pete beams and leaps from the bed and runs from the room with his blanket flapping behind him.
Tony slumps a little and tucks his head under Steve's chin,
He can't help but think that he'd be taking this better if there had apparently been ANYBODY on his side.
'Well,' Tony can feel Steve straightening his shoulders as his chest moves against Tony's cheek, 'then either you are a little more crazy than we already knew, or you are reliving the day.'
‘Why?’ Steve demands.
Tony is...
'I... Pete's here. Is Tony still working?'
'Yeah,' it would still be better to have Dada now...
Fury is telling them about the various events across the globe that SHEILD are aware of, but that don't require the attention of the Avengers themselves. Steve takes it upon himself to offer the team out as individual assistants; he hates the idea of anyone coming to harm because someone thought that the threat didn't warrant the attention of the legitimate superhumans.
‘Another?’ Tony asks as he downs his scotch and stand again.
'Hmm,' Fury watches him intently.
'Is anyone else awake, Jarvis?' Steve asks quietly.
'My Iron Man suit isn't a weapon,' Tony replies promptly.
'Hey, darling,' Tony moves to straddle the other man's lap.
Steve rolls his eyes.
‘What’s wrong, Steve?’
'What have I walked into?' Colonel Rhodes steps off of the lift.
'Pete,' Tony starts gesturing to his team mates, 'you remember Bruce? And that's Clint and Natasha. Where's Cap?'
'Nope,' Tony walks ahead to his workstation and Pete runs off to the bots.
Tony glances down to where he's just wearing sleep pants and shrugs,
'A credit card?' he sighs and rubs his eyes.
That Steve’s stomach does flips at the sight of that smile is just something he’s going to have to learn to live with.
Obviously Steve wants to be a father to Jim, which doesn't seem like it's completely off the cards.
‘Fuck this is weird,’ Tony shakes his head and moves straight to the bar. ‘Drink?’
'Right,' Bruce looks amused. 'Well, while experimenting with a subdermal chip we had a bit of a malfunction. It may have exploded, under my skin, when it came into contact with my blood.'
'Ah, Jarvis,' Clint seems to be caressing the steering wheel, 'first Skynet, now KITT?'
It isn't her fault she knew before him.
Steve watches him silently for a moment,
*                                  *                                  *
Steve obeys without question and is relieved when Tony follows suit, if a little slower, with his dress shirt.
Steve's breath evens out and he blinks himself out of his daze to look to where Tony has pillowed his head on his shoulder,
‘What?!’ Steve jolts and the Quinjet sways in the air. ‘When were you going to tell me?!’
Steve just stares at him.
Natasha scowls and fixes her gaze on Fury while Clint just goes still and stares at nothing in particular. Bruce and Thor look confused.
'Of course, Captain.'
Pete beams,
'I don't know. How much money did your Dada give you?'
He finally makes his way back up the drive in the dark. There are a few rooms lit up downstairs but the rest of the house is dark. Lights turn on on the steps up to the front door as he approaches and he can hear Tony's music from somewhere deeper into the Mansion.
'Project removing the arc reactor from my chest,' Tony tells him and then huffs a breath at the same time Steve heards a muffled thud; he guesses Tony's dropped onto his bed.
'You haven't told them?!' Tony sounds baffled more than anything else.
When Tony’s back onboard Steve sets their course for New York and pushes up their speed.
'You did what to...? Never mind,' he shakes his head. 'Give me your phone.'
'Making sandwiches,' Pete gazes up at the ceiling. 'Have you finished letting Jarvis move in?'
Bruce is shaking his head,
'Why?' Tony rolls his eyes and pours a scotch. 'Really, Pep, what will he gain by knowing?'
Tony laughs quietly,
'Some water would be great, thanks,' Steve steps around him and into the conference room. Natasha and Clint follow him and then close the door.
'Yeah?' Steve laughs dubiously. 'I'm not sure I was very helpful. You talked him down.'
There's several long seconds of silence and then all eyes are on Steve.
And just like that Tony turns away.
'You fixed it?' Pete asks, wide eyed.
Tony realises he's actually thinking of the man as 'Cap' due to his focus.
'Cap?' he blinks in confusion as Steve crosses the room and perches on the edge of the bed.
The penthouse is still quiet when he arrives; Pepper must be elsewhere again. He starts the coffee machine and leans against the kitchen units as it brews.
'I want to stay with you!' Pete declares and tightens his grip.
'I'm such a mess...' he rakes his finger through his hair and that's apparently Steve's breaking point.
'Hah,' Tony smirks.
'I'm not happy with this,' Pepper tells him.
'I'm glad you came,' he tries the 'talking about it' thing. 'Pete missed you yesterday.'
'Captain?'
'Well, that must be a relief! You've had to have your tower repaired enough already!' she laughs.
'Yes, Jarvis?'
'You know that poison-that-wasn't-a-poison I got hit with a while back? Well, I was studying it and I had this idea for being able to...'
'I quite liked that one too,' he can hear Tony's grin.
His AI has issues.
'You want me to sleep with him?' Tony times it so his friend has just taken a sip of water.
'Yeah, I'll need to crash after. I've been awake for too long,' Tony suddenly sounds tired.
When he gets home, several hours later, the Tower is silent.
'Pizza,' Tony settles beside him. 'It should be here soon.'
Steve stands quietly confused as Tony finishes the conversation with his PA (which doesn’t do justice to what Pepper does but is still the perfect description for what she does) and his best friend (best
“Yeah, yeah.”
Turning to Steve, the brunet frowned, “Hey, you okay? Those kids look like they could really hurt someone if they tried crashing into them hard enough.”
Pepper looked away from the blond for a minute before fixing her posture to observe him once more.
“But the fact, that he keeps disappearing without a moment’s notice; that he keeps leaving me without giving me a reason as to why; all of these things that he’s been recently doing and every single time that I catch him avoiding me — it just deteriorates my confidence and my chances with him, further.”
“This is unbelievable, Tony.” Steve exhaled in awe. “It’s stunning. I can’t believe you did all this.”
“Bucky! I’ll be fine! Can’t you or Bruce just bring me some food back?” Steve asked while trying to concentrate on neatly writing the remaining letters.
The genius swore he had undeniably seen Steve’s neck and ears turn a little pink but shook it off once the tint of red had disappeared as fast as it had occurred.

Then the layering began; the fresh pasta was laid on top of the tomatoes, a thin layer of
His body stiffened as Rogers turned to flash Tony a dazzling smile and suddenly the blond’s attention was enraptured by the items he was holding in his hands.

Judging by the looks of their unbreakable bond that just kept getting stronger with each passing day, it didn’t look like Tony would be spared of any of his feelings anytime soon.
