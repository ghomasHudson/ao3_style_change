Dean’s just staring at him, face unreadable, completely silent.
He was still very much a soldier back then, so he had thought of himself and his need to repent before thinking about Dean, about how that would have affected him. Even though Dean had, somehow, been able to rationalize Castiel’s staying away while in Purgatory to protect him – although Dean could have left but he hadn’t until he found Castiel, and even went as far as telling him he

. He’s probably just learned the meaning of ‘You reap what you sow’.
Keeping his left hand on Dean’s face, cradling like it’s something to be handled with the utmost care, Cas uses his right hand to pull his cock out of Dean’s mouth and let the head brush his lips. He can’t seem to be able to look away from the sinful view.
“I’m yours, Cas.”
He needs to know if Cas is available, first of all. He knows he’s not married, that would be public knowledge, but he doesn’t know whether he’s in a committed relationship. And, if he isn’t, Dean needs to know if what Cas really wanted then, or now, is Dean’s looks, or if he might be interested in something more. Better still, if he might be interested in something more with
had made him feel when Dean gave him his trench coat back. A trench coat Dean had kept for months, in spite of his hurt and disappointment. In spite of him thinking he’d never see the angel again.
Castiel stays right where he is, on the couch, sipping his fine whiskey and watching his stunning boy cleaning around their house in just a thong, a scarf and a pair of high-heeled shoes. And a butt plug that Castiel hasn’t seen yet but
can’t help using this time traveling trope Dean finds confusing as fuck, he feels on cloud nine.
at taking compliments. So much for wanting to impress Dean with his remarkable  skills. He’s sure he looks like a shy school boy more than an accomplished man right now.
He did! He totally did. Cas gave him a place and time and then hung up on him. Taking it for granted Dean will show up.
as it could possibly be. And that cannot but be absolutely perfect.
And they’re staring at each other and smiling again.
“You still want to? Be mine?”
What Castiel puts on the table, however, is not money. It’s his business card. “This number here is the direct line to my office. You can call anytime between 8am and 4pm Monday to Friday. Call this number when you’ve settled in New York and we’ll see if we can arrange a meeting. Goodbye Dean.”
He has to clear his throat before he replies to the man’s unspoken question. “The reviews? They talk about the place and you, and they’re right. Absolutely beautiful.”
,” Dean all but begs in response to Cas’s question.
There it is. Novak’s bashful smile and dropping gaze after Dean’s smiled and winked at him. Dean would be telling a big, fat lie if he said that kind of attitude on Novak’s part doesn’t make him fantasize about the man looking at Dean like that when Dean’s about to fuck him so hard he won’t be able to sit straight at work the following day.
Dean huffed a watery – disbelieving, a
The deer-caught-in-headlights look on Samandriel’s face when he sees them walking through the door, however, is totally, completely, absolutely, royally worth it.
Dean’s loved every second of it, even though dealing with his cold sucked and he’s a giant baby when he’s sick. But he’s felt so taken care of, so cherished, so safe, he wouldn’t have changed a single thing. Not even the freaking cold.
“Nothing. It’s just-. Just work. It’s boring. And infuriating. I don’t want to drag you into this. It’s fine. I’ll find a way to fix this,” Cas concluded on a sigh.
Dan pushes Novak against the wall and plasters himself against him head to toe, pressing a leg between his knees. Novak starts grinding against that leg like a fucking rutting dog while Dean ravages his mouth, and Dean’s brain melts a little seeing the super professional Castiel Novak coming undone for him like that. Their crotches press against each other every now and then and Dean’s in love with the muffled moans trapped inside their connected mouths when that happens. Dean’s hands can’t keep still, they’ve found their way inside the trench coat as soon as Novak’s back connected with the wall but damn buttoned suit jacket, and there’s also a shirt, too many clothes, how many does this guy wear, until finally it’s just soft, smooth, warm, so very warm skin.
thing to do, because if people are educated from a young age, the chances they’ll become responsible and respectful adults increase exponentially.
And he does. He so does. Dean’s not the only one who can’t control his mouth. Cas is being just as vocal as Dean, groaning and panting in pleasure and telling Dean how good he feels, how much he loves fucking his little hole, how hot and tight and perfect he is.
Still smiling, Castiel replies “I think that’s precisely why I have chosen to keep this part of the job for myself. I hate waking up
“Bal,
Unpacking tomorrow, bed now. It’s too much to hope the mattress is memory foam, right?
And that was that. No one else ever said another word about it, even though Dean felt Naomi’s and Gabriel’s eyes scrutinizing his every move for a couple of years after that. Clearly, Cas was not the only one in the family whose eyes on you were impossible to ignore.
Once he’s sure Dean’s cock is coated in lube root to tip, Cas straddles his lap again, circles his boyfriend’s erection with one of his hands and lines it against his hole to start sinking down.
cheat on me.” No, he would never. Dean already knew that, in spite of what his own insecurities have led him to think for a minute there, but Cas’s shocked expression earlier only confirmed it.
“We can still do that, you know?”
When Dean picks up the pace and his rhythm starts to falter, when he starts being more vocal and tell Cas how good it feels to be inside of his tight ass, Cas knows he’s about to get filled up. He can’t help bringing a hand to his cock and stroking himself slowly. He won’t come, he knows he won’t, but that doesn’t mean that he can’t be greedy and take as much pleasure out of this as possible.
That was the first time Cas said it without prompting. Dean couldn’t have controlled himself even if he had wanted. And the
As soon as his back connected with Dean’s chest, Cas put his right hand on Dean’s thigh and buried his left one in Dean’s hair, letting his head loll back a little, and putting his right ear just at the right angle for Dean to dirty whisper to him as he started fucking him slow and deep.
- shot espresso for Dean tonight.
“You look absolutely stunning, boy,” Castiel says once he’s regained enough brain power to verbalize his reaction to Dean’s surprise. “I’m the luckiest man on earth that I can call you mine,” he goes on to tell him, because he wants Dean to know how happy he is about the choices he’s made, and because he simply can’t help confessing his adoration for his darling boy out loud.
"Yes," he says to Dean's chest, and Dean barely suppresses a groan when he realizes Novak's voice got even deeper with how many times the head of Dean's cock has kissed his throat. "I want to try that with you," he adds, raising his gaze and looking at Dean through his lashes.
“When?”
“Amenable? Yes, Cas. I would be

about Cas. He really was. Dean wanted Cas to have a friend like that in his life. Someone who loved him and would protect him and be honest even when it was difficult. Friends like that are rare, and precious.
be your first crush, Dean has idolized Cas. Castiel Novak has become the touchstone Dean’s been comparing any person he’s had any form of romantic or sexual relationship with. Needless to say, none of them have ever been able to hold a candle to him. Which means Dean’s love history is made of month-long, rather than year-long, relationships. Dean needs to
Why is Cas asking Dean? Dean would have wagered Cas would either reply with “No, fuck you very much” or ask him to meet him in less than one hour someplace three hours away, and then use his lateness against him.

“Dean, baby, perfect-“ Cas babbles, between one love bite and the other, his hips madly grinding against Dean’s boneless body, which only prolongs Dean’s aftershocks and makes it even harder for him to catch his breath.
“Well, your husband might want you to be the one doing the fucking,” Dean replies.
Please be gentle with your hearts and handle the overload of domesticity that's about to follow with care 🥰😊
That was enough to remind Castiel that the correct and respectful thing to do is learning about Dean at Dean’s pace, thanks to anything the other man decides he’s ready to share with Castiel during their conversations. Castiel simply cannot take advantage of being the person who’s putting a roof above Dean’s head right now.
But how should he do it? How should he propose? The classic get on one knee and open a ring box to reveal an engagement band? That’s always a safe way to proceed, but he’d like something more
“It is. And, well, we’re getting swamped. She used to make appointments and handle the whole logistical aspect of the body shop, from answering the phone and welcoming clients to reminding my dad about orders and deliveries. This has always allowed us to focus on our job, and now we need to stop doing what we’re doing to go answer the phone every so often, among other things, and it’s fucking annoying.”
Cas’s kink limit seems to be non-existent today. Hell-fucking-yeah.
It’s not unheard of. Days can pass without them going all the way and being content with quick hand jobs in the shower or good morning blowjobs when they’re too busy to take the time to take each other apart enough that one can get inside the other. And, as sexual as they are, they are admittedly a pair of sappy fuckers, so they sometimes spend days just making out, or softly touching each other, while sharing small acts of affection and adoration, like bringing the other coffee in bed, cooking the other’s favorite meal, giving the other a massage after a particularly hard day at work, looking at each other as if one hung the moon and the other the stars.

Jimmy is eyeing him with an expression between utter disbelief, gratefulness and amusement. Could be worse, Dean thinks. Could be raining, right?
Right, the little spoon thing. He wants it but doesn’t want to ask again. So Dean lies down completely, still on his side, and opens his arms in invitation. The grin and the little bounce resulting from Cas all but flinging himself on his other side before he scoots back with a content sigh to press his back against Dean’s chest are definitely
It’s clear Cas can’t see what any of this has to do with any good news Dean might want to share with him. There’s not even a trace of hope on his face. He’s not even considering the possibility Dean might have put in a good word for him. So much for taking advantage of Dean.
Dean.
Castiel needs to stop this train wreck from happening because it is frankly painful to watch. “As enticing as the idea of you on your knees and begging is, I think I could be persuaded to have breakfast with you either on Wednesday or Thursday next week.”
Dean was so baffled it was Charlie the one who dragged him to retrieve their order while commenting “The coffee here

“Well, it’s not gonna be like that anymore, OK? Plus, I already told you how much I like sucking cock. And I can’t wait to taste yours.”
“Sure, Mr., um-“
“Never once.” Castiel cradles Dean’s face in his hands and ducks down to try and look into his eyes, but Dean’s resolutely keeping his gaze lowered. “Dean, look at me. Never once did you make me feel like that.”

But they have established that they will go to Central Park, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty together, even though Dean was afraid they weren’t ‘weird enough for “Mr. Espionage Museum” :-P’

there, between him and Dean. Something that could be significant, even long term, regardless of how afraid Castiel is of getting his hopes up too high and see them crushed and burned when Dean inevitably leaves his hotel. He cannot help but
He reminds himself he needs to get with the program, he has a plan in mind after all, and forces his eyes to leave the green beauty they were lost in to gaze at the lips Dean’s currently wetting with the tip of his tongue.
The pain in his neck shoots through Dean’s body like a bullet and lights up all of his nerve endings, turning him into a desperate mess. He moans loudly and grabs Cas’s ass with both hands to spread him as wide as he can as he fucks into him hard and deep. Cas’s exhausted body is heavy on top of him, and he’s not doing anything besides worrying the bite mark he’s left behind with his lips and tongue and letting himself being used for Dean’s pleasure. Dean’s fucking like an animal now, short, powerful thrusts that are setting his muscles on fire and making his breath labored and labored, only one goal in mind.
“Cas, um, I’m not even sure you’re listening? You’ve kinda just been staring at me for the last few minutes...”
“It’s gonna be so hard, being open,” Dean says after a little while. Because he’s worried, and he needs his... boyfriend – he smiles at the thought – to get him out of his own mind.

Dean’s literally panting, mouth open, forehead pressed against Novak’s, whose hands are groping Dean’s ass so hard he’s positive they’re leaving handprints on his cheeks, while his own hands cradle Novak’s dick as if it was the source of life. He’s big, long, warm, thick, hard, red, uncut, fucking
written all over Cas’s features, Dean couldn’t help a huge, smug smile, which made Cas’s frown turn into a squint Dean was sure could smite hordes of demons.
Once they’re both naked, Castiel starts walking them forward, toward the bed. Dean lets himself be guided backward without ever breaking their kissing or opening his eyes. He’s trusting Castiel will not steer them wrong.

Cas doesn’t let him go though, stopping his upward motion with both his hands on Dean’s hips.
“I’ll see you at the access point on 16th Street tomorrow at 5.30 pm. Goodbye Dean.”
“Jack told me a little bit about that, you know? I must say, I think what you do for them is really admirable, Dean.”
Then, to lighten the mood a bit, “I just never knew you were also a boy-scout, among other things.”
His hand doesn’t even make contact with his dick that Dean’s releasing Cas’s leg to be able to use that hand to keep himself upright while he uses the other to bat Cas’s hand away. “
But now that he has met him again, all the feelings Castiel had for the boy Dean once was have come back with a vengeance, and have intertwined with the feelings he’s developing for the man that Dean is now.
Hadn’t Castiel really not forgiven Dean yet? Dean was hurting about Mary, just like Castiel was hurting about Jack. Castiel knew he was. And Dean had
Castiel believes in second chances, in principle. He knows everyone can make mistakes, he himself knew that falling so hard for someone so obsessed with his reputation in high school was a mistake and he did it anyway. But he doesn’t know that he can give Dean another chance for real, instead of paying him back in kind and then be on his merry way as he had originally planned to do. Admittedly, Castiel doesn’t know what must have gone through Dean’s mind when they were kids. He’s gay, not bi, and has always just sort of known he was into men. He has never really felt the need to put too much thought into it either. It was something that just was. Like his blue eyes.
In case the name doesn’t make any bells ring, Corbett is the gay kid whose ghost ended up with a birthday hat at a ghost party during one of the episodes with the ghost facers. The poor kid was an absolute darling and totally deserved better, so I thought a revenge fuck with Dean, even though not ideal, is definitely better than what he got in canon. At least he gets some here lol
In the end, it’s the arrogance that goes hand in hand with being a bully that plays in Dean’s favor. What is clearly the leader of the little gang is the last to take the stand. Being the biggest bully of them all, he’s also the most insecure and arrogant. He’s the kind of person who feels better about himself not only when he can abuse others, but also – or
– into giving him anything less than what the man thinks Dean deserves. But he
He floods his boy’s ass with his load and he knows it’s a lot, because he hasn’t come in the last two days at all, a perverse sense of possessiveness dictating that he should preserve it all for tonight, so he could empty all he had inside his boy’s channel and fill him to the brim. He also knew that finally being able to come after so long would be incredibly satisfying, and it
The smile Jimmy gives him in reply is more breathtaking than the northern lights. Wow, all his blood flowing downstairs is clearly turning Dean into a poet.
He’s rambling.
The first time he came untouched Dean was fucking him from behind against the backrest of the couch. Cas came with Dean’s cock in his ass and not a hand on his own dick, the couch giving him the friction he needed. It was an incredible fuck, even though Cas was still bitching about the stain they left behind and had made Dean promise not to fuck him on the couch again before Cas had had the chance to throw a blanket over it. Dean took the pile of neatly folded blankets that appeared on a stool within arm’s reach of the couch a couple of days later as a sign that Cas wanted to be fucked there again. Dean wasn’t opposed.
“Well,” Dean’s looking almost embarrassed as he brings his left hand to the back of his neck, his eyes darting everywhere but Castiel’s face. “When we talked about you taking a shower here yesterday morning, I figured I’d have a chance to put some food and drinks in you, so I thought I’d get stuff you might like. So I asked Jess – that’s the amazing woman my brother managed to marry even though she’s totally out of his league – to do me a favor, since I knew she had to go grocery shopping anyway, and to buy some things for me and drop them off while I was at work.”
as a candidate for the role are one in a trillion. If Cas was really looking for something serious, the way Dean acted in high school might cost him any chance of ever convincing the gorgeous man in front of him to even talk to him, let alone give him a second chance and date him.
Once he had cleaned his own fingers and Cas’s chest, he helped him lie down and took a seat on the couch himself, letting Cas’s legs rest on his lap so he could caress his shins.
“And?” Castiel prompts while sucking on Dean’s shoulder hard enough to leave another bruise behind.
He closed blinds, locked doors, turned out lights, all the while reminding himself to breathe and keep his temper in check.
When he gets one, he can’t honestly believe his luck. Novak is nothing short of perfect. The moment he walked through the door – only to find the man already

“That’s my beautiful farm boy.”
In consideration of the quasi-daily attention Cas’s ass was getting, Dean even had a fleeting thought to start plugging him – he even mentioned it to Cas during sex, because he knew how wild he got when Dean talked dirty to him (“God, I love being inside of you, I wish I could just up and take you whenever I see you. I could keep you plugged all the time, so you’d be always ready, and you’d let me, wouldn’t you?” “Yes! Yes!”).
“Yes, you are. Now, shall we?”
, Cas.”
He’s seen it.
Dean barely has the time to sit down properly that Cas’s already straddling his lap. Dean loves fucking Cas however, whenever and wherever he wants. He’s even bottomed more than a couple times and loved it far more than he had in the past. But he still prefers to top and Cas prefers to bottom and as much as Cas is always, always unbelievably sexy when they fuck, nothing’s better than having him ride Dean’s cock. He does it like that’s his life mission. He’s never shy when they’re intimate, but when he’s topping from the bottom, that’s when he really lets it go and just goes with what he wants and feels like doing. That’s the one time Dean’s pleasure doesn’t take precedence, the one time Cas
Considering how well the studio is doing, he also started a program to help troubled teens last year. Even though he is no Missouri and definitely lacks her innate ability to connect with kids, he figured he had a chance to give back what he was given when he himself was a troubled high schooler on the verge of losing himself once and for all. Twice a week he offers free music classes to the kids in the neighborhood in a space in his studio he decided to turn into a music room for this specific purpose. Dean knows all too well that many of the kids he teaches every week were involved, not so long ago, in the wave of youth crime that had turned the area into a dangerous place to live and do business in, before the city council started investing to reclaim it. Some of them are still dealing with the fallout. Some are struggling with addiction, some are homeless, some have dropped out of school and are now stuck with a minimum-wage job with no hope of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel anytime soon. So Dean gives them a safe space where they can spend a few hours a week, make friends, learn something new, maybe discover a talent much like Dean himself did over those five weeks more than ten years ago.
It didn't help that he spent the whole drive staring at Dean, as if he was trying to count his freckles or grip his soul with his eyes. His staring was so intense that it took Dean a couple of seconds, after he put the car into park, to gather the courage to look at Castiel and face that hungry stare head on.
love. His teeth long to join the party, and so they do, biting the delicious flesh at their complete disposal oh so gently, and then not so gently, because this man is Castiel’s to mark now. And he knows that tomorrow’s Castiel is gonna be embarrassed as hell when Bobby will look at him, enquiring frown in place. But today’s Castiel couldn’t care less. Plus, working at the body shop, Castiel’s seen how some customers, and some of the mechanics too, look at Dean. So he very much suspects that, with the exception of his meeting with Dean’s dad that he’s really
more than anything. Or the increasingly statistic chance they’d end up fucking in missionary not so much because the friction on Cas’s dick helped him come untouched, but because that allowed Dean to see Cas’s eyes and kiss his lips the whole time.
That gets a reaction from Cas.
moans and a string of “Dean, Dean” and “Oh God”, “So good”, “Please” started leaving his mouth. He didn’t seem to be able to decide where to put his head, which he constantly lifted up and down, and turned left and right.

And you hope they like it too, so you can enjoy it together and bond over it.” Castiel knew that music was one of the few beautiful things Dean allowed himself to indulge in. And he had wanted to share it with him. His
A swallowing, big-eyed Dean is what Castiel gets in response. This is already so much better than he was expecting.
“It is,” Cas concedes, but he’s smiling, serene, and Dean’s lungs expand a little more. “But it is also the only way to live life to its full potential. And for what is worth,” he continues, a mischievous light appearing in his eyes all of a sudden and a sexy little smirk on his lips, “there’s one person who appreciates you for exactly who you are right here, right now.”
Right. Now or never.
Breaking the kiss so he can look straight into Dean’s eyes, Castiel asks the one question he knows only Dean – and, he supposes, time – can really give an answer to.
Then he takes a deep breath and asks, “Ok, how do you wanna do this?”
“I mean, you are so handsome, and smart, and always nice with everyone. I see how many of my patrons look at you. I just assumed, you know...”
Cas hums. He sure does that a lot.
They don’t go on like that for long – Dean's always known they wouldn’t. However they start, when Cas is topping they almost invariably end up in his favorite position. On their side, plastered to one another head to toes, while Cas thrusts deeply inside of him from behind. His right arm gets around Dean’s neck and his right hand lands on Dean’s left shoulder, which Cas never fails to kiss and bite between one kiss to Dean’s lips and the other, so he can keep Dean exactly where he wants him and pull him down on the upward thrusts of his cock, and Cas’s left hand wraps around Dean left tight to help him lift it up over Cas’s hip and keep it there.
“Yeah, I-, sure, I’ll be whatever you want, if you want. But we, um, are in public?”
he does. “That’s good to know, considering how much I love shower sex in the morning.”
His mind made up, Castiel stood up, walked to his closet and started packing a few essentials. The rent had been paid until the end of the month, so he had all the time to come back and take everything else, if things went well. And he’d have somewhere to go for once, if they didn’t.
distant. That was fifteen years ago. The Dean he met again a few months ago has been anything but monstrous.
He starts playing with Cas’s hair while they lie there, content to just being with each other at long last.
The gasp quickly followed by Cas breaking their kiss to fix Dean wide-eyed makes Dean understand Cas has found Dean’s surprise for him.

how not to be good. That didn’t mean Dean wasn’t thrilled to give Cas what he had asked for and he didn’t absolutely love seeing Cas choke on his cock and his tears fall from those sparkling blue eyes while his boy worked to learn how to take all of him down his throat.
Cas looks at him but doesn’t ask. This is something Dean has to do, isn’t it? He’s the one who turned their burgeoning relationship into a nightmare in high school. It’s up to him to turn things around now. And it would also be a good way to start the process of forgiving himself. A symbolical righting of wrongs past. Let everyone in his class know that Dean Winchester was, and still is, completely and irrevocably gone on Castiel Novak.
“Ok, but I need you to at least promise me something, Castiel. Promise you’ll come here on the nights when it’s really cold or it’s raining and you don’t find a bed at the shelter.”
“Dean?” Cas whispers, tentative and awestruck, and with suspiciously misty eyes.
Soooo, as usual, let me first of all thank you guys for the love. This fic means a lot to me and I'm SO happy many of you seem to like it as much as I hoped you would.
“Just-“, Cas hesitated again, staring at Dean for a few seconds as if to make sure Dean was actually interested in his reply. Dean held his gaze the whole time. He didn’t like seeing Cas so tense, and he needed to understand if there was something he could do to help.
“Done. I want us to get tested and then I would like to ditch condoms forever.”
“The table’s ready.” The ding of the oven timer right then pulls a little laugh out of both of them.
“Please...”
Cas is on him in a second.
After leaving Dean at the motel, Castiel had done the only thing he could think of doing: he went to the only other place he was familiar with. He spent the night crying all of his tears in the back alley of the diner and waited for it to open. Then, knowing his eyes were red and puffy even without needing to look at himself in the mirror, he told Sue that he had to leave. He had debated just leaving town without stopping by the diner, fearing, and half hoping if he had to be honest with himself, that Dean might follow him. He decided against it though. He knew Sue, Maggie and Àngel would worry about him if he just vanished like that. And he didn’t want to go without saying goodbye either. They had come to mean to him, and he wouldn’t mind having a chance to hug them one last time.
for her to give him even an inch. She spent that time not so subtly interrogating him and trying to see whether he would ever contradict himself, and everyone could see that she would watch his every move whenever they were in the same room. They ended up bonding over playing pool and darts of all things, when Cas commented once he had never done either thing because none of his ‘friends’ – yes, he had used air-quotes and all – would have ever considered those activities worthy of their time, but that he would have loved to learn. When his reply to Jo’s question whether he had any qualms about being taught by a girl was “Of course not. Even less so if the girl was you. Dean hasn’t stopped whining about having to wash your car for a month because you beat him at pool since it happened”, everyone knew the probation period was finally over. And if Ellen is Cas’s mama bear, Jo is his sister bear, ready to throw a dart right in the eye of anyone who so much as looks at “her third brother” sideways.

“Always.”
Things go blissfully smooth, which shouldn’t have really been surprising. Dean’s spent much more time at Cas’s in the last year than Cas has spent at Dean’s, so the transition between spending a few days in a row there and spend every day there has been pretty seamless. Dean already had a toothbrush in the bathroom and his drawer in the dresser in the bedroom. His favorite food had already found a place in the kitchen cupboards. A few of his DVDs had never made the journey back to his rented apartment. A few of his shirts had somehow ended up mixed with Cas’s in his closet and they had started both wearing them, having a similar size in their upper body – not in the lower region, though, Dean’s bow legs just can’t compete with Cas’s strong, thick, powerful, delicious thighs.
“It’s not like it’d be the first time someone proposes a similar arrangement.”
“Well,” Cas starts, voice small and eyes somehow more attracted by Dean’s clavicle than his face, “I was thinking, maybe, um, considering that things, I mean, are going pretty great, right? So, um, you could maybe, if you wanted, of course, possibly,
Cas shed a few tears when Dean gave it to him and made no secret, from that day on, that that blanket had automatically become the second most prized possession in his hoard, after Dean.
Thanks everyone for the feedback on the last update! Hope you're all safe and healthy out there.
As for Charlie, the only reason why Dean isn’t madly jealous of her relationship with Cas is that they are both gayer than Bert and Ernie. They bonded over… everything. Their love of literature, to start with. She roped him into LARP in no time and Dean got to see Cas wearing the pink princess dress he himself had meticulously chosen. His enthusiasm in choosing it had totally given him away and he had to confess his naughty thoughts to his boyfriend. Which made for a

He no longer could live in that weird sort of limbo he had been stuck in all those years.

“I mean that I don’t believe in the fact that there are general rules about being a good boyfriend. Every person is different, what is great for someone would make someone else cringe. So... let’s talk about what are the guidelines to be a good boyfriend to
“Fuck, I’m getting close, don’t stop,” Cas pleads.
The little smile that thought elicits is soon forgotten, however, when Dean starts massaging his scalp with the deliciously-smelling shampoo and the combination of the warm water hitting his muscles, the nice smell filling his nostrils and being amplified by the vapor rising up, and the touch of his finger pads against his scalp send him straight to sensory heaven and relax him just like he needs after the day he had yesterday.
“Then I guess we can.”
wait.
“How are you feeling, my love?” Castiel asks, using the pet name he always uses with his husband. “You got me a little worried for a minute there,” he adds, in case Dean wants to discuss his brief moment of panic. If he doesn’t want to right now, Castiel won’t push. They can talk about it later when Dean’s had all the time to rest and recharge a bit.
They are so blue, Cas’s eyes. God but Dean missed them. He missed having them on him. He hopes, if things go well, that they will go back to tracking him wherever he goes when Cas and Dean are in the same room. He would need and cherish that comfort, to know that it’s real, that he really got his man back against all odds.
When Castiel had left the bunker the last time, it was because Dean wouldn’t let him talk to him, even though he had tried, multiple times. That was what had made Castiel think that there was no hope for them. How could they move past it, if Dean wouldn’t so much as look him in the eye, let alone let him talk and actually listen?
“Apologies, I thought you’d
Why is Cas stopping? Was that going too far? Cas isn’t-?
“Are you sure, Dean? You’re so young, you could have anyone you want, I-”
So, yes, Castiel is jealous. Very much so. Of any person who’s ever touched his man.
His spiraling thoughts sour his mood enough that he doesn’t think he can – or should – keep talking with Dean tonight. He might say or do something he could regret. So he uses the long working week as the excuse to bid him an early good night and switches off the phone.
who’s already treated you like
“I’m sorry,” Dean whines a little, “I just wanted my proposal to be perfect and a ring of the wrong size is the opposite of perfect,” he adds with a remorseful tone.
When the idea finally pops into his mind he freezes. That’s
This amazing man has done nothing but help him and that’s how he’s repaid him. By lying to him for days. Castiel has nothing. He begs for food and shelter. Yet he’s never felt as ashamed as he feels now.
“If it pleases you, Omega.”
How much hurt could someone face and swallow, before becoming prey to an all consuming anger? And to the sequence of unhealthy coping mechanisms, consequent bad decisions, subsequent regrets, and inevitable self-loathing that anger would jump start?
music until a guitar was thrust in his hands on his first day of punishment. He found out he was apparently a natural with a guitar, because he learned to play simple tunes by week three and he never stopped playing after that. He also discovered that he could actually sing, and quite well too, and that singing and playing made him feel good, happy even, when he thought nothing could anymore.
“You were that desperate for it, eh?” The smirk in Cas’s voice is the best indication the question is rhetorical.
“I am. I’m your good boy.”
“Yep. Wanted to see how you’re doing. And I also have something for you.”
the correct one, and Dean’s probably about to speak with Cas’s secretary. Whom he might have instructed not to put Dean through, so Dean tries not to get too carried away just yet.
When his Dom uses his thumbs to open him further so he can slip his tongue inside, Dean feels delirious and starts asking for “More, please, Omega,
Dean’s not sure saying hi is that great of an idea, but he’s so, so tired of watching from afar. He’s starting to forget the exact shade of Cas’s eyes, he’s itching to hear that deep voice and smell that heady scent again.
“Fuck, sweet baby, so tight. You did, eh? Opened yourself nice and slow for me?”
kind of game Dean is playing. And that can only mean one of two things. Either Dean is far smarter and a better actor than any slimy person Castiel’s ever dealt with – and he’s dealt with tons of those in his working life – or there is no game, and Dean has genuinely become the decent person he appears to be. Not to mention that, if Cas was to believe what Dean has told him so far, there’s a chance that he’s always been a decent guy, just like Castiel himself thought he might be back in high school, but his insecurities and confusion got the better of him.
“Grab a pillow and place it between my feet, darling boy.”
Might it be that Castiel not coming back could be Dean’s? Might it be
“Please, Dean, please I’m begging you, I need something to fill me up, I will never come like this.”
he’s hoping to get his perfect, little ass spanked, but impact play isn’t on the menu tonight either.
I am! New York, man! New York! And this place is as great as the website described, and,” Dean can’t help the softening of his smile, “and I’m here with
The complete silence is what brings Dean back to the present moment. The room is empty. So much for speaking with Novak.
“Not that I’m complaining baby, I’m very much not, but what is all of this for?”
sex. Dean honestly thinks the day he doesn’t want sex will be the day of his funeral. What he wants is sex
“I’m glad, Jimmy. I really, really am.”
“Mmmm, yeah, talk dirty to me, Papa.”
“So do you? Wanna be my boyfriend?”
But he’s been so good, so unbelievably perfect, and Castiel himself is getting so close.
Basically, Castiel feels like they’ve spent the last eleven days dating without ever leaving the premises of the hotel. Even more so these past couple of days, since their conversations started happening not only at breakfast, but also in the garden after dinner.
Cas lifts his head to look at Dean, his bed hair a total disaster but his eyes clear and his smile brighter than a sunbeam. “No, Dean, I most definitely wouldn’t. I’m-,” he pauses and takes a breath. “I’m actually kind of hoping I’ll see you around for breakfast for a long time, even though you’ll no longer be a guest.”
“Yes. Yes, Cas, anything.”
‘Oh, thank fucking goodness!’ Dean’s mental voice screams in his head while he jumps up – his knee will
The meeting with Jimmy had made Dean realize that, like his linen closet, the rest of his closet could use some freeing up and that he should give the clothes he never wore to someone who might need them.
They stay like that for long moments, longer than it’s ever happened with other men, silent, enjoying these last stolen seconds of being one with the other. Until Cas presses a soft, lingering kiss to Dean’s back, pushes up on his arms and pulls out.
“I did. More than. Thank you,” Castiel replies, getting up and walking into the kitchen. He doesn’t think he’s ever said those two words as often as he has in the past five days. “I’ll-“, Jesus but his mouth is dry, some water would be nice, “- just use the toilet, if I may, and get dressed and I’ll be out of your hair in a minute.” Better not to overstay his welcome, right?
. I want them to know you’re finally getting the dick you’ve been taunting me for for
Not without his boyfriend by his side.
“You know.”
“You mean-“
, and when he tried to tell Cas he
– laugh at the thought that things had come full circle. That was how things between them had started, with Dean cornering Cas at the café just before closing time. And that was how they would end.
So naturally Dean has no other choice but to pull him off of his dick, haul him up and plunge his tongue into his mouth, groaning when he can taste his own precome. He's keeping Novak pressed against himself so tightly they can barely breathe with how constricted their chests are.
“Thanks.” There, the same open, polite smile Castiel has seen Dean direct to the waiting staff at the conference, so very different from the uneasy one he reserved for the waitress at Chelsea Market. Dean does clean up good when he’s wearing his work clothes. He’s dashing in this blue suit, white shirt and...
Castiel didn’t leave him behind.
Cas relaxes immediately, and curiosity takes the place of worry. “Okay?”
E-n-o-u-g-h.
Seeing how this man is afraid to let himself hope he could have even something as small as a warm drink is making Dean feel sick, so he just smiles tightly in response and starts walking.
The soy milk carton was
His sense of inadequacy, for example. Which, Castiel had always suspected, was to be traced back to the Great Chain of Being,  the idea that there was a hierarchical order of the universe wanted by god himself, starting with him, then angels, then humans, then animals, plants and minerals. An idea which had had a pervasive power, especially in Western thought. Castiel supposed that was why humans often felt untitled to treat animals and exploit plants and minerals as if they owned them. Based on this idea, they did. They were superior and, as such, could do with them as they saw fit. And, well, it really sounded like Chuck to plant an idea like that in a whole world’s mind. An idea in which he was at the same time the beginning and the top. Self-centered like he was, he must have loved the notion of being on top of everything, looking down on angels, people, animals and plants and making sure that they knew it. Dean though. Self-deprecating as he was, he must have never been able to get rid of the notion that he was somehow
Apparently, he’s made the right decision, considering what he’s seeing now. Dean knows that he should do what he always does when he realizes a right decision was made. He should smile to himself, take a moment to appreciate that at least one of the things he donated seems to be helping someone, wish them all the best and keep walking, going back to living his life without fanfare.
As much as he’s spent the whole day wishing he could just talk to Cas, he could have told him over dinner. And he could have certainly led with something other than “can we talk”. Facepalming at himself wouldn’t be a winning move, would it? Because Dean kinda wants to do that right now.
significant.
He turns around expecting to see him next to him but no. Cas’s gone. The sudden movement causes the soreness in his backside to flare, very much proving that last night was not a dream. He’s still completely naked too, just like he was when he fell asleep.
How fiercely he hated gravity.
Dean ignores him. A promise is a promise, after all. He keeps rimming him until his jaw aches – Dean’s sure it will ache for days, which is a small price to pay just to hear all the filthy things Novak’s saying – and kneading his cheeks so his thumbs can help spread Novak’s hole for his tongue to push inside.
“Mm,” Cas hums. What does that
Whenever Castiel listened to
After so much pining, our boys finally get together.
Distracted as he was by the news that he had yet another commitment, for the second night in a row, that would keep him away from Cas, Dean lost his window of opportunity to attract Cas’s attention. It didn’t help that Cas had clearly seen something that he didn’t like, because Dean had a front row seat to watch his back going stiff as a board and his shoulders tensing like they did when Cas was very, very displeased. Dean had noticed the new girl was taking orders for the first time today, so she probably had made some kind of minor mistake that Cas had deemed unforgivable and had rushed to fix.
“Yes, Dean, my love, yes of course we are.”
and wouldn’t risk angering his Dom again in such a short amount of time – he quickly adds, “You can use your hands to take me out and then put them on the couch for stability.”

The song had finished while he was trapped in his own thoughts and a new one had begun, and Castiel made a mental note to check the playlist later and make sure he saved that song in his ‘liked’ playlist.
Dean has a few seconds to enjoy how incredible it is to be fucked so deep and to feel Cas’s cock pressed against his prostrate with basically every thrust in this position, when Cas stops.
“Sleep, My Heart, I’ll watch over you.”
“Dean, I’m so-“
Castiel’s not surprised. Honored and awed, but not surprised. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to know more. “How so?”
Castiel doesn’t get to finish his sentence before Dean throws his head back and laughs loudly. “Oh man, I thought I’d never hear you swear! I didn’t think you even
lucky days when he gets given more than some spare change and he can afford it, he also washes his clothes at a laundromat, which, until Dean and his hand-me-downs came along, he’d only been able to do thanks to the change of clothes he was given at the shelter the same day they gave him the ratty bag he’s used to store them and his other few possessions in ever since. That was a few weeks before Dean’s blankets were distributed and he chose the ugliest, but also funniest, one, Cas remembers now with a fond smile.

“Then go ahead, beautiful, come on my cock. That would make me so proud,” Dean replied, before landing a pretty hard smack on his boy’s ass that sounded
desired. He’s a man, and Dean has always preferred men to women, but, again, never dared to admit to it aloud because his father would always talk about it as a necessary chore: “Male omegas have needs too, Dean, and alpha women are far less common than us, so it is our duty to help when need be, even if we’d rather not.” Little did his father know that a male omega had
that gagging is
As usual, thank you so much, a big hug and endless cookies to every beautiful soul who showed loved for the fic and me in any way, big or small, so far. Y'all amazing :-*
But as the days passed and his anger started growing rather than decreasing, he realized he was actually mad at both Cas and himself. At Cas for making him feel and think about things he’s become a world champion at ignoring and at himself for being suddenly unable to keep ignoring them semi-professionally like he’s done so far.
, is he?!
“My car,” Dean replies, looking – and feeling – slightly embarrassed at having taken it for granted Castiel knew that, even though they were never that close. He might have secretly hoped Cas had taken the time to learn everything he could about Dean in high school. Much like Dean himself had done with Castiel. “And yes, she isn’t exactly eco-friendly, but means a lot to me and my family. My dad still has her, but doesn’t exactly drive her all that often anymore. He usually takes my mum’s very ecological car.”
Even if there is, it’s not like he can live the rest of his life in his bedroom. So he takes one last, deep breath and gets up from bed. The soreness in his ass makes him wince and makes tears start pooling in his eyes again. He knows the tears are not caused by the physical pain, which is really more of a background feeling. A feeling he’d be delighted to feel, for days on end, if he could have kept Cas. A feeling that would constantly remind him that Cas wanted him. Right now, that feeling is just a reminder of how much Cas does
“- hey, no. I would
“If that is the case,” Dean starts, because he has to know for sure, “do you think you‘d be opposed to me still having breakfast here, even though I check out tomorrow?”
Novak ducks his gaze, a light blush appearing on his cheeks instantly, and Dean thinks, not for the first time since entering that public restroom, that he's utterly
“You wore a butt plug while having drinks with
Two evenings ago, Castiel was looking for a book he was certain he’d stored in one of the bookcases in the breakfast room when he noticed Dean was lounging on one of the couches in the garden, seemingly lost in thought while watching the darkening sky. Book forgotten – Castiel still, two days later, doesn’t remember what book it was, so it probably wasn’t important anyway – he made his way outside before he even had time to ponder the decision.
learn to wear shoes.”
“C’mon, Cas, dig in. Hope you like it.” Dean’s smile is a little nervous thing. He’s afraid Cas won’t like his food or won’t consider himself properly wooed if h- “Oh my God,
Cas replies asking him if he’d like to pick him up at the office, rather than waiting in front of the building for him to come down.
“I guess that’s… something.”
Dean notices the care is not only in the furnishing of the place, which is filled with nice little touches, but also in the service. On a dresser in front of the bed, he finds complementary cookies and flavored teas, not only the average ones but the exotic kinds too, such as mango and lychee green tea, and flavored honey. The whole thing makes the place appear even more domestic.
“Cas, please, put it back in, please.”
“Dean, please, I’d be so tight for you, you can fuck me for as long as you want.”
That was, however, the only moment in which Dean doubted that Cas was, in fact, made for Dean, and Dean for him.
“Dean,” Cas whines, when his patience clearly starts running out.
“Dinner?”
“I do. And I love
Thank you so, so, so much for the love and support. You know it means a lot to me, but it bears repeating :-) :-*
“Yes,” Cas replies, sure and fierce, “and I’m not letting you go.”
. Especially his students. Or he wouldn’t “constantly raise the bar” and demand they complete “increasingly more articulated projects” within impossible deadlines. That simply wasn’t humanly possible. Truth be told, Dean had always suspected the professor was a demon in disguise, and this last
He was totally unprepared for it too, the first time Castiel came face to face with him. He thought Dean was a jackass harassing poor Jack and had barreled into the breakfast room ready to toss the man out on his ass, when Dean had turned around and made Castiel’s systems shut down one by one. Those green eyes, those heart shaped, plush lips, and those freckles. Castiel stopped being able to think for a few seconds and even forgot he was supposed to be furious with him.
Dean laughs too. “That makes it even weirder that you should do this then!”
Novak doesn’t say a word – a delicious reminder of how this whole thing began, with Novak accepting Dean’s silent invitation without a word being spoken – just turns around and walks toward the bed, giving Dean an outstanding view of his ass. It’s so round and perky and Dean can’t wait to put his hands and tongue on it and
“Dean. You’re back.”
And the fucker knows.

“Not really, considering I live upstairs, so I don’t have to commute.”
hurt, but he had also understood Balthazar’s point of view. He didn’t know Dean, not the man he had become. He only remembered the boy who had hurt his best friend in high school and didn’t trust him. They both concluded that he needed time to get to know Dean before he could come around, like Cas himself had done.
When class was over, Cas hadn’t replied yet. He was probably busy at the café. One hour after closing time, Cas still hadn’t replied. Nor had he replied when Dean was getting ready for bed, or when it was lights out.
Once they get in front of Castiel’s building and have said their goodnight, Dean makes a  move to kiss him. Castiel leans forward too, but retreats at the very last second with a satisfied smirk, what he knows is an equally satisfied glint in his eyes, and a “goodnight Dean”.
– attention while Dean is busy devouring Cas’s mouth and neck and
“Yeah, babe, let me hear all the pretty noises I’m fucking out of you,” Dean can’t help but say, as he’s hooking Cas’s left knee in the crook of his right elbow. Dean loves taking Cas like this. This position opens him up completely and allows Dean to have a safe hold on his boyfriend no matter how hard he fucks into him.
wanted to mark his good boy from the inside like he did from the outside. And it was not like there was anything weird with that. That was a basic, animal instinct, totally understandable in light of a relationship that was purely physical. It was bound to stoke his primal flames. No weird emotional shit involved. Uh uh. Not at all. Not even a little.
“Yes,” Dean nods frantically, even with one of his Dom’s hands still gripping his hair, “Yes, I was, Omega.”
“I’m sorry, I-“
insistent that Dean’d have to pay a whole month rent if he was even “
What. In. The. World. Was. Going. On. Here.
“Are you...just gonna look at it or?” Novak asks, and he manages to sound impatient, insecure, embarrassed and eager all at once.
Date night.
“That’s, um. I don’t know what to say. Just-,” the man’s words are interrupted by a small chuckle and a beautiful smile that reaches as far as the man’s eyes. Eyes – blue, blue eyes – that are now fixed on Dean, happy and honest. “Thank you.”
Maybe it’s because of that, or because Dean is weak, or because he’s
“So, I-. I made dinner. As a thank you. I hope you don’t mind?”
Dean’s light blush is adorable. “Yeah. I, um, I mean, having you around looking
Hence, ‘don’t get carried away, Castiel.’
“I love you too, Omeg-”
“And, suppose I stay, would there be some breakfast included too?”
The third one remains the old blanket, the one that got them together, that they still keep, for sentimental reasons.
“OK, so, like I said I haven’t done this in a while. But you’ll tell me if you’re uncomfortable, yes?”
It’s not gonna be easy for him to never falter, especially at first. But he owes himself, and Castiel, to try, and to succeed.
Still, Dean wants Cas to feel appreciated and validated, and he also wants to take the chance to let him know he’s not the only one who swings that way. So he replies “Well, their loss. Let them endure their sad, hateful life in doucheland while we make the most of Eden without them,” before winking at the man and smiling his signature Winchester seductive smile.
“Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad. It’s actually good news. And I can’t wait to share it with you,” Dean tries to amend, adding a bright, reassuring smile for good measure.
"You feel so good, sweetheart," Cas says, even out of breath as he is, and Dean doesn't know how he can talk right now, Dean can only feel and make sounds.
very happy. ”As you wish,” he replies with that blinding smile of his that can put even the sun to shame.
Cas freezes with both hands still around his dick.
They can talk later. They
Castiel, surprisingly, doesn’t mind and has never felt threatened, even though he’s honest with himself enough to admit that that’s probably because the two of them have never shared a purely sexual experience. He’s also confident in his skills as a Dom enough to know that, as satisfying as it is for Dean to scene with Benny every once in a while, it doesn’t hold a candle to how much safety, satisfaction, security and love Castiel can offer the boy. Because love the boy he does, so much so that Castiel wants him to be as well fed as he needs to be, which leads him to sit in the audience every time Dean and Benny scene together: both to make sure his boy is always safe – logically he knows he is, Benny would never hurt him and he’s a damn good Dom, but that’s
“Yeah?”
“That’s right. Did you do as I asked in my text?”
So Castiel stops talking and stops thinking and, once again, goes back to feeling. Feeling the incredible heat of Dean’s body below him and around him. Feeling his chest rise and fall with his labored breathing, his legs and arms tightening around his body, his hands scratching his skull and his back, his mouth and teeth and tongue kissing, biting and licking any part of Castiel they can reach. The sounds he makes, the moans and groans and grunts and the little “oh” and “ah” leaving his mouth every now and then.
‘YES!’ Dean texts back right away.
“How did she react?”
“Man, I hope you can hear me. I hope you can hear me.”
“I can’t deny I would have appreciated a more direct approach on your part and that you would have just told me, but it is what it is, I guess. So I just didn’t see the point in us meeting tonight or the other night. I assume it was for you to be able to make it 100% clear. But there’s no need. It
At 10 PM sharp, Dean was knocking on Cas’s door and being greeted by the smilest smile that ever smiled, as usual.
“You mean you’d just buy me dinner without expecting anything? Not even a blowjob?”
In those fantasies, the man’s features were fuzzy at best, reconstructed from what Castiel had glimpsed of him from the windows of his hotel. They are now far more defined. Yes, Castiel still fantasizes about riding the driver of the car in the backseat as if the first prize of the rodeo to beat all rodeos was at stake. Only, the man’s features aren’t blurry any more. These days, Castiel doesn’t ride the driver of the car. He rides
“Some turn to homeless people to have sex acts performed for half the price they’d pay respectable hookers. In my case, my cocksucker lips would apparently be enough to forget about the homeless thing for 5 minutes. But only if I swallow, of course.”
“You are
“Yeah, I am. Even though, I think I could give this place a run for their money. If I didn’t think you’d think I was just trying to get in your pants, I would have invited you over and made breakfast for you. I can make some mean pancakes myself, and I could have baked you pie.”
“Oh, the heart because you love with your heart, so that means you love the song? That’s clever.”
It works like a charm. Novak’s eyes meet Dean’s, any insecurity gone, pure
When he steps into the shower, he can’t help but marvel at how spacious it is and at what an incredible water pressure it has. The products he finds in there are green and eco-friendly, the label proudly says, and he can see, and smell, that both the shampoo and the shower gel are based on lavender. There’s someone who has an obsession with lavender in this place, isn’t there?
Hope you guys enjoy the update!
Dean decided to add those damn ears just to irk Charlie, as payback for emotionally blackmailing him into attending those classes. He makes a mental note to buy Charlie a beer, possibly a fruit basket too, soon.
The bastard’s even slowed down the pace of his hips, teasing Dean with nice and slow when he’s showed him how hard and fast he can go and he
Cas and Dean meet for their breakfast date
“Did you like having Sir so deep inside of you?” He checks, while his palms rub his sub’s back.
“Why do you wanna help me, Dean? You don’t even know me. For all you know, I might be a monster, I might deserve this.”
He feels guilty enough that even when Dean enters the room – Castiel feels his eyes on him even before he sees the man himself – he doesn’t abandon the nice family he’s taking care of like he would have done otherwise – like he’s done every other morning as soon as Dean set foot in the breakfast room – to go wait on him right away and not waste a single second of his precious time to look his fill and talk with him.
it when Dean calls him with that stupid name. He hates it more and more every time he uses it.
He’s almost afraid to leave the bedroom though. He knows Castiel didn’t leave anything in here, but he doesn’t know that if he goes to the living room or kitchen, hell, possibly the very door to his apartment, he won’t find a snarky note about how his ass had been good enough that the time Castiel’s wasted on him hasn’t been all wasted after all, but he shouldn’t call Cas ever again, or something equally degrading. Same reason why Dean will delay looking at his phone for as long as he possibly can. If Cas didn’t leave a note, he might have sent Dean a text along those lines.
“Why didn’t you say something?”
The most pleased smile appeared on Castiel's face, showing two rows of perfect white teeth that Dean wanted to feel against his neck.
“Yes, and I’ll be thinking about being on my knees for you while I do.”
Even in the darkness, Cas’s horror is unmistakable on his face. “God, no.”
Because Cas likes him. It was clear in the way he looked at Dean, the way he fucked him, the way he asked him out, almost shy and hopeful, even though he’d been an unrestrained beast just a few minutes earlier.
Dean stood perfectly still for a few seconds to let Cas adjust, even though he barely needed it these days with how often they were fucking, and then put his hands on Cas’s shoulders and told him to get up on his knees.
Once he’s done, Castiel rewards him with a lick and little nip of his earlobe, which always makes his adorable boy shiver, and tonight is no exception.
I am sad to see this fic come to an end, incredibly happy to have managed to finish it, and extremely grateful for all the love and nice words and thoughts you have shared with me along the way. It's been absolutely amazing to be able to share this with you.
To be honest, Castiel didn’t even try, after their non-date turned date, to stifle his sex dreams. When he entered the building that night, he knew that he was going to rub one out as soon as he walked through the door of his apartment. Just like he knew he would have thought about fucking all of Dean’s holes in every conceivable position for the next ten days at the very least.
“Alright,” Cas sighs, as if he’s just agreed to the hardest of compromises. “But can you also grab one of our phones before you come back to bed?”
“Ready?”
So he’s been plotting tonight for a few days, and has risked spilling the beans on at least twenty-three different occasions. Somehow, he’s managed to not give anything away.
“I did.”
again.”
“Oh, sweetheart, you will,” he says.
Dean was
If looks could slice, Dean would be a 10,000 piece puzzle on the floor now.
Cas made a choked up sound and whispered “Oh God” before letting his head fall back on the couch.
He’d been so tender afterwards, as he was cleaning Dean up, too. Dean needs to bite one of his fists to stop the sob that’s halfway to his lips. Dean felt so...cherished. And then he’d stayed. Cas had given him that too. Knowing how it feels to fall asleep the happiest you’ve ever been, with the man you love wrapped around you, feeling safe and protected. Because Dean is self aware enough now to know that the feelings he’s had for years have only intensified and taken permanent root in his heart in the last few weeks. The more Dean got to talk with Cas and spend time with him, the more he realized he was exactly the smart, quirky, confident, strong man Dean was hoping he’d be. Dean had fallen for him body, mind and soul.
over – grabs a handful of Cas's soft, messy dark hair and pulls his face backward enough that he can crash their mouths together. Cas's responding moan turns into a muffled cry when Dean bits down on his bottom lip and his whole body locks up before he stills and lands, heavy and perfect, on top of Dean.
Once he’s done, Dean goes back to stand in front of the couch and resumes the position he held after bringing his Dom his drink, and waits.
“There you go. Besides, you’re not a stranger. We’re getting to know each other, becoming friends.”
That earns him a confused, alarmed “Are you two...?”
Dean closed his eyes again and sneaked his tongue inside Cas’s mouth, which opened up instantly, while his hands started to roam along the beautiful expanse of naked flesh at their disposal. They caressed Cas’s neck, shoulders, arms, chest, marveling at how soft his skin was in contrast to the firmness of the muscles underneath. It was like touching silk padding a steel surface.
mentioned breakfast the previous night, but Castiel hadn’t dared hope. Better to have low expectations than fierce disappointment. The street sure is a generous teacher. And Castiel needs to at least remind Dean he doesn’t see that as a given. He’s been way kinder than Castiel could have ever hoped for. What he’s already done is so much more than enough. He’s done more than letting him take a shower, feeding him a good meal and offering him a comfortable bed. He’s respected him, helped him without asking for anything in return, anything at all, treated him like a
On a blanket.
Jimmy’s shoulders slumping and his sigh precede a barely whispered “No. I got there too late. I-.”
As much as the ceremony and the reception were absolutely perfect, both of them dashing in their suits and happy like they had never been, surrounded by friends and family that couldn’t have been happier for their happy ending, which was really just a beginning, nothing compared to their first dance.
Dean knows the tears in his voice are impossible to ignore. So he’s not surprised when Castiel calls him out. “Dean, please tell me the truth. What’s wrong?”
From a physical point of view, Cas is everything Dean has always wanted and never dared confess. Taller and broader than the average omega, he can manhandle Dean with ease, something an alpha shouldn’t want but Dean has
“Ah ah, eyes on me, beautiful. Eyes always on me.”
To know he’s a giving lover. Dean supposes he should be grateful to Cas for that. He could have been far rougher and meaner while he was taking his revenge. But he wasn’t. He could have fucked Dean however he wanted, Dean would have let him. He could have just bent him over and screwed him fast and dirty, but he didn’t. He let Dean decide how they’d do it, he prepped him like he needed to be prepped and was patient and gentle while doing it too. Dean knows that Cas is big enough that, if he only had used three fingers rather than four, Dean would have felt a very different kind of burn. But Cas spared him. He even let Dean have his pleasure, satisfying all his kinks one by one, without ever mocking him for them, and he made sure Dean would come.
“I’m sorry, this is stupid,” Cas says while hiding his face in his hands.
“I know, baby boy, I know,” Castiel soothes, placing his hands on Dean’s hips to trace calming circles with his thumbs, while his forehead goes to rest between Dean’s shoulder blades and they both pant from how overwhelming it is to be joined this deeply.
Castiel lies on top of Dean, like he did on the couch. And Dean spreads his legs wide to welcome him. This
No one knows, however, that their behavior in public is just an extension of their D/s dynamic at home. Every kiss, every hug, every touch, every word of praise, every term of endearment is a reward for Dean’s unique ability to please his Dom and a reminder that Dean belongs to his Dom and his Dom only. Every text is a regular check in to make sure Dean is safe and isn’t dropping, to let Dean know how happy his Dom is with him, and what he expects from Dean.
“OK. I’ll call back at 3.30. Sharp. Thank you,” he forces himself to reply before clicking the end button. His breathing’s a little quicker and there’s a slight tremor in his hands. He’s a nervous wreck. He can’t help it. He’s here now, and he’s gonna stay here and build a life for himself and work his ass off, and turn this place into his apartment, and explore the city. He’s gonna do all that. But god it’d be so much better if he didn’t have to do all that alone, and could do it with Castiel by his side. He
trying to understand who the person in front of him is now, and trying to catch him in a lie. Which is why Dean hasn’t told a single one. He’s been an open book, completely transparent, something he would have never done on a first date – because Dean is considering this as a first date and no one can change is mind – but he couldn’t help doing with Cas. Cas isn’t just any date. And Dean really wants to earn this second chance. And giving Cas the means to decide if he could be interested in dating Dean is the only way Dean knows how.
Once he’s satisfied with his job, he goes for the oil again, to pour more on his hands before starting on the other foot. He just glances at the glass very quickly and sees there’s still some wine in it. “Finish your wine, love. It’d be a shame if it went to waste.”
that kind of thing, so Dean should just stop thinking and acting as if he was living in a fanfiction and appreciate that this was reality and he was having a very naughty, very fulfilling, non-strings-attached relationship with a super hot older man and leave it at that.
When he lost everything, Castiel was certain he’d never smile this big again. He’s ecstatic to realize he was wrong. He’s also beyond grateful for Dean respecting his needs, as crazy as they might sound to him and as much as he clearly would like to do otherwise. Castiel’s feeling in control of something for the first time in months, and it is exhilarating.
Castiel hated hearing her cry like that over the phone. He had known that that Carl guy was trouble all along.
“I do, love. I very much do.” Still, he pulls them down until Dean’s ass is bare, while his cock is still mostly clothed.
“So I expected I’d always be the only one kneeling.”
“I really am not,” replies Dean producing a chapstick from his pocket. “But if you wanted to be sure, I wouldn’t be opposed.” Now that’s the Winchester cocky smile Castiel knows. Which means Dean feels insecure and is using it as an armor, like he used to do in high school.
Novak’s a smartass, apparently. That only makes Dean want to fuck him even more.
“Um, no, thanks, Dean. The key part of “one-night stands”,” Cas uses actual air quotes with the same thick fingers he’s used to open Dean’s ass quickly and efficiently so it could take his cock earlier and it’s adorable, “is “one night”,” because one set of air quotes wasn’t enough and clearly a second one was in order. This man goes from sex god to oversized dork in a matter of seconds.
, boyfriend is in the backseat of his beloved car.
They’re not exclusive though, and Dean tells himself that it’s OK, that it’s enough, that the idea that Cas fucks other men too doesn’t slice him open, that if he’s sometimes unable to get hard at all when he gets fucked it’s because the dude he was with didn’t know how to make it good for him, that if he’s unable to sleep in his bed without changing the sheets unless they smell of Cas it’s just because Cas smells really nice and other men don’t.
He needs to stop thinking like that. He must stop letting guilt and insecurity control his reactions instead of being the one to do that, or he’ll screw this up for both of them.
see Cas’s face. He doesn’t need to be reminded of every smile he’s gifted the smarmy kid with, while Dean was sitting next to him, watching the display and feeling mocked and powerless. He needs to lose himself in the rest of his boyfriend’s body, which has always only belonged to him ever since they started dating. His muscled back, his toned arms, his big hands, his broad shoulders, his soft hair smelling of his citrusy shampoo – a scent that makes Dean feel content and calm instantly after so many years – his strong thighs, his round, perfect, tight ass, which always opens up for Dean and welcomes him home.
Once Novak’s on all fours, Dean takes a moment to just look at him and commit every detail to memory. He has a hunch there’ll be other occasions for him to see Novak like this, but this the first time and Dean doesn’t want to forget a single detail.
And that’s the beginning of what becomes their new routine.
The problem is, Dean is not in Samandriel's shoes. Dean is in Dean's shoes. The shoes of a 30 year old man who's recently started to feel not so young anymore, and to second guess his hotness level as a result, who has to sit and watch the admittedly good looking twink waiter of the cafè Cas insists on having breakfast or afternoon tea at
He's so close that it doesn't take more than a few strokes, the perfect combination of the head of Cas's dick brushing against Dean's pleasure spot and Dean's wrist working his own dick and he‘s coming harder than he has in months.
Maybe Dean was intoxicated? He certainly abused alcohol more often than not. Especially when dealing with troublesome events he didn’t think he could fix. He didn’t
Dean loves what they’re doing, loves the idea that they could get caught, that
“Yeah?”
Clearly not a man to waste time or words, Castiel smirked wolfishly, grabbed Dean’s wrist and dragged him toward a table where a group of people were drinking, chatting and laughing. Not sparing a word or a glance for any of them, he grabbed a fucking tax accountant trench coat that was a size too big and in complete contrast with the fashionable and perfectly fitting jeans and t-shirt the man was wearing. Dean’s confusion must have been evident on his face because Castiel asked “Any problems?” with yet another arching of that damn brow, and Dean fucking
“You’re my good boy Cas, aren’t you?”, asked Dean in as sultry a voice as possible.
name.
kept something in. There were more urgent matters at hand. Well, at tongue. There was a good boy to keep satisfied.
Bingo. A blush is already spreading on Dean’s nose and cheeks.
Please enjoy chapter 2 and, when you'll get confused, because you will, remember this: I didn't forget to tag anything, everything is absolutely deliberate and will become clear soon enough :-D
. Yeah, Castiel, you can say I am very happy right now.”
“I am.”
Dean, however, is paying attention.
each other, what they had said to each other, their own fears, their individual personalities, how those personalities were sometimes bent and twisted when it came to the other, the admittedly continuous string of life-altering events they had been forced to deal with, all their mistakes, all their hopes, and dreams. But Castiel wouldn’t be surprised,
‘Stop daydreaming Cassie’, his brother’s voice in his head orders, ‘you have work to do.’
he sounds like a cheap whore, but he just can’t help it, not when Gorgeous is fucking his ass better than anyone ever has in his fucking life and what has Dean even been doing so far, letting men who aren’t
– being inside the ass that belonged to
Dean’s ready to burst and has no shame in getting on his knees, taking himself in hand and stripping his cock hard and fast even though he’s not even sure whether the man is conscious or not, until his come lands all over Novak’s beautiful ass, and the white stands out even more against the fading red that’s still visible.
Dean’s marking his neck and shoulder without restraint while he’s also pushing inside of him at a punishing pace must be sending Cas barreling toward his orgasm, because he sneaks a hand between their bellies and tries to grip his own cock, no doubt to start stroking himself to completion.
You guys, this chapter is loooong. I told you a few chapters back this fic was a mess chapter length-wise. This one got away from me and I ended up with 12K words that I just didn't feel like I could split up. Sorry? 😅
And Castiel could hear him. Perfectly.
and his insecurities and the frustration of the past weeks bubbling up, and he’s powerless to stop them, he doesn’t even want to, because he’s pissed and hurt and logically he knows Cas wouldn’t cheat on him but he has to make sure.
For everyone who'll be here, see you on Sat. For those who won't, thanks again and see you, hopefully, next time!
He was, back at the conference. Dean had almost convinced him with his speech that he had, indeed, changed. For a brief moment Castiel had felt that warm feeling one gets when a wrong has been righted and something that has haunted you for years has finally been put to sleep. Castiel hadn’t imagined it all. It hadn’t been all in his head. Dean
Here it is, guys, the epilogue. I cannot believe I'm about to post this and complete another chaptered fic that got to 50k. I *never* thought I'd write something this long and I'm so happy i did.
. This is where he belongs. Always.
Castiel’s gonna be the best care-giver in the week to come.
Dean‘s aware that he’s not controlling his face and his desire is written all over it, he doesn’t even need to wait for Cas’s smug smile to know that.
“Yeah? You want my cock, Cas?”
The rest of their visit passes by without any more heartfelt confessions. Dean is clearly more relaxed and they enjoy watching all the devices and reading all the cards and posters. The conversation is light and they do banter more than they’ve done so far and before they realize it, they’ve concluded the tour.
The smile Jimmy gives him this time is unmistakable. “Yeah, me too.”
Not thinking about Dean as ‘exceptional’ might be harder than planned, when the man cannot even stop being so
we’re talking, Winchester”, without a hitch. Dean wondered whether the fact that it had been one of Cas’s employees, rather than Cas himself, the one who had served them could have had anything to do with it. That was just ridiculous though. Cas was busy waiting on a table when it was their turn to place their order and things would have been just as fine if he’d been the one to attend to them.
I also wish to thank everyone who's been in touch in whatever form about the first chapter: the love and support really help *so much* when posting a WIP and I'm so thankful for each and every comment, kudo, subscription or bookmark.
Dean refuses to let the atmosphere turn sour though. He wants Jimmy to feel good tonight, not out of place.
These are the reasons why he worked hard to become the CFO of one of the largest companies in the field of renewable energy in the country. Not to be able to get powerful and powerful and parade that power around with his tail fanned. He isn’t interested in displays of power of any kind. He, simply, doesn’t give a rat’s ass about that.
Cas then goes on to tell him that it’s a bit of a teenage dream come true, in fact. When they were in high school, Cas had often daydreamed about Dean choosing him and walking with him in the corridors hand in hand, surrounded by all the people who had always been swooning over Dean, gobsmacked at realizing Dean had chosen Castiel of all people. Dean’s heart breaks a little but then he remembers that, if he won’t truly ever be able to forgive himself, he now has another chance to make it better, to make up for everything he did and to give Cas everything he deserves and more.
Drunk on lust and feeling his own orgasm approaching without a single hand on his cock, just the stimulation the panties at the front and Cas’s cock at the back are providing, Dean can’t help but say “You can get inside now too, just prep me a bit.”
Dean wouldn’t let him down. He only aimed to please, after all.
“And?”
“Mm?” Dean says.
‘Me too,’ Castiel is about to reply. ‘But, no, too soon, can’t say that. A smile will have to do.’
The days when Cas is at the diner in the morning and at the shelter in the evening are always bittersweet to Dean. On the one hand, he’s glad to know Cas is eating something and sleeping in a place which is at least a little less cold, as unpleasant as it might be. On the other, not seeing him for a whole day, sometimes two, always puts a damper on Dean’s mood. When that happens, he always feels guilty because he’s thinking of what
And they are lost into staring and smiling at each other again. Dean really likes it when they do it.
“You want it rough? Hard? Fast?”
A warm feeling spreads through Castiel’s chest and he knows his smile is honest, pleased and wide. “I’m glad you did, Dean. I really am.”
for me. I want the whole club to hear what a slut you are for
Logically, Dean knows all of this, and that's why he shouldn't want to put his hands around Samandriel's throat and squeeze until his eyes roll back in his skull every time he sees the kid.
When she replies “One moment, please” the second time around too, Dean’s fully prepared to hear her voice again telling him why Castiel cannot take the call.
“No need,” Dean replied, “I’ve got my car and we can go to my place?”
, Dean,” Cas says as his mouth starts kissing and nibbling along Dean’s jaw and neck, “I wanna do so many things to you-“
“I couldn’t stop thinking about the theater. How you kissed me, rubbed your hand against my cock.”
If he still had that ability, his arms would be around Maggie right now.
savings now. Which, by definition, he had saved for moments like this. This was Dean. If there was one good reason to give
“Come. I like – shit – being marked with come. Inside and-, out.”
“All of this for me. For free.”
"Not gonna last, sweetheart, your little hole feels too good," and Dean
Like how his instinct to bite and mark Cas every chance he got had slowly but surely turned into an urge to
“You like that?”
,” Cas moans at hearing him say that. Both of Cas’s legs have come to wrap around Dean’s hips in the meantime and his hands scramble to grab Dean’s shoulders now, while Dean redoubles his efforts to fuck and stroke him good so he’ll come, seeing as Dean’s
It’s Friday afternoon, and Castiel’s still in his office, going through some final numbers before he’ll be able to call it a day, and a week. He doesn’t want to have to bring home any work this weekend. He’s told himself it’s because he’s tired and deserves a break, but he’s mature enough to admit it might have more than a little bit to do with Dean. He’s meeting Dean on Sunday afternoon, and he’s afraid he won’t be able to focus on anything else once he leaves the office today.
, “I guess too many emotions. Sorry.”
The sound hadn’t even left his mouth that the perfect vision of his adorable boy was in front of him.
It’s the endearment that does Dean in. And the concern that Cas might have hurt Dean when, in reality, it’s Dean the one who’s been hurting both himself and Cas for fucking months, however unwillingly.
“Would you do me the honor of being my date at the reunion? I can’t wait to see the look of my classmates’ faces when they realize I only have eyes for you, and I tell them that’s nothing new, because it was like that in high school too.”
Dean sashays toward the table a little less elegantly than Castiel knows he’s capable of in his excitement, stops in front of it and bends at the waist, putting his whole upper body on the table top, bends his arms so his hands are, palms down, next to his head, plants his heeled feet solidly against the floor, spreads his legs just that tiny bit that serves to make the view tantalizing, and closes his eyes, sagging in relief. ‘I’m finally where I’m supposed to be,’ his body language seems to be saying, ‘I’ve been good for my Sir and now he’ll take care of me.’
