When Bruce finished cleaning Tony’s neck Bucky got off of the couch and listened as Bruce told him how to take care of the wound, Bucky listened patiently and then helped Tony off of the table where he had to sit as Bruce patched him up.
“Well first off, are you attracted to me?” Steve gaped at that. He was frozen. He felt his face flush so much he felt like he had a fever.
He had originally strayed far from crossing paths with the other occupants of the tower, keeping to his rooms and practicing his magic, but one night Thor came in and all but carried him to the common floor so he could join in on the festivities that Midgardians called ‘Game Night’.
Bucky rubs circles into Steve’s arm, he still hasn’t let go of. “There you go darling, perfect. Are you ok now?” Steve nods but he can feel the body pressed against his tremble slightly, he places a hand on the others jaw and turns his face so he can see. Sure enough there are big tears rolling down the blonde's face from his deep ocean eyes. Bucky kisses the tears away, the salty taste lingering for a while as he wipes the rest away with his thumb that is still on Steve’s jaw.
“Certainly Captain. I will return with much haste.” Thor gave a nod to Steve and then flew off. Steve began calculating the best way to enter when there was the noise of repulsors beside him and Ironman landed next to him. He flipped the HUD up and smiled as he asked
Next, he attempted to move them, it took a little bit to get a hang of it but with a loud "thwap!" They fully spread showing him the undersides in the dim light of his bathroom.
His eyes blurred with tears, He tried to calm himself with the breathing techniques Bruce taught him. Once he was composed again, he decided to risk a look at what the ever loving fuck just happened to his back. His whole body shook with the effort it took to pull himself up, and didn't stop when he saw just what happened to him.
“I don’t know, Doc, sounds kinda fun ta’ me.” Steve didn’t even have to look over to know Bucky was smiling like he always did when he made an inappropriate joke, just waiting for Steve to flush cherry red from his ears to his toes.
“Steve, I will be there right by your side the whole time. If you aren’t ready to tell the world about us I am completely ok with that, and if you are then so am I. Hell, if you want i'll even put it in skywriting,” Steve tilted his head into Tony’s palm and he traced his thumb over Steve’s cheekbone. “I love you and nothing will change that, no matter if the whole world knows or just us.”
He bust in and the first man had finished he was sitting to the side while the second had his turn with Tony. All Steve could hear was the blood rushing in his ears and the echoes of Tony screaming in pain for them to stop. He leaped up into the air and tackled the man that was raping Tony, he smashed the guy's head into the floor until he went still, then he got up to deal with the first guy that was now frantically stuffing himself back into his pants and pulling a gun. He wasn’t faster than Steve on a rampage, though. Steve flew across the room and grabbed the gun out of the man’s hand then he shot him in the thigh. the man sunk to the floor and Steve grabbed him by the throat pulling him back up and then continued until he hung in Steve’s iron grip a few inches off the ground, fingers pulling at Steve’s hand to try to breath.
“If there is a set of Twins born to a king, neither of them are allowed the throne, it is said that they share a soul; a king can't have half a soul, I believe that Nari went looking for the other half of his soul.”
“Ah, hello Captain,” Loki greeted once he made his way up to him, dogging the huge stuffed animals that tried to knock him out of the air. “I see you have changed quite a bit since I last was on Midguard.” the grin on Loki’s face gave him a bad feeling in his gut.
“You seem to be missing one little detail,” Rogers took one hand and ran it across Steven’s Cheek, then jaw line as he spoke directly into Steven’s ear. “We are the same person, yes, it was me there that night, but it was just as much you as me, you know it. Accept that you want it already, it's been what, 90-some years? I know we are stubborn, but why continue like this when it's so good?” Rogers nibbled on Steven’s ear and Steven let out a small whine and slumped back against Rogers. Rogers slipped his hand between Steven’s body and the wall to press the heel of his hand into Steven’s cock where it was leaking against the fabric, Steven groaned and let his head fall back onto Rogers’ shoulder. “There we go, isn’t that better? Just let it all go.” with a quick twist of his hand and a brutal thrust of Rogers’ hips on his back Steven came in his pants and collapsed to the floor in an exhausted heap.
“No, from what I can tell Tony is no larger than a 14 or 15-year-old, given her age she should be larger.” Tony huffed once; she didn’t like the feeling of so many eyes on her chest. ‘Screw it’ she thought before grabbing the hem of her shirt and pulling it over her head.
When he returns Steve is on his back with his head in Tony’s lap as the genius pets his hair, at this point Bucky is surprised that Steve hasn’t started purring or some shit. He lifts Steve’s legs and sits down before laying them back across his lap and starts to give him a foot massage.
He stilled and cupped Steve's ass with a loud groan. “Fuck! Steve, that's so hot, wearing those for me. have you been in those all day? I want to fuck you while you are still in ‘em. Just push them aside and just slip right in.” Bucky wanted to see what all the fuss was about so, in one smooth movement he flipped Steve over onto her back and sat between her splayed legs.
“Ok, let's see what we got.” Tony got a box cutter out and opened the box as Steve watched from atop an overturned beaker that was sitting in the organized clutter. He pulled out a little white shirt and held it up to Steve. Steve gestured to his wings and Tony puts the shirt down. He then pulls out a pair of tiny pants and handed them to Steve who gratefully pulled them on.
“I want Bucky to fuck me while I'm inside of you.” the second he got the sentence out he buried his face in the bed. Bucky and Tony’s eyes connected over Steve's shoulder and they couldn’t hold it in anymore, they just started giggling. In retaliation Steve pressed his cold toes to Bucky causing him to curse under his breath and flinch, Steve whined at Tony without lifting his head from where he was playing ostrich in the covers.
“You see, when my partner designed this, he was looking for a way to enhance the person using animal genes, this however led to side effects in the test subjects, but when the Soldier got his dose, he sprouted wings. We have observed that the Captain had the same reaction, this is because of that pesky Serum they both have, but you… now you get my new and improved version of my partners formula.” with a sneer the scientist gabbed the needle into Tony's leg. The man laughed and then continued his speech. “Since you already act like their little bitch, I have decided to make you one.” after that he and the other Hydra goons left Tony in the room.
“About last night…” Steve was pushed up against Tony from shoulder to hip, he was drawing still, body bent over the page while he worked and pointedly didn’t look up to make eye contact with Tony. Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulder and pulled him closer, Steve was surprised by the sudden movement and his wings flipped up to steady himself and he curled over his page in embarrassment, but he allowed the touch.
“I don’t think it’s anyone's business who I like, we should probably wait until this dies down first before stoking the fire again.”
Steve twisted himself and looked over his shoulder, and yep. Definitely no wings. With everything that changed he hadn’t realized that the constant weight on his back that had been there for the past few months was no longer there.
Stephen had vaguely told them that Thanos would be coming for the Infinity Stones; most of which were on Asgard being guarded by Thor, thankfully. Of the two that remained on earth, however, one was guarded safely while on Stephen's person. The mind stone would be safe in Wakanda, now that Wanda couldn't get to it.
also -- i'm playing 'spot the typo' and cackling at my own negligence. sorry for the inability to type properly.
"You're sure you don't want to get checked out by medical?" The Black Widow asks, just slightly nodding her head in his direction.
"I have some work to do in the garage." Tony tells them, lifting his shoulders in an effort to stretch them out. Both Steve and Natasha turn in his direction, but he turns around and heads towards the side of the house, "Really. Go shower, take up a room for the night. See you tomorrow, maybe."
Steve doesn't say a word as he climbs out, but he returns to Tony's side with his palm splayed out against the small of the brunet's back. Tony wants to say the touch is unnecessary, but knowing Steve's there grounds him in a way he never thought someone else's presence would. They wait as the two other cars pull into the driveway; and with the exception of Natasha, who had once worked for Tony's company, everyone seems as impressed and possibly intimidated as Bucky. Steve, too, seems to be fidgeting in place like he'd never thought he'd be at a place like this.
Unless he wasn't trying to tell him about running Stark Industries. Unless; Howard, in his own tactless, less-than-considerate way wasn't trying to congradulate him but
Tony heaves a sigh, placing his mug down on the counter. He turns around in Steve's arms, politely ignoring the fact that Steve's hips are pressing tightly against his and that the blond's hands are now resting just below his waist. There's the slightest darkening of Steve's eyes that he's just barely able to ignore.
Steve takes a second to think about it. It's a bad idea, of course it is. They've got a bad history, after all; but maybe Sam's got a point. Maybe they do need to talk things through before they can move forward. Everyone turns in Tony's direction to see what he thinks of the suggestion.
And then his phone rings, and Tony is confused as he picks up the flip phone. Steve was just with him, so it made no sense for him to call when he can just pop in at any time, and he'd just spoken to Pepper recently. He hasn't spoken to Rhodey yet, but that's more out of respect because Rhodey was usually run ragged by the Air Force, anyway. Forget Howard, too, because Tony would never be the one to break the stalemate between them. The number's not saved in his contacts, but Tony knows who it belongs to the moment he glances at it. His eyebrows furrow, because it makes very little sense, seeing how he and Howard haven't spoken in years, but he sighs in resignation and hits the answer button anyway.
"The day I met you; when you got into that accident and your car hit the water," Steve begins, moistening his lips, "I thought I was too late. Your skin was turning blue, and your seatbelt wouldn't unfasten. I had to tear you out of the seat, Tony; and I didn't think I'd have enough time."
Stephen's words ring in his ears. If they choose one, they lose the other. It shouldn't be a contest. There shouldn't be a moment's hesitation. And he realizes that maybe that's where his entire relationship with Tony has gone wrong. He shouldn't have to hesitate when it came to his friends. He should've never acted like one was worth more than another.
"Remind me to stop missing you when I don't hear from you in years," he adds, like an afterthought, but his voice is far away as he stares down at an early blueprint of his Jericho missile.
He might as well have said he was the one who killed Howard; even though an investigation was still going on. Everyone stopped to stare at him, and even the bots froze in place.
update : I know I make the characters pro-Wanda to a fault. the unfortunate reality of it is that the avengers always had a blind spot when it came to her. they all treated her like a child who needed guidance. and yeah sure maybe she did need it - but not at the cost of losing trust in each other. if it seems too easy, it’s because it is.
"If it wasn't for me, you probably would be." Tony hears himself say, followed by a self-deprecative peel of laughter.
"You know," Tony begins, and there's not even the slightest twitch of his facial expression, "I'd figure you'd be happier to see the guy that got the Accords repealed."
? Would he really kill Pepper because of them? Because of what they did to him? Because a fight between them took his best friend's life away?
Tony leans in, slow enough for Steve to see it coming, but the alpha just waits with those intense, patient eyes. He's said it repeatedly, that he wouldn't rush Tony or pressure him, and he'd let Tony decide; and Tony decides that for once, he won't run away. At least not tonight, not after Steve has cried
"Excuse me. No." Sam continues, raising a finger and wagging it in Steve's direction and then Tony's, "I'm taking charge of this discussion. You two sit back and speak when it's your turn to do so."
"Okay. Okay, Tones. I have a feeling my arms are going to get ripped off if we don't get the show started." Rhodey groans out, and it's not because Tony's got a grip on him. From the look on his friend's face and the heated stare that's pointed at his back, he'd say it's time to introduce the pack and his mate.
Tony's amused as he checks the message. Steve is sweet and charming but also sassy and petulant. It's a fun combination, he thinks.
"I'm a collector." Tony answers, and he climbs out of the car to avoid hearing whatever else Bucky has to say about them.
He's not surprised when that effectively ends their debate. He knows he's not entirely deserving of their respect considering he had them chased and thrown onto the Raft, but it's a comfort to know that they'd still follow his lead even in a moment like this.
”Do you forget that he went to Siberia in order to kill Steve and James?” Wanda counters, but Steve just stares at her.
Tony wants to say Steve doesn't need him, but in the realm of wolves, an alpha especially needed the comfort of his mate. Some alphas could choose their own mates, they were lucky like that -- but not Steve. Steve had the worst mate in all of existence, a man named Tony Stark who had run away from his fate..
He's not sure how much time passes, but eventually, Tony falls asleep with Steve's fingers carding carefully through his hair.
"Are you okay?" Steve asks, and Tony jerks his head in the direction of the voice to find Steve much closer than he had been. The alpha's face is drawn in concern, and Tony can feel the fingers squeezing against his own.
Bucky smiles, but it's a little, uncertain thing. He's not too crazy about Bucky, but he's grateful to know the truth.
"Fuck. Steve. You don't need a broken old man like me. You can have anyone." He grunts, and he almost manages to push his way out of Steve's grasp, but the tall blond pulls him closer and tightens his grip and Tony almost crumbles against him.
"Fucking coffee snobs." Bucky scoffs, but it sounds more amused than offended as Bucky takes a long sip of his coffee. Cautious, Tony does the same. The silence that falls between them is neither hostile nor amicable; but like they're trying to feel each other out
"I got the particle accelerator running now. Just a few hours more and-" Tony begins, shrugging one shoulder as if he's not impressed with himself.
"You're fucking Captain America." Tony croaks out, and he really should've seen this coming earlier. Steve always went out when the Avengers were called out, and JARVIS never had any reading on his beautiful blond hair when Tony went looking for him.
And then his gauntlets power up and he spreads his hands apart. Everyone knows that move because everyone's seen the Hulk use that move. They might not have similar powers, but knowing that Tony has newfound abilities that put him up to par with Steve and Bucky, there are so many ways this can end up.
The anxiety leaves the room immediately, and though some of them still look at him in concern, Tony just ignores it and crosses the room in Steve's direction. He's planning to sit down on the ground, leaning his side against the recliner because at least sitting beside Steve would help appease his thoughts, but the blond manages to grasp out just before he can pass and pulls him down. Tony's not nearly as graceful as he thinks he is, and now he wonders just how he managed to forget to clean off the motor oil.
Tony's claim isn't entirely fair, of course. If the arc reactor was really keeping him alive at the time, Steve wouldn't have attacked the way he did. But on the other hand, with Tony going for Bucky with everything he had? He could've easily killed either Steve or Bucky and they were the ones that were lucky enough to stop him and get away.
"What are you doing here?" Asks Wanda, cautious and with a hatred that is barely concealed. There's the slightest flicker of red dancing on her finger tips, and while Steve wants to tell her to stand down because Tony isn't their enemy and has never been, he's not sure if he could believe it for himself.
Asleep, Steve looks far younger than he is, his eyebrows resting like there's nary a bad thought drifting through his mind. Tony can't help the little hum of content that passes his lips. Having a mate was never something he imagined he would have, and yet, it felt so
"When did this team fall apart?" Sam asks, and his eyes are closed as he does, "You were all so strong and took on threats together; so you tell me. When did the Avengers stop trusting each other?"
"I didn't do it for you, though I suppose it wouldn't be the worst thing to let you think that." He even talks like Tony does when he's unimpressed, Steve notes; and that little flare up in his chest at the rudeness shown to them when he's the one who brought them there gets shoved back because there's no way of knowing whether or not he's an ally or an enemy yet. The man just turns around where he was and starts heading back in the direction from which he came, "Well, come on now. There's a lot I am responsible for so I can't add you to the list."
"Do you, maybe... want to watch a movie with me?" Steve asks, hope lining his tone even though his eyes are nervously avoiding Tony's. His cheeks are tinted ever so slightly, too, and Tony's heart melts at the sight of it.
"I figured you'd want some time alone after yesterday," Steve says with a shrug, and Tony feels his own shoulders dropping at the tone in his voice. Steve doesn't want to spend time away from him, but even now, he's thinking of Tony's comfort before his own.
Although, if Steve had just wanted a roommate, he could've just asked Bucky. Bucky, who seems to come over every day and spend hours with Steve when Tony was at work. Even when Tony came in at night, the other brunet would still be there, laughing at the Yankees with Steve and offering him a beer like the whole situation was normal.
Rogers sits on the edge of the bed and opens his legs enough so that there is a decent space between them.
He left the bathroom and collapsed onto his bed exhausted from all the pain, work, and quite literal changes to his body. He was unsure if he could sleep on his back so he spread out on his stomach like he had been doing since his back started to hurt and fell asleep, his wings limp and spread out at his sides.
“O-oh, Uuh, Tony. Yes, Yes. Feels so good.” Tony moves his hand upward and Steve begins to pick up speed again. Tony grabs at Steve’s ass again and Steve clenches down around him, a gasp of breath is pushed out of Tony and he pinches the pink bud between his fingers as punishment. He lets go and allows his fingers to map the golden planes of skin before him before he reaches his destination.
“I-I knew it was different back then but I totally forgot about the whole eugenics movement.” They both turned their attention to Steve's pliant body where he was cradled in Bucky’s arms.
It seemed like seconds but at the same time years when Steve came back from the kitchen with a bowl of food for him.
When Steve woke up, he was in a medical bed and he was strapped down with the special magnetic cuffs that Tony had specially designed for Super powered people and Steve had been the test subject for them, so he knew better that to try and get out, it was pointless. He was hooked to and I.V that was dripping something into his veins that felt cooling. As he panned the room, he saw Bucky in a bed next to him, also in cuffs, and it all came back to him what happened. He began to panic, he could have killed Bucky, he sure as hell tried to and Bucky had done the same back (the persistent twinge in his head told him so). The door opened and Bruce entered the room with a disheveled Tony trailing behind him.
They both moaned at the feeling of the others body melding with theirs. Steve is so tight and hot inside; he lets gravity help and soon Tony is bottomed out inside Steve. Steve’s inner muscles clench around Tony’s length and that is all the warning that he got before Steve is pulling almost all the way off of him, leaving only the tip in and then taking Tony fully into him again. That sets the speed for Steve as he fucks himself of Tony’s cock. His head thrown back in ecstasy and moaning as Tony's length rubs against that special place inside, just right.
“Come on Captain, I don’t have all day.” Steve thought about it for a few seconds, and then followed Loki.
“Fenrir is a large black wolf, he has the softest fur. I only remember him as a small pup before Odin gave him to the gods, it was prophesied that Fenrir would kill Odin, but the gods did not want to spill his ‘vile blood’ as they called it on sacred ground. Instead, they placed a sword in his mouth to keep him from biting and locked him in the tomb of ancient warriors. I can hear the echoes of his wounded howl sometimes in my dreams.” Loki glanced down and found Steve silently crying, his tears leaving a wet spot on his shirt.
He blinked back into the room by Steve, took the bracelet off of her and blinked in front of Tony while all three men watched Steve return to his male self. He took the matching bracelet from Tony and slipped it onto his own slender wrist before placing Steve’s on Tony's arm.
The drawing was of a brunet man being fucked by a large, muscular blonde man. The way Steve had drawn them it was more than the normal ones of his, (not including the fact that the normal ones usually only had one man and a woman) the detail of their bodies and the way their skin seemed to glint with sweat. The Brunet was on all fours and had his head thrown back and twisted to allow the blond to kiss the side of his mouth as he pushed into the brunet. They were on a mattress and surrounded by blankets that were bunched up and pushed to the edges of the paper.
“Hmm, kinky. How scandalous of you Rogers.” the second the words left his mouth Tony could tell he should have kept his mouth shut.
“I need some air,” Steve all but jumped up. “Please stay with him?” Bucky nodded and Steve left the room. He rode the elevator to the roof and took a running jump off into the air. He finally felt in control of something, as small as it is, being able to control his body has always made him feel better.
When he raised his head, Bucky was making his way over to the two. He joined the embrace and they shared a kiss over Tony’s head while their wings stretched and covered the small group.
“After Sleipnir I tried to reintegrate myself from the outcast life I had lived. I married my wife, Sigyn and we had the twins, Narfi and Nari. They had me wrapped around their finger. They were so small but they had all the power in the world over me, it is likely that they have no memory of me seeing as they were taken from me very soon after their birth. One of Odin’s bastard sons came and killed Narfi, Nari lived, but Sigyn blamed me for Narfi’s death and left me. Odin decided that I was unable to care for Nari but before he could do anything I transformed him into a Raven and he flew off never to be seen again.”
“I guess I can carry at least your weight while flying.” Steve told him with a grin still on his face.
Tony touched the rag to the top of his wing and pulled it down over the feathers there, Steve’s wings ‘Thwapped’ out fully and almost pulled the rag out of Tony’s hand. Steve flushed and Tony could see as his ears got red. Tony smirked and got to work.
“Stay back.” Tony’s voice is icy but the other him doesn’t even hesitate as he gets closer. Once he is close enough to touch Tony he stops
“Sir, it appears that Mr. Barnes is in distress, I suggest that you wake master rogers and go to comfort him, I believe that it was a nightmare that woke him and the fact that he is alone in a unfamiliar place further strained the situation.” J.A.R.V.I.S sounded worried and that was a lot saying that he was a AI that Tony had programmed when he was in college.
Steve was having a dilemma. He wanted to go out for a run, but couldn't wear shirts anymore, it agitated his feathers and the wings would constantly shift and move to where you could see them. Running a hand through his hair in frustration, he stopped pacing and went over to his closet. he had found a sweatshirt could work to hide the wings with minimal discomfort, but he couldn't go running. he'll just have to find a different way to work out.
“I'm going to try to take down Loki and hopefully that stops the toys.” Steve called to the others who just got there a little after him. Steve took off and made his way up to where Loki was cackling and throwing magic while he floated in front of a large billboard of jeans that made you butt look bigger.
I thought about posting a chapter specifically to celebrate Bucky's birthday (aka birthday sex) but this one was almost done so I decided to finish it up and post it today. as usual tell me what you think in the comments and thanks for reading!
The trance like state Steve was in was broken when Bucky curled over and hacked up blood, Steve’s legs pushed himself forward without his doing and brought him over to the wounded man. He took exactly enough time to breathe once, before he was running his hands over the body before him, looking for injuries and finding a broken rib. As he pulled the leather completely off of the man under him, a metal arm shot out and stopped his wrist, their eyes met and that was when Bucky’s wings unfurled from behind him where they had been pulled tightly around his body by the straps of the vest. They had black on the bottoms and a line of white that ran through the middle but on the joint it was electric blue that faded into black before the white stripe. Steve's wings opened as well and they touched each other, Steve’s were larger and they wrapped around Bucky’s as if to comfort them, when Steve looked back at Bucky there was confusion in his eyes but the tension in his shoulders had lessened so Steve took that as a good sign.
“I’ve never drew myself before, I wouldn’t know where to start, and I hardly think that anyone would want a picture of me,” Steve gestured to his body. Bucky made a thinking face like he was really thinking about it and then replied with that shit-eating smile of his.
His ma, bless her soul, never told him that it was impossible for a sickly Brooklyn boy (not likely to live to 18) to become an artist that made enough money to survive, mainly because to her he could do anything he set his heart to. Even when he was minutes from death, shivering under every blanket they owned (and the curtains for good measure) she talked about how he would be the most famous artist in the world.
When the vial reached Steve, he had no time to catch it and it ended up breaking. the liquid was warm, but did absolutely nothing to him other than creating a damp spot on his uniform. he sighed and placed a finger on his comm to call the rest of the team.
"It lives! Haven't seen you in a while man." Clint is sitting playing (and losing) Mario kart against Nat when they walk through the commons area to get to the lab.
“It’s ok Steve it’s not like I haven’t heard anyone moan before or never had someone pop a boner in front of me, and yes, I know what will happen I’ve given and received massages before and that’s just how the body reacts, it’s not something you need to be embarrassed about.” Steve bobbed his head. Tony took that as an invitation to continue and reached for his back. When he first touched Steve his whole body tightened the muscles under Tony’s hand pulled tight, he gently began to rub back and forth not going too close to the wings.
arms). Bucky kisses Steve like a drowning man taking in a breath of fresh air. he moans into Steve’s mouth and undulated his hips against Steve’s, their half hard dicks rub against each other and Steve bites down on Bucky’s lower lip to stop him from making too much noise.
“Hawkeye and Widow will check the upper floors for any and all information of what is happening and why, me and you will go to the source and is we can shut this thing down.” Tony gave him a mischievous smile and the HUD clicked closed.
“Come on guys let’s go watch Captain America face plant into a mat!” He called over his shoulder following the archer into the elevator.
The other Avengers had cleared out by the time they got up a second time, but just as Steve's toast popped out of the toaster and as he started to scoop the eggs onto his plate Loki popped back into the living room. He was no longer wearing the flashy green and gold armor they had always seen him in but, a blue tunic with delicate carvings in the leather, Steve’s fingers itched for a pencil to sketch.
I can't believe it has been a year since I started writing this fic, I would like to thank all of my readers, whether you have been with me from the start of have just found this, Thank you. without awesome people like you I would have never continued this story. sadly I am planning to wrap this story up soon, but don't worry there is still a bit to go. As a thank you I have written about 1500 words of pure Smut, thanks again for being awesome!
“Fuck! Steve? Steve!?” Tony scrambled up and placed two fingers on Steve’s neck, he let out a sigh in relief when he felt a pulse and the faint gusts of air over his hand where he had checked for breathing. Tony shook Steve’s prone form and tried to wake him up, his wings were crumpled at an odd angle under him and Tony knew that they would hurt like that but he couldn’t pick Steve up.
Suddenly there was a change between her legs. Tony had pulled her panties to the side; he caught her eyes and then dipped his head. She screamed as his talented tongue licked at her folds, and finally,
“You haven’t even seen the main act yet.” Tony purred from his place between Steve’s spread legs, following down as he pulled the panties off and tossed them to Bucky. Steve hummed still half stupid from coming so hard but she reached out to wind her arms around Tony’s neck when he crawled up the bed.
Tony had been sitting there for 3 hours. He had gotten up and waited for Steve to come up from his daily run, but the soldier was nowhere to be found
“I wanna see you, wanna kiss you.” Bucky leaned over from where he was standing and captured Steve’s mouth in a filthy kiss before he pulled away and grabbed the pot of Vaseline and handed it to Steve before he laid out on the cot and opened his legs for Steve to fit between. Steve crawled his way between Buck’s legs and kissed him before he worked his way slowly down the others body, worshiping him and kissing every part he could reach. Bucky had one hand tangled in Steve’s hair and the other in the scratchy blanket under him as Steve licked and sucked his way down Bucky’s body.
“There is a back entrance and a stairway on the roof that only has a padlock. Scans say that there aren’t any high-tech security measures inside but the source of the gas is in the 3rd sub basement.”
He flushed and rubbed at the nape of his neck with his right hand and his right wing raised as well, she grinned at him. “it, um holds them so I don’t rip my shirts like when I showed you guys.” his flush deepens remembering that particular day.
“We won’t do a bikini wax today or anything like that, you just need to get some clothes that fit you, you don’t expect to walk around with your nipples poking a hole through one of Bucky’s shirts all day, do you?” Steve blushed and shook her head at Natasha’s implication. She began to lift the hem of the shirt when pepper said to wait.
When they arrived back at the penthouse Tony was pacing a track in front of the couch. His head shot up when they entered and he leapt into Steve’s arms, Steve hesitated for a second but then wrapped his arms around Tony’s back, pulling him close.
All the while Tony had J.A.R.V.I.S running scans on every CCTV camera, phone, laptop, and satellite active for any evidence of a 100-year-old supposedly dead POW who served in WWII with Tony’s boyfriend who also had wings, god his life was weird.
“What-” Tony’s confusion showed in his voice and Bucky wanted to go over and comfort him, but he had to deal with the droopy-feathered idiot in front of him first.
I thinking of having a reveal to the team in the next chapter, who do you think will be the most surprised? who won't? will there be bets won or lost? by who? tell me what you think.
“SHIT!” Steve woke with a start at the curse Tony let out. he had burnt his finger yet again. The communicator was too small for Tony to work on without hurting himself. Steve got up and placed a hand on Tony's finger to stop him.
"Oh, OH! Sorry Steve I didn't even think about presenting, that must be uncomfortable and I have the scans, you can put them down now." Bruce's voice got gentle and Steve drew his wings in until they were safely plastered to his back, he was nervously shifting his weight from one foot to another.
When another 15 minutes passed, they had been tied together for thirty minutes. Tony’s stomach was swollen with the amount of cum filling him.
Once Tony caught his breath, he smirked and gave Rogers one of his patented quips that usually got him punched or fucked (and he really hoped it was the latter).
“Steve I. Am. Fine. Ok? You are such a hypocrite, why aren’t you being fussed at too?” Tony had his arms crossed petulantly over his chest as Bruce cleaned the wound on his neck and made sure he was ok.
“It looks like you have some damaged feathers that need to be pulled do you think that you can do it or would you rather have Steve or I help you?” Tony looked over at Steve and caught his eye before returned his gaze to the plates that were crushing Bucky’s feathers. Steve looked like he was going to be sick.
“What is it Natalia?” Bucky stayed where he was reading a book on his couch as she exited her hiding place in the shadows.
His wings were moderately sized, not likely big enough to get him off the ground, and almost purely white like the Angels he saw in church, but the undersides were golden. The lights reflected off the feathers, making them appear to be made of molten gold. He was mesmerized, and just stood there for a while and starred while moving them this way and that
“Awe, come on Stevie, you don’t want my ugly mug takin’ up space in there, how's about you do a drawin’ of you, that way I can have one of you instead of one of me.” Steve looks perplexed and stares at Bucky until he asks “what's got you making that face for? If you aren't careful it'll stick that way.”
“I was reading that.” his tone is annoyed but he knows that she can tell what he is really thinking.
A few days after the settled into the apartment, Tony entered off of the elevator with a short curly haired man who wore glasses and spoke in soft tones. Bucky found that he could trust this man like he had come to trust Tony. The man, Bruce was his name, wanted to do some medical tests to see how he was doing. Bucky was hesitant at first but Tony said that he would be there and he wouldn’t let Bruce do anything to him that was bad. First Bruce took a blood sample to see if he could do anything with the serum, he had been unsuccessful with Steve but, he thought that maybe the knock-off serum they gave Bucky may be the key to his research. While he ran the blood, he also did a drug test to see what Hydra had been giving him and if he would need to be weaned from any drugs that could cause withdrawal symptoms. When he got the read out his heart nearly stopped, he could feel the other guy get restless and he could see that his complexion had a tint of green from his reflection in the polished metal surface of the lab table, he took a few deep breaths and spoke to the room at large but, specifically at Tony for the other scientist's recommendation and understanding of the situation.
Tony and Bucky stood there for a while as Tony watched over Bucky’s shoulder as Loki fluttered around Steve’s bedside and Bruce did some tests. Every now and then Loki would pop out of reality and return with some odd plant or animal carcass looking thing which he added to the crystal bowl that he conjured along with about 40 books that were covered with strange symbols instead of words.
The soldier was hooked to an I.V and a monitor that showed his heart rate, oxygen, and blood pressure, all of which were normal. When he further inspected his body he found that he was in a medical gown, all his belongings had been taken or left behind. His wings were folded behind him and the joints were pulled to his body by a wrapping of gauze around his ribs. He carefully unwound the gauze and stretched his wings to make sure everything was functional and he could have a fast get away if needed. When he shifted his body to get out of the bed the man woke up. They just stared at each other for a while before the man spoke.
The sleeves were a soft grey color but the centerpiece of the shirt was a light blue that worked with the blue of her eyes, the shirt accented her curves and the dark black of the leggings paired nicely with the soft tones of the shirt.
Tony woke up in the large empty room that he had passed out in but he was no longer strapped to the thing and he was alone. Glancing around his eyes caught a blanket in the corner and in the other was a toilet and a sink, he sat up and instantly regretted it.
“G-good, smell good. Wan-want you.” suddenly there was a wet tongue sliding up the side of his neck and when Steve got to Tonys jaw he nuzzled the bone with his nose for a minute before he started mouthing at the skin more and more until Tony was sure that there would be a mark left.
Steve came to on a bed in the medical floor, his head was throbbing and his body felt weird. His chest was heavy and his pants felt tight in the hips and baggy in the front.
"What can I do for you Steve?" Bruce's voice pulled him out of his head and back to the problem at hand.
They moved forward and both gave Nat and Pepper kisses on the cheek respectively before the impatient look on Bucky's face broke them apart and they opened the back door to let him see Steve.
“imagine the sex!” Tony's face lit up with an idea. That pulled a reaction out of Steve. His whole body turned red and he pulled both his wings around his tiny body. “I could rim you and blow you at the same time.” Tony had that look on his face, Steve started to back away but had nowhere to go, he couldn’t fly with his wings wrapped around his body. In the blink of an eye, Tony lunged for Steve and Steve in panic opened his wings on instinct to look bigger. bad choice. Tony pinned him down with one finger to his chest and his wings were trapped beneath him, leaving his aching cock completely in Tony’s view.
“Steve,” Tony laid a hand on Steve’s shoulder and pushed so he would face him, Steve could easily overpower Tony and not turn, but he allowed his body to be manipulated.
"Wow" a blush was crawling its way down Steve's back at Bruce's exclamation. He also strangely felt super exposed and it made his cock twitch in his pants.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice wavered. Tony looked up into his scared blue eyes. “I-I think I’m... stuck.” Steve was looking down at where they were connected and tried to pull away again. No luck. Steve started to panic again, His breath caught in his chest.
“There is something that didn’t shift with the rest of you,” Loki had saddled up next to where Steve was standing and was speaking low enough that the others couldn’t hear what he was saying, a bolt of fear went through Steve's gut at the implication that something was wrong but he appreciated the discretion that Loki was taking. “I wouldn't want to worry your lovers, and Seeing as you appear to be fine I will allow you to go but come to my quarters at your earliest convenience so I can figure out what happened.” Steve nodded to Loki and glanced back at Bucky and Tony, without turning his head to look at Loki he spoke to the god.
On the way down to Steve’s floor Tony's mind is racing 10x faster than it normally is. He kind of knows what to expect, From what he can deduce Steve has extra appendages growing out of his back, but they can’t be that major if he could hide them under his shirts (in his panic Tony had forgotten about the 20ft comments from the jet he overheard). his stomach is in knots when he finally arrives and knocks on Steve’s door.
When he regained consciousness, his back ached like when he was 100 lbs soaking wet, with a list of diseases a mile long, including scoliosis. For a second his heart stopped. Had the vial that was thrown at him take the serum away? was he back to that frail body he hadn't had since the 1930s? A quick look at his abs told him no, So then why does his back hurt so much?
“I'm not going to touch yet, I'll tell you when I do but, first I want to look and see if you have any feathers that are out of place or damaged that I need to take care of. can you open your right wing for me?” Bucky relaxed slightly but still remained tense as he slowly removed his wing from its place pulled flush to his back. The wing was obviously dirty, but it looked ok, and once it was cleaned and oiled Tony thought that it would look Beautiful, the Blue and black contrasted with cream stripe that would become pure white when clean.
“What you are going to do is go and get your suit on and fly to the base where they are holding Tony, me and the rest of the team will follow as fast as we can on the quinjet.” Steve sent Bucky a sad glance at his injured wing as he left the workshop to get his suit, his own wings were dragging on the floor as he left, Bucky shook his head and called after the dope.
“N-no, no one's ever touched me with good intentions on the reactor before, it’s hideous.” Tony turned his face away from Steve’s eyes, those clear blue pools could see directly into his soul. Steve’s hand held onto the back of his neck and he leaned over to kiss away the tears on his face.
When Tony’s ass felt close to normal Rogers had him stand again and he watched a Rogers stood too. He stepped away from the bed a bit and started pulling his pants down and letting his erection hand hot and hard between his legs.
The sound of pounding feet on the specially made treadmill that Tony outfitted so it wouldn’t break after a few hundred miles filled his ears as he ran and had been running for some time he was just running for fun, so it was slower than he normally could go, but he was pretty sure he had run about a marathon or two by the time he stepped off and made his way to the showers to wash up and then grab a snack before he went back to his floor and in his room (and no, he wasn’t being a coward, he was making a strategic retreat from the whole ‘Rogers’ situation).
“I’m guessing that you don’t have any panties under there do you?” Steve shook her head again and felt the blush burn across her face again. “I’m guessing that you'd rather spend the least amount of time fully naked so let's pick some out before you get to trying on other stuff.”
“We don’t have to talk about it yet. Bucky did clarify some things after you fell asleep so I know some of the reason why you might feel this way, but if you want to not talk about it now or even if you just want to talk with Bucky and not me I understand.” Steve looked up finally at Tony and made eye contact for the first time.
“What was that for?” Tony had the cute confused look on his face that he gets when one of his creations shorts out and he had absolutely no idea why.
Tony, now knowing why Rogers left a deliberate space so that Tony could get no relief from his throbbing cock, drapes himself over Rogers’ lap.
As Rogers worked the lotion into his ass and thighs, he said low words of praise about ‘how good Tony did’ and that he ‘deserved his reward’.
"Master Rogers is on his floor. I do not believe him to be leaving his level any time today or for the foreseeable future." Alarms went off in Tony's brain. Steve never skipped his runs or working out in the gym.
They curled up together, Steve in the middle with Tony and Bucky’s arms wrapped around his waist and then Bucky’s large right wing draped over both of his lovers
Steve just stood there for a minute trying to figure out what just happened. he stared at the vacant spot on the floor that Bucky had just occupied, as he went over the last 20 seconds in his mind again.
"Um, ok. So, something happened during the battle at the A.I.M lab that I was helping him with, and I may have said something, and he kind of had a panic attack and won't get down from Clint's nest in my lab."
“Nothing other than my soggy boots. Let's get a sample of that stuff for Bruce and get out of here, do you have all the files?” Tony nodded and then he took a container out of the compartment in the thigh of the suit and scooped some of the slime up, carefully capping it and putting it back in the suit.
They had all decided to continue the conversation on the common floor and off of the roof of the tower, it was a rather awkward elevator ride nonetheless, but once everyone took their spots in the common area they began to settle. Clint and Peter were sitting on the love seat to the side, Bruce was in his armchair, Steve, Bucky, and Tony were on the couch and Thor was standing as well as Loki. Thor looked around and sat Mjolnir on the carpet next to a stray bean bag left out from Clint’s gaming and he plopped down. Loki rolled his eyes and magicked a golden chair for himself and sat.
“Thank you for telling me, I know it must be hard with the memories, but every moment that you get back is a victory over those at HYDRA that tried to take them away from you.” Bruce said. he decided that this part of the exam was over and moved on to the next part, the wings. They lead Bucky to the gym so that he can spread out his wings fully and get proper measurements as well as some flight tests, even though they know he can fly, Bruce wants to see if the metal arm weighs him down on one side.
Rogers shifts his arm and lifts Steven’s leg so it is straight up in the air and then settles it on Tony’s shoulder and at the same time his hips move double-time, Tony thought that his already fast pace was the serums doing but it is nothing compares to the speed and strength behind him now.
Tony has a tendency to bottle everything up and shove it deep down, which would boil up again and overflow, manifesting in long rants and tirades about everything that has bothered him in the past months. This time though, this time it hasn’t been festering, Tony hasn’t been able to calm the screaming in his head by pushing it away, this time he was actually letting everything out.
she sat up and stretched, then wincing at the fabric digging into her she took off her shirt and then her bra, she let out a sigh of relief when the constricting fabric was no longer around her body. She felt a hand on her back and turned to see that Bucky had his eyes peaked open.
“Deep breaths, Steve. I'll be right there beside you.” Tony was behind him, rubbing the space between his shoulder blades. The muscles relaxed under the attention and his wings lowered. Steve blushed, not realizing that his feathers were puffed up like a scared owl and his wings were almost fully encircling him, hiding him from the world.
Nat and Pepper both walked over to a dresser and opened a couple of drawers and whispered to themselves for a while before turning around with a couple scraps of fabric in their hands.
“I thought the future would be better, that the prejudice would be gone. Honestly, I could care less about what J Jonah Jameson has to say about me, but to say hero or mutant like somehow being mutant is inherently evil, it disgusts me to see that America hasn’t gotten any better, it just shifted the blame onto someone else.” Steve looks down at where his hands are folded together on the table in front of him. Tony moves behind the chair and wraps his arms around Steve’s neck in a back hug, his hands hold on to Steve’s as his chest presses into the downy feathers and he places his forehead on the back of his neck.
He took and wrung out a cloth, then gently spread it over the inside of the feathers at the bottom and worked his way up, meticulously wiping every single feather until it was gleaming. He then moved on to the next wing, when he finished that he had a little problem, He couldn't reach the backs. He shuddered at the thought of not cleaning the backs, which were probably the worst, and the feathers that were out of place kind of hurt. He thought of asking someone for help, but who? Nat? No. Clint? Definitely not. Tony? No, he couldn't tell Tony, and he probably wouldn't survive him, or anyone else for that matter, touching his wings. He wasn't sure his back would be in the best shape for a shower, but that will have to do. He should probably clean up the bathroom first. He folded his wings to his back and got up, put the towels away, emptied the now, red-tinted water out and went to work on the bathroom.
“Tony?” he roused the exhausted genius. Big brown doe eyes fluttered open and caught his. “Is it okay if Bruce and Bucky come to help us?” Steve didn’t think Tony was in any state of mind to make decisions right now but with what had happened Tony likely hadn't had a choice of his own in a while so he would only let them see him if Tony allowed it. Tony shrugged his shoulders and then nodded his head where it was leaned against Steve's chest, right over his heart, no doubt listening to the steady beat like he liked to do when they were curled up in bed at night.
“Jarvis can you give me Steve’s location?” Tony asked, he had put trackers in all the team's new suits and could get their stats as well.
“It's yours,” Steve’s voice is small but both men hear, Bucky is the one to ask the question that is going through both his and Tony’s minds.
Steve was ushered off of the elevator and into Nat’s floor, then she was led to the huge walk-in closet that housed most if not all of Natasha’s spy clothes. She had every style and look imaginable.
His wispy blond hair moved slightly in the breeze from the open window, his hands were stained with charcoal and ink and whatever else Steve had used today to draw. Long fingers made elegant swooping lines on the page as he scowled at the drawing in front of him, he turned his head to look at it from a different angle, his tongue poking out the side of his mouth and his hair flopped into his eyes, he grumbled and blew it out of his eyes and in the process caught Bucky standing by the door.

The three of them left the warehouse behind them and went back to the tower, after Clint detonate the explosives that he had placed throughout the building and everyone watched at the warehouse crumbled and caught on flames.
“Can't wait to be inside you Stevie, to stretch your hole with my knot and full you full of my come while you are buried balls deep in Tony.” Steve moaned and pushed back into the cradle of Bucky’s hips encouraging him to continue rocking against his back. Tony finished preparing himself and turned back to Steve with the lube in his hand.
"I had a headache, I never have headaches. Not since the serum." Steve's voice was strained "maybe I should have talked to you yesterday."
"Ok Steve, I'm just going to go behind you and examine the structures and feathers." Bruce calmly explained what he was doing as he walked around Steve, mindful of the section of wing that were settled on the ground.
“A group of Hydra agents popped up in new jersey a few weeks ago, we sent in an undercover agent but they failed to report back, then when we went to investigate the base was giving off large amounts of unknown material in the form of gas.” Hill told the entire team. “We are unsure if the gas is dangerous or not so we recommend everyone put on the hazmat suits.” the screen blinked away and there was a collective groan from the entire jet.
“Bed.” Tony was able to gasp out between kisses. Steve adjusted his arm under Tony’s bottom and while still kissing him, he walked them to the elevator. The elevator took them to Steve’s floor where they stumbled into his room clothing was lost along the way, both still had their pants on and Steve still had his harness on when they reached the bed. Steve set Tony on the bed and then crawled over him to meet the others lips again, kissing him with even more passion than before, if that was possible. Tony pushed his leg between Steve’s and used his thigh to rub at the impressive tent in his pants.
“I should be thanking you Captain, you will now become the fist of Hydra, too bad we didn't get to test it out on someone else.” the man shrugs and hits some buttons and the machine creates a large whirring sound.
Steve felt a shiver go down his spine, he would likely die and the baby if it didn’t die with him would be without a... mother?... Father? They would be all alone.
“Come here, lay over my lap. You are not allowed to get any friction during your punishment, do you understand?”
“Sorry.” he said, it was so quiet that no human would be able to hear it, he backed away from the door. His heart was in his throat and the only thing he could hear was the pounding of it. Which is probably why he didn’t hear Tony’s frantic scrambling to get up, and in the process he fell from the bed, so he could throw the door open.
“The fuck are you talking about? Your rooms? I'll show my foot to your ass, get the hell out of my tower!” Loki grinned and magicked himself a chair to sit in.
“Nat, leave me to wallow by myself.” Steve felt tears prickle at the edges of his eyes just from hearing Tony’s voice.
“Hey Buck,” Steve’s eyes lit up at the sight of Bucky and he put his page down on the ancient table. “Is it that late already? Sorry I don’t have anything’ ready, I got another request from Mr. Williams. Five whole dollars for it!”
“It's no problem, don’t want you it fall and can't get up.” Tony chuckled and Steven didn’t understand but guessed that it was another reference that he didn’t understand.
It is like reflex or maybe instinct for Steve to fully expand his semi-open wings, he feels like his brain is not his anymore, like he is just a spectator as his body does what it wants without his say. Steve beats at the air one, two, three times and then settles and watches Bucky’s every move. Bucky waits for some invisible queue and jumps into action, literally, he uses his speed and agility to his advantage over Steve's power and size. He quickly had Steve pinned under him, his wings are up still but he had his joints tilted down pinning Steve’s wings to the floor. Steve uses his wings under him to his advantage and rolls Bucky off of him. Bucky is fast to get up so Steve uses his wings to jab at Bucky and get Bucky under him on the floor like he just was.
“Jarvis give me a scan of these so called shrink rays.” when Tony asked a scan popped up on the H.U.D. The quinjet landed in a nearby clearing, the team filed out and started to take down the Hydra agents stationed around the park.
"My body. I..I'm not me, I thought I could help people if I could breathe on my own and wasn't constantly sick, always a burden to everyone around me so I signed up and joined the war. I did, I helped people saved lives but that wasn't me, it was The Captain who did it. I'm just some kid from Brooklyn who was never supposed to live past 15. I decided if I was going to go out I wanted to have a chance to make a difference," Steve's breath hitched again, but he gets it under control and continues. "then THIS happens and another piece of me is not ME. sometimes I just want to be that kid from Brooklyn again 5'5 and 100 lbs, no one looked his way, they didn't expect anything from him. I'm not him anymore, and this body isn't mine." Tony was speechless, tried to gather his thoughts.
here is the links to some of the pictures i worked off of for the clothes Steve wore in this chapter. sadly i couldn't find any red panties that have a arc reactor and the words 'Stark Naked' on the butt.
Bucky opened and closed his mouth a few times, still red with blood, before he slowly spoke in a weak croaking voice.
“The next issue is your name and pronouns.” Tony took the pause in the conversation to bring up an actual issue and give looks at both Steve and Bucky for getting off topic. “We can obviously call you Steve even in this body but would it be ok to use she/her to reference you so we can distinguish between the two or would you rather continue He/Him. Obviously going out in public will be a different situation but that is another conversation entirely.”
Steve snaked one hand down and took Bucky in her hand, she jacked him off in time with Tony’s brutal pace. She could tell that both of them were close and she could tell that she was as well, with a well-timed press of her thumb to the sensitive glands on Bucky’s cock he shot off, painting Steve’s hand with his cum. As she Stroked him through his climax Tony moved and made her see stars, Steve came for the second time that night, Tony’s name falling from her mouth. A few thrusts later she felt Tony bury himself in her one last time and paint her insides with his release.
"I'm on it Captain" the robotic voice hovering above him came from the speakers on the mark 38. A piercing high pitched whine from the repulsors caught the Captain's ears and then the two drones that were about to attack while his back was turned were disintegrated. Meanwhile he threw his shield, it ricocheted off the last three drones and came back to him.
“Jarvis turn it off,” Tony already had his phone out and was pacing as he typed on it, so fast his thumbs were a blur.
"it’s up to you Steve, it affects you more. Everyone already knows about my sexuality, but when it gets out that Captain America is gay it's going to be a disaster.”
The next morning the three went down to the lab so Burce could tell them if Steve could take off the bracelet and be his winged self again.
“I’m sorry, I cannot believe the grief you must have felt. I just found out that I am pregnant,” Steve moved a hand to lay over his stomach protectively, “and I already feel as if it would kill me if anything happened to them.” Loki laid his palm over Steve’s on his stomach, Steve felt the warm tingle of Loki’s magic and saw the green swirls float between their fingers.
Their scientific mutterings were interrupted by a hitched breath they both turned and saw Bucky was curled up on himself again, he had his wings plastered to his back so tightly you could see that they were shaking with the effort his muscles used to keep them close to his body, which was wracking with his silent sobs and effort to calm his frantic breathing. Tony immediately moved to action with Bruce but he worked opposite of Bruce, while the scientist took a look at what had happened and getting a reading on blood pressure, oxygen levels, heart rate, all that good stuff. Tony worked to calm Bucky down he made sure that Bucky could see him at all times and he made eye contact and asked before he touched him. Tony knew what this was, he had suffered enough panic attacks to see the symptoms. He continued to soothe Bucky and he told him where he was and what year it was along with the fact that he was safe, Tony had created a protocol for J.A.R.V.I.S to relay the same information when he would wake up from a nightmare or had an attack, he would have to enact the protocol on Bucky's floor in case this happened while Tony or the others weren’t around and couldn’t help.
"What's presenting?" Steve asked the floor with the same small voice from before, it made Bruce smile a little at how such a strong man who was Captain America could look so small, he mentally scolded himself, this wasn't Captain America, this is a 25-year-old who was shoved into the present world.
Bucky stepped back into Steve’s space and gave him a hard look. “Spill it, what happened while you were gone.”
"Ugh, what am I going to do?" He backed up and slid down the wall to sit on the floor. That, was a bad choice. Pain shot through his body, his muscles pulled taut with the effort it took not to scream.
“Don’t worry about it, a few more shifts at the docks won't kill me, and it is worth it if I get to see you so happy.” Steve kept slowly petting the cover of the sketchbook and staring at it in wonder.
Green engulfed both Tony and then Steve. It didn’t hurt like it did the first time, it was more of an all over heat to his skin. The green leaked away and Tony stirred on the bed. Steve and Bucky pushed forward in time for those big doe eyes to flutter open. His forehead creased in confusion, but then he brought his hand up and took off the oxygen mask.
Steve thought for a second thinking about being called she and her, he found that it didn’t bother him in his mind, and it would make it easier on everyone.
“Steve, nothing is going to happen, we will still be here when you tell us and we won’t leave your side.” Tony held Steve’s hand as he spoke and Steve nodded in response to the others words. He knew deep down that they would never leave him. Hell, they might even be happy.
“If I may, Master Rogers is now awake.” Jarvis interrupted the Russian soaps Nat was watching With his update. She nodded to the camera in the corner and made her way to the elevator which was already waiting to take her to her destination, regardless of what Steve says.
“No, not really. They tend to just do what they want. That’s why I need the harness I’ve shredded quite a few shirts. Now I’ll need to get another before I can go out again.” Steve trailed off, his features pulled together in thought.
“Now, you go get some sleep. I'll wake you if Steve comes up.” she got Tony up and then helped him into bed before she went to her floor.
“sorry, I was a little preoccupied.” he said still staring lovingly where his finger was in the now, lukewarm water.
They were all worked up that it didn’t last nearly as long as they usually go, but when Tony felt the beginnings of Steve’s knot pushing at his entrance, he knew that this was going to be interesting. Even for him taking the knot was a little weird, don't get him wrong, he loved it but it wasn’t something to start with, which was exactly what Steve was doing. Between the grunts and moans coming from Steve, Tony could tell that Bucky’s knot was starting too, Steve opened his eyes and looked at Tony with lust, yes, but anxiety too.
“Ok.” Tony climbed up onto the bed behind Steve. Steve’s wings began to stretch out his wings. Tony watched in fascination as the feathers spread, silently moving over each other, before his eyes.
“I have a lock on his location, but the sensors are not able to pick up any stats.” Jarvis's normally clear tone was muddled with worry. Tony shot off to where Steve’s suit was sending a signal from. Tony landed in a group of trees there was evidence of a struggle and Steve’s shield was laying on the ground next to the suit, just the suit. Steve wasn’t in it. Was he running around naked without his shield? No, Steve would NEVER leave his shield by choice. Something happened to him. Tony's stomach twisted in his gut.
It had been a week since Steve had broken down in the lab, he felt better and now, with the harness he could leave his apartment but still couldn’t train or even wear his suit. SHIELD was starting to get mad that Captain America hadn’t been fighting in almost a month.
“I couldn’t do it without you, you are so much better that what you give yourself credit for, Tony. You are one hundred times nicer and kinder than you let anyone see, you are a brilliant man, so much more that Howard ever was.” Tony flinched at Howard's name, Steve knew that his friend hadn’t had the best dad in the world, and Steve would do anything if he could just go back in time and sock him right in the mouth.Tony smiled at Steve, that self-deprecating look that said that he was nothing and that Steve is ‘too good’ for him.
Loki gathered up Steve in his arms and ran a hand through the man's hair while the other held him close while rubbing circles on his back, without realizing it, he had started humming an old melody that he could never quite remember where he had heard it from. Steve remained in Loki’s lap while he cried into the others shoulder, his fists were now bunched in Loki's shirt, but he was starting to relax so Loki continued with the ancient song as he pulled his fingers through hair the color of golden wheat.
Jarvis did just that and soon there was a holographic bust to Tony floating on the screen, Bruce and Tony huddled around it. They examined it every which way and murmured back and forth, even with the super hearing the words made no sense to any other person in the lab (apparently all-speak can’t translate Science either).
Rogers looked at him for a little while after Tony finished undressing, eyes tracing the lines of his body, small but strong, thin wires of corded muscle wrapped around Tony’s body, his tan skin like planes of gold over his compact form.
please let me know what you guys think of the story in the comments and ill try to ether get back to you or add in something you want to see. thanks for reading and enjoy!
“Hey,” Tony brought his hands up to hold Steve’s face. “It’s ok Steve, remember how to breathe.” He took Steve’s hand and placed it over the reactor to let Steve feel his chest expand and contract. “come on, breathe with me.” Once he had Steve calmed down, he could start to figure out what was happening.
Steve was taking everything so hard especially since he found out about Bucky, he blamed himself for everything and wouldn’t hear otherwise. He was spending a lot of time in the gym ether perched as high up as he could get, hiding from everything, or beating the crap out of some poor defenseless punching bags.
“Steve!” Steve jerked back at the sudden exclamation but at the look of wonder and curiosity on Tony’s face he calmed. “You don’t have wings!”
I wasn't exactly sure how fast to have Steve fly so I estimated but if you have a better idea or would like to suggest something that I could change it to please comment also the wings bucky has are from a Black throated blue warbler
“Hey cap, I was just about to go looking for you. I had something I want to talk with you about.” Steve’s heart started to race. Had Tony noticed how he felt about him? Was he mad?
"That's the oil gland," Bruce said as he gently massaged the gland and more oil was released a warm scent filled the air it wasn't bad it smelled like home to Steve. Safe.
“OK, there are a few feathers that are slightly out of place so I am going to fix them, is that ok?” Bucky inhaled shakily but dipped his head and held his wing perfectly still, he flinched slightly when Tony’s fingers first made contact with his wing, but held still, all while Tony corrected the feathers that had been out of place for who knew how long. Tony could tell that they had been hurting Bucky because as he moved them into place Bucky’s shoulders trembled slightly and he looked like a weight had been lifted from him. “There, that's better. now, can you open the left wing for me, you can let the right one rest if you want.” Bucky lowered his right wing to the bedspread and opened his left wing with more confidence this time, but he didn’t open it all the way and when Tony was going to ask him to do so, he noticed that the plates of the metal arm had snagged at the under feathers of the joint and were bent and mangled. Tony had to physically keep himself from gasping out, Steve cried for a good fifteen minutes after a mission where he had to pull out one of his feathers that had gotten too damaged, Tony couldn’t imagine the sort of agony that Bucky must be in, or for how long he had been this way.
Tony listened to Steve and Bucky talk. They all needed to be there for this but Tony had no place in the feelings Steve was having with Bucky at the moment so he just sat back and tapped away at some designs on his tablet.
"He doesn't have to be here, he can talk through Jarvis, like when he's on a trip?" There was a moment of silence and a broken 'yes' could be heard from the winged man.
“Bu-but I-I thought that I couldn't have a child like this,” Steve gestured to his body as a whole, “That's why you got us the bracelets. Oh my god! I'm pregnant… oh- wha-what am I going to do!” Steve was hyperventilating now. His chest heaving and his fist rubbing the soft fur under him in an unconscious effort to soothe himself. Loki, despite his outward appearance was rather good with calming people down, there were multiple times is his memory of being handed a child that was wailing only for it to quiet after the first pass of his hand through their hair.
Steve doesn't even flinch as he pulls back the tape and gauze from his neck and inspects the wound, Interesting, it is scared over just like Tony’s, normally the next morning after a wound like that there wouldn’t be a mark left, Bucky hummed low in his chest and he knew that Steve heard him but he had apparently decided to be mute so he said nothing. Bucky continued to wipe away at the area and then dab it dry with new gauze before he got up.
"That's not really helping me Bruce, I need more info for one thing. what did you say, and what the ever loving
It took him a little over an hour to arrive at the abandoned warehouse where Tony was being kept. He stayed low as he got close and dropped into an alley nearby so he wouldn’t be spotted in the air. He walked the rest of the way to the building and when he spotted cameras posted at the door he went around the side and flew himself up to the roof. He found some skylights and luckily one was open. He checked inside and when he found the hallway empty, he lowered himself in.
"Everyone down!" Steve shouts, and his voice carries over the shattering of the glass. The team follows suit, but only for a short moment until they gather themselves.
He can't help the chuckle that passes his lips. He can just imagine the look on Steve's face, and it causes the jealousy that was there to be completely replaced by adoration.
"Tony, that's not fair." Natasha tries, her expression stern but her voice cracking ever so slightly because she had only ever wanted to keep the one family she's ever known together.
Clint is pressed against the wall, acting like he's some sort of spy and he can listen in through it. Sam is hiding a nasty grin with his hand, even though they all know he's going to be teasing Bucky the moment he steps out of the kitchen. Thor looks as joyfully lost as he usually does, but Steve knows better; while Thor seems unassuming, he's actually a fierce warrior and a brilliant tactican in his own right. Bruce doesn't seem as interested as the rest, but he follows the crowd purely out of boredom. Natasha turns away from the commotion, but it's simply a ruse because she can easily get Bucky to vent to her later, and Wanda is just giggling along because she loves the 'true love' 'one and only' trope.
It's a joke and accompanied by a laugh that's entirely too forced. He turns to Steve, noting the vulnerability Steve's always trying so hard to hold back.
Stephen shifts forward in his chair again as soon as they disappear through the portal, and he's frowning so deeply his entire face seems to sink in, "This will complicate things if we don't move quickly."
The group disperses quickly, and Tony stares at their fading backs wondering if he can subtly leave before Steve can throw a punch.
"Do you want a stage or something? Some showgirls and a dance number?" Tony snarls at him, waving a hand in the air the way he always gestured while talking in the past.
"You work for the government?" Tony repeats, and he puts the mug down with a little more force than necessary. His blood feels like it's boiling as he raises a finger in Steve's direction, "Is that why you came up to me last night?"
And then, Stephen sits straight again and just the subtle movement causes everyone to turn back to him in wait.
"Tony?" Steve's voice calls out, and Tony turns his head to see Steve's head peeking out from beneath the garage door. He doesn't come in, but there's an expectancy in his gaze as he holds a hand out, "Come on, you need to get some sleep."
"Huh?" Tony asks, dumbfounded, but Steve just manages to wrap an arm around his waist and hoists him up so that they're walking together but most of his weight is leaning on the blond. Steve has the little cup in his free hand, and it almost looks like a doll's tea set with how big the man's hand is. He's so focused on that thought that he doesn't even have the ability to comprehend what he and Steve are doing.
Steve's affectionate with him but doesn't want to kiss him. They're married and share an apartment and a bedroom yet Tony sleeps alone on the bed when Steve takes up the couch.
"About that," Tony speaks up, and when everyone's attention quickly snaps over to him, he clears his throat, "Where are you going next?"
He's not sure if he feels better at all after speaking with Steve. There are still so many questions without answers. Why follow Tony? Okay sure, they're mates and it would suck to live if the other dies and blah blah blah, but surely Steve could have anybody he wants what with the burly muscles and youthful face? Why choose someone like Tony, who knows nothing about family and knows even less about romance? Was this all a setup by Howard to get him home? Was Steve just trying to play mind games to get him to come home so they could make babies together?
"Why do you ask?" Tony asks instead, his hand tightening around his clothes and his eyes darting past Steve and wondering if he can get there without Steve trying to pry into his injury.
"You're making it hard for me to control myself, Tony." Steve tells him, lip quivering and his hands shifting to sit atop Tony's shoulders. His fingers are curled into the shoulder blades, too, and Tony can believe how hard Steve's holding himself back.
"I've noticed," Sam quips, and he leans back on the stool, his body finally seeming to relax, "but Steve's going to push. He needs that vulnerability. Your relationship isn't going to be easy."
He steps out of the apartment, ducking down into a dark alleyway and making sure there are no cameras before he puts the briefcase onto the ground and stepping on it. The suit unfolds around him, surrounding him with a familiar HUD screen and circuitry.
He goes in anyway, shoulders squared as he hopes to god no one recognizes his face, but freezes right as he enters the threshold. The scent of honey hits him, and it hits him
"I would deserve it." Steve answers with a shrug, and he watches again as Tony licks his lips. They're not particularly dry or chapped, but they may as well be with how insistently he's moistening them.
Steve Rogers, apparent alpha of the pack his father, Howard, had sprung onto him out of nowhere. He'd never met the man in person, but the pictures could never do him justice. Blond hair, chiseled face, broad shoulders - it was everything Tony had ever wanted but was afraid of having.
"You can't do anything to me," Wanda answers, her voice smug as her gaze flickers from Steve to Tony.
"Couldn't we have at least detained her so we wouldn't have to risk her and Tony killing each other?" Sam asks, his voice cautious as the rest of the team stands to provide support for their leader.
"There's no fixing us, is there?" Steve asks, the words coming out weak and frightened. He knows the answer, but hopes he's wrong.
"I like y'all but please don't start making out in the middle of the movie," Sam says with a low groan as Steve adjusts them; and while the recliner isn't typically big enough for both of them, Tony is squeezed into Steve's side with their legs tangled and his head resting on Steve's chest.
"You did?" Steve asks now, the disbelief bleeding into his tone as he remembers the entire argument that had led to their fight in the first place, "Why'd you do that?"
Theres a collective gasp, though Steve isn't part of it. Sam is, though; because Rhodey's death was something he would never be able to forget. For Tony to be throwing it around so easily and heartlessly? What the hell had happened to the bright futurist Steve had once been so fond of?
She in turn tells him about her relationship with Happy. Happy had once been Tony's bodyguard, and the two of them met after Tony's disappearance. Happy needed to hide from Harold just for a few minutes. Pepper had a lot of steam she needed to let off. It's not really much of a surprise that they had gotten together after all.
"Where'd - where'd he go?" Steve asks, and both former assassins ignore the wobble in his voice. He's extremely grateful for that.
And when he's standing in front of the door, he falters. What is he supposed to even say? Is it too late for them after all? He wanted to give Steve space, but was that only assuming that they were strong enough to handle it?
"To be by his side," Steve answers, automatically. He didn't care about whether or not Tony would ever return his feelings or accept him as a mate. He just wanted to be by his mate; to fulfill a promise he made to Tony years ago.
"J?" Tony asks his AI, and he replaces Hawkeye onto a rooftop so he can get back to playing Robin Hood.
"What do you say, Stark?" Stephen questions, raising a hand like he's about to summon a portal, "Keep it here or do you want me to send it somewhere else?"
"The Avengers have been fine without me since the start. I was only pretending to be a hero, remember?" Tony growls, but some of the heat in his tone is forced, like he's confused by their intentions.
Gentle, yet firm, Steve brings a hand to Tony's hair, giving it a little tug that forces Tony to look up at him. Steve's eyes are blown wide, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallows.
"Where's the stone now?" Steve asks him, and while he wants to be more sympathetic, its best to get this out of the way before anything else.
But when he's looking around the room, having finally calmed down enough for Steve to release him, everyone's looking at him in concern. Was it really possible that the group of people he had just met recently felt more like a family to him than his only living family member ever did?
"What's going on, Stark?" Natasha asks, and while she does as he asks and reclaims her seat behind Wanda, she looks wary. They all do, he decides.
There's no context. There's no explanation. There's nothing but those three ominous words that cause bile to rise in his throat.
The shock around the room is brief. There's some disbelief in the air, too; and Tony pretends not to feel the weight of everyone's stares as they turn to look at him. Steve, especially, seems to have several emotions flyinh across his face at once.
The brunet pauses for a beat, then turns his gaze in Bucky's direction, "But back then, he's all you thought about. It didn't matter that the world was waiting on us because the only person you were waiting on was Barnes."
"Bro, I call best man." Clint calls out, and both Bucky and Sam throw handfuls of berries at him for his gall.
Tony rolls his hips into Steve's touch, not bothering to hide the groan building in his chest, "I'll tell you after you fuck me."
"What? Us getting married?" Steve is so calm and casual about it, but his ear tips are turning pink and his fingers are twitching as he holds the mug back out in Tony's direction, "Yeah. It happened."
"Not a chance," Steve quips, and Tony turns his head to see the mischief clear on Steve's face, "'Tasha's told me my face can get an entire army to follow my orders. I know how to work it."
He loses himself to his thoughts. Images of a young Steve fighting overseas causes tears to sting at the corners of his eyes, but he finds himself grateful for the fact that Steve wasn't harmed by Tony's weaponry. It filled him with warmth to know that despite everything, Steve was still such a good man and surrounded by people who seemed to have the same strand of thought. Tony's been alone for most of his life, but Steve could attract a crowd just with his eyes and goofy grin.
"Calm down, man. I'm not trying to spook you." The hint of amusement is back, and Sam is raising a hand into the air as a means to placate him, "I finished a degree in clinical psychology, you know? I spent a lot of time talking to vets, and after what I saw over there, I know it's not as easy to pretend none of this bothers you."
"But anyway, back to the story." Tony watches as Sam draws in a deep breath to brace himself, and without even thinking about it, Tony stands and strolls over. He's not too good at comforting people, but his hand presses down onto Sam's shoulder with just enough pressure to be a grounding presence. Sam flashes a smile up at him, and the gratefulness twinkles in his eyes, "At first we just met with everyone else, but there's this magnetism that comes from them that just drew me in. All of a sudden, we were jogging together, going out for drinks, talking about our childhoods. It helped all of us, I think. Just being able to talk and hang out like guys -- took the edge off. At some point, you came up. None of us had mates before, it was crazy to imagine that one of our mates would be
"I hope you drink it black because I don't believe in desecrating the holiness of coffee." Tony places the two mugs down on the counter and takes a seat opposite from Bucky, knowing that at least talking to the man might do something about the many concerns he had about Steve.
"Tony," he says as he gets closer, and it's not like he had a reason to call for his attention ahain, since Tony's waiting for him, "I'm here now. I'm not leaving you alone again."
He's lucky that in their first week together, Iron Man hasn't been called. Or he might have been, but with the rest of the Avengers on the scene, Tony has never bothered to put his suit on.
Like a robot, Tony steps over to the countertop and reaches for an empty mug. He's never been too big on food, but Steve wasn't mad about the Clint debacle and was basically pleading for him to eat a little. He'd have to take the small mercies where he could get them.
And Tony knows they're still so far from perfect. He knows he pushes buttons. He knows he's a coward. He knows Steve has a temper problem that reminds him of Howard. He knows they have to
"Oh man." Scott breathes out, and Steve can read his expression well enough to know what his teammate is thinking.
And even though he's not sure if they can provide the kind of help he needs to get the work done, Tony does find himself a little reassured. Sam's not the first of the pack he's met, but the man does know his way with words; and that's a fact.
Unknowingly, his eyes shift to Steve, who's with Clint by the stove, his expression full of exasperation like Clint is being way too uncooperative. He didn't even have time to discuss with Steve about what their next steps were now that they were bonded, so was it fair to resume to what they had been doing?
"Have I recently told you I love you, J?" Tony muses, and he steps back to let his bots take the pieces of his armor away for repairs, "Because I do. I really do."
Clint's a little outmanned here. No one could ever doubt his prowess as an archer, but she's as good long range as he is and he mostly provides cover for Natasha. Natasha is a deadly spy, for all intents and purposes, and doesn't intentionally hold back but - she's always had a bit of a soft spot for the other female on the team.
He presses his hands against Steve's chest and pushes. He's got to, or else he really will just cave when he's told himself not to time and time again.
"You're a civilian and you painted a target on your back." Steve, no, Captain America tells him. His tone is short, clipped, and Tony hates that now that he knows who Steve is, he can't see anyone but Captain America.
And then he uses the knife to chop his pinky clean off his left hand. Steve gasps, horrified, and he's about to lunge forward because old habits die hard; but as they watch, the skin begins to regrow with a glow of orange light.
The blond chuckles against his lips even as he thrusts his hips forward, and Tony hurriedly tugs the sweats off in order to feel their skin against one another. The pants disappear with a firm kick, and Steve grinds down on him, using one of his ridiculously large hands to stroke them both together.
"For you, sir, always." Is the AI's response. J is short for JARVIS, an artificial intelligence program he'd coded when he was younger to help him run Stark Industries. He takes over most of the primary functions when Tony's in the armor, and he's very aware that if he didn't have JARVIS, Iron Man would be nothing but a bug that an enemy could squish.
in his gaze that Tony almost feels like he's choking. Steve isn't alone, of course. Natasha and Clint are right behind him, and Sam walks in from the other side of the kitchen; and the energy of the conversation from the previous night's dinner returns full force.
When they rejoin the rest of the group, neither Sam or Clint are looking at each other, and Scott is staring back and forth at them like he's wary. Steve's not entirely sure what's happened in the time he stepped away, but it doesn't look too comforting, all things considered, that one of his closest teammates and his best friend in the future looked entirely like they wanted to jump over the table separating them to knock each other out.
"You'll be good for him," James decides when he finally deems himself calm enough to speak again, and Steve feels such a strong sense of relief that he releases a breath he didn't know he was holding onto.
, "I'm such a goddamn idiot. I'm didn't even realize - I - fucking love you and I didn't even know it until now."
"So tell me again why we can't take him out." Clint says, his tone dark and his lips curled into a grin that has no mirth.
And all Steve can think of while he climbs to his feet is that while Tony can't consider any place without Rhodey around as home, Steve can't think of any place without Tony as home.
Tony falters, but just slightly, and his eyes fall over to where Clint is like he's strange and out of place.
Then, Stephen smiles; and it's such a hollow smile that makes his gut churn because of how knowing it is. He flickers his wrist, and a portal opens behind the group.
Tony nods, more to himself, and he releases a deep sigh. He was right, then, he was getting in the way of something else.
"Steve Rogers, sir." Steve replies, and some of the tension that comes with jealousy eases off him. Tony bites back his own grin.
"Tony, sweetheart." Steve murmurs into his ear, shifting so that they're looking each other in the eye once more. Steve's hand, however, continues its tantalizing touches across Tony's chest, "I don't want to go too fast for you. We've got time for the next step."
"If any of you are squeamish, now's the time to get up and walk away," Tony warns them, and he waits a beat to see if they'll listen. They don't. If anything, his words added to his behavior about the situation only convinces them to stay. Really, he might have just landed in the midst of the most stubborn pack in existence. He takes a deep breath, running his hand through his hair once more like he's trying to brace himself, "Alright. I don't know if any of you know my full story, but by the time I turned 20, I had four PhDs in varying engineering concentrations. I was young and arrogant, I'll say that now; and I had enough money to get away with basically anything.
"No wonder you keep running from me." Steve says against his collarbone, and Tony finds his own heart thud painfully. How was it that even when Tony was cruel to him and giving him the worst kind of pain imaginable, that Steve could sound so mournful toward him? Steve squeezes again, and though such close contact usually had Tony feeling trapped, he felt protected and safe. He felt
JARVIS is quiet for a long beat, considering what he's supposed to say to Tony's claim; but Tony just grabs the briefcase that's been set aside for him to take and leaves the workshop. His leg hurts, but that can be taken care of when he gets home. Happy, his driver, pulls up in front of the building; and it's a very eccentric behavior that he'll admit to but he doesn't allow anyone to drive him when they're in a car together.
Thor looks a little lost, like he doesn't know what just happened; and his hand wavers in the air as if he's trying to decide on whether or not his touch will be welcomed again. Before he can actually get to it, Wanda slides across the room and wraps her hand around his. She looks apologetic and her smile is gentle as she turns the broad-shouldered blond in the opposite direction.
Tony grins as he lets the metal sheet fall back onto the table. He can work on it in a few minutes -- he would never leave coffee waiting too long. He shuffles back over to where the coffee is sitting, and he pretends not to notice when Sam's eyes narrow on his forearms and hands. Unfortunately, metal is still pretty sharp; and this garage doesn't come with the safety gloves he knows he'd typically need for working with it. Not that he ever wore it in the first place, but it sounds like a good excuse in his head.
Wait, there's another sound. And the sweet, sweet smell of coffee hitting his nostrils. He pauses for a second, knowing he should leave before he's noticed, but the smell of coffee makes his stomach growl louder than necessary.
That's meant to end their interaction for the night, Tony decides on his own. Really, he had no moral obligation to fulfill by opening his house to them, but he felt guilty enough about them following from a distance. They gave up their normal, cozy pack-life to follow him as he ran from his responsibilities. He hadn't asked them to do any of that, but they're the ones who wanted to be near him. For once, he figured, it'd be nicer to have them in the same four walls than following from a distance.
Bucky's there, again, and the two of them are cooking together and working with so much ease that they're practically the married couple. Tony's heard thuds, viciously, but he just mumbles his hello and steps in the direction of the bathroom. He's covered in grease and motor oil, and there's a cut on his shoulder, accompanied with a bruise, he hadn't taken care of; so he'll let them goof around until he's done taking care of himself.
and fight everything together. I don't know how many times I have to say this. I had no interest in betraying anyone. I just wanted to keep us together."
"I'm good," Tony answers, albeit reluctantly, and no one misses the wheezing as he struggles to catch his breath.
"I'm sure we can conjure up something for you," a voice quips from behind them. It's dry and arrogant and has Steve immediately thinking of Tony; but when he turns around, it sure as hell isn't Tony looking back at him. The man is roughly of the same age as the engineer, but there's a cloak on his back and he's walking with a sense of purpose.
"Then it's a good thing we're here to help you in whatever capacity you need us to." Sam answers, and there's a wide grin on his face now as he pats Tony once on the shoulder and leaves the garage.
Why did he think being around Steve would be a good idea? He knows he's the one to propose that they spend time together at least once a week, but he really hadn't expected for his body to react as strongly as it had. He also didn't expect the metal-armed man or how Steve reacted to
His first stop in New York is the tower, obviously. He knows he should at least call Steve and explain, or apologize; but he did say he wanted to give Steve space, and Steve never disagreed.
"Consider it done, sir." JARVIS replies, and Tony waits a beat to give his AI a moment to get it done.
He cums with a jumble of words Tony can't understand in his post-orgasmic haze, leaning forward and biting at Tony's shoulder hard enough to leave a mark. His fingers are bruising at Tony's hips, but Tony's proud to know he can zap away Steve's self control.
"Tony-" Wanda begins, but Tony suddenly can't hear a thing. It feels like his head's been submerged under water and he can't hear a thing at all.
Tony tries to slip away, but Steve's head snaps back in his direction. Sure, he's usually afraid of Steve's anger; but this is well deserved and he can tell the blond isn't
"Steve." Tony calls, his voice coming out soft and followed by a choked sob; because as scared as Steve must be for him, he is for Steve. He works for the government, cleaning up after alien invasions and the Avengers. If anyone's at risk, it's him.
supposed to mean?" Sam asks now, and he only sounds a little confused as to whether or not he should be offended.
"Strange." Tony answers, and he bends down to place the Iron Patriot onto the ground. He's gentle with the battle armor, treating it like it's the most fragile thing in the universe.
? All I have to do is kiss you and you'll leave me the fuck alone?" Tony is elated by the reveal and all his anger flies out of him as he leans forward with his lips puckered.
Rhodey's there, too, and Steve looks entirely too nervous like he's meeting Tony's dad. Rhodey attempts to be stern about it, gives a shovel talk to Steve purely to torture the super soldier, then turns his head and notices Bucky hanging out in the back on his own.
Tony just laughs, because in all honesty, this is what he wanted. Steve's still too gente with him, holding back like he's actually going to break Tony in half. While the genius appreciates that in everyday situations, he wants Steve to actually let himself go when they're having sex.
It’s the next day, and having spent the night in an uncomfortable room in what Stephen Strange calls ‘The Sanctum,’ Steve’s body is sore and rigid from having slept on the floor. He’d done it for years during his time in the army and yet he’d never get used to it.
"Language." Tony scolds, but there's no conviction to it. It's quiet, something that he just has to say because he doesn't know what else
"If you pay attention to the movie, that won't be a problem." Steve quips back easily, and wow, he really can be such a little shit. Someone throws popcorn at him and when Tony shifts to see who it was, it's Bucky, who seems more amused than annoyed.
"Art? Huh." Tony mulls it over in his head, and he's unable to fight the melancholic smile off of his face. His mom loved art, and one of the houses she left for him was full of pieces she had collected over time. Of course his mate would be like her in that sense.
Tony doesn't know much about the mate thing, but he knows how much it hurts when Steve talks to him like that, like he's just
Rhodey shifts, releasing his grip on Bucky so that he can move over to where Tony is sitting. He waves a hand into the designs, knocking them away, and then takes a seat beside Tony. It doesn't exactly regain the brunet's attention, but it's all his patience will allow him to do, "Tones. I know you hate the guy. I hate the bastard, too; but as of right now, you're a suspect too. You know what'll happen if you don't show tonight."
Tony doesn't hide his grimace, "They've got government affiliated packs, not to mention federal guards; also not to mention how they can destroy you fiscally."
He takes the nearest seat that he can find, turning his attention to a holographic workstation he can use for his designs. While the rest of them might have felt like they had to pay their respects to a dead man, Tony just wanted to get these designs for Obadiah done so he can get the guy off his trail for long enough to take his company back.
He takes his time, his tongue flickering along the shaft as he takes Steve further into his mouth in slow, teasing strokes. Steve shudders in response, and one of his hands lands in Tony's hair, fingers tangled into the curled locks as he grunts. Tony looks up at him through his wet eyelashes, loving the sight of Steve biting hard onto his lower lip. Their gazes meet, and Tony allows Steve to set their pace, his hand guiding Tony along as he moves to take more of Steve into his mouth.
"I want your mouth around me." Steve tells him. His dirty talk needs some work, but it's enough to shoot thrills down his spine to his own cock.
"You were supposed to lay back and enjoy the blow, Steve." Tony says, amused and also so equally turned on by the quick turnaround.
"I'm saying -" Tony takes a deep breath to steel himself, "I don't want to go back home, not just yet, but I want to stay with you, Steve."
"I'm sorry, Captain, for I'm not asking of your permission." Vision retorts, calm and sure and determined in himself, "I would still like to hold my memories of respect with her, and I can't let anyone else see what is to happen between us."
The second week is -- different. Not better. Not worse. Just different. Bucky is still around daily, but leaves earlier than he had the first week. Tony feels guilty for getting in the way of their friendship, and can't meet either Bucky or Steve's eyes when he gets home and they're both there.
While most of Captain America's face is covered by a cowl, Tony doesn't miss the way his royal jackass rolls his eyes at the
But he missed Steve's gaze enough to know he didn't mind one way or another. And then he parts his lips and takes the entirety of Tony's dick into his mouth in one fell swoop, and Tony nearly cums from the sight of that alone. Steve's got no gag reflex, which is probably something he needs to thank the serum for, and goes at it like he's starved for it.
"Let me take you to bed." Tony says, and Steve snaps his head back in Tony's direction with surprise lighting his expression. It nearly makes Tony laugh, because is it really surprising to want to sleep next to your husband at night?
"Stark." He says, by way of greeting. Steve feels a little relieved knowing that Stephen's way of treating them like insects was just how he treated everyone.
"In two days from now, Tony Stark will commit the first murder that will remove any remnance of the humanity left in him." Stephen tells him in response, his eyes flickering and his hands twitching.
Stephen turns just his eyes in Steve's direction, and the super soldier feels like he's shrinking under the weight of his gaze, "You became an international fugitive when you felt like your best friend was being targeted. Is it hard to assume that the death of the one man who is his constant in any reality would be the cause of his undoing?"
And Tony stares at him, over the top of his hand still being held out. The others are silent as they watch, unsure of where this conversation is headed. Tony could either run away or attack them, and then they'd lose him for good.
Tony's eyebrows fly upward, and for a moment, he waits for Steve to rescind the invitation. After all, it's Steve's pack, not his, and they don't all seem overly fond of him. That's not even including Bucky, who Tony is actually very wary of himself.
Steve chuckles again, and his fingers fall away from Tony's ass. He's hit with melancholy, missing the presence of Steve in him, but Steve adjusts quickly, leaning back on the bed and hooking Tony's thighs around his waist.
It's Wanda who breaks their stalemate; and with a flicker of her wrist, the Iron Patriot suit lifts off the ground and flies straight up above them. There's a lot of damage she can cause by dropping it from a high enough altitude; and just the fact that she'd use Rhodey's suit in such a way causes Steve's heart to stutter.
"Here. Drink some of this tea." Wanda offers, and she's holding out a little cup that smells like perfume, "Bruce thinks your sleep deprivation is increasing your emotional distress, so I poured you some of my sleepytime tea."
Tony wants to laugh as much as he wants to cry. He's not too good with emotional vulnerability, as stated before; but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to spend more time with the alpha that fate had chosen to be his. Instead of answering, Tony lets his features soften into the most genuine smile he can manage with the inner turmoil he's facing and closes the distance between them. The kiss starts of chaste, just a brushing of their lips; but Steve reacts quickly, bringing a hand to the back of his head, fingers curled around his neck as he plunges forward in response.
And then his gaze turns back to Steve, and there's no end to how much hatred is in this hazel orbs. The same gaze that always filled him with warmth and laughter was now chilling him to the bones. Sure, they both made mistakes when it came to the Accords. Steve had only the thought of saving Bucky in his head when everything broke apart; and Tony had been emotional and could have done something that they would both regret. Steve can still remember their fight. Trying to stop each other with everything they had while Tony went after his best friend and the only living connection he still had to his past.
Late? For wh- oh, right. He just notices that all three of them are dressed for the wake. He just blinks and shrugs a shoulder as he takes a step back.
Tony had sent Pepper a message as he pulled into a gas station, telling her they were on their way. She didn't ask any questions about who was coming. She just told him they'd be waiting for him at home.
"You knew about that?" Steve asks, bewildered. That was a call sign he used while resuming Avengers-level operations overseas. No one was supposed to know who he was.
Tony shoots at the shield, and Steve uses his shield to aim the trajectory of the shot. It ricochets like it always does when they perform this particular maneuver, and the reupolsor blast hits Wanda straight on.
"Bird brain?" Sam counters, and some of the tension is rolling off of him as he sits down on the only stool in the garage.
Steve takes in another deep breath and turns in Tony's direction. Whatever relationship he and Tony have right now is fragile. It's always been fragile, because they've never been able to see eye-to-eye in the past and it's been a problem for them since they met on the Hellicarrier.
The roads are backed up, but he gets back to Steve's little apartment in Brooklyn with relative ease. He knows Steve works for clean up; and though a part of him thinks he should go out looking for his husband, knowing he helped take care of a threat eased him.
The answering stare he receives from Tony could have wilted him. His jaw is trembling as he grinds it, his hands trembling even as he seems to be physically holding them still.
"You don't mean that." Steve's voice grits out from behind him, and Tony turns around in a swift movement. Steve's staring right at him, jaw clenched and eyes hard.
"I need full transparency, here," he manages to bite out, his teeth grit almost painfully. They look at each other, and then back to him, like he's grown another head and they don't know exactly what he's on about, and Tony uses that as fuel to keep going, "What, exactly, did Howard tell you about me leaving New York?"
"When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought you were gone," Steve says, and his voice is so quiet and
"I didn't make it easy on him, or any of the rest of you, and that's on me." Tony concedes, both arms up on the table and holding onto the mug in his hands with an iron grip, "I got so tired and fed up watching my mom and Howard growing up that the entire idea of mates and settling down with someone that could very easily kill me by just walking
Everyone seems to give up on breakfast and strolls into the next room where the television lay. A few of them have their plates in their hand, though; and Tony doesn't even seem to realize he's still clutching onto his empty mug. Clint is the one who picks up the remote and turns the television on. Everyone else is holding onto bated breaths much like Tony is. As soon as the news turns on, Tony feels his world turn upside down.
"Huh." Tony says out loud; and considering his checkered past with his old man, he'd say that's an appropriate reaction.
The movie seems to stretch out longer than it should, and Tony can see some of the others starting to nod off. Bucky might actually be snoring, but Tony doesn't feel the need to check for himself to confirm on the thought of it. Really, he feels he should be a little guiltier about not being able to pay more attention to Steve when the alpa is spending more of his attention on the genius than the movie. Steve's just as anxious as he feels, or maybe it's because of how Tony's acting that he seems that way.
"I don't think there's anything to discuss." Natasha speaks up, her voice a little strained with emotion. She knows the right call, but even for her, choosing one teammate over another is difficult, "Steve spent most of his life taking down HYDRA. We can't just let her off the hook knowing she's aligned herself with the supremist Nazi group."
The only problem was - how? Tony hated Steve, and the rest of the Avengers. What could they possibly do to change his mind, and was there even the slimmest chance of being able to save him?
The silence stretches on in an uncomfortable manner, and eyes flicker back and forth like no one’s sure of who’d be the first to fill it. In his mind, Steve knows it’s on him as the leader. He knows he should devise a plan on what they do to stop Tony before he manages to undo everything he’d done in the past with a decision that was so unlike him.
Tony and Clint look at each other one more time, nod like they're in perfect unison, and turn to jolt away from Steve as quickly as their feet can take them. Which turns out to be impossible, because Steve catches them by the collars of their shirts. He pulls them back roughly, but angle them away from his body to ensure that they're the only ones who are caught by the force. There's a loud thumping sound when their heads knock against one another; and whines follow from both of them.
"I'll come back and lock up after I take a look at your arms." Steve responds, and with that cheeky little grin on his face, Tony doesn't bother to bite back the roll of his eyes.
He doesn’t like the idea of sleeping separately from his husband. Even though they're technically just a little more than strangers, he can't help but wonder why Steve just doesn't want to share a bed.
"What do we do about her now?" Clint asks, and he's drawing an arrow in case she makes any sudden movements.
still the man who was willing to throw his life away to save everyone else's. That had never changed from the first time they battled together.
"There's breakfast, too." A voice calls out all of a sudden, and Tony's so startled by it that he lets go of his mug all together. A hand shoots out from behind him, catching the cup with such great reflexes that he's caught off guard.
All the way to the room they're bunking in, the air is thick with tension and apprehension, and Steve enters the room first, coming to stand at parade rest and turning in Tony's direction to see what the next step is.
The name piques Tony's interest immediately, and he finds he isn't faking it when he reaches out and firmly shakes the outstretched hand, "I've read about you, Dr. Banner. I hear you nearly made Manhattan explode in a puff of green smoke. I'm a big fan, really."
Tony was only 17 when his mom died, and only 17 when he met Steve. Between the age of 17 and 21, he had no idea of Steve's whereabouts or his relations to Howard. He would have to ask about it when he gets the chance to.
Tony shifts forward in his seat, his jaw clenched and his eyes dark, "This better be some kind of joke, Wilson."
Tony smiles, and it's a small, shaky smile that's entirely too forced. He glances down at the briefcase armor in his hand and realizes it's time he finally come clean to Steve. After all, he could've died while dealing with this threat, and Steve would've never known.
"See, I don't do breakfast." Tony tells him with an easy grin, and after lifting half of the sandwich off the plate, he nudges the plate over in the blond's direction, "If it's not caffeine, I usually don't want it in my body."
"We can get it annulled?" Tony asks then, trying to be helpful while his brain is decidedly not. Marriage is one thing, but if the press catches wind on his annulment he'll be the biggest news since Kim Kardashian's wedding a few years back.
"I doubt Pepper knows about the phone call if I didn't." James surmises as he stands up, "We've been building a case to try and get Stane out, but we don't have any official evidence that can stand in court. Tony can provide witness but if Obadiah is holding you over his head-"
The black and red Iron Man suit falls into a slump on the ground, his arms wrapped tightly around the older battle armor like just imagining letting go is painful.
"What the fuck is going on?" Tony hears Bucky ask distantly, but it's drowned out by the sound of Steve's footsteps getting closer.
Oh. Tony's brought back to the nightmare Steve had that one night. He's had a few since them, though Steve doesn't usually tell him what they're about; but Tony doesn't really know what to tell Steve. After all, his identity is a secret.
The simplicity of which she uses in that question causes Steve's stomach to churn. Just take him down?
He noses along the side of Steve's neck, and the blond's fingers curl tighter. Tony doesn't think he's entirely aware of it at that point, but he doesn't protest the grip. His lips brush against the mark, and he hears the hitch in Steve's breath as his lips wrap around the skin of his neck. His teeth give it a little nip, like what's expected in a mark, and he releases a soft moan at the taste of Steve's skin in his mouth. Steve moans into his ear in return, and his hips thrust into Tony from the pleasure of the mark.
They share everything else. They share mugs, clothes (Tony likes being wrapped up in Steve's large sweaters), and an apartment, but they can't manage to share a bed. Tony wonders if there's a part of Steve that regrets being tied down to someone like Tony Stark after all.
But as quickly as James's mood had lifted, it falls again; and he looks sobered to the point of despair as his head tilts back down and his eyes focus onto Steve, "The man's been through a lot, Steve; a lot you don't know about, and a lot even I don't know about. When I met him, he was the smartest kid in the world that I knew of; and had more money than I could ever think to imagine, but the kid
"I'm going to get him to bed," Steve interrupts, like he can read Tony's thoughts and wants to verbally disapprove of them before they become more coherent.
Stunned, Steve just stares at Tony. He should've known ahead of time that if Tony was sure of Bucky's innocence, he wouldn't do a thing to harm the man.
Tony says, as a way of breaking the ice. It's not a very good way, granted, but what else is he supposed to say about it?
Unfortunately, Steve could understand her point. Tony did have strong emotions when it came to accountability and was the first to sign with the Accords that wanted to strip away their freedom and have Wanda locked up citing her instability.
He takes a long moment to process what she's saying, though he's not entirely sure what to make of it. Okay, so did Steve know ahead of time that they were mates? Was he friends with Howard? Was Steve at Maria's funeral? What
"Enough." Stephen says, all of a sudden, and he's flanked by a dozen monks who have their hands out and ready to cast what Steve assumes are spells.
Steve sighs in resignation, and he turns around to leave Tony's room, but Tony manages to shoot out of bed and grasp for his arm. Steve freezes at the touch, but he doesn't pull away as Tony's hand slides down to intertwine their fingers.
"Not a problem," he tells her, and he pretends not to notice the way her eyebrow twitches, "I'm not going."
Steve looks wounded by his verbal diarrhea; and feeling like an utter coward, Tony pushes past him to the bathroom. Steve doesn't stop him this time, and Tony doesn't know if he should feel good about it or worry that he's already lost his husband.
"Tony, you haven't eaten anything since lunch," Steve admonishes from behind him, and when Tony turns around to see the rest of the group has stood up, he can see the questions dancing in Steve's eyes, "Are you sure you should drink on an empty stomach?"
"You... want to go out? Or stay in and watch a movie here?" Tony responds carefully. He's known to be a public figure, sure, but he prefers to spend most of his days at home in private. There's also the issue of paparazzi and wanting to respect Steve's privacy.
A moment of silence passes between them, and then Steve turns in his direction and his jaw is set in determination, "It might be old fashioned of me but I don't believe in divorce."
That is a powerful, dreadful kind of statement, if Steve’s ever heard one. Thanos, the mad Titan that they keep hearing about, seems to be a powerful foe; and if Tony’s involvement is what’s needed to stop him at the end of the day, there’s nothing else to it.
He's not alone, though. Sure, Tony's already seen Bucky, but he takes in the others in the room and everything suddenly clicks into place. Hawkeye's sitting there, with the Black Widow and Dr. Bruce Banner (the Hulk). Thor's there too, sitting on the actual coffee table with a poptart hanging out of his mouth. That left the Winter Soldier, who was obviously Bucky, now that Tony thought harder about it.
"Steve." He cuts in, smooth and amused and he can hear the longing in his own tone. Steve can, too, with how his blue eyes dilate again.
"Hey man. You got food in there, right?" The other man, who Tony pointedly decides he likes best of the entire group, asks. He doesn't look like he's really expecting an answer, either, but Tony shrugs and points a finger in the direction of the door.
Natasha distracts her using her batons; and while Wanda is powerful, Natasha is fast and more experienced. When Natasha leaves an opening, Steve throws his shield. It knocks into Wanda and Bucky catches it easily. He throws it back in Sam's direction, and their teamwork is effortless and efficient in backing Wanda into a corner.
"I destroyed these." Tony mutters, and his heart thuds violently like something sharped is being jammed into it. His hands are shaking, and Tony hates how just a few minutes were able to take away from the good night/morning he was having. He looks back at Rhodey, and notes that while his best friend isn't shaking like he is, that the discomfort is still clear on his face, "How did you get these?"
Steve looks up at him, his lips a little swollen and his eyes glazed over; but there's so much warmth there, and love. Tony feels like he's swimming in it.
"I can take care of myself, Steve." Tony murmurs as he slowly sits back up, but it might be the wrong thing to say when Steve's body tenses. The blond isn't looking in his direction at all, and he's instead focusing on leaning down to pick his clothes off the ground. It's so tense and awkward and Tony can't help but wonder what just happened, "Steve? What's wrong?"
"What is there to talk about?" Tony drawls on, and he has no interest in sitting back and letting anyone else tell him when to talk or why.
Obadiah finally says, with a heavy sigh; and he acts put upon, but they both know Obadiah relies on Tony's genius more than Howard's.
his head hits the pillow. His breaths are even, as shallow as they might be, and he looks relaxed for the first time in days. He quietly tucks the genius in, then takes a seat at the edge of the bed to watch just for a few minutes. His life had never actually been boring, but with Tony in the mix, it feels like he's living in an action movie.
"I got all my work done." Tony explains quietly; and while they're the only two in the apartment and don't need to be speaking in whispers, there's something almost fragile in the air between them, "Figured I'd come home and see you."
"Thank you again, friend Anthony, for sharing your home with us." Thor says, cheerful as ever, and he claps onto Tony's shoulder with a lot more force than necessary. It causes for Tony to knock his chest against the countertop. Thor doesn't even seem to notice that the wind was knocked out of him, just claiming the stool next to him and ignoring the dirty look Sam gives him for taking the seat he was obviously going for.
Steve's eyebrows fly upwards as he hears it. A metal plate in his chest? It doesn't make Steve feel any better to know about it; it just makes him that much more aware of Tony's fragility. When he had heard about Tony's trip to Afghanistan, he was rightfully horrified. He met Tony because the brunet almost lost his life, and Steve was merely lucky enough to be there at the right time to get him out of the water. He wasn't there for Afghanistan. It was during the time he had been working for Howard in Washington D.C., and when he and Bucky met Sam for the first time. To know he could've lost his mate was heartbreaking; especially considering Tony had never met him before then.
He wonders if it's alright for him to feel a little proud and possessive over the fact that he did get Steve after all, but there was history between Steve and Bucky that Tony couldn't even begin to understand.
"You can leave miss Maximoff to me," a voice quips from behind them, and they all turn to see Vision floating towards them. His android body isn't in good shape, Steve notes; and he wonders in horror what Wanda had done to him. The mind stone that was once attached to his head is missing, on top of the physical damage
, Clint. You were supposed to enjoy the life you built up with your wife and kids. I didn't call you because that part of your life was supposed to be over with."
Despite the situation, the words cause Tony's chest to feel warm, and when his eyes roam, he finds that everyone's looking at him with soft gazes. There's trust in their eyes, mixed with gratefulness and acceptance, and it very nearly makes Tony choke.
He's not entirely sure why she's telling him that like it has anything to do with him, but manages to shrug it off as he leaves the kitchen. He already knows Steve is behind him, because Steve's eyes always find their way back to him even when the room is full of other people, but the blond remains silent until they're far from prying eyes.
The blond lifts his head slowly, looking up at him with soft eyes flooded with concern and love. Tony feels like he's choking under the weight of his gaze.
Tony just gapes at him, his mouth dry as his heartbeat picks up. Steve had already told him he would die if Tony wasn't serious about it -well, maybe not in those exact words-, but hearing it from someone who clearly had some sort of love for the alpha was something different entirely.
They take care of the battle eventually, and everyone leaves with minimal injuries, but his mood is decidedly foul when he eventually pulls up to the apartment.
He knows it's not a good idea to wake someone having a nightmare, and knows that there are things Steve's seen that he couldn't even comprehend but he can't stand the thought of watching helplessly as Steve continues to toss and turn. That's why he creeps forward, placing a careful hand on Steve's trembling shoulder in an attempt to rouse him.
"Feels heavier than a briefcase." Captain tells him, short and to the point and is this really the man Tony married? "So if it's not a briefcase, what is it?"
All of a sudden he's grateful for the bland, light stew that the monks had prepared for them. Anything else would've just been rejected by his body.
"Everyone's hard on me. I'm used to being held to a different standard than anyone else." Tony answers without hesitation, and Steve's heart clenches.
Tony stares for a moment longer, then sighs. He knows this is a bad idea. Now that they've got a taste of each other, their fate has been sealed. He knows this. Steve knows this. Maybe Steve planned it. But Tony went along with it even though he know.
"Extremis. A serum that was modeled after the one used on Steve," she supplies, because of course she'd have the answers to questions everyone wants to ask, "It regrows limbs, but it was-"
He gets back off the stool, lips pursed as he mentally outweighed his options. Would he really run away now, like a coward? He's sure the rest of his guests are happily unpacked inside the house, and his thoughts are confirmed when he ducks around the corner of the house and notices the second car parked out front. It hadn't been there when he had been out there earlier, that's for sure. He creeps closer to it, quietly exhaling in relief when he noted both cars were empty. The coast was clear, just as he was hoping.
His thoughts are cut off when his vision is cut off; and instead of looking at his best friend, Pepper is right in his face. Her face is red from frustration, which is understandable; and her hands are planted firmly on her hips as she peers up at him, "You need to go get dressed. We're going to be late!"
"Steve." Tony says, sighing as he tilts his head back, "I don't think I'll ever go back. You know that."
"Iron Man, got any ideas?" Captain America asks; and really, does he have to ask? There's only one option they can work with right now, and it's the same option they had during the Chitauri invasion.
Alas, having the compound possibly destroyed by Tony Stark meant they had nowhere else to go. Of course, they could go back to Wakanda where they had been hiding, but who’s to say Tony wouldn’t just follow them there?
"Is this a come on?" Tony asks, trying to go with a humored approach instead of denying it outright because he hasn't shown off his body since before Afghanistan.
Steve is silent for a moment, his lips curling into a bittersweet sort of smile. His head dips forward, forehead pressing against Tony's like he's trying so hard to get closer. His eyes are still open, and while their eyes are crossing ever so slightly as they gaze at each other, Steve's gaze is undeniably soft.
“Tony didn’t want us to be slaves.” Natasha bites out, but she’s entirely composed and looks a little disinterested in the conversation, “He wanted oversight on the Avengers. After Sokovia, it was bound to happen regardless of our feelings. Tony just wanted to get ahead of it because out of all of us, he’s got the most to lose.”
When Tony pats the bed next to him, Steve gingerly takes a seat. Even though they're right next to each other, there's enough space between them to fill a galaxy with stars. Steve remembers sitting side by side, relaxed and joking together and discussing future plans. He wishes so desperately that he could just go back in time to those moments.
And like nothing else, that cuts deep. He's not using his famous cold tone and his cool eyes, but the hurt is so deep and his tone is so small that it nearly shatters Steve's heart. He doesn't look at Natasha, but knows that to her, his words would also strike a chord.
Steve releases a breath, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. There's so much he wants to say in rebuttal. They're soldiers, their only role is to take care of the threat. Then there was the fact that Tony never actually explained the Accords and just expected everyone to follow his lead when their freedom was in question.
He can't help the gasp that slips past his lips, because how could Tony even believe that? If they weren't friends, why did they stay up late at night together when each other had a nightmare? If they weren't friends, why did Tony allow him into his private workshop just to sit and draw as he worked? If they weren't friends -- if they weren't friends, why did his heart break for Tony when Pepper left him the first time?
On the Friday of their first week together, Tony's come home early. It's almost dinner time, and the scent of pasta fills his nose as he walks into the apartment. Steve had given him a key the first day with a charming, nervous smile on his face. Tony felt like his heart was going to burst.
Steve glares at her, even knowing that she's only looking out for his best interests. Sleep can wait until Tony's beside him again. Steve's too wired and frustrated for even a wink of rest.
"I'm afraid that she's too far out of our reach even if we were to help her." And there's a deep sadness in his voice that causes Steve's heart to clench in sad understanding.
So he hops back into his car and scours for an open fast-food joint. There are none. Where the hell did he end up if there were no McDonalds or Wendys to be found? He's dismayed, and gumbles under his breath as he pulls up to what is probably the most crowded diner he's ever seen. For fuck's sake, it's almost midnight and people have chosen a diner of all places to be?
Tony whips around to glare at him; and it's so different from the flat, cool looks he's been giving the blond, "
"Uh. Yeah." Scott answers, the faintest of smiles pulling at the edge of his lips, "We were talking about Wanda and it didn't go too well."
Steves jaw twitches again, and his eyes flicker away from Tony in what might be embarrassment, "No. That was a first for me. I never had time to date in the past. It just felt right."
