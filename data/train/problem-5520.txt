“I love you,” Tony says, pulling Steve down onto the bed next to him. Steve laughs and goes easily, settling his head into the crook of Tony’s arm.
He steadfastly avoids Tony the whole night, but oddly enough ends up chatting with who appears to be his guest for the evening -- an amiable British guy who introduces himself as ‘Viz’. He tells Steve that Tony’s just in town for the weekend, doing some business in Manhattan before heading back to Malibu.
Over the span of the next half hour Tony goes through about fifteen different people of various gender identities, and Steve makes up increasingly flimsy excuses for his aversion to each of them. By the time he gets to ‘she wears blue shoelaces, who does that?’ Tony has to turn around and give him a reprimanding glare.
“Friday?” he asks quietly. Riri and Peter’s hearts are still beating steady, no recent acceleration that would indicate torture or anything torture-adjacent.
“Are you cyberstalking my contacts?” Steve asks casually, clearing some of Tony’s hair away from his temple and pressing a sweet, absent-minded kiss there.
“No,” Tony says, exasperated, “but that’s the point. That’s what I should have been doing at fifteen, maybe then I wouldn’t be so… I don’t know. Pick a character flaw from SHIELD’s laundry list. She’s just too young. She’s not even really a person, yet, she’s like a little prototype.”
“Morning,” his voice is low and rough with sleep, and he’s rubbing his cheek like he’s afraid he drooled. “You have a flight?”
“Obie’s fine,” Tony waves a hand dismissively, finally moving away from the scotch and into the living room, collapsing onto yet another hideous piece of furniture that can’t possibly be comfortable. Steve glances up at him to find that he’s already looking, and Steve’s struck with the jarring notion that Tony’s thinking about what he looks like naked. Though, upon further examination, he figures that’s probably how Tony Stark looks at everyone.
“Right, yeah, okay,” Tony adjusts his grip around Steve’s legs and looks at him with soft, entreating eyes. “I don’t want you to do this because you think you owe me something. It’s actually probably my fault that Brock got so obsessed with you. He knew I was into you and he wanted to get back at me and you were too smart for it, so he did all that fucked up shit to Bucky. If you think about it I’m really just making good on a loose end I left hanging, like, three years ago, and I don’t want you to think—“
These are, unfortunately, reasonable and legitimate questions, which is deeply damaging to Steve’s Hate Tony Stark At All Costs strategy. He abruptly realizes he’s started glaring at Tony again, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind, matching the expression with a mild smile of his own. Steve narrows his eyes.
Steve is abruptly cut off by the sound of Peter Parker, bounding vigorously up the staircase. He loses his balance at the top step and crashes into Tony’s back, nearly sending them both toppling over. There’s more clattering and Steve catches sight of Ned and MJ running up behind him, strange expressions on their faces.
Things get easier. They don’t go away, but they get easier. And his repertoire of Things expands, too, so it’s not just self-loathing and light alcoholism 24/7, which has been the Tony Stark Agenda for perhaps a smidge too long, if Dr. Burford’s knowing looks are anything to go by. Now Tony has Shawarma with the team and speaking at MIT commencement and making a point to see Rhodes every week and beating his terrible brain with a stick because it turns out he
Nobody breathed, in that room, not for several, dragging minutes. Pepper ushered them out of the briefing hall, Steve endured a lecture about going off-script during conferences, someone stuck him in a cab on a one-way trip back to his apartment to wait out the inevitable media storm. And, even as the rest of the world pushed forward, Tony stayed stuck, breath still caught in his throat, admiration still frozen in his chest.
When the last beats of the song finally pump out of the speakers, Steve insists he needs to find the bathroom. Convincing Phil not to follow him is far more difficult than is comfortable for either of them. The second he tugs his wrist out of that slightly clammy grasp, he starts off in the opposite direction, wiping sweat from his brow and neck with the sleeve of his shirt.
Everyone except Riri turns their head to look at him. It reminds him eerily of a documentary he and Steve watched about lemurs two weekends ago.
He shows up on Tony’s doorstep again the next morning, armed with muffins instead of a flimsy alibi.
Tony grins and kisses Steve again, biting his lip playfully. “Come on. Takes a lot more than that to lay me out.”
“Should we leave?” one of the kids asks - Led, perhaps? - glancing nervously between Tony and Peter.
Still, she makes James Rhodes stand in the sweltering late August heat for another hour and a half. Bucky eventually leaves the crawlspace, grumbling about how everyone over 25 has cooties, and Sam has to leave, too, to get ready for work.
“Hold on a minute, Campus Police,” Tony says, plucking a brownie out of the box with his free hand. “I haven’t been entirely convinced that this is a bad idea.”
Tony flashes Officer Pedesco a teasing salute on his way out. Officer Pedesco returns it with a nervous smile.
He attends therapy far more often than Tony, and goes on lots and lots of runs, which he says help. He’d never admit it, but physical affection helps, too, so when Tony knows he’s having an off day the first thing he does is tackle him onto the couch and pepper his face with kisses.
“I—“ Tony hesitates, eye flicking momentarily away from Steve, “I don’t know if I… should. Until we know how this conversation ends.”
He hopes to leave before Steve wakes up, because he’s a coward like that, but he accidentally stabs his toe on the nightstand and his resulting grunt of pain makes Steve’s eyes flutter open.
Along with Sam’s side wound, he’s got a black eye and considerable bruising across his collar. Tony wonders if being both a brilliant tactician and an enormous idiot is a mandatory requirement for the position of Captain America.
He knows he needs to breathe. He knows he needs to snap out of it. But every time he reaches for one of his coping mechanisms (each varying in effectiveness and general healthiness), it’s like he’s moving through molasses.
“Here as in my penthouse? My working theory is you picked the lock. And Jarvis didn’t kick you out because I still haven’t removed you from the house roster.”
Jesus. He’s never been an ace at social interaction, but this hostile half-acquaintanceship with Tony Stark has really made Steve’s batting average swing to all-time lows.
Rhodey ducks out of the car, takes one look around, and matches Tony grin for grin. “I thought you’d be in a tractor,” he says, and Tony tackles him into a hug, holding tight.
“Riri blew it up,” Tony croaks. “In the name of science.” He folds his arms over the counter and tucks his forehead against them, expelling a heavy sigh. He’s not sleepy but he’s exhausted, feeling it settle deep and aching in nearly every bone in his body.
“Not interested in that,” Tony says, but even though his eyes are fully closed he can feel Steve’s gaze on him, pressing against his neck and collar like a tangible weight that Tony can’t help but want to shake off. It’s been a while since someone was this inquisitive. After New York, everyone’s had their own shit to deal with; Pepper’s trying to run a company, Rhodey’s gathering intelligence on whatever it was Tony saw in space, and the Avengers are as scattered as they ever were, a semblance of a team on their best days and a group of near-strangers on their worst.
“—Anyways. I’m calling because I want you to come over for breakfast. And I want you to bring me a fresh pair of clothes, underwear, and some perfume. I bought a twelve-pack from the convenience store, but they’re all granny panties so they’re not even remotely date-approved.”
“I know, miracle of modern menswear, right?  After years of making fantastical messes of myself, we’ve ascertained which fabrics will stand up to a Stark.”  Tony smiles, but Steve notices it doesn’t quite reach his eyes.  “You hungry?  There’re only about a million places around here so geared toward gluttony that even Thor would be shocked.”
Tony waits for Steve to come to him. He has Steve’s answer, but it still feels tenuous. This thing between them is the kind of tension that could snap as easily as it could vibrate and give. He doesn’t want to be the one to break it when it could just have easily bent Steve against him.
In his mind’s eye, every detail of Steve’s appearance seems heightened, as if the rest of the world has gone blurry and soft and Steve is brilliantly defined. Steve’s blond hair is darkened to brown with rain, matted and messy across his forehead until he pushes it back with those long, strangely delicate fingers. Tony can jealously trace the path of each droplet of water running down Steve’s chiseled face, rain caressing the sharp lines of his cheekbones and his strong jaw like Tony’s hands long to do.
“What kind of drug?  Is Steve okay?” Tony asks, turning Rhodey’s words over and over in his mind.  “And wait, what the hell was Bucky doing there?”
if—” Tony breaks off haltingly, a torrent of terrible headlines tumbling through his head. “He’s right, you would never get hired in this town again. That’s just—”
They exit at Eighth Street and make it to Washington Square without incident.  The park is empty of street performers, skateboarders and tourists now, the chess tables abandoned and the dog run closed.  Steve empties his pockets of change for a homeless man slouched on the park bench; Tony gives Steve a look but nevertheless hands the man a twenty. NYU students, loud and carefree, heading out to bars on Bleecker or MacDougal cut across the concrete paths of the park occasionally, but no one lingers.
“You don’t have to say anything you don’t want to.”  Steve assures him, though he suspects he’s as afraid of hearing what Bucky has to say as much as Bucky might be afraid of saying it.
He’s sitting alone at the bar of El Chapultepec, a divey looking Mexican-American Jazz club he let Steve wander them into, when Pepper slides onto the stool beside him.  She doesn’t look at all perturbed over the strange mix of Tex-Mex burritos on the menu and deep down delta blues in the air.
“I only need to borrow Steve for a minute.” He assures Bucky, since Bucky’s the one still staring at him.
Pepper leans forward and kisses his cheek.  He grabs her arm, trying to keep her just a moment longer, and breathes in her familiar, comforting scent.  She deserves so much more than him but he still has a hard time letting go.
“And we always found a pile of dead bodies wherever he popped on the radar.  We never got a good read on the guy.  Just bits and pieces here and there from mostly unreliable sources.  He was like a damn ghost.”  Fury slides the file across the table to Steve.  His hand trembles as he lifts the cover.  He doesn’t want to read this.  “But he’s ours now, and he’s starting to come out of it.”
He can make out her shape against the backlight.  She’s leaning over him.  He occasionally feels sharp tugs on his skin, like his veins are being pulled out.  She’s fumbling with something at his face and the feel of plastic resting against his cheeks goes away, the strange sensation in his nose disappearing.
Steve cries out as he comes first, powerful and messy all over his stomach and chest. His whole body tightens, pulling Bucky closer to him, further into him, and he can feel his insides clench around Bucky, so hard and hot inside him, and then the pulse and shudder deep within as Steve wrenches a long, drawn out orgasm from Bucky. He’s never quite sure if it’s his active imagination or a real sensation, but he swears he feels the wetness and heat of Bucky emptying a load inside of him; he is sure, however, that he feels it when Bucky fucks him through it, come seeping out and catching in Bucky’s pubic hair and dripping down his thighs.
Tony blinks at him owlishly, then nearly busts his gut laughing. It’s enough to draw some attention from the surrounding tables, but Steve doesn’t care.
“You are.” Natasha holds up her hand, cutting him off.  “And you know it.” Bucky casts his gaze down to the floor, refusing to acknowledge how right she is. “You’re the only one around who knows what it was like for Steve before.  You’re best equipped to help him adjust and get through this.”
“Uh, I thought that dude hated us,” Bucky recalls now, probably thinking back to his last house party when L sat in the corner, drinking martinis from a flask and scowling at everyone for three hours straight.  It wouldn’t have been too weird if he’d at least been drawing caricatures or taking notes for his Great American Novel, but there was nothing but staring and scowling.
“Yet if you strip away all the crazy stuff, Tony, at the core of it, it still comes down to one man being in love with two different people and that man needing to make a choice. And despite everything with Bucky, I’m actually confident that Steve would choose you.”
“No, let me get this out.”  Bucky holds up his hand, metal glinting in the light.  “I’ve been needing to say this for ages and since Nat’s clearly decided now’s the time…”
“Sorry, I was just…” He flushes faintly, shoving his hands in his pockets before looking up at the vaulted ceiling, back down the long hallway, clearly taking it all in.  He shuffles his feet nervously on the Oriental rug.  “This place doesn’t really seem like Howard.”
“Well, you know he’s working on that…thing, with the thing and the…” Steve tries, but gives up.  Tony always knows what Bruce is actually working on; to Steve they may as well be speaking a foreign language.  Tony smiles at him, amused by Steve at a loss.
It’s a particular Stark talent, one that occasionally makes an appearance on the business side but shines brightly and often when it comes to personal matters.
“Only if it’s funny,” Tony replies before smiling his way into a kiss that he happily extends as long as possible.
“Can have me now.” Steve reaches down and for the first time wraps his hand on Tony’s cock, giving his entire length a firm stroke.  Tony shudders with arousal, doesn’t miss the fact that Steve does too.
“Hey.”  He greets Bucky quietly as he steps out onto the fire escape, the metal grating rattling slightly.  The night has turned cool.  Bucky exhales a long stream of smoke and holds out his cigarette to Steve wordlessly.  He takes it between two fingers and brings it to his lips.  He stands close enough to Bucky that their arms brush as they both lean against the railing, bent forward with their elbows resting on cold metal.  After his drag, he taps the ash away and hands it back to Bucky.  “They say now that smoking is unhealthy.  Guess it gives you cancer and a whole lot of other nasty things.”
“You were attempting to fix a glitch in the programming software for the climate controls on a clean energy powered sports car?”
Everything in the shower is still damp from Tony’s use of it, and Tony’s bath products are lined up along the ledge of the tub. He casts about the small room for complimentary soap and shampoo; it’s not as if he’s ever stayed in a fancy place like this, but he’s heard tell that these types of things come standard. If they did, Tony’s evidently done away with them already. He’ll have to use Tony’s things.
“How’s our stubborn ass patient doing?” Tony disturbs the quiet, entering the living room with typical bluster. He’s juggling multiple bags and a large box, all from different stores. With a terrific clatter, Tony drops them onto the love seat and the floor when he peers down to find the coffee table is already strewn with detritus.
“Steve Rogers, I’ll love you 'til the day I die,” he whispers, and feels rather than hears Steve lightly laugh against him. One of the first things he did after Steve lost the serum was drop that scene from
“Or the afternoon.”  Tony kisses Steve’s frown, feels it turn into a smile against his lips.  “Or tomorrow night.”
But he’s never seen Steve in a completely unguarded moment, with the mask of Captain America figuratively cast aside, and it catches him entirely off guard.  He leans against the wall and allows himself to scrutinize.  His mind instantly rattles off a list of descriptives – intense, wired, focused, tightly-wound, determined – and they’re all pretty much synonyms for that dark look on Steve’s admittedly handsome face as he beats the ever-living crap out of the punching bag.
“Well now, I don’t know about that. From the look of you, Miss, I daresay you’re the kind who’d just as easily kiss me as kill me.”  He lights his cigarette and carelessly tosses his silver-plated lighter behind him onto his paper-strewn desk. It clinks against a half-empty bottle of bourbon.
Tony pushes off the doorframe and saunters toward him, abandoning his drink on a patio table along the way.  He moves liquidly, languidly, entirely comfortable in his own skin.
“I’m fine, thank you,” Steve says ever so politely, eyes still masked behind those dark lenses, and Tony can only see his own reflection when he looks in them.
His are specially developed skills.  His talents are the only things he knows; he wakes with a self-assured sense that his body is a weapon.  His mind is always working out the best angle for a kill.
The edges of Steve’s words curve softer and slip broader when he brings up Bucky. Tightness eases in his face that Tony hadn’t even realized was there, and the hunch of his broad shoulders loosens.
When the bombshell redhead had opened Steve’s door, Tony had assumed her to be the roommate’s gal, but what he’d seen in Steve’s bedroom made him wonder if Steve and Bucky shared more than a mere apartment. He’s jealous already; wanting to stake a claim he has no right to make.
“I could deal with you and Steve when…god, Tony, I was even happy for you, I was. I swear it. Because
“He does look vaguely familiar,” Natasha comments dryly before extending her hand out to Bruce.  Bruce relaxes a little at Natasha’s reception, their strained history having left him apprehensive.  “It’s good to see you again, Banner.  Been in New York long?”
“Guess I should be glad you’re not a mechanic or I never would’ve caught up with you,” Tony states, still not sure if he’s peeved or concerned about or thrilled with the idea of Steve taking off from New York in the middle of the night without a word to anyone.  “Anyone ever tell you about leaving a note when you take off on your own?
Steve’s jaw tightens in that way it used to when he’d stubbornly refuse Bucky’s help, when he wanted to put up a tough front and prove he could stand up for himself. While he’d seen righteous indignation and staunch determination on Steve’s decidedly more broad and chiseled face in recent years, it’s been ages since he’s seen this particular petulant, defiant edge to Steve’s expression and it makes Bucky’s heart hurt even more.
Tony’s standing in the doorway, leaning against the closed glass with his hand on the knob, poised for a quick exit.
“I always wondered what you’d taste like,” Steve says unthinkingly, an easy truth slipping from his lips while all his defenses are down. “I’ve always wanted to do that, Bucky.”
“Here, please take this.” Tony hands Steve one of his business cards. Steve takes it gingerly. “I’m sure you know that I’m getting into the movie business. I’d like you to give me a call, perhaps we can work together on a project.”
“You know, when someone says they’re cold, they don’t mean ‘can we go outside where it’s even colder?’”  Tony joins him a short while later, wrapped up in a plaid flannel blanket and overdramatically shaking.
Phil stops, and then tiredly looks down at his business attire.  He straightens his navy and maroon striped tie and checks his cuffs, but otherwise finds nothing at fault.
He loses track of himself until the world goes quiet around him.  He pries his eyes open, finds himself staring right at Steve.  Have Steve’s eyes always been so impossibly blue?  When the fuck did that happen?  He’s probably hallucinating.
“That’s always a risk.” Tony admits plainly. He rubs Steve’s arm as Steve involuntarily tenses. “All of us can talk about it together, tomorrow, okay? Tonight, it’s you and me.”
They’re both wearing mostly black; Steve’s learned over the past few weeks that that’s just what they usually do.  But they’re casual, not on the job: Clint has on a plain black tee and a pair of dark jeans.  Natasha has on a rather short black skirt, black hose, and a maroon tank.  They both slip on heavily tinted sunglasses and leave Steve goofily squinting at them against the backdrop of the setting sun.
He lets Steve go.  He stands silently and waits until Steve is long out of sight before doing anything.
“Do you have any plans for your birthday?  It’s only a few days away.” Phil is asking of Steve when Tony comes back to the conversation.  He’d briefly paused to wow the geeky pair of Fitz-Simmons with the astute scientific observations he’d still somehow managed to make while under fire.  Beside Coulson, Agent Ward snorts derisively at the level of swooning currently underway.
“Mr. Stark, forgive me, but you’re not allowed to go off on your own. Insurance liability, you must understand.” Thomas is simpering over something, but it barely registers. Until the man scampers in front of him, waving his hands. “Is there some place you would like to go? I would be happy to take you.”
are you doing down here?”  Tony gasps, gesturing wildly to the pile of broken glass that sits in the center of the room.  The pane he just smashed was about the tenth of the night but it was the first he’d dropped unintentionally.   “JARVIS said…Jesus Christ…” Tony leans against the wall, near collapse.
“That was nothing compared to the trading cards, sir.”  She doesn’t wait to be dismissed before walking away.  Fury doesn’t try to stop him and Bruce from leaving either.
Tony waves him off and approaches Steve with a confident smile. He’s wearing a gray double-breasted suit that’s tailored perfectly to his lithe frame, his shirt crisply ironed and ivory white, and his black tie held straight with a beautifully designed ruby and gold tack. His black shoes are polished to a high shine; a deep red pocket square caps off the ensemble with a bright dash of color. He doesn't wear a hat; his dark brown hair is impeccably styled.
After dropping the paper into the trash, Steve flexes his hands, palms stinging. The burns he received yesterday pulling crewmen from the wreckage of their ship are mostly healed now, but the skin still feels tender.
“So…Thor, tell me again why is your brother doing a magic show on a Thursday night?”  Clint and Thor move next, as Thor is quite the barrier for anyone else looking to get out.
“What does he want?”  Natasha looks like she enjoys Fury’s news about as much as Steve does.  She hasn’t been impressed with Stark’s antics of late either.
They lean toward one another, lips about to meet, when someone pounds on Steve’s trailer door, three thumps hard enough to rattle the thin door and shake the entire wall.
“Just through here.” Tony pushes open the door and flips on the light before the awkwardness hits him. He glances around his bedroom quickly, relieved to find it rather clean and presentable, and then shoots Steve what he hopes comes across as an innocent look. He points to the telephone sitting on his nightstand in explanation.
“Well.  Guess I must be special.” Bucky tugs on the handcuffs with a frown, and then twists toward the door.  One of the guards is still standing there, perfectly stoic.  “Y’know, it’s kinda bullshit that they didn’t have someone in here about three seconds after you woke up.  You’ve been down for a week, I’d think Captain America waking up would be a big deal.”
Steve follows him out of the bedroom, stopping just outside the doorway to the dressing room. Tony pulls a clean pair of boxers from the dresser and slips them on, snapping the elastic at his waist.
Natasha slinks in between Clint and Tony, as always having a sixth sense about where she needs to be.
“Can you catch up to their helicopter?”  Tony turns to Thor, whose frown is deep and his usually joyful eyes sad.
“Don’t you think in the lower register she sounds like Aimee Mann…like, if Aimee Mann weren’t miserable?”
“Freak the fuck out?” Tony never has believed in silence.  “Strangely enough, I haven’t felt one bit anxious tonight.  At first I thought it was just because Bruce and I smoked up this afternoon-“
“Eh, he actually hasn’t, but it’s only a matter of time.”  Tony hops up on the counter next to Steve’s pumpkin, swinging his legs back and forth, heels thumping the lower cabinets.  He has a bag of popcorn that he must have grabbed from the cupboard, and he pops three pieces into his mouth before grinning at Steve.  “I’ll wear you down, you know it’s pointless to resist.”
He glances at Pepper, guilty, and moves away from the window.  He goes to the bar and fixes himself a bourbon.  He pours Pepper one too; she secretly likes the hard stuff when paperwork is giving her a headache.
Steve sits as the sun goes down, and remains there in the sweeping half-darkness of headlights, spotlights, city lights, and moonlight until the sun creeps back over the horizon and washes it all out into daylight.
“But we’re not talking about the film anymore, are we? That was just flattery for flattery’s sake. You need to be flattered more often if you’re still so unwilling to believe it.”
“Still looks pretty much the same though, doesn’t it?” Tony grins like he’s proud of himself for even thinking of it.  “C’mon.  You can afford it now.  You’ll have to borrow a jacket though, I hope they have something in Adonis-size.”
He barely holds it together if he thinks about taking Steve in his arms to dance, or the way Steve’s hand felt in his as Steve looked up, wondrous and beautiful, at the Chihuly ceiling in Vegas.  In those moments all he wanted to do was give Steve the world.
Success being Steve.  And him.  In Oklahoma.   He doesn’t know how to do this, whatever this is that he’s doing.
“We’ve never officially met, but yes, hello, Captain.”  Pepper gives Tony a strange, suspicious look and shrugs off his over eager greeting.  She offers her hand to Steve, exuding that welcoming warmth that Tony treasures her for.
The wrist Tony had been holding is pinned back against the wall, but his other free hand fixes a grip on Tony’s waist, fingers digging in and pressing Tony closer.  He’s shocked by how good this feels, like it’s something he’s been wanting all along.  Maybe he has.
Bucky remains with him the rest of the evening, watching over him as the doctors run their tests and check his vitals.  He only leaves when he’s no longer given the choice to stay.
“Steve…” Bucky sighs, voice trembling, and Steve can only nod breathlessly in agreement with the underlying sentiment.  When Bucky opens his eyes, they both glance down to where their bodies are joined. Steve quivers at the sight and feel of Bucky’s body pressed into and against his.
When he reaches his destination, Steve leans on the top of the upright piano, resting his elbows on the polished wood surface. He looks down at Sam as his fingers dance nimbly over the black and white keys.
“His itinerary shows no such alterations, sir.  Would you like me to contact Dr. Banner and request his immediate return?”
He coughs, the sound of it echoing across the cavernous space, and Steve turns toward him, startled. Steve colors. Tony smirks.
There is a small, heart-shaped birthmark on his forearm. His left tibia had in fact been broken at a young age; this remodeling is evident in current x-rays. Evidently, this injury was from a fall down the front staircase of his apartment building.
call and before he even hits acknowledge Natasha’s already out of the bedroom, pulling on an outfit as she goes.
“Fuck you, NKOTB was amazing.”  Natasha’s words have no heat, however, and her flat tone leaves Steve guessing if she really means it or not.  Months later, he still has no idea if she went to that concert to enjoy it or mock it.  “You have a cigarette?” She asks Clint, who obligingly flips open his pack of American Spirits and thumbs one up for her to take.
“He’s mine,” Bucky whispers against Tony’s neck. He moves his mouth to Tony’s ear, teeth tugging on the lobe as he says it again. “He’s mine.” Tony is still thrusting inside Steve even as Bucky says it, Steve gasping in pleasure.
Except Steve’s been a little off since Thursday night – it’s not anything that Tony thinks anyone would notice except for him.  It’s like he’s 90% here, and a tiny sliver of his thoughts are elsewhere.
“Bucky, why don’t we—“ Tony is trying to calm him now, and Bucky grits his teeth, curls his hands into tight fists as he strains to hold back the tumult of emotion desperately trying to break through.
? ‘Whatever shakes out’?” Steve spits. There’s only anger on his face now, his fine, delicate features turning pinched and sharp. “What kind of person do you think I am?”
“No, I’ll be happy to have it in the rearview.” Steve admits. “Lensherr has been awful and Stark hasn’t been around to rein him in. He made Wanda cry yesterday, if you can believe that.” Steve rubs his eyes, feeling tired. God, had that only been yesterday? The last two weeks have felt like a year gone by.
Bucky rears back and storms to the elevator.  The car isn’t waiting around this time and he swears under his breath, punching at the air.
Tony exchanges a look with Steve, both of them reluctantly agreeing that their little sexual stay-cation has come to an abrupt but unavoidable end.
It’s hours too late and well after dark by the time he slips into his and Pepper’s shared bedroom.  He hasn’t packed up her things, because they never officially ended it, but he knows what awaits him now because it’s the only option he left her.
“Just…answer me one thing.  What is bothering you more?  A) Barnes is a brainwashed assassin, B) He doesn’t remember you, or C) He remembers Natasha?”
Tony lifts his head to press a kiss to Steve’s temple, soft and sweet, and then settles back down to the pillows.
Happy is looking at him, eyebrows arched, but after all these years the man’s learnt not to ask.  Tony shrugs anyway, grunting.
“Buck…Bucky, it’s okay…” Steve squeezes Bucky’s hand, tries to reach for him, wanting nothing more than to get his friend’s attention.  Tubes and cords tether him to machines though, and he can’t move how he wants to.  One of the men unfolds his hands and opens the door, and with a put upon frown exchanges a long look with his counterpart before exiting the room.   The other man readjusts his stance and refolds his hands, fixing his gaze firmly on Bucky.
Steve breaks their kiss to again bury his face against Tony’s neck, surprising himself by biting the juncture of his shoulder when Tony clenches tight around his cock. Tony’s whole body violently seizes up at the sensation of Steve’s teeth breaking his skin; he comes untouched, throwing his head back against the mirror hard enough to shatter the glass. Steve’s helpless against the force of Tony’s orgasm, Tony’s body milking him for all he’s got.
“Fine.” Natasha tosses the towel onto the messy counter, ridding her hands of him. The rest of the spilt coffee seeps and spreads through the fabric immediately, staining the creamy white to an ugly brown.
“Tony, I think I’m in –“ Steve shouts, but then a line of code shifts on the screen and he frowns.  “No, now I’m not.  The connection was lost.”
“You still can,” Steve whispers, resting their foreheads together as he struggles to catch his breath. His hands fumble with Tony’s belt. Tony’s reaching for Steve’s pants before he can even consider the repercussions.
"Marrying you. You asked, remember?" Yawning the engineer seemed to drift off. "It seems like a good idea."
"And if he is mean again, you can bury him in snow for a few minutes. I give permission. But no more revenge for now."
"He was pretty quick to pick a fight at first too", Steve said. "But no one is born evil. I, at least, refuse to believe so."
While neither man could understand the words themselves, they could easily see what was wrong. A little while before Thor came and everyone found out, except him, Pepper had gifted the boy a set with Avengers action figures. While Loki had no idea his parents were Avengers, he had still loved the figures. The set had also included an action figure of his adult self.
Although once the movie was finished he insisted on jumping around saying he was a tigger. That only stopped when the soldier reminded his son that there was only one tigger. Loki then started pretending he was Christopher Robin instead. Which was less chaotic at least.
This was Steve's? Tony paused at a drawing of himself. It was way more detailed than the ones before. Turning more pages he realised there was an abundance of drawings depicting him. From all sort of situations. Him brooding, him laughing, him dropping something, him excited. He had had no idea the soldier was watching him this much. It was rather flattering.
The soldier followed the engineer obediently. His mind racing. Without thinking he threw his arms around the other, holding him close. Shaking. Tony didn't say anything and just hugged him back. After a few minutes Steve managed to compose himself.
Picking out books from the small, private library, Thor had the idea that Loki could teach Loki. Through his own books that he had written throughout the centuries.
He had just taken a shower and gotten dressed when a small knock came on his door. Cautiously he opened it. First he couldn't see anyone but then he saw something move and looked down. A small boy with Raven black hair and vivid green eyes looked up at him. The boy took hold of his pants, pulling slightly while pointing down the corridor.
Loki babbled something and the engineer laughed. "Sure, Lo. You can have a small package of cereal."
"Seriously?" Tony looked incredulous. "That's the kind of stories you have told our kid? I know my Norse Mythology, you know. I know what happened to your brother at the end of that story."
"Thank you, Jarv. See, Brucie Bear. No harm, no foul. We told Loki to avoid making you angry, so he was probably careful."
"Is it done yet?" Tony asked for the twentieth time in just as many minutes. Bruce, looking quite done with the billionaire, sighed.
"Seems like a diaper change is in order", his boyfriend said. "And then maybe it is time for a snack."
The engineer felt his heart ache. Maybe that Loki had been different but when he tried to imagine it, all he could picture was his own son.
"I wouldn't want someone else to touch me either", Steve kissed the engineer, trying to convey his love.
That decided, he pressed the button to the elevator, entered, and pushed the number for uncle Bucky's floor. He liked his uncle Bucky. They would play a lot and he was given treats. Knocking on the door, because Papa said it was important to do so, he waited expectantly. Then he knocked again.
"Why are you holding a kid?" A very filthy child was nestled in the blond's arms and Steve looked apologetic.
"What do you mean? I remember Loki being really excited but no one I spoke to seemed to have heard of it."
Delighted his nephew sat down and went to work. The two older kids saw the setup and joined in. Calming down considerably. They sat like that for a while. There was a noticeable difference between the kids. Cooper was sloppy and painted in a harsh way, going through paper after paper of just colour being added. Lila was more measured, making fields with flowers, horses, and tiny houses. Even so, she would start over on a new paper every time she thought she had made a mistake.
"I don't know... Fury mentioned setting me up in an apartment... I... I couldn't come up with an excuse and..."
This meant that they acted like nothing around the others. Cold and polite, with some banter thrown in. Yet, at every opportunity he got, the soldier would sneak up to the penthouse. Spend as much time as he could with Tony. Wishing constantly he could stay longer. JARVIS helped them, of course. Letting them know if someone was coming and all that.
"Speaking off", the engineer said. "Did you find anything about how this happened in the first place?"
"Daddy?" The engineer blinked and looked at the edge of the bed. Loki had his arms up, waiting expectantly. Clearing his throat he lifted the boy up on the bed. Receiving a very amused look from the soldier.
The Thunderer paused. He had been given a chance to be in Loki's life again. Stark and Rogers had trusted him and the other two to look after a child they treasured. Yet, what had he done? Screamed at the boy, being so forceful that he caused a meltdown. Making the child cry and wail in misery. Because he couldn't listen.
Looking through the cabinets Tony was starting to get agitated. Where was his coffee? He had bought a big package not too long ago and poured it into a tin. But the tin box had been empty for some reason. Something crunched under his shoes and he looked down, wondering if he had stepped on a bug. Instead there were black speckles. Which at first freaked him out because it could still be bugs. Then he recognised the smell, and remembered what had happened the night before.
"Steve..." he was pulled down for a kiss, pushing them both over the edge. They didn't stop there, of course. It was rare that they had time for more than a quickie after Loki had been put to bed. Their son would quite often come and ask to sleep with them. And they just couldn't help but let him.
Okay, that was on purpose. The engineer had looked for a good place where they could just be themselves. Sipping his drink, he tapped his foot to the 80s pop playing. It was a very fruity drink but there wasn't a whole lot of alcohol in it. His husband had an arm around his waist, occasionally giving him a kiss.
"I..." the engineer cleared his throat. "I don't know quite what this is yet but... well, I want it."
It was music to his ears, listening to Bird Brain being berated and scolded by his wife. She had even rolled up a newspaper and was hitting him with it. Barton was more or less taking it, trying to ward himself with his arms as the paper roll hit him. Tony took up his phone, intending to film the whole thing, when he saw he had been sent another video. Texting JARVIS to record the scolding instead he opened the video. Watching with a frown.
"Agreed", Steve said and smiled when the god of mischief ran up to him. "Hey, buddy. Sorry we weren't there when you woke up from a nightmare. You can have snack later before dinner."
Because it was true. He was a man out of time. Not truly belonging anywhere. There was no way back, and he had no idea how he would find his way forward. Right now, all he had was heartache as he longed for a brilliant and mischievous engineer with an unexpected big heart.
"This kind of all-compassing, selfless, love. Paper or no paper. This is my son. Our son. It doesn't matter that it is Loki. It doesn't matter what happened before. He is
"I could do a medical check-up on him if you want", the scientist offered. "I got some experience and it couldn't harm him, right?"
"Yay! Uncle Bucky!" Rushing to the elevator their son was full of excitement. Melting their hearts with his cuteness. "Bye bye, Papa, Daddy! I go now!"
"He is that, isn't he", Tony chuckled wetly. "He certainly crawled his way into our hearts effortlessly."
"Basically a kiss mark. Steve really likes kissing my neck during sex, so he tends to leave marks. No biggie."
Now they were at a playground. Surrounded by moms and their children. The tiny Trickster having a blast.
Inside the box were two watches. They looked about the same, just slightly different sizes, made of metal. Looking closer Tony noticed that the dial had been engraved with
"Hydra in SHIELD... they planned on eliminating every threat against them in one swoop. Tony... your parents... it was Hydra..."
"We could ask, but we wouldn't be able to understand his answer", Tony said, still holding their son. "We can usually figure out what he wants but he isn't exactly talking English."
"To some SHIELD facility." Because of course it was SHIELD. They were sometimes way too shady. "Keep up the good work, doc."
"De läskit. Gilla inte va ensam", the boy answered. Unfortunately, as always, the blond couldn't understand the words. But he had an inclination of what it was about.
The blond paused. He then took of his watch and placed it in the billionaire's hand. "This is my promise to come back. Keep it safe for me until you can return it."
Superhumans cannot just be. They cannot just exist. They need oversight; they need to be controlled. They are not people. They are dangerous weapons.
When Steve steps out of the cab and sees the familiar line of colorful jockeys lining the wrought iron balcony, he doesn’t know whether to be amused or offended.  He grabs Tony by the elbow, stopping him from going down the small flight of stairs to the entrance.
“Tony,” Pepper says warningly, in way she hasn’t had to in a very long time. Not since he started dating Steve, anyway.
“Isn’t it?” Steve replies softly. “Tony’s my first serious romantic relationship, Buck, so it’s not like I have everything figured out. I didn’t think this would be me either, but…who knows who I am, when it comes to this? What I do know is that I’m not a coward, and that I feel so strongly for you both, and Tony…” Steve loses his nerve and averts his gaze from Bucky as he gets this out. “I mean, he says that’s okay. He wants me to go wherever this takes us.”
Someday, Tony will pleasure Steve in front of a mirror – double-wide, full length, maybe three-way – just to make Steve watch how devastatingly gorgeous his body is, how immaculate.  He’ll show him that there’s more to his physical perfection than duty and obligation; that there are things meant for only Steve’s personal benefit.
“Lead the way.” Steve tips his head in the direction of the hotel. The tunnel ahead isn’t pitch black; every twenty paces or so, a bare bulb emergency light fixture casts a small pool of light. But the Chateau is far enough away, the pathway disappearing around a curve to the left, that the exit is currently something to be imagined and not seen.
“The kind of person who would stay with me out of duty, even if you would rather be with Barnes.” Tony replies without even thinking about it, the truth simply
“You with me?”  Steve asks, and there it is, Captain voice directed at him.  It’s already helping.  “Take deep breaths, try to match mine.”  Steve inhales and exhales exaggeratedly, one hand firm on Tony’s shoulder and the other flat and steady against his abdomen.  “Try to control it, push my hand out from your body when you inhale.”
“I don’t…ok, look.” Tony’s hands reach out for Steve of their own volition and Steve pulls himself back. Tony backs off, shaking his head. “Look, it’s…If we get discovered, I’ll be fine. I can make it fine. For me. But even with all my money, I can’t make it fine for you. Look at all the press, the attention you’re getting just when they think you’re Jan’s new boy toy. Can you
He also looks up at Steve like he wouldn’t be averse to taking off the rest of his clothes, and all of Steve’s too.
These days his nightmares are occasionally broken up by magnificent dreams of flying, shooting across the bright blue, cloudless sky at breakneck speeds as he expertly takes down threat after threat.  He always lands next to Cap on some broad brick walkway in Battery Park, Statue of Liberty standing vigil beyond him in the harbor.  And just as Steve turns to him, winded but smiling, his blonde hair glinting golden in the sunlight, Tony wakes up.
“Attention on the fight, less chatter, team,” Cap interrupts sternly, but Tony’s already pinpointed the location of Bucky’s comm signal.  The sniper is on the roof of the Herald Square building itself.
“Bucky…what are you doing here?” Steve’s voice cracks and he moves back from Tony.  He wipes his lips and adjusts the waistline of his jeans, trying to make his erection less noticeable.  It doesn’t work.
“I got her,” she says softly as she peels Jan from Tony’s arms. Jan clings to him, whining, but eventually goes.
There’s enough on his plate right now without piling on his own issues.  It’d be better to forget Stark entirely and move on, yet that now seems an impossibility.
“You’re a liar, Tony Stark.” Pepper uncrosses and re-crosses her legs, then folds her hands primly over one knee.
Steve’s cowl is pushed back and he looks like there are a lot of things he really wants to say.  He opts for putting a hand over Tony’s shoulder, patting the dented curve of metal like he’s simply too tired to do anything else.
“I walk.  A lot.”  He takes the book from Tony’s hands, letting it fall back open to the drawing of the church.  He traces a finger gently over the intricate French Gothic architecture, careful not smudge the lines.  “This was always one of my favorite places.  It wasn’t my church, I didn’t go there to worship religiously…It was just to…”
“Everything’s fine.” Tony smiles tightly. The last thing he wants to get into right now is an argument with his old girlfriend about his current love life, especially when his current love life is potentially expanding to include another person. Another person who has been calling him ever since take-off, and who Tony may or may not be actually ready to talk to.
“Am I allowed to ask what about?”  His stomach is slowly tightening and sinking at the same time, leaving him with a nagging feeling sitting low in his gut.
Tony is jarred from his thoughts by Pepper’s soft voice.  He hadn’t heard her walk up.  He glances at her over his shoulder and then goes back to staring at the sculpture recently installed in the atrium of the lobby.
“Geez, Buck…” Steve mutters, frowning as he sets down his pen and then bends to pick up the newspaper from where it tumbled onto the ground.  He curses the black smudges on his formerly pristine drawing that the newsprint left in its wake.  Steve pushes back from his drafting desk and swivels to look at his best friend, feeling decidedly unfriendly at the moment.  “That was two hours work.”
“Always the nurse, Ma,” Steve whispers to himself, almost out of habit.  It was a frequent reply of his, both lovingly fond and exasperated.
angry – he pulls himself in, winding tight and going dangerously quiet. Bucky doesn’t make people feel badly. He makes them scared.
“Doesn’t matter where, we should be back tomorrow.”  JARVIS locks on.  They’re just outside of Graz.  “There’s been a slight situation.”
a coward for turning it down – too afraid of going back, too afraid of life in the spotlight, and maybe too afraid to wrap his future so closely up with Tony’s, when all is said and done.
“This isn’t going as smoothly as I’d hoped.” He admits. “I have the start up capital, maybe I should have gone ahead and built my own backlot, bought all new equipment. That’s what I get for listening to Coulson. Minimizing risk, my ass.” Tony sticks his hands in his pockets and takes a long, surveying look over the P.I.’s office that Steve just left.
“That’s horseshit!”  Again, Steve is shocked by Tony’s outburst.  “Fury, you’re a grade-A first class asshole if you think you can drag Steve in here, tell him his best friend is miraculously alive,
It’d be easier on Steve’s body to take him on his knees like this, but after Tony gets up to three fingers and starts to nudge his cock against Steve’s ass, Steve shakes his head no. He flips over, hooking his hands under his knees and pulling his legs back and apart.
“Not much time for Google.”  Steve sets his untouched glass of milk on the end table and crosses his arms over his chest.  “Thus far I’ve helped defend the earth from a loony demigod and his army, and then went for shawarma.  That’s really about it.”
Steve reaches for the business card, wanting this conversation to be over, but he can’t get it without rudely invading Darcy’s space and outright snatching it from her hand.
part he played in the whole thing.  How very little he really had to do with what Captain America became.”
The music isn’t coming from the record player, however, which Tony realizes means Steve must be busy doing something dirty with his hands.  It’s the only time he opts for the iPod dock over vinyl while at home.
The air is musty with the smell of film developer and fixer and Tony wonders about the ventilation situation in here for a moment before Bruce speaks again, distracting him from trying to locate all the fans and ducts and airshafts.
“Would you like some orange juice?” He’s already filling her a glass.  The coffee’s going to be a minute.
There’s a compliment for him in there along with the old-fashioned modesty and cautious phrasing but Tony decides not to dig it out.  It’s easier to let it lie.  Steve lifts the edge of his shirt to dry off his face and Tony’s focus snaps downward to the exposed skin, to the set of sculpted abs that are a permanent fixture of Steve’s perfect physique.  It’s a mixture of self-conscious jealousy and a bit of admiration, not lust, which makes his mind go blank.
“So.” Steve repeats, not looking up. He links his index finger through the handle of his cup and pulls it toward him, but doesn't pick it up. Tony sits back in his chair, one arm slung over the back and his legs spread open lazily. He hopes he looks casual, unbothered.
“Oh, Scotty boy is sparks on this? I didn’t get that memo.” Dugan sounds pleasantly surprised; Scott Lang had been the best gaffer in the business until he got sent up the river a few years back. His crime had been a noble one, exposing some union leaders for ripping off thousands of dollars from below-the-line workers through pumped up fees and dues, but the way he’d achieved his goals had involved some less-than-legal breaking & entering followed by some light thieving.
“Why would you read about that ever?” Clint is more dismayed than puzzled.  “Whatever it is, it sounds awful.”
There’s a long pause, and Tony can only imagine what Bucky is saying. Pepper keeps her face carefully schooled, giving nothing away.
“I’ve been wanting to do this since the beginning.  There’s never been any doubt about what I wanted.  Just what I should do about it.”
“I…” Bruce ducks his head sheepishly, sticking his hands in his pockets. “I do have a lot of ideas. More, even, than what I have there.” He nods toward the stack of papers behind Tony.
They’re only 25, so Steve tries not to think about the future too much.  After all, it’d taken all of college for him and Tony to even progress beyond casually hanging out and screwing around and into a real, defined,
because he’s still not sure if Tony has entirely forgiven him for not realizing the difference between the mask and the man right off the bat.
“Fuck me,” Steve whispers, the words giving him a thrill, and pulls Bucky back down to him as Bucky starts to move, shallowly at first. Their foreheads rest together and their lips brush in promise of a kiss that doesn’t come, both of them too overwhelmed to do anything but share breath and stare into one another’s eyes.
“A couple more glasses of booze and maybe I’ll tell ya.” Jan holds Bucky’s gaze as she picks up the bottle of wine and refills his glass.
“I’ve always known my own mind, Tony.  I want you.”  Tony’s body betrays him, hopelessly shuddering when he feels Steve hard and hot between his legs, Steve rolling his hips ever so slightly to make sure Tony
like that about him, but it’s easier to enjoy when Steve’s bluntly challenging someone else, like Fury or Hill.
At least he counts some of his friends among his immediate crew members, a band that stayed together after they returned from the war and hadn’t a clue what to do with their lives. Steve had been their leader in battle, and somehow when back stateside they all just followed him here and asked him to keep right on leading.
“It’s not like you’ve never done it.” Steve mutters, the double standard rubbing him the wrong way even when he knows Bucky’s exactly right. He’d never pay a dame for a night; that’s never been a thing he considered honorable for a man to do.
“We’re on our feet all day, the dang fool,” Dugan mutters around a mouthful of chicken as Steve turns and ambles away.
And while he hasn’t known Tony long, he highly doubts that this is what Tony will want when the shine has worn off and his head has cleared. Any Stark is too good a businessman to let the bedroom interfere with the boardroom. No one at Tony’s company would be happy with a movie serial has-been in a starring role for a major motion picture.
“Maybe sometime,” Bucky says, drawing his arms in around himself a bit protectively.  Steve looks at Natasha, expecting her to jump in the conversation anytime now, but finds her intently focused on carving, brows knit in consternation.
“Just hired her, actually. You two aren’t together anymore?” Bruce looks at him, reluctant, and Tony comes to his own conclusion based on the observable facts. “Well, I suppose if you were still together, you would have known that I hired her.”
“What triggered it?” Natasha asks Betty as they watch Bruce’s lab get thoroughly trashed.  To Steve, it seems more like the Hulk is throwing a temper tantrum than trying to hurt anyone; apart from looking their way once and letting out a single roar, he’s mostly confined himself to ripping apart the room.
“Guess we’ll save our game for later.”  Steve finishes re-setting the chess pieces before carefully setting the board aside.
Steve hesitates, tossing one look Tony’s way but then turning his gaze back toward the ocean. He coughs instead of replying to Tony’s question, and reverts back to their previous line of discussion.
Without the studio lights on and the entire cast and crew present, the soundstage tends to be cooler than outside. The facility’s ceiling is so high and the room so cavernous and empty that when he first arrives in the morning, it can actually be downright chilly. But by one in the afternoon, the sun has warmed the metal roof and walls, and the heat of the day has seeped in enough to make the air seem stale and oppressive.
Jan was more than understanding and would be arriving on her own shortly, a flurry of expensive fur and sparkling diamonds. Wanda looks stunning herself, dressed in a sleek black evening gown, satin gloves and mink stole. She’s dripping in jewelry and her red hair cascades down her shoulders in perfect curls.
“Take a seat.” Tony gestures to the six rows of lush red velvet seating of the small home theater as he turns back to find Steve just walking through the door. He pauses at the threshold, momentarily taken aback.
A familiar cologne wafts toward him, silently announcing Tony’s presence, and Steve breathes it in along with the icy December air.
"At least it was the last show of the run.  I had someone over there to fix that huge hole in the stage by the next morning, they should be back in tip-top shape before
Anyone else would’ve been puzzled, but Natasha looks at him like that’s the least interesting thing he’s ever said.
“Better?”  He whispers, dropping his head down and resting his chin against the top of her head.  Her hair smells like orchids; its color still reminds him of blood.
“You speak the truth.” Bucky claps him on the shoulder, and then wrinkles his nose, wiping his hand down the front of his suit coat. “You’re disgusting. Running to the stars again?”
“’Sleeping with someone’ means something different now, Cap,” Natasha says.  He hadn’t meant to think aloud, but he supposes he must have.  He fights his blush and goes with it because he can’t really pretend he didn’t say it.
“That actually kind of hurt, Pep.”  Tony scratches his eyebrow with his thumb and leans his head back against the wall, closing his eyes against the beginnings of a headache.
Pepper levels him with a scornful stare, the one that just dares him to treat her like an idiot again.
“Was Barnes in on this?”  Clint asks, whipping toward the unconscious man and pulling an arrow, as if Barnes might be faking and will rise to attack them soon as their backs are turned.  Natasha shakes her head, grabs Clint’s arm and turns him back.  The truth is dawning across her face and Tony wishes she’d say it already, whatever it is.  “Nat, what’s wrong.”
Tony pulls back just enough to speak, resting his forehead against Steve’s and drawing only the breath necessary to say what he needs to say.
“You never really punched Hitler in the face, either, did you.”  Tony lowers his voice joke-conspiratorially.  Steve blanches.
“Really, Rhodey?” Tony jumps up from his seat at the grand piano and crosses toward Jim and Carol, who had entered the parlor side by side, holding hands. “Carol! Finally?”
“Um…” Steve’s hand goes to the back of his neck and the action is so familiar that Tony hates himself a little for how much he loves it.  “I’ve been back since yesterday.  I thought you knew.”
The teakettle is near boiling, steam billowing in front of Steve’s face, but the man keeps staring intently into space.
After a few minutes of that, he goes about getting himself together. He makes a checklist in his mind: smooth the hair, straighten the bowtie, fix the buttons on his vest. He runs the tap as cold as it will go and bends to splash his face.
Tony could press that to his advantage, and maybe he would have, if a flash of light hadn’t jarred him and distracted him for a moment just long enough for Steve to pause for breath.
All four guys sneak glances at one another, unsure which one of them will be willing to go along with Nat this time.  Tony figures it will be Steve, as it’s almost always Steve.  He’s the only one who finds dance performance moderately interesting, even going so far as to take one of Natasha’s classes once.  Dance may be Nat’s profession, but Tony came to the conclusion early on that being her friend only required attending anything she was actually
Steve thuds face first back into his pillow, his groan muffled against the fabric. When he’d come home to an empty apartment this morning, he should never have assumed Bucky to be out and about in his usual Saturday routine. From Bucky’s tone, it sounds like he’s going to get a tongue lashing the likes of which he hasn’t heard since before his mother passed years ago.
He fully intends to walk back home but stops somewhere near the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The wooden planks rattle as cars rumble by beneath his feet, their drivers not even aware of his presence above their heads.  He remembers this feeling – knowing the bridge is stable yet
JARVIS shuts off the holo on his own, evidently throwing in his own two cents as to what should rate Tony’s undivided attention at this moment.
“Thank god, Pepper,” he can’t help but say aloud.  “Pep, Pepper, my love, my beauty, good morning, wonderful to see you.”  He stands up quickly and clumsily, practically racing to her.  “You know Captain America, don’t you?”
“Makeup artist? She specializes in those monster movies, so I’m still not sure why you asked for her.” Tony isn’t sure either. Pepper huffs, knowing what his continued silence means. “Thaddeus Ross is a bigwig over at Universal?”
“Wouldn’t want to mess that up for you,” Tony grunts. Rhodey puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“No, I should be the one apologizing – couldn’t even give you a run for your money.”  Bruce puts his hands over his knees and pushes up, standing and vacating his seat for anyone else who might be up to the challenge.  He sits down on the armrest of Betty’s chair and she idly slides her hand across his lower back as he slips his arm loosely around her shoulders.  Steve envies how comfortable they seem with one another.  Even with all their history, all that went wrong and could yet go wrong, it’s clear they’re still in love.
“Go to sleep, Rogers,” she cuts him off, her body nestling closer to his.  Such a short time ago he would’ve been hard pressed to believe he’d be holding a woman like Natasha in his arms, much less doing so and not feeling anything but comfortable, but that’s how it is.
“You want him in you?” Bucky asks Steve over Tony’s shoulder, breath panting hot against the inviting curve of Tony’s neck. “You want him to fuck you?” Bucky pulls at Tony’s dick, thumbing the head as he twists his wrist on the upward stroke. Tony shudders and groans but tries to focus on Steve through the intense wave of pleasure, tries to read his reaction to Bucky’s words. “
Tony gives her a half-hearted smirk.  Pepper slides a hand down his back, moving in a gentle circle as she peers at him through the fringe of her bangs.
"I believe that when I see it", Clint said, crossing his arms and glaring at the now quiet child. "Is there something else you have been hiding from us?"
I have joined a sort of theatre workshop that meets every Wednesday evening. It has been a long time since I did anything like it. But while it is a lot of fun, it is also tiring. You need a lot of focus and is very physical. Both times now I've been down for the count once I come home.
"What do you want, Little One?" That was Thor. Thor scared him. The big god could suddenly become very angry and start yelling at him. Looking like he was made of thunder that was about to burst. For all that he could appear calm and mild, it just made him more terrifying for a small child.
"Alright, Mischief. One leg here, and one leg here", Tony pointed, hoping it would be enough. Loki looked at him and at the diaper. Then he... actually did what he had been told. Allowing the engineer to pull it up.
"He demanded to know if Loki felt any regret for his actions. If he understood how much he had disgraced the house of Odin." The god of thunder shook his head. "Loki refused to give a proper answer. Just saying he owed the house of Odin nothing and that he felt as much regret for his actions as Father did for his. Such foolishness. And so ungrateful."
"Oh, it will be alright, dear. Up you go. When did you lose sight of your dad?" Laura convinced the child to stand up and using a wet wipe she cleaned up his face a bit. All while listen to the halting story. Getting angry. What kind of adults just leave a child on their own? Especially childcare workers!
"Okay, soldier. What happened?" Instead of answering the blond handed him a piece of paper. The engineer read it, and then read it again. "...when do you have to leave?"
Tony was waiting for him in their bedroom, patting the bed. The soldier smiled and laughed lightly. Changing quickly and brushing his teeth he then crawled in under the covers. With winter approaching, it was becoming a bit cold. His husband scooted closer, resting against him. One hand went under his sleep shirt, tracing his muscles.
I had four commissions to write yesterday day and both my computers decided to work against me (I got an unused laptop from my mom, it is a bit old and can't handle a lot but it works. So now I have both a desktop and a laptop). My Internet was slow and spotty, websites wouldn't load properly, and was soo slow. In addition my keyboard and computer mouse decided to act up as well.
Tony had already driven several smaller publications near bankruptcy. In his opinion, they deserved it. Especially after calling Loki some very unsavoury things. No one hurt his kid and got away with it. None.
"Hey, Loki, come here for a moment." The boy, still eyeing Thor with obvious suspicion, hurried over to his other father. Grabbing hold of his leg instead. Ruffling his hair the inventor showed a page. "Can you read this?"
That wasn't just being familiar, they seemed to unconsciously understand the words of the small Trickster. A mystery. Just like it was a mystery why Loki was a child at all. Especially since he, according to Thor, was supposed to be dead. Yet, here he was. The examination had confirmed that he was very much just a child right now.
Tony's eyes widened and he hurriedly picked up their son in his arms, trying to shield the child and backing away. He wouldn't be able to do anything though. Swiftly Steve put himself between the furious Thunderer and his family. Holding out a hand, stopping him.
"What else would you call a society that settles everything with violence and think it is fine to behead people?"
"Because it lower inhibitions from what I can tell. Depending on how it is used, it can cause a lot of problems."
"Do you really think you could have the patience to teach? Loki likes to learn but he is still a child. He can get distracted and become bored." The soldier said.
"There is no way we can try to return him to Asgard", the soldier bit his lip. "I don't think we should do that anyway. We have no idea what they would do to him and in this state..."
Last night, he had wore it to the penthouse and had then taken it off. Apparently he had forgotten it. Well, there was nothing to it beyond going to fetch it.
"Because he is", Steve said, crossing his arms. "Loki is our son, and if you try to do anything to him..."
"When she gets started, nothing can stop her", he said. "I think that's why we didn't work. We couldn't compromise with each other."
An equally tired Sam joined him. They watched as Thor found a bowl, filled it with some cheerios knockoff, added milk, and then gave the bowl and spoon to his once-brother. Who eyed the bowl with disgust, pushing it away from him.
"What about those two?" The brother asked, almost dropping paint on Loki's paper. Making the Trickster try to fend him off.
"Papa! Daddy!" Loki jumped into their laps, giggling. While communication was still an issue, the boy had managed to learn what to call them. "Ja blev blå!"
Wrapping his arms around his husband, the blond didn't say anything at first. Just relishing in the closeness. "I love you too, Tony. You gave me a place to belong. Gave me time."
Steve looked down on his hands. Thin, bony. His chest looked like it would collapse from one single punch. But his friend wasn't wrong. There were certain things that drew him to someone. Regardless of their gender. He liked people who were intelligent, capable, and self-sufficient. Not that he couldn't admire a beautiful dame or a handsome fella, but that wasn't what truly captured him. In some ways his friend, James Buchanan Barnes, fitted his criteria. Though they were more like brothers than anything else. Thankfully, the brunet knew of his deviance and accepted him anyway. Helping him keep it a secret.
"He will stay in the penthouse", Tony said, sounding like it was a pain. "I have extra rooms, so it is the best solution."
"Oh... well, I guess there are worse things they could teach you. I don't know which book you were promised, Loki. You will have to ask Tony when he gets back."
It had been a while since he was down in the workshop. His bots had kept the dust down but there were projects he had forgotten about that was half finished.
The cupboard? Why would he try to... Oh! Right. That was where they had put the cookies and the candy. So Loki had tried to get them on his own instead of asking. Granted, it was before lunch so it would have been a no.
produced a death certificate of the made-up woman as to explain why the kid now lived with him. Additionally, she made certain that the two men could pick up their marriage licences without causing any commotion.
His dream about flying suits turned into one about spiders crawling his arm. He then realised that something was actually touching him. Waking up abruptly Tony blinked into the dark room. By the bed stood Loki, teddybear in his arms. It was he who had woken the engineer.
"Papa!" Their son gave the blond a hug. Meaning that both men were now smudged with cream and what probably was chocolate. But well, that happens sometimes when you have a kid.
As he walked he noticed that the floorboards seemed to sag under his feet. The closer he got to the kitchen, the more noticeable it was. Concerned he tested the floor and it was definitely sagging.
Once his now ex-girlfriend had stormed off he collapsed over his desk. Head in his arms, trying to feel anything. Why did he always have to mess everything up? He wasn't sure how long he stayed like that but suddenly he felt a warm hand on his shoulder. Making him jump.
"Tony! Over here!" Steve called. And there were Loki. Safe in his Papa's arms. Relief flooded him and he couldn't help but just ruffle the black hair. Thankful that nothing worse had happened.
"Apparently Natasha is going too. I'm guessing they want us to do missions together", Steve looked so defeated. "I was finally happy..."
When no food came, he became cranky. Demanding food and when he wasn't given any, he got upset and ran out of the room. In search of his parents. Causing the employees to panic as they suddenly had a toddler on the loose.
"Also, we have some pretty trigger happy peeps in this team. And SHIELD was still an issue", the engineer filled in. "We just deemed it safer to keep it under wraps. He is fairly harmless, you know. Just a kid."
Tony smiled. Steve was the love of his life, the only one to accept all of him. Forgiving Barnes, however, wasn't for the sake of his husband. It was for the sake of himself. He had realised it was far too easy to let resentment and anger rule you. For the sake of his family, he didn't want that to be him.
"Man of my heart. Literally, in this case. You are probably right. A press conference is probably the best option in this case."
Once again bundled from top to toe, Tony stood in his workshop. Unhappily watching as his husband instructed the tiny Trickster on what to do. Loki listened and then went up to the device. Without any hesitation, and with way more strength than normal for a toddler, he lifted the device into the containment chamber. Even properly closing the door. Then he returned to the two of them with a big smile.
"Are you really saying that you drawing me is an expression of love? Yikes, that's cheeky and campy. Wait, does this mean you have done that before?"
Leaving his parents to stare longingly at each other. The soldier placed his hand on the engineer's cheek. Coming closer to share a few kisses. Tony could feel the reluctance to leave. He had an urge to lock down the Tower if it could keep his husband home. But neither had much of a choice.
"If you want him to get to know you", Stark said. "You should stay for a while. Letting him come to you. But if you loses it on him again, you don't another chance. Got it?"
Washing his hands he intended to take the ground beef, he had started to learn to cook more. Before he could, there came a loud wail from the living room. Hurrying the engineer found his son crying loudly, sounding utterly destroyed. When he tried to get close to the boy, the tiny Trickster just flailed while he kept crying.
"Oh, good. Okay, so I was thinking, better safe than sorry, right? Which is why I think we should take just a teeny tiny amount of blood and test it. Just to make sure." He said fiddling with a kit.
To be fair, the kid had apparently tried to wake Thor first but the god of thunder had slept like a log. Meaning that between the three adults, he was the only one not sleep deprived. Reaching the kitchen he noticed Loki waiting patiently for his breakfast. Not making any fuss. It seemed the Thunderer had woken up at last, since he was the one looking through cabinets for food.
A furious blush grew on the blond's face. Cackling Tony slapped his shoulder and headed upstairs. It was nice to know his friend could get flustered too.
Once he calmed down they let him eat his apple, brushed his teeth and helped him put on a pyjama. Then stayed with him until he fell asleep. Afterwards they had gotten... busy... in a very nice way.
Still holding the broken toy Tony took the elevator down to the common floor. Just like he had predicted, the culprit was acting like nothing. Flipping with his phone. Still filled with rage the engineer walked up to him, ripped the phone out of his hands and threw it into the wall.
"You could have just have said he was trying to climb the counter..." Tony patted the small back and held the boy gently. Eventually the tears died down into sniffles. "Now you know better, no climbing the counters."
Tony folds his arms across his chest and leans against the doorway, making absolutely no move to relieve some of the burden on Steve’s arms. “Why can’t you do this on your land?”
Steve takes Tony’s hand and brushes a kiss along his knuckles. “I thought you were great at Valentine’s Day, too.”
“Good golly,” Tony sighs, slowly dragging his nails down Steve’s back. “I sure hope we finish before your parents get home.”
All the tension in Steve’s chest and stomach seems to unspool all at once, giving way to the cool slide of realization, the sudden feeling that he’s gotten something horribly, desperately wrong.
On the morning of the fourth day, a tiny darkskinned girl with google marks around her eyes and oil stains all over her cheeks turns up on Tony’s doorstep.
“No livestock, no bees. Got it,” Steve says with a small, muted smile. He wipes his hands on the dry parts of his shirt and trudges over to where Tony’s reclined, flopping down on the grass next to him.
“You’re both killing me,” Steve sighs, stepping around the island and rubbing at his eyes. He wraps one arm around his husband’s waist and loops the other around his dog, semi-successfully dragging them both out of the kitchen.
Pepper and Happy blink curiously at him. Tony takes a long sip of his coffee and winces, silently cursing weak Starbucks blends. He has no idea how Pepper survives on this stuff.
And then the person on the other end of the line starts talking, and the joy drops from Steve’s face entirely.
Unfortunately, Pepper is an actual witch with a sixth sense, so she clocks it and calls him within the hour.
“Was that supposed to be revenge?” Steve asks, reaching up to rub the now slightly sore spot on his scalp. “For the smoothie?”
Well. Pepper probably knows exactly what she’s doing. Tony, on the other hand, remains as oblivious as he’s always been.
Arc has recently launched a youth initiative which endeavors to get young people passionate about our work and cause. We’re looking for someone who can help design logos, flyers, and merchandise for our Green Teen Challenge (slated for release in October). We want to create youthful, fun designs that will speak to adolescent interest in environmentalism. This is a completely new initiative for the company so its creative direction would follow your impulses entirely. I’d be the contact person for the project, effectively liaising between your team of interns and our investors.
They pull apart and Steve’s pink all over now, but he has the most pleased expression on his face, like he’s tricked Tony into giving up something extremely valuable. Idiot. Tony
“Why won’t you help Riri with her armor?” Steve asks, slapping gently at one of Tony’s wrists as he tries to wriggle a semi-cooked noodle out of the pot.
“No,” Tony says immediately, petulantly, then seems to cut himself off. There’s another moment’s pause before he shakes his head and sets his jaw, that same strange determination coming over his features. “Fuck —
She thanks Tony briefly before ducking out, and Steve sidles up next to him as they watch her leave. Tony idly laces their fingers together.
“What’d you say to Peter?” Steve repeats, sitting down on the couch, too. Ruby curls up against his leg. “You gave him advice. It got him to finally calm down a little.”
“I don’t know what I’m doing, I’m drunk,” Tony repeats. It’s a catch-all, and it comes with the added bonus of being short, succinct. Tony doesn’t trust himself to say more, right now, because saying more would mean he’d have to think about it more, and he’s pretty actively avoiding that at the moment. And Steve is blessed with super-sobriety, right? So he doesn’t know anything about being wasted. He should accept Tony’s explanation and promptly fuck off. “I’m going back downstairs.”
And he’s just sitting there, watching the stuff bubbling in the pot, and he has this out of body experience where he wonders what the fuck he’s going to say when Steve proposes. And while he’s trying to construct an answer that both his heart and head are happy with, the pasta starts fucking burning. So he grabs the handle to take it off the stove but he forgets that it’s hot, hot enough that it burns him and he throws it on the ground. And now there’s still steaming, slightly charred pasta all over the hardwood and Tony is standing in the middle of it with angry red welts forming along the line of his palm.
When Steve and Natasha touch down on Tony Stark’s private tarmac, a car is waiting to take them to Mount Sinai.
“Because I think I’m hallucinating Steve,” Tony pauses and shoves his glasses back up his nose, staring harder at Steve like somehow that’ll make him disappear. “And it’s a really intense hallucination. He looks so real.”
The first time Steve knocks on Natasha’s door, he gets no response. He waits another thirty seconds then knocks again, says ‘it’s me’, and endures another brief spell of silence.
This is dangerous. It feels safe, when he can see Steve and touch him, but the second he leaves for the night Tony’s filled with this encroaching dread that he’ll never come back. Tony hasn’t forgotten how to live without him, he could never, after the kind of distance they’ve endured, but he knows it’ll hurt like a mother if they ever go down that path again. At some point in the past year he’d just forgotten, forgotten about protecting himself and protecting his heart, and while he wasn’t paying attention, a familiar, long-forgotten ache kicked up in his chest. Tony thought he was too old for this kind of thing - he has grey in his hair these days, for god’s sake, he should at least be a little wiser.
The city feels haunted. Peter is alive, but every time Tony sees him there’s this burgeoning anxiety in his chest, like each second they spend together is a second he’s at risk to ash away. It’s pretty much the same with Pepper, he’s both terrified to be in the same room with her and terrified to leave her unguarded, a confusing combination of impulses that sets his teeth on edge every time they try for a casual conversation. He keeps looking for threats over her shoulder, spends entire nights sitting at the foot of their bed watching the door.
“Right, yeah,” Tony says back awkwardly, looking like he’s actively suppressing the urge to run away screaming. “Cool. I just thought— you know, the sun.”
“Ummm… yes. Yeah, that’s— I know that’s not good enough. And I’d never dream of asking for a second chance, I just—“
And then there are days when Tony can’t stop touching him. All platonic, of course, hands on shoulders and elbows against sides and knees bumping together, but it feels like a meaningful reassurance all the same. Sometimes Tony just needs to know, that he’s there and Steve’s there and they’re not fighting anymore and it’s going to be okay.
Riri comes over for dinner, not because she has any interest in hanging out with Tony’s friends but rather because she can’t pass up the opportunity to meet Pepper Potts, CEO of Stark Industries and the first woman to be featured on no less than seven covers for Forbes magazine.
We would require a 3-month commitment, and we would like you to work out of our San Francisco facility. Arc is happy to cover the costs of a temporary move and provide accommodations. Please see the attached document for additional details regarding compensation.
Steve’s happy for his friends, of course, but he’s also starting to feel — starting to feel a little anxious, about his own life and choices, especially considering commissions have trickled to an all-time low despite his best efforts at advertisement. He’s knee deep in his third existential crisis of the month when he gets an email so promising that he’s initially convinced it’s spam.
Steve doesn’t say any of that, though. Instead, he says “get some sleep, Tony” and disappears into the darkness outside, leaving Tony’s shoulder warm from his touch.
“It’s not gonna be a problem. You won’t even see him, he’s, like, an engineer, right? He designs weapons?” Sam urges, muffled voices audible in the background of the call. Steve has so far resisted the urge to interrogate Sam about his summer roommates — more specifically, whether they are cleaner and smarter and just generally cooler than him and Bucky — but that does nothing to suppress his curiosity.
listening to all of it, but today there are more pressing matters, matters which begin with brusquely making his way across the room, taking hold of his husband’s ankles, and tugging him unceremoniously to the center of the bed.
“We barely knew each other,” Tony admits, catching Eli’s eyes. That might’ve been their biggest mistake. They got into bed together as a world-saving team without really taking the time to understand each other, understand what each person was hoping to get out of the avenging arrangement. It had made for problems down the line.
“I make time,” he shrugs, picking at a little piece of fallen lettuce, “the weapons, that’s — that’s Obie’s thing, I think. I can do it and I’m good at it because I’m good at everything, but I don’t really… like it.”
the hell he’d be here in the first place. The universe does not appear to be in crisis, and even if the hard feelings between them had faded during their round two with Thanos, they weren’t — they weren’t casual, like this. They were no longer the kind of people who could just drop in on each other. Tony loved Steve and Steve loved him, but something about their last parting had seemed… final. Like Steve was letting him go, no flip phone to tether them together this time. It had hurt, but it had also felt like the cleanest break he could hope to get.
“What do you suggest we do then?” he asks, head still fuzzy from the booze even as exasperation drives him ever-closer to sobriety. “What’s the star-spangled plan?”
“I do,” Steve concedes, leaning back in the booth and staring meaningfully at Tony. “I recently figured out that’s a better strategy than assuming things.”
“Ah, well,” the corner of Tony’s mouth curves up into a wry, self-deprecating smile. Steve feels his heart thump a little louder in his chest. “Hallucination or not, I don’t think he’d like that very much.”
Tony holds up the sledgehammer as if to explain. Steve’s eyes brighten in understanding, and whatever was clouding them seems to clear away. His gaze fixes on Tony’s hand, mouth twisting into a skeptical little line.
Steve would also spend a couple of hours every day in the gym. Keeping in shape, he called. The engineer didn't mind, especially since there was a noticeable increase in muscle that he was allowed to touch.
Rubbing his head the soldier was finding it hard to focus. He suspected he had not been sleeping enough. Certain dreams about a certain someone had been rather... intrusive. Maybe he should lie down a bit. Take a nap.
"You could have asked us", Wilson said. "We have babysat him before, we are aware of what he likes."
Tony snorted, that would be a sight. Not that he had any intention of missing dinner. Instead he told his AI to alert him when it was time.
"Suuuure, because you are sooo out of shape", the engineer grinned. Smiling the soldier gave him a kiss.
A surprise party had waited for them at the Tower, a small one. Pepper explained that they went without a wedding but that they at least could have a proper celebration. It was just her and Happy in attendance and the party was mostly good food and a nice cake. Nothing big or elaborate. After a while Tony's driver, or whatever he was, left. Leaving the three of them plus Loki.
The knock on the door made him freeze, reach for a knife, before slowly opening it. Outside stood the blond man from the hellicarrier. Who had called him...
"So, what do we do now?" Steve asked, furrowing his brow in that cute way of his. "This isn't a trick, Loki has really become a child."
"It comes down to the definition of evil", Tony said, sipping from his glass. "There are probably plenty of people who would call me evil for inventing and selling weapons. To them, it doesn't matter that I've stopped and tried to change. In their eyes, I'm still evil."
"You didn't tell me this, Clint", Laura said with light admonishment. "If I had known... Lila and Cooper could have been his playmate sooner."
Pondering if he should have coffee or not this late Tony was surprised to hear the elevator ding. He was even more surprised when Steve walked out, looking kind if dazed.
Stepping into the kitchen he saw a flustered Bruce holding a wet towel, but seemingly indecisive on how to use it. At the table sat Loki and.... the engineer let out a laugh. The boy's face was covered in whipped  cream, his hands was even dirtier, and the clothes would need to be washed.
"Tant Pepper!" The boy replied enthusiastically and went with the strawberry blonde woman without any fuss.
"Do you need any help?" Steve asked as the engineer started carrying everything to an unused bedroom.
"Clean your ears, Thunder Pants", the engineer snarked. "We found Loki like this months ago, JARVIS confirmed that he has returned to being a toddler. You yourself said your brother was beheaded. This isn't a trick."
"I... don't think so. Howard and Bucky got along pretty well. And... they had done something to him. He didn't recognise me either and was determined to kill me. I... I nearly let him..."
"Yes, he is", the soldier smiled. "I'm sorry for causing you distress. If there had been any other option..."
Just like he had hoped, Central Park was fairly empty and he could run uninterrupted. After an hour or so he paused at a drinking fountain to cool down a bit. He had just splashed his face with water when he felt something pull on his pants. Steve looked down.
"What? We got an extra?" A third woman  said, sounding frustrated. "We need to head back for lunch and the cart is too heavy without all of us."
"We don't usually let him eat pancakes without using at least a fork", he said to the scientist, still smiling.
"Wait, what?" Barton exclaimed, anger starting to show on his face. Bruce looked surprised but didn't show any signs of turning green.
"Broom broom!" Loki sounded as he pushed something along the floor. "Look out! Here comes the yellow car!"
Tony had tried to teach the child English using cards but Loki would say the word in his own language. Not even JARVIS had been able to interpret his babbling. Which was odd since it was obvious the tiny god understood English well enough.
The soldier had decided he would take a step back for now. Wait to see what would happen. This could have been a one off, a one night kind of thing. So, unless the engineer made a move himself, he wasn't going to. He wanted to show the other he could respect boundaries. Mind clearer he decided to go for a walk. The weather was fairly chilly now in the autumn so he would need his jacket. If he could find it. Rummaging through his things he couldn't locate the thing. Then he remembered.
Tony purposefully bumps into Steve’s shoulder as he walks to the sink and angrily slams on the tap. Steve watches him for a long moment, wondering now if the shoe had been on the other foot, if Loki had cornered Tony instead of him, would Tony have done it? Would Tony think he was worth that?
“Y’know, I want to make fun of them, always, forever, but I think I’m also confident enough in my masculinity to say I’m just straight up jealous of their sex life,” Clint announces to the table, speaking as if the pair has already left.  “I’m telling you,
There is something comforting about the fact his art studio is just about as far away from Tony’s workshop as the tower allows.  Down here, Steve’s almost able to forget that he and Tony are in the same building.
“Pray, tell, dear Tony, what brings you back to this fair city?  We have much missed you in your long absence.”  Thor’s coming in for a hug, he’s got missile lock, and Tony ducks out of the way just in time.
“Tony, since you know that everyone is going to be fine, why don’t we take a break and at least get something to eat, if you refuse to sleep.  You’ve been down here since lunch yesterday.  You can think about it and eat at the same time.”
Darcy turns back to look at him, nonplussed neither by Jane so openly stating Darcy’s interest nor by Jane commenting so bluntly on how the evening has progressed thus far. She has her legs crossed, her silk stockings on clear display. She folds and rests her manicured hands over her knee as she squares her shoulders, ready to make a demand of him.
There are no mobsters or molls here, nor any of LAPD’s finest, but there are movie stars aplenty. They cozy up to one another in the rounded banquettes, lounging against rich red leather as they try to mix business with pleasure. The next contract discussed over the next cocktail. The next producer easily confused with the next paramour. Everything and everyone mingles.
“Theoretically, yes, it is possible.”  Tony retorts, not stuttering in his movements even the slightest.  “Hey, do you like your digs?  Pepper refused to let me have any fun, something about me inflicting my personality on others, yada yada, so I apologize if it’s boring as hell.  But you’re artistic, right?  Right.  You can do something with it – hopefully something more than your hovel in Brooklyn though, cause that place was
call him?” Darcy and Jane are both appalled; out of the corner of his eye, Steve can see Natasha lift an eyebrow at him archly, lips pursing. She’s displeased, but probably not for the same reasons as the two women sitting beside him.
“What can I say, Tony, I like spending time with people who like spending time with me.”  Steve leans forward, grabbing another slice.
That whole thing had been a mess from start-to-finish, so much so that he's surprised Steve even agreed to meet with him, much less come all the way up to Tony's place.
Bucky draws back to catch his breath, the pace of his hips not missing a beat, and Steve’s hands immediately go to Bucky’s strong pecs, palms cupping firm muscles and finger tips sweeping over his nipples. Bucky smiles a little, breathless and beautiful, as Steve lets his touch wander lower, tracing the lines and divots of Bucky’s abs and tight waistline. Again Steve finds himself caught off guard, rapt with wonder, at the sight of Bucky’s cock between his own legs. Something about seeing that dark thatch of hair and the inch or so of Bucky’s thick length that’s visible, knowing the rest of it is deep inside, fucking him open, is nearly as arousing as the feel of their actual fucking.
