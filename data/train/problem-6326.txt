Steve pulled back to give Tony some air. ‘My turn, my turn Stevie, I wanna taste.” Wordlessly the two larger men spun the smaller around so now he was facing Bucky and Bucky was kissing his lips while Steve kissed the opposite side of his neck, sucking gently. Bucky kissed harder than Steve, still gentle, but with a little more insistence. His tongue ran along the seam of Tony’s lips asking for entrance which Tony quickly gave, moaning into the kiss,
Bucky pouted dramatically, but did as he was told, dragging his feet into the bathroom. Steve laughed at Bucky’s misfortune and leaned in to steal a kiss from the smaller brunette but was stopped by a finger on his lips.
“I completely agree, and look how sweet our boy is, he has this big ‘ol tub and filled it with sweet water. Added bonus, what a sweetheart, he’s in the tub too.”
“Did you cook a lot with Jarvis?” asked Steve
“Aww, baby boy what’s wrong?” cooed Bucky, “Are our bodies makin you uncomfortable?”
Steve leaned down to press his lips against Tony’s forehead, leaving them there in a silent worry for his temperature. If it got higher again, Steve would know. Bucky maneuvering closer as to wrap a broad arm around Tony’s waist, letting his hand rest on Steve’s hip.
“Oh sweet thing,” moaned Bucky, “What a pretty little cock you got.”
“Guys!”
Tony groaned pitifully and turned his head away, eyes squeezing shut. Steve and Bucky both sighed. Getting Tony to take something that was good for him was never an easy task, both of them had been hoping it wouldn’t be like that this time. Bucky reached down and started to slowly rub Tony’s stomach.
“Aw, little Tony” cooed Natasha
“Your Bucky Bear? Oh dear me is he lost?”
“Don’t worry baby boy, I’m not going anywhere. We made you a right mess and we need to clean ya up before we go to bed,” cooed Bucky
On screen, baby Tony was swinging his body back and forth on top of his stool as Jarvis began cutting into the pizza. The pizza, now cooled was placed on a plate in front of the tiny chef. Baby Tony eagerly snagged his piece and took a big bite, chewing thoughtfully.
“That’s right. Since you are the chef and I your loyal assistant you tell me what ingredients you need.” With that Jarvis moved off screen and let the focus stay on Tony.
Tony, almost asleep whined again at being jostled from his comfy muscle pillow. Steve shushed him, settling him back on his lap, this time with Tony’s arms and legs wrapped around him. Steve guided his head back to his shoulder and rubbed his back soothingly.
Tony was cut off my the hot press of lips against his own. Bucky tangled the fingers of his left hand into his hair and held on gently. The kiss, was anything but. Tony gasped at the feel of Steve’s lips against his neck, giving Bucky the perfect opportunity to let his tongue inside.
They smirked when Tony let out a startled ‘meep!’ when they dropped their pants. They chuckled as well when Tony quickly covered his eyes. Their boy was so sweet.
The little boy gasped, a horrified expression on his face. The man behind the camera tried to contain his laughter at the boy. On little feet he ran as fast as he could to the pile of blankets on the floor, the camera following his every move. With a few grunts and a small struggle to lift the blankets there was a pause and then an ecstatic “ ‘ucky beh!” and the boy and bear were reunited at last, a reunion that warmed the heart to anyone who was watching. Chubby arms encircled the bear and shrill happy shrieking was heard on screen as the boy jumped up and down in his happiness.
“Yup!”
Tony sighed. Seeing his mother on camera always brought nostalgia and just a little bit of heart break. As if sensing his feelings, Bucky and Steve leaned down and placed sweet kisses on his cheeks, making Tony smile.
Steve took his time looking through the selection of videos making sure he would pick the perfect video. His eyes caught one title called “The Tony and Jarvis cooking show.” Intrigued by the possible cuteness, Steve chose the video and quickly showed it to Tony for approval. Once Tony gave him a short nod, Steve placed it into the machine.
“Nuh uh baby,” scolded Steve lightly, as he grabbed onto both of his hands. “What did we say last night? You’re beautiful, don’t hide yourself from us.”
“Fucking finally!” yelled Clint
Bucky pulled back looking concerned, while Tony gasped in air. “Tones, don’t ever, ever think that way. Stevie and I love you more than anything and they only way you could get rid of us is if you tell us you want us gone. Now,” Bucky smirked peeking down into the bubbles making Tony blush furiously, “By the looks of it, you feel the exact opposite, and baby?” asked Bucky
“Oh sweet thing you have no idea how long I have waited to get a taste of you. Steve and I have a bet going on about what you’ll taste like. Stevie thinks you’ll taste more tangy, like sweat and metal, since you spend so much time in your workshop, but I disagree.”
The ex-assassin in question had tears in his eyes. Actual tears in his eyes.
“Was? Stevie he still is adorab-” Bucky choked off the last word realizing what he was about give away.
“I think it is very sweet,” said Natasha, “Also, I am taking my turn now to pick a video. Any one disagree?” asked Natasha, raising one deadly looking eyebrow.
“Are you kidding me! That’s not even fair!” wailed Clint in response to what was on screen.
“Yes! Y-yes, it’s ok.” Tony received two large grins in return.
“Come on sweetcheeks, open that pretty mouth and be a good boy for us and take your medicine. We promise you’ll feel better. Please? For us?” Bucky continued with his slow rubbing. Tony shifted, whimpered, and to their amazement opened his mouth. Steve took his opportunity and plopped the pills into his mouth and helping Tony to drink from the cup, watching patiently as he swallowed them with a grimace.
“Ugh, that was Marie Crats, a daughter of one of my mother’s high society friends. I hated when she would come over because all she would do was torment me. I’m pretty sure before we sat down she tugged me by the ear until I toppled over and then when I tried getting up she shoved me back down.”
“Stevie” Bucky whined and oh no, those were puppy dog eyes. Who would have thought such a look on a man like Bucky who usually sauntered around with the air of “look at me and I’ll fucking rip your dick off” and “yes, that is a gun in my pocket, and no I am not happy to see you” could look so incredibly endearing.
I'm back and still completely amazed by the constant feedback I am getting! I've read all the comments and have read the suggestions. I don't know if I'll be able to completely fulfill all of them but I will try my hardest! I only see maybe 1-3 more chapters left? But who knows things can change. Anyway here's the next chapter!
Little Tony squealed and started to wildly spread the sauce onto the dough, although not doing a great job at the ‘spreading’ part. Once it looked like the boy was happy with the spreading he took the spatula and started smacking it into the sauce, spraying the boy with the red sauce.
“And now we’re scared we’ve fucked everything up with these home videos.”
Tony had no idea what he should do. He was torn between thrusting his hips forward or backwards into his lovers talented mouth’s. He continued to whimper and writhe between his lovers, sobbing out each breathe. He could feel tears clinging to his eyelashes, but he could care less. This was an exquisite torture.
Steve chuckled, “Be careful Tony, Bucky has a wicked mouth and has been waiting forever to use it on ya. He may not hold back.”
“Aye, we have done the Man of Iron a great disservice.” said Thor looking not very Godly at the moment.
Tony squirmed, his dream had felt so real, so good. His cock twitched in interest, his hips canting towards the warmth at his front, his cock rubbing with delicious friction. He mewled in pleasure, his hips rocking slowly.
Just as fast as he had come, his body gave out as if all the strings that were keeping him up had been cut. He heard Steve grunt but was too exhausted to care as to why. He felt two warm hands grab and lift his hips. He heard someone snickering. Finally curiosity won out and he peaked open one eye to see what was so funny.
“Fuck! That’s it? I demand more!” yelled Bucky as he jumped up from the couch in his outrage.
Bucky grinned, “You owe me fifty bucks.”
“I’VE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU FOREVER AND I-OH MY GOD!” Tony looking a worrisome shade of red quickly slapped his hands over his mouth in mortification. “I-I m-mean.” Tony stopped to clear his throat trying to gather his suave charm and failing. “I-I like you guys too? And this isn’t-isn’t some kind of joke right? Because if this was a joke you guys really picked a day to fuck with my emotions and I might as well pour gasoline on myself and set myself on fire because that’s basically what I’m doing now-and you guys are very, close.”
“Now that we are all settled in can we please press play? I’m dying over here!” whined Bucky
“Oh fuck my ass.” Tony groaned
Tony spared a glance over at them and felt a matching smile grow on his face. Bucky and Steve really were the best. They were always understanding that Tony had an incredibly busy life and instead of leaving him be and missing out on time with him, they would often join the genius in his workshop doing the same things they were doing now. Steve would mostly sketch anything and everything and Bucky would sometimes read a book, nap or play with the bots.
Steve was concentrating on one thing, the pull-up bar and the great deal of pull-ups he was doing, he lost track after two hundred and fifty. What he wasn’t expecting was at that moment for Bucky and Clint to burst into the room.
“Bucky’s right. We got too distracted with the idea of watching videos of you when you were little. I mean- can you blame us? You were adorable.”
Both supersoldiers groaned, “Buck-Bucky! I can’t! I can’t take this anymore!” Steve groaned while clutching his chest. Bucky looked sympathetically over at his boyfriend, patting him on the shoulder in a comforting gesture. Bucky wasn’t fairing much better. How could one child be this adorable? It had to go against some sort of law. This was a deadly force. On screen both women tried to muffle their laughter. Sounding out of breath Maria was the first to speak.
“Cookies Aun Peg? I can has cookies?”
They both looked down at their sick lover and their hearts broke. Poor Tony had his eyes barely open looking blearily up at them, pain in his eyes.
Steve kneeled down, sliding his hand across Tony’s cheek. “Come on baby, open up those pretty eyes for me, yeah?” Steve continued his soft caress of Tony’s cheek watching intently as his eyes fluttered open to stare at Steve, bright with fever. “There you are sweetheart. I need you to open up your mouth and swallow these pills for me, it’ll help with your fever.”
“Anthony, what are you looking for? You have been walking around the room for a long time.”
“My apologies Sir. You had never explicitly told me to keep these videos from your fellow Avengers. Up until a few minutes ago everyone seemed to be having quite the time and nothing seemed to go against my programming towards your safety. Therefore I did not block the Avengers from watching.” The AI at least sounded a little apologetic.
Tony squealed in his embarrassment. A fact he would take to his grave. His face by now was as red as his suit and he had to hide his face away in his hands.
Bucky grunted and pinched his hip as Steve snickered.
Steve quickly looked back at the screen when he heard the woman speak to baby Tony and just in time as the baby raised his arms and shrieked and giggled with the biggest toothless smile on his chubby face. Bucky reached out to grab Steve’s arm for support, his other arm grabbing his chest and a pinched look on his face. Bucky moved his lips and Steve vaguely heard another whispered obscenity. Tony was so little, an absolute angel Steve just wanted to bundle the small baby on screen and hold him tight and never let him go.
Tony shot up, eyes bulging as he took in the sight of his two boyfriends still in full combat gear. They had at least put away their weapons, Bucky’s guns and Steve’s shield. The two soldiers were smirking at him, something Tony had never seen before, it made his pulse quicken.
“Aye, the young Anthony was truly a force of cuteness, I am as what the midgardians say, can’t even right now.”
“Look at him, he’s lost in pleasure he can’t even speak.”
“Steve!” Bucky and Clint both shouted. Steve paused, chin over the bar, “Yes?” Steve responded drawing out the end in wary confusion. The two of them together looking so frazzled and with shit eating grins on their faces spelled trouble. No one had expected the explosive bromance that resulted during Bucky’s recovery. It had been six months since Bucky had returned to Steve and had come to live with all of the Avengers at the tower. Steve had been worried for Bucky and for the safety of a few certain people such as the archer and their local super genius that they might do something to accidentally provoke Bucky which would then result in a fatal stab wound. Luckily for the residents of the tower Bucky recovered almost ridiculously fast, perhaps thanks to the serum. In fact Bucky took to all the avengers in equal comradery. Steve was happy for Bucky. Steve was absolutely ecstatic that Bucky and him had fallen back into their old relationship. He loved seeing the man he loved interacting with the members of his new family. Bucky fitting in almost seamlessly.
“Now what comes next darling?” asked Jarvis
“F’ast! We! Need! Dough!” screamed the boy. Jarvis placed a pre baked pizza crust in front of the boy, making him bounce in excitement.”
“I can’t believe you guys! I thought we were friends. You don’t see me going through your stuff or asking JARVIS to spy on you. In fact, JARVIS? Why are these guys watching these videos? You gave them access?”
Tony was silent. Deep down he knew that what JARVIS said was true. His team was his family, they never would have used the evidence in the movies to hurt him, tease him for sure, but that’s what families did. The movie with Howard was an unexpected blow. He didn’t want things with the Avengers to change. He didn’t want to be viewed with pity. He was still the same Tony he has always been. Tony learned quickly to hide from Howard if he wanted to stay safe. Sometimes there wasn’t always someone there to save him. He realized early on that he had to save himself. The less contact he had with his father as he grew up the safer he’d be.
Clint slid the video into the player and scurried back to sit next to Natasha. Everyone got comfortable as the screen went from black to show what appeared to be a study or music room. Two women, one obviously being Maria were sitting next to a piano sipping tea idly chatting to one another in hushed tones. A muffled argument was heard off camera, the sound of children’s voices getting louder and louder.
Tony could only whimper in response which only seemed to anger Howard more. Turing on his heel with Tony’s arm still in his grasp and began to walk quickly from the room.
“What Clint means is that we are happy to see that you three finally talked things out.” replied Natasha
Realization dawned on Steve, “Wait...Tony’s home videos?” Steve received huge mischievous smirks in response.
“Doll, we’re sorry, real sorry. We didn’t take your feelins into consideration.”
“So does this mean we need to put the videos away?” asked Clint. Everyone looked to Tony waiting to see what he would say. Tony smirked, “Nah, but I get final say in what we can and can’t watch? You got it?” Cheers echoed through the room as everyone frantically ran back to their spots. Bucky and Steve dragging Tony over to their couch, making room for him in the middle. Tony had never been so happy.
“Clint, grow up. I’m sure everything will be fine.”
The camera dropped from Jarvis’s hands and landed on it’s side. The Avengers watching in horror as on screen Jarvis runs after the father and son, the hysterical cries echoing from the TV. Not one of the gathered dared to say anything, eyes still riveted to the screen.
“You dressed like the Captain and looked for your Bucky Bear, you were young Sir, merely two years it seems. Perfectly acceptable behavior.”
Steve pulled back just barely enough to mumble out the next few words against Bucky’s lips.
“Oh like hell you were! You’re all knowing and all seeing! You’re just a traitor laying in wait to watch your creator suffer. You masochist.”
“Anthony, my dear boy, wave hi to the camera,” a masculine voice with an English accent came from the TV. The little boy looked up at the man behind the camera and waved enthusiastically.
“Stevie and I planned it on the fly” he chuckled.
Steve kissed him on the temple, “ Of course it is sweetheart, why would you think otherwise?”
“Ditto” Steve and Bucky said together. Tony grinned shyly up at Steve and then over to Bucky, blushing sweetly. It was still crazy to think that the soldiers thought Tony was adorable and had the same feelings as he did.
Tony hummed as he seemed to remember the last few hours. He looked up at them bashfully.
“That’s right,” added Bucky, “Whatever you want. Now,” Bucky reached his hand down to cup Tony through his sleep shirt,” You want some help with this sweet thing?”
Bucky laughed, “Alright, alright. We’ve talked long enough our poor boy has been waiting so long. Let’s get to work soldier.”
“Oh you know what!” Tony laughed. All three of them dissolved into laughter. Tony feeling safe and comfortable despite the teasing between his two loves.
“How do you think it’s going down there?” asked Bruce
Silence. All three men were staring at each other with wide eyes. Steve and Bucky were sharing quick, panicked looks with each other and staring at Tony. Tony was too shocked to say anything. He kept staring at the pair, waiting for someone to say something. Steve and Bucky shared one more look and seemed to have come to a decision.
Tony sighed sliding further down into his bath. It had been a long day filled with board meetings and putting on the act that he knew what he was doing. He had only just a few short months ago, come of age to take over his father’s company. Not to mention the whole debacle with Ob-with Stane. Then having to go through different lawyers and board members to let Pepper run the company instead until he came of age. The stress was-a lot- so much so that he had been kept so busy and stressed he never got to see his boyfriends as much as he wanted.
Bucky groaned, “Oh please sugar, honey, my mouth, say yes. Lemme use my mouth on ya. I’ll make you feel so good.”
“Nuh uh soldier. Rule applies to you. Don’t think I forgot about you.” Tony tried not to smile as the same exact expression that Bucky had, showed up on Steve’s face. Without another word Steve climbed off the bed and joined Bucky in the bathroom.
“Tony!” the Avengers called. However their calls seemed to land on deaf ears. Tony ran from them as if his backside was on fire. The doors to the elevator closed with a sense of cold finality.
Welllll? Hope was decent haha. Any ideas on what you want baby Tony to do next, leave them in the comments~
“I’m ready mistro,” drawled Marie. Little Tony glanced over and smirked as he quickly slid his hands down the keys.
Steve was staring down at him, hair mussed and eyebrow raised with an unimpressed look upon his face. Next to him Bucky was struggling hard not to laugh.
“Next time, we switch.”
“Doll are you sick?” Bucky exclaimed, worry quickly gripping his chest.
“Ok sweet thing, all clean, you did so well, so beautiful when you let go, just letting yourself feel good,” Bucky praised
“Oh, Doll” purred Bucky lowering his head so his nose brushed against the back of Tony’s neck and bringing his arms around to grab Steve’s hips. Trapping the genius between them. “The feelin is mutual.”
“Sweetheart,” Steve whispered in his ear, “I can feel your nervousness from here. Do you want us to stop watching the videos?”
Steve headed to the bathroom as soon as he had grabbed the bottle of ibuprofen hearing the tub turn on. Steve walked right through the bedroom and into the bathroom stopping and anxiously waiting for orders from Bucky. Steve wasn’t as used to caring for sick people as Bucky was. Steve was more used to being the one being cared for. Bucky always seemed to know what to do. Always staying calm. It was mostly thanks to him that after his mother died that he stayed alive at all. Speaking of Bucky, Steve shook his head to rid him of the memory. Bucky currently was sitting on the ground his legs crossed, tub running and Tony firmly sat in his lap. Hearing Steve come through Bucky looked up from checking the temperature of the bath.
“AH!” very articulate Tony good job, he thought amused
Just then a small brunette boy came stumbling into the scene. The small boy was glaring at the little girl, who continued to smirk. The boy reached the piano and turned, showing his face to the camera.
“Did you just see the eyebrow wiggle? Did you see! Ah! What four year old knows how to do that!” yelled Natasha desperately trying to keep her calm persona and failing miserably.
“Hey Steve, do you think tomorrow Tony will let me at his ass tomorrow? I really wanna taste,” he whined
The Avengers jumped again at the harsh tone of the man’s voice. To their surprise around the corner walked in none other than Howard Stark. On screen Tony winced and seemed to draw closer around himself, something a boy of two should not know how to do.
“How does it taste Anthony?”
Steve let out a huge breathe, “Oh thank God. Good thinking Buck.”
“Aw, Tony, don’t be embarrassed. It’s ok, I promise baby, it felt real nice.” soothed Steve
The older men chuckled, “Aw, Stevie he’s blushin. What’s the matter doll? Don’t want us lookin?”
Tony couldn’t respond, he was watching, mouth agape as Bucky began stripping while Steve was talking. He gulped audibly when Steve quickly followed suit. Tony kept staring as all of those large muscles were put on display. From the quick touches, and creating their uniforms, Tony knew his boyfriends were muscular, he had EYES ok? Seeing their bare chests made him blush harder, but was unable to look away.
“Quiet Jarvis! I’m talking to Anthony.” In those few words Howard ended right in front of the quivering child and leaned down to grab him by the arm, making Tony whimper in fear or pain the Avengers were unsure. The room was dead silent.
“Oh hell no!” Everyone jumped and looked over to Natasha who looked absolutely offended for Tony. Natasha stared everyone else down. “What? He’s a beautiful little baby and he deserves all the praise. Don’t fucknig judge me or I will end you.”
Steve stood up from the couch, ignoring Tony’s whine of disapproval. “Ok, so Clint got to choose this one, I want to choose next!” yelled Steve
“It-it is?” asked Tony, thoroughly confused at not being yelled at.
The camera went black causing an outrage to the viewers, all except big Tony who only rolled his eyes at his team.
“Yes darling, we can sneak one, don’t tell Jarvis.”
“Aw,” cooed Steve and Bucky
“JARVIS, temp check?”
“Anywho!” Bucky shouted over him, “I think it’s time to get out of the water, we don’t want Tony to get too cold. His body is sensitive as it is right now due to his temperature.”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, hands reaching blindly for purchase. Steve watching on in amusement reached out and took his smaller lovers hand in his own, giving the back a kiss.
Steve and Bucky stared at him, waiting patiently for an answer. Tony blinked and looked up at them owlishly. “M’head hurts...nd’m’cold...started a’lil while ago….JARVIS?” Steve and Bucky both winced at the obvious hoarseness of his voice. Sore throat.
“It’s-it’s not little! It’s aver-aaaggeeee!” squealed Tony as he felt the hot press of Steve’s cock against the swell of his ass. Oh god, that felt-too big, it was too big how was he supposed to take tha-
Another pause, “Well you were wearing your mother’s dress, jewelry, and makeup. You looked quite lovely Sir.”
Jarvis let out a laugh, “That good huh? Well you heard it here ladies and gentlemen. Another delicious meal here on the Tony and Jarvis cooking show.” Jarvis leaned over and the screen went dark again.
“No. I-I like watching the videos. I really do. Honest. I’m just nervous for another Howard appearance.”
“Hey sweetheart,” cooed Steve, “Are you feelin any better?”
“Mrs. Stark! He did it again!”
“Oh, oh OH! Steve! Bucky! Ah!” he sobbed their names into the steamed air the surrounded them like a cloud. His cock sputtering between him and Bucky, making a mess of their fists. He felt Steve’s stuttered thrusts then a burst of warmth against his ass, shortly after Bucky followed, making a mess of Tony’s thighs and lower stomach.
Things finally get resolved!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m wasn’t that small!” Tony shouted indignantly.
Steve and Bucky both cursed. That was high and it was getting higher and higher by the minute. They needed to bring it down quickly.
“JARVIS” groaned Tony “Why didn’t you tell me double trouble was marching up to the lab doors?”
“Hush now darlin, you’re beautiful, every bit. One day we’re going to prove it,” cooed Bucky, “Now, Steve, you can go have a taste of Tony and I can skip the meal and go straight to dessert.”
“Can you blame me baby? I am being denied my rights! I demand vengeance! I demand-”
“Oh, my, well Tony yes you are a very handsome boy.” replied his Aunt Peggy
“Oh…” Bucky turned to his partners sitting on the couch cheeks pink and a sheepish smile on his face.
“Shh, sweetheart, don’t you panic, how about both? Then you don’t have to choose,” said Steve.
“Poor thing,” Bucky murmured, slowly stroking Tony’s hair. Tony nuzzled into the touch like a kitten, misery clearly written on his features.
With those words Tony snuggled closer to the muscled chest in front of him and back against the muscled chest behind him, one hand reaching up to grab at Steve’s shirt and the other gravitating up to place his hand over Bucky’s at Steve’s hip.
“Oh yeah. But if you think I’m lyin, get your blonde ass down here and have a taste, or better yet.”
The anger in him seemed to drain out quickly. He slumped on his workbench, laying his head back down onto the table. He may not be as furious as he was when he stumbled in on their little movie night, but it didn’t mean he was ready to talk to any of them yet. If he did he would risk talks with feelings in them. Tony shuddered at the thought.
“No judgement happening over here.”
“Oh, fuck.” Steve and Bucky both whispered
“Nope!”
“Alright then,” whispered Bucky. He pulled back, reaching down to the shirt Tony was wearing and grabbed onto the hem, lifting it up exposing Tony’s lithe body. Tony blushed even harder. They were both staring at him! The mortification became too much and he tried sneaking his hands down to cover his sex.
Bucky chuckled, “I know, I know. Take it slow. Can you blame me though? He’s too sweet for me not to want to wreck him.”
“Who’s that little girl?” asked Bruce
“The last video they watched was the one you walked in on.” Tony didn’t look up.
Tony had to pull back to breathe when he was gently spun around so that he was facing Bucky. “Oh, my sweet baby doll, did you like your show?”
“He’s right Tones, never seen a more pretty sight.” Bucky leaned in for a kiss. Tony was charmed and leaned in to kiss his lover back before he remembered the situation he had found himself in. Scandalized, he shoved at Bucky as hard as he could. Bucky being completely caught off guard lurched backwards and fell off the side of the bed, thus sending his other lover into hysterics.
“Antonio! Marie! My darlings what fun. You are both growing as artists everyday. Felicity, come, I’ll walk you to the door.” said Maria, taking her friend by the hand and began leading her to the study door.
“Clint you know I’m not that kind of-”
The rest of the Avengers were still sitting in the communal room, none of them having the energy to get up as they all still felt awful for betraying their friend the way they did.
“Uptown girl.”
Steve reached up, carding his fingers through Tony’s hair, “Tony, sweetheart is everything ok?” They got another whimper, almost sounding like a groan, but nothing else.
Tony pouted and pretended to think about it. “I’m still a little mad. However, I can think of a few ways you can make it up to me” he smirked
Tony tried not to smile “Oh shut up. I wasn’t that small.”
Without so much as a grunt, Steve shifted one arm underneath Tony’s thighs and kept the other on his cock and lifted him out of the water, exposing him to Bucky’s gaze as he stroked. Tony whimpered in embarrassment.
The father and son disappeared around the corner when the first wails assaulted their ears all of the avengers growing tense.
“We understand if you don’t want to be in a relationship with us because of this.”
Bucky and Steve shared a look. Tony wouldn’t look at them and they both could feel his minute shivering. Slowly the pieces started falling into place and the stared at each other, panicked.
“Wow” came Tony’s response a few moments later. It took him a while to gain his senses back.
Tony let out a choked scream when he felt a warm wetness caressing his hole.
“Dah, dah dah daahhh! Welcome to the Tony and Jarvis cooking show!” On screen was Jarvis and he was waving his hands in excitement. Next to him was a small boy jumping up and down.
“You taste absolutely delicious angel” Bucky responded while licking his lips, making Tony blush.
Steve pulled off just enough to whisper, “Go ahead baby, let go, I can take it.” The cool air of Steve’s breathe against his cock made him shiver hard. Steve renewed his ministrations, this time paying extra attention to the head of his cock. With Steve’s words of encouragement, Bucky plunged deeply into Tony, licking and tasting, making Tony scream. Steve hummed around the length in his mouth and tongued at the slit. That was it. Tony was done.
Steve leaned down to give Tony’s face another lingering kiss, “Get some rest sweetheart, we’ll watch over you, don’t worry, we’ll take care of you.”
“Down boy, Tony is too tired for anything else, we can always try something tomorrow if he’s up to it. He’s already passed out, the precious thing.”
“Yes sir,” Steve gave a mock salute and began to maneuver himself into position. Laying on his back and tucking his face between Tony’s legs. Once Steve was settled, Bucky swung his leg over Steve to straddle his hips.
“Are we allowed to watch those? I mean Tony is kind of a private guy.” Steve ever the gentlemen wanted to respect his friend’s (and crushes) boundaries. What? Steve wasn’t blind ok? Tony was an attractive guy and the ass on that man. Could you blame him for looking (staring longingly) at it? Steve would feel bad about it if he hadn’t caught Bucky doing the exact same thing. The conversation and events after were something to remember. Both had come to the agreement that they both wanted the genius and if said genius was amiable, well then, their partnership would be legendary. However, getting the genius alone, away from work and the superhero business and actually sit down and talk about feelings was a whole different battle entirely. Meaning that the two supersoldiers were having no luck whatsoever.
Now, he doesn’t feel bitter. He feels hopeful. He wants to believe everything will be fine, so hard it makes his heart beat a little bit faster, and he keeps his hands very still at his side in a conscious effort to stop himself from fidgeting with pent up nervous energy.

Steve grinds his teeth with such force he almost feels them cracking.

Tony does not move. When Barton leaves, the others deflate slowly, as balloons slowly losing air, the sudden spike in adrenaline way too high for them to comfortably shift back into calm after the explosive exchange, so as their hands go down from defensive positions and they retreat from aggressive stances, they all just… breathe.
Steve’s eyebrows pinch together. “You could sound a little less surprised.”

. It is a library – an old, modest one, with a cold, soft light streaming in through the sparse, small windows, illuminating the specs of dust that flow slowly through the air, dancing in mist. The entire place smells even more strongly than the entrance of the Sanctum, wooden and metallic at once, with hints of spicy aromas from somewhere Tony can’t quite place, and books, so many books, and the scent of aging pages and scrolls, of leather covers and ink, and this is

Vision makes a pause and stares back at Clint, pensive.
How can he fix this? How can he make this better?
When they started finding the bodies… It all became a little too much.
He refuses to do that second one.
Tony looks at him, surprised, and his interior feels too soft, too squishy and too mushy, so he pushes all thought aside in favor of showering his bots with attention, all he can spare, because it’ll keep the ugly thought from coming too close when he is too raw. Just for a little longer. He wants to be this, unguarded and open, grateful, even though he doesn’t know what he did to deserve this, just a little longer.
And he’ll be damned if this is not all his anxiety needs to pop its head over his shoulder, waiting, patient,

Tony’s eyes fall to Nebula on instinct.
<message log #3049 / active>
The Accords are still a sore subject for him, and he fears they always will be. A part of him hoped, even if silently and secretly, that the Accords would just fall apart after they left, that the world would realize on its own how much the Avengers are needed and how terrible it would be to keep them trapped. How petty and childish of him; but he did wish for it, even if he’d never said it to another soul.

He goes back under.
Bruce looks at Rhodey as if he expects him to laugh at his face and say it’s a joke – but Rhodey has nothing but a steadfast, sure look in his eyes, the same unwavering conviction that carried him through his entire life, though MIT and Air Force and everything else, the sense of trust in his friends and teammates and the fierce instinct to protect them against everything, even their own demons. Tony knows that look very, very well. He’s been on the aim of that look more times than he can count; and Rhodey wouldn’t be Rhodey if he wasn’t like this – steady, understanding, and so loyal it makes the heart feel tight at the idea of being one of his’. There are no lies in Rhodey’s eyes. Never. And Bruce must see it too; Because he pauses, his eyes scanning Rhodey’s face, and after a beat, he relaxes, his shoulders no longer hunching, the wry smile disappearing from his face, replaced with a serious, but heartfelt sincerity when he says:
“Ah, it’s not… A good idea, it doesn’t last long, and it’s pretty exhausting.” Lang admits, almost sadly.
“The Kree guy who fought my sister for the Stone.” Nebula answers, with a shrug. “An idiot.”
“The idiot, Quill.” The blue being reminds him, objectively, even when Tony doesn’t say a word. “He had a ship. It’s still around. We can use it to get out of here.”

“Yeah.” Steve breathes. “Maybe.”
“Yeah. Well. You can arrange your stuff however you like!” Tony enforces, but then, looks down at the box in Cap’s hands. “Is – Is that it?”

(How—)
Because this night, his nightmares come even though he’s fully awake.
Has it always been like this? Tony had made so many adjustments to it when Fury had asked for some help with the designs. Did he really make them so loud?
“I got Chitauri batteries.” Tony suggests. “If you think that would work.”
“Alright.” Steve confirms. “Alright, ok. We’ll be there. ETA 8 hours.”
But I am willing to bet everything I have to save that kid and if splitting this team is the only way to do it – That’s

“But that’s not a problem for you, is it?”
Rogers stares back at him. He clenches his jaw, beard full but even so not enough to hide the way his nose flares and his mouth twists in distasteful bitterness, and something surges from inside Tony before Rogers can even think to respond, something ugly and crude and rotten, something that has been growing inside him for the past two years and he didn’t even know, a hurt he thought he got over from but apparently not, a wound that he had ignored only to realize now it had festered to the point of agony, and all he can do is to
that is not true. It hurts more, because he knows how it ends.
“He’s a megalomaniac with an insanely strong weapon.” Tony comments. “Guys like him don’t like to stay hidden for long.”
“I always am.” Steve stupidly answers.
<return= initiate “playlist.tony”>
Tony, in turn, has had his
And frankly – how can he not agree with that?
“You think I’m running from something.” Steve half growls, but he feels terrible because
Tony lets himself be pulled away, pretending he can fall back with ease into the familiar warmth of the banter between him and his best friend, even as he’s feeling anxious and is so damned tired he can’t properly enjoy it; And tries very hard not to look back at the lounge, even as the stares at his retreating back seem to get harder and harder as he goes away; And only when they are finally around the corner and out of the sight of the others, Tony wonders if any of them were glaring not because of Tony’s poorly concealed injuries, but because they somehow noticed the little slip Rhodey made in his speech.
“You know what?” Tony licks his lips, but stops, and has an idea. “I’m hungry.”
Tony is not ready to do this.

when that happens. We don’t even know if they’re killing us right now.”
It all happens so fast.
“Yeah, it’s fine.” Steve tells him, and he doesn’t know if he’s lying or not. “I just wanted to know how you’re doing.”
, and what happened today was more than enough proof that we’re not
“Where are you?” Tony asks Pepper, raising his head a little so he can speak in the direction of the speakers on the ceiling. “Are you safe?”
Painfully common pleasantries. It sounds like the kind of bullshit Tony used to say to investors in charity balls and auctions, with plastic smiles and a too-tight handshake, to people he despised or didn’t care for at all.
Home is cold, this morning. Cold, everywhere but in this bed.
We're going down a memory lane for this one. Believe me, we're gonna need it.

He won’t ask her what she said to Tony that was so insulting. He won’t drag those horrid memories back up so he can hurt her.
Tony wishes he could keep her from this. That he could erase this from her mind and keep her safe from this tragedy, but he can’t.
The bubble of peace around them is already stretched thin, then. It’s not meant to last.
Tony blinks, taken completely off guard. He looks at Rogers for clarification, helpless – why is Wong asking

are there, everything goes well.
“Thanks, baby.” Tony hums, and then, in the cold dark of his empty bedroom, just because he knows no one will hear him, he asks:
He should be feeling it, shouldn’t he? The fragility in his stance. A trembling, unsure support to his tired, weary body. But he’s not. It’s like it’s not his body at all. His hands are pressed against the shower wall tightly, supporting most of his weight, his fingers curling painfully as if they could dig into the tiles, nails too short to actually scratch and hurt, but enough that he can feel the push of the wall against them as he claws at it in random, restless movements, mindless of it. He can feel that. He also feels like it’s a little hard to breathe, like it used to be with the Arc Reactor.
Okay, then.
Steve. Because that’s what Steve does. Whenever he’s disappointed, he lets people know. He doesn’t pull his punches, he isn’t so understanding. Maybe that’s what he thought he had to do, as a leader. He had to show his teammates what he thought was wrong, and push them into fixing it. Maybe not. Maybe that was just him, being cruel without thinking, demanding far too much from people when he had no right.
“Intense.” Pepper offers, with a pointed look in Tony’s direction, a look that means so much more than what she actually says. “Dangerous.”
“I wouldn’t force him into anything.” Steve grumbles, just because he can’t stay quiet about this, his voice as sharp as steel.

T’Challa is very graceful about the whole thing. He brings them to meet his mother, Queen Ramonda, and his lovely sister, Shuri. Incredible women, both of them. Women who remind him of Peggy, and make his chest ache in the most bittersweet way it can. He almost forces out a smile for them. But his face feels cold and hard like stone, like his muscles, tight with residual adrenaline, and he can only stare back at them, trying to be as respectful as he can while doing so.
that also applies to Bucky. When Steve thought he was dead, he didn’t even dare to think much about him. He did, sometimes, go to the Smithsonian and visit his own exhibit, just so he could see Bucky and the Commandos – but then again, Steve now knows why he did that. He did that to hurt himself. To remind himself why he was still fighting when all seemed pointless, it’s true, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t
“So.” Steve sighs, pulling back slowly and reclining on his chair, before giving a nervous chuckle, suddenly realizing how extremely overwhelming that felt. His hands are shaking. “You still up for this?” Steve asks coyly, looking at her from under his lashes, as if she couldn’t see right through his ridiculous attempt of sounding innocent.
If he decides to stay with them, Steve won’t object to it. But if he decides to leave, he won’t protest either. It’s Scott’s choice. Steve will be fine whatever that choice may be, because he understands that Scott has responsibilities other than the Avengers to worry about.
“We have guns. It’s not much but it does the job.”
(Isn’t that what you said to Bucky?)
Possibly. Tony doesn’t really care. The part of his mind that never shuts down, the hyperactive, science-oriented one, does wonder how they’ve been able to stay here, with no oxygen support, for as long as they have.

“The possibility of hurt.” T’Challa affirms, voice mellow and understanding, so full of genuine concern that it’s the only thing that stops Steve from replying in a very rude manner. “I do not blame you for it, Captain. We all like to avoid pain. But our actions have consequences, consequences that sometimes affect the ones we care about, but we must face them anyway. It is our burden, in this life.”
It’s not really about Scott, Natasha’s comment.
this is fucking unbelievable.
It’s not just nerves that make Steve laugh as Natasha walks away. He’s just... happy. He is happy. Maybe he shouldn’t be, maybe he should be nervous - but how can he be, when he’s here, with a ring on his finger, as Tony’s

“I’m tired of seeing you mope around, man. It’s time get this over with.
“No! It’s… cute.” Tony says, uncertain if that’s the word. “Monkey-America, paraded across the country, when all he wanted was to fight. It’s very telling. Very you. I like it. Monkey-America? Captain Monkey?”
Tony has no place in that team. They might be a team,
Tony tried his best to keep his Avenging and his life with Pepper separate, after what happened with the Mandarin. She tried her best to be comprehensive and supportive of Tony’s role as Iron Man, even after experiencing firsthand the dangers of it. He tried to step back, when she admitted she missed him and was scared for his health. She tried to be understanding and to help him after the fallout from the Accords hit him so hard that he couldn’t stand to look at the suit for the first four months.

And he’s going to make it true.
Tony has lost too much to be the same man.

He knows that Tony is staring over his shoulder. He hasn’t turned back, but he can see it in Tony’s face.

It doesn’t work.
Steve can’t take this happening again. He can’t— He can’t watch while the people he cares about tear themselves apart over guilt they shouldn’t feel, beating themselves up, carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders silently, until they’re crushed under the pressure. They can’t be dwelling on this. How can they heal, how can they move forward if the past is dragging them back?
“I will keep him company, Mr. Jarvis. I promise.” She agrees, firmly.
“Wanda…”
“The Stone didn’t kill her?” Rocket asks, confused, and with a strange twinge of surprise in his voice. “Just touching the Power Stone killed a bunch of people.”

“Thor, we need to find him.” Tony presses, as kindly as he can. “If he’s still alive, he might be the only one who can help us build this thing.”
Steve opens his mouth to reply – probably much snappier than he should – but Shuri places down the prototypes she’d been working on atop the worktable with a little too much noise to be an accident. She gets up, decidedly, and walks closer to Bucky, and Steve feels the hairs at the back of his neck bristle a little with her move, a deep-seated instinct to

What was Lang—
(He wishes he could forget.)
“Then why did you offer?” Steve jabs.
“Sounds like it was good.” Steve distractedly says, losing himself a little to the memories he has of times that he feels like were simpler, the base, instinctual, almost animal satisfaction of being capable of coordinating a powerful attack with Tony without needing to say a single word, the sheer fulfillment of
“Yes.” Tony chokes.

, sometimes, and he had Jarvis and Ana, and he knows, without a doubt, that he wouldn’t be the man he is today without their care during his earlier years.
Because he’d trusted Steve. Even when they fought even when Steve was out there, doing the very same things Tony asked him not to do, not seeing how catastrophic it would be when the consequences of his actions finally weighted on the civilians – even then, Tony had believed in him.
Because it made no sense, did it?
“Where’s Lang?” Tony blurts, confused.
“You mean—” Tony stops, and Steve stops too to look at him, startled by the way Tony’s eyes widen and his cheeks suddenly bloom red. “Are you— Are you asking me on a date?”
He might be dying.

When Rhodey nods at Tony, he’s the last one left, besides Tony and Rogers himself. It’s simply instinct to follow him, despite his hesitations. Tony thinks he should be more worried, or more annoyed at the sight of Rogers alone in his workshop as he leaves, but he isn’t. The slope of his back, hunched and heavy, and the bow of his head – nothing in his posture is confident, or arrogant, or assured. The beard gives him a more solemn look, but the posture is what really doesn’t let him be anything but concerned; It’s not

Up close, the plane looks so large it’s frightening.
They have to fly slow. The Quinjet is barely picking up any satellite signals and the dust clouds are too dense, and they can’t risk a fast trip, no matter if the chances of them encountering another aircraft on the way are slim to none. It gets really hard to see. The Compound is far away from the center of the city, remote, for both protection and comfort; But now, even the false sense of peace that the isolated location usually brought is broken, the empty, vacant spaces between the trees is glaringly obvious, it shatters the illusion, it brings the cold, harsh reality in.
(Oh.)
“We have nowhere to go.” Tony argues, weakly, removing the hand on his mouth only to press it against his face, blocking his eyes, the light too much on his sensitive irises. The weight of his own words catches up to him and he rocks back and forth again, unconsciously, his other hand instinctively laying itself over his Arc Reactor – his
isn’t it? “Because we both know most prisons can’t hold any of us, and SHIELD’s special holding cells are gone.”

“It doesn’t matter.” Steve continues, as if he cannot see Natasha’s displeasure. “Scott won’t need to tell them anything.”
“Good news, I hope?” Steve asks, and Tony can hear that he’s smiling.
“They were stopping us from helping.” Steve says through gritted teeth.
“The Accords.” Rhodey intervenes, fearing Lang might drag himself down a hole trying to explain how exactly he came to be associated with the Avengers; which is a fair concern, with how unsure Lang seems to be with the answer. “Ant-Guy was on Cap’s side against the Accords, so he was in Leipzig too, when the fight broke.”
(It’s not.)

she looked that he still treated her with kindness after such a violent goodbye, and he realizes he can’t really argue against that. She probably was really scared. Steve can’t fault her for feeling that way. They all feels scared sometimes, Wanda is just not as skilled as the rest of them in controlling it.
“Not like we had a lot of things in common. Motivation, for one – we were very different on that.” She chuckles humorlessly, a sound that comes off more from her nose than from her mouth, continuing over Steve’s emotional thoughts without hesitating. “But she was a woman who knew how to keep secrets, and she kept them well, and I

Steve nods, because that’s all he can do without losing his composure, and finally – finally – T’Challa decides it’s enough. He takes a step back, a step that doesn’t really influence anything about Steve’s trajectory to where Natasha was headed, but as soon he does, Steve recognizes the silent permission to proceed the king has just given him. That’s all he wanted. It’s all he needed.
Because he doesn’t want him.
“Alright.” Rhodey says, nodding to himself. “Then we’ll work. We’ll find a way out of this.”
He’s sorry.

They follow Wong into a long corridor, to a door. His pace is quick, rushed almost, so there isn’t much time to stop and analyze the surroundings as they follow – but it’s hard not to notice the change, because when the door opens, sand, dust, and rubble reveal themselves inside, scattered across the floor and small steps haphazardly, like an explosion has occurred in this room, irrationally large for the amount of destruction and totally contradictory to the clean environment just outside that same entrance door.

He has heard her come in almost half an hour ago, but she hadn’t said anything, just stood there leaning against the door, and Steve let her, keeping his head down and frown hidden even though he’s sure Natasha can read him like a children’s book just by his posture.

to act like he knew anything about putting himself in danger to save others?
About Tony not calling.
T’Challa smiles. “You will get over it.”
“Just one, don’t worry your pretty little head.”
Tony taps his fingers against his thigh, jittery, scratching his lower lip with his teeth in a nervous tick – should he pull up the simulations of the alloys for the armor? It seemed to hold on pretty well, all things considered. Maybe some of the other alloys could hold on even better, if he went back to the standard model instead of nanotech. What about – can he make something directly with Badassium?
“He wouldn’t have come without the soul stone.” Nebula comments, as her eyes go unfocused for a moment. “He came for Gamora first.”
Hey y'all! Sorry I wasn't able to update yesterday- I was just really busy with my family, so there wasn't much time to write :(. But, I should be able to post twice today, so keep an eye out for Chapter 7! Thanks for reading; love y'all!
Third times the charm, Tony thought as he walked into work. Today, he would be able to behave like a normal person in front of Steve. Today, he would have a sane conversation with him. I’ve seen him twice already, Tony reasoned. I’ve desensitized to how gorgeous he is. Those blue-green eyes, and stunning shoulder-to-waist ration, and huge biceps, and nice ass would no longer have an effect on him!  And yet just the thought of them made him into a flustered mess. He sighed and headed into his office. Odds were, third time wasn’t going to be the charm.
Tony sensed an opportunity here. He’d just have to speak a coherent sentence, and then he could possibly take Steve out to lunch. “We can, uh, go get you one if you want? Just tell me whatever you had to tell me on the way there.”
i’m so so sorry for not posting yesterday. i was just super duper busy and by the tome i got to writing it just wasn’t working and then when i got it to a decent place, it was too late. that being said, i’m proud of this chapter, so enjoy! love y’all!
Damn, Tony thought. He felt himself fall even more in love with Steve. “Hell yeah!” he replied, leaning in and wrapping his arms around Steve. “Hell yeah,” he said again, quieter.
Tony walked into work, holding a coffee in one hand and a pile of papers in the other. He sipped the coffee and headed towards his office, stopping when he saw the most gorgeous man ever. Who the hell is he, Tony thought, and how have I not seen him before? Tony ran over to the man, grabbing his shoulder and turning around him around to face him. He had words to say, but as soon as he looked into the man’s eyes, they all faded away. Tony realized he was staring at the man and blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Did it hurt?”
Thanks for reading! Feel free to leave comments, kudos and bookmarks, they really butter my bagel!
Steve smiled and Tony did a little happy dance on the inside. He had spoken a coherent sentence to Steve! “Oh my god, thank you so much,” Steve said. “You have no idea how much I need this.”
“Yeah,” Steve said sliding out of Tony’s hug and lacing his hand through Tony’s. “Where do you wanna go?”
But, Steve just laughed and smiled at Tony, easing some of his embarrassment. And what he wouldn’t do to hear that laugh, low and melodic, a sound that instantly put him at ease and made him feel at home.
Thanks again for reading! Feel free to leave comments, kudos, and bookmarks; they butter my muffin!
The two walked out of the office together and headed to one of Tony’s favorite sushi bars. They ate lunch, and Tony started to like Steve more and more. The better he got to know him, the more his little quirks and traits began to come out. The way the right side of his mouth came up before his left when he smiled, and the way his eyes would light up whenever he talked about his family, or the way his entire body shook when he laughed. All these little things only endeared him more to Tony. Lunch was done to soon, and they walked back to the office side by side. All Tony could think was that he really wanted to hold Steve’s hand. Like really, really wanted to. So, he swallowed a deep breath and slid his hand into Steve’s. Steve laced his fingers through Tony’s, and Tony smiled. Steve continued talking, and they walked like that the entire way back to the office.
After Tony had overcome his shock, he’d headed back into work, floating on waves of happiness. Steve seemed to like him, and that thought alone kept him energized and happy throughout the day. After work he’d headed home and slept well and through the night for the first time in a while.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, “it is.”

The pair sat like that for a while, and Tony eventually drifted off to sleep. He woke up to the sound of a frying pan, and many blankets tucked over him.
“Are you an egg?” Tony asked. “Because the moment I see you, my smile turns sunny-side up!
“Thank you Thor,” Tony said, trying to regain some semblance of cool and suaveness. Tony walked over to Steve and tapped him on the shoulder. “I’m Tony, the guy from yesterday,” he said as Steve turned around. All of the big plans to introduce himself went out the window as Tony looked into Steve’s blue-green eyes. “And if I were rearranging the alphabet, I’d put U an I together!” he blurted out. Dammit, dammit, dammit! Tony’s face turned a million shades of red, and all Steve did was look cool, calm, and collected. “I’m walking away now.” Tony said, trying to save himself the embarrassment of having to see Steve look confused and not at all interested.
“I’ve got no clue- hang on.” Rhodey stood up and strode over to the table to grab his phone. He fiddled for a second before looking up at Tony. “Ok, hum it again.”
“So now I’ve got Howard expecting me to be the perfect heir for SI, some people expecting me to buy my way out of everything and go out of my way to make everyone miserable, other people who are expecting me to look at them like they’re the dirt on my shoe, other people still who think I can help them with anything, some who think I’m a sob story they can take advantage of!

Sorry for the awkward cut here. This chapter would have been too short without it but it would mess with the nice ending of chapter 5. That being said, we are so, so sorry. Don't say we didn't warn you.

Hey guys! Jules and Mikah here. We can't tell you how long ago we started this fic- we actually shifted fandoms like 4 times since starting- but it's been fun trying to do a long term project like this. As of now, it's not finished, but we wanted to start posting anyway. Comments and Kudos are always appreciated, so enjoy!
Mikah: The storm before the storm
Tony panics over the rape, sees that Rhodey's in the hospital, panics because he misjudged his friend, and gets found by Steve and Bucky. They calm him down and go to the hospital.
“You made that up. It’s probably more like 15%, but James Barnes, this doesn’t make you any less perfect to me.” Steve reached out to touch his friend but hesitated at the flinch.
Eventually, Bucky’s latest depressive slump smoothed over enough that he decided to venture outside for some ice cream- with Steve, of course. With a glare the size of Kentucky and his prosthetic strapped on, he opened the glass door leading into the local ice cream shop, Rizuto’s. Bucky hadn’t taken more than 3 steps into the shop when a small body thumped into his left side. Bucky let out a gasp of pain as the nerves in his stubbed flared up and his breath quickened minutely.
Jules: We could NOT agree on what should and shoudn't be italicized, if we should have any bolding, how to make it easiest to read. It was not fun.

The final calm before the storm before the storm before the storm
Tony hummed for about 15 seconds. The two sat in silence for a minute before Rhodey shifted.
Bucky took over the next line.
With Rhodey under the car and Tony able to fiddle with the engine, he deemed it safe enough to start rambling.
Tony continues to self harm and enters a decidedly abusive relationship with Tiberius Stone. That's the entire chapter.
“Stark.”
“What, like at the shop?”
Steve took a step closer as he glowered at Stark. “You think you can just run anywhere you like? Don’t care about who you affect as you damage things?”
Y'all we're seriously running low on our prestocked chapters
Rhodey tightened his arms but didn’t let on that he had heard.
“You cannot tell me this is what you expected Rhodes!”
A note emerged from the blankets, containing an apology. Steve scoffed and got his favourite gold pen from his desk. On the same note, he wrote that no apologies were needed, but he did want to know how to help the lump that swallowed his best friend.
The two boys leave to get back to school. Tony withdraws a bit and finds freedom in some very unhealthy coping mechanisms. Rhodey can tell something is wrong
Steve crowded further into Stark’s space, looming over the smaller boy. Tony’s breathed hitched as he tried not to panic. This felt too much like Ty and he recognized Steve from the party so his mind was wandering back to Hammer as well. Hand digging into his pocket, he felt for the thumbtack, hooking it with his fingers. He pushed the point into his thumb, breaking his skin as he looked up at the looming blond. Anger was evident in his eyes and Tony shrank as Steve took a deep breath, viciousness coming through in his voice as he began to sing.
"Hello (ENTER MARIA'S NICKNAME FOR TONY HERE WTF WAS IT)."
Breathin'/Ariana Grande
Standing up, Tony darted away. Ignoring Rhodey’s calls, he fled, too deep in his panic to care. As he ran, he fished the tack out of his pocket, pressing it into the pad of his thumb again.

As Rhodey got up to throw their cups away, the final verse of the song that had been playing sounded, ringing in their heads as the bell for the open door jingled.

Tony contemplates jumping off the roof before deciding he couldn't do that to Rhodey
Rhodey’s phone buzzed as it recognized the tune and a few minutes later, the two were listening to the song and working on the car again.
Tony refused to look down, focusing all of his energy on the engine in front of him.
“Buck come on we need to meet Clint and Nat before they leave without us.”
Not me forgetting to post yesterday
Tony had frozen too, and his breaths began to speed up once more, less stressed and moving into panic territory. He sounded scared when he spoke.

Jules: “I saw ‘the silence was thick’ and for some reason I thought of Bucky’s forearm.”
Steve finished out the verse, reaching for Bucky’s hand.
“Tony.” Rhodey’s voice took on a dangerous, anxious tone that he tried to cover up. “What is this?!”
“You belong right next to me, Bucky. There’s no place I’d rather you be. If you fall, I’ll be right next to you, and I’ll be here all day instead of leaving without you.”
I have been waiting for this chapter for the chapter notes alone
Tony buried his head into Rhodey’s shoulder, sniffling. His voice was watery when he spoke.
“I couldn’t get near scissors for a year, Steve! I can’t watch action movies with you anymore! You can’t have as much fun anymore.”
Without words, Rhodey reached for the first aid kit under the desk and began to clean and wrap Tony’s hand. Tony’s voice was quiet and childlike when he spoke, looking at his hand.
“Buck-”

Because Tony wasn't happy.
Rhodey eyed the two but went with Tony to the front case so he could decide on a flavor. Steve bristled but turned around as Bucky tugged on his arm, ready to leave. On the walk home, the two finished out their song, angry that people like Stark could do anything while they were left to suffer.

Mikah: I figured you all should know. This fic was previously titled 'oof'. "Hey, you gonna work on oof today?" "We're totally gonna write some more oof this weekend, right?"

Back at Rizuto’s, Rhodey was looking at Tony with a concerned look on his face- though if it was from Tony’s eggnog-peppermint-ice-cream-concoction or his sudden downtrodden posture, he didn’t know. Sighing, he figured he should comment on it. If he didn’t, Tony would never talk about it.

Drawing his phone out, he sent several texts off to Tony in rapid succession before resolving to wait for Tony in the dorm.

During the first month, Steve anxiously took the phone with him everywhere, sometimes taking is out of his pocket to rub his thumb over the sides, tapping distractedly at the back, wondering if Tony had already received the package. He knew he could trust Natasha to bring the package inside, but actually delivering was another matter altogether, and no matter what year was it, 1945 or 2015, mail delivery was never too trustworthy. So he waited. Waited for like what he felt was a reasonable amount of time for package to arrive at the Tower, for Tony to read the letter and think about it a little, and then call Steve back.

Even inside the jet, Tony can feel a slight sting on his cheeks, around his nose, skin pulled tight, and he’s twitching in place nervously, adrenaline pumping strong in his veins, and he can’t wait to step out of this goddamned Quinjet and head to his lab, to tinker, to

It has been closed for a very long time, technically speaking, since it now only serves as a storage room that he rarely frequents and the only people who ever entered since he officially moved out was the cleaning staff. He hasn’t been sleeping here since he and Pepper got back together and he moved into his new place with her, somewhere small – or small

“She couldn’t do that. That was never within the range of her powers. I mean – I’m not sure how Wanda’s powers worked, Thor, but she never demonstrated any kind of… prophetic tendencies. I don’t know what you saw, but…”
Someone makes an awkward sound, and then, it’s Rocket’s voice that says, “Not like we had time to prepare—”
The man is dark-skinned, bald and stern-looking, eyes dark and mouth closed tight in an expression that is almost a grimace and speaks purely of rigid authority. He keeps his hands clasped together behind his back, showing no hesitation in putting his chest completely open, no fear in making himself a target to Jarvis’ pistol if needed so.
Of course Tony would need them. They were the Avengers. The world needed them. While they were divided, the world would never be safe.

“He came to see Wanda, and he says he brought news.” Clint continues, half whispering into the comm’s mic, constantly looking over to the side over the projection.
“Thor, be on stand-by.” Rogers says. “Be ready to keep the plane steady in case we need it.”
“It makes sense.” Bruce concedes. “No one would want an American group to just cross borders without any explanation, and then… causing explosions and just leaving.”
“That is not
He feels incredibly alone.
But… Natasha had never actually seen Bucky, did she? Not like Steve sees him.
“I have a good memory,” Tony off-handedly says;
“Tell me you’re lying!” He screams, as Nebula closes her eyes and turns her head to the side, trying to hide her face from the screams. “No!”
He can imagine her doing so before – when they leaked SHIELD’s files to the world. He wasn’t there, but he imagines it. Natasha, completely in her element, as powerful as she is now, unflinching even though he is going straight for the enemies’ jugular, standing in its territory.
“You’re not.” A voice interrupts, kind but undoubtedly firm, making itself known with no intentions of being ignored. Somewhat irritated, even. Fair, considering that Tony suddenly realizes he

Nothing, ever. His teammates keep hiding things from him and he keeps getting disappointed, they keep disappointing each other, and they fight and they disagree, they hurt each other by assuming they know best, and in the end, they only drift further and further apart. It never
That’s why we called him that. You’ve told us this.”
The man stares at him for a second, thoughtful, and he shifts in the chair uncomfortably before leaning back and confessing, in a very dry tone:

How could they not?

“Then let’s find a way to make them stop.”
She doesn’t spare him a glance. She holds her ground in front of the king, pushing her chest out and keeping her head raised, as if she’s preparing for a punch. But whatever it is that she is waiting from T’Challa, all she receives is this answer, quiet, in an almost mourning tone:

“You know…” Natasha says off-handedly, giving him a sympathetic smile. “If that’s really bothering you, you could shave it off. I wasn’t serious.”

And Nebula has seen a lot, he can tell. If Tony somehow managed to fall into the category of things that make Nebula speechless, Tony can’t imagine that whatever she is thinking about him is something good.

He knows.
Tony looks back at her, worried, and he

T’Challa stays silent for a moment, and Steve almost thinks he, for some reason, has rendered T’Challa speechless— When T’challa

Tony Stark, being actual friends with Steve Rogers.
Tony may be wallowing in sorrow for losing the woman he loves, but still, his heart finds in itself strength to squeeze even harder in sympathy for Thor’s own losses, grand and raw as they are – his mother and father, apparently, his brother, and sister, his hammer, and his home. It’s enough to make Tony wonder how can he possibly still find the strength to fight.
“Tony.” She says, “I know we haven’t dealt with this in the best way possible in the past.”
Didn’t Rogers explain anything?
Steve never thought of that.
“I’ll talk to you later, Buck.” He abruptly says, hoping the forcibly light tone he uses it’s enough to hide his panic, to make him not seem so rude, not make Bucky

He tells himself it’s about the Accords - and in some ways, it is. It is, because none of it is actually isolated, the problems just meshing together like paints spilled across the table, muddy colors and cold water dripping over the corners, staining everything they touch. Exactly like that, they spill over the corners of the barriers he puts up, overflowing like a dam too full, drowning everything else until all he can see is the flood.

Tony huffs a laugh. “You think I trust him to hand me anything?

And Tony knows why. Because he ran the math, and the numbers do not lie – if pressured, Tony would shut down. And despite his worry, JARVIS needed Tony to continue working.
“We have to.” Rocket says, sourly. “We have no choice.”
“That’s not gonna happen.” Clint mumbles.
They all got the same fate. They all ended up being taken.

“I’m thankful anyway. But even though I was not the best mother, Jarvis, I still am his mother. And I miss him terribly. So, you must understand that when Howard gave me this, gave me a tiny piece of him, I couldn’t refuse it. I can’t deny myself whatever of my son I can still have.”

Over the years, Tony and Pepper have fought a lot. Before they were a thing, they'd fight about meetings and stocks, about Tony's dismissal for the shareholders and Pepper's insanely rigid schedule, about how they had always been different in their approaches, two people who shouldn’t have worked well together but they did, because they made it work. It drove them crazy, but they did it. They became a force to be reckoned with – and it’s hard, not to fall in love with it. With the feeling of belonging against all odds, to defy fate and

It’s not just this once, is it? It’s every time. Every time, every time something happens, the mere inkling of fear that it could be the last has Tony moving faster than Pepper’s hands can hold him, beyond all limits or regards, to protect other lives despite his own. And she will always worry. When he’s fighting, she’ll worry he won’t come home, and if he’s home, she’ll always worry when he’ll be fighting next. Even if he says he won’t. Can he really make that promise?
