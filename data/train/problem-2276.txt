Once again we made our way to the crime scene and when we got there it seemed just like the last one. Loads of police surrounding a brick house with the disorientating red and blue flashing lights coming from the tops of police cars. How do they deal with this everyday?
Okay this chapter is a little violent so just be warned (this is the bit I enjoy writing).
Over the next few days we barely spoke other for him to give me orders or for me to ask permission to do so. Conversation was kept to a minimal, as it should be between a master and his slave, I was Sherlock's property and not his friend. What ever relationship we may have had before had vanished. He no longer took me to crime scenes so through out the day my only company was Mrs Hudson who was still nice to me. Sherlock and I settled into a comfortable routine where we knew what we were doing so as to avoid conversation. In the morning my alarm would wake me up. I would walk downstairs and cook breakfast, according to the menu we had worked out, I would wait for him to eat before I indulged myself then washed up. At that point Sherlock would either leave for the police station or Bart's hospital, or stay in the living room and wait for clients. I would clean up the house, cook dinner for us both then go to bed. The routine bored me but at least I had something to keep my mind busy. If I had nothing to do my mind would be filled with depressing thoughts of hopelessness. I couldn't escape. I would never be able to get the collar out my head. I would be tracked where ever I went, caught, then probably tortured for running away. I couldn't go to anyone for fear they would get arrested and even if I did manage to run away and stay free I would never be able to settle down and have a family. I was broken in spirit. There was no going back. Sherlock and I would never be able to repair the relationship that we had and in all honesty I didn't want to. He was my master, not my friend, and I didn't want to make that mistake again.
I was about to leave when I realised I had no idea were the bins were. I turned to Sherlock but I didn't even need to ask.
After performing a few checks on the body I turned to Sherlock and said, "Well I would say he was mid-thirty's judging by his hair colour and how he looks, um... it looks as if his killer was a professional one strike to the heart and the man died then once he was dead the killer put him like this." I looked to Sherlock expectantly then to the other police officers on the scene, Lestrade was standing at the back watching over everything.
Getting dressed I walked into the living room and saw Sherlock lying on the sofa in his thinking position as usual but I ignored him. I wasn't in the mood for his condescending attitude. I walked into the kitchen and made some soup, after everything we had done today I was hungry so about twenty minuets later there was a pot of soup on the hob in case Sherlock was hungry, as my master I had to make sure his needs came above my own, and sat down with a bowel full. Within a few seconds I had eaten it and was feeling bloated. Still ignoring Sherlock I went and sat on the floor next to the sofa and he, in turn, left me alone.
When I left the apartment I hailed a cab, James' apartment wasn't to far away, hopefully I could get there and get the tracker sorted before anyone noticed.
"Go away," The man said stubbornly.
I did as he said then disappeared into my small dark desolate room and went to sleep.
Sherlock slammed the door after him and turned to me.
I didn't reply I just stood there looking at him with hatred.
"Did you mean it?" I asked while I still had the nerve, "Do you... love me, Sherlock?" I had my eyes trained on him. I needed to here it.
"Okay, three, two, one.." The doctor said and a second later I felt the liquid touch my skin. Without the leather I would have screamed, as it was I cried out into the leather, I shut my eyes tighter but other then that I lost sense of my surroundings. The pain could have gone on for hours or only second but I didn't know because time meant nothing in my mind; only the pain existed in my head.
"John," I heard him say behind me. I turned around to reply but he was fast asleep. "John, I love you. Don't leave me John," he continued so I decided to stay for a bit. He would never tell me things like this when fully conscious.
Mycroft turned around to face her and gave her the same inhuman look, which appeared to be a smile, that he gave me. "Your right, I'm sorry, thank you for letting me in," he said then turned back around and opened the door in front of him, his smile dropping. "Hello, brother mine," he said, the person in the room didn't reply.
Slowly I came to, looking around I noticed I was in my room back at the apartment, what happened? I swung my legs off the bed, stood up, and went downstairs. Mycroft was sitting on a chair in the living room, Sherlock was no where in sight. Upon seeing Mycroft I suddenly remembered what happened earlier and groaned internally. Glancing at the clock I noticed it was 6:30 pm, wow I had been unconscious for hours, then I looked at him. Mycroft looked calm but it was Sherlock I was worried about, I did steal his money and run away, what would he do?
I noticed Sherlock crouching over the body with a little magnifying glass, I stayed away but within earshot in case Sherlock wanted something. About a minuet later Sherlock stood and came over to me, "Your turn Doctor what can you deduce from looking at this body,"
I snorted at that before, I could help myself, and received another glare making me shift uncomfortably in my seat. "My brother needs a slave more than I do. The first thing you need to know about my brother is that he has never had a slave. He doesn't trust himself with one because he tends to get a bit carried away with things but I'm sure you will do fine," he said smiling at me. The smile looked so forced it morphed his face into something that no longer looked human. "Just because he has never had a slave don't think you can get away with things, about a week ago I spoke to him and taught him how to treat a slave."
I stood there thinking, would Sherlock do that, it doesn't matter whether he would or not because either way it was impossible for me to leave.
"Hello, Sergeant Donovan, that's a big word are you sure you know how to use it? Anyway no this is my colleague Doctor John Watson now if you don't mind I have a case to solve," He replied walking past her to the main road.
"Follow me John and put on the gloves on your way in," Sherlock said entering the house putting gloves on himself.
"Okay but what about the note?" Lestrade said walking over.
I wasn't expecting the pain so when it hit me it almost knocked me off my feet. I doubled over in pain as it consumed my every thought. My head in my hands I tried to control it remembering my military training. Deep breaths and I tried to think of Harry, I was doing this for Harry.
"And off course if you can't be bothered to say that full sentence or you are just to angry to say it you could tell him to heel instead and it would give him the same pain as if you had said pain setting 5 but where is the fun is that. Now stand up John" I heard the doctor say but I ignored him and just curled tighter into a ball. Sharp pain spread through my limbs but quickly left not leaving me enough time to react. "This would be a good point to show you the mind control option, you simply say 'Activate control' then 'John' finally say the command so for example to make him stand up you say authoritatively 'John- stand up'" As soon as the doctor said it I lost all control of my body I stood up. I tried everything to make my body stop but it was as if I was a puppet on a string, I simply had no control, I felt helpless as if the last bit of my free will had been taken away. But I was still me and that was all that mattered! "Then when you have finished just say, 'De-activate control' and it will be as it was."
I collapsed to the ground from the shock and my rage quickly dissipated into nothingness; in the pain I realised I wasn't really angry at Mycroft, I was angry at myself for trusting him. Those were the only thoughts going through my head other then how bad the pain was. I refrained from screaming but I couldn't help from writhing on the floor in agony as it consumed my entire being. It was only after a minuet did I realise Mycroft had said, "Pain off," It was almost as if it hadn't registered in my head but when it did I was confused if Mycroft had stopped the pain why was I still feeling it. Then I realised the pain wasn't coming from the collar, it was coming from my own thoughts, I was torturing myself.
"So now I'm stuck with this thing in my brain and I have no idea how to disable it." I concluded feeling as if a great weight had been lifted off my chest.
"M-M-M-Master?" I stammered nervously feeling his eyes scan my body.
About 20 minuets later the cab pulled up in front of a block of flats that looked so worn down it looked as if no one lived there. I paid the cab driver and went inside, it only took me a few minuets to find the right apartment and a moment later a tall middle aged man with greying hair and blue eyes was standing in the doorway.
I breathed deeply for a moment because I knew if I spoke my voice would break. After I composed myself I looked down and said, "It's a long story James," then I told him everything. It was the first time I had really been able to speak about it.
"I have no clue what you are talking about." Mycroft replied walking around his desk so he was in front of Sherlock. They were no more than a meter apart, both glaring daggers at each other. I just stayed back not wanting to get involved.
"Is it bad, what you think it is anyway?" I asked needing to know. I was edging closer on my seat, I was about to get answers.
The bed was a mess. It was covered in blood and semen but I didn't care. I smiled a genuine smile for the first time remembering what just happened and turned to face Sherlock.
"My head, John?" Sherlock said and I knew what he was asking for. I walked to the cupboard and pulled out the paracetamol. I turned around to find his eyes fixed on me. Once again I felt my face warm up and I ignored it but I could tell Sherlock noticed, he cocked his head slightly but said nothing. I walked over and passed him the paracetamol. Before I could turn away he grabbed my wrist and looked into my eyes, in my position I knew I shouldn't but I stared back and lost myself in them. I felt my heart beat speed up and suddenly my trousers became slightly too tight. That did not help my situation and I felt my cheeks heat up even more. I could tell he was looking into my pupils to see if they dilated, he did the same thing with Irene and I hoped against hope that my body wouldn't betray me. Of course since when did any of us have control over our bodies to such a degree.
"Ahhh, could you perhaps be a little bit quieter?" He asked with his eyes tightly shut.
"So John, how did you meet Sherlock?" A voice said behind me. Startled I turned around to see Sergeant Donovan standing behind me hands on her hips.
I got up and went over to Sherlock's laptop, not for any reason I was just bored, and was surprised to see it wasn't password protected. Slowly a plan formed in my mind, if Sherlock wasn't near me then he couldn't order me and control me. As long as I never saw Sherlock, or Mycroft, then I would be okay but I could still be tracked. I went on the internet and searched for someone who could help; I knew a few people who left the army who were good with technology and lived nearby but who would help me. A few minuets later I had an address, how long would it be before Sherlock or Mycroft realised I had left. The only thing that still nagged at my mind was the mind control thing. If I started to run away would it make me come back here? In the end I dismissed the thought, Mycroft hadn't said anything about not being able to run once I got here. I walked over to where Sherlock's coat was hanging and grabbed a bunch of notes out of his pocket and put it away, 'Sherlock wouldn't be needing that,' I thought before grabbing my coat and scarf and left.
The pain hit like a bomb; my back arched and I threw my head back letting out a scream before I hit the ground. My limbs betrayed me and I convulsed on the ground screaming and crying, I lost all sense of time, the pain could have been going on for days or even years for all I knew because the torture seemed to never end.
The day went on as usual and I stayed invisible like a good little slave. That was until Sherlock got up without a word at the end of the day and grabbed his coat to go out. I followed him silently and ignored the disgusted looks thrown at me by strangers on the street as they notices my collar. I was so used to it by now that I barely noticed them anymore. I was confused when Sherlock walked into a bar and ordered alcohol.
Suddenly I started to feel somthing build up deep inside of me and I realised I was moments away from coming. "Sher...Master, I-I..." I couldn't finish my sentance. My back bowed of the bed and my toes curled. Any moment now... then he stopped.  I whimpered again at his absence and tugged at my restraints causing the cuts to deepen and more blood to flow.
"Do you have any idea what..?" I started but before I finished Sherlock interrupted pulling the covers down annoyed before shooting me a glare.
"Why are you making this so difficult?" He said his voice menacing. I didn't sound like Sherlock at all and it took me a moment to understand why. He was so filled with lust that his judgment was being clouded. "It's like you want pain. Fine, I can't wait any longer. You want pain? I will make you scream you bloody masochist!"
I decided to defend Sherlock seeing as it hadn't been his idea, "I'm John and master didn't want a slave, I was a none returnable present from his brother, so here I am." I said and that put Molly at ease.
"Gods, yes" I said and pulled him down to me to show I meant it.
"Amazing," I said absent mindedly.
"Come John, give me the scarf there is no point in it now, we need to get back to the apartment." Sherlock said walking out the room and I followed submissively handing him the scarf.
"Yes, I'm afraid so. So, as I'm sure you know, it will defiantly cause your skin to scar because it destroys skin cells and it will whiten your skin. Now bite the leather tightly because this will hurt... A lot." The doctor said grimly. I nodded glad I had a truthful doctor. His attitude surprised me. He seemed nice, as if he actually cared, and acted sorry for me. Well at least that meant he wouldn't hurt me on purpose. I bit the leather hard and shut my eyes tightly.
One hour later Sherlock was completely drunk and I decided that, that was enough. He was so drunk he probably wouldn't even stop me taking him home and stepping out of line.
Most the officers left leaving only Sherlock, Anderson, Lestrade, and myself in the room.
I dropped the shopping bags then bent over trying to catch my breath.
We drove for another half an hour before we finally pulled up in front of 221B Baker Street. Mycroft got out the car and walked towards the door, he obviously wanted me to follow so I got out the car and stood behind him. The door was black with a door knocker that was crooked and 221B above it in gold letters and numbers. He banged on the door with the knocker and straightened it at the same time. A moment later an old woman answered the door.
"Oh shut up Anderson, I was invited." Sherlock replied smugly pushing him aside as he headed to the house leaving the man looking after us in fury.
"John," He whispered quietly. I wouldn't have heard it if I was still by the door.
"Well, maybe I could ask the right questions if you told me what the hell is wrong!" I said starting off normal and ending up yelling taking a step towards Sherlock.
"You keep forgetting the rules John, don't do it again. Follow me." He said emotionless.
"Sherlock, this is your slave John..." Mycroft started but then was cut off.
"Only that our entire economy depends on it. The chips get disabled and slavery gets abolished but what then. We go back to our happy lives? No, I don't think so. We make a lot of money from slavery, it is what makes our country strong. People that don't have money and would end up on the streets have a home because they are slaves. Criminals, instead of cluttering up jails they serve the people and the government makes money out of it. Slaves are made to do the jobs that the free people don't want to do and they don't have to get paid, just get given a home and food. You get rid of slavery and suddenly the government is down millions of pounds, the people that made money out of slavery rebel and become a problem, it is just easier keeping the system the way it is. Changing it will make a lot of important people very unhappy." Mycroft said, his face void of emotion.
I followed him, still shaking, out the door grabbing my coat and scarf for the second time today on my way out, time to see another dead body.
"Now go make yourself useful while I read this," Sherlock said waving the booklet Mycroft gave him then turned and walked out the room into what I assumed to be his bedroom.
"Amazing, but what I want to see is how bad the pain can get" Mycroft said behind me.
"Hi," I said as I walked into the living room.
"I-I-I um..." I stuttered unsure of what to say. He walked over to me with a confused look.
The food wasn't at all bad, in fact it was probably the tastiest thing I had every made.
"You couldn't possibly mean...?" He said droning off at the end.
"I won't be having dinner so feel free to get yourself something." Sherlock said.
Ummm... they have sex. That's pretty much it nothing really important happens until the end so if you don't want to read smut then just read the last paragraph.
"I have an idea but the problem is proof." Sherlock looked frustrated so I didn't push him. He raised his hands to cover his face and scrunched up his eyes.
Okay, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry for the lack of chapters, I can't even promise that I'm back. I'm very busy but I write when I can. This chapter may not be the best, I haven't spent as much time on it as I spent on the rest of the story because I wanted to get it up on the website as quickly as I could. I felt really bad leaving it on the cliff hanger I did, this one isn't as bad. I don't think I'm near finishing the story yet but we're getting there. As always, constructive criticism is welcome. I hope you enjoy!
We entered the building and walked along a few dark, miserable corridors and then the woman stopped abruptly.
"Don't give me that crap, you've always boasted about how important and smart you are. If you can't shut this down then no one can." Sherlock said, disbelief written across his face.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade, this is my assistant Doctor John Watson. He served in the army so I thought he might be helpful," Sherlock said confusing me but I tried to hide it; obviously he didn't want the police to know I was his slave, not that I knew why but that still doesn't explain how he knew I'm a doctor? I never told him I was an army doctor, where did he get that... It must have been from Mycroft, he would have know for sure.
"No, unless you mean the way he is laid out because they all have had a knife stabbed threw there heart and their arms are laid out strangely." Lestrade said looking puzzled.
"So, um. What are we going to do?" I asked quietly after I found my voice. We had to do something.
"Amazing," I said under my breath but Sherlock seemed not to hear.
"Do you have any idea what that was?" I asked because I had no clue.
"Yes Master," I quietly replied chastised then followed him inside.
We arrived at Bart's about 10 minuets later.
"Very well," I heard the doctor say, I clenched my fists and shut my eyes, I knew what was to come. "John- pain setting 10" The pain was excruciating, I lost complete control of my body. I felt the floor beneath me as I let out a blood curdling scream. My whole body was on fire, I felt as if I was drowning in the lava that consumed my body; I struggled to breath as if my head had just sunk under the oncoming torrent of pain. Then suddenly the pain stopped, I curled into a ball trying to recover but I knew I wouldn't have long to rest.
Warning- There will be smut in the next chapter.
After I decided my heart wasn't going to explode out of my chest I grabbed the shopping again and walked into the kitchen to put the everything away.
"I knew it," He said in a deadly tone. I felt the bed move as a positioned himself on the bed. I could feel him lean down to me so his lips where by my ear. "This will hurt a lot," He warned almost nicely but I could hear the sadistic side in his tone.
I went downstairs to find that Sherlock was already up and about pacing back and forth across the room. "John, I'm close, I really am close to finding the killer now." He said not looking at me.
"Yes, yes I know. Thank you for stating the obvious. When I said go away I was talking only to you, not to the slave. Leave him and go." Sherlock said bluntly.
"Oh but you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. The micro-chip." Sherlock said practically spitting at the end. If looks could kill Mycroft  would be dust. The moment Sherlock said the word 'micro-chip' the blood drained from Mycroft's face, his mouth opening and closing as if he wanted to say something but couldn't. He leaned back against the desk and let out a breath of air, almost as if the wind had been knocked out of him. Shakily, he walked back around the desk and sat down. "So you do know." Sherlock said going quiet again and stepping back almost in disbelief. I didn't blame him. "Shut it down." Sherlock's voice sounded final but Mycroft only shook his head.
"It's like a micro-chip." Sherlock said turning to me and walking closer. "When we are young we don't understand what's going on, we don't even really have an opinion. We believe what our parents believe, we think as our parent think. When you are young you are not your own person. As you get older these things changed. You start to get your own opinion, but the government can't have this. If children can think for themselves then they can start to oppose the natural order of things, slavery being a big issue. We are brought up with slavery all around us, but what if the children didn't agree. 10 years down the line slavery gets abolished because too many people have an opinion. The government can't have this, no, no, no, no. They make far too much money from it. The only way to tackle this is to change how these children think before they become older. So all children aged 7 or over get an operation, much like yours, where a... um micro-chip, gets implanted in their brains to adapt the way they think. Slavery is a good thing they are made to think. Of course these chips are disabled when you are about to become a slave. There is no point having them in slaves because they are not meant to have an opinion anyway, there is nothing that they can do; it would just be a waste of money. Anyway, all things have a fault. The micro-chips are meant to make us agree with slavery and all it stands for, but what if we go against it, even without meaning to, what if someone with the micro-chip loved a slave. Last night I admitted my love for you. The microchip tried to change my mind but failed and broke. While it was trying to change my mind I was in agony, when it failed and broke, it released me. The blood coming out of ear just proves it. I have had this idea for a while but my mind would always be changed, almost against my will, I have looked into it but then was forced to stop. Then I was freed and could think about it all I want. It's the only thing that makes sense. I feel different now. I no longer feel the need to punish you for going against the rules, or to command you to do things. I don't feel like you are my slave anymore, so while we are in private you can act how you want but in public we need to keep up the pretence." Throughout his whole speech I was rendered mute. I couldn't believe it.
I sat across the table from Mycroft trying to avoid his gaze. I should have died in the army, the fact I was shot and only injured complicated things a little. I was meant to give my life for the county in war and in return my sister Harry would be looked after and not made a slave due to her debt but now I'm not in the army, I'm useless, and now my sister is in danger of becoming what I have tried to protect her from. I knew the ultimatum was coming.
Tom jumped in, “The police consult him when they are out of their depth.”
-----
There were many memories captured within these walls, some pleasant, some most definitely not. Memories of him running around with his sister, closer in age to him than Mycroft, conducting experiments in the garden or rummaging through the attic. Mycroft assisted when asked, he even set up adventures and mysteries for his younger siblings to solve. Eventually, however, as they grew older, Mycroft was rarely home and his sister’s intelligence caused her to rebel from all things family related.  By the time Sherlock was in his teens, both of his siblings had moved out and he was alone in the large house, with his interests falling to less than desirable pursuits.
Thank you to everyone who has been reading and commenting, here and on Twitter.  It makes my day every time I get an email notification about a kudos or a comment!
The rest of the day kept John busy with hanging decorations, blowing up balloons, and helping Mrs. Hudson with the food. “Mind the veggie skull, dear, the cauliflower tends to roll,” John looked down and nodded as he carefully carried the tray upstairs.
Sherlock looks into John’s eyes. “I want to stay.”
“We wrote our Valentine cards for tomorrow,” Rosie answers, “and there are some left over so you can write yours, too!” She’s looking at both John and Sherlock as she speaks.
“No, this one’s not for Rosie,” he quickly says, putting it behind his back.
“Oh my goodness, what a pleasure it is to meet you! I’ve seen all your films!” She then turned to Tom, “Thomas Holmes!  How could you not let us know John Watson was going to be joining us this evening? And Mrs. Turner’s away at her daughter’s - she’ll never believe me! Always pulling out her pictures of the day she met ‘this one’ or ‘that one’. And now John Watson is in my house! She’ll think I’m pulling her leg.”
Sherlock noticed Tom’s feigned normality the entire drive but he refused to give in and make any conversation about the events of Christmas Eve. It was bad enough he let Tom witness his emotions after everyone left last night. Sherlock had berated Tom for not warning him ahead of time regarding their dinner guest and letting him make a fool of himself.  “I invited him to the morgue, for heaven’s sake!” he had moaned as he grabbed his hair and spun in a circle.
Awwww, I know - no John Watson in this chapter! Don't worry, he'll be back in Chapter 4 (wink wink...)
He heard a bright, airy sound, and this time he was able to see a woman playing a flute in the building across the street. She was standing sideways in her window to allow the sound of her music to travel. He saw the few people outside on the street stop and look up and around as they heard the music as well.
But John looked at Sherlock and chuckled, then walked towards Molly. He held his hand out, “Hi, I’m John. Pleasure.”
He starts to push himself back up when he feels a hand on his shoulder and a sleepy, “Don’t go. Warm,” coming from a groggy Sherlock, who is still on his side with his eyes closed, and who then falls right back into his slumber. John can’t deny him, so he closes his eyes and is sleeping again moments later.
Finally, one Friday morning, they break. Sherlock is exhausted, John is sore, and Rosie (as the only tenant of 221B getting any REM sleep) is a tireless ball of energy.
“Which they always are!” Rosie added. Startled, Sherlock looked up and shifted his eyes between the two of them. Rosie continued speaking to her dad, “Sherlock helped solve the suicide-murder cases a few months ago.”
“Of course.” Sherlock ran a hand over his eyes as he rounded his chair. His deduction skills seemed to disappear around this man.
-----
Sherlock sighed and sat. “Anderson contaminated the crime scene so I couldn’t discern anything and Grant sent me thirty minutes outside London to investigate, which was the complete opposite direction of where I needed to be. When I returned they had ‘solved’ it. I’m not entirely convinced there was a case at all.” He narrowed his eyes and stared into space. John looked down at his lap, attempting not to make eye contact.
Rosie looked towards the kitchen, “I can’t wait! And thank you for letting us invite my dad on such short notice. I thought he was going to be away for work but he was able to come home at the last minute. He was right behind us in his car, I’m sure he’ll be here soon.”
John stood and assessed the situation. Everything was ready to go, even the cake was waiting in the fridge, complete with a fondant dagger stabbed dead center on top.
Sherlock huffed and threw down his fork. He needed a change of conversation.
The moment Sherlock saw the box of Valentine cards at the store he knew Rosie would love them for her friends.  Now, sitting with her at the kitchen table watching her slowly write each classmate’s name on the buzzing bee cards with her little tongue sticking out, he’s reminded so much of John it makes him want to tuck one little card away for his flatmate. He won’t. Instead he suggests Rosie write out an extra to her dad. But the thought of slipping a little “Bee Mine” under John’s pillow brings a small smile to Sherlock’s face as he tidies up the crayons.
Sherlock immediately grabbed the phone, “No!” he yelled. Closing his eyes, and breathing deeply, he regulated his voice and continued, “No. Apologies. I am able to talk.” His mouth gaped open, and he tried to think of another sentence to contribute, but he came up blank.
They must have shifted during the night because John wakes up looking at Sherlock’s face. Sherlock is a wreck. His curls are plastered with sweat, there are tear tracks on his cheeks, and he needs to brush his teeth. And John can’t remember ever waking up to such a beautiful sight. He comes to the realization that he loves this man more than anything, and it takes his breath away.
Sherlock’s sister returned home one day with a baby boy. He was immediately enthralled with the infant in a way he couldn’t have predicted. As Tom grew into a toddler, he was left with his grandparents more and more as Sherlock’s sister began to spend less and less time with the family. Sherlock would always be on his best behavior when he knew he was going to see Tom, staying sober and giving Tom his undivided attention. The way Tom looked at him reminded Sherlock of how he himself used to look at Mycroft when he was younger. He vowed not to betray Tom in the way Mycroft did by growing up and leaving when Sherlock needed him the most.
“I can’t picture you as a GP,” Sherlock replied.
Mortified, John walks upstairs. John knows exactly what he said.
John is lost in thought when Sherlock pushes open the bathroom door that was left ajar. “What are you doing on the floor, John? Are you injured?” he asks seeing the med kit.
John took a deep breath. “I’m amazed it all came together, but it looks like yes. Guests, decorations, games, cake. There will most certainly be a party tomorrow night.” He paused. “How will the guest of honor react? I have no clue.”
“Oh, Mummy, nothing has ever quite entertained me more.”
“Not for months. Close to a year.” Sherlock leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “Then one day a young sergeant showed up at my door and dropped a box of cold cases at my feet. By this time Tom was living with me. Gave me a month to solve them and said if I could accomplish that, he’d see about letting me on live cases.”
John sits up, answers the phone and listens to his daughter laugh with Molly encouraging her in the background. He tells Molly tomorrow afternoon would be great to drop Rosie back, thanks her, and hangs up. He hears Sherlock fill the kettle and take out the pans for breakfast.
Rosie managed to keep her facial features calm until Sherlock left to go get dressed, then her face beamed. “We have all day, Daddy!”
“Well, dear, you certainly seemed to embrace it when I suggested it when Tom was younger,” Mrs. Hudson chimed in as she entered the room.  Rosie stood up and Mrs. Hudson gave her a big hug. “He was sold when I told him he could buy the fish whole and dissect them as he cooked,” she conspiratorially whispered into Rosie’s ear.  “We’re so glad you’re here with our Tom, he’s told me all about you!”  Rosie laughed as Tom took his turn to hug Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock stood there with his phone in his hand, completely dumbfounded. “Goodbye, John Watson,” he said to no one.
She took his hand and shook it while smiling, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Holmes.” She continued to look around the room, twisting her neck to look into the kitchen. Sherlock was confused. “Have you ... lost something?” he slowly asked her, looking in the same direction.
John’s phone rings. They both softly laugh. “It’s Molly,” Sherlock says and rolls out of bed.
John laughed and slapped the table. “I knew it! And so your career began!”
Sherlock picked up his violin and began with a somber melody.
“Do you want to talk about it?” John asks. Another head shake is Sherlock’s reply - still not looking up, still no words. John looks around, bites his bottom lip and takes a leap. “Would you like me to stay?” After a beat, he sees Sherlock barely nod his head.
“Yeah. I do,” John replied brightly. “If I’m allowed? Or if you’d rather not...” he trailed off hesitantly.
Sherlock Holmes very rarely paid any attention to popular culture. He didn’t listen to the radio or watch telly.  He seldom watched films. Unless that film had a certain actor in it. A certain actor who, while he might not be on everyone’s favorite list, was most certainly on Sherlock’s. In fact, he was the only celebrity to ever give Sherlock pause, which said a lot. That actor was John Watson. Who was currently standing in Sherlock’s sitting room, awkwardly holding two bottles of wine.
“There you are.” John climbed onto the fire escape and joined Sherlock. “Wasn’t sure where you’d gone off to. Everything’s winding down. Mrs. Hudson is taking Rosie for the night.”
“Again, mate, not my division. I took care of my end. I give it about another half hour before Sherlock realizes the case I sent him on was a wild goose chase. You better sort this soon.” He trotted down the stairs yelling, “Cheers!”
The morning slowly crept into afternoon with John on his blog and Sherlock finally showering, then jumping from experiment to experiment. John wasn’t at all surprised when Sherlock ended up stretched out in his chair, legs jumping and hands fidgeting with a squash ball. He didn’t want to think about what piece of furniture would be sacrificed if Sherlock decided to throw it.
“No, I think not Mrs. Hudson. Another time.” He knew his hands were shaking too much to hold his violin and handle the bow. At the present moment he couldn’t imagine them ever being steady again. She gently slapped his shoulder and walked over to Rosie and Tom standing by the tree.  Sherlock could hear her pointing out to Rosie the various ornaments Tom made in school over the years. He suddenly realized he was standing there alone with John Watson.
Sherlock took a deep breath and grabbed the wine. “Thank you!” he said a bit too loudly. Then he gasped and looked into the kitchen. His eyes went wide then relaxed a bit and looked back at John in relief, “Oh, it’s Christmas Eve.” John looked behind him at the spread in the kitchen, took in the smells, and after a second his face lit up. He looked back at Sherlock and laughed. “Yes, good fortune there!”
John laughs, “Yeah, I can agree to that.” Smiling, he brings their mouths back together and they kiss as they giggle and try to comprehend how much their lives have changed in just two days.  Sherlock wraps his entire body around John’s and whispers into his ear, “I love you, John. Always.” John holds Sherlock tightly and promises himself he’ll never let go.
The music soared higher and higher, as each musician played the same tune but added their own individuality - their own voice. Sherlock led them all. John felt goosebumps all over his skin.
“Are you working on any cases now?” John asked in between mouthfuls.
Six months.  Six months since John moved back into Baker Street with Rosie and the nightmares show no signs of ebbing. There are recurrent images of Mary bleeding out in the aquarium, images of Rosie crying in an empty room for her mother, and as always, images of Sherlock’s body lying crooked and bloody on the pavement in front of St. Bart’s.
Sherlock turned his head. John didn’t have to think. He leaned in and touched his lips to Sherlock’s. Nothing happened for a moment, then they both began to kiss sweetly and gently.
Tom was laughing as Sherlock walked into the room. “Yes, Tom, on this point I do have to agree with Mrs. Hudson. Although I hardly think I was ready to fall on the floor.” He sat down not looking at the two of them, grabbing the Christmas Day paper and reading the front page headlines while holding it high in front of his face.
It was evident the name held no recognition to his parents. Normal questions followed with Tom enthusiastically describing Rosie to them.
-----
John chuckles. “I left a little bear for her at Mrs. Hudson’s so she wouldn’t see it. I’ll run down to get it if you want to finish up here.”
-----
“You and me both,” John agreed. He looked at his friend. “How long have you known?”
After the last emotional note, Sherlock stood still at the window, violin still in place at neck, breathing in deeply.
Their long nap backfires a bit when it gets close to midnight and neither man is tired. They lapse into a comfortable silence as Sherlock migrates back to his crickets and John works on his blog.  It’s close to 1:30am when John rises to his feet, “I’m going up. I’d say you should go to bed, but I know who I’m talking to.” Sherlock smiles softly without looking away from the lens and simply says, “Good night, John.”
Everyone else looked at them strangely. “Fish,” they replied simultaneously, looking at each other.  Because John Watson is a pescatarian, as Sherlock (embarrassingly) knows.
John ducked back in and turned to Sherlock, who was completely lost in the music. He was playing as he hadn’t in a long time. He played with passion. Strength. Fervor. John couldn't take his eyes off of him.
that made Sherlock stand up. He might not be as eager to embrace their new situation as John, but he also knew how hard John had been working lately, and it wasn’t likely to let up any time soon. If John wanted to hear Sherlock play, he would play.
Tom, well used to Sherlock’s mood swings, just took it all in stride and told his father that he had acted absolutely fine.  “Everyone had a fun time,” he assured, “you’re reading too much into this. And who knows, maybe you
“No we haven’t, dear.” Mr. Holmes dutifully replied.
“Mycroft said… ” She paused to remember. “The less you know, the better!”
Rosie and Tom looked at each other and smiled as Rosie began, “We were the only ones at a book signing. Well, I was the only one at this book signing…”
“Ah,” John purses his lips and looks around the room. Anything to not be caught staring. He really needed sleep. “Tea?”
Molly arrives before the hour is through and is delighted to have her goddaughter for the weekend, rambling on to Rosie about their plans as she carries the baby down the stairs and out the front door. Rosie’s giggles can be heard through the open windows as they get into the taxi and drive away.
John stared incredulously at the pile of party supplies on the kitchen table that was growing larger and larger. “What am I supposed to do with all this?”
“Yet she chooses to be involved with you?” Sherlock deadpanned as he gave the batter a quick stir.
Sherlock regained his wits. “Thank you for the wine. Will you excuse me for just a moment?” He calmly walked into the kitchen, gingerly set the wine down on the counter, and continued straight down the hall into his bedroom.  He gently closed the door behind him and then his body began to shake as he proceeded to slide down the back of the door onto the floor.  He held his head in his hands and tried to breathe.
John cut her off, “Wha…? Where did she come up with these?” He pointed straight ahead, “One game. ONE.”
They were all sitting around the breakfast table the next morning when Sherlock announced, “Lestrade has some cold cases he’d like me to examine, I’ll be gone until this evening”
Sherlock inhales, stretches his legs down, and opens his eyes. He shivers. Not breaking eye contact, John takes the edges of the blanket and pulls it up over their shoulders. Sherlock sinks his head into the pillow a little more and squints his eyes at John, definitely deducing him. John lets him. Sherlock inhales sharply and John feels those eyes look into his soul. The space between them closes. John softly smiles. He’s ready. They’re ready.
Sherlock’s eyes continued to track John as he left the kitchen.  It hadn’t escaped his notice that John had been staring a little more lately, and as much as Sherlock wished his feelings for his flatmate were reciprocated, he couldn’t let himself dwell. Things were more than good and that would have to be enough.
John walks down the hallway and is about to knock on Sherlock’s door when he pauses and pulls the small valentine out of his back pocket. He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a few deep breaths before dropping it into the bag. It’s not like he wrote a sonnet on it, and if Sherlock doesn’t react then John can just laugh it off and claim he was caught up in Rosie’s enthusiasm. He knocks on the door before he can change his mind. “Sherlock?”
“Thank you.” John closes his eyes, takes a few deep breaths and pulls Sherlock a little closer burrowing his face into Sherlock’s neck.  Warm, they both finally drift back to sleep.
“So Sherlock, what do you do?” John asked as he served himself from the array of platters on the table. John seemed eager to steer the conversation away from himself.
John chuckled and went back to making dinner. “And what will this sign say?”
“Thanks again for bringing me here. I always wondered how my life would have turned out if I decided to study medicine,” John said.
to Sherlock as John had his back to her, already exploring the space, but Sherlock just waved his hand motioning her to quickly leave.  She pointed at him and sternly mouthed again,
Everyone else was already seated and chatting while John was pouring white wine into the glasses. Sherlock could hear more of Mrs. Hudson’s inane questions. “So, John,” she said, basking in the fact that she could call him John, “what was it like working with Hugh Grant? He’s just divine!”
John gently called out, “Maybe something light? It’s depressing enough out there as it is.”
Sherlock reads it.  Right above the pre-printed “Bee Mine” in bright yellow bubble letters, John’s writing reads, “Sherlock, Will you?” with “Always yours, John” underneath. He looks up at John.
He needed to get out of this conversation. Now. But John just laughed, “I’m going to hold you to that!”
“When was I going to find out?” John crossed his arms, slightly exasperated. “I live here, too.”
“I’m going to walk them to the car,” Tom said and jogged out after them all. Sherlock was left standing alone in the middle of the sitting room, glancing around with his mouth open as if he was about to ask someone a question but was paused mid-sentence.
He could never say no to Tom, however.  When his sister died, Sherlock agreed to take in his young nephew solely to keep him out of Mycroft’s stodgy influence. Sherlock had quite enough of that growing up and wouldn’t subject his nephew to the same. Eventually, when it became clear that Tom's birth father wanted nothing to do with the boy, he adopted Tom right before his eighth birthday.  That was fourteen years ago and Sherlock had not regretted it for a single moment.  Tom brought something into his life he didn’t know he was missing and saved Sherlock in more ways than Tom would ever know.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.” A cup of tea and a healthy helping of scones were loudly deposited on the table in front of John. “You shouldn’t have,” he said anxiously.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, “You’ve done so well for yourself. Good for you,” and she patted his hand as he took his chair beside her.  He looked at her fondly and then smiled at Rosie.
“Really?!” John looked from his daughter to Sherlock, clearly impressed. “I remember reading about that. That was you? I don’t remember your name in the papers.”
Sherlock couldn’t read the situation. Was John implying he’d be open to spending more time together? Was he waiting for Sherlock to get out of the cab so John could go about his day? Did John realize Sherlock had an interest in him far beyond friendship? There were too many variables and Sherlock had to get out of the cab. Immediately.
Tom giggled, “I’m sure we will.” He followed Sherlock down the hallway to the table.
Of course, they weren’t going to stay that way.
Thankfully, John continued the conversation. “What the hell just happened over there? Sounds like a bomb went off,” he joked.
Arriving back home after his errand, he was greeted with the smells of breakfast and heard Mrs. Hudson and Tom in the kitchen, apparently also rehashing last night’s events.
-----
When John pulled his earpods out and greeted Sherlock with a bright, “Morning!” Sherlock felt his breath leave his body.
“It’s John. Uh … John Watson? We met on Christmas Eve.”
“Of course,” Sherlock quietly replies and leaves the bathroom, confirmed in his new girlfriend suspicion from earlier.  Of course John would have a gift ready for his date, although surprising he would choose such a loaded holiday to start off on.  “Rosie’s bear is on the table.” And he walks down the hall to his room and closes the door.
“Sherlock! Don’t be rude,” John said good naturedly.
Sherlock looked at Tom, “Eight months? How have you hidden this from me for eight months?”
, Sherlock thought,
(See the end of the chapter for
John didn’t seem to take offense. “Oh, I got it from Tom. I had lunch with him and Rosie the other day.”
“I only found out about this tonight, as well, so don’t feel so bad,” John interjected.  Sherlock looked at John for the first time since dinner began and started getting flustered again. Well, that was easily solved. He just wouldn’t look at John for the duration of the meal. He could talk to someone and not look at them.
“I know I am. I’ve probably said it a million times, but you are amazing.”
Rosie then walked her dad over to Sherlock, who hadn’t moved a muscle during Mrs. Hudson’s entire speech. Was he in his mind palace? John Watson never appeared in his mind palace before, no reason he would now. Was he dreaming? Doubtful, he rarely remembered his dreams. He hadn’t partaken in his 7% solution since the day all those years ago when he told his parents Tom was coming home with him and they had given him one week to enroll in a rehab program to get clean. The only explanation left was that John Watson
“That’s not what I said!” Tom laughed and looked back and forth between them. “Well, that’s not what I meant.”
“I could kiss you.” John says. It’s an echo of his words on Friday and Sherlock’s breath catches as his eyes get glassy and he tucks further into John’s neck, smelling all that is
John rubbed his hand over his face and sighed. “I know…” He paused to think. “OK, if we’re going to do this it has to be simple. We yell surprise, have cake, and everyone’s out the door. I think we can get it done in thirty minutes, tops.” Yes, he thought, good plan.
Chapter 1
Rosie wiggled out of Sherlock’s arms and dragged him around the room, showing him all they had planned for the evening. He took in the sign, games, food, and Molly brought out the cake.
-----
“A small film set in Brooklyn, New York. I’m only in London for a week then I go back.”
John wasn’t about to be deterred. “Are you going to sit there all day? At least change out of those clothes. I know you were in them when I left for the clinic yesterday.” John didn’t add that seeing Sherlock in his low slung pajama bottoms and one of John’s old t-shirts was making him think things he shouldn’t. As gorgeous as Sherlock looked in bespoke, he looked just as amazing when he was in comfortable clothes with his hair mussed.
John’s phone buzzed and he quickly glanced down. “Rosie? Car’s here,” he called over to her. “Thank you again,” and he held his hand out to Sherlock, who quickly took it and gave it a hasty shake.
Neither able to make a decision, they both end up falling asleep, lying on their backs, two feet away from each other.
There are no nightmares at all.
Sherlock looks at the card again and softly smiles. “I will, John.” Sherlock swallows and looks up into John’s incredible blue eyes. “I am,” and Sherlock prays he’s not getting this wrong.
John tilts his head and squints his eyes. “Do I smell acetone?”
“Yes. And apparently he kept all the cake for himself.”
Sherlock squinted into the lens and spoke in the same slow, distracted manner, “Normally I’d say yes, but caffeine seems contrary to our goal for this afternoon.”
“Rosie planned just a few games,” Molly said, fumbling through some papers then she began to read, chuckling, “Pin the knife on the corpse, musical coffins, bobbing for poisonous apples…”
Finally alone with John, Sherlock again found himself disconcerted. This was getting ridiculous. He was a grown man! He was certainly able to carry on a conversation with more than three words per sentence. Focusing on the task at hand, he decided the best course of action was to begin his experiment and let John observe. John seemed keen to do the same, and as the next hour passed Sherlock was able to show John a little about his work and answer the (surprisingly) intelligent questions John posed to him at different stages.
Sherlock shot him daggers with his eyes.
Mycroft confidently leaned back in his chair, quite enjoying the display in front of him. “I really can’t see how my input would be beneficial in this matter,” he replied. “Young Rosamund seems to be quite the delegator. Anthea’s got one eye on her. Never too early, you know…” he trailed off, knowingly baiting John.
John walks back and stands in front of Sherlock’s chair. “You are?” John asks hopefully as he looks down and cups Sherlock’s face with his hand. Sherlock grabs it and holds it in place as he leans into it, closing his eyes, and nods.
“Yes, um, quite often. He can be away for months at a time.” She looked at Tom who had come to sit beside her, “Um, Tom, maybe we should tell …” but Tom gave her a wide eyed stare and quickly shook his head.
If John weren’t so flabbergasted he’d actually be quite impressed at how well Rosie knew her godfather.
“Really?” John asked as he opened the refrigerator which was completely stocked.
) and said with a big smile on his face, “Dinner?” Now, they’re chatting about their latest case and laughing as Sherlock nicks prawns off John’s plate. It feels good to be well rested and they decide to walk home.
“Really? I’d love to see the inside of a morgue that’s not a set! I almost studied medicine, like Rosie, but then this sort of came around and I had to choose. I still find all that very interesting.”
“Nope.”
“Yes. 9am.”
Suddenly, Sherlock scooped Rosie up and hugged her close. “Watson! What have you done for me? Is this my birthday surprise? I love it.” He looked into John’s eyes with a soft smile as he spun Rosie around, and John adored him. John mouthed the words,
“What is her family like?” Mr. Holmes asked. “How are they celebrating today?”
----------
“Mmmm, I suppose. Can’t sleep either?”
“What happened to you?” John asked.
“Finally,” replies Sherlock, “she wouldn’t stop chattering away wondering who would give her cards at school tomorrow.”
before finally walking out the door.
The morning went by quickly and Molly arrived to help. She helped Rosie put sticky tabs on the plastic knives and hang the paper body on the back of the door. They also froze a plastic glove filled with blue water for the punch bowl that night.
Rosie was already back to her project, scattering iridescent glitter over a big S. “Mycroft.” She looked pleased with the results, and moved onto the H.
There are new nightmares, too. But not John’s. Sherlock’s own cries and whimpers can be heard through the floor most nights and John feels powerless to comfort his best friend. Sherlock has only ever given John the basic facts about his time … away, and John doesn’t feel he has the right to pry. Sherlock has never made John talk about his shoulder injury and he pays Sherlock the same respect. He can give him that.
“No, Dr. Watson, I don’t think I could be any clearer. Hmmm, you are getting Sherlock’s favorite cake, correct?”
John finds his friend sitting up in bed with his elbows resting on his bent knees and a dazed look on his face as if he’s not sure where he is. “John? JOHN!” seems to be the only word coming out of his mouth as he looks around the room, tears streaming down his face. “I’m right here, Sherlock, it’s OK.” He waits by the door to not startle Sherlock anymore than he already is. “Breathe slowly.  Can I come near you?” Sherlock doesn’t answer but closes his eyes and tries to control his sobs. Not wanting to embarrass his friend John offers, “Would you rather I leave?” Pushing the heels of his palms into his eyes, Sherlock quickly shakes his head from side to side.
John feels like shit. This is entirely not the way he intended for this night to go, or how he wanted to give Sherlock his present. John was looking forward to tomorrow night, sitting in their chairs in front of the fire, and he was hoping that a small amount of liquid courage would be all he needed to finally confess his feelings to the man he’s loved for so long.
As John walked into the kitchen, he was pleased to see Sherlock at the kitchen table staring into his microscope, as opposed to hanging upside down in his chair.  Sherlock spoke without looking up. “Mycroft sent what we needed. He made sure to take care of Mrs. Hudson, as well. You have the day to relax.”
“What was your most recent, then? Besides the suicide-murders?” John continued. Did John really want to know? His interest seemed genuine, so Sherlock slowly opened up and talked a bit about his work. He described a few cases that were easily explained with the least amount of gore.  John asked relevant questions and slowly Sherlock calmed down enough to hold a decent conversation. Still, he only glanced at John as minimally as possible so as not to appear rude. He knew he was being awkward. He didn’t know how not to be.
“I know,” John says proudly. “I was glad it was still there when I went back to get it. I hope you like it. Happy Valentine’s Day, Sherlock.” He knows Sherlock hasn’t noticed the little card still tucked inside the bag, but the exchange went so perfectly John decides against mentioning it. Another time, he thinks with sigh, and starts to stand up.
John and Sherlock look at each other across the room. “Good night,” they say almost in unison with a nod as they retreat to their respective bedrooms, John bounding up the stairs and Sherlock slowly walking down the hallway.
Baker Street broke out into applause. You couldn’t hear above the din - the clapping, the whistling, the cheers of “Bravo!” coming from every window. It was the sound of hope, it was the sound of life in the world, and knowing they would all be able to fully embrace it again soon.
“He sat through the entire talk. So I asked him to coffee and that was that. He made me laugh.” She looked at Tom and smiled as he put his hand on top of hers.  “Eight months,” Tom said astonished. “And I haven’t screwed it up yet.”
“Wow. Did they respond?” John asked.
A taxi pulled up almost immediately after Sherlock raised his hand. “No, I tend to work in the morgue two or three days a week. More, even, if I have a case on and need their equipment. I’ve a friend there who helps me get around certain… protocols.”
Sherlock couldn’t help smiling. They locked eyes and they held contact a beat longer than necessary. It took Sherlock’s breath away. There were a few moments of awkward silence as they both continued with their meals.
Sherlock paused and eyed them both. “Hmmmm. I’m not sure when I’ll be back.”
Sherlock’s sister died when Tom was 5, and after it was evident that Tom’s father did not want to be a part of the boy’s life, there was much discussion of where Tom would be raised. His grandparents would certainly raise him, but it wasn’t until Mycroft insisted Tom be brought up properly that Sherlock knew he had one chance to save both their lives.  He informed his family of his intentions to raise Tom himself, which shocked his parents and was immediately and loudly dismissed by Mycroft based on his age and unsavory habits. This argument was met with an icy stare from Sherlock and the vow he would get sober and stay that way.  With an ultimatum given to him by his parents, he stormed out of the house, went home to pack a bag, and checked himself into a rehab. Looking back now, he knew if he had not had that motivation he would have been dead within the year.
Sherlock played for John. It was easy for him to be taken over by the music when it was for John. His eyes were closed. He began to sway closer and closer to the window behind his chair until he was completely facing it, almost leaning out of it, the sound of his violin filling Baker Street. With each stanza, he played louder, trying to capture the moment and give it to John.
“Why would I possibly know his favorite cake!?” John grabbed his coat that he had thrown on the chair earlier and shoved his arms into it as he left the room.
About an hour later, he heard multiple footsteps coming up the stairs and steeled himself to meet new people.  “Dad, it smells so good in here! Rosie, come in, come in!” he beckoned with his hand outside the doorway to the sitting room and a young woman walked in, with shoulder length blonde hair and bright, curious eyes. She looked amused and glanced here and there around the room. Sherlock walked over to her and extended his hand, “Pleasure to meet you.”
“Sherlock? Was that glass? Sherlock? Are you OK!?” John was yelling into the phone on his end. Sherlock stumbled up, his dressing gown catching on a chair as he did so. He gave the chair a dirty look and pulled the garment off, hearing a tear, and knocking the chair over. He groaned, looking around the kitchen at the mess he made.
“Ode to Joy,” John happily sighed. “You know I love that one.” Tea forgotten, he walked toward the window by the couch, the wind gently blowing the curtains inside.
John was already leaving the room when Molly yelled, “John, she put you in charge of the cake!!”
. He softly smiled and turned to face Sherlock.
Pushing his food around his plate, Sherlock thought about how much he wanted to reveal to John. He also wasn’t sure what Tom had already told Rosie, who then might have relayed it to her father. Either way, he wasn’t about to discuss his previous addiction with John Watson. “Not overnight. Before I adopted Tom, I, um,” he paused to chuckle, “rather annoyed the Yard with my deductions. I would scour the papers for unsolved cases, and mail them with a write up of what they missed and the solution, with my contact information.”
John stuttered, “Um…” Of course he knew it was his flatmate’s birthday in a week. He also knew Sherlock absolutely would not want to celebrate it. “Who told you when his birthday was?” John knew it wasn’t him.
“Once I realized Rosie was planning it, I stopped deducing it, John, I swear. My reactions to everything in there were authentic,” Sherlock chuckled, the wine having done its job. He relaxed and looked out into the night.
“Great. See you then. Bye, Sherlock,” and the line disconnected.
“Nope. Just this. I’ve got all the time in the world,” John replied as Sherlock stepped towards the street to hail down a taxi. John swung his backpack around and tucked his earpods and phone inside. “Actually, I hope I’m not putting you out. I didn’t even ask if you had anything planned today when I invited myself.”
Five minutes later Tom knocked on the door. “Dad?” He loudly whispers. “Are you coming out?”  Sherlock maniacally laughed at the unintended pun. He stood up and straightened his clothes, opened the door, and glared at Tom, “We will discuss this later.”
“Family project. We have to list on each point of the snowflake winter traditions we do as a family,” she looked right into Sherlock’s eyes as she spoke, letting him know how important the task was.
“Hello, there you are,” John smiles. “Do you want to open it?” Sherlock nods.
“I think we need to take Molly up on her offer to keep Rosie for a weekend,” John says, half yawning as he spoons pureed pears into his daughter’s mouth. “I feel like I could conk out right now. I swear all I need is one weekend to catch up.” He doesn’t mention that the nightmares don’t come during the day. Naps have always been better and have allowed him to compensate for the restless nights in the past.  Of course, that was before he had a child to father during the daylight hours.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s all John can do not to shove the gift bag into Sherlock’s face. “This is for you,” he says instead and gently holds the bag out by the handles.
Opening his eyes, Sherlock knows immediately that John is lying behind him. He’s always aware of John’s proximity to himself and not even sleep could change that.
Walking back down the stairs, John shakes out his hands and takes a few deep breaths. He pauses nervously at Sherlock’s door, the butterflies out of control.
The amazing Obviously Sherlocked did a fantastic job with the beta of this chapter and made it even better! Thank you, my darling!!
“Look at me, Sherlock.” And Sherlock does. All of John’s apprehension dissipates as he looks into those beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with admiration, trust, and love. John leans down and gently grazes his lips against Sherlock’s before touching their foreheads together.
John laughed, “No. I could see myself in an ER, or a combat zone even - maybe I would have joined the army. Somewhere busy.” John picked up a pair of forceps and stared at them. “Somewhere I could help people,” he said quietly.
“She seems more wound up than usual,” Sherlock’s baritone under the sound of the violin sent a shiver down John’s spine. He looked at Sherlock, noting that a year’s worth of age only enhanced his beautiful features.
Sherlock paused. Looking at John, he took in his tired face and slightly slumped posture. He set his shoulders, closed his eyes, and began again.
“Sherlock offered to show me around.” John said, looking at Sherlock and smiling as if that explained everything.
With the sounds of clapping and cheering still happening outside on Baker Street, with the world in a state of uncertainty, they found the love they needed in each other.
John broke the awkward silence, “Um, so thank you again for having us this evening. Rosie and Tom really insisted or I wouldn’t have barged in. I have to make my way back home soon, early day tomorrow with Christmas,” he explained.
Neither Watson made eye contact. “Ok,” John said, as casually as he could. He knew Sherlock wouldn’t think it odd that there was no mention of his birthday. “Have a good day.”
“... and he sat down pretending to be there for the signing, too. He said it was a topic he was always interested in and I was eager to discuss with him individual care plans of geriatric patients…”
Sherlock hears John’s breath changing and knows he’s awake, but not yet aware that Sherlock is as well. “I’m up,” Sherlock whispers. “It’s still early, go back to sleep.”
“Does your father travel for work often?” Sherlock asked politely. A little conversation now would allow him to be more silent later.
“Mrs. Hudson!” he loudly called out the kitchen door, “We’ll need another place setting!”
John put the forceps down and shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. He turned to Sherlock and smiled, “Starving.”
She gathered her coat and bag and began to leave as John walked toward the back of the lab. She silently mouthed
“That’s a lot of glue, Rosie,” John said as he looked at her slather another dollop onto the construction paper in front of her. He tilted his head to get a better look. “What are you making?”
“So tell me, how did this ‘consulting detective’ come to be?” John asked Sherlock between bites of dumplings. Sherlock was right, this place was amazing. John vowed to stare at the bottom third of door handles more often.
“Yes, Molly. Now that we all know each other you’re free to leave.”
“Molly,” Sherlock acknowledged with a nod as they entered the morgue. Damn. He was hoping she wouldn't be working today. She had her back toward them and she was bent down looking into a lower cabinet.
When John comes home from the clinic a few hours later, Sherlock and Rosie are just done setting the table and John scoops up his daughter in a hug and gives her a big kiss on her cheek.  “What were you two up to this afternoon?” he asks, looking between the two of them as he settles a laughing Rosie in her dinner chair.  Sherlock smiles at John as he watches the scene, so grateful to be a part of it even as just a bystander watching. John meets Sherlock’s eyes and holds them a second longer than usual with a smile of his own. Sherlock is thrown for a moment and blinks fast as he starts to serve dinner.
Sherlock eventually directed the conversation back to Rosie and Tom and was able to stay silent through dessert.  They all ventured back into the sitting room and Mrs. Hudson began to bombard John with more questions which he answered kindly and patiently. He talked with her and they laughed, and as Sherlock stood in the doorway to the kitchen, he thought to himself that he had never seen anything more beautiful than John Watson laughing in his sitting room.
John was mesmerized. He didn’t want it to end.
He loses his breath.
And they lived happily ever after. :) I hope you enjoyed reading my little celebration of Sherlock's birthday as much as I enjoyed writing it - xoxo
“Let’s sit and watch telly for a bit - find something really boring.” John walks towards the couch, grabs the remote, and plops down in a corner as he flips through the channels. “C’mon, we just need to relax.” Sherlock sits at the kitchen table and stares at John for a moment before nodding, getting up, and shuffling over. He lays his head on the opposite end, wraps his dressing gown around his pulled up knees, and yawns.
“Yes, we do, calm down. We don’t want to give it all away now,” he whispered. “Here he comes.” They shuffled in their seats, trying to look bored.
“Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow…” Rosie whispered in John’s ear as he carried her upstairs to their room to put her down for the night.
“Um ... at least I’m going to open the windows,” John said quickly. “Air this flat out.”
“Yes, very good, goodbye.” He said quickly, and again motioned for John to follow him.
- to forget how to speak. He hadn’t been that flustered since… well, he couldn’t even remember when, that’s how long ago it was. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back on the seat. John Watson. Sherlock was happy he got through the evening with his dignity intact.
“Well, I’m not sure what to do with myself now,” John said as he sat down. He drummed his fingers on his thighs looking around the kitchen. “It’s a nice day. Short walk?”
“Games???” John asked. “No. No. No games.” His eyes were getting bigger and bigger.
After a moment, Sherlock realized something and said, “Forgive me for being rude. I don’t mean to monopolize the conversation. However, I know you’re a private person and I don’t want to intrude with questions that would make you uncomfortable.” Sherlock was amazed he had held John’s attention for this long without boring him or putting him off.
Six hours. Six hours of uninterrupted sleep. There were no nightmares - no dreams at all actually, and John feels better than he has in a long time. So good in fact, he figures he might close his eyes and try for another hour - which is when he realizes he is no longer sitting, but curled up halfway down the couch with his head resting on Sherlock’s hip.
“Sherlock?” He jumped at Mrs. Hudson’s call. “Come play for us, it’s Christmas!” She pulled him into the room.
“Not my problem, mate.  Rosie gave me a list - a very specific list, mind you - and here it all is.” He started pointing to the items, “Plastic skeletons, fake blood, rubber fingers, still haven’t found candy eyeballs but I’ve got Donovan searching online … I had to drive all over London to get some of this - it’s January not October!”
“How did you know?” John asks taken aback, gripping Sherlock’s hand.
As he walked downstairs from his room, he resigned himself to a morning at the shops and long lines. Sherlock wouldn’t have thought to go shopping to be sure they had what they needed to see them through more than a few days. Since the news of the virus began, Sherlock spouted the word, “Bored!” regularly and spent most of his time in his mind palace.  Apparently, the possibility of contracting the virus caused even the most hardened criminals of London to stay inside.
After minutes, maybe hours, days - John pulls away and looks into Sherlock’s eyes. “I love you. I absolutely, completely adore you and I don’t want to keep myself from telling you that ever again.”
Lestrade walked in an hour before the party was to begin. “Looks great but it’s missing something…” and grinned as he tossed a roll of crime scene tape at Rosie. She squealed and she and Molly ran around the flat draping it over the furniture and winding it around the bookcases.
Rosie chose that moment to walk into the room. “Oh, hello, Watson,” he said brightly. He’d never dismiss John’s daughter, even in his darkest moods. She climbed into Sherlock’s lap, dried mud flaking onto her leggings, and he held her gently. “What do you have there?”
“I’ll get ice,” Sherlock starts for the kitchen but John stops him. “No no, I’m fine. It’s not bad,” and he stands up, holding onto the wall not realizing the gift bag is still in his other hand.
John chuckled, which made Sherlock look up, blinking, not understanding the humor of his statement.
“Yes. I’m almost done.” Sherlock pretends to read an important email.
“I’ll go,” Sherlock jumps up, much preferring the errand to the dishes.  John leans back, looking out the kitchen exit to the stairs, until he’s sure Sherlock’s gone. Then he shuts the water off and goes to the bathroom to retrieve the gift bag he has hidden behind his med kit in the cabinet under the sink.
He throws on his robe and quietly walks downstairs so as to not to disturb Sherlock (aiming to edit a few blog entries he feels are not quite ready to post) but is surprised to find him at the kitchen table peering into his microscope with bunches of dead crickets on paper plates all around him. His hair is a mess, like he had been dragging his fingers through the curls. John has always loved how soft and adorable Sherlock looks with his hair sticking out in all directions.
“Happy birthday, Sherlock.” The five-year-old was looking up at him, making the same serious face he’d seen Sherlock give him a thousand times.
John’s not startled by this at all.  It feels like the last piece of his life has finally slotted into place.  Of course he loves Sherlock - he always has. From that first night, the moment they looked at each other in the hallway, giggling by the stairs of 221B, John was in love.
One last curious glance at the two of them and Sherlock was out the door. Once she heard the front door close, Rosie raced to the window and saw Sherlock hop in a cab and ride away. “Let’s go, Daddy! There’s so much to do!” She ran around the room and John grabbed her by the waist and swung her wide.
There was no mistaking the atmosphere that surrounded Baker Street at this point. It filled their little section with the sounds of life. People were beginning to lean out their windows, humming along - no words, just the tune of the soaring notes in light sounds and deep hums.  As more joined in, it resonated and added to the makeshift orchestra. Children were dancing, people had their mobiles stretched out their windows, filming the scene.
Sherlock faltered only slightly as he stepped into the car. He couldn’t remember feeling this off center before. After a few failed dating attempts in college, he hadn’t bothered. He had Tom, he had his work. He was perfectly content. But no one had ever before made him feel the way he felt when John Watson held a car door open for him and smiled. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before John settled in next to him, and then - finally - they were on their way.
John stopped mid stride and took a breath at that last statement, did a double take and decided that was a discussion for a different day. He shook his head to clear it. “So you’re saying you won’t help at all.”
Sherlock looked up with glazed eyes, confused, and then looked out the window, the moment finally sinking in. It wasn't the sort of attention he was comfortable receiving and he didn’t know how to respond to John. He didn’t know how it evolved into the sound of the many instruments that suddenly echoed in his head, but he knew why he started.
John yelps and jumps up, startled at Sherlock’s quick intrusion, and solidly bumps his head on the edge of the sink.  “Well, I am now!” he yells at Sherlock and he sinks back down onto his bottom, eyes shut, one hand clutching the top of his head.
“I haven’t tried to hide it. You just never noticed.” Tom looked a bit pleased with himself and Sherlock sat up straighter and stared at Tom, taking affont at the last statement.
Sherlock squints his eyes at Sunday morning’s bright light and looks up at John’s face. The two of them are centimeters apart. Sherlock needs to stretch his legs and shifts a bit which wakes John up. “Don’t go,” Sherlock hears John’s whisper. “Unless you want to, I mean,” John continues. “But if you want to stay, I want you to stay.”
“Dad, come in!” Rosie said as she pulled John into the room. John licked his lips and glanced at the faces around him. He had a small smile on his face but looked a little overwhelmed to be there.  He whispered to Rosie, “Are you sure this is ok…?” She just laughed and brought him in further.
“Okay,” John closed his laptop and stood in front of Sherlock. “I’m going to make tea. Why don’t you play something for us?” He began to walk into the kitchen, “I’ve been at work so much I haven’t heard you play in forever. Miss it.”
“I wanted to thank you for Christmas Eve. I know it was last minute having me and I just wanted to let you know I had a great time,” John said.
John stood in the doorway of the kitchen, quickly glancing back and forth between Sherlock and Rosie, ready to act if needed. The little girl stood right in front of Sherlock, looking up at him as if he was her whole world.
Sherlock was playing his violin when John walked back downstairs. John smiled as he recognized Rosie’s current favorite song, The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies. John knew Sherlock wouldn’t tire of playing it until Rosie requested a new tune.
As they pulled up to Baker Street, John told Sherlock he had afternoon plans with Rosie the next day. “Nothing after that, though.” He looked at Sherlock expectantly.
“I did it for you.”
John took a moment and then realized the only solution was 221C. He grabbed a box, and down the stars he began.
“YES!” John begrudgingly yelled over his shoulder, and was gone, leaving the smug, laughing man behind.
They lay there breathing for a bit, neither quite settled enough to drop back off.  John opens his mouth several times and takes a breath, but stops himself before he can speak. Finally in a quiet voice he stutters, “Would it be …? Can I …?” Sherlock reaches back, grabs John’s hand and pulls it over his own body.
Sherlock and I still weren't how we used to be but our relationship had improved. I was going to crime scenes with Sherlock, much to the polices disproval, and helping him with cases but we never forgot who we were. I was his slave and he was my master so we could never be friends.
I expected him to say as much, he rarely ever ate anyway, so I headed into the kitchen to make myself something knowing that if I didn't and my stomach rumbled Sherlock would get grumpy at the 'distracting noises'. I decided against anything complicated or anything would require more then 5 minutes to make. Grabbing a bowl I made myself some cereal, quickly ate it, and washed up so I didn't have to do it later.
"Then show me," I said seriously.
I stayed sitting for maybe another half an hour until Sherlock walked in followed by a doctor, who looked in his late twenties with short blond hair and an angular shaped face so he almost resembled an elf out of lord of the rings, who immediately walked over to me and pulled me into a position to examine my back. "Too close Sherlock, too close. If you had given your slave a few more lashes or left him hanging from that door much longer he wouldn't be much use to you. Due to his shoulder wound if you had left him hanging any longer it would have damaged it enough for him to be useless for months while it recovered. Also if you had given him a few more lashes, as it seems with each lash you have given him, they increase in strength causing more of a wound making the healing process longer. Next time be more careful or at the very least work him up to longer punishments so it doesn't hurt his shoulder as much. Okay, now please leave while I stitch and bandage your slave up." The man said to Sherlock with a smile, he didn't at all seem affected by what Sherlock had done to me. He must be a doctor who specialises in treating slaves such as myself.
"The name is Sherlock, and unless we are in public with your collar on show, that is how you should call me." I was taken slightly aback by this. I couldn't help but get the feeling that something had changed. Sherlock walked into the kitchen, grabbed both of our plates before sitting down at the table putting my plate on the table by the seat next to him. "Sit and eat. I can't stand the noises your stomach makes when you are hungry." I hesitated, but only for a second before sitting down. I waited for Sherlock to start eating before digging in myself, something had definitely changed. I decided to ignore it for now but if anything else changed I would ask. I watched Sherlock eat out of the corner of my eye. Usually he didn't finish his food, or eat at all for that matter, but when I next looked over at his plate it was empty. Putting it down to needing energy from last nights activities, I dismissed the abnormality of the act and continued eating. After I finished I washed up and Sherlock assumed his thinking position on the couch. I kept an eye on him while I tidied. I wanted to confront him about last night, about everything, the good and... the bad, but it wasn't my place. I didn't know how things were going to change. So I was keeping to what I knew; being the invisible slave, the furniture. But I wasn't anymore. Sherlock said he loved me. He showed my last night. So what was I now? All these thoughts swam through my head as I appeared to look busy, finding dirt in everything and insisting that it needed to be cleaned. I was procrastinating. I needed to talk to Sherlock, but first I needed to know what happened last night to cause... I looked over at Sherlock and saw him staring at me. Feeling daring, I walked over to the chair by the laptop, picked it up, brought it over to the sofa and sat down in it so I was more on level with Sherlock. I was daring him to say something, willing him to show me if anything had changed. He didn't say a word. He just kept looking at me.
"Sherlock, I'm here," I said prompting him. I didn't really expect him to reply, he was asleep after all.
I heard Sherlock walk over to me and release my wrists. I didn't have the strength to stop from collapsing on the floor. I stayed where I was, my body limp and sprawled in a wet liquid on the floor. I managed to turn my head to see what I was lying in and saw red; I was lying in a shallow puddle of my own blood.
"You two, a word." Lestrade said pointing to the two of us then to the building. I looked to Sherlock who just nodded then went inside. I followed, the pain too fresh in my mind to even think about rebelling again, and kept my head down to avoid all the judging stares of the police men. Once we entered the building Lestrade ordered everyone out and once again the room emptied only leaving the three of us.
I gave it back to him then feeling brave I decided to ask, "Why did you call me your assistant?"
When we arrived back at the apartment the first thing Sherlock did was go and lie down on the sofa hands together under his chin in his thinking position; at least that is what I assumed it was considering that he does it all the time. He didn't give me any orders so I started cleaning, not that there was much to clean, knowing the other option was to kneel on the floor next to Sherlock.
This might actually work, I could be free, I closed my eyes and tried to imagine what it would be like. Being able to walk out the house without all the judging stares of passers by as they noticed my collar, being able to do what I want without being punished. Even though I had only been a slave for a little while it seemed like a life time.
After I spoke Sherlock turned to face me with that look but as always he quickly hides it. He knew it was wrong just as much as I did, although social convention never stopped him in the past so what was holding him back? Society only prevents a relationship. There was nothing holding him back from having his way with me. This was all very confusing.
"John, my phone." Sherlock demanded.
"Hey mate, how are you? Come on in." He said cheerfully and waved me inside. After one look around and I knew I made the right choice; the whole place was littered with pieces of technology and electronics.
"Thank you John," He said then walked away.
"Breakfast and tea is ready, Master!" I yelled loud enough for him to hear. Sherlock came out a few moments later with a grimace on his face.
The whole time I couldn't get the murder off my mind, I got so distracted by it that I lost track of time, the only thing that snapped me out of my thoughts was Sherlock's voice from the sofa.
"JOHN!" I heard Sherlock yell.
"Sherlock?" I asked tentatively. I still didn't know what happened but I needed to know he was okay.
We headed into the house and we were met by another dead body very similar to the last. Mid thirties in age with dark brown hair, a knife stabbed into the chest with a note attached that said 'MMRWIKRERTSIHSYITNOHNMIGLUOEC', and his arms displayed in a strange fashion almost as if he where miming the time 3 o'clock. There were a few differences such as more stab wounds as if the killer had killed in a rage and the man had cuts and bruises on his face and knuckles.
I looked up at James expecting him to throw me out or something but he surprised me. He looked at me in sympathy and said, "Don't worry I will try and help you even if it means I get arrested for this,"
I had to think, I couldn't tell her I was his slave, "Um, well, I graduated from Bart's and when I got back from Afghanistan I went there to see an old friend, Mike Stamford. That's where I met Sherlock," I said mentally crossing my fingers and hoping it was believable.
"Sure," Molly said quietly. It was only then she seemed to notice me, "Hello, I'm Molly, are you a friend of Sherlock's or something?" She asked.
"Yes, Master," I replied dutifully and headed into his room and a few minutes later Sherlock joined me carrying a bag. "What's that?" I asked curiously and as I expected I was ignored.
"HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN!" I yelled slamming my fists on the desk and standing up, "YOU SAID YOU WOULD PROTECT HER!"
He didn't reply he just stared at me until I realised what I did then looked down uncomfortable and said, "Sorry Sir,"
"Anyway I'm sure he will teach you how to act. Anyway your duties will probably include cleaning, cooking, maybe sex, then anything else he asks you to do. A little advise, just stay out of his way, he likes his privacy and as soon someone invades it he gets cranky, the same happens if someone doesn't do as he says so bear that in mind." Mycroft finished his little speech then turned away from me. Evidently Mycroft was finished talking.
"How do you think?" He replied pulling the covers over his head like a child.
"Well, well, if it isn't the freak. Who's this, are you paying someone to follow you around so you don't seem like such a supercilious jerk?" The woman said looking mildly amused by her own comment.
Okay this it the first time I have ever published smut on the internet. Feedback it always welcome and greatly appreciated. If there is anything I left out just ask because I have never had sex so this is all from reading other fanfiction. I don't know when the next chapter will be up because exams are coming up in a few weeks and I'm going to be busy. Oh sorry the chapter is so short. Enjoy!
He collapsed on the bed next to me breathing heavily. Eventually he undid my restraints and I to collapsed barely even conscious.
"Sherlock..." I started but was interrupted.
"Good John. I wanted to tell you that I... I love you and I have since I first saw you but I ignored  the feeling. Then when you ran away it hurt me, but I didn't know. Then I got angry and hurt you back but I still didn't understand why I was hurting you which is strange because I'm smarter than everyone. Then a little while ago I understood and wanted you but I didn't want to hurt you again. Also being in that sort of relationship would effect my mental capacity, I would have to delete some stuff, not to mention that it would distract me from solving... stuff. I wanted to forget for a little while, just your presence was too distracting." He said unconsciously and rolled over. I heard an intake of breath and though he was going to say something else but then I heard a snore and realised that was all I would get out of him.
"NO! No, no, no. I will not let you contaminate my crime scene!" A man, with strait dark brown/black hair slightly longer than Sherlock's and face red with rage, said walking up to us with a defiant tone.
"Sherlock... I love you." I whispered. This seemed to shock him and for a moment I didn't think he would respond.
"It was the knife that killed him but I ran a few tests anyway and they show he was unconscious when he was killed, there wasn't as much blood loss as there should have been so I looked to see what he had eaten or drank and found nothing so I checked around his face. I found traces of chloroform around his mouth and nose which would explain why this wound made by the knife is very clean, there wasn't any fight because our victim was unconscious. Oh and I worked out the time of death was at about 12 o'clock, give or take an hour."
"Then why are you still here," He said, "Unless you are about to tell me you really need my help with something and by the way the answer would be no," He stood up and walked past Mycroft to the door. "No? Then bye bye." He continued opening the door and turning to Mycroft.
I shook my head and continued until I reached the bins and put the rubbish where it belonged.
"Master, told me not to," I said simply putting effort into the word 'Master' to show I really wasn't happy and left it to Sherlock to explain.
"I have it, I know what we could do!" He exclaimed then ran out the door.
"John, catch," Sherlock said throwing something silver to me. It was a silver collar and on the back of it by the latch was a key hole and next to that a little silver hoop as if something was meant to clip on there. "Put it on," He said walking past me to sit in one of his chairs in the living room.
I woke up the next morning and walked into the living room. I was surprised to see it was empty, Sherlock never slept that long. I sighed and made two cups of coffee, tea had less caffeine so wouldn't work as well. I grabbed a mug and went to Sherlock's bedroom.
"Well, Sherlock, I'm sure you have a good reason but I no longer care, how did that work earlier? You simply said how much pain he should have then it happened." Lestrade questioned obviously curious then stopped Sherlock from replying, "In fact don't tell me I don't want to know, I think I have a meeting about that tomorrow anyway, is it one of those new bloody internal collars" He said dismissively, I just nodded. "Okay then, off you go, we will send out patrols to the houses in the area you mentioned and catch the killer tomorrow." And with that he left leaving me alone with Sherlock.
"I can't." He said quietly, all illusion of him being more powerful and above us was gone.
"John, get out the chair," Sherlock said again but I didn't move, the pain got worse.
I did as the doctor said even though the pain had reached a manageable level but kept my eyes open so I knew what was happening. About an hour and a half later I was all stitched and bandaged up. I no longer needed the tissue for my nose as it had stopped bleeding although I still kept some with me just in case it started again.
All I got was a little laugh then I felt his lips crush against mine. As always I fought for dominance but for the fist time I lost. I felt him explore my mouth with his tongue claiming me then he pulled away. I moaned in annoyance and felt him smile against my skin. This was a whole new side to Sherlock. Usually he is a condescending jerk but at the moment he is being... nice? Caring?
If looks could kill I would be lying on the floor next to the dead body with the look Sherlock gave me but for some reason he replied, "There are 29 letters, if you make a five by five grid but with four spaces to the side going down for the spare letters and then place these letters going across then read it going down the columns it makes a sentence." Then he looked to Lestrade, "Are you saying no one saw that?"
"Well, just a word of advise, stay away from Sherlock Holmes. Do you know why he comes here? He is a psychopath this is what he gets off on and one of these days finding the killer won't be enough. One of these days we will be standing over a body and it will be him that put it there." She said startling me then left.
Sherlock hadn't said anything more because he physically couldn't. His head was thrown back in a silent scream, his back was arched off the bed, and his eyes were tightly closed. He was in agony. It was then I noticed new blood on the bed; new, fresh, blood spreading slowly from where his hands were. His fists were closed so tightly that his nails were cutting into his skin. Suddenly, what ever weariness I had vanished only to be filled with concern and fear. Jumping off the bed I ran around to Sherlock's side so I could reach and examine him better.
"How do you think?" He replied pulling the covers over his head like a child.
"Oh don't look so proud of yourself John, it doesn't suit you, but well done. You are getting better but once again you see but do not observe." Sherlock said then turned to the body, "Not being killed here is obvious, even Anderson could see that," When Sherlock said that I saw Anderson at the back step forward to say something but was pulled beck by Lestrade, "and yes his arms probably symbolise the time he was killed. Now this is where you started getting things wrong, it doesn't look professional for a reason, the violence of the death shows this man was enemy's with his killer. They got in a fight and then he was stabbed but the thing that shows they were enemy's is how this man was killed. His killer got carried away, the first stab was straight to the heart the the man died immediately, these other wounds from the knife where caused purely because his killer was in a rage. The note in case you are wondering is addressed to me again and says 'Mr Holmes hurry now time is ticking,' and you work it out the same as the last one so please refrain from asking me how I know I worked it out." He said looking to the Inspector then added, "the killer plans to kill two more times, tomorrow at 6 o'clock then the next day at 9 o'clock, anyway I have things to do and places to be," Sherlock said concluding his little speech then left.
"You never give up, do you?" He said, then without warning he plunged the rest of the way inside me and I couldn't help it; I screamed. The pain was excruciating but through it all I was still aroused. However limp my member had become, I felt it completely harden again and I shivered with anticipation. This was so wrong but felt so good.
"And when were you going to tell me you were a slave master?" He said angrily to Sherlock.
I needed him bad, as soon as his hand came close again my hips reflexively arched upward craving his touch but he moved away and a second later his weight was no longer on the bed. I realised it was because he had finished undoing the buttons and the zip and was teasing me. I whimpered again. What was happening to me?
"You already know which one I'm going to pick, you're not leaving me much option" I said looking down, my voice getting quieter and quieter, "looks like I'm... I'm... going to become a... a slave" I said my voice breaking off. "you're not going to change your mind are you?" I asked my voice barley audible.
"I am right here," He stated as if this sort of thing happened every day and he was stating a fact on a case to impress everyone. This sent shivers down my spine and I felt my cock twitch expectantly, I could just sense Sherlock smile at his words effecting me so much. And they did, I was defiantly turned on and I let out a little moan of desperation. This was going way to slow!
"I'm John Watson," I replied not knowing what to say or how to address her. I just decided to act normal seeing as she hadn't noticed who I was yet.
"You have no idea what you have agreed to." He said with a really out of character growl.
"You are impatient, don't forget who the Master is here." He said chastising me.
"Are you sure there is no other..." My voice broke, I couldn't continue.
Suddenly I felt a hand on my cock and a gentle squeeze causing me to gasp and completely harden, I could feel the blood pumping through my delicate member as Sherlock pumped it.
"Is it bad, what do you think it was anyway?" I asked needing to know. I was edging closer on my seat, I was about to get answers.
"Brother mine!" Sherlock said pushing open the doors to an office and walking in. I followed behind him although not because I was his slave, but because he had long legs and walked quickly. The room was large and ornate with a big desk on the other side with Mycroft sitting behind it, at the sound of the doors opening he looked up from the laptop on his desk. I didn't get a chance to have a close look at the room because a moment later Sherlock started talking.
About an hour later dinner was ready and as Sherlock had said before I stood behind him while he ate it and after he was finished and everything was tidied up I got myself some.
"The other option is of course you become a slave instead of your sister, and once again this would be for life so we would fit you with one of the permanent collars and in return your sister would be looked after and get the help she needs." Mycroft continued and looking in his eyes I knew he already knew which one I would pick.
After breakfast I sat on the sofa deciding what to do. The only thing I knew was that I wasn't going to follow Sherlock's rules, I was going to be so annoying that he would have to set me free. It wasn't much of a plan but it was the best I had.
"Thank you, anyway as I was saying, your sister is dead but that leaves us with a little problem. What do we do with you? Well the answer is simple, you remain a slave. There was nothing in the contract that says anything about if your sister dies. Now because you signed up for this for life it means there is little I can do for you. You will remain Sherlock's slave" Mycroft looked me straight in the eyes and for the first time it wasn't just his cold heart I saw. I saw compassion, he really did care. He didn't care much but the feeling was there.
"Hmm, doesn't look to difficult," I said to myself then got to work.
Other then that and the clients who came in from time to time and Mrs Hudson no one visited and I was getting lonely. I felt as if I was all alone in the world; not that it mattered because I was a slave.
I felt the tip moisten from the pre-come but then Sherlock let go causing me to whimper again at the absence of his hand. The whimper quickly became gasp of pleasure as he took me in his mouth and started to suck moving up and down deep throating me. I struggled against my restraints, not to try to stop him but to try and get at least some control. I wanted to put my hands on his head and hold his hair to control the motion but with the cuffs in place I was helpless. Completely at his mercy. The metal dug into my skin and a moment later I felt something warm slid down my wrists. It took me a moment to relise it was blood. Once that realisation hit me I felt the pain of it, an almost burning sensation starting from my wrists driving up my arm. However the pain felt different, mixed with the endorphins it created a sense of euphoria again even stronger than before and it blew my mind away.
"How did yours get turned off?" Sherlock asked evading the question.
"Sher-Master... What are y-y-you doing?" I asked nervous.
"Of course I have an idea. Didn't I tell you last night?" He said moodily looking at me baffled, as if he were saying 'did you really just ask?' I raised an eyebrow and gave him a look of my own but he didn't elaborate. He threw the covers off the bed and rolled onto his feet. He was unsteady for a moment so I stood by his side ready to catch him should he fall. After a moment though he seemed to have regained his balance because he turned and left the room. I followed without saying a word and watched as he went into the bathroom shutting me out. I sighed realising there was nothing I could do from out here. I turned towards the kitchen and started preparing breakfast. I decided on scrambled eggs and toast, since it was easy, and made enough for the two of us. While I was waiting for the eggs to heat up in the pan I made us both tea. I thought about where things would go from here. It was more than just a physical attraction between Sherlock and myself but it wasn't like we could be in a proper relationship. I decided it was up to Sherlock to work out, and until he did I would continue to behave as a slave should. At least that way I wouldn't get into trouble. The moment breakfast was ready I called for Sherlock.
I ran out the door and followed Sherlock into a cab.
"D'you know the value of pie?" He asked still slurring his words. Before I could do anything he continued, "It's 3.141592653589793238462643..." I knew I couldn't stop him so I let him drone on in his drunken state until we got back to the apartment and into his room.
"Oh right, I should probably thank you. If not for your gift several years ago, it would still be active." For the first time, Mycroft turned to look at John with wide eyes, before turning to Sherlock.
"What are we doing here?" I asked.
I felt Sherlock's hand lift my chin up. I was so shocked I froze but he pried my lips open with his and I snapped to my senses. Before I knew it I was kissing him back. I couldn't recall when I decided to kiss him but I was. We both fought for dominance, a battle of the tongue's in a fight; but it wasn't just that. It was a dance perfectly choreographed and beautiful in its entirety. Okay since did I start thinking like that.
He needed no more prompting. He crushed his lips into mine and I gave into him kissing him back.
I was starting to get worried, what if this man gets carried away and kills me? What if he is mean? What if I have to do his laundry?
"My wallets on the side, the pin for my debit card is 4429. I think this would be a good point to add that you are wearing a tracker so don't try to run and be back here in an hour. If you are not your collar will make you finish what you are doing and come back. I'm evidently talking about the internal collar not the one that you could easily take off. Bye bye." Sherlock said helpfully.
I would also like to give credit to VelvetMace and her story Collared as it is from reading that story that I got most of my inspiration. You may find mine is rather similar in places but a lot of the similarities are coincidence as I had this idea before reading it. However, if you like my story I would definitely recommend reading Collared.
"Yes," I said but quickly added, "sir," it's been two seconds and I'm all ready forgetting the rules. I waited a second to see if he was going to add anything, when he didn't I walked into the kitchen and continued tidying up.
"We really aught to go home," I said to him. All I got was a curt little nod from him before he swung himself around and headed to the door. Well at least that was what it looked like he was trying to do but it didn't really turn out like that. He swung himself around and moved one foot forward but he lost his balance and landed on me.
"The only thing I don't understand is what suddenly brought this about. I remember everything I said last night so it can't of been something I said or did to bring this about unless..." He droned off in thought then walked even closer so we where barely a foot apart, we were so close I could feel his breath on my face. "You put me to bed. Did I say something in my sleep?"
The car started forward and I leaned back in my seat, this couldn't be good.
For the first time I looked Mycroft in the eye. He couldn't do that to Harry, he couldn't offer hope only to take it away again, I would do anything for Harry.
The first half of the day went smoothly enough, there were a few phone calls about the case and Sherlock had to leave the apartment a few times. I didn't get invited to come so I spent the time talking to Mrs Hudson who didn't seem to care that I was a slave, she even gave me some help with the tidying which suited me because it gave me some pleasant company.
I walked over and sat at the table slightly apprehensive, "What's this about?" I asked looking at Mycroft.
, "Yes, Master" although I was surprised when it came out as an embarrassing moan. I felt me cheeks go hot as Sherlock chuckled dominantly. He was the one in control and he knew it. I was helpless to him, I was at his mercy. I was so used to being dominant in this part of my life that now that I have no choice but to be submissive I was falling apart at the seams.
"What a ridiculous question, what do you think?" Sherlock said in his usual I'm smarter than you voice but it was quiet and strained. He didn't elaborate any further but I could guess.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock asked me blankly.
About half an hour later we pulled up in front of a dark, desolate factory that seemed it would fall apart any moment. The only thought in my head at this moment was, why here? The woman got out of the car and I followed assuming she would take my to Mycroft.
I knew I wouldn't be able to get away with it but I had hoped Sherlock wouldn't do it in public in front of the police. Before the pain hit I saw both Anderson and Sergeant Donovan look at me in shock and I caught Lestrade's eye before I screamed for the second time today. My legs gave out from under me and I collapsed to the floor. The pain felt worst this time as if every single time I had been given pain in the past had been added up then dumped on me all at once. Other than that the pain was indescribable. When eventually the pain stopped I was shaking on the ground, tears flowing freely, I looked around, Sherlock looked livid but everyone else just looked shocked. It was at that point I noticed my scarf had fallen off exposing my collar. For some reason I felt more exposed than ever and I rubbed my hand against my neck, where the metal touched it, unconsciously.
"Almost, I'm just making sure everything works properly," The doctor replied, "Turn around John," He said and I obeyed. "So I have implanted it here you see and it connect into the brain, it can almost understand what Johns thinking. This means that when he is given an order it can understand whether he is going to obey or not. If he decides he isn't going to go do it then it will cause him pain and obviously the amount of pain it gives him depends on the severity of what he has done. Now of course his master can stop the pain or can cause the pain with just a verbal command. For example if you want to give him a small amount of pain you could say 'John- pain setting 1'" The doctor said and as soon as the words left his mouth pain spread through my body. It wasn't unbearable but it made it hard to think about anything else other than the pain. I heard the a voice say "Pain off" then seconds later I came back to my senses.
Once inside Sherlock shut the door behind me and said, "Remove your shirt then stand facing the door and raise your arms above your head so your wrists are level with the manacles," Sherlock ordered in a definite voice; there was no getting out of this. I looked to the door to see what Sherlock meant and was surprised to see steel manacles hanging from the top of the door as if it was a removable peg rack for clothes where it hooked over the top of the door lodging it between the door and the frame.
"Are you a friend of Sherlock's? I heard someone was going to be moving in," She asked but then stopped and looked at my neck, just below my Adams apple, which was were the collar was resting. "Oh , I didn't realise. Mycroft left earlier so your not his, are you Sherlock's slave?" She asked. I was a little taken aback by her reaction, she was still talking to me and being polite.
"John," He whispered quietly. I wouldn't have heard it if I was still by the door.
"Alright," I said with a sigh and put his arm around my neck and put my hand on his waist to support him.
I snapped the gloves over my hands and walked into the room. It took a few moments before what I saw registered in my mind. A dead man was laid on the floor, from what I could see he seemed to be mid-thirty's with black hair. He had a knife stuck in his chest with a piece of paper attached to it. Both the man's arms where laid out above him almost as if the man where trying to mime that is was 12 o'clock but it looked so unnatural that he must have been put in that position after death; the question was why would the killer do that?
"Yes, I am." I said simply.
It was difficult, because he couldn't actually see the implant and because it was in my brain he couldn't do anything manually, but eventually after about an hour of attempting and failing he came up with an idea.
The next few days went smoothly. I made breakfast for Sherlock then started cleaning only stopping when he asked me for something or to make food. After about 3 days of this boring routine the house was spotless. Then things changed a little.
Per the doctors request Sherlock left leaving me alone with the doctor who turned to face me kindly. "I hear you're a doctor as well," He said, "Well then at least you will know what I doing without to much explanation. First we need to get you in the shower to get rid of the blood so I can see what I'm doing then I will dry you off, stitch up your back, then put a clean bandage on you." He said then took a closer look at my nose which I was still holding a tissue to and gestured for me to move it away so I complied. "Nice job on your nose, I assume it was broken?" The doctor asked so I nodded not trusting myself to speak.
"She was doing well but then she slipped out a window in the bathroom and was found the next day dead, we did everything we could but it wasn't our fault. There are only two people you can blame for this, Harry and yourself. Now if you would kindly show yourself out the car is waiting. Don't try to run on the way back to Baker Street, if you decide to then your collar will give you pain until you decide to go back home. Good bye," Mycroft said with a forced smile then turned away and left.
I turned and looked at the road and just as I did a black car pulled up. I gave an exasperated sigh bringing my hand up to my head, what did Mycroft want? I walked over to the car and got in but was surprised to see it wasn't Mycroft sitting next to me. It was a woman with long brown hair a thin face and long fingers holding a blackberry typing furiously. As I got in she didn't move, it was almost as if she was oblivious to the world.
After I realised this I managed to control myself and come back to my senses. I looked up and saw Mycroft towering over me hands behind his back. "Please come and sit back down we have a lot to talk about," He said before walking back to the table and taking a seat.
"What's going on?" I heard as though from a distance.
"Okay John, turn to face me," Mycroft said, "I assume you have finished?" He asked the doctor who nodded, "Okay then, follow me John" he said before walking away. I followed him out the room and along some corridors.
"Why...?" I asked then droned off in realisation. It was because Sherlock loved me, there would be no other way to convince Mycroft to help otherwise. I changed topics quickly. "I assume we are going to the surveillance room?" I asked. Sherlock rolled his eyes at my obvious stupidity, which I ignored, and continued onward. After several long corridors and three flights of stairs, we made it to the surveillance room and stood outside.
A moment later Sherlock let go and I turned away quickly to make myself some cereal keeping my back to Sherlock in the hope he wouldn't see my erection.
"No, no, no! You're not asking the right questions!" He almost yelled before throwing his legs off the sofa, standing up, and started pacing back and forth up and down the room. I stood to match him but stayed where I was with my arms crossed.
Sighing I followed him out to the main road. A few minuets later a cab pulled up and Sherlock got in, I was about to follow when he said, "Mycroft wants to speak to you, get in the black car," Then he slammed the door and the cab left. I turned around and looked for a black car but there wasn't one in sight.
"You said you loved me, Sherlock," I said quietly, looking into his eyes. It was the first open act of defiance in months but I didn't care. He wanted to know what he said so I told him.
What I saw drained the blood from my face and I was filled with fright. As long as I will live I will never get this horror out of my head.
Sherlock walked over to me and pushed me onto the bed pinning my arms above my head and kissed me. I kissed him back but reflexively struggled against his grip causing him to lean onto me, completely pinning me to the bed. Being submissive like this wasn't my strong suit and I fought to gain dominance and I could tell Sherlock liked my struggle because as he leaned into me I felt a lump between his legs push against me.
"Hmm, good for you." I said miserably and, even though I knew it was against the rules, I threw myself into one of the arm chairs and put my head in my hands. The rules didn't matter any more, I wasn't going to follow them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once again Sherlock examined the body then called me over to take a look. I tried harder this time to notice things but there wasn't much to see. In the end I turned to Sherlock and said, "It's very similar to the last murder, he wasn't killed here so as you said last time he must have been dragged here then his arms put like this as a sign. Could it be the time of death because the last one was killed at around 12 o'clock and that's where his arms where placed. Anyway this murder doesn't look as professional this man was obviously in a fight just before he died but I don't see what that could mean. Once again it defiantly was the knife that killed him, but I have no idea what that note means," With that I stood up and looked at Sherlock proud of myself.
"No," I said, the words had barely left my lips when the pain started. I shuddered and brought my knees up to my chest, I wasn't getting up.
We headed to the main road but got stopped by a woman with long curly brown hair who was looking at Sherlock in contempt.
After 30 minuets of uneventful rest I decided to go back downstairs, staying in my room was doing nothing for me. I sat down in the chair that had its back to the kitchen and rested my head in my hands. I stayed like this for what seemed like forever. The dread that filled me seemed to slow down time giving me more of a chance to think about what could happen to me. It turned seconds into minuets, minuets into hours, and hours into days. I would have been doing something to distract me but once again my body refused to more so I stayed how I was until I heard the door open and I saw Sherlock walk into the room.
"So, um. What are we going to do?" I asked quietly after I found my voice. We had to do something.
I looked over at him, his eyes were still shut and it looked like he hadn't moved. I looked over at the clock and was taken aback by the time. It was already 8 o'clock, why won't Sherlock eat? In the end I decided it wasn't my place to ask and went into the kitchen to make myself some food but before I could Sherlock's phone went of. I turned to look at Sherlock who hadn't moved.
Mycroft walked over to him and handed him a booklet, "Wouldn't want you to break him." He said before leaving.
"Oh hi John," He replying slurring his words, "I didn' know you were there. You were so silent even a teeny tiny li'le mouse would have been lou'er."
I know I'm mean. I wonder what happened to Sherlock... (*Evil smile*)
"Mghhh!" He moaned annoyed but opened his eyes.
"You're Sherlock's... slave," She stated, "Hmm, I didn't think he was that sort of person." She said quietly under her breath looking slightly disappointed and upset at the news.
"You have no idea what you are meddling in Sherlock. I'm curious, how did yours get disabled?"
After a few weeks my back recovered enough for the cheap stitches to come out and for me to remove the bandages. They where only cheap useless things, weren't much use anyway, so it didn't mach much of a difference other then the fact that now I could see damage. A constant reminder that I wasn't equal to everyone else and it still hurt if I moved to quickly or in a way that pulled my back. I barely noticed the weeks passing us by and in no time at all a whole year had gone turning the cuts on my back into scars.
We entered the old decrepit room filled full of police, and Anderson.
"What's going to happen now?" I asked quizzically.
"Once you have eaten you may go to bed; I will be staying up for a while," Sherlock said before going to his laptop.
"Bleach?" I asked rhetorically through the leather knowing the answer already.
"WELL?" I asked, almost yelling, storming up to him and spinning him around forcefully.
"Okay Sherlock, time for..." Before I could even finish my sentence he collapsed on the bed and went straight to sleep. Sighing I undressed him and went to leave.
I was standing in the room opposite the doctor; the door to my right opened and Mycroft walked in.
About an hour later I heard the door to Sherlock's bedroom open and looked over to see the man himself striding out.
"Thank you, you really have outdone yourself," I heard Mycroft say.
I felt my erection spring free and I had an immediate sense of relief at no longer being confined. I heard the sound of Sherlock undressing also before he opened my leg and move between them. I could tell he was on his hands and knees because his hand were grabbing the sides of my hips keeping them still.
I replied like the good little slave I was,
"Well done, of course you missed everything of significance but aside from that good," Sherlock said smugly, "You were right, his killer was a professional and he didn't kill him here, there isn't enough blood, so he was dragged to this location. That would explain why his arms are like they are but they have been placed completely straight if the killer had just dragged him here and nothing more then the arms would be slightly bent from when he dropped them but no he placed them the way they are, probably as a message. We don't need to find out anything about him, his killer didn't even know him. But I can see everyone wants to know who he is so, he is a pianist who performs at restaurants and things like that, you can tell be his hands, he has long fingers and the starting of arthritis in his thumbs also in his pockets are several leaflets with his name on directing people to restaurants around here and that's not even mentioning the suit. He is single but really wants a girlfriend, going by his phone, watch and shoes all aimed to impress people, mainly girls. Oh and his name is Jeffrey Carmichael, it says on the leaflets."
He got that right, I wasn't much of a cook. I walked over to the laptop and had a look to see what I should do and at the same time I dumped Sherlock's wallet back on the table.
"I thought I told you to stay in bed next to me," Sherlock said sounding almost back to his normal self.
"What do you mean, 'you have no idea what you are meddling in'?" Sherlock asked before also taking a seat. I hadn't moved and wasn't planning to until Sherlock called. "John take a seat." Sighing, I did as he said and took the seat next to Sherlock. Mycroft raised an eyebrow but didn't say a thing. He turned back to face Sherlock before replying.
"You know you should really call before coming over. I also let you in, the least you could do is thank me" She said calling after us.
Mycroft seemed to understand what I was asking because a moment later he said, "Even if there was some loop hole that would allow me to set you free I wouldn't be able to remove that collar that is embedded in your brain. I'm afraid you signed up for this for life and now you have to live with the consequences."
I looked at the clock and was surprised to see it was 5 o'clock. I had better go to the shops and get some food.
"I suppose then that you should go and stand near Sherlock in case he needs something," Molly said before walking away.
"Why is your brother helping us?" I asked struggling to keep up with Sherlock's long pace. Apparently realising my struggle, the man slowed down slightly before answering.
I knew I should only speak when spoken to but I couldn't help myself, Sherlock looked in such a good mood. "Where are we going?" I asked tentatively.
"Yes master?" I said racing downstairs.
"I will pretend this never happened, I need to think, I don't want breakfast so do what you want just follow the rules. De-activate control" Sherlock said then walked off into his room. How was I going to defy him and the system if he was giving me my space with no orders.
He suddenly broke off from the kiss leaving me breathless on the bed.
His words hit me like a bullet but for the first time I realised the truth in it. Even the small pain from my wrists were turning me on. Suddenly the memory of when I was first punished came back to me. It hurt so much and back then I was so dazed by it I didn't even realise; I was aroused by the pain even then. This realisation shocked me but suddenly a whole load of things in my life now made sense, such as why I joined the army. I tried to look around to see Sherlock but I realised I was still blindfolded. I wanted it off. I needed to see what was happening. I tugged at my restraints making more pain flash down my arms and I felt my cock twitch again.
I nodded once and moved to crouch next to the body it was only then I could read the note, 'CNDHSTODMOTOMFELICEIMMCKANREK.' What the hell did that mean?
"How could you possibly know that about the note?" I said before I could help myself.
"Stay here John, I have to go out, I will be back soon and I will punish you then." Sherlock said striding past me and out the door. I stayed looking after him for a few minuets then decided to get some sleep. I would need my strength for whatever Sherlock had planned. I walked to my bedroom, laid down, shut my eyes, and tried to sleep.
I shut my eyes and took in a deep breath to try to calm myself, it didn't work, then with shaking fingers I undid the buttons and pulled off my shirt leaving me naked from the waist up. I walked over to the door and did as Sherlock said so my arms where raised slightly above my head ready for me to be restrained. I knew I had to remain standing or I would be in more pain due to my bullet wound from when I was in the army. Although it had healed it would hurt if I hung solely from my wrists. I felt the metal snap around my wrists and I gave them an experimental tug only to find they were very secure; there would be no escaping now.
After Sherlock finished I remained silent. I didn't want any trouble, I had to be good for Harry's sake.
"S-S-Sherlock, I'm gonna... I-I-I'm gonna... c-come!" I stuttered out. I knew he was close to because it just made him pound into me harder.
"I have two options for you John." Mycroft said, "You could return to your normal life but that would mean your sister would no longer be getting support and consequently she would become a slave,"
"You seem to have forgotten the rules already, speak only when spoken to, but I will answer your question. I didn't want the police to know I had a slave. If they found out they could order you to do stuff and you would have no choice because the police have ultimate control over slaves purely for the reason that if I ordered you to break the law they could stop you. Anyway they would be able to use you and I don't want that because you are mine," Sherlock said then threw gritted teeth added, "I own you,"
"SHERLOCK!" I screamed as I came all over the bed. Watching me come must have been to much because a moment later gave his last thrust into me and moan as he spent himself soothing my insides.
"John, take your scarf off." He commanded, I didn't even have to think before obeying, it was my job to obey after all. "No one looks twice at a slave. Go in there and knock out the two security guards." Understanding at once, I pulled the door open and in a few minutes the two guards were lying unconscious on the floor. Sherlock dragged me in and shut the door behind us, separating us from the world. There were several monitors lining a desk with two keyboards infront of them. I took a seat next to Sherlock and observed him. He seemed desperate, and anxious, and I could understand why. This needed to be done, but if we failed... Sherlock watched the screens with rapt attention and I watched him, waiting for him to find something. After a moment he seemed to find something and pointed. "Look there John. It's on her desk. Look at the screens and memorise where it is, you need to walk there with no hesitation. Keep your head down and act like you belong. Once they see your collar they won't question your presence. Go, meet me in Mycroft's office." I looked at the floor, it was four floors up, exactly where Mycroft said to go. I took one more look at where to go, shoved the scarf in my pocket, and left the room.
We walked along a few corridors then entered a mortuary where a short mousy haired woman was stood next to the body of Jeffrey Carmichael.
I felt his hand by my ankles as he grabbed hold of my shoes and pulled them off, my socks with them, and as soon as there was nothing in the way he grabbed hold of the bottom of my trousers and tugged them off as well leaving me dressed in only my underwear which where also swiftly removed.
Sherlock turned his gaze to me, "John, this is your last chance. I know your sister has recently died and, according to Wikipedia, people can do strange even rebellious things when they feel they have nothing to lose" he started, looking as if he didn't believe one word of what he was saying, "So I will let you off this once, also I'm busy I have a case to solve. Trust me, you wouldn't be getting away with this if I was bored. Now make yourself useful and..."
"Sherlock?" I asked tentatively. I still didn't know what happened but I needed to know he was okay.
