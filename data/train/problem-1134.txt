Magnussen’s lips parted in what at least resembled a grin although it looked more like a very unnatural stretching of his facial expressions.
“No, I believe I was quite thorough.”
He wondered if he should perhaps try to warn John about what Magnussen had in his possession, to save him from yet another shock. But on the other hand, it would be unnecessary to mention it if Magnussen decided to never bring attention to the pictures he had in his possession.
But as he raised his gaze to his nightly visitor he realised that it wasn’t Sherlock who was standing by the door.
John could hear Mycroft talk to someone in the background but then returned.
“And how did you manage to rid yourself of Charles Magnussen then? I saw your men taking a bunch of photos of him and Sherlock, are those for blackmailing purposes or what?”
But there was no reply to his curt order and there was also no sound of receding footsteps, and despite his back being turned to the door Sherlock could still feel the presence of the other person loitering in the doorway.
He didn’t really need Mycroft to pull this off, he could manage on his own and even if it would be trickier to continue pursuing the Magnussen business without Mycroft finding out, it was preferable to being subjected to these types of lectures every time he did something Mycroft had not given him permission to do.
“Please....” he wheezed and stared straight into the other one’s eyes. But there was only black anger in them, a look of possessiveness clouding everything else.
“He isn’t like everyone else.”
“My brother would love for me to end the engagement, believe me, it’s not Mycroft that’s forcing me into it.”
“Because, strictly speaking, it isn’t wrong. I’m leaving.”
There was no need though, he quickly scrambled out of bed, cast a quick assessing look in the mirror to see that he look at least somewhat presentable after a hard day’s work and then hurried after her out of the barrack.
“You’re jesting.....”
“Excellent. Now I won’t hold you any longer from your duties.  I’ll see you tomorrow at seven, Dr Watson.”
John nodded and put his hands on his knees as if he had made a decision. He hoped to project the image of someone who was ready to do business.
“For some unfathomable reason you decided to slave away at this facility upon your return, that is until  you procured the golden ticket that earned you a better position as well as a higher salary while performing the most lowly medical tasks imaginable. For someone who went through the hardship of medical school and then served in the army, it is quite a mystery why you would settle for such a menial assignment if there wasn’t something else that drew your interest. Which brings me to the very reason for my curiosity in the man that hides beneath the medical title.”
“Apologies for keeping you out in the cold. My cameras are not supervised by staff, so I’m afraid I wasn’t paying attention,” he mumbled while casting a suspicious eye over Magnussen’s shoulder. “And frankly I wasn’t expecting company. Will you tell me now what has brought you here? What pressing matter could possible warrant a visit instead of just making a call?”
FROM: Mycroft
The church is crowded. Sarah’s family is in the front row, her mum and sister are next to each other, holding hands, crying. On the other side of the church there’s Sherlock and Victor sitting next to each other. Behind them, John, Lestrade and Mary.
Sherlock hums, quite annoyed.
‘To his wife’ Sherlock answers, smirking.
TO: SHERLOCK
----------
Greg’s mouth twist into an unsatisfied smirk.
Sherlock looks at the menu ‘Lestrade is always better, anyway…Ok, so-’
‘AN EXPERIMENT??????????’ John turns red, angry
To : John
‘Would you like to go to the movies with me?’
‘Mmm…and we should..
Sherlock nods, taking more biscuits
‘Did it all arrive from France this morning?’ John asks, smirking.
Stop it.
He looks at Sherlock not understanding anything of the courses ‘Ok..let’s make something easy..I can make a delicious Pan Bagnat’
After reading it, he realizes that John’s gone. He’s alone on the sofa, the sun’s rays filtering though the open curtains as his phone buzzes again.
‘Nothing yet, I don’t know. What should I tell him?’
Sherlock stands up and goes closer to him, their faces almost touching, and whispers ‘I want everyone to see us’
‘Sherlock, you’re avoiding me!’
‘I’m-’ he looks around with half-lidded eyes ‘I’m in Baker Street.’
‘I do what I want!’
John mumbles the words, tearfully.
Sherlock looks embarrassed. "Sorry...didn't mean to wake you up"
To: Sherlock
‘Do you want to see it?’ Greg asks to Molly, taking his phone
‘Yes, we shared a room together’
‘I’M TALKING TO HIM! JUST TURN THAT RADIO OFF!’ He does, and then hears his phone ringing. It’s still on the seat where he threw it, so he swerves to try and reach it while driving.
To : Sherlock
‘We were bringing him to Hospital, Mycroft! You wanted to come back here. You brought the fucking adrenaline, and now you’re gonna do it!’
‘..I'd like to talk to you about something important, if you have any time’ ‘Sure, is it for the essay? Or the exam?’
‘I don’t know…I didn’t see much, to be honest,….when he turned a page I saw these polaroids of a young boy, I don’t know much…’
'Over here,’ Sherlock jerks his head to the left, eyeing a velvet rope, ‘I booked a privèe.’
John moves to follow, but Greg interjects.
John reads his words, check the post before publishing it. Then reads a draft written before, ready to delete it:
‘You were…what? Dancing?’ Sherlock and John look at each other and start laughing hysterically.
WRONG
Victor looks worried “Nothing..just...she talked about Daniel...that he was missing. She told me he didn’t answer her calls, and his family was looking for him. I didn’t know anything, he used to skip class, so I didn’t worry that much, until she told me she couldn’t find him. And then the police arrived. I thought it was for Daniel, and instead it was for me.."
‘ohhh this is you!’
‘And that was just a tiny example of how much hard my adolescence with him was’ He takes a packet of cigarette from his jacket, and turns one on
TO: JOHN
Sherlock closes his eyes. ‘When did you bring this lp?’
Sherlock sees the pen drive on the table, then looks at John. “Nothing..nothing important.”
Sherlock looks at John ‘We would like to ask you few questions about your husband’
Sherlock looks at him, trying to find some words ‘You know….’ gesticulating with his hands
‘You could eat for months with all this food, Sherlock!’ she comments, finally deciding on a strawberry.
‘See you later. Bye.’
'Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?!'
‘No...He...what are you implying?’
‘Yes, why are you finished earlier though? You said you would be coming back on Sunday.’
“She IS Sarah..” He answers, angrily and sad.
‘again??’
‘Okay, we’re going now, alright?’ John pushes Sherlock out the door with a firm hand on his back, and uses the other to wave at Lestrade.
‘Well, you know it can happen, it was a bad moment for you, and you should understand her, I mean she wanted to have fun and relax…as she should understand you, don’t worry, you’ll fix everything up soon, you’ll book another holiday soon and you’ll enjoy it’
‘I quickly understood that Victor was important for Sherlock. That’s why I sent Sherlock to Victor’s house, his father was a kind man, and replaced our father’s role many times. Victor’s dad knew it , he understood everything,...and he stayed with my brother for long time. They spent a summer together, Sherlock, Victor, and his dad, until Sherlock got too far with the drugs, and Victor’s dad decided to split them, forever...until now...’
Greg turns toward Sherlock ‘Boy---hey, if you’re implying anything—‘he follows him in the bathroom, where the alarm is still on, and digits the numbers: 29 – 01 –10.
‘Excellent’
‘sad about Gatsby’s death?’
They stare at each other, then Mary speaks. “I lied to protect Sherlock, and John. Victor Trevor was involved in the Moran case since the beginning. I’ve lied to you, to all of you..to get closer to him. But now it's over. The case is almost complete." She smirks.
‘Just one, on his leg, but John fixed it.’
‘What?’
‘Here - sit here.’ Mycroft insists, slowly removing Sherlock’s arm from his shoulder. Confused, Sherlock inhabits the bed sheets. Though he sits straight, his sight is hazy.
She shots but suddenly a hand moves the gun away, making her fall on the floor: it's John.
‘Goodnight, have a beautiful honeymoon together!’
‘I don’t know, I didn’t watch it’ Greg answers
‘No…I was with you. I don’t know…he’s probably just a bit nauseated, you know how much we’ve drunk tonight.’
‘I already did’
‘COME HERE! SCREW THE BOOK!’ Mycroft shouts.
Anthea shows the sms to Mycroft, who gently smiles at her, nodding, and keeps eating and looking at the minister.
From : John
He climbs quickly the stairs ‘Sherlock!!!!’ he shouts
‘He came up here, locked himself in the room for the entire day, and didn’t leave it until he checked out and paid early this morning. Strange isn’t it?’
‘What do you mean?’
‘To..Sherlock? Nothing, I just-‘
Victor hugs Sarah’s sister, crying. Greg is standing on the church’s stairs, staring off into the distance. Sherlock is next to him.
‘Sherlock needs to eat or he’ll faint. Plus he needs to assimilate the drug. Thus, he needs food. He needs to eat. Go buy something - steaks.’
FROM: SHERLOCK
‘Hey, Woodley’s gone’
“He tried to learn how to do it a couple of days ago, and to make breakfast. But he failed.”
Sherlock slides into the kitchen, and flips on the kettle. Then he nervously walks around the kitchen, seemingly without aim, and John stares up at him.
‘The home is cold. The heat went off after the explosion. You must wear something Sherlock or you’ll freeze.’
"I was busy with the case, and anyway I called him, he told me you were fine, I wanted to visit later but he told me you still needed some rest."
John and Sherlock turn to look at each other.
“Can I come in?” He asks, licking his lower lip.
(4:10 pm)
TO: SARAH
They all take the glasses of beer
‘We’ll stay here… in case you need anything.’
‘What happened guys? Do I need to forgive you for something?’ he shouts from his office.
‘Yes, you can’
They still look at each other, Sherlock’s breath becomes stronger, his look sterner. Suddenly, Sherlock’s phone rings.
You both could even pay me a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way
‘Understand – do you understand?’ Once more Greg finds himself unable to reply. John stares stubbornly, his wide eyes insisting. He appeals frantically to Greg, ‘Do you really understand what’s going on in there? Inside his – Sherlock’s… mind?’
‘Sure.’
‘Where were you tonight, John?’
Greg doesn’t answer.
‘No - no! No! I was just asking... Just asking.’
‘That’s because you prefer staying at home, instead of watching out for my brother!’
‘Really?’ she asks, surprised ‘Why? You think he didn’t die for an accident? He was run over a car while crossing the street’
‘I told you we had to investigate on him!’ He answers enthusiastic
Sherlock looks at the man who was watching their exchange silently. ‘Um…I must go now’, the man says smiling, and heads toward the living room, taking his jacket from the sofa.
‘Oh, we go check on him, yeah?’ Greg suggests and moves to get up. Sherlock dismisses him with a sharp hand motion.
‘Sure….’ Looking at Sherlock ‘would you like to come someday?’
They both frown,...John whispers “keep talking!!"
‘Your birthday, Myke’s birth-‘ Sherlock turns toward him, Greg is blushing, embarrassed.
His phones buzzes the notification of an SMS, he looks down at the phone still in his hand.
Before dragging it as the other one he looks at the stuff in it: papers, agendas and letters. He randomly looks at them, leafing briefly: letters from Ministers, Governments, acts, law sketches, reports on the economic status of the country, everything is chronologically organised. He takes a huge packet of them, smirking ‘Guess who’s having fun, now, Mycroft’. While he takes them to throw them all downstairs, one of them falls on the floor. He takes it and opens it.
‘Ahhhhh damn it!!!’
The Journalist “
‘Okay’ John comments going toward the door ‘Hey, we didn’t have dinner after all last night, we could arrange for tonight, what do you think?‘
‘What I have to do?? Yell at him that I will fight to death to have our friendship back??’
FROM : John
Sherlock : ‘Fear that our bad breath might ruin our friendships...’
‘What?’
[ M__ +5 8251004099 – He’s getting too far. I don’t like it.]
John looks away, mind still racing, ‘I…I… don’t know.’
‘What, Greeeeeg?’
‘Oh, okay… what are you doing?’
Greg rises his eyes, thinking “Mmmm...yes”
A group of school children are sitting on red chairs, their instruments on their hands. John Rance is standing up between them, a group of journalist and cameras are in front of him. Sherlock walks through the park’s gate, walking in, looking at the stage.
John turns towards Sherlock ‘Ohh, okay, perfect. So, you have a new list, right?’
‘Big crowd?? You were the last, everyone left!! There were like…5 people or something, and everyone laughed at you except me who tried to support you, at the end of your shameless and horrible performance I was the only one who clapped’
‘Wait’ he takes him by his left arm
"...And I don’t think I have much to live.”
John runs into the kitchen.
‘It m-wow! A five star breakfast!, John you must have spent your entire salary on this!!’ she replies ironically.
Things to Never Say When Apologizing:
Sherlock runs downstairs, ‘Who?’ He looks at Mrs Hudson, eyes hastily moving from her to the open door.
‘Taxi!’
‘Are you coming?’
‘Yes, of course. I...uh, I wanted to ask you to be my Best Man.’
‘Got anything interesting?’ John asks.
‘What’s this?’
‘Control it or you’ll come too soon’
‘We all make mistakes, John’
Mycroft shouts “Get out of here and find Daniel before Moran will kill him!”
JL : Hello?…..yes…..yes…yes, he’s here.
To : Sherlock
‘Ronald Adair was one of Moriarty’s gang, and someone wanted him dead'
"I don't want to involve myself into this, not again! We were talking about Sherlock again, and I don't want this..I can't change my life if I still keep talk to you about him"
"John" He whispers, turning to face him.
Couldn't wish for better.
'Cause you're not welcome anymooooooore
TO: SHERLOCK
‘Is that what they want to be called?’
‘Your bookshelf is getting dusty, you don’t read anymore?’
‘Yes!! How don’t you know it John?? Everyone’s reading them!’
Sherlock finally raises his head and peers over his shoulder after the worker. His lips are cherry red, and puffy from suckling on John. He hardly breathes, as John studies his profile; his messy curls, the aroma of alcohol wafting around them. His hands are still clasped protectively around John, who finally returns the gesture and puts his own on Sherlock’s waist, and continues to stare openly at him. John feels so relaxed, and comfortable, his eyes half-closed- smiles up at Sherlock.
Sherlock takes off his dressing gown, taking his coat and going downstairs, Greg runs following him.
‘We’ll do it here’
John grabs Sherlock's arm, while he's trying to open the door and go away "Tell me what's going on, who are you protecting? Tell me!"
FROM: Greg
(from the kitchen) ‘Oh, right...you all drink tea in England...’
"From the first time we met in the bus..when you showed me your notebook full of polaroids and scribbles of you and him at the school...you've always loved him,..for so many years."
TO : MH
Sherlock reaches over his plate, for packet of biscuits. Sharply, the pirates’ packet is torn open, crumbs spilling out over the last of his steak. Eyebrows rising as his eyes catch sight of the picture on the packet, Sherlock gobbles the biscuits.
‘Magnifique’
‘So it’s gay porn.’
‘Rachel discovered that Drebber and John Rance had been lovers for years, they had been together before Enoch J. Drebber got married with her, but he never had the courage to come out and love John Rance outside the four walls, so he decided to marry Rachel and follow a respectable heterosexual life.’
From : John
Never tried
John cracks a laugh, nervously ‘It’s not the same thing’
‘Sure?’
Mycroft nods, nervously sweating.
‘Sherlock, are you with us tonight?’
Sherlock whose still looking out the window, raises his left eyebrow.
"Oh really?" The actress comments, smiling surprised.
‘…so? Sherlock wasn’t there?’
Sherlock and Victor are having dinner in front of the fireplace, with a wool blanket on the floor and a bottle of wine and Japanese food. Victor pours wine in the glasses.
‘I don’t know I don’t know!! Stop bothering Mrs. Hudson!’ John answers.
‘What about it?’ John asks looking at him.
Sherlock laughs.
"I can't find her! Her phone is off, yesterday she looked scared and worried...she's helping me, you know.. since you left me alone...I had to find someone else...I've been looking for her for hours...her flat is empty. I'm afraid something happened to her, Sherlock."
“Snickerdoodle hot cocoa, if you don’t mind. Molly. We were in a biology course together last year.”
They drank their sweet and hot concoctions in silence for a while.
“If you were wondering, Molly did not mention anything about you invading her privacy. She actually appreciated your company. God knows why…”
“Yes.” Sherlock replied. He appeared to be more composed.
“I am making curry. It’ll be done in ten minutes. You’ll eat with me, yeah?” John replied back.
“I… But you…” Sherlock tried to form sentences but he was having trouble.
“Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize anyone else was here.” John immediately replied. He entered the waiting area this woman was sitting in. “I am John, by the way. The night janitor.” He took a real look at the woman. She looked deflated but determined. Her make up showed signs of crying and she was clinging to the male jacket she was wearing a bit too tight. John suddenly recognized her from one of his classes. He felt a sense of foreboding. He should not have talked to her. He should not have come into this room. He should not have entered the station in such an unabashed manner. “Well, I should get to work. Thank you for letting me know about Greg.” John tried to take his leave.
They quickly walked to John’s apartment in silence. John let him in. As they were taking their places on the living room couch, Sherlock was inquisitively looking around.
John forgot how tiring this job could be when he had to take and give classes at the same time. On the minus side, he was teaching an advanced course for the first time meaning that it was a lot more work than teaching an introductory lab for the forth time. On the plus side, two of his four courses were independent research classes meaning that he got to make up his schedule. He had a three-hour seminar on Monday and another one on Tuesday. He was teaching the collab lab on Thursdays. Since he worked on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday as a janitor, he only had two tough days a week. Mondays and Thursdays. Tuesdays and Wednesdays were easier with either only going to class or going to work. He had three whole days to do his homework. That night was the end of his first week with classes and work. He wanted to sleep for the next three days. He would too if he let himself. But alas, he already had homework. That night, though, he did sleep like a log. And if he saw a pair of incandescent eyes ever changing its colors like the sea, he did not remember it in the morning.
John grimaced. “He is not that bad.”
“Well, actually… He is a great student but he is pretty ordinary in my class.” John said wistfully.
“Would you like to help me?” John found himself asking.
“I asked a question in class and before the TA got a chance to answer it, he told me to shut up because I was lowering the IQ of the whole university. I just want to get as far away as possible from the little shit.”
John had been nervous about this first class. The cold sweats kind of nervous. But Sherlock had made him nervous in a different way. The warm and fuzzy kind of nervous. John kept waiting Sherlock to correct him like he has previously done with many professors. Professors! People with actual graduate degrees and years of experience!! That was an empty worry on John’s part since he did not actually teach anything this first class. It was not like Sherlock could correct the syllabus. This would not surprise you if you knew John. He was smart. Very smart. However, John did not think with his head. He thought with his heart. So irrational fears came with the territory of thinking with one’s heart.
“Have you ever heard of the high school kid who used to take classes here a couple of years ago? He was very smart but he really annoyed a lot of people including some very important professors.”
“Yes!” Sherlock shouted.
“Wait, what are you talking about?” Sherlock asked as he sat down.
“Thanks, mate. So are you going to tell me this amazing story or what?”
After that night, Greg mentioned Sherlock a lot more. Even on numerous occasions, Greg recruited Sherlock’s help on solving some tough cases. While Greg never gave any details on the cases (especially on Molly’s), it was crystal clear that Greg respected and even admired Sherlock’s brilliance. Moreover, after that night, Molly and John grew close. They both were pre-med. They both were TAs. Most importantly, Molly’s nerdiness matched John’s nerdiness. First, John had sent Molly a message on facebook apologizing for not saying goodbye. They had started to talk and decided to meet for coffee. Now, they met for coffee once a week at least.
After spending a minute or two on all the other students, he was finally looking at Sherlock’s transcript. William Sherlock Scott Holmes, who apparently was barely 18 years old, was taking five courses this semester. All advanced science courses except an introductory psychology course. He had not taken any classes the previous semester. “Why would he wait until the spring semester to start university?” John thought to himself. There were another eight courses Sherlock had taken two years prior. “He must have taken all these when he was still in high school” John surmised. “Wow, he really is very impressive taking all these courses and receiving As at that age.” John was impressed. Honestly, he had always been impressed of Sherlock.
“I know you are interested in me. When you are close to me, your pulse gets higher - signaled by your faster respiration rate - and your pupils dilate. All I wanted to do was to prove you wrong. I wanted you to kick yourself in the ass for making inept judgments about others. I wanted to you to like me. And you did. And it has been awful. Because this is not me. I am not this person you are interested in. I am not this respectable, sensible, smart-but-not-too-smart person. I don’t have friends. Like I’m sure you think the other students in the class were my friends because we were friendly but we are most definitely not. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all around obnoxious asshole anyone can possibly have the misfortunate to meet. I don’t expect that I will ever have any friends. I am intolerable. I still am everything I was all those years ago.” Sherlock was hyperventilating.
A couple weeks into the semester and John was dealing with his life like a boss. He was on top of his two seminar courses and his two independent research courses. He was also acing the whole teaching thing. The groups had chosen their research topics and they were almost done with their literature reviews. There was only one problem bothering him. It honestly was not that John thought things were going so good that he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. It wasn’t. It was just that Sherlock was acting super weird. He was acting like any other student. John had noticed that Sherlock, who used to be a smartass high school kid, only answered some of the questions he asked the class. There were times when John would ask a question to his class and no one would answer it, not even Sherlock. John knew Sherlock knew the answer. He did not understand why Sherlock would not give him the answer. It was not like Sherlock was not paying attention to the class. And Sherlock did sometimes answer John’s questions. More specifically, John noticed that Sherlock answered four of his questions per class. Every class. It was almost like Sherlock was trying to hold himself back but John did not know why. He blamed himself. Maybe he was not a support enough instructor. One time, John tried to goat Sherlock to speak a fifth time by making a blatantly incorrect statement as he was lecturing. He looked at Sherlock right after and saw that Sherlock was looking down with a sad look on his face, like he was disappointed in John or something. John stopped his lecture to tell his students off for not catching the obvious mistake he made on purpose. He continued to say there were three possibilities: either they did not do the reading so they did not know that John said something incorrect, they were not paying attention so they did not catch the mistake, or John is a horrible TA and was not able to cultivate a good learning environment so the students were not comfortable correcting him. He apologized if the latter was true and tried to encourage his students to always ask him questions, to speak their minds and to challenge him. John was sure that this would lead to Sherlock answering more questions but it did not. This lead to John changing his lesson plans a bit. He started to ask the most difficult questions in the first half of the class and only leave the easier questions for later. He did this so that Sherlock would at least be answering interesting questions that other students would not be able to answer anyways. It still bothered him, though. He failed to create an environment in which one of the most brilliant students in the university could engage with his class.
John was waiting for his roommate to get out of class outside the chemistry labs. Lo and behold, Anderson was the first person to get out.
“I hadn’t until this week. I found out because his dorm room got robbed.”
John was surprised. No one at the university had heard from him for almost 3 years. John accessed Sherlock’s transcript before he realized what he had done. He looked away from the computer feeling guilty. “But this is an advanced course and I need to know if he is ready to take such an advanced course” he tried to reason with himself. “But I did not do this for any of the other students” he argued. He sighed and signed off from Sherlock’s transcript. He decided to look over all the student’s transcripts since he still had 33 minutes before the class. He was going to look at Sherlock’s transcript last. This was a great idea! It would provide him with a better understanding of the students in his class. He would be more equipped to know what his students knew or what they were interested in.
John nodded. Of course he knew of the high school kid. The kid was infamous. Striking for his 15 years of age. Perfectly curly hair. The beautiful ever changing eyes. Smarter than, well, everyone. Including the professors. He knew it. And he made sure everyone else knew it too. Posh accent. Posh clothes. Posh car that came with a driver. Posh name. Sherlock Holmes. What kind of name was even that?
“Yeah actually. It’s kind of amazing how it all went down. The whole thing is wrapped nicely with a bow. Happy ending for Martha.”
“So, want to start from the beginning?” John prompted Sherlock.
Another couple of minutes… “No, it’s getting a bit scary now.”
“Yeah, yeah. I should. Was that really…” John trailed off.
“Ok, then. I am officially your instructor until I am done with your final. Let me grade it here and then we can go somewhere else to talk, yeah?” John looked into the incandescent eyes with the color of the sea.
Molly continued. “One of my friends just got dumped so she wanted to go out and party. We fancied dancing so we went to Phi Tau. We drank a bit too much. We were talking to some of the brothers and I mentioned that I wasn’t feeling great. One of them, whose name was Sebastian Wilkes, offered to let me use his room until I felt a bit better. I did not leave my friend but she said she could use the opportunity to hook up with one of the other brothers. So, I thought I could just recuperate for like fifteen minutes in Seb’s room before I had to walk home. He led me to his room. He went in first. After I joined him, he closed and locked the door. He promptly told me that I was to blow him if I wanted to get out. I froze up. He added that I could scream all I want but no one would hear me because of the music downstairs. I…” Molly cleared her throat. “He eventually let me out of the room. I got out the frat house and was walking home when I ran into Sherlock. You know of him, yeah? He took one look at me and he told me it wasn’t my fault, the guy was an asshole and he could walk me to the campus security. I was still in shock when I ran into him. I was not functional enough to think clearly enough to report Seb. Anyways, Sherlock’s eccentric honesty snapped me out of it, we went to the campus security and that’s where I met you. Yadee yadee yada. Greg was worried about the case turning into an impossible “he said she said” one. Sherlock went behind our backs and put cameras in Seb’s room. Last weekend, he tried to pull same shit on another girl and it’s all on video.”
“Yes, of course. Why wouldn’t I be? You are basically a teddy bear with rugby shorts and a doctor’s coat.” Sherlock declared.
“Well, I thought doing something might help.” John was not sure it was a good idea anymore.
John looked toward where Sherlock had walked away but could not find him.
“Excuse me?”
“So, how was it?” Sherlock asked with a smirk.
“Then, everything else can wait. Shut up and take your damn exam.” John put a copy of the final on Sherlock’s desk.
Sherlock took in a big breath. “Three years ago I heard you calling me a ‘git’ while talking to your then-roommate. It upset me a lot because I had a little bit of a crush on you. When I came back at the beginning of this semester, I found out that you were teaching an advanced lab. I decided that I was going to take your class and make you believe that I was this respectable, sensible, smart-but-not-too-smart person and make you regret your snap judgment of me. I mean we weren’t even in any of the same circles. It was not fair for you to decide that you did not like me without knowing me. So, I have been pretending to be someone I am really not for the last couple of months. Because I wanted you to like me. And then you did like me and I had never felt worse in my life. All of a sudden, I wanted you to like the real me. The insufferable one.” Tears started coming down Sherlock’s face. “But why would you? You know what I was doing for the last two years? I spent the former getting high out of this world and the latter getting clean. How could you ever like me? You are the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I’ve ever had the good fortune of knowing. You are one of the biggest supporters of the LGBTAQ+ community in this school. At the bachelor auction only, you make them enough money to last the semester. You convinced the whole rugby team to help out with Take back the Night. Your dedication to your students is exemplary. You treat everyone you meet with such kindness that they feel all warm inside. You…”
The finals week approached before John knew it. He welcomed it and dreaded it at the same time. Neither of these feelings had to do with graduation or med school. He welcomed the end of school because his obsession with Sherlock had gotten out of hand. John found it difficult to be in the same room as Sherlock and to pretend that Sherlock was any other student. On the other hand, the dreaded the end of school because he was not going to be able spend three hours every week in the same room as Sherlock anymore.
His phone went off as he discarded his soiled slippers into a waste basket for the servants to dispose of later. They had cost him a good 600 £ and had been a favourite pair for many years but were now beyond redemption.
That was also one of those things they never talked about.
Granted, he still had the missile plans and the threat of reveal to hang over Mycroft’s head even if Sherlock died. The question was if Mycroft would care as much about his own fate if he lost his brother forever?
There was now a poignant tone to Mycroft’s voice that John had no desire to acknowledge. Instead he decided to ignore it. There was no proof of anything inappropriate going on between him and Sherlock and he was tired of everyone’s insinuations.
His eyes widened in shock the longer he kept reading and once he was finished, he reread it a second time, his heart rate increasing and boiling anger rising inside of him as the impact of the message hit him with the force of a sledgehammer straight to the gut.
That it was Magnussen approaching was easy to tell as Sherlock recognised the man’s soft steps, now slightly hurried in pace but not too much, he was clearly trying to contain himself while simultaneously excited.
‘Ah, come on!’ Sherlock puts his hands in prayer position, closing his eyes, sitting on the sofa upside down, ‘Do you think I’m
He turns on the tap for cold water, and puts the towel under it, waiting for Lestrade’s reply.
Sherlock dismisses the question with a wave of his hand, and a  ‘boring.’
‘No! Go away, I’m fine here. It’s all over now. I don’t need to stay at your home.’
John takes the beer next to him, sipping, gazing over London city. 'Do you like....Paris?'
“So you neither want to help me?”
‘Yes.’
He puts the mobile on the bedside table, turning to gaze at Mary.
He smiles and goes toward Sherlock, sitting next to him ‘Ok, tell me what…a walk in the Park?’
‘So…he….he changed sex?’ John asks, confused.
Molly is sitting on the sofa, finishing her tea.
Damn T9, eh!
Greg: ‘The Jack Old is small, we won’t never seat.’
Mycroft tries to not look nervous, and turns gently toward the minister, smiling at him ‘Sorry, just….a misunderstanding’
Sherlock gets closer to her, trying to comfort her “Are you okay?” in a soft voice. Sherlock turns, looking at John, getting nervous. (louder) "What the hell happened???"
‘<<You’re in my soul, and that’s where I’ll leave you for the rest of my life’..>>
‘Where should I put these?’ she holds up a small bag full of blood vials, and fingers.
Mycroft's face turns sour, looking at the salmon on his sandwich, almost feeling guilty.
Sherlock grins broadly, stretching languidly upon the sofa.
John pauses for few seconds, huffing out a couple of breaths.
‘I love this music so much…it's my favourite Elvis song, it’s so sweet and romantic.’
John and Greg park, and stare openly from the car at people queuing outside the pub.
‘When I arrived with my brother the first day, and the assistant showed us all the university rooms and halls. When we entered in the library, a small group of us, there were many people reading silently, and when Victor saw us....
‘This is fame, Mary, get used to it,’ John answers coolly.
There are only 8 in there!
‘What a wise man’ Greg comments ironically
Sarah’s mother “Mr. Holmes, please....find her, she never did anything wrong, she never got herself into troubles, she's a kind girl, she loves her friends and family...she wouldn't go away purposely.”
‘We could…we could take Tanaka’s clue, and try to figure out who killed him, maybe this will bring us to Moran?’ John queries, looking between Sherlock and Lestrade.
Greg rolls his eyes, sighing annoyed.
Molly, smiling 'It's set in the Victorian era. In Doyle's book Mrs. Hudson is older and it's Sherlock's housekeeper'
"You should believe in what you taught us...because we believed in you. We still believe in you, just like we still believe in literature, and poetry. Sometimes a few lines of a quote can save a life.”
‘Okay….so,….’ He starts being nervous ‘don’t we want to listen to the radio?’
‘Is his winery any good?’
From : Mary
‘How is Sherlock Holmes doing?’
“You just want Victor to be involved in the case because you can’t admit to yourself he’s my boyfriend."
‘Okay……as you said..you enjoyed this week and this has nothing to do with john’
‘Maybe he didn’t have his phone with him’ Greg suggests
‘While I was here looking for the tea I suddenly heard an explosion, I didn’t worry that much to be honest because I’m used to Sherlock, and his experiments. So, I thought it was just him, but then I felt the house shaking and I thought it was an earthquake. I didn’t understand what was happening, and those explosions kept going off, so I ran upstairs, and when I came in I saw the destruction.’
‘Sherlock?’
No, that wasn't a question. Why are you drunk?
The sound of screeching tires comes from outside, Greg runs to the window.
Suddenly, John’s phone rings.
‘Good old days when I did nothing all day and passed the exams just studying the night before’
'I saw them..kissing!!’ he comments, with a rather sour face.
Sherlock sits in the bathtub, the water covering his body up to his shoulder. Mycroft takes his jacket off and peels back the sleeves of his shirt. He takes up a sponge and drags it through the bubbles. Sitting along the border of the bathtub, Mycroft rakes the sponge along Sherlock’s back. Sherlock sat quietly, as Mycroft poured hot water over his hair, running his hands through the dark locks carefully.
The hall is crowded. The students are reading their poems at the centre of the hall, with their sheets on the bookstand. Teachers are listening carefully. The hall is covered with flowers and a banner with photos of Sarah on the wall. Victor's students look at him walking in, quietly. They all smile, Victor smiles back, looking at Mark.
‘Is he still sleeping?’
TO: Myke
'Mycroft knows him well, I suppose. If he had been so dangerous as you think, he wouldn’t have been so close to Sherlock for so long, don’t you think?’
‘Do you want to date this one, too, Molly?’ Sherlock asks, sarcastically
She continues, getting closer to her and talking in an intimate way. "I have a son, too. I know how you feel.” Mary takes a pen on the counter and a napkin, writing. “This is my number...if you know something about him, will you call me, please?”
‘Ok, let’s go to the car, then.’
To : Greg
'John?'
FROM : Greg
Sherlock flicks open his eyes ‘I’m fine.’
‘Yes, where I have my second home’
‘We’re drunk.’
‘Oh, yes, of course. Brilliant.’
Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me.’
(4:31 pm)
Greg was again rudely interrupted by Sherlock, ‘No, he actually wakes up early in the morning and Skype’s with Mycroft while he runs around the Park.’
“I told you that I came back just to help him for the case...you remember?”
remember little things like that"
‘…He just slept a lot.’
‘This interview will finish tomorrow morning’ John comments, everyone laughs.
Sherlock staggers clumsily while calling a taxi, the man arrives next to him, and they both get in the cab that zips away.
John keeps silent for a while
‘Uh...sort of…’
‘…’ Sherlock sulks, closing his eyes and whispering, ‘Leave me alone.’
‘This is another…thought of me about….you,….about the days you lost writing and thinking, and not caring about nothing else but chemistry’
December’
"Something wrong?"
‘Mary has to work! They’ll be off on their wedding holidays next week.’
‘No, The Lamp & Flag’
TO: SHERLOCK
From : John
TO: John
Sherlock stares at him silently.
Mycroft walks slowly toward the sofa, sitting next to him
Smiling somewhat like a toad, cheeks mauled by thick dimples, Mycroft quietly said, ‘I worry about you… increasingly so.’A muffled noise erupts from the cushioned mass, as Sherlock scoffs. ‘Since John’s back in your life, I thought I’d to come see you.’ Mycroft pauses. The silence is not rewarded. Stretching further, he becomes impatient as he receives no response from the consulting detective. ‘Sherlock, you had to wait. I told you that you must be patient.’This elicits a deep groan from the couch. 'I know you thought John would have come back to Baker Street. Are you terribly disappointed?’
‘He told me Sherlock went to the Johnny Rockets again tonight’
John doesn’t reply for a while, as he clings to the back of him. Silently listening to the steady inhale of his breath and the flutter of his rapid heartbeat.
'Four...'
‘HAHA, ALL RIGHT! LET’S HEAR WHAT BEAUTIFUL MUSIC YOU CAN MAKE TOGETHER!’
FROM: MARY
‘it’s late...come on, everyone go to bed now’ John suggests, a bit annoyed, going toward the car, Greg looks at him, moody.
Greg looks astonished ‘I can’t believe it…’
He goes behind the bar table, then goes toward the wine bar. ‘We should have a toast’
Mrs Hudson couldn’t stop crying every time she glanced over at John in his dapper suit. His face was glowing with joy, and the smile spread across it was gorgeous. Harry promised John to drink only water,and kept her word by spending the day gabbing at Stamford. She continually grilled him for information about Mary. Mike was hard pressed to recall a time when she had spoken to him at such length, but brushed the thoughts aside, as it was John’s day and she was John’s sister. Still, he was elated when it was time for them to take their seats, and find his place near Molly and the others.
John walks faster, uninterested.
‘Well, yes’
“Maybe he’ll feel a little better with you.”
'But we don't know anything about him John!!'
Sherlock is confused and racks his mind palace for reference.
‘Good Morning John!’
‘Who?’ John asks.
‘Why do you think Adair wanted Woodley to kill Moran?’ Tanaka finally hands the letter to Sherlock’s greedy hands.
Omfg, Really?
TO : SH
‘Oh Nothing!!…just your…attitude?’
‘Do you have photos of them in bed, too?’ John asks ironically.
'What did you tell John?'
I didn’t know you could sing, too!! :) lovely performance!! You were cute *__*
Sherlock takes a long breath, then turns page.
John could not believe his luck. The sun shines brightly, as a light mist covets the land. Without an issue, the ceremony commences. The archaic church is adorned with Mary’s favourite flowers. White lilacs hang above the entrance arch. He cannot recall their proper name, but their simplicity is lovely. They stood well with Mary’s elegant dress. The guests are nothing more than few in number, as Mary had lost both parents when she was young. They lost a son when he was three years old and tried to cope with his death after two years, with Mary's birth. Thought she had a few family members attend, her side was mostly filled with friends. Much like John’s own half, which consisted of his immediate family; parents Emma and Hamish, sister Harry. Also, his few friends; Molly, Mike Stamford, Mrs Hudson, Greg and of course-Sherlock. Everyone in his life that mattered, except Mycroft, he was on ‘business’ and couldn’t attend.
Sherlock ends the call without further discussion.
A moment of silence, Victor takes the book from the desk with his left hand rising it up “A season in hell”, this is for next week, and bring me an essay about Rimbaud poem <<Happiness>>”
‘Eggs, bacon, white wine, mustard, olive oil…it’s…fantastic’
Before he could close the minute space between their lips, a man is thumping down the hallway towards them, Sherlock and John’s heads whirl at the sound, it’s Woodley. Without a word, they both start running after him. They follow him through a marked exit door, jumping on a garbage bins and climbing walls in hot pursuit. Until they find themselves in racing through Piccadilly, Woodley glances back at them before disappearing.
‘I’ll send you a message as soon as she gets an answer.’
‘I named it <<The Moody Detective>>, it’s elegant, smooth, witty, sweet and clever, just like you.’ ‘Nice, very nice, indeed’ looking at his moleskine, still sketching.
‘Who?'
‘Well, since Reichenbach you garnered many fans, probably one of- ooohh’ Mrs. Hudson’s exclaims in surprise at the breakfast on the tray. There are multiple; croissants, waffles, strawberries, raspberries, a variety of jams, brioches, pancakes, maple syrup, Nutella, toast, and slices of bread, chocolate biscuits, plain biscuits, cereals, muffins, crépes, yogurt, fruit tarts, and chocolate tarts. There’s also little containers of coffee, espresso, cappuchino, tea, and orange juice. Mrs. Hudson and John look shocked at the array before them.
‘Sherlock! oh God.The groom and the best man wear identical suits!’
‘It’s Pairing pistou, an herb sauce made with fresh basil, with tender spring vegetables makes for a bright-tasting seasonal entrée; the recipe comes from
‘No. Thank you, but I can take care of him.’ Mycroft turns back to the bedroom, intending to leave them and them in return to vacate the flat.
Mrs. Hudson smiles, going away while sipping tea.
‘<<18/10/96 English exam after Bob’s party…>> …Bob’s?’
From : Sherlock
‘You cleaned everything?’ John asks surprised.
(5:03 pm)
‘Good…we found Tanaka, then Woodley, then Moran.’
FROM: SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks away, embarrassed. John stares at him going away, with his hands in the coat pockets. Mary watches the whole scene, and gets closer to John, her hands on his left shoulder. “John” she whispers, kindly.
Molly: ‘Well…I don’t know, we could go anyway….if you want...’
John, looking at Sherlock: ‘You could…you know also write…your thoughts on it..’
‘You know why I’m here..’ Greg walks slowly toward Sherlock, who turns looking at him, sternly.
‘Do you think I don’t know how much you need him too? Do you think I don’t see you when you check your blog, or read your old cases? Hell, you’ve got a picture of the two of you together in your wallet!!!’
Patricia stops him "I'm not here for it, I'm not...a fan..."
‘Neither I’ Sherlock huffs out, protracting his shoulder.
‘Do you like it? It’s your boss’, showing the paper to the dog
"....who?"
Victor smiles back, nervously. “If something happens to me, Molly will give a usb drive with this recording to Lestrade. And then everyone will know you’re the villain. Even John.”
FROM : Mycroft
‘…..And what sensations you had?’
'MYKE, it’s Greg. He’s in trouble; I need you!'
‘What? It’s 11 at night, Greg, what’s wrong with you?’ he mumbles.
‘I don’t care. I won’t stay inside for seven days without doing anything. I need to go on with the case.’
‘Oh, don’t go out of your way, I’ll do it for you’ Sherlock quickly climb the stairs, while Mycroft shouts from the living room ‘I won’t allow you to throw my stuff away!! Can you listen to me Sherlock???’
Gregson ‘Well, I think it’s time to go now, hope to see you soon doctor Watson’ ‘It’s been a pleasure, Inspector’ John smiles while shaking hands with Gregson.
‘Sherlock!’
‘So why are you blaming me for getting married?! You chose her!’
“....I’m ill, Sherlock...” Mycroft whispers, knowing he’s causing pain to his brother. Sherlock looks dejected, confused, shocked
“How you know we argued??” John frowns angrily.
Did you think I'd crumbleeeeeee
‘Okay. Fine. Shall we come there, or will you come see Lestrade here at the Yard?’
"Sherlock, it's not for the tea.."
‘Yes, don’t worry. I’ll sort it out.’
‘Poisoned. Details are on John’s blog’
‘No it’s not!’
Sherlock grunts again from his place in the pillow
This cannot be real
‘because you were having sex with me and you moaned John!! That’s why Sherlock!!’
‘I know Myke! I fucking know it! Sorry! Sorry!’ he shouts, almost crying.
‘Yeah...I know, I’m not that good...’
John cracks an annoyed laugh ‘Would you like to tell me more about him or should I go get my way in it?’
SH 22:51
‘A present?’ Greg looks surprised, and grins back. ‘Why?’ he takes it and turns in over in his hands thoughtfully.
‘Isn’t that movie..??with….Anthony Hopkins??’
‘That one all girls fall in love with’ John adds, ironically
Still looking at each other
‘It’s a bit…..boring in the first part, isn’t it??’ Molly asks
‘look at me’
‘Why you had to work all day?’ Greg asks
FROM: VICTOR
The sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Both glancing over at sleeping Sherlock.
John walks back toward the living room. 'Jesus...'
‘Yes’ Greg replies irritated. ‘John, come on, just for a few minutes…‘
Sherlock suddenly turns, showing to the man the police badge ‘Is this enough???’ John huffs out ‘Oh,...poor Greg...’ The man looks at the badge, then at Sherlock entering in the room number five.
But what it is, is something true
‘What book?’
‘I know. I just said that!’ John answers annoyed. ‘But it has to be exact, We’re giving him an injection, so we have to hit him exactly in the heart’ John points at Sherlock’s chest, Greg looks up at Mycroft with pale face.
"Will you...
Sherlock and a man appear on the doorstep. John looks buffled.
‘I didn’t kill Adair, if that’s what you want to know.’
‘Thank you guys,’ he replies, his smile growing.
have nothing better to do than sit around all day, and gossip about me?'
‘Do you need help?’
Soundtrack:
Anderson ‘wow’
“You know what’s the truth Sherlock? I just surround myself with books, and art, and poetry because I want to escape from myself. I just have to come face to face with the fact that I’m not gifted. I can appreciate art, and I love music, and poetry....but, it’s sad, really,.. because I feel like I have a lot to express and I am not gifted. I’m just a fool who thinks to have some kind of a talent, but I’m just a loser who gets himself into troubles.”
‘Have a good…wedding holiday.’
‘You still have it?’
‘Jesus Christ’ John runs a hand down his face.
‘Sounds more like a bachelor party,’ Molly titers in reply.
John nods ‘ He did it on purpose, he probably will arrange to not even meet me tomorrow. He’s punishing me.’
‘Bonne.’
John see Greg’s person appear outside the tall window, rubbing his fingers together and looking away to the floor of the flat. Standing still in the living room for a while, John’s steps pitter-patter toward the bedroom. He shifts about to place his ear to the door, listening intently as Mycroft’s voice boomed,
‘Sherlock! These are all staff rooms only back here.’
‘Hungry - you?’ John exclaims, eyes wide.
He stops her, grabbing her by the shoulder “Wait, where are you going? are you okay?” he peers at her, frowning confused.
Without hesitation, Sherlock says, ‘Ronald Regan.’
Sherlock ferociously devours a steak. Mycroft loiters about in pajamas next to him, peering at his outfit. Sherlock’s t-shirt reaches his belly, up the navel.
‘Mrs. Hudson!’ John gives her a huge smile, and kisses her on the cheek.
‘So..’ Sherlock, looking at John ‘tomorrow I need to interview some surgeons, I have a new list that’s probably pretty good, I don’t know if you’re busy…if you would like to come with me..’
‘If you don’t come, I won’t go.’
‘Me...and you-in a gay club?’
‘They didn’t come’
From : Greg
TO : GL
(4:37 pm)
John stabs Sherlock in the heart and pumps the adrenaline out through the needle. Sherlock’s head is jolted from the impact.
As he hurriedly pulls the door open, a gust of wind invades the entryway, shaking his curls.
‘Yes, I know’ John smiles ‘Great, we had so much fun, I mean…the place is beautiful, both stunning and sad for the condition in which people live…’
Sherlock looks at him, blushing ‘…a..gift?’
‘Yes, sure he did, he took care of him right after the attack, and he stayed with him during the night. He was so frightened when he arrived in Baker Street. I never saw him like that before. He looked so worried…’
"No, she said they all lie anyway."
TO: JOHN
Lestrade scoffs, saying, ‘I’ll try to find something. You should be resting anyway!’
‘Hmm??’ he asks annoyed.
“I couldn’t drink it..I pretended to drink it...He can’t even make proper tea!"
‘What are you doing here?’ he asks harshly.
‘I have to sleep! Stop listening to music at midnight! I heard such a racket upstairs I don’t know how the neighbors didn’t call the police! Tell Sherlock to stop!’
TO: JOHN
Sherlock “Did you hear them? can you confirm it?"
‘I suddenly have a terrible headache’ Sherlock touches his head for emphasis.
Sherlock changes subject, teasing his brother: ‘Are you going to jump out of the cake tonight? Inspector would be excited’
‘He wasn’t being serious, you know how much he loves to be dramatic.’
Mycroft grabs Sherlock by his dressing gown, angrily. “You can’t leave now just because of John.”
‘Yes, he’s feeling better.’ John replies sternly.
‘you wrote Chemistry symbols and I just songs quotes’
‘Oh Hey! I almost forgot why I called! I found the suit!' A smile breaches the tone of his voice, singing through the phone.
‘LESTRADE!’ Sherlock shouts in annoyance, startling Mrs. Hudson out of her patter.
"Why?...you seem interested"
To: Sherlock
‘Sir, there’s a problem’ The taxi driver looks through the window
‘Yes. Fine.’
John nods. ‘I’m angry.’
Sherlock disdainfully picks up the small purple box, ‘candies, and confetti...lovely.’
Incorrect: You attacked me. You didn’t let me defend myself.
‘Of course’
‘This is Anthea, Mycroft Holmes is busy right now, call him late-‘
‘Always!! Always!! He always did it! Do you remember it?’
He opens the main door entrance.
Sherlock cracks a laugh
‘One of Moriarty’s gang….if this one is half as clever as you, I won’t be bored for a long time’
‘He sent me a message, telling me that Sherlock was going out tonight with somebody.’
Sherlock frowns hearing his brother’s name.
‘Is nine in the evening fine for you?’
We know who shot you in the taxi, we have proofs. Moran's real name is Victor Trevor.
Where the hell are you????
It’s called fame, Sherlock. Your brother is the most famous character in the show, everyone loves him, and he got famous.
‘Anything interesting?’
‘Merely, his name.’ Sherlock smirks at John.
Greg throws the water on Mycroft’s face.
‘No! I’m not, now take the Polaroid and do me more photos’ Sherlock replies quickly, taking the Polaroid on the bed, his sheet almost touching his lower abdomen, and starts making photos at the room
Mrs Hudson adds sugar and aims to leave with her own cup, leaving a spare steaming one for him. She hopes terribly that the heat will draw him away from his mood.
‘If you succeed in doing that, tell me how’ John answers, walking away.
John goes to the index, finds what he’s looking for, quickly scans the lines, and then says, ‘Okay.’
TO: JOHN
‘Ah..okay.’
Greg turns his chair toward the TV ‘I can’t believe it.'
Sarah’s mother starts crying again, Melanie comforts her, stroking her gently “Mom, don’t worry, we’ll find her, mr. Holmes is a great man and he’ll find her soon, don’t worry” looking at Sherlock, who smile slights, then looks away, worried. “How she was dressed the last time you saw her?"
‘So why does he spy on him?’
The car slowly stops next to Molly’s house
‘Yes, I’m fine’
She startles, noticing Greg getting closer “I—I should....Greg, I have to go now...sorry”.
John wraps his arms tighter.
‘What do you mean?’
Sherlock smiles proudly. ‘I know. It’s my job.'
JOHN :Oh God, Jane, I’m so sorry for what happened, I’m devastated.
Mary and John are setting the table.
Greg switches on the car and slowly turns toward the right, parking. They get out and walk the opposite side of the pub street, then cross the street.
John turns ‘No, of course…I won’t.’
John sneaks a peek at Sherlock, but he’s already chatting on his phone.
“They were wrong. I know you. I know who you are. You would never do that to me. Never." Victor smiles, suddenly looking more relaxed and cheerful “That’s all I wanted to hear” He slowly kisses Sherlock, biting his lips while looking into his eyes, then suddenly laughs.
TO: JOHN
Suddenly Sherlock grabs John’s shirt, hugging him tightly, bursting into tears.
"I know there's a tv show tonight on tv about Sherlock Holmes-"
John storms into the department.
‘I’ve never done this before!’
‘Are you missing John?’
‘I don’t know. He didn’t tell me!’ James harped at Sherlock.
Sherlock, smiling ‘To a music concert’.
Mrs. Hudson continues talking, but Sherlock doesn’t hear a word she says. He’s too preoccupied, staring at the laptop screen:
‘Sherlock!’  He looks at the taxi-driver ‘Sorry…’ and runs off after Sherlock.
Sherlock gets closer to Victor, slowly putting his arms around him again, smiling. “Everything’s gonna be alright” he whispers. “I promise you”
‘Sherlock, please, just..go away now, we’ll come back-‘
‘Boring’
John realizes himself, astonished. As his mouth widens, wordless and gaping, Mycroft answers, ‘Your t-shirt, John, the one you made.’
‘Why?’
‘Why are you looking at me?’  he asks, sternly gazing at the pair.
Then he sends a message to Sherlock
“I’m...sorry,...we didn’t know it,...thank you for your help Mr. Buckley"
“I know. I am the master of tea.”
Again, silence reigns.
‘Put them on Twitter’
Greg grins, turning away from Mycroft. His soles tap loudly against the cement, as he wonders down the street. He calls back over his shoulder, idly, ‘Well, then try to stay away from him.’
‘Don’t shout at me! Don’t shout at me, okay? It just makes me more nervous, and I’m already nervous, I don’t need it!’
‘Anta-na-na-rivo!’
‘HE WAS IN BED WITH SHERLOCK AND HE LEFT AND YOU SAID NOTHING TO HIM???????????’ Turning more angry than before
John runs up to 221b, and rings the doorbell.
"Have you watched the Sherlock tv show?" Sherlock asks, curiously.
‘Where are you going?’
John frowns “..why? What happened?”
‘He’ll end up killing me.’ Mycroft lowly confirms, snorting.
‘Never heard of it.’
The man’s eyes widen, as he realizes what John truly means. He tries queries, ‘Are you accusing me of what happened to-’
‘Since I’ve been back I’ve listened to your complaints for months!’ His voice explodes, booming, ‘Just because I save your life - I was never able to say anything!’ He paces, unable to remain still, ‘It’s like I did everything on purpose to fake my death and be away two yea-’
Sherlock starts crying, shaking.
‘Seraphita! Tanaka sent me a mes-‘
‘Our room’ Sherlock comments, surprised, smiling, touching the polaroid with his left fingers, he looks at it for a bit, thinking.
John looks at him, calm, enjoying the account.
“But I didn’t keep the promise. I involved myself again into Sherlock’s life, and it was a mistake. Now I learnt the lesson..but please, Greg, don’t try getting me involved in this stuff again, because it’s over. Me and Sherlock, over..I won’t help him anymore, I won’t write about the cases anymore, or- oh, right, I just remembered I have to close the blog.”
‘Oh, I insist’
Greg throws the phone onto the passenger seat, and drives faster toward Baker Street. He parks the car on the sidewalk, and takes the stairs two at a time. When he tumbles into 221b, he sees John crouched over Sherlock, holding him in the recovery position. Greg puts his hands on his head in shock, ‘Oh my fucking god.’
‘YES!!!’
To : John
‘I don’t know…maybe to cook it to your lover, one day’ He smiles, looking at him.
‘Not had the chance, actually, I got shot’ He replies ironically
‘At the Lamp & Flag?’
Sherlock goes toward the sofa, taking his scarf, ignoring Mrs. Hudson, just answering to Greg ‘Just go on the history event and you’ll read all the passages the program did’
“By drugging me?”
Sherlock lighted his cigarette and turned his gaze outside while he slowly exhaled the first cloud of smoke into the air.
He did his best not to dig deeper into those feelings as it could only lead to misery in the end and when he was with Sherlock, had his agile body pressed against his own, when he buried his cock inside of him, had his tongue trailing patterns across that pale smooth skin, staring into those eyes that seemed to change colour according to light or kissed his luscious lips, it was easy to just enjoy the moment, give himself into what he had right now and not think of the consequences.
“I have no idea what a Corry is but no doubt is something exceedingly dull and not worthy of my concern.”
“But I don’t understand, what’s ailing him? He was perfectly fine the last time I saw him!”
The thing Sherlock was now about to do would definitely fall under the category of not acceptable in John’s book. But as he and Mycroft had so adamantly insisted that he take this case, they would be forced to realise that Sherlock had his own way of doing things. That was after all why he was so successful at what he did.
Sending a text when you eagerly awaited the reply was also a thing Mycroft didn’t like. It kept things hanging in the air with an anticipation he didn’t appreciate, as it made him feel powerless. There was no way he could force anyone to respond, they either did or they didn’t and that was that.  So all he could really do was to wait for something he had no idea if he was ever going to get.
won’t be able to help, he is far too experienced to get caught. This isn’t one of Sherlock’s little puzzles where his loyal Detective Inspector merrily follows his lead and everything turns out dandy in the end.”
And the reason for this whole arrangement still felt a bit unclear, despite the vague details Mycroft had offered him as a way of explanation.
“Depending on the kind of information you have, a generous amount, sufficiently for you to quit your job and leave tomorrow if you wanted to start fresh somewhere else and forget that you ever heard the name Holmes.”
The man’s lips were beginning to turn blue while his whole body trembled and swiftly John took one of the slender wrists in his hand to feel for a pulse. It was slightly elevated if not dangerously so and while John still felt unsure of what this situation actually was all about, he automatically switched to his medical persona and began performing CPR.
John couldn’t help but laugh at this as he turned his head to look at Sherlock who had risen from the bed and was standing by the window, his dressing gown back on, fingers drumming restlessly against the glass.
Stick to the truth as much as possible, Sherlock had said last night and despite how much it pained John to admit this, he reluctantly agreed that he had not performed his duties properly.
One pull of a trigger and gone he was.
Tiredly John slumps down on the motel bed and begins to undress. He is still wearing the same clothes he chose the morning Mycroft came to tell him about the abduction.
hard time holding in his snickers and Loki had followed Tony’s example, “Hell! There was a fucking
look dead to you?!” John tried to hold in his laughs, Tony didn’t and was practically rolling on the floor, “Do you even look at the internet? Or the  motherfucking  paper?!” Sherlock smirked as he listened while his boyfriend was having a
“Yes, Mother,” Thor stated.
“That’s what you’ve called it, yes,” John stated, “Unlike my brother, I’ve never felt the undying need to name my weapon,” Loki yelped as John pulled his hair with the comb, “Hold still.”
Frigga smiled, “How long do you suppose they’ll be gone?” she asked.
Thor went wide eyed, “But, Uncle-”
Loki. Who was being
Thor groaned, “Yes, Uncle…” he forced himself up.
John looked at Sherlock, “You alright, Sherlock?” he asked, “I know you don’t like flying.”
Thor opened his mouth, “And it’s safe to assume they were
Sherlock sighed and sat in his chair, “I’m sorry, Frigga,” John stated, “We got a little…sidetracked,” he rubbed the back of his head.
“Wasn’t planning on it,” Sherlock stated.
been trying to hit your brother with your hammer since you got it,” John stated.
“Obviously,” John deadpanned, “How many times do you think I had to fake my own death or disappear off the face of the Earth?”
Thor went wide eyed but didn’t move within the timeframe given. All of the Avengers were suddenly on the rooftop. Thor gulped, “Hello…Uncle,” Thor stared.
“Sherlock, away from the edge of the building,” John said without moving his eyes away from his nephew, “You’re not allowed to jump off the edge again.”
“I could possibly ask Frigga to ask Heimdall about him when she comes to see her sons tomorrow,” John stated, “And yes, she will be taking the Tesseract with her.”
“Is this about that woman you met when Father banished you?” Loki asked.
John chuckled and was smiling, “You’re sweet,” he stated, “But, had I taken the throne, we would not have met, no?”
“Because Romanoff and Barton had a mission there,” Greg stated, “Apparently the building you blew up was right next to where their mission was.”
where you could
“Err…may I question why?” Sherlock asked.
John turned and grabbed Loki, “Sherlock, we’re going home,” he said as he carried his mentally abused nephew.
“What do you think Coulson’s chances are?” Tony asked.
did nothing,” he stated, “Am I clear?”
A loud shriek rang throughout the building causing Sherlock and John to wince. Mrs. Hudson just went out to get the paper. Probably in just her housecoat. They suddenly heard running, “Oh…fuck!” John all but threw the comforter off him, “Thor! It’s not a danger!” John’s phone fell forgotten on the floor, “Thor!”
Fury nodded, “Honestly,” Sherlock stated, “I don’t think I can ever be more than 85% on anything with Moriarty. Just as I faked my death, he could’ve faked his suicide and let me dismantle his Network so he could rebuild it better and stronger. Moriarty is my equal in everything, but morals. And I only really got a firm hold on those when John came barging into my life.”
Thor looked at the window. He grabbed a piece of glass and made a confused face. John continued to cut Loki’s hair. Finally, after ten minutes, “Sherlock, would you please show my nephew what glue is,” Thor paused in attempting to put two pieces of glass together.
“Oh, she showed up about five minutes after you four went rushing out the door,” Mrs. Hudson supplied before standing up and walking into the kitchen, “And Sherlock! What have I said about heads in my building!”
Loki hummed, “Still not sure where I went,” he admitted, “The last thing I remember is being mad at Father and honestly most of that being thrown at you because he went into Odinsleep.”
“Traitors,” Sherlock mumbled while John sighed.
“And I do hope, for your sake, they have the Tesseract with them, Nephew,” John stated.
“Tea, Boys?” Mrs. Hudson came into the flat, smiling.
“Nothing,” John smirked at him.
Sherlock was silent, “No, I think you covered everything,” he stated, “While I would prefer to stay in London, I’d rather not be watched from the sky or something worse than Mycroft.”
Loki rolled his eyes but flicked his wrist and the window was like it was before Thor came barreling in, “Thank you!” Thor grinned.
“John said I had to stop with the acid experiments,” Sherlock said calmly, “And as I’ve told everyone who asks, where else would I preserve it?”
Frigga nodded, “I will question him,” she took the cube, “Take care, Vé,” she used the cube to return to Asgard.
Loki just nodded, “I’m afraid to ask what kind of friends my brother has made,” he stated.
Loki chuckled, “I think I actually like this one, Uncle,” he stated.
“Explain what you can,” Mycroft stated.
. He glared and crossed his arms, “Where’s your brother, Thor?” he questioned.
Thor walked out with Natasha beside him, “Sorry, Uncle…” he said.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, “Perhaps when I’m more awake, I will find this information more useful,” he stated, “But Fury had a list-”
Mrs. Hudson smiled, “Oh, Sherlock had found something of interest in the paper and took off,” she stated, taking a seat on the couch, “John rushed out after him, yelling that you would be arriving soon and that they didn’t have time,” Mrs. Hudson chuckled, “Thor hurried soon after yelling something about battle and Loki ran after
John went wide eyed and sat bolt up. Sherlock lifted his pillow slightly, staring at his boyfriend sleepily, “John?” he yawned.
Thor pouted, “So mean, Brother,” Thor sat in his uncle’s chair.
John groaned as ringing filled the room. Sherlock grunted beside him, pulling himself away from his boyfriend, “Your phone,” he mumbled, pulling his pillow over his head.
Frigga nodded and walked away.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock stated, “Just do your little teleport thing for the way back,” he looked down at the file in John’s hands, “How bad?” John showed Sherlock the file.
John hummed and nodded, “I’m going to need to do magic,” he stated, closing the file, “Now, be honest with me, Sherlock-”
“Oh, right,” John snorted, “Good luck getting another Molly Hooper in New York.”
“What happens now?” Fury asked.
John stood up and sat back in his seat. Fury stormed back in, “Didn’t even know of Moriarty,” he muttered before stopped beside them, “Are you certain this man is dead?”
“I believe so,” Mrs. Hudson smiled, “Sherlock has always been more in tuned to John and what he needs.”
“But-” John sent a look at his nephew, “Yes Uncle…”
“I’ll explain later,” John stated, “And welcome to how everyone else feels, Love.”
“I should be going,” Frigga stated, “Very nice to meet you two,” she looked at Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson.
“Greg…” John said warningly, “This better not be some sort of-” a loud, angry, horn sounded right by their window, causing Sherlock to sit bolt up and stare at the curtain closed window, “Oh…how the ever-living bloody hell?!” John exclaimed as he magically swung the curtains open revealing a wide awake New York City…at midnight their time.
sides. Except for Hitler and his Nazis. All of them could gladly rot in a hole.”
“Yes, Uncle,” Thor said.
Sherlock to leave the city he has mapped out completely in his head, recreate his Homeless Network in New York,  accommodate his Homeless Network
Sherlock hummed, “I’m surprised they’ve been able to save him to begin with,” he stated.
“Would you want to come?” John snapped.
John and Sherlock arrived back at Baker Street. John gently set Loki on the couch, “I have several questions,” Sherlock stated.
“Get your asses up here!” Vé yelled, “You have three seconds!”
Sherlock watched as Steve and Clint paced back and forth. Sherlock, along with Tony, were waiting for them to collide. They almost did multiple times. Bruce was sitting in a chair, fidgeting with the long sleeves of the sweater he wore and Thor and Natasha stood by a wall talking softly. Sherlock looked at Tony as he cleared his throat. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, “Yes?” he asked.
Vé was John Watson. And he was
“Blue,” Natasha stated, “They were a bright, glowing, blue.”
Greg paused in the doorway before turning to the room, “Somebody tell Fury I told and warned him of Sherlock’s vindictive side,” he stated, “Be glad he didn’t have Dr. Watson on his side,” with that said, Greg left.
“THOR AND LOKI ODINSON!” a voice echoed across all of New York and everything became dead silent.
Frigga hummed, smiling, “Always important in a relationship,” she stated, “How long have they been courting?”
John sighed while Sherlock’s head dropped, “…My job at the clinic?” John questioned.
Sherlock hummed, “I read somewhere that blood could be used as a substitute for eggs,” half the Agents paled while the other half turned green, “Quite a success if I do say so myself,” Sherlock smirked wider as several Agents ran for the door while others just lost their blood-cakes on the floor.
“I know,” Frigga stood up, walking over to Loki, “How are you doing, dear?”
John moved his hands around Loki’s head, “Odin is the youngest,” John stated, “Vili was the oldest and was to take the throne from our father. I was the second born, but I never held any interest in the throne.”
There was only a limited amount of people who knew him as Dr Watson and at the mention of him taking time off his normal job to tend to his other duties the answer came to him straight away.
He nodded and cradled Sherlock’s face between his hands.
“Your employer wants to meet you. Come with me.”’
Whenever Victor was deprived of Sherlock’s company, he turned slightly hysterical and unruly, making all kinds of demands that Mycroft had to bite himself in the tongue not to acerbically reply to.
Someone like a P.A.
But in essence, John was everything he had ever wanted and even the idea of not having him by his side anymore was unthinkable, making his stomach tighten nervously when he considered that this situation somehow could result in John leaving him. There were so many "ifs" and "should-haves" he normally never bothered with but now suddenly meant a difference as they could ensure that he would end up alone, without John’s love and affection, something that he, like an addict, actually craved nowadays.
“I wasn’t the one to initiate this meeting, Mr Magnussen. I came here under the pretence that you had something you wanted to talk to me about and now you’re acting like I was the one.....that I have some ulterior motive for being here....”
Mycroft sighs.
But then there was the click of a switch being turned on and one single source of light appeared over their heads, enough to illuminate what the room consisted of and John drew a sharp breath in shock.
“Such a temper, Dr Watson. I really think you would benefit from sitting down, it is a comfortable chair and the tea is an exquisite blend of Lapsang Souchong…”
It was like receiving a blow to the gut to look down at the name, so final, no more chances of anything else, just this. A quiet gravesite with a cold black headstone, nothing more.
This had immediately irritated Sherlock and swiftly he pushed himself from his leaning position by the door, cold annoyance evident in his eyes now.
But this time John has the advantage of being one step ahead and he is coming prepared.
A quick look at the time on his mobile phone told him that it was a quarter past midnight.
Mycroft would certainly not approve but right now, did it matter?
“Why?”
With Mycroft’s decidedly dashing younger brother as bait, they were going to gain access to Magnussen’s private chambers, find the source of all his knowledge and power in the form of a vault he supposedly had in his home, a vault where he kept everything incriminating that he had on other people to use as blackmail against them. And when finding this vault, they were going to destroy it.
Sherlock turned his head to look at John closely now.
And that had been the end of the discussion about Sherlock’s bedroom.
“....well let just say it’s difficult finding the perfect one amongst all those idiots walking the streets. And London is stressful as it is for an Irish girl like me who comes from a small town on the countryside. No one here wants to settle down, always looking for a better option.”
“No, but it most certainly was your fault that it happened in a courtyard where no one was even aware of your presence. Had it been in our garden at home things would not have turned so dramatic, people would have been able to help you out quicker. Did you know that if that doctor fellow hadn’t happened to come by when he did and acted so quickly, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation because you would be lying on a slab in the morgue right now!”
It didn’t matter, he could see actual relief flood John’s eyes, although not completely happy with events. He chided Sherlock for putting himself in such a position in the first place, especially considering his knowledge of Magnussen and what sort of a man he was. But all and all the situation was more manageable now, John’s mood easily reverted back to a calmer state when that he knew Sherlock hadn’t done anything exceptionally foolish.
“To Sherlock and Victor! May your marriage prove to be as exciting as your courtship has been for us all to witness.”
No trace of Sherlock, unless he was waiting for them in the room they were about to enter. But it was beginning to look like they had been following a dead lead and his heart slumped a little at that.
It was humiliating to consider how positively smitten he had been, how utterly blind, and whenever that realisation hit him, he wanted to squirm from embarrassment, pound his head against the wall and scream in frustration.
Sherlock softly pressed his lips to his mouth and John allowed happiness to wash over him as the kiss deepened and their bodies eagerly pressed against each other, hands tearing at garments and buttons coming undone.
He sighed but then steeled himself.
With a frown of confusion, John shook his head.
“Of course I know who you are talking about, I’m not as hung over as some others that come to mind at the moment. Too many glasses of Champagne to stave of the boredom?”
He could feel his skin crawl from the realisation that the hand holding the gun had rummaged through his stuff, deliberately or by accident stumbled upon the weapon and then taken it without his knowledge. When had this happened? When was the last time he had actually seen the gun still tucked away under his mattress? How could he allowed himself to have been so careless?
That part about someone else being charge of another person’s medical care sounded a bit unorthodox and for a second John contemplated asking if there was something in the patient’s medical history that warranted that his brother and future husband were the ones making the decisions. The young man had certainly been of age so why were others micromanaging his life?
But there was something worrying in the eyes peering over the titanium rim of his  glasses, a glint of something on edge and for a second Mycroft wondered if he had perhaps been too late with his plan to shackle Magnussen, maybe the man had already managed to find something to use against him and his colleagues and last night had simply been a waste of his time, a fruitless game that had held no consequences for the actions to come.
In that particular way where he more or less vivisected a person with his scrutinizing gaze, Sherlock looked at John and then sighed and closed his eyes as if the sight was too much to deal with right now.
I said what I did to you that night because I thought it would be easier for both of us if I pushed you away, if I bruised your ego so badly that you wouldn’t want to stay and continue to expose yourself to a situation that was beginning to be far too complicated for everyone involved.
This time he allowed it though.
As the small talk around the table silenced a bit, Magnussen rose from his chair and turned towards his guests and addressed them with that smooth voice he had with the slight Scandinavian accent, looking out across the room through his steel-rimmed spectacles like he was giving each and everyone a close inspection.
“Why does it matter? You made it clear this morning that my actions were not up to your standard. So I decided to focus on my own personal and far more interesting investigation instead.”
“Keep telling yourself that and one day you might believably be able to convince yourself that it’s actually true,” he murmured.
Slowly he turned to walk back to the barrack, but he didn’t make it very far before something hard suddenly pressed against his shoulder blades and he froze mid-step.
problem to solve. Lie in the bed of your own making, little brother, he thought grimly.
This was unexpected, a visit arranged without his knowledge.
Then he raised it and slammed it down again, even more forcefully this time, creating another tear, ripping the entire figure apart.
He actually looked relaxed for once. Normally there was always this feeling of pent-up energy radiating from him, even straight after sex, a restlessness that sometimes worried John a bit.
“So you broke it off. And then what?” he asked instead, doing his best  to sound calm and composed despite feeling anything but, at the moment.
He had made a mistake in thinking a person living with his brother would be able to help Mycroft keep an eye on him. It has been a costly lesson to learn and he will not be making the same error again.
A glint of something that almost looked like surprise crossed Sherlock’s features, as if he had not expected John’s loyalty. But it was quickly gone again and then he was back to looking nonchalant and rose hastily from the chair.
Now that John knew the story of Sherlock’s connection to Magnussen, he could see it clearly for what it was – a blatant display of power to flaunt in the faces of those who knew what the painting really depicted.
“...apparently Sherlock Holmes can be a bit of a busy-body....” He heard Magnussen say in the background and it split his attention for a second.
Victor was a loose cannon even under normal circumstances and probably even more so right now, John was not prepared to face the impact of that temper yet again if he could avoid it.
As they reached Mr Rudd’s office, the man grumpily showed him inside and then pointed at an old-fashioned landline telephone situated on his desk.
“Jeremy Marcus, former MI6 agent recruiter, previously working mainly with those stationed in Northern Africa but....well, circumstances led to him being called home and redirected to work for MI5 instead a few years ago. He worked mainly with recruiting new agents, wetting them and so forth and I have employed his services on numerous occasions during the years. Always impeccably competent and incredibly talented at his task. So naturally I also chose him whenever I needed to recruit people handling the surveillance of my brother. And up until now I have never had any reason to complain.”
“I believe it’s time to get seated,” Magnussen said and began to walk towards the door. “Please follow me and I’ll show you to the dining room.”
“Well, he said you were very reckless and often got yourself into a lot of trouble. Besides, when he and I had our little meeting we were both still under the illusion that you were in hospital on account of anaphylactic shock from a wasp sting. Since you won’t tell me the actual reason for your health scare yesterday I can’t tell you if the true circumstances are better or worse. For me as your physician it’s certainly worse to not know what caused that reaction.”
Considering the cheetah and the baboon in the park outside the house, this was likely of a similar category. Exotic and lethal, probably poisonous. And that idea, joint with the fact that he was tied up to a bed with no way of defending himself, was what sent chills down his spine.
Mycroft was a man used to stressful situations of all kinds, in his line of profession he more or less needed to be. Foolish politicians, testy bureaucrats, tyrannical leaders and people with more power than common sense, individuals that could test a person’s patience to the limit.
It took almost 40 seconds before Victor spoke again.
No. No more of this, John was done with it all.
‘Really?!’
"The fans and the press are outside, they want to see the real superhero tonight." John smiles, ironically. Sherlock pretends not to look at him, hiding his smile, reading the newspaper. John continues: "They tried to get in and interview Mrs. Hudson but she slammed the door."
TO: SHERLOCK
Sherlock doesn’t move much in the tub except when his brother moves his body’s parts to clean them. Mycroft opens the hot water and rinses Sherlock’s hair before pressing the curls to remove the excess water. He tears a hung bathrobe from the back of the bathroom door.
Where the hell are you?
‘No! that’s the point, he just answered me 2 minutes before’
Drops of tears are falling on the paper, Sherlock whispers with his voice trembling, shaking. ‘I needed you and you never noticed it.’
Molly finds Sherlock sitting on a bench all alone. He has the little favor box with confetti and candies in his hands.
‘Why? Were you busy doing something else?’
‘I must go now, love, see you later, okay?’
They walk left, and notice a propped open exit door of the pub. Simultaneously, they stride toward the door.
‘I know. You disassembled the whole room in your quest.’
‘No! You left me! I would have followed you through that damn building if only I had known…’ John’s voice cracks nervously. Sherlock looks at John, who’s now bent over him, and cannot bring himself to respond.
‘I’m not here to dance, get drunk and hook up. Do you understand?’
‘Sherlock! That tickles! Come on, stop.’ Though John’s still laughing.
‘Both’
And I'll survive
‘Lestrade?’
Greg stands up, taking his jacket from the chair ‘Ok, I’m letting you in, but don’t go off on your own, clear?'
‘Yes, sure, come on in.’
John walks up the stairs while Mrs. Hudson answers him.
‘That he’s a friend of Sherlock,’ John replies confused.
From: John
FROM: JOHN
Do you know what I said to him? Fuck you! Fuck you! You’re so full of yourself - not me!’
Biscuits.
“You must go away, and never come back again. I’ll give you the privilege to not be guilted for what you’ve done. But you don’t have to kill Sherlock, and you must go away from here. Far, far away. And never come back again.” Victor stands up, taking his phone. “Do what I told you...if you want to save your life.”
“Neither with....other jobs...I could...work as collaborator."
‘Oh, okay’
‘No, I can’t’
What?
‘Jack the tiger.’ Sherlock incoherently mumbles to himself.
‘AND YOUR ADORABLE PARTNER HERE, WHAT’S HIS NAME?’
‘Who the hell are you?’
‘Oh my God, he’s agreeing to spend his first wedding night with me and Sherlock in a gay club.’ Greg says in utter disbelief.
‘Hello!’ She beams at him.
‘Always Dorset…’
‘I brought you fresh clothes, Honey,’ she says quietly to John.
‘You can’t think that just an SMS could break them up!’
‘…Stoyte,….who wants to live forever’ looking at Sherlock ‘and he’s constantly ruled by his fears, the biggest trouble of our society’
‘I can’t call him now, I’m sor-‘
‘No, I have to work’
‘Johnny Rockets, it’s a 50’s American Diner, with posters of old movie stars. It’s a typical American pub, but they have waiters dressed as movie characters and they serve hamburgers, steaks, and salads….you know, the usual.’
The curtains are half closed, and only a little ray of sunshine lights up the room, giving the room different shadows on the floor. Baker Street is cold and dark.
How's the room?
Greg is reading the newspaper, standing near the table, his legs crossed. Mrs Hudson enters in the living room. “Since Mycroft moved here this flat is so....tidy!"
‘He was scared, and probably got a call.’
Sherlock raises his head and see Victor’s students walking toward him, followed by Greg, John and Mrs. Hudson, that form a circle around Victor’s grave. His students hug each other, crying, some of them leave books and poems next to the grave and lighting candles. A group of them go toward Sherlock to offer condolences, but he keeps staring at Mary with a cold and impassive look. She pretends not to see him, and looks away, but every time she turns, Sherlock is staring at her, with the same blank look in his eyes. While everyone goes to Sherlock, Mary slowly steps back, slowly walking away, but Greg stops her “Mary!”
‘Because you never told me you didn’t want me to get married with Mary!’
‘Mmmmm….bicycle ride?’
‘Oh my god, NO!’ John comments. Everyone starts laughing, and John just sits there embarrassed.
‘yes, we had good news’
‘Come oooon, I’m joking’ smiling, keeping him closer with the left hand.
Greg points at the bedroom with a small hint with his head
‘Okay’
John sighs, and flops down into a chair. His fingers nervously fidgeting.
‘A message Adair gave you, because he knew you would have come to see him.  He probably knew someone was out to kill him. So he’d leave a message to help you understand what’s was going on. But it must be hidden, a code perhaps? Something you don’t know the meaning of? He was no doubt afraid that this third party was going to try and kill him. In that event, he needed his assailants information to be available to you, but hidden from everyone else. However, you couldn’t decode it, and now you are the one in fear. Afraid that another knows of this message. That’s why you’re working here. Why you suddenly left your job as a carpenter and are currently assisting at your friend’s bar, and kipping at his place as well. No one else knows you’re here, except them, obviously'  He makes a quick flip of his hand in the direction of the blonde waitress. 'Of course, you’ll be at her place this evening.’
Victor laughs.
‘Me?’ Sherlock cracks a nervous laugh ‘Hiding what? That I watched a movie?’
Mycroft disconnects the plug, then huffs out, taking a long breath.
‘I’m hungry.’
‘Are you tired?’ he leans forward to kiss Sherlock’s neck.
Mycroft tries to mumble some words ‘I...’ He takes the paper, putting it on the bed, grabbing Sherlock, who looks down, not facing his brother. ‘I just wanted to take care of you....’ He whispers, angrily. Mycroft tries to hold back the tears ‘I didn’t know what to do...I lost her too, Sherlock...it wasn’t easy for me. Why don’t you understand it?? It wasn’t easy to not make you feel her absence...I wasn’t good, I know. I’ve never been, I thought that controlling you was the best way to raise you...I made mistakes, I didn’t know what to do...I was scared just like you but I couldn’t show it because I had to be with you and make you feel that everything was alright, but I know it wasn’t..I know it and I'm sorry’
Victor laughs, getting closer to Sherlock, hugging and kissing him, both lying on the wool blanket.
"...wh--what? why?"
‘Wait, what…Sherlock? John told me you’re his best man, how on earth did you forget when it’s going to happen?’
‘...He’s never been friendly, so we took a single room for him. At the beginning he seemed shy and introvert with the studies...he didn’t like professors, he didn’t like how they taught,...and it was hard for father and me to look after him, I already took a role for the Government, started to get my way in it......I knew the Trevor family, Victor’s father was an important police chief who worked for the French Government, they left France because he was undertaken by the British Government for an important case that year, so he brought his son to Oxford. Sherlock needed somebody who could look after him, and Victor seemed to be the perfect guy for him, or at least, at the beginning. So I sent him to Sherlock, who changed room and took a double one with Victor. Later I discovered that they had already met at the park, that Sherlock got an accident with Victor’s dog,...that’s why when I first introduced Victor to my brother he didn't react well, but then they started to get on well together. Victor seemed to be perfect for my brother, they shared the same hobbies, he could cope with Sherlock’s bad moods and knew how to cheer him up. But soon after their friendship became something....different. I met Victor’s father who told me they were......not just ‘friends’, and I suddenly understood everything. I didn’t mind, at the beginning,...Victor was a kind guy, romantic and rebel,..but their pair soon became dangerous. Victor liked to make scene, despite his good marks at the exams he was pestiferous, and Sherlock followed him. I remember how many times the University faculty called me,..I lost count. They started making the college life, drugs...parties...Victor was used to it, but not Sherlock, and he started to get lost in it, getting a drugs addiction,...and he seemed not to be able to stop. His vices worsened their relationship...and one day something bad happened.’
‘No, I...I can’t find him, he disappeared. It’s been two days now, his family is worried and I saw him three days ago after university, we had to study together, then he called me saying he had to do a thing and couldn’t come, I called the day after but he didn’t answer. He didn’t attend class yesterday, so I sent him a message on whatsapp but he didn’t answer again. Then I saw a post on facebook of his sister that he was lost and he didn’t come back home. I was shocked, I didn’t know what to do, I thought you knew something about it’
‘Sherlock’ worried, with a baffled look on her face  ‘I ran here because a man told me my house had been attacked!??’
"Patricia,...Daniel's mother."
Silence arises between the pair.
‘You want to take pics on me under the sheets, then?’
Sherlock stands still, looking at him, ‘You’ve already bought it!’
‘You bought a camera every month’
‘I don’t know, let’s ask’ Sherlock calls the waitress, who stops at their table, enlisting all the desserts
(4:53 pm)
Victor keeps his eyes off the screen, looking at Sherlock ‘Wow, interesting’
‘Greg, I don’t really talk to Sherlock … I….I’ve never really had a talk with him since we came back together, I saw him at St James’s Park the morning before going away and he was completely insane with me….he….it was like he blew off steam he had had inside for so long…..’ ‘…..I didn’t know he could be so affected…. he was right, I didn’t really see……we just kept spying on him and then stayed with him the day after as nothing happened, it’s not right, that’s not how….a friendship works…’
'Victor??'
‘oh god, yes’ ‘ahhhhhh what a great shag, sherlock’
‘Sherlock…can you hear me?’
There’s been a break in into your house. Alarm System is on.
‘Now you parade around with your new life, happy like nothing else matters – nothing, not me.’ He wails, arms wide and expression dramatically sullen, ‘That I had to change, that I had to accept everything that came after - your wedding, your wife, your absence and your excuses when you walk away.’ Sherlock points at John, viciously repeating the action, ‘Look at you - just for once! Why don’t you think over what you’ve done? What you’ve done to me?’
‘It will take hours’
Greg huffs out, ‘Yeah…that. It’s me,’ and is finally granted passage inside.
‘Yes?’
‘Nuit.’
‘Is the therapy making you feel better?’
‘These are the marriage’s effects!’ Molly, smiling
John turns angry, rising his voice more ‘Oh sorry Sherlock if I moved on and didn’t wait for you!’
‘What? About what?’
‘In theory, you should give me the agenda, Sherlock. It’s an evidence.’
JL : That was Greg! He asked about you, how did he know you were here?
News??
‘Nothing…’
You are famous! It got 24 likes and 15 shares in 4 minutes.
“I know” he replies, in a soft voice.
Sherlock blushes at the website, his heart throbbing.
‘Sherlock too?’ Greg questions, John silently watches the scene unfold. They both go toward a building, the man opens the gate then walk towards the door, Sherlock walks slowly, mumbling words, then leans against the main entrance door, gesticulating and talking, the man next to him smiles and opens the door, he comes inside. Sherlock follows him and closes the door behind him.
‘Yes, you know we could talk about her, just…do you want to come over?’
‘I don’t know, you could give me some tips since you’re so good at getting informations, despite the fact that I don’t spy on people.’
Mary snorts ‘You are telling us that you refused one hundred thousand pounds for some info about Sherlock?’
Sherlock looks, but does not open it.
Greg turns back, and starts walking ‘Come on, let’s have a look at the other side of the pub.’
‘Yeah….the flower, do you remember it?'
‘I’ll see you later, okay? I’ll call you’
“I know but..he puts so much efforts and...excitement to prepare it..”
‘I know. I understand…don’t worry, you don’t have to…apologize.’
‘And…..did you….suddenly got a love for the movie and watched it alone at the movies?’
Sherlock looks at the man deeply with his hands crossed on his chin.
TO : Greg
‘No. Change of plans.’
‘That every killer out there is a your fans?’ John says with a grin.
‘Yes…’ Sherlock whispers, looking at the polaroid ‘It’s beautiful…and sad, gloomy in some way, …even if those were hard days for me….they had their beauty …’
Greg “she’s...away?"
Are you watching the news?
Victor laughs ‘I’m joking, don’t get angry.’
‘Of course you do and don’t raise your voice to me!’
John takes a huge gasp “Probably I should...stay with him.” He peers at Greg, to see a reaction “It’s not a good moment for him...Mycroft,..and Victor...I’m worried he could do something dangerous..”
John silently stares, fixated.
‘He booked this room yesterday’
‘What did I have to tell him?!?!!’
John enters the supermarket heading straight for the milk case, once he finds a suitable fresh carton. He goes off in search of the biscuits section; he scans the shelves and finds an array of diabetic biscuits, oat biscuits, rice biscuits, but no chocolate. He pops his head up and searches for an assistant. A lovely worker catches his eye ‘Do you need help sir?’ she asks, smiling at John.
