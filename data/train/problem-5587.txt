“That would be wonderful,” Sam called as they headed into the brushes. Clint shook his head and continued his washing.
Tony patted him on the back with a smile. “Yes. I must take them to the work shop for some basic repairs before I start on the house.”
Tony shrugged. "Let's head to town, wash the blood from our bodies and talk about, your other half."
The monster made several inhuman grunts and growls and to Tony’s horror was laughing. “Thanks.” It said. The earth warped and shifted and Bruce stood looking around dazed before his eyes rolled back in his head and Thor caught him as he fainted again. Tony shifted and Steve with him. They stood taking stock. There were a lot dead. Some rightfully pretending to be dead.
Steve was lost. He stood outside the large shed that had metal clanging just behind the doors holding a meal for two. It felt like walking into a private room or on holy ground without shoes. Steve took a deep breath. He could walk here. He was an angel after all.
Tony smiled ducking his head bashfully. “I do love him quite dearly but,” he looked up under his lashes. “If it’ll get me the house.”
Tony barely had a moment to think before he was covered in blood. Stane’s head pulled clean off his shoulders by Bruce’s wolf. Tony coughed breathing air and blood as Stanes’ body splurted and fell over onto it’s side.
Bucky threw Thor’s pillow at him and T’Challa chuckled. “You have gotten yourselves into quite a bit of trouble haven’t you?”
Tony threw something at him, and the rest groaned. Clint took that as his sign to grab Jarvis from the stairwell and retreat to Tony’s workshop.
Tony shrugged. Natasha stayed were she was but pulled out her phone and called up both Clint and Bruce.
“Just think of it, Bruce’s cooking wafting from the kitchen, Clint taking orders and giving the men their drinks. I’m taking money and helping people with their luggage. It’s perfect.”
Bruce looked up and caught Thor’s cautious smile. He didn’t have the energy to move, sun lazy and sleepy. “Good afternoon.” Bruce greeted.
“Tony,” Steve said cutting him off. “Stane came here, marked you, burned your home and took the two things you care about more than anybody here. He’s using them. Killing them, ruins his hand. He’s not leaving you.”
Clint stopped and pushed a finger into Mr. Rogers chest. "I lost the closest thing to children the man may ever get in the forest. Of course, he's snappish. If you ever insult him again I'll kick your ass from here to the sea even pregnant."
“I am Anthony Edward Stark. I haven’t been a Lord since my father died and I haven’t cared since before my father died. I work with machines and thank you for your work in Latveria. Is there any other reason for this meeting?” Tony said releasing his hand and sitting down.
Steve entered him swiftly the need was to great. They had been support structures for too long and the necessity of fortifying themselves was too great. The pace was rough and desperate. How had they gone on for so long with out this? Tony arched into the movements his hands on Steve’s face unable to look away from the other man’s pleasure. Steve’s eyes were closed too lost in the sensation of Tony’s heat and body and willingness.
"A weapon made from your blood and enchanted because of the magic that sings in it and sealed together with my runes." He whispered. "Perfection."
"Because I am indebted to you for offering me use of your pack." Tony said slyly. "Warm thighs and tight comfort are in your future."
Bruce walked out handing the two marshal’s their drinks and walked quickly out. Tony followed him slowly.
“But…I can see your bruises and the bloody rags around your knuckles, I would like to protect you fair Bruce of Banner.”
Tony hooked his foot behind Tommy’s knee and pulled it toward him and Tommy knelt in front of him. Tony stepped on the foot stool and then on it’s shoulder before gliding gently down onto the ground.
Steve looked at Tony collapsed in a small moment of sleep his body curled in a tight ball. Steve had not seen his flesh in so long he wondered if he'd forget.
“Steve,” Tony said. Steve didn’t move and the magic was pouring over his body keeping him barely in his skin.
“You just want sex.” Clint closed his history book and placed it back into his back pack zipping it all up. He wasn’t getting any homework done today.
"That is not helpful, Mr-" Bruce didn't finish because Tony shifted and pretended he didn't understand.
Steve turned back to him. Tony didn’t remove his hand from his neck to reach out knowing already that it was stuck to his neck from blood.
Steve chuckled. "Ah yes. The man who bought that sign there wanting to hide when it's all the wood carvers going to be speaking about for the next month."
At the moment Thor thrust like he was trying to destroy Bruce’s psyche from his cunt and he was doing a very good job of it. In between smelling the spices of his eastward curry downstairs and the snap realizations that those moans were him, Bruce was brain dead in absolute bliss.
“You’re sappy this morning,” Clint whispered his voice hoarse. Bucky pushed his blonde hair off his forehead unable to answer.
“I agree,” Thor intoned standing next to Steve and boxing Bucky in. “Lord Anthony bled too much for this.” Steve turned to Thor who caught his eye. “Automatons that run without spring work or lightning require blood, Captain Rodgers.” Thor clarified. “I think he just revealed that he bled for them.”
Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him through the door way. “Shivering devil. Must be too far away from sin.”
“Look there’s a snitch telling the prefects where the fights are happening. We’ve been lucky that they only come after the second round but they’ve been getting earlier and earlier…”
The bed creaked, and the fingers shifted enough for a third to join then Thor was leaning over him his hips pushed high over Thor's thighs.
“It would be nice if you could mention Anthony Stark in your statement,” said the tall one. “He’s been missing and it was no secret Stane was lookin’ to marry him after the tragic death of Hammer.”
Bucky tilted his head until it hit the pillar. "Good. I'm glad you pointed it out or I would have bitten you a month from now out of pure frustration."
“Starting, right the fuck now, Assistant Principal Maria Hill has created a hand selected security team that can not legally be bought off by you dumb rich motherfuckers. None, of the shit that happened this weekend will happen again!”
“I think second base is a good goal.” She said dragging him along. “We need to override the memories.”
The next morning Tony awoke under a strong warm body and the heady scent of alpha. Tony buried his nose in Steve one more time before pulling away, there was something he had to work on something important. He stood letting Dummy hit his legs and Jarvis click his way over. Tony ran a hand over the top of Jarvis’ head.
Bruce woke up sweaty. It felt as though he slept too close to the fire place for too long and he tried to scoot away. Only to find the weight on his chest to be an arm pulling him back. The solid weight of the other man and his heady smell of humidity was a balm and Bruce relaxed once more into the heat.
The next day Bruce was rudely awoken from an unplanned nap on the bleachers during lunch. He had been sprawled out his arms thrown on either side of the metal bench and snoring. He was also drooling. When he woke up he jolted so hard that his bandaged knuckles banged against the metal under his bench and sat up hissing in pain.
Bruce didn’t respond just waiting the horrible beats in which Thor walked out closing the door behind him. Oh, thank the Lady. Bruce let out a breath the tears flowing freely. He wiped roughly at his face.
The rooms air hung so damp and heavy it felt nearly impossible to breathe. Natasha and Sam walked down the stairs to join them and Thor found his way to Bruces side.
"Jarvis, I'm not done send them away." Tony said his voice muffled like he had something gripped in his teeth.
“Jarvis can do everything except washing.” Tony said. “Anyway, let’s just pay our way and start the renovations.”
Thor probably thought they were friends. Bruce didn’t know. He didn’t know shit. A drop of rain hit his head but he felt no need to move. He wondered if the rain would pass to the ocean or down the valley toward LA.
"I've been stripped naked. He found my flaws and used a finely tuned knife to cut me to my core." Steve said the words half obscured by his knees.
Thor looked towards the safety and coverage of their dorms. “Aye.” He said plopping down next to Bruce on the increasingly muddy ground.
Metal collided with his shin. He smiled shaking the feeling away. “Dummy we’ve discussed this, look where your going,” Tony said. The little creature clutched at his pant leg. “Yes, dear?” Tony asked.
The blood caked around his neck and mouth was the worst of the itchy offenders. He needed to wash himself no matter what. Bruce wiggled out of Thor’s hold and walked out of the stable with Thor trotting behind him with a small whine. Bruce walked in the direction of the river, shivering in the cold rain.
Sam came up and took his hand. “Good to meet you,” he said friendly as ever. Thor pulled him into a hug then grabbed the other two alphas so they were all in a hug.
“Silly devil, that’s what my pack is here for. We, together, under your command will fix it.” Steve reassured.
“I’m fine.” Tony said. “I think we should stay here for the night. Dusk is falling and this is an inn. We can house the others, alpha.”
Thor sat in a corner of their room watching with his brow’s furrowed listening to their conversation.
“That is all well and good.” Thor said picking through their belongings. “But your smell deceives you.”
“How,” Clint kicked and Cross grunted, “was. I. Supposed. To. Know.” Clint finished each word with a boot.
Stane kept the hand on his neck with just enough pressure to make it nearly impossible to move and his other hand traveled down to Tony’s belt. No.
Tony picked Clint off the floor and deposited him on the second bed. He giggled and stuffed his face into the pillow. Tony walked to close the door and hesitated before blowing out the rooms candle. He looked around and admired his pack. Clint was a strong hunter and Bruce was a strong mind. He had quite the pack in deed.
Bruce gave him a tight sad smile. It was kinda sweet how this big Nordic transfer student wanted to save him but he also had never been in Bruce’s line of wrath before.
"He died in a lab accident and because I had no blood relation the pack kicked me out." Tony answered before Jarvis could cover his tracks again.
Tony saw his tavern from the edge of the woods and heaved a great big sigh. He set off at a light jog before stopping. The alpha pack was there. In his place. He couldn’t… He sat down heavily on the ground releasing Jarvis and Dummy from his death grip hold. Dummy clung to him petulantly pinching the skin of his calf and Jarvis tested his joints.
“I like it. Must be freeing knowing my father’s company isn’t monitoring you everywhere you go.” Tony said.
"Do you smell that?" Tony asked tucking a toe behind Steve's knee. He delighted when the man stumbled.
"Holy Father, our first guest is a pack of Alphas. Are we out of our goddamn minds?! We have to change the name Clint."
“I was just waiting for the king to give birth.” Steve said. “Thank goodness their child was an alpha or I would have been king until his mistress could impregnate him again.”
Sunday night was tense. Tony watched Nat finish up her fight a little too quickly. Tony swallowed he didn’t have time over the last week while finishing up his thesis on bio mechanical engineering to actually look into what Stane was planning. Not that anyone would tell him if he asked around. He might have a lot of money but his pissy holier than thou attitude tended to push other people away… Or at least that's what he thinks might have happened. He didn’t like his peers anyway. At least he had Nat. Clint's forgiven him. Bruce maybe…Tony pushed his hair back from his face. God he was starting to depress himself.
Tony relaxed. "We're thankful for that at least." He took a sip of his coffee and looked over his plans for a new automaton. “Scratch away at the itch. Just do be careful, they could probably hear you from Satan’s den.”
The sun was high, and the summer heat was being blown away by the fall air. Steve sat outside the barn drawing the forest. He sketched absently waiting for the man. The one with a pack of omegas hiding from a pack of arms dealers and with automatons that think for themselves.
Bruce didn’t want to say that he never lost a fight. Cause he didn’t. Tony called him a little sociopath and given how many kids he’s sent to the hospital Bruce is under the impression that he might be right. “It’s fine, Thor. I’m not in any danger.”
It happened with such a loud boom as it broke out of the mold Steve was on his feet fist up, Dummy almost toppling over to hide behind him. Tony stayed long enough to place the handle before the metal set and lifted it into the water bin. Steve relaxed as he pulled it out steam covering him. There was another loud thud and several grunts. The steam cleared, and Tony was trying desperately to pick up the hammer.
Steve turned to Tony now that the pack had settled with the news over all. Tony swallowed. “Come,” he said. “I have something to show you.”
Tony shrugged it off. "Irrelevant at the moment. What matters now is that I've have started my own pack of scientists and we can leave this dreadful place."
Bruce’s head tilted exposing his neck and submitting and his fist relaxed head bobbing back to earth. He picked up his fork and stabbed lackluster at his food. “Thanks,” he said finally.
They laughed in his face with a playful bark then knocked behind a joint in Steve’s leg collapsing him onto the ground. Steve shook himself again. The coyote just bounced this way and that over him. Asking for play. Steve shifted back to skin and bone. He crouched. The coyote stopped dead. Steve grinned and tackled him. The other shifter wiggled and then became a man in his arms.
“I just want to know why?” Steve begged. “There has to be an underlying reason than violence and retribution, Tony. I’ve heard you’re protest to school speakers and your cries for justice. I know there’s something there that you just aren’t telling me.”
Bucky looked up and stuffed his hand into his pocket and swaggered up to the counter. “Stark? Really?”
One problem at a time. He ran in the direction of bent trees and heavy tracks and claw marks. Steve’s voice calling out after him.
Tony raised an eyebrow looking up from a text on motorcycle engines. “We keep calling Howard daddy and things are just going to get too kinky for me Steve.’
Jarvis’s head jerked up and down in acknowledgement. Clint smiled but a worry line stayed between his brows. Tony must remember that he was much more perceptive than he appears.
It was almost impossible to notice that Clint and Bucky finally reconciled. Tony saw them in all forms of affection across the house, in the woods, by and in his workshop. It was then that he resigned himself to speaking with Bucky. He did not like the man’s possessive nature for he tended to watch Tony with jealousy when he touched Clint just to reaffirm their bond. He does it with Bruce, a brief brush of hand across his hair, or Thor, a gentle brush of shoulders, even, much to his chagrin, Bucky, a slap outside the head because he’s groping Clint at the dinner table. Tony supposed that he does it with Steve too. It’s probably the gentle foot taps when he demands attention. He could feel a bond tying between them it just didn’t have flavor as the rest of the pack. With all of this it was time.
“What do we do then?” Bruce asked. Tony noticed he’d been a little more dreamy than usual. He was small and thin coming up to the height of 5’5’’ and he had nice little pouty lips so when he was dreamy they tended to part instead of purse. Tony considered dreamy Bruce peak jailbait and he wasn’t happy about. Bruce must be protected.
Tony flapped his hand again as if that would wave away all their concerns and worry. “It’s been an odd day and I still haven’t gotten dressed.”
Steve walked into the room. “Dinner will be ready in an hour,” he said. Stane smiled at him. Steel eyes. Cold demeanor.
"He's seen more than we will in our lifetimes. I trust him with my life and should I die with you and the babes lives."
"I know your body too. It fit once," Thor said leaning close his lips brushing Bruce's. "My manhood will fit again."
“This was my old covert op’s team before Latveria shifted from Herasil to Rance.” Steve explained gesturing to them. “This is Lord Thor Odinson. He became my battle partner with the war became small battles looking for wayward troops.”
Steve threw his pants directly at his head. Tony pulled them off with an offended gasp but still put them on.
“Clint! Bucky! Outside checking the fences by the forest!” Bucky and Clint popped up and Clint ran straight toward the windows away from the straight up fight happening in front of them. Bucky followed and the two of them had the windows open and were gone in moments.
The fifth rubber band that hit the back of his neck had Tommy in a full rage. He flipped around just missing Tony sitting up tall and throwing his book open. The picture of innocence.
Natasha’s face broke. Sam felt a horrible pang of guilt as her expression opened into shock and sadness.
“Yeah. Shit sucks when your daddy ain’t rich and you can’t be on the school’s various sports teams.”
He walked back to the tavern and straight to his room, lighting a lamp and drawing once again. He awoke on his desk the next day. He was up and thundering down the stairs to the kitchen without forethought, grabbed two bowls of porridge almost dropping them onto Jarvis when he kicked open the barns doors and then settled down to draw again.
Bruce jumped off the mats and slammed into the ground palms flat with a scream. Steve stepped back and so did Sam and Thor.
"Your cock will not fit in me," Bruce said between pants feeling Thor's finger pull and stretch at his insides. "Oh gods."
“That means that we still have to have the bidding war in February, but after that we are home free my boys,” Tony said.
“Tony said we needed enough for both university and dorms and food and rent if we didn’t live in dorms,” Clint explained pointing to fingers. “Also cars because for some reason he thinks we’re staying in California.”
"You know what you did, mischievous devil. You may play stupid to them but never to me." Steve snapped.
“I met the Lady and the Father, you know,” Clint murmured. Tony turned pressing his lips into the little fox’s head.
“I need to go to town,” Steve said aloud. Bucky and Clint looked at him. He had not been aware that he’d been joined in the parlor. Especially by the couple who for the life of him he could not find untwined in the throes of passion.
Together Bruce and Tony led Clint out of the room near carrying him before he got his feet under him and shoved them away.
Thor pulled him out of the river and gently led him to the back door of the singed and blackened house.
“Leave him. If he comes we’ll be here and Mr. Stark and Mr. Barton can handle themselves,” Steve said.
“It is better if I stay with, Sir. If you don’t mind. He burns himself less often when I’m here to keep Dummy at bay.” Jarvis said. He tinkered closer and handed Dummy’s claw something which the bot threw then caught and threw again. Jarvis watched over his little metal buddy.
Thor wrapped around Bruce surprising him. There was barely any room for them in the stable and a significantly less space while Thor was shifted. Bruce was itchy and gross. He wanted Tony’s baths, but they were probably gone. Thor nuzzled him. The pack had fallen into an uneasy sleep. Steve was awake eyes unnecessarily vigilant. What? Had his other half not killed enough of the other pack?
He dropped to his knees and the window shattered against the vibration of the house, spraying glass across the floor some of it cutting into Steves legs. He chanced a glance up and found Tony crouched in front of the fire much too close, his clothes steaming on the verge of catching flame. Jarvis was slumped to the side lifeless.
Steve turned to Tony for an answer, but Tony was still taking in the gray sky. It was that color a year ago when he committed the act of murder and left Stane Mansion. Maybe he’d never have to step foot there again. It was nigh on three, maybe four months away. Bruce was growling under his breath and Tony broke out of his thoughts long enough to put a calming hand on the man’s shoulder.
"Fascinating," the doctor said eyes bright and calculating. Tony smiled. He knew that look. Jarvis was something else. With a hat on he looked like a little boy in a suit. He was actually a thousand-year-old man that was maybe a ten-year-old automaton. Dummy beeped offended. Tony ignored him.
"Of course. I expected this. I do take them. They were left over from my previous alpha." Tony flicked the soup around. "I'm running out."
Thor nodded. “Alright.” He rolled up his sleeves and held out his arm as Tony flung things off his desk until he found a knife.
Steve walked over and crouched ready to lift only to be stopped. He strained, and it barely nudged but stayed firmly wedged into the ground. "I cannot, Mr. Stark."
The next day, Steve awoke to the grumble of his stomach. He turned to see that Tony was sprawled over the top of the blanket’s mouth open and eyes restless in the purest form of deep sleep. He smiled and ran a hand over his hair. Steve stood his hunger pushing him forward along with the knowledge that Tony would be starving when he awoke and that they most definitely would spend the day or next in bed.
Steve rolled his eyes at his second. “That too but do you want me and Natasha and Sam in jail, James Buchanan Barne?”
The days then weeks passed and nothing much changed, Bruce stayed in the carriage accepting of the quiet ride with Tony ambling around as a wolf choosing paths that fit his whimsy. When night followed the setting sun Tony would find a prey or two bring them back and hand them over to Bruce to cook. He'd shift back, and they'd talk. About alchemy, metal work, the last things they heard from science journals back when they had such things. When the conversation would run out Tony would play find the planet with Bruce. (He was not particularly good at it which was why Bruce always won.) then they'd sit in comfortable silence with only the fire, Jarvis' eternal clicks and Dummy's sleepy wheel spins for company. They passed through towns, Tony keeping quiet and Bruce looking warily for a pack before they'd head out again, sleeping on hard ground and under the stars, insects, dirt, no bed...Tony hated it.
Sam and Bucky follow him out. The door to the dorm slams shut behind them. Steve stops walking and wrapped an arm around Bucky’s neck.
“Well…yeah.” Tony said. “We’ve been running a fighting ring specifically with similar rules to Fight Club in the hopes of testosterone high thugs would follow them and it’s worked for two years until last week.”
Bucky waved him off standing up. “Was fantastic, Clint is very,” he paused as he opened his drawer. “Athletic.”
Steve had called T’Challa who was already turning on the lights for him. He tried to keep track of the chaos, but someone had punched him awkwardly in the side. Steve caught the next fist and threw it away. It was moments. Maybe. Maybe longer. But the lights flickered on and Steve found himself in the middle of an all-out brawl. He hopped over students pushing his way through. He couldn’t see Tony. What the fuck happened? He reached the stage and met with Sam and Thor. Bucky was held close to Clint with a bloody nose. No sign of Tony. Shit. The image of Tony holding a hand covered in blood to his face and looking mildly disappointed by the whole in his abdomen.
Bruce honestly felt like every bone in his body hurt but he also was curious at what the sophomore was getting at.
Clint immediately spit his out with a shout of "Hot!" Tony choked on his whiskey in laughter sputtering and coughing for air. Bruce just laughed outright.
“Mr. Ellens you’ve used both inappropriate language and were about to assault a classmate am I correct?” Steve said. Tommy let go of Tony’s neck.
Tony tongued his cheek. “You’re easy on the eyes and really quite charming yourself Captain. I’m impressed that you’re the first person in a very long time who could not only keep my attention but match me word for word.”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I know the summer parties aren’t for your enjoyment because I’ve gone to a few and you’re never there.”
"This morning and afternoon he spoke of his home and it wasn't until...later," Bruce choked his head about to pop. "That it occurred to me that he might want me to follow him to his Homeland."
"I had a feeling you'd been in my workshop, but I could have never guessed that you drew so beautifully." He said looking at the paper a vulnerable sort of fondness crossing his face at the image.
Steve stood and grabbed two bowls dripping the soup into and ignoring the break in tension as his pack resumed their good natured ribbing. He left out the back door trudging through ankle high snow to the warehouse. Tony awaited him.
"That is a kind offer, sweet devil, but I am in the process of courting you properly." Steve picked him up and sat him on the bed.
“We need to get moving.” Tony said avoiding Steve’s gaze. Avoiding him. Steve gently pulled him to the door.
"Have fun in the woods?" He said trying to ignore the weight in his belly telling him of horrors he could not understand.
Thor's huge hand slapped down on Steve's shoulder. "That is right my friend." He then bounded after her. Steve stayed on the stairwell watching his pack enter the double doors of the restaurant. He would have to do pack delegations with a man he'd barely seen because of something Bucky did. Actually, now that he thought about it. This was par for the course. He straightened and headed in.
Bucky was asked one too many times about Clint's pregnancy until he threw a chair through a window and screamed. “I want to see my mate!”
“I won’t go to town, there will be too much gossip,” Mr. Stark said from the archway making Steve jump and rip apart his sketch. “Captain Rodgers could you come with me.”
"I'm going to throw something at him." Tony said aloud. Dummy beeped in his bag and the faint whirr of his little wheels gave his point. Whatever that point may be. Tony never knew.
Stane’s hand found his neck gripping it tightly. “Maybe I should.” He grunted fingers tightening. “Or maybe I can play the game again and see if I win when you don’t have your blasted servant with you.”
“It was a safety he gave us, and we should at least respect that by fighting for it and playing nice.”
"I have enough guns and anger to handle it. So, do not worry yourself Dr. Banner." Tony said taking it back to set up in front of the door.
“Now our goal is to open a tavern.” Tony continued raising his arms in the air and dropping Clint to the floor. Tony cursed.
Natasha did not look away, but Sam diverted his gaze. “He built Sam’s wings, my knives, he was half way to building Bucky an arm and he’s built every shield and weapon you might have ever touched. He did it behind his husband’s back and hid it from Obadiah Stane’s books. We owe him for that and more.”
Steve nodded his head oddly understanding. Though from what Tony had picked up from their short two year stint (Steve was drafted into the football team during Sophomore year) he didn’t like bullies and thought the best way to keep peace at the repressed testosterone school for jack asses was to be a prefect. It wasn’t his fault that he happened to be a police man. Not at all.
It was after that that the judge called it a just pack war and let them be on their way. It had been a month long journey to the big city and then three months in civil court talking to judges and marshals and signing treaties and land over. There was so much land. They needed money more and now they had enough notes to live comfortably until their grandchildren died. Steve was legally allowed all of Tonys property since they were claiming that he killed Stane and got Tony as a prize. It made him sick to his stomach but it wasn't as if they'd believe Bruce Banner was able to rip a mans head off.
Tony looked at Thor with a sly grin. “I need the wealth and security, good Captain. Asgard is also said to be eons ahead in practical magics such as runes. I have got to get in on that gift from the gods.”
Supper. Meals. Tony remembered that the closest he’d ever felt to his last pack was during meals. It never lasted long there was always a silent hand on his leg telling him to keep quiet, to disengage. The conversation was never for him to enjoy. Bruce set down the dishes sitting on Tony’s right with Clint on his left. Thor sat heavily next to Bucky nearly throwing him off the bench. Laughter ensued while food was distributed and compliments given to his chef.
“The truth is you’re wrong. About everything. I am a pretty awful human being.” Tony told him his words quiet and echoed hideously around the library’s lobby. He hobbled away faster unable face whatever Steve’s pretty puppy dog face would say about that.
"They are always active. Do not worry yourself." Clint said waving away his concern. There was a familiar whine behind him.
“Semen is a commodity most communities thrive on since it tends to create a lot of work on the other side of such things. Not that your alpha seemed to care about that…Intertwined is the nice way of putting it, I suppose.” Tony said. Steve blushed. Tony leaned in his elbows touching the table. “You do look lovely in that shade of pink, Captain Rodgers.”
Bruce shook. It might have been the temperature of the water or the edge of the entire night finally cutting into him, he couldn’t tell.
Bruce awoke a scream clutched in his chest. He sat up in bed and wiped off the blood. So much. They touched when he said no. More blood, a small coyote covered in blood and viscera and… it won’t come off. It won’t come off, her head, where did it go? He can’t remember. She wouldn’t stop screaming. Men. Disgusting alphas. It will not go away. Bruce scratched and scratched struggling until two large hands held him down. He gritted his teeth eyes closed until Thor’s familiar musky scent filled his senses and he felt that itch from before died down. His body went limp and Thor let go gently wiping tears off his face.
“I do too.” Steve said. He meant it. He missed their presence the entire world echoed wrongly with out the sounds of metal on metal.
Thor scooted closer. His large muscled body from all those hours playing baseball and wrestling released heat the same way gamma radiation did. Bruce swayed toward him. The air was becoming colder but he was a Minnesota boy and it would have to get a lot colder for him to actually be troubled.
Steve gave him a small wave then closed the door behind him. Tony fell back onto the bed and flung an arm over his eyes.
“I bet you can’t do it again.” Bucky said half to distract himself from the obscene sight of Clint’s body bending itself into new and interesting shapes.
Clint looked and caught the end of Natasha’s fond smirk as she looked over her shoulder at Sam. “That truly would be a shame, for I quite like those ears.”
Wow. He really fucked up his leg. He should really wear the boot. Nope. He needed to look too okay. Much too okay. Even with him missing a week of classes he needed to look in perfect health. Even with his healing bruises around his jaw.
“I suppose.” Thor was quiet for a long moment and Bruce closed his eyes once again expanding his awareness to the shirt sticking to his skin and the slow rivulets of water falling from his hair.
Clint's lips twisted. The letter again. He rolled himself up into the sitting position. "My bags have been lost many a times over the months. If there was a letter it would be gone but there wasn't because I checked." Cold and alone in a place very similar to the one they now lay. Clint frantically checked his bags. He found a coded letter from Natasha about finding a leader and then coming back for him. Then nothing but clothes and fletching repair scraps.
Tony threw up his hands. “I am doing my best. I cannot stop you. Clint is the happiest I’ve seen him in a long time and also the saddest. I don’t know what to do with this but it’s better to give you my approval no matter how it pains me.”
Bruce paused before patting his hand. "Then it’s a good thing you picked up a fellow doctor isn't it."
Blood, her screams, they touched when I said no, her screams, stop screaming, a man’s heart, who’s heart, his heart, a leg, her screams, stop screaming! Her head clasped in his hands all that’s left except blood and dirt. Do not tread where you are not wanted, little omega. The Father.
Principal Fury screeched over the microphones. “I’m gone for a weekend in Tahoe and I come back to a fucking clusterfuck.”
Bucky stabbed at potatoes off of Clint’s plate then gestured with them while answering. “We have but you, dear brother, were in one of your moods.” He placed them in his mouth to make the point.
Bucky let him go and they helped each other up.  Clint had to pause breathing heavily a hand on his large belly. Bucky held him up feeling his weight.
Steve cut into his venison his hands swift and precise. “I’ll let you take this one, Lord Thor, you are a much better story teller than I.”
"Besides my future mate, and love of my life and one of the greatest huntsmen on this side of the earth?"
“Apparently the two to five hundred you’ve been told you’ve been making is more like twenty to fifty grand.”
When they had come back inside, Bruce had finally come back and was fetal on his pile of pillows. The sun had started to descend by then and the room grew dark and haunting.
“Good idea.” They all shifted then needing the extra fur against the flurries that had become more prominent during their conversation. Steve laid down first then Bucky, Natasha next and Sam, Thor came last keeping them all warm. Steve didn’t sleep immediately but stayed awake to relish in the face of group comfort. Pack. He’d been but a boy since he had one of those and he would love to try to have one once again.
“Fine!” Tony shouted loud enough to impede their conversation. “If you won’t stay here forever let me at least get a vial of your blood.”
“Did you get them?” He cried crashing into Tony not a care in the world from his sweat and dried blood and grit imbedded into his skin. Bucky ran out after him shouting something about taking it easy.
"The lovely Doctor Banner has rejected me." Thor said heavily. "I have sought to seek why and he has locked me out at every turn almost terrified. Of me? Or of something else," Thor flung the hammer far out into the woods holding out his hand as it rounded back to him. "I do not know."
The Captain picked up the tray and left the house his mood leaving the presence and causing Bruce to relax. Thank heavens. Hopefully, Tony will be done soon, and they can talk. In the meantime. The captain would be best left out of the house.
Thor smiled and turned to sit against the tree. Bruce slowly lowered with him and barely noticed the others walking off. He placed a comforting hand on Bruce’s head once Bruce had fully curled in on himself. “I’m sure he’s well and healthy. Stark is always ahead of us.”
Steve shifted standing on two legs for the first time in too long. “Colonel Wilson!” He called excited. Sam smiled and pulled him into a rough hug. A three legged white wolf with a black wolf on his heels pulled through the trees.
“Since we are ‘combining’ packs given that you and Thor have somehow created bonds to me and mine it seems relevant.”
Steve looked up thinking. “I left for war when I was fifteen and learned very quickly not to be fooled. Men are dead, and you’re left in their wake when that happens. So, as it stands the last time someone fooled me Lieutenant Barnes lost his arm.” Tony exhaled sharply at that and Steve’s eyes met his with a small smile. “Then you come in and within a day you’ve retained my pack’s respect and you fooled me with childish malice. You’re smart and lively and you lead your pack with affection and compassion, something I haven’t seen a long time. You impress me.”
Bucky was extra affectionate today. It was hard to concentrate when he was holding his ass just that way and licking the top of his mouth and… Bucky broke away. Clint took a breath. He could talk Bucky into it. He was a spy. He was cool. Smooth. James Bond. Bucky began to kiss him again and any and all plans drifted.
Bucky holding his side crouched in front of Steve. “I mean he’s pretty stupid. He might talk to me again.”
“No!” Clint was on his feet and it was so quickly that he was surprised that he didn’t topple over. “You left me after my heat to chase a ghost in a war-torn country with nothing to suggest a goodbye. No, I didn’t even see your ‘note’. This pack doesn’t want you here. I don’t. Come. Visit your spawn. Sure, be near. Do not fool yourself into thinking we’re okay.”
Clint sat on Bucky's lap his hips grinding him through his clothes. Bucky's hand wrapped around his neck pulling him into a kiss.
"I'm sorry." Steve said sitting down next to him. "I cannot advise you on how to pursue this but I can offer you my sympathies."
“We know that it exists. We’ve seen proof of gatherings,” Steve countered following Tony through the lobby to the technical manuals.
“We shall take this next week easy in mourning.” Steve said. “We shall leave the window until spring and continue on as usual.”
“I don't know.” Tony said. “I put her together and she began to speak but I had also placed those runes in her. I do not know if it is consciousness I have created or…the lady has birthed.”
Bucky laughed at his pain. "It's been less than a day. Give it some time, talk to Lord Stark, maybe he'll be more welcoming today."
He could not so he went back to the tavern and found Thor flipping his hammer a mulish expression on his face.
“I don't know.” Tony said. “I don't recognize signs but we've been together quite a bit and I ran out of birth control months ago.”
“No.” Tony said his hands shaking. He was still naked. The flames had flicked out ashes which caught fire to his skin. He couldn’t find it in himself to move for his leather apron.
Bruce followed him when he pulled away leaning his head on his shoulder and feeling his eyes close relaxing into the soothing timber of Thor’s voice.
Steve didn’t know. He wanted a fight. He wanted them dead. The shit bags who sat there unphased until Stane was in his hands. He was so close to just snapping his neck right there. Just right there in front of everyone with out Tony’s consent.
She sighed and opened the door to let all of them file in. Tony jerked awake and Bruce rolled out from under his bed fists up.
Tony was in his office playing with an intricate clock he was thinking of setting above the front desk. He should be looking into the payments of the pack staying with them but in all honesty, he didn't care. The house was paid for. Property tax could be covered if he sold his clocks to the market if it came to that. The babies’ room was completed at the same time he finished Clint's on the bottom floor. They were, for all intents and purposes, comfortable.
"Among other things." Bruce sighed his eyes closing behind his spectacles. He listed where he stood holding up the water tin. Tony steadied him with a hand. He held on longer than necessary. Bruce was still seeking a pack. Of course. Why wouldn't he? People go mad without packs. Or they realize two omegas can create a pack. A good one at that. Tony shook out his pail rougher than necessary. A damn fine pack they were.
“We shut down. A hundred ninety k a piece is enough for eight years despite Tony’s protests.” Natasha said. “We don’t have to hold the bids tomorrow.”
They came one after the others Steve collapsing on Tony, cock still hard and ready inside him. Tony brushed his hands through Steve’s hair and the kissed sloppily more of a connection of mouths against flesh than really a kiss. When Tony felt the after shocks recede he said something he did not expect to hear from himself during sex in his lifetime.
Steve opened the door. Two state Marshall’s stood on the porch looking curiously at the scarred pieces of wood that hadn’t been damaged enough to pull away given the time constraint of winter.
"I made breakfast. Not as well as Doctor Banner but still, good enough. I'll be taking Tony his meal--" he opened.
It was a night when the inn was still unfinished that Tony sat leaning back staring at the stars. Clint leaned against him eyes closed and hands following the path of movement inside his belly still new and exciting. Bruce laid his head in Tony’s lap and they stared at stars.
The taller one had crossed his arms and was looking more closely at his surroundings. “You’ve got a lot of clout.”
Ha! Bruce pressed a hand against his forehead. He was not and could not be pregnant. He didn’t have heats and no longer bled. The science didn’t lie.
“He forgot to steal suppressants after Shield collapsed. He said he’d had birth control but the longer I’m away the more I worry.”
“I know. We’ll go get them, Tony. Not now. It’s raining we’re a man down and two of our spies haven’t returned. We need shelter.”
Clint was surprised when Bucky began thrusting into him in earnest. He moaned wrapping his legs around the man’s waist. He rolled his hips to help Bucky hit the right angle.
“It is alright, grieving devil, but we must bury him before the ground is truly frozen over in snow.”
"Also call us a pack. You never try to bond and if you weren't a decent man we probably would have gone feral trying to obtain affection from you."
Steve sat on the front porch his knees pulled up to his chest staring at the road. No one had passed in the hours since he decided to sit there. A familiar figure pulled up next to him and laid down staring at the covering for the porch. They sat in silence.
Steve outright laughed this time. “Yes! I like you. A lot against my better judgement, given that you run an open setting for our peers to hurt each other as violently as possible.”
“Yes, the parties that contain only a few hundred students, none of them your friends that you use to wreck daddy’s house.”
Bucky stood up his tools falling to the ground with a clatter. “Really? This is great I’ve got the unwilling approval of the man Clint trusts most.”
"Workshop. Congratulations on the mating. May good wealth come to you and strength come to our pack. Which it will. Mr. Barton is quite the warrior." Steve said.
Thor looked away and a red tint covered his ears. “I can handle dirty work I am a warrior after all.”
Bruce looked him in the eye. “I can give you nothing! You fool. There’s nothing here. I’m barren, you’re a Lord. You need more than a dysfunctional, ageing, omega. What if I decide to stay here? Don’t you have responsibilities to your county? It is for the best when Captain Rodgers fails to meet his own impossible standards to leave with the rest of your pack and return home.”
Tony scratched his head. What next? They sat tense on the couches for an hour then Steve let out a serrated rumble of a growl.
“Bruce,” Tony said timidly. Bruce wasn’t looking at him his fist clenching too tightly. “Bruce,” he tried again more forcefully. Bruce looked him in the eye. It wasn’t Bruce’s eyes. Tony remembered the green over the smell of freshly spilt blood.
"Pass me that please," Tony said absently. The small metallic creature put what was in its claw in Tony's hand he used the cloth then handed it back. "Thanks."
“Oh!” he intoned. Tony grasped Natasha’s neck and their bond slid back to place. His hand slid down and over to Sam’s shoulder the connection tightening. Steve felt something strengthen in him over Tony’s reaffirmation of their pack status.
"We'll adapt as we've always have." Bucky said pushing himself up. "We'd have to anyway. Clint is a mess of his own and I am going to enjoy seeing Jim when he gets you angry."
Steve sighed. He's spent four days drawing the wily coyote and not actually wooing the man and that may make it impossible for him to get anything done.
Once his hand was good and patched he went to leave out the window again, much more languid than before and found himself stuck in the window.
"You send out electric sparks? What runes do you use?" Mr. Stark was saying looking over Thor's hand.
Steve was looking at him eyes wide and trustful. Tony couldn’t finish. He had so many plans. The first was not getting expelled for creating a fight club. The second was seeing all his friends financially stable and happy. The third was to climb the political ladder until he was in a high ranking position and redesign the entirety of the USA. A lot more complicated than the first two but also relied heavily on the first two so that he would still be a viable candidate for senate with no record of arrest. Which is what happened once he was expelled for creating a fight club.
The three headed back to the warmth of the house and looked at and held babies. Tony for the first time in over a month finally slept in a bed.
“Clint’s stupid. I love him, but he’s stupid. Right as we were leaving his suppressants wore off and…”
"Fantastic. My husband is dead, and I am now a bachelor in the wind," Tony said. His food showed up, but he felt obligated to stay with Clint and catch up.
"Good." Tony sighed and grabbed his clothes. "We'll talk later on how we'll go about this. He's yours Doctor Banner while I take a shower and finish the room we were working on."
“Most likely we”ll have to leave for a long time to fill out so much paperwork my eyes will begin to bleed.”
Clint's face softened and he took the baby off of Bucky's hands and opened his shirt to breast feed knowing by some cosmic force that it was time.
"You could also try to stop dropping our ranks. It's driving us mad. Most of us are from Shield Militia and haven't been part of the military proper in over a decade."
Clint was having a nice washing session with their own clothes Dummy bumping into him every five seconds asking for a new item to 'hang' or in his case carefully lay out on the large stone boulders. Clint only handed him socks. It was their routine sometimes Jarvis would join ticking along and Clint would ask the names of trees and flowers, so he wouldn't feel too left out. The bastard always tsked at him for forgetting the names of wild flowers yet would always provide Latin as their proper names.
Tony wiggled roughly away. “Angel, you truly have been the devil all along because you remind me of things that must be forgotten.”
Then with a small tick an automaton walked out from around a corner. "Good morning, Captain Rodgers and Lieutenant Barnes," it greeted.
Bucky pushed a hand through his long hair wishing for something to tie it up. “He found her and recruited her for Shield before she got drafted for the war.”
"How would you like to spend the morn?" Tony asked when the silence became to deafening and the images flickered at the edges of his mind.
Another month passed and the winter finally let up the snow began to melt and once there were patches of snow on the ground the letter of retrieval from the federal court came.
“Was alright until an insatiable devil came along,” Steve answered sitting on his heels. “What brings you to the woods at night?” Why are you ordering my pack around?
“Our goddamn security team left the property, a student was shot, a TA arrested for attempted man slaughter and so much blood, not even
"That would be more effective if you were clothed." Bruce said. He was putting his belongings back awkwardly around Dummy's still closed claw.
Steve entered an empty basement. He scanned and found a trail of blood. He followed it out the door and saw only the back of the school and a line of trees. He opened up his phone and began jogging.
Steve genuinely thought about explaining the actual gifts of their friends but Tony pulled against his hold eyes still blatantly glossed over. He shrugged. “Yes. The Lady owns a piece of Tony and The Father a piece of Bruce.”
“We need prefects to find who's sabotaging our fights.” Clint said. He was still a little horny and it was getting worse with how much Bucky is glaring at him.
"I would too, if he'd stop trying to kill me." Bucky said around the finger he stuffed in his mouth.
Bruce snuck back into the woods to look for Tony. Clint and Natasha were forced to cover for Tony’s disappearance and Bruce was the only one with a shit enough roommate to get away with sneaking into the woods. Natasha had vaguely described where to go but Bruce was also dodging around prefects who were searching for some of the drunken stragglers. Where the fuck was he? Did he get picked up? That wouldn’t be so bad, but the way Natasha described his unseeing eyes made Bruce worry. He’d had his fair share of concussions but the horrid ringing noise that came after Stane had knocked Tony down was still blasting through his ears. A roll of quarters, holy shit. Clint and Natasha couldn’t watch as well in the woods given the lack of lighting and crowd control of open areas. Even then it would have been hard to see when and how Stane got the quarters in the ring. Fuck. Bruce stopped and leaned against a tree.
“You didn’t come over until money was involved, Clint didn’t even know my name until I told him he could beat the shit out of Conner and make money off of it, and me and Natasha have been roommates for four years and she didn’t actually interact with me until after that first fight.” Tony hid his face behind his legs. “I didn’t want my friends to leave.”
”They are my choice!” Tony roared back jumping to his feet. “They are mine. You cannot blame their existence on anyone but me and you will have to kill me first before taking another away from me.”
He strode up behind Steve and looked over his shoulder. "Not exactly what I wanted but I'll take it," Tony said stroking his goatee.
Steve punched him. It was automatic. He was moving before he could think, like when he saw Stane’s teeth finally release Tony. He could go. Fight.
Steve was quiet he couldn’t break out of the instinct of watch and wait. It briefly reminded him of crossing the Eastern lands with Thor. He could not stop waiting. Something was coming. He didn’t know what. It was. It was enemy fire, then assassins, and then any number of odd or absurd missions but behind every jump every shadow there was intent. It was supposed to take three days to reach home base. On the third day they hadn’t even made it half way there. It was making him antsy. He wasn’t able to focus on anything. There was an awareness of his bonds but because there was no battle he didn’t need to hone in on any of them.
“He’s about two days away but he met up with the rest of his pack so he’ll be there for awhile,” Sam said.
“Either come in or I’ll knock you dead, Steve,” Bucky growled from his room breaking Steve from his downward spiral of thoughts. He walked in and tried not to smell at the stench of fornication and Bucky’s body covered in a very specific type of bruise.
“Steve.” It’s Tony. Steve doesn’t have to check he knows that he’s functional. A hand was placed on his shoulder, then another until they wrapped around the back of his neck thumbs just under his jaw pushing his face up. Steve met Tony’s brown worried gaze.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Leave it, Steve. I’m going to get kidnapped, and then I’m going to take over daddy’s business and be an amazing CEO.”
Bruce pushed Clint on top of the large dining table left over from the previous owners. He then gently nudged him onto his back. "I'm going to check your stomach very quickly." Bruce said lifting up his shirt and gently prodding his abdomen. Then he paused lower down. Clint just held an arm over his eyes appearing to be bored by the going on. Bruce prodded some more closer to the edge of his pants.
“I feel as though there is something you and the other’s are not telling me about your missing fourth.”
“Don’t you have like prefect duties to do?” Tony asked trying to speed up and failing because his boot was heavy and made his steps uneven.
He blinked away hands folded in his lap. They hadn’t told the pack. Tony hadn’t told the pack. They needed to. Tony was walking down the stairs and passed him to reach the kitchen. Steve’s hand shot out to grip his wrist.
Bucky opened his mouth his one hand waggling a pointer finger. “Only Clint could be so heavily fertile and leave the bed without a sound.”
Clint pushed up onto his elbows and bounced his knee nervously. “No. I just remembered that I was supposed to ask you…like…” it was Friday which was why there was no soccer practice currently. “Three days ago.”
"The one with three legs, Romanov, the hawk, the giant and the blonde wolf." Clint answered. Tony nodded taking in the scene. Three dead and two injured and six still fighting with the pack Clint described.
Steve pulled Mr. Stark in close by his hand so there was not even a breath of space between them. "Then I'll have to woo you into giving such a thing up, won’t I."
"Thank you," Steve said. He flinched feeling something being tugged out of his hand. He rolled his eyes. He should be used to this. It happened frequently when he was hiding in the barn. Dummy tapped the pencil against Steve's drawing twice then scribbled lightly over Steve's drawing tapping it once more before looking up for Steve's approval.
Mr. Stark looked Steve up his eyes trailing heat in their wake. They stopped on his face. "There's a smudge of dirt, right here," he said wiping his cheek.
Clint snorted heading back to his washing bucket. "There's several towns in either direction on the road. It never occurred for you to stop in one? Accommodations are cheap and considering you're all clearly military or militia they might have even let you sleep for free."
“Well one,” Tony said counting on his fingers, “Fuck you. Two, we’ve been running this for two fucking years so, yes we did have everything under control. It’s just whoever the fuck thought it was a good idea to give the pervert TA from hell a roll of quarters to beat me with is an unknown and I know everything. Three—” Tony reached for his garbage bin and vomited.
“That’s bull, Barnes, everyone and their mothers know you guys fuck behind the bleachers every chance you get,” Sam snapped.
“That I am.” Bruce said. He grabbed Thors hand and placed it where the baby was kicking. A baby. He was unsure how many but it felt like a litter and he was never going to do this again because Thors virility might kill him the second time.
Steve flushed his ears turning pink. Tony couldn’t help but give him a salacious smile. “I will bed you but the rest that requires something extra.”
Bucky's mouth twisted, and he seemed to think long and hard before what he said next. "Are you well?" He didn't move from his spot in the corner.
Steve pulled away the cloth that Bruce had wrapped around Tony’s neck and wetted it. “I have tried to do so and watched my friends and comrades die behind me. I could never ask you to do the same.”
Tony had not been in the house proper since he got the vial of blood a slightly manic expression captured on his face. Bruce missed their quiet conversations on new breakthroughs in science. Bruce had recently found a research article about the effect of liquor on the liver. He'd tried to explain it to Thor, but the man listened with no input as though entranced. They also nearly fornicated on the kitchen table when Thor's kiss cut him off mid-sentence. The good captain walked in shortly after opened a cupboard and then walked away without taking anything. It ruined the mood to say the least.
“Bad. Man. Dead. Babies. Safe. Leader. Safe.” He said then warped back into Bruce. Tony laughed a little hysterically. Oh dear Lady. Bruce on the other hand fainted falling backwards onto the ground. Tony coughed up another less maniacal laugh and rummaged through Stane’s things to find a hammer. Once found he pried his automatons from the ground and held them close to his body despite the sharp metal edgings biting into his skin. He didn’t move finally feeling together again.
“Oh no, that might have been you, and Mr. Barnes and my own father among others. The pack is great. The children are great. I am not.”
Tony tangled their fingers together and swung their hands between them. “Of course, Rogers, gotta have that beauty sleep.”
"Would you, could you, please, take dinner to Mr. Stark," Bruce asked nicely when the captains eyes reached him.
Steve tongued his cheek and turned to Bucky. Thor sat back. T’Challa paid to fight Bruce of Banner. Everyone knew… Why? T’Challa was an excellent fighter choosing to fence as his sport of choice. He could break Bruce in half.
Bucky grinned leaning over him. “That it did. That I did. You my little idiot did not read the note.”
That seemed to shock him back into the moment. “Steve went out the back door but…” From this angle it was clear that his workshop was in flames. Tony found his feet first and was running at a breakneck pace the short distance there. It was hard to see but two figures were huddled together just inside the edge of the forest. He ran past his work. Bucky and Steve were coming into focus. Oh god, Clint.
A strong hand pushed Clint up onto the desk and Clint opened his thighs welcoming Bucky’s weight. Clint tilted his head expecting a kiss but instead got Bucky’s hands tenderly tracing the bruise that was forming across his cheek. Clint smiled and kissed his palm.
“I would want to not piss myself,” Clint grunted. Bucky shrugged. He had one of those feelings, he gained from seeing children with their parents from a distance that all forms of pride and respect died when children were born. He should have pushed that expectation for when the pregnancy started. He and Clint hobbled to the edge of the woods so the other man could relieve himself. Clint groaned with relief.
"Oh, yes it shall but whether the scratcher will be here or not is of another question entirely." Clint said stuffing eggs into his maw and talking over them. "I'll be here that's for certain."
"It's alright," Tony said extricating his arm from under Steve. They sat in silence Tony hoped the Captain followed in his footsteps and just let the nightmare go.
"Your alpha must have been rich to the point of insanity, Mr. Stark. I cannot believe you are in search of a pack."
He went to the omega sanctuary. He needed a pack. The feral nature of being without he could feel crawling along his skin threatening to over take his sanity. He’d been gone for but a month but even the coyote in him needed someone else. Something not metal.
“You led us all once before, a pack of alpha’s, you can again.” Bucky stated with a surety that Steve felt was ungrounded.
Thor laughed. Laughed. “That pack must not have been your pack. We have not seen Him until he felt threatened. My guess is that he recognizes us as your pack.”
Clint closed his eyes letting the tension go. He thought Tony would leave him. He’d gotten his children lost again. Instead he was comforted and asked to rest. Clint’s brain felt heavy and he barely registered Bucky pulling his body close to him. In moment’s he was asleep. He helped the rest sleep too.
“The pleasure is all mine!” Thor greeted squeezing them within an inch of their life. Once they were released and had steadied themselves from the force of Thor, Steve found the question he’d been lost to ask.
Bucky nodded to him, then turned to Steve and nodded again saying "This is for you I believe." Then walked away.
Tony dropped something and grumbled. Jarvis let out a beleaguered sigh and tinkered away. Steve nearly ran into it.
Bruce scooped out some of the stew into two bowls and placed them on a tray. He gently placed two peaches next to them. He placed the tray on the table careful of spilling. Then he slammed his hand down shaking the table and startling the good captain.
“I’ll ask Bruce to bake you something sweet, to cover the foul taste of death,” Clint called back beginning his washing once again.
“Absolutely disgusting, Mr. Barton. I could see straight down to your stomach and,” Tony squinted. “Dear Lady, there’s a bug in there!”
Tony sat back assessing. “You speak of your pack as a unit instead of a family. To be utilized rather than loved and it’s very distressing to hear since you want to combine our packs. My pack has children on the way and I’m very certain we do not want to train little soldiers.”
Tony shrugged and shifted to avoid answering. Then he was darting away towards the inn. Steve sighed and shifted to run home.
Steve was lying on the floor of Tony and Natasha’s dorm room with his hands over his eyes. Tony had fallen asleep while his little crew of fighter slowly released information on nearly every high ranking student, professor, and personnel, in the entire school. Natasha bragged about how her teacher wanted to fight her to relieve whatever sexual tension they had for her. She broke their nose before they even had a chance to jerk off. It was one of the teachers Steve thought was a good person. Apparently everyone in this school was the worst human being in the world.
Clint preened. "Why thank you. Bruce nearly had an episode, but Mr. Stark just laughed until he couldn't laugh anymore."
“Thank you, Rogers,” Tony called over his shoulder heading out into the fading sunlight. Steve caught up to him and Tony was mildly annoyed that he was able to match their paces together. It shouldn’t have been so endearing.
"I have thought about it long and hard." He boomed. "But I shall make Bruce of Banner my mate. He smells of strength and is brighter than the sun."
Steve picked up the pace and heard rustling in the trees and the sound of Bucky yelling.  Steve stopped and listened. There was a thwack followed by several curses. Steve ran in that direction and found a kid holding his head.
Tony stood up and gently pushed Bruce behind him he looked around their company to Natasha who was closing the door behind them. She shrugged. She too did not want to be awoken at nine a.m in the morning either. Steve pushed through so he was in front of Tony.
Thor didn’t look totally convinced but dropped the subject. Bruce shouldered on his tortoise shell of a backpack that when weighed was at least fifty pounds. “Come on let’s get some lunch I’m starved.”
"It is the man that makes the clothing not the clothing that makes the man," Tony replied flippantly.
Sam’s figure drew closer and Tony found himself at a lost for words Steve’s burning eyes slowly scorching the side of his head. Sam shifted soundlessly a few yards away and ran up. Steve’s eyes shifted away, and Tony let out breath he did not know he was holding.
Clint was still chuckling. “What could possibly happen?” He snorted. “Could I get, I don’t know, pregnant?”
“Poor baby,” Tony sympathized patting Clint's back. He was actually mildly relieved. Maybe if they broke up Tony wouldn’t have to be constantly looking over his shoulder wondering when the VP Maria Hill was going to show up and expel him.
“Y-yeah. I was going over to his room for a sleep over,” Bruce knew this was common enough that the prefects wouldn’t report it. Hell, even Thor talked about him and T’challa sleeping over at Rogers’ and Wilson’s rooms.
Clint shrugged. “I was going to say yes either way. I’ve been on my own for only a month and I’m going right mad about it.”
“At least we’ll be able to enjoy each other’s company while you’re here.” He said smiling at his work.
“He certainly is.” Tony mumbled taking a stumbling step in a direction no one could see. Steve stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
Stane’s hand came down on his shoulder stopping all of Tony’s movement. The air stilled and Tony could hear the faint screams of fright beyond them.
Tony looked back at Clint. No, with no Shield he had to be out of birth control and Bruce might murder the man which would solve a problem… but that man also had a ring so that would only cause more. Tony closed his eyes and took a breath. Duty calls.
Tony laughed it was a raw unkempt thing that sent razor blades along Steve’s spine. Steve sat up and saw Tony stuffing his hands in the creek. His body was shuddering as if snow were falling upon his bare skin.
Bruce tilted his head accepting the kiss. He always did get caught in Thor’s whirlwind. Then he patted his shoulder and pushed away.
Tony smiled grimly at Sam pulling him by his neck into a hug. Their bond slid back int place. Tony could find him if he is unable to comeback. “Thank you, my gratitude holds no bounds.”
"If your referring to the second automaton he's in a bag because he can't stop rolling off of tables."
"Oh, this is not the finished product," Steve said not looking away from his picture. "It's a warm up."
Clint stopped him with a hand on his ankle. “Don't, its just Bucky.” Clint said and then fell back asleep.Bruce took off his glasses and cleaned them. The pack could not stop staring at Clint's lack of concern.
“When was the last time we touched each other,” Tony said eyes closed. The turkey sat heavy in his stomach and the beer had warmed him.
Tony let out a choked gargle sob. Steve realized he was laughing. “Shut up or you’re never going to eat again.”
They reached the tavern three days later. It was both a relief and a punch to the gut. Tony held a hand to his head as they entered the clearing. Clint ran out of the house at full speed.
He walked out without another word and left Steve alone in the small office. Steve sank into his chair. He remembered the man consumed in his work at the Smith he built in a barn and the man who cruelly suggested he'd see Clint's children as viable soldiers and the man who blushed when embarrassed.
"Bored. The lovebirds are singing their song and I'm sure we will be hearing their activities in the night."
Clint slapped Bruce on the back and nodded in agreement. “Of course, dude. I almost lost my best fuck buddy for you. I would totally hang with you after high school.”
“Then there were the nationalist who had infiltrated the group long before we got there.” Natasha added. “Shield disintegrated into three powerhouses who opened up a protection agency.”
"Of course, Nat." His eyes followed her up the stairs and refused to focus on Bucky waiting impatiently in a corner.
He had to leave. He’d been here too long. Pack here! No go! The other snarled. This over everything else rang true. Tony. Here. Pack. Don’t leave. More death. Stay. Bruce took another breath. Clint could leave with Captain Rodgers’ pack. Yes. He leaves after the birth, they live off finding their own home. Bruce and Tony are left to run their blasphemous little tavern by themselves.
Natasha patted his back. Tony kept his head in the bin for too long embarrassed. He looked up. His vision blurred and he wiped his mouth and slowly regained his visage of being collected. Steve had the crinkle in his brow that made him look like a sad dog outside a window. Sam was looking at Bucky who was looking at Clint who was looking out the window. Bruce stood up.
Natasha blinked in the face of the three prefects and a smiling Clint. She had surrounded herself with stupid assholes. Sam looked apologetic, Steve looked angry, and Bucky…looked exactly as done with this as her.
Bucky was the first person he comes across. The man looked at Tony and then walked backwards out of the room. Tony’s hands were shaking and he continued to work on the watch. So far, so good…
Bucky creaked across the room and Clint heard him settle in the chair across from him. "Is that where all the extra weight came from? Could have fooled me."
Principal Fury put a hand over his eye and muttered intelligibly into the microphones before handing it off to Assistant Principal Hill. She was a lot more usual school administration authority, and thus a whole hell of a lot less interesting. Steve knocked out on Thor’s shoulder and only jostled awake when Bruce fell onto him also dead asleep.
The two alphas relaxed but Steve eyes held onto him that worrisome line held in his brow. It was there that morning during their small discussion. He was willing to let it go for now. Tony leaned all the way over the table to grab some more of the wine. That line between the alpha’s brow was going to be the end of him.
Steve sighed and stood with Tony who pulled him far enough away from the fire that they could shift into their animal skin comfortably. Tony laid down first and Steve circled him before curling around him so that he may rest his head across Tony’s neck. Jarvis and Dummy were still held tightly in the bag Tony never set down and happened to be seated between the two of them. Steve hadn’t planned to actually sleep but the sounds of Jarvis’ ticks and the faint whir of Dummy’s claw lulled him into a kind of security he had not felt in quite some time.
"Mr. Stark then," the other man said stepping into the office. "I'd like to introduce myself under better circumstances given last night’s catastrophes."
Tony laughed and gave him the broom. He left to check on Dummy who was cleaning up the hole in the kitchen.
Steve felt Tony’s forehead. It was so cold and clammy. He slapped his face trying to get him to wake up. His eyes fluttered open.
"Captain Rogers you seem like a nice man but if you ask about my capability again, I am obligated to punch you." Clint said. There was odd bark of laugh that Clint had not heard in half year behind them. Steve scowled at his companions and Clint walked on at a steady pace. The silence was comfortable until, Steve broke it with the one question Clint did not want to hear.
“You redirected me.” Steve said once they were close to the courtyard where Tony could see his group huddled together. Clint was trying to throw cheerios into Natasha’s mouth and Bruce was sprawled out snoring.
“Wait! Stop!” Bruce shouted finally getting a hold of himself. “I have a needle and proper medical equipment give me five minutes.”
Once the last shovel full was spilled the pack slowly walked away and back to the house. Tony couldn't move. Couldn't feel the cold. He could only watch Dummy's lazy tracks through the snow as it mourned its brother.
Clint woke up. His lungs hurt and his back hurt and his head hurt but he woke up prying his eyes open. He was wet. And cold. The patter of rain clouded his vision.
The pack has helped them as much as they could given that babies require their carriers milk and not much else for quite awhile. Tony didn't continue.
The taller one side and rubbed his thinning hair. “We’ll need a written statement and then you’ll have to go to the federal court sometime in spring.”
Clint shifted leaning into Bucky’s hand as his form became more human. He nosed at his wrist. “Don’t hurt yourself. You’re kind of awful at this whole speaking thing.”
Bruce and Clint burst in silently and took the notebooks from Natasha. Then repeated the process of looking between their phones and Tony. Bruce and Clint next to Tony. It was very quiet for a very long time.
Steve flushed. There had been too much talk of sex this morning and Steve was quite done with it. He headed to the mess hall. "Colonel Romanoff would be better suited for such discussion, Lord Thor."
"Nothing. It felt like a series of bad omens led us here. Why stay when The Lady is telling us it's cursed?"
“They were stolen.” Bucky said shutting him down. “We need to find shelter and regroup. Then get them back.”
He grabbed a broken pocket watch from the side of the table and pulled out his little pack of tools with it. He walked into the main house through the door in the kitchen. It was best to face the music now rather than later.
Steve walked by first wearing only his trousers slung deliciously low on his hips. He smiled at the two of them and continued to the dining room patting Jarvis on the head. Tony next completely naked he smiled at them genuinely. Clint let his eyes trail and smirked then frowned. There was dried blood flaked around his mating mark.
Sam and Natasha looked through the stairs and seats of the bleachers and watched the idiots fornicate. Natasha gagged and got up, Sam was already trying to bleach his brain and staggered after her.
“Okay,” he whispered leaning back on his hands pulling away from Steve’s warmth. He closed his eyes and listened beyond the happenings of the house. Beyond the crickets. Very faintly but getting louder was the distant beating of wings.
Clint swallowed blinking away the wetness in his eyes. "I would have chased you down then murdered you if I had found this that morning."
"Thank you, Mr. Stark." Natasha said carefully. Sam, Clint and her exchanged looks before turning upon him in a slightly uncomfortable manner.
Tony set down the piece of scrap metal he as going to use to fill in the holes in Dummy’s base. “They will understand. We could use your help, old friend.”
Tony turned to watch them go. It was long after they had passed his line of sight before he walked away from the clearing. He grabbed a knife from one of the dead and sliced open the back of his hand. On a tree in the denser brush he drew Dummy and Jarvis and reached. The magic touched him, and he pulled. "Darlings," he called his voice ringing like a hammer against a hot piece of metal. "Come to me." The symbols burned then disappeared. Tony sat against the tree and waited.
“Good evening!” Tony smiled and walked down the steps holding out a hand. “I assume you’re here for me.” Stane’s steel eyes slowly covered every inch of his body.
Steve held out four fingers. Those were the alpha’s he had seen but he had a feeling there were more. Thor nodded picking up on their old military symbols and undressed before shifting and heading out.
The other pack never came inside and instead circled the house waiting patiently. Thor returned and held up seven fingers and carried a rabbit inside. Bruce returned but Bucky had stayed in the workshop.
They barely made it up the stairs before Tony had pulled off his shirt the need to touch him overwhelming. Steve picked him up and Tony wrapped his legs around him so that they could make it to bed without letting go.
It took Steve until the moon rose high the autumn wind blowing through him to his bones to find Tony for the second time that day. The entire pack was on the search except for Bucky. Clint was shouting himself hoarse with Bruce and Thor was thundering around on all fours. Steve was tracking with scent and eyes on the ground. He followed a trail of light footsteps to a large maple tree shedding its leaves. The little coyote was curled in on himself and shivering in a burrow under a tree. Steve was silent on two feet as he came around to face him. Tony growled not bothering to remove his nose from under his tail.
“I do,” Bucky said. Steve barely heard him. The smell of soup wafted along. Right. Food. Tony needed food.
She clasped his hand. “My sister was once where you are. I owe her soul the kindness she could not find.”
The marshal was a different one than the two that had come and he didn't stay longer than to hand the letter and threaten Steve until Steve pulled rank. It was time to leave.
Tony walked into the warehouse just after dusk while the pack entered the ruined house. It was much worse for wear than the house full holes and crumpled support beam. His materials were still fine. He sighed. He should have known. He worked with fire and metal and burned building is something that won’t break his art. With that he set down the bag holding his automatons and began his work. He set Jarvis sitting up and began to rebuild Dummy’s wheels.
Clint’s eyes hardened telling Tony all he needed to know. Tony’s grip tightened and Clint took his hand before they let go together.
Tony smiled and cocked out a hip looking under his eyelashes. Rogers flushed. “Anything for you, Steve.”
Bruce was angled awkwardly against Thor and had to nearly sprain his arm to be able to pet the other man's head.
Steve stretched pleased with the thought. Tony’s heat from Stane’s bite never came but that didn’t mean they couldn’t have some fun and Steve couldn’t thoroughly mark him. He cracked his neck and pulled on a pair of pants. He was on the last step when there was a sharp knock at the door. Natasha and Sam were lounging in the living room so Steve raised an eyebrow at their lackadaisical response.
“Look. I want you. I want to spend time with you again. I’m sorry I overreacted and shoved you away.”
Thor and Bruce squinted at the mad man holding out his hand as if he expected Thor to just hand it over instantaneously.
"How are you, Lord Thor?" Bruce said his mouth moving before he could think. Thor's presence was incredibly inviting.
"No." Bruce groaned. Was he really that big? He couldn't be that big. Bruce doesn't remember him being that big. Wait. Is he in rut? That only happens when omegas are in heat. Bruce is most definitely not in heat. Bruce wiggles trying to get away. "I mean yes."
Steve let out a sigh and let his pack reestablish bonds. He had someone to look for. He trotted around the house and saw Dummy. He barked and Dummy looked up and waved its arm back and forth trying to roll to greet him only to fall over. That was when he noticed the automaton in a pink frilly dress with a wide brimmed hat toddle over to it and helped Dummy up. Dummy completed his journey making loud clanking noises and the small automaton held out a hand for Steve to sniff. He did and let her run a hand over his snout. He pretended like he didn't feel a resounding sadness at her presence. Dummy clutched some of the cloth on his pack and dragged him towards the farmhouse that now had red and white paint. The little automaton walked with them her hand gently pressed to Steves side occasionally petting the fur there before stilling. She made softer less agitated and exact ticking noises than Jarvis did. Steve still liked the sound. They padded into the warehouse.
"Two scientist and two automatons on the other hand," Tony said leaning over to tap Bruce on the nose," Are."
Next fight was Clint and some senior who liked to punch in his words ‘fags’. Tony might actually watch. This one should be interesting to say the least. Their fighting ring consisted of four fighters, Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Tony. There were two fights every Sunday with rotating fighters you could either fight or bet against. If a student would want to fight at the first of every month there was a bid for the maniacs out there of which there were more than Tony had thought possible. He shouldn’t have given the repression that all boys elite schools create and the near cult like mentality of those who thought they were better then the ones on the bottom. Tony wasn’t on the bottom. He was just as rich and caustic as the kids he mocked and looked down upon.
Mr. Stark let out a derogatory chuckle. "I have been mated before, and because of my status you could mate me again against my wishes. Try again, stubborn angel.”
"We are trying to merge a pack, Steve. My..." Bucky closed his eyes, "partner does not want us here. Lord Stark does not want us here and according to you, wanted partial control over your pack. You suddenly flipped the hostility switch the moment he showed that he already had partial control. It's rather suspicious."
Bruce cleaned his hands. “I’m going to go make dinner.” He walked out the back door. Bucky and Steve made eye contact.
“Are you?” Bruce asked realizing in the month since the birth Tony had some how created an large automaton.
Tony leaned back resting his weight on his hands and watching Steve's pencil cross the paper. "It's a nice sign."
Tony’s brain shifted through the hundreds of balls he juggled on a day to day basis and couldn’t for the life of him find the one she was talking about.
“Good,” Clint said against his lips. The kiss was slow and sweet Clint wrapping a hand around Bucky’s neck to keep him there. Bucky broke apart just to kiss down Clint’s jaw and nose at his throat once again. Clint turned and pressed his body against him. Bucky groaned against his mouth and his hands reached up tentatively to feel his belly and the children in his womb. Clint pushed further into him, only to pull their lips apart.
Steve turned to Bucky. "I was not. The man speaks with knives and gunfire he wanted me mad. Then he had to be," Steve remembered the first night with the tempting devil. "Had to be so intriguing. I said to myself if this man was clever enough to tire you out in the woods to keep you from something and arrogant enough to strut his nudity proudly yet humble enough to admit when getting caught, I had to have more."
“Stay.” Captain Rodgers reiterated. “Mr. Barton is well loved by a majority of my unit and in an effort to maintain our pack bonds I would like us to stay with your pack and in the long run integrate the two.”
“No! Of course not.” Bruce’s voice echoed and more people came in. Bruce’s chest tightened as he saw Rogers, Wilson, and Rumlow round in on him. His fingers curled into his palms and his muscles tightened in his shoulders and legs. He couldn’t let it out. The anxiety clawing at his throat and head. He couldn’t…
Eight or so drinks later Tony returns to the room with Bruce’s food far past cold with Clint under his arm.
. She heard another body sit close to her and open their own book. She continued reading with more ferocity. When someone pulled this shit she had to look more fearsome. More intimidating. More…masculine.
Tony held a hand to his chest. The nightmare sifting away at the sight of his automatons. He almost couldn't remember what it was of.
Steve didn’t have the legal right to go up there and make sure Tony was okay. Steve headed up the stairs. He heard voices coming from Tony’s room. Well one voice.
“Let’s not bring state law enforcers and lawyers into this situation.” Steve said. “There’s going to be blood and it’s best no one looks too closely if there are survivors.”
Bruce bit his lip and looked at his palms his fingernails had sliced into them and the blood was already coagulating. “Okay.”
Bruce did not realize the one item that kept him in celibacy was the good captain. Not even twelve hours after he sent him out to deliver food, did he find himself pinned between Thor’s thighs and the door of the kitchen. This was not the first nor the last time. Thor was very persistent when he wanted to be and now that they were effectively alone all the time…Bruce never had this much sex. Not even during his last heat over a decade ago.
“I approve of their mating.” Tony said his voice only a breath. “It is the memory of mine that has shaken me so.”
“I think he was struck outside the head,” Bruce said. Clint sniffed him and almost choked on the smell of iron. “Then he inhaled a little bit of smoke before you picked him up.”
"You won't be saying that when you're sucking Captain Rodgers fat cock!!" Clint calls back leaning over the edge of the couch.
"That is unwise, sir." Jarvis replies his metal head turning towards Tony. His voice echoes for a fraction of a second making his already odd form even more unearthly. Tony stared at the small slits in the metal, then threw a piece of his toast at the other man. Jarvis let out a sigh and went back to kicking his legs. Tony had once implied that Jarvis liked the sound of his knees clacking with movement and Jarvis had scoffed at the idea of ever being so childish.
“Thank you.” Steve said. He grabbed Bucky by his shirt and pulled him off the bed. “We appreciate it very much.”
Tony just walked away with a dramatic sway to his hips that Clint couldn’t help but watch as the man walked up the stairs his mark still raw and red. Clint could feel two gray eyes burning holes in the side of his head.
Clint woke from a haggard cough and saw Tony staring sightless over him. His lungs hurt and he felt a hole in his heart. Clint had failed his leader once again. Clint reached out and Tony took his hand.  "I have lost your children once again."  Tony set his hand on his cheek.  "Shh... it was an act of malice. 'Twas not your foolery." "I have never been snuck up on, if I had just moved faster or heard..." Clint turned his head into Tony's abdomen. "I'm so sorry." "Your children weigh upon you and your senses, little omega. It's not your fault. I do not blame you."  "You should." Clint said his voice barely heard muffled by Tony's shirt.  "I will never. You are mine and I am yours. Your mistakes are mine and I see this as no mistake."  Clint peeked up. Tony was looking right at him his eyes kind but tired.  "I believe you." Clint said. "Come you must rest."  Tony began combing Clint's short locks once again. "Soon. Just not yet."  Clint hummed exhaustion pulling at his eyelids. Sleep over took him.
"You do know you're naked right?" Bucky said breaking through Steve's reverie. He was near violent with anger once again.
“Sam and I are going to the town tomorrow to do an investigation on a missing body.” Natasha’s voice broke the night and it was as if it pierced the sensitive silence and the bugs suddenly let loose a deafening buzz.
“We can’t do this.” Bruce found himself saying. It was like there was a fog around him and another was controlling his body. The other growled from its cave but did not leave.
"I'm happy for you. I am. I think finally building Lieutenant Barnes and arm should suffice as a blessing, don't you?"
The tavern they reached was extremely crowded. Tony was thankful they came in from the back because nothing was more suspicious than two men covered in blood walking through the front door of a heavily populated area. Tony locked Dummy in the carriage and Jarvis stayed with him playing up his role as slave boy and not automaton. Tony and Bruce spent a good hour bathing, while Tony babbled about pipes and creating a water system in a house so heating it over the fire wasn't necessary. So impractical. Let him fix it. They were all for staying in their room for the night until their stomachs got the better of them. Bruce groaned getting up for a meal. Tony, feeling rightfully twitchy, grabbed his wristlet and left their room telling him to lie in bed and rest. Bruce was snoring before Tony even closed the door.
"Excellent thinking, Dr. Banner." Jarvis said heavily. Tony tapped him roughly with his screw driver.
Bruce's hips twitched, and he groaned into the pillows exposing his neck. Thor pushes his face into the exposed skin and gave a generous lick.
“Absolutely no sense of spatial awareness in that one.” Tony said nudging the Captains’ thigh to get his attention.
The door creaked when he opened it and Steve stepped tentatively inside. There were loud bangs, melded in with soft murmurs and metallic clicks and the whirr of a wheels. Steve continued deeper setting his tray on the first available surface.
“Aw, man,” Steve said looking down the barrel. “I should have stayed at the local high school and been a football god.”
“He will never forgive you.” Steve said crossing his arms. “And you want to search for him to bring to our unit?”
“Stay in the shop. It’s best to stay out of sight.” Tony told them. He gently swept a thumb under Jarvis’ unlit eyes. “I need to fix that.” He murmured.
Thor sat back on his hands setting his wide shoulders close to Bruce’s head and he took the invitation. Thor’s arms tensed then released. “There’s something sickening in an unmonitored fight. You saw what happened to your friend.”
"Shh!" Bruce said giving him a hard glare. Tony laid his ear next to Clint's belly button his abs showing a slight paunch. Just as he picked up on the thump-thump beneath all the intestinal noises, the scent hit him. Tony jerked up and stared at Clint.
"My apologies," he said in a low tone. He began to walk away without another word. Tony caught his sleeve.
Thor’s chest rose and fell in a gentle laugh. “I was blessed by our gods, little omega, I do not break so easily.”
"We don't have a range. I just shoot at the side of Tony's barn. Bruce painted targets." Clint added when Bucky raised an eyebrow.
The two marshal’s turned to see him standing in the door way with a lot of hickey’s and wearing a pair of Steve’s pants.
The beast didn’t answer just roared and punched the ground a few times. Mate saw. Mate saw. Mate saw. Babies unsafe. Hurt Mate. Mate saw.
Tony expertly flicked rubber bands at the back of the neck of Tommy Ellens who had purposefully and angrily deadnamed Natasha earlier that day. It was a highly amusing activity during sixth period English. They were reading Hamlet and Tony had already written his essay for the end of the course material this morning when he woke up at three a.m. and wandered into the library as was his usual habit.
“Thank you,” Steve said standing up and guiding them to the front door. “Have an excellent harvest and safe travels.”
All three of the prefects turned and looked Bruce up and down. Tony took him by the shoulder and awkwardly turned him around so their backs were to the prefects. “Look, my dear friend. You can be my body guard but that’s a last resort kind of deal, we are trying preventative measures.”
Steve stayed very still catching Tony’s eyes. Blue met brown and Tony couldn’t hold his flippant disregard anymore. “I thought you wanted to be president.”
Steve moved past cross and kicked the moving body over. It grunted and felt more like plywood than flesh. Steve crouched by the other body flipping it over to find Tony.
Steve reached out slowly making sure Tony can see and move if needed and pulled the man’s hands towards himself. His nails were ragged and his palms rough and covered in small minuscule scars. Steve covered them and finally set his eyes on the mark. Tony had clawed at it until it bled. Steve swallowed. His mate was of monstrous nature, Steve was certain. Steve cupped a handful of cold creek water and began washing away the blood. Tony flinched but allowed Steve’s ministrations.
Jarvis climbed his way to his post. "Jarvis, darling, I won't be able to guide you, will you be able to find accommodations?"
“Inform Mr. Barton, if you could please, that you both are safe and sound. I do not want to worry him or his brood.”
“No? Fight?” The monster shouted disappointed. Sam scrambled back and Natasha stood in front of him holding a gun. Steve didn’t move just stayed close to Tony, taking in his scent.
“Would you please do me the honors of sleeping in my bed tonight? You do not need to lay your sword in my hills but your comfort, that I am unworthy of, I find myself seeking, Captain Rodgers.”
Clint finally turned his head to look at Bucky and found himself nose to nose with him. Bucky was smiling. His hair was curling from sweat.
Tony blinked and Bucky saw for the first time the man smile with his whole face and body. “Of course.”
“You can come out, but you need to be able to speak,” Tony said steadily despite the shake in his legs and the rattle of his breaths.
Bruce was having a moment that Tony called his space cadet time. In which his eyes stare up at the sky and his mind begins calculating the chemical composition of stars and grass. He could spend hours doing so. At the moment he was thinking about the migration of clouds and the chances of rain coming from the heavy gray sky. Bruce felt unstable. He always felt unstable but it was like being in the middle of an earthquake then the ground opens up. It hasn't eaten him yet but he can see the yawning mouth. Coming for him. Bruce was certain that more people were looking at them. More people were whispering. It must be a money thing. It's always a money thing with these people. He couldn’t parse out who. He had like three friends and a couple of prefects he tutored.
Bucky leaned over the counter and pecked Clint on the forehead. “These things are meant to be kept in the bedroom.”
The air was dank and heavy around the basement. The smell of sweat and the harsh iron tang of blood covered every inch of every body in the place. Tony wove through the crowd knowing that the fight currently happening center court was a done deal. Bruce was an unstoppable god when given the chance. He was picking up cash for bets, cash for who wanted to fight next. It was part of the deal. There was a lot of pent up toxic rage that the School of Superior Boys created and here was where Tony let them get it out. It was also where he got the change for paying for his fighter’s scholarships and future college funds. Most were scholarship students without much brains but they didn’t want to leave. Home was worst than this hell hole given the chance. The fighting ring started as an accident. A boy decided that Natasha was just faking it to get some D and she challenged him. Tony gathered a crowd and now he had his own basement. The staff occasionally joined. Mostly collegiate TA’s and groundskeeper’s sons.
Tony smiled at the warmth of affection filling him. He watched Jarvis’ steady slotted eyes flicker for a moment. He patted the automaton’s leg once more and left him.
"Lieutenant Barnes." Steve closes his eyes and hid his wince. It had been a long night and an eventful morning. "Bucky, I mean." He amended.
Tony threw up his hands. "We'll talk about baby daddy's and dark pasts later when I've taken a bath and finished a bottle of rum. But right now, we need a date, so we can start preparing. Mr. Barton, I implore you, please just share the information with the two doctors in front of you and not your packmates."
Clint played with an arrow between his hands. “It crumbled shortly after you left. We had a lot of traitors.”
Thor laughed and lifted the bag off of Bruce’s shoulders easily. “I am too.” He shouldered Bruce’s backpack and they walked into the dining hall which was serving tacos.
“Good more prefects helping us the better, people listen to you guys,” Clint said sliding off of Bucky's lap to let him get up.
Clint sat atop Bucky whose cock sat heavily inside him. He wiggled and clenched and raised himself up a couple of times to thrust himself back down. His lovers’ cock was possibly the very best. He does not think he'd ever want another's. He stopped his ministrations. Clint wasn't going to be with anyone else and why should he. Bucky was a reticent asshole and would prostrate himself if it meant Clint would speak to him. That right there is true companionship.
Tony felt his blood burn under the bite. The fire igniting his veins. He clenched his teeth. The world was more or less a blur as his biology rewrote itself over the last two years. There had to be a fight. The blood pulsed between his fingers. They saw. They watched him…They…No. Tony forced himself up. He had to…
Bruce squinted up at the sunblocking god like figure in front of him. Thor. The transfer student and prefect.
“I hadn't.” Tony said cutting Bruce off. Bruce sat his thoughts overloading and turned his gaze to the dissembled automaton. It was the size of a two year old and the outside gleamed bright and ready. Bruce knew that the inside was covered in dried blood and runes. His eyes drifted over to Tony and saw the pink scars across his wrists.
Tony set the metal and polish down and picked up an arm that he began polishing. “There you have it.”
Tony nodded and laid down sideways on the bed eyes still open and blood still staining his shirt. He closed his eyes.
Steve turned to him then the other’s who he called his friend. He couldn’t sleep on the ground as an animal with Thor forever. Thor deserved better than that. At the faces of his own unit he could tell they wanted better than that for him too.
The fights usually lasted longer but in the silence of Stane’s screams people stood still parting to let Tony through. Tony spat again some of the flesh from his cheek came out. His eyes blurred and his stomach roiled. He kept moving until he fell against a tree. He didn’t think he could walk his right leg was collapsing on itself. His eyelids felt heavy. Someone was shouting. His eyes closed.
When the house was visible there were four figures and two babies and Thor flew towards them the wind and the air catching on him as he shifted to man and wrapped himself around Bruce. Bucky was more subtle walking up to Clint who was sitting as the twins crawled over the blankets. He licked Clint's cheek.
“As your doctor that doesn't mean much. You had been on suppressants and had run out only two months ago. You had still been on birth control when you were bitten…”
“So,” Thor continued as if he was unaware of everyone’s sudden discomfort when realizing they were sitting with royalty. “When our fellow brethren in the Isles needed help with the country Latveria I was sent to help out the forces. Me and the good captain met on the battle field. It was large hoard of automaton from the King and I was lighting up as many as I could but was unable to cover my back side. Men were dropping like flies and I felt incapable of winning. Then out of nowhere a glorious throng of wolves ushered in. One shifted effortlessly and in one breath and the next he threw a shield between me and stray bullet. Hours later with men lost but more automaton destroyed I found that man. I owe him my life and loyalty, now here we are.”
“Furious angel.” Tony said. Steve rocked him with a hush. The night poured on and their pack tried to clean their wounds.
The captain gave him a blinding smile. "Please call me Steve or Mr. Rogers. I've heard good things about you."
Steve was right to stay in the farmhouse. Tony was non-stop. He was up writing things down and melding things, the sound of his hammer heard ringing through all hours of day and night. Occasionally he'd collapse on top of Steve in the cot with Dummy pressed between them. Then he'd be up once more his minds pace almost audible in its whirl. Steve sketched and checked on the pack making sure that they were doing well. He also grabbed Bucky a few times for Tony to make measurements and one time take blood.
Steve took another deep breath. “Okay. So you think someone's trying to kidnap Tony and you want us to intervene?”
It dragged him away towards the side of the house and he found Steve near the stable’s, arms over his legs and eyes closed looking at peace.
Steve laughed and felt Tony’s hair shift with the sudden movement of his chest. “I think I can live with that. Get up. We have to inform the pack.”
“What in the Father’s land is that?” Stane gasped. The monster roared and tore through three more of Stane’s pack on it’s way to the woods before it was enveloped in darkness. Tony couldn’t breathe. Where was Steve? He hip checked Stane’s shocked body off of him, dirt and grass getting caught in his nail beds as he clawed his way up and away. What if that body was Steve’s? He ran towards the back of the house. Could he even survive?
"I am both sexually and intellectually interested in the man." Steve said. "I don't know why this is such a big deal."
The taller marshal gestured for his partner to stand. “We”ll see you soon with your court date,” he said tipping his hat.
Steve held onto his neck covering it with his palm like it would fix the hole that it left. Tony grabbed his hand. “I miss them.” He said quietly.
"Sorry, I hadn't meant to startle you," Bucky said. Clint slugged him hard, his gut clenching in a nerve-wracking fashion. The feeling left him, and he rubbed his hand steadily over the mound. Okay. All done.
“The steam carriage is just around the corner and the stable seemed to be untouched by the fire.” Steve said from Clint’s left.
Thor picked up Bruce and threw him over his shoulder. “Thank you, Bruce of Banner.” The two went up stairs very loudly.
Tony rolled over and onto him. "Are you certain? I could give you another type of meal, dear angel."
Jarvis was a staple in the living room sitting on the brick chimney that was relatively untouched. When asked why he wasn’t moving by a worried Clint, Tony answered, “He insisted the house be fixed first.”
Doctor Banner grabbed Thor and followed Mr. Stark out of the parlor and possibly to his workshop. The back door creaked close like the nooses of a hangman's gallery.
The pain was too much but the source clear as day. Tony. Steve struggled to the door when it suddenly stopped. The silence was almost as unbearable as the scream. The tidal wave of grief. He began to run. He was afraid what would happen if Tony unintentionally brought the house down upon their heads. Did he not know his runes and blood and magic seeped into the very foundation? Steve made it into the foyer when Tony screamed again.
“The weather was nice and there was a delicious smell of angry alpha,” Tony said his smile malicious. “I do love the smell of an angry man.”
"Or," Clint added pulling himself out of the chair with great effort. "A man like Tony Stark tricked you and was so secretive you thought wooing him might lead you to the information you seek."
"Is he okay," Bruce asked him one night. It was a day after they had found Natasha and Sam. Their estimate of two days appeared to be an underestimate and it was hard to say how long to go because Tony was struck silent with his fever.
"So, your leader," The Captain started. Clint felt his defenses rise. Tony was good to them and Clint actually liked their crazy little crew entirely endeared by their need for pack.
Tony then turned and looked through his desk until he found a bottle. He twisted off the top and flicked off the cap to take a deep burning drink. Alpha’s in the tavern. Clint’s alpha in the tavern. Tony could barely think beyond that. The idea that he might even… His hand shook when he went to take another drink splashing alcohol over his open wound. He hissed and found the med kit shortly. He took long gulps of whiskey between cleaning and bandaging the wound. He didn’t think about Clint leaving with the alphas. He didn’t think about the alphas taking Bruce too. He didn’t think about how easily Dummy and Jarvis could just be gone from his sight. He didn’t.
“Nothing.” Tony petulantly ran a hand through his mess of a hair and reached across the bed for his shirt.
The kitchen smelled of carrots and chicken. Bruce stirred the soup slowly adding yeast to thicken it. It had been two days since Tony started on his venture and two days of the Good Captain walking around the place and occasionally cleaning like a lost puppy. Two days of Bucky and Clint being heard fornicating any time of day or night and anywhere. Bruce was tired and weary and he missed his friend.
“The worst part is how many times you have to pee a day,” Clint said shaking himself. “The weight, the aches, the swollen ankles, nothing compared to having to pull yourself up to go pee.”
They sat in comfortable silence. Bruce's eyes drifted close his cheek resting against his knees. "I should check the bread," he murmured not making a move to get up.
Tony opened and closed his mouth several times and felt the hardened need to have Dummy nearby. "Oh?" He croaked.
Clint finally returned to the table in a tunic and a loose vest. Tony tapped his fingers mildly frustrated. He’d tried to buy clothes that would fit but according to Clint they were too effeminate. Bucky returned shortly after looking just done with the whole ordeal.
He just wanted to find his friend. His possibly dead friend. Oh god…What if Tony’s brain started bleeding and now he’s just a corpse they left in the woods. Jesus. Bruce was shaking and placed his hands over his eyes. He had to toughen up. He could beat up a kid three times his size he could find Tony in the woods with out a flashlight and not get caught. Bruce nodded and started to stand up but was caught blinded by someone else’s flashlight.
“Right.” Bucky said dryly. “Got any more stories?” Steve turned to him raising an eyebrow. Bucky shrugged. “I’m bored.”
Bruce lifted his head to kiss Thor. The other man met him half way his fingers pulling up with the motion and causing a startled moan from Bruce. Thor licked into his mouth and Bruce opened up allowing him to explore and map out what he wanted.
"Among other things," Tony said taking off his clothes. "I must tell you, once we find a home we may have to sleep outside while I set up the plumbing for a proper wash."
"Shh... none of that. Alphas, betas, muddle things up. Let us be this pack. I watch your back and you watch mine."
“Bucky, Thor and I will leave next morn for the court to discuss the dismemberment of the Hammer and Stane pack.” Steve said succinctly.
Steve nodded and led them inside so he could grab a piece of paper and some charcoal. They sat at what was once the bar but now more of a dining room.
Tony relaxed incrementally. "One of the best automaton builders in Wakanda made them. I should hope they would have a mind of their own."
“All of us have our moods,” Tony said sympathetically. “Some of them are more productive than others.”
Steve jerked his head and didn't answer. The two left together and when they entered the workshop Tony was just pulling out one of his rune brands from the forge.
Steve flushed. The noises that kept him awake the night before suddenly becoming crystal clear. “I see you had a wonderful evening.” He said dry.
"I do not think that will fit." Bruce said stuffing his hands in his armpits trying to cover himself.
Bastard. Steve pulled a strained smile. "That's great. I think you should proceed cautiously given that Doctor Banner appears skittish." Steve said. He started walking towards Natasha and Sam's room only to see that they were headed downstairs.
"Love," Bucky said as soon as he stopped moving, "as much as I know you like playing with my cock, if we don't get this going proper I'll have to take control and you would not like that."
When he turned back relived to see The Three Bitches just a few hundred yards away. Steve was bright pink. "I see."
The screams of the would be pack of bandits would later star in the edges of Tony’s nightmares. He dropped his body as far down to ground as it could go. Jarvis. Dummy was still in the carriage and safe, but Jarvis was out there. He crawled out staying as a wolf to keep his senses despite the better accessibility of limbs.
Tony pressed his palms to the table to repress the shaking. “’Tis not a problem. Make sure this doesn’t reach Stane.”
"You left an omega up the hill just after his heat. He might have forgiven you, but his pack most definitely want your head on a platter."
“It was cruel of me to bring you along. You’ve left war behind for comfort and I’ve given you my pain.”
At that moment Dummy rolled off the roof of the carriage and on to the soft grass with a loud clank. Tony let out a string of curses that derailed the following conversation as he fixed the small robot into a discussion about Tony's use of the English language.
Steve slumped into the desk chair and leaned back the wood groaning under his weight. "I would like to just kidnap him settle down in the nearest town then never see this place again."
"I'll tell him that I'm not in the right place in my life," Bruce said walking away. Tony nodded watching his back. "I'll tell him that there are better options." Wait. "That I'm out of my prime." No. Tony went after him but found Clint there around the kitchen table with Sam and Natasha. He stumbled to a stop before fixing his coat and striding inside.
“Tony, you stupid arrogant rich motherfucker,” Natasha said wrapping an arm around Tony. “We will still talk to you even if you’re not our boss.”
Bucky was actually pretty angry now. “Look, I know you’re long history as a virgin might make you a little dense but I love this man more than life itself and I need to go back just to see…” Bucky choked on the words. “To see if he’ll take me back.”
Steve laughed it sounded animal and strange to his ears. “That still doesn’t explain why you are here?”
“I handled it and as long as you trust Tony and I to handle it I don’t see the problem.” Steve said. He is body was sore from chopping and sanding wood. He was exhausted, and he was pulling his will to not collapse for the first time since the trenches in Latveria. He'd have preferred the trenches.
Tony laughed turning over to face away from Bruce. "Don't worry your pretty little head about it. Tragedy follows me, might as well grab a friend who follows tragedy."
“Come on in.” Tony muttered continuing in fighting through the hazy dreams of memories. They might have followed or not. Tony sat slumping against the overstuffed patterned couch that Bruce had picked, for it was much too floral for Tony’s taste. He pushed all the people in the area so far away that he didn’t even see Bruce until he was peeling blood stained fingers from his neck. Tony let him take his hand.
Steve and the two other prefects sat on one end of the room and Tony’s two best friends and the one who has been written out of his will sat on his bed.
“If we shut down then we don’t have set times and places where they can find us alone.” Natasha argued.
“God you're such a fucking idiot.” Bucky muttered placing his head in his hands. Clint flinched and started getting dressed.
Bucky followed at a quick pace. Thor’s shoulders were tense and near his ears with unbridled stress.
Stane’s teeth made a sickening squelch as they left the meat of his shoulder. Tony shoved away stumbling and falling onto his ass. He covered his neck and felt blood soak through his fingers. He closed his eyes and pressed harder. Oh god. He swallowed the vomit crawling up his throat.
Bruce who had been looking out of it the entire time suddenly focused and slammed hands on table. “You no go.”
“They burned down the workshop and while Steve was trying to get us out Stane must have taken you outside so they could burn down the house,” Bucky snarled. He was clutching Clint’s body to his chest as if that would make it all better.
“Hrm…No. I may be surrounded by idiots,” Hammer said looking at his cohorts. “But I paid off the police before starting this little stunt.”
Bucky laughed, his chest shaking with the motion and deepened the kiss. Clint suspected they had some time for a quick make out session before it’s time for bed and Bucky can pretend he isn’t a prefect and Clint can pretend he doesn’t beat the shit out of people for his tuition.
Tony straightened and took his arm back. His eyes wandered to the kitchen where Bruce and Thor were chatting then up the stairs. “At dinner. If we call a sudden meeting right now it’ll sound much more urgent than it is.”
Clint scooted closer so he was on Bucky's lap, excited. “Okay so, like we were talking it out and like Natasha is like ninety percent sure that Tonys going to be kidnapped.”
"Welcome to The Three--" Bruce tried his face scrunching up. "The Three- I can't do it Clint. It might actually kill me to say the name of our establishment."
Natasha and Tony met up in their bedroom after Tony got another dressing down from Headmaster Fury. She was sitting on her bed legs crossed and counting cash. There was a lot of it. Tony suspected that she was counting their entire stash.
Tony leaned back and laughed. His face lighting up with the motion. "Absolutely wonderful. Stay here," He said pulling off his leather gloves and pushing up his goggles. "I'm going to go get Thor."
"Just two, thank the heavens. If there were any more I fear what the lack of mobility would do to me," Clint huffed. It was just a short walk, they were maybe a mile away at this point, but Clint was already out of breath.
Sam looked around Steve at Bruce who was standing demurely behind Thor. He waved. Sam’s expression being incredulous was an understatement.
Bucky had to move his entire being to get the arm position right because it didn't feel natural against him given that it was strapped on with leather and the area around the amputation branded with runes. He shakily but delicately copied the the shapes.
Tony opened the heavy wooden door and gestured Steve inside. “What does that have to do with my dad?”
Bucky had barely gotten any rest. Clint was breathing harshly occasionally coughing the entire night. The rest of the pack was restless, and it was honestly a relief that part of the plan meant leaving them behind. Bucky was shattered, Clint had been so pale and for those few extended heartbeats when he thought that he was dead… Bucky’s hand clenched at Clint’s soot covered shirt. Clint stirred at the sudden tension in Bucky’s arm. Clint smiled at him. Bucky kissed his nose. Clint wrinkled the offending appendage.
Stane hummed and went to sit down next to him their arms brushing together. Tony’s stomach rolled and he heard growling from a corner.
"Doctor Banner have you gathered your notebooks. Let's experiment with Lord Thor's latent magic, shall we?"
Dummy was rolling around picking up clothes thrown about the yard. Jarvis followed behind plucking them dutifully out of his claw. Steve sighed and put the tray on the back porch. He meticulously took off his clothes folding them on the porch next to the untouched food.
“He needs his revenge.” Tony acknowledged. The beast retreated to the edges, but Tony could swear the color green tinted his cheeks despite how placid Bruce’s demeanor became.
"I sleep where there is a bed," Thor rumbled throwing a leg over Bruce and pulling him in like one large pillow.
"I may not be Lord Stark, but I am Mr. Stark and you have indeed found me." Tony sighed pushing his clockwork aside.
They were headed to a city surrounded in lights and laughter. The sky was darkening to dusk almost behind them and Tony pushed forward regardless dead set on sleeping in an actual bed. He wanted a shower. A meal made of seasoned meat. Or let the heavens bless him with stew. Any kind. To town they went. Bruce was so haggard he didn't even put up a fuss when they pulled over to refill the carriage.
Bucky took it and let Clint pull him onto the branch. Once he was settled it appeared that Bucky was going to talk something he hadn’t been very inclined to do before.
“You may leave, Captain Rodgers.” Tony dismissed. The man must have the restraint of a thousand yards of rope wound around a wild boar because he gently shut the door behind him. It was possibly more effective than if he had just slammed it.
"Hm?" Tony tasted salt on his lips. "Oh dear." He said wiping at the tears. "I'll be in my workshop tidying up." Tony fled the room quickly more out of sheer embarrassment than anything else.
Steve smiled and finished getting dressed. Tony followed shortly after because he was pulling formal boots with laces all the way up his calf. Steve opened the door for Tony who shoved him out first and closed the door behind them. The sounds of high pitched moaning filled their ears. Tony picked up a shoe near the base of the stairs and threw it at Clint’s door at the end of the hallway. There was a yelp and feet thudding towards the door.
“Thank you,” he said slipping her another pound and one of his clocks. “You are too kind fair beta.”
Natasha was walking the pathway to the cafeteria when Sam Wilson waved to her from a table outside. She looked up and nodded but didn’t stop. Sam instead stood up and walked with her inside.
Tony snorted. “My daddy beats me. So do half the other dads in this shit hole. That has nothing to do with me and a myth.”
Steve let go of Stane and went to stand behind Tony. Stane pulled himself up his shoulders shaking with good humor. He dusted off his suit.
Bruce’s eyes went hazy and he must have not dressed because Thor was in his space again. The alpha tucked his nose into Bruce’s neck, his wet hair dripping onto Bruce’s shoulder.
Clint shivered feeling Bucky's eyes on him as he led them home. He was carrying some of their bags and Captain had grabbed the rest and dressed.
Clint bit his lip and looked furiously out the doorway. "I know. I know logically that is what had to have happened. It just doesn't alleviate the hurt that comes when it never occurred to any of you fools to invite me."
“Anthony Lee, it was my alpha name in college when I was pretending to be above my class,” Tony said. He felt a melancholy smile twitch at his lips. “Mr. Stane came up with it.”
Natasha looked up trying to recall what Sam was saying. “I have.” She said at last. “I liked it.” She had finished
Bruce stood and checked the soup stirring it. “Clint is right, they are possibly false pangs. Where are they coming from?”
“That! That is why we are staying. We are staying for Thor’s thunderous laughter. Bucky’s habit of trying to catch things with an arm that isn’t there, Steve’s look of concern when Clint eats and Clint, Clint, his dumb jokes and disastrous personality. We are staying for that feeling.”
“Or you need to be able to adapt your boundaries.” Tony said trailing his fingers over Steve’s chest.
“What happened,” Natasha asked again looking over the haggard group of them. It was blatantly clear that they hadn’t slept in forty-eight hours.
Steve’s hands flexed on his leg. “He took care of me after my father died.” Tony smiled. “Encouraged me to take scent blockers so I could go to school but…”
"They must have loved you very much." Bruce responded sympathetically. Tony's smile tightened along with his stomach. He pushed his plate away.
Clint flushed. Bruce nodded understanding. Relieve stress for Clint before things got more complicated.
Steve grabbed Tony’s wrist and the other man moved closer sitting in his crossed legs thighs on either side of his torso. They were quiet.
Tony crinkled his paper when the laughter overtook him. Bruce opened his mouth to explain but his shoulders were shaking and face pink with trying to hold it in before he let it roll out of him in soft thuds. Tony looked around at his pack shaking in laughter and Jarvis’ own little head bouncing to the movement and felt warm and content, the pack bond singing happily.
Steve reached up and placed a hand on his cheek and wiped away tears. “You protected what’s yours.” Steve was cupping his face. “You can’t go back.”
“The one with your angry eyebrows and hair is Natalia. The others who's trying to eat his foot is Steven Anthony. We've been been calling him Stevie.”
“Mr. Stane killed Wrotty before he left claiming to be defending his property,” Sam said. “Nat picked that up when she asked to join his party.”
“There’s an omega sanctuary just a mile south of here.” She said holding her chubby toddler on her hip. Tony looked between her and the door.
Thor laughed and it bounced off the sky brighter than any lightning bolt. Bruce felt something warm cover him from head to toe. Just like that Thor’s presence became something a little more…One bidding war and two more fights then he was done.
Tony’s hand shook over Thor’s arm. It must be a testament to how much he trusted Bruce that he rolled his eyes and set down the knife. “I shall sketch then before the images leave me.” Tony muttered his hands skimming over paper until it found charcoal and a blank page.
Clint shrugged. "Very well. I do not trust your intentions Captain. Tony showed authority over your pack and this could be a way for you control even that but I can not stop something I am not participating in. Come, Jarvis. I would like to also see the sparks fly from Lord Thor's fingers."
"I left after my husband’s accident." Tony said clearly for Clint and Bruce. Clint leaned back and waited. Bruce's shoulders lost their tension. They now knew what to say. "I'm still not sure what you're implying."
The tavern had been pulled into one long table with the benches pulled together in order to hold the pack at one table. Everyone but Steve sat at the table. Tony was impressed. He felt bonds take hold. Natasha was more vocal than Tony had ever seen her as they waited for Bruce and Thor to bring out food. They’d resided in his den for a day but it had felt like years. Sam sat next to Clint and they were talking animatedly about hunting. Natasha and Bucky were in a deep conversation in Russian that from what Tony could parse out was about the proper way to clean guns.
"Stay afraid, my friend," Tony told him smiling manically. He tossed his shirt and pants through the window. "It'll help you while our companionship begins its bloom.
“I don’t know, Clint, possibly the gunshot wound and the as you said, ‘sack of potatoes’ on one guys shoulder,” Bucky said kicking Stane over.
Bruce and Tony shared a look. “I guess we are.” Tony said taking the comment positively. Bruce just turned his head away from the sky,
“I have foreign royalty living here as my pack, so it would be in your best interest to continue as we had planned.” Steve said handing his statement over.
“You smell like someone else.” Stane said. Tony opened his mouth to protest but all that came out was a startled pained gasp as Stane bit into the flesh of his neck and shoulder re-marking him. No. No. No, no, no, no…
Steve stood and looked down at the slimmer man. “It is rather serious given that Sam told us that your alpha had slaughtered a man.”
Mr. Stark took Steve's hand. "I suppose now is when I should tell you that I'm on birth control and suppressants."
"I knew you would have done that, so I put it in the bag with your arrows." Bucky said. "You'd never leave without it."
Bucky shoved Steve away and then fixed his hair. “Fucking, Clint and his stupid exhibitionist kink.” Bucky muttered.
Tony looked over his shoulder at Steve and it took his breath away. Steve tugged Tony gently over and finally forced himself to look at the bite. It was caked and disgusting from when Tony had reopened the wound. Steve wrapped a hand around the wound as if he were stemming the flow of blood. The guilt stabbed through him.
“Guess me and you are chopped liver, eh?” Bruce said to Thor dry as unbuttered toast breaking the silence.
“You used me, first!” Bucky jerked back his cheeks reddening. Clint tried to catch his breath but continued on anyway. “Stay for as long as you need, for we are a tavern after all. Just leave with in the week because we are not your home.”
“I’m going to clean your wound first.” Steve said slowing down. He didn’t have any intel and that was the most concerning part of progressing forward.
Tony didn’t know what to say he felt a smile slowly grace his lips. “Perfect.” He said succinctly. The room was quiet at that no one knowing how to respond.
"That they would." Bucky said carefully. "We've been on edge since you've been gone. That's why we've only stopped in town long enough to get information before heading somewhere more isolated."
Tony came back from hammering the sign in place and helped Bruce finish painting the last room. Dusk set in and Tony spun slowly. Their tavern. Completed. They just needed people.
Jarvis' small hand patted Steve's knee. "This is a problem, Sir will be unable to fix. When I go I go. I just ask that..." Jarvis' small head ticked side to side as he chose his next words. "When I do go you'll be there to pick up the pieces."
Bruce sat tenderly into the chair across from Tony. "He came to the kitchen late last night and I made him food. I don't know how these boarding houses, taverns or whatever are run so I thought it was the right thing to do. So, I made him food, he complimented me, and then asked of my profession and once his plate and half a weeks’ worth of chicken stew was gone he kissed my hand and went up to bed."
The night Tony left he hadn’t really thought beyond his runes and the automatons. This was not a problem in the beginning. He would hunt and catch enough food and be fine just as a coyote could be. It was spring and their movement was done mostly at night. Then his hair began to lengthen and he realized he hand’t stood on tow legs in nearly a week. The lack of pack bonds he hand so easily severed crawled over him. Jarvis would speak but there were moments in which Tony could not hear the words. Tony led Jarvis in the steam wagon he’d stolen along with his other useless possessions towards a town. Tony stood on two legs his hair over grown and his facial hair threatening to over throw his face when another shoe dropped. He was an ‘unbound’ omega.
"Good afternoon," Tony greeted. "Thank you for cleaning up, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. You may stay here as long as you please and are welcome back whenever it suits your fancy."
“Okay.” Bucky said his grip not loosening on Clint. He needed to tell Tony. There was something important. Then the screaming started. Clint shifted back wincing at the pain in his back and head at the sudden movement. He guessed Tony didn’t need to be told.
Tony touched his chest chin tilted in offense. “You insult me. Must be because you only have three friends.”
Tony awoke with a shout feeling teeth penetrating his neck and a hot hand pinning him down against his will. Dummy whirred to life at the distress his body hitting the bed roughly in its eagerness to go to Tony. Tony sighed staring at the wheels pointed up and turning at high speeds. Jarvis clicked on in his chair and got up, walking over and righting Dummy.
“Clint, Clint baby. Open your eyes.” Bucky was begging. Steve was looking around in circles and he caught sight of Tony and met him in the middle catching him in a tight embrace. “Where’s Bruce and Thor? We saw the monster come out. We need Bruce.”
Bruce blinked. The monster shifted from under his skin seeming to rip the small man open to make itself known. “Tired.”
Bruce was staring at him again that night. A look that meant he wanted to ask something but wasn't sure if he could. It was like a confused watermelon. It depressed Tony to see it.
Clint threw it over his shoulder and as he leaned down to kiss Bucky again they were shrouded in it.
Tony tilted his head towards him with a smirk. "The last man who looked at me with that intensity became my consort, Dr. Banner."
Her angelic voice rang through him and he felt the faintly familiar stirring within his loins. It’s not happening again. Not with… It’s just a mind trick. You took your suppressant and birth control not a day before. Just like that it was gone. Tony shifted back. He got off the bed and put on the first pair of trousers he could find and pushed back his hair.
“Bruce.” Thor’s voice was soft and his arms gently wrapped around him pulling him close. “It’s okay. Let’s go back.”
“Tony,” Steve said gently during one of Tony’s pauses. “It’s not just you and your wounds that you have to worry about.”
Tony saw Steve on the grass his head bowed over the stray piece of wood and paper looking up intermittently where Dummy and Jarvis were playing in the grass. It hit him then like a knife sliding through his gut the sudden urgent want of that domesticity. He could see it so easily a gentle alpha watching the pups play while Tony worked in his smithy. Gods.
Tony took out a flask and held it out. "To our soon to be new member, may they learn from their elders not to be disasters like us." Bruce picked up a cup of tea from the counter behind him and Clint his own cup. They toasted.
Tony watched them for a few beats. The sophomore that Bruce is pit against is twice his size and at least six inches taller. Bruce doesn’t let that stop him. He screamed and beat his fists against anything in the surrounding area. The sophomore looked shaken hesitating before coming close. Bruce came at him with his shoulder and knocked him off his feet and on to the ground. He cried out when his head smacked against the concrete pavement. Natasha stepped in.
He looked around eyes catching Steve's. They widened to dinner plates. "How long have you been here?" He asked.
They kissed for so long Bruce almost forgot about the stretch of Thor's fingers until they were gone. He whimpered missing the feeling. Thor sat back and positioned Bruce's legs on either side of him.
Steve hummed but didn’t respond the paper in his hands taking his interest again. Tony turned to watch the bots. Dummy ran after a large stick that Jarvis was throwing and falling over boulders. Jarvis eyes would light up then he’d wander over and slowly lift Dummy up and back onto his wheels again.
The taller one gave a very scathing look to his partner. He turned to Steve who was resolutely not looking at him.
Natasha repeated the same in Russian and a horrible realization over took Tony. They would have lied for him. They wouldn’t have liked it, but they would have done it. He’d built them protection and weapons from their blood for years and they would have lied for him.
Steve paced outside of Bucky’s room uneasy. The little tavern while colored warm and smelling comfortingly of omega made his skin itch and something unsettle. It felt like a chair that creaked too loudly and a door that opened without being touched. It might have been the war coming at his heels, but it was not that, it only came in the dead of night. Steve had been trying to pin it on the unfortunate circumstances that led to them in the tavern. The feral shifters attack, not an ounce of humanity left, the mysterious omega of Bucky’s that shows up pregnant and kills three men with a bow, the devilish omega in the woods. That couldn’t be it. He just knew he needed to leave. Find solid ground again. Where? He didn’t know but surely not a place that called itself The Three Bitches.
Tony called Jarvis over in lieu of answering. Clint's interest dropped, and he stared narrowed eyed at Tony. The barmaid dropped off their beer.
Tony swallowed. He looked away and ripped the hardened leather from it’s nail and flung it on. His hands grabbed the gloves and the scrap metal. Once the heat and the flames and the work of melding two pieces together and Dummy’s feverish little waves had awakened his voice did he answer.
