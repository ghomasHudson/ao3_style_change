"How can the greatest criminal mind ever not come up with better ideas?" Sherlock roared before Jim could mutter 'kill yourself' one more time.
Sherlock eyed her curiously before his gaze flickered over to his phone. He wanted John next to him, but just as that thought materialised, he heard John’s footsteps dying away as he descended down the staircase to check up on Rosie.
“‘Curiouser and curiouser, said Alice’,” Sherlock chanted. His eyes roamed around the kitchen, from the fridge to the teetering dishes in the sink, “Moriarty.”
John revealed that he often saw Mary around the flat. Mary would talk to him, the way Jim talked to Sherlock. John often answered Mary back, as Sherlock did to Jim. How ironic was it, Sherlock mused, that as they both continued indulging their demons, they missed out on what was real—each other.
“No matter, dear. Just come down when you’re done, and stop thinking about Mary. It’ll do you no good mentioning all that awful business in front of poor John.”
“Uh, ma’am—?”
An elbow to his side made Sherlock double over in pain. Something—a sharp, cracking whip—struck his wrists, and Sherlock let out a loud cry. One of those people had a face, a woman. The Woman, in his coat, her eyes vicious, and the riding crop held in her grip.
Jim produced another holographic projection of the 'possession termination contract' out of nowhere, "Just make a deal with the devil. I swear you won’t even need a solicitor!"
A dozen comebacks swam to the surface, but Sherlock bottled them all in. Jim supplied with any responses of his own, things such as
“It’s J-John...” She offered Sherlock his phone, her lip quivering. “The phone was ringing, and you were... you weren’t picking up, so I thought I should... I tried waking you, but you were... you were muttering...”
He peeked out of the door stealthily and was relieved to find her beginning to clear up the mess. So the mess was real, and he wasn’t hallucinating… Unless he was hallucinating Mrs Hudson too. No, but she was interacting with the mess, which was tangible… But what if both the mess and Mrs Hudson were his hallucinations…? Sherlock grabbed a handful of his hair, gritting his teeth in frustration. It was an endless rabbit hole he could keep going down forever, and the only way out of it was data. More data…
“Don’t worry. I’ll get you some biscuits to start with, dear. Mr Spaulding,” Mrs Hudson turned to the lawyer, “if you want to come back another day...”
“Drop it!” She grabbed Sherlock’s wrists in one lightning-fast move and slapped him hard across the face, making him stumble. Sherlock’s vision began to go fuzzy; he tried squeezing the trigger but to no avail. He was beginning to lose control of his limbs once again...
“Huh?” He felt John’s tug on his sleeve.
Jim screeched inside Sherlock’s head.
“Well, the visitor’s a lawyer,” Mrs Hudson trudged back up, panting from the exertion of climbing up the stairs, “claiming he was sent by Reverend Munroe.”
“Awfully quiet child you’ve got,” Spaulding mused with a curious expression. “Anyway, if you’re worried about her,” Spaulding tossed the notepad and grabbed another checklist, ticking things off of it, “it’s not like a demon can take another host mid-possession. If Moriarty’s been assigned to possess you, rest assured that you’re the only person he can affect directly. Dr Watson and his daughter automatically become off-limits. Sure they can still feel the presence of an entity, but they won’t be subjected to the same harassment that you’re facing.”
"Demonic possession has rules, genius," Jim finally drawled, but this time, he did not materialise in front of Sherlock. "Stupid, archaic laws and a mind-numbingly-long timeline to stick to. You can't just go around blowing up people! Had I known hell would mean more rules and contracts and demon laws, I'd have donated to a charity or something. That way they’d at least let me in heaven."
Sherlock opened the document the lawyer had sent him earlier. Predictably, it was written in indecipherable hieroglyphics and was beyond Sherlock’s comprehension.
Sherlock did not know.
“No,” Spaulding chuckled, “As your charming landlady introduced, I’m a solicitor. Started with the charming folks at Legal Aid, moved on to elder law; didn’t want those delinquents vomiting all over these Italian babies,” he pointed to his leather shoes. “Now, I do a mixture of contract law and civil litigation. But, sometimes, old clients refer me to whatever they think I could help with, and that’s how I make most of my business. One word, two syllables: diversification. That’s me.”
At ‘pathetic’, the showerhead behind Sherlock hissed to life, spouting hot water as if in retribution. Startled out of his skin, Sherlock nearly let out an ungainly yelp before reaching out to shut it off. His eyes went to the usual suspects: fire exits, bathroom window. The flat smelled the same. Nothing was out of place; therefore, no one had got in. It had to be an inside job. How fun.
“How sweet,” Mary drilled her finger in deeper, clawing at the muscle underneath with her nail. “Tell me, Sherlock. Tell me, and I’ll stop. I’m near your ribs anyway, probably just an inch from your oesophagus or something. John would know better,” she cocked her head at John. “Won’t you, husband?”
“Please let me know when I can come by tomorrow. May you have a lovely evening. And, please, check the invoices.”
“The magic of your mind palace, Mr Holmes,” Magnussen remarked lightly. “
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine.”
The cube of ice melted away, and John dabbed Sherlock’s bruise with a second one. The chilling whisper made Sherlock jump, but John, with his lingering touches and two square-inch worth of physical contact, held him in place. The inexorable draw Sherlock felt to this man, this impossible man with the greying temples and the stodgy woollen jumpers, was simply too strong for him to resist, too powerful to deny.
None of it was there.
“Nonsense! You, John Watson,” she let out a frustrated groan, “let me tell you, if you and Rosie still lived here, I would bake her a pie and a cake every single day, do you understand? That beautiful child... why can’t you just come back—?”
Sherlock frowned. A lawyer? What on earth was a lawyer doing here?
“Oh, Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson whimpered, leaning forward to help Sherlock up, “You hit your head, dear...”
Sherlock creaked his stinging eyes open. John did not respond, did not even seem like he was breathing. That was precisely how John looked before he was about to punch the daylights out of someone.
Before Sherlock could make out anything else, Sebastian landed a blow against his face, and Sherlock fell to his knees again, groaning. Tinnitus filled his ears, and Seb’s voice reduced to a distant roar as if he had suddenly plunged Sherlock underwater.
A tiny, sharp instant later, Sherlock felt the long-nailed finger twist out of his wound with a disgusting squelching sound. As soon as Mary withdrew her finger, cold air rushed to envelop and sting within his exposed wound. Without The Woman stepping over him or the water flooding over him, Sherlock felt untethered, drifting through space aimlessly. Some things hurt, and others didn’t, but Sherlock didn’t care anymore, did not have the capability to distinguish between pain and numbness anymore.
interrupting me for once?!”
The pitter-patter of barefooted steps descending the stairs reached Sherlock. John. He had evidently gone too long without a response, and John was coming down to check on him, and if John saw this... Sherlock didn’t know how John would react. He had gone too long without John’s presence. He had fallen out of practice with predicting his reactions. What if John deemed greetings written in blood an unsuitable environment for Rosie and left?
I have successfully inserted Gorbachev into a Sherlock fic without Mycroft or case fic, yay!
(buzz)...
And then disbelief followed, in waves and waves like tsunami, pulling Sherlock under. It was not a sudden flood that hit him, knocking him out. In many ways, Sherlock wished it had been, but instead, it had been a slow, creeping realisation that John wasn’t… that John had never moved in after Mary’s death. The realization was akin to watching the wave approach slowly, inch by inch, minute by minute while Sherlock remained rooted to the spot, alone and terrified, watching death itself creep towards him with agonizing leisure.
"—at least come up with a better—"
Sherlock snatched the packet from her. “Don’t. John likes it over there. And I didn’t lie about anything. Lying is tedious and achieves little for all the effort it takes.”
“Where’s John’s mug?”
He took a sip and grimaced. The tea didn’t taste at all like John had made it. The unexpected was always so jarring.
Sherlock turned to look behind him, toward the sound of the voice. Everything was pitch black as far as he could see. It was the kind of dark that sucked him in from the toes to the tip of his fingers like a swamp filled with crude oil. As black as the nights he’d spent being hunted by German Shepherds in Jastrebac’s dense forests.
Jim scowled and, displeased with Sherlock’s lack of enthusiasm, proceeded to examine the parchment he was clutching, muttering to himself as if ticking items off a checklist.
“Well, Mr Holmes,” with each word, Spaulding took a step away from Sherlock, “just hold on for a couple of hours till the cease-and-desist is ready, and your demon will leave you alone for some time. While I prepare the paperwork in my office, all I can offer you in the meantime are some warnings about the possession
“I do, sometimes...” he admitted, “To Mary, y’know.”
No. No, not that...
“And you know I take such good care of children!”
“You, Mr Holmes,” the elderly lady brandished an angry finger, “are utterly useless!”
“I’ll do my best not to let that happen, ma’am. Uh… if you’d like, I could have it translated for you?”
young man, not there!” Mrs Hudson protested, catapulting scowls at Sherlock and at the sofa John was sitting in, “You said you’ve been having these symptoms for weeks and haven’t done anything about it! Since I know you won’t do anything about it—and there’s nobody else here who’d seek some sort of remedy other than scoffing at things that are very much real—I took the initiative
“I’m just a poor boy,” Mary sang along, “I need no sympathy... Come on, Sherlock, open your eyes.”
“I remember she left early. I mean, who leaves a wedding early?”
When Mrs Hudson finally turned up, she took in the mess Sherlock had created in the kitchen and heaved a sigh of exasperation. She whipped her head in the direction of the bathroom as if sensing his gaze, and Sherlock ducked inside at once, turning the shower on so she couldn’t berate him.
“No,” Jim winced, massaging the back of his head as if someone had slapped him, “don’t poke me.”
There was Seb, in his college attire. Mary, in her terrifying assassin gear. Lestrade, wearing his constable uniform. John, in his army uniform beneath the Semtex jacket. Moriarty, in the bloodstained suit he’d worn at the rooftop, eyes dark and menacing, one half of his face shrouded in darkness. All of them seeming impossibly taller, towering over him. All of them leering.
“Moriarty is not Sherlock’s ‘man’!” John growled, an ominous edge creeping into his voice.
No, Sherlock tried to reassure himself, John was fine. Rosie was fine. They had to be. It must be a minor emergency if they were coming back for dinner. Everything was fine. He hadn’t fucked anything up. Rosie was a baby, and babies had non-demon-related emergencies all the time, right? John and Sherlock had just shared a moment, an unequivocal declaration of trust, the domestic equivalent of Gorbachev instituting
, but Sherlock did not say that part out loud.
Jim's floating voice let out a whine. "Yes. Rules and laws, ugh. Infestation for the first two months, followed by a mixture of oppression and infestation. Then possession. Ugh, infestation is boring, waiting that long just to write with blood or put notches on your bedpost. Literally. I thought I'd have fun, but, oh no!" Jim's moaning escalated to a screech, "Wishful thinking!"
Except... he wasn’t passing out. But the water came anyway, splashing over his face, over the cloth bag, and Sherlock gasped reflexively. He couldn’t tell if he was crying or laughing. Water roared in his ears, and his body conspired to make him gasp at the icy, burning sensation. Water invaded his mouth, speared its way through his nose and flooded his lungs. Kicking wasn’t working; there were hands all over him, and foreign laughter bubbled through whatever he could hear over the commotion. Terror as vivid as crimson gripped him by the throat and at the same time, he was dimly aware of his mind trying to block out the event.
Spaulding did not appear impressed by Sherlock’s attempts to make light of the situation. “Getting rid of the demon is my goal too. If you’d like, I can arrange for a medical team to keep watch over you. Shouldn’t cost you much. Just an additional hundred quid an hour for each doctor with three doctors working in shifts. Of course, I’ll charge my commission on that.”
Spaulding shook his head, “Ma’am, we need someone on top of Mr Holmes 24/7. Best if it were you. We need a clear-headed person on this.”
“I’m Dr John Watson,” John extended his hand to Spaulding, “I wrote to Reverend Munroe about the... thing. And this is Sherlock—”
John raised a hopeful eyebrow, “Yeah? About your... time away?”
“Do you see the entity around you, at this moment?”
Spaulding fell silent as if contemplating which scenario was worse. But when, even minutes later, he came up with nothing, Sherlock proceeded to present his ideas and... nothing. There was nothing he could think of. Even though there were fields of study he knew nothing of, like astronomy or coordinate geometry, never before had he struggled to come up with a starting point.
Finally, the phone chimed its incoming text alert.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock waved her away, “Now leave!”
“Occasional use to enhance my faculties,” Sherlock chanted automatically.
“Gone down.”
He shut the fridge door and looked around at his flat, really
“Oh, wasn’t there one? I’m sorry.”
Over the course of the interrogation, they all migrated to the sofa, as Sherlock found sitting up unbearable despite the aspirin. His shoulders ached in tandem with his head, as if he had trekked up a mountain for several hours without rest. The discomfort gnawed away at his joints and his patience and sapped his strength to tolerate every outlandish belief in the supernatural that the solicitor held.
Sherlock recalled Spaulding telling him on the previous day,
It had stung when Sherlock realised John still held the lease on the house he’d shared with Mary. Sherlock had, mistakenly, it seemed, assumed that John had taken the plunge and given it up when he moved back to Baker Street. It didn't even strike him that John had a fall-back living place, somewhere to go when... Well, when Sherlock undoubtedly became too much for him to handle. That their relationship had eroded so much over the years that John had permanent walls up high, ready to bolt at a moment’s notice, stung. Ready with an alternative to Sherlock. To 221B. Even after everything John had said before about being himself with Sherlock about being ready to communicate.
“Why do you keep saying that? ‘Make John come back’? John is here, isn’t he? He’s just...” Sherlock paused, trying to find the right word, but something churned in his gut like he was missing out on the one big, decisive clue right in front of him. “He’s just taken a sabbatical after everything that happened yesterday. He’s doing this for Rosie, you heard him. Rosie needs a break from all the demon... stuff. He moved out for her sake.”
He gulped, reaching out to shut off the grinder, cupping her head with one hand and hugging her close.
“Well, good news first: he’s probably not finished his possession training. Which means we’re likely dealing with an incompetent demon whose powers are still weak and hasn’t earned his license yet. A classic newbie who is either unfamiliar with or doesn’t take the complexities of demon law seriously. Big mistake, that. And the way you described him: the static, the juvenile messages, the crass infestation job? It explains that. Because experienced demons know better than to announce their identity to the host.”
. The bruises burnt to the touch.
“Oh, Sherlock, just give up already,” she sang. “You know how much John
“Are you an idiot?” she demanded, barely heard over the noise. Sherlock wondered if pretending to be deaf was the best way to get out of this conversation.
“Are you serious, Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock cried, curling up in his armchair,
That John’s “move-in” coincided with the day Jim’s possession began with that ‘hi’ written in the mirror with blood. That whenever Sherlock called John, he always heard John’s voice answer him back, felt his presence, but never actually saw John.
“She's with John... obviously.” Mrs Hudson squinted at him with suspicion as if wondering why he was asking such an absurd question. “At his place. Both of them... He said he was taking care of some urgent stuff there.”
“You’re done now, Junior.” The Woman pinned Sherlock’s face down on the cold floor, but Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off of John. He had to remember that this was not real, that this wasn’t actually happening, but it was, it was, and it
Sherlock tried to tear the tubes off of him with his free hand, tried to stop his hands from trembling, tried to push past the horde towards any exit, but there were none. The faceless people had cordoned everything off. Everything but the windows—
“Because,” John hissed, “after all these years… after everything, you’re still the same. You don’t tell me anything. You go off on your own, and... you need to stop being...” John motioned up and down at him as if to say ‘you need to stop being you’, “this. I can’t…” John began to push his chair, trying to get up. “I knew coming here would be a mistake.”
“I agree! Humpty Dumpty and I have very similar trajectories in life!” Sherlock bellowed over the noise of the blender pulverizing innocent vegetables into mush.
“Did you even have the slightest inkling of
Mrs Hudson gulped at his sharp tone. “He said... he’ll be joining you for dinner.”
John was instantly at his side and Sherlock grabbed his hand, bringing it to the epicentre of the pain. It felt like someone was breaking his ribs, one by one, with a hammer. It was the first time Sherlock truly felt there was something foreign and inhuman inside him, something that lashed out and raged against him with every word Spaulding said.
“Jesus, Sherlock, you’re burning up!”
He and John existed like ghosts in separate dimensions: they didn’t touch, they didn’t see each other all that much, they didn’t talk unless necessary, they didn’t pass each other in the flat even during the meal times, which Sherlock spent by himself on the sofa, and John with Rosie in another room. The ‘yeah?’ during the day he’d seen blood in the mirror was the only word Sherlock had managed from John since he’d moved in.
Some of the words kept getting eaten up by static, which was growing weaker by the second.
John shot Spaulding a murderous look over his shoulder. “We need to bring your temperature down, Sherlock. Let me get—”
“Oh, John,” Mrs Hudson chimed in, bemoaning, “you really should’ve brought Rosie with you. We always have such a lovely time here, don’t we? All four of us together: good food, talking about Sherlock’s quirky mind-palace goings-on and wall shootings...”
“Right,” John smiled humourlessly, displaying a threatening canine, “Go on.”
“The thing is, your guy, Jim Moriarty... He isn’t in my records. He is documented to have entered Hell on 16th of June, 2012. After that, timeline’s a bit dicey since the merry folks down there don’t have a concept of time per se. Anyway, since you’re under attack from this undocumented demon, well... it’s a bit of a good-news/bad-news situation.”
remotely similar about the situation now!”
dead people. Like you do, but in a different way. He loved you while you were dead; he felt so much guilt that he could never be truly mine. But now,
Irritation stirred in Sherlock’s gut.
“Drop.”
“No, no,” Sherlock waved her off, “Just wanna... get it over with.”
God, it was hateful.
But words turned to ash when Sherlock opened his mouth to say that. Pain shot out in his left wrist. Pain that burned like a white-hot knife had been pressed to his flesh. Right in front of John’s eyes, a bruise the size and shape of Jim’s hand appeared on Sherlock’s wrist, branding his white-as-a-sheet skin a vicious purple. John nearly leapt back in reflex, his eyes bulging and mouth ajar with horror.
Lestrade? No! Not real, not real...
“And, you are Mr Sherlock Holmes,” Spaulding overrode John’s painstaking introduction, almost leaping forward to grab Sherlock’s hand into a vigorous shake, “I’ve always wanted to meet you in person, Mr Holmes. I’ve advised some of your former clients back when I was still a moon-eyed believer in the power of law.”
Sherlock's upper lip curled in disgust and he banged the door shut with a
“Can you
As soon as he said that, the intense pressure disappeared from Sherlock’s eyes, from his limbs. No one was holding him down, but Sherlock didn’t dare move, didn’t dare to open his eyes. He held his breath and his mouth, knowing this was one of those situations where his glib tongue could not save him.
“Oh-ho, good boy!” Jim gave him an appraising look, “You’ve embraced the possibility much quicker than I imagined.”
As Mrs Hudson marched out of Sherlock’s bedroom, Sherlock turned to John again. He looked aged, for lack of a better word. Since the day before, when John—for the first time since Sherlock had returned from his exile—confided in Sherlock about what kept him up at 2 in the morning, about what he thought when he looked at Rosie’s face, or the lack of closure Mary’s death had brought upon him, John’s face appeared to have aged almost a decade. Or maybe it was just the play of shadows upon the network of grooves and wrinkles on his face that contributed to that effect.
“Uh... As—as I-I was, uh... saying, our guy is a newbie. His weakness is his, erm... unfamiliarity with possession laws, and once—and once his mentor demon obeys the, uh... the cease-and-desist, we hit Moriarty where he’s weak. Yeah?”
“That’s not—”
"Please. Stop," Sherlock seethed.
Mrs Hudson let out a giggle. “You know, I
man?”
“I’ll take one now if it’ll get you out of my flat.”
“I... dozed off.” Sherlock sat up against the backrest, rubbing his eyes. “The lawyer’s cease-and-desist, or whatever stupid lawyer trickery he might have crafted to keep away ‘paranormal entities’, didn’t work.”
“I could do this all day,” someone flicked him again, and Sherlock caught a brief look at the man. Tall, skeletal, French beard, eyes as dead as a shark, speaking in lightly-accented English. “Want to look at John Watson now?”
Sherlock simply nodded a mute assent, picking up the phone, “Sherlock Holmes.”
(buzz)
Spaulding’s phone gave a beep, and his eyes darted to it before returning to the purple bruise on Sherlock’s arm.
“I can hear your thoughts, Sherlock,” Jim countered in a mock-preoccupied tone.
“Oh, Mr Holmes, I don’t think you could afford my fees forever. Plus, this is a temporary measure. We have to draft specific contracts regarding your relationship with the demonic entity so that it can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion that suits both parties.”
“Goodbye, John.”
2) When someone grinned at Sherlock, all he saw was a chimpanzee begging for its life — this is taken almost verbatim from Dwight Schrute's line in The Office (US) S02E21 Conflict Resolution
“Now, what I’ll need is a timeline: the what and the when and the how. And rest assured, I usually do my first visit pro bono, so talk away as much as you want... But not too much. My hourly rate is £300.”
If Mrs Hudson thought her kitchen was a good place for secret conversations, she was sorely mistaken. But, to her credit, she grabbed a couple of unknown vegetables that Sherlock knew he’d hate, stuffed them into the blender and turned it on, and the deafening sound it made was better at soundproofing than the Clarence House cannibal’s basement.
(an encore of buzz)
“Something about Mr Spaulding bothers you.”
“I am a simple man, Sherlock, I’d rather state things as they are, even if I try my hardest to and usually am unable to. So, when someone like Vince Spaulding, Esquire comes around telling me how to communicate in triple and quadruple negatives, it makes me want to punch him. One only needs complicated words when they’re lying, and I hate liars.”
“I strongly disagree, Mr Holmes,” Spaulding said with a frown. “We need a medical professional with you 24/7. All my previously successful clients survived possession because they had a team of doctors looking after their symptoms. If you want, I can provide you with testimonials, but anyway... Being overpowered by the demon before both parties even reach a mutually acceptable contract is a genuine possibility… To put the matter in your terms, think about getting roughed up by goons just before you were about to settle out of court, but now you’re ready to settle for far less because you’re afraid for your life.”
(buzz)
“Sounds very... simple,” Mrs Hudson looked doubtful, “So, demons... get letters from solicitors like
“No!” Sherlock croaked. “Stay, p-please.” He saw flashes of light and heard the
Mrs Hudson swerved around at the noise, and Sherlock immediately transported himself to the crime scene, pretending he'd been the one to knock the glass over so that Mrs Hudson would suspect nothing.
. Now, look at you: a snotty, snivelling mess who can’t even tell what’s real. Eeek!”
He was back in Serbia. Again. With his whole weight pulling his torso down, suspended by his arms, his own body worked to asphyxiate him. Again. Two minutes before he would pass out because of lack of oxygen, and they’d have to unchain him, pour a bucket of icy water over his head and restart the interrogation. Again.
“Why don’t you?”
“Colleague.” John corrected automatically, and the tiles of 221B fell away like dominoes, transforming from the homely carpet to the cold, metallic walls of the Shad Shanderson bank. Bear horns blasted in his ears, fluorescent lights and semi-reflective windows attacked his vision, mocking him, and Sherlock clenched his eyes shut, feeling for the restraints on his wrists. There weren’t any. There was only the odour of iodine and ethanol and phenyl...
Oh. So this was the ultimate game plan. How apt.
Jim’s fingers pressed deeper into Sherlock’s eyes, and Sherlock bit down on his inner cheek to stop himself from screaming. The light amusement in Moriarty’s voice evaporated at once, replaced by the deep, dark rage Sherlock had once glimpsed underneath the sing-song voice.
Sherlock looked up at her in wonder. No one had ever said that to him. Need a night off, must take a night off, sure.
While Moriarty was in his head? How could Sherlock even tell if he did? Even if the lawyer did say he shouldn’t have them anymore, how could Sherlock be absolutely sure that he wasn’t having one right now?
Sherlock began banging his head against the floor, anything to black out, anything for it to stop—
“You need to ensure that Mr Holmes doesn’t communicate with the demon Moriarty. Think of it, when you’re trying to get rid of a boy who likes you too much, what do you do? You ghost him and block him, right? You try and get on with your life, but maybe he shows up at your flat. Maybe he begs you to ‘I just want to talk’ or ‘I just miss you so much’ or ‘I shaved for you, come get me’, blah-di-blah.”
“Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see...” Moriarty sang, and Sherlock instantly knew this was a trap. He squinched his eyes tighter, curling himself into the floor. This was it. He wasn’t ever going to wake up from this nightmare. This was going to go on forever without any end, and all he could do at this point was just lay back and let them do whatever they wanted to do with him.
“Very well. The demon Moriarty seems to be abiding by the stipulations set out in the cease-and-desist so far, so, let’s cover the... rest. Have you experienced any paranormal occurrences specifically related to manipulating your body in space? This might include levitation, muscle contortions, or—?”
was an affront. “Why? What’s wrong with the kitchen?”
“I know,” Sherlock grumbled. “You said.”
There, floating at seated head height in John’s chair, was a red balloon with a face drawn on it, held in place by a piece of string wrapped around a book. He peered at what seemed like a little black dot hanging from it. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a small spider weaving its little web around the string.
Sherlock stuck an arm out at her, toward her throat, but Mary simply giggled, passing through his fingers like sand.
“He… he didn’t move out, Sherlock.” Mrs Hudson fixed him with a hard, watery stare, and warm relief filled Sherlock for a minute before the facts barged in, demanding to be explained.
“Wow,” John’s voice was eerily calm, “So, we could just keep you on retainer forever, have you kip down to Hell once a month with a fancy notice? That would keep him at bay forever, right—?”
“Seeing as there’s a...” Sherlock chose the next words very carefully, for the decision of whether John would risk exposure to Rosie hinged on those very words, “paranormal presence in this house, maybe you’d prefer to...” Sherlock heard his voice grow weaker as he went on, “relocate?”
Mrs Hudson’s eyes grew wide and worried. “Take full control?”
Sherlock shot him a glare. “You mean your low-sodium utilitarian army rations.”
Sherlock glanced at the time. Maybe he should order in since there was no food in the house. Which was odd because, between John and Mrs Hudson, the fridge was always stocked up. Right then, another ping distracted Sherlock. Another text from John.
“And do you, Mary Elizabeth Morstan...”
“He’s right,” Spaulding jerked his head towards Sherlock, “The sooner, the better.”
“How did you get these, then?”
“Oh, Sherlock, goodness!” She let out a yawn, cranking an eye open. “Will you look at the time? I’ve been out like a light!”
Sherlock wished for the umpteenth time Jim would just shut up and possess him already, instead of passing nonsense comments. His eyes flickered over to the lawyer to evaluate his reaction. He looked spooked, but not out of ignorance of the paranormal. On the contrary, he looked like he knew exactly what he’d be dealing with.
Sherlock scoffed. “He cancelled dinner. He left. Actions speak louder than words, Mrs Hudson. If you knew that, you’d have seen through Mr Chatterjee long ago.”
John didn’t seem too glad about the development, even though he was the one who had manufactured the situation. But after a moment of contemplation, he nodded his assent.
"Just kill yourself," Jim sang, sending a glass of water crashing onto the floor, "It's a lot less effort."
John shook his head. “I can’t believe you remembered my favourite.”
John shot him a hard glare, the one that Captain Watson probably used to give his underlings, and that look sent a tingle down Sherlock’s spine despite the situation. Jim wolf-whistled and Sherlock silently wished Jim would resume telling him to kill himself instead of undressing John with his eyes.
There wasn’t enough oxygen in the room and a terrible weight pinned Sherlock down on John’s lap. He couldn’t see it, but that didn’t stop it from pinning his waist down into the sofa and choking the air out of his lungs. Sherlock tried to breathe, but two invisible hands seized him by the throat, cutting off his air supply slowly, so slowly until the world began to blacken and Sherlock simply let go, stopped hanging on...
No. Not Mary Elizabeth Morstan. None of those words.
Mrs Hudson fixed Sherlock with a hard stare. “I heard him talk about having a doctor around.”
Sherlock felt the bed give a dying creak as he shuffled to his feet, glancing at the clock: it was 3:00 am, and if he had the ability to process time, this definitely wasn’t a dream. He concurred with the voice; it was not a chemically-induced hallucination; John obsessively checked their mail and groceries for signs of tampering and contamination, especially since Baskerville, and ever since he’d moved back in, John continued the practice with even more gusto on account of Rosie. Being a detective with a horde of enemies and a highly publicised address required precautions.
“But, his things—”
“Mr Spaulding, I think Sherlock should—”
The ground rose to meet him, and Sherlock felt his head strike the floor with a sickening crack. This was it. He needed to pass out, needed to hit his head so hard that everything just stopped happening and he just...
A growl rang in Sherlock's ears and then vanished abruptly. Almost as if it had taken offence at Sherlock's words.
That accusation rumbled from the deepest, darkest pits of Sherlock. The part he didn’t know why he was ashamed of. He hadn’t realised how not getting the attention he craved had made him all the more desperate for it.
“Now, now, behave,” Magnussen tutted, picking up Sherlock’s lifeless hand, caressing it deliberately as if he owned it. “Let’s be civil here. Mr Holmes has made his promise, and now we must keep ours. Ms Adler, Mr Moriarty,” he turned to The Woman, “if you’d do the honours.”
“Reverend Munroe, that priest who baptised Rosie,” Mrs Hudson said, “Don’t worry, I will ask John for his permission later. His daughter’s priest, his business and all that.”
Several someones carried Sherlock to the balcony, and he took a peek down below as usual. Why was it that every time he jumped, the street below felt so far away, and its pedestrians seemed like ants roaming all over a dead tree trunk?
“Right,” Sherlock uttered, his throat slightly hoarse from the screech he had emitted under attack, “There’s something you should know.”
At that point, the throbbing in Sherlock’s ribs grew exponentially and he let out a choked gasp, reaching instinctively for John. “Ah!”
“Right,” Spaulding blinked, peering at Sherlock, “Mr Holmes, I probably should also mention that since the demon Moriarty is inside you, you are most likely to experience hallucinations. Seeing things that aren’t there, encountering spatial distortions. Often the best way to tell if you’re hallucinating someone is to see if they’re interacting with tangible objects or people—”
But Mrs Hudson wasn’t having any of it, for she glared daggers at Sherlock. “You keep your mouth shut, dear! John,” she turned to him, “the last time you cut me out of your life, you grew an ugly moustache!”
Sherlock had gone to retrieve the blood samples from the fridge but, upon seeing Jim's dismembered phantom head grinning at him inside the shelves, had lost his scientific temper at once. Jim tailed Sherlock everywhere: in the bathroom, or downstairs while he fixed Mrs Hudson's television, or while he tinkered with his haemoglobin experiment. It would've been satisfying to chuck a book at phantom-Jim's head, but everything just went right through him, so it wasn't worth it.
Someone had written to him in blood. On his bathroom mirror. And the message was ‘hi’. A horrendously pathetic greeting that resembled a two-year-old’s first attempt at writing.
“Well, I’m sorry if I’ve been a little preoccupied these days,” Sherlock snarled, hating himself the minute those words left his mouth because
And then came the bile, and the vomit, and Sherlock doubled over into the sink.
Sherlock dropped those thoughts, trying to focus on his current problem. He grabbed his phone and fired off a text to Vince Spaulding.
, or this chapter would’ve taken longer to write.
because John was all about voice modulation and dry humour and this measured, muted John felt a hundred times worse than a pestering demon Jim Moriarty.
From then onwards, it only grew worse.
Words seemed to elude Sherlock.
“But-but...” Spaulding opened and closed his mouth like a dying fish. “If it’s the rate you’re worried about, I offer a seniors’ discount—”
Jim removed his fingers from the back of his head; there was dried blood on it. Blood that did not permeate the air with its coppery tang. Jim put the fingers to his tongue, licking it with such vigour that it made Sherlock want to throw up.
John did a once-over of Sherlock, somewhat amused, “You did what?”
The voice gave a snigger, now much clearer.
“This is the unfinished draft of the possession termination contract. It contains the stipulations and the conditions upon which the demon, James Moriarty, will either give up or take full control of the body and soul of the human, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock could practically hear John grind his teeth as he stalked off after Mrs Hudson towards the kitchen. Feeling the headache fading with each moment, Sherlock directed his full attention onto the man, ignoring the ache in his joints.
It wasn’t black anymore. It was Baker Street in the wee small hours of the morning when yet-empty teacups clinked against each other, and soft rains of dust shimmered in shafts of golden morning sun over John’s empty armchair.
“You thought you could get rid of me with one stupid demon lawyer?” Moriarty leered at Sherlock, flicking out a wet tongue and slurping Sherlock’s cheek noisily. Sherlock recoiled in horror, but Mary’s finger kept him in place, kept him from struggling. “Getting rid of a demon might be easy-peasy, Sherlock, but what about her?” Moriarty glanced at Mary. “Or her?” He arched an eyebrow towards The Woman. “Or him?” He licked his lips indulgently, grinning at Magnussen. “Or the boys that hunted you down in Serbia? What about the demons inside your head?”
Sherlock shook his head to clear away the traitorous thoughts.
Spaulding settled down on John’s armchair, and Sherlock heard a mutter of protest from behind him.
Sherlock frowned, casting a sidelong glance in Mrs Hudson’s direction. Thankfully, she did not appear to have heard that cheeky comment, otherwise, with her temper flaring, she was perfectly capable of tearing John a new one.
Jim nearly retched,
He turned to John for one of his witty quips and what he saw made him do a shuddery double-take.
This was the first time John had directly witnessed a supernatural consequence of Jim's infestation. And it could only get worse.
So he tried to hide it. As much as he could. Long sleeves, no walking around the flat practically naked. No hovering around John.
Mrs Hudson returned with a bag of peas and handed them to Sherlock, resuming her post behind Sherlock like a mother hen. The stinging, ice-cold sensation brought back some of the pain, but the injured area soon grew numb and Sherlock found he could now focus more on the charlatan John and Mrs Hudson had invited into their flat.
John’s smile in response was wistful. “Really puts a new spin on the self-proclaimed most observant man in the world.”
As if on cue, Sherlock felt his body go limp and drop to the floor like a house of cards. An intense cold swept over him as Sherlock felt his breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, seeping into his heart. Pain erupted at the back of his skull as his head hit the tea table, before he lost vision, and consequently, all consciousness.
Sherlock scoffed. This was precisely the reason why he never found any merit in the idea of talking things out with John but, no matter how tempting, he knew better than to blurt that out. They had just re-established their fragile camaraderie and Sherlock absolutely could not afford to go back to the way things were.
“No,” Sherlock folded his arms, deeply unimpressed, “You’re terrible at this.”
“Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson chastised, a fond smile lighting her face up. “Fine, I’ll make your favourite too if you must be like that. After everything that’s happened these past few days, you deserve a night off.”
One last ping:
“Do it again,” Seb pressed his lips together. “I’m loving this!”
Unable to ignore Jim's annoying drawl, Sherlock had settled for curling up into his armchair, fingers in ears, gnashing his teeth in an attempt to block him out but to no avail.
“‘Nail a plank across the window, and all your problems would be over,’” Seb tapped on the window behind his chair. “Well, safe to say, I never followed your advice.”
Mrs Hudson disappeared down the creaky stairs, with her customary exclamations of “that hurts” and “oh, my knees”. Finally rid of her, even if for a short amount of time, Sherlock finally seized the opportunity to turn on to John.
“Hang on,” John frowned, “I thought you’d already had your will done!”
“My condition?!”
The intimacy, the glasnost, was all a lie concocted by Sherlock’s greatest weapon. His own mind.
Sherlock frowned. “Money isn’t an issue...”
Those words seemed to have a strange effect on John, who looked up from his plate with a glare. “Oh?” he said in that voice that meant danger. “Really?”
“But-but...” Mrs Hudson shook her head as John growled beside her, and Sherlock could tell John was growing more and more doubtful about Spaulding, “Why? Why would they, I don’t know, do this?”
“Sherlock Holmes, I’m arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping...”
Just then, five seconds after Skull had flung itself onto the floor like a snubbed Victorian maiden, it rotated by sixty degrees and glared at Sherlock with its socketless eyes, and Sherlock knew something was up.
Sherlock arched a sardonic eyebrow. “And that’s supposed to frighten me?”
“End of an era.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but emit a pained grunt in response, and all amusement drained away from John who hung on to Sherlock’s shirt sleeve as if he were in the danger of disappearing.
“Wait, wait,” Sherlock put a hand up, “What do you mean ‘possession training’?”
He was with John. John was there with him, and nothing could touch him anymore.
“I told you, dear, I’m the one who called,” she corrected, placing a cup and Sherlock’s tea mug on the counter with a clatter. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw only his mug in the dish rack. John’s RAMC cup was noticeably absent. His eyes flew to the dishwasher, then to the sink, the usual places. It was nowhere.
Then the facts were muffled, and all thoughts erased by the sheer betrayal by his own senses, by his own muted mind, by the horrible, horrible injustice of it all.
“No.”
of whips cracking in the air. It was as if he was back in Serbia all over again. The worst part wasn’t that there was a demon inside Sherlock; it was that he was being forced to relive his worst memories, and he’d rather have levitation and projectile vomiting than this.
(buzz)
Lounging in John’s armchair, Jim chuckled at John and Mrs Hudson’s determination.
“Give it to me.” She held out her palm at him, but Sherlock held onto the gun tightly, trying to aim it at her.
“You might think you’re a marvellous detective, Sherlock Holmes, but you are simply atrocious at this! Don’t you see that you need John, and John needs you? He’s been trying, and here I thought…”
But, for the first time, Sherlock did not mind the rapid, mind-numbing monologue from Moriarty or the putrid smell of flesh that emanated from the kitchen. John made some vague comments about it, often just as Sherlock could discern the odour, but never went beyond explicitly questioning what the source was. Perhaps he just assumed that Sherlock had a severed head or an assortment of toes tucked away somewhere in the flat. Of course, Sherlock knew that rotten smell was actually a consequence of Jim’s growing demonic presence.
“I-I had really hoped you’d bring Rosie back.”
Sherlock pressed a kiss to her hair because he didn’t know what to say. Still, he tried. “I know, I…”
Suddenly, the black was gone. Sherlock wasn’t drowning anymore, he wasn’t tied up anymore. He was simply gasping, and with his hands finally free, he grabbed at his throat, trying to gulp as much oxygen as he could manage.
Spaulding promptly ignored his question. “With your history of drug abuse—”
Sherlock frowned. John had insisted that Sherlock inform Mrs Hudson of the demon situation, just to make her aware of any dangers lurking, but wasn’t worried about his own daughter?
“I ask her what I ask you,” John’s fingers began to stroke Sherlock’s wrist up and down, and Sherlock’s heart picked up, “She never answers.”
“I hired you to do a job!” Seb yanked his head backwards by his hair, and Sherlock instinctively gasped for air. “Don’t get sidetracked! I paid you five figures! Check the invoices!”
He hoped for air, but fire was all that came. Wet, icy fire that stabbed at his windpipe, burned in his lungs.
he?” The flat was quiet. Suspiciously quiet. “Where did Rosie go?”
Sherlock decided to summon his last reserves of energy to open his mouth and interrupt, “Yes, I know he’s a newbie. I told him that and he got offended.”
Mind palaces can be so... inconvenient, can’t they?”
“Yesss... let me... please...”
“When you fainted, did you feel a chilling sensation? Like a wave of cold that knocked out all sound?”
“Uh, Vince Spaulding, Esquire, at your service,” the lawyer peeked from behind Mrs Hudson, his eyes staring rabbit-wide at the headphones which now lay in its final place of repose, “Reverend Munroe sent me. Rest assured, folks,” he tipped an invisible hat at Mrs H and John, “You are now in good hands!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. One more word from her, and he’d have to cart her off upstairs to give her a good talking-to. Sherlock had a ‘Vatican Cameos’ code with Mrs Hudson, but he was fairly certain the woman wouldn’t recall it in the time of need.
Sherlock shrugged. Many of his clients believed in the occult, prompting Sherlock to do a thorough study of the subject. Criminals often resorted to Biblical patterns, and a working knowledge of religious texts and mystical practices allowed Sherlock to see predictive patterns in their murders (sacrifices?). Of course, Sherlock didn’t believe in any of that nonsense, but since he couldn’t sleep and was utterly bored, he decided to indulge the hologram in front of him. After all, the hologram seemed to be able to hear his thoughts and, since none of his rational hypotheses seemed to explain it, Sherlock was willing to allow a supernatural explanation some leeway.
“There’s no point to this nightmare, Sherlock!” Moriarty barked in his ear, making Sherlock curl tighter into himself, trying to look away. “This is just your brain making a montage of the worst moments of your life because that’s just what it likes to do!”
At the mention of John’s name, Sherlock’s eyes flew open, only for him to be flicked in the eye. As Sherlock flinched instinctively, there was an outbreak of hearty laughter and delighted clapping around him.
“Look at her. She thinks an exorcism actually works,” He subsided into hysterical bouts of laughter. “She actually thinks telling me my name and politely asking me to leave in Latin will actually make me leave!”
“I-I don’t work for hire!” Sherlock spat back.
to me, no?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, drowsiness sweeping over him as Mary ran her fingers in circles in his scalp. Her other hand ventured southward, from his clavicle to his chest to the bullet hole she’d put there. She began encircling the wound and, without warning, dug her index finger into it, jolting Sherlock back to painful consciousness once again. This time, Sherlock did not have enough strength to keep in his screams, but Mary clapped one palm over his mouth, pressing down as if determined to snuff the life out of him.
“Oh that,” Mrs Hudson let out a sigh of relief as if she had expected John to say something far worse. “Wait, I thought you were taking a bath earlier, weren’t you?” She sniffed the air. “Well, clearly not.”
Turned out there was no end to Sherlock’s misery because his loud exclamation had brought Mrs Hudson bursting into 221B and consequently upon Sherlock trying to be quiet about his illicit laundry.
John’s cerulean eyes widened with the most marvellous kind of worry. He placed a cool hand over Sherlock’s forehead, and then felt for his throat. The feverish heat fizzled out of Sherlock in response.
Sherlock tried not to show how relieved he was to hear that he wouldn’t be a danger to Rosie.
"I'll get some ice," John muttered, and marched back towards the kitchen. For a moment, Sherlock imagined he heard the ghost of 'Bachelor John Watson' call to him and he followed after John, like a man possessed.
“Well, it’s just as clean as it used to be when...” she trailed away, as if biting her tongue off for saying something she shouldn’t have said, “Speaking of, could you tell John he left Rosie’s diaper bag in my flat?”
“Ignore him,” Mrs Hudson offered to a bemused Spaulding after she had recovered from Sherlock’s outburst, “He’s hit his head.”
, his appetite completely lost. He now understood why John had taken issue with a severed head in the fridge that evening.
“No, thank you. Dr Watson and Mrs Hudson are all I need.”
“That, combined with the letter of engagement, ensures two things: first, that we have client-lawyer privilege, which means whatever you and I discuss regarding Jim Moriarty cannot reach Jim Moriarty. At least, that’s how client-lawyer privilege works in the supernatural domain.”
Gulping, Sherlock opened it and was met with more proof that something was horribly, horribly wrong.
“And he just offered to do my will for a special discount,” Mrs Hudson said, “Sherlock, do you mind if I borrow him after?”
Sherlock frowned. How did John figure out Sherlock had full plans to use Mrs Hudson as his backup babysitter nine out of ten times? Scratch that, he thought. John knew what he was like.
“Concerns?!” John let out a humourless chuckle. Sherlock tried not to look surprised. Who was this John with the strange slicked-back hair? Where was the man who had held his hand and been so frank with him only a day ago?
John snorted from the kitchen. “I am more than prepared to bet that’s exactly what happened.”
When Sherlock went to heat a sandwich John had probably left him in the guise of a wordless breakfast, Jim's head was waiting for him inside the microwave oven.
Without bothering to reply, Sherlock pocketed the phone and frowned at his greasy reflection. There was still a speck of blood on the mirror, right between his eyes. Sherlock could have sworn he had wiped it clean, but he didn’t dwell on it too much. Not when only a teensy dab by a wet flannel could remove the sordid evidence.
“Feeling nauseous? Disoriented?” John checked his eyes. There was a flashlight in John’s hand, but oddly enough, Sherlock didn’t feel much of a pupillary response to the light.
Sherlock swallowed. Perhaps, it wasn’t John’s footsteps he had heard on the staircase.
Sherlock started with the item that should be easiest to find: John’s mug. Five minutes later, he had emptied all the kitchen cupboards and arrived at the impossible conclusion that all of John’s things had disappeared. His mug wasn’t in the flat. But… how? And how had he, Sherlock bloody Holmes, not noticed in the morning when Spaulding was here? Had John… moved out? Within an evening? Or was Sherlock’s mind simply making things up now? Was he seeing things that weren’t there? Or not seeing things that were, in fact, there?
Sometimes, Sherlock even said John’s name out loud, just to see if John could hear him. But, through the barrier of brick and mortar and years laden with resentments and things better left unsaid, John couldn’t.
Sherlock felt John’s thighs quake under his head as he watched John enunciate each word with murderous intent, but Sherlock couldn’t hear a word. Tinnitus ensued in his ears and Sherlock just wanted it to stop. Wanted it all to stop. Sherlock’s breathing seized up in his chest, and he felt like thrashing. He could hear muffled shouting but couldn’t discern its source. The pain in his head reached such a pitch that he nearly retched. If Jim Moriarty was seizing control of his body, this was the physical manifestation of his fear, and Sherlock could feel in his very bones, Moriarty’s fear and the rage of being cut off from getting what he wanted.
Sherlock grimaced at the distasteful comparison.
Sherlock gaped at the both of them—not just at how Mrs Hudson began every question with a ‘do you remember, John’—but at their food-related shenanigans on him. “You two did
It took Sherlock roughly two more painkillers to help him even keep his head upright. Spaulding, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to write up a letter of engagement, promising that even if handwritten, it still counted as the real deal. John, who had been expecting something of a more ritualistic nature, excused himself to making tea as he mulled over the new information the lawyer had provided him. Sherlock could hear his frustration in the sharp way he slammed cups and saucers onto the counter. The kettle screeched as if in protest of the mistreatment of its fellow crockery, but John paid it no mind.
John never seemed to feel Moriarty’s presence the way Mrs Hudson could.
“Open your eyes, or John dies.”
Sherlock blinked.
Sherlock nearly jumped.
“I do.”
Doc review? Seriously? Sherlock knew the words the next text would contain.
He tried a brief smile up at John, but couldn’t stretch his lips adequately. Mrs Hudson’s worried exclamations did not help. So, Sherlock turned his attention back onto the newcomer, who was peering at him like an owl with poor depth perception.
Sherlock took in the scene before him. Kitchen counter, knife block, cup, plate, kettle. Then he closed his eyes, stretching out his fingers, feeling for the things that he had just seen.
“You don’t tell John that. You don’t tell anyone that.”
As Sherlock said that, Mrs Hudson’s smile fell, and so did John’s. They both shared furtive looks.
called a priest?!”
But the oddest bit was Sherlock saw no sign of religious iconography on the lawyer.
Spaulding caught his eyes and straightened in his chair. “You’re under attack right now. You’ve already permitted him to move in, haven’t you?”
“W-what?”
John’s shaving cream.
“Before bringing up ‘concerns’,” Sherlock began, keeping his voice level as if John were about to fling himself off a bridge, “perhaps finishing lunch would be prudent—”
And, taking advantage of John’s absence, Jim's disembodied voice had kept whispering 'kill yourself' over and over in Sherlock's ear until it had established itself as a constant, irritating buzz in Sherlock's head.
She flipped on the bedroom lights without warning, making Sherlock recoil from the bright glare. Why was she here, and not John? Was John alright? A horrible thought occurred. Had he just pissed off a demon by serving him a cease-and-desist notice, and now, somehow, Moriarty had taken his anger out on John? Or on Rosie? And that was why they’d left? Could demons do that? Sherlock tried to recall what the lawyer had told him, what he knew about traditional demonology. It all came up woefully short on explaining how a demon affected the family of a host.
John grimaced at that.
He spread his arms.
It almost felt as if John was looking like that on purpose, because the next question Sherlock had to ask would be slightly uncomfortable, and worse so with him looking so young and dashing.
Sherlock frowned. “What pun?”
Namely the fact that John had bothered to pour just one cup of tea for himself. None for Sherlock, or Mrs Hudson. But before Sherlock could dwell upon that thought further, a fresh bout of pain erupted near his medulla and Sherlock decided he’d be better off lying on the sofa like a useless person. The more the lawyer talked, the worse Sherlock’s headache got.
"Kill yourself."
“If you have to know,” John continued in that same low, threatening growl, “I only came tonight because I was worried.”
Sherlock heard John answer him in a vague ‘Yeah?’ from upstairs. Sherlock’s eyes flickered towards the bathroom mirror, where he saw his broody reflection distorted by a monosyllabic word written across the mirror with something thick and crimson.
“What are you on about?”
Mary’s head suddenly turned towards Sherlock, her face still a blur, towering over him while John smiled at her with bright, happy eyes. Tubes were coming out of Sherlock. Tubes in his veins, in his mouth, in his nose, in his chest. Something was dulling his senses, and he tried to move, tried to fight it, but his body wasn’t his own anymore. Sherlock struggled to twist and twist his way out of his bounds but his struggles came to no avail. His arms had been restrained again; so was his torso.
“What about her?”
Sherlock wanted to hiss back that the communication was atrocious and the voice wasn’t interesting enough to be eavesdropped on. Still, he refrained from articulating his thoughts into his own head. Because he was now certain that that’s where the voice was coming from.
the dead one, and I’m never coming back. John is long gone, and now he’ll never truly be yours.”
“Stopped.”
“I’m Vince. Not...” the lawyer arched an eyebrow.
John looked like he desperately wanted to be launched into space at that exact moment. “It’s not that—”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “An exorcism?!”
“We should go back, Mrs Hudson—”
“Yeah, colleague’s more like it,” Sebastian Wilkes remarked smugly in John’s voice. “I was scared for a moment when you said ‘friend’, John. I thought he had a gun on you or something.”
Rosie?
“Oh, nonsense!” Mrs Hudson waved his words away. “It’s just some risotto!”
“And,” John’s expression grew increasingly distrustful by the minute, “the bad news?”
Lot less effort indeed.
will take care of him,” John seethed.
“Why don’t you talk?” John murmured, almost to himself.
Mary stopped wriggling her finger around, and Magnussen appeared beside her in an instant. “Even if he asks?”
“Let me guess: you’re a demon now?”
John’s eyes snapped up at that and locked in with Sherlock’s before lowering them to his lap once again.
“Stop that!” Sherlock croaked as loudly as he could. Something tugged at both his arms, something heavy and metallic and bruising, and he realised there was no ground beneath his feet. He tried to inhale, one desperate attempt, but any movement seemed impossible.
Sherlock glanced from his half-full plate to John. His hair was different, changed from how it had looked only yesterday. It was a bit longer, styled in a swoop with hair gel. Sherlock glanced at John’s shirt collar. No, there was no way John had got the hairdo that day, else his shirt collar would’ve told a completely different story. John had changed his hair. Just yesterday, John had different hair, but now he had… whatever this was. Or did he?
Except John’s chair wasn’t empty. Mrs Hudson was curled up in it, rose-patterned apron over her lilac dress, seemingly unresponsive to Sherlock’s wheezing. What was wrong with her? Why wasn’t she noticing him? Why wasn’t she noticing
Wait, he hadn’t accounted for biscuits before closing his eyes. He creaked his eyes open. No, the biscuits were real. Oh, thank God. He was seeing things that were there. And the lawyer did tell him that now his mind was unencumbered, so he shouldn’t suffer from any symptoms of demonic possession at least until the forty-eight-hour window was gone. And if hallucinations were a symptom of possession, it followed logically that he shouldn’t be having one now.
and they just... obey and magically stop harassing. That’s it?”
Skull was predictable. Skull didn’t talk back, making him the ideal companion, an anchor to Sherlock, who was more of a well-lacquered Kawasaki Jet Ski. Skull was like John. Except John was alive. And funny. And Sherlock had never wanted to kiss Skull.
Sherlock frowned. He was positive he had used deodorant. “Wait, why are you two hounding me?
“—if the demon returns, worst-case scenario, he’ll put you in situations so painful that you’ll want to sell your kidneys for morphine—”
John’s jaw was tight, his tone disapproving, and Sherlock felt his skin prickle with need. He glanced down where his knee was touching John’s leg, hyperfocused on the two square-inch patches through which he was connected to John’s physical form. Sherlock glanced at John’s face; shadows shifted over his face, flickering, playing hide-and-seek, anchored at the groove near his mouth. The groove that always appeared when John was focused and vigilant, and presently was mere inches away from Sherlock’s mouth.
No baby formula. No milk. Only eggs, and no veggies. No grocery lists under the fridge magnet. Sherlock frowned at how empty the shelves were, how so obviously stocked-for-one-person the fridge was.
“She’s living here?”
His physical state seemed drastically improved despite the lingering fatigue. However, not everything was merry. Only an hour after telling Mrs Hudson that he’d be joining them for dinner, John had promptly cancelled, stating some vague emergency in his old place, the one he’d shared with Mary before her death. Sherlock knew what it was: an excuse. There was a time when he would have showed up at John’s flat and make him do what Sherlock wanted because he knew what was best for John. But Sherlock knew better now. Of course, he still knew what was best for John. But now, it was imperative that John arrive at that conclusion on his own.
“So stubborn,” Seb sniggered. “He’s always been that way. Fucking annoying.”
Sherlock remembered the times Moriarty was interrupted mid-monologue by yelps and cries by something smacking him on the head, and that one time he seemed to be talking to someone about ‘sticking to the script’. It had to be the former scenario. But, knowing Moriarty, it was entirely possible that he had since gone rogue.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock really did not know what John had hoped to achieve by making him sit down with Mrs Hudson. Perhaps he—despite being a man of science—was afraid for her safety.
around now that he was free from distractions and Moriarty’s constant nagging for the first time in what felt like weeks. Where were John’s things? Where was the pile of newspapers only he read? Where was the briefcase he took to the clinic? Where were Rosie’s toys? Weren’t there more toys, more… things?
“I agree,” Sherlock said with as much earnestness as he could manage. “There is nothing similar about the situation now.” He thought about the forty-eight-earth-hour window the lawyer had given him, and the absurd unknowable that lay beyond it. He thought about John’s missing things, and John wanting to open up to him in the dark, minutes before the cease-and-desist came into force and minutes before he left for his old place. “But this time I promise, John, I will not leave you in the dark.”
Sherlock grabbed Mrs Hudson’s wrist in alarm, stopping himself from twisting it before he went any further toward hurting her. On a conscious level, he knew it was her, but his reflexes didn’t. A response that had been useful during his exile years now seemed dangerous. Mrs Hudson let out a near-silent yelp, and Sherlock let go immediately, ashamed by his response.
