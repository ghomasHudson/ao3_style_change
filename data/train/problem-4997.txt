At the time, the thought had been terrifying and he'd avoided Steve for almost a week before finally confessing how he felt. Now, as he fastened his own cufflinks for dinner, Tony couldn't help smiling at the memory. What a difference a few years could make. Back then, the idea of loving someone that much had filled him with cold dread; now, it was nothing but comforting warmth. Back then he had been so convinced something would go wrong, that he would screw up, that he couldn't be this lucky, but he hadn't thought anything like that for a long time now. It was kind of hard to be insecure when someone like Steve Rogers loved you. Mostly, anyway.
. It was silly, but Steve hadn't been able to stand the thought of someone else having that kind of claim on Tony, to be known in public as his. Besides, they couldn't haven taken proper care of a wife in such circumstances, couldn't have made vows to her before God and then not kept them, however willing she had been to take part in the scheme. It wouldn't have been fair. It wouldn't have been right. So once Steve had retired, and Thor had taken on the Sheriff's duties and salary, he had quietly moved them in with him, and no-one thought anything of Angela taking her 'cousin's' arm as they walked down the street.
To Tony's great relief, the air con was on full blast, blowing deliciously cool. The temperature, Tony thought, might go some way to explaining why the tables and chairs arranged around the counter were all full already, a queue wending its way through them to the till. Well, after all, this was the best bubble tea place in the city or Tony Stark wouldn't patronise it. He'd been there a few weeks ago, pulled up outside in the Rolls on his way back from a party the night before, and the pictures had been all over Twitter. Now that he thought about it, the queue might be partly down to him too. Which was good as it meant the place would stay in business a bit longer.
was meant to be the one adorably flustered, not him. He wasn't sure how the tables had turned, but he did not like it.
'I want to,' Steve said, huskily, sounding somewhat disappointed. He went to move away. Tony held him tighter.
They were sitting in a corridor at the hospital, waiting, looking at the children's art work that had been put up to try and make the place seem jollier and more friendly. Maybe on a different day it would have worked, but not just then. Tony was pretty sure his companion hadn't even noticed it. The Captain was staring at the floor, looking distant. Peter had been whisked away behind closed doors as soon as they had arrived, the doctors saying they would 'see what they could do'. Nobody had told them anything.
The third point was simply a crudely drawn and rather explicit doodle, with the legendary Captain America shield in a strategic location.
'We used to go the Blue Diamond Christmas party every year. Everyone did. And once we were teenagers, Bucky used to chat up the girls and sometimes I'd have a go, but... 1938 was the year Bucky found me in a closet with someone.'
It turned out to be, as he pulled and the folds fell out, a pair of scarlet lace panties. Barely more than a thong. Obviously belonging to a woman.
Steve wrenched free, eyeing the other man incredulously. 'Owe you?' he repeated. 'If this about the window, I told you to let me out. You didn't, you lost a window.'
'No,' Barnaby shook his head. 'I think it might genuinely have been a coincidence. Besides, I don't want to waste any time talking to them when I could be talking to you. What do you say we get out of here?'
'Why is your neck so hot?' Tony asked, lifting his chin from where it had been resting on Steve's hair and moving his hand away. 'It's like it's – oh.
'I lost a tooth,' Steve said, the nostalgia in his voice sounding almost wistful. 'It grew back when I had the serum.'
‘I know, Pete, I know, but…’ Steve wasn’t sure where to begin. Even if he tried to explain that Iron Man wasn’t a good guy, Peter wouldn’t understand. And he was Peter’s hero, no matter what happened , Steve couldn’t take that from him. Not now. Not even if he had to be the bad guy himself. ‘You aren’t well enough.’ He finished.
'I don't know if I want to send my baby into such a cold house,' she'd said, pressing a hand to Steve's cheek. If she'd said it differently, Steve might have agreed, politely declined the offer from Stark and begun again. Except, if there was anything in this world that would make him dig his heels in, it was being patronised. He'd insisted they wouldn't get a better offer, that they had to press on.
And that was what he thought was happening when Agent Romanov showed up on his doorstep one rainy morning. Peter’s sleep cycle was all over the place, and they’d been awake since 4:30. They’d watched
Steve smirked at him. 'I kind of like you being jealous,' he said. The teasing tone didn't reach his eyes, and Tony knew he was still hurt, but if he wanted to flirt Tony wasn't going to stop him.
The cashier laughed and reached to the pharmacy shelf behind her, adding some boxes of painkillers to his purchases. 'You got a hot water bottle at home, sweetheart?'
By the end of the day, nestled in amongst the tasteful colours and leaves of the garlands were six garish oranges; Natasha's and Bruce's minimalist but balanced, Steve's somehow nostalgic, Thor's and Clint's weighed down with as many sweets as humanly possible, and Tony's, looking like he had gotten distracted half way through and finished it in a hurry, which was exactly what had happened as he'd argued and laughed with the others. The kitchen table was sticky with juice, and the bots were just starting to clear up the dropped candy and cocktail sticks that littered the floor. The whole thing was a mess, and tacky, and totally ruined his theme and yet – and yet. Tony had to admit, there was something in the way they looked when the candles were lit, all of them there together, the reflection of the flames glittering in the dark glass of the window and matching the delighted look in Steve's eyes.
'Just don't break anything,' the teacher said, shaking his head and passing through the still open door. Tony barely heard him, already digging in the high-stacked drawers that lined one wall of the room for what he needed. It was going to work this time, he just knew it.
Beside him, Steve coughed. 'Urrgh, what is that? That is terrible.' Then he put the straw back in his mouth and carried on drinking.
Steve snapped his jaw shut. It wouldn't do either of them any good to cause a scene. With this many people around he'd only end up getting them both hanged, even though it seemed Tony at least was completely innocent. But if Steve had misread the situation, it was only because Tony had let him. Or he'd been an even bigger fool than he'd thought.
Howard snorted. 'Of course not,' he said, as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. 'I'm not paying out twenty-five grand because someone raised a whore instead of a son.'
The cops were here, assembled at the side of the stage, looking like they weren't quite sure what to do. It was time to wrap up.
It was like it was 1938, and he was having the snot kicked out of him in a Brooklyn back alley because he'd told a guy to lay off a lady, and he had known that the beating wasn't going to stop, that no-one else was coming to help, because Bucky was out of town. It was like he was in the plane, about to hit the water, and suddenly realised that he really didn't want to die. It was like the day he had cried at the news bulletin about the buildings, the day he had watched Bucky fall, the day he had been told Richard and Sarah would not be coming home, like someone had punched him so hard it had knocked everything out of him and, try as he might, there would be no getting back up.
The thing was, Tony Stark traditionally did not respond well to change, and he did not like the stand in drivers or heads-of-security who popped up when Happy took vacation time, and Pepper and Happy did not like listening to Tony whine about the replacements. And so they had come to an arrangement where Happy would chose wherever in the world he wanted to go, Pepper would arrange it all, and Tony paid for the flights and hotels on the condition that Happy took his time off at a moment's notice, when Tony was busy with something and wouldn't need him for a few days. Later, Tony would text Pepper to say it was over and she would recall Happy while Tony slept it off. The arrangement suited them all so well that Tony hadn't realised that was how it was happening for the best part of a year.
His dad glanced at the doctor, who said nothing, and then answered, 'Of course you can, Peter. Do it as many times as you want.'
Steve had suffered just about every disease going; had suffered pain so bad it had made him faint if he so much as twitched a finger, had stared death in the face so often that he and the grim reaper were essentially on first name terms by now, but he had never felt so uncomfortable in his life.
to him about who he was, they'd barely had a conversation, and yet Steve found himself leaning in, trying to pull Barnaby close with his stupid, short, weak arms that were taking too damn long to get Barnaby where Steve wanted him, even though Barnaby was coming willingly – and then Steve was torn away, landing hard on the dance floor. Something crunched. Probably a rib. At least he had enough experience to know it wasn't broken.
would have been too intimidating, and too tragic, not when all that potential would never be realised.
'Good,' Clint said, patting Tony on the back and getting up to leave. 'And you need to call his social worker, because if you're not able to care for him then-'
. Happy birthday.' Without any further ado, he snatched up the briefcase and swept out of the room, leaving Peter examining the phone in his hands and looking as overwhelmed as Steve felt.
Tony and Steve stared at the book, Steve turning over the pages in quiet and bewildered amazement. Tony had to give it to Thor, it really was the perfect wedding for them. A small, intimate and informal ceremony, with a splash of prayers to the '
Steve was already striding away, towards the hitching post and his horse. Of all the stupid things the boy could have done to earn an extra dollar, this was probably the worst. The gold mine nearest town had been abandoned for a reason; two reasons in fact. The first was that had been picked clean, the gold vein a small one. The second, of less importance to the owners but even greater to the miners, was that the whole place had been structurally unsound ever since the river had been rerouted to run barely forty yards from it.
'Right,' Steve said, and suddenly swung round in his seat, leaning back so far that his head was practically in Stark's lap, who looked down on him in delight, immediately twining his fingers into his hair.
'Yes, yeah, no-one's hurt, everyone's fine, it's just...' Peter bit his lip, but this time powered on. 'They've found some lost recording. A radio transmission of Steve's, from the forties.'
Tony snorted. It had been 'one last time' for at least the last fifteen minutes. Steve shot him a look. Tony waved him off in a
He then launched into a detailed description of some complicated system of counting on his fingers where each one was worth twice the amount of the one before. Steve didn’t entirely get it, but Peter obviously did, and Steve was suitably impressed.
'Looks like you're getting the hang of this,' Clint commented. He'd been on the couch in the seating area nearby, but never missed an opportunity to come say hi to the little boy. And why should he? Peter was a delight.
'Okay, maybe that's enough wine,' they all chorused together, laughing. Steve was particularly tickled by the story, and every time he looked at him Tony could almost see the mental image forming in his mind before he would burst out laughing again. Steve's laugh, Tony thought, might be the best sound in the world.
‘Well, hello there, dandelion,’ he murmured, his hand coming up to rest against Steve’s chest. Even through his shirt, the touch burned. Steve wanted to lift his arms to touch Tony back, but they weren’t working. The scent of flowers was overwhelming, suddenly, and he couldn’t breathe. His heart was beating erratically. His vision was blurring, going dark. He tried to say – to say – something, anyway, but all that came out was a slurred mess.
Tony was kneeling in front of him, tying first one shoe and then the other. His hair curled slightly at the ends. Not many people noticed that, but Steve did. He always did. And, just then, it would have been the most natural thing in the world to just lean down and plant a kiss into that hair. A small intimacy, a little touch, a reminder that he was here, that when Tony was in front of him he would always have his full attention.
The incident with the photograph had killed any lingering inclination for Steve to have a good time. He just wanted to eat and get out of here, work out what he was going to do with and for Peter. The main course arrived and he set to it at once.
Principles – and pride – were a luxury he could no longer afford. It was only dinner. It would be worth it.
'I'll get through it somehow,' Steve sighed, rubbing the back of his neck in anticipation of the crick he would get there leaning over all those books every day. 'Even if I don't sleep the rest of the year.'
Someone had kidnapped him from the hospital, someone who was interested in his new powers. Peter hadn't really got a good look at him before he passed out from the gas, he'd just seen some weird face like a Halloween mask. It probably was a mask, to hide his attacker's identity.
Steve said nothing. He hated the chatty ones. And he was trying to think of a way to get home from, presumably, being scattered to the multiverse. Or better yet, a way to avoid it happening in the first place.
Some time and several search terms later, however, Tony had to concede it was pointless. Even the original Eartha Kitt version wasn't recorded until 1953, which was well after when Steve was put on ice. Whatever he hated about the song, it had to have happened since he woke up in the future; but Tony had no idea what it could be. He wouldn't have thought Steve had even heard that version of the song before – it wasn't one of Tony's favourites – if it wasn't for the strange reaction. Something funny was going on.
'I need to come in,' Peter insisted, tugging at the door again. The handles turned burning hot, making him yelp and jump back.
Of course, he thought in the back of his mind, Tony couldn't help how he felt either. But that was another story.
'Thanks,' Tony had said, playing with his cufflink because he had known that Steve would step forward to fix it for him and Tony sort of loved that, 'You sure you don't want to come? We could soon find you a tux.'
'Okay,' Tony said, landing beside him. 'Clearing a path, got it.' He raised his hands in front of him, the repulsors whirring as they began to power up.
Peter went back into the living room and settled himself on the couch as Steve finished the toast, smearing Peter’s in jam and cutting them into triangles. He did toast the old fashioned way, preferring the grill to the toaster, partly because he could do more slices at once, and it was all ready at the same time. Once Peter’s was ready, he spread some butter onto his own and took the plates through.
Steve nodded. Tony huffed. One of the tabloids had decided the best way to celebrate their nuptials back in the summer was to do a 'countdown' formed of interviews with Tony's old flames, everything from ex-girlfriends and boyfriends to drunken one night stands he didn't even really remember. He and Steve had talked about them. They had both agreed that it was a bad idea for either of them to read them, that the best thing to do was ignore them, not to let it ruin things. It seemed Steve hadn't been able to resist.
'Why is it always amputation with you?' Tony had demanded, which wasn't really fair. It was true the surgeon had removed Bucky's arm shortly before his death, but the limb had been crushed in a nasty fall when they'd chased an outlaw too near to the edge of a cliff. There had been no saving the arm then, and, Steve had been fairly certain, no saving his now. The feeling in it had already almost gone.
. Still, Steve hated using it, not when Tony was trying so hard to break the habit. Not when Steve had been making it worse without even knowing. He couldn't live with that for another second, so he added, 'Wouldn't want Deputy Odinson to have to arrest you his first day on the job.'
yell out your tactics for your opponents to hear. He was more glad of it than ever, though, when it meant he got to bear witness to the moment, mid battle, when after long years of courting, Tony Stark finally proposed to the Captain.
'He's gone,' Steve said, not stopping. 'He's gone.' He slammed something into Tony's chest, and kept walking. Tony looked down at the piece of card in his hands. It was small, and stiff, a typical business card but for the handwritten note on it.
The first recorded Charity Marriage was in 1634 between Edward Monkton and Hannah Smith, though from Monkton's diary historians believe the practice already existed. Monkton states that, 'having come upon the age of marriage in the New World' (1) he and other wealthy European settlers found the pool of acceptable candidates within their own
'No, idiot,' Tony said, giving him a good natured shove before heading down towards the carriage. 'We're having a ride. Well, I am, you're learning to drive.'
Yet, he had a hunch, a gut instinct that maybe this wasn't the sort of person Stark really was, that the other man wasn't in his right mind. That 'flight suit' moved like a living thing, and it was spreading even as he watched, so that Stark was completely encased up to his chin.
'Whatever you want,' Steve said, in the most authoritative voice he could, 'We aren't doing anything until you let Stark go.'
Stark looked, for a moment, genuinely taken aback. Then he smirked, moving a few paces closer to Steve. Steve fought the urge to back away. The gentleness that had been shown to Peter was gone; Stark was all predator now.
Steve snorted, a sound that Tony had learnt was his equivalent of a belly laugh. Steve was more of an amused-smile kind of guy, so when he made a noise, you knew you had really got him. 'I didn't think even you were that bad.'
Pepper wrote to him too, and then came to visit. She had another job, and was doing well. She was glad to see him back.
'I was friends with his parents. They put me up after I woke up; I was lodging with them when Peter was born. So after they died...'
'Well, two super humans and you,' Bucky corrected, smirking, because he had turned out to be a bit of a dick when he recovered.
Stark Industries share prices have already fallen more than forty points, losing more ground on an hourly basis as news of the shake-up spreads. If Mr Stark follows through with his intention to disband the company entirely it will be at the cost of thousands of jobs nationally and almost 100,000 worldwide; the worse job losses since the financial crash of 2008.
Snorting with laughter through his wheezes, Steve couldn't speak, just buried his face in Tony's shoulder again. He didn't ever want to move, but Tony pulled away a little, looking at him with concern.
'Okay, sure, I crossed a line, I get it.' He snapped, when he couldn't take the lecture any more. 'But I just like, put a toe across it, you're the one who used it as the start line of the long jump!'
Steve's pencil went through the napkin and skidded along the table top. It was starting to feel like the world was closing in. And wasn't Steve being selfish? He'd had grand plans to use Stark's billions where they were most needed, but as soon as he'd been offered a way for him and his loved ones to be okay, he had forgotten all about them. Damn. He was a monster.
Bucky bent down and hauled Tony off him, finally allowing Steve to get up, massaging his dead arm. Between them, they carried Tony into the bedroom and lowered him onto the bed. Steve tried not to look around, or imagine being in that room under different circumstances He tried not to blush.
'It's a dead celestial,' he said, as if Steve needed reminding. 'I didn't exactly get the blue prints. But sure, keep nagging me Cap, I'm sure I can find you a room near the anus.'
, Tony thought bitterly. If he'd had the man's number, he could have got him to bring it down instead of having to cancel his order – his heart breaking – and leave the beautifully cool interior of the shop for the baking heat of the world outside.
'Why don't you take that stupid thing off, Tony?' Steve asked, apparently thinking the same thing. 'No-one is going to recognise you with your beard like that.'
She wasn't the sort of person Tony had imagined to be a teacher. Until coming here he had been home schooled by a string of increasingly exasperated private tutors, so his only idea of teachers had been from TV. Even though Jarvis had tried to console him, tried to explain to him that teachers
'Come on,' Barnaby said. 'Come check out the view.' He headed to the edge of the garden, where waist-high barriers protected the employees from falling. Spread out below them, the city was like a map, drawn out in lines of light.
Apparently it had. Around three in the morning, Peter had settled into what seemed like a peaceful sleep, and had woken up at 7.30, bright-eyed and raring to go. It was all Steve could do to keep him still long enough for the doctors to perform the various scans, tests and samples they needed to work out if he was really alright. By three in the afternoon, Peter was so bored he was literally doing somersaults on the bed.
For a moment, Peter thought the countdown had stopped. The gap certainly seemed longer before the computerised voice said, '4... 3...'
'No, it doesn't,' Steve muttered. His heart was hammering. His pride had reared up at the idea – it was
couldn’t attempt to flirt. Not that he was really planning to. His mouth was totally dry, his tongue dead and useless. The beautiful guy was blinking at
He wondered, wildly, whether he could just seduce Steve and take it back to his place. But he wasn't sure Steve went in for that kind of thing, and anyway, at that moment, Steve was just looking at him incredulously. He was incognito too, wearing a baseball cap and large sunglasses similar to Tony's. It didn't hide his face as well as Tony's hood did, but it didn't need to; Steve was also wearing a plain white t-shirt, khaki knee-length shorts and honest-to-goodness flipflops. Anyone who looked at him and thought it was Captain America would hesitate when they saw he wasn't wearing full-length formal trousers, and would definitely change their mind when they saw his feet.
A hand emerged, giving him a thumbs up, and quickly withdrew. Steve took the opportunity to glance at the colour chart. A tie-dye band meant
'Whatever you want, Cap,' he said, his own voice cracking and strangely high pitched. He risked letting go of the counter to pluck at the sleeve of Steve's sweater, testing the ground, ready to move higher and lower, to explore the rest of Steve's body if he was allowed.
They spent a happy morning playing together with the toys and then, when that got too much, curled up on the bed watching
'I like that,' Steve muttered, and for a moment they stood there, neither of them moving away, neither of them quite brave enough to move forward.
Tony listened to the whole thing, right until the awful moment when Steve's radio cut off. Then he listened to it again, and again, even though it hurt, even though as much as he knew Steve didn't die that day – he had the wedding ring to prove it – it really felt like it. It was, as Twitter said, heartbreaking. And romantic and all the rest that he didn't really want to think too much about. It was also, as Peter had said, deeply private. Tony rubbed a tired hand over his face. He had no idea how he was going to break this to Steve.
'And,' Tony continued triumphantly. 'She has a friend. For you.' He nudged Steve with his elbow. Steve moved away.
But this wasn't Afghanistan. He could see the outside world through the windows just fine, and if the people around him in the queue had guns, they probably wouldn't just wave them around willy-nilly. Even in New York, it was too early for that sort of nonsense. Besides, Tony really wanted that bubble tea. And so, he shuffled into the line.
There was something in his tone that Steve thought might have been suggestive. He glanced at the bed. Even if he couldn't agree that they were meant to be on some mystical level, maybe he could demonstrate the strength of his feelings.
'Oh, is that so?' Tony twisted around, hooked his arms around Steve's neck. Steve had no idea why, but he loved it when Tony did that, it drove him crazy. He pulled Tony close, was about to kiss him and then – the sounds of
Barnaby pulled away, blinking at him drunkenly, the alcohol blocking his usually alert synapses. Then he nodded unhappily. 'I don't want to,' he said. 'But my dad...' the rest of what he said was a slurred mess, something about
'Stop him from creeping out to bars at all hours and, most importantly, show his wankstain ex that Starks can't be messed with,' Howard had commanded.
He should probably help, Tony realised. But there really was something beautiful about watching Steve fight off assault after assault.
'I really don't,' Tony said, and something in his tone seemed to make Steve realise he was serious, because he finally met his husband's eyes, and although he flushed even darker there was understanding in his eyes.
It had been over almost as soon as it began, Miss Rivers withdrawing her hands and telling him, not unkindly, that his consent wasn't enthusiastic enough. The shame had flared into anger, and he had told her not to tell him what he did or didn't want, that he had said yes, but she had just shook her head,
'No!' Tony whipped his head round to glare at him, was on his feet before he knew it. 'No way are they taking him back! No way in
'Follow me,' Steve said, and, holding his shield up in front of him, barrelled through, knocking anyone foolish enough to approach away like skittles. Tony followed, awestruck, firing off the odd blast here and there where the enemy tried to close in behind. It was sort of fun, this hero thing.
'Stark has permission to be in here, you boys don't.' Meredith jerked her head at the door. 'Get out before I give you all detention.'
It was just possible, some reasonable part of her brain pointed out, that she ought to have had trauma counselling after Afghanistan after all. That, whether she was Natasha Stark or not, the ordeal had effected her, and chose to manifest itself this way. She ought to get herself back on the pill, first, to stop any more surprise periods; and then get herself to therapy.
on his own, Venom had made his life ordered, controlled, without him it would all be chaos, he couldn't deal with that, he didn't know how to deal with that - But at the same time, the memories of the last few years were coming back. The paranoia, the hatred, the people he had killed, murdered on the slightest pretext. Pepper's face when he fired her. Jarvis' pleas, telling him the truth, telling him that he needed help, before Tony turned off everything that made him him. He'd used a dying child, used highly experimental, untested medicine on a child who was
, Steve decided, the shadows of his doubts and fears chased off in the light of this glittering world. Tonight he would tell Tony the words he had only ever implied. Tonight, if Tony would let him, he would move his pillow to the same end of the bed, and lie cheek to cheek with him. He would kiss him, and let the world be damned.
Right at the top, he found the messages telling Peter that Steve would be angry if he found out, and would take the phone, and that this was their secret and he mustn’t tell anyone, making him promise not to tell. Steve gripped the phone so hard it almost snapped in two. He was tempted to do it, he was angry enough. But Peter was looking at him with large, anxious eyes, his breath catching noisily, which was as good as his breathing ever was these days. Steve forced his face back into a neutral expression.
thing, they hadn't written anything that wasn't true. Even that was, well, debatable. Steve found himself opening the fridge door harder than strictly necessary, or at least trying to. No-one else would have noticed, probably not even the door itself, the hinges barely protesting. He really was pathetic. And what kind of person was going to pick someone like him? Especially if they found out he had a bond mark.
Steve said nothing. His hands clenched tighter. Tony suddenly wondered what he was doing. Yes, he had decided a long time ago that he was his own top priority, but this was starting to feel like it bordered on evil.
Immediately, she tried to wipe them away with her hand. Steve looked downright alarmed and rocketed up from his chair, and then seemed to be unsure of what to do next, and hovered awkwardly, which just made her feel more embarrassed, because she was making such a fool of herself -
Not that he was going to give Venom to Peter. The little kid was too weak to handle it, and anyway, Tony needed it. No. Peter wasn't getting any of it. Not the smallest drop.
'Tony, I'll be two minutes. I'm not leaving you.' Steve tilted Tony's face downwards again, and left. Tony drank his bubble tea, and when he was done, he finished Steve's. He did not switch the straws.
But Steve had written this list. It was definitely his writing and it was in his bin, so he had undoubtedly written it. And the compliments, the way they were worded, the references to lips and hips and hair and clothes and perfume and, presumably, high heeled shoes, made Tony think, made it pretty obvious, that he had been writing to a woman.
, and even his dad finally started to realise his potential, but then his parents died too and he was alone, in charge of a company that employed thousands, with no clue what he was doing because, guess what, he had never learnt how. All of that was Osborn's fault too.
The press conferences and interviews that followed always asked her about how 'traumatic' it had been, how she had coped, danced around the 'were-you-raped' question with varying levels of finesse, but the truth was the kidnapping and the cave and the danger, even the murder of poor Yinsen, were not as hard to cope with as the periods. She couldn't tell the press about it. She couldn't tell her therapist or her doctor. She couldn't even
'Oh, great, me too,' Stark said. 'I'm a big, big, fan. What a great guy. I bet I'm higher in the fan club than your kid.'
Upstairs and completely unaware of the tumult he was causing, Thor was blissfully going through Pinterest. He had stumbled into a vein of lace capes and cloaks for wedding dresses, and thought they were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. He had already printed several for the ledger. This was going to change
, managed to eat a bowl of cereal between them, and because Peter didn’t feel like getting up and getting dressed, had ended up staying cuddled up under blankets on the couch, playing on the Starkphone Peter had been given. The young boy was fascinated by YouTube playlists and had begged Steve to get an account so they could make one, which of course he had. They sat there listening to increasingly obscure songs as they went from related video to related video, every single one of them getting added to Peter’s playlist. Steve started to sing along despite not knowing the words, and Peter laughed, and Steve tried to share in it even though he noticed how out of breath Peter was getting. And at 11 o’clock, just as they were thinking about an early lunch, there was a knock on the door.
Steve had taken his time getting dressed, trying to focus his racing thoughts and ragged breathing. The uniform had been cleaned, laundered and probably repaired. There was a cowl in there too, though he knew it couldn't be the original. As he put the clothes on, it helped him compartmentalise what was happening. There was less Steve Rogers, whose son had been kidnapped, and more Captain America, off on a mission to save innocents. It made things, if not easier, more bearable. He glanced at the shield again. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, he noted that this was it. With phones and cameras and social media these days, it was bound to get out that Captain America – or at least someone dressed as him – was back. It was the end of his new, normal, life and the end of his anonymity.
In traffic, the bus down town took forty minutes each way; and yet Sarah was still back in under two hours. Steve hadn't even moved from her bed. Everything was acting up and he'd developed another fever, so despite his tension he'd fallen asleep. When his mother woke him, she'd changed out of her fancy clothes and cleaned her face of the make up. She'd looked much more herself.
'James,' she replied, going back into the living room. Steve watched her go, a little bemused. Tony must have told her about him, but how she had pieced it all together from the little information she had, he did not know. Then, from behind him and above him, there was a sharp intake of breath. Steve whirled round and beamed.
But not now, not yet. The spectre of his engagement, of the Starks, was tomorrow's problem. Tonight there was just this. Just them.
Steve stared at him, appalled. True enough, Tony broke his blue ribbon on the regular, but he always went right back the next day and tried again, over and over, no matter how exhausting it was. Steve had never understood, before, exactly what made it so hard to keep the pledge. Guilt and horror was burning through him like quicklime, chewing a hole through his stomach, turning his bones to lead. 'Tony, I-'
Steve had been to the restaurant before. Well, not inside it; but he had hovered awkwardly outside before being moved along by a bouncer when he had still been trying to catch Stark to ask him about coming to the hospital. According to the internet, this was one of Stark's favourite places to go, and he certainly seemed comfortable enough, insisting on taking Steve's arm and escorting him inside, passing his keys to the doorman. He didn't even pause at the maître de, passing straight through to a table alone in an alcove by the window. Steve was beginning to feel distinctly under dressed; everyone else here, both staff and patrons, seemed to be in full black tie. Or white tie? He had never worked out the difference. In any case, even the table, draped in a white, embroidered tablecloth and decorated with two small candles burning on a pleasingly-shaped stone centrepiece, was better dressed than he was. He wished he had at least put on a tie.
being insulted by it meant he was giving credence to the patriarchal assumption that being feminine was inherently inferior to being masculine, but
Peter was still crying the bedroom, his wheezing getting worse. Steve went back to him, feeling like he wanted to cry himself, and wrapped him up in a hug.
missed Steve. He'd never managed to say 'Pa' before, but by the time Steve had been gone 24 hours he was asking for him with wide eyes. Tony had videoed it for Steve, but Peter had looked so sad that he had deleted it again. Steve had better come home soon.
'Howard Stark's rays, I know. I... I might be able to get those. I mean, Stark might know. We could ask him. And the serum, what if I could get you...' he hesitated, just for a second. He had never revealed his true past to anyone except Richard and Mary. It just seemed simpler that way. The hesitation was the only sign Dr Moore needed to continue.
Tony had seen old newsreels, of course. But the thing about those was, they were all staged. Of course they hadn't had the cameras out on the actual battle fields as Cap led the Commandos to attack Hydra. They'd just re-enacted those bits later on. Cap had always seemed a little embarrassed in the fight scenes, and had been holding back, going through the motions and trying not to hurt the extras playing Nazis. This was completely different.
Maybe it wasn't the song itself. Maybe it was the lyrics, and the crass commercialism they betrayed. Maybe Steve was just shocked by someone being so demanding. Then again, he seemed to be dealing with it. Just the other day, when Tony had asked him what he wanted for Christmas, he had sighed theatrically and asked for
It took him a few attempts, tucking his chin into his chest and butting his head on the mattress, pushing upwards with his feet, until it finally happened. He rolled, all the way over, ending up looking at the ceiling, sprawled at the end of the bed. He beamed and turned onto his front, ready to do it again, but he had finally got his dad's attention.
That day, he was working in the lab, finally making progress on some new hearing aids for Clint, trying to work out a better way to combine it with their communicators, when Jarvis interrupted him; pulling him out of the zone to tell him that the others – two floors above, with sound proofing in between – had requested he turned the music down.
. Steve hadn't been entirely sure what that meant, and was too embarrassed to ask. It would have seemed rude to, and dangerous. Like invading women's territory.
Tony nodded and followed her, Steve beside him as far as he was allowed to go, before he returned to the viewing gallery. Tony just hoped his knees would keep holding him up all the way to the end.
The labour had been obscenely quick, he said. If Steve hadn't forced them to leave when he did, the little boy would have been born at home or in the back of the car, and there was no way he would have survived. It was touch and go now. The baby's lungs and heart were not as strong as they needed to be. He was in something called an incubator, and honestly, that was where Steve lost track of what Richard was telling him, talking about a lot of medical processes he'd never heard of and didn't understand. Mary was okay, but the short labour had not been easy. She needed rest.
He could quit. Send the ring back and refuse to go any further. But then they would be bankrupt, his mom would be on the street because he was too expensive to live. He couldn't do that to her, not for a boy he had, after all, only known for a few hours. He owed her too much. He had to do it for her, even at the expense of his own happiness.
'Like he's going to grow up innocent in a house like this,' Steve snorted. 'But alright, I'm sorry.'
(‘So the love of his life walked through the door,’ Bucky would say, years later, in his best man speech. ‘And Steve knows it, right? He
'It's Peter's playlist. The same thirty-four songs have been on a continous loop for the last two weeks, he insisted.'
The creature was weak from its journey, from too long without a host, but it made it to the shade of this cave. It waited. It recuperated.
Tony cut him off with a kiss, and this time Steve responded with enthusiasm, which made Tony think he'd got the memo. When they finally broke, Steve was smiling.
'Mine was probably Christmas 1935, the Blue Diamond, Melanie Jackson,' Steve said thoughtfully, making Bucky roll his eyes and nod in agreement. At Tony's questioning look, Steve smiled and explained, 'I was seventeen, and I asked the prettiest girl in school to dance with me at the Blue Diamond's Christmas party. Her boyfriend wasn't very happy.'
Steve ignored him. 'The orange represents the world,' he said. 'The red ribbon round the middle represents the blood of Christ, spilt for everyone.'
'Not a one,' he said, smiling, and went to get the coffee. The soft, warm light was still inside him, and glowing as bright as ever.
He had resisted sleep as long as he could, lying there in his wife's arms, feeling her stroke his hair and hold him close, listening to her reminisce about their honeymoon, the happiest three weeks of his life; but as that Steve drifted off he was awakening to, as, in, another.
'You trust me, don't you?' He asked, gently, pulling Barnaby close, feeling rather than seeing his nod. 'Arrange another meeting. Please. Promise me.'
'The thing about Pete is, he's, well, he's sick. Friday is, well, it's probably the last birthday he's going to have and...' Steve took a deep breath. No. He was not going to break down in front of this man. 'When the people from Make a Wish foundation asked him what he wanted, he said he wanted to meet the real-life Iron Man. He wants to meet you, Mr Stark.'
'Tony? Tony, sit down.' Steve's arm was under his, steering him over to a bench. Tony was surprised to find he more sort of fell onto it than sat on it. 'You can't keep that thing on,' Steve said, and a second later he had pulled the hood down off Tony's head, replacing it with his own baseball cap. Tony looked up at him, wondering if Steve wasn't worried about his own cover being blown, but no, he still had the flipflops. Tony pulled the zip down on his jacket and shrugged it off. The relief was immediate. It was still too hot, but it wasn't quite as unbearable as it had been.
Steve barely noticed when Thor clapped his shoulder and went off to find something to eat. He stood there, alone, wanting to look anywhere but at the dancers yet unable to look away.
He got no further. Tony was laughing too hard. Well, he was laughing when he could, when his lips weren't pressed to Steve's, to his lips and his cheek and his neck and his chin and his temples and every inch of him that Tony could get to. He could feel Steve pouting even beneath his kisses.
Smirking now in his lop sided way, Steve rubbed his back, making Tony arch closer to him. 'Oh, can I?'
'I'm gonna fuck you,' Venom said, not moving. 'Then I'm gonna kill you. Or maybe the other way around. You've never seen anything like me, Princess.'
Of course, there was a chance this was a trap, that someone at the hospital would snap a photo or swear to a statement telling the police he was Iron Man and that the Captain would try to arrest him at dinner. He was confident he could, as usual, quickly deal with any such a someone and situation, but there was no point in taking unnecessary risks.
The judge paused for breath. Tony gripped the wooden rail of the dock, suddenly completely unsure what to expect.
A few minutes later - he had been two floors down in the lift when he had realised he was barefoot and had to go back for shoes, and tried and failed to think of a way to stop Ron noticing- Tony was outside on the street. The heat hit him like the sun had personally taken the time to reach down from the heavens and slap him in the face. Stuck in the heavy black hoodie, Tony felt like every step could be his last.
, was doing snooping at ladies' private things. Even if he might be recognised and have to deal with 'Captain America: Pervert' being in all the papers. Natasha needed those tampons.
Steve blinked at him, then laughed until Tony joined in, flushing. 'I changed my mind,' he said. 'This, this is the worst decision I've ever made. Or at least the most awkward.'
Later, when his Mom had gotten home from work, and questioned Bucky about his trip, and Steve had convinced them both,
Tony couldn't resist the urge to touch him any longer, but he kept it casual, with a hearty pat on the back. 'First day of the rest of your life,' he said, as lightly as he could. 'Welcome to the outside of the closet.'
They were dancing together at their wedding reception – their wedding reception! - and although the room was full of people, pretty much everyone Tony had ever cared for in his life, his attention was so focused on Steve that he could barely spare them a thought. He was too full of Steve, in his head and his heart and every last gram of him.
'I'm sorry, Peter,' Mr Osborn said, and he shook his head like he really was sad. 'I know Mr Stark helped you. But he just isn't what you think.'
'Sure,' Steve had said, swallowing hard, unable to say what he had really wanted to. He felt sick at the idea that Stark thought that's what their arrangement was, that Steve would do something like that. But beneath that, he had felt the beginning nips of a sadness that had been steadily growing ever since, gnawing away at his guts. Because if Tony thought this was just
Steve had caught up with him shortly after the court broke up, and told him he'd received orders to continue as Tony's 'handler' and await further instructions. And as Steve's place was tiny – if Peter grew any taller they wouldn't both have fitted – all three of them had moved to the tower. Since then, there had been nothing from Shield.
Tony reached into his pocket. And then into his other pocket. And if his sweatpants had had back pockets, he would have reached into those too, but it would have just been for show. Tony Stark had not carried cash since 1992. But Tony Stark, apparently, also did not carry his bank card as a matter of habit. If it was work stuff, Pepper always sorted it out. He ordered 90% of his personal goods online, or Happy handled the actual paying part. At least, he assumed they did. Walking around as Tony Stark, or even as Iron Man, tended to bring a lot of free stuff his way. Cap called it 'paying with your face'. Cap rarely accepted freebies.
He gave Clint the bowl of remaining yoghurt, and went upstairs to their – his – bed. He pulled Steve's pillow over to him and tried not to think.
(On the morning of the wedding, Steve would add Venus fly traps as an accent to Tony’s buttonhole and bouquet, as a last minute surprise. He would imagine Tony’s face when he saw them, and smile.)
Before Steve could say anything, Peter had let out a delighted yell and launched himself across the room, sending the balloon floating up to the ceiling and Stark staggering into the wall as he just about managed to catch him. Steve was so taken aback that he missed the start of what Peter was saying. He didn't have much experience with four year olds other than Peter, but he had never seen even the fittest of them jump that far.
'Flying cars.' Steve agreed, 'And settlements on the moon. And everything was going to be made of chrome and steel.' He was still rubbing Tony's back, but quicker now, with open handed strokes. Tony's jacket was never going to be the same, but he didn't care. He squirmed happily, moving to try and encourage Steve to circle wider, but it didn't seem like Steve was even paying attention to what he was doing. 'But, you know, we never thought about society changing. I mean, we all thought there would be world peace. You had to believe it to keep going, to keep fighting. But you never really saw anything about how America would change. I guess most people thought we had it all perfected.'
And that was it. The sight of seeing Steve there, actually comfortable and relaxed instead of rigid and upright, seeing his socks pressed up against the arm of the couch – somehow, that was the moment Tony had realised he loved him. And not in the 'this-is-my-current-partner-aren't-they-great' way, in the 'love-story-for-the-ages, Drew-Barrymore-movie' sort of way. The 'Only-you-forever' sort of way. The 'If-I-mess-this-up-my-life-is-over' way.
And if the heat didn't kill him, the shame would. Sure, Ron presumably got the same employee package as everyone else: great insurance and benefits, long service awards, performance bonuses, a card on special birthdays, flowers sent to the house for special anniversaries and a batch of non-disclosure agreements thick enough to paper a wall with; but it was
Tony was back home, in Stark Tower, 48 hours after the trial had ended. He still didn't know what Shield was going to do with him.
'No,' Peter shook his head, looking back towards the movie. 'But they put me in this room so I wouldn't die in front of the other kids.'
No time for that. He nodded. 'Okay, kid, thanks. Where did you hear this? Where is it all going down?'
'Bastard,' Stark said. He looked at Steve, who was standing still, guarded. 'He killed my favourite teacher. Practically.' He sounded almost defensive.
'Start with the ribbon,' Steve instructed, issuing the command in his most Captain America-y voice, so that Tony grumbled but picked up the ribbon and started trying to get it to stay in place. It was a fiddly job – Tony was a damn engineer and he couldn't get it to stay in place, the shiny ribbon sliding around on the waxy skin – but seeing Steve sitting opposite him, watching the progress, beaming, just made him go weak at the knees. He'd do anything to keep that smile on his face.
On the whole, being snowed in was turning out not to be so bad. Although he couldn't get drunk, the mulled wine seemed to have soothed Bucky, shaved off some of the sharp edges from months of busy city life and the long car journey up. He had loosened up and seemed content to sit in the squashy old arm chair, joking and laughing with them, occasionally looking away from his guests and up at the boughs of the Christmas tree Tony had had put in for him. There was nothing on it yet, as Tony had thought Bucky might enjoy doing it himself, but it filled the room with the distinctive smell of pine, of Christmas. The under floor heating was on full blast and Steve had proven himself a true boy scout when he had started a fire in the old grate at one end. They were warm and cosy, the mulled wine was tasty, and Steve was sitting next to Tony on the small couch, only a few inches of room between them. No, it wasn't a bad situation to be in, all things considered; especially if it seemed like they'd be able to get away in the morning.
husband and baby. How a jerk like him had got to have something so perfect he couldn't say, but he never stopped appreciating that he had.
'Are you alright?' She asked, quietly, sitting up to turn on the lamp. He stared at her, visibly pale, looking shocked.
It was still hard, sometimes, to stop the anger from flaring up. But by thinking of Bucky and the Winter Soldier separately, by transferring the blame and rage he felt onto Hydra, by reminding himself that Bucky was also a victim, Tony had managed. He had poured as much as he could into Bucky's recovery, paying for doctors and counselling, designing a better prosthetic arm, getting Bucky whatever was needed to restore him to some part of what he had been before.
and get down to the hospital's canteen, where Tony had brought Steve an extremely sub-par coffee the Captain hadn't even touched. Tony sipped his and couldn't blame him.
Venom was coping with it much worse than he was. It screeched in displeasure, and some of the extra tentacles spread up to cover where it's ears should have been. It's grip slackened enough that Steve could take a deep breath, filling his lungs.
'Yes. You need to rest. And shower, Tony, I'm serious.' Steve looked down on him, and suddenly smiled. 'You might want to sort that beard out too. Tomorrow's a big day.'
His third birthday had been the only one he had spent outside of hospital and Peter had really, really wanted to go to the zoo. The doctors had warned against it – there had been no telling what the hair and fur and smells of a zoo, not to mention being outside for so long, would do to Peter's respiratory system – and Steve had resolved not to go. But when he had woken up, seen the sun shining, seen Peter open his presents like any other child, his resolve had broken. They had gone to the zoo. They'd had a good time, too, even if it had ended in Peter getting too excited, being unable to catch his breath, needing an ambulance, and Steve getting inspected by child services. Still, it had been all Peter had talked about for weeks afterwards. He had told the social worker, at length, about the marsupials, mammals and reptiles even though she had not asked, and showed her his elephant hat. The social worker had told Steve to listen to the doctors in future and left them alone.
'It's alright,' Steve said, looking up from his phone. 'It looks like the snow's been blown up against the house because of the shape of the mountains, it's not as bad elsewhere. They're not forecasting any more snow for today and the temperature is meant to rise overnight; with luck we'll be out of here tomorrow.'
'I'm fine, Steve,' she reassured him, letting go with one hand to pick up the box of tampons and shaking it in his face. 'Look, no tears.'
The world lurched unpleasantly, blacking out his vision for a second and releasing a wave of nausea so violent Steve had to cling to the table, jaw locked shut, to keep himself upright and vomit-free.
Tony snorted. As if that meant anything. But he didn't want to make Steve worry more, so instead he said 'As if they know what they're looking for. Look, just leave it to me, I'll work this out.'
'Some of it,' Peter said, blushing a little. 'It started autoplaying. I turned it off when I realised what it was. It's Steve's business.'
'Hold up there,' he said, his voice soft. 'You want to be done? You've got to give me what you owe me.'
He was fastening his cufflinks with shaking hands, not sure whether Tony would want them all looking funeral pristine or he would find the whole thing too stuffy.
But he hadn't been like that with Peter, not really. His visit had been brief, but had meant so much to Peter. Steve didn't think Stark was a risk to the child; and Richard and Mary were already dead. He supposed he could tell Stark a little.
'Why don't you try one of these instead?' she asked, indicating a jar of bright green ones instead. The label read
After a hectic December, all Steve wanted to do this Christmas was collapse onto the couch with Tony and not move for at least three days. Unfortunately, super villains and international criminals had no respect for the holidays, and after a two day mission to Cyprus had turned into a three week operation, Steve had been worried that he wouldn't make it home for Christmas at all. As it turned out, though, with no small thanks to Natasha and the Shield surveillance team, they had managed to wrap things up late on the 23
'Okay,' Steve said. He was back to sitting on his bed, in paint stained pyjamas, chest heaving with exertion, staring at the painting. It was just an abstract swirl of colours, but -
'No, it's not. I'm meant to be... I...' he trailed off, making a miserable noise somewhere between a sigh, a hiccup and a sob. Steve stroked his back.
Right. Right, Steve wouldn't cheat. Although, if he did, he would be the sort who would respect Tony enough to do it in the spare, not in their bed. He'd also be the kind to hide his fling's possessions away so that he could find a way to return them. Assuming it was a fling and not a relationship. Goodness knew Tony was away enough. But Steve wouldn't, he wouldn't. Tony just wished he could convince his rolling guts of that.
Tony shook his head, feeling sick, but even as he did so vague, confused memories were coming back to him. Steve trying to explain where he was and what was happening. Tony demanding to have Venom back, screaming and crying, and behaving like a child having a tantrum. He closed his eyes. 'Shit,' he said.
Then again, if it wasn't for drink, they would probably have never been much more than nodding acquaintances. Night after night Steve had been called out to some watering hole or other to deal with Tony's shenanigans; everything from being unable to pay his tab (usually because he had forgotten his wallet, not from any actual lack of funds) to singing, gambling, public nudity, even an attempt at brawling despite the fact he was hardly sober enough to stand.
homophobic, but he was that generation. Was Pepper so mad she was deliberately sabotaging the best friendship Tony had? He opened his mouth to try and deny it, but Pepper steamrollered on.
Unless that was just Tony, of course. They'd both had enough hurt and heartache over the years to make them wary, and Tony particularly never seemed to think he deserved love. Tony needed more reassurance than Steve had expected, honestly, and Steve knew he wasn't great at giving it, but he tried. At least when he couldn't find the words dragging Tony to the bedroom seemed to work just as well.
Survivable or not, none of it was very pleasant. If he could afford to do it, he would have eaten six meals a day and slept for ten hours a night. And this hospital stay, with Peter, was really messing with him.
'Look, I don't remember anything after the summer, and I don't have time to deal with whatever this is. So unless you want to explain, drop the glaring.'
, and how Mr Stark wouldn't let any other kids have the medicine. He looked at Mr Osborn's outstretched hand. The moment seemed to go on forever.
'It's okay,' Steve said quickly, not sure he wanted Barnaby wandering the streets in his current state. 'I'm already downtown, I'll come right now, just give me your address.'
Hesitantly, Tony began to feel around the walls, his fingers making sense of what his eyes couldn't. It really was just a little natural alcove that had been sealed off, his fingers finding the bend where the side met the back with only a single step forward. Only just deeper than an arm's length, then. Placing one hand flat on the right hand wall, he reached out with his left to see how far across his new prison was.
Peter slammed his eyes shut. He'd moved too much, given himself away. He tried to keep his breathing deep and even, but it didn't work.
'Alright, Jarvis,' he said, as he re-entered his lab. 'We are officially on lock down. I'm about to save an orphan so I can seduce his father.'
talked about it. He had been in his twenties when it had finally occurred to him that his mother's end-of-the-month 'headaches' were probably not headaches at all. At thirteen, Bucky had told him about how ladies got 'monthlies', but Steve hadn't really been sure whether or not to believe him. It had sounded so strange, almost unearthly, the idea that women- all women- were secretly bleeding once a month but going about their business without a word. He'd half-suspected that Bucky was making up stories to gross him out again, except after that he had started to notice women in the drug store asking for 'you-know-whats' or 'supplies' and being discreetly passed packages already in paper bags. He had no idea what was inside the mysterious packets, and neither had Bucky. They'd tried to find out once, Bucky cheekily telling the druggist his Ma had sent him to get her 'you-know-whats' and getting a clip round the ear for his trouble.
'It's, um, it's... Bar.' Barnaby had seemed so unsure when he had introduced himself, standing there, right next to the bar.
Peter skulked away, ducking into an alley at the side of the tower, looking up at it doubtfully. It was still really, really tall, and he needed to be at the top of it.
He heard Peter crying now and then and always felt guilty, but if he rolled over and pulled up the blankets and waited, someone would soothe him. They were taking good care of him. Tony had no worries on that score. They'd look after him. They'd know how to cope when Peter asked for 'Pa'.
Steve's jaw set stubbornly, and Tony knew then that Steve wasn't going to answer the question, and everything that silence would mean.
'I mean it, Tony. Caltech said if you put a toe out of line the agreement is void.' She looked around the lab. 'The facilities should be better for you, anyway. Maybe you'll even find someone over there who has the slightest idea what you're talking about.'
The day after that, Steve got out of hospital and missed Tony even more. He kept checking his contacts as if the name and number could magically appear there, or as if he could have somehow have forgotten Tony giving it to him.
Tony brightened considerably, looking up from where he had been trying to settle the horse enough to look at its hooves. That smile made everything worth it, Steve thought, even as Tony said, 'Sure thing, Clementine,' and Steve heard the
He barely paused, rolling to his feet and carrying on chasing after Venom. The further he got ahead, the more of an advantage he would have.
Venom, however, did not appreciate it. Screaming in earnest now, it staggered back, all the tentacles writhing. Steve snatched up his shield, ready to close in, but then something dropped in a blur from the ceiling, right onto the monster's back.
He'd got the usual round of big, excessive gifts ready to go of course, but they were really just to annoy Steve and would undoubtedly go the same way as last year's helicopter – sold off once the festive period was over and the money given to charity. This year it was a mansion, and Tony already had contractors lined up to convert it into flats to be given to the homeless. He'd force Steve to spend a few hours there, make out like he meant the gift, and then put him out of his misery.
In the meantime, please enjoy this chapter, also known as: WikketKrikket cannot write fight scenes. But as an early draft literally just said 'fight scene fight scene fight scene anyway', I hope you'll agree it's at least an improvement ;) Enjoy and thanks for reading!
Tony considered this. He felt weird, lighter, somehow, but bereft. Unsure what to say, he hugged his arms over his chest and realised what he had subconsciously already known: that his flight suit was gone, that Venom was gone.
(It was a good thing too, or Steve would have had a million strokes by now. Or worse, given that they had gotten up to a
But what? Tony himself had put the privacy protocol in place, so that Jarvis wouldn't rat him out if there was something he'd rather Steve didn't know, usually when he was working on something reckless or over-ambitious.
'Anything else?' The cashier asked him. He had been nervous, getting served by a lady, thinking she would tell him off for picking up women's things, but she didn't seem to care.
and they were right; and when the piss-bucket was full of blood, instead of taking it outside to empty it they kicked it over and it went everywhere.
. He cleared his throat. 'Just, let's fix this and then you can go back to talking to Mr Stark, okay?'
'Over my dead body,' he had said. Steve had been lying on the table by then and a few pints shy of bleeding to death, but he remembered feeling strangely focused by the pain. It was like all his life up until then he had been looking at Tony's reflection in a dented mirror, and now he was finally seeing him face to face. He'd been unable to tear his eyes away, wondering if this would be the last time he would see him.
'Tony,' Steve huffed, but without any real irritation. 'We've been over this. You don't need to 'deserve' it. I love you. You don't need to earn that.'
His lawyer came back into the room. 'The judge is ready to deliver his sentence,' she said. 'Come on, let's hear it.'
, apparently he was so far ahead of everyone else there a lot of his time was self-study – the thought made Steve realise how late he was to class, and how much make up work he was going to have to do, and his feet itched to leave. So he smiled and nodded to Stark, and would have walked away if he could, but Stark was still speaking to him.
The rest of that month, Tony spent a fortune on bouquets. Steve found himself watching the clock, waiting for 4PM to roll around, knowing – hoping – that it would bring Tony soon after. He spent longer and longer in the shop every day, talking and laughing with Steve, telling him about some invention or experiment, because science was basically his hobby, and trying to learn the basics of putting together a flower arrangement. It did not go well.
Peter pointed up at the sky. 'Look,' he said. Tony and Steve looked. He was pointing at a bird, flying across the street a little way up from them.
'I forgot you even had some of these,' Bucky said, scanning the list of conditions. 'Wait, do we need to mention the TIAs you had in high school?'
'You can try,' Tony said, 'But I'm not moving for the foreseeable future, so...' Without any further prompting, Steve lifted his arm and wrapped it around Tony's shoulders, no doubt leaving smudges on Tony's jacket but Tony couldn't bring himself to care. So what if he was super clingy in a relationship? Just then he wanted to be close to Steve. The jacket could be cleaned. This moment, once it was gone, would be gone forever. The two of them sat quietly, looking out at the waters. A breeze was getting up and the surface of the lake was starting to move.
‘Kitchen.’ He said, firmly. He didn’t want Shield anywhere near this part of his life. Romanov followed him through. ‘What’s happening?’he asked again.
They muddled along okay, him and Peter. True, there was a day when his jumper was on back to front but honestly, how was anyone supposed to get a baby dressed on their own when the baby wasn't interested? Peter didn't seem bothered and Tony wasn't going to go through it all again just for the aesthetic. He'd fought easier battles against Doctor Doom.
and a reason for rejection in and of itself. In more recent times, however, it has become acceptable to 'advertise' an eligible son or daughter in the newspapers or online, providing it is the wealthy family that makes the first direct contact and expression of interest.
He was trying not to think. Hard work for a man with one of the highest intellects in the world, but he was trying. When Peter napped, he worked on equipment for the team. If Natasha had been in that building as well then-
Stark would keep texting Peter, of that Steve was certain. Well, he wasn’t going to let that happen. Hands still trembling with rage, he prised open the back of the phone and removed the SIM card, crumpling it before tossing it in the trash. Peter would still be able to play his games and get on the wifi, but, crucially, he would no longer have a phone number.
Steve thought, but quickly pushed the thought, the name, aside. He'd poured all that out onto the canvas, and couldn't think about it without feeling the howling roar of the void it had left inside him. It hurt like a hidden bruise buried deep in his skin, like the ache in his bones in the middle of a flare up. He couldn't think about it. Ms Potts looked at him a moment longer, then nodded, turning to go back to her desk. As she went to sit back down, she paused.
'Sure,' Tony answered, twisting the fabric more tightly in his hand. Hell. How did one even start a conversation like this?
. The question was driving him crazy, going round and round in his head, over and over again so fast it was practically a buzzing,
'Yeah, just remember the deal, gorgeous.' The armour was peeling away from him now, neatly coming away like the shell off a nut, and then reconfiguring, folding down, turning itself into what looked like a briefcase. Stark emerged, wearing nothing but a skin tight undersuit, something like a leotard. The thing in his chest – Steve could not remember what it was called – glowed brightly through a hole in the suit, though it had been cut roughly, leaving tentacle-like pieces of rubbery material clawing over it. Stark sauntered casually over to the locker and pulled out an expensive-looking suit, pulling it on over the under-armour. Steve could not for the life of him work out when Stark could have had it put there, but decided not to ask.
Thrown by this abrupt change in topic, it took Steve a second to register what he was being asked. Then he wondered how much he ought to say. Whatever Stark said about 'being good', he had made his interest and intentions pretty obvious from the beginning, and Steve didn't want to give him anything to latch onto, to claim they had a 'connection'. Nor had he failed to realise that Stark's 'digging' into his background undoubtedly meant that he had illegally accessed Shield's top secret files. This man was dangerous.
He was suffocating, Steve realised. The breath had been knocked out of him by the impact against the wall, and he couldn't get any more. His vision started to go black around the edges. He couldn't breathe.
There was a kiss to Tony's temple, soft and sweet, and the hand left his hair. Tony kept his eyes shut a little longer, hoping, but he knew, somehow, that Steve was gone. He let himself wake up, then, his eyes opening to an empty room, and he wept and wept until his head ached and he had sobbed himself back to sleep.
Dragging his attention back to the task at hand, Thor felled three more of their foes with one blast. For once, victory could not come soon enough.
And then Steve realised he was still wearing the cowl, and most of his face was covered. He pulled it off.
. Four years ago, when I hired him.' She shot Tony a filthy look and turned back to Steve. 'Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a housekeeper for this place? One that won't complain after a party or an alien invasion or, or, the Hulk, messes the place up?! One that isn't just trying to sleep with Tony, or that Tony won't try to sleep with, or that won't, I don't know, steal his underwear for the tabloids?!'
Tony nodded. So Steve was working, here to guard him. Of course it wouldn't be anything else. So there was only one more thing he needed to know, and he wasn't sure what he wanted the answer to be.
Steve hesitated, then nodded, short and curt, a soldier accepting orders. 'I'll be here when you're done,' he said.
But Tony was strong enough. He was smart, and had lived even though his little human heart was damaged, and he was full of rage and terror and all the things that Venom liked. He could be a worthy host.
There was nothing in the world that would have made Tony agree to give up the memory of Steve's smile, the smell of his jacket, the weight of his arm round Tony's shoulders. The sound their footsteps made in fallen leaves when there was no-one else around. The way Steve had looked so pleased with himself in the glimmer of Christmas lights, laughter in his voice as he said,
Despite that, though, the visit had been a success. Peter had loved it; and from the time Stark left to the time he finally fell asleep, he had been busy playing with the phone, and discussing the visit endlessly with Steve, completely overexcited. It had been late when he had finally dropped off, and Steve had been much later getting home than he had anticipated, but he hadn't been able to sleep anyway. He just kept hearing Peter saying goodbye to him all over again, agonising over his own, totally inadequate response. He lay awake most of the night, trying to formulate a better answer, what he would say in the conversation he knew they needed to have, and failing utterly.
Cautiously, Peter twisted round and sat up. The room turned out to be some kind of library, with tons of books and some little tables. There was a man sitting in front of him in a comfy old arm chair, the kind with a really high back, and the man didn't look scary at all, in fact he was smiling kindly and pouring juice into a glass for Peter, the kind with a swirly straw all the way around the outside. Maybe he had been kidnapped too. Peter still felt like something bad was about to happen.
