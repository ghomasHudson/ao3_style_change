Castiel shoots a couple of nervous glances between Dean and the general direction the noise came from before apparently making the decision to go and investigate the increasing noise. He doesn't say anything, just gets up smoothly and vanishes between the shelves like that Pan-thing from the Labyrinth movie Sam made him watch for historical reasons, the freak. Dean hears the shop door being unlocked and opened, then flinches at the sheer loudness of the crowd outside. It's impossible for him to determine what happens next but he guesses since it's him they want and not some nerdy bookseller they won't harm the guy.
His brother doesn’t belief him for even a second. “Sure.”
“Good idea,” Sam agrees, hoping his voice comes out encouraging rather than sarcastic.
"Very well," Castiel murmurs in that gravelly voice of his and finally does sit down on the far end of the couch Dean isn't sitting on, consciously putting as much space as possible between the two of them. It takes a couple of minutes of Castiel looking expectantly at Dean before the mechanic realizes he is the one supposed to be speaking.
Dean didn’t have time to react before something heavy connected with the back of his head.
"Yeah." It was all Dean could offer. This wasn't the moment to promise to get the boy back. It was a moment to honor his memory.
Jerk.
The angel quietly moved into his room of six years.
Thankfully the conversation moves on to general catching up because people are damn curious how stick-up-his-ass Castiel, Wave of Celestial Intent, ended up as Cas, Future Beekeeper Extraordinaire. Everyone except for Ash has their fair share of stories on Cas’s quirks and it warms Dean’s heart to hear his favorite people speak with absolute fondness of what were actually pretty dark times in their lives. Reminiscing over several barely prevented Apocalypses calls for an obscene amount of booze, naturally, and soon Jo completely loses her filter and hangs from Cas’s shoulder while slurring about how she will never forget the line of shots he obliterated back in the day like it was nothing. This in turn prompts Ellen to test if Cas can still hold his liquor, so she places a row of shot glasses before him.
«It was the right thing to do,» Cas said, his voice much calmer again. He wasn’t taking Dean’s bait to escalate the situation even more. «I cannot be out there feeling sorry for myself and running from God. Or you. I fell from Heaven for my beliefs, I won’t abandon them now when they matter most. I’m not here because you want or need my help. I’m here because it is my choice to help. You want to be angry with me? Question my loyalty to you? That is
His intention was to play against the spirit’s ego, not to fuel its rage.
A sudden noise from behind made him still in his tracks, heart freezing in his chest. He was no longer alone. Perhaps he had never been alone to begin with. Shit. His brain was going a hundred miles an hour thinking how he could best maneuver himself in a way that allowed for him to drop the flashlight in favor of grabbing the silver knife at his belt. Even if he ended up with the weapon in his non-dominant hand, it was still a better option than dropping his loaded gun. Taking one last deep breath and ignoring the dreadful stench as he did, Dean steeled himself for whatever was hiding in the shadows behind his back.
It’s not the first time Dean has reacted like this to Castiel’s courage.
“Gross, Dean.”
“Stop groping your snow angel and get your head in the game, you loser!” Jo yells, exposing herself as the culprit.
“Dean! You’re awake!”
Honestly, Dean doesn’t know which is worse but he decides he can’t bring himself to mind either.
, causing a pair of blue eyes to narrow at him in a glare but Cas moves away and climbs into the backseat nonetheless. Dean grins triumphantly as he gets in next to Sam who doesn’t appear to have noticed the whole exchange.
Sam rolls his eyes. “I have
The suggestion earns him an icy glare. “He is warded, Dean. The magic that is keeping his own power contained also protects him from any angelic grace. Did you not listen to
Unfortunately, Dean Winchester is as stubborn as he is beautiful, and he painfully stands his ground.
The mood swings, the excessive drinking, the fidgeting, hell especially the constant look of exhaustion on the angel’s face. This entire time Dean had thought they had been symptoms of Cas’ anger directed toward him- and that had certainly played a part as well- but above anything it was
“Really, Cas?” He’s toeing the line somewhere between ridicule and awe. “Didn’t peg you as the type.”
It takes Sam a long time to answer and Dean remembers that he's probably in class. Usually he would hang up now but this time he's just too freaked. Thankfully Sam seems to be unable to ignore any phone call, so he is greeted with his brother's voice one agonizingly long moment later.
“Alright, Samuel the Wise,” he allows. “Your advice is appreciated.”
In an instant he was by Cas’s side, dragging him into an upright position. “Whoa, buddy.”
"How come you’re still here then? We got Jack back didn't we?" Only to lose him again in a much worse way- but Dean still didn’t want to think about that too hard.
"Aw, crap," he says.
"What, did the mojo put that stick I worked years to get out right back up your ass?"
Unbelievable. Seven people in the entire world, and Sam is sitting in front of one of them. Even if he doesn’t get the job, this visit is already beyond worth it. “I just read about it recently. It was said that true empathy was granted by angels. Is that really the case? Wait, I'm sorry, is it rude to ask?”
The angel closed the laptop and leaned back in his chair but stayed silent. Dean didn't push him, he just waited for a while, not meeting Cas' eyes. "What if I happen to be pissed at
counts as one. Which, to Dean, it does not. Then again, he's still not convinced that the cook book is really the item he saw but after multiple occasions of arguing the matter with Castiel the mechanic has lost the nerve to look into the mystery any further. Especially since the other man always answers him in a tone that allows no discussion.
Cas looks genuinely surprised at those words. “You really think that?”
do you think you're doing?" Castiel hisses. What normal person freaking
“Damn, you’re gorgeous,” Dean says, more to himself than Cas.
He practically fled the room, leaving his scared reflection behind.
“I’m sorry,” Jack mutters, clearly horrified that he hurt him.
,” Cas agreed in a whisper against Dean’s lips, before closing the final gap between them.
, offered the timeout. "I'll be back Monday."
To be reading out of his own free will is odd, to say the least, and Dean is more than a little shocked at how hard he finds it to concentrate on the task at first. He's a grown, friggin' man who's not necessarily stupid and he's having reading difficulties? Please. That's just pathetic. He turns page after page, soaking up the words with determination and- and it really doesn't suck. The story's weird, yeah, but so is anime and he digs that shit.
Cas is just as much of a dumbass as you are and was gonna let this slide, like he let's
“I win?”
“You’re gonna wake up, you hear me,” he tells the still unconscious body in his arms. “I know you’re not done being mad at me but you gotta wake up so you can give me hell for not appreciating you. Although, you have to admit it’s on you too. If I'd known you felt that way I’d have gotten my head outta my ass way sooner.”
«Don’t you
If the previous statement took weight off, then these ones, directed at Castiel as much as Sam, make him float. He hasn’t flown in years, painfully tethered to the ground with only his battered wings to speak of, but Dean Winchester finding it within himself to fight even one more day allows Castiel to soar as high as in his glory days. Far from ready to return to firm ground, he pointedly refrains from promising he will ever put Dean in that cursed box, not unless he’s willing to make room for one more. Resistance is futile and somewhere deep down Dean must know as much because he doesn’t push him for an answer like he does Sam.
A moment later Jack comes racing into the kitchen, closely followed by Sam who ridiculously pretends not to be able to catch up with the kid. “Oh no! Guys Jack is
he can barely fight the disappointment that rises in his throat like bile.
? Dean is tempted to holler, but he keeps quiet and grits his teeth. This ought to be some kind of prank. It's a small town, people get bored. The question that remains is how on earth they got Bobby to play along so enthusiastically.
That was… not something Dean expected. He turns sharply to stare at Castiel who turns about as white as a wall and is just as still as one. "
"That wouldn't by any chance have something to do with Castiel, would it?"
Cas smiles at him again, a truly carefree smile that he doesn’t show often. Just like that the lines are gone from his face. “You
been said.
Castiel recognizes the attempt at reverse psychology and nods his approval, curious about the outcome. It turns out to work quite brilliantly.
“Well, color me impressed,” Dean tells her honestly. The compliment earns him another kiss on the cheek before the girl gets swept up by a mad flurry of reporters. She just single-handedly disarmed a freaking deity, she'll handle herself just fine in an interview.
Dean just sighs with relief at the fact that Sam sounds perfectly sane. "Sammy."
,” Jo comments lazily, before taking her turn. She throws three knives in quick succession. All of them hit the wall within inches of the outlined person, close but not close enough to cause an injury. Dean was already impressed when her skills were part of a show, up close she’s almost predatorial in her precision. Like a cat, ready to pounce when her prey least expects it. When he accepts the last blade from her, his palm is noticeably sweaty.
"Yes, it was very pleasant, thank you." The angel pulled out a chair for himself and took a seat next to Sam, giving Dean a choice to either sit across from him or his brother. The choice was taken from him when Charlie stormed in like a hurricane and dropped down in the chair adjacent to Sam's.
was the scariest thought he’d ever had in his life. A thought he’d been avoiding like the plague until this moment. Because it couldn’t be, could it? Chuck couldn’t have thought
"I don't understand that reference." Castiel doesn't look impressed. "Maybe you should leave the gathering of ingredients to me."
“Oh, I have no doubt about that. It just irks me that he manages everything in spite of them.”
Cas doesn’t look up from his book but there’s the hint of a smile tugging at his lips. “Of course, Dean.”
and that he definitely doesn’t fucking crave the moment it dissolves.
“I found him, Sam, but he’s still stuck there.”
The full extent of the angel’s intoxication became evident when he tried to get to his feet, swaying dangerously. Eileen reacted first, hunter instincts kicking in, and took the cartons from Dean’s hands so he could grab a hold of the unsteady angel. “S’alright, buddy, I gotcha,” he mumbled as he staggered slightly under the added weight on his aching body.
That’s a surprise, considering they went through all this work to find a spell that can contain freaking nephilim grace. “I thought his mojo is offline for now.”
in the middle of Dean’s crisis. “Clearly not in God, but in each other. In family.” With that Cas gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze before the touch disappeared altogether.
- well. It broke his damn heart. He thought he’d been keeping it together, that even while Sam knew he was struggling he didn’t worry too much after seeing how Dean was working, joking and generally trying to be his best self under the circumstances. Obviously he’d done a piss-poor job if all along Sam had practically been waiting for him to snap.
?!" He gestures around them. The witch rolls her eyes dramatically before closing them and chanting something under her breath. A moment later all people except for Dean, Castiel and Meg herself drop to the ground, fast asleep. The blonde opens her eyes and sends Cas a sassy look, as if asking if this is sufficient. "Thank you," Castiel says.
Dean does collapse at long last, and Castiel is there to catch him.
Dean dropped his head onto Castiel's stomach with a groan. "Cas. May I
Castiel smiled appreciatively. "They have great programs, I'm sure he's doing very well."
“Don’t say that, man.”
, Sam.” The blush creeping up his brother’s ears is a tell-tale sign that ‘weird’ barely begins to cover it.
Cas of course didn’t buy it for a second. Just tilted his head pityingly. “Dean.”
“I’ll go for a walk,” he says. He throws the door shut way harder than he needs to as he leaves the room, making Dean flinch.
And holy shit, somewhere mid-chew Dean suddenly remembered where the angel even had had the freaking chance to acquire a taste for blue raspberry slushies as if they were a well-aged liquor. He couldn’t help but laugh, memories of
Dean rolled his eyes at the screen of one of the spare phones they kept, seeing as their work kind of caused them to wreck a fair number of cells annually, and considered not answering at all. Of course Charlie wouldn't just let the whole Cas-thing go without a remark, knowing her she was probably well aware of the whole "
“Yeah.”
and that’s just-- No.
Jack eyes the plate suspiciously. “
The archangel smirks. “Easy fix.”
Cas heaves a sigh in confirmation. “It’s getting easier but he is still half angel. Convincing him to rest is quite the challenge.” He rubs at the back of his neck in one of those inane human gestures he’s picked up over the years. It makes Dean want to reach out and squeeze down on some pressure points he knows would feel awesome. Which just tells him he’s in way over his head with the whole situation already.
Castiel pointedly ignored the faint little flutter in his stomach.
"S'alright, I got him," the first voice said again and apparently it was enough to send the man with the thick accent walking to the next mission with a nod. Castiel stared after him, dumbfounded, until someone tugged gently at his shirt. "C'mon, we need to move."
under his breath when the performers start interacting with the audience. Luckily, no one over the age of twelve has to suffer through the terror of their low effort pranks, but it still takes Sam until the magic act to lose the tension in his shoulders but it seamlessly transfers over to Dean as he is dropped into his own personal hell. It’s one thing to tell your kid brother that his magic is
“Noted,” Katie said, suddenly back to being energetic. “And thank you guys for understanding- but for the record? You suck at your job.”
After another long swig from his bottle, Dean forces a smile. “Nah.”
It got him an eye-roll but with the hint of a smile. “Alright. Once I start with the chant you make the cut and make sure to catch the blood in the bowl. I don’t know what’s going to happen but when I reach the right section, I’ll toss the crystal in. Then we hope for the best.”
Their latest job as far as Sam had found out on the drive when he hadn’t been drooling in the passenger seat, looked pretty cut and dry. College girl cleared out her closet and up and left. Family was worried sick, yadda yadda. From the single phone conversation Dean had had the misfortune of witnessing with the overbearing mother he was already firmly on the girl’s side. Nonetheless, it wasn’t really his job to pick sides any more. He was getting paid to find the girl and your average sorority sis was rarely more elusive than a shifter, which is why it made little sense for his brother to be this engrossed in the details. After working out at ungodly hours in the morning, no less.
It was time to leave.
want, how about you tell me what you
Cas turned around and, probably realizing Dean had been falling behind, quickly made his way back to the hunter. He looked worried. "What’s wrong?"
There's a short silence on the other end. "You sure you're okay? You're not dying, are you?"
They eat in silence for the majority of the meal after that exchange and Dean takes the opportunity to watch the man next to him closely. It's obvious that Castiel is an enthusiastic eater and is in no way too fancy to get his hands greasy, as opposed to what his initial scepticism implied, and Dean thinks the uptight act may be just that: an act. He just knows that there's another side to Castiel Novak, one that only very few people may be aware of, and he's almost desperate to discover that side. Maybe his actions have ruined any chance of ever hooking up with the guy, but that doesn't mean they can't form some sort of dysfunctional friendship, right?
The fact that Cas knew him well enough to come to that conclusion even before Dean himself had made him wonder what else the angel knew. It did a funny thing to his heart that was a mix between anxiety and affection. He was quick to overplay it with a chuckle.
One day he felt brave and put on a smile he knew didn’t reach his eyes and outright asked him how those hours were spent. They were alone in the kitchen after Sam had taken Eileen on a weekend trip. It was a simple inquiry but it felt strangely personal nonetheless, especially when Cas took a long moment to think about his reply. After considering his words he looked openly at Dean, opting not to hide behind any walls or forced brevity. Instead, he spoke in a gentle voice of what he’d been reading, books upon books on human philosophy and existentialism, in search of a new perspective. Staying idle wasn’t in his nature, though ironically Dean had never met anyone who could be as immovably still as Cas when lost in thought. He shared his doubts about doing the right thing by staying out of Heaven, while at the same time expressing how he finally could be certain of his Faith again because this time around it wasn’t a blind decision. Just like every time the topic of Jack came up the love he felt for the kid radiated off him to the point that Dean’s own appreciation felt inadequate somehow. Cas was still Cas, still stood just off center of the room with his hands in his coat pockets, but he somehow looked
"No? I'd say I'll go out there and show you but I don't think I'm ready to face those freaks yet-"
Outside he finds Cas in one of the deck chairs with his legs stretched out in front of him, basking in the perpetual afternoon sunlight that seems to always surround the little cabin. His eyes are closed but they flutter open when he notices he is no longer alone. After that first day, Dean hasn’t managed to startle Cas again. A routine has quietly formed between them, both working in tandem in their respective domains, and Dean’s presence is no longer out of the ordinary.
“They’re probably trying to keep it on the down-low. No reports until it’s necessary,” Dean assured the angel.
"Well, you know. Last time I heard from you, you were using his phone. I'm guessing things went well?" The jerk sounds fare more amused than Dean has any nerve for.
Dean let himself fall backwards onto the ground, heart beating all the way in his throat. Cas dropped to the ground next to him, labored breathing matching his own.
«Cas?»
moving on?”
"No, Sam. Just thought you'd like to know. Sorry if I made you skip class or somethin'."
He soon learned that his brother wasn’t actually the culprit when he caught a glimpse of a familiar tan overcoat while headed for his room. The sight stopped him in his tracks.
Like, it didn't get more fitting than that. Out of context, at least.
“Oh please,” Dean laughs heartily. “If this is already enough to traumatize you, you better never swing by unannounced. Consider this a friendly warning that Naked Thursdays are a thing in this household.”
Sam sits down somewhat stiffly and folds his hands in his lap to stop the innate urge to twiddle his thumbs. He doesn’t remember the last time he was this nervous about a potential job. Sure, editing articles can be rewarding in the sense that he knows he’s helping to further along important scientific work but most of the time it’s incredibly dull. While it does bring in a steady paycheck, it comes with a side of burnout and he’s getting too old to miss out on a chance to break free of the chains of mundane work and finally do something he is passionate about. He is unsure how much time passes with him sitting there listening to the hushed voice of the receptionist as he argues with whoever is on the other end of the line, his tone much less accommodating by now. Just as the receptionist slams down the telephone with a deep sigh, a door opens down the hall.
Jack’s brow furrows for a moment. “I’m a neflim,” he insists, adorably stumbling over the word
Gabriel made an exaggerated
“Let’s do it.”
"It most certainly is not," Castiel says, looking way more offended than he has any right to.
“You asked me if I regretted dragging you from Hell,” Cas continued, staring straight ahead at the brick wall across the room. “I’ve thought a lot about it, and I should, shouldn’t I? But I can say without a doubt that I do not. I could never regret saving you, Dean.” He turned his gaze toward the hunter. “That being said, I refuse to continuously shoulder the blame for everything that goes wrong in your life. I cannot be the sole scapegoat for all our losses and you cannot keep lashing out at me- or others for that matter- when things don’t go your way. If you do, expect to deal with the consequences.”
Sometimes when they didn’t feel like watching a movie – a truly shocking circumstance in Dean’s case – they just sat together by the map table and shared a glass of whatever alcohol they were in the mood for while catching up. Cas told him about how he’d been driving around collecting wayward angels, occasionally against their will, all over the country and even just talking about it the guy sounded drained. In turn, Dean caught him up on their recent hunts where a local salt’n’burn had turned into a shtriga in Nebraska had turned into a vetala in Wisconsin and so on and so forth. He conveniently left out the djinn and the Minnesota siren; no need to talk about those ever again.
He’s aged. There are heavy bags weighing down his eyes as if he hasn’t slept in days, and the lines on his forehead are becoming more prominent. Dean jokingly always warned him not to frown so much, now look what happened. He feels an overwhelming urge to reach out and smooth over the other man’s skin. Instead he finishes his beer.
“What, no
“Why do you seem upset?” There’s worry lines forming on Cas’s face as he asks and Dean finds the urge to smooth them out overwhelming. For a moment he even wonders if he could kiss them away but it’s not the time to test that out. Not with things still needing some clarification.
Somehow the timid honesty makes Dean laugh and he takes a couple of steps toward Castiel to pat him on the shoulder like he would an old friend, squeezing briefly before letting go again. "Happens to the best of us."
“It’s the Empty.”
“Hey,” he says stupidly before going for a hug Cas openly accepts. It’s a brief affair but Dean still allows himself a little squeeze at the tail end of it, overwhelmed by the fact that he has his best friend back against all odds. When he pulls back with a last friendly pat to Cas’s shoulder he flashes a deflecting grin, not quite sure how to move forward from here. “Miss me?”
about taking a step back. There would be no doubt in who Cas belonged with if he had any say in it, and if this kiss was any indication, Dean was sure he could never belong to anyone else in return. It had always been Cas from the very start and it would be Cas to the very end.
By the time he he revved Baby’s engine he didn’t feel all that hungry anymore either.
One more shorter chapter after this so those two idiots can have a serious chat
The bookseller doesn't return for a while and Dean decides that he probably needs some space after his Odyssey to crazy town, not that he can blame the guy. Instead of going upstairs and needling him about what's going on outside, Dean shoulders his bag and returns to what he has come to consider his spot on the couch to read. He gets about as far as five consecutive pages until Castiel reappears after all. His hair is still dripping wet from the rain outside but he changed into a dry pair of sweatpants and a dark blue hoodie. In his hands are two steaming cups.
It quickly becomes clear what this performance is going to be about when the guy reaches into the pocket of his coat to produce a lighter, which he promptly uses to light a large torch standing at the center that must have been placed there while the lights were out. Pocketing the lighter again, he approaches a nearby basket of smaller torches and takes one in hand, spinning it swiftly between deft fingers as he makes his way back to the burning flame.
“No boyfriend.”
At the moment it's simply too fucking loud for a phone call so Dean decides to sneak out back and take the Impala for a drive out of town, he can call Sam from the road. The plan seems great in theory but Dean's hopes are crushed when he quietly walks out into his backyard just to see the same picture as out front; a whole lot of people. Shit.
, Cas."
, he’d called him once in a genuine compliment disguised as a joke. Now he regrets not having said anything more often. In response to his words, Cas casts his eyes downwards, his cheeks growing another shade darker. The blush only adds more truth to the sentiment. Dean pulls him into a hug, shivering when Cas pushes his icy nose into an exposed patch of skin just under his jaw to steal some of his warmth. They stay in their embrace for a little while swaying gently back and forth until a snowball hits them both in the face. That’s what you get for having a snowball fight with a group of highly trained and way too trigger-happy hunters.
When he wakes up the next morning he expects to feel different, possibly even afraid now that the last traces of the adrenaline high and alcohol are out of his system, but he feels nothing of the sort. Cas is snoring softly on the pillow next to him, mouth hanging slightly open and it shouldn't be adorable because Cas used to be a warrior of heaven but now he's human like the rest of them and Dean feels his heart swell in his chest at the sight. Sam unceremoniously ends the moment of peace by tossing a pillow at his head and bitching at him to hurry it up with the googly eyes because they're running late for the airport.
"Sorry," Dean says quickly. "It's just… You're this amazing guy, Cas. You're smart and you know what you want and you're illegally hot. For you to say all those nice things about me- It's hard for me to accept them, alright?"
Satisfied with his findings and at least sixty-seven percent certain that Cas' ritual didn't pose any real danger, Dean closed his laptop and went back to his room. It was getting kind of late and there wasn't much left to do so he kicked off his shoes, shrugged off the flannel he was wearing and dropped down onto his bed, pushing the gun back under his pillow in a practiced motion.
,” Cas finishes calmly for him. “We go to a hospital, or we bite down on a belt while stitching each other up.”
Helplessly, Dean leaned in until their foreheads came to gently rest together. “Arguably that’s part of my charm.”
“I am undoubtedly inebriated. But you feel so
me figure things out. I don’t know who I am either but it feels like I constantly have to prove to you that whatever I am at least I’m not a threat.” He can feel the sting of tears in his eyes but they don’t fall just yet, his voice pleading as he looks between the brothers. “Guys, I’m only three years old.”
Dean sighs and rubs a hand over his face. "I can try, but I'm not making promises."
Next to him Castiel rolls his eyes dramatically and walks away. Just like the first time they talked.
Speaking of Castiel. Out in a single red rowing boat tied to the pier sits a lone, trench-coated figure that makes Dean's heart beat double-time once he catches sight of it. He thanks all higher powers that he was right in looking for the other man here and moves from his spot, casually walking up to Castiel. Once he stands close enough that his shadow falls over the bookseller he clears his throat.
"I- Dean. I'm sorry." Castiel doesn't meet his eyes, just stares at the faded symbols on the cover. Symbols Dean remembers seeing before.
. "It is kind of fitting," he agrees. "What's next?"
"Yes. And then the civil war forced me to steal another angel's grace, destroying all hope for this dream I had."
“I’m painfully aware, yes.” The angel agreed with the faintest hint of a smile in his voice.
?” Dean scoffed, hating the way is voice was on the verge of breaking every time he tried to speak.
and because he's an ass he rolls with the joke and yells, "You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals!" He half-expects a chorus answer back, just like in the movie, but instead he gets whistling and he thinks he sees a girl break into tears because
“Whatever you say, Dean.” To anyone else the statement may have sounded resigned but Dean can hear the genuine fondness ringing through.
fast!” he exclaims theatrically.
"I told you," Sam boasts. "I knew you couldn't resist a challenge."
Despite his best efforts he finds that while he doesn’t exactly like the guy, hating him is impossible.
“Cas, I chose this,
, Sam." Dean actually does end the call, mumbling "Bitch" under his breath. A moment later his phone vibrates just before he pushes it back into his pocket.
Gilda is clearly fighting a smile as she thanks him, while Jo and Charlie aren’t as polite and are losing themselves in a fit of giggles. Castiel remains stoic, though when Dean dares to look at him again there’s a spark in his eyes that wasn’t there previously.
Of all the possible locations they could be forced to go to for a case, a circus may not seem too terrible but between the menagerie of large balloon animals and an abundance of cotton candy, it’s Dean’s personal hell as he navigates a minefield of children with uncomfortably sticky hands and the wet wipe brandishing parents chasing after them. Luckily Sam towers over most of the crowd as per usual, making it easy to weave through the maze of people as they try to find a pair of seats that give them a good vantage point over the circus arena. The show isn’t scheduled to start for another fifteen or so minutes and while they had tried to get a little innocent looksee behind the scenes, it didn’t take long for a pretty redhead with a sweetly faked smile to usher them back to the public area. For now they have no choice but to settle on keeping an eye on the colorfully dressed performers that are mingling with the crowd to warm them up for the show.
So yeah, Cas was everything.
And if this whole thing also means that Dean and Cas could finally get their heads out of their asses and make life easier for all of them that’s even better.
Dean shrugs, not quite seeing what Cas is getting at with all this. “Isn’t that what the lady at the daycare said would happen?”
, Dean thinks, though what comes out of his mouth is, “Thought it was some dumb stage name.”
For a moment it looks like Cas wants to protest but his expression turns thoughtful as he stares into empty space somewhere beyond Dean’s shoulder. “A fireplace,” he finally says.
“Yes. Please.” Dean gasps, his brain reduced to scattered words as his climax creeps closer. “You.”
listening.”
about this?"
“You… did not make that very clear.”
way to pick up scattered book pages but apparently he found one if he is to believe Castiel.
“Oh, shut up.” He loves Sam but his brother really is a nuisance when he realizes he has the moral high ground, and Dean is a sore fucking loser. “I’m gonna hit the hay for a couple hours.”
. Sure the denim stretches a bit too tight over Cas’s thighs and who besides
There is no way to track the time that passes like this, during those unending summer days. No one complains about a prolonged absence when he does show up at the Roadhouse to share a beer with his friends while Cas is out on Heavenly business, his parents welcome him warmly whenever he pops by with an offering of freshly baked pie he picks up on the road. Bobby never asks for his toolbox back, just calls him an
At some point when the snow had first started to fall more steadily, Dean had remembered the blizzard warning but expertly ignored it. Now the relentless wind blowing sharp little ice crystals in his face made ignoring it difficult. He could barely see Cas in his dark parka in front of him even with just a few feet of space between them. If he was completely honest, he wasn’t even sure which direction they were headed anymore. Cas seemed to be thinking along the same lines.
’ counted but it was all they had. They set up a large copper bowl in the center of the devil’s trap in the dungeon, a room Dean had religiously avoided since this whole mess started. The spell scroll didn’t mention anything of the sort but Sam had come up with the theory that maybe the closer they were to the spot where the Empty had broken through last time, the better their chances were to open a portal now. Dean was beyond coherent thoughts at this point.
After all, he was everything.
“Don’t need you two joining forces, is all I’m saying,” Dean grumbles defensively, interrupting Sam’s lament over the will-they-won’t-they dynamic between his brother and the angel.
Sam gives him a look like,
For a long time they sit in companionable silence as Dean drinks, something clearly on his mind.
"Gee, thanks," Dean says with a chuckle, basking in the other man's almost-approval more than he probably has any right to.
, not even under these circumstances. "Why do they even buy this?" he asks miserably after a long enough pause for Castiel to get a hold on himself.
The glare Cas sent his way made it clear that his joke wasn't appreciated.
Just for a moment.
But for tonight, they can bask in the burning embers that are once more ready to burst into flames.
Rowena gives him a minute or two to look around before she points him toward a large pompously upholstered chair. Sam sits down obediently, trying and failing not to look ridiculous as he sinks into the soft cushions while the witch drapes herself on a nearby sofa with almost ethereal grace. Her inquisitive gaze never leaves Sam even while a flick of her wrist produces a selection of papers out of thin air. Sam recognizes it as his application. His mouth feels uncomfortably dry as he watches her skim the pages, clicking her tongue.
At some point Sam stumbles past in the hallway and peeks inside the room as well to check on Jack. He doesn’t seem too surprise to find them huddled together on the boy’s bed, just offers a warm smile and mouths his
At that moment it didn’t matter what had happened with God, or Lucifer or Mom. All that mattered to Dean was Cas.
"Is that your brother?" Dean's entire disposition changed from one second to the next as he pushed the icepack into Castiel's hand and straightened himself up. "Are you his brother?!"
With the spotlight following him, Castiel dips the fire closer toward the audience, as if to prove that the flames are real. Dean is sitting too far away to feel any heat but judging by the audience’s reaction in the rows closer to the performance, it’s real alright. The light dims again once Castiel returns to the center, the still burning torches lifted up high in an akimbo impression of Lady Liberty. He makes an artform out of extinguishing one of the torches by wrapping his long fingers one by one around the burning torch head to snuff out the flame. Ironically, focusing this closely on the man’s hands makes heat flare in Dean’s stomach even while he watches the fire die.
- than have a conversation about it.
The spell didn’t actually call for any ingredients beyond the crystal and the blood of someone who had been to the Empty. Dean didn’t now if ‘
, Dean. Do you want me to go or not?" The other man doesn't look at him. Instead he stares out the window, obviously assessing the situation outside. The street is as busy as on any day, meaning it's not overrun by the Dean Winchester Fan Club. Yet.
. And I was too fucking late. They- I mean they couldn’t have been older than
“You don’t look ridiculous.” The voice startles him, even though he recognizes it easily.
. With wants and needs and a history that should have stretched over a literal eternity but was really just compressed into a good dozen years. He’d always been an individual, Dean wasn’t completely stunted, but Cas had always been so much bigger than them, his struggles so mighty, that all those times that he had tried to express himself on a more grounded level- through
Once in the driver’s seat he checked his phone. Since he’d paid for the room upfront on arrival, they were ready to leave but the angel was still nowhere to be seen. As his thumb hovered above the call icon Dean found himself missing the old days where Cas had just been a thought away. Just as he was about to call, the door on the passenger side was yanked open and Cas plopped into the seat, awkwardly balancing two vending machine coffees. He handed one to Dean.
The door was without a lock, allowing easy access. Which was good too, seeing as Dean’s legs felt so frozen he doubted he could have kicked it in. Once inside, Cas immediately collapsed against the wall, sliding to the ground. He definitely had used a great deal of what limited power he had on saving Dean’s ass and making sure they got somewhere safe.
It immediately snaps Dean out of his stupor and he too climbs into the car. Castiel can’t deny his disappointment at the loss of intimacy as he slides into the back seat next to Jack. Before Dean starts the car he turns to look over his shoulder as if to check on them. “So Jack, what do you think? You gonna join the seraphim or the-- cherub
They only allowed themselves to rest for a short while, just enough so they didn’t feel like they were dying anymore, basically. It felt anticlimactic without having a body there as they gathered everything they had dropped and assessed their respective injuries.
Dean's head shoots up mid-sentence when someone clears their throat loudly and he drops the book on the floor in his surprise. Castiel is back, looming in the shadows of one of the heavy shelves dividing the room and glaring darkly. Dean shudders at the sight, the hairs on his arms standing up.
“They’re disgusting,” Jo complains seemingly out of principle.
Dean realizes he’s still got the angel trapped against the wall. “Nope,” he insists, pushing off the tile and taking a few liberating steps backwards. “Cas was just going to his room”
For a long moment they shared a look of understanding before the vibration of a phone broke the silence. Dean snatched the device in question from Katie’s hand once she’d dug it out of her pocket. The notification was a reminder of an upcoming bus departure. “Guess you better get going.”
Dean had to live with his best friend being dead. Probably worse than dead. Not that he’d claim to be very familiar with the exact rules of the Empty and the Shadow residing within it but from the few glimpses he’d caught it hadn’t looked like a relaxing stay. Loss was a terrible thing to deal with as it was, even without the added burden of knowing that the subject of your grief was simultaneously gone for good and also being held hostage in a twisted afterlife. Still, he could consider himself somewhat of an expert in dealing with it, had experienced everyone he loved being sucked into countless versions of Heaven, Hell and everything in between. His coping methods were far from healthy reaching from flat out denial and throwing himself over-enthusiastically into the joys of mundane events, all the way to taking a book out of his late friend’s legacy and drinking what might as well have been an entire liquor store. While the scale between those end-points was in its entirety meant to numb him to the point that he could survive somehow, he couldn’t claim that it made him oblivious to the pain his actions caused the people left around him. Sam knew better than to bring it up, just silently resigned himself to clearing away the remnants of whiskey-fueled nights of despair while Dean was out cold, or serving grease-soaked depression meals on the rare occasions he found him awake and sober. One day it would become easier, or at least less crippling, to live with the fact that everything they had accomplished, the world they had saved, it had all ended in a roundabout way like it had begun; with an angel giving up all he he had for Dean.
Even with a small flame dancing in the fireplace, Dean knew that it would take a while for the room to warm up and as far as he cold see there were no blankets that would help his body return to a more endurable temperature. There were, however, thick green curtains framing the single window close to where Cas was huddled. The hunter made quick work out of pulling them from their rod and pulling one around his own shoulders while using the other one to cover the angelic ball of misery at his feet.
Once Cas is also settled under the covers next to him Dean rolls over to send him one last stern look.
Dean was overwhelmed enough that he felt his throat closing up, making breathing just that much harder and a part of him knew that Cas was being honest here, that he truly did have so much trust in Dean even after all the disaster and tragedy he had brought to the angel. Dean blew air out of his nose, trying to steady his racing heart. "Just... look at yourself for a moment, Cas. You had it all, a family, a home, your wings. And okay yeah maybe your siblings are a bit screwy and have genocidal tendencies every once in a while- who doesn't?!- and Heaven worked before we came along and caused a shitstorm. ...and I
That's how they end up next to each other on the couch once more. Dean cradling a beer in his hand and distractedly watching the game and Cas next to him with his nose buried in the well-worn copy of
Instead of an answer, Dean started the car. The engine’s familiar rumble further added to his peace of mind. He carefully maneuvered the Impala out of the garage and onto the road. Instead of driving toward Lebanon’s city limits he chose one of the less frequented back roads. Now with the stretch of the open road ahead, and the quiet angel next to him he felt incredibly dumb for letting his fears get the better of him.
"May need some more convincin'." They somehow leaned in closer and closer during the conversation, their voices hushed and intimate while Castiel's hand still rests on Dean's shoulder as if he wishes to leave a permanent mark there.
Not much later they did indeed stumble across the mine, almost by accident. Its entrance was hidden by shrubbery and on top of that the blizzard had almost completely covered it with snow. If it hadn’t been for Cas paying such close attention to their surroundings, Dean was sure he would have walked right past it.
“Guess Gabe’s been keeping him on his toes pretty good,” Dean offers. “Though the thing about Cas is he always comes back, eventually. Like a boomerang.”
“Great,” Dean pipes up from the sidelines. “He went full on
When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop
Sam got back mid-morning the next day and Dean immediately knew something was up. He knew his brother enough to recognize his nervous glances that gave away he was trying to keep something from Dean. He also knew that this time Cas wasn't in on it either.
"What is that crap anyway, huh?" Dean hollers after him. "A fruit? A mix of herbs?"
After a quick break to switch out his torches, Castiel faces the audience with a smile. He casually twirls an unlit torch between his long fingers before igniting with an almost imperceptible flick of his wrist toward the main flame like the show-off he is, even if it’s not intentional. He then goes through a smooth transition of movements, almost dancing through his performance as he presents trick after trick, making the flame jump from one torch to the next. The movements become faster and faster, almost hypnotizing in their complexity as the flames spin around the artist. Dean’s head is almost swimming from a mix of anxiety, awe and let’s face it
“What did you do?” Cas asks, still looking at Dean. Sam suppresses the laughter that threatens to spill out of him. The angel has been here a total of maybe two minutes and he already sounds completely done with his brother.
The moment was ridiculous, really. The two of them red in the face from laughing more than either of them ever had and staring each other down like they were trying to read the answers to all of Existence in the other's eyes. "C'mere," Dean said quietly, his voice rough from laughing so hard, and held out his hand. Cas pushed back in his chair and got up, grasping Dean's palm. There was no question about any of this anymore, not in Dean's head. He just tugged at Cas' hand until he stood close enough for Dean to see the different shades of blue in his eyes. He placed Cas' hand on his own chest, allowing the other to feel his skipping heart, and held it there with one of his hands, while the other came up to cup Cas' cheek. "You deserve so much better," he whispered, biting back all the other sappy shit that threatened to spill.
“Oh?” Dean made what he hoped was a surprised face. “That’s good, isn’t it?”
“And now that’s what you see over and over whenever you’re not keeping busy.”
Dean grimaced, feeling out of his element. “Cas, you know I’m not great at the whole… emotional… apology…thing.”
“Yes, Dean,” Jack replied thoughtfully, his mannerisms again bearing a striking resemblance to Cas. “Castiel told me this would happen. I did not believe him.”
"Okay. Good." Sam sounds reassured. "Love you too."
“Well,” Dean said thickly, getting ever so slowly lost in their little staring contest. “S’not supposed to be easy, is it?”
There’s some clapping but not much happens otherwise. Clearly this
"You know what, it's too early for this shit," he says, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I'll go get some work done while avoiding Garth. You tell whoever put you up to this that it's not friggin' funny, got it?"
. And if you call out to me, I'll hear it. All your pain, all your fear, all your pleas to get you out of there. Do you have
, he adds mentally.
When the tour reaches the kitchen, Cas makes sure to find his eyes to silently ask if he’s okay. Dean nods yes, in complete disbelief once more over what he did to deserve this. Sam seems oblivious to the exchange, or at least he chooses not to comment on it when he spots Miracle chasing after a butterfly through the open window. He’s out the door so fast, Dean barely has the time to process that
“Quite the opposite. You’re trying to avoid the spark, but I will gladly guide you into the flames nonetheless. If this is the only chance we get so be it, but I
“That makes you think it’s our kind of disappearances?” Don’t get him wrong, he’d welcome a case. But also, it was a long freaking drive to Montana.
- love him like that, so deeply and unconditionally despite knowing him inside and out, he wanted to be worth it. He wanted to break free from the shackles of his anger and be the man Cas saw when he looked at him.
Briefly Dean wondered if Cas was going to bring up the previous night's incident when the angel looked like he was trying to say something but in the end he just sighed somewhat resignedly, cast a sideways glance at Dean and left without another word. Not two seconds later Dean felt the phone in his pocket buzz to life with two consecutive messages and he got it out without really having to look at the ID to know who was texting him. Of course it was Charlie.
buttons a flannel all the way up, but apart from that it’s a good look on the angel. Domestic. Dean likes it so much he forces himself to look away and instead focuses on the dishes he’s scrubbing so he won’t keep staring.
“You’re singing again,” Cas observes with a smile in his voice.
“Dean.” Cas squeezes his shoulder, forcing him to look up into imploring blue eyes. “Don’t do this to yourself.”
’ and b) ‘
Castiel gets that dangerous glint in his eyes again and Dean instinctively shrinks back from it. "You do realize this is a
“Yeah, sure, but that don’t mean you couldn’t have dropped by every once in a while. I mean c’mon, it takes me longer to go on a beer run than it took you to get your ass here today.”
, hearing the words still scrambles his insides in the most ridiculous way. Between Cas’s adoring look and his Han Solo moment, it’s physically impossible not to smile like the love-struck idiot he is.
So forget the olive branch.
The witch's expression changes to one of utter amusement as she turns to face Cas fully, a low chuckle escaping her. "What do you think, Clarence? He learnt his lesson yet?"
“Fifty-one. So far.”
“Fine. You don’t look more ridiculous than anyone else in attendance.”
They must have, or they would have let him go, not risked one of their own getting a blade caught in a major artery. It’s really not fair because all this does is prove Sam right and there’s nothing worse than that in Dean’s book. With a deep sigh, he steels himself for his defeat. Aiming carefully at a spot above Castiel’s shoulder, just in case, he throws the last knife.
. Damn it, you idiot,
Cas stops the gentle rocking motion long enough to shoot another glare over Jack’s shoulder. “I panicked,” he explains sourly before powering through another chorus line of
Castiel hums thoughtfully, still looking so very serious as he says, “Somehow I highly doubt that, but to each their own.” There’s a small pause during which he tugs on the leather straps, tightening them just enough for Dean to become very aware of his own fluttering pulse. “Now, you seem like someone who deserves a second chance. I will therefore give you a choice here. You can tell me your actual name and what has you snooping around my family with half an arsenal in your pants.” Dean only barely resists making a comment about how his arsenal is fully equipped, thank you, but Cas steamrolls on. “
Dean exhaled in what should have been a laugh but lacked the commitment. “Well, not all of us are glowing with the aftermath of getting laid but I wasn’t gonna say anything.”
Dean wants to say yes, but he cannot bring himself to force the words past his lips. Then he remembers that thanks to Cas’s skill he maybe doesn’t have to. He just thinks about how much he wants this and hopes that the feeling is strong enough for Cas to pick up on.
I'm trying to wrap this up by the end of the year, so there's some more sweetness to come.
he hurls around when addressing the guy. Truth is, he has no fucking clue what to do with any of this or if he even wants to do anything at all. Plus, regardless of what he
“It’s a lovely story. What made you choose it for Jack?”
Dean pulls a face. "Think I'll pass, thanks."
Dean frowns at his phone screen. If Sam doesn't know the little shop it must mean that it only opened sometime after he and Jo left for college. That would explain why Dean never noticed it there before and now that he thinks about it he believes he faintly remembers a record store being in its place. Dean finishes the last bites of his bagel and grabs the napkin below the plate to wipe his fingers when his phone vibrates again only now the buzzing is accompanied by the first tunes of Back in Black.
“More than okay.” Cas’s other hand comes to rest across Dean’s, fingers teasing over his knuckles in the ghost of a touch that makes Dean’s stomach explode with something he’s still kind of reluctant to call butterflies. “Though unless you want to explain this development to your brother I suggest you step away.”
“Dean, you’re blocking the way for other customers,” Cas said, voice dipping low in warning as if
“She did sound pretty distressed.” To his credit, Sam looks apologetic.
"Very well. I will comment on the obvious issue once and you will listen to me closely, alright?" Cas didn't wait for an answer, he just continued. "An angel's wings are not comparable to anything in this realm, it's nothing like another appendage, regardless of the manifestation that you were able to see the shadows of. Yes, they enable an angel to fly and they are considered very precious. And yes, it hurt… like
“Hey, don’t hate the player, hate the game,” Kalanie tries to cheer him up. “Who knows. It might have worked out for you if someone hadn’t beaten you to it by a couple of years.” She slightly raises her left hand to show off the wedding band on her finger, adding further to Dean’s embarrassment but also making him aware that her arm is actually in a cast.
It’s not a subject he’s eager to discuss at this point, maybe ever, so instead he attempts to steer the conversation away from himself. “So, how come you’re this surprised to see me? Didn’t your angel mojo give you a little warning or something?”
Dean decided that whatever was going on, if it was dangerous Cas would have said something. Therefore, Dean secured his gun again and retreated as silently as he could. On a whim he decided on looking up Cas' browser history on his laptop to see if that gave away anything on whatever the heck the angel was doing. The computer was still in the war room where Cas had pushed it out of the way. Dean's stomach flipped at the recent memory but he was quick to dismiss the feeling before it could get a hold on him.
isn't the word I'd use," Dean growls, "although what I'm thinking of definitely rhymes with it." He takes a couple of deep breaths to calm himself before getting up, careful not to lose the open page. "Please tell me there's something in here that tells us how to get a hold of 'er."

, so don’t overthink it.”
Dean shrugs, deliberately taking a less than ideal stance so as not to give away that he actually knows what he’s doing here. He throws the knife. It connects with the wall handle first and falls into the grass. Charlie gives him a pitying “
The look Sam gave him very clearly stated that
Dean grumbles something unintelligible, embarrassed at just how unprepared they’ve stumbled into this case. Seriously though, who in their right mind knows the founding members of
It’s not getting him into the bath that’s the problem. He loves it, with the bubbles and the little boat he gets to play with. Getting him out once he’s clean and his little fingers are all pruned is another issue entirely, which is why once the time comes Sam holds his breath in a silent prayer to no one in particular.
“Well, we’re not in Kansas anymore,” Cas deadpans.
With that Sam grabbed his empty bottle and got up to walk off, leaving Dean stunned. For a long time he remained sitting at the table, tracing the wood pattern with his eyes as he waited for his mind to un-blank. In a way he wanted to be mad at Sam for having said all those things but he knew that anger would be misplaced. After all, Sam hadn’t brought up anything Dean didn’t already know. He knew Cas had been his weakness, and so had most of their enemies. They had been used as leverage to get the other to do whatever was needed for longer than he cared to admit. He could never bear the thought of Cas getting hurt any more than when it came to Sam but that was because they were the only ones of his family that he had been able to save throughout he years. Over and over again. Until now. It was still so unreal that this time was different and it was just him and Sam left. For so many years that had been his biggest goal in life, saving his little brother and the two of them facing the world together no matter what. He’d held onto that so fiercely that maybe somewhere along the way he had missed the fact that the goal posts had been moved. Now that he found himself right there at the bunker with his brother alive and no more apocalyptic threats looming over their heads, he felt no relief. Just emptiness. Like in all those years he had fought so hard to have a life that he ended up forgetting to live it altogether. Thinking back, he could vividly remember so many regrets and the times he had felt like he’d let down the people he cared about, yet he had to put a disappointing amount of effort into finding the happy memories he knew were sprinkled in there somewhere. Not lastly the moments of contentment he had allowed himself ever since they’d found the bunker years ago. The fact that they had a place to come home to from a hunt that was only theirs, a place where they could provide shelter to their friends and those who needed it.
“If you’ve been paying any attention to the show, you already have a pretty good idea about what Cas and I are doing. We’re the experts in handling dangerous goods, if you will.”
"Do you think I’m dumb or something? ‘
“I don’t know what else to say...”
Dean shakes his head because it's one thing to go on paid leave for no reason but another entirely to accept extra money he neither needs nor deserves "S'alright, Bobby."
Enough time passes that Dean manages to prep a loaf of garlic bread and place it in the oven, then his brother strolls back inside all by his lonesome.
Looking around the room he tried hard to conjure a pleasant feeling but only when his eyes landed on the iron staircase leading down from the bunker’s entrance did he realize what was keeping him from letting go. The fact that Cas would never walk down those steps as he dropped by to check on them or whine at them in a feeble effort to mask the fact that he cared. Dean would never again roll his eyes at a pseudo lecture he was forced to listen to after making a deal that Cas would have taken in a heartbeat as well. He’d never again share a victory bottle of whiskey with the only person who could hold their liquor better than him even if that was cheating. He’d never get to feel his stomach drop as he realized it was an angel he was bitching at when a glare told him that he was on thin ice. The fact that all of this came to his mind at once forced the realization out of him that maybe Sam was right. He owed it to Cas to examine the reasons why it was that the damn angel had such a hold on seemingly every fiber of his being. He just wasn’t sure he’d survive the answer once he found it.
. Weirdo. In short, Cas had a good handle on the whole being a person thing, and Dean was done going easy on the guy.
In the distance the empty roadside grew slightly more lively with more buildings appearing in the distance. "Guess it’s the Diner?" Dean mused. Sam was non-responsive until they were parked in front of the small roadside establishment.
"Yeah?"
do you know an old book place on main st?
'Course he's not wrong. "What?"
much to Sam’s initial joy and increasing regret, though while some things changed, others remained the same. This is how, months later when spring was already well on its way into summer, Dean was storming through the bunker in his dead guy robe, absolutely fuming as he carried two empty jars that had tumbled out of the kitchen shelf when he had reached for the coffee.
“Who?”
Just another way to toy with his feelings.
“Easy to say that
Without further ado, Dean stalked on in the hopes of getting the upper hand through a surprise attack.
. And he had that… that whole speech ready and all I could do was stand there like a fucking idiot.”
Finding themselves in an investigative cul-de-sac, the brothers shift their focus to the victims. Upon closer inspection and by cross referencing phone records and ticket purchases, it turns out that each person that disappeared actually did attend a show, or was at the very least in close proximity to where the circus was set up around the time they were last seen, making it highly unlikely that Halo isn’t involved one way or another.
Sam helps Jack with the last spoonful of his rice, then asks, “Ready to put on your shoes and meet some friends?”

The implication of Dean regaining Cas’ trust being a potential trigger to lose him entirely was too much to handle right then. "Cas, no. We gotta do something!"
And yeah well, that’s an invitation for a kiss if Dean’s heard it, so he doesn’t leave Cas hanging and instead charges forward until there’s finally no space between them at all. It’s not desperate or dirty, there’s plenty of time for both of that later. It’s a saccharine promise of commitment that they’ve both needed from each other but so stubbornly withheld for way too long and it’s
“No one likes a cheater,” Jack retorts as he determinedly squeezes his eyes shut. It’s a quote he copied from Dean one day when he caught Sam peeking into his cards during a lazy game of UNO. Something in Castiel’s chest tightens at the way Jack mimics the exact inflection in Dean’s voice, overwhelmed by the familiarity it implies between the two, but he doesn’t get a chance to see Dean’s reaction before the ritual commences.
“I had my reasons back then.”
"Top of the morning, bitches. Is that coffee?" She immediately reached for the still steaming can and filled her cup. "Got any cream?"
With that the first tear draws its path down his cheek but Jack won’t let the Winchesters see. His whole body trembles with his anger and his hurt, everything he has been pushing down the last two days buzzing under his skin all over again, this time tenfold. The walk to his room passes in a blur, he may even have utilized his grace to get there but he can’t be sure. Back in his sanctuary he crawls into bed to hide under the covers, making several nougat wrappers rain onto the floor in the process. He’s crying now, ugly sobs tearing their way from deep within his chest. He remembers the little girl from the playground and wishes hopelessly that someone, anyone, will come and hold him and gently rock him back and forth until the pain goes away.
Dean sighs and trots over to the biggest window of his living room, the one that should be facing the majority of the people. As he opens the curtains he feels to equal parts like laughing and crying because this is just plain ridiculous. Everyone's still right where he left them the previous day and once they spot him all hell breaks loose as the entire crowd erupts into even louder cheers. The whole scene ridiculously reminds him of
Just as Castiel was about to either protest or defend himself a lanky guy game walking toward them, holding a blue icepack. In passing he handed it over to Dean who gently pressed it against the swollen side of Castiel's face.
Sam rolls his eyes. Dean has been making a fuss for the better part of a week over this, especially the part where they all have to show up together for an interview, meaning they have to act accordingly. Not that they’d have to do much acting with the way they’ve been dancing around each other since Cas came to stay but Sam sure as hell isn’t going to say
is what you choose to comment on? Maybe I was too hasty in complimenting your character."
Dean took advantage of that by startling it with a swift jerk of his knee. He hit it in the stomach, probably not causing a lot of pain or damage but still hard enough to throw it off kilter. The brief moment its grip loosened on him was enough for Dean to yank his hand free and take a hold of the silver knife at his belt that had so far been hidden underneath his canvas jacket.
When he turned around, Castiel was tempted to just continue spinning and walk into the other direction because the guy he found himself in front of, the guy whose behind he had been ogling not two minutes ago, was even more stunning from a standing perspective. Immediately Castiel felt his cheeks grow warm. He followed the other man without a word, not that he would have been able to utter something coherent in his befuddlement. They walked along the entire length of the stage until they came to a makeshift gate where other men in the same attire as the one in his company did watched the crowd closely.
Contrary to all the worst case scenarios that have robbed Sam of sleep since the transformation, the three of them manage life as full-time nephilim entertainers quite well. Sure, Jack’s favorite word is ‘
It should have been timid, cautious, but they had wasted so much time with waiting that they had exhausted all their combined restraint. Cas all but climbed into his lap as he charged forward, fervently kissing him back. The way his mouth moved against Dean’s spoke volumes of how very much he loved him, yet he still offered him the words whenever they broke even just a breath apart. Dean held him close, ignoring the way his body protested under his weight and the uncomfortable position on the floor, taking the pain as penance for every lost opportunity that had kept them from this precise moment. His head spun and his lungs ached but he could not find it in himself to break the kiss and risk losing the taste of Cas’s lips in the space between them, even knowing he would have a full human life of stealing it over and over again. When it got to be too much after all he cursed under his breath and touched his forehead to Cas’s to give them both a chance at finding some semblance of composure. They sat there for a moment longer, sharing foolish smiles, before Dean dragged himself away and onto his feet, hauling Cas with him.
have been, because even Dean hadn't known he was going in for a kiss until three seconds ago. But if Cas was really, truly surprised he did one hell of a job at overplaying it seeing as he was right there with Dean, kissing and biting like it was the only thing left to do for them at that moment in the empty bunker kitchen, between stainless steel and empty glass bottles.
Dean jumps what feels like a foot in the air and spins around to find himself eye to eye with, well, very blue fucking eyes. He exhales shakily. "Dude, anyone ever tell you to get a bell?" The look he gets in return clearly asks which asylum he escaped from and Dean wants to explain what he meant by that when his brain suddenly catches up and he realizes that the guy
Listen, you guys. I have a final coming up tomorrow (or today I guess, seeing as it's 5 am here) and have reached peak procrastination. So basically what that means is I've more or less finished this story just in time before I'll be leaving for Christmas break.
the store I have not yet had to worry about fire posing imminent danger to my books." Castiel sends a smug look over his shoulder, a distant smile tugging at his perpetual frown.
Thankfully, Cas continued. “Chuck is not a masochist. He’s always been a sadist. If he had a choice, he would not have let things go on for as long as he has.”
«We had a plan!»
Suffering from cabin fever, Cas had volunteered to take his beat-up Lincoln on their weekly grocery run, relieving Dean of that particular duty. In turn, Dean was now in the garage hosing down Baby after a much needed wash. Steppenwolf was blasting from the crappy radio on the nearby workbench with Dean butchering half the notes as he sang along. Over the music he almost missed the insistent vibrations coming from his pocket. Fingers slippery with water and soap residue, he barely managed to fish out his phone to look at the incoming texts. All of them were from Cas.
Dean followed Sam’s gaze. The door led into a dark corridor. “Shit. The buildings in this street are connected, aren’t they?”
"Good," Dean nodded once, ignoring the fact that his heart was beating just a bit too fast after the exchange. He deflected as best as he could. "So come on, let's go and gank a mountain man."
It took him another moment to fully collect himself before he rose to his feet, making sure to still have his gun. Keeping his left hand protectively over his collar to keep it in place, he aimed at the ongoing battle between Cas and… what looked to be a giant horse? So he hadn’t been going completely insane, good to know.
in fact enjoy being away as much as Dean had convinced himself over the summer.
Cas’s hand doesn’t leave him, instead kneads into his bicep before Cas uses the leverage to drag Dean closer until they finally,
None of that mattered now as Dean towered above where Cas was doting on a little patch of flowers with slightly hanging heads, a frown on his face. "Cas," he growled, allowing his anger to simmer under the name.
“I-” Cas blinks a couple of times before he seems to regain his ability to speak. “That may very well be, but things had changed between us. I wasn’t- I didn’t know-”
Granted, those weren’t the words he’d imagine to get as a reply, even without actually saying anything first. Still, it was such an undeniably

and grabs the towel a little tighter before heading into the room that's been pointed out to him. The bathroom is small and lacks personality as all other rooms do in the apartment so far but as long as there is hot water Dean is easy to please. On the vanity he finds a stack of clothes that are probably intended for him and for a millisecond Dean feels an odd tug somewhere in his chest at the gesture. He shrugs the feeling off and instead begins to strip out of his clothes, tossing everything into the corner behind the door. Not a minute later he finds himself relaxing under the assault of an almost too-hot stream of water, rolling his shoulders and biting back a small groan of pleasure. He can literally feel the grime and worries of the day being washed off him and disappearing down the shower drain and it's absolutely glorious.
Cas was being even more quiet than usual, Dean noticed. He didn’t touch any of the pizzas, instead opting for some bourbon out of the one liquor cabinet that had so far been spared by Dean. Drowning his sorrows in booze in true Winchester fashion. Had it been a healthier habit, the hunter would have been proud.
“Dean...” A disoriented pair of blue eyes blinked up at him and suddenly Dean felt stupid for ever having fallen for nothing but poor imitations.
“Yeah.” Dean got up from his chair and started pacing the room as he felt his own vision blur. “Yeah you did. By accident.” He cleared his throat. Talking about this he had expected to be angry. Instead there was shame. “God knows I’ve done worse things on purpose.” The irony of the statement wasn’t lost on him, seeing as God had likely been the driving force behind a lot of those atrocities. Instead of thinking too much about that he looked at Jack, whose face had confusion written all over it. “We always do what we think is the best we can. Sometimes it bites us in the ass. Sometimes it’s worth it.”
It takes barely a moment after he rings the bell for the door to buzz open and he steps inside. He is once more surprised to find himself in a somewhat bland reception area. A man with dark hair is talking on the phone in the stilted tones of a typical customer service voice. Sam recognizes it from the call he got a few days before, asking him to come in for today’s interview. When the man looks up, he sends Sam a polite smile and motions for him to take a seat. There’s a group of chairs huddled around a glass coffee table that create a waiting area just marginally more inviting than the one at a dentist’s office, made more so by the lack of patronizing magazines about dental hygiene.
. In the meantime Sam had put his energy into coming up with a business model that would allow them to use their respective skills in a less salt’n’burn and more investigative way.
Dean hums his acknowledgment just as Cas’ drink is placed on the counter. When the barkeeper asks if he would like another beer, he briefly considers also switching over to whiskey but figures the headache the next day won’t be worth it. He shakes his head no, deciding to stop altogether for now. Cas notices and raises a questioning eyebrow. How the angel can read him so well even after months of radio silence is a mystery to Dean. To him it feels like he’s looking at a distant memory that’s starting to fade and feel foreign. He doesn’t know this Cas like he used to.
In a thundering blast the entire bunker is illuminated by an unnaturally gleaming, all-encompassing flash of light.
“You’re worth it, Dean. I promise you.”
"Oh," was all Dean managed to say to that, foot thoroughly lodged in his mouth.
"Is that jumpsuit new?"
"It's, uh, Castiel Novak's," Dean explains curtly, already blushing with a sense of foreboding. There's no way he told Sam about a bookstore and its asshole owner without his geeky brother looking it up online. And there definitely
He doesn’t talk to the Winchesters for two days. Doesn’t even come out of his room. All he needs is stored away in the drawer by his bed in the form of super sized nougat bars, courtesy of Gabriel. Sometimes he hears nervous pacing outside his door, each step radiating Sam’s hesitation before he ultimately moves on every time. Maybe he is under the impression Jack went to sleep or is recharging, which is ironic. Since the nightmares started, sleep is far more draining than keeping himself awake for however long he can. Although he hasn’t been doing much at all he feels exhausted as he lies on his bed, gaze locked on the ceiling. Ever since the few hunters they managed to save from the other world have left to scatter around the country and maybe even beyond, Jack has been lonely. This world doesn’t need him to save it, or at least not at this point in time, and he is left without purpose but with all this power he can feel within himself. A constant ebb and flow of white-hot fire that aches to break to the surface, like a volcano about to erupt. He doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone but his anger sometimes comes so close to taking over completely it’s only a matter of time until he won’t be able to reign it in.
"You never asked me where Hanna went the first time she left her vessel," the angel stated casually as they walked on through the snow, his breath coming out in puffs of white.
“You said we would talk later,” he explains, the words hushed but firm. “It's later now. And I'd like to talk.”

Things can't get worse, yet they still do. They also get a little better, though.
and has an arrangement of succulents in his room because he
Sam looks skeptical. “Dean it’s been,
Cas gave him a sideways glance, showing the hint of a smile in his eyes. "She used to say I was too forgiving of you."
“Is this the type of cabin you had in mind?” the angel asked casually after a long while of silence, completely throwing Dean off guard.
“Your angel is weak,” the spirit murmured. “You are no match for me.”
Dean blinked a couple of times, letting the words sink in. He wasn’t completely convinced but what the angel was saying was not devoid of reason. Still, they needed to be careful. Whether the sheriff was the enemy or a victim- they had to find him either way. Dean pushed out of Cas’ grasp and the angel let him go without protest.
“Is he there too?”
He doesn’t get a yes. Instead he finds himself gently being tugged closer until he’s almost on top of Cas, who has his eyes closed now, his nose touching Dean’s as they hover barely a breath apart. “I have no words that could sufficiently convey what I’m feeling right now.”
“Gosh, I’m so happy for you two!” Donna calls after them.
Dean takes a moment to look at the guy. He’s dressed weirdly formally for the dump of a bar this is, with a wrinkly trench coat thrown on over a suit. His hands are buried deep in the pockets of said coat as he waits. It’s too dark to really make out his features especially from a distance but just from the way he’s stiffly standing there, Dean is certain he’s frowning. “That’s your cool work husband?”
“They’re
“Dean!” the angel repeated, finally having his attention. “Put your ego aside for one moment and listen. “
The hunter grimaces at the response. “You know what, fuck you.”
“Doesn’t ring a bell,” Dean admitted.
“I’m sure Cas didn’t expect a grand gesture.”
As promised, the last day of the year comes with a sweet little wrap-up for this story. All in all this has been nothing but unadulterated escapism and I hope y'all found as much joy in reading it as I did in writing it.
“It’s Rowena’s things,” Sam explained just as the crystal started shaking enough for him to barely keep it in his hands.
an index. Neither are they written in any order whatsoever or in English. Especially that last part sucks majorly since Dean's knowledge of foreign languages is limited to questions like
"I don't flirt with Cas," Dean insisted, though the hurt that passed over Cas's features tied his stomach into knots because fine, maybe he did. Sometimes. A little bit.
“Interesting choice of words.” Sam folds his arms over his chest, not even trying to hide his smirk at the fact that his brother gets all flustered. There isn’t actually anything going on between Dean and Cas as far as he knows, or at least no more than the usual painfully restrained heart-eyes whenever they’re in the same room. Provided Cas actually shows his face at the bunker every once in a while. After his month-long hiatus in heaven, courtesy of a certain archangel with clear attention deficit issues, Cas could really do well in checking in with them again. Not to be too hung-up on old jealousy and ‘profound bonds’ but well, let’s just say
“Morning, sunshine,” he murmurs once they break apart. “Brought you some coffee.”
"The guy from the bookstore?" Sam excitedly confirms his suspicions. "So you got him to talk to you after all?"
"Do you think you're the only one affected by this madness?" Castiel growls, pushing him up along the shelf far enough so Dean has to stand on his tiptoes even though he's slightly taller. The mechanic swallows hard in an attempt to answer but Castiel won't let him, leaning closer so his breath ghosts over Dean's face. "I am trapped in here as much as you are, in case you haven't noticed."
the prey in this scenario.
“I’m afraid not.”
“Wait. Aren’t you gonna help?” Sam asks once his brain catches up with Gabriel’s words.
“I love you.” Cas says softly.
of you all damn summer. Part of me’s even questioning if you’re really you right now, since apparently I can’t tell the fucking difference.”
“Come on, Cas,” Gabriel prompts. “You heard the prince. Until you guys figure out how to keep his powers in check I’d do what he says.”
To his surprise the woman throws back her head and laughs heartily. “Oh wow, you win that one, Sam.”
… " Her hand wanders from the bar up Dean's chest before fisting in the material of his tee so she can pull herself closer to whisper in his ear. "I'll make you forget him. He doesn't know what he's missing."
like that.
It is.
No wonder the nest had been so well fed, if people around here were this trusting of strangers. The girl leans against the counter next to him, close enough for him to catch a whiff of her perfume and a good look at her cleavage. She looks even younger up close, half his age. Her long dark curls spill over her shoulders as she orders a round of tequila shots. One more than there’s people in the group of pool players.
It’s a few days later when the rare but warmly familiar sound of Dean’s laughter echoes from the direction of the TV room and Castiel finds himself helplessly drawn to it. He was on the way to the archives in order to look at some spells that might help stabilize the effects of a nephilim tantrum, yet here he is now peeking into the dimly lit room only reluctantly referred to as “Dean Cave”. His heart melts into a puddle at the scene he witnesses. Jack is sat on the floor, transfixed by the TV where a familiar Great Dane shakes comically at the prospect of something supernatural going on. Behind him, Dean is halfway reclined in one of the La-Z-Boys, bellowing with laughter at the same scene he must have seen a dozen times.
“Figured we could make some time for, uh. Affection. If that’s okay.” He buries his nose in the crook of Cas’s neck to hide his embarrassment, feeling Cas’s breath hitch as he does.
Predictably, getting Jack to let go of Cas is nothing short of impossible, and Cas being the Grade A pushover that he is of course indulges the kid with all his might. He’s carrying Jack around the bunker all afternoon, or has him comfortably seated in his lap for his dinner and while flipping through a picture book. Dean follows them around, finding excuse after excuse to be in the same room just to watch Cas. He’s gotten so much more comfortable with Jack since that first day where he was gentle but unsure. The sight of them now with Cas making funny faces while he lets Jack wrap his tie around his forehead like a bandana makes Dean’s chest full with
“We appreciate your cooperation, Sheriff Hanson,” Dean said reassuringly as he flipped through the pages on file, stopping on the map where three circles marked the dumping grounds for the bodies. They were not far from one another but not close to any trail. He tapped the map with his index finger. “We’ll have to check this place out tomorrow.”
“You want to hate him.”
Even with all this angelic power ripping through him, the last thing he thinks before it all becomes too much is a silent and entirely human complaint to the universe.
” The creature said the name like it was savoring its flavor. “Angel of the lord, man of your dreams. Quite literally, if I’m seeing correctly.”
And it's a wrap.
"Yes."
A barely-there smile tugged at the corner of Cas’s lips. “I think you vastly underestimate how much of our message history revolves around pie.”
“That’s what I though too,” Sam retorted, his words coming with more speed as he pulled up another newspaper article on the screen. “Only that two of the bodies were found. Mangled and apparently poisoned by a mysterious substance.”
Dean was aware that it was probably his turn to say something but he couldn’t without risk. Even wrapped in a blanket of calmness, he still felt the itch on his tongue. And frankly, there was a big chance it wasn’t going away this time.
For a moment, Dean just holds him closer. “Yeah, you are.”
. "Sorry, what?"
“Hm, interesting.” The angel plays along as one hand tentatively comes up to thread into Dean’s hair because
Instead of sitting down too, Sam excuses himself to buy the first round in a poorly veiled effort to appease Dean.
The mechanic frowns and leans forward in his seat. "On a scale from 1 to Palamedes- how stoned are you right now?"
Pamela takes off her sunglasses and ogles Dean shamelessly. "Oh of course, honey. But why not skip straight to the fun part?"
“Because otherwise three guys looking after a kid raises the kind of questions we don’t have answers to, genius.”
“Funnel cake’s over that way,” Dean deadpanned with a nod in the rough direction he’d come from.
Dean awakes unusually early the next morning to a quiet apartment. For a moment he is confused but after a few seconds of grogginess he remembers where he is and why and decides to get up and ready for the day while Castiel is still asleep so the other man's morning routine won't be impaired. He quietly pads to the kitchen on bare feet, initially wanting to get a drink of water from the tap but making a beeline for the fridge when he remembers his contamination theory from the previous day. While he's at it he might as well look if Castiel's fridge holds any breakfast-related items.
The weekend comes and goes without anything special happening. Well, except for the whole curse-reversing magic that allows Dean to wake up on Sunday to his phone- the one that had been stolen from him- ringing on the bedside table. Blindly he reaches for it, answering the call without checking for a caller ID first.
. As he claps his hands, he scans the performers one by one, remembering each act as he does. When he reaches the end of the lineup, his mood sours.
“What, you thought because we made our so-called ‘profound bond’ official after almost a decade I’d suddenly take
It doesn’t feel like they’re talking about the fireplace.
him. Usually, life up here means that negative emotions are more or less tuned out. You don't feel sad about the life you left behind, or pine for your loved ones. Instead there's a constant fondness, a sense of calm that keeps them in your mind but not to a point where it would cause you emotional pain. Yet whenever Cas leaves, Dean feels longing tug at his heart in a much similar way to when the angel left the bunker to go do his own reckless thing. The only difference is that now he doesn't have to fear that something will happen to him, that he'll get hurt or worse and Dean won't be there to save him. Because while everything can change on a whim up here, Cas is his constant. An unshakable anchor in the face of what could very well be an intimidating infinity of days morphing into one another. Cas comes back to him without fail and every time he does he greets Dean with a smile and a kiss that conveys,
make his body do the talking after all and this time Dean has no intention of stopping him.
Curiosity got the better of him and he headed toward it, rounding the nearest corner. He was met by a cave which marked a dead end to the tunnel they were in. Several oil lamps were hanging from hooks in the wall and a lone pick axe was lying next to a bucket filled to the brim with rocks.
In the end it’s Jack that manages the impossible and breaks through all of Dean’s barriers a moment later by holding out a crayon he must have picked up from the nearby crafting table. “Draw me a sheep!”
"You haven't lived," Dean informs him before walking over and sitting down on the chair the other man isn't standing in front of. He grabs one of the sandwich triangles off his plate and makes a show of lifting it, cheese strings stretching all the way up to his mouth, and taking a big bite while watching Castiel to make sure he's paying attention. He regrets his decision as soon as the freshly grilled food burns his tongue and fingers an instant later. "Son of a bitch," he yells, although it sounds more like '
The mechanic had a very bad feeling about what was coming. His house may be back in order but that didn't mean that the rest of the town is as well. "Sure," he says carefully. "The cracked stalker chick."
“I’ll take it as a compliment,” Cas offers, his voice far from the mockery Dean would expect.
idea how often I found myself freaking praying to you? It’s so stupid, I know it’s stupid. You’re not an angel anymore and it didn’t do jack-shit. Yet there I was, praying to the mighty Castiel, hoping you weren’t dead in a ditch somewhere.”
They are already more than halfway to the bunker when Castiel realizes he climbed into the Impala, relief and muscle memory beating common sense. It draws a laugh from him, the unexpected sound cutting harshly through the melancholy that has settled over the rumble of the car’s engine.
It only occurred to Dean much later, as he was gathering his things in a worn duffle bag that him winning the argument meant he was about to spend twenty hours in a car alone with Cas and suddenly his victory came with the bitter aftertaste of nervousness.
still on the ground where he dropped it. Dean picks it up carefully, an odd feeling of shame flickering in the depths of his stomach as he examines the dog-ears he is responsible for. Not only because he knows what Castiel would think of them- though, that's a pretty big part of the reason- but also because he really kind of likes the book and he hasn't treated it with as much care as he should have.
“What?” Dean asked, getting annoyed.
He wonders how the hell Cas manages to successfully reason with the boy, because it sure isn’t working for him when one final “
“I don’t care what you meant. What you
.” This time it was a clear plea. One that took all of Dean’s willpower not to answer.
“I love you, you idiot.”
He whirled around swiftly, but his plan never got put into action when the shine of his flashlight caught none other than Cas.
Despite Dean's best efforts over the past year Cas is still a lightweight. While Dean barely feels the buzz from his generously sized Long Island Ice Tea, Cas' Pina Colada has him swaying on his bar stool. They're sitting with their backs to the bar at the Hula Hut, watching the sunset paint the sky in a pinkish-orange hue. It's damn nice to have a quiet moment like this after a job well done. Especially after they spent all day tying up loose ends in correspondence with Kalanie who was infinitely amused by the fact that she called on the infamous Winchesters for help only for the day to be saved by a hula dancer. Dean has to agree that there’s a certain irony in that. On other good news, the disastrous outcome of the groundbreaking ceremony came with the consequence of most sponsors pulling out of the deal, leaving the project’s future uncertain. Some sources are already speaking of a possible return to the whole bird sanctuary idea now that there’s a volcano blocking feasible construction ground. Dean hopes there’s some truth in that, not lastly for the sake of the poor grieving girl that started this whole mess. Either way, it’s not his problem any more. He’s just here to enjoy the last night of his vacation.
"Not helping, Balth," Gabriel hissed before shoving the second half of the bag of sweets into his mouth. He rather reminded Castiel of a hamster. A hamster that would very soon die of diabetes. "Please, Cas! It's Anna's favorite band, she'll kill you if you don't go."
Dean laughs, empathizing with the frustration on the angel’s face. “Probably is. You sure there’s no secret Heavenly house parties going on?”
“Dude, was that really necessary?” Sam asks incredulously after watching Jack disappear into the hallway. His brother doesn’t meet his eyes and instead focuses on the empty coffee cup in front of him like it’s clearly much more interesting than this conversation could ever be.
.” The annoyance wasn’t necessarily meant for his brother but Dean didn’t quite know how to accurately describe the sensation of being repeatedly consumed by a cosmic entity in his sleep. “Anyway, it’s not important. It’s just a dream.”
Cas moved some books off his desk to make space for the tray in dean's hands but once they both held a slice, Cas motioned for them to sit on the bed. They ate in what could have been companionable silence, if it weren't for the nervous beat of Dean's pulse behind his temples. When he had wolfed down his own piece, Cas waited patiently for Dean to finish.
“Cas?”
Castiel's glare is unrivalled in its malice. "I do neither appreciate your scepticism, nor your puns regarding mythological lapidation victims," he says darkly before something sparks in his eyes that almost looks like wonder. "Although, I have to say I'm a little impressed by the reference."

“That’s very kid of you, Dean. You’re very kind.” Cas still leans heavily on Dean once he finds his way out of his chair though he’s much steadier on his feet than he was in the direct aftermath of Eileen’s tequila assault.
him, for crying out loud. Just Lucifer playing him like a damn fiddle for some laughs. And so much had happened afterwards that it had been too easy to ignore it. But now, with all this going on and Sam asking him if it could
thank you. He slaps his hand over Cas’s, pulling the emergency break on whatever he thinks he’s doing. The noise of the sudden contact is loud enough to catch Sam’s attention who gives them a confused but already cautiously displeased look.
Dean reluctantly pulls his car into the parking lot of the nondescript sports bar his brother directed him to from the passenger seat. He still isn’t sure what compelled him to agree to grab some after work drinks with Sam’s new co-worker. The guy has a weird name, is even more of a workaholic than his little brother and apparently to top it off he can read minds or whatever. Despite what his brother claims, he already has enough friends. He talks with the guys at work during breaks and has even met Benny’s wife so you could say they are somewhat close. Then there’s Charlie, who owns
Sam snickers triumphantly as he shoots a look at his brother. “A little less
Hopefully whatever Sam had dug up this time would turn out a bit more intriguing, he thought as the highway stretched on endlessly just like it always had. It was just short of six months now since they’d escaped Chuck’s stronghold. For a long time it had seemed impossible that things would ever feel normal again, yet here they were. It was still the same road they found themselves on, heading towards what may or may not be a case. Though, normal was perhaps not he most fitting term. After all, as much as they pretended, nothing was normal after losing so much. But it was ordinary. No more threats to the universe, no more omnipresent, clairvoyant and vengeful entities out to destroy everything in their path. For decades, all that had taken up their dreams had been some goddamn downtime. Now, peace had never felt more restless, though judging by Sam’s even breaths coming from the passenger seat there was a big chance Dean was alone with this unease. He couldn’t remember the last time he slept through the night without a good old-fashioned nightcap. On the upside, it meant he had gotten so used to the exhaustion that he got them where they needed to be in record time. It felt like they had barely left Kansas when he realized they were already halfway across South Dakota. With the realization came a sudden bout of energy; if he’d made it this far he might as well push on. If that mantra extended beyond simple driving fatigue it remained his sweet little secret as the Impala sped through the night.
“Cas is right,” Sam said, heaving a heavy sigh and running a hand through his hair.
“No.” He shakes his head a bit too vehemently to be casual, the thought of having to leave the others to drive the distance by himself oddly unbearable. “We’re almost home.”
“Counterproductive, my ass. You know the damn rules, either you stick with us or you pick up your damn phone.”
“S’alright,” Dean grunts, setting the kid down on the mattress and rubbing at the sore spot. While he just earlier remembered being too young for child-rearing, he suddenly feels incredibly old. “How ‘bout we go make some breakfast?”
“Please, I’m pretty sure I’ve had Sammy hooked on
“It’s the truth,” Sam continues calmly, his nervousness only betrayed by the way his eyes dart between the girl and the crowd of people that’s uncomfortably close by.
"That's her over there," he tells Castiel quietly, nodding at the girl leaning against the wall of the very bar he first met her in. Her posture is relaxed but her expression gives away her annoyance at apparently being trapped on the spot she's occupying. Dean doesn't know why he is surprised to see the same girl he met, except that she changed her hair-colour from red to blond. Some part of him apparently held onto the image of an angry old woman in the context of '
It took a seemingly infinite amount of time to get from his initial involuntary starting point to the front barrier where the most enthusiastic fan base seemed to have gathered. There was sufficient amount of space dividing the masses from the band on stage and Castiel fervently hoped that the excited crowd that was currently in charge of his wellbeing wouldn't just throw him down onto the uninviting concrete ground.
“Look,” Sam said. He was using his diplomatic voice. “I don’t know what’s going on between you two, and I don’t think I even want to know. But if we’re gonna do something about Chuck you gotta get the hell over yourselves. Both of you.”
He flinched slightly, praying he hadn’t overdone it.
has been dumped on him which isn’t surprising as he is the one who actually

Charlie raises her eyebrows, though she doesn’t seem offended. “Judgy. I’ll have you know that’s a lovingly curated playlist, but I guess the
Shit, Dean was drunker than he thought because before he even registered what he was doing he was taking a step toward Cas, curling a hand around the angel's loose tie, and pulling him in, in,
“Still want to drive?” Cas asked, casually shifting his weight in the car seat as he turned his head away from Dean.
For a moment Castiel just stands there and looks at Dean as if to see whether or not he is being serious. "Obviously you're upset. Maybe we should sit down and you can elaborate on the shit that is supposedly messed up, as you phrased it."
Dean signed ‘thank you’ at her, making sure to send her the most sarcastic look he could muster. The bitch faces were still more Sam’s forte. He then got up, surprised that it was less painful than anticipated, and made his way to the door. “I’ll let Sam fill you in on all the great research that lead nowhere you missed out on.” He squeezed her shoulder as he walked past her. “Glad you’re feeling better.”
He just grabs one of each and places them on a small plate just as the water is ready to be poured. Dean literally has no idea which of the teas is considered most appropriate for breakfast use, so he decides to prepare the instant coffee for himself before worrying about it. After all Castiel isn't even up yet.
"Like losing a rabbit's foot?"
He’d expected to feel relief, maybe laugh at himself for allowing paranoia to take over. Instead he felt a wave of nausea wash over him when he caught sight of the angry red line wrapping around his throat. He instinctively recoiled from it, one hand coming up to touch the irritated skin. Frantically he tried to remember if he’d done anything the previous day that would have left an imprint like this but as much as he tried his mind came up blank. The alternative, namely that somehow the trauma from his dream had decided to physically manifest itself, was not something he was happy to consider. It would be pretty low on his list of
Dean had no comeback to that.
"Why would you be pissed at me, man? I ain't the one sneakin' around behind your back."
God, how often had he heard the jerk say his name. But never like that. And Jesus fucking Christ on a magic bicycle, he'd never known he needed to hear it whispered like that but he did.
Naturally it’s not a sustainable way to handle this little hiccup in their routine that has previously been working just fine and when Cas disappears for two nights to follow up on some Heaven business with Gabriel Dean finds himself irrationally afraid that he won’t come back, proving that all he’s doing is sabotaging a good thing. He actually
if he wants his brother to cooperate.
Cas does chuckle then. “Well, I have never had a soul of my own, but Jack has managed to give me an approximation of one in order for me to stay here. Let’s call it human with certain privileges. I have taken on a mediating roll between Jack and the remaining angels. After all, he does stem from Lucifer’s bloodline. Some take issue with that.”
The angel shrugged. “It’s an acquired taste.”
Eventually the conversation turns to something less keen on targeting the water works when Sam asks about the Roadhouse crew and Dean happily relays the story of when Cas got into a drunken fist fight with Ash over who could recite more decimals of Pi.
«If that’s the way you feel, why’d you come back?»
goodness intravenously, Cas would be the first to volunteer. Plus, now that he has discovered sleeping for pleasure it’s almost impossible to rouse him without the help of his morning coffee. At least if Dean wants to keep his methods rated PG.
It’s time for Jack’s afternoon snack so he gets to work on cutting some fruit into small pieces. Bananas and pears are his favorite, because they’re sweet. Tangerines generally end up tossed at the ceiling, so he stopped trying to get the kid to eat those even if they’re a great source of vitamin C. Grapes are hit or miss, usually, but he feels lucky today and adds some to the plate, plopping one or two into his mouth in the process. He carries the plate back to the war room where he has to bite his tongue not to comment on the absolute mess he finds there.
Cas stared blankly at him for a moment before shaking his head. “Dean, I have no idea what you’re saying.”
“Shuddup,” Dean mumbles as he searchingly pats his pockets, probably thinking about the lonesome but well-loved copy of Slaughterhouse-Five resting on said shelf. Castiel hands him Charles Harrington’s credit card and they exchange a benevolent smirk.
“Me too,” Cas agreed. “Though I am curious, how did you know it wasn’t me?”
The drive back to their motel is awkward beyond measure, with Sam almost audibly grinding his teeth not to say anything while Dean stares blankly out the window. The
“Good morning.” Cas’s initial smile faltered in favor of a slight frown as his gaze fell onto the items in Dean’s hands. “Oh, I was wondering where I’d put those. Bree gave them to me at the market yesterday. She said if I’m going to have my first harvest this year, I’ll have to start stocking up on those.”
Enraged, Dean emptied his magazine, watching bullet after bullet pierce through the creature while trying hard not to think about how it still looked like Cas. Once he was met by the dull clicking sound of an empty clip, he hauled his gun at the creature’s head for good measure. Not-Cas avoided it easily before charging at him, grabbing a hold of both Dean’s wrists with inhuman strength.
“We haven’t killed each other yet. Cas got in a good punch though,” he said truthfully.
and ended up winning, which meant his photo was published on that stupid fraternity website and even though Ash the IT guy had done his best to delete it again the next morning it had been up long enough for God knows how many people to download it.
Dean chuckled at the message. Would have been good to know that from the start. He quickly typed up a reply, assuring his brother that both him and Cas were alive and the case was closed.
"Come on, kiddo," Gabriel yelled into his ear over the music. "Turn that frown upside down!" Had he kept it at the familiar request Castiel might have been inclined to offer an insincere half-smile but of course the shorter man wasn't done. He grabbed Castiel's cheeks and pushed them up into a grimace that was supposed to imitate but didn't even come near an actual smile. Castiel pushed him off, his frown deepening. He loved his brother but he was still a major pain in the neck.
In short, Castiel had no idea how he'd been talked into this mess.
One morning he was in the bunker kitchen, absentmindedly rubbing at the soreness in his back while waiting for the kettle to boil, when Cas walked in. Usually they managed fairly well to navigate their daily lives around each other. Dean liked coffee in the morning, Cas in the afternoon. Dean brought Sam his lunch, Cas his dinner. If Dean was in the war room, Cas was looking through the archives. And so on and so forth. There was no open hostility between them, though Cas usually made it a point to only interact with Dean when directly spoken to. Or to insult him, as it turned out.
Castiel seems to agree because when he suddenly appears, as he always fucking does, his eyes widen enough to be considered hilarious and Dean is tempted to laugh, he really is, but just as he wants to open his mouth the wood beneath his feet gives way and the mechanic gracelessly falls down together with the rotten steps. As his body collides with the hardwood floor the breath gets knocked out of him and for a long moment he's incapable of doing anything but stare at the ceiling and the dancing spots before his eyes. A moment later even that view is blocked out when a familiar handsome face appears in his line of sight.
Not that he had much time for that anyway because their main focus now was the heartbroken nephilim on self-imposed hunger strike in his room. Punishing himself. Dean remembered the way Sam had acted after getting his soul back, or how he himself had come down from the Mark of Cain like from a bad trip. There was no pain like being confronted with your own damn failures coming crashing down all at once. From experience Dean knew the phase of extreme self-punishment was going to blow over soon enough, even if the guilt wouldn’t go away. Cas on the other hand was getting increasingly antsy with worry. He barely left the vicinity of the kid’s room unless he absolutely had to join the Winchesters for some strategic planning. Most other times he was wandering up and down the hallway, asking Jack in sporadic intervals about his well-being. Dean was getting nervous just by witnessing the anxiety radiating off the angel. It got so bad that he was just about to send Cas out on a made-up errand to force the guy on a break when Cas came to him instead.
“Talk to me,” Dean finally broke the silence.
"Are you Dean Winchester?"
Across the street, a man pushes little carts filled with books outside, placing them on either side of the entrance to his store where they'll be easily accessible and catch the eye of passers-by. His expression is earnest, as if the work requires utmost precision. It's the first time Dean notices the guy, which is odd seeing as he frequents the café across from his store several times a week, but he's never actually lost a thought to the little establishment. Now that he has the time he takes a bite off his bagel, washes it down with a sip of coffee, and leans back, reading the sign above the store's entrance.
Sam’s mouth twitches into a smile no matter how annoyed he wants to be. “Jerk.”
Jack’s face lights up like a damn Christmas tree. “Cas said you’ll make pancakes.”
“You’re all making this extremely difficult. Do you think I enjoy being away? After finally getting Jack out of that horrid place, you think it was easy to leave him behind now?” The angel makes a tormented sound somewhere in his throat. “And Dean, he-- during our calls he said it was fine. That he understood.”
“I look forward to seeing you around,” Castiel says sincerely, though when he leans in closer to Dean’s ear his voice drops to an enticing rumble. “And I’ll think about it.”
“I’ll make sure to catch him before he leaves.”
“We can work the case, Dean. You don’t have to worry about my attitude, or about what lies in the past. It cannot be changed at this point.”
The angel moved out of the way but stopped Dean by grabbing a hold of his upper arm before he could even open the cabinet below the sink. "It's alright, Dean. I can take out the trash if you want to rest. I don't require sleep."
Much later that night, when they're both swaying with the constant perfectly balanced buzz of just too much booze, Dean surprises himself by bringing up the day Cas saved him. Next to him, Cas goes still but his shoulders stay relaxed like it doesn’t surprise him that they can’t stay away from the topic.
Inside the shop is a lot roomier than it seems from the outside which makes the fact that every single wall is plastered with bookshelves even more impressive. Additionally there's a couple of rows of solid wooden shelves put up to fill most of the room itself, the only exception being an area in the far left corner where two brown leather couches stand closely together. Dean won't admit it but he loves it. It's cozy and quiet, a tranquil oasis in the middle of the busiest street in town.
“You look like shit,” he assessed flatly once he dropped his bag by the table and scratched Miracle, who had come to meet him, behind the ears.

The fifth time, it almost went all kinds of wrong.
Castiel hopes he looks adequately tortured as he nods his thanks. Back at the bunker Dean practically forced him out of the topmost layers of his usual attire, leaving him somewhat exposed in just his shirt and slacks because a) he ‘
Bobby arrives with his wife Karen at the same time as Rufus and Aretha, which really can’t be a coincidence, yet they grumpily ignore each other until all parties got a beer in their hands.

Cas’s responding laugh tells him he happily accepts the trials and tribulations of dog ownership.
“He clearly doesn’t want to talk about it,” Sam said, “but he’s not in the best shape. Don’t be too hard on him.”
“So like angelic stand-by mode?”
"The fuck are you saying?"
. Dean shakes his head disbelievingly because that right there is Richard Roman. Well, at least he's known to have done some jail time for embezzlement so the bribing should work. As he pulls out his wallet and looks through the bills in there he thinks that he maybe should have accepted that raise Bobby offered. For now he'll have to see how far his buddy Ulysses S. Grant will get him.
Okay, so Castiel's not here. That's cool.
published in the late 1800s. It's worth approximately $650."
The credit card cooperates without issue. Dean signs with what he hopes is the name that matches the card and remembers at the last moment to double the tip. When he hands the receipt back to the barkeeper, he notices that the chair next to his is already vacant.
He didn’t get a chance to check whatever taunt she’d sent his way because the next moment he was flung against the bakery's dessert display and his lights went out.
"It's a challenge," Sam explains as if the situation is clear. "You did your flirty-thing out of habit, the guy ignored you, and now instead of moving on like anyone else would do you're suddenly desperate to get his attention."
And he hangs up.
!” Bill scolds half-heartedly, earning himself an exaggerated eye-roll from his daughter and a snowball to the chest from his wife.
And with that he’s out the door, leaving Dean to wonder what offer he’s talking about because his brain is still not fully back online and Jack lands a swift kick to his gut before it can provide an answer.
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about,” Dean said honestly, though it did come out sounding somewhat defensive.
“I thought you were dead, y’know,” he confesses quietly. “None of your numbers were working. If it wasn’t for Jody keepin’ us in the loop whenever you dropped by… It was like you were dead.”
"Do I look like cattle to you?" Castiel prompts. "Besides. This is my home."
He finds his brother hanging from Eileen’s shoulders with a goofy grin on his face.
The other Cas glared at him.
“It’s all I have. Would you prefer I walk around shirtless instead?” There’s a challenge in the angel’s eyes Dean clearly isn’t quite prepared for five fucking minutes after waking up, because his first instinct is to say he
“Understatement.” She chewed on her bottom lip before meeting Dean’s eyes pleadingly. “Please, I can’t have my parents continue to control my life. I love them but I cannot stand to be around them. This is my only chance to be… happy.”
“You are the last person who would want to hear about it, Dean.”
Castiel looks like he is about to say something but Dean cuts him off before the first syllable can escape his lips. "Wait! We ain't letting the bitch go before this hellish freak-show goes back to normal."
Sam didn’t miss a beat. “Aren’t you a little old
“Hey there, sunshine,” he greeted jovially, making quick work of the cuffs.
Benny. Benny and Dean. That rang a bell. "Dean," Castiel repeated, eyes still mostly shut.
“Gesundheit indeed!” Cas repeated way too enthusiastically. “The Bergmönch- or mountain monk if you will- is a spirit from Germanic folklore.”
Dean stares at the small display for a long moment before heaving a sigh and flipping the device shut, holding it out to its original owner whose eyes don't leave him as he accepts the item. He sniffs, rubs his nose and clears his throat while searching for what to say exactly. Ultimately, he decides that Castiel already thinks that he's full of shit so he might as well get it over with.
“Bitch.”

"Yeah. Her. She just posted a new album on Facebook with pictures of like two hundred people in bright pink t-shirts. Everyone's sharing it like crazy."
So, apparently Cas was back. After months of not calling or texting-
“Well, we couldn’t leave him at the
He almost changes his mind when their visit ends soon after with Miss Kingston telling them she would be delighted for Jack to be part of her little angels, which makes Castiel choke on air before he realizes that they have not accidentally blown their cover. Instead, Sam seems to find infinite humor in the fact that this particular daycare is, in fact, called

as in-”
“Sounds like it can go all kinds of wrong.”
"See? All better now," he offers, breaking the silence.
Cas laughed, though the sound resembled a sob. «You were ready to kill him.» The angel turned slightly so he cold look at the hunter. «He was like a son to me, Dean!»
“Fine,” Dean gives in. “Alright. But then why the radio silence, huh? Why fall off the face of the earth?”
Anyway.
The girl held up a phone, waving it for emphasis. It had a cracked screen, but she still typed a message on it and hit send. A moment later Dean felt his own phone vibrate against his thigh.
“Blade dipped in the previous vic’s blood,” Sam explained, calling Dean’s attention to him. “It’s a siren.”
Dean raises an eye-brow at the barely hidden desire he finds in those blue eyes he’s been shamelessly gazing into all night. “I bet you do, perv,” he jokes, anticipating the responding slap to his shoulder before it comes.

s just before they fall asleep in each other's arms. In a similar train of thought he also hopes the day where he is satisfied will never come and that he’ll always end up amazed when he least expects it.
This chapter was partially written but then got completely derailed by me randomly relapsing into my obsession with The Little Prince, and honestly I'm not too mad about it.
’ but it’s the thought that counts.
“Dean.” Castiel says his name as if it’s something that matters.
Missouri Moseley, who keeps a tiny flower shop not far from the town center, could have been informed via the worldwide web. As far as she's concerned that's an international weaving club. But currently she's still making the same googly eyes at him as everyone else.
It’s starting to drizzle slightly as they stroll down the empty street, their destination unknown to Dean. The adrenaline of his outburst has washed some of the alcohol out of his system he notices as he only stumbles every other step. Each time he does their shoulders almost brush together but seem to repel one another like equally poled magnets. It’s better this way, Dean convinces himself.
«Where’s Cas?» Sam asked, without any accusation in his voice. Oblivious to the abandonment.
As much as it hurt to admit, there really wasn’t any room for arguments.
The blonde shrugs. "Sure. It was getting boring anyway. Now let. Me. Go."
“Is that what you did with Eileen?”
Cas focuses on straightening his wet clothes to avoid Dean’s eyes. “I- I got carried away. My apologies.”
No online search engines were of any help to them on the matter and Dean and Cas reluctantly decided to call it a night and hope Sam and Eileen had more luck in the Men of Letters international archives.
Dean nodded. “So have I. So has Sam. And Cas. In our line of work… things go wrong.”
"You got trampled in one of the bigger mosh pits. Took a pretty good hit to your noggin. Garth went to get some ice for your eye so the swelling ebbs off," Dean smiled. "Y'know that's not really what I meant by giving the festival another chance, right?"
“Didn’t know how much you're sleeping these days,” Dean said, almost flinching as his words broke through the silence in the room.
“The hell?” Dean exclaims loudly next to Sam, making the child whimper again. “Whose kid is that? Where the fuck is Jack?”
Of-fucking-
For some reason that makes Castiel chuckle. "While you were so very much entranced with your search," he sends a sardonic look Dean's way, "I heard quite the commotion outside and decided to investigate."
want. Dean may still struggle when he is awake, but his body betrays him mercilessly in the way he melts into Castiel’s touch when he takes up the gentle caress again.
He had half expected having to recreate the data of a
“Real cute plan,” Dean mocked. “But you’re not getting out of this alive.”
, wants...
The sheer exasperation in Dean’s voice draws a laugh from Cas. “Don’t be fooled by her appearance. She’d eat you alive.”
Dean barely manages an apologetic shrug.
Instead of relief, Cas’s features showed high alert and he shrank back from Dean’s touch. Right. Shifter case. Holding up one hand in what he hoped was a submissive gesture, he took out the knife again. Wordlessly he sliced it across his arm, drawing blood.
"Look. What I'm trying to say is you obviously care about the guy. Enough so that whatever he did hurt you. But was it really bad enough to not give him another chance?"
The door to Jack’s room stands ajar, emanating an ominous vibe. Sam positions himself on one side of it while he motions for Dean to cover him on the other. A cautious peek inside reveals nothing. The emergency lights in the hallway barely paint a streak of red until about halfway into the room that does little to illuminate anything at all. If they want to see more they’ll have to open the door further. Sam indicates as much with a jerk of his head. In response he watches as his brother’s hand tightens around his weapon before he nods in a silent ‘go ahead’.
"Sucks," Dean offered, earning himself a nod in return. "So, uh…" He pursed his lips, voice trailing off.
They end up decorating the meadow behind the cabin with fairy lights and lanterns after Eileen's wishes. There's artfully mismatched chairs around the tables that are spread all around the area so people can group together as they wish. The center of it all is a lovely arch with flowers from Cas’s garden climbing up on either side in a sort of intentional chaos of color that Cas is clearly proud of. Meanwhile, Dean sets up speakers somewhere further back so they have an improvised dance floor, because if they've got one thing out here it's freaking space. It's in all honesty looking pretty damn good and by the time Sam and Eileen come around together with Mom and Dad everyone seems to be equally in awe at what he and Cas have managed to create together. The compliments also extend to their cabin where John keeps repeating he can’t
Dean watches her skip over the odd sleeper or two as she disappears down the road before he shakes his head and turns to head home, where he intends to just get the Impala, drive somewhere far, far away and get thoroughly drunk.
It doesn’t take long until Dean’s knees buckle and his hands come up from where they have been hanging at his sides to hold onto Castiel for dear life. His waist, his shoulders, anywhere that provides some leverage. The arm across Dean’s chest is no longer trapping him against the wall but securing him, holding up as much of his weight as Castiel can manage while keeping his focus elsewhere.
"That bad?" Dean asks miserably, taking in the other man's discouraged appearance. A small puddle of rain water forms on the floor boards.
Thank you for reading!
“Can’t you mojo him to sleep or something?”
Dean hangs his head for a moment, sending a silent prayer of thanks to whichever God is listening. Then he straightens himself up and forces his legs, aching from hours of chasing paper-tumbleweeds, to stretch from his current crouch into a standing position. "What's for dinner?" he asks jokingly as he hefts up a couple of folders newly filled with notes and numbers without being prompted to do so.
“Give me a break,” he muttered into his collar. He began looking around for anything he could use to aid Cas. His gun was nowhere in sight, not that it had been particularly helpful. Neither was his backpack, which he had also lost at some point.
“Exactly. It’s the Winchester way.” Dean chuckled humorlessly. “Comes with being part of the family.”
Maybe he should pay the store across the street a visit someday to ease his boredom. And definitely because of the literature offered, not because of the guy who sells it. He looks uptight and unfriendly, Dean notices, wondering why in the hell he decided to work in an industry that required social interaction when he so obviously seems uncomfortable even from a distance. The guy's posture is stiff as he stands on the sidewalk, eying his work, but changes into something more relaxed when he runs a hand over the backs of the stacked books in the carts. Suddenly Dean understands. The guy isn't doing this for the people, he's doing it because he obviously enjoys handling the countless paperbacks and hardcovers. Dean makes a mental note to text Sam about the store, sure that someone with such a passion for books can't have passed under his brother's radar. It reminds him a bit of himself and his love for cars. He, too, could do without the nagging customers on most days. Except if they are really pretty.
