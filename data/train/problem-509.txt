"I'm sure you are overheated, you can use that to..." he was interrupted by someone rapping on the outside of the door,
The pub cleared out when the police arrived. Eventually, I was sitting in a chair by myself talking to a policeman and then handcuffed.  I had just gotten myself out of a terrible academic situation, now this. I had no one to blame but myself.
John walked back to his room and Sherlock followed right on his heels. John turned around, “Please, please don’t, no I mean it--don’t.” he practically all but whispered.
It was getting late. Back in my room, sitting on the bed. I couldn't believe my luck--I actually had Sherlock here--in my room--for the night.
“We are just so lucky--she’s very sick, but they may be able to take out the tube soon…and maybe see if she can breathe on her own…”
As soon as the lift doors closed, I pulled off the dressing gown, tossed it into my room and made for the stairway. I had already disabled the cameras down the back staircase and the ones behind the building.
Feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins, Sherlock felt calmer. He was a bit pleased that he could help John out, even if it was a very little thing like the term paper. Turning towards home, he decided that there were things he could get up to in the flat to keep busy. After walking a block, he decided maybe he’d make some new slides with a new fixative he had gotten in the mail.
The Offices of the Head of Sciences Department were warm and inviting. No one should be intimidated by the dark wood paneling and soft, posh rugs. When coming in to discuss a problem or job issue, anyone would feel welcome.
"I don't know why he says that." he looked nervous now, running his hand through his hair. "He was drinking, Sherlock. I didn't push him. He fell."
John could see swelling along his left cheekbone and the begining of a black eye that he'd surely have tomorrow.
"I just saw her, she looked to go shopping. She had a shopping bag and pocketbook with her." John said.
There was no playing with Mary, John was finding out. She had piercing blue eyes, the kind that looked right into you, stinging a little.
John clears his throat and looks down briefly, then looks directly into his eyes. He speaks gently, "Sherlock, if Jim Moriarty--if anyone--would hurt you,
"Yeah!--he left the pub with that bloke, right Mike? I heard he's a drug dealer and I heard that Sherlock Holmes had a drug problem-- last year--
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"...we'd be doing?" Sherlock added as he continued to smile and greeted the owner like they were long lost friends.
"Mollys here," he said to Mary, gesturing with this glass of cider. John watched Molly give Sherlock a big bear hug, much to Sherlock's cringing dismay. After that, she pointed a finger at him, poking him in the chest and frowning, as if scolding him. John wished he could hear what she was saying. He thought that they must know each other, judging from the easy familiarly of their exchange.
Aware now that he is lying on his back,  John opens his eyes. Back in his bed, he looks at the ceiling. He is laying in bed with no blanket on, wearing a dressing gown, t shirt and tracks pants. Sherlock is still asleep at John's side; the flat is quiet.
To be fair, I saw him first. He looked awful. I remember reading the articles about all of the injuries. There were a few choice pictures in the papers of uni kids being treated by the medics. Black eyes and lacerations, bruises and a few broken bones.
He took a step closer and I reached for him--my hands ached to touch him. I placed my hands 'round his upper arms and ran them up and down his biceps. I squeezed a little, feeling the hard muscles of his arms.
signage all over the walls. He was dreading going in to face what ever calamity his sister was involved in.
“Sherlock, I’m placing a bucket here-- on the floor near your head. If you have to vomit, please vomit in here. Can you hear me?”
He headed directly to the Farringdon tube station and hoped on a Metropolitan line train. He a pang of guilt for walking away from Mary. He hopped off the train and trotted up the steps to the street. He found 221 and knocked on the door.
Standing in the doorway of the loo, he saw Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bath, unbuttoning his shirt. John peeked in. “Oi, Sherlock?” he ventured.
A small quiet voice broke through the silence and into John's worry, "What about Father Christmas?" John turned to look at Harriet, his sister, but had no idea what to tell her.
“John, do you need help to bed?” Sherlock stood beside the sofa, having already taken his shirt off.
His mum said she wanted to take him to the local doctor because he was so quiet, it made her worry.  John talked her out of it though and tried to be more cheerful after that.
The fabric belt of Sherlock's dressing gown had loosened as they sat there. John pulled Sherlock's shirt tails out of his trousers with both hands and slipped the dressing gown and shirt off of Sherlock's shoulders.
Sherlock stood in front of John, not moving. He stared at John, his green-silver eyes were sincere and his voice was barely a whisper. "It could be for the last time, if that's what you want."
Oh, John wished he could hear what was being said! John wondered if Jim placed something in Sherlock’s pocket.
After dinner at Angelo’s and 3 glasses of wine, John felt a bit overfull. Although Sherlock ordered only a salad, he picked at the bread bowl and John’s pasta. John was surprised when Sherlock repeatedly grabbed olives off his plate, but he didn’t mind.
I caressed his cheek with my left hand, he didn't move. His eyes were open and earnest and I was panic-stricken. I quickly flash back to my relationship with Victor, which didn't prepare me at all for--
Now that morning was upon them, the children stood there looking at the figure on the sofa, horrified. Teen John shifted from foot to foot, quite uncertain of what to do next.
He was able to talk at times, but his speech was slow and slurred. "John, don't tell Mycroft, don't."
He dumps more powder onto the mirror. I'm confused. This looks more tan colored, still mostly white, though. "Something to ease your pain. Ease you down. Slowly,
He could hear Jim laughing behind him. He walked quickly, bumping directly into Irene Adler, “…..and I don’t want to talk to you, either.” Sherlock said, sidestepping her.
“Mike, did you hit the back of your head? How? But you fell forward--we all saw it.” John scowling, wondered aloud, looking back and forth to the other kid's faces.
"Well, I'm not going to argue with that--but you are impatient." With a crooked smile, John looked right in Sherlock's eyes, leaned in and kissed him on his very soft lips.
"Please sit, Sherlock. And that's why," he pushed the mirror my way again after he did another line. "you and I would make good partners."
He gently cradles Sherlock's face and kisses him gently. Sherlock turns towards him, shifting in the bed until they are chest to chest and leans in to kiss him. Sherlock reaches under the sheet and runs his hand down John's back to cup his arse. John gives a small gasp against Sherlock's lips.
John realized as he rushed out of Mary's he didn't know where he was going. He felt another ping in his pocket. He reached for his phone and read a text:
John took one last look around, not seeing anyone he knew. Groups of students were gathered in clusters of two and threes, chatting. Mostly the courtyard looked the same, John did notice some kids that stood out, lingering on the edges of the quad.  Shabbily dressed, leaning against the side of a University building, they were likely from the council housing nearby. Still, they weren’t causing any trouble.
It was Mike Stamford from school, shouting at him from the back seat of a car. The mid sized sedan pulled over to the kerb and the door opened. Mike's mum was driving and did not seem to mind the stop.
Monday was the first day of classes. I had a cast on my leg and crutches. Hobbling 'round university. I couldn't complain--everyone was helping me, Molly carried my books, Mary went to the store for me, and everyone, everywhere asked me what happened.
A beloved uni professor found dead in his office on the eve of the start of the holiday. No witnesses, office door locked. His secretary had left the office early. Looked like an obvious suicide. Found by the cleaner, who then called 999.
“Yes, I know. Sometimes you have to look harder for your present.” Sherlock says, arm around John as they both fall back to sleep on a cold London morning.
John turns toward him, “Hi.” John gestures to the phone on the wall. “….Mary—No answer. At her flat. I’ve called twice.”
And just then a huge explosion erupted from behind the building, glass and debris flying and knocking all three of the boys to the ground.
I didn't meet Sherlock's brother until the meeting. We had a phone conversation the night before and the last thing I want is to feel like his employee, but I do. Even over the phone he sounded intimidating.
Instead he makes his way into the sitting room and curls himself up on his chair. His eyes focused on both doors that lead into the flat.
John began to push back against him, meeting him thrust for thrust, leaning forward just slightly so each thrust Sherlock made brushed against his prostate, sending waves of pleasure crashing through his body.
Mycroft has spent the last few hours by Sherlock's bed, reading over his brother's chart. The file is crinkled around the edges, the marks are left from Mycroft's fingers as he clenched his fists in anger as he read over the notes left by the doctor.
“Make me feel like I am getting back to normal.” He replied. “Maybe it’s what I need, I just need to jump right back into everything…drown one thing out with another.”
“Sherlock, you aren’t bothering me.” Mycroft stated as he approached his brother, the sibling rivalry that they had going had been moved to the back burner, so to speak. Sherlock’s well-being was more important than who was right and who upset mummy less when they were growing up. “It is my job to be there for you.”
“When did you start taking cases again?” John asked and he turned around to face the doctor, his brow furrowed.
John gave him a reassuring smile as his hand lingered on his cheek for a moment before his hand slowly fell to his side. “I’ll put the kettle on.” The doctor said as he turned and made his way into the kitchen, turning the kettle on and pulling down the mugs that they may or may not use depending on how the next few moments progressed.
“What are you doing here?” he asked as his head turned slightly as he heard the chair scrap across the kitchen floor as Sherlock moved from his place. A few moments seconds later, the sound of the detective’s bedroom door closing met his ears, causing the doctor so sigh.
The carpet is rough under his skin as Moran grasps his hips and pulls them up slightly before one of his knees are between Sherlocks legs, spreading them.
He stole a glance at Mary out of the corner of his eye. She appeared to be reading the text-but John's mind was elsewhere. Mary looked over and caught him staring. He quickly turned away.
Molly gave a big sigh and stood up. "I have to go. I know I'm being stupid, John. It's silly." she smiled and shook her head. "We never even went out on a date."
“Sure.” John said, to be honest, he didn’t feel at all at ease anymore in the library and was glad for the company.
Back outside, in the snowy yard. John asked, "And what was the point of that?" But he got no answer from his small, silent companion.
John was relieved when it was time to go back. His parents offered to drive him, but he told them he’d rather take the train in.
John shook his head, “I’m not! I’m not as drunk as I think I am.” He crossed his arms in front of him and then started to look around a bit.
That....was the most annoying git you’ll ever meet. Well, that I've ever met, anyway. That….was my brother.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock opened the door to Speedy's and walked out onto the street as John looked hopelessly after him.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
And right then, at that moment a very surprised Sherlock Holmes was the happiest he’d been in all his life.
John was plastered, all the footballers were. The pub was still really crowded, few uni students sitting outside on the kerb, getting sick. Molly and her friends picked their way carefully through the pub, trying to find a place to sit when she spied john.
Somehow with him on top of me, I got hold of myself and stopped swinging. He had pinned my arms above my head and shouted my name. Who knew he was so strong? It takes alot to take me down, especially after drinking, I'm like my father like that.
"Sherlock Holmes has deigned to come out with us tonight, Irene. And he shall be rewarded. " Jim said regally, as he pulled a tiny, gold paper envelope from his front shirt pocket.
John immediately took offence where none was given. Although Mary couldn't see, he was blushing with anger and embarrassment. Did Mary think he should have known? Well, he didn't and there were no clues at all. A rave, she said. Can you have a rave indoors?  John remembers reading about them in the papers, but had never been. He always thought they were out in remote fields, or something. The room was stifling--he downed his cider in one gulp. Probably time to go.
"It's not me, Dad. I have friends--in London. Who---well, let's just say, who are incredible. Just incredible."  he tried not to smile, it certainly wasn't the time.
I stand up and walk over to Sherlock, who is standing in front of the door to my room. He has a furrowed brow, deep in thought.  I feel like I've been chasing Sherlock all evening and he's been skittish, jumping up (twice now), unable to settle.
He stopped. "Oh." he said and looked at me blankly, as if he forgot I was there. "Um, sorry." His eyes were clouded--as if he was worried.
"John, this is my brother Mycroft." Sherlock said rolling his eyes and reaching into a take away bag and removing a Chinese take away box.
They got up to the second floor to an appalling sight. One large room to the left, was full of people, but none of them appeared to be awake. They were slumped in chairs lounges and on the hard wooden floor.
"Late night?" I could see the hint of a smile on his lips. He handed me a file of old cases he'd been promising me for an age.
“She was one of them, wasn’t she?” Sherlock asked causing John to look in his direction. He was still sitting with his arms wrapped around himself like he had been when the doctor had come up the stairs, but at least now his shoulders were not as tense and he no longer looked pale and afraid. “One of Moriarty’s people.”
Jim laughed. “Nothing. I doubt John will be back, I’ll walk you home.” Jim got up, dusted himself off and he and Mary walked out the door into the cold December air.
I gave her back the menu without looking up and got up to order at the bar. When I came back to sit, it was then that I noticed
John couldn’t shake the worry that Sherlock was somehow involved in something that he shouldn’t. But John had no proof. He chided himself for worrying. He tried to convince himself that Sherlock was an adult, but of course Sherlock wasn’t an adult at all.
Sherlock cleaning the kitchen after John had gone to bed. Putting everything away. Washing the dishes, sweeping the floor, quiet, calm and contemplative.
“I am not going to let some stupid reporters drive me from my home. They’ll get tired and go on to something new, they will move on John.”
A sense of safety washed over John as he stepped inside the building, but he didn't let go of Greg's arm until he was able to grab the railing of the stairs.
The distain was still obvious in Mycroft’s face as he looked John over. The army doctor looked sincere and the more Mycroft looked him over the more he saw guilt, a deep-seated guilt, that weighted the doctor down and told Mycroft that John knew more than he original suspected.
John glanced towards the hall that lead to Sherlock’s bedroom every so often hoping to see the detective emerge from his room, even though he knew he wouldn’t. Mary lingered around the kitchen door waiting for him rather impatiently if he thought about it, but he had little to no desire to actually go with her.
Sherlock sighed as he slowly pushed himself up right, John’s hand slowly falling away from where it had been resting at the base of his skull. He could feel John’s eyes on him as he straightened himself out.
Sherlock looks so young at the moment. The hard lines of his face have vanished, replaced with sadness and vulnerability.
Greg was waiting outside the door for them and he waited until John was being wheeled out of the room to walk ahead. He would get his car and pull it around front, and once the other two men were inside he would take them home.
Despite the gruesome things he had seen working for MI6 he wasn't prepared for photos taken at his brother's flat.
"I brought the clothes you asked for Lestrade." Sherlock voiced as he moved further in to the room. His eyes never leaving John's form. The closer he got to the bed, the more apparently some of the bruising on John's pale skin was and Sherlock saw red. It was bad enough that John had been hurt, but injured enough to need hospitalization meant it was worse then what he could currently figure out.
“I hope you will, also, I plan on looking into the matter myself, since this is such a sensitive case and anyone who was aware that this was to take place will be dealt with in the appropriate manner.” The older holmes allowed the words to sink in for a moment. “Even if it means your facility has to be closed, and if it does, then I shall make sure it happens.”
Sherlock  clenches his jaw as he notes another  lingering look one of the fellow players is giving John. He tries to tell himself there is no need for such a reaction. John is a handsome man and a faithful one too, that there is no way he would replace Sherlock with one of the obviously beach goers who are openly flirting and leaving lingering touches. However Sherlock can’t stop his hands from clenching in the sand or the burning sensation that has begun in the pit of his stomach.
Greg hung up before He had a chance to speak. Sherlock laid there for a moment, his brain processing that the inspector had just said. John had been hurt. He didn't even notice that the doctor didn't arrive home last night. He had figured John snuck in early, after he had gone to bed.
"John is going to take the only thing you have to give." There was an evil grin on his face as Moriarty rocked on the balls on his feet. It took a moment before the meaning clicked in Sherlock's head, and he resumed to pull on the ropes in an attempt to free himself. John couldn't blame his friends Struggle, this was a horrible way for someone to lose their virginity.
“I went because I wanted something that resembled normal... I just want things to go back to how they were John.” He mumbled again as John’s hands gently grabbed his arms.
John found himself standing in front of the hospital double doors. He was weary of entering after his last encounter there with Mycroft. At first, he thought it would be best just to stay away, but he couldn’t. He was supposed to be Sherlock’s friend, though after all that he had some, he certainly didn’t feel like it anymore and obviously the least he could do was stop by to see him.
“You Alright there?” John asked and he nodded slowly as he got his breathing under control as he slowly loosened his white knuckle grip on the edge of the sink.
“Turn around and brace yourself against the counter, Captain.” Sherlock orders and John complies. Sherlock sticks his hands into the pockets of the pajama bottoms and feels around for the small bottle that is most likely going to be there. With a pleased sound, he withdrawals the bottle of lube from one of the pockets and places it on the counter for later use.
“Of course it matters! Sherlock this isn’t a game, none of this is a game!” John exclaimed and Sherlock shied away slightly, turning more into the window. His eyes scanning the mass of people for no one in particular.
The officer sighed as he hung up his phone, running a hand over his face. quickly he poured coffee into a to go cup and headed out to the garage with the intent to clear off the walk way, he’d give out citations if need be, he knew Sherlock already felt like an outcast and he would be damned in the treated him like one.
His stomach rolls as the material falls to the ground covered with blood and semen. He'll burn them the first chance he gets. But at the moment he wants to shower. He wants to remove the evidence of his violation from his body. Maybe when he does, he won't feel so used and dirty
“I will.” He affirmed as he looked up at the man holding his door open. “I will Greg.” There was a small smile in return before the older man stepped back and shut the door. Sherlock sighed as the car began to move and he leaned against the window watching London pass him by as he counted the minutes until he was back at his flat, even if there was going to be no one there waiting for him.
"The last time I saw Sherlock was at a crime scene.... I had called him to come to look at a body in the alley and he took one look at it before he bolted." there was a dawning realization that came across Greg's face as his stomach turned. "I- Oh God...he must have been....something about the body must have reminded him..."
John's brow knitted together as he made his way towards the door and pushed it open. He froze at the sight.
Mycroft focused at the task at hand, taking care to upload the shot to the database before clicking where he wanted it ran againt.
Mycroft had always had his hands full when it came to dealing with this little brother. Sherlock was always a little rambunctious and hardly ever listened. When he was small, he would rush about the house wearing a pirate hat with the dog in tow looking for some secret treasure and during those times he refused to answer to anything other than “Captain Billy.” Of course his energy level mellowed out a bit when he began school, and at first Mycroft thought the slow change in his brother’s behavior was due to the fact he was disappointed that he had to be in a room learning for so many hours a day. Though later he would ask himself why he had been so blind to the fact Sherlock’s behavior wasn’t due to the fact he was confined in such a small space, but more to the fact he was being bullied by his peers.
The sound of the stairs creaking startles Sherlock awake from the sleep he didn't even remember falling into.
He sits quietly for a while, his laptop forgotten on his lap as he notices the little movements Sherlock makes, the tells that give him away from the dressing gown that is pulled tight around his frame to the wiggling that makes it seem he is unable to get comfortable.
"He has just been moved out of recovery to his room, I can take one of you, if you wish to see him."
The tumblers clicked softly as John turned the key, unlocking the door before pushing it open slowly and silently. The flat was dark as he shoved the boxes he had brought with him inside the room, his hand feeling around the wall for the light switch. Soft white light filled the space, illuminating the few belongings he had to pack and take back to Baker Street. He was moving out of the building, out of this section of London and back to the one he had left, to the one that felt like home, because well that was what baker street was. Home. His Landlord knew of his departure and he had already filled the change of address with the post office, the only thing he needed to do now was pack up.
“That’s what John’s Fiancée said. That is why I didn’t call him to come back, he can’t put things on hold because of me. Had he said anything I would have made sure to stop being such a bother, Greg could have stayed instead. I don’t think he would mind it.”
“I wish I could.” Sherlock’s hands curled into fists grasping the fabric of John’s dressing down “I wish I could delete it, and this new mess, delete the scars and the pain.”
The towel isn't enough to cover him. He feels exposed as he slowly makes him way to the glass door that separates the bathroom and his bedroom.
Just outside his office, he could hear the squad room alive with activity, out there was a room of people who hated the younger detective for whatever the reason, most of them hated him because he pointed out the flaws and short comings in life, their secrets, then there were those that just hated him because he was different, and they now had everything they ever needed to get back at him for everything he had done to them. And he knew that they were going to use it to their advantage, but that was if Sherlock ever decided to come out of his flat again and if he didn’t Greg couldn’t blame him, how could he? Not after everything he had been through and he knew that whoever had done this was going to pay, and by the time they got through the line, they would be begging Mycroft for such an easy out.
"I know things haven't been the same since...since a we were taken, but I think we need to fix that." he breathes
“No, It wasn’t. Moriarty sent Moran in me to have his way with Sherlock. He didn’t let us go until Moran had his chance to violate him.”
“Why can’t I delete it?” he asked finally, god he wanted to know why he couldn’t get rid of the memory as much as he tried.
Moran pulled him but his feet towards the middle of the sitting room and made an effort to turn him on his stomach as he did so.
“Oh” He mumbled the coldness slowly growing inside him. Of course, it had to be too good to be true, he having John to himself, he having anyone to himself for that matter. Like Moran had said everyone had moved on with their lives. They didn’t need him, he was just a hindrance to their new lives.
Sherlock presses a few kisses to the space between John’s shoulder blades as his fingers hook under the waistband of his pajama bottoms and pants, pulling them over the swell of his arse before letting them fall into a pool of fabric around his ankles.
“A minor detail I seemed to have overlooked.” Mycroft announced as he got close enough, Mary’s body jumped slightly as she turned around, her hand finally slipping away from the brass knob to fall at her side as she looked down at him.
Sherlock took a moment to survey the room. It was plain and white, done in standard hospital style: white walls, pale tiled floor, Venetian blinds to keep out the light, there was no privacy curtain meaning it was a private room, most likely requested by his brother.  But it still didn't tell him why Mycroft was there or how he was where he was.
The hospital room is silent as Mycroft leans into the chair and closes his eyes. He’s been staring on and off at his mobile since he called Anthea hours before, hoping to find a message or an incoming call, only to find nothing. He knew he was being impatient but this had gone on too long and Sherlock had suffered too much without him knowing and he was determined to do something about it now.
“G-go ahead.” Sherlock breathed, his breath hitching as John sunk in deeper, the pain and discomfort travelling up his spine making him feel as if he was being split in half. He closed his eyes, hands curling into fists as he tried to tell himself this was fine, this was alright. But he was wrong, it wasn’t fine, it wasn’t alright. It was wrong and it was painful.
"He's- well, He's alive and given his injures I say it is better than expected." there was a grim note tl Mycroft's voice as he spoke. "Whomever did this didn't want or expect him to survive."
Sherlock jumps slightly at the hand that grabs him gently just above his elbow and he turns to see Mycroft giving him a questionable look before realizing he had spaced out and was about to step off the curb into traffic.
Greg waited until John had climbed half of the stair case before he turned to Sherlock who had been standing by the coat rack near the entrance.
His heart begins to pound painfully as he pushes himself up into a sitting position just in time to see Moran ascending the stairs.
“You seem to be enjoying this.” Moran replied, one of his hands releasing his hips in order to drag a finger along the underside of Sherlock's erection. The detective gasped out as the calloused hand wrapped around his cock and began to move in time with Moran's thrusts.
Sherlock had kept his legs as still and as stiff as he possibly could as Moran had discarded his trousers. His heart was beating quickly, pounding against his chest so hard and fast it almost hurt. He was dreading what was coming next as he felt hands grip his ankles in an attempt to spread his legs. He willed them not to move, not to budge even an inch to where the sniper could worm his way in between them.
John stood there for a moment, transfixed to the ground as he watched Sherlock. In a heart beat he grasped the lapels of Sherlock’s coat pulling him closer until their lips met.
“I wouldn’t put it that way, you are more likely giving him an experience to remember.” The criminal voiced, loud enough for John to hear but not loud enough for Sherlock to pick up on the conversation
Sherlock’s hand were shaking as he threw books across the room, tears streaming down his face as he tried to determine what he had done for that image to be out there for the world to see, what had he done for the world to know he had come back on his terms. The room behind him was a mess, things scattered everywhere.
“Why do they keep taking things from me John?” Sherlock whispered, his warm breath ghosting across John’s neck as Sherlock tilted his head up slightly, eyes rimmed red, voice low and crackling. “Why do they keep taking things from me?”
Gregory Lestrade is seated at his desk, his gaze is down cast at the photos he has borrowed from another division. The pictures are familiar and of a place he has seen and been numerous times. Though Sherlock's flat looks different here.
“You alright there?” the doctor asked and the detective nodded not looking up completely from his hands.
"John called me." Mycroft began after he cleared his throat. He leaned forward and placed his elbows on his knees as he placed his clasped hands on the bed. " He said you had been taken to the hospital. I came as soon as I could."
With a sigh, John closes the lid to his laptop and shoves it unceremoniously between the cushion and the air of his chair before standing. He cleared the distance between the chair and the couch in a few steps and decided that the best way to approach this was just to be blunt.
The detective nodded as he slowly stood from his chair, his long and lank form unfolding as he stretched, his arms now just wrapped loosely around himself, more for reassurance than anything else.
"I need you to have a few of our trusted people track him through the video that was recovered. Find out where he went after he left."
He fumbled with it until he could hear  distinct ringing, and after a few presses of his finger he managed to turn on the speaker. He just hoped that he had called someone who could help.
"Yeah I'll come and Get you mate." Greg had answers after sitting in silence for a moment. He had taken no time to stand from the table, throwing a few bills on its surface to cover the tab before heading out into the cool London air.
He was trying to tell himself that there was no reason for him to be that unsettled, plenty of people had slipped through the cracks when it came to raids on criminal rings and operations. That was how, years after being dismantled, they would resurface with the same principle and a different face at the reigns. Of course he had never considered that the person who had slipped through the cracks had been sitting on his couch a few days ago. Sherlock sighed as he rested his face in his hands as he elbows rested on his knees. His heart was racing, pounding against his chest as he tried not to think about the events he had witnessed from his window. He had heard the voices from down stairs, John and Mary’s arguing. John protecting him against Mary who seemed so set on hurting him, as if he had not been hurt enough. His limbs were trembling at the thought he was so close to being at someone elses mercy again, and the thoughts that were running through his mind were far from pleasant.
"But I didn't call you to give you an update on Sherlock." Mycroft's tone had changed, he had slipped back into his usual demeanor. "I need to know about the last time you saw Sherlock, I want to know if there was anything different about him. I need to know about any contact you may have had with him over the last few months."
Sherlock silently begged for his torment to come to an end as he hid his face in his arm as Moran's thrust grew frantic and rapid and with one final thrust, He came deep inside the younger man. Drawing a scream from his already hoarse throat. Moran stayed buried inside his victim for a few moments before withdrawing from sherlock's body with a sickening sound, his legs slipping from his shoulders as he slid off the bed and tugged up his jeans. His eyes dancing over his handy work, taking in the man's debauched look and he knew then he wanted Sherlock again.
No, he couldn't be dead Sherlock decided as something warm grasped his hand, another hand. The light burned his eyes as he opened them, causing Sherlock to groan out in discomfort as he shut them with again. Something shuffled to his right as someone stood, and the sound of the lights switching off met his ears. Whomever it was returned and the warmth that had been grasping his hand returned.
“Sherlock?”John asked, his voice coming out low as he stepped into the enclosed space. He noted the way Sherlock’s head turn towards his voice slightly.
John’s eyes flick upward to gauge Sherlock’s reaction, but his pale face is unreadable. Instead he is intently focused on the task at hand. there is a rip of paper and the stench of iodine fills his nostrils as Sherlock cleans the wound.
“You need to loosen your grip, if not you’re going to have a hell of a time moving them later.” John stated as Sherlock looked at him from the corner of his eye, saying nothing as he slowly released the death drip he had on his dressing gown.
It didn't seem to make sense, if Sherlock had been assaulted before this, why had no one contacted him?
Sherlock’s eyes glanced between Moran and John just beyond the door  as he began to more forward, one foot in front of the other at a faster more determined pace. The detective held his head a littler higher as he moved passed Moran, who offered him a menacing smile followed by the words “I’ll see you soon Holmes.” Moran’s voice was low and made chills run down Sherlock’s spine making him uneasy. There was some foreboding behind the words, but the detective refused to acknowlege the older man, refusing to give him any more satisfaction than what he has already gained from his pain and humility. Instead he continued to hold his expressionless mask into place until he was securely over the threshold.
John turned and looked at Sherlock, nodding slightly, surprised at the fact Sherlock had reached out to the press. Perhaps this was something that Sherlock wanted to do sooner rather than later, or perhaps Mycroft had something to do with it. Whichever it was, John didn’t know and didn’t want to get into.
“Maybe I miss you, you know.” He added quietly as he looked back towards the road and began to move.
John didn't trust his legs so much, they felt funny and he held on to Greg's arm as they made their way towards the flat.
“That’s never stopped you before.” The warm breath against his skin was enough to make John shiver. The response drew a chuckle from Sherlock that he felt before he heard and John knew he no longer stood a chance. Sherlock knew him inside and out, he knew how to make him, the army doctor come undone.
Mycroft left John standing in the shadows as he approached the table that Mary had been placed at, her features were school as she sat with her hands clasped in front of her, her eyes searching for a way to escape or any type of weapon she could possibly use since her bag had been confiscated by his driver.
“I think its around here.” John stated as he pulled a slip of paper from his pocket. “Its where they sent us for that ‘case’”
The cashier didn’t say anything to them as they bought what they had come out for, well rather Mycroft paid for it as Sherlock stood a bit behind him as not to be noticed.
“You?! I trusted you to look after him.” Mycroft hissed as he took a step closer to John, who took a step back.
A whimper escapes Sherlock as Moran pulls out of him and he can do nothing but lay there as the sniper rights himself.
The rest of the boxes contents where the most troublesome in Mycroft’s mind as he finished empting out the contents out onto his desk. It was all information on his little brother, mostly from the last two years, thought there were some papers in the mix from the last few months.
Greg appeared tired, his suit wrinkled most likely because it was now two days old and at some point he had slept in it. He hadn't gone home then. Instead he had stayed with John. Meaning he had an idea what happened and whatever that was, Greg thought it was important that he stayed.
Sherlock pushed himself to his feet, his hands releasing the fists full of sand he took with him as he marches toward the small group who are just lightly passing the ball to one another. No one seems to notice him approaching with quick strides, but he does note how John turns his head so the person only kisses his cheek.
Sherlock finds himself before the window he used to compose in front of. His eyes are down cast on the street as he watches John slip into the cab, leaving him alone for another evening.
Sherlock flopped down on his bed, closing his eyes as he breathed in the scent of his duvet, He didn’t want to leave London, he didn’t want to give the people the idea that the media had driven him away, he didn’t want Moran’s people, if any were still alive, the satisfaction of knowing he had left London, they would think that he left because he was haunted by the thought of the sniper, not that they were wrong, but he didn’t want to prove them right.
He flips over the photo to look at the next one -Sherlock's pajama bottoms crumpled on the floor near the coffee table- when his phone rings. It's a text message and he flips it open to find it is from Mycroft.
“But that isn’t right Sherlock you should know that… Why don’t I stay? I am sure Mycroft has other things he has to attend to, elections and such.”
John took his eyes away from her for a moment, sweeping them over the street before glancing at his watch, he could feel Mary scrutinizing him as she came up with a way to defend her actions, thought it wasn’t like he actually wanted to hear about this, now he was just waiting for the familiar sleek black Mercedes to pull up silently besides them. He had contacted Mycroft on his way back to Baker Street, it was quick, formal, though the one thing John just had to say to get the older man’s attention was there was a high possibility his little brother was in danger, though why he had not appeared before John was somewhat a mystery, but then again half of what he did usually was.
John wishes there was some way he could perhaps ease the sadness that has overtaken Sherlock, though he only knows one way to comfort people and he isn’t certain that Sherlock is up for physical contact as a way of comfort. Though there is only way to find out.
He had tried to look after him as much as his schedule would allow, but like most things, the tables turned and the relationship he had with Sherlock became strained. He had never intentionally meant for the nature of their relationship to change, it just happened, quite literally overnight. Mycroft had just begun his internship and that day he had not heard his mobile go off and it wasn’t until he had gotten home that night that he realized this error. There had been a fight of sorts, more like a gang up with Sherlock at the receiving end of the blows. It was there that everything was left in shambles, a hurt and distraught Sherlock yelling at him through his tears that he didn’t need Mycroft to protect and look after him anymore, not after this let down. But it wasn’t like Mycroft actually listened.
The detective turned his attention to Mycroft, worry etched onto his brother’s face before the realization washed over his features. The government official managed to free his hand from the death grip that was on his hand and, like before, grasped Sherlock above the elbow gently, turning so his brother could see him.
John could feel the tension slowly ease from Sherlock’s body as he breathed deep and let John’s words sink in.
“No!” The answer came not from John, but from Sherlock, the younger man's eyes were wide with panic as blood seeped through John’s fingers. The last thing he wanted was John to get hurt because of him.
It had been the last thing he had expected that Morning as he tried to sort out some of the foreign affairs he had put aside, and for a moment Mycroft was rather tempted to allow his phone to sit on his desk and vibrate away, however, he did take a moment to glance at the screen to see John’s name lighting up his screen. That alone made him pick it up and glance over the message he had been sent. He had known there was a chance of Sherlock being a target and injured once more, that had been at the back of his mind since his team had found the file that currently sat at the end of desk, and the fact John was telling him Sherlock was in harm’s way was more than enough to get him to act.
"He should be ready to go in a few hours. Just waiting for the doctor to come in and sign off on his discharge orders and get his prescriptions ready." the woman explains softly as to not wake the soldier in the bed. The woman have Greg a soft pat on the arm before she left to finish her rounds.
Mycroft waited until Sherlock had laid back against the pillows and closed his eyes before he retrieved his mobile and sent a message to Anthea
The army doctor looked towards the door as he heard the stairs creek under the weight of someone walking up them, and he slowly stood as the door opened. Sherlock paused in the door way as he say that there was someone else there, but by the looks of it, he couldn’t exactly make who it was out.
However, in the back of his mind, there was a voice, muttering this was Sherlock's doing. That what had happened was far from John"s doing
Talking to the media was never really one of Sherlock’s strong points, he despised giving interviews and having photos taken to be splashed all over the pages of the press. It wasn’t like John could blame him either.
The light is bright as they step out into the London air, the sound of life fills Sherlock’s ears and he feels off from the start, but he doesn’t say anything as Mycroft shuts the door behind them. His heart is pounding in his chest as he takes a minute or two to get use to the loud sound of the city after being in his quiet flat for the last few days. Mycroft is at his side and he nods minutely as they take off down the street. Usually Sherlock held his head high as he walked the streets of London, making deductions of the people passing by, figuring out their motives, but not now. Now he doesn’t want to be noticed. Now being noticed will get him the attention he doesn’t want and the questions he doesn’t want to answer, not yet, not ever really if he has his way.
I'm sorry it took such a long time to get this chapter to you, I've just had some serious writers block
Sherlock shakes his head. “I haven’t been out of the flat properly in what seems like ages.” He said his hands flexing as he keeps his head down, if they stay there for much longer they will draw the unwanted attention he is trying to avoid and despite the fact he is feeling okay, he doesn’t want that. “The last time I was properly out of the flat was when I was taken.”
John nodded slowly, he wasn’t going to argue with Sherlock. Besides it sounded like a good idea, sharing a bed with Sherlock so he could be monitored.
Greg groaned and he scrubbed his hands over his face before leaving them there for a moment, before leaned back in his chair, his arms falling on to his lap. “Right, right, either way Mycroft is going to flay me alive regardless.” He muttered as he stood “Grab your coat, you can go, but you are going to ride in the squad car, no exceptions.” Sherlock nodded as he stood, grabbing his coat, slipping it on.
"John" he breathed and the blonde looked up at him. One side of his face scratched, most likely caused by the brick building. Blood had trickled down his face from his nose and there were tear tracks down his cheeks.
The silence of 221 as of late was always unsettling to John, it reminded him of just how alone Sherlock really was with no one there with him, though he didn’t actually think Mycroft would leave the detective to his own devices, not now at least. He knew he wasn’t supposed to be there, Mycroft had told him to go and sort out his relationship, figure out why Mary had said that, but in all honestly he didn’t want to have that conversation unless he had a backup plan. And that is why he was there, slowly taking the familiar stairs to Sherlock’s flat.
The parking garage was still rather empty by the time they pulled in and that was something that Sherlock was grateful for. It meant that he could get in and settled into his friend’s office with little to no one seeing him if he played his cards right, and that was all that mattered. Though as he opened the door and stepped out, he wasn’t entirely sure if this was such a great idea, coming to sit in a building were the majority of people hated him before, but Greg would protect him right?
There were so many questions he had, what happened? Who had done this to John? Why was Lestrade there and not him? But those questions could wait for now.
“I can’t keep doing this. I can’t. I can’t do this alone anymore.” He was upset, distraught. Everything that had occurred over the past few months had finally caught up with him. And here John was, standing in a flat he didn’t want with the wife he didn’t want either on the phone with Sherlock as he broke down.
However, John knew that Sherlock wasn’t exactly feeling the relief that he was. He sat quietly across from him, hunched over slightly with his elbows on his knees as he clenched his hands together as he tried to find the right words to tell John what was next.
The army doctor yawned as he made his way into the kitchen and switched on the kettle for morning tea before making his way towards Sherlock’s bedroom to make sure he truly was alright. The door was cracked open enough to allow him to peer in. Sherlock laid curled up on his side, facing the door, his chest slowly rising and falling as he slept what must have been the first time properly in the last few days. It felt good to know that in a few days’ time that things would somewhat resemble what they had. He would be moving back in, back upstairs to his room, and he would be able to keep an eye on Sherlock much better, make sure he slept, and ate and help him with his nightmares as much as he could.
He made sure to make noises as he approached the brunette as to not startle him, gently he laid in hand on top of Sherlock’s, giving it a light squeeze.
"I don't give a shit about any of that. You think that will scare me away? You think your smart mouth can get you out of this?” Moran asked, a sharp yet surprised edge had met his voice as he squeezed his hand a little tighter around Sherlock's mouth, his nails digging into his skin slightly. The panic that had somewhat subsided in Sherlock's stomach flared up, his heart began to pound against his rib cage as a whimper escaped his lips. His eyes were wide as he took in the malicious intent in the face looming over him, causing him to silently plead to himself that John would get up off the floor and save him.
Its his fault this happened. He had gone out for a walk. If He had been more visual He would have seen Moran. If he had been stronger he could have fought. This was no ones fault but his own
“I apologize that I did not come by sooner to see you, but as you can imagine there where some things that needed to be dealt with.”
At that moment, Sherlock was at war. With himself. Torn between his body's sensory pleasure and is mind telling him that this was unwanted and it was wrong. So this was his chance to ruin the great detective. To own him. Moran adjust himself again and thrusts his hips into the younger man's body again and again. Each thrust angled to hit his prostate. It wasn't about pleasure. It was ownership, marking the other man as his as his thrusts became relentless, brutal and punishing and Sherlock's pliant body had no choice but to take it.
The squad room went silent as they stepped out into the hall, everyone’s eyes had fallen onto Sherlock creating that tension and awkward feeling that was more hindrance than helpful. Greg grumbled as he stopped and grabbed Sherlock’s coat sleeve, pulling him to his side, becoming a barrier between the stares.
Mycroft was standing outside of a hospital room, back against the wall, head tilted slightly so the crown of it touched the white wall which he stood in front of. He was missing his suit jacket and his always present  umbrella, but Greg assumed those items where in Sherlock's room.
John nods solemnly as Mycroft takes a seat next to him. His umbrella is clutched between his hands as per usual, but his suit is far from meticulous. It is wrinkled from his day of work and the plane ride and he didn't even bother putting his tie back on after he took it off in the hotel room. But none of that matters now. What matters is Sherlock and why he is in the hospital.
He inched his way down Sherlock's legs, his fingers brushing periodically over his skin, watching as his legs twitched at the touch until he reached the bundle of cloth at his victim’s knees which served as a reminder that someone else had already taken the pale man under him. It was no matter to Sebastian as he hooked his fingers under the fabric, pulling it down the rest of the way as he went until he was able to pull them of and toss them aside in a fluid motion, leaving the detective nearly bare.
John stood rooted to the spot as Mycroft came towards him, pulling the door closed as he entered the hallway.
“I am not the enemy here, Sherlock is.” She began before he even had a chance to grab the thick file from one of his staff members that were waiting for them.
"John!" He cried as Moran got him on his back, trying to get his friend's attention. Though no response came from the heap on the floor and the detective felt a rush of horror run through his body at the fact he had to fight this man off alone. Without thinking he brought his hand through the air, his palm making contact with skin, a slap echoing through the room and then everything went silent. Moran had been taken by surprise but now Sherlock saw his hit was a major error.
Mycroft had been scanning through it, trying to decipher who this person was, because the last thing his brother needed was to deal with this. Sherlock had enough deal with, he was still healing from his rape and torture, battling monsters in his dreams, fighting to keep some aspect of his life private regardless of the people trying to profit from him. This was the least Mycroft could do, he couldn’t protect him from being taken in Serbia and he had failed to keep him safe once they were back in London, so he could at least make sure the people who had a connection with the consulting criminal were dealt with properly.
"That's great Sherlock." John said a few moments after as he worked both fingers in to the third knuckle and Sherlock just nodded and breathed through his nose as he became accustom to the feeling. Though that feeling was replaced with a burning sensation as the doctor now had the tips of three of his fingers working their way into Sherlock’s hole, the younger man groaned in discomfort. John’s free hand continued to rub circles above his tail bone, trying to get Sherlock to relax as he worked his fingers inside.
His hands curled into fists on the blanket, but before John could voice his disapproval, his attention was drawn to the doorway.
As the water began to go cold, he threw the flannel at the shower wall as a low sob escaped his throat. He had hoped the shower would make him feel clean, but it did nothing to get rid of the fact he felt dirty and tainted.
Sherlock was inside and half way up the stairs before Mycroft had closed and locked the door behind him, he was trying to breath, taking deep breaths in and out slowly as he peeled off his coat as he stepped inside his flat, sinking into his chair, resting his head in his hands as he breathed, he didn’t pay attention as Mycroft entered, he didn’t look up as Mycroft knelled in front of him.
He sinks down into the chair near his brothers bed carefully. He can't wrap his mind around the fact that the man that is lying before him is his brother and if it wasn't for the nameplate on the door and the distinct yet currently messy black curls he would think this was some sort of sick joke.
“I don’t know why Sherlock.” He said softly as he looked down. “I don’t know, and I wish I did, I wish they could see what I can.”
Mycroft stood towards the front, looking up and down the aisles for anything that may have appealed to him, though the answer to that was no. He looked up every now and again to look for his little brother before moving farther down. His eyes always finding their way to the door to see if anyone that might set Sherlock off was entering. He was doing well, even with the fact he had spaced a bit, and Mycroft had to admit he was proud at the fact Sherlock had ventured out. Thought there was always time for something to do wrong and he kept that in mind as Sherlock made his way from the back.
The world spun as he landed on his side he refused to move. He couldn't and it was then he figured he was going to die. Everything hurt and he figured that something had to have been broken or cracked or torn by the vicious kicks to his stomach chest, legs, and sides. He had no choice but to watch Moran out of the eye that had not begun to swell as He walked around him and grabbed him by his feet.
Mycroft's angry voice echoes in the empty waiting room and he is standing in front of John, leaning in close enough that the doctor has to lean back to avoid being nose to nose. Mycroft's chest is heaving and it takes everything he has not to slap the man in front of him with all of his might.
"I have a few people already on it,Mr. Holmes." Anthea stated "There has just been some difficulty following him, some of the cameras were down that night and his movements are difficult to track."
The flannel gets tossed with the clothes to be burned as he grabs a towel to wrap it around himself.
Sherlock added a second finger and John gasped in pleasure as he moved them in and out slowly until, his own cock twitching at the sounds his lover made. By the time Sherlock added the third and final finger, it was obvious John had grown impatient by the way he moved his hips to fuck himself on the other man’s fingers.
John didn't move, instead he squared his shoulders. “I'm not leaving this room without him.” he nodded his head in the direction of Sherlock, whose eyes were focused more on Moran's finger in the trigger than John.
“Sherlock leaving this mess doesn’t mean anything.” Greg rose his voice to be heard over the protests, Sherlock growing quiet at the other man’s raised voice, “Hell getting out of here may even do you some good. Because that isn’t going to stop, they aren’t going to leave you alone and when they can’t get anything out of you they’ll make it up.”
Moran watched the horror dawn on Sherlock's face as he grasped his cock, pumping it with his harsh thrusts. Sherlock's hips once again lifted up towards Moran’s and a guttural moan escaped his lips. Moran continued his ministrations, watching as Sherlock slowly came undone in his hands. It was with a well angled thrust that Sherlock's body tensed, his back arching off the bed and his muscles tightening around the cock buried in his body as his own painted his chest and belly with his own semen. Moran chuckled as Sherlock turned his head, hiding his face the best he could in his arm. Most likely. To hide his pain, horror and humiliation that were painted across his face.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock asked, his voice less hoarse as before as he settled his attention back on his brother.
John's blood ran cold and he shifted slightly as he looked down, sherlock stilling, listening to what was being said.
He doesn't make it to the bedroom door. He can hear Moran Sprint after him and he can feel floorboards vibrate as he dashes after him.
"C-Can you come get me? Please?" John asked, avoiding Greg's question on purpose. He couldn't tell him, he bring himself to say it.
"You know what to do." And he waited until she had been dragged out the door and out of sight. With a glance to his watch, Mycroft turned on his heel and headed back to his own waiting vehicle.
“You should probably go and start to pack up your belongings, yes?” Sherlock asked “Or have you changed your mind about moving in?”
Today Sherlock seems better, he's turned himself towards Mycroft and fiddles with the hem of the blanket as he listens to his brother Read Treasure Island.
Hands are roughly tugging down the his underwear and pajama pants, throwing them aside once they are off.
“God...No....please.” Sherlock begged as the man attempted to move his legs apart, however, it seemed as if his plea went unheard as Moran twisted his leg in such a way he had to give into the movement or risk injury. He was hurting and uncomfortably so without an injured limb adding to it as well. A whimper escaped his lips as Moran's body slid to fill the space on the mattress between his legs. The warmth of his body was unwanted and unwelcome and made Sherlock open his eyes and glance around the man to the door. He was hoping, praying, that John would somehow burst through the door, armed, with every intent on saving him from the pain and humiliation that was only moment away. However, as the sound of Moran's zipper being undone and the rustling of fabric, he knew John wasn't coming. Not this time.
i'm sorry this isn't progressing very far very fast and the chapters aren't that long, but I am getting stuck here and there.
From the drivers seat, Greg glanced towards the rear view mirror every few moments to check the reflection of John in the mirror.
“Good Morning” Sherlock murmured against his neck as his arms wound themselves around John’s waist, pulling him against his chest. Sherlock’s body against his back was wonderful and the heat his body put out was inviting as it seeped through his dressing gown.
I am glad that I have continued this story, but I don't like the way its turned out compared to earlier chapters and what I originally had in mind.
Sherlock seems uncomfortable by his question and he looks away for a moment as if he’s deciding to tell Mycroft something, anything, about the man who has hurt him.
Mary looked at him for a moment if she was weighting her options, and the fact there was a small crowd that began to gather was not working in their favor for any type of altercation.
John sighed in feigned annoyance as Sherlock began to leave a trail of kisses down the side of his neck.
The doctor nodded. “She was, apparently this was a rather elaborate plan, but you knew that already.” The blonde stated as he cast a glance towards Sherlock, he would know the sort of set up they would have, Moran would have no doubly rubbed it into his friends face. “But Though I take it she was the last of them, Mycroft and his people where already looking for her.”
Mycroft Just nodded in response. He wouldn't make Sherlock talk about it now, but they would have to talk about it soon. He wanted to know who hurt his brother and he was going to find them.
Sherlock’s fingers dug into the soft skin of John’s hips as he began to pound into the other man. Warmth began to pool in John’s belly as his orgasm grew closer with each thrust.
“You’re right, I don’t understand.” He replied “I don’t understand half of this, but what I do understand is that you have information about him saying he’s an easy target when alone, now that doesn’t take much to realize that there are intentions to hurt him, and that is something I won’t let you do, regardless of who you are.”
Mycroft closed his eyes as he shut the chart and placed it back on the clipboard on the edge of Sherlock's bed.
Sherlock could hear Greg huff as he turned to make his way towards the tape, ducking under it to make his way towards the body lying in the middle of the alleyway. There was no keeping his head down this time as stopped and leaned over the body, taking in the man’s appearance and gave an annoyed huff when he didn’t notice anything immediately.
The doctor entered the flat, walking past his fiancée and into the kitchen to put down the bags in his hands.
Sherlock uncurled himself from the chair and shuffled passed his brother as he removed his suit jacket and flung it on the back of the pink arm chair before following. They were quiet as they entered the bedroom, Mycroft moving to sit on the side of the bed that remained empty, his body perched on top of the covers as he pulled the pillow from against the headboard before placing it on his lap as Sherlock got under the blankets.
Sherlock’s heart began to beat faster as he turned his attention to Greg, his hands already grabbing the files to move them off his lap.
Today was one of those exceptions. Mycroft wanted to see him. He wanted to talk about Sherlock and to Greg that was important. He loved the brunette like a kid and he wanted nothing more than to be of some help to find the bastard who had hurt him in such a vicious way.
“Did you talk to John about this?” It was Mycroft. John stopped and waited for the reply, wanting to hear this before making himself known.
“I hope you don’t mind, I have some cold cases you can look through on my desk if you’d like. “The DI stated as they made their way to his office, the younger man nodded, work would be good, it would give him something else to think about, to focus on other than the fact he was in a building he hadn’t been in such a long time. But he doubted that time would have made anyone forgive him, why would they?
“You want to know?” John finally snapped, the anxious feeling in his body had been building and he couldn’t take it anymore, especially now, not that Mycroft knew he felt guilty. “You want to know what I am hiding Mycroft? Two people hurt him Mycroft, and one of them was me.”
John nodded once, half tempted to thank the other man, but he wasn’t sure it was the best idea, seeing that if Mycroft wasn’t satisfied with the information he received he would order John’s death.
“Mary?” John asked as he finally cleared the last few steps, the woman jumping up to her feet as to greet him.
Mycroft leans forward and places his hand on Sherlock's bruised on. Silently vowing he will get whoever did this to his brother. He will make them pay.
“I need you to relax Sherlock.” John said as he pushed the head of his cock against the stretched muscle, “It’ll make it easier.”
There were plenty of people on the street, but no one said much or anything to them as they made their way back to the flat, Sherlock’s hand in his brother’s as he tried to keep his head down. They were nearly home when someone knocked his shoulder and Sherlock looked up. His heart stopping as he got a quick glance of the man that had hit his shoulder. The grip on Mycroft’s hand tightened as he felt the bile begin to rise in his throat.
That explained why he had sent him off and it sent a pang through his chest, that Sherlock would rather sacrifice his emotional wellbeing to make sure John was happy. But John’s concern was Sherlock and making sure he was alright.
“And you have no idea what really happened to Sherlock, but I do. At least- “he breathed “I know who else hurt him and where you can find him.”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything for a while as he looks ahead, his hands are shaking slightly but not as badly and his chest doesn’t feel as tight though there is something he wants to say and it’s bubbling right under the surface. Mycroft needs to know why Sherlock called him instead of trying to get a hold of John even if the doctor has been the one to look after him since he moved back into his flat.
"John, John, it's alright take a deep breath." A soothing voice stated from his side. John turned and looked to find Greg sitting on the edge of the hard plastic chair still dressed in the clothes he wore last night. He must have stayed then.
No one said a word as he made his way to his office, upon returning, and it seemed as if no one had noticed that he hadn’t been gone for the better part of two hours. Though he knew that wasn’t the case. It was their jobs to keep tabs on him as much as it was his Job to keep tabs on his younger brother, though Mycroft had to admit that that aspect of his people’s job was easier than his own.
“That was the idea, get him alone, no one to defend him, by the looks of it he can’t defend himself at the moment either, it would have been easy, made it look like an accident with a the publicity he has been getting lately, he cracked under pressure from the papers, no one would know any different.” Mary stated. “And the hospital would have gotten all of the blame for releasing his information.”
He jumps slightly as John clears his throat and he turns his head to find the doctor standing besides him, a hand extended offering him a cup of steaming tea. It takes him by surprise. After the last few weeks of near silence this is thr last things he expects.
The blonde nodded slowly and attempted to take a deep breath. He felt pathetic for panicking as he calmed down. It was pathetic for someone like him to panic. He refused to meet Greg's gaze, instead choosing to look at the blanket across his lap.
"It's fine John." Sherlock breathed, his voice shaking slightly, but John accounted that to the position he was in. "Just transport."
Sherlock gasped out he felt a warm heat pulling in his belly, his mind screaming at the rest of him that this was not wanted, this response wasn’t suppose to happen, but it did nothing to stop the white liquid that spurted from his cock, painting his belly and the bed under him. The way his body tensed as he orgasmed was enough to bring John to the edge,
Despite the shower, he doesn't feel clean, he can still feel the hands on his body and there is the uncomfortable feeling of something inside him.
The flat was quiet, the silence only broken by the sound of Mycroft flipping through the paperwork he had brought with him when he came over. He had managed to shower and to dress and he felt the best he had since he had come sprinting back to the flat as if the Hound of Baskerville had come after him, though as much as he didn’t mind being hidden in his flat away from the rest of the population, there was only so much he could take before he got cabin fever or one of his moods struck, and he wasn’t that keen on going back on cocaine, not since that was the reason Moran had been able to take him from the drug den in the first place. His hands clenched behind his back as he rested his head against the window he usually stood in front of, his eyes scanning the busy street below. His stoop was free of loitering reporters and no one seemed to be able to see him. Which may have been for the best, honestly.
Greg sighed as he pulled up to the curb of 221, his eyes scanning the door as he waited for someone to emerge. He had been half asleep the night before when his mobile had gone off, starling him into alertness. The Detective inspector had been surprised to see Mycroft’s name lighting up his screen and he answered it without a second thought.
Sherlock and Greg stood outside of John's hospital room as he dressed himself with the help of one of the nurses. Sherlock found it strange that John didn't didn't just pull the curtain around his bed closed, but asked them to leave. Regardless, he found it a good moment to question the officer.
John dropped his arm and slowly backed up, giving Sherlock his space, he knew Sherlock had figured out he had been woken with the sound of him screaming, but that didn’t matter to John, all that mattered to John was his friend’s well-being.
Mycroft gave him a tight lipped smile as he squeezed his hand once more before releasing it before me leaned toward   the table besides his bed, his eyes watched as his brother poured a small measure of water into the cup provided.
John doesnt say anything and that is just as well for Mycroft. He doesn't want to have to talk to him anymore at that moment and he moves to the other side of the waiting room to wait by himself.
The dark tinted windows allowed Sherlock to see out and for no one to see in and that was a comfort, it meant he no longer had to hide the fact he was out and about in London. It had taken Mycroft’s driver approximately ten minutes to arrive after Greg had helped him to his feet and called his brother. Mycroft had asked nothing more than his location, and for that Sherlock was grateful, he had made enough of a scene as it was. Greg had waited with him, just outside the police tape, not saying anything but just giving him the silent support one would get from a parent, and in essence that what the Detective inspector was to him, even if he never voiced it. As the black Mercedes came to a halt in front of them, the silver haired man opened the door for him and he slipped in silently.
Mary wrapped her hand around John's arm and looked pleadingly into his eyes. She wanted him to say yes.
"I didn't know Mycroft had an MG. I never see it. He never brings it 'round." Sherlock mused, mostly to himself.
“Well…” John began, face hot. “It’s…um…I don’t know how…I’m, I’m not sure if Sherlock would…” John rubbed at the back of his neck, making quite a mess of himself in not explaining anything at all.
John watched his parents more than he watched his plate during dinner.   Did they suspect anything about him and Sherlock? Was Harry smirking at them? No, when she looked over at them it was with look of admiration. John relaxed a little.
Mrs. Hudson let out an exasperated sigh and whispered, "Sherlock, let him in, but I don't want any trouble."  she looked at him pointedly, "or noise."
I hand him the opener and eye the door. "Don't leave, Sherlock, not just yet. There's a back room here. I've booked--for my own particular use."
Where was this message going to go? Where would it end up? John felt he was just shouting a hopeless prayer into the void.
I had gotten so angry I felt like I lost my mind. I had weeks and months of suffering and Jim just appeared out of no where without a care in the world.
“I have no idea what you are talking about.” Sherlock stood intentionally in front of his coat, arms crossed in front of him.
"Mike, you didn't have to come, you know?"" John was squinting in the sunlight, at the numbers on the row houses, some torn off and hanging.
He wasn't finding what he was looking for. Almost giving up, he slowed down and started to pace, hoping he could think more clearly. He knew he didn't have much time. Spotting a sign that read, 'Visitor Parking' he started to walk towards it and finally spotted what he was looking for.
John felt anger course wildly though his body for a reason he could not identify.  There was nothing for it. John was here to have fun and meet up with Mary. He wasn't going to spend another minute worrying about Sherlock Holmes, a kid he barely knew. He calmed down a bit when he reminded himself that even Sherlock told him he was not responsible. But, what about the drugs? What if Sherlock was here for drugs? No that's not it, he told John as much when he explained that he wasn't using. Wait--did he say he wasn't using? John couldn't remember. A headache was forming behind his eyes when--
He ran out into the hallway and looked around. At this time, the hospital was pretty quiet, there was no one there.
"Sorry, I  don't keep track of John Watson's love life, Lestrade."  I sighed, put my coat on and handed back the file. I nodded my head towards the file. "Maybe next week."
Finally, she got the courage to get up off the sofa and walk towards the kitchen. Just then Sherlock got up, having had quite enough of flirting girls in his flat.  Sherlock said, “Pardon me, Molly,” quietly under his breath as he walked past her towards the back of the flat. Molly gave a little weak smile and her shoulders slumped. Sherlock walked briskly back to his bedroom and closed the door.
I couldn't hear the crowd at the pub screaming at me. I couldn't hear anything but a dull roar in my own head. Beating him felt great, I'm not ashamed to say it. I took all of my frustrations out on his face.
In the dim light of my room, I sat up, leaning on my hand. Sherlock's sleeping face was peaceful and calm, inches from me.
"Can you get back in, at school?" I nuzzled between his shoulder blades. I am awed of how muscular he is. I can feel a tingle between my legs, I backed up.
The boys were sitting very close on the sofa. John was holding Sherlock’s right hand in his left. John shifted his weight and turned towards Sherlock.
Sherlock stood up, wavering on his feet eyes half closed. He had gotten most of his shirt off, but the right sleeve cuff was still buttoned and the shirt, at this point, was inside out and laying half on the floor.
Lestrade drove us home. The other shocker of the evening, was Sherlock goes to the public school down the street from my university. I waited in the car, while Lestrade dropped off Sherlock and had a quick, middle-of-the-night meeting with the headmaster of his school.
At this moment there is no one John would rather have do this as he feels the tugging sensation as his skin is pulled back together. Sherlock’s hands are steady and his movements are precise and the small stitches are less likely to scar.
The curly haired man gasped as the cold air rushed against his skin as his shirt was opened unceremoniously, buttons popping off as Moran pulled the fabric apart, exposing his torso to the air. “My, my, you are a pretty little thing aren’t you?” Moran’s voice came out in an almost purr that sent an unpleasant shiver down Sherlock’s spine. The detective closed his eyes as a way to avoid seeing the hungry look the sniper was giving his pale body. He screwed them shut as tightly as he could as the body above his shifted once more, his teeth digging into his lips to prevent any sound from escaping them. As clothed hips rolled against his once more. His teeth tore away from his lips as he gasped in surprise as warm breath brushed against his neck before the warm feeling of chapped lips settled just below his jaw. The kiss was soft and chaste, though it was soon replaced with a quick nip that turned into biting and sucking that would most likely leave visible reminders if he ever got out of there.
“Moran…raping me…” Sherlock answered, his throat closing slightly as he moved slightly. It was the first time he had said the words and it didn’t sit well in his chest.
Greg didn't bother to shut off the car as he slid out of the driver's seat, sprinting across the road to the alley.
"I guess I'll see you around if you are alive in the morning." Moran chuckled as he tossed Sherlock's keys on the coffee table.
He had been hoping that Mycroft would have let John stay, even though he knew that it wasn’t a possibility, some sliver of him wanted John there and would have preferred if Mycroft disclosed everything once it was over. Though, things hardly worked in Sherlock’s favor.
Mycroft pushed himself away from the counter, closing the distance between himself and his little brother, careful as not to crowd him. His hand coming up to cup the side of his brother’s face. Sherlock looked so much younger than he actually was in that instance.
It was late as John came home. He tried to be as silent as he could as he came up the stairs. But something seemed off as he made it to the landing. The door to the flat was ajar and after being kidnapped by Moriarty, Sherlock had always ensured it was closed before he turned in for the night.
“I highly doubt that Ms. Morstan.” He replied as he dropped the thick collection of paper on the metal surface of the table, his eyes never leaving her face, though she never looked anywhere but his. “While Sherlock in his own right is a handful on his own, his criminal record contains nothing more than possession, and the only file of his that is anywhere near this one in thickness, are his hospital records, which these are not. Though I am sure this will look rather familiar to you.”
“It matters a hell of a lot!” John’s voice rose as he made his way towards the table, Mary’s attention on him as he stood just outside the full range of the overhead lamp, the soft light illuminating the doctor’s face, the anger in his eyes and that deadly smile that played on his lips when he was angry and upset at the same time. “He’s My best friend, my only friend, someone I would go to the end of the earth for, he is the person that saved me, so it matters a hell of a lot.”
Sherlock had no idea what was coming next, he had learned better than to expect anything good from the door opening, especially freedom after his last encounter, so he waited for whatever ill destined fate that was coming from the open door.
“Sherlock?” The doctor asked, his voice low but not thick with sleep as Sherlock had hoped, which meant he had woken the doctor with his nightmare and he had waited to come down stairs. Sherlock didn’t answer as he opened his eyes a fraction as he heard John come closer,
The government official looked up as he heard the mattress springs squeaking, signaling that Sherlock was awake. With a flick of his hand, the file was closed and he deposited it back on the table as he rose to his feet before making his way to the kitchen.
The detective shifted slightly as he heard John come back up the stairs, his steps slow and steady, as if he was reading the paper on his way up, thought Sherlock had no idea what could possibly interesting enough that John had to read on his way up the steps.  However, his answer came seconds later with the calling of his name.
Their breath came out in white puffs as their chests heaved. Their bodies were in such close proximity to one another John could feel the heat radiating off of Sherlock’s body, and the fact Sherlock’s gloved hand was gently grasping his arm made it that much harder to focused
The brunnete scrambles away on his hands and knees into the sitting room. He pauses in between the two chairs and pauses to peer into the kitchen to see if Moran is still there.
The warehouse looked familiar to John, though the last time he had been there it had been dark, and he had just decided to move in with Sherlock, though this time it wasn’t about the screening of people who intended to get closer to Sherlock, this was an off the beaten path for interrogation, like those that occurred in the movies Sherlock hates. Mary was the first one out of the car, followed by him and Mycroft, and if she seemed to be phased by this, she wasn’t letting it show. For the most part, nothing really showed on her face and it was more or less unsettling.
“Who told you were a bother to me?” The doctor asks but he doesn’t reply, how can he? Instead he leaned forward slightly and stared down at the patch of carpet between his feet.
"I-I don't know. I found him when I got home. He was just lying there in the middle of the room." John answers, his voice quiet. Mycroft flexes his hands around the handle of his umbrella and he frowns. He doesn't like John's answer. He turns his head slightly to fully take in John's appearance.
The doctor’s brow furrowed the moment he opened the flat door to find it completely and utterly empty. No one was sitting on the couch, no one in his chair, he had even went as far as to checking Sherlock’s bedroom, which too, was cold and empty. He told himself not to panic, that there was obviously nothing wrong and that Sherlock was safe, he had probably gone out with whoever was watching him, though that is what he hoped as he lowered himself into his chair, crossing his legs, settling in to wait.
He didn’t realize when John returned, he didn’t hear the door or the creaking step, no. But he felt him, when the doctor wrapped his arms around him telling him he needed to breathe because he was breathing too quickly.
Greg stared at his phone, waiting for Sherlock to call back, but he was thankful the younger man never did. He didn't want to explain to him what had happened, it wasn't his place to.
." Mycroft spits his name as if it is something vile in his mouth "Do you know what it means if he is in the hospital? It means he is injured. Seriously, because He wouldn't come here if he had to make the choice himself!"
Mycroft sorted the papers accordingly, those having to deal with the consulting criminal would be placed into storage with everything collected over the last two years while everything else was sent to other departments for investigating. The work was boring, and something he should have assigned someone else, most likely Anthea to do, if it had not been so important. Mary had been the last member of the web and she had been so determined to finish out her assignment so there had to be something there, something in all of the papers that would tell him what he needed to know.
Sherlock felt as if his body was being torn to shreds with each brutal thrust. Pain searing up his spine and down his legs while a body betraying moan escaped his lips as the hits to his prostate caused unwanted pleasure to course through his system. He wanted to ignore the warmth pooling in his lower stomach as he clenched his eyes shut even tighter. Tears were leaking down the sides of his face almost freely now and the humiliation that had been growing was now close to consuming him as he realized the stimulation had caused himself to grow hard. Sherlock cried out in pain and humiliation at a particularly brutal thrust.
His fingers danced across the screen before putting the mobile to his ear, listening to the phone ring before there was a groggy answer at the other end.
John sighed as he hit the end call button on his phone once more, he had been calling Sherlock on and off since he had gotten to work, but there was only so many times he could hear
Pain exploded where the boot came to contact with his cheek and Sherlock was physically tossed to the side by the blow
Mycroft had more or less turned the hard chair and the rollable table in Sherlock's hospital room into a make shift office from which he works. He doesn't want to leave Sherlock, not now not after he had been gone for so long and so much has happened to his brother.
From the front of the Cab, the driver threw glances Sherlock’s way through the rear-view mirror. He knew he was a mess. His hair was probably still mused and some of his chest could be seen as his shirt stretched around his body as he sat against the seat, undoubtedly showing off the marks Moran had left during his assault. he pulled his coat tighter around him and pressed his body closer to the door and adverted his eyes.
Sherlock turned his head, taking in Greg's posture, anger and hurt bubbling under the surface but before he could fire off at the older man, the door to John's room opened and the nurse stepped out.
It took some time to get Sherlock calm and relaxed enough that he removed his hands from his face to look at Mycroft.
"You can't always protect him, you couldn't even prevent him from being taken." She spoke as if to get a rise out of Mycroft, however the older man didn't say a word, instead he shifted his weight and squared his shoulders before repeating himself to his agent closest to him.
“They know what they are doing is wrong, they’ve been out there for ages I suppose, they want a story, to be the one who breaks it, but they don’t want the drama that comes with being arrested.” Greg stated as he looked from John to Sherlock
A sob escaped John's lip as he sat up slightly, his body slumping against Greg's, his head resting against Greg's shoulder.
It was just little over fourteen minutes when Sherlock heard the street door open before closing and locking, his body tensing as the stairs creaked under the weight of the person walking. The door to his flat was unlocked and opened quietly as Mycroft stepped in, dressed as he would for a usual day at the office. The older man didn’t say anything as he pulled off his coat and hung it behind the door, next to Sherlock’s after he closed it. Instead he placed the things he had carried up with him on the coffee table before turning his attention to his brother.
“Don’t you have something else to do? Like your jobs?” Greg asked, pulling Sherlock forward as they continued to walk, the older man not stopping to see if they had actually done what he had suggested.
Sherlock watches him out of the corner of his eye as he pretends to be indifferent to his flatmates actions
John still refused to look at Sherlock for several moments. Instead he focused on the blanket over his legs, the feeling of Greg's shirt still in his now cramped hand. He waited for the shock or disgusted gasp from Sherlock when he finally pieced it together, but it never came.
It did not go unnoticed by Mycroft that Sherlock had said two people had violated him, however given Sherlock’s reaction to Moran, he decided to save the subject for another day. Instead he focused on calming Sherlock down as he held him to his chest.
I am so sorry I have not updated this story like I did with the previous one, this one is just a bit harder and I am trying to figure out where i want it to go with out botching it up too badly
The government official makes his way down the stairs first, the detective following behind by a step, both are quiet and Mycroft can feel the tension slowly fill the air as the get closer to the street door, but he doesn’t voice anything, leaving his up to his brother because this is his healing process and he won’t intervene with what Sherlock thinks he can take.
“That’s enough play time for now, don’t you think Sebby?” Moriarty’s voice came from the room on the other side of the opened door “It’s time for your toy and his pet to go home now,  think we have had both of them long enough.”
The cab was hot and stuffy as Sherlock sat as closed to the door as he possibly could, placing as much distance between himself and John. The walk to the curb seemed to be the longest in his life as pain shot up his spine with each step he could. He could feel the pain now, as the adrenaline faded from his body, making him more aware of how sore he actually was. But that was to be expected. Moran had been less than gentle with him and it was apparent he would be feeling it for days.
John’s fiancé had showed up and voiced how much she had missed him, as if he had been gone for years, thought that wasn’t true. He honestly didn’t think it had been that long since John had seen her. Thought she did give him the impression she didn’t appreciate the fact he had been there, and she had certainly gave the impression that she felt Sherlock was trying to steal him away from her, and as much as he wanted John, that wasn’t the Case. The army doctor could do so much better than him, and it appeared that he honestly had.
Greg stood and watched to make sure that they had gone before he shoved his key into the door, turning the key and letting himself in. The Detective Inspector locked the door behind him before he made his way upstairs, his hands in his pockets as he went. John stood at the door holding it open for him.
"Miranda found footage of Sherlock leaving his flat and returning some time later, obviously limping." His assistant explained, Mycroft's heart jumped. "And after looking at the last of the footage from Baker Street, I discovered a man entering Sherlock's flat the night he was attacked. He is there for a good forty five minutes sir. I'm sending you the footage now."
“Don’t.” He stated as John reached out for him. Usually he didn’t mind, usually he was fine with John, but not now, not with the feeling of warm breath still on his skin and the pain in his hips from the man he knew was dead.
The brunette wanted nothing more than to move on with his life, to get back to the way he used to be, but he knew deep down that wasn’t possible, he just wanted to be fine, he just wanted to go back to being Sherlock Holmes without all the fuss, but that was too much to ask for
The room went silent and John squared his shoulders, “I’m done here.” He announced, “I am done with you, now if you excuse me, I have somewhere to be, and it’s as far away from here as I can get.” The doctor didn’t wait for Mycroft’s dismissal as he turned and marched towards the door, he didn’t turn at the call of his name, and he didn’t look back as he walked out of the doors and slipped into the car to be taken back to Baker Street.
Sherlock sighed as he stepped out of the car, unfolding himself while ignoring the stares he was getting from those already on the scene. They had gone quiet, but that wasn’t what Sherlock was focusing on, instead he was intent on staying somewhat in a working zone. He closed the door with a sot thud and turned to find Greg standing there, waiting for him.
