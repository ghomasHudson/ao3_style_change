Lestrade laughed. “Yeah, you know us hardboiled detectives like our gin and Rosa’s lime juice and nothing else.”
“Yeah, but—and don’t be offended, it’s just the heat—without actually touching you. Might not work.”
“You once said that art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms; well, that has never been a truer statement than tonight, Holmes. They’ve got a new fellow at the bath. A tattoo artist.” You shake your head. “A couple of sailors approached him. One knew the fellow already; the other was keen. While the second sailor spoke, the fellow sketched the most wondrous scene. Something out of a mad opium dream, but precise, detailed. A gifted artist, Holmes, no doubt about it. Technique matching imagination.”
And laughed and laughed until he wheezed. Then nearly doubled-over, he pointed to the apple, a twin of the one in my hand, which was perched on the edge of the table whereupon my experiment lay.
And damn if it didn’t take Mycroft a full sixty minutes to get the two wooden beads on the same side!
Cheers to all my gentle readers and the 200th ficlet! Your comments and encouragement have kept the bar open for a long time.
“Oh, that’s better, love,” said John. She dipped her head and touched her lips to Sherlock’s while her lower half began to rut.
In the meagre light, I saw the door, a russet brown affair with ironwork surrounded by ticking clocks and clockwork gears.
“I’m not going to kill you, Sherlock. Not tonight anyway. I’ll keep my hands at my sides if it’ll make you feel better.”
“Oh, look, he finally finished my potion! I’ve been waiting. He said the first eight were duds. I suppose this is number nine.”
The seams down the back of the stockings were very straight, and there were flecks of gold glitter embedded in the black silk that cascaded to the floor like metallic snow when Mycroft shimmy and shook. His dancing, especially in high heels, was impressive, but Lestrade’s main focus was Mycroft’s pale flesh encased in sweet, shadowy silk.
He was, naked, kneeling upon a very fine bed and gazing upon an equally fine arse while holding his hard, leaking prick in his hand.
He liked to watch her mouth, her lips, her whole expression, change as she pushed the slicked dildo inside herself.
“Well if you continue to extend membership to those who murder their tenants to collect their pensions, we shall have to,” said Sherlock.
“The wounds on the victims revealed much about the killer’s identity. First, the shape of the wounds told the angle at which they were inflicted. I concluded the murderer must have, however improbable, swooped down upon his targets from above, like an owl attacking its prey. All other possibilities were eliminated by my demonstrations, you’ll allow?”
“Thank you for sharing your mastery of disguise with me, Holmes. I don’t think even my own mother would recognise me like this.”
Watson’s astonishment, manifested so vividly in his wide eyes and slack jaw and heard so clearly in his ejaculations of wonder, is that moment of happiness for me. The face itself has changed a bit over the years, but the expression, the reaction, is immutable. He is still flabbergasted, after all these years, after all the explanations, quotidian and fantastic, and, quite frankly, I’m still amazed that he’s still amazed, that he’s still
He held Jim’s gaze for a long time. Then he closed the distance between their lips slowly, slowly, slowly.
They stood, hunched and huddled, facing each other, each with a cock not his own in his tight, slicked fist, pumping fast and furiously, as if it were a competition of speed. Which, of course, it was.
Molly took the white foamy beverage and ushered him inside. “Internet’s not working, but I can’t tell what’s wrong.”
“But it’s Stamford’s birthday! Stamford! You know, the one who introduced me to my tall, dark, and dreamy bond-mate! Honestly, I think she wants to leave, too. Her American cousins are a pack of marble-mouthed porcupines, if porcupines had horrible taste in liquor.”
Later, in the return taxi to Baker Street, they agreed by mute and mutual understanding—an understanding raised like Lazarus, rescued like an Old Master from a salt mine—that more was required.
“Well,” I said, looking down at my swaddled form, “we could retire for the evening and you could fuss about me in much the fashion of a proud rooster, or perhaps an arrogant cock?”
Mycroft gave a couple of thrust to confirm his initial assessment and then pulled out. He discarded the condom, donned a new one, then stepped to the left.
I drew him to me until his head rested on my chest, then stroked his hair. “My nerves may not be as shaken as they once were, Holmes, but I still detest rows.”
“Ah, you’re finally awake. Tea?” prompted Margaret as she shuffled into the bedroom with a steaming cup in hand.
Seb’s eyebrows rose when Holmes produced the rope and allowed the boss to tie him to one of two sets of rings, which Seb suspected were not originally intended for holding curtains.
“You will debase yourself,” said Sherlock. “Indulge my every caprice. I may shackle you to my bed or saddle you and ride you like a beast of burden. Whip you. Latch you to a stand and breed you, over and over—“
“As curious as you are and as inviting as that little bottle appears, don’t. Remember what happened to Alice. Laterz!”
Then, sometimes, John licks Sherlock’s hole open and fucks him. Then, sometimes, John slicks his own prick, slides it between Sherlock’s thighs, and comes. Then, sometimes, John turns Sherlock just enough to take Sherlock’s prick in his mouth and suck. Then, sometimes, John simply watches his lover, the most beautiful creature in the world, still and slumbering, while he, John takes himself in a slicked hand and finds his own release.
John charged the pack, bit the furry sack by the scruff of the neck and threw it on his back. Then he raced to the outermost edge of the preserve and was relieved to find the cave he desired unoccupied.
“Has my interest flagged?” retorted Sherlock, glancing down at his own cock, which was still very much erect and pink and dripping with John’s saliva. “I’m in a stately antique home, in a stately antique bed, after solving a stately, though not exactly antique, case, getting an exquisite blow job from the man I love who has also expertly tended my wounds, but, and this is no trifle, John, I also happen to be seeing a figure closely resembling a person-sized Christmas nutcracker staring at me from the side of the bed. No, don’t look, John!” Sherlock grabbed John’s head. “If you look at it, it might disappear. Didn’t the Major say this room was haunted?”
“Just restoring a bit of order,” he replied without looking up. His voice sounded strange, nervous and strained.
Sherlock took his time, making a full circle until he came to the platform at the back. He undid his belt as he climbed the time and had his trousers down when he pushed the tail aside.
“Silk,” he repeated. Then his eyes fluttered open. “Oh, can’t get distracted,” he said in a quiet sing-song voice.
John took the glasses and deposited them in the refrigerator. Then he returned and lifted the dressing gown by the hem. “Christ, you put a plug in.”
“I think I surprised you even more than I was expecting to,” said Molly with a chuckle. She got two hums in reply, one from her cunt and one from her arse.
Without meeting Mycroft’s gaze, Sherlock releases his cock and extends his hand over John’s prone body. His cupped palm is soon filled with slick.
“Very, Boss. For a single moment, I thought they were actually going to get me for one thing I didn’t do. Molly, you’re, you’re…”
“Not ostentation in any respect, and I’ve made certain that it can be worn discretely beneath the sleeve,” Holmes was saying as I studied it, “The design of the catch is my own. It has, that is to say, there is a second one, a mate, if you will, which, if you agreed, that is, I would wear whilst we’re apart.”
The Baker Street place might tempt John. Location. Nice sitting room. Kitchen. Upstairs bedroom when John wanted privacy, though he’d be more than welcome in Sherlock’s bedroom.
To say Mrs. Gilchrist was a nurse and housekeeper and companion is to say that a typhoon is a bit of wind and rain and surf. She is, in fact, a force to reckoned with. She took care of me when I turned my ankle one Christmas, and I can say I’d barely recovered from the experience when she was on my doorstep again, barking orders with all the subtlety of a left hook.
“I don’t know that I’ve—oh, yes! When I was still lodging in the Strand I heard a violin floating from somewhere one afternoon. Lovely.”
Three days later, Lestrade was so lost in his thoughts about Mycroft that he missed his own building by four streets and didn’t notice the dark car following him until Mycroft spoke his name.
Sally laughed. She put a hand under Stella’s chin, lifted her face, and kissed her lips. “Did I forget to say thank you for saving my life today?”
Was there anything more pathetic than spending Christmas Eve in a lab catching up on chemistry homework? Thank goodness the only witness to John’s shame was the bloke who was always there, gorgeous but with an intense look that said ‘don’t bother me, I’m a real scientist.’
“So are you.” John’s eyes travelled down Sherlock’s bent figure. “Speaking of which, you amenable to me fucking that lovely arse?”
Tea and a tiered tray of sandwiches and pastries arrived. After the first sips and nibbles, Marie said,
Molly rubbed the sunscreen on her own chest and shoulders and neck while Irene bit her lip and let one hand slip to her own mons. At once, her body tensed, and she came with a series of short pants.
“Sixteen,” said John. He took a deep, noisy breath. “You have been naughty, Sherlock Holmes, and for that, you’re being punished.”
John stumbled but caught himself. His lungs were on fire, and every muscle burned. Adrenaline still pushed his blood hard through the vessels of his body, and he was ready for the next attack.
Just like when she rode him. When he thrust up in her tight pussy. He tightened his grip on himself and began to stroke faster.
Their mouths just brushed, but each could taste the fruity sweetness of Seb’s maracuya mojito on the other’s lips.
John uncurled and crawled on all fours towards him. He took Sherlock’s nipple in his mouth, gently savouring it with his tongue.
Sherlock’s erection is tenting his pyjama bottoms; there’s a tiny dark stain of leaking pre-come. There’s also the sharp scent of urine. And the cool of tile and ceramic. But John’s gaze is warm on Sherlock’s crotch, and John’s voice is gravely and sleep-rough when he says,
And, in the mornings, Mycroft would wake as he always did, alone, and do what he always did, restore order to the herb garden. And what it all meant or how it would end, well, he considered, only thyme would tell.
The rich flavour was still on warm on John’s tongue but it paled in comparison to the delicious delectability of Sherlock’s wet, hot sheath, which—impossibly or perhaps only highly improbably—was drawing John’s cock deeper and deeper inside him.
Author’s Notes: I am participating in KINKTOBER 2017. One of the three possible prompts for Day 1 is Sleepy Sex.
“I’m not a professional stud, I’m just an Alpha with a few problems, as you so succinctly pointed out. And as far as talking rubbish during heat, I think that’s normal. For example, if I make a remark to the effect that I want to split you in half with my massive cock, I don’t have any desire to do that at all. All things considered, it would be messy, painful, and horribly inconvenient.”
“Not with you in my corner. I didn’t kill her sister, and I’m glad the bastard who did is going to eat his Christmas pudding in hell. Sherlock, you were magnificent, and I’m not just saying that because it was my arse on the line. Really, you outdid yourself.”
Seb’s gaze follows the nod of the head. He carefully scoops up the two white pills and washes them down with a sip from the glass.
While Sherlock nuzzled and licked at the fabric, Mycroft studied Sherlock’s near-nude form, dusted with constellations of gold. He kept his hands at his sides and watched how the gold wig jerked and bobbed with Sherlock’s frenzy movements.
He smiled and poured two glasses of an iced concoction which was the same colour as his lovely frock, a frock, I noted, of a fabric so flimsy as to lay plain the ruffled knickers beneath.
It seemed that the renewal of the earth, as evidenced by the shoots and buds and the lively birdsong on air, was accompanied by a renewal of old hostilities, namely, Watson the gardener and his nemesis, as arch a foe as ever menaced, a grey-furred, long-eared interloper who coupled a positively gluttonous penchant for Watson’s brassicas with an absolutely brazen disregard for each and every obstacle Watson put in his way. No fence could keep him out. No threat could deter him. He eluded ever trap.
Having felt I’d reassured him of my desire, I waited patiently for the revelation, confession, or whatever species of statement Holmes was anxious to make.
Mycroft took a deep breath, steeling himself for the walk back to his office, thinking the fresh air would do him good.
“Well we did eat an awful lot of it. Honestly, I think I’ve had enough gingerbread to last me until next Christmas.”
“I hope so and yes,” said Jim, running a hand down the front of his bespoke suit. “We understand you had a visit earlier that left you wholly unsatisfied. We’re here to remedy that.”
Mycroft fell to his knees. “I’m here.” He kissed Lestrade’s cheek, then cradled it in his palm. He looked up and asked coolly, “What do you want?”
You once wrote me a similar letter, and I confess I did not appreciate the agony it caused you until this very moment. You lied for your reasons, and they brought us both sorrow. I lied for my own and expect no less.
“I turned on my television this morning, and who do I see on ‘Wake up, You Poor Slobs’? The man you were supposed to put a bullet in last night, nattering amicably with chirpy Satan’s Spawn and her sidekick, Bucket of Congealed Drool.”
“All right, all right,” said Grodman, beginning to wheeze. “Constant was an experiment. I just wanted to prove I could commit the perfect crime. As I was working on my book, I got the notion, and it turned into an obsession. Mrs. Turner played her part just I’d imagined she would. When Morelake was acquitted, I thought I was free. I had no intention of committing another murder. But then Mrs. Turner came to see me, and I saw something, something in her eyes, a suspicion, a recognition. She knew! Somehow, she knew! I panicked. I just, I just…Call it off, call it off!”
Mint julep is bourbon and simple syrup over crushed ice with mint sprigs. It's the traditional cocktail served at the most popular horse-racing event in the US, the Kentucky Derby.
“I think I’ll freeze this,” said Jim, eyeing the raspberry Swiss roll with reverence, “for later. Where do you think they’re getting them?”
With a quick motion, Sherlock grabbed a single Post-it note from a pad of them on the desk, folded it, and proceeded to stick it to Lestrade’s thigh. Then he ripped it back and strode purposefully to the microscope on the kitchen table.
Sally buried her face between Janine’s legs and brought her off with lips and tongue and deft fingers. Then she wiped her face on the inside of Janine’s thigh and stood. “I’ve got another surprise,” she said. She unzipped her leather jacket.
He followed my lead in removing himself from the table. I wanted to lend him a hand, but I also wanted to marvel at the mess I’d made of him. The devil was driving now, so I stood back and watched.
Sherlock ran a hand along one side, then the other, passing in front of the muzzle. The eyes, the ears, the mane, the tail, were still but incredibly life-like. A first-rate saddle was in place.
Lestrade filled the third flute on the coffee table as John clung to her. “We’ve got an audience now, Watson. You’d better make it good,” she said, licking and biting up the side of John’s neck.
“Mister Holmes’s train has been delayed, and Doctor Watson is enjoying a good book. They shan’t disturb us.”
“Sorry I can’t offer you something more sophisticated,” said Lestrade as he handed Mycroft the mug. “Just the powdered stuff but made with milk.”
After a session, John waited for a few minutes, then, when Sherlock made a noise, he gathered Sherlock into his arms, pulled him into his lap, and held him. Sometimes he stroked Sherlock’s hair, sometimes he stroked the side of Sherlock’s face. John made noises that eventually became words, adjectives, usually, of praise. When Sherlock was able to say John’s name without stuttering or slurring, John laid Sherlock prone on the bed and rubbed his back.
The boom was followed by a crackling, and, once more, the firmament was painted in technicolour hues, in arcoiris illumination. And once more, Sherlock’s head was bathed in beatifying light.
“I found Miss Fortescue to be a charming creature, not quite of this world. I thought you were smitten with her, too.”
“Indeed.” Mycroft turned to kneel on the seat. “If not for her, I’d have no idea how enamoured I was of
A suffering bastard is usually lime juice, ginger beer, bitters and a liquor (I've seen recipes with bourbon, cognac, or brandy).
Summary: What if the client in “The Sussex Vampire” wasn’t Ferguson, but his wife (which Doyle, by the way, doesn’t even give a first name, but I always call her Soledad) and the letter wasn’t addressed to Holmes, but to ‘Three Continents’ Watson.
“Bad news.” Mycroft was looking at the set of evening dress, just returned from the cleaner’s, which was hanging on the open door of the wardrobe.
“I deduced it,” said Holmes, dismissively, “from your keen glance out the window, but, well, I shouldn’t like to lose sight of you completely, just in case the cottage holds one last unsavory surprise.”
Your mouth forms a hideous, open gash as your face contorts in agony. Even in the dim light, I can see the sprays of saliva.
By one o’clock the heat was such that my sweat-soaked shirt hung on a hook outside the garden shed. I was not expecting any visitors, and I knew Holmes, despite being equally absorbed in tending his hives, would alert me to any unexpected arrivals. If he whistled, I’d make myself presentable as quickly as possible.
“All the senior officers have to do a shift walking the beat on Guy Fawkes Night,” said Lestrade. “This is my assignment, Parliament. Ghostly place at night, when there’s no one about. All the bombers are out there; half of the merry-makers, as you call them, don’t even know what they’re celebrating. Why are you here? Not just to deliver,” he took the bag and opened it. “Corned beef! Hello! God bless, you sir! What’s in the flask?”
John still sucks Sherlock’s nipples like an Internet porn star, laving buds and skin and tiny hairs with a hungry tongue and pulling off with an obscene
“Right,” said Seb with a grin. “You are never just in the neighbourhood, boss. What’s the job? There’s no place to bury a body on a rugger field.”
In a moment, the far door opened, and something resembling a wet rat in a miniskirt and platinum wig settled against the leather interior.
“Hello, my dear,” said Mrs. Hudson. “Don’t be alarmed. The gentlemen have invited us to celebrate the conclusion of the case with them.” She held out a chair by the table. “Have a seat.”
“Hector gave me tomorrow off, too. Something about shock. He actually suggested I contact a therapist.”
I growled my approval at beauty, at nature, at glory and petted his head, no less warmly, no less affectionately than a lord might pet his prized hound, his faithful companion, home from hunt.  We were home from hunt, but, Christ, wasn’t the leash in the other hand now?
“Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone.”
Watson’s fingertips brushed the rim of the empty glass jar which sat on the table beside Holmes’s armchair. The table had always been beside Holmes’s armchair, but the jar was a novelty. At Watson’s arrival, it had been filled with shells and stones and other detritus that Holmes had collected on his walks. Each item represented a story or an anecdote, a morsel of knowledge or wisdom, or even—and here Holmes was growing positively romantic in his dotage—a line or two of poetry. When companionable silence had been exhausted and talk seemed called for, Holmes had taken a piece out, shown it to Watson, and rekindled conversation.
Sherlock's experiment makes a huge stink. Johnlock. Omorashi. Desperation only. Assisted masturbation.
Like strips of bacon in a pan, they lay. Nipples rub in whorish fashion; mouths exert free rein from clavicle to brow. Playful pups, they nip and tease until one of them laughs.
Author’s Note: References to American comedian Groucho Marx, H.P. Lovecraft (necronomicon is a Lovecraftian book of magic),
We were given our scraps of paper. Mine did not say ‘Smee.’ The lights were turned out, and I waited with the others. Then there was a bell, which indicated the hunt for Smee could begin.
“How are you, lover?” cooed Greg. Kiss. “You feel me? You feel me here? Inside this pretty baby? God, she’s so good to us.”
“It is to inspire them as to what they should produce,” Holmes explained. “Art in the vine is liable to take the most delicious forms.”
They’re each kissing a corner of his mouth, and he’s rotating his head to lick at them each in turn.
Seb spat on an already soiled flannel and proceeded to do his best mother cat impression with Jim playing disgruntled kitten.
After one dance, Molly let Irene push the strap of her tunic bodice off her shoulder, and after a few of Irene’s caresses, Molly’s breast was dribbling freely down her torso.
Mycroft fumbled with his tie, only managing to loosen it before he ceded management of his undressing. He widened his stance, the better to receive Lestrade’s dry thrusting, which did not cease with the untying and unbuttoning and untucking.
“Shite!” he hissed, smiling. He grabbed her, keeping her down while he planted his feet on the bed and thrust up, sharp and hard.
Lestrade returned to his knees and unbuckled Mycroft’s belt and slid Mycroft’s trousers down to the floor.
in gunmetal by Agent Provocateur. As always shopping for fictional characters' lingerie is my favourite kind of research.
Irene’s eyes widened. “God, yes.” She looked over at the sofa. “Let me check on those naughty girls over there and I’ll be right back.”
“I had to consider what kind of person would be able to execute such maneuvers. Secondly, the shape of the wounds suggested a certain type of blade. That narrowed the field, too.”
Molly led Irene to the bath and undressed her, the latter act taking more time than it might have, what with all the buckles and straps and tugging.
And we're at 100 chapters! So it seems like a good place to stop for the year. Thank you to everyone for making this my most popular AO3 posting. I want to wish everyone the warmest compliments of the season. Mince pies (and martinis) in all your stockings!
But then who would I be fighting? More than likely one of Moriarty’s agents, fighting with the knowledge that my efforts were akin to ripping out only the green, topside bits of the weed, leaving the root behind to regenerate elsewhere.
On one end of Sherlock, John spent himself, and on the other, Lestrade kissed Sherlock’s mouth and fed him Mycroft’s come.
But he always forgot. He didn’t even know if it was the same cock from winter to spring to summer to autumn.
She gestured to a makeshift stool beside an equally makeshift table. Light danced in her grey eyes, and I was reminded of the soft, rippling fur of a well-stroked feline.
“Greg? Where’s the body from the theatre? No, it’s not here. It never arrived. I know it’s a long time ago. Right.”
“I’m afraid you’ll have to win the costume contest or the pumpkin carving contest or the longest-held erection…”
The label on the top was addressed to Sherlock, and the lettering on the side John could see gave a description of the contents.
Mycroft welcomed the mundane task. It would keep his mind off what he did not want to be thinking of, namely, one Detective Inspector who he’d been forced by circumstance to look at quite often in the past three hours, a ridiculously handsome Detective Inspector with a travesty of a tie and a crooked Windsor knot that Mycroft could not, at any point in the meeting, reach across and straighten.
“It okay, gorgeous actually. It’s just, uh, much, much warmer than usual. What’s going on, Sherlock? Is it the alcohol? We’ve drank before during heat.”
Mycroft drew the gold wig off as Sherlock sucked his prick. He tossed the wig to the other side of the car, then reached under Sherlock and ripped the stars off, too.
Holmes gave a grudging nod. “But before I woke, did I or did I not, speak the resolution of the Merridew case, he of, quite literally, abominable memory?”
As Sherlock righted himself, he wriggled out of his trousers and pants. He curled himself on one side of Mycroft’s lap and tucked his head into the curve of Mycroft’s neck.
At few moments later, with a much-abused mouth, he kissed her neck and shoulders, kissed along her jawline, kissed up and over her chin, kissed the corners of her mouth, kissed her eyelids when they closed.
Mycroft could only nod. He tried to reshape his face back into its polite, professional, aloof mask, but a question plagued him.
Lestrade kissed and nuzzled at Mycroft’s neck. Mycroft loosened his tie and unfastened the top two buttons of his shirt.
More than the brush of skin against skin. Or the weight of body upon body. Or the burn of breach and occupation.
Now was the moment, the one that Mycroft had been thinking of for a long time. His haste as he approached the hospital lift was both genuine and feigned.
“Yes, but I am thinking of the restorative property, not the didactic one. I enjoy listening to music. When the performance is truly first-class, I can close my eyes and, for a time, be transported to a peaceful, halcyon place.”
Mycroft and Lestrade are unlikely to forget the 5th of November. First time. Implied public oral sex. Sex on the job (Lestrade).
John looked down and gasped, discovering the source of the infernal pinching and its cousin, the itching, which had set in now that John was half-awake: an unmistakable dried mess decorated his stomach.
It was a change, I’ll admit, to witness the great detective Sherlock Holmes doing something as prosaic as tromping through a pumpkin patch in search of the perfect specimen.
“She strangled her sister-in-law and then moulded a mask round her face and arranged her in the Peter, Peter tableau.”
At an impatient whine, John rolled away for lube, and when he rolled back, his prick landed right into a waiting palm.
Lestrade’s condition was one of utter bliss, then he opened his eyes and looked straight at John’s massive, erect, leaking cock. He licked his lips.
There was the Detective Inspector, in the doorway, looking at Mycroft via the reflection of the teapot, and there, in the umbrella stand, beside Mycroft’s own umbrella, Rocinante, was the crazy yellow one.
Jim slid one hand up, under Molly’s jumper, and the other down, beneath her trousers and knickers. With one hand, he deftly unhooked her bra and rubbed her back while his other hand kneaded her arse.
“Mycroft was just about to ply me with his fancy bourbon, but there’s a snag. Seems you’ve got the key to our naughty evening and we’ve got the key to yours,” said Lestrade, laughing uproariously.
Sally shifted her attention to the other nipple. “And are sometimes infuriating. We work odd hours.”
“That was a wager about a football match and it was Cinco de Mayo! Today I am the laughingstock of half the bloody free world!”
“Goodness, Holmes. Should early English charters and detective work both fail you, you might find yourself in high demand as a Turkish bath masseur.”
John turned a third time and leaned against the sink and opened his legs. Sherlock’s breath tickled his quivering hole when he said,
“And I was enjoying it, too. That’s why I was foolish enough to be caught unawares by one of Scotland Yard’s finest.”
And the scent. Not lavender or the usual perfumes, which sickened Moriarty with their sweet, cloying vulgarity. No, the fragrance had also been acquired abroad. It teased. It tempted. Like a far-off dream. Like poetry. And numbers.
Oh, well, thought Mycroft. The hour chimed the arrival of his Latin tutor, and he drowned himself in his studies.
John knows that Sherlock could look at him and, with a few clicks of that supercomputer brain, discover exactly what he, John, has been up to the past hour. John can’t see any clues on himself, but he knows Sherlock can, could, if he looked.
“I will, Sherlock. I will come to bed and rub ointment into your skin and open you up with my slicked fingers and fuck you into the mattresses, fuck you until the only thing you know is my name and my cock. I will fuck you until dawn.”
Kate’s cloud got sweeter. She heard her own moaning, soft and urgent, and she felt her body pitch awkwardly in Irene’s lap.
“I could not agree more. You also stated that your experience in these matters extended over many nations and three separate continents.”
“I’m going to fuck you right here,” said Sherlock, shoving John against the closed rear passenger door. He began to probe John’s hole with a slicked finger. “No time to be careful.”
And so the next time I found myself near the church at Embley-on-Wold, I placed a posey of autumn crocus on the grave of Maldahyde Simple, and I think, if village gossip has any truth at all, the Miller’s pond revenant has not been seen since.
“Yeah. We were just kids. Exchange to America. I’m not even Irish, but I had to get away from my Pop. You presented. I presented. You got those two kids to take our place on that field trip and got us a hotel room.”
The boss enjoyed getting his cock sucked, well and good, and when he was on the very edge, he was offered a nice tight arse for finishing.  Now the boss was reciprocating, on his knees, taking Holmes’s cock, but in the same manner, he pulled away before the very end.
“I don’t think so. I made a casual comment about Sherlock’s sudden spike in libido. Do you know what he blamed it on?”
“The Singing Scheherazade, the lady who trills a thousand and one tales,” continued Holmes undeterred.
“What’s that?” asks Seb. He’s in the bed of one of his three bolt holes, the one he calls ‘Hospital.’
“I wanted some privacy. And to afford him the opportunity for him to bespoil me of my virtue as he had Lord St. Simon of his treasure.”
“All done? Storm’s not letting up, so, you can stay the night, but in the morning, you’d best be off. Come, I’ll make a nice bed for you."
Molly straddled Irene, then began to rubbed the sunscreen into Irene’s breasts with firm, kneading strokes.
The praise heaped on the meal, chicken and field mushroom pie and gooseberry fool, was legion and not hyperbole in Mrs. Hudson’s opinion. Conversation flowed, and it seemed that on a long train journey, the gentlemen had discovered they both had at one time had an aunt in Dorset and that had led to a discussion of meals at their respective aunt’s houses and dishes they were especially fond of.
“There’s no haste, my queen.” He took one of her hands in his and pressed his lips to her pulse. “All night. Your servant.”
In a few moments, he was on his back, and she was sinking down on his prick and exhaling a long, satisfied moan.
Holmes’s eyes dance ‘cross the note-book page more than once, then darted toward me. His lower lip quivered. Then his expression changed.
Author's Note: for the LJ fffc com May Special challenge (the prompts are in bold) & the Holmes_Minor comm May prompt: flowers.
“You have no idea what it’s like, Mister Holmes!” cried the young thief. “To wear clothes that don’t seem right just because everybody says so.”
For Kinktober 2019 Day One: Masks. I did a whole long Johnlock masquerade ball fic last year, so this is all I'm going to do this year.
John took out his pocket-knife and opened the box. Then he set knife and box on the table and reached inside the box. Soon he was holding a pair of red cotton pants that said NAUGHTY in gold across the arse.
Grodman smiled as their glasses clinked. “That business of the Constant murder sent my memoir well into its next printing. I am gratified that you deigned to read it and pleased that you found it interesting.”
John bunched the fabric of the kilt in his hand as tight as possible, allowing his streaks of come to hit anything but the uniform.
“Yeah, left shoulder. Christ, what a night! You figured out that they were hiding the drugs in the games prizes.”
If this were a dream, Holmes never wished to wake. He sank to his knees by the bed and closed his eyes, offering his face for the blessing and as he felt the splashes, he heard Watson groan,
John’s face darkened. “That’s my fear, too. That one day an ex-Army doctor will be yesterday’s news.”
I was close, so close, but I wanted to find that angle, that position, that force of thrust, which would drive him from insensate to stark mad, so with every forward push, every twist, I moved us further onto the table.
! She was my best friend, and you took her from me and from this world that deserved her loveliness longer and from all of us who loved her!”
“Ah, Lestrade, you’re looking—and smelling—fresh for a man who took a dip in the drains earlier today.”
I hoped the ebony-tiled walls helped to hide the exact location of Raffles’ hand, but of course he would continue to stroke me.
The rumble grew louder. And by the time it stopped abruptly, Janine was wet. “Christ, you are an eager bitch, aren’t you?” she muttered just before opening the door.
Beautiful, yes, graceful, yes, as precise and telling as the scientific instruments they manipulated, yes, but I’d forgot how strong until that rare display of pure grip!
And, now, at this sight of his more delicate, less taut, but deliciously bronzed canvas, I find myself lulled, just like the bees, into slow movement and reverie.
Their hands were on her breasts and on her belly and everywhere. Their heads met just over the slope of her neck. She heard their wet kisses between ragged breaths.

“Definitely. Otherwise, there’ll be trouble.” Greg finished his drink. “Time to go wake up my Alpha and see if I can interest him in a bubbly soak.”
The weeks and months passed, and outwardly, Holmes put on a show for Watson’s sake as much as the rest of the world.
Lestrade rolled onto his back and faced Mycroft. “I gave it and the Swiss roll to John and Sherlock. They asked for it.”
Cold cases, experiments, even reading for idle interest had slowed until we were both caught in a miasma of lethargy and perspiration.
But Openshaw was there, in his dreams. He was reaching out, trying to grasp Holmes's hand, trying to reach him, but he always failed. And Holmes often woke in a cold, clammy sweat with his heart pounding and his stomach twisted in guilty knots.
Sherlock leaned forward and shimmied, shaking pendulous breasts that he did not possess. The strands of crystals around his neck swung back and forth, then he added his hips to make those strands of crystals move in a countermotion.
“Fuckity-fuck!” Seb muttered under his breath. Mission aborted. Seb had been assigned the role of distraction while Jim planted the evidence on Conyers, but the distractor had got distracted, and well, there you go.
John’s body atop his. John’s hands nailing his to the bed. John’s prick pounding his arsehole open. John pissing his come up deep inside Sherlock, laughing and swearing and saying,
Until finger brushed my free hand. They were also cold, but not as cold as the ones still in my grasp.
“Mm-mm-mm,” he hummed as Lestrade and John rebounded from the initial blow and obliged, kissing each other’s lips, licking each other’s faces with abandon.
He imagines Mycroft launching himself over John or scurrying around the bed, that he might hide beneath the sheet and tongue-fuck Sherlock, unseen, unheard, until he comes. Until they both come, perhaps, if Mycroft’s hand is on himself as he rims Sherlock.
She set her mug down and climbed into window seat with diary and pen. By the light of the small but gloriously festive Christmas tree with which she shared her perch and the strand of bright, large-bulbed fairy lights hanging overhead, she wrote.
Seb hopped off the table and stood behind Jim, smiling. “Think about it, Molls. Did they bring you an Iced Cascara Coconutmilk Latte?” He took the plastic cup from Jim’s hand and raised it.
Recipes differ, but a Zombie is usually dark rum, light rum, and a host of tropical fruit juices (lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, passion fruit, etc.).
Lestrade looked over his shoulder at Mycroft’s furrowed brow. “Yeah, never mind,” he said quickly. “I don’t even know if you eat. Or drink.”
Martha set her teacup in its saucer on the table. Then she hummed as she ran a hand over muscled shoulders and another hand over firm buttocks.
I haven't been doing many Cheers ficlets for Kinktober so I'm thinking maybe I'll just extend things and making it Kinktember, too! :)
“This is a Fabergé egg,” said Stella with awe, removing the egg from its nest and studying it very carefully. “It’s been declared lost. How on earth did you come by this? And how on earth am I going to explain how I came by it?”
Molly climbs on the bed, straddling Irene’s waist. “You’re mine to take care of in whatever way I see fit—until you safeword—then we cuddle! And drink! Get out of her bag, Toby, none of that for you!”
John’s hot gaze turned icy. His lips pursed. His chin jutted. His feet spun on their heels and marched upstairs.
Now Lestrade was the kind of man who laughed at his own jokes, no matter how weak, but in this instance, he didn’t realise that he
“There was a burglary at a bungalow owned by a wealthy man for the purposes of entertaining a certain lady. When a suspect was arrested, he offered the story that he was invited to the bungalow by Miss Helier to discuss a play he’d written. At the time of the alleged meeting, Miss Helier was rehearsing lines with her understudy, but the young man claims he was received at the bungalow by a parlourmaid and met someone calling herself Miss Helier. The young man had a drink, and the next thing he remembers he was stumbling out in the road, where the police caught up with him after a tip about the burglary. When confronted with the real Miss Helier, he denies it was her. The police found the bungalow had, indeed, been ransacked and jewelry taken. The wealthy man was not in residence, and the other occupant, the lady in question, who is in fact someone else’s wife, was called to London by a bogus telegram.”
When life throws a lemon (of a pandemic), a consulting criminal makes lemonade. MorMor. No smut. Rating: teen for off-page murder.
“Yeah, scoot up and bite down on footboard. Need help?” She carefully places her hands on Irene’s thighs, supporting them as Irene crawls up the bed.
A Candy Appley is XXX Salted Carmel Corn Whiskey, apple liquer, cranberry juice, sparkling cider, and coconut flakes on the rim (!).
“Naughty girls get spanked, but if they take their spanking well, Daddy will let his friends use their pretty pussy while he uses their pretty mouth. And I think my pretty sunshine needs some help being still.”
“Sexy shoes stay on. Want those pointy heels tattooing my back later. How’s this?” He spread Sherlock’s cheeks and gave his rim a cursory lick.
The word was a simple melody, one fit for humming whilst shaving, one as smooth and as thrilling as the curve of woman’s waist when she turns.
Sherlock’s voice softened. “I nibble that spot on the right side of your neck, the one that makes you sigh.”
I noted a curl of that same grey mist which had swirled before my eyes in my Kensington study and, were I not already seated, might have tottered on my feet.
“—they kept a fine garden. And I’m to understand that they maintained all of this with very little in the way of paid assistance in the form a gardener or even a lad. It’s magnificent, Holmes.”
I shook my head. “It’s just made me thoughtful.” I turned my attention back to the photograph. “You know, this man, for all his ignorance and naivete, can be photographed. I cannot.”
Sherlock always told himself to remember features of the cock so he might make certain deductions about its owner afterwards.

He unbuttoned his shirt and stepped closer to the bed. When he was within arm’s length, Sherlock grabbed for his waist, pushed up his vest and began kissing his torso.
Holmes’s features were both devilish and childlike in the glow. He continued his diatribe as he poked and stoked the panting embers.
Then he pounced on Jim, slamming his cock into Jim’s cunt over and over, without pause or gentleness.
“The tragedy of Miss Allen seems more horrid with all this gaiety about,” I said. “But I think that’s the quickest you’ve wrapped one up yet, Holmes.”
It is a deep cleanse, and I have never minded rolling up my sleeves, snapping the rubber gloves on, scrubbing.
“You are thinking of the garden,” observed Holmes as he slid behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist.
“No,” said Molly as she leaned forward and looked down at the orgy under way. Then she stood back and released her grip on the railing and unfastened the clasp at her neck which held the bodice of her dress up.
Mycroft opened the door, and light from the hallway penetrated the pitch-dark bedroom. He stopped in the threshold and announced,
The two tentacles quickly wrapped themselves round the shaft and began to ooze a slick substance through their pores.
Then he sank his cock into the hole and pulled at one tail of the red bow, undoing the knot and then spreading both ends of red satin widthwise along the bed.
The prone body on the bed was nude save for a big, bright red bow at the waist, a bow whose dangling ribbons concealed the crack of buttocks, but nothing of the plump cheeks.
Trousers fall like stage curtain. His hands are behind his back, bound by the third bootlace. He leans forward as trousers are unfastening.
“You have to admit, my dear Holmes, it would be difficult not to wax poetic on this beautiful day in this beautiful place,” I made a wide gesture which encompassed the clouds and sun and green meadow and yellow flowers and rolling hills and what remained of our picnic lunch, “and I so very happy to be with you again.”
“Grace has her own family, which demands a great deal of attention, naturally. Faith will stay for as long as she is needed, but, of course, the demands of the sickbed are not small, so, I thought…”
“Proud?” Sherlock Holmes ejaculated. “What should I be proud of? My intellectual ‘tricks’? Or,” he huffed with exasperation and waved at his body, “the rest of it?”
They resumed kissing. Molly sighed and leaned into Jim’s lips, which were worrying a tender spot on her nape, while Seb trailed tiny kisses along her jawline.
“—but there is something in what you say. The Bard wrote that ‘There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.”
“Thank you,” said Holmes. “We are quite sentimental about them.” He dropped his keys on the mantelpiece next to mine. “Shall we?”
“Work is the best antidote to, well, everything that is not work. Good-bye, Watson. Perhaps we’ll meet again.”
There were better ways to spend a night off, but Lestrade had grown tired of checking his phone for a message that never appeared.
Lestrade shot him a look, then shrugged. “Sure.” He picked up the glass closest to Mycroft, sipped, and scowled.
Sherlock squeezed his own arse, showing off long, gold, claw-like fingernails. He moved his hips in figure 8’s while he looked over his shoulder and licked his lips.
Lestrade’s face, chest, and arms were painted with swirls of bronze, black, and gold, and his wings were those of an owl butterfly, brown with eye-like spots. John’s torso was decorated in swirls of yellow, white, and black; he wore the wings of a swallowtail butterfly. Sherlock’s wings were largest, those of a blue morpho butterfly; his chest was covered in blue and silver glitter. They all wore tight dark pants beneath dark tulle drape.
“—and followed him. That was the best vantage point. These shoes are actually quite comfortable. I could climb up the tree, but getting down was trickier.”
I woke to a soft eruption of laughter emanating from the sitting room. Immediately, there was a caress of my shoulder and then the tapping on my hip resumed.
What a ridiculous thought! Almost ridiculous as chasing one’s swindling estate manager through the woods and trapping him in a very steep hole.
“Doctor Watson appeared as soon as the library opened, looking for meanings to the dying man’s final words and gestures. Liking puzzles and wanting to help, I ruminated on them after he’d left. If I’d been murdered, I’d want to communicate with my last breath something vital about the person who did it, and if I’d been strangled like Edwards, I’d have seen the forearm of the man up close. So maybe it was a birthmark or a tattoo. I remembered where I’d seen a similar symbol. I found what I sought, traditional tattoos and markings of the peoples of Madagascar. And I remembered that on the crew manifest that Doctor Watson had showed me there was a sailor named Rako, which might have been short for Rakotomalala. But I wasn’t certain, of course. And I’ve always been intrigued by the work you do…”
“No one can see anything,” Sherlock assured him. “My hands are visible to all. We’re just grinding like two costumed blokes who fornicate on a regular basis. These trousers were selected with this act in mind.”
“We have everything we need, Watson, I assure you.” Holmes produced a flask of oil from a sack hung by the door. Then he tugged both braces of my shoulders as I kissed him, then murmured against his lips,
Mycroft was in rolled shirt sleeves, moving about the kitchen slowly, but methodically. He prepped the oven and the baking sheets. He lined up the ingredients: syrup, sugar, flour, ginger. He melted and stirred and sifted and rolled the brown lumps between two hands.
A bit of poignant pillow talk. Mycroft/John/Sherlock. Spit-roasting. Anal fingering. D/s tones. Present tense. Mention of double penetration. More John-sharing than straight-up incest but YMMV.
“The Adventure of the Dancing Cyclist.” A case leads Holmes & Watson to the circus and a re-enactment of the murder has Watson pedaling and soft-shoeing across a high-wire in a clown costume.
The following morning, my friend was in a foul mood. Clearly, his assignation had not been a pleasant one. Or perhaps it hadn’t occurred? His first coherent words, after a litany of single-syllable grunts, confirmed this.
In some, ‘the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak,’ but here, by this garden wall, it is the reverse. The flesh has been subjugated quite nicely; it is the spirit that refuses to be tamed.
In fact, Jim would be scratching a specific Alpha, one Chester H. Chester, he of the highly unimaginative parents.
But the thought of John being cold is anathema to Sherlock; perceiving a single shiver running through John’s form provokes a state of profound anxiety.
Seb sighed and shook his head. “The bastard fell for it. The whole scheme. A germ-free retreat for the ultra-rich. By invitation only. He wasn’t allowed to tell anyone where he was going.”
“Yes, but I’m doubtful any genuine tartans are orange and black. And gold. With embroidered purple bats!”
“Well done.” Sherlock takes John’s hand as he stands and steps out of the trunk. He doesn’t need it, but he likes it. “I was…well…sentiment.” He casts a look of longing in the direction of the coat and the scarf.
Mycroft smiled and curled his hand and whispered, “Well, hurrah for the little green men and their flying saucers.”
All the Yarders looked from Sherlock to the voice. A few clapped while a few intervened before the hands of the lunging confessor found their way to Sherlock’s throat.
When one prick spent, she pivoted clockwise, and everyone shifted roles. They each were clever in their own ways, and Molly couldn’t help comparing.
“—so they trampled the whole bloody scene and, to top it all off, completely overlooked, and almost destroyed, the absolutely crucial, and most bleeding obvious, clue to the identity of the murderer!”
How Sherlock and John have come to enjoy this—even within Sherlock’s own thoughts, even with the vast resources of his Mind Palace, he can only bring himself to call it
“Yeah, Chief sent me home and told me not to come back until I’d washed my eau de sewer rat off. It took three showers, but I managed.”
Long Island Iced Tea is, in my humble experience, one of those drinks that goes down so smooth you really don't realize how drunk you are until it's too late. Probably because it's triple sec, rum, vodka, gin, tequila and Coke.
John deeply regretted the decision to walk home from Lestrade’s local. Too many pints, too many streets between his bladder and Baker Street. He wondered if Lestrade (or Mycroft) would be able to get him off a potential charge for public urination.
“Oh, come now. Surely you saw the string around Lestrade’s neck. He doesn’t wear jewelry of any kind, except a watch, and it wasn’t a chain or necklace but rather a length of soft leather. When he bent at the microscope, I got a flash of a very small key on that string. What does that little key open? He’s just had a quickie with my brother in glittery stockings. No time for a mutual pleasuring, not if there’s a show involved, Lestrade’s got to work to do, so does Mycroft, for that matter. Caging a cock wrapped in black silk? Off limits until the case is over and I can see to you properly?” Sherlock hummed suggestively.
“No one will disturb us, Mister Holmes, even if you put a bullet in the top of my skull on the second floor of a posh gentleman’s Turkish bath.”
Sometimes it was good to be a machine. And an Alpha with a nine-inch cock. Sherlock let his body service the Omega beneath him while his thoughts drifted.
The elements were all there, flavours, strong and subtle, forming a divinely-inspired whole, much like a stained-glass window in a centuries-old church, and the comparison was apt, for much like many ecclesiastical matters, the ritual was almost as delicious as the adornment.
“Sure.” The bedding is being adjusted and Seb’s prick is being fondled most expertly. “I’ll sleep when you’re dead.”
“Rest, Watson. Mrs. Hudson is away tonight, and I am at home to no one, no matter the crime nor the criminal.”
'My Fair Lady' karaoke night. Sherlock/John. Mycroft/Lestrade. References to sex but no actual sex. Crack. Fluff.
He applies a small amount of blacking to the brush, then rubs it on the boot. Then he switches to the polishing brush.
Mycroft mewled each time Sherlock brushed the sweet spot inside him, and Sherlock tested his brother’s limits, fingering him mercilessly and grinning wickedly at every plaintive noise.
Jim circled the sofa and sat down beside them. Molly was facing him with Seb behind her. The halter straps of her turquoise dress were unfastened and hanging down, indeed, the whole bodice was curling forward, away from her torso.
John had absolutely no doubts about the latter. He’d stake his life, his sanity, his safety, everything he had and was, on it.
“I don’t know,” he murmured. “Maybe it’s because they go so well with the Westwood.” They kissed again. “Maybe it’s because I like getting caught.”
“And, finally, the samples I collected from the wounds. The woody fibres were from flax, flax being processed for clothing. And, thus, it became a matter of finding someone who met all criteria.”
Having fed Mycroft his own come, Lestrade licked both their lips. Then he looked over Mycroft’s shoulder at the table.
“Oh, come on,” said Sherlock petulantly. “You’re not going to give me an excellent spanking and not follow it up with an equally excellent sodding. That’s not fair. That’s like having the crab rangoon without the…”
-themed cocktail with blood orange liqueur, bourbon, lemon juice, vanilla-orange simple syrup, cut plums, and mint.
“Naturally,” said Mycroft as he sank his cock into Moriarty’s hole, threw his head back and groaned,
The snow was falling heavily. No one was about. But John didn’t want to go. He wanted, he realised, to do something very different.
The base of Mycroft’s prick was like the liquor at the bottom of the glass, the spirit that provided the strongest inebriant sensation.
For my part, I was breathing and observing that inhaling and exhaling in a sickroom, even a well-ventilated sickroom, was different from, and much inferior to, filling one’s lungs with fresh air directly from the source.
Lestrade leaned over the figure, eyeing it closely, then nodded. “Cute. It’s your hobby, this Christmas village?”

“I told you,” growled Lestrade as he licked the other side of Sherlock’s neck. “I told you he’d take us both and his brother like a fucking doll. He’s magic. He’s a bloody unicorn.”
He tried, she saw him try, but he just couldn’t stifle the boyish smile which broke across his face or the laugh. “Jesus Christ,” he muttered, the Irish lilt as thick as butter.
I considered recent events in this startling new light: the time when Holmes’s experiment—gone awry—had singed my eyebrows, and he’d apologised; the time when Holmes’s case—gone awry—had sent me tumbling into the Thames, and he’d apologised; the time when I’d been in bed with an ague following my dip in the Thames and Holmes had shouted from downstairs, “For God’s sake, man, stop malingering! The game’s afoot!”
“Yes,” he cooed, looking down at Seb with adoring eyes. “Let me. Push you. To the limit. Of respiration.” He forced more of himself down Seb’s throat. “Good, Sebbie, so good.” Jim petted Seb’s head and moaned softly until Seb finally pulled off with a wet pop.
It was a mistake, for it gave Sherlock the moment’s opportunity required to seize Moriarty and shove him face-first onto the rug.
Then he noticed, once more, the tiny whiff of perfume or cosmetic or something and was drawn back into his present reality.
“Well, this is how I like you. Laid out for my pleasure, naked, nipples pinched, neck bit, balls licked, cock sucked, hole fucked and dripping. Pillaged. Plundered. Mouth open begging for more. A picnic feast. Do you surrender?”
“Aw, fuck, queenie, yeah.” Then Lestrade stepped carefully in front of Sherlock, straddling him, and fed him more.
“It was part of the estate of Major Palgrave, Colonel Hayter’s old warmate. Very well. See here, Watson. I’ve solved a very old, but very sinister case. The disappearance of no fewer than four children in Surrey countryside from 1851 to 1853 was blamed on supernatural forces, a fantastical cousin of the Dartmoor hound, but the notes in the margins of this book indicate a perhaps diabolically-inspired, but decidedly humanly-executed answer to the mystery. Thank goodness for the Crimean War and the head injury the Major suffered there or a larger number of innocents might have suffered under his macabre instruction.”
Sherlock stretched out atop his bed; after a few turns, the kitten settled in the centre of the beige wool nest beside him.
“I wished for Holmes to find me. And he did. But I also wished for her, for the girl, to be well and at peace, body and mind.”
“Some gardening things,” I said, glancing up at the overrun expanse beyond the kitchen window. “Seeds, implements, etcetera.”
He gave her another squeeze, then stepped away to remove his suit jacket and hang it on the back of the kitchen chair.
“Autumn is my favourite season,” John confessed. “And that,” Sherlock’s slicked fist slid up and then quickly down, “is my favourite, oh God, you, you.” He clawed at Sherlock through the fabric of his shirt.
John grinned. “I guess I’d better see to it. Wouldn’t want ‘Men in Kilts’ cleaning service,” he gestured to the lettering on the front of his shirt, “to get a bad reputation for leaving a job undone, even if I am just filling in for Stamford for the day.”
Sherlock smirked. “That’s not coffee he’s stirring. It’s Hotel Chocolat’s dark cocoa supreme. Lestrade wouldn’t spend that kind of money on a hot beverage, so it’s a gift, and that,” he nodded to a thermos flask on the desk, “is not his. Arrived this morning. With a note?”
“What do you have for me here?” said Lestrade when he’d finished adjusting the blindfold over Mycroft’s eyes. He circled Mycroft’s kneeling form, then removed Mycroft’s tie and waistcoat and unbuttoned Mycroft’s shirt.
Eventually, however, they end up in a bedroom, usually Sherlock’s, and they fuck until one of them falls asleep, usually John.
A spot of work first, of course. It had been a nice touch, leaving the body to be found on the ski lift in the morning, a real, almost classic ‘howdunit’ kind of thing. He’d been so proud of it, in fact, he wanted to stick around and see the looks on their baffled faces, but that wouldn’t do. He’d cleared out as soon as the job was done and met the boss here.
Jim was getting as deliciously hot and bothered as the Molly of the video was, and as she pulled off her jumper, he looked about quickly and improvised.
“What did your mother prepare on your birthday, Holmes?” I asked, then added hesitantly, in recognition of class distinctions, “Or, perhaps, Cook?”
“I’d love to,” blurted Mycroft in a manner so adolescent it made his cheeks warm, but the Detective Inspector’s eyes lit, and he waggled his eyebrows in a suggestive manner and spoke in an even more suggestive manner,
Sherlock Holmes was a mystery. Though I accompanied him on many adventures, I never knew the full extent of his professional dealings. My chronicles are more than the tip of the iceberg, but they don’t tell every story because, quite simply, I don’t know every story.
But I'm not completely done. I've still got Dia de los Muertos so the plan is to sneak in at least one more that I didn't have the time or energy to get done in October. Then I'll probably take a bit of break and get the batteries charged for Christmas!
The warm sun on my face served to ease some of the frustration which mounted as my eyes lit on rampant weeds and unpruned branches and neglected beds, but when we passed by my poor abandoned shed, I had to stifle a sob.
Lestrade laughed again. “Mycroft, I’ve been thinking, well, a lot and a long time. Well, I don’t know if you even…”
Sally’s hand snaked out from the duvet. “I want to show you something.” She tapped the screen with her thumb. “You like pretty things.”
Whispered groan became chanted litany as shaking hands searched for, and finally found, shaking fur.
“Don’t worry, Marie,” advised Martha as they climbed the steps to the porch. “When the Devil closes a window, he opens a door. Now, let’s rescue my tenants.”
When the press of his fingers became less exploratory and more manipulative, no pretense was required.
John pressed her forehead to Sherlock’s temple. “We fucked like rabbits. All over the bloody flat. I could not get enough of you, Sherlock. It was madness. I wanted to…”
Mycroft’s heart fluttered but Ice prevailed. “No, my own workplace is holding its own Yuletide festivities.”
“Just a little more. You’re not pink enough, princess. I want your pretty skin the colour of that pretty new corset I got you.”
“Listen, this may be a very stupid thing for me to say, but when this case is over, when it’s all done, I’m going to go home and have a shower and a ten-hour nap and a shave and a meal that I don’t eat standing up with one hand.”
Seb knows what he did when he found him, judging by the wave of coppery air hitting Seb’s battered olfactory system.
Kate didn’t need to sink into her role. She’d been there since she started her journey, following the cryptic clues—learnt by rote and burnt—step by step to this frozen corner of the world. She was good at following instructions, made for it, in fact.
He, Jim, was wearing nothing but a blend of his own and Seb’s quick-drying spunk, a state of affairs he wanted to remedy as soon as possible.
Lestrade rubbed it and kissed it affectionately. He looked at Mycroft, who was still curled on his side and still sleeping, if his breathing was any indication.
“He had many tentacles, like an octopus, and he was in love with a doctor. Bizarre but diverting and heart-warming, and I’ve been told that later there will be a series about a long-suffering landlady whose tenant, a famous detective, persists in driving her to drink and rent hikes by destroying the furnishings with his failed scientific experiments.”
“Just in time for cocoa!” cried John, stepping over Lestrade as he carried a mug to the table beside Sherlock’s chair. “It’s spiced. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise.”
“That’s the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard you say. And I’ve heard a lot. Only one thing would make it feel better.”
Molly unfastened the clasp of her bra. Sherlock’s hands pushed under the fabric and cupped her breasts. He kneaded them, rubbing the nipples with his thumbs as John ate her out.
They both sprang to their feet. Irene resettled upside down on the lounge chair. Molly turned and carefully straddled Irene’s face, looking down toward her nude body.
Mycroft leaned forward and plucked a pen from a jar. “You’ll wake up with the words written on your bare thigh tomorrow morning. Shall we?”
“I think I have,” quipped Lestrade with a glance at the beside clock. “Or am well on my way to doing so.”
“You are marvelous,” he said with undisguised admiration. Then he kissed her lips. “How? Please tell me.”
“Well, for the record, I think your tongue is just as sensitive as it ever was,” said Watson cheekily, as they made their return to the cottage hand-in-hand, “but, of course, more spice can be arranged.”
of a couple swimming in a flooded Piazza San Marco in Venice. I had 30 minutes to write and I had to limit myself to telling the story in the photo (which was the most difficult part).
Seb had had no previous idea that Jim liked this, sweaty, dirty, post-game fucking, but if he’d been on the fence about sticking with the team, well, he wasn’t anymore.
“That feels like the lot,” said John as Sherlock pulled out. “The heat-fog lifts as quickly as it settles.”
“No, his business card. His has a new title.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed. “As much as I hate to think about it, I do wish Mycroft and Lestrade would reach an understanding. Then Mycroft might have less time to bother me with his twaddle.”
He found a nice, comfortable chair and an old fashioned paper-and-ink newspaper and sat by the fire, reading for half an hour. Then he folded his paper, unfolded himself, and proceeded to a second chamber, passing the coin to the attendant as he entered.
Sherlock made a noise, conceding the point, then he quirked an apologetic half-smile. “I’m sorry. Bit not good to contemplate the hypothetical plans of criminal masterminds when one has just engaged in a rather splendid frigging session with one’s flatmate. And blogger.”
“Yes, there’s nothing like silk. Satin. Lace. All very beautiful. And, of course, the modern elastics are extraordinarily useful. But silk is ancient and for texture, well, is there anything better? No, I don’t think so.”
“You’ve had a long day, and you need something to take the edge off. A warm, wet mouth round your cock, sucking you off, giving you what you need. You don’t want to be bothered with names or faces or all the rest of it. You’re too tired for that. The world is full of tiresome people, and you just want to get off. You see a hole in a wall, and it’s so tempting. You know that on the other side is a perfect mouth waiting to give you exactly what you need.”
As Holmes ran his fingers along the case’s interior, I noticed the discrepancy of the exterior bulk and the interior shallowness.
John looked up and blinked. “For eating a unicorn fairy cake?” he asked in a breathy, unusually high-pitched voice.
“I’d be remiss if I didn’t show you all the features of interest,” said Mycroft. He turned and Lestrade read ‘princess’ in curled dark pink lettering across the back of the knickers.
“Please do me the honour of being my guest, Miss Clock,” said Mister Holmes. He had risen, as had all the other men at the table.
Mycroft was on all fours, wrists and ankles restrained by the stand. Mycroft’s lips were stretched around Lestrade’s prick. The blindfold remained, but the gold star clamps and the bra were scattered on the floor. Mycroft’s arse was a well-spanked pink, and a mechanised arm was thrusting a dildo, the second of three, rhythmically into Mycroft’s hole.
I returned to my attention to the experiment before me, and by the time the quest for truth released its grip on me once more, I was being serenaded by Watson’s snores. One of Clark Russell’s finest sea stories was about to plunge from his lap to the rug and one of the fruits—the choicest, going by its beauty—of my latest fee was tucked beside him in his armchair.
Sherlock and John meet at a carnival. Alternate First Meet. Rating: Teen. Fluff & feels. Warning for Americanisms run amok. I do not know how these kinds of places work (amusement parks, fairs, carnivals, etc.) in the UK.
He slowly scraped his teeth against the spoon—not fork, fork left too much behind—and held it in his mouth until it melted.
“There will be a stage. The lady devil worshippers will have a dance. Then the virgin is led to the altar.”
Author's Note: First half takes place immediately at the end of "The Empty House" and the second part between "The Empty House" and "The Norwood Builder." For the LJ Watson's Woes January prompt: second chances.
Interesting, if true, but unlikely. Your respect for other’s privacy is a well-established part of your knight’s code.
“Your body knows me, John. It remembers.” He pressed his lips to front of John’s trousers. “’Free your erection,’ as they say, and let me remind the rest of you.”
Of course, John could’ve brought the kettle and tea things in the bedroom, but that seemed wrong. He couldn’t do what was required of him with the tea things watching.
Lestrade leaned forward, openly ogling the silk bodice of the gown. “I could just keep you under close watch.”
“There isn’t cocoa, you git.” John’s hand reached farther back to Sherlock’s buttock, pulling him closer and rubbing seductively against him. “Wow, you are much better, aren’t you? Fuck, love that arse. And that prick.”
“The window for indulging in this is narrow,” said John when they had been reduced to a pair of sticky, sweaty tangled bodies on the sitting room rug.
“There are thousands of cafés in this city. I know, I’ve staggered ‘bout the whole place and counted. Seen ‘em all. Had a drink in most of ‘em. I picked this one because they only give me the second worst table. That lump of a fellow, just beyond my bad shoulder, yes, him, Methuselah’s rag-and-bone man, he gets the prize post, but I suppose he’s beyond caring about the view of anything but the pearly gates. And there’s lots to see even from here. The painters, the writers, the poets, the actors, the worn-out soldiers, the once-were’s, the never-were’s, the might-have-been’s. The crooks and the gamblers and the swindlers and the roughs. They say there’s even a fellow on the prowl who likes to jump up and garrote you when you’re just shuffle along, minding your own business. But I haven’t seen ‘im. Yes, there’s a lot to see. And then there’s you.”
A stinger is crème de menthe and brandy. It's a play on the word 'waspie,' which is a type of corset.
When the song ended, Molly whispered in one of the pair’s ear what she wanted. Then a few words were whispered in Molly’s ear. She nodded.
“Toby!” called Molly, “Company’s coming!” She turned on the oven then went to the refrigerator and got out the tub of pre-made biscuit dough. “Must give the tub a quick scrub, too,” she muttered. “And put the bathrobe in the dryer for a few minutes.

John pushed his arse back and bent lower, bracing himself against the car window. He drew the fabric of his costume up higher. “Give him a good show, Sherlock. Yeah, nice and rough. Let ‘em get a close-up shot of that gorgeous prick stretching my hole. Is he getting hard?”
Suddenly, John jerked up, reached back, and grabbed Sherlock’s head by the hair at the scalp. Then he pressed the side of his face to Sherlock’s and forced them both to look toward the silhouette.
Lestrade toed out of his shoes and climbed on the sofa. Sherlock turned his head and took Lestrade’s prickhead in his mouth. And sucked.
Well, of course, he’d sing about love! Most of the songs ever written, and thus ever sung, dealt with nothing else!
“…than suicide chips? Yeah, don’t kill yourself. That’s so three years ago. I have to say I’m a bit envious, Sherlock.”
“Tomorrow we will hike to the Fairy Pools, Watson. They are a series of waterfalls, but do not be anxious. They are, in all aspects but one, the very opposite of the Reichenbach abyss. The waters are sapphire and emerald, and the falls themselves are low and welcoming. They attract lovers of nature and bold bathers alike. If the beauty does not ease your fears, then my hand is yours whenever you require it. And because you are the most faithful of companions, I shall give you a clue.”
“For a criminal mastermind and brilliant sniper, you certainly are a pair of idiots,” said Molly. “I want both.”
“Perhaps, but as its proprietor is, at the moment, engaged in the heated theological argument, he’s unlikely to become aware and even less likely to prosecute.”
Lestrade decorated Mycroft’s belly with streams of come. “You like watching my sword practice?” he asked.
Seb slipped out of the jacket, then out of his shirt, then put the jacket back on over his bare chest. “Better?”
Molly’s heels were digging into a dark uniform shirt with stenciled lettering, and her hips were bucking into an open mouth. Her thighs came together hard. She gave a needy little cry, then a satisfied hum, then unfolded like a flower.
But thus far, Molly had enjoyed everything. She leaned back into Irene’s hands, arching her spine, as Irene licked.
They needed to balance the sweetness of miraculous homecomings and answered prayers with the sourness of reproaches and mistrusts; the bitterness of memories apart with the fluffy, ephemeral promise of tomorrows together.
“And so if I did like this,” Holmes picked up a cushion and slid a hand into its cover and pulled out a large frame, “I might find something interesting.”
“—she was able to determine that something untoward was happening at Ormond House. At the same hour every Tuesday, a disguised person came to one of the side doors, not the same person but always disguised as a beggar. That person made the expected supplication. The housekeeper went to a certain cupboard and gave them bread wrapped in a handkerchief. No other servant was permitted this task.”
Golden dawn breaks. John is standing in front of the toilet, and Sherlock’s hand is still round John’s dick where he’s held it as John emptied his bladder. Sherlock’s hand doesn’t move. He’s not stroking, not caressing. He’s simply standing very close to John and holding him.
Sherlock poured the contents of the blender into two glasses. “Three weeks ago, when you and Lestrade argued, this beverage smoothed things over nicely.”
“Yes, Doctor, I wanted him to slash my drawers with the penknife, mount me, and take me. Not caring if St. Simon, the driver, or his whole band of merry men heard us.”
“Oh, she loves it! And she’s brilliant at it! Better than I am, in fact. She got out all the bits from that fowl experiment Mister Holmes did the other day.”
John stifled a shout as Sherlock swallowed his cock. As he jerked hard into the wet heat of Sherlock’s mouth, the whole tableau—ladder and lovers—threatened to pitch on the floor.
” The last was a weary huff. “’Tis odd, though, to have the rest of your life coloured by such a blink of an eye.”
“Those gorgeous lips,” I breathed when I found I could breathe, “from which spout such clever, clever cleverness.”
It was the second time I’d uttered those words in what was shaping up to be an interminable return journey to Baker Street. The hansom cab had slowed to stop again, this time as a result of road upheaval rather than an overturned brougham. Another detour and another delay seemed inevitable.
Irene knew it, too, for after she spoke her scripted line, after she made her grand entrance back from the dead, back into Kate’s life, she said,
“Of course, they were,” countered Mrs. Hudson, quick to defend any suggestion, unspoken or otherwise, that a maid for whom she had given a glowing reference would have any other kind of instincts.
“Would you like to come over to mine? We could get some drinks and catch up. Listen to music. Like old times.”
“Ah-ha! Then you see them for the amateurs they are!” He laughed, then drew closer. “My dear Watson, what say we hurry back to our cosy rooms and remedy this oversight at once? Chemically-speaking, of course.”
“We don’t want additional trouble. You played with their affections. It was diverting. You didn’t intend for Elliot to take the dagger from his brigand chief costume and stab his cousin because of it.”
Soon, the usually silent, solitary well was the centre of noise and activity. Among those who arrived there was a familiar face.
“I’d prefer to take you home for a hot drink and a change of clothes. You must be,” Mycroft turned his head and gave Sherlock a sweeping glance, “cold.”
She was bringing drinks to a group of Alphas at one of the tables in the centre of the room. The stalls were along the edges.
Holmes led me along a slippery path to a curtain of turquoise-coloured water. Then he raised a hand and, as with a curtain, drew the water aside.
I wrenched my gaze away from the sofa and discovered the instrument in question standing in the corner of the room.
“Let me drink from you, John. Champagne is such a poor substitute.” Sherlock pressed one hand to the base of John’s cock and then bobbed his head, sucking greedily until John came. “Delicious,” he said, sitting back on his heels and licking his lips.
“As with so many things, there is method in my madness, Watson. No one will think anything of two clowns doing this.”
“He’s a clever cat.” She tapped the shaft of the riding crop against her palm. “He figured you out, didn’t he?”
Holmes had to stop and catch his breath. Watson put a hand on his shoulder and spoke his name with utmost concern.
Fresh from the scene of crime solved, with a heady mixture of pride, awe, and schoolboy lust still throbbing in my veins, I was restless, to say the least. My body verily thrummed with the unspoken, the pent-up. I rubbed my hand down my thighs for the hundredth time, spreading my fingers then curling the tips downward, gripping the dark wool of my trousers with a cat-like clawing.
“Yes, so is the substance that you put in your tea this morning. It wasn’t sugar, of that I’m certain. I think it holds the key to what happened to the Sandersons. Here’s a blanket. C’mon. Up you go. That’s a lad. No need to scare the squirrels.”
I knew myself to be alone, but I still cast a furtive look about the room. Naughty thoughts at the breakfast table about one’s friend and fellow lodger were unbecoming.
“Please let me touch you. Please let my hands roam where they may. Let them pet you, stroke you, caress you like the cherished companion that you are. Let my fingertips know your hair. They ache, you beast. They despair of knowing your soft and silken from your damp and matted from your wiry and coarse.”
In few minutes, Molly was grateful she hadn’t even considered knickers. One lovely mouth was making love to her clit while another was worshipping her arse. She looked down at her own chest and smiled.
John returned the book to the shelf. The poem might not be Sherlock’s. The book appeared to have had at least a couple of prior owners, and John didn’t know Sherlock’s handwriting very well.
I settled myself on the bench by the back door and watched as Holmes resumed his playing and dancing.
as you did to prepare for the writing of your memoir, I imagine would suggest patterns,” said Holmes. “Patterns of failure, of course, or they would not be ‘criminals you have caught.’”
She was still holding the parasol when the boat makes the turn and she was him pacing the shore. It’s cliché, but she did, in fact, release the breath she’s been holding.
“Doctor, this is my older sister, Violeta. She heard of my injuries from my landlord and insists on taking over the care of me.”
“Holmes, you know the world of match-making suffered a great loss when you went in for crime-solving.”
“I’m not as thick as your brother supposes. If you want to tell me, I’m listening, but if it’s,” he made a vague gesture with his hands, “then, that’s all right, too.”
It was decided: he would rid himself of his drawers, spit on his palm, and find his release in this very spot.
“You think it’s just John’s tears? Because there’s about a dozen motherfuckers I wouldn’t mind giving the ol’ onion to.”
An assortment of insects was added, and then Mrs. Hudson began to chant with Mrs. Turner forming the chorus.
I decide upon the brave notion of watching our Baker Street rooms from afar and sneaking back to my bedroom as soon as I observed Holmes leaving. I would read the book myself, then
“He wasn’t good to begin with. I don’t know how he’s kept his job. Well, I do know, but still. He’s a bastard.”
Holmes saw the lad in his dreams, his face a fresh two-and-twenty and his air of refinement and delicacy which he carried about him like a well-tailored cloak.
As Holmes seemed to have an appetited for nothing save smoking and pacing and as I had a long train journey ahead of me, I helped myself to his plate of eggs and kippers after I’d finished my own. On the table, the morning papers sat neatly folded, untouched by either of us. Since our first salutations, Holmes had been lost in fog of unvoiced concerns and I was, therefore, lost in Holmes, trying to determine the cause of this acute and unusual presentation of nerves.
I touched the first photograph, drawing a fingertip across her brow as if to dispel the sadness from her eyes. Courage, she never lacked though fortune was exceedingly unkind. I could do, be, no less.
Sherlock paused and met his gaze and nodded. Then he jerked his head and quirked a wicked smile. “I’ve got an oral fixation.”
John sashayed down the stairs in nothing but lacy dark pink knickers and sheer stockings held up by a lacy pink belt.
The next weekend that Mycroft was at the cottage the weather was ghastly. It was difficult to tell if anything had been done to the garden: hard rain had battered it plenty. That night, Mycroft thought he heard a scratching. He opened the back door, and a streak of grey fur flashed by his legs.
On the Eve of St. Agnes, Succubus Irene visits the ladies. Demonic possession. Irene/Molly. Irene/Stella. Irene/Sally. Irene/Anthea. Irene/Mrs. Hudson.
“Thank you. He was sick for long time. Cancer. It’s taken while get things settled and figure out what I want to do next.”
“And Mrs. Hudson ought to receive an award for assembling a supper both toothsome and capable of being consumed one-handedly.”
“This.” Sherlock held up a red jumper. “Happy Christmas, John,” he said as he laid it on the bar beside John’s pint.
A few hard sucks, however, and I was yanking Holmes to his feet and throwing him face-first upon the very table at which we breakfasted every morning.
“Like that,” said Mycroft, letting the hand that wasn’t holding the umbrella handle drop and rub the bulge in the front of Lestrade’s trousers. “Well, then there’s only one thing left to ask, I suppose.”
“Quite possibly.” Holmes looked upon the figure, which might have been an idol or an urn. “But I’m glad that she’s returned to her art.”
I placed a hand on his head and began to stroke his hair and, in a while, he sniffed and raised himself to sitting.
“—and I believe, at this very moment, Inspector Lestrade is saying quite a bit to them, including advising them of their right to a solicitor—”
“I’m sorry that I just disappeared,” said John. "I thought it would be fun, but it was too much. Too loud. Too many people. My second Christmas since Afghanistan, but I’m still not ready to be drinking Mince Pie Martinis.”
“They are when they’re not invited to a party where their Sugar Plum Fairy has worn this dress.” He eased the zipper down and sent the pink satin and tulle to the floor. Then he kissed down her spine and to the cleft of her buttocks where he bit at the tiny pink ribbons.
Watson dropped his weapon, wiped his forehead, and sighed, and he and I stood drinking in the sweet sight of the curled bodies for a few ragged breaths while the sun shone and the birds sang and spring continued its springing.
And his nose, his cheekbones, his chin, those grey eyes beneath arched brows, those lips still holding that smile…
Lestrade murmured into Mycroft’s hair, “Pity. I just bought you a postcard. Air mail stamp and everything.”
“I want to show I’m husband material.” Lestrade looked away and shrugged. “It’s the heat,” he added coyly.
Mycroft’s glance caught a very slight, but thoroughly charming blush about the cheeks. And there was bit of schoolboy snickering.
Lestrade hummed and looked at Sherlock through half-lidded eyes. “Can I take you home?” he asked softly.
“Well, here’s your poltergeist.” Lestrade handed the device to Mycroft. “Suppose you know who’s responsible.”
Lestrade and his team raid a restaurant where Mycroft is a patron. Mystrade. Snog. Fluff. Rating: Mature.
He closed his eyes and considered other wagers he might lose while Seb began pounding his hole and humming a horrid tune about a bloody…
“Indeed. The only portion of the garden unoccupied is a dark pool at the lowermost edge. I do not want to stay. I want
I ended up living in rooms in Queen Anne Street for a period after that, although ‘living’ is an exaggeration as I’d left behind most of my belongings, and when I was not at my surgery or with Holmes on a case, I was staring at a blank wall, contemplating his confession of love and his proposal to retire together.
John reached for the pink one, then slipped out of the robe and into it while Mycroft scooped up her mobile and dropped it in the drawer, then slammed the drawer shut with a swing of her hip. Then she sat on edge of the bed and reached for John, who curled into her lap and kissed her sweetly on the lips.
The miniskirt was rucked up, revealing a swathe of hot pink lace strangling a half hard cock. A turn, and there was another, slightly larger swathe with the word ‘JUICY’ written in curled script.
The room was dark and locked. Sherlock sat upright in a dressing gown which was untied, open, and hanging comfortably on his shoulders. His forearms and hands rested on the arms of the chair. His eyes were closed.
Mycroft rose. “Never, Detective Inspector, and especially not when a ‘brown as a nut’ holiday is at stake. Best of luck.”
“Gregory.” A hand on Lestrade’s shoulder stopped him from getting to his feet. “It’s all right. The glitter in the cake icing was drugged.”
Brush by brush, he works until the boots gleam like a mid-winter night’s sky and his conclusions sparkle like stars.
The only rule I have about this entire collection is no angst. So why Lestrade is gutted here isn't going to be mentioned. If you want the hurt part of this hurt/comfort, watch the scene from "The Lying Detective" with Lestrade and Culverton Smith confessing. And weep for our favourite silver fox as I did.
“I’m going to slow down so I don’t hurt myself or you or John by spilling a scalding beverage. But, no, bratty little pricksluts who wake me up on my day off begging for their holes to be filled are going to get them filled! Tout! Suite!”
It was the morning of the second day of Watson’s convalescence after being shot by the man who went by many names including John Garrideb.
Doctor and nurse, Molly has just finished changing his dressings, reassessing his wounds, and helping him to and in the loo.
“Whatever it is, it’s here, Musgrave,” said Sherlock. He took his scarf and looped it through the rusted iron ring in the centre of the heavy flagstone. “C’mon, help. You may be a dandy, but you’re still a nightwalker.”
Mycroft poured the last drops in his glass down Lestrade’s throat, forever associating the two tastes in Lestrade’s mind.
“I have to go, Mycroft, but whatever you do, don’t open that little bottle. Don’t uncork it, don’t smell it, don’t drink it. Just don’t."
Sherlock nodded. He made a strolling circle around the interior of the tiny shop. He checked his mobile.
John's not happy Sherlock tried on his kilt without asking. Spanking. Oral sex. Very brief Daddy kink (not enough, in my opinion, to tag for, but YMMV and fair warning in case it's a squick or trigger).
He tucked in the note in his pocket and took up his Gladstone. Then he marched out of 221 Baker Street with the determined step of one who is going to get all his work done quickly so he can be free to enjoy himself at an appointed hour.
Molly gathered up the empty teacups and plate and set them in the sink, then she busied about the kitchen for a few minutes.
“John’s on a date tonight,” said Sherlock as he dumped the sardines in dish. “He’s got his wet pussy, I suppose, but I prefer mine.” He placed the sardines beside the milk. “Don’t know why John keeps these in the flat, I’ve never seen him eat them.”
“That’s why you’re a good detective: you always ask the right the question. A colleague just had a spot for a regular open up. Guess Mrs. Anderson decided that playing Godzilla to someone’s Tokyo for free was better than paying for it.”
“All coppers is crooks!” said Mycroft in a false growl. Then he snuggled closer and said in his own voice, “You do know how to make lemonade out of lemons, Detective Inspector.”
I remained in a purgatorial state for two weeks, receiving regular coded telegrams from Holmes advising me of his wellbeing but nothing more.
When he woke, his hand was on John’s thigh. He rubbed tentatively and got a lovely, prick-stiffening rumble in reply.
Sherlock nodded then he looked down and found sometime, unknown to him, he had taken John’s hand in his and was squeezing it. He quickly released it.
A head cocked to one side. And Mycroft recognised clothes as those of a bundle he’d stumbled upon while trailing Cossington. Thinking that they were Cossington’s and that he might return for them, Mycroft had left them in their waterproof bag where he’d found them.
For a moment, the only noise in the room was the crackling of the fire, and the only movement, the other side of the quilt slipping down the settee.
“She shredded his dick off with her—!” shrieked the client. He wrenched out of the guard’s grasp and fled down the stairs and out the door.
It took longer than it should’ve to get settled, but they could not keep their hands off each other, and John was in real danger of spending in Sherlock’s hand if Sherlock didn’t stop playing under the kilt.
The scene was cottage garden and back door. There was enough distinction to make the puzzle interesting but not so much as to overwhelm. Holmes had chosen carefully. Not too many pieces, not too few. A quiet but not tranquilising landscape. Rich colours which might appeal to Watson’s artistic sense, which on a visual scale was much more sophisticated than Holmes’s own.
Mary tried to smile. “Always ahead of the curve, wasn’t I? Dying well before everyone else was doing it!”
Then John presses his nose into Sherlock’s hair and breathes in the fragrance of poncey shampoo. Then he kisses down and up the entire length of Sherlock’s spine.
Such display of uncharacteristic anxiety, not to mention lack of erudition, had me even more puzzled.
They will fuck, eventually. They’ll slick and probe and breech and sink and sheath and thrust, with all the heady acoustical accompaniment and the twisted sheets and the sweat pooling between shoulder blades. There will be pleas and urgings and profane cries swallowed, bitten short.
“It'd mar the line of the suit,” hissed Mycroft as he yanked Moriarty’s trousers down and removed the plug.
Sherlock’s expression turned scornful. “If you’re suggesting that any orgasm experienced by my Omega would be subpar…”
Something had her wrists pinned to the bed. Something had her legs spread open. Something warm and wet and wonderful was playing with her clit.
“You don’t really want to know, my Queen,” he said, answering the unspoken question, “at least not all of it, but at the moment, one thought is how utterly lovestruck I am. You could not look more beautiful.”
Then he cupped Mycroft’s jaw and leaned forward. Mycroft sighed into the kiss and when it finally broke, snuggled closer to Lestrade and smiled at the screen.
When Sherlock pulled back, her eyelids drooped. “The way you fuck yourself on me. Your wetness. Your scent. The way your body moves.” She smiled and asked, “Do you mind?” Her hand dropped between her legs.
“She saw you kill him. She didn’t realise it at first, or, indeed, as I mentioned, for some time, but it eventually dawned on her what she had seen and how she must’ve been a pawn in your chess game. Constant had been drugged by you the night before under the guise of a remedy for his toothache. Mrs. Turner, not being able to rouse him at the time he’d requested, jumped to the most morbid of conclusions and went, as you foresaw, across the street to solicit your help. With a former Scotland Yard detective living across from one’s residence, who wouldn’t? You broke in the door and made the necessary exclamations. She hid her face in her hands. And you slit the poor sleeping man’s throat.”
He held her and caressed her while Molly relaxed against him and thought about what she wanted to happen next.
No, they did not help her dress. They completely impeded the dressing process with their kisses and their caresses. Molly had to stop and let Sherlock’s fingers coax her through a second, smaller, but sweeter, orgasm.
Lestrade looked at it like Cinderella might eye her former pumpkin, with pleasure and no little awe.
'verse) have a second date: dinner & a film in Mycroft's home cinema. Fluff. Only a bit of kissing. References to the 1956 film
“Too bad. I bet John’d suck a pair of ginger balls all night.” He took one of Mycroft’s sacs in his mouth and then the other. “Like this.”
John’s hands have joined Sherlock’s. They work together for a while, then slick fingers are curled into slick fists that grip tightly and squeeze as they pump up and down. John takes over the pleasuring of Sherlock’s prick, and Sherlock, the pleasuring of John’s.
“Not an adage with which I’m familiar. The one I know is ‘Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance’—or keep afloat—'you must keep moving.’ Stop and you sink, as you so aptly demonstrated. Another go, sailor?”
Panicked, John had raced back to the brothers, who had, in a matter of hours, discovered the murderer and cleared John of all suspicion. And, then, with a tap of a mobile, the well-hung buggers had contacted the agency and hired him, John, to service them.
“Goodness! What a wicked world! I would advise a liniment applied twice a day. Shall I do the first application here?”
On the small screen, there was a blip, and Sherlock was seen in profile. He was leaning forward, towards a pillow, with one hand wrapped round his prick and the front of knickers yanked down to his balls. He was reaching back with the other hand, grasping the protruding handle of the dildo. The back of the knickers was bunched to the cleft of his arse.
Sherlock brings their pricks together and wraps his hands round both. “What about my sexy boyfriend who gets naked at the drop of a hat and is blessed with a prick that was made for wickedness?”
A Witches' Brew is cranberry juice, pineapple juice, rum, and something fancy with a strawberry to make it look like blood is dripping in it.
Mycroft quickly straddled Lestrade’s upper body and said firmly, “None of that. Put that tongue to much better use.” He spread his buttocks and lowered his hole to Lestrade’s mouth.
“I’m clean. Not that you should take my word for it. I’m not a student. I just need a lab. To pay the bills, I got a gig from a candle company to make a fragrance for their Valentine’s Day line. Oh, God!”
Seb rose and set the gun down on the seat of the chair and walked to Jim, who turned, showing off a vertical row of cloth-covered buttons from nape to waist.
Jeanine rut on Sally’s cupped hand until one finger was buried deep inside her. Sally curled it while she teased Jeanine clit with her thumb. “Like that?”
“Nah, I’m a moth. I was a moth, that is, but fate has seen fit to rip my bloody wings off, and now I’m going to have to fashion some new wings. Out of what, I can’t fathom. But I know I can’t do it here. But, as God is my witness, I’m going to miss you, Sherlock Holmes, down to the tips of my bloody fingernails. But I think we both knew I was just an early chapter in your story.” He winked.
“Come in.” Lestrade slammed the door behind Mycroft, then tossed the cone of nuts beside the other three on the counter. “I don’t really need you to spackle. I need you to stay here and answer the door and tell whoever it happens to be—nicely, diplomatically—to shove their roasted chestnuts up their arse!”
in silence, then they’d carefully, tentatively, tried a dialogue, and when John had first called Sherlock ‘Baby’ and Sherlock had responded immediately with ‘Daddy,’ well, they knew they’d found what worked.
“And I’m no proper genius, Greg, but as of right now, I don’t think those two are going anywhere until last call.”
Irish eyes are smiling ('cause Jim's in heat). Mormor. Omega!Jim/Alpha!Seb. Gun play. Knotting. For all that, very sweet.
A Be Mine is a very complicated drink made of pisco, pineau des charentes, pineapple syrup, lime juice, egg white, sparkling wine, and one of three other liquors to add the colour. Then you are supposed to make a stencil of the words BE MINE out of sturdy plastic and spray the whole business with Angostura bitters. Impressive presentation but a lot of work!
“I could drown in you,” said John before turning her head to lick the ridge of Lestrade’s shoulder. Lestrade’s hand travelled down, around the side of John’s hip and under her knee. She hoisted John’s leg up and then began to caress her buttock.
“I am certain that what Miss Mohels’ clients say as well,” I retorted. “And you are a perfect vision in mauve.”
If Mrs. Hudson was surprised when the invitation came, she gave no outward sign. She simply remembered that she had some Victoria sponge fingers and a bottle of elderflower cordial that would go nicely with the dessert.
Holmes ducked before a second tin could hit him square in the jaw. He stood between accuser and accused, which, stood proud, staked and tied but, admittedly, not in bloom.
I smashed my lips into his, then grabbed his head on both hands, steadying it so that I could drink my fill from those gorgeous lips.
I chewed on my cigar and produced my library card with a flourish. “Splendid! I don’t want to belong to a club that would accept
“Oh, shit. It’s like coming but not coming. Coming from the inside. It’s warm and sort of gooey. Oh, God. What’s you name? I want to say it when I…”
“You knew at once it wasn’t a model or a mannequin lying on her side in that pumpkin despite the ceramic mask.”
The relief of the released pressure and the firm caress of Sherlock’s hand and the solidity of Sherlock’s body behind him and the humid cocoon of the bathroom were all mingling.
Being only human, I’d often speculated in the three years I’d been away what might’ve happened if Moriarty had been the victor, if I hadn’t chosen the path I’d chosen, if, if, if…
Once a season, Sherlock made an appointment, went to an address, bought a drink he didn’t want, and asked for the Trojan room. Sherlock/Unspecified. Glory hole. Pseudo-bestiality (equine).
Soon her legs were wrapped around his waist, and he had her braced against the trunk of a gnarly tree, his prick buried inside her.
“We traded some bake goods for it,” explained John truthfully. Sherlock added a plausible story for Stella to tell her supervisors.
“Boss told me to tell you to make yourself at home and I was to extend every courtesy and offer every comfort. Like this.”
“Oh, Counselor, I assure you that it does! But why should you deride the word of Miss Violet Mohels, prostitute, and take the word of Sherlock Holmes, detective, as Gospel!”
John was certain the stranger was going to say ‘fuck.’ In fact, John was so certain he was going to say ‘fuck’ that he missed what he did say.
But the succour of true friendship is a heady wine. I could not resist it. I could not resist enjoying a few more days beside my faithful Boswell.
Lomax might have been startled if the figure he discovered behind him hadn’t been standing hat in hand and wearing the reverent, closed-lidded expression of one listening to an especially poignant sermon. He got to his feet and greeted the interloper.
“Understandable. I have a PA of similar temperament. Perhaps, Colonel, you’d prefer to take the role of voyeur and join in if the mood strikes.”
Everything was delicious, and Mrs. Hudson revealed that it was all purchased and delivered so that they wouldn’t have to do a thing.
“Oh, yes, something that I hope will appeal to our circumstances now as well as commemorate the past. When you first installed yourself in the Baker Street rooms, you brought something with you, something that did not remain for very long.”
More than a little tickled at the turn of events and hoping Watson would not injure himself in the pursuit, I abandoned my honey-making armies and followed the two out the back gate.
crown.” Jim gestured to the jewel-encrusted item currently perched on his noggin. “If Sherlock Holmes is going to be a queen bee for Hallowe’en, well, then Jim Moriarty must be a queen!”
By the time the border was finished, they were chatting amicably. Soon, they were laughing heartily. About half of the hills of Toledo were in place when Violeta asked,
Then he went back into the bookshop, past the café, to the farthest row, a quiet place with naked light bulbs hanging down like bats.
Seb folded Jim in two, holding his legs spread and his knees back. He leaned in for another kiss that went on long enough for him to push in and bottom out. He pulled back and looked at Jim through hooded eyes.
Sally grinned. “Then I suppose we’re even.” She closed the distance between them, cupping Janine’s face, kissing her hard, and pushing her back against the interior wall.
“You said ‘just as I was,’” retorted Molly. She touched her hair. “Though this wig isn't going to last much longer. Help me.”
“I’d offer to help, but you’d just refuse. Again. Well, I have some news that might make you smile: the Anderson have reconciled.”
When Mycroft’s lap was full, he rubbed a plump bottom lip with his thumb. The pink gloss must’ve been a genuine lacquer for it didn’t smudge.
She was leaning over him, her hair cascading, the fingers of both hands twined gently in his. She slid up and down his cock slowly, staring into his green eyes, wondering just what went on behind them.
I sat on the sofa, directly in front of one of a pair of large electric fans. The fan’s twin was in Sherlock’s bedroom. I assumed that he, like I, was down to his pants and in a semi-mesmerised state from the loud hum of the machine and the whirring of the blades.
Lestrade’s eyebrows rose. He crossed his arms over his chest and rocked back on his heels. “You do it for the cuddles?” he asked with a chuckle.
In an isolated corner of the upstairs room, upon a pair of couches side by side, hidden by a painted screen, I brushed a hand along the side of his face.
There are several recipes out there for a Pete's Dragon, but lamentably I couldn't find one that involved liquid smoke :)
Sherlock stood, then made his way across the room, stumbling, and took up his original position Mycroft’s bed,
John rose to the surface of consciousness very slowly, degree by degree, but nevertheless he was keenly aware of the scene in which he found himself. It was an instinctive awareness or, perhaps, a sensational one; whatever it was, definitely not a logical, rational one.
John looked down and realised that her hips were rutting slowly against Sherlock’s bare thigh. “It seems at least part of me is reconsidering.” She curled a hand in Sherlock’s hair and kissed her soundly. “Christ, you’re gorgeous.”
I scowled. “And I daresay she wouldn’t have been brought to justice if the attendees of this quaint village fete hadn’t included the great Sherlock Holmes.”
“And much less pleasant than this,” I replied with a gentle smile. Then I looked down at my two features of interest peeking out from the mass of blankets.
Note: this chapter carries forward from the previous three, but Molly isn't part of the pairing. If you haven't read the previous chapters, just know that Molly got shagged in the body freezer by Sherlock & John and then Moriarty & Moran and when Mycroft & Lestrade show up, she mistakenly thinks they want a go too and she'd not having it, 'cause, you know, work to do.
He chuckled, then sighed. “My dear, you and I are civil servants, and the administrative handbook clearly states that a superior and—“
He pushed up, covering her body with his own, curling his head ‘round hers, the better to flick her earlobe with the tip of his tongue.
“Yeah,” said John with a wicked grin. He uncurled and crawled toward Sherlock. “And now, if you’re amenable, this wet pussy’s going to come all over you.”
“Happy Christmas, Detective Inspector,” said Mycroft with a nod of the head, which made him feel a bit player in a Dickens drama, but then he supposed that there was more truth than fiction to the notion.
John accidentally yanks the chain, but it isn’t an accident. It’s a reminder. That he is hostage and captor; that wherever Sherlock goes, he
The conversation was easy, and the silences were filled by Bessie watching the two inspectors across the table bicker like an old married couple and surreptitiously throw bits of bread at each other like schoolboys.
“You don’t seem like a man who’s just solved an unsolvable case, one that will, with high probability, make you an inspector.”
The prosecutor turned his back to the witness and said, “Your trade does not value keen powers of observation, Miss…”
I move slowly, afraid of scaring whatever it is. I poke it again, and when it doesn’t move, I lean in, studying the shape.
Fucking is not easy like this. But neither is wondering if the man beneath John is a figment of the oozing wound of John’s imagination.
The lucre is sometimes deferred, meaning success in one case leads to the arrival of other cases, the latter proving the more handsomely remunerative than the former. It is not as great a priority as it once was, thankfully, but with an eye towards a comfortable retirement, I still recognise the importance of the paying case.
Lomax shook his head and winced. “I’d already been beaten, but I would’ve been arrested, too, if he hadn’t hidden me.”
John continued to tease Sherlock’s hole as Sherlock braced himself on trembling limbs, begging for more with cries, arched back, and thrusts that impaled himself on John’s probing tongue.
“Excellent. Boss asked me to convey his apologies. He’ll be late. And sorry for the change of address. This is definitely coming down in the world.”
But I was also heartened because it seemed like my brother’s youthful impishness, which the years had eroded, had been restored by his association with Doctor Watson.
Sorrel is a traditional Jamaican Christmas punch with white rum, dried hibiscus flowers (sorrel), and the usual Christmas punch spices.
The second time Mycroft found his herb garden rooted ,a fox emerged from the undergrowth and approached Mycroft. Mycroft did not move, not even when fox curled between his legs like a cat. Then, with a flick of bushy tail, the fox disappeared.
Mycroft pulled the vest over his head and let it drop. He sighed and then slipped his hands beneath Sherlock’s shirt and jacket. Sherlock shrugged out of the garments, then tumbled to the floor.
She stepped ‘round the dress as she twisted, then leaned back against the counter, offering him her pussy.
Soon Sherlock was thrusting his slicked prick between Lestrade’s clenched thighs. Lestrade ran a hand down Sherlock’s side, his fingers noting the too-prominent ribs.
“My experiment had some unintended results,” said Sherlock, his silhouette visible through the curtain.
“I cannot accept that book, sir. Or your membership.” He snatched a card from Holmes’s hand and tore it to pieces.
Lestrade smiled, then pressed his lips together, then unnecessarily straightened the files on his desk.
Bad cop. Which would imply a certain amount of roughness, perhaps even physical intimidation, strong words, perhaps even a bit of vulgarity, heavy breathing—no, wait, that would be me.
But for now, they roll back and forth, trading parts of gentle surrender and benevolent conquest, of swelling and cresting and sinking. Soft, slow, as if they have all day and tomorrow and the next. As if they have infinite reserves of strength and stamina, of wit and wakefulness.
Dark hirsute chest meets smooth alabaster one, and last bits of restraint dissolve. Lestrade growls and rubs himself against Mycroft, who licks at Lestrade’s neck, teasing the fluttering pulse with the tip of his tongue.

“Thank you for my Valentine,” said Mycroft, inhaling the ripe scent of John’s pleasure mixed with the fragrance of the bubble bath. She licked her thumb and began teasing John’s nipples through the pink fabric. “Especially these, liked them so much that I rushed back to my girl.”
She woke once to him rubbing her nipples and cleavage with his come, woke again to his tongue in her arse. She suckled his prickhead once. She felt his prick inside her more than once.
John raced up the stairs and down the hall. At the sound of his stream cascading into the bowl, he sighed loudly.
“So does the chocolate go on top of the marshmallow or the marshmallow on top of the chocolate?” asked Jim. He was crouched beside the fire.
But if I want a challenge, I’ll tease you now while I’m half-hard myself. Like this. Rubbing a gloved hand along your inner thigh. So delicate, the skin. Look how it quivers, pleading for the tip of a tongue to leave a thin wet trail from knee to the core of you, trapped as it is in metal and leather and…
“I’d planned to conduct a bit of surveillance at Yew Tree Lodge in the guise of the day gardener, but she wisely pointed out real gardeners don’t work on Whit Monday.”
John could get over how naughty and delicious to be out in the open doing this. Taboo and yet completely natural, too. He’d had two long days of hard labour, and the release seemed like an appropriate reward, his due.
“Lovely bit of work,” observed Grodman with kindly insincerity. He reached to finger a muslin-trimmed edge, but no sooner had he touched it than he pulled back his hand with a start. “Huh. Curious.” He looked to the fire with a puzzled expression. “It feels rather hot. Almost stinging.”
“Then I can turn in my assignment in the morning. Whew! I worked so hard on it, and my tutor would never believe I lost it at the library. Might as well say the dog ate it. Thanks for copying it for me, too.”
Hedges and vined trellises surrounded our garden, and though we were friendly with our neighbours, there was slim possibility of any of them dropping by unheard in our remote corner of the countryside. Thus, Holmes felt the freedom, when he was not swathed to tend the hives, naturally, to wear fewer as well as much thinner articles of clothing than he would in London or in town. His exposed skin, especially that of shoulders and the bridge of his nose, inevitably broke out a dusting of freckles that I admired in every way it was possible to show admiration.
Lestrade turned sideways to sit against one of the walls. He stretched his legs out in front of him.
I felt myself being drawn to it, to its surface. It was as if I wanted nothing more than to lean over the bank and—
When Sally had finished with the one hand, she released it into warm water. Stella sat up and offered her the other hand.
“I will very shortly, but we must change the topic of conversation or I won’t be able to exit the premises without embarrassment.”
“Very careless of you, old man, to nod off so close to an open flame, you could have done yourself no end of mischief.”
Lestrade groaned. as John helped him to his feet. “You two would find the body of a missing person at the end of the world in a snowstorm.”
Jim smiled. “Fuck his mouth, my Queen. Fuck it hard. For what you did tonight, he owes you his life.”
Then he nodded, whispered a word of thanks, and marched on, head down, his shoes crunching in the gravel.
“Like this one?” John bent again and applied the same treatment to the other nipple until Sherlock began to whimper.
“Sorry, mate. The other Dracula’s been chasing me for the last half an hour, and he can’t seem to take ‘no’ for an answer. I’d rather not make a scene; everybody seems to be having such a good time.”
Holmes cared not a whit for the elements of wind and rain that whipped his body. His thoughts were one word and that word was Openshaw.
Jim swung their joined hands. “See? A normal date. Just like everybody else. Waltz through a nice garden, spot of dinner, nothing over-the-top.”
It was seventeen steps. By the time Molly reached the last, she had a white-knuckle grip on the railing.
“Nothing like two pussies rubbing together, is there? Especially when one of them is yours,” said Irene. She pressed the bottle of sunscreen into Molly’s hand. “Do yourself.”
“Yeah, well, if you hadn’t noticed, there ain’t no pillows around, Boss! There’s a hundred CCTV cameras—”
“You accidentally roofied yourself with drugged sex club glitter I had painted on my face. We fucked in an alley on the way home and then you passed out.”
“And? Oh, she wouldn’t have had much time to hide it and judging by its opposite on the table, it’s not small.”
“Sherlock’s at the Baker Street flat—with John. I’m, well, I’m here, just, well, you did say, but I should have phoned, terribly sorry, I’ll leave you to your evening.”
“Not needles,” said Holmes. The impatience in his tone, I’ll admit, was reassuring. “Needling!” he continued. “Nagging. Tiny rows. Minor squabbles. Each of itself not more a pinprick but compounded over a decade and—” He exhaled. “Lord Deveron had had enough. So had his wife. They each took a loaded revolver, a set of two on the wall, and shot the other. And all over a smudge of blacking on a dress.” He looked around him. “I know you’ve been asking me to do this. I just thought, well, perhaps I should show you a bit of consideration.”
“Yes,” said Margaret with a self-conscious chuckle. “I ordered quite a bit extra, so I wouldn’t have to worry about tomorrow.”
“Don’t remind me,” I whined, then added, trying to soften my complaint, “The salt in it does make pretty sparks.”
“You’re under strict doctor’s orders not to stir, Watson,” said a muffled voice. “Therefore, I beg you to relax your body, well, all save one part, which you may safely entrust to my tender care for the remainder of the song.”

Holmes felt the look of incredulity that clouded Watson’s features like a blow to the chest. He carried on quickly, and a bit breathlessly.
“Nah, he got mad about it and came at me with a lead pipe. Had to take ‘im down. Sorry. Guess, I’m not management material.”
The back of John’s head was hitting the cupboard door, his teeth were in danger of being shattered by the rim of the heavy bottle, and he was folded in two like a paper doll, but he didn’t care.
“But that was years ago. She married another fellow. The jilted one graduated and became a doctor. Sir Adrian went on to get his eyeful somewhere else. Water under the bridge.”
“This is just the beginning, love. I’m gonna suck you and fuck you and take such bloody good care of you.”

“So good,” murmured Sherlock, collapsing onto John, sticky with sweat and panting in little gasps. “So full.”
Violeta accepted Doctor Watson’s invitation to breakfast on the condition Lomax tell her the whole story. Holmes joined them, and the details of the case was recounted.
I rallied on the final day of the month and invited Sherlock and Doctor Watson to dine with me at the club. We ate early but feasted handsomely. It was very late when I finally bundled them into a hansom cab, fill to their hat brims of our cellar’s finest vintage port, and sent them on their way.
“—and live happily ever after. ‘Amaryllis’ meaning pride, timidity,” Watson harrumphed, “and splendid beauty.”
As I neared it, I realised that the whole thing had been reassembled with bits of wire and string; it was set atop a carpet of rose petals and leaves.
“Holmes, all of the doctors you consulted, including this one,” I tapped my chest, “say you require immediate rest to avoid serious damage to your health.”
“There are no stupid questions, my girl, except ‘What’s that burning?’ The answer is always ‘curtains.’”
The question was whispered in Lestrade’s ear while they continued to watch the crowd milling about the stalls of mulled wine, fir trees, and baked sweets.
“Not a bit of it.” Molly laughed, then she gasped. “Don’t make me laugh.” She groaned, and her forehead fell forward to rest at the base of Seb’s neck. “Oh.”
“Okay. Those burns to your fingers,” John glanced at one of Sherlock’s bandaged hands, “must’ve somehow fried that supercomputer brain of yours or else my technique tonight leaves
A sailor. A mutineer. A marooned castaway. A sailor again, now, captain of his own vessel, which stretched the width of his arms and length of his body.
“So you see, John, glitter is almost invisible. You had no idea when you kissed me that night that there was anything on my skin.”
“Absolutely not!” Mycroft cried indignantly. “I don’t want to know anything about her. Now let me pass!”
Sally released the tarpaulin. “Fun’s over,” she said with a pout. “What do you say to a drink to celebrate the best Halloween prank ever?”
Not real stars, of course, not even New Year’s Eve pyrotechnics. These were horizontal flashes of bright pink against darker pink, the inside of Sherlock’s own eyelids, the result of muscles and nerves and penetrating light, a normal biological process.
John’s eyes traveled up and down Sherlock’s body, admiring the purple nightgown as well as the body it sheathed.
“I don’t know how you knew about Afghanistan, but then there must be fairies all over. Jezail bullet shattered my shoulder. Enteric fever shattered the rest of me. Can’t sleep. Don’t want to eat. But you? You taste like medicine, and not the medicine that I am, that I was, that is, licensed to prescribe, but the kind that Mama used to simmer on the stove, not my Mama, of course, God rest her soul, but others, or so I’m told. I don’t know if I need a home remedy, but I do know I need a spot of the needful if I want to sleep somewhere other than the gutter tonight. I suppose getting my picture painted put ideas into my head. It also put a couple of coins in my palm. I went out last night and had a bit of a flutter. Put everything the painter-fellow gave me, plus everything the British government has seen fit to bestow on my poor broken carcass on red-22. Well, that went about as well as expected. There. That’s the last of my worldly possessions. And to the broker’s it goes, if I want to have another dance with you.” I opened the watch-case and laid it beside my glass.
“I couldn’t wait.” Sherlock’s voice was raw, and John gave him credit for making a coherent statement when he was so close to the edge. “Mm?”
“I am convalescing, but I am not an invalid!” I roared, then winced at the throb, a hideous pressure behind the eye sockets, that assaulted me. “I am not a selfish lover,” I said plaintively, my tone thick with disappointment and disgust.
Sherlock slid his prick into John’s hole. He leaned forward, reached forward, and squeezed a pendulous breast.
“Evening ramble. Midnight stroll. Never know what kind of well-dressed psychopath you might bump into behind a foul-smelling skip.”
“Yeah, that, too,” said John as she buried her nose in Sherlock’s hair. “Christ, you smell good. Hey, I think I see a pair of ghosts on the ceiling.”
“A potion? Oh, that’s funny, given the time of year. Where is your broomstick? And your bubbling cauldron?”
“Then w-w-why, pray tell, after a successful first attempt, was my second one a failure? If s-s-swimming is like riding a b-b-bicycle, once you learn, you never f-f-forget.”
Sherlock knew it was a dream, not because she was a horse in a stable, but because John was wearing a dress and a hat, the latter of which resembled a green parrot meeting its demise upon her head. The tall glass in John’s gloved hand was sweating, heavy with ice, and dotted with leaves that matched the molting plumage at her crown.
“Thick. And he might like his pleasure, well, a bit rough. When he sees your handsome cleft on display and feels, oh, goodness, feels how hot and tight and sweet your hole is, he may, well, he may lose a bit of his professional demeanor. And become quite a beast, leave you somewhat mauled, bitten and scratched and squeezed and sodded to, perhaps, even quite shamefully, tearing.”
“I really don’t want to think about what might be waiting on my desk tomorrow morning,” groaned Lestrade, sliding off the stool. “People venting their disappointment on each other in unpleasant ways.”
Unicorn Kisses is what pops up when you google glitter + cocktail. It's purple and sparkly and sweet. Vodka-based.
“There will be relapses and rows and fits of temper and a host of other unpleasantries, but,” he coughed, “I put myself under your care in the matter.”
The apple is round, round like the pair of pretty buttocks on display. Sherlock licks the sweetness from his lips and red fades to pink, the faint pink that his bum still retains from the firm spanking of earlier.
Sally wiped her mouth on Irene’s inner thigh. “I know we typically keep our personal and professional lives separate, but seeing how your client ruined our rope, how about we try these,” she held up the pair of handcuffs, “for dessert?”

Hopkins strode back and forth before our crouched forms, bringing the birching rod to his palm with a slap.
“—but I finally established the code and its meaning. It was the embroidery on the handkerchief which had significance. Always a poppy. Often white—”
What followed was an exchange of copies of duplicate test results and printouts of scans and an intense debate among three.
“Yeah, tongue in the slit. Then, yeah, like that. I’ve got a problem now, your gorgeous brute of man. ‘Oh, Sebby, fix it for me?’”
Molly felt the prick-tip, squeezed her breasts, felt the gush between her fingers, and grinned, savouring the collective groan which tore through the club.
“I trace your scar with my tongue for the hundred time. I lick the valley between your breasts and whisper something patently absurd in your ear like…”

“There have been a few, Watson,” said Holmes, tapping out the ash of his pipe onto the cold hearth before settling back in his own armchair.
“I fell and, as I was righting myself, noted a scrap of paper on the ground. I would not have thought anything of it, but it bore my name.”
“What ho!” I cried as the squirmy snip of canine flesh in my arms decided to apply his carpet sponge to the Wooster chin. Here was a pup of the first order! No doubt of the breed that followed the Wooster ancestors into Agincourt! A kindly old medico had carried off the black-and-white one, but I much preferred the white-and-black one. Lounging in the second-floor oasis of Northumberland Avenue, I’d spent an afternoon hiding from aunts and daydreaming of a gentleman’s gentleman putting a crease in my blue serge, only to find Wooster’s best friend waiting for me in the lobby.
How I adore you, laid out like this for pleasure! Never was there more beautiful a wick set to flame by the dripping of a crimson taper, never so lovely a needy, whimpering, arching, writhing canvas pleading to be painted red.
“I ought to fillet you both right here, right now,” said Jim casually. “Or go old school. Decapitation.”
Sherlock wants to cheer Molly up. Sherlock/Molly. Fluff. Rating: teen. Warning for mention of pet death.
“I’m still pessimistic,” said Lestrade. “I still think we’ll have nothing to talk about, nothing in common but sexual chemistry,” his eyes lingered on Mycroft’s body for a moment too long, then he shook his head, “but both be too polite to say so, and thus, make each other miserable for no good reason, but…”
“My memory is fine! But the intimacy described is bestowed upon me by an unnamed man with a handsome moustache!”
“God, he’s good,” moaned Molly, throwing her head back against Sherlock’s shoulders. She opened her eyes and read the longing in Sherlock’s gaze.
“Stamford.” The man turned his gaze back to John. He spoke quickly. “A man’s freedom depends on you winning me that rattlesnake.”
Then Sherlock’s mouth roamed, biting and licking, until he reached the waistband, then using just tongue and lips and teeth, he pushed inside the lace.
“Great! Sherlock and I just got our invitations to the Scotland Yard Hallowe’en fancy dress orgy! Greg and I are going as the Fox and the Hound. Or maybe Lady and the Tramp. Sherlock, naturally, will be a no-show. He doesn’t go in for fancy dress.”
Irene’s hips began to roll. Molly’s, too, as she smoothed more sunscreen onto Irene’s shoulders and stomach.
Being dragged onto the balcony and being on the receiving end of two sponges, three flannels, and what might have been a piece of steel wool. John had boiled two pots of water and filled the tub and sink, but the water didn’t stay hot for long.
“Of the two of us, we both know who’s the pony, Sherlock. Lustrous mane, long legs, uncomfortable-looking hoofwear, in desperate need of reins all the time, a crop to the flanks occasionally, and…”
John took a deep breath of crisp air, noting the whiff of bonfire smoke in the distance and the heady scent of ripe fruit and fecund earth all about them.
Never ‘prick’ or ‘cock,’ and in one unguarded moment, Sherlock had confessed he thought those words woefully inadequate for John’s member. Or members.
It had to be Sherlock’s mouth, John thought logically, but at the same time it wasn’t behaving as Sherlock’s mouth usually did in this scenario.
“I bought it off little Jacky Ferguson. He needed the money more than he needed a blow dart pipe. Don’t worry. It’s not curare. Now stand still.”
“I mean, good, until Watson’s crying, tears rolling down his were-puppy face. And Holmes is just walking around with this big, honking prick you could bend a poker ‘round. I mean, he’s getting off on this weeping willow act.”
Jim snorted. “He’s no judge. The last pussy he saw was four decades ago when he was evacuating the womb!”
“Getting my arse eaten like an all-you-can buffet? No, he’s so good. Come on, fill me up, so you can enjoy it proper.”
But it is something wicked enough to inspire folding me over the arm of the Baker Street settee, sodding me to bleeding, then fellating me to screaming, yes, screaming, at two o’ clock in the afternoon.
“Ah, yes, one can barely see—or smell—it. Hmm. And with the Minister on his way, too,” mused Holmes, “but that is not my worry.”
A few moments later, Sherlock cried, “My scarf!” He wove his way back to the bar and took a quick sip.
“Yeah, but you don’t need to go running towards it on your day off,” grumbled Stella, but she leaned into Sally’s mouth and hummed and let her hand curl ‘round ‘til it cupped Sally’s arse.
“Some say poor Maldahyde Simple is buried here, and some say she is not buried at all. She was lovely. A very lovely young girl. She had a friend, a bosom friend. They were inseparable. Then the other girl’s family moved to London, and Maldahyde could not be consoled. They said it was an accident. The duckweed was known to be very thick. It had been reported to have strangled even the rare goose that made the mistake of sojourning in Miller’s Pond. They say she haunts that spot of the road on moonlight autumn nights, luring the curious to—and into—Miller’s pond. They say if you are brave enough to dive in after her, then your wish is granted.”
Moriarty visits Sherlock. Sheriarty. Hate sex. The dialogue is lifted from the 1945 Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes film "The Woman in Green."
“For me? Wait, Sherlock, is that Greg’s jumper? The one he was wearing? The one I said was bloody perfect?”
But really, as metaphors went, sea anemone was more appropriate, a dozen tentacles that could collapse together to enter Sherlock, as they just had, but once inside could—
John laughed. “Seeing as how we might be spending a heat together, that would be a bit rude, don’t you think?”
John tore off the blindfold and realised he was perched on the arms of the gargantuan armchair. He climbed down awkwardly and mirrored Sherlock’s pose.
Sherlock’s supercomputer brain went offline at the first touch of those lips. He leaned forward and caressed the soft brown fur and fucked the hole and the mouth within the hole.
It was an erotic dream: this brilliant, beautiful, impossibly elegant man crumpled in what must be a ghastly uncomfortable position just so he could suck John’s cock at the precise angle that resulted in John swearing like a sailor and coming like a schoolboy—at the same time.
“You’d better come in those fancy duds, but you’d better not get caught, and when I return tomorrow evening, I want your soiled pants, turned inside out, on the bed for inspection and play.”
That’s when he met the other toff, a younger brother of the first, who’d been messing about in some kind home laboratory. When the smoke cleared, the mad scientist had rattled off John’s life story as if it were an episode of East Enders and then explained, in wondrous detail, how he figured it all out.
“I was about to implore you to allow me to make a counter offer. The salary and benefits I could match but my schedule—” He shrugged, then he looked at her. “My dear, I will be lost without you, but I wish you the best. All of it. And if you require anything, anything at all, please don’t hesitate. The door will always be open—”
“You and Mister Holmes are going directly on a week’s holiday,” announced Mrs. Hudson, waving the barrel of the gun at the two trunks stacked by the door, “to a lovely seaside inn run by cousin, and you’ll sort your differences and return as gentlemen or you’ll be finding another address.”
“At the centre of the garden is a fountain of pink glass. Flasks, bowls, test tubes, all manner of vessels for chemical researches. The fountain sits in a stream around which animals wander. There are creatures from other lands: giraffe, monkey, porcupine, lion, elephant. Cats and dogs, too. All manner of birds, great and small. And a swarm of bees.”
But after two months of moments, the door was wide open. As John washed his hands, there was a dark flutter, a slam. He stared at Sherlock’s bedroom door and ignored the throb of his own prick.
I still spent most of my waking hours reading, novels, newspapers, even, with Mister Holmes’s permission, maps I found in his eccentric and ever-expanding library, but now I elected to do most of my reading in an armchair before the sitting room hearth rather than in the quarantined privacy of my bedroom.
“No, we are not stupid, Sebby. That’s why we use safewords, carefully negotiated boundaries, the whole lot. Exquisite aftercare.”
The bin that shielded them from the street was a mountain of rubbish, piled high to spilling, its malodorous contents scattered all about them.
“No, no, I’m quite all right here. It’s just…” Grodman frowned at the squares of dainty blue cornflowers and sweet yellow daisies, then shrugged.
“This is a compromise,” Sally added, running her hands over the gold and black brocade around Janine’s waist. “Antique torture device for you; bare tits and muff for me.” She bent her head, giving each nipple a lick.
“It is a lovely scene, Doctor,” added Mrs. Hudson, who seemed to be beaming approvingly at both of them.
When they’d finished eating, Holmes dug his surprise out of the debris on his desk. He held it in his hand, then strode to Watson’s side and placed it beside him on the table.
“Blew the fuse, eh? It happens. Well, it’s been a pleasure, Sherlock,” said the puff of smoke as it snaked towards, then through, the door. “Let’s see. To continue this little game of ours, I need a human host. Oh, look, that slob from IT. He’ll do.”
But Moriarty will not cease his campaign. I can elude him for only so long, and then we must confront one another directly. O, that he was any other criminal, clever, but petty!
“And that,” said Holmes, “was her fatal mistake. If she’d caught as many criminals as you, or I, have, Mister Grodman, she’d have known better. You killed her. Maybe Constant was an experiment to prove that you could commit the perfect murder, but Mrs. Turner’s death made you
“No sudden movements, Doctor,” said Holmes with more fear than censure in his tone. I leaned forward. He rubbed my back soothingly and brushed his lips to my temple.
It is a soft, long sigh, drawn out to the rhythm of my pleasure’s cresting and by the time my air is expelled and my lips are, once more, pressed together as country-inn censor, I have spent myself inside him, further proof, if one was needed, that this is not just an indulgence of his.
When Holmes was secured to the rings, the boss began to tease his cock anew. And it was clear from the silly grins on the mugs of guest and host that they were in their element.
“Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old,” said Mycroft as he stroked Sherlock’s hair. Then he unbuttoned his cuffs and let his shirt fall to the floor.
“This’s worth every minute of the boring, useless, twelve-hour stakeout I just finished. You’re my hero.”
“Oh, c’mon. That was very chaste.” John licked his lips. “You taste funny, Sherlock. Sweet. Are you wearing make-up?”
Post-Three Garridebs. That ol' hoary chestnut 'As you've been clipped in the wanking arm by a nefarious counterfeiter, might I lend a hand?'
“Your loss,” said Sherlock. He smiled and added, “Dear.” Then he crammed the gooey confection into his mouth.
In a flash, Sherlock had shrugged out of his wings and crossed the seat. He was on his knees. His face was buried in the front of Mycroft’s trousers. “Let me have it, let me have it.”
“I don’t usually witness you being a good Samaritan. You, you know, blew that one old lady up, the blind one.”
The clerk turned pink. “We receive a good number of donations, especially this time of year, there are quite a few bequests when members….” He waved a hand. “This book appears to be among a set accepted very recently without our usual careful examination and cataloguing. Such a subject matter is not appropriate for this establishment.”
“No guessing required. Despite his black silk mask, the way he held himself gave away his military training. The way he tied rope gave away his profession. His suntan gave away his former environs. His new clothes were from London, and his lip bore traces of an adhesive used in theatre circles for applying a false moustache, which I presumed he wore to disguise his identity when he wasn’t about his nefarious business. I can’t blame him. The dreary life of a small, unprofitable medical practice can’t hold a candle to the glamour of highway robbery.”
The smile, the teasing tone boded well, but Mycroft quickly squashed the flutter of hope in his chest.
Sherlock exhaled a ragged breath. “That. Was. Foul,” he panted. He looked down. “Mustn’t do this too often. It’s detrimental to the wardrobe. My scarf’s in tatters! Musgrave?”
I hit ‘enter’ and looked away from the bloody screen, and when I’d done rubbing my eyes, he was there, standing in the doorway of my office, tall, lean, with ginger hair he probably called ‘auburn,’ wearing a bespoke suit that fit him like a glove, holding an umbrella that could kill me seven ways from Sunday, and looking like a cocktail I couldn’t possibly pronounce, much less afford.
“Thanks. Sherlock was livid when he saw Jim’s suit. He fancies himself the most well-dressed werewolf in London and when I praised the Westwood, it got ugly. I swear, if geniuses weren’t so difficult to shop for…”
Sherlock wore large, white feather wings and not much else. Deftly affixed to his head was a laurel crown, and gold glitter covered much of his exposed skin. There were gold pants and gold heeled shoes, and Sherlock’s eight appendages were the veins of the wings, flapping slowly and then folding behind Sherlock when the crowd was thick.
The rumble in the distance was the noise she’d be listening for since four o’ clock in the morning, and no amount of cleaning or primping—herself or the cottage—had completely distracted her straining ears.
He circled one nipple, then the other, with the ice, then bent forward and enveloped each bud in the wet heat of his mouth.
John left the door to the loo cracked. A shadow appeared on the floorboards, then fled as soon as he flushed the toilet.
“Come for her, John,” urged Lestrade. “Then you both can fuck me with the vibrator ‘til I weep. Then…”
“Two suicides, an accidental drowning, and a drugs overdose. All, in fact, murders. There was a failed attempt on Doctor Walters’s life last night.”
In a Star Trek-esque world, Lestrade and Mystrade find themselves with a shared secret. AU. Masturbation.
“Come on,” he cooed. “Come up and play. Come out and be played with. Don’t you want to be sucked?” He began to pepper kisses about the growing bulge in the thick fabric. “That’s it. Oh, God, I need your prick, John.”
“My hands shook!” cried Watson. “That’s why there was too much pepper in the eggs this morning.” He held out the culprits, palms up, and added gloomily, “If you haven’t deduced it by now.”
John’s head was hidden by the short yellow-and-black skirt. He was nuzzling and licking the pair of tiny black knickers stretched across Sherlock’s erection.
better make it good.” John lifted and squeezed Lestrade’s heavy breasts, thumbing the nipples, then bringing one to her mouth to suck. She released it, and Lestrade groaned. John sucked the other, then said, “Sherlock’s caught you quite a few killers this year. You should show some gratitude.”
Molly curled one arm round his neck when he slid up her body. She extended the other one out towards Jim.
With my vision adjusted to the dimness of the hour, I distinguished the shadowy lines of Holmes’s body and the bedding around us. Our lovemaking had wrinkled the latter, but I entertained the fleeting notion that it had smoothed Holmes’s form into a utopia of rolling hills and valleys and crests and forests and chiseled cliffs.
Sally threw her head back. “Fuck! You’re going to find that pearl because you’re a fucking genius at finding things. Like that.”
Sherlock slammed into John, pushing him further upon the counter. John tightened his grip on Sherlock, legs and arms clinging.
After that, it was a matter of cleaning up and carrying away. Holmes and I watched Lestrade and his men escort Alphonse Unworthy to the door, shackled, and convey Angus Unworthy beneath a white sheet on a gurney.
He settled his large frame in the centre of the settee just as Holmes bid with a flourish of his elegant hand.
“Oh, for goodness sake!” I cried and sprang from my chair, closing the distance between us with one stride, then snatching the fruit from Watson’s hand.
, which is a thank you gift to all my lovely Molliarty readers and will be going up in bits and pieces this week.
Then I climbed atop table and sleuth and finished the job. My prick finally found Holmes's sweet spot, the brushing of which sent him into struck-by-lightning spasms, and I finally bestowed my upmost admiration in the form of pissing streams of seed deep inside his stretched cavity.
That’s a good one. Takes the edge off me first, so I am not distracted by my own urges when I’m bringing you, over and over, to the brink. And you do beg so prettily.
Then they’re kissing. Like two mixed-up kids who have finally found something that makes sense in the world.
Marie paused a moment to admire the beauty of the advancing of day and the retreating of night, and the handsome background it made for the stately trees which stood in a line like veterans of her father’s war and greeted the day as if it were a wealthy widow. For the first time, Marie wished for some artistic bent that she might render the scene in paint. A mist covered the ground, sending up wispy grey tendrils which smudged the canvas.
Holmes strode closer, crowding me, until my back was to the wall. “We have one at Baker Street. It’s only proper we should have one here,” he said huskily. “Shall we christen it now?”
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock nodded. Then he added softly, “It was extremely thoughtful of you, John.”
The transformation was beautiful, as beautiful as an old building—or a bastard who thought himself clever—crumpling in the dust.
The revelers were still at their merry-making when our hansom cab began its slow return to Baker Street.
“Yes!” cried John with delight as he held up a white cake box tied with pink ribbon. “Come on, Sherlock, let’s celebrate.”
Lestrade turned round and undid his trousers and lowered them. He held up his shirttails and wigged his arse. “Thank you for my pants. I confess I thought it was just one of Sherlock’s jokes but then he wouldn’t have had your business card, would he?”
That couldn’t be right, of course, but it had been over that first cup of tea that Marie had mentioned her old blue one, and then the next day, Martha had told her about that sample sale, and they’d gone together. Martha had such a good eye for colour. She’d done most of the selecting.
I will place this missive on the bedside table, very much as you did yours so many years ago, beneath your silver cigarette-case.
Sherlock lowers himself to the settee and reclines. He opens his trousers. “The heat makes you incredibly horny.”
“What if we put all our eggs in a really big basket and then, you know, took some time off and had a nice Easter holiday?”
Not very smutty, actually. Flashbacks. Consent issues because of drug use and unintentional drugging.
“Indeed, I wouldn’t. Shall I forgive you for ensconcing my bedraggled form before a roaring fire, pardon you for filling my belly with first-rate duck, and fussing about me with blankets and toddies in much the fashion of a mother hen?”
As the doors closed, John longed to be as invisible in body as she was in spirit. She took a deep breath, the precursor to a self-pitying sigh, then started violently.
The fingers inside Molly’s knickers had rubbed her bush; the tiny skulls atop Molly’s black skirt imitated the gesture.
Lestrade’s blood warmed at the undisguised flirtation in Mycroft’s eyes. He lowered his voice and twisted on the stool. “I’ve been thinking of you,” he said quickly.
The cabman took them to 321 Baker Street and, after much argument that there were no residences at 221, left them there. They tottered the remaining distance on foot, but their fury and indignation turned to astonishment when they saw where once their residence had been, a piano store and a place of worship, from which a few devotees of a highly evangelical nature were issuing. Once they managed to disentangle themselves from a crusade to help them ‘see the light,’ they walked to the Savoy and took a room for the night. In the morning, they returned and found their residence as they knew it to be. They received a warm greeting from their landlady.
He liked the way it filled his mouth, tickled the back of his throat, brushed the top of his palate. He liked the way it spread his lips. He liked swirling his tongue ‘round it, mapping the veins and ridges and changes of texture. He liked the taste of it.
“Very well.” A third tin, the last in the house Holmes deducedd with relief, bounced off his shoulder. ““But those plants should know I mean business!”
She ate chocolate after chocolate. Then, with that sweet rich flavour in her mouth, she pushed the Malacca shaft inside her, testing how deep the curve of the handle and the curve of her body would allow.  It was perfect, smooth and hard. The folded silk of the umbrella canopy rustled as she began fucking herself in earnest.
Sherlock pulled off and spit into the cambric. “Thank you,” he mumbled before sitting back on his heels.
Seb watched the waves without thinking about much of anything. Then he took a deep breath of briny air and was pleased that it finally no longer hurt to do so. He looked over, meeting a green-eyed gaze that missed nothing, and smiled.
Dawn broke golden on the horizon, and the glow, in two shades of yellow, seemed to push the night into the firmament, shaping it into thick, cottony balls of dark blue.
At this, Grodman’s face lost a bit of its rubicund tint. He absentmindedly extended a hand to his side, but when his fingers brushed the quilt, he drew them back as if scalded.
“Mycroft, wait! Please come in. I apologise for presuming you were here on business other than your own. You’d hardly pay a visit for one of Sherlock’s emergencies. I’ve enough food for two if you’d care to join me for dinner.”
She is parasite. John is host. It behooves her to keep John’s circulation running swiftly and smoothly and, yes, warmly, for as long as possible.
“Thank you.” Lomax waited but when Lestrade simply returned his smile, he prompted, “Do you require assistance, Inspector?”
“Yes. For what it’s worth, I’m sterile, too, so, it’s not a genuine concern for either of us. We can build brood-castles in the sky together!”
“The colours are intriguing,” admitted Holmes. “but Watson will tell you that my thoughts on modern art are very crude.”
He suddenly pictured the silly bit of whipped cream on the top of the drink. Cream could be put to so much better uses.
A County Clare Cooler is Irish whiskey, apple cider, lemon juice, wildflower honey syrup, Benedictine, and ginger beer.
Seb said it without even knowing if Jim would do it, but sure enough, Jim was peeling down Seb’s shorts and spreading Seb’s legs and shoving his face underneath Seb.
“Then it’s my turn,” said John with a wicked grin. He and Lestrade exchanged places, so that John might stand before Sherlock, who was on his knees, sucking each prick as it presented itself.
John drained his glass and smiled at Sherlock, who was fussing with the lapel of his own dressing gown, which was, indeed, identical to the one John wore, save for a thin vertical stripe.
Mycroft pushed away from his desk and stood and went to the far cabinet. A key, a lock, a twist and turn later and he was allowing the first draught of whiskey to warm his throat.
I hummed appreciatively, and not just at the whiff of his posh cologne I caught when I stood and went to the door to close it. I returned to his side and loomed over him and the trove nested in cotton.
But Sherlock had very much enjoyed getting manhandled. It was rare these days that John got his riled up, to the point of physically assault Sherlock.
She didn’t take her eyes from his as she pushed in, pausing every so often to study his expression, which never changed.
Harry made a noise of protest, but Clara pulled on the lead, more gently than Harry had, and John sat up.
John didn’t know where the slick came from. As far as he knew, Sherlock was only wearing a towel. There must’ve been some somewhere, or a good proxy, because Sherlock’s hands was soon smoothly stroking John’s cock to a full erection.
Jim tossed the crop aside and began to fuck Seb’s mouth with the same rhythm and roughness that Molly was using on his hole.
John stepped his boots farther apart, leaned farther back against the treat, held up the front of the kilt, and coated his cock from base to head with overlapping strokes.
“I staged a fight between us. Then I hid you in a dirty linen hamper until I could get a car and bring you home. Toby’s a good watchcat.”
“Elementary,” he replied cryptically, then proceeded to spin the sweetest, most palliative melody with his fiddle and bow.
Lestrade was licking from Mycroft’s left nipple to the ridge of his shoulder. Then he covered Mycroft’s body with his once more and ground his hips into Mycroft’s. He sank his teeth gently into Mycroft’s skin and groaned. He licked, then bit, at Mycroft’s neck, then the tip of his chin, then his lower lip. Then he sat up and removed his dress shirt.
He turned, but not before I caught a faint, body-length tremour momentarily wrinkling the dressing gown silk.
“You’ve been hurting for a long time, Holmes. I wanted to help you lay the pain of Openshaw to rest once and for all. And conventional measures or advice seem utterly ridiculous. But if it changes anything, I did not pay them to lose. I merely paid them not to kill you. Please,” he said, tenderly brushing Holmes's hair from his face, “you were human. It was a tragedy. And so it goes.”
“Oh, you must have me confused with an ordinary, boring Alpha, the kind that takes one whiff of an Omega pre-heat and drops his trousers. Need I remind you that ‘the Machine’ at the height of his popularity was servicing no fewer than three Omegas at a time. Not once was I even tempted to bite a neck.”
“The next is no garden at all. It is a village on fire at night. And all the Watsons are in torment. Serpent creatures. Nails. Pins. Forks and swords and arrows. And a boar in a nun’s habit is forcing itself upon Watson.”
Sherlock’s belt unfastened and his trousers opened. He groaned again. His clothes and underclothes parted and his cock sprang free.
Molly sank her finger in dark hair and turned her head. She kissed Jim’s mouth. Wet, open, sloppy lips slid against each other while Seb supported Molly’s torso with his hands. He bent his head to kiss her breasts.
Holmes had chanced upon the set in a shop in Bond Street when he’d gone to London to see the rheumatism specialist. It was the same pattern that Watson had described, in loving detail, as belonging to his grandmother.
Perineum sunning is on the agenda of the outdoor couples' retreat. Johnlock. No smut. Crack. Not even slash, really. Rating: Teen. Dialogue-mostly.
“Just getting started, Boss,” said Seb before he took the now-fully erect cock in his mouth and sucked.
The proper words. The proper herbs. The proper order of things. The proper flick of a proper whip to a tender spot. The proper flick of a proper tip of a tongue to the back of knee.
Sherlock’s head was swimming. Just before he latched on the other nipple, he found the wherewithal to ask,
John can't take his eyes off the art model posing as Saint Sebastian. Johnlock. Alt First Meeting. Meet-cute. No smut.
Sherlock slipped into the closet and slipped to the floor and slipped his mouth over John’s very erect prick.
“This calls for action,” said Irene. She tapped her mobile. “It’s the longest night of the year, not the most disappointing.”
The cabin door burst open, and a half ton of snow and one half-frozen Detective Inspector tumbled into the room.
Lucozade is a UK sports drink. I think like Gatorade, though my knowledgeable readers can educate me on that point.
Sherlock pulled off and said petulantly, “My royal jelly! I’m queen!” His crown shook, and his golden antenna bobbed.
“I’m quite all right,” I reassured him, touching my face and confirming that my own eyebrows were still attached.
“Looks better on you,” said Sally before throwing one end of the gold sparkly strand over Stella’s bare shoulder. She reached up and held Stella’s head and brought her lips to Stella’s for a long, wet kiss that had them rolling on the floor, wrapped in each other’s limbs.
I wallowed in fantasy until Mrs. Hudson’s arrival. Her countenance and her muttering told me that she, too, was still contemplating of the possibility of Holmes’s acquisition of a new skill.
“How’s your brother?” he asked, making a beeline for the small box on the table he knew had been waiting for him.
Author's Note: I put on my best Watson aura and used an online tarot reading service and got three cards. I used the parts of the interpretation which best fit the story. For the LJ Holmes Minor monthly prompt: card.
“Nonsense. Maximum capacity for this space is 625. Fire codes won’t let it go to a thousand. Do you want me to come for you right here? I will, you know.”
Sherlock arched his back away from the tiles as his cock hardened, then began to leak. His eyes rolled back into his head; his head rolled back and forth on the floor. His jaw dropped, his tongue lolled, and he moaned.
“And I’m thinking I’ll place another order with Sherlock. Given Love Potion No. 9 just got me a spectacular first kiss, I wonder what'll happen with Love Potion No. 10?”
