Steve opened his mouth to protest, and Stark invaded it instead, all the fingers of his hand pressed together in a wedge, forcing his mouth open, thrusting into it in counterpoint to his cock. Steve wanted to bite down, but he couldn't seem to coordinate his muscle movements. The fingers tasted of oil, artificial and mineraly, and the taste coated his tongue as it jabbed in and out.
Stark's unnatural stillness, not even a twitch, a gasp, as the scepter was plunged through his torso, driven with a superhuman strength.
The material was rigid, and unforgiving. It felt huge and foreign in his ass, but then Stark said, "Would you look at that. The tiniest one, and he's already struggling," and Steve choked into his gag. "What a tight little ass. I'm going to have a good time breaking it in."
Shaking too hard to pull himself to his knees, Steve only lay in a trembling heap, pulse hammering in his throat. He already knew his place, hadn't he already demonstrated it by submitting to this dehumanizing treatment, with hardly a protest?
"I was starting to think you had a fixation with my butt," he said dryly, to mask his growing nervousness. He tested the bonds, and didn't find much give at all. At least his legs were free, he thought, and tried to to find a position that would afford him some privacy.
Note about Major Character Death archive warning: In this chapter, Tony is "left for dead", so I added the warning to be safe. It tickled me that, after writing 30+ whump prompts for poor Steve, I managed to get Tony with the last one :D
Coming over to Steve with his selection, Stark pinned the phone between his ear and shoulder, freeing his hand to stroke Steve's lips, first with the back of his thumb, then with the fat plug.
After stomping a few circles around the room, he came back to the box, and inspected its contents again. They were really very... detailed.
Fury at himself, for trying so desperately to appease his captor, only to end up right where he had been dreading all along. He'd given up so much, debased himself willingly, just so he'd never end up here again, but here he was anyway.
Even if he could get out there, where would he go? Everyone he had known might well be dead by now, past the limits of a mortal lifespan.
Then he remembered who that so-called underdog was, and his thoughts short-circuited. He owed Stark nothing, except to get away from him, take back the life that had been stolen from him.
"I pulled you out of the ice once, and believe me, it wasn't cheap. If I think you've learned your lesson, I'll get you out of here again. But believe me when I tell you this—I will
Disgusted, he tried to keep his eyes open for the cleaning, but he never even felt her set down his arm.
Eventually the arrows led through an open door, which opened into a spacious room. There was a huge, four-poster bed taking prominence, and heavy shades blotting out the windows, so he still couldn't tell the time of day.
The matter-of-fact way Stark described this to a third party chilled him to the bone. Was the future really a world in which humans could be imprisoned and enslaved like this? What had all their fighting been for?
Every time he forgot, every time he clenched, or moved restlessly within the limited confines available to him, the plug was quick to reassert its presence. He was sure that if he bucked against it, ground into the corner that his ass was fetched up against, he could very quickly lose himself in that heady sensation.
Steve looked up to see that the timer had followed him out here, and was still counting down. Weakly, he struggled upwards. It took him 15 seconds just to get to his hands and knees again, limbs at any moment feeling like they might deposit him back on the ground, but Jarvis mercifully seemed to count it as progress, as the timer reset.
Groaning, Steve clenched around the intrusion, and felt it shift inside him. He had never felt so...
Steve yanked his fingers out of his ass like she might not have noticed them yet, horror and shame drawing a corresponding blush to him, all over his naked body.
He clamped a hand over the bleeding wound, stiff shoulders barely registering a protest against the millions of other aches in his body.
Sighing, the man pushed Steve's face off of his crotch, and backed up. His penis emerged like a magic trick, and flicked Steve in the nose, leaving a string of his own saliva.
. A steady, regular beep pulsed somewhere near his head, and made him repeatedly wince. A number of bodies bustled around him—nurses?—some calling loudly, others pushing carts or carrying trays loaded with clattering metal instruments.
Wracked with pain, delirious, Steve had no concept of time passing. Just an eternity of agony, before the lights abruptly snapped off, and the assault ceased, mid-thrust.
They didn't look like a family unit, but they treated the space, and each other, with an ease that spoke of well-worn familiarity.
Clint had resumed fucking his ass, and he had never felt so stuffed full at both ends, like he could just burst, but he had to endure it. He couldn't fight. He couldn't resist, that would only bring pain and suffering.
"Ahh," said the voice in his head, and he finally realized it wasn't anyone in the room who had given that order, but a figment of his broken mind. "There it is. Poor, simple Stark. Can't help but think of the location as soon as you're queried, can you?"
This resolution wavered, when a new arm came out, thicker, with a longer, wider cock on the end. Was it going to up the size every time he came?
"On your hands and knees," Stark said. "Should've mentioned that too, huh? Jarvis will zap you if you try to get up, if you try to go the wrong way, if you hesitate more than, oh, let's say, thirty seconds."
A beautiful woman came into view, shoulders back to display a perfect, shapely set of naked breasts, her hips similarly angled to show off a prominent strap-on penis, in bright purple, still shiny with lube. Steve's ass clenched at the realization of what had been inside of him.
But that she had a cock of her own, even a plastic one—his modesty didn't know what to make of that.
Steve wasn't far gone enough that he couldn't feel shame and horror. That his body would be subjected to this was one thing. The idea that his reputation could go through the same treatment was more than he could bear. "Don't," he croaked, "Stark, please don't, I'm begging you."
"Utter nonsense. That's your body tricking you. It's just an illusion." The voice settled in around his head, curling around it like an animal. "Cold doesn't
But Stark didn't care to use his mouth, only pushed all the way down, and all Steve had to do was focus on not gagging as Stark began to roughly fuck his throat.
The pressure finally eased, and he gasped in air, choking and coughing, never letting go of his hands.
"Lucky thing," said Stark, but not to Steve. "I thought he was going to be a wreck, if we ever found him. If I hadn't liked the looks of him, I was going to have him pay off his debt as a lab rat, down in R&D. But with that performance, I'd say he's worth keeping."
Maybe he'd been warped from his time with Stark, but somehow the sound went straight to his own dick. Something about the idea of doing this to Loki with his mouth. That such a powerful being, maybe even a god, was being unraveled by his lips, his tongue, made Steve suck harder, greedily milking the cock for its spend.
But fighting back was equally unthinkable. Whatever he thought he'd suffered so far, he was now convinced that Stark could always come up with worse. Genius ran in the family, it seemed, but in different directions.
"You don't have to do this, Jarvis," Steve said, hoarsely, when he could. "You don't have to follow his orders, please. Are you a captive too? I'll help you, please."
Steve wanted to prove him wrong, but his body had been through so much abuse in such few days, and practically begged him to comply. Shakily, he leaned over and fumbled in the indicated drawer with his bound wrists. The closest thing he could find to a gag was a short length of leather strap—which, as he pulled it out, turned out to be two lengths of strap, joined in the middle by a silver ring, about the size of a pried-opened mouth.
He sobbed in pain, begging incoherent even if it weren't muffled by the mattress. He couldn't go through another session with this thing, not after being raped all evening. But the door slammed behind him, and he knew Stark hadn't even bothered to stay to watch the punishment, just deposited him here like a misbehaving child and left him to the care of his robot.
Nat came over to Steve with the blindfold, and smiled down at him. The cupid's bow of her lips was plush and full, redder than anything he'd ever seen. She could have been a pin-up model, except for the artificial dick bobbing from her hips, a bright purple monstrosity hovering right in front of his face.
"You're sick," Steve said, but he doubted that this was news to anyone watching: himself, Jarvis, or Stark himself, for that matter. Stark stepped back and let Steve wear himself out, thrashing against his cuffs. The cage that had held him inside for an eternity now held him equally firmly from beneath.
The next time he woke, there was a wooden box waiting for him, carved with the same "Property of..." tag that Steve bore on his skin. He lifted the lid with some trepidation, to find an array of familiar-looking toys, neatly numbered from 1-10, and sized accordingly. They were arranged on soft felt, each nestled into an indent formed exactly to its shape. There was a even a bottle of lube tucked thoughtfully into the corner.
Eventually he'd be so fucked out that he wouldn't be able to come anymore, he thought, in one of his rare moments of clarity, after another orgasm had been wrenched from him. His ass was getting incredibly sore, and the thing inside him hurt so badly, he couldn't even imagine being aroused by it. There was nothing left in him to ejaculate. He was sure he'd make this time, he just had to put up with the pain.
The sound of the door startled Steve's eyes open. "Wait!" he cried. "The collar? You said you'd take it off. Stark, please."
"Electro-whip. It's a little Star Wars, but useful. Discipline your slave without impairing their functionality. That could be a marketing thing. Jarvis, write that down."
Another arm that ended in something like the nipple of a baby bottle began to caress him, groping the crease made by his joined legs, his trapped cock, his ass crack, trailing lubricant as it went. When it reached his entrance, it began to coat him with the substance there, dabbing with all the delicacy of a steam engine. Steve's hands jerked in an abortive attempt to fend off the touch, and more mechanical arms came out, chirring and squealing, to hold them down, as if the rope weren't enough.
"Put them behind your back. Lace your fingers. Good. Keep them clasped like that, and don't let go, no matter what. There's a good boy."
When Loki walked off, Steve daringly got onto his own feet as well. He'd been ordered to kneel, forced when it hadn't been quickly enough, but he'd never been told to stay knelt. He half expected to be knocked back down to his hands and knees, but Loki just shot him a sardonic smirk over his shoulder, and continued to lead the way, lighting up the halls with the cool, blue glow of his scepter, until the two of them came back to Stark's room, and stood in its doorway.
Without warning, the hard length slid out of Steve's ass. He hadn't felt it going in, but it was an uncomfortable scrape on its way out, leaving him cold and empty.
It was three or four days before he saw Stark again, almost long enough to start carving a tally into the wall, if he had been in any state of mind to care to keep track.
Stark's palm fell on said ass with a clap, kneading it possessively. After all that had been done to him, it should have felt tame, but Steve still grunted and tried futilely to squirm away.
Just when he was about to lose consciousness, Stark snapped the fingers of his gauntlets, and the collar slackened. Steve rolled over, gasping, coughing, sucking in shaking, eager lungfuls of air.
The index-finger flashlight pointed itself at Steve's hand, and a laser shot out. It began to swivel freely, inscribing on the web between Steve's thumb and forefinger, in typewriter-neat block letters, "PROPERTY OF A. E. S." Against all the other pain, it was hardly more than a sting, but when Steve drew his hand back, he still felt like he'd had the breath knocked out of him. When he put his hand back on the floor, bracing himself for what was next, he couldn't stop looking at the text that had been indelibly etched onto his body.
He hobbled to his feet, the room spinning around him, and staggered his way to the door, all but slamming into it. Worked the doorknob behind his back with bound hands—Stark didn't even bother to lock it anymore—and then lurched out into the equally dark hallway.
"Only on my shifts," she said, putting on her gloves, and the plural made Steve's stomach sink. Multiple shifts, which meant he'd been kept here for days at least, drifting in and out of consciousness as his body was used, visited like a public john.
"Not 'Silly'," said Stark, and Steve abruptly realized that this wasn't a recording, Stark was actually responding to him. Probably watching him too, the pervert. "CILL-E. I know you've been, what's the word, bored, under-stimulated, whatever, so I sent him to play a game with you. Jarvis, put the timer back up."
He melted into it, despite himself. Don't punish me, he tried to project, with every fiber of his being. He was utterly exhausted from the terror, and the fruitless struggles, and the pain. A kind touch like this, not being hurt for just a brief moment, was all he wanted.
A nurse came by to towel his forehead, which only made him heat up more. All these women were watching him and Stark, watching him be violated by a piece of plastic and a squirt of oil, all while he knelt there, helpless as a trussed-up pig with an apple in its mouth.
Appreciate the positive feedback! It's intimidating to post this stuff, so it helps to see people are enjoying it.
There was a condom on it, that she slipped off and tossed with a flick. Then she weaved out of view, each measured step making the strap-on between her legs swing with grace and menace.
Slowly, he began to curl his knees to his chest, drawing his ankles up to his bound hands. Sweat pricked on his shoulders as he concentrated on moving with utter care, so as not to shift the bed.
"Guess that time on ice didn't mess him up too bad. Let's see how fast this engine goes." And Stark began fucking him in earnest.
When Steve was finally released from the infirmary, he went, without being told, on his hands and knees.
When he finally managed to roll over, he curled up into a fetal position, weak and nauseous and terrified beyond words. Stark was going to catch him. Stark was going to punish him. Stark had something even worse waiting up his sleeve. Stark always did.
Steve shook his head, and without warning, ice rose from the ground, with another great rippling crack. It swallowed his ankles, and when he tried to kick out against it, sent him careening forwards onto his knees after all. He caught the ground on the flat of his palms, and turned with an animal sort of desperation to pull at his feet, but they were encased in ice, so gut-wrenchingly cold on his bare skin, and it was crawling up his ankles, his knees, like a living thing.
Last month was Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, make sure you and your loved ones get checked if applicable!
“Mister Stark, May Parker and Happy have arrived. Should I ask them to come to you?” Jarvis broke the silence and Steve wondered shortly how long they had been sitting like that, for the two hours to be over already, while Tony agreed to have them come up.
He was always keeping himself busy, searching for Peter, spending time with Steve or working on something in his lab with Banner. But the days were passing and the chances on actually finding Peter alive were growing smaller and smaller. That did not mean that he would stop searching, no. Everyone still gave their best. Thor was still controlling planets, Fury gave his men up to search every secret base they had in their system and even Pepper used her suit when Morgan was in kindergarten to check out some places. They wouldn’t stop searching until they found him, dead or alive. He would not just accept that the boy was nowhere to be found.
Natasha had known all along and she knew kissing him was the worst idea because of it. Because he’d know she loved him back.
“They’re both being big asses. Look, I’m not promising we’re going to get them together. This is also a long haul project. But it definitely won’t happen if we don’t try. So you’re either in or you’re not.” She drank more of her coffee and muttered to herself, “I can’t believe I’m doing this and conspiring with a 17 year old.”
“Here you go, Cap,” Tony said cheerfully. On the coffee table in front of Steve, he set down a plate of takeout sandwiches from the restaurant around the corner from the Tower, Steve’s current favorite place to eat.
Except that Steve was not really Tony’s, was he? Tony thought he was Brock. And Steve was decidedly not Brock.
The mysterious Nick Fury appeared. “Prince Brock, I am here to announce that your wedding to Prince Tony has been postponed.”
When a quietly fuming Tony finally hung up the phone, he decided that Fergus was going down, no matter what it took. Because nothing was wrong with Steve. Ever. Especially last night when he did that thing
He closed the box and put it away in the hardest-to-reach compartment in the room. The best he could do to remove temptation. When he had time, he’d send the box back to the vault.
He wasn’t much different either from Obadiah. If he made it past the wedding, he knew that Alexander would come calling for favors from Steve. He still had Steve’s ma in his clutches.
Tony gave Sam research projects to check for multidimensional meddling, if the Squadron Supreme were plotting anything awful, if Kang was present anywhere. He trusted Sam and Sam was very very good at whatever Tony threw at him. But nothing.
At that, Tony turned and appeared to look at Steve for the first time. “We honor all who create in this court and land. Do you like art?”
The video clearly went viral because it cut off after Steve said, “I am that Steve Rogers and I know what I painted.”
True to her word, Queen Maria had assigned attendants to Steve. Jarvis and Ana were quick to get Steve into appropriate wear for the Garden party.
Tony poked at Steve’s collarbone, then ran his clever fingers down Steve’s chest. And Steve just let him. He watched in fascination as Tony flicked the zipper tag and then unzipped Steve’s uniform top. “You know what?”
Tony showed up with a huge flower bouquet. Like the biggest bunch of flowers Peter had ever seen. “Uh, Steve?” he said as he sort of sidled up to the table, not able to get closer to Steve.
“Come on, it’s been a long day for both of us. Let’s just be together tonight and the future can fuck off.”
“You and Ororo take over the evacuation. I’ll catch up to Tony and see if we can clear the building top down. I’ll send Jan your way.”
The teacher in question appeared right at that moment at the cafeteria door, looking like he’d walked right off a movie set. Peter really liked Mr. Rogers, who told interesting stories of his time in the army and how he went back to art school. At least a half dozen of Peter’s classmates had huge crushes on Rogers. Mr. Rogers was kind, patient and rather demanding for an art teacher at a tech high school, plus he was on the old side. Just like Tony.
He had no idea what to say to Tony. What could you say to a man who had lost a boy, who was like a son to him, twice already. To a man who was willing to end his own life in an intergalactic battle to safe them all. What could Steve possibly say after all of this? He had no idea.
After quietly leaving Peters room they both went back to Bucky and Nat. Sinking onto the soft couch pillows as well. “So, how’s the spider boy doing?” Bucky looked from Steve to Tony and back to Steve. “He’s well, at least from what we can see right now. He has some small wounds, which should get better soon thanks to his healing, but mentally...” Tony stopped talking. Steve took over, “he was scared?” he stopped as well, thinking about how to explain it, “when we arrived he had quite the breakdown, talking about how he had seen Tony die over and over again and when I remember correctly he also said that whoever had kidnapped him, said it was his fault that Tony hadn’t survived… He had Tony tested, asking him about something only the both of them could know before he trusted us,” Bucky and Nat were silent for a few moments. The implication of what that boy had been through hanging in the air. “Part of me wants to find the guy who kidnapped him and rip him apart and the other part knows that it’s probably not possible when not even Strange was able to locate the both of them last time,” Nat said. Anger clearly written on he face, but also worry. They were all worried. How would Peter react once he wakes up again. Will he tell them about what had happened or will he keep quiet about it?
He himself had been worried to no end after Peter had been kidnapped in space. It all went incredibly fast and no one was able to actually react before the portal closed behind them. He spent way too much time staring at cameras all over the world, hoping that one had the boy on it, yet there were many countries and even more cities. It was a losing battle.
“Peter is alive,” the words were so surreal. He looked over to Steve, finding that he was already looking back. “Where is he right now?” his head snapped back to Wilson. “Oh, he’s at my place. I got us both out of Jail and took him with me to America but I was unsure about bringing him over since he, well, he kinda seems a bit messed up, which is quite weird coming from someone who cut of his own feet like three days ago,” he laughed.
After a long hug and some more tears they finally moved apart. May gently pushed Peter down onto the couch, Tony sitting down on the other side again, right next to Steve. “What happened?” May asked and Steve retold the story about how Deadpool suddenly came and told them that he had found Peter in the Netherlands.
After Peter and Tony returned, Peter stopped in the door frame, doing the same thing with May he did with Tony not too long ago. “Tell me something only you and I can know,” he asked her. May stopped in her tracks for a few seconds, a bit confused, but complied. “When you asked that girl out to Prom, we both practiced dancing in the living room and looked like total idiots,” and seconds later she also had Peter in her arms, embracing him.
“I can’t sleep. Not when there’s a chance that he’s somewhere out there and still alive,” his voice was hoarse. The memories still to fresh in his mind and the pain of loosing the boy a second time too much. He had snapped his fingers and the battle was over, but right before the Doctor was about to open a portal for all of them to go back to earth, someone had grabbed Peter and pulled him through another portal. Eyes wide and mouth open, the last thing he had seen on the boys face before the portal had closed itself. He wasn’t even able to see who had grabbed him and Strange couldn’t find any trace in the future of him. He said something about a magical shield most likely surrounding both, the bad guy and Peter.
And like that, a month has passed. No sign from the boy. Tony had healed and searched earth himself, but he as well wasn’t able to find any clues on where the boy was.
The elevator doors opened not much later and May came in, “Believe me. If I hadn’t already let it all out back when he vanished last time, I’d rip you apart Stark!” she build herself up in front of Tony and Steve. “I’m glad to see you happy and healthy,” Tony stood up, “I’ll go wake up Peter so you can see him.”
“I’m so thankful to finally have you back,” tears were streaming down her face, but it looked like she didn’t care and everyone in the room understood. They were apart for way too long.
A bright smile forming on Peters face upon seeing Tony and Steve, taking a step into their direction, just for fear taking over a few seconds later. He took a step back again, another and another until his back was pressed against a door. His head shaking, his body as well. “No no no no no, this isn’t real. I know this isn’t real! You are dead! I saw you die!” his voice breaking and his legs giving out under him, letting him sink to the floor. Hands coming up to cover his ears. Tonys feet moved on their own, bringing him closer to the boy. “NO! Stop!” Peter nearly screamed, pain so clear in those words. “Stay away from me, I know you’re not real. You can’t hurt me,” his eyes starting to water and Tony was at a loss for words. “Hey, kiddo. I’m real, I’m here. I’m not dead…” he tried to keep his emotions down, voice gentle.
He has not been sleeping since they came back from space. From the last battle in which he nearly died from using the stones to finally bring an end to the war. At first they were all hesitant to even let him out of the medical area, but he couldn’t lean back, not when there was still no information at all.
Instead of saying anything, he grabbed Tonys hand, softly intertwining their fingers. A warm rush going through his body, their whole thing was still fresh and they haven't really had much time to explore it yet, so seeking contact was still new and intense. Tony looked up, a soft smile forming on his face and Steve felt like he was finally able to breath again since all of this had started over five years ago. Tony was alive and next to him, Peter was safe. All their shared friends slowly got used to actually living again, some easier, some not. But all of them were finally safe and the world was safe and he had been part of this war for way too many years, and he finally allowed himself to think about his own future instead of the safety of a world who was against all of them more times than happy they saved their asses.
“We all worry Tony. Hell, I can’t sleep as well, but you have to at least let your body rest...” Steve moved over, bringing his arms around his waist and holding him close. Tony leaned back into the embrace, worry lessening a bit. “We’ll find him. We have people searching space for us, we have people searching the earth for us. Even a god is currently planet-hopping looking for him,” and he was right. They would find Peter, but it was hard to just wait and not being able to do anything on his own. He totally would go take a look, but Jarvis was not allowing him to start his suit, because “Mister Stark, I am asked by Mister Rogers that I am not letting you leave in your current health situation and I have to politely agree with him.”
“Get to the point or I’ll make sure they’ll drop you off in the Netherlands again,” Tony had enough from Wades bullshit. If he had a clue about Peter he wanted it now. “Okay okay tin man!” he leaned back against the wall, facing them all once. “So, next to those fans there was a guy, still quite young and I thought, hey he shouldn’t be in jail? Not that I haven’t been at that age, but you get it. So I went over and asked what he was doing there and he was like >I have no clue< which is weird right? Not knowing why you’re at a police station. So I asked his name, since he was speaking English quite perfectly and he told me his name is Peter Parker, and I remembered reading the name one time I snug in here to get some Spaghetti,” - “You snug in?!” - “Not the point! So, I remembered the name and I was like >Oh! Do you know Tony Stark?< and he shrugged and said that he knew you, but Tony Stark was dead and he looked like he was about to burst into tears, so I told him that Tony Stark was indeed alive and suddenly he freaked out and tried to punch me, mumbling something about >Stop it! I know this isn’t real!< and yeah- I dropped the topic soon after.” he looked at Tony. Or at least Tony thought so, because the Mask was covering his face.
“Dad!” a small voice suddenly cut through the silence and a little girl came running from the elevator, right into Tonys arms. After her, much more calm, came Pepper. “It’s your turn this weekend. But-” her eyes moved to Peter and May, “-If it’s currently a bit hard to make it work, I can reschedule and you can take her another day?”
Peter looked unsure, panic so clearly written over his face, “tell me something only the real Tony Stark could know,” there was hope somewhere in his eyes and Tonys brain worked fast to find anything at all. “The first time we met, I was over at your aunts place and I asked you to come to Germany with me and you said you couldn’t because you had homework to do,” he knew that no one else was in the room at that time, so it could only be known by Peter and him.
Peter nodded. “Right, I got hit by the train and the next time I opened my eyes I was in some weird village I can’t pronounce and Wade took me back to America.” - “You got hit by  a train?!” May nearly shouted in shook, and if she wouldn’t have done it, Steve was pretty sure one of them would have in her place. “Yeah. I can’t really remember much of it, I think I was knocked out quite quickly,” he said. Shrugging. His voice was calm, way too calm for someone talking about getting hit by a train after being kidnapped. Steve had no clue what to say now. That seemed to be his thing today. Not knowing what to say to the people around him who have gone through some traumatic experiences. “I’m just glad to know that you’re actually alive,” Peter said, looking up to Tony.
They all knew that May wasn’t actually angry, she was more worried than anything. She had been angry at Tony for quite some time back when Peter vanished into dust, but even she knew that this was out of Tonys hands. And again with this time. She knew that Tony was never intentionally hurting Peter, that’s why she allowed him to become the boys legal guardian in the first place, but after all Peter was still her child too. She took care of him when his parents died and she watched him grow up into the boy he is now.
It was not much of a long way, Tony flying close to the Taxi and Steve, as well as Natasha with Wade in it. His heart was beating fast while Wilson was unlocking the door. “Yo Petey, I have guests who claim to know you!” he shouted, stepping inside. Natasha waiting outside with his suit, Steve and Tony following him in. “Who is it?” a voice answered only a few seconds later and Tony knew instantly that it was Peter. And with the voice a body showed up at the end of the hallway. He did not dare to breath, his voice nearly a whisper, “Peter...”
Bucky looked up from the couch in the living room, next to him Natasha, looking over to them as well. They looked like they were about to talk, when they saw Peter sleeping against Steves chest. Tony was quite strong in his suit, but without it he left Steve to lift heavy stuff, including humans.
While they all were ripped apart for five years and much has changed, they all were able to connect again after the final battle. It’s been month already, but Peter had not seen any of them since back then. He had spend five years as dust, woken up, fought a battle too big for any of them and had been kidnapped right after. Tony still checked his back after every second step, when walking alone through the night. He still woke up in cold sweat sometimes, remembering the cold place he had been in when he was kidnapped. And Bucky too. They all had faced it at some point, but Peter was still a kid. Yes, he was growing up and soon he was legally an adult as well, but for now, that boy was a child. It’s harsh how the world makes no difference between children and adults when it comes to suffering.
When Deadpool suddenly barged in, he was expecting a lot, but not that he had found Peter, in Europe, in jail, mentally broken. Peter was asleep against Tony now, all the weight on his shoulders lifted and sleep just taking over not even five minutes on the road, and Tony had his eyes focused on him. Probably to make sure the boy would not just vanish between his hands again. They both had to face so much over so little time, Steve wished he could take some of their pain away. His mind went back to how he felt himself the moment Bucky vanished. He had lost his brother, his best friend and his soulmate that day, but losing a son? Twice? That could not have been easy.
It was still weird sometimes anyway. It’s not as if he had been able to catch up to todays society in those few years. Yes, he knew a lot already and he sometimes had more random knowledge on things than any adult was supposed to have, but who was he to judge whether the internet gave him actually important knowledge or random stuff that no one needs to know. Tony had helped him figure out quite a lot. He knew how to use a smartphone, he finally knew the basic idea behind WiFi and mobile data, and he was quite proud to know that you don’t send out a text message by sms but instead use whatsapp. Not that he actually used that one, because Tony had them all on a private messager app which used secured lines and did not safe all their personal data. He had only touched the surface on that whole Facebook drama going on and decided that he would not need to know about it and just went back on using the Stark messager.
Pressed against the glass, Steve tried to shift, find a more comfortable position, and couldn't hold back a whimper. The enormous intrusion made it painful to move, even so much as
"These observances are becoming more frequent," Thor mused. "It saddens me to think what it might mean." He was putting his pants back on, and Steve had a moment of hope that it meant he wouldn't have to take that particular cock anymore.
The man was wrapped in green and gold robes, and wore an elaborate two-pronged crown on his head, like it was the most natural thing in the world. He looked up to see Steve in the doorway, and his face split into a wide grin. Slowly, deliberately, he put a finger to his mouth, a shushing motion. Then he pointed down.
"Whatever I want," Loki said easily, picking up his scepter from the ground, twirling it in his hand. "That's what you promised me, isn't it?"
Weakly, Steve tried to fight back. His struggles only increased as he realized he was being carried back to the cage, but to no avail.
"Just shut it." Stark's hand ground down. "Not in the mood." Steve's wrist couldn't have been described as delicate by any measure, not since the serum, but he felt the bones in his arm squeeze, a physical reminder of the precarious position he was in. Stark could easily snap those bones if he chose, and then hang Steve up anyway—and if Steve struggled against it, all he'd get was shocked or choked for trying.
"Hmm..." Stark paused in the doorway. He twitched his hand, and the collar tightened briefly around Steve's throat, not to choke him, but just a playful reminder, to let him know it could.
As he came down from his orgasm, the shame began to set in. He was kneeling naked in the halls of his last kidnapper, and coming willingly for his next. Still marked with Stark's use, he was now covered in Loki's spend. He couldn't have looked or felt more disgusting. He tried to lower his head, but Loki's fingers caught him by the chin again, forced him to look up.
There was that word again, debt. Steve wasn't going to give in, wasn't going to ask, but Stark didn't give him a chance to. Just circled around behind him, and let the first lash fall.
From the very start, he was pulled into the lap of a large, burly man, head crushed against the prominent bulge there, making an acquaintance with his crotch before he'd gotten more than a glimpse of his face. Even through the thick material of his jeans, Steve could feel every inch of the erection there, hard and scalding as hot metal, in a proportion that made his ass clench and his mouth go dry.
"Stop!" Steve shouted. "What are you—" the rest of it was muffled as the first nurse pressed something into his mouth. He caught a glimpse of something red and ball-shaped before it tucked under his teeth, spreading his jaw painfully wide. Drool instantly formed at the corners of his lips, and he squirmed, but had no way to wipe it.
Steve wasn't really looking at anything, because his eyes wouldn't focus. He had the vague impression of blurry skin, inches from his face. Squinting, he finally managed to make out a lean torso, chiseled six-pack, and a tattoo running along the hip, like an arrow, firing from a crossbow.
I accidentally also used Whipped from Day 31 out of order. May come back and retroactively count it, if I get to the end and desperately need one more for completionist.
"There," the woman sighed, drawing back again. "You want to be good for me, don't you? But you don't know what to do with your hands?"
There were twenty seconds left, which meant it had taken less than ten for him to reach the most mind-blowing orgasm of his life—that was how badly he'd wanted it.
In this rare moment of wakefulness, he tried to take stock. He was in a hospital bed, in an infirmary. It looked like the same one from that first day, so he was right back where he had started this nightmare. He wasn't strapped down this time, but the thought of getting up, trying to make a break for it, terrified him down to his core.
When he peeled open his wet eyes. He was still staring into the cage, and this time he could see something dark dripping into it, puddling the floor. Blood. His own blood.
Stark somehow dodged out of the way, more agile than he looked, more agile than his father would have been, and Steve's fists connected with empty air.
The so-called ice prince. The voice that had ridden in his head ever since he'd woken up from the frozen depths of the ocean. The voice that had put him to sleep in a bath of ice.
The last was choked off, but Stark seemed to understand him just fine. "Just showing you your place. You won't resist any part of yourself to me. You don't move unless I let you. You don't breathe unless I say you can. If I want to fuck you senseless while you're blacking out, then that's just what I'll do."
"You're so loose," Clint complained, as if it was Steve's fault, as if he'd chosen to be fucked by the whole room, or by Thor's improbably large dick. He grabbed Steve by the collar and yanked. Steve had to arch his spine unnaturally to avoid being choked, thrusting his chest into the air, and Clint took advantage to bite down on his nipple. Steve cried out brokenly as the teeth closed over his sensitive flesh, and he must have clenched down on the dick inside of him, because he could feel Clint's mouth shaping into a grin against his chest.
Assuming that Stark's word was to be trusted, he had to keep it together. He had to hold out, had to end this. All he had to do was not come for fifteen minutes, for crying out loud. He wasn't a teenager anymore.
By then Steve's fingertips were as rubbed raw as his wrists, and he gave up the vent as a lost cause. The next morning, a fresh bar appeared with his breakfast. He'd never felt so mocked by a soap before.
As Clint fucked him from behind, Nat thrust into his throat, the two of them perfectly in sync, as if used to working together. She deeper with each push, working his throat open, until he was gagging on it.
Stark was staring into his eyes, a wordless entreaty in his gaze. Whatever held him still didn't allow anything more.
"I know you have some old-timey values, Cap," said Stark casually, and it stung even more to be called that, a title for a hero, when he was currently anything but. "But in this modern day and age, we have this concept of paying our debts."
Once he got a grip on it, he pulled, ignoring the strange sensation of it breaching muscles that had closed up around it—half pleasure and half pain, and by his own hand, this time.
Behind him, Stark grunted in pleasure. "That's it, baby," he said, "You're getting so tight for me, that's it."
He tried a few rooms on his way down the next hall, and found another bedroom, this one with actual bedding. He knew it was a waste of time he didn't have, but he still stopped to strip the sheet from the bed, wrapping it around himself, grateful to be covered at last. As an afterthought, he bundled the pillowcase against the gash on his arm, where it bled through in an instant.
Casually, Stark reached over to a machine, and turned a dial. Liquid flowed into a clear tube, and towards Steve. Steve tried to follow it, but the drugs moved faster than his gaze. Before he could figure out where it was inserted into him, he went right back under again.
Fighting down a surge of hopelessness, he went to the door next, and found it, naturally, locked. Before he could really put his shoulder into it, he heard footsteps outside, and quickly moved to the hinge side, so that when it opened, he'd be hidden behind it.
The words rose to Steve's mind unbidden, like a floating corpse breaking the surface of the water. Steve's thought process stuttered on the image. "You don't need to do that," he said, urgent. "I... I won't do it again, honest. Just go back to sleep—"
"I've learned my lesson," Steve said instantly. It was already so cold, unbearably cold, and there was no reprieve, no matter how he twisted and squirmed. He felt like his very sanity was slipping from him as he writhed, breath coming from his mouth in short, sharp pants. "I've learned my lesson, please, please."
"Give me your hand," Loki said, in a tone that booked no room for resistance. Steve released Loki's penis with a wet sound, and released his own with a trembling hand, that he placed reluctantly into Loki's, open palm facing up ward.
That it could be multiple men, hundreds of them for all he knew, helping themselves to his unconscious flesh.
The light was coming from a glowing blue orb on its end, and seemed to pulse to some unheard beat, bathing the room and occupants in its alien tint.
The hook was right in front of Steve's face. Shiny, metal, ominously thick. Steve glanced down and saw that a corresponding one had appeared on the footboard. What kind of pervert slept in a bed like this?
"Don't let me interrupt," said the nurse, giggling nervously. Steve wanted to die. "It's just, your IV got knocked out by your last, ah, visitor. The sedatives, you know..."
Steve knew what was going to happen before she even did it, but there was no way to prepare. Her hips shifted, expertly, and then he was choking again, and he soundlessly sobbed against it. He wanted desperately to fight back. He thought he could push her off, get a brief suck of air before he was dragged back down, punished in whatever way these sadistic bastards could come up with.
He had put himself willingly into this position, and he'd be held tightly in place like this by the bars—immobilized, plugged, aching—until someone came to let him out.
The screen shut off, leaving just the timer. Steve clenched and unclenched his fists, breathing heavily. This couldn't be happening to him. Stark wasn't even going to fuck him himself, he'd built a machine to do it?
"Then help me," Steve said, without reservation. "If you've been watching," and the corresponding swell of humiliation was nearly enough to heat him, "you know I have no shame left. I'll do anything you want, literally anything, just get me out of here."
Somewhere deep down, his last spark of modesty still cringed at the idea of being seen like this—naked, lips distended around a cock—by a lady.
Fury at Stark, for being such a monster, who held people against their will, and treated them like objects, like a piece of meat. Who had just dumped him in here to be ravaged by his robot, and left, like he had better things to do than watch.
Either he'd forgotten the impossible size of the first one, or this one was much, much larger. He was sobbing into the gag now, his shoulders aching from how desperately he was trying to get free, to get just one arm loose so he could defend himself. The bonds didn't allow him to move so much as an inch.
"Well," said Stark, junior, accepting a pair of latex gloves from another nurse. "Let's see what the damage is."
Steve jerked away from it with a cry, and turned to look—there was no one there, no one at all, but the nurses were taking notice.
"Here, sweetheart." Stark took the straps from him and finished the job, pulling just a little too tight for it not to be malice.
It wasn't until the blissful white out subsided into shame and horror that he realized that Jarvis must still be watching him.
Steve froze. The blood turned to ice in his veins, but he didn't think it was Loki's magic doing it.
"No one," he pulled Steve off Clint with a yank, "wants advice," dropped him onto the floor, "from a fucktoy. Looks like you need another reminder."
He didn't get much sleep that night, jaw aching, his rapist clutching him around the middle like a teddy bear. Knowing full well what would happen to him in the morning.
It was true, Steve couldn't deny it. Steve's hips were rocking helplessly now, trying to get more of Stark's cock, trying to find friction for his own against a padded surface that was far too soft for it. He knew with absolute certainty that if Stark wrapped that hand around his penis, he'd come with a single touch, a prospect he both wanted and dreaded.
Steve pulled himself up onto weak limbs, and crawled the few feet over, head down, ass still dripping with Thor's come, an unpleasant trickle down each leg. On the other side of the couch, Nat was waiting. When he got close, she pulled up her skirt with a smile.
"You've suffered, though, haven't you? The man of iron is as hard on his toys as he is on his enemies."
Heart racing, Steve forced himself on. He turned another corner, and realized that he was leaving a trail of blood, still dripping from the gash in his arm. But besides clutching his makeshift bandage tighter, there wasn't much he could do except hurry on. He wasn't familiar with the building, wasn't even familiar with moving on his own two legs anymore. Pain and dizziness threatened to send him crashing down at any moment, and his aching head could hardly keep straight which way was up besides, but he had to keep going.
Instead of responding, Clint slapped Steve's erect dick, and Steve muffled his next cry. "Look at you, still so hard from this. You love this, don't you? Say it."
He was cut off. It seemed to go on interminably, Stark pounding into him, turning his air off and on like he was idly flipping a switch. Steve struggling fruitlessly every time, dragged down into a tunnel of pitch blackness, entire being narrowed down to nothing but the desperate need to breathe. When it was finally granted to him, he floated. The rest of the world came rushing back to him, the sensation unbearably intense, like he was suddenly jammed back into this body that was being fucked and assaulted and stimulated beyond its limits.
His hand came down on Steve's mangled back, hard, making him gasp in pain, and arch, and clench around the intrusion inside him.
Across the top of the screen flashed the glowing timer from the first day, the same font, the same sickly green color. That didn't bode well. Steve had had several nightmares about that thing already, and didn't look forward to more.
"You're still famous, you know?" Stark said, when the video ended. "Maybe I'll release these new commercials to the porn sites. Give people an update on what their hero is up to these days?"
A white-hot panic was filling him, his body writhing without his input, struggling furiously for another breath, just a tiny of sliver of air. But the collar was merciless.
"You would still be a popsicle right now if it weren't for my rescue teams, tirelessly combing the oceans, year after year. You have no idea how much of a bill you've racked up, do you?"
"Give me your hand," he said, holding out his palm for it, gauntlet hovering at the ready. "The right one."
"Stark, please, no. You don't understand, I can't, not this. Anything but this, please, I'm begging you, please—"
There was nowhere for Steve to go, and it was Stark who slid over, pulling himself into a sitting position as he did so. When he was close enough, he pulled Steve's head into his lap, and waited expectantly.
A part of Steve had been hoping that he was being held captive by a deranged criminal, that if he escaped, there might be a chance of rescue, and Stark would be brought to justice.
“How is it going?” Mr. Rogers said warmly to Peter, MJ, and Ned. Like he had a sixth sense about their papers.
“Has to be -- that gas is expanding and growing. Which doesn’t make sense at all. If the scrubbers aren’t cleaning it up, the gas should be dissipating.”
Probably a bad idea to hang out with Jan tonight -- Tony should go to bed early, he had an early start for flight practice. And he adored flight practice. He lifted his googles to rub his eyes. To be honest, he was so tired he was heading to zombie-town.
“You don’t have to do that -- I told you. It’s all a smoke screen to poke at you and run secret experiments.”
“I mean -- if the cat thing bothers you, I can give you money and transportation to wherever you want to go.”
It didn’t work in the 30s, it wasn’t going to work now. Steve was a patient man, but he was also a man of action who needed to confront all problems head on.
After a private dinner with Maria, Steve returned to his room to find the tiny black cat curled up on his bed. “You would not believe how nice today was, Star,” Steve said.
In the afternoon, Tony woke up with a terrible crick in his neck from sleeping on it wrong, and a tiredness so profound he wasn’t sure that coffee would cure it. Wait -- he rubbed his eyes, not sure at first if anything the night before had really happened.
Peter panicked. All he could do was sneak over to the bench, glad that his dad was stuck to his phone like wallpaper to a wall. He squatted down as best he could behind the bench, where Tony really wasn’t going to see him, to snag the frisbee out of his backpack. Once he slid the frisbee out of the pocket, he put the frisbee on top of the bag and snuck back to his hiding place.
“And don’t read the New York Times either,” Jan added. She had gathered up a pile of newspaper sections in front of her at the table.
“I have a friend I can set him up with and it’ll be great. Hank likes Steve. I should have started with him.”
The revived helicarrier Chimera was now home. Hulk had destroyed the RV and MODOK shot up the remains of the estate. Bruce had offered him a place and Tony was worn out and couldn’t really say no. There wasn’t anywhere else to go.
He should have texted Tony to suggest meeting up. But that would have made Tony worry. Is it the team, Cap? Is there an emergency?
She lowered them to the ground. Turns out Steve had taken more damage that it first appeared. The armor made a poor cushion for Steve’s head as she cradled him, waiting for the ambulance. Blood stained his uniform on his left hip and stomach and Steve’s face was paler than usual.
In the morning, he woke to find Cap already stoking the fire. “Snow’s finished,” Cap said as he handed a cup of water to Tony. “Need a few minutes to wake up before tackling the jeep?”
“There is a garden party in the West Garden this afternoon,” Sam explained. “You and the Prince are the guests of honor. I should get you back now, so you can prepare.”
He heard the voices outside the RV. Tony ran a hand through his long unruly hair and grabbed a soda.
Jan and Greer hated him, that’s what Tony decided as he sourly sipped his drink and watched the dance floor from his balcony seat. This whole mission was their fault.
“Are you crazy?” Tony asked. “There is no way that this will end well. Trust me on that -- I have years of exploring experience under my belt.”
“Yeah,” Peter said. He was frozen in his seat as he watched his dad put everything on the line to get Mr. Steve back.
A few fakes had been thrown into the mix as well as the questioned watercolor. The production company had an additional five pieces that they hoped to confirm as Steve’s.
The next day, Peter arrived early for Academic Decathlon practice in the school auditorium. Mr. Steve -- he couldn’t quite shake calling Mr. Rogers Mr. Steve -- was working with the new students. Peter sat in the back, looking through his physics homework, half paying attention to the activity in the room. Mr. Steve was walking the new students through practice making speeches.
Tony was honest-to-god one of the best friends Steve ever had. Even if Tony had grumbled at the need to share beds on their trip. But deserts get cold at night and soft beds were few and far between on their trip back to Timely.
Hazy memories of the night before filtered through Steve’s mind. The guests raucously cheering them when Tony announced the wedding. Someone had loaned Steve his best silk waistcoat, someone else a bowtie, and Gass’s wife had tried her best when she cut his hair. “A man should look good at his own wedding,” she firmly stated.
At least that’s what it felt like. Obviously, his dad felt he’d messed up something. Peter sat mesmerized as Mr. Steve gracefully got up from the table and walked over to Tony, all business.
“Nonsense,” Maria said. “We’ve all become much too fond of you to let you go, and I dare say you wouldn’t want to disappoint Tony. We’ll revisit the wedding when Howard is better. The appearance of the political match is necessary -- and we’ll have something to hold against Alexander when we need it.”
All he could get were the elevators that didn’t go to the Avengers floor. He grabbed one in his haste to get to Steve. Then Tony ran up the stairs, jumping over steps two at a time. He’d be winded when he got to the gym floor. Nothing says I-love-you like standing in front of your would-be boyfriend wheezing until you’re red in the face and nearly passing out from lack of oxygen.
She shouldn’t be thinking about a stupid cricket and Steve’s stupid smile while he’s in ICU at the hospital.
Tony looked up into Steve’s beautiful blue eyes and thought about all the coffee he brought him over the past few weeks. A promposal had nothing on being here with Steve. Especially when Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and gave him a kiss on the top of his head. “That got to hurt.”
If he hadn’t relived Thursday over and over and over again, and finally asked Steve to just go out for a date right then and there, damn all Steve’s romantic plans for their significant first date, Tony would have bailed.
“Team! All hands on deck. Evacuate the Tower,” Steve commanded. “Spider-man, met me in the holding lab.”
Steve was led to his chambers by one of Maria’s ladies, Natasha. “Here are your rooms, near the Prince’s, as is custom,” she explained. “It’s not much -- but these have been the Prince Consort’s since the palace was renovated.”
Steve looked thoughtful. “I do spend most nights here already.” He poked Tony in a ticklish spot. “If I moved in officially, I’ll need some closet space, more than the two drawers I’m using –”
Steve had too much time on his hands for some projects and too little time to work on others. He couldn’t focus on his book. Nice to have the time to read for fun. But each little noise pricked his ears -- the curse was that he could hear a lot -- and he thought maybe it was Tony arriving early to hang with him.
Steve could hear the slow tick-tock of the clock his mother had had back in their apartment. He’d heard that soft ticking in the quiet of the kitchen as he struggled to get through his homework.
“I’ll build you your own closet. I can draw the plans up right after breakfast. I’m going to design you a closet that’s going to be on the cover of Architectural Digest.”
At this point, Tony had probably lived through a month of Thursdays. He’d lost count a few Thursdays ago. He had a lot of things to handle and, honestly, the best way to keep count would be a tally sheet so he wouldn’t be wasting the brain cells. But of course, notes always evaporated when the day started over again.
“Weaponized love potion,” Steve said, his voice a touch more ragged than it should be. He could tug on Tony’s tie and Tony’s body, all six feet one inch of him, would crash into Steve. His hand would land right there on Tony’s firm and bouncy ass.
Carol and Jan got her into an oversized shirt and yoga pants, with sunglasses to hide behind. Maybe not the most romantic outfit to wear on her way to meet her new-found crush. But it was a hospital and they were Avengers.
Maybe he should text Tony and suggest that they met up in the bedroom. Fucking Tony into the mattress seemed to be a far better option than anything Steve had at the moment.
“Everyone, practice is back on. Now, ready, Cole?” Cole blustered his way through his improvised speech and Mr. Steve led the applause.
Janet sighed and flopped down in one of the chairs in front of Tony’s desk. “Carol was my first choice -- she didn’t mention being out of town when we talked a couple of days ago. I should have suggested the date then -- when I mentioned getting back together with Hank.”
“You don’t have to go if you don’t want to. We like you -- you’re definitely a vast improvement over Brock.”
Steve tamped down his panic. Of course there were paintings of the princes exchanged before the marriage was contracted. Steve was too far down the line of command to have seen Tony’s, but Alexander would have sent a painting of Brock before deciding to send Steve in his place.
Mr. Steve was nowhere to be found and it was a huge park filled with people in the late October weather. Peter and Ned went through the motions of asking a family about their dogs when Mr. Steve and a tall man arrived with a golden lab. Mr. Steve was in his jeans and a long-sleeve shirt. He was laughing and tossing and catching a frisbee in one hand.
He had tried everything he could think of. Infinity stones? No. AIM weirdness? No. Skrulls? No. Impossible Man? No.
Peter tapped his pen thoughtfully as he watched Mr. Rogers walk through the cafeteria. Maybe if Tony and Mr. Rogers met again, under the right circumstances, it just might work.
Called in as Tony’s support, Clint was off somewhere negotiating more drinks for the table. “Just some bros out for the night,” Clint joked before leaving.
“I’ve been misled,” Steve thought as he examined the tapestries outside the throne room. They were taught in Triskelion that Malibu was a poor and run-down country faced with food shortages and illnesses.
Great, that meant that Tony had likely put on the Iron Man helmet to filter out the gas. “The gas is now in the HVAC. Could be a pheromone spray,” Steve said.
“Mr. Steve has an art show in a couple of weeks. Natasha and I couldn’t figure out how to get Dad to the gallery.”
“Huh,” Peter said. “I don’t know what to do. Natasha’s run out of ideas. Our one idea was having them run into each other. But nothing came out of that.”
If he holed up in the workshop then he wouldn’t go to the Espresso Express. But he did every. single. time. Because he was still fundamentally Tony Stark and he needed coffee like other people needed air. He went in the morning or in the afternoon or in the evening to get it. And that didn’t affect the time loop.
“Hey, come on,” Sharon said with a laugh tugging on Steve’s jacket. “If I don’t get him to leave now, he’ll want to stay and argue movies.”
“Really? You’d go back there? After Alexander left you to fend for yourself?” Tony asked with surprise.
Steve collapsed on the bed, his body shaking from laughing. Tony swatted at him as Steve shifted away from him and wiped tears from his eyes.
“Soon, then,” Steve replied. He could count on his own manners drilled into him by his mother since birth to at least get him through the day.
Except that Steve did not want to leave. Or turn down Tony. Granted, Tony becoming a black cat unexpectedly was not the optimal situation. On the other hand, Steve had been told Tony was the worst of all possible princes, when he was clearly the opposite in nearly thing that counted -- brilliant, funny, dedicated, motivated. All the qualities that Steve admired and preferred in a potential husband. He’d always enjoyed spending time with the palace engineers back at the Triskelion and Tony could be
Sam stayed at the doorway, dismayed that the morning plans were disrupted. Rhodey soon joined him. Tony waved hello to the captain. He said to Steve, “You’ve met Rhodey -- Rhodey has been my best friend from childhood.”
Everything was wonderfully organized and well-run. Steve picked up the hint that he was not expected to take over the management of the place. Queen Maria had installed a dedicated team of staff who managed the palace.
Tony picked himself up. His helmet had taken some damage from the crash. Tony tugged at the catches. “Need some help here.”
He cleared one floor, then the next, all the while seeing little puffs of colored gas coming through the HVAC. On the third floor, he found Tony trying to pry off a vent cover in a corridor.
Tony could hear the touch of amusement in Steve’s voice and wondered if Steve had put up much of a fight about being benched. Probably he did; he didn’t take benching well, even for a good cause.
Steve could really do without the supersensitive hearing some of the time. Tony sidled up to him. “Look, it might be easier to take you out on a date before sticking my tongue down your throat. But in my defense, I thought we were under a love potion.”
It all went off the rails when Steve had given him the box in the kitchen when it was just them alone instead of during the group present opening. Jan had walked in on Tony enthusiastically kissing Steve and then jumped right out with profuse apologies.
The first thing Tony did after getting a long hot shower and proper haircut was to dispatch one of Hill’s agents to retrieve his last deeply hidden secret from a Swiss bank vault.
Yeah, it was good, wasn’t it? Peter considered as he realized he was expected to clean up. He didn’t mind, as he overheard his Dad and Steve still lingering in conversation at the front door, reluctant to part.
The late summer weather was hot and breezy, and that’s why Tony had stripped off his clothes. They were sharing one bed because that’s all that was available when they arrived and Steve had without question shared a bed with others before. A reason for the ring stumped him.
Tony had no answer. He couldn’t think of one, and he’d gone to his share of the events. Sue and Reed couldn’t even have a baby shower without a supervillain attack.
Once Steve got off the elevator onto one of the business floors of the Tower, the blaring alarms assaulted his ears. How could anyone stay behind with all the noise? He found a woman at her desk, earphones on and desperately pecking away. “I have to get this spreadsheet done,” she protested.
Steve set down his coffee mug and joined Tony on the bed. He swung his legs up, and rolled onto his stomach, and smiled at Tony. He kissed Tony’s bicep. “Only you and T’Challa would consider that big news.”
The ambient warmth on his skin told him he didn’t want to risk the stabbing pain he’d likely get when he opened his eyes directly into a faceful of morning sun. With a groan, he turned over, rolling right smack into Tony’s firm backside.
“Get your math done, Stevie, and then you can draw,” Sarah would say from her washtub. He heard that loud ticking as he sewed buttons back on shirts that his mother washed while Steve squirmed and shifted in his seat, eager to be set free to play outside.
Steve said nothing but stood there, arms crossed over, glowering as only Steve could. “I can take the criticism -- that’s one of the first things I learned. But no one seems to care what I say about which piece I made or not.”
Tony got into the bed, covered with dust and fall leaves that blew in. The bedding smelled terrible. “Are you getting in?”
He decrypted the files stored on the stick and Kamala pointed out things in the video taken just before Steve was -- killed in the Chimera disaster.
No wonder the team thought that Steve had proposed last night. They should have been married years ago. They should have gotten married the afternoon Tony found him. It was ridiculous the amount of time they hadn’t been married.
Steve did like movies after ‘44 -- Tony had shown him lots of movies. Steve wasn’t crazy about war movies or some of the horror, though he’d liked Jaws. They’d watched the Transformers movies just the other night. Steve had laughed at Tony’s running commentary. “Right.”
Peter considered for the millionth time that maybe he shouldn’t have told his friends about his secret plan to find a special someone for his dad. He was going to college next year, and he didn’t want to leave his dad all alone.
The whole opening reception thing was tedious and he couldn’t see a thing, even when Clint asked him to take empty bottles to a back office. Then the crowd began to thin. Clint said, “Closing time,” as he packed up.
If Tony suggested a movie or a show, Steve prayed it would not be anything with Doctor Who in it. Steve always had a low-grade irritation with it. He told people he didn’t quite know why. But Steve did know. He just didn’t relate to the Doctor -- immortal beings should be different. Thor was, Steve would be.
“Connoisseurship,” Steve sneered under his breath to Tony as they watched the evaluators walk around the table and easels.
Mr. Rogers made a strange noise but still stepped into the apartment foyer. Peter went off to his room for the phone, maybe if he took a long time looking for the phone, Dad and Mr. Rogers could talk.
He gave Star a kiss on her head. “I wish -- I wish Tony would like me too,” he finally confessed to his feline friend. Actually, he was now nursing a large crush on Tony, who was turning out to be everything that Steve had dreamt of when he thought of a life partner. “Have I told you about his plans for education for all children in Malibu?”
She chuckled. “The power of belief is a strong force in the art market and art criticism, to the point of blinding people who will not see. But, if you have time, I would love it if you could work on some authentication issues for me. It’s rare to have a contemporary to a lot of the artists working in the early part of the twentieth century.”
Now that he wasn’t on call, Tony snuggled deeper into the sheets and blankets and blatantly ogled the lovely ass right in front of him.
Tony swept back to the table. Steve looked miserable sitting there with Jan trying to de-escalate the situation. He perked up when he saw Tony approach the table.
No one sat there because that was Tony’s chair. Everyone knew that as soon as they signed onto the Avengers.
“Yeah, let’s go,” Tony mumbled. He slunk back to the lobby, dejected and still holding onto the flowers.
Like really laughing and touching his dad’s arm and just looking at his dad all the time they were talking. Pepper was off to the side in a small group of people. She saw Peter and winked.
Tony’s ass and legs and back would look amazing on Steve’s bed. Especially if Tony didn’t have any clothes on.
So that’s how Tony was asked to the Avengers Academy Prom. Simple, direct, in Pym’s lab, his least favorite place on campus, when he was sore and tired.
Steve felt an unknown tension unwind from his shoulders. He then had a vision of his new friends heading off to Triskelion to free his mother. Tony would sit on his shoulder, a brave cat ready to battle for his --. Well, he didn’t know what exactly to call what he was to Tony. He had hope .…
Tony and Steve had matching cumberbunds in red but Tony didn’t know the color of the boutonniere. Tony turned back to the mirror and pushed stray hairs back into place. He looked fabulous -- he knew it.
The girl appeared to be remarkably sincere and Tony was a sucker for young people in trouble. “Come on.”
“He’s already attending to Dad. But no one thought it could be poison.” Tony groaned. “Obadiah’s been bringing Dad’s favorite fruit to him each morning.”
He had loved Steve forever. Forever. And now, he finally had what he wanted. He wanted that damn date on Saturday and Saturday was never coming at this rate.
Then Steve stopped by and they were deep in conversation about Avengers business and what Steve was doing that weekend and what Natasha was working on and the cricket chirped and Natasha jumped about five feet in the air from the surprise.
The rest of the afternoon and evening flew by and Tony sat next to Steve on the Avengejet landing deck watching the city lights. There might have been kissing, and handsy moments between them as they sat side by side.
Back to welding. The armor had taken a serious beating and she didn’t have a back-up version yet since she was redesigning the repulsors.
MJ was a good friend, Peter thought once he was back at home. For some reason Tony had Rhodey, Carol and Nat over for dinner. Peter sat anxiously at the dining table listening to Carol talking about her latest test drive of a race car. He looked at the time on his phone. He should have heard from Mr. Rogers by now.
He glanced over at the small black box with the arty cufflinks Steve had given for him on the nightstand. Steve had commissioned the artist sometime last year to craft “space geode” cufflinks. The gift stemmed from a long-standing private joke that would be impossible to explain to anyone else. He grinned, thinking of how Steve said “space geode.”
After getting Steve into his embroidered jacket and breeches, Jarvis tsked over the fit and fashion. Even Steve, unused to fancy fashion, could tell he looked woefully out of place in Howard’s modern court as he looked at himself in the head-to-toe mirror, the largest mirror he’d ever seen.
The wind howled outside, shaking the roof and a single window coated with snow. At least they were both big men, and they warmed up the small cabin a bit by just standing and breathing. They didn’t know how long the storm would last, and while Tony was dressed for the weather, he didn’t know how Cap could possibly stay warm in that uniform for any length of time. He might not like the man, but he didn’t want him to freeze to death either.
Her empty mug sits on the table; usually she would have cleaned up after her, but this time she didn’t, likely still occupied with everything that had happened in the last two days.
"But I'm not Captain America," Steve grins, dropping the facade as he waddles clumsily behind Tony, marching out of the shop; the extra length of the comforter dragging like a tail behind him. "I'm Steve Rogers, making sure my boyfriend comes to bed on time."
He inhales sharply, laughing dryly when Steve does the same, his breathing synchronizing with Tony’s.
But there he is, stripped bare and in turn, he’s stripping Steve as bare as well; quickly looking like he’s going to break him and that is why.
“I was there when you returned from Siberia, Tony.” She starts, voice calmer than Tony had ever heard her recall that, say, even a year ago.
A text reads. Tony snorts without a second thought and immediately sniffs to cover it up when Shuri clears her throat.
A heavy sort of weight sitting in his stomach and weighing down instead of plummeting to the bottom. It’s nice.
They should have captured him long ago, he realises. He’s been going rogue all on his own, disconnected himself from the team and Rhodey and Pepper and he knows for sure that he’s breaking more law than he’d memorised twenty years ago. Somebody should have caught him; HYDRA or someone from WSC. Maybe even one of his teammates.
He’d opted to not bring up Rogers with this guy. Maybe he should, who knows, but he doesn’t trust this man enough to open that far yet.
He’s not mad per say, especially after that name calling because that is something Tony appreciates with a strange fondness. Coming from James who had taken so long to even speak his mind, this is pure affection. Not the knife throwing kind that Sam gets but Tony’s good with this amount.
Natasha’s cool gaze is fixed on him steadily even if she’s holding onto Helen Cho, six feet away from him. There’s someone arresting his arms from behind but he doesn’t care who, doesn’t put up a fight; that’s not why he’s here.
Gauntleted fingers dig into her lab-coat clad frame, and he shakes her once before they’re quickly intercepted.
He misses his medicine the next morning, completely forgets about it until he’s tucking himself into bed and his eyes are drooping one second and the next, he’s bolting upright,
“Sorry,” Tony licks it off and kisses the fragrant vanilla into his mouth. Then he leans in close, with an impish glint in his eyes, just to whisper a naughty, “Mr Stark-Barnes,” into Bucky’s ear.
Rhodey had kept his spot in front of Tony and Rogers never attempted, not even once, to approach him.
He pays extra attention to Wanda during their sparring session. He sees how she spends most of her practice partnering with Steve.
“What’d you get? Louboutin?” Tony interrupts, to which Wanda snorts indelicately, immediately hiding it behind a hand and an apology.
His own arms are curled tightly around Tony; face pressed into Tony’s throat with his palm still clutching onto the reactor in Tony’s chest.
It hurts to go against them. It’s physically painful to take a step back when your motor neurons are executing a step forth. It
It’s fine. They could sleep in tomorrow, he thought as he let Tony grab his hand and guide his fingers across the keys.
Maybe he now remembers how Steve once perfectly replaced every missing pieces of his broken heart with his own.
“You hurt me the most but you also make me the happiest. Not a day. Not a second in my life I’ve felt happiest that wasn’t with you in it.”
Especially after Natasha and Rhodey playing tag team to let him out for air two weekends on ends, it’s a tremendous relief.
He washes him clean, shampoos his hair and rinses off the sud, holding his tongue back all the while. He unplugs the tub and lets the water drain before he gets out, clenching his jaw hard at how Bucky sinks down soon after - couldn't even hold his weight up.
So is the way Steve worms back into the comforter, shirtless with a new pair of boxers and pulls Tony close.
On Sunday morning, he finds himself the third to arrive in the kitchen, first two being Rogers and his buddy Barnes.
Maybe it’ll be nice to know that their grounds are levelled when it comes to affecting weakness to each other, he supposes.
Tony aims maximum Repulsor energy at the giant prune’s head, successfully distracting the alien from Vision and Wanda.
“I know. Hey, I hear you and I’m here for you. But I also think it’s time for you to move on, Tones.”
But that doesn’t mean Bucky never tries. When it gets bad, he tries so hard he comes too close to that line. Like tonight.
Tony smiles when Steve tosses the damp-towel he’d brought from the bathroom into his laundry basket with precision. This is familiar.
So when Steve comes in - carrying his sketchbook and a blanket, probably planning to spend the rest of his day in the shop with Tony - Tony’s towering over him.
Okoye and Nakia give her the eye of approval while Peter and Shuri argue about the latest Yeezy, surrounded by, and lounging on Vibranium infused techs.
Steve exhales like he’s been punched. His gaze dropping to the ground, hands curling into fists by his sides and Tony can see them shaking.
“Fucking tease.” Tony growls into his pillow. Steve’s thumb over the arch of his hip bone rubs a circle and he nips at Tony’s lobe, “I know.”
No matter how many times you try to rub them clean, you’ll probably never reach the bottom of it. Forever changed by time and obstacles.
Tony learns more about Barnes previous job that way.His interests in mechanics. Curiosity in engineering and a healthy dose of interest in technology.
The calm voice of T’Challa telling him about soul and matches; of brightness and darkness while he looked every bit as if he’s committing a crime against an unseen force.
He stays long enough to see Rogers look at him, lips parting as if he wants to say something but not long enough to hear what he has to say.
Tony stares back confidently – for what Steve lacks, he has enough for them both - the remnant of his own glee still evident on the upturn of his lips.
Tony enters the elevator and he’s lost for a second before Steve follows in and presses the button to his guest suite. He takes Tony’s uninjured hand and kisses the inside of his wrist.
If you look out the window, you can see the barn cum garage and Tony’s been there earlier this afternoon, checking on their tractor, speaking with Fury about stuff and he’d came out of there for hours now but there was a thought he had when he was still inside:
“I didn’t count.” Steve answers robotically. Eyes trained far away from Tony, over his shoulder. “But I know when I stopped.”
Wilson swears to murder the ‘Bucky and Tony team up’ something gory while Steve smiles indulgently at Tony from two seats over.
Which brings us to three weeks from that night, when Tony - frustrated from trying to reach the topmost shelf for an old file - finally, begrudgingly, accepts Dum-E's offer of a stepping stool after thirty minutes of scolding the poor bot for making fun of his height - Not because he's insecure.
Tony takes the olive branch gladly, snorting out a laugh full of faux humour just so they can move on from all the grave sombreness to a lighter mood.
Giddy as they are with something vile and raw, they didn't care if their teeth clashed in the rush; painful and sharp, or if their kisses were too messy and wet. Their heads are too heady with the taste of their love and they feed it into each other’s mouths, drink it out of them and fuck - They laugh through it all.
Barnes huffs at him, scrubbing his face once more as his eyes glance hopefully down the path the Widow has stormed off. “If you’re not right, I’m personally sabotaging your relationship with Steve.”
Tony looked regretfully at Steve’s beautiful sandwiches still in their takeout wrappers on the coffee table. “So much for lunch.”
As a result, Steve arrived fashionably late to the party, making heads turn and setting the crowd to twittering behind their fans and hands. He walked towards the cabana where Maria and her attendants sat. He noticed a remarkably stunning, young, brown-haired man lounging in the chair next to the queen.
Back at their table, Tony realized that Brian and Loki barely tolerated each other if they weren’t dancing and Jan was looking through her phone because Thor was on the other side of the room with Fandral and Sif.
But there was another large building with a smoking chimney and large wooden door close by the Captain of the Guard ’s house. The building appeared much like other manufacturing trades buildings, though there was a deck stretching between the second floors of the building and the Captain’s house, with what appeared to be a table and an umbrella, and a lattice against the building’s wall.
Steve took a deep breath as he descended from the carriage to be greeted by the entire court of King Howard of Malibu.
Tony absolutely hated the little thrill he got from Cap’s breath on his neck and the weight of his arm on his waist. He ignored it as best he could. He tried counting sheep, counting backwards by primes, solving calculus equations, anything to fall asleep.
Uncle Rhodey delivered as promised. Peter was undercover at the gallery since he didn’t want his dad to suspect anything. As far Tony knew, Peter was staying over at Ned’s, studying for a big test.
Steve booped Tony’s nose and chuckled. “That’s the official date – we’ll have already gotten married in private a few months earlier. City Clerk’s office.”
“It’s not that -- it’s just that a lot of our friends aren’t dating right now. Rhodey is seeing someone, but I haven’t even met her. So that’s a no-go.”
Tony had that horribly pinched look on his face, the one he got all the time when he felt that SHIELD was taking advantage of Steve or when Steve talked about the serum and the war. “So, this SHIELD person, bet they wanted a blood sample. A lot of blood samples.”
Second, the rumors about Prince Tony were terrible. Steve had heard his share as he went about his duties for the royal family. Tony was the worst of libertines, constantly hungover from his drunken parties, slovenly in habits and awfully rude to all those around him. Guests to Alexander’s court dropped their voices in a hush when they gossiped about Tony -- how informal he was in dress, that he snuck off constantly to run riot in the town, seducing and deserting the children of the townspeople, and his immense debts and rampant spending. And worst of all, he was the least intelligent of all his royal line, a constant embarrassment to Howard and Maria.
Steve pointed at the red gas coming through the vent above them. The woman sighed deeply, picked up her backpack and left. One gone, more to find.
MJ just shrugged. Peter began to tap his leg up and down, his nerves showing. She nudged him hard. “Stealth is not your strong point, is it?”
“Um.” Steve deflated like a balloon. His face screwed up, like he was pulling on the same determination he used when punching a tank. “Um, a date date?”
Tony looked shocked as Mr. Steve turned away. Peter twisted and pushed his way out of his seat not at gracefully and not without knocking into too many people.
Tony laughed pointedly at the jokes and agreed with the observances of Maria’s attendants, and he exchanged knowing looks with the armed guard stationed near them. Steve guessed that the man was the Captain Rhodes that Sam spoke highly of. Natasha was at a table off to the side, sitting near Duke Obadiah and a tall man with an eyepatch.
It was too late to contain the gas, which had been the point of the holding lab. That was, before the Hulk-sized hole in the ceiling. Steve was also pretty certain that Tony was going to take it hard that Hulk managed to punch a hole through the floor of the reinforced lab that was supposed to handle any threat, except for, apparently, Hulk searching for a lost kitty. “Right.”
He asked, “Why? As far as I can tell, you and I still have all our limbs attached, no concussions, no body swapping …. Unless there’s a surprise you’re about to spring on me. Like a visit from our clones or something.”
Steve hovered briefly in the gap between not wanting to know what happened and needing to know. He finally asked, “What happened?”
Tony should have stopped the whole thing before it ever got to this stage. Instead, he and his date (a lovely Broadway star), Steve and his date (Jan’s friend), and Jan and, ugh, Hank were all out together on a group date.
“We don’t have to dress up, they have enough food for you and no reservations required and more tables than is reasonable in a restaurant.” Tony was flying by the seat of his pants, and he knew if he thought about it, any of this, he’d put it off until Saturday for whatever Steve planned.
King of the liars, that’s what Tony was. But he had a job to do. He was built to fix things. That’s what Steve would say to him.
“Do you usually meet people through a publicist?” Steve asked. “Is that the only way you go on a date?”
It was General Phillips who recruited him for the mission -- they talked about it on the way to a dinner at the officers’ club, driven by Phillips’ chauffeur, Rogers. Philipps was persuasive, Rogers gorgeous, the meal decent. Easy to say yes back in London, clearly a stupid idea in the field.
“So this happens randomly?” Steve said, still puzzling this out. He did not have extensive experience with magic.
“I might be thinking that,” Steve agreed. He tugged at Tony’s suit jacket and Tony stepped back to peel the jacket off.
Back to the panic attack -- what in hell was he going to do on a date with Steve? What should he wear? Where would they go? What would they do? Should Tony have gotten restaurant reservations?
Steve would lay good money that he was on the verge of a massive hangover, given how much of Goss’s moonshine he’d drunk last night. All he could remember with any certainty was the crowd egging him on as he danced a jig with Tony.
Steve took a deep breath. He had to pull it together. If he was scared of a tiny cat, then he wasn’t going to survive until the wedding.
“No one on this team is going to compete with Hulk petting kittens.” Tony picked up his drawing. “We need to get this back where it belongs.”
“Yes, Captain is the first name, America is the second. Born on the Fourth of July to Betsy Ross and Paul Revere.”
It was better to wait than to ask. That’s how Steve felt. He didn’t want Tony to worry unnecessarily. Not when there were worse things.
Winter. Snow. Harsh wind that cut through him like he had no clothes, leaving him shivering in his best wool coat. And that asshole Captain America was barely affected as he dug a path for the both of them towards the cabin they had found.
“He didn’t believe me, Tony. I know what I painted! He wanted me to agree with him. So the owner could sell the piece for thousands of dollars. Because my name was on it.”
January was all miserable cold rain and tedium after the holiday rush. Even the initial excitement at getting accepted at MIT had worn off for Peter. Natasha admitted she had nothing so Peter was back at square one about finding his dad a date and a special someone.
“Your research is very interesting, Dr. Pym,” Steve said. “Ms. Raynor, I saw your wonderful performance in the Oklahoma revival.”
Maybe Steve took an extra second or two to watch Tony rush off. Tony was still in the slim black suit he’d changed into when he returned to the Tower. Steve would have been happier if Tony was in the armor. But Steve had to change into his own uniform.
Tony sign exasperatedly. “When I say they’re trash, I mean fun trash. When Rogers says they’re trash, he’s being judgy and snobby. I have no idea why your school hires complete downers for your teachers.”
Steve was punching the hell out of his third bag that day. He looked startled as Tony appeared covered in spilt coffee, sweat running down his face, opening and closing his mouth like a guppy.
“I’m sure it will blow over, Steve,” Tony said. He hoped it would blow over soon because a righteously angry Steve was a dangerous Steve, and Tony didn’t want to be roped into picking up trash in Central Park again. Last time had been … an interesting experience.
“By the way, the team voted and agreed that if you and Steve don’t do something about this mutual pining thing that you have going on, we’re locking you up somewhere,” Jan said pointedly in the car.
Tony nearly choked on his breath and fumbled his phone as he attempted to put it away. “Steve and I -- no, we’re not dating.”
Ororo had created a mini-windstorm around her to keep the gas away. “One of Bruce’s cats found a hole in the wall and got lost. Hulk went to find her.”
“I do now, since I’m keeping you. And if you’re scared about what could happen, then we’ll make our own future instead.”
Steve smiled at her, the same fond smile he had when he came back, all proud about relocating that cricket.
“It’s near blizzard conditions out there and we’re somewhere in a Finnish forest -- you go out there, you get lost. We never ever saw even a hint of a wood pile.”
“Steve,” Tony said, his voice faltering. “I mean, if this isn’t what you were thinking -- I got carried away. You know what it’s like when I get to drinking.” He pulled his hand back, making as if to take the ring off.
Hank preened into the mirror. “It’s now who likes Steve’s favorite movies the most. It wouldn’t be so pathetic if Steve liked anything past 1944.”
The panic would have eaten through his brain and he would have found a reason to run away from this -- Steve’s great laugh, his ridiculous motorcycle story, that really nice feel of Steve’s hand in his.
“Clint -- he’s been gone for awhile.” Tony had a thought. “Wait -- he might have gotten into trouble --”
Finally, the gathered experts finished their study. The Stark Industries art team had rejected all the submitted pieces while Fergus’ team stated all five were done by Steve.
“I don’t have time for a big splashy wedding any time soon. Got to get you settled into school and there’s the product launch and there’s a new R&D project --”
He could already feel the sickening crunch of his body and fragile skull against the pavement. Though it was his fault for dashing into the street, right in front of a garbage truck. On purpose.
“So are supervillain attacks and alien invasions. Have we gone to a single superhero wedding that didn’t get interrupted?”
They were outside the restaurant when Mr. Steve called. Tony hung up on him, then immediately called back. A huge yelling fight over cellphones in two different cars ensued and continued from the outside the restaurant to Peter’s apartment through to when Steve showed up at the door, cellphone in hand.
He scanned the crowd of gathered nobles and notable citizens of Malibu. “When do I get to meet Prince Tony?”
Axel Fergus, of course, was there -- dressed fashionably in a muted plaid suit and red-rimmed glasses, giving Tony even more reasons to despise the man. His producer, film crew and assistant art historians were on standby. Tony had assembled his own art crew from the team that secured public art for Stark Industries properties. He had also arranged for an independent evaluator.
She would have found and removed the cricket on her own, thank you very much, and didn’t need Steve.
“I’m going to ignore that you said that as I drink my pretend coffee in my pretend bed in the Savoy Hotel as I wait for my pretend breakfast to be delivered.”
At exactly 3:30 pm Thursday, Natasha sat down in the chair across from Peter at his table in Rafe’s Cafe. She tucked a few strands of red hair behind her ear and sipped her coffee she’d ordered. Then she got right down to business. “I got it, you need space. Well, I need Steve out of Bucky’s apartment and I owe Sam a favor. Stark wouldn’t have been my first choice though.”
“We’ll talk to Fury about that -- he, Rhodey and Natasha will come up with a plan. We’ll make it right.”
Lucky pulled the frisbee off Peter’s bag and upset Tony’s coffee mug all over Tony. Mr. Steve’s face fell when he saw who was on the bench. “Mr. Stark -- I’m sorry --”
“The main factor is whether or not the Wrecking Crew are having a magically juiced-up week. Weather forecast has more snow. Team is worse for wear because of the party. Odds are that they’ll be out for a couple of hours minimum.
Peter had some pride. “I can’t believe I’m talking about this with you. Wait -- does Dad know that you know Steve?”
“A gas version of a love potion,” Tony replied flatly. Steve could picture him eye-rolling at the idea. “In the HVAC.”
At least Cap was competent at the survival game, even if he took risks Tony wished he wouldn’t. One mistake, and someone ended up dead. Tony did not want to be that someone. They needed water and warmth to get through the night. They’d face the food and transportation problem later.
Which would have been fine, he guessed, you know, if Captain America hadn’t been so freaking gung-ho positive and brimful of confidence, working Tony’s last nerve for the past day. And that was before the jeep broke down and the snow came. Even then, Cap managed to be optimistic about the jeep’s chances until Tony declared the jeep dead as a doornail.
After class, when all the students were streaming out into the quad, Thor showered rainbows, glitter and flower petals all over Jan before asking her out with all their friends applauding. Jan was now on her sixth dress design.
He needed help though. Peter needed to find a match for his awesome dad in his limited social circle -- it’s not like he knew a lot of people Tony’s age. There weren’t a lot of options for his dad in his dad’s social circle. Uncle Rhodey would have been his first choice, but Rhodey had been happily seeing Carol for a couple of years now. Then he had to cross Natasha off the list when she mentioned going to a concert with a boyfriend. Plus, Peter had standards about the right person for his dad so it couldn’t be just
Tony thought he was well past the butterflies in the stomach phase. But there on his phone was a text from Steve about meeting up for dinner and Tony felt his stomach take a flip. Then he nearly floated to the bathroom to clean himself up to meet Steve.
Steve liked how Tony’s hair was mussed in a rather attractive way. What would it feel like if he ran his hand through Tony’s hair, just letting each of the strands slip over his fingers? Would Tony look up at him through hair falling over his eyes?
Rosalind had already inspected the art and made her evaluation, though Tony had no idea what she was going to say. “Steve, would you walk us through the pieces?”
Steve still asked him out. He asked Tony out after Tony broke the coffee machine, at the datacrux, in the Tower elevator after a workout. He even asked Tony as Tony was checking Sam’s Ultron report as they walked back to the Tower from the Espresso Express after getting coffee because Tony broke the kitchen coffee machine. Tony was impressed with the efficiency of that particular time loop.
Tony felt like shit immediately. This was important to Steve, very important, he knew that. He’d heard the same deep sincerity each and every time Steve had asked him. And saw the fear in Steve’s face that Tony would say no. It never changed. Not in any of the thirty-one times Steve had asked.
The thing about the superhero life was the time travel. God, it made Steve sick at times to shuttle back and forth to the past, to the future, to dystopian alternate timelines that could be stopped from happening if the Avengers just did this one weird thing. He’d traveled to the end of time once and the very idea made his head hurt thinking about it.
“He fell sick around the time I arrived. Which means -- who has the most to lose if you get married?”
“I could love living here,” Steve said to the cat. “Howard did not come to the garden party or to dinner, but I was told that he keeps to himself these days. He’ll be there for the wedding.”
It’d been a sheer stroke of genius that Steve had asked Tony to join him on his trip to Carson City when he’d been asked to testify about a murder. Soon enough, they’d been caught up in a posse tracking down train robbers all the way to southern California and now they were returning to Timely the long way ‘round on the Old Spanish trail.
Steve had nothing to his name so that was not an issue. He’d been given a week’s worth of clothes, mostly castoffs from Brock, and a set of used wedding clothes from Alexander’s recent fourth marriage. “The wagon came with me.”
Jan gave her an epic eye-roll for the history books. “You need to get cleaned up, the hospital won’t let you in like that.”
Tony suddenly began to twitch and shudder. One of his arms flailed and his body began to stretch like he was being pulled apart as Steve watched in horrified alarm.
And there had been that time when he beat Brock so thoroughly in hand-to-hand combat training that Brock had Steve flogged.
“That’s amazing,” Steve said with pure admiration. “And all the things -- like the running water in the wash rooms? The lighting in the palace? All you?”
Curiosity stamped on his face, Tony reached for them with his beautiful fingers, marked with white scars from work. Slightly brushing their fingers together as Steve handed papers over gave Steve a tiny bit of grounding and reassurance.
“Really?” Tony asked, searching Steve’s face in case Steve was faking it. Deciding that Steve was in fact sincere in wanting to see the workshop, Tony led them back towards the stables.
“Can you work on the engine in the snow?” Cap asked, without a trace of sarcasm or retort in his voice. “You weren’t keen on the jeep’s chances.”
Steve nodded. Here he was trying to stay alive and now he was getting married to a man who turned into a cat. A very cute cat, but a cat nonetheless.
“Yes, you,” and Steve would squeeze his shoulder with his large warm hand and Tony would nearly choke on the air caught in his throat.
As if on cue, Jan and Hank and the women walked out of the restaurant. Hank waved down a cab as Jan rushed over to them. “We’re late to the concert.” She glanced over at Hank. “Look, I told them that you both had Avengers business. I didn’t think you’d want to join us after dinner. I’ll make it up to you both -- I thought that this would be fun.”
There had been a time when Tony would have given anything to forget Steve because of the pain and the loss and knowing he’d never ever talk to him again. Then Tony had. Five years of losing all his friends, his team, his company, all that he’d ever built and earned. Left to rot in the ruins of a family estate. Life had beaten him down, and Steve and all that he meant slipped away from Tony.
