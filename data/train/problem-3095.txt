"No." Castiel said. "I believe you to be a generally good human being, and therefore your memories must mostly be pure."
His eyes travelled upwards to the man's face, and Dean felt his stomach do another small flip. A strong jawline covered in light stubble, slightly chapped pink lips, and tousled black hair were Dean's first indications that the man suddenly standing next to him was unfamiliar. When the man cocked his head slightly, Dean caught his eye and felt his breath hitch in his chest. Framed by thick, dark eyelashes were a pair of icy blue eyes that Dean very quickly found himself staring at. He looked away as soon as he realized because, as much as he would have loved to stare, the two aggressively drunk men in front of him posed a much more immediate problem.
"Ah, well, we agreed it was probably for the best if Ruby took some time out of town." Rowena swirled the liquid in her glass and looked away from Dean to the stage. "I have other dancers that can fill her slot for the time being."
Dean noticed the way she leaned enticingly on the bar as she spoke, shoulders back, chest out in invitation for him to stare. He let his gaze linger for a moment before returning her suggestive smirk.
After creating His archangels, God created the lesser class of angels. These angels were warriors, messengers, healers and guardians of Earth. While less powerful than the Archangels, they were no less devoted to their Father and felt no less love for him or their older siblings. Chief among these lesser angels was one named Castiel. He adored his brothers and his father, and he would spend millenia watching them, idolizing them, and doing all he could to please them. God looked upon Castiel with more hope than all the rest, for God writes stories filled with conflict and confusion, yet a hero will always arise.
"Dean!" Cain exclaimed, turning around and pulling him into a rib-crushing hug. "I didn't think you were gonna show! Everyone else is already here."
"We were all sitting around after I proposed to Jess..." Sam kept his eyes forward, unblinking. "Mom and Dad were so happy. Mom, she couldn't stop talking about colour schemes and napkin patterns. Dad and I were going down to the cellar to get another bottle of wine. He insisted. Said, 'it's not every day your son gets engaged.'" He laughed darkly as they reached the master bedroom, and Sam rested his hand on the doorknob. Dean stopped in his tracks behind him. "He just...dropped, Dean. I didn't even have time to catch him before he hit the floor." Sam looked up, and Dean saw tears brimming in his already red-rimmed eyes. He opened the door to the bedroom, and they both stepped inside.
He regained himself and wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes. Reaching out, he pulled Cas into his arms again. This was okay. He was allowed to do this. There were no monsters that were going to burst through the front door and try to hurt them. This wasn't a dream cooked up by some djinn so it can trap Dean here forever. God, for the first time in his life, wasn't messing with him.
Billie sighed as she placed her clipboard on top of the machine. "He'll probably survive the heart attack, but the fact that his brain was without oxygen for an extended period may mean he doesn't wake up. We'll take it day by day; most patients do recover eventually, but as I always say, pray for the best, prepare for the worst."
"You will know, Castiel. When The Righteous Man falls to pieces in hell, and the first seal of the apocalypse is broken, you will know, and you will fulfill your destiny."
With a final shuddering breath, Dean's dad looked down at him. "Give Sam to me now, Dean. You did good." He reached out and took baby Sammy from Dean's arms and sat next to him on the hood of the car. Paramedics eventually came over and started checking them all for injuries, but Dean didn't answer any of their questions and eventually, they wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and left him alone. His dad put a hand on his shoulder for a moment and squeezed, then they both sat in silence and watched their home burn.
"You remember how everything in the world has to have balance? Heaven and Hell? Me and Amara? Well, this place is a part of that balance. The Empty, it's nothing. It's endless, endless nothing. This place is...well everything. This is where all the worlds I've ever made started. It's where every Sam and Dean that have ever existed have come from. This is where it all begins. You could say, it's my writing room."
Dean waved over Sam's shoulder at John, Mary, and Jess, and gave his brother a nod before turning and heading down the dark sidewalk in the direction of Lee Webb's bar.
"Well, I'll tell you Cas, pure ain't the word I'd use." Dean felt warmth rise in him as he tried to remember fragments of his forgotten life. "But yeah, maybe they aren't all bad."
"Dean," she said, looking him sternly in the eye. "We need to show that we aren't weak. This couldn't have come at a worse time. With Bela's news about the Novaks, a wedding would prove to our enemies that the Winchester bloodline, the Family, is still strong. Your father is the reason we aren't wallowing in the gutter like rats. Without him, those who would seek to destroy us will move against our empire with the forces of Hell behind them." She dropped her hand and, eyes pleading, stepped back.
Chuck smiled and laid his hand over Dean's heart. He could feel every emotion that Dean had ever felt. Every burden, every heartbreak, every fleeting moment of joy, every happy memory. Every desire Dean's heart had ever dared to dream of was laid bare before Chuck's eyes, and he knew exactly the world to create for him.
"I don't understand that reference, but I assume you to be correct in your reasoning." Castiel said seriously. "The process will be long and probably quite painful. They say that mending a soul can often hurt worse that the damage that undid it in the first place, but I promise to make it as pleasant as possible for you."
"No." Dean heard a deep voice say inside his head. "Go back to sleep, little one. Do not get out of bed again, and be thankful you were the first born son..." The door to the nursery slowly closed, hiding the dark figure from view and leaving baby Sammy alone, trapped.
Out of habit, he scanned the crowd and saw a few familiar faces, but thankfully no sparkling blue eyes and no trenchcoats in sight. The brightest source of light came from the rotating floodlights on the main stage. Dean supposed that keeping everything in shadow allowed people to feel more comfortable here. After all, a strip club may be fine and well, but when the money changed hands and gentlemen were lead to back rooms by beautiful ladies, it was best that no one knew each other's names in the morning.
The sudden clatter of a barstool hitting the floor drew Dean's attention to the opposite end of the bar. Two men stood chest to chest, shoving each other back and forth.
"No, just business as usual. Bela is being a bitch, Bobby's still telling the same stories he has for the past 20 years..." He paused before taking another sip of his drink. "Oh, and uh, Sammy's gonna ask Jess to marry him."
As the ape staggered back, clutching his now broken nose, blood streaming down between his fingers, Dean stood up and grabbed the man by his shirt. Together, he and Lee shoved the two towards the bar's door and unceremoniously tossed them into the street.
"The demon pieces held your soul together long enough for me to save you, but they weren't really a part of you,  and therefore they could not be saved...when I cast them out, your true soul, everything that is you, shattered into a thousand fragments. I was able to bring them all together, but..." he paused again. "You are broken, Dean. I have not yet rebuilt you. I can, I will, but it's going to take time. It requires me to manually put you back together using my own grace as glue. I did not realize it would be this arduous of a task, nor that you would be so thoroughly shattered. I am sorry, Dean."
A young woman in her early twenties gyrated and slowly removed her clothes on the main stage to the beat of the rock music blaring through the speakers. Dean couldn't help but watch her as she moved, dark hair falling over pale skin as she thrust her hips sinfully against the stage. Dean once again found his mind wandering, and he forced himself to engage the bartender in conversation as a means of distracting himself.
A small smile lifted the corners of the man's lips as he extended his uninjured hand for Dean to shake.
Dean's shoulders fell. She was right. The news of his father's illness could be kept quiet, but not for long. Word would eventually spread that their patriarch's health was in decline. He looked to his brother, worry deepening the lines on his face, and Dean again felt the familiar stab of guilt twist in his chest like a knife. It should be his burden to bear, the weight of the family's success or failure, not Sam's.
Castiel increased his pace. So that was the real catch. He'd have to stay ahead of Alastair and his roving band of evil,  as well as not upset any other souks or demons along the way. He sighed, holding his injured arm close to his chest. At least he wouldn't have to attempt a battle with such a large group of demons all at once.
"What's the catch?" Castiel asked suspiciously. He didn't trust this demon any more than the rest, probably less actually.
And then Chuck was gone, and Dean was filled with the sensation of falling. When he dared to finally open his eyes again, he was no longer standing in that bright, light filled place, but instead, on the porch of a small house.
Castiel blinked in surprise. "I shared in your memory too, Dean." He said. "The bonding of grace and soul means that every thought, every feeling you have while reliving these moments, I experience too. I have to say, even through just this one exercise, the range of emotion a human, even a child, is capable of feeling is astounding."
Dean shot him a look over the back of the seats, and Benny focussed his eyes back on the road. He felt an immediate pang of guilt. Benny didn't know that he wasn't just pining over some woman with a fake name and even faker tits. He couldn't.
God said, "Look upon man, my angels. They are my greatest creation yet. They are imperfect. They are weak. They are flawed. They are mortal. And yet I have given them a series of gifts with which they will shape this world of Earth on which they have been placed. They can feel fear and pain and loss and hate. They can cry and mourn and regret and hurt. But they can also love. They can forgive and empathize and care and be kind and just and good. They can comfort and learn and heal and laugh and feel pure, innocent joy. They can become ill. They can be injured, and they can die. But most importantly of all, they can choose. I have given them something called free will. They do not answer to me unless they make the choice to, and they will live and breathe on Earth as they see fit, according to their choices."
Dean sighed. "It isn't that, man." He curled his arms around himself. "It's dad. Something's wrong."
"Dean," Castiel said to no one in particular. It was like he was testing the name, rolling it around on his tongue to see how it felt, and when he let it loose from behind is lips in that low growl of a voice, Dean felt his knees wobble, making him very thankful for the stool under him.
When the food and wine had been consumed, John stood again and waited patiently for the conversations to cease. "Thank you all for joining us this evening." He spoke warmly to everyone. "I trust to see you all again next month." A chorus of murmured agreement rippled through those assembled. John raised his glass, and everyone else followed suit. "To the family." He toasted and drained the remaining wine from his glass.
Dean felt the heat rising in his cheeks as he sat back in his seat, and Lee refilled his glass, adding a second one for their new friend. "Thank you." The man said, taking the bag of ice and placing it over his knuckles. He took a small sip of his drink and set it back on the bar top.
Castiel smiled at the memory. "I do Father. It was my first trip to Earth. Lucifer, Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael went with me. We stood in the shallow water of the ocean and watched the waves roll across the sand. Raphael told me that the water moved because of the forces of Earth's moon acting with the rotation of the planet itself as it moved through the cosmos. It was fascinating. Gabriel was splashing Michael and eventually it was just Lucifer and I on the beach. There was a fish in the water. It was a strange creature, and I was young. I moved towards it, but Lucifer stopped me. He said 'Don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish.' We returned to heaven shortly after. I never knew what he meant." Castiel finished recounting the story to his Father, though he knew he didn't have to. Father knew it just as well as he did.
A few moments later he heard his father's footsteps come pounding up the stairs and run down the hall towards Sammy's room. At that moment, he felt the binding around his arms and legs break and he was able to move.
"Well, I suppose it's his well-muscled arms, his gorgeous hair, his tall, strong physique..." She mused, sipping her drink with a smirk.
"Oh Dean...I'm sorry. I've been so cruel to you, and your brother, and Castiel...so many times, so many worlds...I've watched you try and fail and live and die so many times, all for the story. But it was never good enough...the story was never *perfect*..."
He reveled in the feeling, in the bliss of absolute peace, so much so that he almost missed the voice speaking to him through the warm glow of the nothingness around him.
"Chuck?" Dean asked quietly. "Where am I? What is this place? What have you done with Sam? And Jack? And where is Cas?"
"They've taken out three of my warehouses since their arrival, and the attendance at both the craps game and the pool hall is down by thirty-two percent." She sighed, and Dean perked up. He almost wanted to shake the hand of anyone who could cause Bela this much distress, but this was clearly an attack on the family's assets. "Half the shops on Arthur Street aren't paying their fees because the Novaks have started charging them, and when I sent Ruby over to persuade them, she came back bloody and threatening to skip town."
"Why hasn't it been dealt with, Bela?" Asked Sam. "The North shore is your territory, isn't it?" Sam was flexing his powers a little bit, addressing Bela that way. Usually, it would be up to John to chastise her for not taking care of a threat to their operations, but Dean could see the look of pride in his father's eyes at Sam stepping in so willingly.
Dean's young brain couldn't begin to understand what was happening before a warm, wriggling bundle of blankets was being thrust into his arms and he was drawn back to reality by his father's panicked voice.
Dean slowly walked inside and looked around at the house in which he stood. Trinkets of their past adorned the walls and shelves; memories of hunting preserved in stasis, as though they were simply remnants of a time long since passed. On a wall above the mantelpiece were newspaper clippings framed and hung with pride, handwritten letters of thanks from people they had saved, graduation photos and wedding pictures of children who had had the chance to grow up. And in the centre, a photo of five people, together, leaning against Baby, took pride of place on the mantel. Jack kneeled in the front, grinning widely, his innocence and carefree spirit visible. Sam stood next to Eileen, bent low and kissing her cheek as she laughed at him fondly, her arms wrapped protectively around her clearly pregnant belly. Next to them stood Dean, his arm slung over Cas' shoulders, while Cas wrapped one of his own around Dean's waist. His head rested on Dean's shoulder, while his other hand was placed proudly on Jack's.
"What is this?" Uriel asked in awe as Castiel reached his side.  "We were to fight the legions of hell and rescue the righteous man before he can start the apocalypse. This wasn't in the brochure."
The front room was just as it had always been, a monument to excess with gilded fixtures and chandeliers that hung like diamonds from the rafters. Dean closed the doors behind him and called out to the depths of the house.
He was rather tipsy now, and the alcohol sloshed warmly in his stomach as he walked back through the city towards downtown. He wasn't ready to go home yet, but the conversation with Lee had left him feeling less than willing to engage in meaningful human interaction, and he knew there was a strip club a few blocks away that might offer just the distraction he needed.
The sound of chairs scraping back from the table filled the small dining room as the Winchesters and their associates made to leave. They passed the other patrons, enjoying their meals and trying obviously not to stare as the finely dressed men and women filed out the front door, thanking Cain with handshakes and smiles as they left.
Dean's mouth had gone dry. He sat, frozen, hand clasped firmly in the grip of the man in front of him. He was dimly aware of the fact that he had taken far to long to respond, and the look Castiel was giving him now made him even more painfully aware of the knot forming in his stomach.
Something in Castiel's stomach twisted uncomfortably and he suddenly felt I'll. His heart began to ache even more, and he narrowed his eyes at Alastair, who laughed in his face. Castiel turned his face to Dean and noticed that the man had changed back to human now and was beginning to shiver in fear at the feel of Alastair's arm around him.
Dean shook himself and realized the man was still staring at him, and being under his scrutinizing eyes made Dean fidget uncomfortably. He cleared his throat again. "So, uh, you got a name?" He asked. Then, because Dean was not one to relinquish the upper hand, he plastered on his charming Winchester smile and said, "Or am I just supposed to call you handsome?"
Castiel sighed. "It would appear as though your soul is directly related to defining moments in your life, clearly starting with the most significant one, your mother being taken from you by the demon, Azazel." He paused for a moment, allowing Dean time to accept his premise. "By reliving these memories, these moments that combined to make you Dean Winchester, the Righteous Man as chosen by God himself, and by applying my grace to the fractures, I can piece your soul back together and make you whole again."
"The Righteous Man, hey?" He said. "Interesting. Alright Angel, tell ya what? I'm willing to make you a little deal." He smiled at Castiel, which caused something deep the the pit of his stomach to churn in the most unpleasant way. "If you can find the soul you seek and raise him up without me having to see or hear about it, you can take have him. No resistance from us."
Any remaining happiness Dean had from the alcohol was extinguished. His feet stopped moving, and his own voice seemed distant as he spoke. "What's wrong, Sammy? What happened?"
Cas shook his head. "I don't know. I don't believe so. This doesn't feel like Heaven. It feels like...earth. It feels like home…"
Castiel hesitated for a moment "I don't know." he said. "The process of repairing a soul requires a delicate hand, as well as many invocations in ancient Enochian. Not to mention there's the process of stitching the various pieces of your soul together with fragments on my grace, and of course the condition  of your soul before it was ripped apart will have to factor in as well, and then we --
"I know, I know. Things change, people change even more," Lee glanced over his shoulder, the same shit-eating smirk as before stuck on his face, but this time it didn't quite reach his eyes, "you've always been a hopeless romantic Dean, no matter how much you hate to admit it. And I like to think, after all this time, I know you pretty well, sometimes even better than you know yourself."
Chuck continued, "So when I looked into Dean's heart to see what he desired, it was pretty simple. You wanted Sam to have a family, and he does. Sam, Eileen, and little Rowan live in the house next door. By the way, congrats on being an Uncle. You wanted Jack to get to experience life. He's off at college. He's studying world religions and philosophy. Personally, I don't think it makes for great career prospects but, hey, better than being a writer."
"Do you remember, long ago, standing on a beach with your brothers, when Earth itself was still new, and you were but a fledgling angel, barely able to fly?"
"Perhaps because of those Novak boys that Miss Talbot had Ruby go looking into." Her face darkened. "I don't know what she was thinking, but that poor girl came back beat half to death. She was a good dancer, always made a lot of money on her nights..."
"She used to tell us, Sammy and me, that angels were watching over us. Before bed, every night, she'd brush my hair off my face, kiss my forehead and say, 'I love you baby. Angels are watching over you. ' Where was God then, Cas? Why didn't you watch over her then? Why wasn't she protected?"
He reacted in an instant, ducking below the man's outstretched arms and coming up under his knees to flip him over his back towards Lee. He heard the man hit the ground with a thud as Lee reached down and heaved him back up into the edge of the bar. Dean turned just in time to see the other man following his partner towards him, arms reaching out like some great ape. He didn't have the forewarning or space to execute the same move, and so he simply ducked out of reach. As the man's arms closed above his head, he heard the unmistakable sound of a fist colliding with a nose as the cartilage and bone crunched under the force. Glancing to his right, he saw the trenchcoated stranger land a blow directly into the second assailant's face and smiled to himself.
the second thing Dean noticed was that he couldn't see or move, and that immediately made him panic. Had he been returned to the rack? Was he once again bound in chains? Was the cold that only moments ago had brought him joy another torture ploy of Alastair's to give him hope? His mind started frantically searching for an explanation, and he tried desperately to open his eyes, until a feeling of calm washed over him and a deep voice brought him back from his panicked thoughts.
"No." Dean could feel Castiel's presence move away from him, but he remained close by as he spoke. "Broken souls can't enter heaven. A soul must be purified before it can pass through the pearly gates, and yours would not pass the test as it is right now. We are between world's. There is a gap in the existence between time and space. It is difficult to enter here, so I assumed it would be the safest place to rebuild you. There is also a large reserve of untapped energy here I can draw on in order to restore my grace, as I imagine the process will be quite demanding."
"Well, maybe it's a good thing I ran into you then, Cas," Dean drawled. He let his tongue dart out quickly to wet his lips and didn't miss the way Castiel's eyes flicked down at the movement. "I've got some 'varied interests' of my own."
"I can't say that I know too much, honestly." She purred. "But after the incident with Ruby, I did a little research. It would seem that the father, Chuck, had a wife years ago, Naomi, who was killed in some kind of gang war. He became obsessed with revenge and took over a good chunk of Newark, eliminating the gangs, building the communities, doing all sorts of goodwill charity work, all with funds gathered through several nefarious means."
"Dean!" Castiel's firm voice filled Dean's head, dragging him out of the memory of the night his mom died and forcing him gasping back into the reality of his life. "You have to stay focused, Dean. None of these memories are actually happening to you, they're just that; memories." He forced himself to remain composed as the intensity of Dean's emotion rushed through their mind link and hit him like a meteorite.
"Yes." Castiel responded calmly. "You have been delivered from the pit by the will of God. You are safe." he repeated. His voice was rough, cracked and laced with exhaustion, but Dean knew he spoke the truth and this was not another ruse created by the demons to further break him.
Dean huffed in frustration. "Yeah, well, still. He should have saved her instead. None of the other crap that happened to me in my miserable life would have been as bad if she'd been there."
"Rowena," Dean stated simply, rotating his chair to face her as she stepped closer to him. Her red gown caught what little light the club offered and shimmered.
"Son of a bitch...so you're gonna turn me into some weird, angelic, human, hybrid, Frankenstein soul, yeah? And that's going to fix me?" Dean asked the angel.
Castiel travels through the second circle of Hell and finally finds the soul of the Righteous Man, but is he too late to save him?
"Hold on a sec." Dean said. "How'd you know I walked in on him? I mean, it seems like common knowledge to every kind of supernatural freak under the sun how my mom died, but that...that's pretty specific."
His eyes snapped open. In front of him stood Chuck. Dean wanted to feel angry. He wanted to feel hatred towards the man, the God, who had been torturing and toying with him and his brother and everyone they've ever loved through their entire lives...but he couldn't.
Returning his attention to them, Dean rose from his seat and drained the remaining liquid from his glass, vaguely registering that Lee had also rounded the bar and was standing behind him.
It was getting late, and as more people rolled in off the street to escape the rapidly cooling night, Lee became too busy to chat with Dean any longer. He finished the two bottles of beer in front of him, bid Lee a quick farewell with a promise to come back again soon, and walked out into the night.
"You seem like you're in a better mood than a couple hours ago," Benny said, handing Dean a still hot take-out cup of coffee over the back of the seat. He glanced in the rearview mirror and, spying the menacing grin that remained hanging on Dean's lips, he groaned.
With as much remaining grace as he could muster, Castiel disassembled himself and Dean on a molecular level and transported them through time to the safest place he could think of, a place between the world's of Earth and Heaven and hell, far from the reach of Alastair or any of the other angels or humans or demons or anyone. As they traveled through the expanse of the void between space and time, Castiel reached out with the mental link he shared with his brothers and sisters.
"Whiskey. Neat." Dean replied. Lee nodded approvingly, selecting a bottle from the top shelf and pouring a heavy-handed three ounces into a glass. He slid it across the bar to Dean, and he took a sip, letting the liquid burn deliciously in his throat and warm him from the inside out.
"Hey, Sammy!" Dean beamed into the phone, staggering a little on the uneven sidewalk. "So? Did she say yes? Is my baby brother getting married?"
He pulled Cas to him and pressed their lips together again enjoying the moment for all it was worth.
Dean chanced a glance at him from the corner of his eye and caught the small smile still tugging at the corner of his lips. Something in Dean's chest tightened as he wondered what it would be like to see
"I expected I'd be getting a visit from you boys soon." She sighed heavily and waved to Pamela, who nodded and brought her a martini glass of something pink and fruity-looking. "I was hoping it would be Samuel coming to call, but I guess you'll do."
"Somehow, that doesn't surprise me." Said Billie. Dean glowered at her. She turned to address his mother. "I have to return to the hospital. I'll send a nurse by in a few hours to check on him. If any of these machines readings change from what I've noted here, call me immediately. You have my number." Mary nodded, and Billie swept out of the room, shutting the door behind her without so much as a glance at Sam or Dean.
It didn't matter that it was the end of the world. It didn't matter that Dean had spent his entire life fighting against exactly this. It didn't matter that the angels had fallen and Cas and Jack had lost their grace. Because the end of this world means that everything can be made better.
"What's that for?" Dean asked lazily, sipping at the blessed bitterness of the coffee as it warmed his insides and washed the weariness from his limbs, new purpose infusing his veins.
"So, Castiel, do you make a habit of jumping into random people's bar fights?" Dean asked. He motioned to Lee for another round. The alcohol in his veins made him less aware that he was sitting with a potential rival and more aware of how attractive he found the man.
Thus, he found himself in his best suit, pulling open the restaurant's glass door and striding past the host stand like he owned the place. The young woman there gave him a nervous look, and he shot her his most charming smile, causing her to duck her head as a deep red blush crept up her cheeks. He passed by the other tables and made his way to the back of the restaurant, pointedly ignoring the stares and whispers that followed him from the other patrons. He was used to this behaviour.  Anyone who was anyone in the city recognized the Winchesters, and their reputation preceded them.
Gathering his composure with a final deep breath, he willed himself to focus on his surroundings. He still had to find the soul he was sent to save and remove them both from hell. Looking around, Castiel noted almost immediately that this circle of Hell was much less corporeal than the last had been. Whereas before there had been rock walls and cages and solid, tangible aspects the were defining of "hell", here there was void. Everything was bathed in a sickly green light, and while fire still burned with a vengeance in every corner of his vision, there were also electric currents of energy crackling through the clouds of putrid smoke. Castiel was reminded of the inside of a thunder cloud on Earth, though the symbolism was lost in the fact that there was no one else to appreciate it.
I'm trying to write Dean as true to canon as possible. Castiel, on the other hand, has decided he wants to be his own angel and will write himself (stubborn s.o.b.)
"Hey, hey, Sammy, listen, I'm okay." He tried desperately to soothe his brother's worries. The panic in Sam's tone had sobered him, and he transformed immediately into Big Brother. His primary focus was back on protecting his little brother, making sure he wasn't afraid. "Everything is fine. I'm not wasted, just a little buzzed. I'm gonna call Benny for a ride and head back to my place. I'll text you when I'm home and call you in the morning, okay?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine," Lee said, brushing him off. "Guys like that aren't a problem. You and I both know I've fought worse."
"Just a water for now, darlin'," he said. He could feel the whiskey from Lee's slowly soaking into his brain, clouding his judgement.
"That's not what I mean." He said. "If Bela is right and the Novaks are looking to start a war, none of us should be going anywhere alone."
Castiel smiled and his voice softened slightly. "And they say the sense of humour is the first thing to die in hell." For a moment, neither of them spoke. Castiel, marveling at the soul of the man laid bare before him, and Dean, still trying to grasp what was happening to him.
"Please...Cas...help me. I gave in, I gave up. I couldn't take it anymore, I...I took his offer. I came down off the rack." Tears began to spill out from the corners of the man's eyes as he clutched at Castiel desparate ly clinging to the angel. "I'm becoming like them. I can't stop it. Please...take me home. I gotta get back to Sammy...please..." His eyes flashed back to black again and he smirked, letting out a bellowing cry that shook the very bones of Castiel's frame.
He cut the line with a curt nod to the bouncer and walked through the doors into the dimly lit club. Dean felt the tension of the evening evaporate from his limbs as soon as the pervading scent of cherries and tequila washed over him. The black brick walls and tables draped in blood-red velvet made the room feel smaller than it really was. It was hardly past midnight, and yet every table was full of men, mostly suits from the business district here to pretend their sexless marriages weren't failing. Dean snorted. Sam could have his apple-pie life with Jess; at least Dean would never end up like these poor schmucks.
He fidgeted slightly, uncomfortable under his mother's gaze. She knew about his past relationship with Lee, even about the few nights he spent with a man named Aaron after he and Lee had split. While she had never been as violently against his trysts with men as his father, she had never openly expressed approval or support of them either.
She sat forward and touched her husband's forearm gently. "Bela. While I'm sure the loss of your warehouses is devastating, no one would be foolish enough to start a war with our family." She smiled. "And if Ruby and the girls from Rowena's can't handle what is being asked of them, then perhaps it is time to remind them who it is they work for. I'm sure Sam and Dean would be happy to deal with the Novaks, right boys?"
Castiel motioned to the rest of his battalion to assemble around him, and as they did, he received a reassuring glance from Uriel, and a pat on the shoulder.
"I made him an offer he couldn't refuse." Alastair said. "40 years is a long time to stay on the rack, so I made him a deal, same as you. Oh he held out for a long time. Used some pretty creative language to tell me where I could shove my offer too. But in the end," he walked over to Dean and slung an arm over his shoulder, and the two smiled fondly at each other, "he took me up on it. They always do."
Castiel glared at the man in front of him. He didn't even want to be saved. As Castiel opened his mouth the say something, to tell the man he could remain here in hell and burn for his sins for the rest of eternity, the man's eyes changed again. They returned to that glorious green and looked at Castiel with pain and fear.
"Nevermind." Castiel said. "It is irrelevant. What's important is putting you together again. I believe we have found the secret to our success."
His emotions ranged from fear to rage, and he was doing his best to school himself into some manner of togetherness before reaching his parent's home but was failing miserably. He caught Benny glance at him in the rearview mirror.
"Yeah, you always did hate those." Lee whipped the towel off his shoulder and picked up another glass, wiping the water from around the rim. "Anything exciting?"
Lee roared with laughter. "Because you, Winchester, invite trouble wherever you go, and I have seen that look on your face before."
Dean tuned out most of the ensuing conversations. It was the typical discussion of territory, who was responsible for handling the gang activity on the west side, who was collecting from which businesses for protection owed and whether or not they had paid (Dean received a small nod of approval from John when he informed the table that Gordon would no longer be causing issues).
And then, carried on glorious wings of white, he plunged into the pit, as Uriel blew once more through the horn of heaven he carried and the rest followed, blades in hand.
Chuck smiles even bigger now. "See, more than anything else, the thing Dean's heart ached for most, the thing that was going to make him happiest...was you, Castiel. It was always supposed to be you."
"Only the important ones we need to bind your soul. Those of lesser significance should adhere to the grace of their own accord without our having to delve too deeply into them"
"Yeah," he said, squeezing Jess's shoulder into his ribs as he smiled sweetly down at her. "Yeah, I did."
"Wonderful," John said, clapping his hands together, dispelling the tension surrounding the table, and causing Bela to sink back into her seat as her concerns were dismissed. "Now, let's eat before the food goes cold."
Castiel felt something inside his chest crack at the sincerity of the broken man's words. He felt his heart wrench at the pain in his voice and the longing to feel his mother's love once more. Confusion and worry crept into his mind at the emotions Dean's words roused within him, and he tried to push them away as he answered.
"So, it's settled," Mary exclaimed, rubbing her hands together. "Dean, Sam, you two will go to the art auction with Jess and try to identify at least one member of the Novak family."
The city at night always had a certain charm about it that Dean couldn't put his finger on. Maybe it was the way everything lit up a bit more or the fact that the darkness hid the grime that clung to every surface like a second skin, but the alleyways and culverts of the buildings seemed more inviting when they were filled with shadow.
Castiel shook his head. "Father was very clear. He said I would know what to do. I must pass through the flames..." he looked straight into Uriel's eyes. "Alone."
"What'll it be? On the house." Lee spread his arms, gesturing at the impressive selection of alcohol arranged along the wall behind him.
Dean stepped into the street and stretched, breathing the exhaust soaked air deeply into his lungs and once again being reminded of just how much he loved this city. A large hand dropped heavily onto his shoulder, and he turned to find his gargantuan little brother towering next to him.
A pair of strong arms wrapped around Dean's waist and he heard the powerful voice of his father say in his ear, "I gotcha" as he was carried away from the house, still clutching his baby brother tightly to his own small body. Seconds later, the window of the nursery shattered outwards, showering the grass below with glass as the now white hot fire ripped through the rest of their home.
to him?" The question was a double-edged sword. Dean knew she was asking if he had flirted with Cas, used his looks and charisma to make his knees go weak, batted his eyelashes enough to make the man swoon, but if he admitted that openly now, here, in front of his family, there would be no going back.
"Something about them being god-fearing Catholics." He wracked his brain for the details of what Rowena had said. "Apparently, they're ruthless. The dad, Chuck, he all but ran Newark through altruism and selflessness if you can believe it. Left a decent trail of bodies him, though." He collapsed back into the chair next to his father's bedside. The sun would be rising soon, and Dean wished for nothing more than a hot shower and fresh sheets. "He built his family from adopted street kids, plus his own four sons and, get this, they're all named after archangels."
"What's my problem? What the hell is your problem?!" The other responded, punctuating his words with a shove to the man's shoulders.
Uriel stared at Castiel, his youngest brother, his commander, and his eyes were filled with sadness. He knew his brother was stubborn beyond compare and that once his mind was made up, nothing could stop him. "I could go with you?" he said, though he knew it was in vain.
"I want...I want to be happy…" He said, eyes slipping shut in the warm glow of The Everything that surrounded him.
"Does that mean, I'm no longer just an 'honorary Winchester'?" Said Castiel from far too close. Dean looked up and his breath caught in his throat as he realized that Cas had crowded into his space in the not-unpleasant way that he had long gotten used to. His blue eyes were twinkling with something akin to joy as Dean regained his composure.
"Well, well, well..." Dean heard the unmistakable accent drawl from behind him. "A Winchester. Alone in my club. To what do I owe the honour?"
A beautiful woman with wavy brown hair rose from the table, and Dean rolled his eyes, huffing dramatically into his chair. Bela Talbot was always trying to draw attention to herself at these meetings, and tonight would be no exception. She wasn't, strictly speaking, part of the Family, but she was part of a necessary evil alliance that the Winchesters had forged years ago to have hands in the art trade, and Dean had found her to be nothing but a nuisance ever since.
Dean groaned. "Great. So now I'm sharing my most personal intimate moments with some angel-dude I just met. Perfect."
"I'd hurry if I were you Angel. Like I said, I don't want to see or hear about you again while you're down here. Hell's a big place and all but let's just say I move pretty quickly."
Castiel did as he had been told. He maintained his garrison on Earth. He remembered what Father had told him, still not understanding His final words, yet never forgetting. Until one day, Castiel awoke as if from a dream.
"Mom? Sam?" It was late, and, under normal circumstances, he would never have disturbed the silence.
What did Lee know? So what if he thought the dark-haired, blue-eyed man in the trenchcoat was cute? He was a Novak, and if Bela was to be trusted - which he quickly reminded himself was questionable - that made him the enemy. Still...Dean found himself thinking more and more explicitly about Castiel as he continued to walk.
The two men in front of him hesitated slightly before one of them let out a yell and charged towards Dean.
He ran to his bedroom door as fast as his little legs would carry him, ripped open the door and tore down the hallway. From inside his little brother's room, he could see smoke, smell fire, and hear his dad calling out his mom's name. When he reached the door, he saw his father grabbing his brother out of the crib, the entire room almost engulfed in flames. Dean looked up and saw, stuck to the ceiling above the crib, eyes staring at him filled with tears, mouth pulled open in a silent scream, stomach split open and bleeding, and completely enveloped in flame, the final image of his mother.
"I am sorry, Dean." He said somewhat crestfallen. "Perhaps your redemption should have been carried out by a different angel. Michael, or Gabriel. They would have been better suited to this task than I..."
She laughed. "I dabble. But tonight's not my night. I get off around three though, and uh, well, if you're still around, maybe you can too." She winked at him before being called down the bar. Dean watched her walk away, the sway of her hips capturing his attention.
He made his way past the kitchen, stopping briefly to say hello to Cain, clapping him on the shoulder.
"You think he's cute, and you wanna feed him shots until he's drunk enough to let you blow him behind the dumpsters at Antoni's on 64th St." Lee raised an eyebrow as Dean choked on his mouthful of beer.
Dean wanted to scream, wanted to cry out for his Mommy and Daddy to help Sammy. That there was a bad man in his room and they needed to come, quickly! But he couldn't. His mouth was stuck shut and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't make a sound. He felt himself turn away from the door, away from his parents room, and silently walk back down the hall to his own. He went inside, closed the door with a quiet click behind him, and sat on the edge of his bed, eyes wide in silent terror. It was like he had been put under a spell, he couldn't move or talk on his own no matter how hard he fought against whatever it was that was controlling him.
"You wanna tell me what's wrong, brother?" Benny asked, his cajun accent filling the cab of the vehicle.
The door to his bedroom had been left open slightly to the hallway outside and Dean walked slowly, quietly towards it an peeked his head out. The hallway was dark, but Dean could tell something wasn't right. He needed to find his Mommy and Daddy. He stepped out of his room and started walking slowly down the hallway towards their room, being careful not to make a sound as he went so he didn't wake up his baby brother Sammy.
At the battle cries of the Angels and the horns of heaven they blew, the demons turned their faces upwards and snarled en masse. There were hundreds of them, all covered in the blood of the humans they were slowly driving to madness, all grotesque and terrifying, even to the Angels who now confronted them in their own domain. They began their ascent up the walls of the pit towards the heavenly creatures, intent on their destruction.
Dean opened his eyes and looked around. He had heard something in the dark, and it had woken him from sleep, a thump or bump in the night that he couldn't identify. He sat up in bed, covers falling from his pajama - clad shoulders and pooling around his waist.
The woman fixed him with a stare that made Dean shrink back slightly. Her coal-black mane of hair seemed to crackle with intensity as she appraised him. "His brain couldn't breathe." She replied bluntly.
The tires crunched on the driveway's gravel as Benny pulled the car around the ornate fountain that sat at the base of the stairs. Dean unbuckled his seatbelt and threw open the door when it came to a stop.
"I can help with that." Jess piped up from where her head rested sleepily against Sam's chest. "My parents are holding an art auction in a few days. It's a charity fundraiser for some west coast non-profit, but they're expecting a big crowd. If the Novaks are involved in art at all, they'll be there. I could put Sam and Dean on the guest list..." She looked nervously between Mary and Sam.
Chuck stepped closer to Dean, the smile on his face not malicious or spiteful, but benevolent and kind, the way God should have been from the beginning. Dean allowed himself to be taken in by his words. He listened and tried to comprehend, but it was like he was hearing Chuck through a fog, the sense of his words just out of reach…
Thank you to everyone who read and enjoyed the last chapter. Your comments were all so kind and meant so much to me. I know I said chapter 2 would be up on Tuesday, but I couldn't wait anymore. As always, if you wanna chat, send me a message on
"Alastair," He responded. "Coordinator of Torture, Penance, and Pain. I know, it's a wordy job title, but when you're so damn good at what you do, well...the big wigs just keep asking for more." He smiled at Castiel, showing a row of sunken teeth. "Tell me, Angel, why are you here?"
Castiel balked at the confidence of this demon. He had to remind himself that he had no dominion over Hell, and angels did not descend this far into the realm of darkness. He was alone, out numbered, and not at full power.
Castiel could feel nothing but heat and pain as he pushed himself through the vortex of fire that claimed the space between the second level of hell and the first. Time became an immeasurable concept and though his passage only took about a minute, it began to feel like days had passed since leaving Uriel. As he pushed forwards, he could hear the voices of souls again, still begging to be saved, to be set free, but he could also hear...laughter?
The Angels looked on God with reverence, for only their father could have created a being that was so perfect in the image of the love that he had given to them.
"Right, yeah. Dean Smith," He introduced himself, and he didn't miss the look from Lee who, mercifully, did not comment at his use of a pseudonym. "Sales representative with Sandover Enterprises." He smiled.
And then God was gone. Castiel cried out for his Father. The host of angels returned to the great hall of heaven and called for him, but God was nowhere to be found.
Dean's smile faded as quickly as it had appeared. Ruby was savage in the art of 'persuasion,' and he could hardly imagine anyone getting the better of her. He leaned forward, his brow furrowed. A new family trying to start a war with the Winchesters? The last time that had happened, Dean was a teenager, and, much to his dismay, his parents had insisted he not be involved. He had watched helplessly from inside the Catholic boy's school his father had shipped him to, as his people were shot in the street.
Chuck raised a hand to silence him. "Save it. You write your own stories now. I'm not the author any more. I'm just a fan." And again, he was gone.
Mary's expression when she rounded on Dean was nearly unrecognizable from before. Her eyes, which had moments ago held the icy cold of resolve to protect her family, now burned with a fire of reproach that Dean felt pierce into his soul.
The man laughed. "God? Righteous Man? Listen up Angel, I dunno what kind of crazy shit they've been telling you up in Heaven,  but I sure as hell ain't no righteous man. I'm Dean frickin' Winchester. I've done a lot of bad things topside, including sell my own soul to a demon. Explains why I'm down here now, doesn't it?" he chuckled again  "Far as God goes, well, I guess I don't believe in fairy tales anymore. Way I see it, if there really was a God, half of these sorry son's of bitches wouldn't even be here." He returned to stand in front of Castiel and smiled wickedly again, looking him up and down slowly, biting his lower lip. "So tell me Angel, why would you wanna save my soul in the first place?"
"I could unbind my consciousness from yours if you would prefer." Castiel said. "We would no longer be able to communicate, but I would also not be intruding on your memories."
It wasn't long before the battle sounds receded above him and he began to wonder if Nithael had been mistaken, for not only was Uriel nowhere to be seen, but the frequency of his encounters with the hellish creatures had also begun to decrease. He slowed his pace and gripped his blade tighter, alert to all that was near. Around him the souls of the damned reached forward and grasped at him, clawing at his wings, grasping at his feet, crying, pleading with broken voices and eyes that had long forgotten what it was like to gaze upon beauty. Their requests for mercy were denied however, as Castiel had only one soul he was here to save.
Behind him, in the doorway of the small house, stood Castiel. Dean lurched forward, his feet moving of their own volition and embraced the man before him. He breathed in everything that was Castiel. The faint scent of cinnamon and watermelon filled his nostrils as he wrapped his arms around Cas' shoulders and buried his face in his neck, holding onto him like he was the last tether binding him to earth. Dean stepped back and looked at his angel, reverence and confusion in his eyes.
"Yes, mother," Dean said through his smirk. He squeezed her shoulder assuringly and looked at his father. I will make you proud, he thought.
"No, I can't say that I do," Castiel replied. "But I'm new in town. And I like this bar. I would rather it not be sullied by unsavoury company." He thanked Lee with a nod as he placed down two bottles of beer on the bar.
"Aw, you're no fun," the bartender pouted, placing a glass in front of him and filling it with water from the gun attached to the bar. "What, are you some kinda teetotaler or something?"
"Novak, huh? What is that, Serbian?" He grinned at the surprised look that crossed the face of the other man.
"I, uh, I met one of them already. Tonight. At Lee's." He gulped as the fire in Mary's eyes flared, then dissipated. "Castiel. I assume he's one of the adopted kids."
"Yeah, I told him you were pissed; what the hell is going on?" He climbed the stairs and followed his brother through the winding halls of the second floor, their heavy footsteps muted by the plush carpet underfoot.
"You imagine?" Dean asked, an edge of worry creeping into his voice. "Hey Cas, uh, not to rush you or anything but, how long do you think this is gonna take anyways?"
The truth was, Dean didn't even know if he wanted kids. He'd thought about it, sure, and his mother had been pressuring him since his mid-twenties to find a nice girl to make babies with, but Dean liked his hang-up free lifestyle. He was happy to carry out orders for his father, help the family, and maybe hustle a few out of town suckers at pool when the mood struck him. Sam was business-minded, and Dean was more than happy to allow his not-so-little little brother to take over for their father when the time came.
Dean looked up at Cas, his eyes narrowed, head tilted to the side, and yeah, Dean thought, maybe this was how he would have written the world if given the chance.
"Dear Castiel." God said warmly. "You have always been so loyal, so eager to please me and do my bidding, unquestioning, undoubtful, unerring in your adherence to orders. The perfect soldier."
He then created Heaven and the Angels that would inhabit it, for God was lonely in the great expanse of the cosmos, and he had plans for which we would require their assistance. First, God created the archangels, Lucifer, Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Together, these four angels became the guardians of the heavens. They loved their father and were devoted to him with all their being, none moreso than Lucifer, who was the most beautiful of all the Angels, and whose heart was filled with light and adoration. Michael was the most powerful of the four, and would come to command the highest ranks of the armies of heaven in the many battles they would fight against the legions of hell and darkness. Gabriel was the Trickster. He reveled in the laughter of his father and siblings, and his power came from joy. Gabriel's heart was filled with happiness, and while not as mighty as Michael in raw strength, he would still come to lead a great host of heaven in time. Raphael was the gentlest and kindest of the four. He was the healer, the protector, the saint. He would come to protect those who found the word of God, the prophets and the seers, and he would do so by any means necessary.
Dean smiled to himself, thinking of the ring currently sitting in Sam's pocket. Jess would be an excellent addition to the family. Her parents were both high profile talent agents on Broadway with a lot of influence there and in Hollywood. There had never been a reason for the Winchesters to get into theatre, but he knew they wouldn't turn down the opportunity if Jess said yes to Sam tonight. His smile faltered slightly. It had been a long time since Dean had been as happy as Sam was now. His last relationship had been with Lisa Braeden, and that had only lasted a few months. She had a young son, Ben, who Dean still saw on occasion, but he had left when things had started to get really serious. He wasn't going to drag someone else's kid into this mafioso life. It wasn't his place.
"Yeah, well, brother or not, he's still a giant pain." Dean downed the rest of his drink and tapped the rim for a refill. Lee shook his head but complied.
"Castiel..." he said, "you don't know what will happen if you pass through those flames. Angels were not made to enter Hell. Our forces are weakened as it is. Many of our comrades have fallen and we are not as strong here as we are above." Uriel looked solemnly at Castiel. "Perhaps...perhaps Father was mistaken? Perhaps you misunderstood His will..." His eyes pleaded silently with his brother not to continue, to return with him to heaven, to leave the soul of the Righteous Man to suffer.
"Alright, well, have at 'er then." Dean said. "Speaking of, where is 'here' anyway? I mean, I know I can't see, but I get the feeling you didn't bring my broken ass back to Earth, and we sure as hell aren't in...hell, anymore, so what? Heaven?" Dean asked.
He chuckled at his own joke. Dean's heart grew fuller with every word Chuck spoke. Sam had a house, and a wife, and a son. He had a nephew. Jack was living a normal life at college…
"Nah, man, I was thinking about heading over to Lee's," Dean said. His head was foggy from the wine, and he needed some real liquor to bring his senses back.
"Oh, is Sam freaking Winchester scared of a few Jersey boys?" Dean snarked at his brother, punching him in the arm playfully. "I'll be fine. Besides, it's Lee's bar. I'm basically royalty there."
The Angels wept. God had abandoned them. They had lost their Father. Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael urged them to follow the orders that God had given them before he disappeared; to observe and protect man as He had bidden them, and many of them followed the three archangels to Earth. But Lucifer did not agree.
