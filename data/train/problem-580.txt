Sherlock whispered the last part conspiratorially, but John heard anyway.
“My experiences with the drug are a bit of a deviation from the norm.” He tried to keep his voice steady. He needed to believe that he could distance himself from the words he was speaking. These were facts. Nevermind his shaking hands.
A large poster of the periodic table hung proudly on the wall opposite the makeshift lab table. It had obviously been there a long time as the edges were beginning to curl back from the wall. John could just make out the form of a map beneath it. Upon closer inspection, he was able to identify several landmarks connected by a dotted line ending in a red X. His heart lurched at the thought that he was currently standing in what could only be Sherlock's childhood bedroom. His mind filled with imaginings of his friend as a curly-haired young boy running through the fields around the manor with a wooden sword, an eye patch, and a lumpy sweater he only wore as a concession to his long-suffering mother. It saddened John to see that the treasure map had been intentionally pasted over. It seemed to indicate a rather abrupt change of heart, though John noted that Sherlock had not removed it altogether. It was like catching a rare glimpse of the beating heart of the man normally kept well-hidden beneath a wall of logic and reason.
"You really weren't paying attention at all, were you?"
John watched Sherlock’s throat work for a moment.
Of course. He was a scientist. His mind was an endless stream of questions needing answers. But it seemed like John had a more specific query in mind.
Stephen yanks his head out of Iain’s grasp and turns to face the man.
“Right. Well there is a big difference between wanting and doing, at least in my experience, so I have to ask. Do you want to be,” John swallowed heavily, “ physical…um, with me?”
“Bored. Frustrated. Eager for a new case. In his mind, he’s solved this one.” John held up a hand to stop the DI, who had opened his mouth to argue.
John paced the length of the room several times, his arms swinging in time at his sides. On his fifteenth circuit, he stopped on the far side of the room and gripped his hair.
John’s gaze was sharp, reading what he could from Sherlock’s face. “And what was the desired effect?”
John draws himself as tall as he can to cover more surface area.
John checked his watch as he jogged around the corner, The Windsock Arms pub coming into view. He was already thirty minutes late. John could only hope that Greg had been slammed at work and was also running behind.
“We have left the realm of charted medical science, John,” he began. “You are aware of Sherlock’s association with James Moriarty and the drug Hypno-rophenol. I believe my brother went as far as to allude to the unique effect it had on him; however…”
John looks like he is about to argue, so Sherlock jumps in again.
"I'm here. You’re safe. I promise, Sherlock. You're safe."
Sherlock paces the sitting room as he waits for a reply. He can hear John muttering to himself as he slams dresser drawers. He lets out an inadvertent chuckle at the
Sherlock was still skirting the edges of panic he could feel welling up inside himself. The facts had not changed. M was still out there, demanding Sherlock’s presence at what would undoubtedly be a disaster. But the minute John had found him in that dank alleyway, the truth had become clear to him again in a way that left him ashamed at his lapse. Time and again, John continued to show Sherlock that he was not alone. He only hoped that was a dedication John would continue to feel no matter what M planned to initiate.
[TEXT] Fucking American.
Suddenly, the pieces slot into place, and John can see where Sherlock’s logic is leading them.
She gives him a knowing, indulgent look as she sets the plate on their counter, staring mutinously at the bacteria cultures and microscope hogging the kitchen table.
phone call that I would never manipulate your feelings again. I have endeavored to do so ever since, and I think I have done an admirable job, if I may say so. Therefore, you can’t possibly fault me for thinking that I was doing right by leaving you out of this.”
"You're safe, Bee."
“Look. I don’t really know what is going on, but you clearly don’t want me to touch you. So, I won’t okay? I promise. Can you talk to me?” John hoped the sincerity he felt was translating in his tentative expression.
"That does not mean that the undertaking is hopeless, however. It just requires more time for us to dig and explore more tenuous connections."
A voice echoes through the empty warehouse. Sherlock concentrates and determines that the person is on the floor above him, so he cranes his neck to attempt to pinpoint their location.
“Not the point, Sherlock.”
Sherlock placed his hand over the crook of his arm to press the cotton swab tighter to his elbow. The bleeding should have almost stopped at this point. Without thinking, John reached for his arm already mentally running through his checklist for treatment.
Both of their heads snap toward the entrance of 221B as the door swings open.
Behind him, John can hear the high-pitched whines of Iain and Stephen, who hadn’t even made it to the bed. Stephen has Iain pinned against the wall, but Iain is pulling Stephen against him with every thrust. Stephen will have fingernail marks on his ass tomorrow. Iain chuckles darkly at the thought. Stephen claims his mouth with another searing kiss as he rocks into him and comes, gasping and cursing.
Mycroft’s head rested back against the seat and his eyes slipped shut. “Yes.”
He moved to unhook the IV, but Mycroft quickly stayed his hand.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Poison.”
No one looked at Sherlock like that. Most people at the Yard begrudgingly accepted his utility, though Lestrade often seemed to be genuinely grateful for his help. No one looked at him as if the flesh and blood and bone that comprised Sherlock was worthy of appreciation as anything other than an unwieldy flesh vessel for his extraordinary brain.
“I’m no one’s property asshole.”
“You remember.” He sounded pleased. M picked up his own fork and speared a large piece of lettuce. “You can be so beautifully compliant when you try.” M placed his fork on the edge of his plate while he chewed.
The hand tremors are a painful reminder of darker earlier times and a different doctor who was running from his past. The man in front of him is running too. That is clear from the set of his jaw, but it’s impossible to determine what he’s running from without more information. He is a detective after all, not a psychic, no matter how much John argues otherwise.
“Of course they haven’t,” John replied, barely concealing a glimmer of fondness.
John’s fist clenched at his side.
Sherlock starts to hyperventilate as he looks over the bread selections again. John has never been picky, but Sherlock has no idea about Mary. Does she have any allergies? Does she have to avoid gluten? She is prone to baking her own bread. Will she be offended if Sherlock buys some? His head spins and the fluorescent lights blaze bright.
John called after her.
“Of course,” he growled. “Leave it to that insufferable, interfering, overblown desk-jockey to stick his fat nose in where it doesn’t belong.”
John pushes back, arching into Sherlock’s space, refusing to be intimidated. A brief moment of vulnerability flashes in Sherlock’s gaze before the stony unreadable void is back.
John goes still in the background, and Mary smirks as Sherlock goes white.
“That can’t be right,” John murmured, grabbing the photo and angling it to see better in the dim light. Sherlock beamed at John, thrilled that he had picked up what half of Scotland Yard had not. Lestrade, fidgeting and impatient, crowded behind them to look as well.
“That was the night my whole life changed, you know?”
“But you said he was dead.”
John’s face pulls back as he walks away from the camcorder. He’s situated it so that he can sit on the sofa and be in frame. John sits and clasps his hands on his lap. He looks nervous. After a few moments, he draws his shoulders back and looks directly into the lens.
“Have you heard from Sherlock lately?” Greg’s voice was carefully measured in the way that always set John’s teeth on edge. He had cultivated a voice just like that. It was the voice he used to deliver bad news to patients and family members. Greg’s voice lacked the calculated nonchalance required to pull it off though. John swallowed.
Not that it mattered. Sherlock didn’t give any credence to such things, but it was nice to know that he needn’t wait around for some faceless spectre to swoop in and steal John away.
"I didn’t know, John. I swear. I didn’t know."
“Definitely more than he’s admitting. We think five so far.”
– Sherlock reminds himself, smiles knowingly and gestures at himself in a
Sherlock leans forward to kiss John. His lips curl into a smile as he baits the fourth man.
“Sherlock.”
“But then Jim died and his network splintered. A lot of people got desperate…”
He burrows his head into Sherlock's long pale neck and nuzzles.
Still, he couldn’t help but linger over John’s surprising response to his erratic behavior. Sherlock had locked away emotion for good reason. Somehow his feelings were always too big, too loud, too sharp, too inconvenient, too wild until…
Sherlock felt a frisson of want spike along his spine as John let out a series of high-pitched giggles. That was a sound he wanted to preserve forever. John Watson, army doctor and blogging luddite,
undoing. Sherlock knew. After all, who falls in love with a broken thing?
“You’re sorry for how you treated me when? Today? Yesterday? At the symphony?”
“Hmm?”
for you,” John sneered in a passable imitation of the irritable detective.
Sherlock wasn’t sure he understood the question.
Sherlock's forehead creases as he tries to figure out how Mary introduced the toxin if John wasn't eating at home.
Sherlock sighs and continues.
“Is that what this is? Desperation, Mary?”
together.”
Stephen rasps. John cries out as Sherlock’s finger dances over his prostate.
Sherlock raises his fist to knock, but the door swings open before he can make contact. Taken aback, Sherlock withdraws his hand and wraps his coat tighter around himself. Greg smiles at the detective’s uncharacteristic surprise.
Sherlock took it all in. He let John batter himself against Sherlock’s defenses. Mycroft was right compassion would kill him. The length of the seat may as well have been an ocean. This empathy would drag him under.
Piercing blue-grey eyes swiveled to meet John’s. He could see something swimming behind the look, but it was folded away much too quickly for John to identify it before Sherlock turned his attention back inside his own head.
“Good? Absolutely not.”
His head was still pinned back by M’s grasp, so he looked down at M through his lashes and saw his predatory grin. It made his blood run cold, though his body was flush with arousal.
"What?"
“I don’t keep needles to hand, John. I am a recovering addict, remember?” Sherlock’s voice was harsh, but John suspected that was to keep the broken edge of want out of it more than true anger. His chest heaved for a moment. Then, he remastered control of himself, and he continued, gentler now.  “Wiggins brings the needles every other week. I mix the antidote, and he administers it.”
This seemed to snap John out of his stupor. The tension left his face as affection suffused the slack surface. He didn’t move for a minute. Sherlock could tell he too was thinking about the first time they had met. That had been years ago now.
. He’d figured there would be plenty of time for admonishments when he got home. But he’d returned to an empty Baker Street in the early evening. As evening rolled into night, John had started to grow concerned by Sherlock’s continued absence. There couldn’t have been any new leads on the case, and if there were, why would Sherlock have left him behind?
His denial dissipated as Sherlock’s torso began to convulse. His body was wracked with the strength of his own despair.
A noise like a gunshot rent the silence and both men jumped. John prowled into the sitting room, automatically assessing danger and clearing the room. By the time his brain caught up and realized the noise was most likely a cat getting into the bins out back, Sherlock had disappeared into his room and shut the door.
Then, he opens his eyes.
Sherlock flicked back the sheets and made to get out of the bed.
“Lestrade clearly has somewhere to be, John. He can’t afford to hang around here waiting for Anderson to activate the few unaffected brain cells that remain in his skull. The crime scene techs have been thorough with their photographing of the scene. Not that they were particularly insightful. They took images in a rough grid so as not to miss anything. However, in this case, their dogmatic approach has paid off. Look here,” Sherlock brandished one of the photos at John.
“Honestly, I didn’t really understand a word of it. You probably would though. Something about a sanctum and surgery and sorcery. Who knows? It was just catching up over a coffee. But it did get me thinking.”
"It’s not mine. Well, it's from me but it’s not mine, technically."
Sweat dripped from Sherlock’s brow, and John’s face was red with arousal as he fucked into Sherlock’s fist. He whined, high and needy, and Sherlock gave him what he needed. He ran his palm over the head of John’s cock, smearing his precome over the shaft. The result was a tight, wet slide that had John cursing.
John’s face paled as he took in the facts before him. Mycroft Holmes sat in the seat opposite, and although his posture and demeanor were par for the course, there were noticeable signs that something was amiss. First of all, Mycroft’s perfectly tailored suit was askew. The trousers were wrinkled and creased from sitting. His waist coat was half unbuttoned, a detail John could only see because Mycroft was not wearing his suit coat. The coat was folded on the seat next to him, and his tie was lying across it as if Mycroft had simply cast it aside. His shirt had several buttons undone at the top and his hair was a mess, as if he’d been running his hands through it.
“There is nowhere else I would rather be, Sherlock. We could be at our flat or on the trail of a counterfeiter in Frankfurt or in a bloody rubbish skip in Brixton. It doesn’t matter to me so long as I get to be there with you.”
“Sorry,” he said flatly. “I’ve got to go as well. Lot’s to do today.” John fled the backseat and hurried down into the basement of the building. He knew exactly where he would find Sherlock. He turned a corner and heard Sherlock’s voice coming through an open door into a lab at the end of the corridor.
“What I’m trying to say is that I miss you. More than anything. I want things to be the way they were. I want us to be together, really together. I want to come home after a long day and find you there. I want to sleep next to you. I want to make you breakfast and tea. I want you to teach Rosie ridiculous things I won’t agree with. I want to hear Bach again – don’t think I haven’t worked out what that means.”
The admonishment is without heat. John runs his hand up Sherlock’s back, feeling smooth silk shift against Sherlock’s skin. At the top of his spine, John gently pulls Sherlock’s neck to rest their foreheads together. He looks at Sherlock’s full lips, dry from the concentration-generated repetitive swipes of Sherlock’s tongue all afternoon. The image sends John’s stomach swooping.
He swallows hard and gives a firm nod. Sherlock understands immediately. He rises from his chair and paces across the flat. He will treat this like just another case, though it is anything but. John won't be able to completely detach, but he'll appreciate Sherlock's effort to keep it as impersonal as possible.
“There are many things I want to say to you – have wanted to say for a long time now, but I never knew where to begin. After a while, I realized the futility of trying to keep anything from you and assumed you already knew. I imagined you’d figured it out from the way I folded the dish towels or the way I combed my hair. I see now how unfair that was.”
Mycroft had all but confirmed that Sherlock had met with Moriarty. Given the information Sherlock had shared with John about his past, and the details Mycroft had provided about the psychology of the man, John’s sickening suspicions were beginning to grow. That knowledge combined with Sherlock’s aversion to touch, an aversion John had only ever seen in conjunction with the hypno antidote, set cascading alarms off in his head. He was a doctor after all. As a medical student he’d been through a sexual assault and trauma rotation where he was taught to track signs and spot tells. Sherlock’s current behavior was fairly textbook.
“John.”
John's chest is heaving as he breathes hard. Sherlock curses the day John convinced him to explain the subtler points of chess strategy. His voice is soft and genuine when he replies.
Using what little he could see through the nearby windows, John charted the course most likely to lead him in the direction he needed to go. It had been a long time since he’d had cause to use his wilderness skills. He was surprised to find himself so rusty. He’d become complacent, happy to follow in Sherlock’s wake as the git led the way.
It was wrong. Everything was wrong. John wasn’t excited about the case. He wanted to stay home. Why? That wasn’t John. John loved the cases. He loved it when Sherlock swanned around being a prat, only sharing information once he’d worked out the next three steps so that Lestrade always felt helplessly behind.
The ride is not long and Sherlock tips the cabbie who helps carry a few of the bags to the porch. Sherlock unlocks the door and slips inside once the cab has driven away. The entranceway leads to a cozy sitting room. Mary's influence is clear. There are no dark colors or tall-backed chairs here. The room is a gentle sea-foam blue. The simple domesticity of it claws at Sherlock's throat. He hurries into the kitchen and shelves all the groceries. It is not hard to figure out their storage system. Dry goods in the pantry, crisps above the stove, perishables in the fridge. It's all pretty standard.
Sherlock breathes and allows some of the uncertainty to bleed into his expression. A good sign that he is listening. John kisses the tip of his nose, making him blink shyly.
“Most of it. You want to marry John, but you don’t know how to ask him. That about right?”
He heard the rustling of John removing his jacket, but he didn’t turn to look. He felt unmoored. He wasn’t sure where to start. The floor groaned as John moved further into the sitting room. Sherlock could make out a weighted thudding. He heard John’s knee creak as he squatted down, and a long sharp zip of sound…
Without a glance back, Sherlock waltzed down the hall and into the bathroom. Before shutting the door, he raised his voice enough for John to hear:
"Yoo-hoo!"
Iain doesn’t need telling twice. He kicks off his shoes while pulling his shirt over his head and looks Stephen up and down as he undoes his fly.
“Good. Then, is it a physiological issue. I mean, can you not - ?” John gestured at his groin, trying to convey the question without embarrassing Sherlock.
John hates the formality that clings to Sherlock. It's clear in his words and the tense line of his neck as he bears it high. His face is purposefully blank and his eyes are glacial. John can hardly stand it. He takes the box from Sherlock and lets his fingers brush the detective's hands. Sherlock jerks away from the touch and almost sends the cake toppling to the floor in his haste to get away. John's forehead crinkles but he doesn't comment. He points Sherlock toward the back patio where he's already laid out a tray.
He could just text him the details. Sherlock knew John would meet him there. He always did. But something unsettled made Sherlock’s insides squirm at the thought of doing that today. Strange.
“Better,” his Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, “I think.”
that?”
But the man remained eerily silent. John’s heart dropped as he contemplated the idea of Sherlock having a boyfriend he did not know about. Had he missed his opportunity without even knowing it was an option?
The thought frightened him. He wasn’t afraid of John. Not at all. John wasn’t the one who needed to be protected. A wave of bitter anger washed over him as he indulged his own selfishness. John was selfless, kind, and caring, but he was not without his limits. There were more than a handful of offences Sherlock knew his flatmate would not tolerate - lying, leaving, cutting John out- any one of those actions would push the doctor too far.
Mycroft shook his head quickly. “No. Moriarty knew he survived. He was livid that my brother had tried to deprive him. There was an altercation in Sherlock’s hospital room. Apparently, Sherlock told him that he would never stop trying to take his own life if Moriarty insisted on being a part of it.” Mycroft’s lip curled in dogged admiration. “Don’t you see, John? He left Moriarty with a choice. A world without Sherlock in it or a world where Sherlock lived a life independent of Moriarty.”
“Who is that?” John asked. His heart raced at the very thought of that man within a hundred yards of Sherlock. But with Mycroft’s previous questioning, John was certain this man had played a large role in his friend’s past. How had he never come up?
Sherlock felt his mouth curve into a small smile and decided not to fight it. He was immediately rewarded with a grin that could have lit all of London.
Sherlock waited for John’s inevitable rage. He waited for the shouting and stomping, but it never came.
John could see how he thought that, given the fact that the cab door had been flung open before the car had fully stopped. “Nah, mate. He’s just late for work is all. Here ya go,” John said handing over the fare. The cabbie accepted the bills and thanked John for the tip, chattering on for several minutes while John fought the urge to just leave. He couldn’t bring himself to be so rude, but he couldn’t listen to the man yammer any longer.
John reached forward to tangle their fingers together, gripping tightly. Sherlock wanted to take comfort in the gesture. He wanted John to hold even this small piece of him. He knew that if there was one safe place in this world, it was under John Watson’s hand.
“Oh, Sherlock.”
“What did you think would happen if I saw you, Sherlock?”
John sank down, one hip pressed against the arm of the sofa. As soon as he was situated, Sherlock tipped sideways and rested his head in John’s lap. He turned his head and nuzzled affectionately against John’s stomach. His low baritone was barely audible as he spoke against John’s shirt.
“My brother!” Sherlock’s eyes flashed with anger. “Tiresome meddling idiot! I specifically requested you not be involved, but does he ever listen to me? Of course not!”
Sherlock’s lip quivered with barely contained humor.
Lestrade made for the car muttering darkly. Sherlock would probably pay dearly for his moment of fun, but right now he couldn’t care. His mobile vibrated insistently in his pocket. Probably Greg already threatening to leave Sherlock off the next five cases if he told anyone else.
“Too bad I don’t live around here. I’d love to see how many ways I can make you beg, gorgeous.”
Sherlock shakes his head hard. He mustn’t allow himself to get carried away. John was sick and vulnerable last night. Surely, it didn’t mean anything. He just hadn’t wanted to be alone. Sherlock had taken advantage. He had been too accommodating, though no one had ever said that about him before.
The detective shakes his head and keeps walking.
Sherlock's heart beats double-time in his chest as John raises his head to gaze searchingly at Sherlock's face. John pushes his chair slightly back from the table and folds his hands in his lap. He licks his lips anxiously as his throat works convulsively over the words he doesn’t want to say.
John’s eyes flashed dangerously.
Sherlock shakes his head sadly.
He is drawn out of his self-flagellation by John’s determined voice.
“Good. You’re awake.” Sherlock’s voice was surprisingly soft.
“Who is Annabelle Georgie….whoever?”
There were five hundred and ninety-two tiles on the ceiling, or maybe it was five hundred and ninety-three. Sherlock was annoyed that he could not decide whether the cracked tile should count as one tile or two.
John is pleased, but curious. Sherlock frowns. Perhaps this was not the right thing.
“Flatterer.”
“What is the first step of the scientific method?”
"Case file from Mycroft."
He pulls up the messaging app and scrolls through his most recent messages.
By the time seven o’clock rolls around. John has changed the bedsheets, dusted the bedroom furniture, run a vacuum over the rug, and stacked the clutter into neater piles. Sherlock watched the flurry of activity from his prone position on the sofa with a sardonic smile.
John was so consumed by his own indignation that it took him several moments to realize that he’d stopped moving. Looking around, he realized he had no idea where he was. The hallway ended abruptly. The rich mahogany paneling of the walls was undisturbed by the paraphernalia that adorned the rest of the house. In this wing, there were no silver bowls, oil paintings, or other gaudy baubles to be seen. In fact, there were no windows or doors that could be discerned.
Sherlock looked stricken. The color drained from his face and he seemed to shrink into himself.
John decided to pop into Speedy’s to pick up two coffees. He knew Sherlock wouldn’t drink his, but John was sure he’d need it given the exhaustion he was already feeling.
“Undoubtedly, in one capacity or another.”
John searches for words and comes up blank.
His blood runs cold as the answer occurs to him. John rips the mobile out of his pocket and punches in Mycroft’s direct line. It only rings once before the man himself answers. That alone is unusual. Usually, one of his minions answers first to screen calls. He must have been expecting John after being notified about the mix up at the Diogenes. John doesn’t waste any time on pleasantries.
“Let’s have a proper dinner. Hmm? Take this off. It’s too warm in here for all that wool. Besides, you’ll be staying a while.” M’s lip curled in a sneer.
John wakes to the sound of incessant typing. Mary must be online ordering that kale he failed to grow. She asked him to grow some weeks ago, but despite the vegetable's hardy cold tolerance, it had proven an impossible task. The kale simply would not grow for him. Mary's taken it as a personal slight.

Mycroft nodded wearily. “He
And then he thought about Sherlock. A slow smile stole across his face and the answer floated readily to the front of his mind. He cleared his throat and answered steadily.
Sherlock scowled, knowing he was being placated, but he lay back down. John settled back in his chair and decided that he would very much like to set fire to the damn thing. The metal beneath his thighs was cold and unyielding. It felt much too clinical to belong here.
John bent forward and ran his finger along the wall searching for any signs of concealment. He found none. After covering the entire alcove twice, he was forced to give up. He rested his forehead against the nearest panel and shut his eyes.
John finally understood. “Moriarty was forced to choose the best of two bad options.”
The doctor's mouth hangs open mid-stream, but he recovers quickly and smiles warmly.
"You can't work that one out?"
He plays it off with a playful wink and smirk, which Stephen buys though John looks unconvinced. He offers each of them a wineglass then settles in his armchair. Things may be less awkward with them all comfortably seated. He’ll be more comfortable anyway. John sits in his appointed chair while Stephen takes the sofa. He sits sideways and stretches his long legs out along the seat.
Sherlock seems to search for a word. Just when John thinks he's lost the detective to his memories, Sherlock continues.
There is no bite in John’s words. He crosses the kitchen and wraps Sherlock in a tight embrace. He rests his cheek on Sherlock’s chest and breathes in the familiar, reassuring scent that is pure Sherlock.
He waited for Sherlock to nod.
“Oh, love. You know that’s not true.”
Sherlock shatters her out of her monologue.
“Why? Where is he?”
“God, this is a comfortable couch!”
Sherlock spasmed as if burned and swiveled so that his arm was out of reach. He tossed the cotton swab onto the table and quickly yanked his shirtsleeve down to cover the area. He compulsively smoothed the material and even did up the button at his wrist. To John, it seemed as if he couldn’t cover it enough. As his surprise receded, John started to notice tiny tremors rippling through Sherlock. He ached to reach out and comfort the detective, but he knew such a gesture would not be appreciated. He clasped his hands on his lap and sat up straight, at attention despite his seated position.
John, unsure of what he meant, held him tighter. This seemed to reassure the man who pulled back slightly to look at him. His Adam’s apple bobbed quickly, and he seemed to struggle over several aborted sentences before making a decision. He fixed his unsteady but serious gaze on John and spoke.
John whirled back into the sitting room, grabbed the coffee from his flatmate, and dashed off down the stairs. Sherlock blinked in surprise, and John’s laugh carried back up to him on the landing.
“I don’t have a frame of reference for this, John.” Sherlock’s voice turned plaintive and a little manic. “Please, you have to tell me what you need.”
“Hypothesis.”
John growls, a deep, possessive sound that reverberates through his chest, as he sucks a livid bruise into Sherlock's collarbone. The detective leans into it and whimpers. His body undulates toward John, searching for friction, and Sherlock can't suppress the needy sounds of desperation pouring from his mouth. John smiles and moves to slide a muscular thigh between Sherlock's legs. He thrusts firmly and Sherlock moans at the pleasure that shoots through him. He clutches John's powerful biceps and leans heavily against the sitting room wall.
“She wasn’t mad? I don’t understand. Then what happened?”
“I have personal knowledge.” Sherlock’s voice was strained, like the air struggled past his vocal chords to push the statement past his lips.
Mary’s question rushes through Sherlock’s mind alongside the bang of a gun. Mary turns on her heel and runs. Sherlock, trusting fully in John’s ability, doesn’t even move. He knows John could make a kill shot across the entire distance of the warehouse without breaking a sweat. Sherlock waits for a shot that never comes.
Lestrade closes the distance between them as he speaks until he stands right in front of the detective.
John blinks groggily and sits halfway up.
"Not yours? Sherlock! Whose piss am I holding right now?"
John looked up at him and nodded. His face remained serious, but hope was carved into the hesitant slope of his shoulders.
Fearing that the feed had frozen, John reached toward the keyboard intent on refreshing the connection. However, the sharp sound of a fractured sob stayed his hand. The echo of was loud in the nearly silent room, amplifying its effect. John waited, not quite trusting his senses. Had he really heard that or was he imagining it?
“Me,” Sherlock whispered. “I was becoming too inconvenient. He wanted me out of the way and he wanted – wanted control. The drug…it’s effects…they made me
The room buzzes with tension around the two men.
Mycroft’s lips pressed into a tight, thin line. “He jumped,” Mycroft swallowed audibly, “off of a three-story building. It was a miracle he survived at all. The rehabilitation took months, and the complications persist to this day.”
“How is Harry?” The question hung between them for a moment before John sighed. The tension unspooled as John melted into the seat. It was as if he had been carrying all that tension just waiting for Sherlock to ask.
"You followed me."
John breathes the last word like a benediction.
John swallows and nods.
The man’s voice was flat and void of warmth. Anyone but John would have missed the hairline tremor of uncertainty underlying the bravado.
John could hardly agree that the strange interaction amounted to an introduction, but he didn't care to argue with Mycroft at the moment. The man was taking an infuriatingly long time with his cuff links.
“See what?” John asked. “You?”
Sherlock speaks the words like there is a question there. John rolls his shoulders and shrugs.
“I’m not entirely sure that’s relevant.” John bristled, instinctively defensive.
One of Sherlock's hands flashes down and draws the towel away from John's golden, compact body. John shivers as the colder flat air hits a very sensitive part of his body, but smirks as he solves the problem by pressing Sherlock back into the wall and wrapping a long pale thigh around his own waist, effectively aligning their cocks.
Acknowledging and grateful for the dismissal, Greg rises and kisses Molly lightly on the cheek. With a last apologetic glance at Sherlock, he gathers his coat and heads toward Tesco.
Sherlock’s expression shuttered immediately, and fear flashed across his face. As John’s hand made contact with his chest, he flinched but did not move away. John held his hand completely still, waiting for an indication from Sherlock. The man’s chest heaved, and John could feel his heart beating just a bit too fast. He watched the delicate column of Sherlock’s throat bob as he swallowed before nodding imperceptibly.
She whips around in surprise at his proximity.
Sherlock shifted slightly, and a flicker of guilt flashed across his face. In a calmer voice, he replied, “I never said it wasn’t illegal.”
At that point, John had thrown his hands in the air and gone to pour himself another cup of tea. Apparently, this was going to be a multi-cup kind of morning. Rosie crinkled her brow and thought hard, before a smile lit her face.
Sherlock lays his hand over John's, tangling their fingers together. He gives a gentle, reassuring squeeze and leaves John to his thoughts as he stares vacantly out the window of the cab whisking them back to Baker Street once more.
"We'll stay."
"So…"
“Right,” Greg’s voice was uncertain and confused.
Sherlock shoves a large manila envelope into John’s hands. He fumbles with the string, but finally manages to unwind and open the flap. He pulls out a thick stack of paper. The top page looks like a legal contract willing the premises at 67 Lauriston Gardens to the Watson Homes Foundation. John quickly flips through the rest of the paperwork. There are concept drawings for the building and mentions of government grant money. John’s head spins. He looks to Sherlock for an explanation.
John takes a moment to revel in the sight of Sherlock undone. His cheeks are ruddy with exertion, his hair sticks up at the sides from where he has tugged at it, his chest is mottled with arousal, and his eyes are so dilated that his pupils almost eclipse everything else.
Sherlock feels tears welling in his eyes. John’s voice is full of pain and regret. Maybe watching this was a mistake. It seems intensely personal. But then, John had sent it him. His fingers slide the cubes harshly as he watches.
Sherlock ran without really seeing the road beneath his feet. He knew London better than he knew himself. He was not concerned about where he’d end up so long as John wasn’t there to see him fall apart. He raced through a narrow alleyway and came to a halt panting against a dirty brick wall. There were glass shards from discarded beer bottles and cigarette butts littering the ground. Sherlock leaned his head back against the wall, disregarding the patina of grime bathing the bricks.
“I’m all wrong!” He bellowed, ruffling his riotous hair. “I can’t undo what’s been done, and I’ll never be right. Don’t you understand? I can’t be what you need. I can’t do what you’re supposed to do when you’re, you know…” he fished for the right word, not quite finding it. “We can’t be together. I mean we can’t be
"You'll want to talk about it then," Sherlock says around a mouthful of toast. Clever John to put the plate of honeyed toast next to his mug.
He thought about the Army. He thought about the things he’d done and the faces of the people he hadn’t saved. His dreams were still often filled with rivers of blood flowing through the streets of London, chasing him until they had drowned everyone he still cared about.
John took his without a word. He held it up to admire the amber liquid inside, but the glass was shaking so hard that the scotch sloshed around, threatening to spill over the sides. He shoved the glass between his knees and wiped his sweaty palm on the thigh of his trousers. He gripped his leg hard enough to still the tremors.
John's face grows sad. He hates that he has put them in this place where Sherlock has to question John's loyalty. He tries to pull all of his sincerity to the surface, tries to make himself as transparent as possible, willing Sherlock to look and see.
“Oi, Greg! Where do you have to be so bad that you don’t want to hear the rest of it?”
expression, and Sherlock found it hopelessly endearing.
Sherlock looks up at John and fixes him with the full intensity of his magnificent mind.
John rolled his eyes indulgently and ruffled Rosie’s hair.
Sherlock’s eyes slowly unglued themselves from the ceiling to steal a glance at John. His eyes betrayed his surprise, and John noticed a deeper, more complex emotion swimming beneath the surface, but he had little time to puzzle over it.
“Connections. You would not believe the connections Jim had. Anyone who was anyone in the criminal world had thrown their lot in with him. How could I resist that much power?”
“What if I don’t know enough?”
The game was about to begin.
Mycroft, meanwhile, busied himself with disposing of his still-folded suit jacket and tie on the nearby bench and rolled his shirt sleeves so they rested just below his elbows.
Sherlock made the decision in a matter of seconds.
John’s hands clench around Sherlock’s and he works hard to ease back on the pressure.
Expecting a snarky answer and general disgruntlement, Greg is shocked when Sherlock hesitates. The detective opens his mouth to answer, and snaps it shut again. He rubs his palms soothing against his own thighs and looks at his feet.
"Take me through it?"
Sherlock freezes, locks eyes with his older brother, and turns green.
His voice is soft now, softer than John has ever heard it.
Sherlock, too busy flicking chemical compounds of his own design into the fire, hadn’t deigned to reply. John watched as the flames turned green –
“I have missed you, my pet.” He rolled his hips in one long slow motion, grinding his arse against Sherlock’s cock. The breath choked out of the detective. M sealed his lips over Sherlock’s and stole his breath for several moments until Sherlock thought he might pass out. Lights danced in his vision, and he didn’t know if it was too much arousal or not enough oxygen.
Bee giggles as Sherlock spins her around and around and around the room. She points to the kitchen when he finally stops. Sherlock enters the kitchen and stops at the sight. John is hunched over a sink full of warm bubbles, his shirt sleeves are rolled above his elbow, and his hair sticks to his forehead, damp from the humidity. Sherlock leans casually against the kitchen table and watches as John scrapes a particularly stubborn bit of egg from a Teflon pan. John scrubs and scrubs but the egg refuses to come off. Finally, John drops it back into the soapy water with a frustrated grunt, spraying himself with bubbles.
John stays close but knows better than to touch. Sherlock manages a terse nod but doesn’t stop shaking.
John slides off the sofa and walks directly to the bedroom, silently thanking Sherlock for the moment alone to get himself together. Sherlock smiles warmly at Stephen and claps him on the back as they follow.
For the next ten minutes, Sherlock shuts his eyes and enjoys the companionable quiet. At fifteen minutes, his eyes snap open. After twenty minutes, he is pacing a familiar path around his room. At thirty minutes, Sherlock cannot hold back any longer. Visions of John asleep and fully submerged flash through his mind.
“You weren’t wrong when you called it a
The words were somewhat muffled between warm, soft breaths and needy presses. Soon, Rosie started to squirm and they had broken apart, breathing heavily. Sherlock stood and John, ever practical, took command.
It wasn’t often that John contemplated his own competence, but he had to admit it felt damn good not to be paralyzed by indecision. He felt a spasm of guilt at the thrill of satisfaction that coursed through him. A wave of relief washed over him as he began to hear the distant sound of running water. His steps sped up as he followed the sound. His mind raced with possibilities. He really had no way of knowing what he would find behind that bathroom door.
Sherlock blushes and turns to leave. He stops when John’s steady fingers close around his wrist. John’s eyes are already closed, and his words sound cumbersome as he fights the drowsiness.
“I could, uh, run you a bath?”
“You could sleep in my room.”
“No. You’ve done so much already. Thank You.”
John swallows heavily. Sherlock remembers the hug they’d shared in 221B recently. He wishes he could do it again now. John looks like he needs it. Sherlock’s not quite sure why John is sending him a copy of his love confession to his dead wife, but if this is what John needs, he will sit here and receive it. Of course he will.
“What has he done now?”
Sherlock’s blood ran cold. He’d convinced himself that he’d finally forgotten that voice. Now that it came to it, he knew the truth. He hadn’t forgotten, would never forget the deceptively pleasant Irish lilt with an undercurrent of steel. He was clearly pleased to see Sherlock but also annoyed. Sherlock had oscillated, and that wasn’t part of the show. This was a command.
John found himself nodding before he realized that Sherlock could not see him. He gently brushed the curls off his forehead. Sherlock’s body went lax at his touch, and he grew more daring. He ran his fingers through those inky curls and scratched lightly at the man’s scalp. John could swear that Sherlock purred.
M slumped forward, his face nestled in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. He was breathing hard, and each exhale ratcheted up Sherlock’s own arousal. He was keening now beneath M. His whole body shook with need. Without moving his head, M whispered to him.
, John,” Sherlock snapped. “Besides, I do have better things to do than manage your social calendar.”
John’s attention has wandered around the room, but he pulls it back to the camera for this. It feels like he is looking directly into Sherlock’s eyes.
He wasn’t hiding in the shadows anymore, then. In the past, he wouldn’t have dared to pick such a public location. This was new. It indicated surety. M was sure of his place and his actions. There was a concrete purpose for this night. There was a reason Sherlock was here.
“Save it! I don’t believe anything you say! Do you know what we learned in biology today?”
“Oh, you’re protecting me now. Is that it?”
“That would be – uh, good,” he replied.
“How do you know all this?” John asked, his curiosity rising in spite of himself. He didn’t know exactly how long hypno-rophenol had been manufactured. When the press had gotten wind of what the pharma companies were cooking up, it had been national news. But every outlet had failed to state how Hypno was different from rophenol. There were no publicly available formulas or reports. It wasn’t something he was familiar with as a physician, but that didn’t mean his patients hadn’t been exposed to it without his knowledge. Was this knowledge Sherlock had picked up during his drug days?
He looked up to see a small sad smile on Sherlock’s face. The detective cleared his throat and looked down at the pills in front of him.
“I will always think of her as my daughter, John, but she may not choose to see it that way. I can’t force her. I just…I love her so much.”
Had he passed these rooms earlier? How had he not noticed the opulence around him? Surely, he would have noticed the display of weapons. The room was so massive that he was sure he’d be well within his rights to call it an armory. John was fixated on a particular musket in the collection when movement on the adjacent screen caught his eye.
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 1 - Shopping
“Of course, you’ll have me. You’ll always have me, for as long as you want.”
“Sorry,” John rasps between coughs.
“He’s not bored enough yet to stoop to building the
John turned away from the workbench, expecting the conversation to be closed.
“I’ll let you know when he finds something, Greg.” He knew this wouldn’t go very far toward reassuring the detective inspector, but it was all he could manage in the moment. John was gripping the edge of his desk so tight that his knuckles were bleached white, and his nails were leaving half-moon shaped gouges in the wooden surface.
Sherlock caught John’s eye, then hid his smirk behind his paper. Rosie was due to start Biology lessons this term, and Sherlock had done nothing to hide his pride. John, on the other hand, continues to believe that modesty is an admirable trait. Sherlock had focused very hard on the international section of the paper while John tried to explain the ridiculous notion to his daughter.
He watched as one of M’s eyebrows quirked dangerously. Sherlock placed his glass back on the table and fiddled with the base until it was back in perfect alignment. He placed his folded hands back on the table and watched M impassively.
Sherlock reached out, plucked the apple off of the coffee table, and bit into it with gusto. John chuckled as he wiped haphazardly at the juice that dripped down his chin.
The cabbie cleared his throat, and John reeled back like he’d been slapped. He fumbled for the door handle and stepped out of the cab, slamming the door behind him. It closed with a muffled finality that Sherlock felt right down to his toes. He glared at the cabbie and paid him with exact change. He took one last moment to steady himself before he followed John onto the crime scene, shoulders back, spine straight – the consulting detective once more.
John holds that beautiful, impossible future in his mind for a moment. He sees Mary smiling, kneeling, sweating in a sprawling garden under the noonday sun as two children chase dragonflies. He watches the children rush up the path as John arrives home from the clinic, swinging the side gate open. He imagines raucous family dinners and sweet, sleepy baths. He can almost feel the strength of tiny arms wrapped around his legs and smell the indescribable scent of childhood. John allows the hope and happiness to fill him.
His statement was fragile as the vapor swirling around them in the steamy room. John heard him though and was consumed by fear at his friend’s uncharacteristically emotional display. Somehow, the adrenaline pounding through his system had a calming effect, allowing him to narrow his focus to exclude everything around him that was not Sherlock. He was used to high-stress situations and excelled at projecting a calm authority.
John shudders at the memory of that grotesque grin. He can’t bring himself to make eye contact as he rubs his feet distractedly across the carpet. Sherlock can read the recognition in the resigned slump of John’s body. He knew they would have to talk about this, but he already misses the gentle intimacy of the morning. Soft sunlight illuminating John’s face as Sherlock worked beside him.
The lights in the restaurant dimmed, and a solitary spotlight shone down on the isolated table.
"That's brilliant. And insane. God, I love you, you brilliant nutter."
For once, John doesn’t have to puzzle out Sherlock’s motives. If he lived a thousand more years, he would never forget that abandoned sweets factory and the two frightened, sick, chocolate-covered children huddled in the dark. He abruptly hangs up without answering Mycroft. He steals a cab from a Westminster-type, not caring which cabinet secretary he has pissed off now. All that matters is that he gets to Addlestone.
Sherlock recoils as if slapped.
John took a chance, interrupting.
Sherlock sank to the floor and let the fear and frustration and arousal wash over him. His whole body shook with the effort of not touching himself. He clawed deep red lines into his own arms as he fought his body's impulses. Eventually, it was no use. He unzipped his trousers and palmed himself quickly. He lay on his side on the cold floor, turned his head away, and screwed his eyes shut. He'd do this as quickly as humanly possible. He felt arousal rise within him, mixing with shame. He knew he was going to come, and he hated it. He didn't want it. He didn't have a choice. In just a few minutes, his hips were grinding steadily, and, finally, he was coming in long spurts.
“Right,” John murmured. Knowing he’d been summarily dismissed, John turned and, shoving his keys into his pocket, he left the flat.
John shook with anger. It took several minutes for him to restore enough calm to unclench his fists. The first deep breath he took felt like a bucket of cold water, drenching his fury and tempering it to a low burn.
“I have found that in John. He is singular, unparalleled in all my vast experience. There is no man in all this world even close to equaling him. This is the very heart of my problem. Since it mainly concerns John, I could not ask him, which is why I am here.”
Greg’s grin is contagious and a quiet contentment fills the room for a moment before he realizes Sherlock is not going to fill the silence.
“Sherlock, you need to be in hospital! You need real doctors – experts – to run tests and determine the best course of treatment. I can’t triage you here. Not for poison. Why the hell didn’t you say something sooner. I’ll call ahead. I think Luca’s working A&E tonight. Might be able to expedite the process."
Lestrade is not convinced.
“Hard to build a sexual assault case when the drug has passed out of the victim’s system,” John agreed.
“What happened, love?”
as the edges of the lid unlatch from the plastic sides of the box. The smell of honey and eucalyptus fills the room, and Sherlock smiles as he removes two candles, an RAMC lighter, and a half-used bottle of mentholated bath salts. John used to use the salts for his leg and shoulder on bad days. Clutching the items and a clean towel, Sherlock slinks back into the bathroom in time to add the salts and turn off the tap before the tub overflows. He sets the towel on the sink, sets the candles on the edge of the tub, lights them, and flips out the light.
She spits the words at him like an accusation. Sherlock tucks the book back under his arm. He supposes he did mess up by not bringing it by promptly this morning.
“Sherlock and he were...friends?” John was not sure what point Mycroft was trying to make, but Mycroft’s eyes flashed with fury. It was only a moment, quickly hidden away behind his typical calm exterior, but John saw it.
Sherlock pulls a second folder out from underneath his chair and spreads the papers across the coffee table. John identifies them as autopsy reports and dives in. Fifteen minutes later, John’s head is swimming. This can’t mean… Sherlock doesn’t mean…
“Finish that up, would you?" John pointed at his half-eaten butty. "I’m just going to run down and check with Mrs. Hudson. She was supposed to contact the plumber about that leaky pipe in the bathroom.”
As he continued his visual survey, a further complication became readily apparent. Just below Sherlock’s navel, the bed sheets were tented quite visibly, a feature made noticeably more prominent by Sherlock’s gaunt frame. John watched the realization flicker across his friend’s face, draining what color John had managed to restore.
The ticking of the clock sets the pace for Sherlock's solemn march back and forth across the stained linoleum.
Iain waits for Stephen to nod.
“You’ve brought him an interesting puzzle. He’ll do it as quick as he can, and you know as well as I do that it will be quicker than anyone else could manage.” John watched Sherlock’s hips shift as he redistributed his weight on his stool.
M clocked Sherlock’s gaze and smirked.
"Last minute errand. Shouldn't be long."
He waves vaguely toward the kitchen.
"It's alright, my ridiculous gorgeous man. I've got you now."
Sherlock grumbles but concedes the point.
“It’s the antidote,” he said.
John watches Sherlock swan out of the room. He draws his severely confused brain back to the task at hand and wraps a dressing gown around himself before following his mad friend.
“This,” he whispered. “This is all I need.”
“How do you survive it, John?” he asked with desperation, all pretense abandoned.
“Yeah, ‘course we’re friends, Sherlock. Always have been. Now, tell me. What’s the matter?”
Feeling more himself, Sherlock heads toward the kitchen hoping to avoid a full meal but definitely angling for tea. He is not disappointed. A steaming mug sits across from John at the breakfast-laden table. Sherlock smiles his thanks and sits.
London was a perpetually unravelling mystery, especially at night. Between the shadows and the luminosity, Sherlock captured more accurate observations of the ever-changing quality of the city during the twilight hours.
“How much did you hear?”
“You weren’t with Greg.”
John can see Sherlock sliding back into a panic. He grips Sherlock's shoulders.
“Sherlock, this is…good. So, so good. Did Mycroft tell you about this? Who’s running it?”
John gladly took his hand and gingerly sat next to him.
For the first time in ages, John had felt unmoored. The flat had been dark, and his coat had been the only one hanging by the door. The resounding silence had made him anxious, and he’d decided the proffered shift would be a good distraction. A decision he was now seriously regretting.
“Not since yesterday afternoon. We went to the Symphony. Why?” He knew he wasn’t fooling anyone, but he could not make himself drop the pretense. They were worrying over nothing. Surely, they were just being overly protective, leaving no stone unturned. After all, Sherlock was a grown man. He was not obligated to check-in with them if he was on the scent of a promising lead, and he could take care of himself.
"Sorry. Groceries. For you. Mrs. Hudson's key. Sorry. I'll just…"
Coming back to the present, John shakes his head, sets the now-dry pan on the side, and drains the cold egg water from the sink. As he gathers the last of the dishes off the table, John notices the corner of a textbook sticking out from underneath a placemat. Checking the time, he realizes he is late to the surgery as it is.
Without breaking the kiss, M undid Sherlock’s left cufflink and rolled the sleeve so that it rested halfway up his bicep. His hand was like iron around Sherlock’s elbow, forcing it into his line of sight.
“Is he alive?” John’s frankness no longer surprised him. This was the heart of the matter. At this moment, there was only one thing he needed to know, and his continued existence relied on the answer to this one question.
"I know this is hard. And you feel embarrassed. I know, Sherlock, but it's just me. Just you and me. Breathing. Okay?"
Without looking back, John left the kitchen. He jogged down the stairs and stood in the entryway outside the door to 221A. He knew Mrs. Hudson had left early this morning for her sister’s, but he had hoped Sherlock would accept it as the excuse he had intended it to be.
Iain and Stephen stagger over and collapse on the bed as well. John chuckles at the memory of changing the sheets mere hours ago. So much for that. Sherlock elbows him.
John is tired and the silent rule will not keep him quiet much longer, so he pushes past the doorman and stumbles back onto the street. He knows he was rude, but he can hardly bring himself to care. He closes his eyes and takes two deep breaths. The breaths help push back the panic, so he can think. If Sherlock sent him on a wild goose chase on purpose, that means he had an ulterior motive for doing so. But what?
slither into the building this morning. The gall of him! Can you imagine? Showing up uninvited to someone's flat at half six in the morning? Anyway, I heard the unbearable
Sherlock turned away. He had to do this, but he didn’t have to watch that hope flicker and die. He was not such a masochist as all that.
Sherlock considered that for a moment.
He spoke rapidly as he straightened up, tucking his shirt into his trousers and glancing around for anything he might have set aside.
“Why was Wiggins administering it?” Sherlock interrupted. “You already know the answer to that if you think about it.” John chewed his lip to hold back the angry retort building in his mind.
"…swift action will be required. No doubt you will fill Doctor Watson in on the information he has missed during his excessive perusal of your person."
“Lestrade,” he said, clearly not having checked the caller ID.
"Yes. He is in recovery right now, but when we move him to his room, you will be allowed in to see him."
John took a deep breath and did not look away.
“Yes, my gorgeous man?”
Sherlock had not wanted to go back to the bedroom. He hadn’t explained why, but his face had been so earnest that John would deny him nothing.
Molly gets up and joins Sherlock on the sofa. She grabs Sherlock’s hands softly and smiles.
John looks at Sherlock hopefully, but the detective just seems confused.
Sherlock leans into the touch and breathes a sound that is so deep that John can only call it a purr. The detective flips a few more pages to display RAMC orders regarding supervisory capacity of the Watson Homes Foundation. John reads eagerly, hoping it will be a name he recognizes. He would love to speak to the new director. His lips move as he reads the orders, then freeze:
"…unpleasant. Apologies for my reaction. Your medication is being administered intravenously, correct?"
Sherlock waves him off with
Sherlock is still lost. Rosie, clearly not getting the reaction she was looking for, spirals totally out of control.
Rosie giggled an affirmative.
“How are you feeling?”
“My pleasure,” John breathes as he closes the last few centimeters and brings their lips together.
“Why do you say that?”
He looked down to realize that he was shredded his napkin into little pieces of paper. He dropped the confetti on the table and wiped his palms on his trousers.
John giggled and manhandled him so that he had room to climb onto the sofa and settle himself over Sherlock. John fit against him perfectly. Every dip and hollow of Sherlock’s body welcomed John.
in large bold letters. He moves to John’s side so that he can see as well.
– properly together since John moved back.
Sherlock’s breathing gets shallow and his eyes darken. John smirks at the physiological answer but waits for his man to verbalize. He runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, enjoying the low purr it elicits.
Sherlock hears the slosh of water in the tub as John gets in and the clink of a glass being set back down. John heaves a loud, contended sigh before settling into silence.
, John! How do you propose to do that? Did you want to offer your hand or your mouth?”
Sherlock stands, leaving Molly and Rosie on the sofa.
A shadow passes over Sherlock's face, and he flinches at the mention of "Serbia." John takes the opportunity to survey his friend. The longer he looks, the more concerned he becomes. Sherlock's entire body is strung tight and his muscles quiver with the effort of holding each muscle taut. He alternates between staring at Mycroft in disgust and sweeping the room, subtly checking all access points. His dressing gown is belted and wrapped securely around him, despite the t-shirt and pajama pants he is already wearing. He is even wearing a thick pair of dress socks. John has never seen the man wear socks in the flat. Not once. John tries to focus on what Mycroft is saying, but his brain is all but shouting at him to look deeper and pay attention this time for God's sake. Something is very wrong, and it just might be John's fault.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and flopped onto his back to stare at the ceiling.
John didn’t relax. While he was relieved that Sherlock had escaped that sick bastard, Mycroft hadn’t explained what that had to do with Sherlock’s recent disappearance. If Moriarty had agreed to stay out of Sherlock’s life, why was the story relevant?
“You’re so beautiful.”
Sherlock leans forward, hands braced on knees, exuding sincerity.
“I could hear you thinking all the way out in the hall. The miscalculation with the step could have resulted from a number of things, but if your leg was acting up, you would have been much slower coming up the stairs.”
“Brilliant,” John breathed. There was an unfamiliar tightness in Sherlock’s chest, and he couldn’t look away from his raggedy doctor. John’s face did something complicated and his brow wrinkled. Lestrade swore under his breath and radioed Donovan to meet him at the car. Before he could take more than three steps, John called after him.
There. Complete truth without giving too much away. Sherlock feels his muscles twitching, ready to run. He swallows the adrenaline and sips his tea, waiting for John. He is unsure how much John will probe, but he knows there will be questions. Hoping to head off the inevitable, Sherlock spits out the first thing that comes to mind.
"My time away was…"
He walks through more of the particulars, but Sherlock has heard all he needs to know. They will deal with recovery and any complications together. Together - him and John. John will be there because John is alive. He's alive. Moriarty tried to take him away. Now Moriarty is dead. Mary tried to take him away --
"What? Sherlock! You have to explain. What is going on?"
“…they stopped making that particular model in 1974. They redesigned the fuselage and added a more reliable altimeter.” John’s face was flushed with his excitement. He pushed his empty plate to the center of the table and chugged the last sip of his beer before turning his concentration to Sherlock.
John continues his exaggerated breathing. Sherlock fights to take deep breaths. After a few minutes, his chest rises more regularly and he reaches one hand out to wrap his long fingers around the delicate skin of the inside of John's wrist. It takes a moment for John to realize that Sherlock is taking his pulse. He lets his own breathing and the deep, even beat of his heart steady Sherlock.
John chuckles at the uncharacteristic obviousness of the statement. Sherlock either does not hear or chooses to ignore John's mirth. Instead, he sways back and forth on his feet and twists the belt of his dressing gown around his wrist.
was the one made of spun glass.
Sherlock lifted a finger to John’s forehead and stroked gently, trying to smooth the lines away. John shouldn’t look like that.
Greg can’t help the laugh that slips past his lips. Of course, he loves John, they’ve been
Molly takes the recently vacated chair and pours herself a cup of tea. When she has added milk and sugar to her liking, she settles back and sips, watching Sherlock over the rim of the cup. Meanwhile, Toby curls up on Sherlock’s lap and refuses to shift. So much for keeping the cat hair off his suit pants.
"I'm here, 'Lock. I'm here. You are okay. You are at Imperial College Hospital. You are not in Serbia anymore. You are safe."
“Time to get up now, Sherlock. That’s it. Easy, love. That’s it.”
He had completely forgotten that he was supposed to meet Greg for drinks tonight. He grabbed his mobile and pecked out a torturously slow message:
"How long, Sherlock? Since she shot you? Since the hospital? Since Magnussen? You
John’s lips are warm and softer than Sherlock expected. There are cracks where John chewed them – indicates anxiety. John had been thinking about this a lot, then. He’d agonized over it. Sherlock darted his tongue out to trace the grooves.
last night.”
Sherlock shakes his head no; it seems safer than speaking. Rosie narrows her eyes and breathes a single venomous word:
M clamped down on Sherlock’s earlobe to get his attention. “You wanted to touch me,” he chided, “so touch me. Wrap those long, alien fingers around my cock and let me fuck you.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. It seemed he couldn’t decide what he actually wanted to say. Several more aborted sentences followed, and he huffed in annoyance.
“I wanted to be here.”
Sherlock's reply is swift and sharp.
Sherlock shakes him awake.
John’s whole world was falling apart. He lashed out blindly, upending a silver bowl off a nearby table. There was absolutely nothing preventing Sherlock from making that promise. There was no loaded gun being held to his head, no threat of harm forcing his hand. He could choose to include John – to tell him the things he needed to know. The man simply
"So what’s the plan?"
“Do you need anything?”
John finished writing out an order for the necessary medication while answering his patient’s questions by rote. Having had the benefit of three practice runs already that morning, the conversation required very little of John’s attention. His mind wandered to his flatmate’s strange behavior.
“Not your housekeeper!”
Without another word, he turned the corner and was gone.
"I suspect the woman we know as Mary Morstan never really retired. She closed her accounts and slipped her leash, but her bolt-holes and emergency assets remain in place. Furthermore…"
I am sorry to have been away so long. This chapter was difficult to write and life is not so accommodating to my writing right now. Thank you to everyone who has waited and been really supportive. It is deeply appreciated. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
“His name is Stephen. He knows that I am blissfully happy and unavailable. He’s in London for…”
The only thing that mattered to John now was finding Sherlock and making sure that he was alright. He silently berated himself for leaving his friend in such a vulnerable state. Mycroft had made it very clear that Sherlock had been through something traumatic, though John was still not entirely sure what precisely had happened. All he knew was that he’d made the wrong decision. He’d abandoned Sherlock when he needed him most, and he was not about to fail the man again.
Mycroft frowned. “And before that?”
Sherlock’s left foot spasmed as he came back to reality. He’d spent too much time locked in his mind palace. He stretched along the length of the sofa. The popping and cracking of his joints was oddly grounding. He held his left wrist loosely in his right hand and moved it in a circular motion. When the joint was pleasantly loose, he switched to the other wrist.
Iain pants as he plunders Stephen’s mouth with his tongue. He cups Stephen’s arse cheeks in both hands and pulls the man toward him while Stephen speeds up his strokes.
“If this is our romantic night out restaurant, then I think I have some bad news for you.”
"Something is wrong."
John, treading lightly, answered truthfully. “Mycroft may have mentioned him on the way up here."
"I can see that you don’t tend it, but I can't tell why without more information. There are too many possibilities."
“I don’t know why you’re saying this,” he whispered.
me we were safe. You told me that she retired, that she was scared.
“He has been here before, John. Everything will be fine. Besides, he won’t even look at the rest of the flat once you take your clothes off.”
Sherlock barely hears it. Suddenly, he can't bear waiting any longer. He has to know.
John longed to press his lips against the delicate pale column of Sherlock’s throat, but he didn’t dare disturb the balance they seemed to have found. Sherlock was in his arms, and that was enough.
John looked at him in shock. He had thought Sherlock would pretend as if last night hadn’t happened and here he was bringing it up of his own accord. John tried to push down his excitement, hoping that Sherlock wouldn’t see his eagerness and be put off. He nodded his encouragement and sipped his tea slowly.
When they had consumed half the pasta, M paused, wiped his mouth, delicately folded his napkin onto the table, and crossed the short distance. He twirled Sherlock’s chair so that it faced away from the table and straddled his lap.
John could hear everything that Greg wasn’t saying. He was purposefully not asking if Sherlock was hunting down leads on his own, wanting to eliminate false leads before giving the information over to the Yard.
“Sherlock?”
“I’ll solve this,” Sherlock murmured, his attention already focused back on the tiny pills in front of him. “It’ll just take time.”
“Come on, John!” he exclaimed as he rushed past him on the stairs.
“Thank you."
When he got back to the flat, Sherlock was pacing around the sitting room, obviously growing impatient. John forced the coffee into his hands, and Sherlock looked at it in disgust.
Mycroft sinks down and sits cross-legged on the cold floor. He taps away at his Blackberry ordering Anthea to cancel all appointments through the following evening. Clearly, he is needed here. He keeps himself busy on his mobile while he waits.
Unable to offer decent conversation, John reached for Sherlock’s wrist to take his pulse. He seemed a little less grey, though he could barely tell in the shadowy room. John’s fingers closed around Sherlock’s wrist, his thumb pressing into the delicate underside. He could feel a strong, vibrant, if slightly erratic, pulse.
"Not retired."
John waggles his eyebrows teasingly, forcing a laugh out of Sherlock. He doesn’t bother denying it.
There were tear tracks on Sherlock’s cheeks and his complexion was a blotchy red mess, but his eyes were sharp and clear.
"Mine," John purrs as he combs through soft silver curls.
ok - read on!
"I am sorry, John."
Sherlock didn’t answer.
He wiggles his toes at Sherlock.
John blushes and noses against Sherlock’s collarbone.
“You made it yourself, you mean.” It’s not even a question. Somehow John just knew. Sherlock nodded his head. “But then why –“
"Think, John! You were cleared by the hospital to return home. You participated in no strenuous activity and were not exposed to the elements. There is no reason why your condition should have worsened. Unless someone tampered with the injections. Mary's extensive knowledge of herbs would have made it only too easy. She probably made you sick in the first place. We need to leave before she comes back. I won't be of any help if she tries to fight us. I can't even look at a n-n-needle. Please, John. Can we j-just…can we…can we…?"
He throws the word out there to catch Sherlock's attention and drag it back to the table. Sherlock seems almost reluctant to meet John's gaze.
What the hell was he doing pawing at the walls? Maybe he really was losing his mind. Lately, he was feeling as if his life was slipping away. Piece by piece he was losing the life he’d built with Sherlock. He was running out of time. Always in his mind, the clock was ticking down hours, minutes, and seconds until he was left alone in the miserable life he was destined to inhabit. After being invalided home, meeting Sherlock had been a miracle. He’d known it at the time. He hadn’t deserved to have that mad, brilliant man in his life and now the bill had come due.
There was an intimate, close feeling in the small room. John turned his head a fraction and realized that Sherlock had closed the door behind him after entering. It made him feel like they were shut away in their own private hideout. He and Sherlock, suspended in time, in a single fragile moment.
“Of course, John.”
“What happened?”
He fought to meet John’s eye, to let him know he understood. John seemed to draw strength from this reaction.
Sherlock watched, taking in every minute shift in his expression. John was sure that he had followed John’s train of thought perfectly. The moment slowed, and John felt the air around them become heavy. A bead of sweat dripped down from Sherlock’s hairline and traced the sharp line of his nose. The room faded away.
Sherlock savored the feeling of John’s strong arms surrounding him. He knew their time was limited. M was back now, and Sherlock had no leverage to keep him away. John would leave. Sherlock would not survive John leaving. Sherlock clung to one final thought as he slid into oblivion:
Greg must have sensed the reticence because he started babbling before John could say no.
John’s mouth opened to welcome him inside, and their tongues intertwined. At that moment, a shock ran along Sherlock’s spine, his skin prickled, and he felt a warmth building inside himself. He pulled John closer, but it wasn’t enough. He broke away with a whine.
work. I want to be
“The rest is a little,” he trailed off uncertainly.
They speak at the same time, and John blushes red. It is surprisingly humbling to see Sherlock so eager to help. The detective launches himself off the sofa and hovers before John with a startlingly tender expression.
Sherlock prevaricated on the doorstep wondering if he should offer to let John stay behind.
“Worst thing to happen to law enforcement in a long time. Mind-altering, fast acting, and quickly metabolized. It’s downright impossible to catch someone in the act, and the victim often can’t recognize it’s happening until the effects wear off. Can’t imagine what the drug companies were going for when they Frankenstein-ed this nightmare.”
“No,” John confirmed. “I don’t understand, Sherlock.”
“School is supposed to teach you what you don’t know. It would be a bloody waste otherwise.”
“Stuff it! That was like ten years ago, and it’s not like I’ve been back since.”
“I chose you, marked you, and You. Are. Mine.” With violent force, M brought Sherlock’s lips to his own. Their teeth clacked against one another, and Sherlock felt the skin on his lip split. Warm, wet blood mingled with M’s tongue in his mouth. He was embarrassingly hard in his trousers, and he couldn’t stop his own needy whines.
“No, you weren’t.”
Sherlock refused to meet John’s eye. His gaze remained stubbornly fixed on the ceiling.
He pressed a hand to his abdomen and took several deep breaths. The feeling of his hand rising and falling with the motion was calming.
“Some things can’t be unseen, John.” His Adam’s apple bobbed in his throat. “No matter how you might want to forget them.”
Greg draws himself to his full height and steps directly into Sherlock's path.
Sherlock grabs John's neck and pulls him down into a hard, deep kiss.
"After Magnussen. After she…shot you, I was so angry, Sherlock. I wanted nothing to do with her. I couldn’t even look at her face and our house was covered in wedding photos. When you almost died.
He could do this, would do this, for John. He would do what needed to be done. He would have plenty of time to hate himself later. He could already feel the thick slow molasses-like pull of self-loathing slipping in around the edges of his mind.
“I want that too,” Sherlock replied.
“You don’t have to drink it, you berk.” John snapped. “Just hold it a minute, okay?”
“Addlestone. What is he doing, John?”
“Last night,” he began, ignoring the quaver in his own voice. “I was a coward.”
Same address?
John strokes Sherlock several times before wrapping his tongue around the head of Sherlock's cock. His tongue bursts with the sharp tang of salt and John moans. He bloody loves this. He laps at the slit and slides his fist slowly, setting a torturous pace. After several moments of savoring, John rises up on his knees, tilts his head back, and takes Sherlock completely into his throat. He sucks hard, holding Sherlock's thrusting hips at bay. The broken moaning and desperate scraping of Sherlock's errant fingers along his scalp send pulses of pleasure shooting straight to John's cock. With his free hand, John pumps himself in time to Sherlock's thrusts.
“Sherlock? Have we been here before?”
John sucked in a quick breath at the thought. “But I thought you said that Moriarty agreed to leave him be. I thought you said he was safe!”
“You haven’t told me a single thing! I don’t have any idea – Mycroft wait!"
The answer was abrupt and harsh. Sherlock jerked out of John’s embrace and withdrew from all physical contact. A mix of embarrassment and heated anger was forcing a red blush up his neck. He paced wildly in front of John who was still slumped on the ground in astonishment.
The short sturdy body of a sour Scotsman lounges in the doorway. Sherlock begins fucking John again, long smooth strokes that have him begging.
Bill Wiggins was depositing a needle in the sharps container he had evidently brought with him. John knew for a fact they didn’t have one in the flat. It had been the source of one of their biggest arguments. Sherlock had wanted one around due to the unpredictable nature of his experiments. John had outright forbidden it due to Sherlock’s history of drug abuse. He didn’t really know all the details, but he knew enough to know that Sherlock did not need that kind of temptation in the flat.
I want it to be a foregone conclusion that where one of us goes, the other will follow. I want all of my days, all of my plans, the entirety of my future to be entwined with yours.”
He took the next two left turns, walked down a flight of stairs, and found himself at a crossroads. Four different passageways branched off of the vestibule in which he stood. John looked back and forth between the options, but he had no inkling of familiarity with any of them. There was no light or sound to guide him, and his impatience to get to Sherlock was driving his decisions. He had abandoned all reason the moment Sherlock’s legs had given out beneath him.
He was still embarrassingly hard. He tried to ignore it but stumbled as he stood. His foot connected with a small brown parcel, and he only managed not to fall over by grabbing the back of the chair. The package was tied with frayed black string and a small printed card was pinned to it.
would keep his distance, and Sherlock would not interfere with his business. He practically ran the bloody empire, you’d think he’d get bored of chasing Sherlock across London.
“NO!” Sherlock’s voice was loud in the small kitchen. He stood and stalked toward John, eyes narrowed. “I will not be going to hospital. You don’t even know what I’m dealing with. They won’t know either! It’s none of your business anyway. I’m managing it perfectly fine without you.”
"Go and get dressed."
"I don't think I had anything more than coffee at home until Mary got on this new health kick three weeks ago. She insisted on making us these smoothies for breakfast. Tasted like regurgitated grass. I mean, who wants to drink something
“I’m going to know more than everyone because Papa already taught me.”
“You think Moriarty is behind this?”
“Yeah. Sure. Bedroom sounds great. After you, John.”
John choked. “Don’t let him catch you saying that,” he said seriously. “He’ll take twice as long just because he can.”
“You’re not sick, though.” John meant it as a statement of fact, but his voice tilted up at the end making it more of an entreaty.
"Sherlock."
Sherlock was stretched across the entire length of the sofa. His toes tucked away underneath John’s Union Jack pillow because Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to grab the throw off the back of the sofa. His index finger rubbed hypnotically against his lower lip as his eyes scanned back and forth through the air. John could always tell when Sherlock was merely sorting information. When the detective went deep in his mind to wrestle with particularly challenging problems, he went still. That had been hard for John to get used to at first. Sherlock - still as death - looking as though he’d just stopped. It still creeped John out sometimes, but at least he knew to expect it now. The sofa groaned as Sherlock fidgeted, trying to get comfortable. He hadn’t gone deep enough to close his eyes or change his respiration, so he was probably not planning on plumbing the inky depths of his mind palace tonight.
“I wasn’t lying, love. I did have drinks with a friend.”
Suddenly, Sherlock’s left arm was on fire. A tingle of sensation shot along his nerves, and he couldn’t suppress the moan of pain that escaped him. He didn’t realize that John had gripped his arm until the hand was snatched back. Sherlock shook his head and concentrated hard. He had to know what John was saying.
“You better hurry up and get in here, MacKelpie, or you’ll miss all the fun."
in secret if it’s not illegal!” John was yelling. He knew he was yelling now, but he couldn’t help it. Sherlock was sitting there in front of him, justifying his behavior.
The silence expands and fills the room with a foreboding stillness that neither man is anxious to break. Sherlock's fingers twitch at his sides as Mrs. Hudson's clock chimes the hour. John's shoulders slump in defeat. He gestures toward the sofa. Sherlock never really got around to replacing John's chair.
“You’re happy, then?”
The detective smiles, leads John up the front stairs, and draws a small key from his coat pocket. John watches in astonishment as the door swings open. Sherlock, noticing John’s reaction, huffs in frustration.
True, he’d forgotten that the algae were cultivating in the crisper but that was no reason to throw it out. Mrs. Hudson had not agreed. Still, he’d only been slightly annoyed. It was hard to be truly angry at Mrs. Hudson. How can you be angry at someone who makes you tea every morning and keeps you stocked in ginger biscuits?
If Sherlock’s eyes were a little wet, John was kind enough not to mention it.
[VOICEMAIL]
Playing along, Sherlock replied. “I was telling the truth, John. I had a lead on lunch.”
Sherlock shuffles the contents of the file and rereads the autopsies. He memorized them hours ago, but it is something convenient to do. Despite the loss sweeping over John, it is his own heartbreak that makes it impossible to look directly at the man across from him.
Several hours later, John gently nudged him awake. He’d lost all feeling in his legs and a large wet spot had formed from the humidity of the man’s breathing. If that had been his only discomfort, John would have let him sleep. But Sherlock’s head was pressed against John’s uncomfortably full bladder, and the matter had become rather urgent. Besides, Sherlock could with a little food as well.
John could hear a loud ticking as time passed. He saw the vulnerability in the soft slope of Sherlock’s shoulders and the cold truth in the tremble of his lip. Though he knew what Sherlock was trying to tell him, John’s brain rejected it.
Sherlock stops talking abruptly at the incredulous-cum-disappointed look on John's face.
“Good, John. Physical symptoms also include extended periods of arousal and persistent erections. Emotional symptoms are harder to define. Mood swings - definitely. Frustration, longing, desperation, disgust - all expected phases. But this time, there is something different. Something I haven’t ever had before.”
“No. Everything’s fine. I mean John and Rosie are fine. Good. They’re good. Really good, yeah. It’s just…”
“Then it’s a good thing I can travel through time and space. You wouldn’t want to miss out on the magic. I’ll make you fucking fly with my Cloak of Levitation.”
, his brain helpfully supplied. John was lighting the fire.
“I didn’t quite get that far. Rosie was hysterical. She—”
“I assure you I would not ask unless it were imperative, John. I cannot explain properly unless I know what you have been told.”
Minutes passed, or at least that was what it felt like for Sherlock. Suddenly, John was knelt at his side. When had he moved closer? His hands were out, palms facing Sherlock. He felt like his head was full of cotton-wool and there was a high-pitched ringing in his ears. John’s mouth was making shapes again. John’s eyes were wide, and his brow crinkled in hard lines when Sherlock didn’t respond.
He lets his head hang off the bed to suck Stephen upside-down into his mouth. Sweat drips off Sherlock’s brow and runs rivulets down John’s chest. The detective is mesmerized by the sight.
His arms wrapped around his ribs and he seemed to be holding himself silent through sheer force of will. Sherlock rocked precariously back on his heels, wobbled for a moment, and fell hard on his tailbone.
“I’ll take that as a yes?”
"It’s Wiggins'. Test it. It'll light up like a Christmas tree. I promise."
A hint of strong espresso wafts off of his soft brown button-up. Sherlock’s eyes shoot open.
“This is about Mary, then.”
Mrs. Hudson's heels clack up the stairs.
Sherlock nods, focusing solely on evening out his breathing, and after several long minutes, succeeds. His glistening eyes fix on John, who feels their pain throb deep in his own stomach. Bracing himself, John nods in what he hopes is a reassuring manner and waits for Sherlock to speak.
“I find nothing but delight in John’s singularity, however, I have found that being in a relationship with him makes me ordinary. Makes me want to be, at least.”
“I think about what I want,” he started. “Then, I think about what you need. When the two are different things, I choose you.”
John smiled softly, knowing now what Sherlock needed and no longer afraid to say the words out loud.
A wailing child attached to a pale, thin freckled man joins them an hour in.
John can feel the thread of the conversation slipping quickly away.
That single word says more than John has managed with five times that many sentences. Hope, anxiety, fear, and love, they’re all there in that one word. They’re in the gentle tremor that runs through John’s hand as he clasps Sherlock’s cheek so, so carefully. They’re in the tear that leaks from Sherlock’s eye. They’re in the tender press of lips meeting
I decided to make this all one inter-connected story. This might be a little ambitious...we will see. Let me know what you think in the comments. Thanks for reading!
Before John could so much as reach for the door handle, the large wooden panel swung aside to reveal a matronly woman with grey hair and hard eyes. She stood aside to let the men enter, then briskly shut the door behind them. Turning to thank the unnamed woman, John realized she had already excused herself and disappeared.
What if he missed something important? What if he knew something they missed?
John’s face crumpled at the implied rejection. Sherlock, dismayed, hurried to reassure him. “I’m not saying that I won’t explain, just give me a minute to figure out…”
