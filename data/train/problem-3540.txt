Dean gives him a tight smile. “Call it a second chance.” He looks up at the sloping roof. “For both of us.”
, bitch!”
Dean paces the length of the kitchen and back as Sam leans back on the stool and watches him. His eyebrows rise higher with every circuit Dean makes, but Dean can’t make himself stand still. If he stands still, he’s going to have to look at him. Why was this so much easier when he was practicing it in the shower? To make matters worse, Miracle keeps trotting behind him, nails scraping an uneven rhythm on the floor.
“Okay,” Dean grumbles. He presses his palms to the counter, a compromise that keeps him facing the pantry shelf rather than Sam. One of the pots sways on its hook as Dean leans his weight heavily onto his arms. He takes another breath. “When the Empty took Cas… look, I didn’t tell you everything that happened.”
Dean feels that old, knee-jerk tightness under his skin, the kind that makes him straighten out of his lean and square his shoulders. It’s an ugly feeling that digs in hard, one that would’ve launched him into some manly-man joke or some kind of “whoa, there, sister” backpedaling not that long ago. He breathes through it until it eases instead, and mumbles, “I don’t bat my eyelashes.”
They look at each other for a moment in the low, humming light from overhead. Laughter leaks out between them, gentle and easy.
Laughter bubbles across the tables, and then more cheering as Dean lifts the glass of champagne that Sam hands him. He downs it one swallow to more cheers and abandons the glass on the bar.
“It’s falling apart,” he says flatly the second time Dean asks. “My back went out ten years back, and they moved the highway, so business dried up. No one wanted it. Don’t know why the hell you want it, but I ain’t askin’ questions.”
Dean furrows his brow. “It’s been five minutes. You already—”
“All right, enough of that, who wants burgers?”
“I’m sorry if I put you on the spot yesterday,” Benny says, glancing at Dean between the bars of the railing. He’s crouched on the porch while Dean stands on the ground on the other side, both of them painting a darker stain into the wood. “Didn’t mean to.”
Dean tucks his chin, leaving his head where it is as he looks across the table. He gives the dog one last pat and then rolls his bottle between his hands. “We just got the world back, and you’re already trying to get rid of me?”
“So you think you’re just going to watch me do all the work, is that it?” Dean says.
Dean’s too tired to start anything, that damn sweater notwithstanding, but Cass seems content enough to be pushed back into the pillows and kissed for a while, once he’s lost his slacks. He takes it slow, teasing Cas’s lips, exploring his mouth, a soothing heat that doesn’t so much build as simmer. Cas slides a hand over his back and slots his knee under Dean’s. He opens his lips against Dean’s to steal a breath, and Dean smiles and catches them again.
Sam just raises his eyebrows at him. Dean slumps back into the counter, dropping his head between his shoulders.
“Jesus Christ.” Dean crushes his face into his palms, turning to taking a few steps toward the fridge. “This is a nightmare.”
“What are we cooking?” Dean says, leaning his elbows on the table where Charlie’s sweeping.
“Étouffée, brother. These ladies never had a real étouffée done right,” Benny says.
“I’m sorry, it’s just… Dean, I’ve known forever.”
He twists a little to look over his shoulder. Cas tilts his head, a gesture so old and familiar that it knocks something loose in Dean’s chest, easing that tight feeling caught under his ribs. The smile he gets back is what’s new.
“Cas, I… fuck. Of course I love you. I’ve loved you longer than I know what to do with.”
“I don’t know what I’m doing, either,” Cas says quietly. He comes to a stop right in front of Dean. “But if we figured out how to kill God, I have faith we can figure out how to do this.”
“Are you?” Dean arches an eyebrow at him.
It doesn’t look anything like his dream when it’s finished. But he thinks he likes it better.
It was Cas. All of it— the shaky hands at his chest and the brush of teeth on his bottom lip, breath heavy and uncertain, movements stiff and awkward.
I need you to save him.”
Sam stared back, gaze heavy where he lingered on the exhaustion blooming beneath Dean’s eyes in dark purple streaks. There was a tremor buzzing in his hand. His eyes wavered in their struggle to focus.
Sam sighed in the kitchen doorway, arms stretched wide as he said, “Brush it off.”
Dean hummed behind a sip of black coffee. “You’re a liar is what you are.”
“Oh hell— okay. Bad idea,” Dean said, an embarrassed laugh bubbling out of him. He knew what this meant. “Uh, alright. I’m gonna take the reins on this one, buddy, but you make sure and watch me.”
“That’s… not possible.”
Sam smiled, dimples and all, boots scuffing against the ground. He leaned forward, hands in his pockets, and his hair spilled over past his ears. In the sunlight, Dean could see the grey starting to creep it’s way towards his hairline, and it made something silly and warm dance its way through his chest.
He looked like he wanted to say something. Dean thought he could see Cas working through his own head, trying to come up with the right words, but he eventually left the silence as it was and stepped out of Dean’s way to carry on down the hall, footsteps lingering awkwardly.
Retirement. Right. It’s been a couple weeks since… you know, everything. God is dead to them and Jack’s making the most of his promotion and for the first time in too many years of Dean’s life, they’re not staring down the barrel of another apocalypse. He’s sitting at the table where they’ve planned the deaths of gods and angels, sharing a beer with his brother, nowhere to be. It feels… weird. It’s making him itch.
Dean had been surprised how quickly Benny agreed to come work in the bar. But then again, he’d been in that hole-in-the-wall diner when the whole Martin thing had gone down, and he’d seemed to take to it. They’d offered him a room in the bunker, too, but he hadn’t stayed longer than a few days before he found some little hovel of his own. “After how long I spent in Purgatory? A man needs his space to breathe, you know? Not that I don’t appreciate it, now.”
And isn’t that perfect?
something be in the way. One apocalypse after another, one excuse after another, and I don’t — I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. This part of myself — it’s never been easy for me to look at. It’s still not.”
A few whoops interrupt him. Dean smiles, and glances back at the kitchen in time to see Benny lean out the door, half an apron tied around his waist.
“Then why are you acting like it is? What did Cas do?”
“Dean,” Cas croaks. “I—”
“To whom it may concern, this is a message for Dean,” she says, leaning too close to the screen. She pulls it even closer, so Dean can see is one eye and half of her nose. “Dean Winchester
Dean’s got another chance. He’s going to take it.
Dean tips his head back. “God, you’re such a dick. Yes, okay? The hell you think we’re having this awful conversation for? We talked, we’re good, we’re… you know. A thing. Together. Whatever.”
To Dean’s left, Sam starts knocking a fork against his glass. The din settles, heads turning toward him. Jesse and the hunter he was shooting pool with lean their sticks against the table and lean themselves on its edge. Over the creaky country tune that keeps piping from the jukebox, Sam says, “Hey everyone. We know you’re hungry for the burgers Dean and Benny have cooking—”
“Yeah, bet you don’t even have to. He can feel a disturbance in the profound bond, or whatever,” Charlie says.
Cas presses his lips together. Yeah, maybe that’s not that funny either. His hand tightens around Dean’s wrist.
Dean spreads his arms. “I cordially invite you to lay one on me.”
“I’m not trying to—”
“Yeah?” Dean leans a little closer. “You mean it?”
“I’ll show you what you can do with your skillset,” Dean mutters. He realizes a moment too late how it sounds, and reminds himself a moment too late after that that it doesn’t matter. That it’s... it’s fine. It’s fine now, to... you know. It’s
“How did you even contact—never mind, I don’t want to know.” Dean sets the envelope down. “Did you seriously pull the world savior card with people and demand money? For me?”
“Dean, I—” Cas seems to hesitate. At least Dean isn’t the only one struggling for words, here. “I shouldn’t have done it like that. At the time, I thought — it seemed like the only way to — to stop Billie, to give you a chance. Had I any other choice, I wouldn’t have burdened you like that.”
“He could hear you, you know,” Cas says. “If you prayed to him.”
Dean swallows and clenches his fists in tighter, like he’s going to have to knock his own teeth in to get the words out. God, Cas deserves better. But fuck it. “I’ve had so many chances and I’ve wasted every single one of them. And I… I don’t want to know if this is the last one I’m going to get.”
“I know. I didn’t even have time to get pissed at him because he — he cashed it in. To save me from Billie.” Dean drops his head and stares at his faint, twisted reflection in the chrome of the counter.
,” Dean cuts in, “is this... what you want? Going from ‘angel of the Lord’ to bartender is kind of a... you know. Massive downgrade?”
“I don’t know, Sam.” Dean glances over the blinking consoles lining the corner, and the map spread under his feet. His eyes wander to the bookshelves up the stairs, and then snag on Cas where he’s still standing by the table, turned enough now to have his hands curled around an empty chair. He turns his head, and looks up. Dean looks away on instinct, back down to the bottle now resting on his thigh. Dammit. He promised himself he'd do better than that. He takes a breath, and lifts his head again. Cas is waiting for him. His mouth quirks up a little. Half a smile tugs at Dean’s lips in answer.
Every direction felt like the wrong one. Say this or that and Cas would be ripped from him again. He wouldn’t trust Dean, and he wouldn’t love Dean, and it was only a matter of time before everything fell apart anyway because it was
what place he loved the most, he just didn’t know how to explain that it wasn’t even a place at all.
“Oh.”
Once again, I just want to reassure that Dean’s alcoholism and bad coping mechanisms in general will be something he overcomes in this story. Healing takes care and time, especially for someone like Dean.
“I’ve always thought I had the ability to feel the way human’s felt, but now I realize that was far from the truth. Everything is so much more. Brighter, grander, but… it’s sadder too, overwhelming in a way I hadn’t been able to understand before. Even the good it’s—” His eyes lingered on Dean for a beat too long, wavering as he glanced away. “It’s all so much to handle.”
Jack fell to his knees beside Cas, hands flocking to his face, and Dean fought through an aching chest to ask, “Can you fix him?”
in my pocket—”
“I’ll watch him,” Eileen said, and Dean felt the soothing hand at his elbow before he even saw her appear beside him. Dean turned to her with wide eyes, fear creeping in fast.
She signed, and her smile only grew as she watched Dean slowly piece together her hand gestures. He wasn’t even close to catching up to Sam, but Dean was learning well enough, now able to pick up key phrases and basic lettering fast compared to just a few months ago.
“Okay,” Dean said. “Fuck, okay— let’s go.”
” She said, and Dean blew out a breath. “
“No, man, we’re not,” Dean barely felt the smile his lips curled into as he helped Castiel to his feet, hands locking together, shoulders bumping. “Now, I know what you’re thinking.
The tears had made it to Dean’s voice by then, coating his throat like wet tar, “Why?”
Eileen held on to this for a long moment, staring at Dean in the dark, rolling the words between her fingers. She looked certain and doubtful all in the same breath, expression changing after every tick of a second.
Dean slapped the steering wheel happily. “Okay!”
“I’m not leaving you,” Is what inevitably came out, the only truth he’d ever known, the only good thing Dean had ever been taught, because without that there was nothing.
“Dean.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Eileen asked, bending down to the ground. She smoothed a hand over Dean’s knee for comfort, but it felt like coddling more than anything, and he squirmed away with embarrassment hot in his face.
“Have a nice day!” Castiel said quickly, snatching the receipt one second and shoving Dean through the sliding front doors the next. He sighed once they were outside, throwing Dean a look. “You don’t think that was a little uncalled for?”
Dean squeezed right back, smiling a little as he said, “Too bad. You gotta get this done.”
The sudden rattle of Sam’s phone over the table was enough to make Dean raise his head. They both looked over as the phone continued to ring, the flash of Eileen’s name making Dean pull away just as Sam leaned forward.
All the nervous shuffling had stopped, along with the stifling pauses in their speech that used to make Cas curl up and skitter out of the room without a word, too overwhelmed by a past version of himself that he couldn’t fill. Now, on a good day, Cas was brushing by Dean in the hallway and
Dean grinned, shy and appeasing. “Yes, ma’am.”
“Dude,” Sam interrupted, throwing his hands out to steady the bar. “Would you please try and shut off the whole protective thing for five minutes? You’re gonna hurt yourself.”
looked at Dean— he might as well have been saying
He returned the wallet back to his pocket and stared at the top of Castiel’s head, suddenly missing the way Cas used to look at him non stop, always so heavy and adoring. Dean could hardly believe there used to be a time where he couldn’t stand it.
but, when you were an angel—”
Sam sighed, face twisting up awkwardly as he scratched at his jaw. He marked his page and closed the lore book he was currently nose deep in, something about angel omens and sigils it looked like, but even when squinting Dean couldn’t be sure.
He did, he knew it. And this time running from it wasn’t something he considered. It wasn’t even an option.
“His grace is more damaged than I thought,” Jack breathed, looking ready to collapse with grief.
The sudden space between them felt insurmountable, Dean practically hanging off the bed in his need to keep a distance now. It was different with Cas being awake. Too real, too capable of leading somewhere Dean wasn’t sure he could take. He curled a fist into the bedding, searching for his side of the blanket back. He already felt colder without Cas, and the desire to have him back was a physical pain that only worsened when Cas turned over to face him fully.
“It’s my job to worry about you, man,” Dean shrugged humorlessly, pulling a face. “It’s kinda my thing. Seriously, ask anyone.”
Again.
Patience was quiet for a moment. Not once did her eyes leave Jack.
Dean pulsed with sympathy, a breath spilling out of him. He hadn’t had to do that in years; Dean had stopped brushing Cas away ages ago, deciding the surge of contentment in his heart at a simple brush of hands was worth the burn at the back of his neck, the instant harrowing panic.
“It’s almost noon actually,” Sam said, glancing at his watch. “So, just in time.”
Cas sighed over the phone, deep and dramatic enough to make Dean pull a face. “
With those words, everything changed. The aching guilt in Castiel’s face morphed as if slapped away, making room for a wave of senseless anger that seemed to erupt from nowhere.
Sam almost never did.
and it hurt so fucking badly, everything ached and pulsed and throbbed and sobbed— but it didn’t matter.
And there was just enough tenderness in his voice for Dean to think, not for the first time, that he couldn’t do this. He couldn’t take being this close to Cas when he knew how things were going to end. But there’s always been a fight in Dean, justified or not, and the only thing Dean wanted more than to give up, was to give in.
Ask him everything he’s dreaded asking since Cas had shown up at that hospital.
Sam shuffled through the bathroom door, a pile of clean clothes in hand, and a few seconds later the sound of water spraying against chalky tile echoed through the wall. Eileen walked quietly through the room, careful of her footsteps, and Dean drifted where he laid, his eyelids numbed and smoke tinted.
Dean didn’t have a chance to respond before Sam was ripping it straight from him, sending a spout of beer dripping off the curve of his chin.
“Is it your shoulders?” He asked.
Dean looked down just in time to block the majority of Miracle’s eager flailing, but it wasn't enough to stop his blundering paws from dragging prints all down the front of Dean’s jeans. Dean couldn’t even pretend to be put off by it; he squatted down until his knees creaked in protest and grabbed Miracle with both hands, his tail nothing but a senseless blur of movement that had Dean smiling despite the weight in his chest.
“Oh believe me it does. Keeps me up at night,” Dean replied, grinning when he noticed Castiel caught onto his sarcasm; his expression flickered with annoyance.
“Advances?” Dean repeated incredulously, his heart all but ripping through his chest. He waited for Cas to take his words back, claim he’d misspoken, but nothing came of it. He laughed nervously, frantic, “damn, you’re really not kiddin’ huh?”
Even Castiel seemed shocked at himself, but he quickly replaced it with a smile. One the size of the fucking moon that made his eyes wrinkle and his gums show, shoulders shaking with delight. Dean stared at him for what felt like a lifetime, rattled and thrown into the abyss, sinking into nothingness— feeling
Dean didn’t pay Sam any mind as he rounded the kitchen island. He could feel the disappointment already gathering in his brother’s face, his eyes worried-soft and flickering every which way, but Dean’s head was just fuzzy enough for him not to care all that much when he felt his skin begin to itch from the scrutiny. His ears burned and his stomach sank, but there was a swirling warmth flooding in from the back of his ribs— and that’s all Dean needed to feel blissfully numb.
Dean woke slowly, forced to crawl through a layer of ache and warmth before finally finding the strength to pry his eyes open.
other car.
It still beat restlessly for something so far out of reach.
Cas didn’t wake up.
It was sometime between late night and early morning the next time Dean prayed to Jack.
Alright, wow yeah- this chapter was a big one! A lot of changes happened, good and bad, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments! Not only was Cas's situation finally explained a little, and Dean came to terms with some heavy shit, but Dean and Eileen worked through things, which is something I'd been wanting to address for so long.
He inhaled shakily. “Cut the self-pity crap, Sam. Get pissed! This is Cas we’re talking about, we’re— we’re not just gonna leave him there to rot.”
Room 29 was at the far East side of the hospital down a hallway that smelt like burnt plastic and cleaning supplies.
“Dean,” Cas said after a stalled moment of nothing, Dean breathing shallowly on the other end. “I’ll be okay. I promise.”
Dean didn’t say anything. But just the mention of Jack had him spiraling through enough emotions to make him drop the conversation altogether, back straightening.
“Deaf,” Cas said curiously, simply making an observation.
” She explained gently, words soft, and that was the worst part about all of it, really. Just the presence of this side of her made Sam want to collapse onto the thread-bare carpet. “
He figured it was too late at night to try and call Cas.
It was only early afternoon and yet Dean got out of the Impala to find the air much crisper than it had been that morning, the chill of it making his neck prick up.
“Uncalled for my ass,” Dean huffed, circling his way around the car. “That guy was giving you the fucking stink eye, and for what? Because you're hurt? If he wasn’t some kid I would’ve clocked him in the fucking—”
“So… thanks. Thank you. All of you. And, uh… you better keep coming back and making me some money.”
“What you really need,” Eileen says, cutting into Dean’s thoughts as she leans on leg down off the counter, and then the other, “is shepherd’s pie.”
“Guess it is,” Dean says, lifting his brush again.
“I think I’d be more useful in a supervisory capacity,” Cas says. Dean looks over at him. Cas raises his chin, looking down his nose, until his lips start to twitch. Dean drops his head and laughs, and Cas smiles.
“Hello, Dean,” he says, deep and quiet.
The tables are packed for this grand opening. The booths along the wall are full. Dean knows most of the faces in the house, or he’s heard the names of the curious hunters that turned up to fill in the blanks. Donna tips forward over the high top off to the left and laughs, cradling a pint as she leans into Jody and watches Alex gesticulate. He hears one of Garth’s twins squeal from a booth in the corner. Claire and Kaia keep elbowing each other out of the way as they argue over the jukebox in another corner. Cesar shouts something over the din that has Jesse leaning through the open french doors of the side room where they’d set up the pool table piece by piece. Charlie and Eileen are sitting to one end of the bar chatting. And even Rowena’s here, perched on one of the barstools like she’s holding court, a martini held aloft like a scepter. She catches Dean’s eye and winks.
Cas draws in a sharp, shaky breath. He takes a step closer.
Cas steps back to let Dean through, but he catches Dean’s wrist before he can clear the threshold. He turns, blocking Dean a little from view, and whispers, “Dean, are you—”
Jody’s voice cuts in again. “Claire, come on—”
Sam just smiles at him. “Let’s just say you got a lot of grateful friends out there that are just really happy the world didn’t end. And uh, you know. An anonymous, downstairs benefactor that’s really happy you ‘fixed it.’ She said you’d know what that meant.”
Dean lays there a moment. He listens to the bunker humming around them. Footsteps shuffle somewhere down the hall, and he hears the low hum of someone’s voice, too distant to pick out the words. A door shuts around the corner. And under Dean’s cheek, Cas breathes, slow and even. Dean finds himself thinking again of the roadside where Jack brought the world back to life, how much he’d missed these thousand little whispers of other people.
“Yeah, Dean.” Sam sits back as he says it, beer bottle landing over the Atlantic Ocean on the table. “I figured—I mean, when we were in your head—”
Sam holds his hands up. “I’m just saying. You said it was the dream.”
“Not talking about this!” Dean says, drawing a look from Benny that gets Eileen looking at him too. He ignores them and marches over to the half-empty pack of water bottles sprawling open on the corner of the counter.
He launches into a list of ingredients that makes Eileen’s eyes light up, and Dean catches Charlie’s eye and grins. She carries her dustpan over to a big black garbage bag slumped next to another table and dumps it. Then she leans the broom against a chair, shoving away a piece of hair that falls out of her long braid and into her eyes. She wipes her hands on the frayed edge of her oversized t-shirt. It reads, “Women want me, fish fear me,” and Dean had laughed for a solid minute when she’d walked into the kitchen with it that morning.
“I don’t know how long it took me. Three hours? Four?” His throat is so tight he has to force the words out one by one. “I couldn’t do it. For the longest time, I couldn’t do it. Because the thought—” His eyes start to sting. He shuts them. “The thought of walking out of here and leaving you behind for good kept me on my knees.”
As good as any times can be in Purgatory. Nights are long and dark and desperate, and Dean had stumbled on Benny with blood on his face and under his nails, numb with unanswered prayer. Benny had been warm, and he hadn’t been gentle, and Dean liked the bite of his kisses and the hard grip of his fingers. It could’ve been something good, maybe. In another life. In another place. He isn’t going to pretend they didn’t crash together once or twice on this side, too, when Dean needed something to crash into. But he’s right. Dean put a lot of things on offer, but his heart wasn’t one of them. And like every other lover in Dean’s life, Benny deserved better.
“Oh come on, it’s a compliment!”
Dean finishes nailing the replacement post into place and straightens, dragging the back of his hand through the sweat on his forehead. “Spoken like a man trying to weasel out of pulling his own weight. You do remember—”
Dean’s been calling it a second chance. But it’s more like the fourth, fifth, fourteenth, seventy-second. Who’s counting? What matters is, there was still one more. Jack got them one more. And Dean’s never gonna be able to repay the kid for that. Except by taking it.
Cas’s breath hitches behind him. He knows the look Cas wears now without looking. He’s seen it so many times. The sadness that rounds his eyes, the pain tight at the corners of his mouth. Dean squeezes his eyes shut tighter and pictures it, the last time he saw that look, with Cas standing between Dean and the sigil barely holding the door shut.
Cas pretended to consider the offer for a moment longer, and his expression still held a mask of stubbornness when he reached forward and took the pills into his palm, shaking them around.
and if there was ever a time that Dean recognized what it looked like to have the ball on his side of the court, this was it.
Small fucking victories.
Dean pulled out into the sunlight and quickly turned left instead of right, ignoring the tightness in his chest.
The angel blinked at him, blue eyes wide and blank in that stupidly oblivious way of his that made Dean irritated faster than anything else. It was like pulling teeth trying to get Castiel to understand human etiquette, common sense- even now, years after the Apocalypse. But that look on Cas’s face, that mixture of confusion and twinkling innocence often thrown in with a soft head tilt always made Dean a little helpless too.
His cheeks darkened.
” Castiel asked, still managing to sound bitter.
A match was tossed into the mix, a roar of fire that made them both startle back, and the two of them watched as the spell flickered and sparked before dying out in a flare of purple and red.
“Alright, so,” Dean took a seat across from Sam, tapping his knuckles on the hardwood table. “What’s the word?”
with Cas, exist in his realm, orbit his planet, because who knew how much longer he’d have this. Who knew if this would be the last time.
It was hard to imagine that years ago, when Dean had asked Cas to give up his top spot in the clouds, to choose free will for the first and last time and fall with the rest of them, that this was where they’d end up. Cas freshly human without a single idea of the creature he’d once been, how much power he’d given up for a single man he believed in more than destiny, a man that he’d even grown to love.
“I want to remember,” Cas admitted softly, eyes sad, and Dean had sort of always figured that, but somehow it’s different to hear him say it out loud with his lips candy stained and his knuckles still bumping against Dean’s.
“Sure, Sammy. Let’s—” He couldn’t say it. The word
Now it was just nervous indifference. A falter in his mechanics that made Castiel unable to even function around Dean, his body unwilling to try.
Dean stilled the second he noticed, hands stopping in their fumble to search through his wallet for cash. A quiet fury rose in him, starting from his feet right up to his temples, white hot and fast brewing like a summer storm.
His voice, weathered like a flag at sea, tore through the darkness and held Dean in its clutches, suspending him in the air. Dean couldn’t answer at first; couldn’t hardly breathe through the echoing pain, but for the first time in hours he could move, and he used every scrap of will inside of him to turn his head.
“It seemed impossible,” Castiel murmured, ignoring Dean and opening his eyes instead. He stared at Dean for a long moment, eyebrows pinched with worry. “I didn’t actually think— but you— and all this time, I’ve been right. I was
“But how did he save you? You were trapped, Cas’s powers had been failing for a while. There’s no way he was strong enough to do anything to Billie,” Sam explained heatedly, and there was that look again— the one that made Dean’s skin crawl, the one that made the emotion on Sam’s face manifest as a physical weight that lived and breathed right in the center of Dean’s chest.
” Sam said. “
Either way.
What it would all mean to have Cas in his entirety, in every way imaginable. To have him sleep caressed and sun kissed beneath early morning sheets, the weight of his fingers tracing Dean’s palm down peaceful corridors, his scent cloaked in Dean’s very bones. To have his warmth as comfort and his hands as a guide that slid over Dean’s skin with familiarity. No more tentativeness, no more skimming the edges and tracing the seams of their story.
and a single thought occurred to Dean like a match striking to life, flickering in front of his eyes tauntingly.
Chief Lundy turned Castiel to face him, palm clamped around his jaw, teeth scraping as he grinned. His eyes flashed black and the race in Dean’s eardrums grew faster, a headless stampede that made him reach for the demon knife tucked into his inside pocket.
Dean just needed to get home.
“Cas? You in there?” There was a long moment of distant shuffling, the sound of Cas’s bed creaking beneath a shifting weight making Dean drop his head with a smile.
“Scar from
“What’s that saying again? What doesn’t kill you…” Dean slowly stepped to the left, and reached behind Sam to take his beer back. He stared at Sam as he drained the rest of it, scratching that urge just behind the swell of his teeth that he knew would only come back stronger, and his heart remained a heavy, broken thing that batted against his sternum. “I’m fine, Sam. Hell, I’ve got beer and bacon in the fridge— I’m friggin’ fantastic. Let it go.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “C’mere,” He said, waving Sam over, and when he found the bulk of Sam’s left shoulder blade to be a whopping four inches off target, the ball of his shoulder raised to a lump beneath skin, it was nothing if not familiar.
Dean smiled. He could promise Sam all he wanted. He could make it sound grand and genuine, threading in a little truth just to pat down the lies. He could tell Sam about the job applications hidden under his skin mags, or the mass of paperwork he’d been trying to stifle through just to even
Dean tried to voice this, all of it and then some. Thought about a suspension in time where he’d fallen to his knees in a land of monsters, his fists curled and his voice finally breaking with tears, giving with honesty that he wished he could navigate now.
“All I’m saying,” Sam starts softly, pulling Dean’s gaze back to him, “is that maybe we’ve earned a little retirement.”
Jack turns and raises his hand in that stiff little wave of his, and Cas smiles. Dean barely keeps from sinking to his knees. He watches Cas pull Jack into a hug. He watches him embrace Sam, who slaps his back and mumbles something before pulling away to swipe a hand under his eyes. Then Cas’s gaze falls on Dean. His smile falters, tilting uneasily.
“I hate you so much,” Dean says, marching the rest of the way toward the door. Miracle scampers after him.
Jack gives him that mild, mystical smile that Dean already hates and says, “The bargain was fulfilled, in simple terms. It had no further claim.”
Cas goes still. “Dean, what are you saying?”
“You were in on this too?” Dean says as Cas fishes his phone out of his slacks. Now the random little salt-and-burn, no-it’s-fine-Dean-please-stay-here-with-the-dog trip Cas and Sam took up to Sioux Falls makes a lot more sense. Dean had figured it was another of Sam’s attempts to force him to “experience” retirement.
“It’s not enough for me!” Dean says, and Cas’s mouth snaps shut.
“There’s a story here,” Charlie says between giggles.
“Dean,” Cas says again. Dean hears him move closer. Dean just keeps going, through the second door and past the table in the corner, past the chair prone at his feet, until he’s standing right where he stood that night.
“Thank god,” Sam says. “I thought I was going to have to watch you keep pretending not to look at each other across rooms for the rest of my natural life.”
“Rib-sticking food,” Benny says, smiling. “Soak up all that beer. I like your style. You know, if we—”
“Eh. Sorta always knew your heart wasn’t in it,” Benny says. He smirks a little at the post in front of him.
“Why do you always act like emotional conversations are pulling teeth?”
“Nah, you ain’t had it right if it ain’t got a roux going,” Benny’s saying as Dean steps inside. He’s got one of the barstools overturned on the floor and he’s kneeling beside it, a screwdriver in his hand. His head’s craned up toward Eileen, who’s kneeling on the back counter and washing the dust from the mirror. Charlie’s closer to the door, sweeping dust bunnies out from under one of the high tops.
Then there were the calls that hadn’t come. Bobby’s voice never came through, and Mom’s name never lit up the phone. Ellen, or Kevin, or… Dad. Jack had promised them a choice. He couldn’t blame them for choosing paradise. But he’d be lying if he said it didn’t sting, if he didn’t keep lighting up his screen every now and again, hoping for a missed call.
“You told me I was the most caring person you’d ever met,” Dean says. “You got that wrong. Maybe I convinced you to start, but… Cas, I’ve never known anyone that cares like you do. You turned on Heaven, on everything you ever thought was right, for me and Sam. You tried to give the angels a better way. How many times, how many ways, have you saved our lives? Hell, you went toe to toe with us just to give Jack a chance at life. You care so much it scares the hell out of me sometimes, and other times… other times I know it makes you the best thing that ever happened to me.”
“Hmm?” Cas’s voice rumbles in his chest. Dean smiles a little.
“Are you going to make some for us?” Eileen says, grinning. “We have to compare.”
They kiss until Dean has to break away to yawn. Cas cards his fingers through Dean’s hair and says, “You should sleep.”
“Show him the video Claire made you record,” Sam says, nodding to Cas’s pocket.
“I’m getting there,” Dean says, having to nudge Miracle out of the way with his knee as he turns back toward the counter again.
Cas smiles again. He catches Dean’s jaw, his palm wide and warm against Dean’s skin. Dean swallows down the nerves that jitter in his stomach and for once in his life, he meets Cas half way.
“Yeah.” Dean rolls his shoulders and looks away. Talking about it makes him feel jittery, like something’s slithering under his skin. He shakes his head, and raises his brush. “Anyway, it’s… hard to forget. Or, you know. Unlearn. Whatever.”
Charlie barks out a laugh as Eileen breaks into a wide grin. Dean can’t look at Benny or he might actually die.
“You know, you’d probably be better tearing this place down and starting from scratch.” Sam pauses next to the railing Dean’s hammering, a long wooden board braced against his shoulder.
“Complicated as in he’s family,” Dean said, picking at a loose hangnail at the corner of his thumb, refusing to look anywhere else. He hoped Cas wasn’t staring at him. “And family is always fucking complicated,” He muttered.
Dean couldn’t remember. He couldn’t remember whether he was supposed to remember, and this wasn’t right. None of this was right, he wasn’t supposed to be here. Hadn’t he made that clear? He didn’t want to fight anymore, he didn’t want to live like this— he didn’t want to
Dean’s unwillingness to move on, his refusal to completely grieve in fear that acceptance was the final step in making Cas’s absence stick. But now his denial felt like naivety. His hope felt misguided, simply untrue, and Dean didn’t know if he could survive this. He didn’t know if he wanted to—
it all really was. The furrow in his brows, the part in his lips and crease in his forehead, all of it connecting to this deep-voiced sense of humor that might fall flat for others, but to Dean made more sense than anything.
That was them.
Next to Dean, Cas pulled weakly at the passenger door handle, but with the car still locked he was met with nothing but a rattling latch. He tried again, firmer this time. The guy apparently didn’t remember how locks worked, and he turned to Dean with pouty eyes, all the while scrambling tiredly at the door.
Dean stared at him widely, immediately becoming defensive. “Because it’s
forever as far as Dean was concerned.
From beside Sam, Eileen gave a humored smile. “It’s not like I have a preference in music here,” She said plainly.
Cas seemed to decide that if Dean couldn’t think of anything interesting enough to tell him on his own, then it was up to him to weave twelve years of friendship out of Dean himself.
Dean leaned into Miracle, eyes squeezing shut. “Yeah, okay… okay.”
He knew Dean was breaking. Knew that Castiel had sacrificed himself, again, and the only reason Dean hadn’t collapsed on the spot the moment it happened was because they had had the world to save.
Sam made a puzzled face, head shaking. “I can come with you.” He protested immediately, throwing the blankets back to stand.
His breath caught.
Stupid too, probably. Reckless in a way that he never fucking was, but, brave all the same.
Absolute disbelief.
Dean looked up to find Cas already staring at him. “Yeah?”
“I guess you're right. I’m probably just…” Dean trailed off, breathing in sharp and harsh as he brought the weight back down to his chest. His vision went soft, prickling with exhaustion, and he bit out a nervous laugh. “He’s just always in his room, you know, and I’m not one to talk but the guy could really use some sun—”
“Where the hell have you been?” Dean countered, stalking forward.
All of it was human and all of it was real, undeniably
“So this is Baby,” Cas said pointlessly, trying for conversation. The effort made Dean smile sadly, nodding. “How long have you had her?”
not…”
It was overwhelming. Too much and not enough at the same time, and Dean felt like it wasn’t something he could face head on.
Dean could feel the eyes as they turned to him. The spell had been broken now, the peace obliterated, and Cas sighed heavily, the irritability in it finally getting Dean’s head to swivel. It took all of two seconds for Dean to recognize the look on Cas’s face, everything inside of him pinched tight, locked in, and suddenly all reservation was tossed to the side, and Dean was crossing the room without a second thought.
“I have a minor theory,” Cas said quietly, looking away.
Not only was his trench coat gone, but his suit and tie were too. He was even wearing tennis shoes, these ancient looking things that had dried mud stuck to the laces and a rip at the toes. Dean could see all the way through to Cas’s socks.
“Well no shit I’m getting pie, but our focus is on you right now. You’re a pie virgin,” Dean froze, realization hitting him full force. He smacked his hand on the table, “Son of a bitch, you’re a pie virgin!”
“You live here?”
“Oh,” Cas looked away, clearing his throat awkwardly. Dean snorted. “That’s embarrassing.”
By the time Castiel woke up, his throat torn raw and his body aching all over, Jack was gone, and Dean was forced to do what he always did: lie.
“I’m almost twenty-one, you know.”
Dean didn’t even have the chance to ask before Cas was opening the device and showing Dean the tape inside, his finger dragging over the lettering as if he was proud that he’d finally been able to decode something on his own.
Dean didn’t hesitate. He ran forward as soon as he saw the blood, Lundy’s body contorting back with pain, hands grabbing at his own face.
“I can’t do shit with assumptions man, come on!” Dean gritted. “Shouldn’t you have this down by now?”
“There’s no reason to—”
Cas gave Dean a sobering look, finally composing himself long enough to finish a tricky part at the corner of his mouth where scar webbing began to stretch. He ran his razor under hot water and wiped at his face with a towel, mouth twisting.
“Hello, Dean. You’re up late,” He frowned over his shoulder when Dean didn’t answer, voice rumbling with hesitant concern, “are you alright?”
“Just fine, thanks,” Dean smiled, feeling a little bad, but then the boy finally looked up and his eyes widened horrifically upon landing on Castiel.
Even Heaven and Hell and the busted world in between had always known, the fragments of their feelings for one another unplanned but fundamentally incapable of being avoided, built on both light and dark, good and evil.
” Dean snapped, and his head lolled to the side, lurching against a wave of black. Fuck, he was tired. “Don’t want to wait just— take me back. ‘Need to get home, need to get Cas, I— Sammy, I miss Cas. I want Cas.”
Dean didn’t mean to eavesdrop, really. He could still vaguely recall a twenty-something-year-old Mary scolding him for being too curious for his own good, helplessly interested in everyone’s life but his own, listening in on chattering parents and staying up late at the top of the stairs just to hear John come home. That, at the least, had been an assurance more than anything. Four-year-old Dean had never known whether his dad would come home looking to argue with Mary, and he could never sleep through the night unless he saw for himself what the outcome was.
“Does it hurt?” Dean asked anxiously.
“Cas would have come out the other side coughing his lungs out, Dean. Angels ripping each other’s graces out used to be a form of treason, it’s different than angels doing it themselves— different from
Of all things, it’s this specific sentence that had Dean breaking his silence and looking up from the container of Jif he’d been inspecting pointlessly.
As if the guy wasn’t unbearable enough fully clothed. Now Dean had to deal with him when his shirt was rucked up, pants unbuckled and pulled down just enough for Dean to see sharp hip bones and a happy trail that made his gut lurch.
” She huffed.
” Castiel said, soft, and Dean could hear the words that were missing, the breathless
“Where are we?” Dean asked.
How many years had he been thinking about this?
Dean moved to stand again, brushing himself off more out of habit than necessity. “We, uh,” Dean started unnervingly. He looked at Cas, uncertainty pressing hot around the ears, and cleared his throat before he went on. “We should take a look at that shiner you got there.”
Dean could barely speak through the fire in his throat, “Sammy…”
Dean heaved a sigh, but his eyes were pinched in amusement, cheeks a light shade of pink as he stepped closer. The closest he’d ever gotten to Cas really, hand rising to the side of his neck as he carefully slid the razor across Cas’s jawline.
Castiel’s confusion was obvious then. Upfront and glaring, flashing hazardously through his slitted eyes. He sat up further in bed and moved his leg away from Dean’s hand, jostling his IV in the process.
“I ain’t the one wearing insect pants, Cas,” Dean pointed out, nudging Cas’s leg. He grew quiet when he noticed Castiel come to a full body halt, his razor hovering in the air just inches away from the left side of his chin. Right where smooth skin met raised scar tissue. Slowly, Dean said, “I was wondering when or how you were gonna deal with… that.”
“I can’t imagine what that’s like,” Eileen said, hands moving just as gently as her voice.
Castiel hesitated.
Dean stopped, purposely letting his boots scrape against the hardwood in a way that always made Sam bitch.
“That’s enough, Cas,” Dean said, the vastness of his memory sparking that fear in Dean again. “We don’t want to—”
“Is that how it’s been this whole time? All these months you’ve just… sat and watched?” Sam asked.
by, that it stole the air right out of him, his insides splintering beneath a ceaseless weight. Back when Dean was still bright eyed and soft edged, blowing through towns just as fast as he’d breeze through women, and he’d believed that Sam leaving him for Stanford was the worst betrayal there was. That family was blood bound and you couldn’t escape it or change it or wish for anything more.
Dean couldn’t pretend that he wasn’t scared. That he didn’t have every reason in the world to believe that Cas would be ripped away from him the second they even tried, the moment they allowed themselves to give. But Dean had wasted away too much of his life to let things like this go anymore. To let
“At least I ain’t drinking pea mush out of a snorkel.”
It turned out Cas had gotten a sleeve of Nutter Butter rather than a box of Milk Duds, and Dean spent a whole five minutes enthusing about how Cas missed out on the superior snack before inevitably reaching his hand across the seat, silently asking for a bite.
Yes. Yes, he’d done things like that before. Worse even. Bloodier. Cas decided not to bring it up again.
Dean clenched his fist and thought hard, needing something other than the answer he wanted to give. He scrambled for it, grabbing at the first thing he could think of, and even that tore a path through his heart that he hadn’t visited in years.
It wasn’t until Cas stepped forward, unsheathing something from his sleeve and
because at least that part wasn’t a hopeless cause anymore. At least Cas loving him wasn’t some wasted pipe dream.
“Take care of my dog, alright?” He tried for lighthearted, anything to stop the ache in his chest from spreading, but Cas was quiet. “Bye, Cas.”
Either way was perfect, but Dean didn’t think it would change much.
“It was possessing a man,” Cas argued back, a trace of bitterness creeping into his words.
Cas didn’t want the excuse.
Dean bit back a laugh, eyes crinkling as he took the empty glass back and patted his brother on the shoulder.
“I know it doesn’t make any sense, but I do,” He rambled on. “I remember flying everywhere— always flying to something, or someone.”
Sam blinked at him with wide eyes, not expecting Dean’s bluntness. He sat up with a grunt and brushed his hair back with two large hands, trying to hide his sniffling.
“Did you?” Cas threw back, not unkindly despite Dean deserving as much. “It was clear to me that you were resisting, putting it off. I didn’t want to make things harder on you by pushing my desires.”
Dean had never felt anything like it.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted lightly, head popping into view. He winced a little as he climbed into the car and blindly reached back for his seatbelt.
"Cas! What the fuck- get off her!" Dean yelled furiously, hands moving forward to wrap around Cas’s ankles and yank him roughly, but he faltered at the last second and watched a flash of panic spring across Cas’s eyes before a nose bumped softly against his.
Castiel’s eyes flew to Dean from across the room, responding so fluently that for a second he resembled the old Cas. The real Cas, the one that felt a million miles away, buried alive and kicking to get out.
“But I’ve already chosen,” Jack said, easy as a summer’s breeze, lacking all the same misery Sam could still feel like an old sore. Jack smiled then, soft and well-mannered, sporting the kind of certainty Sam didn’t think he’d felt until his mid-twenties, and asked, “Why would I want to be anywhere else but home?”
Distantly, Dean could feel his body moving. Hunter instinct sent him ducking out of the way and throwing his arms up over his head, shielding himself from broken glass. But all he could hear was Cas’s breathing; pulsated and fast as if every gulp of air was being punched out of him, forced from his lungs. There was electricity prickling somewhere above his head, glass cracking beneath his heel, but through a haze of light and shadows— all Dean could see was Cas.
Cas stared at him, expression wavering, “Dean.”
Cas didn’t even bother trying to pet Miracle. He went straight in for the kind of hug Dean knew all too well, arms shaking, back bent desperately just to feel something close.
He must have gotten a hold of it in his scramble out of bed, grabbing the first weapon he saw. Dean almost wanted to smile.
Cas didn’t say anything when Dean finally pulled into a motel. Dean just turned off the ignition, dragged his duffel from the back seat to the front, and Cas was already getting out of the car without a word.
wallet, and flipped it open towards Cas expectantly, a sad smile rising to his face.
Dean could tell she was trying, for the both of them. Dean’s lips curled into a sad smile.
Sam and Dean left for Minnesota the next day on the account of nothing but weather spikes and glowing bodies. A lead that was barely there and yet for some reason, caught Dean’s interest.
“Okay, easy there champ,” Dean rolled his eyes fondly, taking the bottle back as Cas continued to cough his way through it. “And to think, you used to have quite the tolerance for this crap.”
A different human. One in particular. Stronger than himself and responsible for a weight in Castiel that had been dragged with him from somewhere else. As to where from, Castiel didn’t know.
And god, didn’t Dean know it.
The light vanished, soaking back into his skin, and Jack leaned into Sam gratefully, the pain on his face never wavering. Castiel didn’t move; Dean had to ask anyway.
Dean frowned. “They already left? This early?”
“No? And why not?”
Dean stammered, “Is… is this—”
“I mean you’re family,” Sam heaved. And he always had been, through the lies and hurt and countless misunderstandings— Jack had never stopped being family, but Jack didn’t know that. Sam wasn’t sure he’d ever really known. “I mean we missed you.
Dean got out of the car with his expression wiped clean, gaze steady even when his heartbeat said otherwise. He was careful as he walked over the light layer of snow that had made its way to the ground over the last few minutes, moving across the Impala to stand by his friend.
“Dean,” Sam’s tone turned serious, those eyes of his softening just enough for Dean to feel his shoulders deflate. “When are you gonna tell me what’s really going on?”
” Cas repeated, incredulous if not downright panicked, and Dean tensed up violently, eyes widening as Cas continued, uncertain, “
“I told you. I am everywhere, now.”
“I’m happy for you, jerk!” Sam calls after him. Dean flips him the bird.
“I’m happy for you, though,” Benny says, painting a stripe down the next post. “It’s ‘bout time you got your shit together.”
“No, it’s…” Dean gestures vaguely. “Cas made a deal, right? With the Empty.”
“No, shut up, just…” Dean stops at the counter’s edge. He takes a long breath. Miracle sits down at his feet and pants up at him.
“I stayed on that floor for hours, you know,” Dean says, his voice scraping rust from his throat. “After you… after.”
“I made the first move,” Cas and Benny say at the same time. Again.
“Between living and enjoying life?” Cas studies him for a moment. The refrigerator hums behind them. Finally, Cas sighs and looks down at their hands. “Dean, building a life with you is more than I ever dared to hope I’d get. I thought it would be too bold to imagine what it would look like.” He looks up, running his thumb over Dean’s knuckles. “But I think this sounds good.”
“Little surprised it took you two so long, though,” Benny says.
He looks at the spot he’d crumpled into on the floor. He’d wept until his eyes ached, until it left him shaking and nauseous. His head felt at once heavy and hollow, full of nothing but the echo of Cas’s voice, over and over. And one moment Dean would be angry, slamming his fist down against the floor as he growled, “You stupid son of a bitch.” And in the next moment the anger would bleed out of him as he tried to figure out who he was talking to: Cas, or himself. Cas, for pulling the kind of insane, reckless, ridiculous stunt he always pulls to save Dean’s worthless life. Or himself, for letting him, for not getting up again. Then Cas, for leaving Dean with words too honest and beautiful to look at, bright with grace Dean hasn’t ever deserved, and leaving Dean’s eyes burning sure as if he’d shed his vessel. Then himself, for his own words sticking in his throat, for answering with nothing but tears, for wasting so much god damn time.
“Didn’t have to.” Sam’s smile widens as he slips his hands in his pockets. “Mostly, I got about as far as ‘Dean wants to open a hunter bar’ and they were on board. There’s, uh — a little from Jody and Donna, and the girls, and Garth, and—”
The screen zooms onto Claire’s mouth as she says, “I know where you live.” Then it cuts off.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sam’s jaw tighten. Slowly, Sam says, “Okay.”
Charlie and Eileen fall into a fresh round of giggles as Dean mumbles, “Nope, not doing this,” and carries his bottle toward the doorway Cas is still blocking.
Cas tilts his head again as he settles, stiff as always, his knees brushing Dean’s thigh. “I don’t know the particulars of mixing alcohol beyond its effect on the body and the make of the—”
Dean is going to kill Sam with his bare hands.
“All right, not a bar, then. A farm. A garage. I don’t know.”
Cas’s thumb strokes low enough to brush Dean’s ear. “Doesn’t mean he isn’t listening.”
—the certainty of knowing they’re out there, living, working, being—until, like a banked fire, it was gone. To get it back after that stagnant emptiness is a feeling he’ll never have the right words for. He’s never felt so glad to hear the handbell of a passing bike, or the screeching laugh of a woman sitting at an outdoor table at the restaurant behind them. A car passes, ruffling Dean’s hair, and he smiles.
Benny chuckles again. “Well, you figured it out in the end. Guess that’s what matters.”
“Sorry! I’m sorry, I just… I mean, you’re—” He cuts himself off, holding a hand up and then dropping it into his lap and schooling his face. “I’m sorry. Go ahead.”
Benny’s call was the one that surprised Dean the most. Jack had kept his promise, and he’d heard from Charlie less than a day after Cas came back, and Jo after that, and a few others. But Benny’s call had been the one that had Dean nearly dropping the phone. He’d come back human, but otherwise the same old Benny, that gentle drawl and that easy smile Dean could hear in the voice as he said, “Hey, brother. Don’t suppose you remember little old me?”
Dean yanks him into his arms. One wraps around his back, tight enough to bruise, while the other spans his shoulder. Dean’s palm cups the back of Cas’s neck, his eyes shutting. It takes Cas one surprised moment to raise his arms, but he does, pulling Dean impossibly closer as his fists curl into Dean’s jacket.
“Have you often heard me say things I don’t mean?” Cas quirks an eyebrow.
“A bar?”
“My feelings should not have been put on you like that, and I — your friendship means more to me than anything. I don’t wish for what I said to jeopardize that.”
The old man’s name is Henry Mason, and he doesn’t trust banks. Dean’s pretty damn sure it’s not that easy, that he’ll probably be begging Sam to do some fancy key work later, but whatever. If it means no one’s looking at his credit or his record or whatever the hell else he definitely doesn’t want anyone looking at, then sign Dean up. On the dotted line.
“Yeah,” Dean says quietly. He draws another lopsided circle over Cas’s ribs. “Yeah, okay.”
Cas reaches over, pulling Dean’s hand away from his neck and catching it in his own. “Dean, do you think I wouldn’t say something if I didn’t want to be part of this?”
“So no,” Dean presses on, because he broke open the dam and now he can’t stop the flood. “No, you’re not getting another chance to tear yourself out of my life, like it’s worth living without you in it. Like I don’t feel the hole in every room where you should be when you’re gone.”
“Come on, though, I’m serious,” Dean says, rubbing at his neck like that’s going to hide anything. “Is this what you want? Because shit, Cas, it’s not gonna be the dream if you’re just gonna wish you were somewhere else. It’s with you or it’s… we find something else.”
“We just wanted to take a minute to thank you all for being part of this,” Sam says. “So, now I’m gonna make my brother embarrass himself and say a few words.”
“It’s not! I said it’s not!” Dean throws his hands up. The pot sways again, the hook rattling a little.
The laugh leaves Dean in a rush of air. “All right, fine.”
Dean turns his face into his hand, chuckling again as he hands the phone back to Cas. He slides his palm down his nose to hide his mouth behind it for a moment.
Cas stares at him, wide eyes beginning to glass over. Dean forces himself not to look away.
“You were weird about it!” Dean looks up.
. It’s him.
“Is the world ending again?”
Dean watches Cas lower himself onto the stool. “Okay, but what about you?”
“I think you’ve done worse things to make me happy,” Dean says, a little blunter than he means to.
The bar is all dark, polished now, sanded smooth. Posters line the walls, old western movies and old concert ads, with a few framed records here and there. Scattered among them are photos, old prints of their parents and a few of Sam and Dean, a few more of their friends. One of Dean and Castiel that Sam took in the library when he took they weren’t looking. He caught Cas smiling, so that one sits where Dean can see it from the bar. And above that bar, painted across the mirror that covers half the wall and holds most of the liquor shelves, is the name: Second Chance Saloon.
“Wait, wait, the Empty, what about—” Dean whips his head around to look at Jack.
Dean holds on too long. He knows Sam must be staring, he knows other people can see. Still he holds on, long enough that even Cas tries to pull away. But Dean turns his head until his nose brushes Cas’s hair, until he can smell that faint, clean, after-rain scent that always seems to cling to Cas’s clothes. So Dean knows it’s real.
Benny paints a slow stroke down the post closest to the stairs. “You know there’s no hard feelings, right?”
“What? Wait, whoa, how you even know I’m — that I’d be into—?”
“Burdened me?” Dean finally turns around, wide-eyed. “
Dean forces his shoulders back down. “Yeah. Yeah, I—sure. Couldn’t ask for anyone better.”
There’s a dent in the door from Billie’s fist. If he looks on the other side, he knows the sigil will still be there, that the blood of Cas’s palm will be dry and brown and flaking. The chair is still overturned in the middle of the devil’s trap. Dean stares at the concrete blocks the Empty had clawed through, a black, wet void ripping open between them. He can still see Cas slipping into its depths like he’d slipped beneath the waves of the reservoir in South Dakota. Loss upon loss upon loss. Dean’s hand curls tight around the doorframe. He knocks back the whiskey in one swallow and sets the glass on the nearest shelf, next to an old, yellowed box of papers.
“Are you kidding me?” Dean whirls back around.
It doesn’t look like much the first time Dean sees it. The wooden siding and the slats lining the floor of the porch sit loose, all of them a rain-battered, sun-bleached grey. The roof slouches a little on one side, and the parking lot is more dirt than concrete. Weeds headbutt their way through the cracks between parking spaces. The door sticks and whines when Dean works the handle and shoulders it open. Inside, the tables are buried under eight years of dust that might as well be eighty. It feels more like walking into a crypt than a bar.
Cas squeezes his hand. “This is my home now, Dean. I will always come back to it.”
Dean runs his teeth over his lip. “Is there?”
. Is he going to have to do this to himself every time? He feels the back of his neck heating, and one glance at Cas says he’s got a damn good view of it. Smug bastard.
Dean tenses a little. He can’t help it. Cas tightens his hand before Dean gets one word into a reply and says, “He wants to reshape things. Make it better. I wouldn’t be staying.”
It’s Sam that gets him most of the money. When he hands Dean the envelope while they’re standing in the bunker’s kitchen, Dean has to drop onto one of the stools, stunned.
“Are you?” Cas tilts his chin up.
He’ll never forget watching the world blossom back into life, the bright swell of sound opening into the air and flourishing. He’d never understood that feeling of
Even the months he’d stolen for himself with Lisa, he couldn’t really leave it behind. He couldn’t stop twitching at every wrong sound, every sudden movement. And that had blown up in his face, anyway. Same as always. He finally figured he’s just never been meant for that kind of life. And if he slows down now, he’ll have to think too hard about what “meant for” even means, now that he knows Chuck was the one with the pen all along. Christ. He needs another beer if he’s going to start down that road. But really, the settle down, sleep in, smell the roses life? Always seemed like the kind of thing that happened to other people. It’s not that it doesn’t have its appeal, it’s just… he’s not sure he knows who he is if he isn’t five minutes and a duffle bag from the next hunt.
Cas cuts himself off. Dean takes a few more steps into the room, past shelves of broken weapons and boxes and binders. His eyes stay fixed on the wall.
Cas is wearing the dark teal sweater that nearly had Dean choking on his own tongue the first time Cas walked out of the dressing room tugging on his sleeves. Even in the low light of the bar, and the soft neon with it, it catches that bright blue in Cas’s eyes. Dean swallows and folds their fingers together. And yeah, so the height of the bar might be making him braver than any personal growth, but… baby steps.
Benny hums an acknowledgement. He slings his arm up to rest against his knee and sets his can down on the porch in front of him.
Henry gives him two weeks to come up with five thousand in cash, even. Dean has to ask him twice if he heard the number right.
“It really doesn’t sound fine.”
“Not a chance,” she says, elbowing him again. She looks at him in a way that’s all his Charlie. Not that Apocalypse World Charlie wasn’t still cool, but… god, he’d missed the real deal. The one who rolls her head toward him and twists her lips to murmur out the corner of her mouth, “You think I didn’t have you pegged after you talked me through flirting with that guy?”
“When, um… when you see Jack? Tell him… tell him thank you for me. I never thanked him. For bring all this back, for…” He swallows. “For bringing you back.”
“Careful,” Dean says, “If you make it good, I’m gonna make you put it on the menu.”
“What, love?” Benny shifts back off his feet, sitting down against the porch floor. “Or men?”
It’s not, really. It digs in a little too sharp and too close, and leaves him feeling a little too raw. But whatever, it’s nice to hear Charlie laugh, it’s nice to have Charlie here to laugh at him, and… maybe he really should’ve expected Benny wouldn’t hold back. No wonder he fled the damn bunker. Dean glances at Cas and gives him a tight smile. “You know, your technique could use some work, too.”
A smile fights its way onto Dean’s lips. “Why do you always manage to make these things sound like a root canal?”
But Dean’s laughing too hard to hear the rest. The phone gets pulled away and settles on Jody’s face. “Hi, Dean. Listen, I know what you’re going to say, so here’s what I’m going to say. Not a single one of us would give this to you if we didn’t want to. And we’re not taking it back. So use it. Or I have it on very good authority that Sam and Eileen are going to run away to the Bahamas with it.”
God, taking him shopping is the best thing Dean’s ever done in his life. Really, it was the threat of doing laundry twice as often that sealed the deal, because a week of Cas stealing Dean’s t-shirts to sleep in—well, to lounge in while Dean slept—had piled up. Cas had balked at first, protesting that he liked his clothes fine. And it wasn’t that Dean didn’t like seeing Cas stretching out his old Zeppelin shirt, or draped in a hoodie Dean hadn’t touched since the first time it landed on the coat hook near his door. It’s just that… he wanted Cas to have his own things. To choose to have his own things. And choose to keep them in the bunker. That was the point of all of this, anyway, right? Choosing their own lives, their own paths, choosing where to go from here. Or not go. And anyway, Cas would’ve ruined that damn suit jacket carrying around armloads of wood in it. That’s the excuse Dean actually went with, in the end.
“Dean,” Cas says softly.
“Chuck made many mistakes,” Jack says, after a moment. “And those that fell victim, those that lost their lives for the sake of his story? Those that you miss? I’ll give them the choice they didn’t have. Their lives back if they want them, or they rest they’ve earned.”
Dean had said. But what he’d really meant was—
There was a lot Cas still didn’t know, and a lot Cas
"No, that's—" Castiel shook his head. "I didn't think it was important before, but now..." He cut himself off, brow pinching uncomfortably. “For you, Naomi's hold on me only seemed like a few weeks' time, but for me it felt like years. It
“I feel… uncomfortable.” Cas complained, hands folding over his stomach.
Sam’s giggling quieted down immediately, drawling into more of a whine as he rubbed the sole of his boot across the floor and muttered about chair marks, but the bunker didn’t have the chance to fall silent. Slowly, almost like a computer blinking to life, starting with a shudder of air and a churn of heat, Castiel began to laugh.
Dean barely spared him a glance, mouth quirking upwards as he mouthed, “Gas?”
It’s a testament of how much Dean’s really changed when he answered, not even flinching, “He died on the job.”
Castiel buried his face into the side of Miracle’s neck and rocked them back and forth for a moment, the silence turning sadder the longer Cas clung to Miracle like an anchor, shoulders rising with heavy breaths that shook through every exhale.
“I got it,” Dean swallowed. There was a shake in his voice, “M’ not mad, kid.”
“But now you’re realizing my hugs kick ass, right?”
Cas’s skin flared beneath his hand, warm and dampened soft, blue eyes flocking to Dean’s with purpose.
It’s something Dean should have asked him years ago. It’s something Dean’s wanted for even longer.
“Gross,” Dean pulled a face. “I’ll pass.”
There’s a lingering pause, long enough to make Dean bristle with shame for even asking. But Jody spared him soon enough— a punch of what sounded like a breathless laugh crackling through the speaker.
that Dean finally relented and dug through his pocket to call Jody, figuring he could compromise.
This alien being that was strung together with grace and essence who could burn down cities, rip apart demons with a single touch, was the same Cas who Dean let ride shotgun.
” She smiled, softening up. Dean could imagine she’d punch him affectionately in the arm if he was there. “
for my own selfish reasons and I—”
One stayed heavy and alert at the inside of his jacket, ready to grab his angel blade if some of Heaven’s douchebags decided to rain down on them, and the other was holding onto Cas.
There were still so many things wrong.
It wasn’t an unfamiliar feeling. Dean had been here plenty of times before. Sinking in the kind of standstill that made him feel sixteen all over again, sneaking through the dark and staring at John through livid tears, too scared to raise his voice or raise his fist because
It had worked out, in the end. Four years and a missing dad later and Dean was with his brother again. But while Sam had been puking into solo cups and falling in love, those years had found Dean wasting away in back alleys and drive bars and truck stops, hunger pushing his ribs out while his face caved inwards. Scarce food and even scarcer money making the idea of dropping to his knees for some nameless john in a public restroom seem necessary rather than vile.
Castiel's throat bobbed.
Dean snatched up the Impala's keys before he could come up with much of a plan. He waved them in front of the group, smiling like he meant it, and soon they were all piling into the car with Dean leading the way. Dean knew heading to the nearest bar wasn’t much of an idea, but he was eager for a drink and lying was always easier without the drone of silence.
But now, left alone without a word from Jack or a single idea how to get Cas back, Dean’s vision was tunneling, and Sam didn’t even know where to begin.
Dean almost never came down here. He’d rather be doing pretty much anything than sweating his ass off throwing around dumbbells and risking his life using seventy-year old equipment, but there were only so many places Dean could go where he wouldn’t risk running into Cas, and at this point he was desperate; agreeing to spot Sam was an all new low.
It got quiet between them quickly, Dean laser focused and hyper aware, Cas breathing in slow and calculated, a noise in his chest catching every few seconds. He was nervous. That much Dean could tell, which was as much of a relief as it was a damn nuisance. One of them needed to be feeling somewhat sane in this situation, and that sure as hell wasn’t going to be Dean.
“Fuck! Fine! He made some kinda deal when Jack died the first time, to get the Empty to leave him alone. His life for Jack’s. But the Empty wanted him to suffer. So the deal was, when he experienced a moment of true… like, happiness, it would pounce.”
Sam leans forward. “What do you mean ‘there it is’? That’s it? You just left him hanging when you could be making out with him right now?”
“He… experienced a moment of—?” Sam frowns. “Did you—?”
“You seriously — Cas, Jack brought you back from the fucking Empty, gave you — gave all of us — a life without an apocalypse in it and you’re going to spend it burying your feelings and telling yourself it’s fine?” Dean’s hands bunch into fists at his sides.
“He’s got a lot of people doing that now.”
“Well, I can’t let a lady down, can I?” Benny says, and Charlie snorts. She looks over at Dean and winks.
“No, it’s not — look, everything’s fine, it’s just—”
“Of course I was in on it,” Cas says, like it should have been obvious he’d drop everything and help Sam buy Dean a bar. And, all right, when he puts it like that, maybe it should’ve been. And that’s… a lot.
Anger strikes the sadness from Cas’s face. “I wish to spend that life with my friends. That’s enough for me. But if my feelings are so offensive to you—”
Dean snorts. He can hear Sam hammering around the side of the building, and the distant murmur of Cas’s voice between the beats. He paints another stripe, this time along the handrail at the top.
Cas looks up at him. “The way I understand, we’ve already figured some of it out. Hunting together, living together, sharing time. I’d like it to involve a lot more kissing, if you’re amenable.”
Dean digs his teeth into the back of his lip. He really needs to get a case of beer out here already. “Yeah, well. You know me.”
“I won’t be hands on,” Jack says moments later, as Dean’s still watching the world take its first breath after a long, terrible coma. “Chuck put himself in the story, and that was his mistake. But I learned from you, and from my mother, and from Castiel that when people have to be their best, they can be. And that’s what to believe in.”
