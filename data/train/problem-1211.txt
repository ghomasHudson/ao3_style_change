The man didn't seem to get the sarcasm. "Don't look like one, do I? A funny little man, driving a cab. But it's perfect, actually. No one ever thinks anything of you, you're just a back of a head."
Holmes abandoned the toast and suddenly all his attention was on John. It would have been unnerving to be the target of such intense eyes if he'd been a free man, but getting such a look from a slave was disturbing. The slave leant slightly over the table. "Just one. How do you feel about the violin?"
The box smelled of chips and there was someone's number scribbled on the window with words "for hot wet pussy" over it. And the phone kept ringing as he tentatively reached for it.
Mummy was dead. That much he knew. Daddy was bleeding, but he'd still been conscious when the rescuers came, and he and Mycroft were pulled away from the car. The front seat passenger of the other car was dead, too. She hadn't been wearing a seat belt. She'd flown right through the windshield and splattered head first to the road. The driver was in bad shape, but already taken away by the first ambulance. Mycroft lay strapped on stretchers, ready to be taken to the ambulance. Something was wrong with Mycroft's leg. They both had bruises and cuts from the glass, but apart from that Sherlock was unharmed.
Sherlock slid his hand under the pyjama bottoms. It would be more convincing if he looked the part. He would kneel down, undo John's belt and flies. Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed as he planned while stroking himself, imagined to detail what he would do to convince John this was what they both wanted. He would guide him to sit on the bed, pull down his trousers. He could start with teasing touches through John's pants. Help him off his shirt. Kiss his neck and roll his tongue around his nipple, trace the scar on his shoulder and caress his thighs. He could almost feel fingers curling in his hair, pressing him down, urging him to get closer and begin.
"Why not," John shrugged. "Just make sure tonight goes well and I've no problem with you bringing your friend over. This is a one time offer, though," he clarified. "You are not allowed to bring visitors without my permission."
Making his master lose his face was one of the worst things a slave could do. Thirty years back it would have been legal for John to kill Holmes on the spot. Eighty years back it would have been expected of him.
"Why would anyone be fan of a slave?" the cabbie countered instantly. "Some people have more unusual interests than others."
From the corner of his eye Sherlock saw John's left hand move and he quickly closed his eyes to take the slap that never came. Instead, he felt careful fingers on the bridge of his nose.
"There's been two or three times I maybe went a bit too far in Afghanistan. But I didn't kill anyone or permanently harm anyone. And I stopped others from doing too much harm more often than I remember. But yes. I've killed a slave. Once when I was just a kid, once in university."
The slave shivered in his wet clothes and backed away from the door when the two men forced their way past John into the corridor.
This wouldn't have happened if he'd just opened his damn mouth and said he didn't want Holmes. That he couldn't manage a slave with history like that and that he would've preferred a female. Even a male would have done, if it had been a normal one.
Rumour had it that the late Powers couple had already bedded the young slave they kept as their son's pet. Why else was the poor slave burnt to death in the master bedroom's cupboard that by all means should have belonged to the house slave?
"I texted Mrs Wilson's phone that I want to meet there. If someone randomly found the phone, they'd either ignore it or might try reply to it. But if the murderer reads it, he'll panic. It's only been a few hours since he killed."
John sat at the desk, contemplating whether to write about the odd meeting with the woman in the car. Ella might think he made it up. But at least there were Holmes and Mike to write about.
"Master", or occasionally "mistress", was his new full stop and little else ever came out of his mouth these days. Everyone here was a master. At first the change in his accent made them bully him even worse, but eventually they grew bored of him.
London was his home. If John took him away from London, what would he have left? London gave him anonymity. Here he could walk the streets and not be looked as a slave. If John took him away, if they left London, if they moved somewhere smaller, people would soon learn what he was. There would be no escape from it. No more mysteries for him to solve.
"No," Sherlock replied. He truly didn't. Not apart from a few very basic steps. What he'd done had not been capoeira –it had just been a manifestation of his panicked state. Even if he had known capoeira, he would have never admitted it. Not even to a master like John. A slave who knew how to fight was a danger to the free people. Only the most loyal of slaves could ever study martial arts.
an assistant", Holmes insisted. "Someone who understands about forensics, a cleanup slave won't do. But not Anderson."
. The stigma still existed, faded as it was because it hadn't been re-tattooed since his previous owner bought him. Even the stigma meant little now, but he would have preferred the familiar code to being nothing. His collar labeled him as No. 38, but it wasn't his name. He didn't have a name here.
"A slave has a far better chance of freedom by escaping than by signing that contract. My brother is a fool."
He lifted his head to look at him and placed an apologetic smile on his lips. "I could start over now, but I'll need to wash the–"
"I am a slave and legal property of my master. My entire being belongs to my master, whom I love and fear and respect, for he is my world and his wish is my command. I was born to serve and I strive to please."
John shrugged and handed his empty mug for Holmes to wash. "Seems alright to me. You could learn a few things from him. He seems much more well behaved."
"Four times", John repeated. "And apparently that's only counting the times it went to the records. Considering what I know about you so far, I really wouldn't be surprised if there were more. I ought to get you a collar."
"That’s brilliant. Quite brilliant," John marvelled. As soon as the words left his mouth, the phone vibrated and the ring tone started playing. He looked at Holmes. The slave picked the phone on the bed, smirked, but did not answer it.
But that would mean he'd never get to keep his earnings ever again. He didn't ask for anyone to pay, but people did. It was the only way apart from begging for him to get money he could call his own. He should rather suffer through a few more hours of humiliation than be deprived of the little amount of leeway money gave him. It wasn't like he truly had a face to lose.
"I'd rather not talk about it," Holmes said under his breath. He took a generous gulp of water John had given him.
“Quiet”, she ordered. “Not a word unless he wants to hear you speak. You’re a troublemaker and probably should’ve been dispatched a long time ago. You aren’t worth your own paperwork.”
"I'm just a slave, Sherlock. InS will find me a new owner, too. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Just take care of yourself. Be good to your owners."
, he thought while checking his watch. Knowing the buses, there was no guarantee of when the next one that accepted slaves would come. He wouldn’t have time to wait if he wanted to make it home and have some time before his job interview. He still needed to fix some parts of his CV. Waiting at InS had taken considerably more time than he had thought and Ella had practically forced him to look for a job.
Holmes sighed, ready to open his mouth and apologise, but John cut him off: "I'd actually prefer if you called me John. In private, I mean", he added quickly. Having his slave address him by his first name in public would be too pathetic even for a desperately lonely, useless soldier like him.
John extended his arm and beckoned with his fingers. He wasn't angry, not really. He was just doing what he was expected to do. Sherlock pursed his lips, but obeyed the wordless order and fetched the rattan cane. John didn't even bother getting up. He hit Sherlock's thighs once through trousers and gave the cane back for him to put away.
"Just a bit nauseous. Disorientated," he explained. "He– I didn't– Someone shot him through the window. I tried to ask him about the pills, but– The blood, I thought, I thought– I did
"Holmes," he called, but no reply came. He tried again with a more demanding tone and carefully shook the man with his foot.
For the past three years he had learnt to embrace it. He had obeyed and served, and he had learnt his place. He had been happy. It had been such a relief, such a heavy burden off his shoulders, to
Sherlock tried telling himself there was nothing to worry about or be ashamed of. His mistress was in the room and he could trust her. Even if he were to be rented, nothing would happen right now. At least so he hoped. Mrs Spedding's hand rested on his hip and the other cupped his left testicle, then the other. She lifted his penis, weighing it on her palm, briefly squeezing it and pulling the foreskin.
. Had been. Now he was furniture. His legal rights to some extent were worse than those of pets. You couldn't hit a dog after all, but you could hit a slave.
"If I'd successfully escaped, why would I've let myself be captured after three years? The third time
Holmes hissed in pain, but it was drowned by the sound of the belt smacking onto his back again. He unfolded his arms and leant against the wall with a muffled whine as his master struck him again and again with each word he spoke.
John had felt a sting of disappointment. It hadn't initially been the kind of job he would have wanted, but it would have paid well and as inappropriate it was, there was something about the idea of crime and homicide scenes that fascinated him, even if it was just to clean them up after the bodies had been examined and moved. The ad he'd seen online had specifically said they hired ex-soldiers, people who already knew they could handle it. He knew he could handle it.
His brother had arrived entirely unannounced. Sherlock opened the door and then tried to close it right into Mycroft's face the moment he recognised him.
The slave smirked, but the faked smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Shut your mouth or I’ll find better use for it.”
She grimaced slightly. “There was some trouble with it in the past, apparently. An escapee and foul-mouthed. I suppose that's why they picked it an owner like you. It needs more discipline than an average slave to stay in line.”
John shrugged. "Well I don't feel like selling you. And as it's been established, I can't sell you."
The little blue dot on the map was still on a road and kept moving. He told the driver to follow, hoping he wouldn't catch up too late.
But now they were abandoning him. He would be given to new masters, and Sherlock knew it shouldn't change anything, but it did. They weren't throwing him away, but it felt as if they were. How could he ever be happy serving an owner other than Lydia Marlowe?
He felt relieved, lying on the floor, but somehow inadequate as well. Sickeningly so. It was a feeling that belonged to the slave side of him, the part of him he wished to have nothing to do with. If Dr Watson didn't want to sleep with him, it was a
John glared back at the slave. If he were to bend now, he would lose all his credibility in the eyes of everyone at the scene. He used the cane to push between Holmes's shoulder blades and when the slave bowed a little deeper he moved it to push the back of Holmes's neck. Seconds seemed to drag by like hours, but finally there was one last shaky rebellious breath drawn before Holmes lowered his eyes and kowtowed to everyone's relief.
"A man called Sherlock Holmes doesn't even exist," Sherlock snarled at the cabbie. "If you truly researched me so thoroughly beforehand, you should've checked. Or did my "fan" forget to mention? I'm
He bowed again, and with a last meaningful glance at Holmes the slave walked out of the flat. Holmes himself was left irritated.
"Excellent. Come along, master." The slave strode to the blue and white tape, Lestrade following close behind. It was unsettling to see a slave walk with such confidence, as if he owned the place. Neither men paid attention to John trying to keep up with them.
He didn't fight when Sandy gently pulled him away. They watched through the window how Redbeard was loaded into a car and taken away. She pulled him into a tight embrace.
Behind him, the slave had got up and was pulling a shirt over his head, silently eying at his new master. Just when John got the newly acquired papers safely closed to his bag the slave slipped into a surprisingly expensive looking dark coat and bent over to pick up the duffle bag and the dressing gown. Without a word he placed the latter one on the desk and bowed to his handler. She didn’t acknowledge the gesture in slightest and kept her eyes fixed on John, who smiled for the lack of better response.
John had allowed it, but when they stepped in and Holmes all but collapsed on his spot with his shoes and coat still on, just dropping John's cane aside, John wasn't happy. While he removed his jacket, the slave pulled the blanket to cover himself entirely. The pink suitcase still sat on the floor.
The second last chapter dealing with A Study Pink. Hope you enjoyed. Happy New Year, fellow slavelockians! (Is that even a word? But I'm assuming you must like slavelock at least a little since you're here.)
The relatives believed Carl kidnapped and the press only fed this notion –but Sherlock did not share this belief. The more he thought of it, the more he caught glimpses of the news, the more evident it became something was amiss. Something the press and the police and everyone else was missing. If only he could see it for himself, then perhaps he would notice what all the others ignored. It was like a puzzle he itched to put together, but first, he needed all the pieces.
John thought about the question for a while before answering. For some reason he didn't want her to cling too much onto the troublemaker part. Already protective over his property.
He hissed in pain when the guard thwacked the side of his head. “You’re complete waste of money and you’ve been given far too many chances already.”
He dragged his fingers through his damp hair –they'd pushed him under a cold shower after he'd accidentally kicked Ryan in the chin. Then they'd tried again.
"You know exactly what I'm talking about," Sherlock countered, giving a meaningful glance at the pink mobile in the cabbie's left hand.
"My purpose is to serve," Sherlock spat out the words. His fists were shaking now, it was no use. If he hadn't been a slave for so long, he would have marched out of the room and slammed the door behind him, but years of feigning submission and the knowledge of consequences kept him kneeling on the floor.
There were no good memories from The Oyster House. Near naked, crouching on all fours on a table surrounded by laughing, giggling women. Spanked for each bad quality of the groom for marital happiness, milked for long lasting sex life and many kids to come. But it wasn't the worst thing he'd done or that had been done to him at The Oyster House.
Holmes had been subjected to it thrice. John had noticed the scars on the very day he got Holmes, but he hadn't really looked at them before, hadn't really thought of what they meant. Holmes was not, and had never been, a good slave. He had earned his scars.
Billy gave the door a wary look but nodded. John waited until he heard the door to Mrs Hudson's flat close. Someone kicked the door again.
"But that's enough chatter." The cabbie straightened on his seat. His tone was more commanding than it had been at any point so far. Voice of a free man talking to a slave. "Choose."
"Please don't do this, mistress" Sherlock pleaded, looking up at her. The first tears rolled down on his cheeks and he reached out to touch her. She slapped his hand away angrily.
Lestrade rolled his eyes. "Fine, go if you have to... But I'm pulling you in for a statement tomorrow. Or by Monday the latest. And I'll need that suitcase."
Sherlock didn't bother to pay any attention to it. He had had worse than a little smugness thrown at him. "Coffee or tea?" he wanted to know instead.
"He didn't do anything illegal, if that's what you're asking," Sherlock replied. He wasn't fooling even Lestrade with his attempts to hide his soreness. But he wouldn't have any lasting injuries, so there was nothing to be done about it but to accept it. Lestrade couldn't help him, nor would he want to help him. He may have treated him almost like a human being, but the social gap between them was still enormous. Lestrade would never see anything wrong with John or anyone else hurting him so long as it was within the legal boundaries, nor would he hesitate to hurt Sherlock himself.
John shook his head slowly in amazement. "Unbelievable. You got all that from a phone? You're amazing, you know that?"
"Oh…" He remembered Holmes's explanation about the e-mails. Perhaps this slave had nothing to do with the earlier meeting after all.
"And you're not allowed to go out just for a fag. If you must, then do it while you're running errands."
"Did I tell you to get dressed?" he snapped when the slave reached for his shirt. Holmes looked at him, hesitating briefly before withdrawing his hand.
As always, thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed. Please take a moment to let me know your thoughts if you've got a moment to spare. That would be really nice.
"He believes he has to behave," Holmes muttered as he started to scrub the permanent coffee stains on the mug.
"Baker Street?" John repeated in disbelief before laughing. "That's right in the middle of London! How on earth do you imagine I could afford Baker Street when I barely afford this?"
John must have seen. He wasn't a complete idiot, he'd know something had gone wrong. Eventually. The question was...how long would it take for John to realise that this time he hadn't just wandered off on his own? And what would he do about it? Would he even care? He really couldn't trust for John to do anything and had he not been drugged he wouldn't have cared. But now... Like the cabbie had said, he
It was a cold night in early March when Sherlock carried out his escape. In the dead of night, he opened the front door and stepped outside alone for the first time since being brought to this horrible place. He darted to the street and ran. It didn't matter where as long it wasn't here. He ran the unfamiliar streets as fast as he could, as far as he could manage.
He was caught of course. He didn't even make it over the garden fence and his unsuccessful escape attempt was reported to their mistress. Lydia Marlowe didn't seem surprised, but that did not mean she did not have him punished.
She'd shook her head and fondled his curls. "Sorry, Ravenhair. You're entertaining and I've had fun with you. But you're also really difficult at times and you don't get along with the kids. I'm bored of you."
Dirty clothes and dirty dishes. This was his life. These were the things he was supposed to care about.
Since he had been bought, Sherlock had been his mistress's investment. Even so, he did sometimes help at the building sites. His master built roofs and installed insulation for living. Had his own small business with a few paid workers and a team of slaves. Sherlock wasn't exactly familiar with them, but he'd known them well enough to know them by names.
"Floor," Lydia ordered immediately, but for the first time in years, Sherlock ignored the command. He looked straight into his mistress's eyes. "Mistress, is this true? Are you selling me?"
"Onto the floor!" he shouted, getting violently up from his seat. The dramatic effect was considerably lessened by his right leg buckling under him, but Holmes seemed to finally realise John was being serious and kowtowed hurriedly.
"This is fucking ridiculous", he whispered irritably. "You're a house slave, you're supposed to be cooking my dinner."
But the slave was already in the car, the bag of take-aways by his feet on the floor and John had no other option, but to limp after him.
The slaves official papers only mentioned his ID-number, which John couldn’t recall, not that it was a proper name anyway. Though naturally, a master could call their slave whatever they wished, but most people gave slaves actual names that stuck with them even if they changed owners. Some named them like pets and apparently many named their bed slaves by actors or characters they fancied. Some even gave names that were insults and not for children’s ears. John had no interest in making up names if the slave already had a name he preferred.
"Sex with your owner is a privilege and in fact quite pleasant," Mycroft all but lectured calmly. "Speaking of which,
Deep in his thoughts, hand in his pocket touching the card yet again, he didn't notice the black car until it drove past him and pulled to the kerb. It wasn't the same car as yesterday, but it might as well have been. Like the previous one, the windows were tinted and if one was powerful enough to control the CCTV, they might as well have two or more black vehicles.
John watched her go and disappear inside. Having no other choice, he started walking towards the road she had pointed him and tried to brush of the things she'd just said. Holmes was difficult, not dangerous.
"I'm not implying anything", Holmes assured innocently, walking past him and up the stairs to the front door. "Surely she just was in the area and offered to substitute."
But Mycroft knew it was all in vain. He didn't care for himself much at this point, but if he could just spare Sherlock from the life of slavery... He himself hardly deserved anything better. He'd never seen anything wrong with slavery. All his life he'd looked down on slaves, thought of them as lesser beings. It had never crossed his mind it could happen to him. He didn't feel guilty for how he'd treated them or for how he'd seen them. This changed nothing. Slavery was still needed and slaves
"We're looking for a sniper," Sherlock smirked. For a new pair of gloves he could show off a little.
"I don't think so", he grunted, but took the card. There was only a single letter M printed on the white, glossy surface with a phone number under it.
Pretending to stumble against the cab Sherlock took Lestrade's phone and dialled the number from memory. The phone in the car started ringing and it took only a few moments for the cabbie to take the call.
Holmes looked at him like he only now had remembered who he was talking to and dropped down on his knees.
desperate. It had been so long since anyone had treated him truly as their equal. As a human being. Even if it were a from the mouth of a serial killer, he'd take it.
"I– Forgive me, mistress. I wasn't expecting this," he apologised with a hasty bow, violin still in his hand.
John turned. It took him a few seconds, but he located it. It was like an eye staring right at him. He nodded.
"I can't relax! This room is driving me mad, I can feel my braincells die, one by one! I need to get out!" he'd groaned.
"You didn't get criminal record, though", the slave observed. "They wouldn't have given me to a person with history of violence against slaves."
Ella scribbled down something again and he tried to peer what it said, but she noticed and tilted the clipboard so that he couldn't see. He'd managed to make out the word "friend".
"You talk big," Sherlock mumbled. "Anything at all" was hardly going to frighten him. It wasn't much of a threat to a slave. "Quite a risk. People saw us. My m– colleague at the restaurant saw."
"He's a taxi driver," John marvelled, turning back to the table. It sounded possible, it made sense. No one would think it strange if they saw someone step in a taxi. No one thought it dangerous to step in a taxi. And out of all the people only this slave in front of him had been able to see the obvious. "That's amazing."
He cried out when the cane hit his back, but did not oppose the disciplinary action. He knew he had earned it.
"Two-two-one Baker Street," he mumbled, having made sure his coat sleeves properly covered his wrists.
"Fine", John sighed and held the laptop at him. Holmes took it, signed in effortlessly and continued whatever it was he'd been doing without getting up from the floor. Or thanking him. John shrugged it off and made himself a cup of tea while Holmes typed at furious speed. Perhaps he should make Holmes type for him from now on. He was clearly much faster at it than his master was.
This time he exhaled deeply to let the man know he was listening, but did not open his eyes or even move otherwise. John's voice had been hesitant the first time. It did rouse his interest, but he kept lounging on the sofa, betraying none of it.
Even so there was no denying that had Greg himself been Sherlock's owner, he would've already had the slave beaten. John's dignity and ability to see the bigger picture for letting Sherlock go see the body after speaking like that was admirable.
The truth was, he almost wished Holmes weren't his slave. The few conversations they had had momentarily made him forget about how useless he felt. Having a slave to take care of all the tasks made him feel even more so, but talking with Holmes had been almost like talking with a friend. It was pathetic, he knew it was. Only old and lonely people kept slaves purely for company, but John could have done just that with Holmes.
Sherlock nodded despite understanding how empty such promises were. He thought Mycroft was about to say something more or maybe he himself ought have said something instead, but neither of them ever had the chance to do so. The door was opened again and when Mycroft failed to obey the first order to take his bag and join the crowd in the corridor, he received a painful blow from the floor guard's baton to his shoulder. And that was the last Sherlock saw of him. He was dragged out mercilessly and the door was locked again. Suddenly all the noises from the corridor seemed to dissolve into the loud sound of blood rushing in his ears.
"I did", Holmes calmly agreed. He shouldn't have been calm. He'd just been caught, he should have been quivering on the floor and apologising.
"Shh..." he hushed gently, pulling his arms around Sherlock, who first tensed at the touch, but soon relaxed and pressed his cheek against Mycroft's chest.
Holmes took the case from John and sat down on the floor with it. He unzipped it and began quickly going through the luggage. John was, once again, momentarily at loss of words with his slave's behaviour. The man growled in irritation, jumped up and paced the room for several seconds before throwing himself on to the bed.
"Yes you are," the woman corrected him. "I understand it's very confusing at first, but I'll help you with that. Tell me, did your parents have any slaves?"
"I still have a few minutes," Mycroft countered and carefully sat at the opposite chair. "I'm not here to fight with you. I just came to see how you're doing."
"I know people," Holmes offered a vague explanation. "What does it matter, we are solving a murder! More people than Jennifer Wilson and the others will die unless we catch the killer."
Holmes served the dinner in silence and did not attempt to make any conversation while he waited on the floor for his master to eat. He washed the dishes in equal silence, careful to even not make much noise with the kitchenware as John started writing the promised update for his blog. He found Holmes scrubbing the bathtub an hour later after he was done. It was a short update, and he had deleted and rewritten it before being satisfied with it. Hopefully Ella would appreciate the effort.
"Of course I didn't." There was a hint of mockery in his voice. "You would have noticed when you came in. I used the window", he explained, nodding towards it. It was indeed unlocked. John hadn't even noticed.
us," Ryan parroted. "That's what we agreed. It's my wife's birthday. What did you expect? The fuck is
"It doesn't matter" he said, stood up and walked to the wall opposite that had become his bedroom. "I'm just a slave, after all."
"No," Holmes denied the accusation, but John continued as though he hadn't spoken at all: "How could I buy something, if I didn't know we're out of it?
John wanted to ask more, but said nothing. Holmes probably couldn't tell much, seeing he was duty bound to stay silent about his previous owners. But someone had certainly invested a lot in him. Someone had liked him enough to actually give him property.
John's temporary job came to an end, and he marked the occasion with a nice hot bath. It was good to have a proper sized bathroom. Harry might laugh, but few things were better than a dim lit bathroom and a warm bath. Even better when the dim light was provided by tea lights on a dinner plate (on the toilet lid, but best ignore that) and soft melodies drifted beyond the ajar door to his bedroom. After moving to Baker Street, Holmes had finally given a sample of his violin skills. It had been by John's request, though he thought it odd Holmes hadn't asked himself. Having now heard him play, John assured him he could play any time unless told otherwise. Holmes was pleased by his praise and confessed he'd been unsure whether his master would like the playing, and so had only played in John's absence. Since then John had caught him fiddling it deep in thought. The noises he produced with the instrument weren't exactly music, but they weren't unpleasant.
"Who said you could go out and have a walk?" John questioned as the slave stepped in and closed the door.
"Sherlock Holmes I imagined might have stood a chance. But now that I know what you really are... I think I'll just go find myself the real fifth victim after I'm done with you."
"Yes, of course we are," the slave said, again looking down at him with his unnecessarily large collar. The front curved out a little under his chin and looked like it curved more under his shirt to sit on his chest. It narrowed towards the back where the locking mechanism was, but the front was heavy and wide enough to keep it from turning around. "Didn't he mention?"
Ella's eyes narrowed disapprovingly at "troublemaker", but she only wrote something down instead of saying anything on the subject, before boring her gaze at him again. "How do you feel about it? Becoming a slave owner."
The car was still moving when Sherlock came to. It took a moment for his groggy mind to piece together all the evidence around him and the memories from the past few hours. For a terrifying second he had thought he was back at The Oyster House.
John frowned at Holmes, who was still lounging on the bed, eyes closed and fingertips pressed to his chin. He was surprised –no, he was
"So are you," the cabbie countered. His tongue brushed against his upper teeth as he kept watching Sherlock for a reaction.
"We want our money back," the other man said, but John merely lifted a finger, indicating them to stay silent until Sherlock was gone.
Holmes had been completely impossible ever since getting up. He had performed all his daily morning tasks, but as if each of them had personally offended him. He'd paced the small flat frustratedly, groaned in irritation when John had ordered the man to sit down and eat his damn breakfast. Holmes had obeyed, but soon started drumming the table with his fingers. He'd told him to stop which had led in Holmes ranting how being closed within four walls was slowly killing him mentally and how John as free man couldn't possibly understand what it was like for him, being a slave and having a brain in which the thoughts raced liked F1 cars, having a mind like an engine that would explode if not used properly. At this point John had ordered him to shut up unless he wanted John to discipline him again. It was disturbing how eager Holmes had looked for a second.
She was lying almost certainly. She seemed uncomfortable with whatever it was she wasn't saying. He frowned at her but didn't ask. If she lied, it was because mistress had told her to –and he would not question his mistress.
, John thought with horror and disgust. His father, when he was drinking, had been like that. He himself had thought it funny to torment that poor slave back in university. Up until it had gone too far. He wished someone would've been there to hit him on the head, too.
Sherlock pulled down the shirt to cover the red marks on his back where the sharp pain was already turning into a dull ache. It was his pride rather than his back that suffered the worst. John didn't seem to expect him to thank him for the punishment, so Sherlock saw no reason to open his mouth or even bow.
my real name," Holmes countered. He turned his hand to show the stigma on his wrist. "If anything is my real name, then this is it. The person I was before this is
Mycroft didn't reply, and Sherlock kept looking at the ceiling. At least Mycroft wore a smaller collar now. It hurt to see him with the heavy, polished metal around his neck. It stung, because Sherlock knew it was because of him.
"It's a property crime," Sherlock countered, though he hated to admit the fact that should the man succeed in killing him, it would not be a murder. It wouldn't even be a manslaughter. If he died, he would become a pitiful piece of destroyed property.
"It's not your fault, Holmes," she said softly. "We wouldn't sell you if there was another way, but there isn't. You know we've been needing money after Henry's business–. After the–."
"You've already drugged me," Sherlock argued. "If you wanted me dead you could have done it already. Why would I choose either?"
John straightened his back and gripped the cane, again ready use it as a weapon should need arise. As the door opened, he realised none of the cameras in the area were pointed at them.
John smacked the back of his head, mostly just because something like that was expected of him, but it was still harder than he had meant it to be. He was relieved his slave was alive and well, truly he was, but underneath he was still incredibly angry for Holmes's earlier behaviour.
"Oh, you don't have to, I can eat from the–" John cut off his sentence in the middle. The slave looked at him over his shoulder, through the window in the wall between the kitchenette and the living space, already reaching for the cupboard.
They were left with a slave who showed them how to properly bow, stand, kneel and kowtow. Only Sherlock had to try them, while Mycroft with the cast on his leg got to watch. The slave spoke about rules, but Sherlock only pretended to listen. They had to repeat a version of the slave oath. He'd heard their own slaves recite it on few occasions. Then he was led away, while the slave would talk some more with Mycroft. He was sent to a shower, a long corridor he had to walk through as wall-mounted shower heads poured cool water and soap on him.
, Mycroft had said. Even though he'd known it would never be true, he had believed it. He had waited for his brother to come and save him, to magically fix everything. But days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months and months turned to years. He had all but given up on believing he would ever see his brother again when after three years, on a hot summer day, Hannah interrupted his daily violin practise.
"Shut it, both of you", Lestrade barked. "Doctor Watson", he continued with more calm, "I would really greatly appreciate your slave's opinion of the scene."
"Alright, I will", John promised, though he had no idea what he would do. He hadn't yet physically disciplined Holmes, not properly, and he hadn't bought any kind of tools for such purpose, although perhaps he ought to buy a rattan cane. Maybe even a shocker. He didn't approve collar shockers, those things were inhumane, but a wristband or an anklet would probably come in hand if Holmes truly was anything like his official papers described him to be. Stupid, stupid to be lulled into believing Holmes's good behaviour would last. He should have realised the slave was toying with him. He wanted to know what his slave had been hoping to achieve by logging onto his laptop, but almost dreaded to ask.
Mycroft sat down and waited, both hoping and dreading for Sherlock to be brought back as well, but it soon became evident that his brother had been sold. He lay on the bed, realisation hitting hard that he might never see Sherlock again. He could only hope his brother's buyers were good people, and that Sherlock had listened to his advice. But at least he had been bought. He supposed, in his position, it was the best possible birthday present he could expect.
Street away from home and there it was again. The sound of a ringing phone. It didn't stop even though he walked past it.
The slave bit his lip, but stepped off his shoes, let the trousers and his pants drop on the floor and kicked them away before ripping off his socks.
Mycroft stepped closer, and Sherlock didn't pull away when his brother brushed away an errant curl from his face. He wouldn't have admitted it in a thousand years, but it was reassuring to feel his brother's touch.
"Mrs Hudson, how are you?" he practically beamed to the phone and after a second confirmed: "Yes, it's me."
he had been made to have sex at some point. He had been shaved clean just a few weeks ago, he’d clearly been someone’s bed slave. None of that should matter as far as the slave was healthy, and he was, they all went through extensive health checks before being sold.
She ruffled his hair again. "Well done! Now wipe those tears and follow me. My name is Lydia Marlowe, my husband is called Henry. Our house slave over here is called Hunny. She'll help you adjust to your new life. Don't worry, Holmes. You're in good hands. We'll take care of you now. You'll have a purpose here."
He swallowed again and attempted to catch his breath before hastily putting the belt away. The slave's back and buttocks were covered in red welts and bruising was forming, but he had not drawn blood. Holmes drew two deep, shaky breaths before brushing away tears angrily.
He had read the letter through several times, just to be sure he understood it right. And thus Captain John Hamish Watson, as the letter addressed him, now nervously stood at one of the front doors of the Greater London Institute of Slavery, an enormous building complex with offices, reception areas, waiting rooms and most importantly the holding centres where unowned slaves owned by the monopoly of the Institute were kept, trained, bred and grown. InS was responsible for the popular monthly slave auction within its compounds, and it held the title of the largest slave market in Europe. John leant to his cane, holding the letter in his free hand, attempting to figure exactly where he was supposed to go.
"No one takes my property and gets away with it," John replied. His mouth was a firm line for a second until he continued: "I got here before the police did. I was about to search the other building when I heard the shot and... I thought I was too late."
Jeff Hope realised something had changed. He looked down just as the gunshot echoed through the room, loud and ringing in Sherlock's ears. Jeff Hope fell on his back, and Sherlock knelt down, frozen to the spot.
But none of that would happen ever again. Sandy and the others were sold elsewhere. Mycroft had been sold. Mummy and Daddy were dead. Even Redbeard was gone.
. But John never voiced the thought. It would’ve only been a cruel reminder. Sad as it may have been, Holmes was now a slave. His slave. If a child had nowhere to go, it was only right to give such child a meaningful life. As a slave, such child would be taken care of, and would have a purpose in life.
And he never, ever wanted to see a slave die again because of the power free human beings had over their lives. And absolutely not by his hand.
"Well, I only got him yesterday", he shrugged. "His papers say he's a troublemaker, but so far he's been well-behaved."
"I've had masters who have let me go out when I have no duties to perform", the man argued. "I couldn't have known
Lydia sighed. She walked to the sofa and picked a woollen blanket that lay over the backrest. She returned to his side, crouched down and wrapped it around his naked body, letting her arms stay around him.
He couldn't have returned even if he had wanted to. He couldn't remember where he'd come from. It didn't matter. He would never go back.
"I'm so sorry for his behaviour," Lydia hurried to add. "This isn't like him at all. We didn't tell him we were looking for a suitable new owner for him. We knew it'd be a long process. We set up the first advert in late October."
"You don't need to stand there" John told him. "I don't have anything for you to do right now. You can take nap on the bed if you want to."
children even have nightmares about? Sherlock's nightmares were made of the accident that led into his enslavement, of his four failed escape attempts that went into records (and he would never admit the third one was an escape), the slave club in which he had been illegally kept for three years, the violence under his seventh legal owner, being sold to Florida...
"So are you", she replied. Her eyes moved from his face to the loose metal collar around his neck and the distinctive clothing he wore. Sherlock bowed his stubbled head and cast his eyes down.
"I don't know." Holmes got up and gathered the dishes as he spoke: "Probably he let someone think he's not a slave. I'm not the only one who does that."
to have his reasoning betray him, yet he could not deny the rationality of it. He knew his situation, in and out. He knew what he was and he knew there was no way out of it. Not for him. He just refused to believe it.
, Mycroft had to remind himself. Thinking anything else would have been hypocritical of him.) and waiting, even hoping, for someone to buy them.
He shivered from cold when they locked him alone in an empty room, but to his relief Mycroft was brought in soon after. The holding cell was small, had nothing but bare, white walls, a sink, a toilet and a bunk bed on each side of the walls. There were no windows and the only light came from a dim lamp above them. Mycroft supposed they were lucky to get to share the the room with no one else in it. And at least they were allowed to stay together.
"I called a few places I thought might need a violinist," he told. "Two places actually remembered you. No one needs a violinist right now, but they might give me a call in the future. That's alright with you, right?"
Sherlock stopped struggling instantly. Sandy let go and he ran to hug his friend. "I'm sorry," he sobbed quietly into the dog's ear. "It's all my fault."
It was crazy, really. Absolutely mad, and he couldn't yet quite believe he'd spent a night chasing a murderer. And despite nearly losing his slave he had loved it.
There was also a list of the personal possessions the slave 99OR-79/3J3A was allowed to keep. Or rather, all the items and accessories that came with the slave. Most of them were very much standard: several clothing items, shoes, the duffle bag he'd already seen, shaving equipment, comb and a toothbrush. But most notably it listed two items that were legally his property and which John would have absolutely no right to take from the slave or destroy them: an antique violin of uncounted value with a case and a Belstaff tweed coat worth over a thousand pounds. He turned to gape at the slave on the bed: "Your coat is worth over thousand pounds?"
What an idiot he had been! He had known he'd be flogged anyway if caught, but he might as well kiss goodbye to half the meals for a week or more. He would be sent to clean toilets and waste containers. There were rumours of slaves accidentally being killed when beaten for disrespecting the people in administrative positions.
"Tomorrow. She's agreed to meet you. I'm certain she can offer you bigger rooms for the same price. You only need to find a job."
His brother's fingers gripped the umbrella tighter and he shook his head slightly, but refused to argue any further with him.
give your owners a reason to discipline you. You need to promise me, Sherlock. Promise me you'll behave."
"We'll never go home again," Mycroft replied. "But I promise you, Sherlock," he said, his voice hoarse and cracking at his name, "I will get you out of this. I
But despite the bleeding, bruising and swelling, no life-threatening or permanent harm had come to Sherlock. After he'd been patched up at a hospital they had had no other choice but to return him to his legal owner. Greg would forever remember the call he received a few weeks later, three o'clock in the morning. Sherlock's panicky voice in his ear, begging for him to come and help.
Sherlock cleared his throat annoyedly. "I wasn't owned by the Yard, I was evidence. Anyway, what do we have?" he prompted tetchily.
Sherlock did, starting from how he'd texted to Jennifer Wilson's mobile and finished to the unexpected shooter. Of the words exchanged with Jeff Hope, he only told the facts relevant to the case.
The man rustled his papers, clearly trying to let them know the conversation was over. "If your future owner chooses to free you after you've turned eighteen, you can contact the Institute and apply to become your brother's guardian. But even that would require you to first purchase him. Until then there's nothing to be done."
You can't promise that, Sherlock wanted to say. He didn't want John to promise that. It was...kind. He did not want to think of his owner as kind. It was not kind to own a person's life. It would have been easier if John had been cruel, for kindness was worse than cruelty. It gave him a glimpse of freedom, a little taste of what it would be like to live as a free man and have a friend, but it would always be just beyond his reach, yet close enough to tempt and torment him.
"What do you think, Dr Watson?" Mrs Hudson asked. Billy had followed them and stood now behind her, curiously eying at the visitors.
A part of him still wished he had never accepted the buoys that saved his life like some had done. Perhaps it would have been a kinder fate for him as well to drown after hypothermia took over. It certainly would have been for her.
The floodlights blinded him and when he'd turned to look away, he'd seen the someone swim away alone to the open sea while the others tried to cling onto the boat. Lifebuoys had been thrown to them, and one by one each slave who accepted the buoys had been pulled to safety. Back to captivity.
Holmes flinched at his sudden outburst, emphasised with a violent tap at the floor with the cane. He hastily placed the milk carton he'd been about to open on the table and dropped on his knees, face towards the floor.
Since Mycroft's visit he had attempted to clean his act a little. Mycroft was right, of course. He always was. And wasn't that hateful?
"Anyway, the slave," John went on. "She was old for a slave and had to be put down. We never got a new one. My mum said it was either a car or a new slave."
He pointed the umbrella at John. "And you of course, master Watson, should you want to be involved. He is your property, after all. All I am asking is that you let me meet him."
It took Sherlock a while, but eventually, he managed to tinker the door and the lock of his cupboard so that he could open it from the inside. He packed all the clothes he had brought with him from home and stuffed some bread and a package of shortbread in the mix. He had to abandon the violin. Lydia Marlowe had taken it from him, claiming such instrument was too good for him. She had locked it away in the master bedroom, so it would have been too risky to attempt to recover it. Sherlock hated the woman for that. The people at InS had
"Mike Stamford, we were at Bart's together", the stranger said and suddenly the pieces fell into place in John's head. Of course. He extended his hand.
"Would you allow that? She's a slave," Sherlock reminded him dubiously. People generally didn't let strange slaves in their houses just like that.
"What about before that?" John wanted to know. Based on some of the stories he'd heard, he was impressed that a slave like Holmes had survived on the other side of the Atlantic.
"You don't need one, you just want one", Lestrade sighed. "I'll see what I can do. But I'm not promising anything. Don't pick up a fight with Anderson. Are you coming?"
John hummed again. "Why won't you just invite her here? If she's willing to walk, she might as well walk here."
"If you have so much energy you can use it to clean the oven!" John had yelled back at him before leaving the flat entirely, but not before reminding Holmes that there'd be severe consequences if he attempted to leave the flat without his consent. It remained a mystery why Holmes hadn't simply asked to be let out. John had thought they had reached some kind of an understanding over the matter after he'd caught him, but evidently not.
"I called in advance," Holmes explained when John asked about it. "I need a clear view to the street. Don't worry, it didn't cost me anything. The man who keeps this place likes me."
The first man he recognised. Ryan Brisson. He'd rented Holmes to him and his wife the previous afternoon for the wife's 50th birthday party. They were supposed to return Holmes in the morning –rested, fed, and showered. Holmes seemed far from it. Apart from the shower part, perhaps. His clothes and hair were damp, but the light drizzle outside wasn't enough to have drenched him. Even so, his nose was coated with dried blood. His eye was swollen and dark.
For a moment, John was at loss of words. What did she know about his slave? How did Holmes know these people? He tucked the questions away for later and corrected her: "No. InS gave him."
"I expect you to do better next time, though", he managed between giggles once the laughter started to settle. Holmes sobered immediately.
Both of them turned to look at the caller. It was Lestrade at the front door. She called back that she'd be there in a second, but before leaving she turned to look at John for one last time. "Get rid of that slave while you still can."
It could have meant he should ready himself for that. Considering he'd been John's property for almost two months now, it was about time. During the weeks John had owned him, he hadn't so much as touched Sherlock in any even remotely sexual way. No groping or slapping his arse. The only times John touched him were to discipline him, and those times Sherlock knew what to expect. Having lived his life with people so often randomly touching him it felt almost unnerving that John hadn't done anything of the sort. Unconsciously he was near constantly prepared for unwanted touches, and when none came the nervous energy just built up within him.
"Morning, John," he called, switching on the kitchen lights after the alarm clock went off. John seemed surprised to see him up already, but retreated to the bathroom while his slave prepared the breakfast.
John listened in silence, dreading a little what they'd find. And while he didn't want to admit it, he was a bit excited and curious. He thought of the kids (actual children?) who'd come to this clearly abandoned house and ended up finding a body. Lestrade led them into an empty second floor room. Well, empty apart from a rocking horse in the corner and a woman dressed in a bright pink overcoat lying unmoving on the floor. John stayed by the wall with the Detective Inspector, but Holmes was immediately all business and alert. He took a step forward, arm extended to the room and stopped. For long seconds none of them moved or said a thing until Holmes beelined to the corpse and started slowly circling it.
"Not at you, you idiot!" John snapped. "I'm angry at myself for letting this happen. I'm furious that this happened to you."
Although he was curious, there really was nothing John could do to make Holmes reveal the name he was born with, if he wanted to keep it a secret. Not even InS should have records of it. The moment a free person was enslaved for life they ceased to exist. There would be no official connection between the person they were and the slave they would become. It was easier for the families as well. Officially the person enslaved was dead, or in some cases, they had never existed at all. Holmes had been young, so there was a possibility he had never existed as a free person. Or he had perished among with his parents.
The only thing Sherlock had was his father's violin. But that he would not give up. Not even for her. It was the only thing he legally owned. It was the only thing he had left of his life before slavery.
"Oh." Sherlock's eyes averted. "And you didn't take it?" he asked, even though it sounded unbelievable for someone to offer to buy him like that. Who, out of the people who could, would want him?
"I'll see if I'm in any shape for a statement tomorrow," Sherlock sighed. "John– My master," he corrected, "was somewhat unhappy with me earlier. I've earned myself quite a beating."
"Because you are worth more than she is," Lydia stated, pulling his head closer. She kissed his hair. "You're an expensive slave, Holmes. Take pride in that."
"Sherlock Holmes..." he spoke, smugly shaking his head a little. "I've heard so much about you. And look at you now, all at my mercy."
"Is this a joke?" he gaped, gesturing at the table with his free hand. Because if it was, it wasn't very funny and John was not on a humorous mood. "Is this your idea of dinner? Cereals..? FUCKING CEREALS?"
"You were still sleeping and your phone is on silent", Holmes told. His eyes were cast down and he stood by the table with his hands folded above his crotch, for once actually looking like a slave.
"Just one more unfinished business then," Lestrade stated after he was done. "We still haven't found that suitcase you kept talking about."
"You never– You didn't tell me I'm supposed to do that," the slave tried to defend himself without sounding like he was arguing. "You buy the food, so I–"
John nodded his acknowledgment and tapped Holmes's arm with the cane. The man stood up instantly, dusting his coat utterly unprepared for his master slapping his face. John grabbed the lapel of his coat and pulled him closer.
see it. It had already been two days, so if he didn't see it soon the evidence could be gone forever.
They didn't need to say anything. There was nothing to be said or done to change their fates. Mycroft had no reassuring words to offer that wouldn't have been lies. He didn't say it would be alright because nothing was alright. Neither of them needed comforting, fabricated tales or promises when the truth was so painfully obvious.
John Watson wasn't any different from his previous masters. Feign submission, act eager to please, beg a little. Really, it was easy. To John's credit, he
Despite the work wasn't the same each day, the days still blended into an endless loop of hard, physical work and too little time to rest. There was nothing here but work and sleep. Each day had him waiting nothing but the sweet unconsciousness and the few hours of break that would always end too soon. But there was no tomorrow here. No next week, no next month, no next year. The future didn't exist, for if he thought of the days he still had ahead of him, he would not get through today.
John didn't approve, but it would've felt wrong to take them away from him, considering what John had made him go through. "Fine, you can keep them. Just don't smoke them in the house."
"I'm not stupid, Mr Holmes. You're not getting off this car alone. Don't worry, you've only been out for about ten minutes."
EDIT: I once said to someone in the comments, but I probably should say it here, too: "Things will get worse before they get better, and then they'll get worse again before getting better." Things have now gone worse. They've only known each other for a few weeks by the end of this chapter. Slow build.
How he'd done it or why it had taken his brother so long, Sherlock didn't know. But Mycroft had his informants, and sometimes information travelled slow mouth to mouth. Besides, it was hard to find something you weren't looking for. Mycroft hadn't been looking for him, he was sure.
"Don't worry, Holmes," she said, stroking his jawline with her thumb. "I'll take good care f you. You have nothing to fear."
John licked his upper lip. He wondered if they did any background checks on new slave owners. ”That obvious?”
And all that time the mother kept screaming hysterically for her unnamed son. Had still been crying and chanting the same words over and over again when she'd been dragged away by laughing fishermen.
", she stressed, "you're not a wealthy man. I am talking of the kind of sums you could live in relative comfort with for the rest of your life."
“What?” John blurted. Behind him the slave stepped out and the alarm silenced. Of course, he'd forgotten that most buses didn’t take slaves. In his defense, it wasn’t something he had ever needed to think about before. And he hadn’t been in London for a long time. Too bad the slave had an ID chip, otherwise they might have got away with this as long as the slave had kept his left wrist hidden.
"He's... I don't know. Different? His papers say he's been a slave since he was ten, but he's not like other slaves. It's...refreshing. Interesting."
"And here you are... Risking your life, just to kill strangers," he thought out loud. Jeff Hope's eyes averted and more pieces came together. The picture was almost complete. Only few missing pieces remained. But he'd get there.
"How would I know what's missing if it's missing?" John wanted to know, his patience wearing thinner and thinner by minute.
“Bored..!” he groaned out loud when he heard approaching footsteps from the corridor. Maybe they would hear and even bang the door while they passed by. “BORED!”
be free again. It didn't even seem so important anymore. He learnt Hunny's name, her real name, the name free people never spoke. Her true name was Hannah. It was common among slaves, and it saddened Sherlock to realise he had never know Sandy's real name. Sherlock had loved his mother, but Sandy had been the one who always took care of him.
At the same time he dreaded the idea of Holmes in the same room. He knew well enough by now that he probably said things in his sleep, whimpered and cried, maybe even shouted or screamed. It wasn't something he'd like anyone to witness.
Again, thank you so so much for the many encouraging comments and your general interest towards my fic. I hope you'll enjoy this chapter as well! Tell me what you think.
in the situation made sense until he saw the cabbie's body over Lestrade's shoulder. He went boneless from relief. Yes, that was it. He was in London, he had just narrowly escaped death and John clearly had not abandoned him if he had found a way to contact Lestrade.
"I'm sorry, John. I'll remember that next time," Holmes promised calmly. "Anything else I can do for you, master?"
"I didn't lie, I just didn't point out I am a slave," Holmes replied as if it should've been clear. "And if they assumed I'm not...well, it's not really my problem, is it?"
"Get out, Mycroft," Sherlock barked, jumping to his feet. This wasn't a conversation he wanted to have. "My master doesn't want you here."
"Yes, that's me", John blinked in surprise. He'd been half expecting to see the same woman or some shady, sinister figure, not a civilised looking man. He was about to offer his hand for shaking when he noticed the large slave collar the man was wearing and quickly pulled his hand back. The slave smartly paid no attention to this, as though John hadn't just been about to make a huge, embarrassing mistake.
an escape attempt. You don't need to buy me a collar, I'm not going to escape", Holmes said irritably. "I shouldn't have left the flat, yes, but I came back. Isn't that enough of a proof?"
Three days later from that, he was finally able to approach her for the second time. Head bowed and eyes cast down he thanked her for saving him from the keepers wrath. She was happy to see him, and invited him to walk with her, but Sherlock had to decline. He wanted nothing more than to take an advantage of her charitable offer, but he couldn't. He had duties to perform, and even if he had her invitation, he still would have to get his load of work done by the end of his shift.
"I know a good restaurant there. Hopefully the murderer shows up. Come on, John," he called excitedly. "Might be dangerous!"
Sherlock didn't sleep. As soon as he heard the doctor's breathing pattern turn into that of sleep, he straightened his legs and turned to lie on his back. He didn't even entertain the possibility of sneaking out tonight when he didn't yet know how heavy or light sleeper his new owner was. He wasn't feeling especially energetic, but neither did he feel tired. He had napped on the bed quite a while and if there was anything to do at the holding centre, it was sleeping.
a doctor", John had snapped a little harsher than had probably been wise in his situation. "Brain matter on the walls is not a problem." It really, really wasn't. He didn't like it, who in their right mind would, but he knew he could handle it without freaking out or mulling over it later.
"I knew you'd figure out something was wrong," the slave smirked. He hesitated for a moment. "Thank you."
Sherlock felt like sighing in annoyance. The soldier who was to become his new owner sounded puzzled: “Why do you say that?”
More shocked gasps followed. Lestrade was openly staring at him, wide-eyed, gulping when Holmes still refused to comply. Sergeant Donovan next to him had paled and covered her mouth with her hand. Anderson's face was a mixture of loath and outrage.
"Maybe I should save for a car, then…" John muttered. Even if he didn't have a car, it might be a good idea to pay for Holmes's licence renewal at some point. He kept reading. The file was divided in several sections. The first part contained the general information concerning the slave: ID-number (tattooed on the left wrist in numbers and letters, but also in bar code form, which was quite rare these days), sex, height, eye and hair colour, slavery status (C, which stood for "enslaved as a child", rather than B meaning "enslaved as an adult" or A "born as a slave"), number of previous owners (nine?!)…
Sherlock swallowed involuntarily, hoping immediately that Mycroft hadn't noticed. If he looked carefully, he could see his own distorted reflection on the polished metal collar around Mycroft's neck. "Someone did."
"I begged on the floor for Anthea to buy you." Mycroft's voice was venomous with controlled rage. "Why didn't you let me know you were back?"
While Sherlock had never even seen the man, he knew the company –and he himself were owned by a man named Hudson. His eyes widened in horror with the realisation and he dropped on his knees instantly.
Six weeks went by, and talking to her confirmed everything he already knew. Mrs Hudson was stuck in an unhappy marriage with an abusive, unfaithful man. Mr Hudson was unpredictable and often violent. At this point he didn't even bother trying to hide his younger lovers from her. Or the true nature of his work. She knew too much to get away. Her husband's company, while perfectly legal and reasonably profitable, was a mere cover for the cartel working behind the scenes. Marijuana, mostly, but also weapons and slaves.
"Yes," John agreed. "Yes. And I'm glad you didn't get yourself killed. Come on, it's getting late. We should head home."
John turned his head to see a door slave standing in the doorway. As was to be expected of his kind, the man was well over his fifties, but eager to help him find his way in the building complex.
"You don't think I'll keep you?" John asked, clearly wanting to avoid any further discussion of his browsing history.
Holmes didn't say anything for the rest of their dinner apart from thanking him yet again after he was done. John stared at his blog in an attempt to write a new entry, but ended up deleting each sentence he managed to start. In the end he just re-read all his previous entries, if they could have even been called that, and made a new entry with a single line:
A good bottle and a bad bottle. One of which Hope had slid across the table to him. His grand manoeuvre.
Sherlock's hand trembled as he pretended to examine the potentially deadly capsule between his gloved fingers. Jeff Hope watched him, his own pill already almost on his lips.
Holmes peered his eyes opened and got up in one swift motion. Right before disappearing into the bathroom, he stopped hesitantly and slowly turned back to look at John.
Sherlock pulled aside the blanket, too frustrated to keep lying down. His back was still sore from the beatings, so he rather stood anyway. He got dressed in silence and made his way to the kitchen to silently get the breakfast ingredients ready.
He couldn't fall asleep again, but he tried not to move in order to not wake his owner. It wouldn't even make much sense to try sleep more. It was early in the morning, and John's alarm would go off within the hour.
"With a laser sight. Check the opposite building. Ground floor, first floor. Maybe even second floor. We were close enough to the windows, but my guess is ground floor. Acclimatised to violence, military background. The shooter didn't aim to injure, he shot to kill. But he didn't shoot until my life was in danger..." Sherlock trailed off. It didn't seem probable the shooter had deliberately waited until he was in danger.
Mycroft closed his eyes, leaning his chin against his fingertips. "No, no they won't. They'll get us sold for a higher price if we are separated."
"Slavers will take away naughty kids," Sandy had warned him many times. Even Mummy had said it. "Stop or I'll have your father sell you."
John had already finished and mostly given up on trying to prompt his slave to eat more when Holmes's eyes lit up and he straightened his back in alert.
John glanced at the desk drawer and thought of his pistol. But Holmes was already out of the door, so he took his cane and followed as quickly as his limp allowed.
The thought of Mycroft made him angry. Stupid, stupid fat Mycroft. Where was he now? Why wasn't he here? Why hadn't he done anything? Mycroft had told him it'd be good if he was sold. But it wasn't good at all. Maybe Mycroft had always wanted to sell him. Tears fell down his face when he remembered the times he'd bullied Mycroft, the times he'd got himself in trouble and Myc had muttered: "Behave, Sherlock. Don't you know that bad kids are sold as slaves?"
So John did not back away from his threat. After they'd had breakfast and Holmes had done the dishes, he had ordered his slave to remove his shirt once more. Still very sore from the previous night, Holmes moaned in pain every time the leather touched his skin, though John was far more gentle this time. But Holmes did not shy away from the belt. The man faced the consequences of his actions without a word of protest and rightfully asked for forgiveness after it was done.
"But there's more," Sherlock cut him off before he could finish. Being interrupted by a slave who acted like an equal always took them by surprise –and Sherlock felt more confident by each sentence. "Your clothes are worse than mine. About...three years old? You aren't planning ahead much."
and it's only a matter of time until the fifth victim turns up! I can stop the fifth from happening. It's pure idiocy from your part if you won't let me help them!"
They were served their final meal together at what seemed like early morning. The auction would begin at ten in the morning, but neither knew at what point they would be taken to the hall. Mycroft had been to a smaller scale slave market once. The slaves had been arranged in groups by age and sex or sometimes by their skills. He had heard the Greater London Slave Auction to be held in a separate building with large halls where the slaves would be arranged by age. They might have to stand for hours, enduring how people looked at them like they were objects (
"What's with your brother's, er, his collar?" he asked instead of pursuing the topic of his slaves original name. "It's… Well it's enormous."
you to trust me. I want you to know that with me you are protected. I won't let anyone harm you. Not again. I promise."
Mycroft's fingers gripped him harder. "Please, Sherlock, this isn't a game. We are going to be sold, we are slaves now. You have to–" Mycroft cut himself off abruptly when a loud bell rang somewhere in the corridor. Mycroft pulled him into a tight embrace unlike anything he'd ever shared with his brother before. Sherlock's initial reaction was to pull away, but Mycroft only held him closer, his naked chest feeling warm against Sherlock's face. After a few dragging seconds that seemed to last forever he returned the embrace awkwardly. His hands wouldn't properly reach around Mycroft's body. In any other situation he would have cruelly teased his overweight elder brother, but now the thought didn't even cross his mind. His hug was clumsy at first, but soon he was clinging onto Mycroft for the dear life of his.
Hope could claim it to be chess all he wanted. A mind game, a way to determine which of them was superior.
"Holmes took it, sorry. Well, Detective Inspector sort of gave it to him, but I don't think he meant for Holmes to keep it. Is there any way you could pass me to him? It's about the pink lady."
Sherlock thought of mistress Summers. He had been as agreeable and obedient as it was possible for him to be. Fat load of good that had done to him.
Breakfast between them had become by far one of John's favourite things. They might watch the morning news in the sitting room or he could read the newspaper, and he could comment on things like he was talking to a perfectly normal human being. During the breakfast he often forgot Holmes was a slave at all. They talked and they joked and they laughed together. And each time the spell would eventually break, leaving John feel awkward and uncomfortable. Holmes was not his friend. No matter how natural and right it may have felt to speak with him, it wasn't right. It only caused tension to built up between them when at first they were acting like friends and then abruptly switched back to master and slave.
"Seems like it... I'd like to meet some of these friends of yours," John requested as they moved through the kitchen.
"The victims didn't know each other, they were all found in random, empty places they had no reason to go to. None of them had a reason to commit suicide and all of them were taken from crowded places and/or only moments after having talked with someone they knew."
He did, but by next summer Mycroft was sold to MI5 and Sherlock had expected to never see him again. Mycroft may have believed him dead for the past four years, but Sherlock hadn't heard a thing from him for nine years until The Oyster House was all over the news and Mycroft saw his face on a newspaper. Not that it would have helped, had Mycroft been able to keep an eye on him.
Sherlock could only nod. Someone rolled down the window of a car across the road. It was a fine car. Black, shiny in the sun with tinted windows. But Mycroft's clothes alone were enough to tell his owners were wealthy.
Pity being hit by a rugby trophy hadn't killed the man. Though had he died or been permanently injured there would've been nothing Greg could've done to save Sherlock's life. After being taken away in slave cuffs the next time Greg saw him he had been under a very real threat of termination. His case had attracted some attention from slave rights activists, but it was Greg who ultimately spoke in defence of 99OR-79/3J3A.
"I might have. He seems agreeable," Mycroft mused, eying the brother he hadn't seen in years. "Come, let's talk elsewhere. I'll treat you a proper meal. You look like you need it."
Sherlock recoiled violently from the corpse, stumbling backwards and ripping off his gloves. He threw them away in near panic, breath caught in his throat. The room had become eerily silent.
"I met a friend today", he told, not entirely sure why. He supposed it was just nice to have someone to talk to. He was reminded of Ella writing down "friend" and fought the urge to grimace. He wasn't thinking Holmes as a friend. Absolutely not. Plenty of people talked to their slaves, he reasoned, though a small voice insisted only lonely and old people actually considered their slaves conversation material. He was reminded of an old man who lived on the other side of the street when he and Harry were kids. He often sat in his tiny front garden or walked painfully slowly to the news agency at the end of the street. His slave always followed him, listening to the same stories over and over again, always laughing at his jokes, always responding to them with interest and enthusiasm, regardless of having heard them hundreds of times already.
He couldn't conceal his smirk nor the smugness of his voice. "How did you get them take the poison?"
"Master, he's just a child!" she argued. A month ago Mycroft would've slapped her for talking back. Today it didn't feel appropriate.
"I could play at weddings. Not the best season for that, and people plan those months ahead. Birthdays, corporate events."
Holmes steepled his fingers and tilted his head as he looked at John. "So not something you saw or could have prevented. You've personally done it."
