"Was to break the curse, I get it," Dean finishes for him, already shrugging back into his usual persona.
Dean waits until the others are preoccupied debating a possible alternate spelling, possible typo, before leaning in close to Castiel. "Love you."
His instant thought being that he has to pick Claire up from a sleepover tomorrow morning is probably not a good argument in his favour.
"No, seriously. I don't even get flowers? You don't go down on one knee?" Dean jibes, grounding himself in the humour of it.
Sam's arrival seems to put Emma on edge. Dean can't blame her, but he can't figure out a way around it either. He's tried to talk some sense into Sam so many times before Purgatory and it never made a difference.
"How do you know she didn't kidnap you and hit you over the head and now she's playing happy families while your real family is out there looking for you?" Emma rambles on. "Head injuries can cause amnesia. So can all kinds of drugs and stuff. She could've done it on purpose, even."
"This is definitely the one you should print out and hang on the wall," Claire says, pausing her swiping through the wedding album on her phone.
to do. It's not like she's had a huge amount of opportunity to find out between growing up in a motel room, having no friends at school, boarding at monster high and then road tripping to find obscure supernatural knowledge about Purgatory.
When that conversation dries up, and Emma's dessert arrives (Dean has no idea where she's putting it all now she's not having growth spurts), Emma pulls her Wonder Woman notepad out of her Wonder Woman bag and opens it up to show Sam. "Dad said you're better at Latin than he is. Do you think you could help me with my conjugation? I keep getting stuck."
"If Dad was here, he'd be stinking up the room with his half a decade old corpse," Dean says. "I'm not really sure what he has to do with any of this."
Charlie nurses her 'black magic' java and alligator shaped pancakes as though she's the one who was up driving half the night previous.
"Stay behind me," Dean cautions. He has no idea what the Trans' reactions will be to him showing up, and even less idea of their reaction to Emma. It's actually kind of odd thinking about how close Emma's come to meeting Kevin before, just a breath away really, but Dean isn't even sure he ever told Kevin he had a kid.
There's no car seat in his baby. His inanimate baby. Dean almost goes back to find one, but the sight of a car full of women headed down the street has him holding Emma in his lap and gunning it for the highway.
Dean huffs a laugh and reaches over to ruffle her hair, though it's really a lot more like stroking it. "Me too, kiddo."
Dean abandons his attempts to convince Jack that the fake car keys are just as attractive as the multi-coloured ring he lost to the germy kitchen floor. "What are you talking about?"
Dean laughs and goes willingly. Cas is a terrible dancer, but his drunken grins, and the sight of Sam trying to force his gangly limbs to follow Claire's instructions have Dean forgetting he'd even imagined this night in his life being any other way.
Instead of making the most of the quiet time, he drags himself out of bed, or off couch as the case may be, and starts putting his shit away. They're having the ceremony in the house, along with brunch before heading off to the Roadhouse for the party. Reception. Whatever. There's no chance he's leaving anything potentially incriminating around where Naomi and Crowley could sniff it out.
"We're not doing fancy clothes, we're gonna try to bum the flowers, Benny's on brunch, Charlie's on photography and invitations, we already paid for the license..."
The phone picks up again, moving closer to Sam's breathing. "They made him think he already had it. They figured it'd take away his doubts. I guess they figured you'd reciprocate and everything would work itself out."
Displaying all of the tact of a Winchester, Emma spends the trip to the mental hospital asking personal questions. She knows from Dean who Cas is, but she seems more hung up on his new fake life.
Dean may have called him a brother more than once, but Castiel knows full well that Dean would never feel comfortable kissing a man who isn't blood related to him, no matter the context. Dean's always been complicated with his affection, overly aware of how his actions could be interpreted by others and uncomfortable with anything that could attract accusations of softness or homosexuality.
"Dude, no! It's fine, I'm the one who should be sorry. I get a stupid monkey paw wish granted and you end up stuck with me hanging all over you." Dean shakes his head and kicks at the ground. "God, I can't believe I told you- Shit! Look, can we just pretend like I didn't get us hexed into a fake relationship and make you cuddle with me?"
He doesn't know what he's said to get this far. His mouth was on autopilot, only knowing he had to get closer to... to her. "Yeah," he responds belatedly. He steps towards the crib the moment he's alone with the baby. She's beautiful. Dean looks up as Lydia comes back in with the drinks. He must've been staring longer than he'd thought. "What's her name?"
"I know this isn't ideal, and I wouldn't ask it of you if I could see another way," Cas begins. "But I... It wouldn't have to be real. Well, technically it'd have to be real, legal. But it would just be on paper, and I wouldn't stop you from... You could still see people and- and date, and keep your apartment if you want to. I can take care of this place myself, and the kids, and I-"
Castiel debates whether or not to sit down again, hovering uncertainly in place until Dean catches his hand once more and squeezes it.
Emma flinches, then slowly complies. She doesn't pull away when Dean grabs for her wrist and looks at the scar there. The Amazon brand. She licks her lips. "It's not what you think."
He peels the baby from her arms and tries to ignore how she's already so much bigger than she was just five minutes ago. "How do I look after her?"
Castiel looks back over towards the blanket, at Dean sipping on his beer and frowning down at his hands. "I should get back to him."
"Since when?" Castiel asks as gently as he's able with the pain and rage at the unfairness of it all tightening his chest.
Dean rolls his eyes. The kid's always had a knack for acting like she's all grown up already, like she knows everything and has been around long enough to be jaded by it. It's only got worse since he's got back. Do all teenagers act like that, or is it just his kid that acts like she's already coming out the other side of a midlife crisis?
"If you want to surround yourself with monsters, that's your choice, Dean. Just leave me out of it," Sam says.
They establish that the spell, as they assume it to be, hasn't planted any particular memories. Though Dean insists he and Cas are together and that they've kissed, among other things Castiel tries not to dwell upon, when questioned he can't remember the first time they kissed, or any other specific memories of them together. There don't seem to be any other memories or beliefs out of the ordinary, either. Whatever the spell does, it's limited to his belief in his romantic relationship to Castiel.
"I'm making it real," Castiel says. "You're right. Even if the spell caused everything else, it didn't cause this."
Emma finally starts to show a little empathy. "I don't know. But I'd maybe try and figure it out before you go home."
She rolls her eyes and swallows the gunk that can barely be classed as a foodstuff. "No. I eat the same as a regular human." She pauses in thought. "A little more than most people, maybe."
Dean scans the menu board above the counters, as eager to avoid having this conversation head on as she is. "Dunno. Maybe. Listen, we should head out. Longer we leave it, more chance there is for things to go south. You ready?"
Emma takes a steadying breath, bracing against the rejection. He's just trying to protect her. That's all it is. It's not him leaving her behind again now he's got Sam back. "Okay."
"Cool," Dean says, then awkwardly leans in. Castiel meets him halfway. A little time later, Dean breaks away. "Wow. Okay, we should probably leave the park before we give all these nice families a show."
Dean sits up. "Didn't make you cry, did I?" He jokes, a worried groove between his eyebrows as he leans forward into Castiel's space and tries to meet his eyes. "I know I'm not the best with this stuff, but I didn't think I did that badly telling it."
She doesn't say anything, but it's clear she hears the threat. She shifts, eyes going freaky red and fingers flexing. He's sure they'll turn to claws the second he gets close.
Dean considers the question. Mulls over what he'd do if Dad was still around, or if he found out he was still alive somewhere. "Wouldn't make a difference. I'm getting married, Sammy. He wasn't here for any of the rest of it, so I don't need him there for that. He didn't need my approval to go chasing after a ghost, I don't need his approval for this."
"Great," Dean says. He's getting married. It's all arranged and planned and the man in front of him is really gonna swear to love and cherish him for the rest of his life. Even is it fake.
This whole thing really wasn't endearing the dead society to her. Emma shakes her head, trying to get her mind back on topic. "So, what? You think I'm one of these legacies or something?" The thought was kind of ridiculous.
His phone chimes and Dean checks it as they climb back into the Impala. Charlie, the chick they met at Dick's offices has sent a message to confirm she's sent hardcopy forgeries of Emma's birth certificate and other documents to the address they agreed on. They've only known her a few days and she's already proven a useful contact, even beyond the hard drive. Now that the papers are sorted out, Dean has a decision to make. And it's one he's none too keen on making.
"But then you went all dick angel on us," Dean continues, "and I was still into you, so bang went that theory, but it wasn't like I was gonna ever do anything about it because like I said, dick angel."
His shoulders pull back and his chin raises. He reaches for Dean's hand and lifts it between them, sliding the ring into place. "With this ring, I gladly marry you and join my life to yours."
With that he vanishes into his room, leaving him alone with an unnaturally affectionate Dean who is determined to show him a movie about a machine that plays tic-tac-toe despite the fact the whole thing will be spoiled for him by Metatron's implanted knowledge the moment the title appears.
"Make what different?" Emma asks. She doesn't change back. Just squirts some more cheese into her mouth and waits for an answer.
"You okay, buddy? Kinda zoned out on us there," Dean says. Even his voice is softer than normal, easy concern without awkward humour pasted over it.
Claire grins at him, mouth stretching impossibly wider. "It's okay. My bachorlette party will have actual strippers though."
Cas turned around to see Mary Winchester standing in the doorway. He smiled warmly at her, and she rushed across the room to greet him with a hug.
A gratuitous Dean-and-Cas-watching-a-movie-together-and-Dean-falls-asleep-on-Cas'-shoulder scene? In MY version of Supernatural? It's more likely than you think.
“We spent years hunting down the thing that killed you,” John growled. “Trying to honor your memory. I died trying to do that for you.” Dean’s stomach rolled. “And now you’re throwing away your family– your blood family– for some random kids?”
“You’re not powerful enough, Rowena,” Lucifer chided. Tears streamed down the witch’s face. “You’ll never be powerful enough. No power in the world can ever stop you from being a pathetic weakling.”
Kaia pushed herself to her feet and stumbled towards the voice. She tried to shout, but her vocal chords were shot. She coughed, and continued on shaky, poorly exercised ankles, towards the girl who had shown her her scars.
“Right,” Sam said, still a little bit shocked by the outburst, “okay. But at least we know the spell we need is in there. And we have a plan.”
Before Sam or Rowena could do anything, the portal flashed brightly. Not even looking at who had just come through, Sam dove for Jack, scooping him up and running out of the room. His heart raced, bordering on heart attack speed. Jack began to cry as Sam reached the nursery, placing Jack in his crib and within the safety of the extra powered wardings hidden by the blue cloth on the walls. Rowena had helped him earlier that week to make them so that Gabriel and Cas could get through, but no other nonhuman being, except maybe God after a few good bursts of power.
“Fascinating,” Donatello mused, leaning over the infant. “You know,” he said quietly but somewhat professionally to the child, “I’ve met your father. Your power’s nothing like his, no no no. Not dark, not toxic.”
“Dean, wait a second,” Sam interrupted. Dean turned to him. “Jack saved us. He’s barely a few days old, and he saved us.”
How could that tiny thing be evil? He didn’t want to believe that Jack could be evil, but he couldn’t dismiss the possibility. Not when he was the reason that Mom and Cas were dead.
With a grunt, he pushed himself to his feet, and made his way to the front door. He grabbed the salt-loaded shotgun that he kept on a tall rack by the stairs. Another knock sounded as he reached the top step. He cocked the shotgun, undid the lock, and opened the door.
“Okay,” Dean agreed, but didn’t relax even a little bit. Charlie holstered her gun, and turned down the trail they had found themselves on.
Before Cas could even process that there was a gun in his face, it clattered to the floor. Dean stared at him with wide eyes.
“No, I’m not,” Sam agreed, gently shutting the door behind him. No point in lying to this girl. “My name is Sam Winchester.”
Inside, there were skeletal wing marks scorched into the walls and angel blades melted into the floor. Jody and Donna walked slowly, guns pointing the way.
“No!” Lucifer shrieked deafeningly, waving his arm wildly. The doll was knocked out of Sam’s hand as he went flying. He hit the wall sickening crunch, but between the adrenaline and his throbbing head, he couldn’t feel what had broken. When he landed on the floor, arm pinned beneath him, he didn’t move. He wasn’t sure that he could if he tried. He watched, his line of sight at a crooked angle, as Lucifer turned toward him.
Dean shook his head, turning his attention to the child in Cas’ arms. He scrambled to his feet and rushed to Cas’ side. “Cas, tell me what’s going on. Is he going to be okay?”
That snapped Dean back to reality. The last thing he wanted to do was become the distant father figure John had been. He pushed himself out of bed, groaning with the effort.
“Dean!” he heard Patience yell, but the wraith was already onto him, jumping from between two hanging tarps. It slammed him against the wall, knocking the gun from his hand, then threw him against a post. In the split second before the wraith stabbed him with a knife, Dean managed to duck beneath his arm and drive a knee between his legs. He grabbed it by the shoulders and shoved it away from him, then grabbed a length of rope hanging from a nearby pillar. In one swift motion, he deflected the wraith’s stabbing motion and wrapped the rope around its wrists. The wraith shoved him off again, but Dean landed next to a scythe. Perfect. Dean grabbed it and swung at the creature, but it shoved him against another wall. But he was prepared for this; he swung out of the wraith’s grasp and switched their positions, so that the wraith was against the wall, and drove the wraith’s knife into its stomach. It must have been silver, because the wraith gasped and fell to the ground.
Dean debated lying, or brushing the question off, but he was done pretending, or maybe he was still tired and didn’t have the energy to put on a ‘just fine’ face. “No, Sam, I’m not okay. I’m pretty far from okay.” He inhaled deeply. “You know, my whole life, I always believed that what we do is important. No matter what the cost, no matter who we lost, whether it was Dad or Bobby or….” He swallowed thickly, his throat suddenly dry. “And I would take the hit. But I kept on fighting because I believed that we were making the world a better place. And now Mom and Cas….” Memories of that horrible night flashed through his mind. “And I don’t know. I don’t know.”
“Take the baby,” Sam grunted, holding Jack out to Dean so he could get a better reach toward the hex bag. Dean barely managed to grab him before he slipped from Sam’s fingers. Jack seemed very entertained by the whole ordeal, and simply giggled.
Dean clenched his jaw tightly before speaking. “All right, this is a safe place, right Doc?” Dr. Vallens nodded kindly. “Okay. My brother’s delusional.”
“I did,” Cas agreed, “I thought it was very sweet that you brought me up to carve my own name into the Lebanon sign.”
Dean woke handcuffed to the fireplace in Dr. Vallens’ office. He pulled against the cuffs, pointlessly, then glanced over to where Jack was sleeping on the couch. The baby was still out cold, unharmed but entirely oblivious to the danger they all were in. Dr. Vallens and a blood-drenched man, the one who had been wearing Sam’s face, were arguing.
“That’s the thing. She doesn’t have a name, because I made the story up. There was never a mine on that mountain.”
“Turns out rage is a good motivator,” Lucifer growled, “and I think you forgot something. I’m Lucifer.”
When he had finally read Jack enough books to break through his sugar high, he snuck down to the Dean Cave. He didn’t feel like dealing with the people hanging out in the library.
“Whoa whoa whoa,” Donna said, grabbing her arm, “we’re gonna go back, right? You know, tell the girls?”
Jack wailed in displeasure as Sam zipped up the front. All of a sudden, the light bulbs in the room exploded, showering the two inhabitants with glass and sparks. Sam instinctively threw himself over the baby, shielding him from the shrapnel. When the dust settled, he lifted himself enough to look Jack in the face. He looked back at Sam with a blank expression that could only possibly belong to babies.
Sam grabbed Jack a new, clean onesie– this one blue with a teddy bear on the front– and put it on him, thankful that he got no complaint in the form of exploding lightbulbs this time.
“I know what Rowena is dealing with.” There. He said it. Unpacked his trauma right there in the Impala, exactly like Dean hated to do. “And she’d not the only one who… feels helpless.” He couldn’t bring himself to look up, look his brother in the eye.
Somehow, she knew that the glowing figures she’d seen were angels. And somehow, she knew that Dean needed to find the girl that they were holding captive.
“Well, he has a little case of the flu, but he’s fighting it extremely well for someone as young as him. His fever broke last night, and he’ll probably have headaches for the next day or so, but he will be alright.” He paused. “It’s a good thing you brought him in, though. There are many bigger problems that it could have been. Your boy got lucky.”
“For Dean? No.” Michael shrugged. “Adam and I have formed a quite profound bond during our time in Hell.”
“Honestly?” She paused. “I could use some help.” Sam could have sworn he heard sirens in the distance over the phone.
Cas nodded, following him cautiously. He wasn’t sure where he and Dean stood, now. His throat began to close up with anxiety. Had he ruined their friendship?
The girls glanced at each other nervously, then yelled “Moveantur!” in unison, flinging the two brothers against the far wall. Goddamn, he was getting too old for this shit. All of his joints creaked as he attempted to push himself up from the floor. Thank Chuck they’d decided to leave Jack in the car. Not that he liked the idea of a baby unsupervised in the car, but it was better than some witches killing the kid.
“Really?” Dean said flatly. He wouldn’t have gone on the hunt if he’d known that Sam would try to get him to open up to some overpaid shrink. “No, I’m… I’m good.” He forced a chuckle, as if that could make it true. He wasn’t good, but talking to a stranger about it wasn’t going to solve anything. “I’m good, with death, closure, whole freaking bottle of Jack.”
“I– I thought it was Donatello!” Sam retorted defensively, “He got past the warding and everything!” Cas leaned back and pinched the bridge of his nose, as if he had a headache. “And besides, you saw Jack, he’s fine now.”
“We’ve been stopping real estate developers when we could’ve been hunting Dracula?” Fred whispered in disbelief. “Are you kidding me?! My life is meaningless!”
“What is she talking about?” Alex really hadn’t said anything, but, well, that was exactly what was wrong.
Dean deliberated for a moment before answering. “Well, last time Gabriel zapped us into television-land, we had to play our part to get out, right?”
Sam set the ice bucket down next to Cas, and pulled Jack’s bag from underneath the coffee table, digging around for the aspirin. His heart pounded in his chest.
“That’s his dad,” Dean said, then froze. Hadn’t he said that Jack was his kid? Sure, it was true, but that implied that he and Cas….
All of a sudden, the windows began to frost over. The phantom burst through the doors, and flung the members of the Scooby Gang against the walls with a wave of its hand.
Before he even realized what he was doing, he flipped back the sheet from Cas’ head. His eyes were closed.
“Get them into the boat!” Dean yelled to Sam. Jack began to scream louder, clutching to Sam’s jacket as he grabbed a duffel bag from his brother.
She huffed, set down the pot of soup and the ladle between one of her girls and the daughter of one of the patrolmen, and followed Bobby.
“What do you think?” Dean asked quietly, “I know it’s not quite what you and Kelly prepared, but….” Cas’ heart panged in his chest when he thought of Kelly. They hadn’t expected her to survive the birth, but the confirmation hurt regardless.
“Oh, come on, Castiel,” the Devil whined, “we just fought side by side, mano e mano, you gotta trust me now, man. Come on.”
“In a few minutes, we’re gonna find out that Cousin Simple’s missing,” Dean explained, “the Scoobies are gonna think it’s a ghost, but really it’s just the lawyer Cosgood Creeps in disguise.”
Inside was a severed head and legs, laying in pools of blood beneath a torso tied to the ceiling with rope. Cas figured it would look incredibly gruesome if it were not in a cartoon.
By the time she was finished with the song, Jack was fast asleep. She set him down gently, so as not to wake him, then returned to the rocking chair.
A lump formed in Dean’s throat. There had been that time, before Cas had returned from the Empty, when he thought he’d have to drive up by himself and carve it for his angel. Well, human now. “Yeah, well, I thought it would be a good enough excuse to get you up here.”
They lowered their guns when they saw the familiar redhead descending the staircase, wearing an orange silk blouse that matched her fiery hair, paired with flowing black silk pants.
It shouldn’t have, but the comment took Sam aback. The haunted look on Dean’s face was one he hadn’t seen in years. It reminded him of when his dad used to talk about their mom.
“Hey there, handsome,” one of the sisters said huskily. Her voice made Dean’s skin crawl. He cocked his gun in response.
The monster roared again from the not-so-distance before either of the Winchesters could comment on that.
“I’m not sure what’s going on,” Gabriel piped up, “but it honestly sounds safer to just wait it out down here.” Cas had almost forgotten about Gabriel.
Dean was surprised to wake up to sunlight instead of Jack crying. He remembered how many times Sam had woken them up with screaming when he was little. He reached to where he had laid Jack down, but there was nothing but sheets. No baby.
“Ooh, ouch,” Dean quipped, hoping he could get under the ghoul’s skin enough that he wouldn’t notice the Sarge behind him, loading up his shotgun. “Breakups can be a bitch.”
Sam busied himself with unloading the groceries into their correct places while Dean began to cook. When he glanced behind him, he saw Cas and Eileen sitting next to each other, signing a conversation too fast for Sam to follow. Rowena was sipping at her wine, lost in thought.
They ran hand in hand through the forest. Kaia ducked expertly between the trees, her grip on Claire’s hand never faltering.
Sam looked at Cas questioningly, but Cas just shrugged in return. Which movie was it that was set in Dodge City? The movie nights that he and Dean had had, sitting in recliners and squinting at a laptop screen with yet another western with a far-too-similar-to-the-last-movie plot had all blurred together.
“Really?” Lucifer shot back, “I seem to remember a certain somebody snacking on angel grace once upon a time.”
“Hi, Jody.” Was she in trouble? She didn’t think she was in trouble. It had been a while since she’d heard from Jody, though.
Dean opened the door to the most atrocious motel room Sam could ever remember them staying in. There were honest-to-Chuck saloon doors sectioning off the living area from the beds, cutouts of cowboys on the walls, bulls horns, and old timey photographs of various famous outlaws. There was even a stuffed bison head.
“Gloria was killed by her son,” Dean explained, leaving the accusation in his tone. “Or at least someone who looked like him.”
“No!” Dean cried as the girl flung Cas backward onto the boulder-strewn ground. He grunted in pain, but thankfully did not hit his head. Dean swung again, but she flickered away again.
I know this chapter is kinda short, but don't worry I've got the rest of the fic planned out, I just need to write it (easier said than done, lol).
Sam stared at the child in disbelief. It was so human, so helpless. This tiny little person could bring the universe to its knees? Could tear through the fabric of space and time? It seemed impossible.
They drove quickly and silently, Baby’s engine roaring. James was out the door they had fully screeched to a halt.
Finally, he came to a heavy iron door. He pushed it open and heaved himself out, falling farther to the floor than he anticipated. The shock of landing on concrete shot pain through his hip, and he groaned.
“He’s biologically the son of Lucifer,” Cas explained, leaning against the counter. “But his mother entrusted him to me. Unfortunately, I was dead for a while, so Dean had to take over parenting duties during that time. Now, we’re co-parenting.”
Suddenly, rage clouded her vision. She stood and turned to Kaia’s killer. It was a hooded figure, about the same height as her. She ran toward it, knife drawn.
“Oh, dude,” she groaned. The thing was pale and sickly, with a metal mask where a human would have a nose and mouth.
“Well, I said I needed a big win,” Dean replied, shrugging. “We got Cas back.” He smiled. “That’s a pretty damn big win.”
“Oh, does he have big plans?” Lucifer scoffed. “What’s that gonna be worth when Michael gets here and, oh yeah, murders us all?”
“So… how are you?” Sam asked. Of course he was concerned about Cas’ feelings. Although Dean admitted he had been wanting to ask the same thing.
Sam fumbled through the bag, hands trembling until he found what he was looking for. He turned to Lucifer.
The group trekked back to their cars, stumbling in the dark twilight. Sarah turned to them as she unlocked her car.
“Dean Winchester,” Dean replied, “and this is Cast– Cas Winchester.” No way was he telling her his full name. It sounded too angelic, and with angel-killing bullets floating around….
She paused to think before answering. “Oh, God. I think I know.” She turned to the chest of drawers behind her, and pulled out an ornate white box. From the box she procured a photo of a smiling man with a short beard. “His name’s Buddy. When we got together, I was young and stupid. He’s a shifter, like me. The only one I’d ever met other than my mother. But he liked hurting people.” She paused a moment, tears welling in her eyes. “I left. Changed my face, my name.” She inhaled deeply. “Buddy wouldn’t just kill people. He’d ruin their lives. He said he liked to see the look on their face when they realized they had nothing left.” She looked at Sam pleadingly. “What I’m doing here… I know it can’t make up for what… what he… what we did. But I’m trying.”
“Yeah, Fred,” Dean said loudly behind Sam. “He can be such a jerk.” Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes, and instead adjusted the blanket over the body, hiding it from view.
“No,” Dean replied, “It’s just, he thinks he’s so cool with his perfect hair, and his can-do attitude, and his stupid ascot.” He shook his head. He really couldn’t explain why he hated Fred so much. He was everything Dean wanted to be: a leader, unafraid, good in an emergency. And yet, he rubbed Dean the wrong way somehow. He just couldn’t make sense of the dude.
“Cool it?!” Gabriel practically shrieked, twisting to look at Dean. Jack whimpered in his arms, waking from his nap.
A soft noise from the baby monitor caught his attention, but Jack was just dreaming, not crying. Glowing blue butterflies made of grace fluttered around his head. That enchanted mobile from Rowena was truly wonderful.
He made his way back up to the room, still wondering about Cas versus Lucifer’s influence. When he opened the door, he immediately noticed the glass on the floor and how dark it was. And the empty carrier beside Sam.
They sprinted the whole way, Kaia at Claire’s side. Through the forest, the fallen leaves soft beneath their feet. If there weren’t so many monsters here, Claire thought it could be beautiful.
“You did always think you were too good for me,” the man said, advancing on Dr. Vallens, “even though I gave you everything.”
“Jack doesn’t know you from any other stranger.” Lucifer’s footsteps stopped. “He doesn’t even look like you. But he has his mother’s eyes.”
“So, do you want to tell us that you’re innocent again?” Dean’s voice was hard as stone, and Sam hoped he wouldn’t shoot until they’d truly proved that Dr. Vallens had killed those people. It just didn’t sound right to Sam.
“The Winchesters,” Cas replied, despite every instinct telling him not to direct this being’s anger at his friends. But he was scared, more scared than he’d ever been in his entire life, more scared than when they’d faced Michael and Lucifer at the cemetery all those years ago. “Sam and Dean, they must’ve made a deal.”
Cas swallowed. Dean wondered if he actually needed to, or if that was just a human gesture he’d picked up. “And you found this out how, exactly?” He gave Dean a pointed look.
“Stop.” Dean almost wished he could. Almost. But now that he’d uncapped the bottled up emotions in him, he couldn’t stop the flow.
“A spell of my own invention.” Rowena waved her hand lazily, and the cork popped out of the bottle. She poured herself a glass before continuing. “No sinister steep price, but it cannot be used again.” She shrugged. “And it’s very similar to the one we need to kill Lucifer.”
Sam whirled around, but it was just Donatello. “Geez, man, didn’t hear you come in. He didn’t like it when I changed him into clothes.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Actually, I have some news for you guys about that.” He reached across the corner of the table and took Cas’ hand.
“His name was Carl Phillips. Deputy Carl Phillips. He’s… was my nephew. Some… psycho slit his throat and left the body for the coyotes to chew on.” He paused for a long moment. “I knew that boy since he was a day old.”
Kaia glanced nervously at the rift, then took Claire’s hand. Jody watched as she reached out a hand, and slowly and deliberately stepped toward the portal. They disappeared in a bright flash of light.
Cas was thinking the same thing. He watched as Mary kissed a rather jarred John goodbye, on her way to catch up with some girlfriends over coffee. Perfect. John made his way back into the house, glancing at the lake as he went. He locked the door behind him.
"Tamara's just a witch. She has nothing to do with any of this," Mrs. Tran argues. "I asked her to make something for me, that's all."
"The people at the town hall told me the same thing. Apparently the ground isn't too safe over there, so be careful. I'll be there soon," Charlie says. "I'm like, five minutes away."
"He didn't know," Dad tells him. "Not for most of it, anyway. And he couldn't tell you when I did let on."
They spend a week in the bunker, which opens just as easily for Emma as it did the first time, before Charlie reluctantly admits she should be going back to work.
"So, she just found an amnesiac by the lake and married him?" Emma asks. "Like, just marries this total stranger within a couple of months?"
"It was hard, is the point," Emma forces herself to come to the point. "It was our only lead when we started."
It's not that Dean's never suggested a morning off before, but Castiel can't help but wonder if Dean would be suggesting this if he wasn't under the influence of a spell.
"Emma, how about you go pick out some dessert for the road?" Dean suggests. They've got a way to go to the motel Dean told Sam about and he wouldn't mind a sugar rush to get him through the trip.
Dad pulls cuffs out from the back of his jacket. "Need to know only. Had to be sure of where he'd be, this was a good opportunity."
The wake is less maudlin. Claire and Amelia planned it together, and it's hard to stay quiet and serious with a background of cheesy pop ballads and a buffet of foods more at home at a kid's birthday party.
"Won't be joining us," Dean says. Then adds, "and stop using your cell phone when you're driving. It's stupid."
Cas gazes at him fondly and for a second Dean wonders what it'd be like if they were planning this thing for real. Getting married, moving in together, raising Claire and Jack together. It wouldn't be so bad, he thinks. Cas would make an amazing husband.
"Who's she?" Kevin asks, wide eyed and exhausted looking as ever. The kid barely looks any older than Emma, though he's got to have at least a year or two on her biological age.
It's a good point. "Crowley," Emma remembers. "Dad said something about Crowely and Cas opening purgatory. I bet he knows something."
Dean's had a grand total of six hours sleep and his two hour car nap while raising his monster kid over the last two days, unable to sleep too long at a time while she needed watching and feeding and teaching, and it's caught up with him. He's wobbling on his feet and his head feels like cotton. Memories of Cas wading into that lake merge with visions of Emma, dead alongside her mother and he doesn't have the energy to push them away. There's a bottle of booze in his duffel and he wants it like he wants his next breath.
Emma thinks for a second. "Okay. But if you shoot me, Dad's gonna be pissed." She flexes her fingers and lets the change flow over her. It feels like that moment after your ears pop from a pressure change. Everything gets a little sharper, brighter, louder, before her senses adjust.
"Garth?" Emma asks dubiously. She's never met him, but Dean's told her stories. Mostly funny ones. In fairness, most stories about Garth are funny stories.
It's Sam. Castiel picks it up, forcing himself to ignore the betrayed glare on Dean's face. "Sam. Did you get in touch with the wiccans?"
"I was going to tell you after the wedding, I swear, but you were dealing with so much already," Sam says. "I didn't think it would matter if I waited."
"I understand that your part was the spell, but I felt the need to be honest after today," Castiel says.
Every time, Dean watches as his baby brother tenses, inhales, looks away. He can't tell whether it's a good sign or a bad one.
After that, Sam gets that funny look on his face more often. When Emma asks him about college. When she tells him she doesn't like clowns either. Most of all when she calls him Uncle Sam.
Claire throws herself down on the stool next to him, shoulder jarring him out of his maudlin thoughts. She's grinning ear to ear, loose and easy from placebo alcohol, and panting from her dance battle with Jo, who's currently lying collapsed on the floor and yelling about being hot and thirsty.
Jody doesn't say Dad's dead. Doesn't say he's not coming back. That's good, because Emma might have to do something a regular girl couldn't and wouldn't do if she were to suggest that. Dad promised he'd be back, and he will be. Even if Emma has to drag him back herself. Even if she doesn't know where he is. She'll find out, and she'll get him back, and she'll leave this shitty town and it's shitty school with its shitty kids.
Whatever it is, it's clear that she doesn't want it seen. The wristband is probably less a stylistic choice and more a camouflage.
"I should leave," Castiel suggests. "I could go back to Pennsylvania and try to track down the witch. She may be a part of the group we met."
Emma likes driving. She's a lot like Dean, and he doesn't know how much of that is nature and how much is nurture. Aside from a lack of respect for Metallica (and don't think Dean didn't come close to disowning her over that) and Doctor Sexy, they have similar tastes in TV and music. She loves pie, though she can take or leave cheeseburgers. And she likes driving.
"The rings." Claire holds her hand out and takes the ring box from Sam's confused grasp. She  opens the box and holds them out on her open palm. "Here."
"She's my kid, Sam," Dean says. No matter how many times he says it, it never seems to stick. "And yeah, I believe her. She's not one of them. Why would she bother to come find me? Get me out of Purgatory? Their whole thing is killing their dads, not bringing them back from the dead. I don't know what the hell your problem is, but she's the only person in this family who
Emmanuel doesn't even attempt to answer her now. He's looking more and more horrified with every word from her mouth.
"If we really gotta have flowers, I'll ask around. Maybe someone with a greenhouse will be willing to donate to the cause," Dean says to break the moment and give him an excuse to drag his eyes away from Cas' soft smile and back to the budget sheet. "What else we got on the list?"
She leads him a little away from this more thriving, more franchise filled block and into a more run down street. There are a handful of places open, and then there's a  gap. Like someone decided that this street was where town should end and anything past it closed up accordingly.
Like he can hear the maudlin thoughts, Cas grabs Dean's wrist and pulls him upright. "We should dance, too, before Claire forces us into it."
"Why would anyone want Dean to think he's banging Cas?" Kevin asks bluntly, when they explain it to him.
Sam heaves another heavy, uncomfortable sigh down the phone, stopping to clear out the cough it brings with it. "They said it'd end on its own when... when you were in a relationship for real."
"You guys are disgusting," Dean tells them all, Sam included despite his protest that he had nothing to do with the incest talk. He takes a seat next to Castiel and pulls a book towards him.
An hour later, Dean's nursing his third coffee and trying not let a goofy smile take over his face as Sam enthusiastically explains complex Latin grammar rules to an equally enthusiastic Emma. "Wish you'd been there for the home schooling," Dean says when they finally finish. "Kid coulda been doing quantum physics by now."
"Then I guess you break up," Sam replies tetchily. "Look, the spell hasn't hurt him. I get it's awkward, but if you could just... I dunno, ask him out or something. You don't have to get married or anything, just make it real for a little while. It's not a big deal. People date and have awkward break ups all the time."
"Where'd you go?" Emma asks lightly. She hadn't been worried. Not really. It's just hard to rationalise with her instinct not to let him out of her sight now she's finally got him back.
Castiel glances back towards the kitchen, where Dean's making him a hot cocoa on his request. They'd wanted him out of the way while they had this conversation to avoid the pointless stress that comes with trying to explain it all to Dean only for him to become extremely upset and then immediately forget the whole conversation.
"He's a hunter! He's lasted this long, hasn't he?" Dean feels the need to defend the man, partially because he feels guilty for trash talking him and partially because this is beginning to feel like the time he tried to convince his middle school teacher that Sammy ate his homework.
Sam's eyes skip away guiltily, and Dean isn't sure what the guilt is over, but he'll take the end result. "I'll be there. What time?"
"Funny thing is, she came back all on her own seven months later. Not a scratch on her," Sam says. "Right after a hunter burned down a house full of Amazons."
It's back in its place in the car before he goes to pick up Sam, but it becomes a habit to put it on when he and Sam have split up. A part of his Fed get up that he's careful not to let Sam see.
Cas aims a weak smile towards him and doesn't meet his eye. "I am doing fine, Dean. It is good to be back."
"I guess," Sam repeats, brow furrowing as if his nerdy lawyer brain has been insulted by Emma succeeding where he's failed. "She with him now?"
"Hey, why don't we take the morning off. Celebrate both of you being conscious in the a.m at the same time," Dean suggests.
If Dean had ever bothered to imagine the night before his wedding, this would be the furthest thing from what he'd have fantasised. Sat in the same bar he's spent countless nights in with his spouse-to-be sat two stools down with Charlie listening to Sammy's drunken, soppy stories about Dean when they were kids, his soon-to-be kind of step-kid two feet away, Dean himself barely tipsy out of paranoia that Claire will get drunk or hurt or something and not only be drunk or hurt but also prove he and Cas as unfit parents.
"I don't wanna hear it," Dean tells him. For better or worse, he made this decision and he's sticking with it. Emma is his. He glances over his shoulder at her. She's the same as she was thirty minutes ago. "We need to get Emma some clothes. It'll be easier now you're here."
It was easier when he hadn't known, and he could imagine that the only things he'd get from a romantic relationship with Dean that he didn't already have in his platonic one were sexual. He could tell himself it was nothing he couldn't live without, because as wonderful as he assumes sex can feel, as fun and passionate as heated kissing is, they'd only be an add on to what he already has with Dean. But now that he knows how easy and warm Dean could be with him were they really together he doesn't know how he can survive the want.
Emma thinks about the idea of being the descendant of two sexist secret societies obsessed with killing things and raising their kids to kill things. Namely each other. "It would be kind of funny. It a scary kind of way."
He stops on the way and goes to a bar. He wears the trenchcoat over his plaid and tries not to feel self conscious about it as he pushes through to order his drink. Some drunk splashes beer on the sleeve and Dean almost punches him out then and there, mostly stopped by the brewing panic over whether the liquid will stain and whether there's anything he can do to stop it.
Dean's making burgers when Cas comes back from the lawyer's office. One look at Cas and his heart sinks to his boots.
Emma shrugs. It's her go to comfort food these days, but there's no way in hell she's explaining that whole mess to him. "You want any?"
"You think I-" Dean cuts himself off and thinks longingly of the bar across the street. "I didn't send Cas away, okay? He leaves on his own. And Sam, he... It's not that he doesn't want you around-"
Emma shrugs and doesn't argue, even as the times she tried to help with hunts and her dad kept her away from them run through her head. Dad would've deliberately crashed the Impala before sending her after vampires. Emma wonders distantly if Uncle Sam even kept the car. "He's gone now."
"Great," Sam says, and edges back towards the sleeping quarters. "I'll pack some fresh clothes and leave in the morning."
"It's been a fun show, but I'll be damned if I have to watch my son french another guy," Dad says, a smile on his face like he isn't ruining everything. "Especially for no good reason."
Charlie chews tiredly, a little wall eyed even as she turns to focus on Emma. "I figured I'll head to the town hall, see if there's any blueprints from the era that don't quite add up. Chat up a secretary or two to see if there are any local rumours. You could take the library?"
They each get a face full of holy water upon entry, and Dean would be less pissed if he weren't also annoyed with himself for not thinking up demon fighting supersoakers first. He may not be the best and brightest, but he's been doing this his whole goddamn life, while the Trans have somehow come up with new tricks after a few months of knowing about demons.
"You shouldn't have got tied up in this," Dean continues. He forces a laugh and visibly erects his bravado around himself. "Freaking witches, man! The world'll do anything to mess with us, won't it?"
It's not a warm coat, but it's long and it's an extra layer, so Dean fumbles it over himself in the best approximation of a blanket he can manage and curls up into the seat to try to get some shuteye.
"We're..." Castiel can't bring himself to say they're fine, to reinforce Dean's idea of this fictitious relationship.
Cas who smiles at him reassuringly and not at all like a man about to fake-marry his best friend. He looks so happy that Dean has to take a moment to process it, because no one should look that happy standing across from Dean in front of an officiant, much less someone like Cas.
"No," Castiel says as reassuring as he's able. "No, it's not that. I'm fine, really. I just... I need to call Sam."
It's easier to hand Sam the license than to say the words. Dean clears his throat while Sam's eybrows creep up at the words on the page. "We, uh, we need to hold the ceremony as soon as possible, and it needs to look real."
"Like what?" Dean asks. He looks up at Castiel as though he might have the answers. When no answers are forthcoming he furrows his brow and attempts to work it out himself. "Is it a PDA thing? 'Cause I gotta say, I knew you were a prude, Sammy, but this is a bit of an overreaction."
Dean swallows and looks away as his eyes well up. "You're wrong. We... We kiss all the time. We're together, we've been together!"
Emma nearly considers walking straight back out, but she's no coward. This is her and Dad's room, and she doesn't really think Uncle Sam will hurt her. Not without a reason.
Claire and Cas level her with matching glares, and Dean wonders if it would count against him if he escaped this situation now.
She barely has time to inspect a few likely looking shrubs before her cell rings. She answers while poking at a large rock. "Yeah?"
His darling daughter ignores him. "I mean, what if you have family out there? What if you're already married?"
Dean puts down his fork and watches her for a moment. She's been angry at Naomi and sad at the funeral and amused at the fake wedding, but she's always seemed pretty damn sure she's staying with Cas. Until now, Dean hadn't really thought about what it must be like for her in that sense. Sure, she's got to be worried about living with Naomi and Crowley, leaving her home and everything, but Cas is the third guardian in a short time she could potentially lose. It must feel a little like getting orphaned all over again before she's even had time to process losing her folks.
Dean kind of always assumed the former. He's known he's going to go out that way since he was a kid and yeah, it sucks, but he tried normal with Lisa and that didn't suck any less. And he has Emma, now. Can't really retire to a nice little house in a nice little town and forget about the life when you have a kid with red eyes and claws. But Sam could, couldn't he? He was happy at school with his pretty fiance and their normal life. Happy with his girlfriend and his dog these last couple months. "Yeah, well. Normal ain't an option for all of us."
Castiel closes his eyes in mingled pain and relief. This is the first time that Dean's actually accepted the truth and it hurts to hear it in place of adamant denials and insistence that they really are together. The relief is short lived as Dean's hand on the side of his neck startles his eyes open again. His vision focuses just in time to be filled with Dean as he leans forward and presses their lips together, soft and pleading.
Cas' eyes lock onto his in the intense way they have since the first day they met, like he's seeing every part of Dean and weighing him up. It used to make him uncomfortable, but now... Well, Cas doesn't quite look at anyone else that way, so Dean guesses it makes him feel kinda special to warrant the attention. To be interesting enough for Cas to single him out for that kind of focus.
"I don't think so," Dean tells her. He doesn't say Sam wouldn't let him stick around anyway. A monster niece is one thing, and even that was touch and go a lot of the time, a random vampire Dean brought back with him from monster hell won't fly. Dean knows that.
Creepy is right. Dean knows the kind of people Crowley works with and for, a lot of them seem to end up in Sam's case files at the District Attorny's office, and all he can say is he and Naomi deserve each other. Sam's tried and failed for years to get anything on the guy. He even mentioned once that he thinks Crowley's firm might have had something to do with the drug cartel that had Mom and her folks killed.
Emma, by some miracle, does as she's told. She's sat at the counter in a Starbucks waiting for him when he gets into town. Probably picked the place out of spite, though.
"I've got a thing coming up, and I don't wanna miss it 'cause I ran out of holiday days and money," Charlie says. "Awesome as all this is, it's been here forty odd years, it'll probably still be here in a couple months."
He changes her again, takes a photo of her in her new car seat and goes through his mental list of motels in the area.
That evening in the bunker, Dean passes Castiel his cocoa and drops a kiss on his hair. "You know, maybe you shouldn't be drinking all that sugar every night. S'not good for you."
The fire blazes up quicker than even Emma was expecting. Even Amazonian strength isn't going to get them out of that building, and with a little luck, it'll be assumed that she was in the building too.
The bathroom door opens. Emma looks younger again in her pyjamas. Vulnerable and sleepy as she tucks herself in and smiles at him. "G'night, Dad."
"What about the police? Did she take you to the hospital, or get the police to look into who you are?" Emma continues. "Or did she just go 'hey, clearly the rational thing to do here is take him straight home and bang him'?"
Lydia freezes, then fixes him with a fake ass smile that's about as friendly as a punch in the face. "You're funny."
Uncle Sam ends his call and avoids looking at her as she climbs onto her bed and empties her bag onto it. He glances over and gets caught on the heap of junk food. "Is that three different cans of spray cheese?" He asks despite himself.
Castiel has known Dean a long time. Not in comparable terms; he's an angel, in those terms he's known Dean for less time than it took for Gabriel to take a nap after delivering a message. Even in terms of humanity, Dean's had his favourite shirt for longer than they've known each other. But in terms of knowledge, in terms of how long Castiel has truly known anyone, his relationship with Dean has been a long one. He knows Dean Winchester better and has done so for longer than he has known any other being, even those who Castiel has been technically related to for eons. He knows his deepest hopes and fears, his best and worst moments, his greatest and most deplorable aspects.
Emma's voice is quiet but insistent when she speaks again. "I haven't killed anyone else. Anything else."
It keeps Cas out of his head for a few hours. For the time that he's showing Emma how to use a stick shift, Dean doesn't think about Cas's face when he got his memories back or how he looked when they left, unconscious and battling with the devil from Sam's head. Instead he laughs, even if it hurts a little, and teases her when she kangaroos the car. She gets the hang of it, her innate confidence in her own abilities gliding her through the early nerves of being in control of a car for the first time. Before the day is over, they're cruising along at 50 and her gear changes are as smooth as Sam's. Dean decides she inherited it from him rather than her amazon side.
It smells of Cas. Or maybe Jimmy, maybe angels don't have their own smell. Dean kinda hates that he doesn't know. Either way it's a damn painful way to wake up and cuts through his hangover like a rusty knife. If he wasn't going to throw up before then he sure as hell will now.
Emma flips through the textbooks in front of her angrily enough she nearly tears a page and forces herself to calm down. She's in no state of mind to do anything productive, and the fact that even with her supernatural memory she can't remember a single thing she's been studying for the past hour is testiment to that, but she doesn't know what else to do. She'd switch from normal school subjects to supernatural ones but she doubts that'd fair any better and it's not like the local library is likely to have much by way of research materials. Even if Uncle Sam usually managed to find something.
Rachel shrugs. "We gotta keep the numbers up somehow. Hunters won't stop coming after us just because we learn how to use a diaphram."
Charlie sets off the next day and Emma spends the whole morning moping. She doesn't like being alone. Maybe that's a little hypocritical seeing as she's more often the one leaving than being left, but it still feels like she's tetherless. Like no one really wants her enough to ask her to stay and to stay with her in return. She knows that's dramatic and what Jody would probably call her teenage angst while rolling her eyes. Doesn't make it feel any less true, though.
"We postponed the wedding when Amelia got sick," Cas replies to whatever Naomi said to him. "But if it's truly that important to you that Claire and Jack be a part of a two parent household, then we'll be happy to hold the ceremony as soon as possible."
The second the phone call is over Emma grabs all the information she has on the Trans and starts looking. Whatever went down it's not good, and if Crowley has the tablet it's only a matter of time before he gets Kevin too. She has no idea what'll happen if he gets Kevin to read the tablet, but she's willing to bet it'll be a whole load of extra badness given it's the King of Hell.
Dean doesn't seem overly impressed, but he shrugs it off as worth a look and turns back to Cas. "You wanna go watch a movie before bed?"
But Dean doesn't do more than press a kiss to Castiel's temple and ask him where he's sleeping tonight. He doesn't protest when Castiel opts to sleep in his own room.
"Your mother was a strong warrior," one of them tells her. She's introduced herself as Erin. Apparently she's in charge of graduated initiates. And apparently, as Dad's presumed dead, they're willing to say she's most of the way to initiated. She'll still have to join in on the mankilling, but for now they're more interested in training her. "You will be too."
Emma reaches for a sugar dusted doughnut and Dean winces as she smears the white powder all over the steering wheel, doughnut gripped precariously between thumb and forefinger while her other fingers steer. The sugar gets everywhere, specking her wristband and falling onto her jeans and- Dean's gaze gets caught on the raised section of scarring peeking out from beneath her wristband.
"I'll go," Sam says. "You stay and keep an eye on him. Try not to leave him alone too much in case his behaviour changes. We don't want to be caught off guard if he goes Glenn Close on you."
"They're going to come after her," Sam points out. "When I left, they were already looking for you."
Cas runs his pencil down the paper until he reaches an uncrossed item. "We've ordered the cake, Ellen's offered to provide the venue and drinks for free, Kelly's got a magician she used at a fundraiser to entertain the children and the drunker adults, the officiant is paid for..."
The next 24 hours are a mess. By the time they reach the motel, Dean's already given up keeping up with Emma's growth spurts and put her in one of his own t-shirts and a blanket. The next two hours he spends feeding her again, changing her into a quick succession of outfits and posing her with hastily wrapped presents, birthday cakes and toys. He's more than a little proud of the way he manages to jury rig lighting and furniture to make the scene a little different each time.
“Okay, you too, Rainbow Brite,” Donna said, pointing to Claire. Jody watched as the angsty blonde grinned and ducked into the hug.
“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Dean quipped, but he smiled at the compliment. “Most of it was Sam’s idea….” Cas wanted to argue against Dean’s self-depreciation, but Jack whined into his shoulder, so he carried him to the crib and set him down in the soft blankets. The baby yawned, and pressed his tiny fists to his eyes. Cas started when Dean flicked off the lights, but reached up and turned on the lamp on the shelf. The photographs caught his eye. One was a picture of Kelly; it was blurry, probably a screenshot of a video, but she was smiling lovingly. The other was of himself. He was looking out the window of a diner. The memory made him smile; they had been tracking a small nest of vampires near Boise, and he and Dean had been waiting for Sam to get back from the police station with the most recent reports. He hadn’t known that Dean had taken his picture.
“He’s my kid,” Dean replied. He wasn’t sure if Sam and Cas had checked in as his parents, but he figured it would be better to be vague, have some deniability.
Sam cocked his head and looked at Dean. What did you do? He mouthed at his brother. Dean grimaced and looked away. That bad, then.
“You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know.” Dean wanted to argue, but something inside him didn’t want Cas to stop.
Dean stared at him for a moment before speaking. “Okay, hold on.” He looked as though he wanted to say more, but the words would not come.
“Give us the girl,” Sam said. Kaia realized he had a baby strapped to his chest, which was very odd given the hostage situation going on. If she weren’t so scared, she would have laughed.
Dean was lost for words. What could he possibly say to set this anywhere remotely right? He’d have to think of something for later, because Sam stormed out of the room, leaving Dean with the shrink and the slowly waking baby.
“Right. Cool,” Dean replied, unconcerned with Donatello’s response. “So here's the plan: we open a rift, get Mom out, slam the door before Michael gets through. And all that’s gonna be harder than it sounds.”
“We are!” Velma replied. “We just found out that Scooby’s been named as one of the heirs to a fortune, left to him by an old Southern colonel.” She pulled out a newspaper from nowhere and passed it to Dean. The text was all blurred out, showing just a picture of the aforementioned colonel.
“Be careful,” Ellen called as he walked briskly past the bar and through the kitchen. He pushed open the door and found himself in
“Hey, yeah, I’m right here,” Sam called back, wincing as the use of his own voice shot pain through his temples.
“Hey,” Dean greeted, but before he could say anything else, his brother grabbed him by the neck and smashed his head into the wall. Everything went black.
They fell into a relaxed silence, Dean washing and Cas drying the dishes. After a while, Dean began to hum to himself. He saw Cas smiling softly, his cheeks a bit pink, as he handed him another plate, but decided to ignore it.
Jack began to whine, reminding Sam of the kid's human half, so he set the book down again and carried him to the kitchen.
“I don’t like it either,” Cas said defensively, “but if Donatello’s life ends, then another prophet comes into being and they can finish the translation.”
From then on, Mary fully committed herself to caring for the orphaned children in the camp. She didn’t trust anyone to have her back like Lucy did. Besides, motherhood had always been a distraction for her, from her grief, from her history.
Sam rushed out of the hallway, an irritated look on his face and a baby monitor in his hand. “Dean, you’re gonna wake up–” He froze when he saw Cas on the balcony.
When they turned the corner, they were met with the sound of cans falling to the floor. Dean was staring at Eileen in shock.
“Or I’m gonna put a bullet right between your eyes. I mean, what’d you think was gonna happen here? You come down here with no gun.” He laughed. “Like it matters anyway. You ain’t fast enough.”
“Thankfully, no.” Maybe it was too soon to tell, but Cas couldn’t imagine Jack growing up to be bad, not with the loving family that he and Sam and Dean provided him. “No, he seems to favor his mother.”
“No, it’s just been us.” He watched as the nurse took Jack’s temperature with a thermometer gun and frowned deeply.
“I don’t get it,” Sam said, letting the lid fall closed, “I mean, a ghost that won’t show up on EMF? Doesn’t make any sense.”
Kaia’s heart began to pound. Claire was here. She pushed herself up onto her knees and crawled out of the shelter of sticks that the Other Kaia had built. Did Claire even know that the one who had killed her was just another version of her? It didn’t matter. Claire had come back. After months, sure, but she had come back.
The look of concern on Lucifer’s face enraged Cas beyond comprehension, but he was rightfully worried. Cas looked away.
“Oh, buddy, it’s okay, I’m right here,” Dean whispered, bringing him against his chest. “I’ve got you. I’m not going anywhere.”
“His powers must come into the greatest effect when he’s in pain,” Cas said, answering Sam’s question before he could even finish.
“Okay.” Sam could understand that. It’s not like he went around talking about what happened in the cage with Lucifer.
Cas nodded, and joined Dean in the front of the group, leading the band of refugees back to the portal.
Though Sam’s morals were admirable, morals were for times of peace. This was a time of war. Cas strode out of the room. They needed the spell, so he’d get the spell.
“Same here.” Lucifer leaned forward in a conversational manner, as though he hadn’t been the one to stab Cas in the back last time they’d interacted. Although, upon further observation, it seemed that Lucifer was… tired?
Sam sat back down in the passenger seat of the Impala, ignoring the irritated expression on Dean’s face as he bounced Jack on his knee. He figured they shouldn’t bring the baby onto this crime scene with them, since this one was crawling with cops.
They burst into the emergency room with Jack limp in Cas’ arms, having fallen asleep out of pure exhaustion.
“Just think about it– we do the same thing. We go to spooky places, we solve mysteries, we fight ghosts.”
An entry in the journal caught Sam’s eye. “Yeah, there is. According to Dad’s journal, Jasper is home to its very own Gate to Hell.” Dean looked at him with an expression that read ‘are you fucking kidding me?’ “It gets better.”
“Nothing.” Cas stepped toward him. “I took it. And if I hadn’t acted, we would still be sitting around and talking about what to do next. We would be wasting time. And it’s time we don’t have, Dean, I told you, war is coming.” The certainty in Cas’ voice sent chills down Dean’s spine. He looked away. “And I did what soldiers do. We needed the spell to open the rift, and I got it.”
Dean had no time to process that information before his foe delivered a powerful kick to his chest, sending him flying into the dirt. He scrambled to his feet, despite his aching spine. “Cool!” So if he just got a hold of the sword, easy peasy.
“Yeah, let me show you to his room,” Dean replied, placing a hand on Cas’ back. Relief flooded through Cas. He’d hardly gotten back to Earth, and it seemed that he was still a part of the Winchesters lives, despite everything that had happened between them before his death. His heart dropped when he thought of that.
“I need to tell Sam,” Dean said, rising from his chair. He stopped when Cas grabbed onto his sleeve.
“There,” Cas gasped. He groaned as Gabriel quickened his pace, half-dragging him across the dead leaves. He felt his head begin to go fuzzy. Suddenly, Gabriel stopped in front of the door and pounded on it. Cas’ head throbbed harder and more painfully every time Gabriel’s fist connected with the metal.
Alex looked up from sweeping broken glass. Patience was standing still, her dustpan held over the garbage can. She looked over at Donna, who was duct-taping plastic sheets over the windows. She grinned at her, and the both began to laugh.
“I’ve seen it, too,” Sam replied softly, “what he really looks like behind… behind whatever vessel. It….” He didn’t want to revisit these memories, but Rowena looked so helpless. And seeing that from probably the most powerful witch on the planet frightened Sam more than he cared to admit. “Yeah, it still keeps me up at night.” He turned away from Rowena to stare out the windshield.
“That’s ectoplasm,” Sam said, walking over and dipping his fingers into the slimy liquid. “It gets left behind by ghosts.”
“That’s fine,” Dean replied. To his slight surprise, he meant it. “Just… don’t disappear. That’s all I ask. You don’t have to stay here. You can go live with the apocalypse-world refugees. I get it, they… they’re more family to you than we are.” Mary looked away. “I get it, truly. I’ve found my own family over the years. But just… visit us every once in a while. Come see Jack. Stay in our lives.”
His hands trembled as he wrapped one arm under Cas’ shoulders and the other under his legs. With great effort, he lifted the lifeless angel from the ground, and carried him into the dining room, laying him gently on the table. He looked around, not daring to let his eyes rest on his friend’s corpse for any length of time. Hanging over the back of a chair was a large white sheet. He took the sheet and draped it over Cas’ body, like a curtain closing at the end of a play, like finality, like permanence.
Up in the offices of Heaven, Dean waited patiently. He lifted his head when he heard the sound of high heels echoing through the halls.
“Okay, buddy,” he whispered, wrapping Jack in the blanket. “Do you want to hear about angels?” The baby blinked sleepily at him. “Angels work for God, or at least, most of them do. Some of them rebelled, like your father, Lucifer. But not all the ones who rebelled are bad. Castiel rebelled too, and he’s… he was the best angel.” Sam sighed. “He was our friend. He was like a brother to me.” Jack almost seemed to understand, in the way he was looking at Sam. “Cas was supposed to be your dad,” Sam whispered, “And me and Dean, we would’ve been your uncles, I guess.” He didn’t think Dean would get demoted to uncle status if Cas were around, but he didn’t need to get into the strange and complicated relationship between the dead angel and his brother with a baby. “But I guess we’ll just have to take turns being your dads.”
Mariana sighed. “A long time ago, back when there was still a lot of mining up in the pass, there was a small town of miners and their families who ran one of the mineshafts up there.
Alex and Patience finished clearing the floors while Jody set the table and microwaved leftovers. They were digging into their meal when Claire came downstairs, her eyes still red and puffy. She offered the ladies at the table a small smile, and slid into the chair next to Alex. She knocked her knee against Claire’s and passed her the tupperware full of mashed potatoes.
“Is still asleep, perfectly safe, yada yada yada. I’ve got the prophet all trussed up in your sex dungeon, everything’s fine.”
But no, this place may have been an old growth forest, but it was bathed in blueish light and covered in lush green moss.
He stopped, taking in his surroundings, looking for movement. All of a sudden, he turned to see a pair of headlights coming at him, and he lept to the side before the van could run him over. The tires screeched as the van raced out of the parking lot, leaving Dean panting on the asphalt. He jogged back inside to see Jody and Patience still sitting in the hallway.
“Well, I thought Death knew everything,” he replied. He was not going to be manhandled by the being who had caused him so much grief before.
“Dumah,” Cas greeted, “thank you for agreeing to meet with me. This is a matter of great urgency. I need help, with Jack.”
It showed him Dean’s look of betrayal as he left him in a ring of holy fire. It showed him the look of betrayal on Dean’s face as Cas knocked his hand away, choosing to stay in Purgatory.
“Is that my boy?” Lucifer asked. Sam could hear his feet thudding down the stairs. He didn’t dare turn around, trying desperately to think of how to get Jack out of the Devil’s reach.
He sighed. He knew he shouldn’t resent those kids for latching onto his mom. They certainly needed her more than he did.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Cas sighed. Dean and his westerns. Thankfully he remembered which one Tombstone was. “The one with the guns and tuberculosis.” He lowered his voice in an imitation of the actor from the movie. “‘I’m your Huckleberry.’”
“Howdy, boys,” the demon drawled, waving a hand. It took everything Sam had not to drop Jack as he felt his breath snatched from his throat. Jack screamed louder, tears streaming down his face, as Sam dropped to his knees, trying to lay the baby down before he passed out and dropped him. He could vaguely hear the demon talking softly to Jack, but his pulse was pounding in his ears, so loud he couldn’t hear anything. All of a sudden, his throat was released; he gasped air into his lungs, and looked around. The demon was gone, and so was the portal to Hell. Jack was still crying, but not nearly so hard as he had been a moment ago. Sam scooped him up and cradled him to his chest.
Cas laughed at him, and Dean couldn’t help but smile, despite his irritation with the condition of the road. He reached a hand out, laying it palm-up on the seat. Cas took his hand, and held onto it until they reached Fairbanks, not even letting go when he changed the cassette tape to Lover, then the Led Zepplin mixtape, then 1989. They were three songs in when Dean pulled into a gas station near the university. They walked into the gas station to pick up snacks, their shoulders bumping lightly until Cas wandered off to look at a collection of brochures.
Dean carried Jack out of the Mills’ wrecked house. The kid had (begrudgingly) returned Grumpy Cat to its rightful owner, and was now chewing on the lapel of Dean’s jacket.
“Sam,” Dean whispered, entering the room, “the cold spot, fritzing out… that was a ghost– our kind of ghost.”
She bounced the baby in her arms, wondering if he should even be in here. Kaia had said that the kid’s name was Jack, and that he was the Winchesters’ kid. Claire had called Castiel, but he said he was busy with a case. So, Patience was on babysitting duty. She had babysat the neighborhood children before, so she was the most qualified of the girls, but she wished she could be of more use to the hunt.
The ground rumbled again, briefly drowning out Jack’s cries. Yep, they were definitely going to die.
“He’s your nephew by dear little Luci, and a pretty awesome kid at that.” Sam turned to see Gabriel entering the room.
He turned to see a figure that looked exactly like him– but no, he had never smiled like that before, with such malice and glee. It frightened him.
Rowena sighed with exasperation. “Oh, years ago, the Grand Coven cast a binding spell limiting aspects of my magic.” She grimaced. “There’s a page in the Grimoire that may help.”
Dean ran down the hall to Sam’s room, heart in his throat. He skidded to a stop, and pounded on the door.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you,” Cas whispered, sitting up and clutching Jack against his chest. He would need to feed him soon, but for the moment, he wanted to keep holding his child.
The archangel laughed hollowly. “You think Luci really got me? Please. He may have taught me the art of the trickster, but I perfected it.”
“Just woke up from a rather long and peaceful nap,” came Gabriel’s voice from behind the angel and his brother.
She looked away, picking at the edge of the sheet with fingernails painted with chipped black polish. “Drugs.”
“Okay,” Dean said softly. Sam was right, but he didn’t want to talk about it in front of the shrink.
He couldn’t be dead. He shouldn’t be. He deserved better. He deserved to meet this kid that he fought for, he deserved to come back to the bunker with him and Sam, so that they could be a family again. Dean didn’t care that Cas had left them, betrayed them, run away from them, he just wanted him back.
The angel’s blue eyes were dull and full of fear. “Dean, Michael– other Michael– he’s trying to get through. He wants to conquer our world.”
Sam could feel the irritation emanating off of Dean. “Why are you in Wyoming?” he asked, more pointedly.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbled, taking a roll of medical tape and ripping off a long strip with his teeth. He taped the bandage over the wound, then tossed the roll aside.
Mary spoke up in an attempt to clear the awkward silence. “Well, anyway, I hope he’s got someone who makes him happy.”
“She was.” James paused. “At least, I felt like she was. After. I always believed in her powers. I had total faith in them. But….” He took a deep breath. “They were wrong.”
Sam clutched the pendulum in his hands. He couldn’t dwell on the people who were gone. If he started doing that, he’d never get going on this Lucifer business.
“There’ll be more of them coming,” Cas urged as he cut the sleeves of Gabriel’s jacket. The archangel shook out his arms gratefully.
The rest of the drive was a blur. He slowed when he reached the road in front of the church. There, by the payphone, was a figure in a beige trench coat, his back to the road. Dean parked the car in the middle of the road, not bothering to find a proper space at this hour.
“It would have blown this place sky high,” Rowena explained. “But if I could get to him… somewhere away from here….”
Surely Sam and Dean would understand? They had their own found family; Castiel, the witch, the archangel, the nephilim. They didn’t need her anymore. Not like these children did.
“Sam, we will deal with it. Right now, we need to help Cas get better.” He couldn’t remember the last time the angel had been so badly injured. It worried him.
Cas despised the way it flaunted his body, but decided to move on to more pressing issues. “What is this place?”
“I’ll do it for my son. I’ll even stay asleep this time. Just take me.” He closed his eyes, preparing for the worst. He wished he could send a prayer to Dean.
“Hey, little guy,” he cooed, pulling a clean diaper from the box on the floor next to the desk, “I know you don’t remember him, but that’s Cas. Castiel. He’s an angel. Yeah, he watched over your mom while she carried you in her tummy.” Jack made a gurgling noise at this. “Yeah, you used to be in your mom’s tummy. Her name was Kelly. She loves you very much. So does Cas.” He wondered where Cas was– he figured angels wouldn’t go to Heaven in the afterlife, since that’s where they were in life. Maybe angels didn’t have an afterlife.
“Alright, alright. I’m coming. I’ll be, like three hours or something.” It was really two and a half, but Claire wanted to stop at the memorial shrine she’d made for Kaia, hidden in a small park not far from the house. She hated that there was no headstone for her, and though the shrine wasn’t much, just a stack of rounded stones and some fake silk flowers, it was better than nothing.
Sam looked over at Dean. They had been silent for most of the drive toward Lebanon, so that Jack would sleep through it. Thankfully he hadn’t been too upset about being left alone in the car.
Dean nodded his approval, though his mind was on the rest of the wraith, still out and able to kill. “All right, well, that thing might come back, so…”
“Yeah, but at least you had a relationship with Mom. I mean, who would she always call? Who did she look to for everything?”
The sun (was it the sun? Dean had meant to ask Cas about that) had taken on a more orange hue, so they packed up their fishing gear and drove back to the cabin, neither noticing how deep in thought the other was. In silence, they unloaded the gear in the garage and headed into the cabin. Dean was not in the mood to cook tonight, but hey, this was Heaven, so there was a box of delivery pizza ready for them on the table. They ate in silence for a while before Dean spoke up.
Dean nodded, although whether it was to himself or to his fallen friend he could not be sure, and went upstairs to Jack.
A car horn caught their attention. The girls watched as a tall black truck with a license plate reading “D-TRAIN” pulled up next to Patience’s Jeep.
“I got Jody to put out an APB on Kaia,” Sam said, hanging up his cell, “but we gotta find her fast.”
When he heard the door open and close again, he didn’t look away from the portal. “You cleared the grocery store out of candy yet, Gabe?”
The woman stared at them incredulously, though Sam wasn’t sure if that was due to the baby strapped to Dean’s chest or Sam’s accusation that she did not recognize her own neighbor. “I’ve lived next to Erica for six years. I watered her plants every time she and Wes took vacation. I’m certain it was her.”
When their eyes met, it felt like a dam breaking. A sob erupted from his chest, and he pulled Eileen into his arms. She tucked her head under his chin, sighing against his chest.
“This girl, was she walking in a straight path?” Cas asked. Dean frowned. What was he getting on about?
John nodded and cleared his throat. “Likewise.” He set the plate of burgers down and sat at Dean’s left side. Cas sat at his right, directly across from John at the little square table.
Dean wet his lips, too distracted by the idea of Dodge City to process the insult, then stood and began to make his way down the hall, towards the weapons room. Before he left the room, he turned and smiled at Sam and Cas. “Two salty hunters, one half-angel baby, and one dude who just came back from the dead. Again. Team Free Will 2.0!” He clapped his hands together. “Here we go!”
“You wanna dwell on the past? I don’t.” Lucifer leaned forward. “I’m not myself anyway. What am I gonna do? Okay?” Cas supposed he had a point. “Look, it’s time to save the world. Be the heroic Castiel instead of the butt of Heaven’s joke.”
“Probably bolted,” Claire said. She looked up at the glowing doorway on the upper deck, then turned to Jody. “Is that the door?”
“Yes, we can. Cas said he’s weak, we can set this on the back burner. Right now, we need to make sure we don’t lose Cas again, and we need to get Mom back.”
Sam turned to Dean. “I don’t know what happened, man. We were setting up the spell and he just… snapped.”
When she returned, her face was grim. So, nothing from the sheriff. “You get anything from the traffic cam?” she asked.
The dungeon door creaked as it swung open. Cas was adjusting the lapels of his coat, and Donatello sat unconscious in his trusses behind him.
There came a squelching sound from the far wall. Dean whirled around. Black liquid was pouring out of the wall. The door banged open, and Chuck burst in, power radiating off of him.
“Last time Gabe pulled this stunt we just had to play our parts, so we probably just have to do the same this time.” He turned back towards the table. “The Gang, they’re about to get a mystery.”
Now, his father was sitting in the passenger seat, glancing between the road and Dean. It made his skin itch, like he’d done something wrong.
Sam’s blood ran ice cold, the hair on the back of his neck raising. He looked up at Rowena, who was staring at him with barely restrained fear. His eyes darted to Jack, who remained blissfully unaware of the dangerous situation.
Dean shrugged. “It’s a vacation.” He set his duffel on the ground and wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist. “We deserve a bit of luxury this time around.”
At that moment, Dean and Castiel burst into the room. Dean stopped when he saw his father pinned to the wall, but Castiel made a beeline for his son.
“Nephilim are powerful. Very powerful. He probably feels threatened.” He looked around the room. Dean really had cleaned it up. No one could ever guess that John Winchester had been murdered here.
“You gotta get out of this dark place, man,” Dean said quietly. “You know, whatever’s going on in your head….”
“Who’s staying behind with Jack?” Cas asked hesitantly. Though he wanted to spend time with Jack, he didn’t like the idea of missing out on a hunt with the brothers when he had only just gotten back.
“Look,” Sam said as soon as they were outside, “Kaia, I’m sure this is a lot.” He sighed. “But we need you, okay? My brother and I, our mother is trapped in another world–” he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, and Kaia recognized it as one of her drawings “–and if you can guide Jack to it–” he gestured to the baby on his chest “–then he can open a door–”
“Exactly.” Jack cooed at her, as though he were contributing to the conversation. “Now I’m– I’m worried the girls will damage the book, and you’re worried about the awful things they’ll do with it, so… let’s help each other, shall we?”
Dean cleared his throat, then held out his arm. “Uh, no, no problem. Um. But my, uh, my friend here, he’s allergic to most metals, and with such limited medical supplies out here….”
They were almost there. All they needed were the hearts, and they’d be able to get Mom back. Anticipation crawled up his chest, making his heart race.
Sam didn’t like the idea of that, but he knew it was the most reasonable course of action. “I think you may be right.” He cleared his throat. “Take my car. Dean will be here soon, I won’t need it.”
The events of the day before suddenly came rushing back to him. Chuck’s betrayal, Lucifer, Jack’s grace.
Cas managed to keep his composure as his blood boiled. How dare this man insult Dean Winchester, the Righteous Man, like this?
“My grandma said she was psychic, but she’s a fraud,” she tried to correct Jody. “She doesn’t care about me, she ditched me. Me and Dad, right after Mom died.”
Sam sipped at a paper cup of water, his hand shaking. Maybe going undercover as patients right after losing Mom and Cas wasn’t the best idea. He felt distracted, thrown off his rhythm. He glanced around the room, his eyes landing on a sign roped across the stairway reading ‘private: do not enter.’ If anything was amiss about the place, it would be through there.
Cas shivered again, Dean grabbed the blanket folded at the end of the mattress and laid it gently over the angel. He groaned as the rough material caught on the bandage.
Cas heard birds chirping, and grass beneath him. He rolled onto his back, and opened his eyes. The sun shone in his eyes so bright it hurt. He pushed himself to his feet, running his hand along the grass around him. It was real. It was real, and he was on Earth. He glanced down at himself, in the same vessel he’d died in. But he wasn’t on a lake shore in Washington, where he’s been stabbed.
Though every nerve in his body screamed at him to stay put, he ran back out of the room towards the library. He had to help Rowena, he had to make sure his brother and Cas got through safely.
“Okay, I think that’s everything,” he announced when he heard Donatello approaching him from behind.
They grabbed their baggage, but decided not to bother with the crib. They needed to get out of there fast. As they headed out to the parking lot, Sam swore.
“You two have always been a pain in my ass, you know that?” Cas tried to think of a way to get away from Chuck. “You, Castiel, you must have come off the factory line with a crack in your chassis. You never do what you’re told. Too much heart.” Cas tried to block his words out.
Jody inhaled deeply, fear apparent in her eyes. She probably assumed that Claire would be running off to fight this thing alone now.
Sam looked around the library with dismay. There were spell ingredients and torn up books scattered across the floor, and many of the chairs in the library and war room were overturned. His heart sank. Many of those materials were the last of their stock, and now they were useless. And if Donatello had, for whatever reason, gone dark side, then that was another huge wrench in their plans to get Mom back.
Gabriel had taken up residence in what was formerly the “Dean Cave,” eating sweets and watching cartoons and porn all day and night on a large flat screen TV that Cas was almost certain he had stolen when they had sent him on a grocery run (he had not been allowed to buy groceries since, as he had taken it upon himself to buy only candy and pastries and soda).
“Your daughter is psychic,” Jody said, stepping toward the fighting pair. “That’s why the wraith’s coming after her.”
Claire took the keys out of the ignition and did her best to ignore Jody’s glare as she walked around to the passenger side. Kaia stirred as she opened the door.
Cas nodded. He stooped down to lay a gentle kiss on Jack’s forehead, then walked swiftly out of the room. Sam sank into a chair next to the bed. It was an adult sized bed, and it looked absolutely giant compared to the infant lying in it. He wished that Dean would hurry up and get there soon.
“Da! Da! Da!” Jack yelled, reaching toward the counter. Dean handed him a spatula, which he immediately threw on the floor. “Sumbish!”
“It didn’t do anything to me,” Donatello cried, “I translated the tablet. All of it! I saw the power of God! And it’s all up here.” He scowled. “And you want to take it from me.”
“I’ll return to the house in the morning,” Cosgood Creeps announced, “to find out which of you remain… if any.” He let out a classic cartoon evil laugh, and swept out of the room.
“You killed her!” Claire kept shouting, her voice beginning to grow huskier with the effort. “You killed her, and I couldn’t even tell her that I loved her!”
A knock sounded on the door. She frowned. Had Alex invited someone over without telling her? But no, she was on shift at the hospital.
They stood shoulder to shoulder as Cas chanted the summoning incantation. “Zoh nuh ray nuh rah juh….” Dean zoned out for the rest. He didn’t understand Enochian, and honestly, he didn’t care to learn more than was absolutely necessary; proper pronunciation was a bitch.
“That is probably the stupidest thing you could have done,” Dean said, his voice hard. What would Heaven do to Cas when he showed up? What would they do to Jack? Surely Heaven wanted him dead.
“It’s okay,” Claire whispered, running a hand over Kaia’s knotted hair. It felt like it was all one giant mat. They’d probably need to cut it. “You’re safe now. You’re safe now.”
“Wait.” An idea had struck Kaia. “If I can help Jack open a door, then we can get out of here.” As much as she didn’t want to go to the Bad Place, she knew she had a higher chance of survival there than here.
“I know we spent all that time together, off-world, but… I’m lonely. I want to create something new. With you.”
Dean couldn’t help but remember him, slumped over in a chair, dead at the hands of that reaper, April.
Dean knew that Cas could see right through his nonchalant facade, could see that his thoughts were on more distressing subjects, but for the moment he let it go. “Hmm, well, I’m glad you did bring me. It’s a lovely drive.”
Kaia turned to her, glaring suspiciously. Claire smirked at her. The baby just sat on the bed and cooed. She turned back to the bag of clothing and started pulling on a sweatshirt.
The ground rumbled again, and the Bad Place melted into the Apocalypse World. She saw the spikes, the horrible wasteland. She saw the ruins of a wooden church, a woman hiding in a corner.
Before either of the brothers could react, Fred threw himself at the stranger, bringing them both to the ground in a tangle of arms and legs and ascots and… trench coats? The strange figure managed to get tangled in a ratty curtain and fell to the floor as Fred jumped back.
A roar in the distance answered their question. Dean glanced down, taking in all the bones scattered around them. That confirmed it.
From somewhere far away, a voice drifted to Kaia. But… no. She had to still be dreaming. She only heard that voice in dreams, now.
“Alright, this is supposed to be the best room in the joint,” Dean declared as they carried their luggage and a sleeping Jack in his carrier down the hall.
“Seriously?” Patience refused to take her eyes off of Kaia as she heard the squelching sounds of Alex messing with the corpse. Besides, it kind of sounded like dreamwalking wasn’t too dissimilar to being psychic.
All of a sudden, the phone rang. He picked it up, and wiped away tears with his sleeve before answering. “Hey, what’s up?”
Dean scowled, then turned to the crowd of actual cartoon characters. “All right, prepmeister Fred, what’s your plan?”
Sam sighed, and closed the laptop. “No, nothing. Things are quiet, at least at the moment. Quiet enough that I think I’m gonna turn in for the night.” He stood from the table and nodded to Cas. “Good to have you back, man.” Cas nodded to him in return before he left the room, baby monitor in hand. Dean could have sworn it was his turn with the monitor tonight, but he wasn't going to complain if his brother wanted to be woken up at four in the morning.
Sam pulled on the plunger. Pain shot through his body like fire engulfing him. He shut his eyes and screamed, but didn’t stop until he heard the ringing of grace in the syringe.
“I, uh. Think it’s time we told her and… and Dad about us.” Dean looked up at Cas to gauge his reaction.
The receptionist punched a button on the phone, and barked some sort of number code into the receiver. “What’s the kid’s name, and how old is he?”
“Not yet. We’re trying to get my mom back from an alternate universe. Long story, and I’ll explain it all when you get to the bunker– the bunker, which is the safest possible place for you to hide from Lucifer until we can kill him.”
Dean nodded. Listening to them talking and laughing at the table, he could almost forget how traumatized they all were. “Okay, well you kids eat up. Gotta get big and strong.” He cooked a few more sandwiches so the kids could have seconds, then turned off the stove. He turned to see Mary watching him with a tearful smile.
“Do you want to hold him?” Cas nodded mutely. “Okay, just support his back so he doesn’t fall backwards.” Dean gently placed Jack in Cas’ arms, their shoulders brushing as he did so. Cas let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding as Jack smiled up at him.
Dean looked at Jody, his confused expression mirrored in hers. “Okay,” he said, “this woman you’re describing, that walked out on her family, that’s not who Missouri was at all.” He didn’t want to be angry with this poor scared girl, but he would not allow her to drag Missouri’s name through the mud.
But she wasn’t dead. Had Lucifer killed her when they made it to the other side? It was likely, but not certain. She could still be alive. When the kid was old enough, when he had control of his powers, he could open up another portal, and they could get her back. But would she last that long?
Sam sat in the library, watching Jack crawl around with a toy car. Gabriel had gone to take a shower. He was probably going to use up all the hot water.
Before she could get back to her feet, she heard a gunshot. Blue liquid poured from the monster’s leg. Jody. The monster turned toward her, but Claire was up and stabbing up through its chin before it could do anything else. It screeched and gagged up more blue liquid before falling limply to the concrete. She pulled the knife out with a satisfying squish, and turned to Kaia and the baby.
Sam let out a deep breath as he walked away from the kitchen. He didn’t like lying to Dean, again, but he and Rowena needed to move now. Rowena had tracked Lucifer to the throne room, but he had left just a few minutes ago. If there was ever a time to set a trap for the Devil, this was it.
What the fuck? “You’re insane.” Sam finished cutting her loose and lifted her to her feet. Her knees felt weak, but she managed to stand on her own.
“You remember how I pulled a gun on him.” He did. “I was terrified. There was this man, coming at me with a sword drawn, looking ready to kill.” She huffed a soft laugh. “Did you see his face when you walked into the room?”
When they reached the kitchen, Dean pulled open the fridge and Cas sat at the table. Despite him saying that he didn’t really want one, he grabbed a bottle for Cas, setting it gently in front of him as he sat down. Cas didn’t take it, but that didn’t matter.
Missouri opened her eyes to look at Jody. “Yes he does.” She trailed her hand over a spot of blood on the table, grief written on her face. She moaned softly, her face scrunching up into a more anguished expression.
He headed back to the kitchen and opened the pantry, eyeing the food on the shelves. Then he pulled the flour, sugar, and chocolate chips down. Stress baking. That was what he was reduced to these days. How domestic.
“You?” Dean quipped, “doing magic?” He knew he should take it easy on the guy, but he’d lost too many friends lately. He didn’t have the energy for politeness.
Dean looked over at Cas, hoping his expression was a bit more schooled than Cas’ clearly distressed one. He really didn’t want to do any hunts anymore, but these kids looked like they needed the help. Cas nodded subtly. Apparently they were going to help these girls.
Alex leaned against the doorframe of Patience’s– or rather, Claire’s– room, watching her fold clothes and tuck them into her duffel bag.
The next morning, they got up late, stopped at a drive through coffee stand (Dean couldn’t believe how many drive through coffee places there were in such a sparsely populated state), and drove the two and a half hours south to the park. Despite it being only mid September, there were a few inches of snow on the ground, with red shrubs peeking from underneath.
“Welcome to the Museum of the North, can I get you folks checked in?” came a sunny voice from the reception desk. Dean turned to see…
“Yep,” Dean replied, looking smug– or at least, Cas assumed he looked smug. Cartoon emotions were harder to decipher.
Claire slammed the door to the motel room, flopped face-first onto the bed, and screamed into the pillow.
Tears pricked at Mary’s eyes, but quickly dissipated as a thought hit her. “Dean Henry Winchester, did you come here by yourself?”
Dean smiled, not saying a word, then turned back to his cooking. Jack squirmed in his chair, whining, so Cas picked him up. The weight in his arms felt different. Heavier.
“Perhaps we should turn to those with more cartoon expertise,” Cas suggested, gesturing to the man who appeared to be the leader of the “gang.” If this was a child’s cartoon, perhaps the children were better equipped for it.
Dean sat next to him at the table and frowned at the photograph on the screen. “Who’s driving?” he asked, and tapped at some keys before getting an answer. Jack watched with rapt attention, drooling all over his crumb-crusted fingers.
“Look,” he drawled, turning to Dean, “Baby brother. Or, well, I guess not that much of a baby.” He walked toward Dean, and pointed the gun at the closed door, despite Dr. Vallens screaming at him to stop. “Like shooting hunters in a barrel,” he joked. Dean could hear Sam’s footsteps outside the office.
He nodded, and took Gabriel and Rowena’s hands. A flap of his wings, and they were in a throne room made of dull stone with gothic arched ceilings. A throne sat on a raised dias on one side of the room.
“Sounds good,” Sam agreed immediately, handing Jack off to Cas and then leaving the kitchen. Eileen followed him, stopping by the sink to drop off her dirty plate. Cas continued to feed Jack off of Sam’s plate.
Jack blinked slowly, succumbing to sleep. Sam leaned back, thankful for the break. Maybe he’d take a nap, too.
“Damn. Well, you’re back on dad duty, I’m making a beer run.” He heard Sam scoff behind him as he set Jack and his toys down on a blanket and walked swiftly out of the room, grabbing his keys on the way out. Maybe his brother would allow himself a break to play with the kid or something. Jack was in a good mood today, sitting up on his chubby legs like a little Buddha statue. That is, if Buddha wore green and blue striped onesies.
“Samuel, you think I’d stoop so low as to be any ordinary hellspawn?” She waved a hand, and a crown formed on her head out of black smoke. It was intricate, made of black metal and adorned with carved obsidian and rubies. “I’m the queen, my dear lad.”
“Ah, shrinks,” Dean quipped from the driver’s seat as he read the file that Sam had handed him, listing a therapist as the only tie between the two victims, “snake oil for the mind.”
Dean opened his mouth, then closed it again. He had no idea what to say to that. He didn’t know how to explain to Cas how he feared the days beyond Jack’s babyhood, when the hard parenting began. Would he be like John? Obsessed and hunt-hardened? He couldn’t picture it, but the thought frightened him anyway.
Dean sighed. Leave it to Jody to knock down his walls as if they were made of paper. “Terrible. I lost my mom and my best friend and got a kid dumped on me in one day.”
“Are there any other parts to the story that you told the campers that might help us find her?” Dean asked.
The figure turned toward her. It wasn’t Dean. In the golden lamplight, his eyes flashed yellow. In his hand, an angel blade gleamed.
“Dean,” Sam said sternly, “if you and I are gonna do this, keep Jack on the right side of things, then we have to be on the same page.”
Jody called after Patience, but Dean didn’t want to listen to her try to adopt another wayward girl. Sure, she and her girls had found each other through hunting, and they were happy together, but they were the one-in-a-million exception to the rule. Suddenly, he thought of Jack. His kid.
Lucifer banged his hands on the table. “It’s bad enough the Winchesters were babysitting my son,” he bemoaned, “but now he’s sick? With Heaven, Hell, and everything in between wanting him dead?”
Sam sat at the library table across from the somehow-still-alive archangel, sizing him up. Sure, the guy had supposedly died for him and his brother in their Apocalypse efforts, but looking at him now, he felt like he could hear that god-awful Asia song playing again.
“Jack is going to be fine,” the doctor said. Sam fell back into the chair, and heard Dean sigh in relief beside him.
Dumah’s face contorted into a vicious smile. “You didn’t really think Heaven could spare an angel to meet with a rebel like you? After all you did with the fall?”
“Well, I mean, it’s Alaska,” Rori piped up. “People have died of all sorts of things, especially in the gold rush eras.”
“I don’t know, man,” he countered, “I mean, babies are easy. You feed ‘em, change ‘em, sing ‘em to sleep, and you’re golden.”
“Yeah, I do, give me a sec.” Sam went down to his room to get his pendulum out of an enchanted lockbox. It was made of obsidian, carved into a glossy point. Eileen had given it to him the last time they’d seen each other. She’d promised to teach him some Irish tracking spells. She never got the chance.
“They’re gone?” Donna was talking to Jody, who looked a bit shaken. Alex shot at one of the monsters as it tried to squeeze its way around the barricade.
Mary inhaled deeply. “I’m going to leave with the kids tomorrow morning. I can’t… I can’t be here right now.”
When they got back to the kitchen, Cas sat at the table while Dean turned off the oven and pulled the cookies out. The tantalizing smell wafted throughout the kitchen. Dean grabbed two, wincing at the heat, and all but threw them down the cookies at Cas’ spot and the spot next to his.
“Release me.” The Empty just glared. He stepped closer, so that they were chest to chest, and repeated himself. “Release me.”
“Hey!” She seriously just… left this kid? And why did the kid look familiar? Claire grabbed the kid and raced after Kaia. She was fast, especially for someone reported to have a concussion.
“Claire,” she whispered back. She slid her hand onto her shoulder, under the hem of her shirt, running her fingers over the raised scar of the ghoul bite. She smiled. “It’s you. You’re here.”
Sam felt the blood drain from his face. While he no longer had the majority of his memories from the Cage, he knew the effects of seeing such horrible things. He remembered Lucifer’s face. Being anywhere near the Devil made his heart race uncontrollably.
Alex stared at her for a moment before looking down at her paperwork again. Claire looked guilty. Maybe she was being a little bit hard on her.
Dean was too preoccupied with the warriors wardrobe to say anything back. He couldn’t help it, he laughed out loud.
Dean was on a dock, a fishing pole in his hand and a warm breeze blowing ripples across the water. Vaguely, he knew he was dreaming, but he felt at peace anyway.
His son was sitting in his high chair, driving a toy car across the tray and making tiny engine noises with his mouth. Cas’ heartstrings tugged, and he felt tears pricking his eyes. He couldn’t believe how much he loved his son. It felt so much more acute now.
Slowly, Dean stood, leaving his shotgun on the ground by the Sarge. He raised his hands up to shoulder height and glared at the ghoul.
“Claire, please, wait!” She froze when she entered the room with the portal. The tear was thinner, dimmer, crackled less enthusiastically. “Oh, hell.”
Dean shook his head. “Nah, he said he’s over trying to be normal. He’s probably with Eileen, taking out vamp nests every other day.”
They drove to the top of the hill, where a variety of large buildings perched, one with a huge satellite on top. The museum itself was very oddly shaped, curved with a point like the Sydney Opera House, but with white tiling on the sides that reminded Dean of an igloo.
“Yeah.” He knew that Dean had just as little hope as he did, but honestly, it made him feel just a little bit better, knowing that he and his brother were in the same boat on this.
“You said you wanted to give this a shot. Well, here we go. He won’t even admit that Mom’s dead. Won’t even admit it.”
They were almost there. Just a few yards to go. They stopped in front of the rift. It had grown even thinner.
He placed the last of the logs and made his way into the house and upstairs, careful not to disturb Dean as he rocked Jack in his arms.
As soon as the first monster appeared, Donna pulled the trigger. The explosion made Patience flinch. She and Jody both shot repeatedly until the creature fell to the floor, writhing.
“Anyway.” She turned away, uncomfortable with the vulnerability that Claire was showing. “I’m guessing you didn’t crash my job for a heart-to-heart. What do you want?” She smiled at Claire. She didn’t want to pick a fight, not when she’d just gotten back.
Irritation flashed through Dean’s head. He folded his arms. “Oh, okay, well, please, tell me, what’s going on here?”
He listened to Lucifer squabbling with one of the guard demons in the other cell. Would the archangel ever just shut up?
“Seal of Solomon, check!” he said gleefully, shoving it into Sam’s hand and pushing past him to get to the frankly ridiculous collection of sugary cereals.
“The tracking spell isn’t like GPS,” Rowena replied. “The book’s not moving, and it’s in this general area. We’ll need to speak to the yokels.”
Dean poured the egg mixture into the pan and let it sizzle for a moment before answering. “He’s in the library with Rowena and Gabriel, searching for a way to either kill Lucifer or pop him back into the Cage.”
She leaned her head back against the headrest and sighed. Jody had been understanding enough to let her scout it out on her own, but made her promise to call with the full report. Reluctantly, Claire dug out her phone and called Jody.
“So our ghoul ate some Old West gunfighter and stole his face?” he said, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. He handed Sam a shotgun, chuckling to himself.
“He is a child,” Cas replied firmly, “and he requires a loving environment. As for his potential, having seen it firsthand, they know that it needs to be carefully channeled.”
“Yeah,” Cas sighed, “a very old thing.” He stood. “I thought they had gone extinct during the flood.”
“Hey, Gabriel,” Sam said slowly. He gingerly sat himself next to the archangel on the couch. Jack was napping contently in his uncle’s arms.
“All right,” Jody said, “anything gets in here, take it down.” She reloaded her handgun with a sharp click.
“Sorry to break up the loving reunion, but I do have some rather important information to share.” She turned toward Eileen so that she could read her lips. “Lucifer is back in Hell. I’d rather he didn’t stay down there too long, cause too much trouble. I’m afraid, Samuel, that we need to act now.”
“Yeah,” Sam said, sighing. “Fair enough.” He tried to will himself to just be happy, just for now, for Cas and for his brother. But somehow, Cas’ return only seemed to highlight his mom’s absence.
“Yes. Look, you protected my son. He trusts you. If you can convince him to be on our team, I think the combined power of the three of us can drive Michael back. I’m telling you, this guy is not the same Michael that we knew. He’s much more powerful.”
“Fine, fine,” Rowena replied, turning to pour herself another glass. “Speaking of… where is my son?”
And, according to Cas, he was a good dad. Somehow, that calmed some of the fears gnawing at his stomach.
Sam sighed. “Gabriel is trying to teach us something, that’s what tricksters do. I just don’t know what.”
The blaring of a car horn brought Patience out of her vision. She gasped, and finished pulling into her driveway. She had no idea how long she’d been sitting there, stuck in her reverie.
But Dean was itching to get out of the bunker. He couldn’t mope around here all day, thinking about Cas and Mom. Besides, Jody wasn’t nearly as seasoned as the two of them. “Yeah, maybe she can. Or, maybe she ends up dead because we were here, babysitting the antichrist.” He knew it was a low blow, but he needed out.
“I just… and he died right in front of me. I watched him die.” He shook his head. “After everything, he just…” How could he explain to her? How this wasn’t the first time, but it still hurt, it still felt like all the hope in the world was gone.
“Nah, it’s fine, I only really need the one hand,” Dean replied, taking Jack and hoisting him on one hip.
Donatello chuckled. “Poor little tyke. Probably sick of being stuck in here. Should I take him for a walk?”
“If you breathe a word of this to anyone,” Cas whispered, leaning in close, “I will show you what it really means to invoke the wrath of Heaven.” John’s eyes widened in fear, and he nodded curtly. With one mighty flap of his wings, Cas was gone.
“Work this out with me,” Cas said. “Hypothetically, let’s say you’re lying, and I take you to Jack, and then you kill me again–”
“I didn’t actually build this part,” Cas said, nodding to the river they were fishing out of. It was wide and slow, and Dean could see a group of kids off in the distance, playing in the water.
“Well, that’s a chilling story,” Dean said. Cheesy, but sure, chilling. “So we’re dealing with the ghost of a little girl, huh? What was her name?”
With that, the floodgates burst open. Tears streamed down Claire’s face, and she shook with the effort of trying to contain her own sobs. “Yeah. Yeah, I came back. Of course I came back. I had to…” she sniffed, trying to contain her overflowing sinuses.
“Shh,” Cas whispered, bouncing the baby in his arms, “shh, you’re alright, please don’t cry.” He heard the two Winchesters groaning on the other side of the saloon doors.
“What a powerful little tyke you are,” Lucifer cooed. Jack shied away from the stranger. Cas let out a warning sound, almost like a growl, and Dean grabbed onto his shoulder. He knew he couldn’t hold the angel back, but he hoped that he could stop him from doing anything stupid that would end up with him getting killed. Again.
“Huh.” He could feel his face burning. “Well, little dude, you need a bath. It’s going to be a pain to get all this crusted sugar off of you.” They reached the door to Jack’s room.
“Those are the kinds of things you would hear about the Trickster,” Gabriel replied, winking at her. She smirked back flirtatiously.
“Jody!” she cried, startling the woman awake. She reached halfway for the gun on the nightstand before squinting at the bright screen in Claire’s hand. It took her several moments to wake up enough to process what Claire was showing her.
“I mean, I had a plan, you know. We were going to get Kaia to help us bring Mom back. But now Kaia is dead, and we have no real leads on opening this portal. Dean, we don’t have a plan.”
His heart dropped to his stomach, and he looked up at the therapist, intending to deflect the topic, but he found his resolve failing. Maybe it would be good to talk about him. At the very least, it wouldn’t kill him.
“Friend. Sure.” He recalled some of the memories he had seen of Dean’s teenage years, and decided against correcting him. “He doesn’t know I’m here though.”
John stared at Cas like he’d grown two heads, then focused his attention on Jack. “That child is the son of Lucifer?”
“All right,” she said, surprisingly calm, “if you could just tell me what’s the matter with Jack here.”
Something about the phrase seemed to spark an idea in the archangel. He smirked mischievously at the brothers. Sam felt his gut twist into a knot of fear. What had the archangel thought up this time? Another time loop? Another cycle of TV shows that made him get hit in the balls with a machine and declare to the public that he had genital herpes?
“Upstairs!” Donna commanded. Alex grabbed Jack like a football and bolted. “Move!” Patience found herself running after Alex without even really meaning to. She heard Donna shooting at monsters but kept running until they reached a branch in the stairway.
“But right now,” Lucifer replied, pointing a finger at Cas, “you need me, I need you, and we both need my son.”
The monster’s red eyes flashed through her mind. How had it gotten here? It could only get through if there was a portal….
“Good.” Dean chuckled nervously. “I mean, if Kevin Tran can do it, surely we can.” Sam shook his head morosely and walked back down the hall. Dean turned back into the bedroom.
Claire nodded. Today would be a long day of hacking police databases and pacing the living room, but she could survive it. Hell, it was better than the blank white rooms in the disturbed youth centers she used to frequent. As an afterthought, she leaned forward and gave Jody a quick hug.
“Read the damn article I sent you. You’ll thank me later. See you after work.” Claire wanted to throw some more curses at her damn nurse sister, but instead opened the notification as she was told. As soon as she read the headline, she sat bolt upright.
“You don’t sound fine.” Cas felt Gabriel snake an arm around him, lifting most of his weight off of his feet. “How much farther?”
“Jack,” Lucifer echoed, “wow.” He shook his head. “Is he… awesome? I mean, is he a chip off the old block?”
Dean passed a beer to Sam, and then turned to watch Jack sleep. There was something incredibly mournful in his eyes. Sam didn’t want to think about what they’d lost, though, not right now.
After a few minutes, a scream tore through the house. Without a moment’s hesitation, they all sprinted upstairs, but Patience was gone. A curtain flapped by the open window, highlighting the fact that she had been taken. Without a word, Dean ran back downstairs, opened a laptop sitting on the kitchen table, and began working on hacking the traffic cameras in the area. James watched him morosely. Jody went into the other room and called the sheriff.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Dean, all she wants is protection from Lucifer until we can find a way to kill him or shove him back in the cage. Just a room in the bunker, we’ve got plenty to spare.”
All of a sudden, they found themselves in what must have formerly been a dining hall, but with all the tables removed. Sam sprayed another sigil on the wall, and turned to Dean, but a loud rumbling noise rocked the ship. The sigil sparked violently.
They raced down the hallway, catching up with Velma and Daphne. Daphne reached the room first, approaching a figure lying still on the bed.
Cas didn’t know how to respond, but thankfully, Jack whined for his attention again. He squirmed on the mattress of the crib, swinging his arms over his head.
Dean watched as Rowena poured three glasses of scotch, his head still a little bit fuzzy. He bounced Jack on his lap. The kid was fascinated by Rowena’s red hair.
Sam read over the spell, read over it again, then got to work. Rowena followed his every movement with the watchful eyes of a teacher, correcting his technique and practicing pronunciation with him. Finally, Eileen lowered herself into a basin full of moonwater next to a bowl of ingredients.
“My brother betrayed me.” A great sadness washed over Amara. “He said he wanted my help to start a new Creation. He said he was lonely. He promised that he wouldn’t imprison me again. He lied.” She looked up at Cas. “And you, Castiel, freed me.”
Before Cas could answer, the door to the bar swung open, accompanied by a crash of thunder. Standing there was a demon wearing a man in a white suit with a large scar down his face. Cas presumed, by Sam and Dean’s previous description, that this was Asmodeus. He was accompanied by a number of other demons.
Claire couldn’t help but laugh. Typical psychic mumbo jumbo, predicting her doom. Jody gave her a mournful look, and the smile drained from Claire’s face.
“Right,” Sam replied, “yeah, pretty much the same for us. So, how does this usually work? You know, with your patients?”
Something in Dean seemed to break, and he suddenly found himself with his arms full of hunter. Cas felt his shirt ruck up around his lower back and Dean grabbed onto it, as if trying to prove that this was real.
Dean caught the candelabra as he tossed it, and weilded it like a baseball bat as they charged the ghost. It disappeared in a mist as the iron touched its form.
“Dean, can we go back to your cave and watch Avengerers?” asked one of the children. Mina, this one was Mina.
“I’m coming.” He hung up the phone. He wouldn’t believe it until he saw it. But still, he hoped. He wanted so badly for it to be true, for Cas to be back.
“If there are ghosts,” Daphne said shakily, “that means there’s an afterlife. Heaven. Hell. Am I going to Hell?!”
“Surprise,” she greeted. She knew that Jody would not be happy with the split lip and bruises, but shockingly, her mother-figure was smiling at her. “You miss me?”
He picked up the sketchbook and flipped through the pages. His heart dropped. Among the many drawings of forests and otherworldly monsters, there was a drawing of a barren wasteland jutted with large spikes. The Apocalypse World.
“I’m a hero,” Scooby barked, turning the napkin around his neck so Shaggy could blow it like a cape.
“Before me and my brother, there was nothing. Emptiness. Then there was the Darkness, and the Light. The universe was never meant to contain Nothing. I was supposed to inherit the Empty, and fill it with Darkness.” She looked around at the velvety black surrounding them. “Now, thanks to you, I may finally take my place.”
“I’ll help once I’m done eating,” Dean said. After overhearing her and John fighting, he was starting to realize why it was that she was drawn to the refugee children rather than to him and Sam. She had failed them. Dean didn’t want to blame her, but ultimately, she did choose to make the deal with Azazel. He may have forgiven her for that, but she probably didn’t. And if she were anything like him, facing her feelings regarding that was a circle of Hell she wouldn’t wish upon anyone.
“Dean.” He looked up in response to the urgency in Cas’ voice. There, in front of them, behind the barrel of a handgun pointed directly at Cas’ head, was–
Sam jolted awake, whatever nasty dream he’d had already disappearing from his memory like smoke. He glanced down at the baby sleeping in his arms, and was surprised to see him awake and staring at something over Sam’s shoulder. He turned to see a moth bouncing against the lightbulb of the lamp behind him.
“Donatello, listen–” Sam began, but turned to his brother. To Cas’ horror, Dean was wheezing and choking, clutching at his throat and trying to draw breath to no avail. Donatello began to laugh maniacally again.
“I don’t know,” Dean replied, grimacing, “I don’t think the kid really knew what was happening or what he was doing. He’s a newborn, Sam.” He sighed. “I’m going to go get the crib from the car, I’ll set it up in the guest room. And I’ll get the baby monitor, I’ll take dad duty tonight.”
Well, he’d certainly done plenty wrong. Dean thought back to the last order John had given him before he’d died. Not killing Sam was the least of Dean’s wrongdoings, for sure. Hell, he’d been a demon for a hot second there.
He reminded her so much of Dean. It pained her that she had never known Sam when he was this young. She looked around the nursery, tears welling up in her eyes. Her gaze landed on a ceramic angel sitting on the shelf above Jack’s crib. Just like the one she’d had in her boys’ nursery.
Cas was smiling, big and gummy and happier than Dean had ever seen him. Why had Dean never seen him happier than right now, in mortal danger?
“Alright,” Dean said. He started filling up one side of the sink with warm water and soap. It was relieving, to be honest, to get John out of the room. Dean needed more time to process his return.
“All right, all right. Um.” He cleared his throat, trying to think of a song. Elvis wasn't such a bad idea. “Wise men say, only fools rush in....”
He couldn’t bring up Jack in the hunting lifestyle. Some things were unavoidable; he’d always know about the existence of ghosts and monsters and demons and angels. But if Dean could keep him away from the violence of it, at least for longer than he and Sammy….
“Well, I know what we have to do now.” He pushed past the worried brothers and headed to the library. Dean wanted to follow, but he needed to make sure that Donatello was still alive.
Dean glanced at Jack’s sleeping form, looking smaller than ever in the hospital bed. “He doesn’t look to be in that much pain.”
“I see. Please, this way.” The doctor led them to a side room, decorated in the same minimalist but homey way as the rest of the place. “These people you lost, who were they?”
Dean nodded, more than ready to move away from this subject. He knew that Sam hadn’t stopped researching multiverse theories and spellwork, still looking for a way to get their mom back. Maybe he’d offer to help. The chance that Mom had survived was extremely slim, but if Cas had come back, then surely she had a chance. They hadn’t even seen her die, hadn’t burned her body. She had a chance.
There was a soft thump of wings, and Cas immediately slid his blade into his hand. Charlie, who had been standing guard over him, whirled around to face whoever it was who had just joined them, and gasped.
All of a sudden, a flash of purple lightning engulfed the brothers. Dean jumped away, and Sam gasped air down his freed throat. His ears barely registered the sound of heels clicking toward them.
“But how?” Velma asked, coming back down to Earth, so to speak. “We don’t know the first thing about fighting real ghosts. We don’t have the proper tools or weapons.”
“Alright, alright.” Gabriel put his hands up in mock surrender. He rocked backward in his chair and watched Jack, who was sitting on his blanket behind Sam. The kid was clumsily stacking blocks, knocking them over when they got four high.
“You two puny humans thought you could best me?” Lucifer shouted to the room at large. “I am beyond anything your brains could ever try to understand!”
“You’re heroes!” Dean concluded, “and together, we are going to take down this phantom. Are you with me?”
He left Sam with Donatello’s body, storming after Cas. The angel was pacing anxiously in the war room. He looked up when Dean entered the room.
“He went to Heaven. Knowing our luck… something is seriously wrong, and we need help if we want to heal him.”
“I…” He let his own grief surface, lowering himself into the chair across from Dean. “We killed Lucifer. But… Rowena didn’t make it.”
“Mom’s dead, Sam. Lucifer ripped out her friggin’ heart. Now the sooner you can wrap your head around that, the sooner we can both move on.” He wished he’d used less harsh words, but really, how could he say it any different? It was the way it was.
“Sam didn’t tell you?” Dean asked. Jody shook her head. “Jack is Lu– Kelly’s kid.” He couldn’t possibly name Lucifer as the kid’s parent. The little guy was so… little. Helpless. Even if he did shatter lightbulbs when he got too cranky.
The dog shrieked similarly, and lept into the teenager’s arms. The teenager then lept backwards into Cas’ arms. Cas didn’t understand how this helped in any way.
“I’m not going to send you away, Cas,” Dean said quietly. Cas let out a breath, his heart rate starting to calm. He let himself relax into Dean’s embrace. It was… nice. Safe.
Kelly’s kid. Sam thought of her, lying on her birthing bed, looking to all the world like she was asleep. He would have to wrap her body like Dean had wrapped Cas’.
“Cut me a little bit of slack. Please?” He threw up his hands in exasperation. “That unhinged thind and that meth head Kevin Tran are about to bust through that door. God isn’t here! It’s just us! We’re all we got, in case you hadn’t noticed!”
He slowly pushed open the door. The girl was sitting up, staring at him with a fearful look in her eyes.
“Okay, fine.” The Empty tilted its head to the side in a grotesque imitation of the gesture Cas usually made. “I’ll rack it for you.”
“Sure thing, Mina. Plates in the sink when you’re done, everyone, and there’s seconds next to the stove if you’re still hungry.” He turned to Cas. “I’ll wash, you dry?”
“Yeah, I know that.” Did Dean know about his conversation with her about Lucifer? He doubted it. Did he know about the page from the book?
“Y’all looking for someone?” the Sarge drawled as Dean approached, also carrying a shotgun, “‘Cause I am. Bank in town just got robbed. Turned into a real O.K. Corral type of deal. Big ol’ shootout.”
