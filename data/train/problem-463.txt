I was quite relieved to discover his presence. My recollection of him was that he was quiet, in a restrained rather than timid manner, and was often a calming influence on his somewhat excitable wife. The last thing we needed was a scene.
John and Greg exchanged significant looks over the dark curls and nodded in affirmation of each other’s silent observation. Finally, John picked up another of the gifts. “Hey, ‘Lock, this one’s from Uncle Greg.” Sherlock spun around to face him, and he handed him the gift bag. Long fingers swiftly extracted a blue plastic case with a clear plastic front.
“Sherlock?” I pressed. “What were you doing?” He suddenly found something that seemed to interest him keenly in the newspaper. I knew what this meant. “You were poisoning yourself with that damned cocaine the entire time, weren’t you?”
“You know,” she mused, taking another sip, “I cannot recall such an oppressive heat as this for years. Not since… goodness. Mr. Hudson and my darling boy were still with me.”
“Those I did revise,” he admitted. “I spent a good amount of time last night refreshing myself on the professed morals of those of the Christian faith.”
And then he broke. “God, Greg—I’ve missed him so much. He’s been so wound up and so adamant about not wanting it. I know it’s got something to do with his time away and after… when he came back, but it’s been torture watching him. He’s been needing it so much. He’s literally got the weight of the world on his shoulders and I can’t get him to eat or sleep or even stop and look at me for one minute. He’s killing himself over it all, and I just want to take care of him.”
Sherlock carefully maneuvered the glass to his lips (it was only half full; no sense in tempting fate with his dodgy hands) and swallowed some, then cautiously put it back on the table and reached for the small ramekin in front of him. He grasped the small spoon she had provided and began to spoon the soft chocolate mousse into his mouth.
I must admit that, despite her less-admirable characteristics, I cannot fault Mrs. Bloom’s tenacity. Her eyes flashing with anger, she drew herself up and addressed my love quite directly. “Mr. Holmes, I find what you imply disgusting. Clearly I am a moral woman because I both avoid injurious acts
“I am sorry to hear of it,” I answered honestly, and I admit here that inside myself I felt a horrible dismay at the thought of him experiencing these fits for the rest of his life.
Sherlock hovered about rather uselessly, whilst I carefully began to attend to our landlady’s injury. At that point, she rather firmly instructed him to wipe up all the spilled (and now rather firmed up) broth from the floor, and we both breathed a sigh of relief as this task distracted him for several minutes.
, John? He cannot abide you going away for even a day—every separation you two have ever experienced has been because of an investigation or because
That was quite apparent, and so being the case, the decision not to subject him to intravenous antibiotics, painkillers, and nutritional supplements at that moment was unanimous. If he was calmer, they probably would have—he clearly needed them—but in his present state of mind the last thing the confused and terrified man needed was a tether to an IV bag. He had been traumatized enough just by the initial blood draws and injections. Oral medications would have to do.
“Hm?” The younger man looked up from the wooden pieces he was examining. “Oh, no, John. Obviously not.”
He watched blearily as the nice lady quickly made up a nest of blankets on the sofa. That was better. Daddy let him sleep on the sofa when he was feeling ill.
“Did they mention how far behind I was on paying my bills?” I was feeling ill. I reached up and pressed my hand over his.
As I examine this letter from the real “Miss Helen Stoner” I find myself reflecting on various issues. Yes, I do change names, and dates, and locations, and sometimes other details, all with the intention of disguising the true identities of the unfortunates involved in the sometimes loathsome crimes investigated by my friend. In this case, I invented all the names, changed the location and the name of the manor-house and the inn, and set the entire story eight years back, when in truth it happened barely a year ago.
“John? Are you well?” He sat up as well and reached his hand out in the darkness, laying it on my chest. “What has alarmed you?”
At that point I had looked back at Mycroft Holmes, who had once again fixed his gaze on his frenzied brother, temporarily and only somewhat calmed, and although he would deny it to his dying day, I do believe I noted the slightest glistening in his keen eyes.
Whatever it was, I am grateful that he did not only observe but act on it, for if he had not, there would have been no possibility of us sharing rooms.
“You are very clever, Doctor. Yes. I thought that I could show her the recipes whilst I read them to her, and I will write the orders as she observes, and I will spell out the words for her.”
He shrugged and returned to his activity, which she now could see. He had a large book on his lap, closed, and he was using it to lean on as he coloured. He had a large box of crayons. As she observed he very carefully (his hands trembled) selected a green one and carefully began to draw with it. Two long, straight lines, parallel to one another but at a slight diagonal, and then he joined them with shorter lines.
No. Damn. There was some fuss at the perimeter of the scene. He glanced over, scowling. A constable was arguing with someone across the yellow tape. He looked at the DI.
He called up a name from his tidy list of contacts and hit the icon that would bring him in touch with
Sherlock was rather reluctantly seated at the table in his brother’s room. There was a well-built man sitting across from him, encouraging him to eat. He sighed and picked up his spoon. Maybe if he cooperated, his brother would send his irritating assistant to get him some decent clothing—and The Coat—and then his driver would take him home.
Finally, it was time to depart. I had collected some clothes and books and our correspondence; my chequebook, which fortunately was not locked in Sherlock’s desk as it sometimes is. The last item I claimed was his violin. As always, no matter his mood or temperament or even his sometime incoherence, he always treats the instrument with the utmost respect and—dare I say it—love? It is always—always—put away clean and with great care. I found that I could not resist taking it up out of its case in my hands, gingerly at first, and then with gratitude.
This was an absolute fact. He had once tripped up a thief by noting that his alibi included him partaking of a particular meal in a particular restaurant that, if he was of the faith he claimed, an impossibility, both due to the restrictions regarding food practiced by those of that faith and those of the establishment in which he claimed to have dined.
“He gets ahead of himself,” she explained, gratefully accepting it. “He’s not ‘Lock’s parent, but for some reason he thinks he’s better at it than we are. If he’s going to do that, he has to prove to me that he can offer something that we can’t.”
“What was that, my love?” Winifred inquired, covering up her surprise that their patient had attempted to speak.
Now I heard his footsteps retreating over the gravel walkway, but the desperation of my situation was not retreating in kind. I stripped off my coat and laid it across my lap.
“I’ve been taking care of him!” she protested defensively. She had already gotten negative comments from patients’ families twice in less than six weeks; one more and she would most certainly lose her position.
“It… I… I do not know.” I waited as he considered a bit and was rewarded when he finally continued, “Although I am not in the least bit hungry, I know that I need to eat. I do. But the fork is so very heavy, and when I get the food to my mouth, I cannot swallow it.”
It had been many, many years since he had taken any classes about biology, but he was perfectly capable of reading the doctor’s report and he did understand what
Finally, he all but collapsed into my lap. As always, he was light and no great burden, and he was cautious about putting his weight on my bad leg. I wrapped my arms around him again and arranged him so that his head was on my shoulder. I had found this to be the most conducive position when we were having a difficult conversation; it allowed him to talk without looking directly at me, and it allowed me to comfort him whilst he did so.
It had been a test, of course, even if he hadn’t been aware that that was what he was doing at the time. He couldn’t explain it, and fortunately never really had to.
“Calm yourself, John,” my dear friend suggested, laying a hand on my arm. “What I learned was this: although several shopkeepers verify that there must be a second person in the house when Mr. Bloom is supposed to be on his own, no one has ever seen who it is. He keeps to himself at those times—indeed, he even declines invitations, preferring to remain at home and rarely opening his door to visitors.”
I will not waste your time nor mine on the social conventions. I have recently returned from travelling in America—particularly New York—and you know very well who I saw there.
He ducked his head. “I apologise for that. When I am not in the throes of such an attack, I both tend to forget how debilitating they can be and somehow hope that I will not experience one again. I do realise at this stage of my life that that is unlikely, but somehow I still wish it to be true. Sometimes I go for quite a while between these fits, and that gives me a false hope that they have somehow subsided forever.”
It was only after Sherlock departed for his excursion—seeking information regarding the will of the women’s mother—that the second possibility—that of that dreadful man discovering us in a compromising situation—occurred to me, and I admit to being so shaken that I simply sat, staring into the fire, wondering at how we had managed to be so fortunate for remaining in secret for so long.
“I have observed that characteristic,” I agreed. “She has even been willing to assist Mr Holmes in his research.”
I could picture him now, sitting on his bed, washing and drying his feet and then dropping the wet sponge onto the towel. He probably then stretched out on his bed, completely bare.
“That sounds perfect,” I replied. “But only if you join me,” I added. The glasses were on our sideboard and I retrieved two.
And having written that, I correct myself. The most distressing manifestation of Sherlock Holmes’ periods of mania is his inability and lack of desire for sleep—and for lying with me in our bed.
“Surely, Watson, you are aware that governing this empire is not simply a matter of signing papers and making speeches.”
“Are you taking us directly to the ship?” he demanded. He had been bouncing and jigging about in the carriage, and more than once I could not prevent myself from laying a calming hand on his arm.
Despite the soothing scene, all four of them were terribly on edge. Nothing was right. The injection had quieted Sherlock, but it had not calmed him. Behind the terrible lethargy it brought on, it was obvious that he was fighting it; still agitated.
The younger man handed the box to him and began to examine the second. “Art Ball?” he questioned, looking at John.
In the case of Sherlock Holmes (he had honestly not believed that was his real name at first; he thought it was some nickname or street name, like Shezza was), after five years, he still didn’t know the man’s entire story.
When he had managed two biscuits and most of the milk, he was surprisingly complacent and took the tablets without a fuss.
It was not the first time the younger brother, with his wild, dark curls and intense eyes, had required it.
And then he turned a page, and, with a sudden intake of breath, he pulled his hands away, gasping as if he had been burned. He shoved the book violently away from himself.
Both operatives pretended not to notice when the man who usually personified a stiff upper lip hesitated the slightest bit at the mention of his brother. They had been brought up to date by Anthea before she had gratefully gone home sometime after midnight, of course, but neither of them felt it was their place to bring it up.
“There is no guarantee that we will receive the most appropriate applicant immediately,” Mrs Hudson mused, having obviously enjoyed her fish and chips and gherkins (and praising Sherlock lavishly for his success at bringing home a surprisingly acceptable meal). “I have been considering how to manage.”
“No… it is time you knew. You have been so forthcoming in sharing with me your travails when you were away at war, and even of your experiences with your own father and brother.” He seemed to lose his initiative, his voice dropping back to nothing.
“Well, yes, of course,” he had stammered. Damn. Being on the receiving end of a “talking to” from Mummy always made him feel fourteen years old and caught smoking for the first time. Not that it had happened very often, of course—Sherlock had received at least ninety percent of her ire. Well, that had been the pattern in the past. The two years that his brother had been gone, he had had the “privilege” of being on the receiving end one hundred percent of the time. Was he watching his diet? Had he switched barbers? Had his assistant dealt with that rude man who had the flat above her? (How had she known about that?) Had his gardener looked into that new spray? (That was from Dad). Why didn’t he date? They would be delighted to have a nice man—a guest—to dinner.
Damn. I could not conjecture further. I had left the scene with just that limited amount of information.
“Oh, all right,” she agreed. She sat herself neatly in the wicker chair we usually used for clients and, playing the host, I happily poured and placed into her hand a glass of the iced claret punch. It glistened prettily in the afternoon light.
I have started and discarded a dozen letters to you this past week. I find that I cannot compose a single sentence without striking out half of it. I am not often so inarticulate, but our current situation seems to have struck me dumb.
“So you always planned on talking me into travelling with you?” I asked, despite the circumstances enjoying his playful enthusiasm. I was continuing to be extremely careful about not actually specifying to where I was intending to travel.
“Sit down, Sherlock!” she insisted, watching in horror as he swayed in place. He was crouched in a defensive stance and was close to hyperventilating. “Solomon, get out!”
She looked at me keenly. “Doctor Watson?” she ventured, “Is there something amiss? Oh, I should not be telling you such a terrible story.”
“I grew so apprehensive that I visited them, and seeing my poor sister—she was a changed woman, Doctor. She was so very ill. My poor brother-in-law—he knew there was something wrong but… well… I don’t rightly know why he didn’t get her to a doctor or at least write to me. Not that it would have helped. Poor thing was completely out of her head.”
And then, as if the emotions being expressed were suddenly too much—too unseemly and uncivilised and messy, perhaps—Mycroft began to rather determinedly eat his dinner. Subject closed.
“If I order something, will you at least try some of it?” John peered at the short food menu. He was grateful that the security chief had steered them towards the bar. The food menu there was just nibbles rather than full meals; he was much more likely to find something that wouldn’t overwhelm Sherlock here than a full-service establishment. He held his thumb over the prices as much as he could; for once he was selecting items because they sounded good rather than whatever was least expensive.
My own mouth had fallen open in astonishment at this point, and I observed a faint film of perspiration on the brow of Mr. Bloom, but my darling remained the example of a perfect English gentleman—he took a sip of his tea.
Mrs Parker was not easily shocked, but there was really no other way that she could have reacted to the sight of the prodigal son.
John roared with laughter. “Oh, that’s fantastic. Sherlock Holmes, speechless.” Then he took pity on him. “You did that for me?”
Mrs Parker nearly giggled. Mycroft Holmes go to work in a suit from last season, sans waistcoat and with the top button of the shirt undone? England would fall.
“Mummy, why not come hold Stephen’s hand while I get him fixed up? Even pirates can have Mummy hold their hand.”
John dragged his shopping list out of his pocket, then looked at his trolley. Damn. He had somehow not put half the items he needed into it and would have to backtrack. He shook his head, willing himself to concentrate.
And of course there was the sofa with its nest of blankets, haphazard collection of pillows and cushions, and the ubiquitous bin.
The entire affair did actually proceed as I presented it. I did not have the heart to embellish and no need to change any names, locations, dates. The news of the demise of the famous detective would soon reach around the world. It is my understanding that, other than in London itself, the largest impact that news had was on his admirers in America. This does not surprise me. Americans live in an expansive, rich, and youthful state of what seems to me to be continual celebration. Sometimes that celebration can be of the smallest things—the joy of a returned affection; the encouragement of a shared laugh; the ebullience of a pocket full of cash on pay day—but celebrate it they do, but when the news is bad, the passion that Americans bring to their mourning is both alarming and entirely admirable. Why should not the death of a friend, an acquaintance, or a hero not evoke the same intensity of passion and the expression of emotions that the death of a child, a parent, or a spouse elicits?
We had just gotten back in our rooms, having resolved a case involving a decidedly unhappy family. Instead of being exulted by his success, as he usually is, Sherlock was restless and disturbed and could not settle down. I failed to convince him to eat anything. Mrs. Hudson had made a pigeon pie that was simply delicious and served to us piping hot, but after she cleared away the plates (she has left the pie on the sideboard, obviously hoping that her overly-thin tenant would eventually have some), I settled in my armchair by the fire and turned my attention to him.
She glanced at him, then at the used hypodermic she had tossed onto the table. She hated—absolutely hated—having to use it on him, but he could do himself serious injury reacting the way he had. It was the fastest way to calm him down. She had not mentioned it to his brother, but she (and all the nurses who would be caring for him) carried a capped syringe at all times.
It would be too much to hope that any possessions he might have had with him would turn up, but at least it was an entryway into backtracking his brother’s trail. The soil analysis on the clothing he had been found in had been completed, hundreds of hours of CCTV footage had been analysed, and a review of his physical condition upon retrieval had all assisted in identifying at least his most recent location and a rough idea of how long he had been away from modern bathing amenities.
“He mentioned my war wounds, and conjectured that it was they that inhibited my ability to...” I stopped myself. “Is that what he has told Mrs. Bloom? That he was crippled in some way?”
Now, his hand shaking painfully, his brother offered him a slightly mashed piece of folded paper. Mycroft unfolded it curiously. Would it be another page of numbers and equations? A crayoned image of a dark-haired man strung up by his wrists, his sinewy arms spread painfully in a horrific echo of a crucifixion image?
How can I explain this? I am not entirely sure what has happened, or how it happened. It is so unlikely that I must write it down now or tomorrow I will not believe that it did happen.
“I think that would be lovely, sir,” the nurse nodded. “Sherlock, would you like to have dinner with your brother?”
Then—and only then—did he begin to draw with them on the clean, white A4 paper the nurse had found for him.
Enough food for two people. I turned it over and over in my mind. Food enough for two people. No servants. “There is someone else eating in the house with Mr. Bloom when his wife is absent.”
Now, as I watched her apply some sort of mysterious fluid to a rag and rub it briskly on the carpet, I shook my head in amusement. Only in our household.
Finally, the police arrived and Sherlock explained the situation (well, our agreed-to version of it) to them, and I was relieved beyond words when, as the sun rose, we were able to make our escape from the nightmarish house. We took Miss Stoner, who had been admirably steady as she was interviewed, to the morning train and escorted her to her aunt’s. Miss Stoner and Sherlock and I sat and discussed gypsies and cheetahs and wills and weddings until we reached the station.
But I was also keenly aware that he was correct on his other point—the heat did not, generally, bother me overmuch.
“Yes, except for your brother,” I agreed, “but I do not think that even you could detect such minute signs in someone you just met, and in a public place, where he would certainly be cautious about his behaviour.”
“So,” he summed up, suddenly returning to the thrust of our conversation, “the image that I project—an eccentric-to-the-point-of-lunatic consulting detective is difficult enough to manage without adding in anything about what I wear or what music I listen to.”
He recovered himself swiftly, however, and first helped me back into my coat and then, drawing my hand through his arm, he supported me as we made our way out towards the street. I wanted to protest his action, but found myself at a loss for words. He was only demonstrating a kindness—why should I have an objection? How was he to know how much this brought to my mind the countless times Sherlock has linked his arm in mine so that we might stroll down the pavement pressed against one another in an acceptable manner?
He whimpered as his wet pyjamas were removed. He hadn’t meant to. It was an accident. Daddy never got angry about accidents. The man helping him didn’t seem angry, either. So maybe it was not so bad. He would try to be a big boy and remember to ask if he needed Daddy to help him with the toilet.
He sulked at this, but I felt only a touch of chagrin. He was so very ridiculous sometimes. I did understand his point—very much so—but his example was, well… it was amusing.
“You perhaps were more vigorous in the application of avoidance of indecent behaviours than in performing pious ones.” My sweetheart’s voice was like warmed honey.
“Clearly, yes—but there is no need for her to be. There are still so many children who, through no fault of their own, do not receive even the most basic of lessons.”
He emerged from the hidden entrance to his home office—which just happened to be in an underground bunker—and took a deep breath. He could use some exercise, and some dinner. Not necessarily in that order. He glanced at his watch and strode into the kitchen.
“Checking into rehab would probably be a good first step,” John muttered back as the man hung his head in shame.
Had never fussed with the tea pot and strainer and those ridiculous tiny, fragile teacups and saucers—those drove him berserk. Seriously—balance a slippery bit of china full of hot liquid on another equally slippery one? Who had come up with that?
“I am sorry about all the work,” I repeated. I had been watching her in some fascination as she efficiently tackled the ashes that had been rubbed into the hearthrug. “I am not even certain what he was doing in the first place.”
“As you noted, I set out immediately. Mr. Bramsen had requested that I meet him in a rather clandestine spot.”
“Yes. There was shouting. I got out of my bed to investigate, but I was so very ill that when I reached the head of the stairs, I tumbled down to the ground floor.”
thoughts full noise confusion images battering cluttered bright cold pain spinning sick swirling lost
“I’ll deal with this,” he indicated to the constable, who nodded and moved a few steps away, shaking her head in annoyance. He turned his attention to the interloper.
Then he was alone in the large room and for some reason that made him horribly uneasy. He rose—not easily—and wobbled over to a window.
So, although these facts (for the most part) were absolutely cause for me to feel embarrassment and shame, they did not reveal anything
His words faded to nothing as I removed his shirt and vest and, with a quick twitch of his hips, his trousers and drawers. I bundled everything up and tossed it all into the furthest corner of the room. “I will remove those presently,” I informed him. “Now, I believe a sponge and towel were the recommended prescriptions for this particular condition?” I kept my tone light and teasing. He seemed to be in an odd mood. He was fastidious and despised being foul in that way; I presumed that now that he was aware of it, it was his physical state that was disturbing him.
We both considered this for a bit, I gazing into the glass of sherry in my hand and he into the fire. I found my head beginning to spin—not with the spirits I was imbibing, but with the words we were bandying about like a shuttlecock.
He began to consider that. How had he gotten back into the country; how had he been travelling through Europe? He must have had something. He wondered about his appearance, as well. Surely someone so thoroughly dishevelled would have attracted some attention at some point.
“Yes, I am Doctor Watson,” I responded, making it clear from the tone of my voice that I was rather more than a bit taken aback by his forwardness. “May I ask who you are?”
I know nothing whatsoever about china, or silver, or crystal. We received a great deal of all of that when we were married—Mary and I—but that was one of those things at which I was doomed to “fail” as a husband. Mrs. Hudson’s familiar settings are, I am sure, not terribly fine, but we are (Sherlock is) hard on delicate objects and I am certain that she does not on a regular basis use her “best” for us. Clients—now that I consider it, I do believe that she does bring out the finer china when serving tea to a lady or gentleman. I am certain that for our friend Lestrade, she does not go to such ends. And I am equally certain that neither he nor Sherlock nor I cares one whit.
“Anyway,” she continued with a determined briskness. “It was horribly hot. I felt as if I could not draw a deep breath.”
Finally, their remarkable landlady had presented them with the most perfect crisp-on-the-outside/chewy on the inside, puffy,
Once I was certain that it was she, I did then reach out and touch her arm. She turned to me and instantly recognised me. I thought that she was going to faint. But then she rallied and smiled at me and greeted me by name.
There were a few false starts on one page, and then the final result was carefully copied, sans crossed-out words, on a fresh sheet in Sherlock’s tidiest writing. I admit that I counted the words; there were, of course, exactly twenty-four. Mrs Hudson would not, even if we were paying for the advertisement, tolerate the 1d cost for every extra word over the standard 24.
Of course, and most importantly, any letters between ourselves that would incriminate us in any way have been secreted with my other private papers or burned, and no eyes but our own had ever laid upon them.
“Are we going in all together?” I asked. My chest felt tight and my hands were suddenly uncomfortably damp.
“What?” The rocking did not cease or even slow; it was apparent that he was completely unaware of what he was doing.
Why do I stay with him if he is so difficult? I stay because, quite simply, he is who he is. He is mercurial moods and flashes of brilliance. He is omniscient; he is utterly innocent. He is energy and sloth. He is biting insults and heartfelt compliments. He is simply Sherlock Holmes--and I cannot bear to consider my life without him.
He rolled towards me then, and I was so very gratified to feel his slight weight as it pressed against me.
“I thought... the decorations or something. Something in common you’d noticed at all the crime scenes.”
“Don’t be so childish,” I instructed, trying not to laugh. “You are positively foul. Why were you rolling around in manure anyway? Do I really want to know?”
I have seen his face on some of these nights. He watches longingly as I prepare for bed. I encourage him to do the same: a soft nightshirt; a warm dressing gown. Comfortable slippers. A glass of sherry or wine and a good book in front of the fire. He tries to emulate me. He truly does try. He usually manages to change his clothes. Before we were—what we are now—I would send him into his room and he would eventually emerge thusly attired. Now, of course, I ensure that he does so by leading him into his room and as carefully as possible assisting him. He is often so impatient that he pushes away my hands, pulls violently on buttons, and even tears his fine shirts. Mrs Hudson knows when he has been in such a mood by the amount of mending she must do.
It alarmed me that Sherlock had not reacted to his brother’s words. He had apparently lost interest in our presence and was not listening to our exchange at all. He continued his activity, mumbling something to himself about hats. “I suppose Mrs. Hudson could have the rest of my things sent, couldn’t she, after I send my new address,” he mused. “I should like some of my books.”
And despite all of that, and despite the delicacy of Sherlock’s beautiful features; his curls and fair complexion and slender hands and moods and tendency to faint—I have never once wished or even considered the possibility of him
I am taking the liberty of writing to you not just as a past client of Mr. Holmes, but also as an admirer of your stories regarding his investigations. I cannot fully express my excitement—and trepidation—upon receiving the latest issue of The Strand magazine and immediately realising that it contained your rendition of our adventure together. I have read it several times with great interest and not a little shame—not for myself, but about my stepfather and his wicked, wicked ways. I also found myself shedding tears anew for my dear sister, but am more than anything heartened and reassured by the fact that the mystery of her death was discovered whilst also keeping our family’s terrible secrets private.
“Oh, Doctor Watson!” she exclaimed, dropping the weapon to her side, “I am that relieved that it is you. I am never sure who will appear on my doorstep.” I gave her what I hoped was a slightly apologetic smile and invited her to join me in foraging in our rooms for what we might need.
No. Medically speaking, I had found nothing. “You have no other symptoms, but you seem distracted,” I commented.
We were fortunate in that it was only a few days later that we hired Belinda. She was tall and healthily built, with brown hair and blue eyes. Her accent, according to Sherlock, indicated that she had lived as a child in Yorkshire, but she had gradually refined her way of speaking and did not sound out of place in the metropolis. She was dressed modestly and neatly, and she gave every impression of being capable of hard work whilst also attending to the smaller niceties we might require. Her references were impeccable. She and Mrs Hudson got along immediately, and in fact she started her labours for us that very afternoon. I hung the “position filled” card on the front door with great satisfaction.
“I had to rather overextend myself,” he added, stretching his arm out. I ran my eyes down his lithe body. I took a deep breath in as I observed how very much tighter the front of his trousers was now; and he grinned wickedly as he observed that my own body was in a similar condition.
Sherlock had made himself quite ill with the smoke (I was out during the debacle and returned just in time to tend to him) (and apologise to Mrs Hudson and Belinda) and I was rather astounded that our landlady had not been stricter with him. Was this proof that at least some of her sometimes seemingly perpetual ire stemmed from simply being overworked?
She gave him a mildly insulted look that vastly assured him. “How is he?” she asked. She looked straight at him. Many (most) people were intimidated by Mycroft Homes—by his design—but to work as an effective assistant, she needed to be stronger than that. That, and her position had allowed her to witness the human side of the man, and she more than anyone truly understood what anguish he was experiencing.
“Sherlock,” I began, my own voice hoarse with emotion, “your brother is correct. You are not at all well. You are confused and ill.”
Mrs. Hudson snorted in amusement. “I look forward to that,” she stated, turning to precede me down the stairs.
“Have a cigarette,” I encouraged, reaching into his pocket for his case and matches. He allowed me to extract a cigarette, place it between his lips, and light it for him. I realised then that he had not been smoking—not since his after-breakfast pipe—or had he had that? Or breakfast, for that matter?
John frowned. That was not at all what he had been expecting. “Really? That’s... that’s actually rather fascinating, Sherlock,” he admitted. “Any deductions as to the reason?”
They rode in silence for a bit, looking out opposite windows at the brightly-lit shop windows and hurrying crowds. A brisk wind had begun to wind its way through the streets. John watched as a well-dressed man suddenly dashed forward to reclaim his hat.
“I myself admit to being a prisoner to my own particular urge—as the good doctor here has written about more than once. My personal shackle is cocaine, and although I do at times attempt to resist the urge to take it, the urge is much stronger than my desire to avoid it.
His baby brother could not, apparently, be relied on to know when he needed to use the toilet—at least not when he was sleeping. It had not been a huge surprise to anyone who had been with him since his retrieval, but the bubbly, young nurse had been rather put out about it, tut-tutting and fussing and chastising as she led him into the bathroom for a wash and change of clothes.
I saw Mrs. Watson as we—I was visiting my cousin Albert, and he was my escort for the evening—were leaving a concert hall. The lobby was crowded, and although she did not initially take any notice of me, I was instantly suspect that it was she. I was able to get close enough to her to hear her speak, and that confirmed her identity. She wears her hair differently, but I could not mistake her voice.
When it is dark, we ascribe nefarious intentions to the most innocuous of men simply because he is out of doors without the benefit of the light of the sun.
I voiced my scepticism with some vehemence. “What led you down that particular path? The way he held his cup? His tie? Was he wearing theatrical make-up?”
“You mean, is that all things that he actually saw, or experienced?” She looked close to tears. “Yes, I do.”
I have no idea how I knew, that early on, what he meant or what I needed to do to help him, but somehow I did. “Shall I lay it all out for you?” I inquired calmly.
“Yes, a CT scan and x-rays. We don’t believe he currently has any broken bones,” remarked another medical professional, “but it would be good to see if there were any in the past; ensure that everything is healing properly.”
was. The clinical terminology wasn’t fooling him. His baby brother had had his head bashed in and it had damaged his brain (screw the scans) and that was why one of the most gregarious men in England was now
“No—indeed, it made me feel all that much closer to you, and now, sharing this information about myself makes me feel closer still.”
say the words aloud. Granted, sometimes it was muttered in an undertone to himself, but he had to vocalise it all or he would go mad.
That was when the surveillance began. He had, by then, moved quietly and steadily up the invisible ladder that his life in the shadowy underside of “the government” had offered him. For the most part, he had been entirely—completely—undeniably and reliably—professional. Friendships, social obligations—even his parents never competed for his attention to his job. He himself did not have what might be considered a “personal” life—no companion or attachment of any description. He eschewed the trappings of emotions.
anything about us, but what if that turns out to be an insufficient deterrent? What if she goes to the authorities or makes a public declaration of her suspicions? The accusation alone would lead to an investigation, would it not? And then who is to know what evidence some dogged prosecutor would turn up? Are the Blooms still a threat to our freedom and safety?”
“No, I forgot that I used it all for an experiment. You will enjoy what I have in my Persian slipper, however. –Sherlock”
you to come home, but yes, I did mean that you would do better to stay away—perhaps find someone normal to be with. I am a horrible, hateful person and do not deserve to have you here.”
Sherlock’s moods are mercurial and often inexplicable. I do not exaggerate in my published writings when I describe the passionate energy and focus that accompanies a case, nor the plunge into lethargy that follows. In fact, I have treated some of these periods more lightly than the truth of them warrants. It is not just during a case, or just for a case, that he eschews nourishment and sleep. Sometimes his brilliant mind is, as he has described, like a racing engine, and it spins and spins in a frankly frightening manner. During those manias, he speaks so quickly I cannot understand him; he cannot stand still, let alone sit or sleep.
An hour later, Mycroft shook his head. “I cannot allow that, and you know it, Sherlock. I cannot allow you to return to your home while you’re still so… confused.”
The nurse nodded in welcome. “I was just about to wake him; I’ve got something for him here.” He indicated a covered tray. The elder brother strode over to it and lifted the lid, nodding in satisfaction—one cooked egg, toast, marmalade. A small spoon. Excellent.
The next shift was taken by someone named Gloria. She was young and bubbly and Mrs Parker was irritated by her. Mycroft detested her.
“Oh, yes, of course, but a proper lady’s maid must be capable of tending to her mistress’s needs, and at the end, in particular, when she was quite frail, I was often called upon to make something nourishing at odd hours. I was fortunate to have experience in the kitchen from my prior work… goodness, Doctor Watson. I am going on and on about myself when I should be working.”
During this I mainly kept my eyes fixed on my friend, but sometimes I would glance at his brother who, like myself, was seated at the edge of his chair, ready to spring up and impede Sherlock’s rambling if it became necessary.
“Ironically, the best way to keep him safe is to expose him. Make his return public. Make him visible to all of London. Thrust him out into the unrelenting eye of the media so anyone trying to get to him will find that they have an audience.”
“You’re correct,” Mycroft apologised, snatching up an ashtray and stubbing the offending object out. “Here, Sherlock.” He held the ashtray out and, reluctantly, his brother echoed his action. The nurse yanked the heavy crystal object from him and spun around, walking hurriedly out of the room with it.
“That tatty little flat of yours is unchanged—you owe me two years’ rent—but beyond that I cannot possibly… what is it?” He paused in concern as the thin man, with a great effort, rolled away from him, onto his side, and covered his face with his arm.
I held him more closely. He was trembling. “Yes, of course I am certain. How could you possibly think that?”
“Of course. What else do you need? I truly believe that you will feel better once we are at the hall. Music always uplifts you.” I turned and opened his wardrobe and carefully began to withdraw the elements of his evening clothes.
“Honestly, my love, no, I do not,” I admitted. “English laws regarding unnatural acts between men such as ourselves are as likely to change as... as it is to discover a hidden world of great dinosaurs still alive.”
Sherlock frowned in apparent confusion. Mycroft took one thin, trembling hand and pulled him gently in the correct direction. He took a few stumbling steps, then stopped dead. The trembling increased as he shook his head furiously.
“If anything happened to you, my dearest brother, I would have failed. I promised our mother and our father that I would take care of you, and if I failed, I would be heartbroken.”
I considered both the short time I lived there with Mary and my observations of Mrs. Hudson, and then it came to me. “Why, deliveries of groceries,” I exclaimed. “The butcher’s boy, the greengrocer, the dairymaid. If a household is reduced by half, the amount of food required should be equally reduced—it would be even more greatly diminished if the remaining inhabitants do not cook.”
“So discuss it,” he said coldly. As he paced, he glanced out the windows several times—and I admit to becoming more alarmed with each look. I could see that his brother was equally apprehensive of his actions—the horror of the night before was still so present in both of our minds—and in the bandages on Sherlock’s hands. He startled me by suddenly hissing, “You have never requested my input before; why should I think that you desire it now?”
Fortunately, due to the sturdiness of British cloth and the dullness of the misused blade, coupled with Sherlock’s unsure, jerky movements, he did not manage to do so much as remove a button. Mycroft made a noise that I can only describe as an exasperated sigh and without hesitation grasped Sherlock’s right wrist in his left hand and adroitly removed the weapon with his right. Without taking his eyes off his brother, he handed it to me, and I instantly closed it and dropped it into my coat pocket.
It has been some time since I wrote about this terrible period in our lives. I have all the bits I managed to put down whilst in the midst of it all, and I now intend to go back and fill in the missing pieces to the best of my ability. I will not, however, rewrite or revise any of my original notes—they speak so much to our conditions of both body and mind that I value their immediacy.
“It was sheer coincidence that we followed Malcolm through the gate,” Benjamin reflected. He and the gardener were in Mrs Parker’s kitchen with Ian and Sean, each gratefully cradling a hot cup of tea. It was late, but none of them were willing to retire. Sean had sent the still-woozy nurse home in a taxi, shaking his head sharply at Benjamin’s offer to drive her.
And so, we finished our meal. As I had promised, I stacked the plates and whatnot back on the tray and placed it, covered, on the sideboard. Whilst I was doing so, Sherlock wandered into his bedroom and changed his coat for a dressing gown, then retrieved my smoking jacket. I accepted it and made myself comfortable before falling into my chair.
“Ah, coffee! Excellent,” the slender man now exclaimed, helping himself before I could even offer him a cup. “Sherlock, would you like some? Can you manage a cup?”
There were two people; they were quite dull and average and talked about boring things, but he wanted to talk to them nonetheless. He wasn’t at all sure why, if they were so mundane. Something about reading glasses? Getting shouted at. Getting a kiss on his cheek. Getting presents at Christmas. Very confusing.
Without a word, he scrambled off his raft of cushions and into my lap. His pipe had clattered to the hearth, forgotten.
The taller man, who was also slightly older, glared at him with such intensity he began to feel a prickle of sweat forming on his skin. “Get him off the floor, for God’s sake.”
It started out reasonably well. In fact, the past few days have been tolerable. Sherlock, apparently keen to earn access to his violin, has been making a more than admirable effort to calm himself. He sets himself small goals—to finish reading a chapter; to complete a letter to Mrs. Hudson—and I cannot praise him highly enough each time he succeeds. When he does not, I rather pointedly do not pass comment.
“My love,” I murmured, pressing myself against his slender yet half-cleaned body, “every single thing that you do encourages—entices—
“Would you ever consider re-marrying?” I inquired—with my friend’s amused acceptance of my impetuous questions and second glass of claret cup I now had thrown decorum to the wind—and I charged our glasses yet again.
She looked at him sharply, then tipped her head towards their patient, but her concern was unwarranted. Having finished his milk, he was now using the last bit of the chocolate mousse as ink and his finger as a pen, writing some sort of equation on the polished surface of the table and seemingly ignoring them entirely.
“I have no empirical knowledge of infants,” he reported gravely (I really did laugh at this), “but I do know that cats and dogs enjoy closeness such as this. Mrs. Hudson’s cat purrs when she is curled up on her lap.”
He is an idiot—he is an idiot for going off on his own, and for frightening me. Yes, he is in glorious high spirits, but really, I did not appreciate the manner of his return to our rooms. I have put him to bed but am too distracted to join him just yet. I will have a bit more brandy and then see if the mood strikes me.
He rolled onto his back and blearily opened his eyes. She could see them glisten in the dim light of the single lamp she had turned on (other than her booklight, of course—she could not have survived the years of night shifts without it).
“Really? How indiscreet... of our landlady, and the thousands like her, who take in lodgers to support themselves.”
A servant brought up a tray a while ago, with supper for myself and Henry. I ate in order to sustain myself and now, although it was just a few hours past, I do not recall what it was that I consumed. I have sent instructions back to the kitchen—he will need a nourishing but bland breakfast.
It left him tied to an uncomfortable, narrow bed in a filthy room occupied by three loud, drunk students, not quite completely covered by a hideous, rough, cheap duvet that smelled strongly of the last time he and Victor had been together—a pungent mixture of body odour, cigarettes, and semen.
He glanced up then and smiled rather affectionately at us. “Mycroft!” he cried, as if unexpectedly meeting up with a dear friend after a long separation. “Have you come to see me off?”
“I mean that if someone commits a crime and escapes the country in the night to avoid persecution, that is usually done suddenly and without premeditation. If someone emigrates to make his fortune in the gold mines or the railroads, or whatever it is they do in America, they probably have thought about it at least a bit before striking out. What you have proposed is neither.”
. He was wearing his brother’s pyjamas and deodorant and sitting on the sofa in his bedroom (and how pretentious was that—having a bedroom large enough for a desk
I gave him a moment, sipping my sherry and watching the firelight dance across his fine features. Then I broke into his reverie. “Sherlock,” I said quietly, “may I interrupt?”
As I listened to her describe the odd man who had come inquiring for Sherlock’s services a few days ago (which is what had prompted her wielding her “weapon”), I gazed around our rooms.
He did not reply. Instead, he dropped his newspaper and bowed his head down until his chin met his chest. “I was trying to write you a letter.”
“I don’t get into trouble!” was the indignant response. He made quick work of the box, extracting a ring of twelve balls about an inch and a half in diameter each. They were arranged in pairs of colours—two red, two orange, and so on—to create a circular rainbow. He gave it a tentative tweak—and was delighted when the shape he made stayed.
up.” She indicated the inert lump next to me, just the dark, tousled curls peeking out from beneath the bedclothes.
Solomon arrival at eight o’clock was either at the most opportune time or the worst, depending on one’s point of view. Winifred was grateful to see him. “Good morning,” she sighed. “Can you give me a hand?”
Mycroft assisted his brother in completing his own packing—he would get distracted so constantly, and change his mind about what he would take so often—that he couldn’t make any more progress.
How stupid did they think he was? First, they try to strap him to whatever torture device that was—waterboarding? Probably. Then, when he managed to extract himself they…
Where they really discussing him as if he weren’t there? He tried protesting, but somehow after he managed to open his mouth, he found himself unable to form words. Was it because he didn’t have control over his lips and tongue? Or was it because he didn’t have control over the words themselves? He wasn’t entirely sure.
Sometimes no one dared enter the room for fear of being hit by whatever the young man had seized as a projectile.
“Oh, aye,” he acquiesced. “Get on now!” he called out to his horse, and with a flick of the reins we sped away from the tidy house with the unexpected place settings for two so neatly laid out on the spotless dining room table.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock was finding it difficult to form words. God, whatever Victor had given him was lovely. His brain was barely controlling his autonomic functions, let alone racing out of control the way it usually did.
“Uh…” Christopher shrugged helplessly. It did sound rather implausible read out in a list like that. “Maybe?”
Christopher put a calming hand on her shoulder. “He… the only way I can describe it… God, Winifred. He tried to
His brother’s voice was rough with emotion. His next words seemed to cause him physical pain.  “Sherlock, you know what I had to do with our mother. And as abhorrent an idea as it is, you know that I will have no choice. If you do not show signs of improvement, I will have no choice but to commit you to a lunatic asylum.”
This resulted in Mycroft discovering that despite his shaking hands, his brother still possessed the ability to make a definitive—and rather rude—gesture.
“Ah. My brother has not mentioned me, I take it. May I?” He indicated his hat and motioned toward the rack by the door.
He sulked for a second or two more before continuing. “Mrs. Bloom is in the habit of going to the countryside to visit a relative fairly regularly. Her visits generally last a week, and sometimes she is away a fortnight, leaving Mr. Bloom to a bachelor existence and entirely alone for the duration.”
“It is because—we are intimate, my love, and your activities sometimes bring to mind our private times together.”
He thought for a few seconds. “Perhaps this will suffice.” He moved so he was in sight of the one good eye. “Sherlock,” he said firmly. “Hydrogen.”
I am sure that by now you have ascertained the point of this letter—and the nature of the error which Mr. Holmes—and you and I—made.
killing him sometimes takes a great deal of self-control. We have impulses, you see—we all do—we all have
“A bit more reading?” the nurse offered. He nodded, sliding one knuckle into his mouth and chewing on it thoughtfully. “Let’s get you cleaned up first.”
There was a quiet knock. The door to the corridor was open—Mrs. Hudson had left it that way when she had brought up the breakfast tray, obviously noting that we were, for once, decently dressed and decently engaged. Our landlady now stood there.
Oh, the wasted time at the beginning! Those early, hesitant attempts of his to express his feelings for me. I was a blind man, even to my own impulses. How could I have not seen it? How did I, for so long, deny it?
“Do you think it would be more efficacious to go through an agency?” I asked, listening to him rummaging about in the next room.
Little ‘Lock had fallen asleep on the floor in front of the fire, his pistol in one hand and his telescope in the other.
“Poisons, huh? Mrs Parker won’t like hearing you refer to her cooking like that,” Christopher teased lightly, even though he felt anything but light-hearted. “Good job, Sherlock. Good talking,” he managed to add, keeping his voice calm.
“What else do you have?” I asked in a rather cavalier fashion. “You can hardly turn us in based on my admittedly boorish behaviour towards my wife.”
prove a great many things that she had written in her letter to me. We had already discussed certain elements of the situation during our conversation with the Blooms, but now I considered the situation methodically, murmuring my ruminations as I continued to rub my darling’s thin back.
It was not the first time I had tended to the Thatcher family. There had been other injuries and illnesses, including the passing of elderly Mr Thatcher. I had been under a misapprehension early in our acquaintance that he was her father, but I learned after I treated him for a bad chest that he was actually her father-in-law. Miss Thatcher was really Mrs Thatcher, and I finally did meet her husband, who worked at the brewery and so was usually out hours before I rose.
She winced as Mycroft abruptly rose. She could have phrased that more delicately, she realised—or not asked at all.
I am grateful for the—for lack of a better word—guards posted in the corridor at all times. Sometimes it is Mycroft’s own servants and sometimes it is strangers experienced in such illnesses. The windows are barred and the doors to the corridor locked. If he was more himself I would not put it past him to obtain egress regardless, but as he is now, he cannot gather his thoughts enough to muster the concentration required to pick the locks.
“Now, as we were discussing, I have brought your violin from Baker Street, but it is to remain safe with your brother until you are well enough to handle it.”
There on the threshold stood a man nearly as arresting in appearance as my friend. He was taller, but had the same lean frame and sharp features. His hair was dark and trimmed neatly. He was clean-shaven but sported somewhat old-fashioned, modest sideburns. He did not share Sherlock’s ivory-toned skin, but he was certainly not ruddy, either. He was, however, as impeccably dressed as Sherlock ever was—and he most certainly had the same piercing and queer grey eyes.
I nodded in understanding. The subject brought to mind the excellent Violet Hunter and one of our earliest cases together, at that dismal house five miles outside of Winchester. She had been put into that not just grotesque but ultimately quite dangerous situation specifically because she had been working with the Westaway’s agency.
I reflected on that then and more now. The poor woman certainly knows about our untidy-bordering-on-indecent attire. She knows that I use gentle massage on my friend’s head when he is in pain. She knows how intimate we must be when I am treating him for illness or injury.
He was skeletally thin, white as a sheet, battered, filthy. One eye was swollen shut. The other, once keen and piercing, was glassy and red.
He had a large case open on his bed, and was rather haphazardly pulling articles of clothing out of his wardrobe and dresser and placing them in it.
Sherlock’s knees buckled and I was grateful that I was standing so close; I caught him and guided him to the bed, seating him and, not even thinking about it, crouched in front of him. I grasped his hands in mine and pulled them onto his lap.
to know any different, she most certainly would not implicate us. Defending her slightly mad, violin-playing tenant to the neighbours is one thing. Admitting that she is knowingly harbouring two criminals is another.
And so there he was, stretched out before me and positively beaming at something he had detected. He easily pulled himself upright and hopped down from the sill to the floor, landing lightly on the balls of his feet. He caught my eye and his grin widened. “Oh, this is a fascinating one, my dear friend,” he declared, unselfconsciously brushing the seat of his trousers with a free hand, and then he startled me by suddenly reaching toward me. “What’s this?” he exclaimed, pulling the chair next to which I was standing away from the table. “Have you counted the forks yet?”
And now that I have written all of this I still cannot explain to myself the reason I offered him my lap in the first place.
“I have not been able to detect any connection between her and the omnibus driver, so no, not a murderess.” The seriousness with which he offered this statement set me laughing again.
“How about an orange?” the older brother suggested. He considered him curiously, then looked to the nurse for approval before nodding slowly.

yourself. You will rise and retire at decent hours. You will dress yourself—completely—every morning. You will eat a reasonable amount at every meal. You will not perform any experiments that will stain anything or suffocate us.”
What Mycroft Holmes has proposed is this: In his house there is this suite of two adjoining rooms, with a dressing room in between (that boasts an immense bath with hot and cold taps—a glorious thing), that are considered Sherlock’s. What he had done previously and what he has done now was to order that they be stripped down to the bare minimum—all breakable objects to be removed—and Sherlock and I have moved into them. Mycroft’s servants and special attendants hired for the circumstances will be posted day and night out in the corridor or even in the rooms themselves if it is necessary—and they will quite simply watch Sherlock and prevent him from injuring himself or escaping.
Under the influence of the drug, he became sluggish and malleable—Henry was able to get him into a clean vest and shirt, and wiped his face with a cloth. He put up no protest as I held a cup of tea to his lips—even his hands had not been heavily bandaged, he seemed now too weak to manage even that. And then—thankfully—he fell asleep.
He watched as his brother’s chin fell to his chest. He seemed to be searching within himself; going deep down into his mind.
“Yeah. They got him back, but he had gotten hold of a scalpel, and… damn. This hurts. That mark on his leg. You know?”
“Leave him alone. Grab a chair.” Victor indicated a small stack of folding chairs leaning up against a wall. They looked suspiciously like they had been liberated from… well, the local funeral director was likely not pleased. They were erected around the tiny table. Victor produced a pack of cards, each grabbed a bottle of beer, and they began to play.
Mycroft thought bitterly as he grasped one track-marked arm. “Calm down. These are doctors. They’re just trying to help,” he explained. “They need to examine you so they can make you feel better, all right?”
Then he deliberately pushed the thought out of his head. He didn’t need to go there. He had been going there far too often lately.
“Do not lie to me, John,” he said softly. “And please leave me. I do not wish to be with you at present.”
“Well, to be honest, my love—yes. Not often,” I hastened to amend, “but observing you—God, Sherlock—you have the most enticing body I have ever encountered. That I have seen it bare and have partaken of its delights make it even harder—” I stopped myself. Had I really said that?
“No wonder you were not eating. It always makes you lose what little appetite you have.” I was angry at him—partly because of his insidious habit and partly because he was being so evasive. I wanted him to admit it.
But ignorance it was, and Sherlock’s inability to articulate his torment—the nature of it, the cause, even the lengths of these fits that seized him…
She had seen him ill. She had seen him strung out. She had seen him going through withdrawals. She had seen him angry and moody and distraught and violent.
She laughed—a warm, affectionate chuckle. “Oh, please do not feel so uncomfortable!” she cried. “I am not one of those women who believe that being over or under a certain number of years has any great significance. I was eighteen years old when I married and nineteen when I had our son. He passed away not long before his tenth birthday.”
“Yes, I mean actually sit here in my lap so that we may talk.” As I pen these words, I am once again feeling rather odd about the whole thing. I still have no idea what possessed me, but possess me it did, and I was determined to have him in my chair with me.
My chest suddenly felt tight. I kissed the crown of dark curls. “I knew he was cruel in his words and attitude towards you, but why have you never shared with me that he was also so hard on you in this manner?”
So, there he was, trying to impress Dr John Watson—who had as a total bonus been in the army; what did he look like in uniform? —without frightening him away—and then it had occurred to him—he couldn’t. He couldn’t frighten him away. The man was attracted to danger. And it was that—exactly that—that made him so very desirable.
He was running his fingers (always so delicate—a musician’s fingers, or a scientist’s?) across the hearth, tracing the outlines of the bricks. He glanced up, once, and for a second—or less—Mycroft thought he saw something. It was the merest suggestion of an expression—that thoughtful but calm look he recalled most often when his brother was deeply engaged in a chemistry text—what he thought of as the “real” Sherlock—his little brother—whom he had missed more than he could ever say.
“Nonsense. It will make you feel so much better, and I am quite serious—as your doctor there is nothing more I can do for you at present but to clean you up and cool you off.”
The nurse bustled into the room, carrying a dressing gown. “Dere you are! Slippery t’ing.” She shook her head, obviously more amused than concerned. “Put dis on.”
I braced myself. What would her demands be? Money? Public confession of my sins? Turn myself in? This was the moment I had been dreading all this time. Is this how Sherlock felt when faced with the inevitability of his death on that precipice at the Reichenbach Falls?
We had been roused from our bed that morning (it had been just past nine o’clock but I hadn’t gotten to bed before one o’clock and Sherlock had tumbled in to join me sometime after four) by the energetic ringing of the bell. I rolled over, unwinding Sherlock’s long arms from around my chest and shoulders, and slid out from under the blankets. I immediately hurried to my own bedroom before the familiar steps of our landlady began to ascend the steps that led to our rooms.
He hummed and nuzzled into my cheek. Excellent. Just the direction I was hoping this conversation would go. “John?” he murmured.
“I was named after some great-great-great something Uncle Henry for some reason. I’ve never quite forgiven my parents for it,” she explained merrily. “Although it was rather prescient—he was an attendant in one of those old Victorian madhouses—a sort of psychiatric nurse, if you can believe it.”
I mouthed back. Both Holmes brothers were adept at reading lips in this fashion, and I had come a long way in developing my own skills at it, beginning with my need to sometimes capture the final words of a wounded soldier, so weak that audible speech was impossible for him.
I was confounded. I admit it. I had no idea that it was this thought that had him so distressed. My mouth fell open in shock, and then snapped shut. My poor, confused sweetheart. How could he possibly think that he could ever—
This attempt left him slightly light-headed and nauseated, but he calmed himself. If talking wasn’t working, time to try something new.
“He likes marmalade,” Mycroft told her quietly, “and cut the toast into soldiers. Just let my housekeeper know what you want.”
I am certain that you can imagine my horror upon reading your story and instantly recalling with deep regret my neglect. I am afraid that you and The Strand will be receiving letters of complaint and admonishment, and I wonder if there is any way in which I could rectify this situation in some way. Perhaps I could write to the magazine editor anonymously so that an explanation might be included in their next issue?
Your wife is not dead. She is living in New York under an assumed name. She is passing herself off as Mrs. Daniel Ryder. I do not know the man she claims to be her husband, and I do not believe that they are truly married.
Oh, he was not feeling well at all. He allowed her to help him up and get him into the bathroom. Damn. He hated being sick, but he didn’t seem to have much say in the matter. Stupid transport.
Mrs Parker had brought up cheddar-and-tomato sandwiches (crusts removed and cut into triangles) and milk; two small dishes with a rather daring apple-and-pear sort of relish. She knew that her boss wouldn’t be thrilled—some broiled fish and a glass of wine would have been his choice—but he would gamely consume the meal to both model for and encourage his brother. She was more than gratified when she went up to retrieve the dishes later and discovered them empty.
As expected, the younger man scowled at the nickname. John, who was crouching under the tree pulling out a few more wrapped gifts, glanced over his shoulder. “Hey,” he offered. “Looks like there’s a few more presents for you.”
“Most certainly not!” the woman snapped. I found it difficult to maintain my stoic countenance—for how could any acquaintance obtain a chapeau so flamboyant as to elicit envy in
“No one? Who do you mean?” I hoped that he was not referring to my old butcher or tailor, for that would mean I had been not just unseemly but at risk of arrest for being drunk in public.
“Are you certain that woman would be unable to prove any... less-than-lawful activities on our part?” I pondered aloud.
I have tried every distraction I can fabricate. At first I thought that long walks would disperse some of his excess energy, but those always seemed to turn out badly. His outbursts of temper and poor judgement during these times nearly always lead to some sort of fisticuffs or illegal activity. How many times has he been escorted home by two able-bodied policemen?
That was all I needed to hear. “Sherlock, I’ve got some splendid news for you,” I called out. “I will be going with you after all.”
“Don’t make a scene, Sherlock,” he said in a low voice. “Just get into the car. You’ve had enough of an adventure for one day. You’re still not well. You need your medication and something to eat. Wouldn’t that be better?”
“It’s been rougher than I thought,” the shorter man admitted in a low voice. “Too many people phoning and stopping by. You know how he is with that.”
“My sweetheart,” I whispered against his ear, “I wish for you to sleep for a while. Can you manage that?”
Mycroft felt a bit guilty, so he switched off his feed from the camera in the kitchen. Not that there was much to watch. He admitted to the slightest twinge of jealousy as he watched his brother devour the bacon butty. White bread, brown sauce, and streaky bacon were most definitely not on his list—but most assuredly were on Sherlock’s.
Ethereal features; whip-thin limbs—and an iron constitution. I do not exaggerate in my published stories when I describe the discrepancy between Sherlock’s appearance and his surprising strength. Without another word he nodded and swept her up in his arms, she making a few dignified squawks of protest. I walked very closely behind them, ready to catch them if he faltered, but he easily transported her up the steep kitchen steps.
“I do not believe so. She would not have gone this far in accusing us if she thought that it might somehow reveal such a terrible secret.”
“Exactly. Now, what changes would you expect a household to demonstrate if it has been reduced from two people to one? Recall that I was getting my information primarily from the shopkeepers.”
“Those things—those behaviours of ours—the way you treat my headaches, and my illnesses, and how we sometimes attire ourselves when we are alone—those are not typical behaviours for most men sharing diggings, are they?”
“I thought she would be… enthusiastic about trying something new. She seems so keen to learn in general.”
“I am simply not meant to be an invalid,” she admitted in mock despair. “Woe is me; I am committed to a life of activity.”
I was horrified. I found that my hands were shaking. I clutched the letter until it was quite a wadded mess.
He considered this as he observed my hand moving the flannel across his pale skin. “No,” he finally replied. He pondered a bit longer before adding, “Is it acceptable?” he now wondered. “As my doctor?”
Additionally, I had not been the one to invent the fiction that Mary was dead; that was my editor. No death certificate had been falsified by myself or anyone else.
Once he was on the bed, I resumed my position, arranging myself to cradle his head. I believe he had shocked himself into silence, and any extraneous motion was translated into a continuous shuddering from top to toe. I spoke to him again, telling him that we understood that he was not in control of his faculties. That I would tend to his wounded hands when he was in sufficient control of himself that we could release him from the sheet. That I knew that he had not intended to injure himself; that he had struck the window in frustration.
I did not enjoy my solitary breakfast one bit. As I had done the previous morning, I held a book in front of my eyes, but I did not absorb a single word. I had no appetite. I finally gave up and returned to my room, where I rather viciously threw my things in my bag and checked out. I was going home.
Christopher had taken a short break from reading—heading to the kitchen for a glass of water—and Mycroft took a good look at his brother. He was still stretched out on the carpet and, at that moment, he appeared not just completely relaxed but so very much himself. If it weren’t for the healing gash, still-swollen, reddened eye, and scraped knuckles, he could be lying on the floor of the sitting room in Baker Street—
He finished—three stitches—and sent off the young mother and son with follow-up instructions. Then he sat and wrote up his treatment notes—not that they were extensive—
We both had a good appetite, as it turned out, and finished our cold supper with alacrity. As we ate, we reflected on our outing.
About bloody time, John thought. As much as he loved a good argument, nothing could beat a good fight. He liked the odds, too.
how he got them. Not to me or most of the other nurses. We know that some are self-inflicted, but some of them… he’s been through a hell that very few people could even imagine. We just want to make him comfortable—make him feel safe.
Yes, that was it. That was what he had to do. He had to get away. His heart began to pound even harder as he took a deep, ragged breath through his mouth.
I was out when the trouble arose, and so found out about the whole incident second-hand. I had just returned home from a trip to the tobacconists and was hanging my hat when Mrs Hudson called out to me. I found her in her bedroom, her foot on a cushion.
Sherlock watched and waited for the nurse to pick his up and take a bite before doing likewise, but once started he essentially devoured it.
“He is his elder brother, and I am not supposed to talk about him, so I don’t know what else I am permitted to tell you. You will have to ask them. Shall I bring up some coffee?”
Very sweet. Extra sweet. He liked that. He wasn’t usually allowed to do that. Someone told him not to; that it was bad for him.
And then they unceremoniously dropped him on the bed, Malcolm threw the blanket he had ready over him, and they all exited the room before he could untangle himself. Sean fastened the bolt.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said—an odd, somewhat hollow tone to his voice, “I am sure that you are aware that your behaviour during this current fit has been the most extreme expression of your illness to date.”
“Not your best work,” Mycroft had admonished, fingering the olive-coloured fabric, “and really, Sherlock—M&S Collection? Your standards have slipped.” Oh, the shrug and the eye roll he had received—it nearly made him laugh.
“John, you yourself explained to me that there are certain signs that one exhibits, quite unconsciously, when one is... aroused.” His voice dropped with that last word. He can be funny about such subjects, even now, when we are so free with one another.
“I do not understand what one thing has to do with the other. What does my investigation of a crime scene have to do with our… being together?”
She does like receiving our letters even if, she admitted, Sherlock’s do not always make sense. She knows that he is desperately ill and that his brother and I are taking the best care of him that we can manage. Still, she does worry about him so, and then she was so very blunt.
“Get out. Now.” The nurse’s eyes opened wide at the ominous tone to Mycroft’s voice. She scrambled for her coat and bag. Then she looked hesitantly at the object he was holding. “Take it,” he seethed, nearly throwing her mobile at her. She fumbled and caught it, shoving it into her pocket. “Make sure you sign off,” he reminded her coldly, pointing at the clipboard on the table.
The long, white fingers made quick work of the paper, and then the bored expression changed. “Oh!” he exclaimed, looking interested despite himself. “That’s rather… neat.”
She had started slowly, offering to read the book to him. He had nodded, eagerly, and scrambled up onto the bed with it, patting the mattress to invite her to sit with him. She had done so, and for a bit it had been fine. She read to him (it was a book about snakes) and let him examine the photographs for a while.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” my darling called out. He was standing by the fireplace, fiddling with his pipe as she arrived with a covered tray.
The manor-house has been sold and what an immense weight was taken from my shoulders when that occurred.
I wish I had been so silenced one week ago. I am so heartily ashamed of my wicked, cruel tongue. I have tried to learn to restrain myself, but you more than anyone knows that I have failed miserably. I wish that I could take my cruel words back; that you could somehow un-hear them.
Dave stared as the older brother—impeccably dressed and impossibly pompous (seriously, he was nearly a caricature; did he wear a bowler hat and swing an umbrella when he went out?)—swept out of the room. “Is he for real?” he demanded.
“That’s right,” she encouraged. “These are for you.” She smiled as he eagerly accepted the brightly coloured box she held. “Go on. Open it. Shall I find some paper?”
Waiting in the blackness of that room; straining our ears to hear the peculiar whistle—and Sherlock instructing that I take the chair and him the bed—all of that I have faithfully recorded. I admit that I was momentarily disappointed by his instruction, wishing to be next to him, but swallowed my objections. As we were maintaining absolute silence, I could not have spoken anyway—but in fact in retrospect I was grateful for it, for, as I would learn later, Sherlock’s reason for this might have saved my life.
Sherlock buried his face in his pillows. It was a cold, rainy day and he didn’t want to set foot out of his cosy bed.
I found myself nearly blushing at his blunt words. “I am certain that Mrs. Bloom does not have occasion to avoid such things; she surely is not exposed to them,” I suggested.
We were out in the corridor; I had wanted to give Sherlock some privacy for a bath. It seemed unlikely that he would get himself into any mischief bathing himself—but we kept the door open and ears pricked for sounds of distress.
He glanced at her shyly and smiled in a guileless way, nodding. He replaced the green crayon in the box (she noticed that the crayons were arranged in a rainbow fashion), selected a maroon one, and meticulously began, brick by brick, to draw the wall that the ladder was leaning on.
Mycroft wandered into the library. He wanted to replay their dinner over and over in his mind, but he sensed that that would be a mistake. No sense in getting his hopes up about his brother’s state of mind. Yes, he had quite clearly recalled John Watson. Yes, it had been completely on his own; he had not led him on.
It was cream of tomato and he usually liked that. Someone used to make it for him. Who was that? It was on the tip of his tongue—the name was. The soup wasn’t. He did usually like it, but at that moment the thought of eating anything was making him feel horrid.
“He…” I paused and mentally inventoried his activities. “He hasn’t had a case in a while, and the last one was a bit mundane. I’ve been able to engage him in some minor scientific inquiries pertaining to my medical practice, but more and more often he’s seemed impatient with that. I regret to add that he has been indulging in his cocaine even more than usual, which, as it generally does, leads to impatience, sleepless nights—you know all this.”
It was equally impossible for him to keep to one topic; his ruminations took an increasingly convoluted path, and between that and the quickness of his speech—he had long ago abandoned full stops and now was losing the spaces between words—he was creating a labyrinth of images and topics that flowed into one another and turned around on themselves and went off on inexplicable tangents in a truly dizzying fashion.
I have no idea what set him off—whether it was this comment or the setting sun or—it could have been anything—but the effect was horrifying.
On the sixth, he pointed at the newspaper, and I happily began to read him the more interesting articles.
I knew that I should be beside him, taking notes and praising his efforts (that he preens and blushes so prettily when I do so always makes me laugh), but I was simply not up to the task—did I really just write that?
“I sent her after some sausage and things, and I made it clear that she was, absolutely, to return to us. I told her that she did not need to hurry, however—she needs some time to collect herself.”
And when Little ‘Lock wanted tea with Daddy, it was almost all milk and sugar and just the slightest hint of camomile or some other caffeine-free, herbal mixture because his sweet boy did not need the stimulation…
He ran his hand across each spread, rather oddly from right to left. Sometimes he would pause, and one long finger would tap a particular spot, and then he would move on. Sometimes he would linger at one location, thoughtfully rubbing it.
these urges that proves to be far more difficult. A man who becomes violent when drinking should, it seems, simply not take drink and all will be well, but for some men
They took a short break to exchange gifts; Sherlock had correctly predicted that he and John each would receive a hand-made item. John thought his new crocheted hat of dark-green wool was fine, but what delighted him was that she had made Sherlock elbow-length, extra-padded oven mitts—in purple.
That and feigning interest in the endless samples of hideously overly floral and fussy china; the unnecessarily heavy crystal goblets; and the ludicrous abundance of fish knives and ice cream spoons with elaborately detailed handles the cleaning of which would be any butler’s nightmare prevented me from examining, again and again and of course fruitlessly, my situation with Sherlock.
“Yes?” I encouraged quietly. She spoke so rarely about her husband and child, torn so unceremoniously from her by the horrible grasp of disease.
“I’m not a DI yet,” Greg pointed out. He looked at him carefully. “You just got out of rehab or somewhere,” he declared.
I was quite angry with him all day—but I was, I admit, equally concerned. We still knew so little about the affair—this morning, that is. I distracted myself with paying some bills and other rather dull tasks, but I admit that I also looked up the train schedule so I could possibly anticipate the time of his return.
After just those few days, I felt at ease with him—my life as well as Sherlock’s was essentially in his hands and by necessity privacy was a thing currently unknown. So, as we listened for anything alarming (and watched for a wet and bare Sherlock making an escape attempt; I certainly wouldn’t have been the slightest bit surprised), I asked him a bit about himself.
“I have perhaps described my inquiries inaccurately. No one outside of your club referenced any disorderly behaviour.” He reached out and laid his hand on my shoulder.
In a short time, Mrs Parker announced, “The bacon’s all lovely and crispy. Come sit down.” They both made their way to the table. Now they watched as she slathered a thick layer of brown sauce on slices of white bread, then carefully added the perfectly-crisped bacon. “Would you like one?” she asked the nurse.
The nurse now on duty was another new one. Christopher was short and somewhat stocky and had ginger hair and freckles. When Mycroft returned to the first floor, his brother was seated on the sofa in his bedroom and, rather surprisingly, attending to the young man as he reviewed the notes on the ever-present clipboard. The nurse was speaking to Sherlock in a calm, natural tone, commenting on some of the notes regarding his behaviours—not in a challenging or condescending way, but more as if he was simply getting to know a new acquaintance. He purposely referred to both Solomon and Winifred by name. Clever, he thought—he trusted those two nurses now, so perhaps this would make adjusting to a new attendant a bit easier.
“A great deal of soft tissue damage; infection,” reported another doctor. “We’ve taken blood samples and started him on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He really should be in hospital. It would be much easier to continue examinations and treatment.”
“That is what nightshirts are for,” he explained carefully in that “this is rather obvious” voice of his.
“That would be most gracious of you—and we will remunerate you for your assistance, of course. Now,” I continued before she could utter an objection, “I am woefully unaware of what exact tasks are required. Mrs Hudson will have to instruct you.”
He had also been warned, upon his arrival (the security measures put him a bit on edge, but he supposed anyone who could afford a house like that would have a great need for such measures), that his patient was currently not interested in the convention of being clothed.
Sherlock polished off his glass and rose, reaching out. “More?” he asked, indicating John’s now-empty glass.
He was having a bit of trouble with his balance and couldn’t manage his usual pace at all, but maybe that was a good thing—he’d be less noticeable that way, wouldn’t he?
I began to feel slightly ill. “Come sit here with me,” I requested, dropping the second empty glass on the table and holding my arms open. He had apparently been waiting for this invitation, for he was in my lap almost before the words were out of my mouth. As always, I arranged his long limbs until we were both comfortable. I rubbed his thin back through his dressing gown and thought about the situation. Finally, the thoughts swirling through my head coalesced. The conversation had not gone in the direction I anticipated, and it was time I got us headed in a more useful direction.
For even as he succumbed to the effects of the sedative, his brother—whip-thin, scarred, starved, doped-up, strung out, beautiful, brilliant
Sherlock took a deep, shuddering breath, his lower lip (which in addition to being split and swollen was horribly chapped) trembling.
I nodded dumbly and seated myself across from my friend as his brother gracefully lowered himself into the wicker chair we generally used for clients.
“What about the two men—the ones who brought him to the police station?” Sean suggested. They had been discussing ways to discover where Sherlock had been and what he had been doing between his arrival on British soil and his retrieval.
To be perfectly honest, I was never impressed in the slightest with anything about you. I found your lack of dedication to your practice deplorable. I was not impressed with your service in the army, either. I have only heard horrid, disgusting things about the soldiers who were supposed to be representing the best of our Queen’s subjects, and I can only, based on my observations of your character, presume that you were one of the worst.
The prawn cocktail starter was a hit; it was perfectly acceptable to eat them with one’s fingers and no one expected him to try the tomato-ketchup-based dipping sauce.
I do not now and apparently never have—except from a distance—wanted the frippery and frills of a woman in my life. More than anything, that was the downfall of my marriage.
He considered his options. Yes, it was clear that Sherlock was speaking the truth—he truly did not recall a thing about his two years away, and sometimes even his life before that seemed to slip from his grasp.
Then, unfortunately, even in his agitated state of mind, he began to truly assess the situation, peering keenly out the window at the streets. Finally, he looked around sharply and demanded of his brother: “This is not… where are you taking me?”
“Why is he like that?” Mycroft hissed. “He seemed more alert earlier.” The older brother had been closed in his home office but had emerged a short time ago, clearly wanting nothing more than to shower and lie down.
“What was that?” the older man leaned toward him slightly; his brother had attempted to say something. “Take your time.”
And now, both men found themselves somewhat uneasy. They were continuing to monitor everywhere for signs of crimes of a certain type—Mr Holmes was keenly interested in kidnappings, for example—but they knew that ultimately, they would have to go backward. They needed to work through it all again, vigilant about any sightings of the younger brother—sightings they had missed the first time around.
“I didn’t fall, John,” he declared solemnly despite shivering in delight at the feel of the doctor’s inquisitive tongue on his skin. “I sacrificed epidural cells in pursuit of various personal and professional goals.”
Mycroft Holmes might want to have the sofa re-upholstered when this was all done, Winifred reflected.
“My poor darling,” I murmured. “I would like nothing more than to help make you comfortable. You cannot possibly offend me, for it is only by good, honest labour that you find yourself thus. I suspect that a sponge and towel will help immensely.”
His maid scurried behind us, rather agape at the entire morning’s proceedings, but she blew smartly enough on her whistle and almost immediately a cab was before us.
He sighed. I patted his shoulder but did not interrupt. After a few deep breaths, he went on. “I laid my hand upon his knee.”
Yes. She could see it now. It wasn’t just that he was silent; it wasn’t just that he was engaged in activities that were usually considered childish. It was—everything. The way he moved; the way he tipped his head and pushed at the books. The way he sprawled on the floor now, beaming as he opened one of the books and began to look at the pictures.
We sat that way for a while, discussing his observations and deductions regarding the ventilator and false bell-rope. I was touched that he expressed his concern over my safety and gratified that I could assure him of my assistance—we were both positive that a terrible crime was on the verge of being committed. Finally, I could stand the anxiety in his voice no longer.
John surveyed the sitting room. There were plates from breakfast still on the desk and empty mugs of coffee and hot chocolate perched around the room, with bits of wrapping paper strewn everywhere, adding a festive air.
The doctor’s attempt to ascertain orientation and his ability to recall information did make Mycroft smile. He couldn’t help it. “It’s no use,” he finally interceded. “He has no idea who the prime minister is or what month it is on the
“There is more. Apparently, not only do they not have children of their own, but both Mr. and Mrs. Bloom become extremely flustered when anyone inquires about this particular fact.”
“I have never wished for you to be one, Sherlock,” I told him honestly. Yes, I had (and sometimes still do) flirt with the ladies I encounter. My admiration, particularly of their beauty and delicacy and elegant sense of dress, comes across in my published works—but in all honesty, it is the same admiration I feel for a particularly fine painting, or composition, or piece of writing. Yes, I did know the touch of a woman—but it was the rough hand of a common whore I had stumbled across in my once-frequent visits to Whitechapel and to whom I had handed twice the usual number of coins. Yes, I had had a wife, many years ago, and yes, we had—I cannot in honesty say “enjoyed” our marital relations, but we did engage in them.
I always forget how heavenly it is to be thus—in bed with my darling. I had stripped us both of any extraneous garments, so now I felt his cool skin against mine. I kissed his beautiful face and neck and shoulders, then settled down with his frail frame in my arms.
That evening he spat out half a dozen spoonsful of the broth into his napkin—I had gently introduced each but, as he had stated, he seemed unable to swallow—and I was beginning to despair when, with an immense effort, he allowed some of the liquid to slip down his throat. After that, it was a bit easier, but he had consumed very little before he shook his head and I knew that he could manage no more at that time.
“We will—this very night,” I professed. “As soon as we see the signal, we shall positively fly there, and I am certain that we will be in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”
We sat just like that for a while. I reached up and stroked his hair, free of any attempts at taming it, and rubbed my hand along his bony back. He sat quietly; I could feel his breath on my neck. Finally, I broke the silence. “I really am home again,” I assured him, “and I do know that you are truly sorry for what you said. Now, shall you help me to unpack?”
We have breakfasted. Well, I have; Sherlock toyed with some toast and had some coffee, then pushed himself away from the table with an impatience that has become so familiar as to be commonplace these days. He is now involved in reading the newspapers Mycroft has had delivered to us. Well, he is attempting to read them. As so often happens now, he cannot concentrate on any piece for more than a few seconds. His eyes flit over and across; up and down—sometimes alighting on a headline and sometimes on an inconsequential detail such as the comparative quality of the paper on which each is printed. He rustles the pages and turns from one to another edition constantly.
“We must discuss this with Mrs. Hudson,” he murmured as I operated the taps. “Do you think it terribly expensive?” He was referring, of course, to the miraculous tap that, when turned, released hot water into the bathtub.
His name is Henry; his accent is something from the north. He stands upright but easily; never stiff. He is muscular but not as massive as some of the others; it brings to mind a Percheron as opposed to the Clydesdale draught-horses who otherwise attend us.
It is baffling, really. They are the same words, every single time. How can they lift me up at one reading and bury me the next?
“There is more than enough,” he had replied coolly, waving a languid hand at the plate in front of him.
“I’ve selected several books, but my eyes are bothering me. I can’t seem to read without giving myself a headache,” he explained.
Mycroft introduced himself. He knew that he sounded and looked stiff and uncomfortable. He couldn’t help it; it was habit more than anything. His little brother frowned at him and then reached a trembling hand out for the clipboard. The nurse relinquished it readily.
“The new ones?” No wonder he was in a mood. They had been very nice gloves, of dove grey. He was so fussy about his costume and had been particularly pleased with them. “I am sorry to hear that.”
Numbers—years—were still rattling around in my head, and I clearly have been living with Sherlock for far too long, because the question sprang from my lips heedless of decorum. I am still, as I write this, burning with shame, but I must record here my terrible question.
, he reflected instead, wrinkling his nose as images of cards, trees, fairy lights, roasts, sprouts, and puddings danced in his...
“That is my point. He is a husband singularly disinterested in his wife, and that is because he prefers to be with men.”
“True,” the government man nodded. When he had turned up, his brother hadn’t had anything—not a pound; not a wallet even. No mobile. Certainly no passport(s).
“And she is. Without a doubt. The salmon she made the other day was delightful. I noticed that Himself quite enjoyed it, in particular.”
“I don’t wish to speak about it any longer. If you don’t need me anymore—you should be able to identify the estate agent who’s been doing those valuations fairly easily with everything I’ve given you—I…” He paused. “There are places I can stay…” He scowled. “There are some people I need to contact.”
“You also realise that, no matter what, it’s going to be different. You’ve been gone two years. People have got on with their lives.”
It had to have been a woman who introduced the not just feminine but decidedly marital-related items to the bachelor’s home. How very, very odd.
“Yes… of course. Just went down the wrong pipe,” I replied, clearing my throat. “So a poisoner but not a murderess?”
The pale, dark-haired man on the bed was slowly bringing himself into an upright position. He clutched the blanket spread over him, looking at it rather dazedly. He redirected his gaze—looking first at Christopher and then at Matilda.
“What isn’t?” I asked, drawing my hand through the water, swirling the hot water into the cooler, which was murky with the soap and dirt I had removed from his pale skin.
The letter appeared in the usual fashion, with the rest of the post. I sorted through everything and placed Sherlock’s letters on his desk, then seated myself at my own desk and opened mine. I wasn’t expecting anything except the usual bills.
“You like chocolate?” Winifred asked him, steadying the hand that held the glass of milk. He did not respond in any way except to continue to work on the biscuits. He chewed agonizingly slowly.
“Is there cake?” he asked, and I was not certain if I wished to laugh or to cry—for he spoke in his old voice, and it was steady and sensible and calm.
John stared dismally at the contents of the cupboard. He turned to the fridge and was equally uninspired. He had fully intended to bring a packed lunch to work, but nothing seemed terribly portable.
“Mrs Turner. Mrs Hudson must stay off her feet until she is healed, and we are considering who might assist in the running of the house.”
“Now, I presume you have my correspondence somewhere?” I inquired as we returned to our sitting room.
“Well, Sherlock, what do you think about that? I’ve had a fine time with you, but I’ve got to be off. Etta here will take care of you. And you will behave yourself, won’t you, for her? You’ve been lovely all day.”
And what of the fork? Why of all things had she chosen that—and why had she affixed the bloom to the seat of the chair when she could have simply laid it on the place setting? Like the ascent through the window, driving the fork through the upholstered chair seat had taken a vigorous effort. Whoever she was, she clearly had a message to deliver that could not be conveyed with a visitor’s card.
