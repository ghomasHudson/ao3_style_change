John also produces a piece of hard yellow cheese that they eat in thin slivers with their torn off hunks of bread. It’s wonderfully salty with a pleasant nutty flavor.
John pulled the door of the luxurious bathroom wide, but as he did, there was a scuffle of movement and a shout. John looked up just in time to see Sherlock fall back against the wall, blood running out of his mouth.
As the taxi made its way through the London streets back to Baker Street, Sherlock struggled to assess the degree to which John’s rage had subsided.
By the time the cab pulled up outside 221B the rain had stopped, but a bank of dark clouds hung low and threatening on the horizon, heavy with the promise of more rain. Baker Street was obscured by long stretches of water, the gutters transformed into tiny rushing streams.
Sherlock made a humming sound of disbelief, his mouth caressing the back of John’s ear. He licked the inner whorl lingeringly. “Really…” His breath was a warm tide against the side of John’s throat. “How so?”
It's a small sort of hut—maybe triple the size of Sherlock’s narrow berth on the ship—square in shape, its pointed roof thatched with what look to be dried palm fronds, the walls made of some kind of woven plant material. There’s no door per se but a door-shaped entryway that faces the ocean.
He hates to think of them watching his interaction with her. He wonders if his petty jealousy was visible from all the way across the tavern.
John is still looking down at him, and Sherlock wishes he could communicate somehow this fragile, growing excitement to John.
“You said Lieutenant Deverall and Lieutenant Dimmock were the only two officers present when the steward brought the drinks over—is that true? Or was Lieutenant Lestrade with them as well?”
He slides his uninjured hand down over his belly, fingers tangling in the hair at his groin before he reaches to take himself in hand.
Sherlock feels a renewed surge of panic at the loss of contact between them, and a fresh wave of shame that he would dare put John’s life at risk in speaking to him.
He stuffs the paper into the front of his jacket and returns to where he was standing, just as Ferguson re-appears again, now with a clay pipe in hand.
“Don’t be tedious, John.” Sherlock let out an exasperated breath against John’s neck. John stiffened at the sensation. “Is this about the bed sheets? I told you, you only have to wait five more hours.”
“I shouldn’t have asked you about your family. I didn’t realize how much they’d hurt you. But I should have guessed…”
“There’s so much I want to give you. Sometimes I can’t—” His voice catches and he looks away, overcome. He draws a sharp breath, seems to steady himself, but when he looks back up, Sherlock can see something fierce and sorrowful glittering in his eyes. “This will have to do for now.”
John lets go of himself, lifting his hand away, and Sherlock leans forward, replacing John’s small competent fingers with his own longer, paler ones. He leaves them there for a moment without moving them, just feeling, feeling every inch of John under his hand.
John stops Sherlock’s mouth with his, drinking down the sound, curling his finger again and moving it now against the same place.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, his head inclined over their hands, as though considering their interconnected fingers. He hadn’t moved his hand from John’s grip. John could feel warmth returning to Sherlock’s fingers thanks to the contact with his own.
, Sherlock thinks, taking note of the strength of John’s open shoulders, the slight lift in his chin.
The cup re-emerged, now half empty, and John caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s face as he lifted up the corner of the pillow to hand it back to John.
“You don’t understand! You can’t—you can’t want me. Moriarty was right. I’m… I’m an animal. God look at me! I can’t—I’m not like you. I can’t keep my body under control. It doesn’t… I’m not…”
“He was… he was everything to me. As you can probably imagine, I was never very popular at school. Everyone around me was slow and stupid and dull. And jealous of me for being better than they were at everything. I skipped two grades the first year I started, so I was surrounded by students who were older than me and stupider than ever. I was small for my age, and strange, and I didn’t belong and they knew it. They feared me and resented me. So they were cruel to me in the way that only children can be.”
“He did. Fortunately, the hole leads to the space directly underneath her bed. He stayed under there the whole time until he crawled back through to my room—it was only for a few minutes.”
he asks for he but he cannot answer and then John’s voice is melting away too, despite how Sherlock tries to reach for it, to hold onto it in the burning darkness.
Sherlock is concerned the girl might actually faint, but before her swoon can take effect, the Lieutenant has stepped in to take his hands in hers.
He can’t not see it now—the way John cares for him. Sherlock is not simply imagining it. It is real, as real as the presence of John’s hand on Sherlock’s forehead.
A bubble of relief welled in his chest. If Sherlock was texting him it meant he had yet to be apprehended by Moriarty or either of the Briggs.
He rotated his shoulder cautiously and then flexed his arm, trying to ascertain the depth of the cut. It was bleeding freely now, soaking the sleeve of his shirt, but that was more than likely a result of the rain.
), then it probably isn’t such a good idea for him to remain in command of the ship. And the only way to remove him from his position is to prove it.
“So when you say you used to fantasize about me in the bath, does that mean…?” John let the question hang in the dripping air between them, unfinished.
Sherlock is the first to move—even if he hates himself for breaking the moment—but he knows they’ve already taken far too many risks and they can’t afford to spend another moment like this. The realization that they just did what they did in the middle of the day on the lower gun deck is only now creeping over Sherlock with a kind of belated cold dread.
He felt the shudder that went through Sherlock in response and this time, he kissed him for real, tongue sinking into the wet heat of Sherlock’s mouth to stroke the length of his tongue, one hand still on the back of Sherlock’s neck to tug him closer.
When he speaks his voice is rougher than it was before. “God, Sherlock. That was…” He shakes his head. “It was much more than all right.”
With a tense feeling in his stomach, Sherlock thinks back to the song he heard John singing last night on deck. From afar, it seemed to Sherlock that nothing at all was wrong, that John was as jovial and light-hearted as ever, but John has the double burden of feeling what he’s feeling and also being charged with hiding it.
“Sherlock…” He feels John turn on his side next to him, and reach for his hand. Sherlock lets John take it but he continues staring at the ceiling. “Sherlock, love, look at me.”
Sherlock slid off the couch and came towards him slowly, carefully, his movements underscored with studied grace. John didn’t like it. Least of all because it made Sherlock look like a panther, elegant, leonine, unaffected—the blue silk of his dressing gown fluttering behind him like a cool wave; or like some god that had casually descended to earth to interact with the babbling mortals that fell to pieces in his wake. His features could have been carved from marble they were so impassive. He had clearly showered not long before as his hair was still wet. Even the disarray of his dark curls against his pale forehead looked studied to John, and all the poise and arrogance in his demeanor made John want him more than ever, even as the realization filled him with rage.
He cannot possibly leave his cabin now; he cannot face the inquiring, judgmental stares of the other passengers, the whispers, the murmured comments that will have doubled in frequency.
Hating himself, John squeezed Sherlock’s hand once more, before pulling his hand back into his own lap.
Sherlock licked the slit of John’s cock, his hand stroking up to join his mouth before pumping back down, his mouth mimicking the movement directly after, this time taking John even deeper, creating the same luscious suction as he enveloped John in warm, wet heat.
John kisses his way down Sherlock’s belly, his mouth hot and sucking—fiercer now than it was before, as though he wants to lay claim to Sherlock by the touch of his mouth—biting soft pink blossoms into Sherlock’s white skin, leaving a trail of flushed marks that make Sherlock shake and grip hard against the edge of the desk.
John broke away from Sherlock’s mouth, panting, as Sherlock’s fingers slid down the length of him—the feeling of Sherlock’s exquisitely shaped fingers pressing into the sensitive skin of his cock almost too much for him to take. He felt lightheaded, and he dropped his head back against the wall once more and shut his eyes as the room spun around him.
I am posting this now in a bit of rush, but! If you want to know more about the mysterious instrument Sherlock falls in love with, and what the music sounds like that Sherlock hears in this chapter, I will be back later to post some links in this space! So please check back again if you are curious. :)
“Scrubbing the decks every morning. They call it holystoning because we have to get down on our hands and knees to do it—someone thought at some point it looked as if we were kneeling down in prayer.”
But he kept his eyes open, fixed on the outline of Sherlock’s inclined head. He fought to keep his breathing even. “Why’s that?”
When he reaches his room, he latches the door behind himself, and stands for he does not know how long with his forehead pressed against the door, his breathing shallow and erratic, waiting for the feeling to subside—the compulsion to tear back up the stairs and cry out to John through the darkness, to pull John down from his post and into his arms, just so he can feel John’s body under his hands, feel his heart beat, alive and steady beneath his palms.
He cries out, his hips stuttering upwards and then freezing in midair as his body clenches hard around Sherlock’s finger and his release gushes into Sherlock’s mouth, the ocean pouring around them in the same moment, as if it, too, is participating in what’s unfolding between them.
In spite of the fact that he’s leaning half-dressed against a tower of cables in the dripping bowels of a ship, his shirt soaked through with sweat, cheeks flushed as though with fever, Sherlock has never felt better.
From where he’s standing on the edge of the crowd, he cannot see who’s playing it. His view is blocked by the foremast. He creeps closer—as quietly and unobtrusively as possible—so as not to shatter the particular stillness of the atmosphere.
“I think I’ll wait to take this bit last. I know how you cherish it, how worthless you would be without it.”
Anderson heard them, which means he must have been close at hand—listening. They were too loud this time—that much is certain, but not loud enough to be heard over the sounds of the party if someone was still on deck, which means that Anderson must have come down to listen, that he may have been right outside in the corridor.
It took the better part of an hour and half for John to organize the chaos Sherlock had created and establish a methodological system for their search. As much as Sherlock could be tidy in his experiments, when it came to cases his order went out the window. He got too impatient, especially when he was close to getting the results he wanted, which is why it was a good thing John had an especially tidy mind.
He looked down again and saw Sherlock looking up at him through dark lashes, the bright slit of blue of his irises barely visible below his eyelids, heavy with lust. Judging by the expression of his face, he was just as overcome as John.
practices before being fed to your own dogs. But since I can’t have it my way, this is the best I can do.”
The ocean surges around them—the water is high enough now that it comes to their shoulders, before rushing back out again—and then John is laughing and rolling them over once more until Sherlock is on his back beneath him in the wet sand.
Sherlock feels a throb go through him at the thought of John, desperate for a moment of privacy in all those shouting, cursing, talking men. It never occurred to him to think that John would lack for privacy—he’s such a sociable man, always ready with an easy smile and a laugh; he clearly enjoys the company of others—but everyone needs privacy sometimes, even John.
“What? When?” John was suddenly horribly aware of Sherlock’s hands on his arms. “Don’t be ridiculous. No! No, of course not!”
He’s so happy to be playing again that he feels none of the anxiety that he felt the last time—and maybe it’s the alcohol in his blood calming his nerves, or maybe it’s the fact that he’s done this before, he knows these musicians, this crowd of cheering sailors gathered around—but whatever the reason, Sherlock feels almost immediately that same transcendent feeling overtake him—that warm, vibrant sensation in his chest quickening and spreading down through his limbs into the tips of his fingers until he feels that there’s no separation between him and his instrument, between himself and the music that’s pouring out of him.
John felt his cheeks fill suddenly with heat as a host of potential images flooded his mind—of what Sherlock might look like doing just that, at the thought of a nude and fantasizing Sherlock, one hand wrapped around himself as he visualized John in the bath. He was struck suddenly with an image of Sherlock, curled over his own lap, bowed over the slender curve of his own flexed arm as he stroked himself, thinking of John.
Outside, the wind clattered the tree branches against the side of the cabin, their long fingers dragging against the window pane as they were flung to and fro. He glanced at the window, expecting to see a darkened sky with an oncoming storm. The ache in his leg was worse this day--a sign of the impending change. Yet, as he stared out onto the highlands, John’s unfocused eyes saw nothing of note. A grey, winter sky that fell like heavy curtains down onto the horizon, meeting the grey earth as it wandered off across the plains. He sighed. This winter would never end, it seemed.
? What does he mean? Why isn’t he helping me? He knows the threat, he understands how dangerous Moran is--why is he just sitting there
from Sonata for Violin Solo No. 1 in G Minor. I can hear Anthea typing out the commands on her Blackberry with a rapid series of button clicks, ordering the five deep security squads to Baker street. Implementing the cordon at either end of the block. Placing snipers in the windows surrounding the flat, with their sights aimed on the door. I pull out my own phone to send a reminder to John.
My lips twitch, holding back a smirk as John’s face cycles through varied reactions to my soliloquy, ranging from mild offense to irritation to finally, embarrassed shock. He meets my gaze, and upon seeing my chin waver and the mischievous glint in my eye, works at restraining his own laughter. He fails, naturally, and before long we’re both giggling helplessly. It feels familiar, releasing tightly wound adrenaline in this way with him. A flash of times passed. Moments of
“It’s fine. We need to have this conversation so we can…,” he trails off, biting his lower lip and blinking slowly at me. His eyes lose focus, face vacant while he considers his next words.
Winter settled harshly around John's cabin, coating the fields with thick white snow drifts covered in a crunchy, icy sheen. Mycroft asked to go outside daily, forgetting that the temperature was so far below freezing that it threatened to give his nose frostbite the moment the door opened. He would stand there, staring at the white canvas for a while before looking up at John as if he expected him to fix it. John would shut the door, keeping the cat inside, and the two of them would return to their places near the fire.
,” he holds up his hands, looking at them as if they don’t belong to his body, “and I took an oath to use them to heal, not harm.”
He knows, without having to look, that none of the sailors climbing up the shrouds, hanging from the yardarms, stationed in the fighting top, are John—and he cannot bear the cruel trick of seeing the flash of a sun-browned leg or shoulder and mistaking it for John.
“Please,” Sherlock says, wondering just how many times he will be forced to say the words this evening. “Call me Sherlock.”
The dull ache of hunger in Sherlock’s gut is easy to ignore. He’s never had much of an appetite and now that misery has returned with such force to his life he finds all thoughts of food make him distantly sick.
He was so much more responsive, so much more attuned to his body after he’d allowed himself to drop back into the awareness of his physical reality, even after just a few hours.
Every step between him and the privacy of his cramped cabin feels like an eternity. Sherlock tucks his head down, walks as fast as he can, prays with every fiber of his being that no one will see him, no one will speak to him.
Sherlock pushed forward with his hips and John’s whole body tensed as Sherlock breached him, and then kept pushing forward in one long slide until he was seated up to the hilt.
He registers John, gently arranging him so that he’s no longer dangling off the bed, and then pulling off the remainder of his own clothing, before crawling in alongside Sherlock and gathering him in his arms, turning to face him and placing a kiss on each of his flushed cheeks.
John squinted at Sherlock and seemed to suddenly see him for the first time. His face filled with amazement. “Your hair.”
He cannot hear what Lestrade is telling the man from shore but as Sherlock watches him lean in with an apologetic look on his face, it’s clear the lieutenant has some quick-thinking diplomacy work to do if he wants to make up for the damage done by the captain blatantly ignoring the harbormaster’s lackey and commandeering the other man’s boat.
If the Lieutenants are keeping close track of who gets into which boat, then Sherlock does not know how they are going to slip Molly past them in her new disguise. It isn’t as if they can simply invent a new midshipman out of thin air.
He thinks about Mycroft hearing the news, tries to picture his smug face, the usual blandness disturbed by shock, as he struggles to choose which emotion is appropriate to express, before settling on a look of somber regret.
“Tell me…” John licked his lips, reached a hand down to rest on Sherlock’s slender hip. “Tell me how it feels.”
He doesn’t, but when Sherlock lifts his head from his arm, the room is spinning slightly around him, and when he reaches down to drag his shirt back down over his bare arse and roll off the sticky mess beneath him, he realizes that there are bite marks on his arm from his own mouth.
“There are things I want to do to you, Sherlock… things… you won’t even believe.” Sherlock lets out a soft cry as John’s teeth graze Sherlock’s neck. “But you’re not—you’re not ready yet, Sherlock.”
Then they are standing, shirtless, breathing hard together in the dark, and Sherlock is momentarily grateful for the fact that they did not stop to light the candles because he is certain that if he could see John now, the rise and fall of the muscles in his heaving chest, the hard gleaming lines of him, the storm-dark flashing of his eyes—he would not be able to go on standing.
What they also know is that now is not the time to question any of his orders. Nor to speak openly about how pointless they might be.
him about it. Sherlock was facing away from him so John could only see a sliver of his face from where he sat, but there was something in Sherlock’s tone that made John want to keep talking. His interest was sincere and John found himself responding to it against his better judgment.
Sherlock thinks he knows what he will see when he does but is surprised to find in his hands a piece of fruit about the size of an orange and with a similar texture but greenish-yellow in color.
The day is as hot as the many that have come before, but the winds have picked up, which helps to alleviate some of the sun’s unrelenting presence.
“The thing is… it’s a bit more challenging to be on the receiving end, so I thought we might try it with me in that position first, the receiving position that is… that way you can learn how it’s done, and the next time well… we’ll work up to it,” John says with a sudden grin, and it’s like the sun catching on a pane of glass; Sherlock is momentarily blinded by it.
“No, you don’t need to tell me that,” the other man says, frustration still clear in his voice. “But we’re doing everything we can! I don’t see how he thinks it’s possible to—”
“Y-yes… except you didn’t kiss my neck…” John moves as if to pull away, but Sherlock reaches back a desperate hand to hold him in place. “No! Don’t stop…”
An image of Sherlock’s desecrated bed flashed in his mind, the way he’d last seen it this morning. The pillows all thrown off, sheets tangled, the curves of Sherlock’s body showing through the blankets, soft in the light of the rain. Pain went through him like a blade in his belly and once again he thought he was going to be sick.
Sherlock watches, fascinated, by the way the musician holds his bow, the strange way it’s pointing almost towards himself as he plays, and as his eyes follow the movement of his fingers over the keys, Sherlock realizes that the keys act in place of his fingers on the frets to make the different notes.
John gives a low cry, and Sherlock, lost in the sensation of having such a warm, soft part of John in his mouth, pushes at John’s thighs to spread them further apart, sliding his attentions from one to the other. He resettles himself between John’s legs to get a better angle, lying flat on his belly so he is closer to all the most sensitive parts of John.
He straightens up only to see Deverall, making his way back across the room. Sherlock looks away before their eyes connect, feeling his cheeks flood once more with color at the memory of Deverall’s insinuating tone. To Sherlock’s eternal relief, however, Deverall does not come any nearer, continuing instead to the table at the back of the tavern where Sherlock saw the
It took all of his willpower to break away from the sweet hot force of Sherlock’s mouth. He pulled back, breathing hard, struggling to disentangle himself from Sherlock’s limbs.
He wants to tell John how good it feels, how relieved he feels to have John here with him again but all he can manage is a broken gasp as John’s fingers find the fastenings to his trousers and begin to work them apart. Before Sherlock can even think to reach down and help him, John’s warm fingers have slid inside his trousers and taken the length of him in hand.
Any activity that results in a kiss from John Watson is not one Sherlock is going to expend energy protesting.
Although the walk back to the table where John’s messmates sit probably only takes about a minute, it feels to Sherlock as though he’s lived several lifetimes by the time they work their way through the crowd back to the main tavern.
But when he looks up at John, he sees John looking down at him with parted lips, brows knitted together as though he might be in pain, his eyelids so low over his eyes they are barely open, and Sherlock suddenly understands the reason for his silence.
. He’s here. I’m certain of it. If anything goes wrong, text Lestrade. With any luck, we’ll be out of here within the hour.”
Hours later—or so Sherlock would guess if he were in any state to make this kind of calculation—the storm shows no sign of letting up. In fact, it has worsened, as has Sherlock’s condition.
He wanted so badly to reach down and take himself in hand, but he was too focused on the slick, even slide of his fingers in and out of Sherlock. He needed Sherlock to come, and he needed it to be good, before he could spare a thought for himself.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. The problem is he knows John’s right. He just doesn’t want it to be true.
But the warmth of John’s hands gripping his shoulders, that is real, as is the sound of John’s breathing, low and shallow in the air between them.
John slid out first and glanced down the street, crowded close on either side with old, gnarled-looking trees. There was a string of police cars parked up and down the block, but no MET officers in sight.
If you would like to hear versions of the songs John sings in this chapter, you can find the first one
He’d been working his way through Scotland Yard’s old case files, when he’d come across a particularly fascinating case where a woman had poisoned her husband by feeding him a slice of pie. Spousal poisonings were nothing out of the ordinary, but the puzzling detail was that she’d served the pie to multiple guests at the same dinner party. She’d even eaten a slice of the pie herself but it had never been determined how she’d managed to poison only the husband.
John instantly stepped forward and took hold of the hand Sherlock was using to cover his mouth. “Shh. It’s alright. There’s no need to be sorry.” He couldn’t bear for Sherlock to experience one more moment of self-doubt. He squeezed the fingers between his own, mindful of the cuts on the back of Sherlock’s hand. “I started it!”
“I do believe, my dear Bartholomew, that you are entirely mistaken. I heard from Mr. Jackson earlier this afternoon that the sort of primitive rituals to which you are referring are precisely what Lieutenant Lestrade and the captain wish to avoid. No, no, this is meant to be a far more civilized affair.”
John coated his palm from the moisture at the tip and then stroked the length of it. He watched Sherlock’s mouth fall open wider.
He heard Sherlock gasp above him and he slid his hands down Sherlock’s back to rest on his buttocks, digging his fingers into the muscled flesh. His mouth skimmed the waistband of Sherlock’s shorts before continuing down over the now prominent bulge of Sherlock’s cock. He traced the curve of it with his open mouth, hot breath pluming out around his tongue. When he reached Sherlock’s balls, he pulled them into his mouth.
He straightened up and took his glass of water in hand. He was desperate for a cup of tea but the thought of a hot beverage had no appeal to him. He crossed over the threshold of the kitchen into the living room, heading for his armchair. When he was halfway there he looked up, and stopped dead in his tracks.
Sherlock watches, amazed, as John seems to grow brighter upon waking. He yawns enormously, rolling his hips into Sherlock’s as he stretches, the muscles in his chest expanding as he lifts his arms briefly above his head.
Miss Hooper nods marginally again, lips pursed together, and Sherlock feels compelled to add a final clarification.
John breaks off with a gasp as Sherlock’s finger finally locates the place he’s been searching for inside John, his head arching back in the sand, his knees coming up on either side of Sherlock, fingers tightening in Sherlock’s curls.
He drops his eyes, and yes, Sherlock can see it now, he’s distinctly discomfited—there’s the faintest trace of color rising in his face.
At this point, just the idea of John’s finger breaching him would be enough to make Sherlock come, but the
The bright feeling that this causes makes the music swell within him and he can feel the color of John’s hair—its golden warmth—the blue that is the color of his eyes.
This process takes almost a full minute. Sherlock isn’t surprised. He is aware there is a great deal of it.
John keeps stroking Sherlock’s hair. There is no reason for him to do this. Sherlock hopes that he will never stop.
Sherlock expects much more resistance to this part of the plan than Molly gives evidence of. It’s a testament to just how desperate she must be that she seems to have hardly any qualms at all about drugging her chaperone. Just in case any latent conscience asserts itself later on, Sherlock reassures her that the effects of the potion are harmless. It will only make her sleep longer than usual.
The energy between them that was there up on deck is between them still, shimmering, hot—like a wall of flame, like a living thing twisting its way up Sherlock’s spine, making him feel dizzy and light-headed, shivering, hot and cold at once.
The movement of Sherlock sliding an arm under his shoulders is enough to make the world heave around him. The colors of the island flicker into darkness. John shuts his eyes.
He’s never experienced an emotion as complex as this, as deep. The feeling is vast, complicated—so immense Sherlock is afraid it will swallow him whole.
“Well, well, saved in the nick of time once again it would seem. Next time you’re not going to be so lucky, Holmes. You’re going to be sorry you ever crossed me, mark my words. I’m going to make you wish you’d never been born.”
John smirked against Sherlock’s chest and let his mouth drift over to take the place of his thumb. This time he lowered his mouth down slowly, and blew a long warm breath over the sensitive skin, watching as Sherlock’s nipple stiffened under the touch of his breath.
Marty Jones laughed, and then shot the dog farthest from him, one of the few in the room who appeared to be uninjured.
John reached out and took hold of the edges of Sherlock’s coat, then, dragging Sherlock’s mouth down to his, he kissed him.
“It’s good to see you again. I’ve been hoping we would get another chance to talk ever since John introduced us but my job doesn’t leave me much time for socializing, I’m afraid.”
He might not be able to go as slow as liked but he could still manage a modicum of self-control to draw things out, much as he would have liked to swallow Sherlock to the root in one deft move.
Before Sherlock can say another word, John is grabbing him by the shoulders and crowding him back into the narrow space between the bulwarks so they are the both of them cloaked in shadow.
There’s no reason to feel nervous; he and John just did all this not twelve hours ago, but somehow his anticipation is sharpened to an almost unbearable pitch. It’s like his skin cannot contain the enormity of his desire, it feels as though he will burst open at any moment.
Sherlock follows suit, momentarily forgetting his self-consciousness and stripping off his jacket. He rolls his sleeves up, tugs at his neck scarf to pull it loose, and uses it to wipe the sweat off his brow.
“No,” Sherlock says with a shake of his head. “That you grow more beautiful every time I look at you.”
He’s always been a creature ruled by selfishness. He knows as much from the way his family’s always talked about him, “only ever thinks about himself” they’d say behind their hands when he burned down the library, when he refused to attend his mother’s dinner parties, when he’d disappointed his father by refusing a career in law—and this is no different.
“If you’ll excuse me,” he says, rising from the table abruptly. He leaves the dining room without another word.
Sherlock gasped above him, the sound shocked and pleased in equal measure, and John repeated the motion, relishing in the feel of his tongue sweeping over the fluttering indent of Sherlock’s arse hole. He resisted the urge to press in against it immediately—he wanted to take it slowly, to give Sherlock time to get used to the sensation of John’s tongue on this most intimate part of his body.
“What about the night I got back from New Zealand, when you made me drink that whole bottle of wine?”
Ferguson is silent beside him, packing a second pipe with tobacco for himself. He lights it and takes a long, deep drag.
And I know at this point, my promises are probably meaningless to you, but I swear, THE KISS IS COMING, and so much more. Hang in there, gentle readers! YOU WILL BE REWARDED FOR YOUR PATIENCE MULTIPLE TIMES OVER.
It makes him sad to think it. It’s nice… having Molly. But Sherlock has no idea what’s appropriate to say to her, and how much would be considered too much. The last thing he wants is to frighten her away.
He struggled up toward consciousness, willing himself to wake, like a swimmer fighting through dark water and weeds, kicking his way to the surface. He opened his eyes, realizing in the same instant he recognized his bedroom ceiling that the weight pressing in against his hips was actually there.
Sherlock hopped nimbly out of the carriage with altogether too much grace for a man who’d just been on his knees moaning around another man’s cock.
Sherlock felt something in his chest give way at the depth of gratitude in the boy’s face. For one rash moment, Sherlock was tempted to give him the entire contents of his purse, just to spite his brother and his family and everything they stood for, but it was all he had and the days ahead of him were long and unknown so Sherlock kept it although the weight inside his coat felt as heavy to him as an iron chain.
John moves the cool cloth to Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock tilts his head back with gratitude, elongating his throat.
John’s startled breath of laugher against Sherlock’s chest is almost all the confirmation he needs. He’d forgotten—
He presses down harder, still keeping a quick but steady rhythm. Pauses. Breathes into John’s mouth, pushes air into his lungs. Waits. Starts over again.
What could he say? “Then, I came to in a pool locker room with Moriarty’s hands all over me, informing me of my repressed desire for Sherlock while he made salacious implications that have given over to constant, obsessive sexual fantasies. To shag, or not to shag? Please comment below.”
“How—how is that?” Sherlock asks, hearing the tremor in his own voice. He is so overwhelmed by the feel of John he realizes his own eyes are half-shut.
It never occurred to him that John sleeping with Deverall could result in actual material gain for John. But as Patterson said—why on earth wouldn’t he be tempted if it meant the chance of a promotion? Sherlock has never considered before the prospect that John would
Sherlock says nothing. Of course, he believes it. It’s what he’s been taught by the people around him all his life.
Thankfully, neither of them is wearing too much in the way of clothing, as the intensity of the sun on the upper deck long since caused them to remove their jackets—there are only shirts and trousers to deal with (well, and boots and waistcoats…). Even so, the frustration of having any barrier between his own skin and John’s is enough to make Sherlock slightly frantic.
He looked up at John, and in the pale grey light from the window John could see the expression on his face was completely naked, filled with need. “Stay.”
John’s body is utterly still against Sherlock’s, his hand no longer moving in the same soothing pattern over Sherlock’s skin.
This was perhaps another reason the Nurse considered Sherlock strange. He was always bringing home treasures that he’d found in the woods—beetle carcasses, empty bird shells, snake skins. One time he found a mouse skeleton in its entirety and when he’d tried to show it to the Nurse, she’d shrieked in terror and dashed it to bits on the floor.
They watch him reach the end of the yardarm and lower himself down with his bucket, the handle of his paintbrush clenched between his teeth, thighs straddling the beam tightly as he leans forward and begins to daub the thick tar over the stays.
John lay back down, dragging the covers up over his shoulders, forcing himself to think cold, clear thoughts. He was determined
“He sent me a letter that arrived the night before I boarded the ship. But I was so… frustrated with him that I didn’t read it. In fact, I tore it up.”
“Fine—fine,” he gasps, fingers clenching in Sherlock’s curls, making Sherlock want to rub his own hardening cock against John’s side like an animal in heat. “But we have to be quick.”
LaRoue kicked out ineffectually but then with a violent, twisting motion, tore forward with such force that he ripped the jacket from his shoulders and sent off at a sprint down the lobby.
He had to make Sherlock understand why they couldn’t do this, why he wasn’t worth it. If he couldn’t fight Sherlock off, then he would have to try and put it into words.
“I don’t want a scrap of clothing on you,” John says, kissing Sherlock’s other knee so softly that Sherlock has to bite his lip again. “I need to see all of you, every lovely inch, my rosebud, my moonbeam, my evening flower.”
But Sherlock can feel the tension radiating through the body under his, so he refocuses, concentrating as hard as ever on the speed, the angle of his strokes, searching for the ideal balance between gentleness and pressure, in awe every moment his fingers travel over the slick heat of John’s sizeable girth. He is unable to stop the rocking motion of his body, so he uses it to his advantage to help direct the rhythm of his hands on John’s cock, as though he is stroking John not just with his hands but with his whole body.
The sight of John looking at him like that, gold hair pushed back from his forehead, forearms tucked behind his back, a sly grin curling his lips—it’s almost enough to make Sherlock completely lose his focus.
Sherlock sees Anderson’s eyes begin to scour the perimeter of the room, scrutinizing the space for evidence of where John might be hiding. Sherlock cannot let him put two and two together; he cannot give him the opportunity to look behind the case.
The shock of his absence is so profound—so visceral, to Sherlock it’s like moving from the heat of a summer day into the frigid darkness of a winter night. It’s like the shock of that first stinging breath when stepping out into the bitter cold after sitting for hours in front of the fire.
John tips his chin up, pushing his mouth into Sherlock’s until their lips brush, in a not-quite kiss. “The sun is almost up.” John pushes a hand through Sherlock’s hair. The touch feels full of sorrow. “I have to leave you.”
He picked his way gingerly over the shards of glass on the ground and climbed back through the hole in the kitchen door, pausing in the gloom just inside to look down at the object in his hand.
“I’m sorry—I’m just so relieved to see a friendly face. This has all been much more difficult than I anticipated. The truth is I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into.”
Despite the terror of his dream, Sherlock’s body feels soft and warm, and Sherlock realizes with a little shock of delight that John is still curled around him, just as he was when Sherlock fell asleep, hips tucked in against Sherlock’s thigh.
As soon as he enters the room, John is all business, pulling up a chair beside the bed, rolling up his shirtsleeves. “How long has he been like this?”
John stood next to the sink and drank down two glasses of tap water. He felt immeasurably better. He couldn’t remember the last time water had tasted so good.
John swallowed the last of the champagne in his glass before lifting himself up out of his chair and following Sherlock out onto the balcony.
John is clever enough to hide his smile with the back of his hand, but Sherlock can still see it, peeking out at the corners, and he’s not sure whether he is pleased by the sight of it, or more embarrassed still.
He does not need to say another word; John’s footsteps quickly match the hurried pace of Sherlock’s own, and before long they have reached the open door of the tavern.
Sherlock made a sound somewhere between a cry and a yell, back arching dramatically, his hips pushing up into the pressure of John’s tongue.
Sherlock tries to quell his feelings of guilt by telling himself that the girl’s troubles are not his problems—that he has enough on his mind to worry about without adding the woes of an unfortunate governess—but the sentiment rings hollow, even inside his own head.
“If I am not making myself understood, I would be happy to flog each member of Mr. Baynes’ mess in turn, until you get the message.”
Sherlock’s hand hadn’t moved from his mouth. John twisted his head, trying to break Sherlock’s grip. He made a muffled sound of protest.
John said that the dose was not large enough to be lethal, which would imply that someone wanted the Lieutenant out of commission last night, presumably so he would not be aware of certain goings on. But what? What events would need to be kept hidden from the ship’s first lieutenant?
He tightens his fingers in it and stuffs it into his pocket before he loses control of himself completely, nodding his thanks at Billy with a tight-lipped smile before returning to his work.
He falls into the chair beside his desk, pushes his shaking fingers through his hair, and tries to staunch the tide of panicked grief and rage pounding through him so that he can
“Have you ever thought…” John continues, his voice like liquid darkness, like heat itself, “That it might be appealing to me? The thought of being the first one to who gets to do these things with you? The first one to kiss you…” John’s thumb strokes down Sherlock’s cheek, brushing the corner of his lips. “And touch you…” The hand covering Sherlock’s begins to trace light patterns on the back of his wrist. “And see you like this?”
He stopped licking with reluctance and lifted his head between Sherlock’s knees so that he could see Sherlock’s face. He kept his tone inquisitive but light. He wanted to give Sherlock the option to say no without thinking he’d be putting John out. Even though, John reflected, with brutal honesty, he really would. But he wouldn’t let Sherlock know that. If there was one thing John Watson was, he was a considerate lover. “Is this alright?”
His hands are giant’s hands compared to John’s small, strong ones—Sherlock’s fingers long and spindly, ghostly white, pale in the darkness against the warmer tones of John’s sun-browned skin.
“I am.” Sherlock slides his palms over John’s chest, fingers rubbing harder against John’s nipples, eliciting another low groan from deep within John’s throat as he thrusts. “I can take anything you can give me.”
Ah. So that explained the constant stream of communication. It wasn’t a new case after all. John felt a funny little twist in his stomach at the knowledge that Sherlock had entrusted Lestrade to get what he needed, and not him.
Sherlock tore forward with a snarl of rage and John watched his life flash before his eyes. Of all the stupid,
him—and wanted to be kissing him, John felt his heart turn a series of delighted somersaults in his chest.
“Oh thank heaven, you’re here!” she says into his shoulder, her voice slightly muffled by fabric. “I can’t think of the last time I was so happy to see someone!”
It was full morning when Sherlock showed up to collect him. John had been right; Sherlock had finished at the Yard before the hospital was through with John. He’d even gotten Sherlock to submit to the rest of the standard fire-exposure tests while he waited for John to finish up. He was grumbling and sullen throughout but John was relieved to have the confirmation that Sherlock was officially free from harm. After all, Sherlock had suffered almost as much exposure to the smoke as John had.
Sherlock curls his lip, thinks about the jab John taught him yesterday, pictures his fist connecting with Anderson’s smug face, shattering the bridge of his nose.
John’s voice is warm against the back of Sherlock’s neck. “No, I don’t think they heard us. I think we were very lucky that the party went so late and that the alcohol was freely flowing. I think most of them were still above deck when we came down, and I imagine the ones already in their rooms were stone cold drunk.”
“Aye,” Matthews adds, unable to keep from chuckling into his drink as he says it. “One from the glory days of Three Continents Watson!”
Suddenly, he couldn’t bear the gentleness in Sherlock’s voice. He felt the muscles in his throat constrict.
And what’s most impossible of all, Sherlock thinks, feeling stricken, is that he should care for Sherlock the way he does.
Sherlock hesitates; he does not know what he can say that will be delicate enough to be discreet but meaningful enough that John will understand.
John can feel the pull of the waves as they lap over him and the taste of salt in his mouth, but that could be the taste of Sherlock—green and fresh and living—his skin warm and slippery under John’s fingers. His perception of the world has narrowed to Sherlock’s hands, his mouth.
The smiling sailor gives Sherlock an exaggerated wink and Sherlock can feel every inch of exposed skin turn beet-red, from the collar of his shirt to the roots of his hair.
His grin was manic—his eyes utterly absent of emotion—and the last thing John knew before he woke was the smell of his own burning flesh as Moriarty held him to the ground.
Very cheerily and with incredible patience, the sailor begins to show Sherlock how to twist the strands of fiber together to make the rope.
John Watson, who can do anything—who swims in the ocean as sleek as a fish, who runs through the air as though the weight of the earth does not hold him down, who sings like the gods of the world are in his lungs, who battles storms and surf and emerges, triumphant, laughing, his cheeks bright with rain—
A shudder runs through him at the thought of this, and he’s so aroused by now, his hand is slick with moisture. He rubs his thumb through it, whimpering, imagining it is John’s hand there, his touch hungry, reverent.
Before Sherlock can fully absorb the sight before him—before he can collapse to his knees in the sand and weep with relief—John is pulling on his hand.
As much as he hates to admit it, he has grown used to the thin grey walls of his cabin, the monotonous heaving line of the blue horizon; as tedious as they have been these many months, they have formed the boundaries of his world—simple, dull, reliable. Sherlock realizes that in that time his senses have grown dull as a result, like an unused muscle grown stiff without use.
Blue—all he sees in front of him, bright liquid blue. The color of the sky in winter, the color of the sea, ice cold and terribly bright. Something about the color catches in his chest; seems to fill him up, and it’s like being bathed in light.
“I didn’t want to wake you up,” Sherlock says through the tightness in his throat. “I could have watched you sleeping all afternoon. But I’m glad I didn’t. This is better.”
John moaned—it was a deep, guttural sound, and he dragged a pillow underneath his face, clutching it beneath him to muffle the noise.
Mycroft had helped Sherlock find a place to bury him in the woods outback. He even helped Sherlock dig the hole, didn’t even complain about his clothes getting dirty.
John’s voice is hoarse, and it strikes Sherlock as he hears it how quiet John has been. It’s only now, hearing him speak, that Sherlock realizes how unusual it is. Usually he keeps up a steady stream of praise, of encouragement; it isn’t like him to be so silent, and the realization makes Sherlock’s heart constrict sharply in his chest.
However, as soon as John exited the bathroom and started down the hall to his bedroom, Sherlock pounced on him like a giant, feral cat, leaning into John with such savage intensity that John fell back two hasty steps until his shoulders hit the wall.
Sherlock pulls his knees in tighter against his chest, cringing away from the retreating voices as they disappear down the corridor.
“Those people I don’t… I don’t understand how they work, but if that man was offering something of value to you, I didn’t want to be the reason you couldn’t get it.”
He closed the distance between them, his mouth pushing warm and slick against John’s, both soft and hungry at once, his fingers tightening on John’s as he leaned down against him.
his arse, and was shocked to find how much he enjoyed the feeling, how much he wanted more of it. The thought of Sherlock pushing into him, penetrating him was so profoundly erotic that John heard himself whimper sharply with need.
John’s mouth is soft and pliant beneath his and Sherlock licks into it, savoring the moan the gesture pulls from John as Sherlock lets his hips fall heavy against him.
The other passengers are particularly raucous tonight. Everyone is in good spirits due to the fine weather they’ve been having and the smooth progress of the ship.
John’s body throbbing against his cock, the pressure of his heels on either side of Sherlock’s spine—but he can’t stop, and he’s too far gone—it’s been too much, for too long, and before he can even think to stop himself, he realizes he’s coming, his body tensing over John, the first wave of his pleasure tearing through him with such force that he thinks he might be crying out, he cannot tell over the roaring in his ears.
“Well, if there’s any question in your mind, I can assure you that I won’t blow her cover. No one knows better than I do how desperately Lestrade could use some cheering up these days.”
He goes on holding Deverall’s gaze for a moment longer. There’s something almost like respect on Deverall’s face and for just a moment, Sherlock feels his dislike for the man waver, the pair of them briefly united in their mutual concern for their friends.
John’s eyes are hazy with desire, but Sherlock can see something deeper when their eyes connect, that look that makes his chest ache.
When John finally pulls back, he keeps his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders as he studies him, his blue eyes very bright in his dirt-smeared face.
“And you and Mr. Watson together that was…” Billy shakes his head, the expression on his face completely awe-struck. “That was something else.”
And then he’s thrusting forward into Sherlock, rubbing the naked heat of his cock against Sherlock’s body, harder than he ever has, so hard Sherlock can feel the scratch of the bristled cables against his back as John rocks into him.
He feels John’s fingers move against his, and Sherlock opens his eyes to see the expression on John’s face has changed again, making his breath catch in his throat. He’s wearing the look of incredulous awe he sometimes gets when he watches Sherlock, as if he cannot understand how Sherlock exists, as if he can scarcely believe his own luck for finding him. It makes Sherlock’s heartbeat kick hard against his breastbone.
The longer Sherlock looks at them, the more they seem like figures carved out of wood in some strange tableau—the only movement among them the smoke from their pipes, which winds its way between their grave faces like strands of mist.
John pulled all the way out, before pushing slowly back in, the sight of his cock disappearing into Sherlock’s body almost too much for him to take. “
Sherlock can feel himself warming at the note of approval in John’s voice, at the almost palpable presence of John’s gaze. He tips his head back in pleasure at the sensation of the snug material sliding down his thighs.
Moriarty strode closer, his expensive shoes making a trail through the blood. He stopped when he was an arm’s length away.
When John speaks again, his voice is so quiet Sherlock almost doesn’t hear him. “I see the way they treat you.”
He saw Sherlock’s eyes on him in the mirror as he studied himself and felt the pool of warmth in his belly grow hotter.
The movement made the burning sensation worse at first but Sherlock’s long fingers were easily able to reach his prostate and the feel of them, rubbing against it, made low ripples of pleasure course through the pain, chasing it away.
He adds another finger and it slips in easily thanks to the oil, and now the tightness, the fullness that he feels is enough to let him imagine that it isn’t just John’s fingers inside of him, but John’s cock.
Sherlock climbs out of bed, rubs his palms over his face in agitation as he begins to pace the narrow distance between the wall and his bed.
Sherlock lifts his chin, ignores the fluttering feeling in the pit of his stomach. “It’s a game my brother and I used to play, to see how much we could learn about a person just from looking at them… just from observation.”
“Good,” John says, his eyes growing darker as he lowers his mouth down to Sherlock’s. He licks his lips before pressing them to Sherlock’s, his voice rough with longing. “Then let’s begin. Let me draw you out.”
“You seem to have this notion in your head that I’m better off without you. That you aren’t good enough for me.” Sherlock can hear the disbelief in John’s voice even as he says the words—the undercurrent of dark humor—and when Sherlock looks at John, sure enough his lips are lifting wryly at one corner.
“It’s a special kind of orange that grows here. The woman who sold it to me told me it has a particular taste.”
It’s not long before Sherlock is improvising too, caught up in the playful spirit of John’s dancing, turning backwards when John turns, spinning on the spot and laughing with joy at the sight of John, turning, with his arms spread wide, kicking up and stamping his foot in time with the music the way the others do who know the dance.
“How on earth could you know that? There’s no tickets on the bodies! And how do you know they were going on a cruise?”
Sherlock is straddling him, nude thighs spread wide, and Sherlock experiences a delicious flutter in his stomach at the feeling of John pinned, however ineffectively, beneath him.
, this is very good because it means Sherlock’s head is more level with John’s, which makes it easier for John to deepen the kiss, his hands carding through Sherlock’s curls, fingers scraping luxuriantly against Sherlock’s scalp, and now Sherlock is
The night before his voyage began, Sherlock was sitting alone over a grey supper in the tavern where he was boarding, hunched in his cloak, watching the rain pelt the thick glass of the tavern windows, the misery that was lodged cold and hard in his throat preventing him from taking even one bite of his dismal supper when a boy had found him at the table, drenched from the rain, breathless, his cheeks pink from the cold night air. “Mr. Holmes?”
“The tricky part is doing the details round the top—you’ll want to make sure you don’t do too thick a coat, otherwise you’ll clog up the gaps. See here?”
Two tears drip hot in quick succession down John’s cheek; Sherlock shifts at the feel of them, startled.
so much—when Sherlock can astonish him, can bring that bright and breathless quality to his voice, it makes Sherlock’s whole body go warm with pleasure.
This tune is slower than the others, the tempo slightly different. It takes Sherlock a few seconds to realize that it’s a waltz.
He had never told anyone that story before. Not even his therapist who had tried her hardest to draw it out of him. It was one of those things he wasn’t even aware he carried with him, how it affected him always, tucked out of sight like a hard, dark weight under his ribs.
Now that the door is open, he can clearly hear the sounds of Colonel Jackson’s voice loudly singing ‘What do you do with a drunken sailor?’
Reaching down to slide his arms under Sherlock’s, John pulls him gently but with extreme ease back up his torso until Sherlock’s mouth is just beneath his.
John lets himself be pulled, falling in between Sherlock’s spread thighs, his arms braced on either side of Sherlock’s torso to support his weight.
Sherlock undid the last few buttons with enviable ease and John pushed Sherlock’s blazer off his shoulders, taking the shirt with it. He sighed, as the long pale expanse of Sherlock’s chest was uncovered. He ran his hands down the plane of bare flesh, still disbelieving.
“…a place,” Sherlock continues, his breath coming noticeably faster now, “…that I know you will want to be clean because I think… I think you may have plans for it later.”
John was hitting the sleepy stage of his drunkenness as he crawled into the cab beside Sherlock. Sherlock planted himself in the middle seat and didn’t move over when John got in. Perhaps this would have seemed strange to John under normal circumstances but in his inebriated stupor he was simply grateful to have somebody to lean against.
John’s face softens at the doubt in Sherlock’s voice. The hand in Sherlock’s hair pushes through the tangle of curls, and Sherlock responds immediately to the feeling, face lifting into the touch, body relaxing. If he were a cat, he would be purring.
“Just here…” John clarifies, lowering his mouth to the skin of Sherlock’s hand, his voice a murmur of heat. “Just on the hand.”
Sherlock’s sense of urgency melts away in the presence of John’s warm mouth against his. He cannot bring himself to end the kiss.
, Sherlock thinks as his tongue slides around the head, tracing every crease, every fold of skin—each delightful inconstancy he finds giving him new information about this part of John’s body. His tongue is following the vein on the underside of John’s very swollen cock when he feels John’s thigh tense under his hand.
Sherlock pauses again at the bottom of the second flight of stairs, lifting his hat to wipe away the sweat accumulating on his forehead, and freezes with his arm against his brow.
His journey back down the corridor and across the upper decks, and even down through the hatch into the forecastle is met with no obstacles and Sherlock is breathless with relief.
She’d smuggled herself onto one of the lifeboats and tried to sneak away as soon as they had reached the shore, but was easily apprehended by one of the Met. She’d pulled a gun on the police officer who grabbed her, and then had dissolved into messy tears as soon as they’d wrenched the gun out of her hands. She said the fire onboard had not been her or her husband’s idea, insisting that even when they’d agreed to the plan, “he” had assured them the fire would be contained. She was apparently devastated over her husband’s death, but Sherlock told John later that the real cause of her grief was clearly the loss of her beloved cruise ship.
His mouth traveled up and in towards the heat between Sherlock’s legs but he pulled back at the last second and moved his mouth to Sherlock’s other thigh.
John sets the basin on the chair by Sherlock’s bed, and dips the towel in it, wringing it out before he turns toward Sherlock to wipe the stickiness from his belly.
Sherlock’s room is dim when he opens the door; the sun’s golden warmth that was so pervasive up on deck has no presence here in the dark corridor off of which his cabin lies. The heat remains—thick and stifling, but all is colorless and grey. The walls of Sherlock’s chamber are bathed in gloom.
“Lovely,” John says, tucking the money into the pocket of his soaking trousers and out of sight. “I’m so glad you saw sense, Angus. I was worried we’d have to discuss the matter over fists.”
Sherlock feels Anderson’s eyes cut to him, and even though it’s a silly, throwaway comment, just the prospect of Anderson making a fool of him in front of John makes his cheeks fill with fire.
Since John is the very last to leave the ship, it’s his job to cast them off, and Sherlock watches, without breathing—he has no body; he no longer needs to draw breath—as John unties the final rope mooring them to the
Sherlock smiles back at her; sees Ms. Grimsby eying him crossly and winks, then watches with satisfaction as Molly endeavors without success to hide her laughing mouth behind her hand.
Sherlock was worryingly silent above him and John broke his concentration for a moment to glance up at Sherlock.
John went over to stand behind him, tried to think of something to say and failed, so he stood quietly as Sherlock straightened up, his face whiter than ever, his lips pursed so tightly they were almost invisible.
The list is long and now that Sherlock is crouched in the darkness, surrounded by the labyrinth of barrels, casks, and chests, he realizes with a sinking feeling how ill-conceived this plan of his to double-check the inventory, actually is.
John took hold of Sherlock’s hips, stilling them. He brought his hands back up to drag Sherlock’s cheeks apart and pulled back slightly, his hot breath ghosting the damp flesh. He saw the shudder that moved through Sherlock in response.
Billy is reaching for his buckets again, clearly eager to be on his way, and at the sight of them, Sherlock feels a brief twist of self-hatred at the fact that he’s actually going to ask Billy for something else, on top of everything he’s already done, but he cannot stop himself.
Maybe he has made a grave mistake, but for now, all that matters is that Anderson will be removed from his position.
However, the incident had not been without collateral damage—the nature of which John had suspected would not cause Sherlock any due unease, or at least, that’s what he would have told you if you’d asked him so before the conclusion of the case. Now, he was not so sure. In fact, the evidence was painting a distinctly different picture.
Sherlock’s thoughts are all with John, back in the dim, candlelit glow of his memories from the past two nights. He is only distantly aware of the thick, simmering feeling in the atmosphere of the room, in the way the men’s sleeves cling to their arms and backs, and the sweat stands out on the bare throats of the women.
Sherlock’s curiosity quickly turns to horror as the implications of this sink in. “What—what happened?”
As he let himself in through the front door, it occurred to him that perhaps he should be worried about what sort of state the flat would be in upon his return; he’d never been away for such a long stretch of time. John suddenly had a vision of the kitchen transformed into a smoking black ruin, the living room floor lost under a heap of murder weapons, and Sherlock sitting calmly in the midst of it all, typing furiously on his phone.
John’s hand has started to stroke—agonizingly slowly, but with a delicious pressure that makes Sherlock begin to swell beneath his fingers. Sherlock’s mouth drops open at the feeling, his head tipping further back against John’s shoulder.
But John’s arm is around him—he can feel the solid weight of it against him, and every point at which John’s body leans in to meet his own is a confirmation to him—finally—that this is no dream. He can trust the feeling of John’s body against his because this, he knows, he could not dream up.
John says nothing. At a nod from Moran, Fraser steps forward and backhands John hard across the face. The motion jars his shoulder and it takes everything he has to hold in his scream.
John was careful to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s as he lowered his mouth down and took the slick head of Sherlock’s cock between his lips. He was rewarded with the sight of Sherlock’s mouth dropping open, his head tilting back with a low groan to expose the length of his throat.
When Sherlock flutters his eyelids open—his eyelashes sticking with what Sherlock suspects might be tears—he looks up to find John gazing down at him with worry, his hands lifting immediately to frame Sherlock’s face, blue eyes swimming with tenderness.
Sherlock fell asleep before the cab reached Baker Street, coiled against John’s side like a tentacular plant, his breath warm and muggy in the hollow of John’s neck.
Sherlock catches his breath as John’s mouth closes around his nipple. He feels John’s tongue lap over it and completely loses his train of thought.
It’s easy when he can see John before him like this, his whole body laid out for Sherlock’s hungry gaze; easy to track the tiny signs of pleasure, the shifts in his reaction as Sherlock readjusts his speed, the angle of his fingers.
Sherlock glances over at John beside him, who’s laughing at something Matthews has said, and seeing him like this, the open, easy quality of his posture, all the lines of grief gone from his face, Sherlock feels a joy fill him, so fierce and so profound, he’s not sure his body can contain it.
John makes a whimpering sound and Sherlock moves to reach for him, to hold him by his hip, to give him some support because if John is experiencing even a tenth of what Sherlock is experiencing in this moment then he must feel as though he’s coming apart.
“If that’s true, then why didn’t you simply introduce Marcus to them yourself? Why wait until the Lieutenant arrived?”
Hello dear readers! I'm not even going to offer the usual apologies for the delay between updates this time because FUCKING 2020. I also had to put this story to one side for eight months in order to finish my dissertation, WHICH I DID, SO IT'S DOCTOR BITTERGREENS FROM HERE ON OUT IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT!
But also, poisoned lip gloss, Sherlock thought to himself with quiet eagerness. He filed the idea away for later, before pulling John in for another kiss.
Fear curdles unpleasantly in his gut—fear that this man will see him looking stupid, looking weak, because Sherlock is both of those things and he cannot live with himself if this man sees, if he decides that Sherlock isn’t worth speaking to anymore. He hunches his shoulders against John’s gentle, worried voice. All of a sudden, he can’t stand the thought of another human being, especially this man who is so fascinating to Sherlock—so filled with kindness and strength.
Taking advantage of the silence created by the boy’s remark, Sherlock clears his throat. He raises his voice, gathering his courage to himself like a blanket. “Are all members of the crew invited?”
“Don’t be stupid.” Sherlock wasn’t looking at him. He’d started typing again, his fingers flying over the keys. “You saved my life.”
John’s eyes flicker up to Sherlock’s face for the first time since he rolled away, and his expression changes yet again, real sorrow flashing in his eyes.
“No! Listen, Sherlock…” John takes a deep breath. “Those people… I’m not comfortable around them… they’re clearly not comfortable around me, and if you had the chance to—to finally be accepted by them, well, I wasn’t going to stand in the way of that!”
Sherlock’s voice was bitterly amused. “Oh, now he takes me seriously, when I try and impart a little cultural—”
John slid an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and squeezed. “That’s right, I’m here. Everything’s fine now.”
They’ve started up a new tune now, and if possible, this one is even livelier, even more compelling than the last. It touches something deep inside Sherlock; he can feel it singing through the center of his bones. It makes his fingers twitch, makes his heart beat faster in his chest. The force of it seems to pull at Sherlock.
He says the words without thinking. There’s no emotion in his voice when he speaks, but the silence that greets his words is an uncomfortable one, and he realizes, too late, that even John’s jovial messmates don’t know how to react to the ugly truth that Sherlock’s family wishes he were dead.
John felt the familiar sharpening of his senses, and the strange calm settling over his body at the prospect of danger.
Ferguson has leaned forward to rest his elbows on the railing, his gaze on the water contemplative and far away.
John leans in, his smile bright and hungry, his voice dropping back to that low and dreamy register.
Sherlock eats his porridge without seeing it, his brain kicked suddenly to action as he thinks back over what he’s ascertained so far, desperate for something,
The hardest part is getting in and out of the turns. They must decide together, communicating with their bodies alone when to stop turning, because even though John is leading, there’s more give and take in the way he’s dancing with Sherlock, his guiding movements more suggestions than commands. It’s up to Sherlock to answer them and follow through.
The fact that John noticed his hasty retreat as well makes shame burn in his cheeks, worse than the shame he felt at Anderson’s blatant cruelty. He cannot bear for John to think he is a coward.
“Look at you,” John says as his fingers begin to work at the buttons, the naked desire in his voice affecting Sherlock almost as much as the presence of the heel of John’s hand which has finally,
He makes his way back down the hallway toward the stairs, violin clutched tightly in his arms, and he’s so eager to get back above deck that he’s scarcely looking where he’s going. It’s no wonder that he fails to see the figure standing in the shadows at the bottom of the stairs, until that person is upon him, seizing him by the collar of his jacket and throwing him hard into the wall.
“I’ve lied to you and I’ve tricked you and I’ve lied to you again, but this time it’s real. This is real now. It’s over. Moran’s dead. They’re all dead. It’s finally over. I couldn’t… I couldn’t come back to you. I couldn’t tell you until they were all dead. You weren’t safe. I couldn’t—John, I couldn’t put you at risk but I did. I did it anyway. I’ll never forgive myself. So if you can’t forgive me I’ll understand but at least know that it was because I didn’t want—I couldn’t let… it was for you, John. It was all for you. All of it.”
The sailors on the other hand, who have no such restrictions on the decency of their dress, have almost all stripped down to their trousers.
John ground his teeth. “Maybe it’s to do with the fact that you’ve sabotaged all my recent attempts to find a sexual partner and so I’m just a little bit sexually frustrated.”
Sherlock’s tongue had worked its way back up John’s neck, his teeth skimming the pounding pulse under John’s jaw, his thigh now rubbing shamelessly against John’s rigid cock.
what he means, exactly what it is he wants just from the tone of John’s voice. So instead he nods, wrapping his legs tighter around John, heart pounding in delicious anticipation.
He stops to listen and sure enough, he can hear the sound of the ocean again, from the other side of the trees.
And then he’s stepping back, breaking the kiss, dropping his hands from John’s shoulders with reluctance.
Sherlock has never heard John stammer in his life, and he lifts his head, pausing to look up at John, before nodding slowly.
He heard Sherlock’s low exhalation of pleasure as he sank into the heat, and watched his eyes flutter closed at the sensation.
John dropped his eyes from Sherlock’s hands and shifted in his seat, amazed at how quickly his body could respond to Sherlock’s presence.
—the taste of it sweeter than any liquor Sherlock has ever drunk—he fills his palms again and again, drinking long and deep.
John’s grin is all teeth, he looks like a hungry wolf; but his voice is as sweet as the lightest confection. “Did you have a suggestion for some… activity that I might use to occupy myself during my free hour? Is that it?”
And even if by some miracle, he is able to survive it, after that—what? They haven’t talked about what will happen when the ship reaches India. Sherlock can’t think about it.
“John…” he purrs, oozing forward, all his bones turned to liquid at the heat of John in his palm, the iron-velvet feel of him.
John watched the rapid rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest, and noticed for the first time so many of the details that he hadn’t seen in the first frenzy of lust—the gleam of sweat on Sherlock’s temples and his upper lip, the sweat darkening his hairline that told clearly of his exertion—the marks from his own mouth blooming on Sherlock’s neck and collarbones.
“His time in the war and the grave injuries he sustained would mean he wouldn’t recommend a sailor’s life to anyone, but his boy—left behind, all alone, his father his only living kin—would always look up to an absent father, would want to do as his father had done and start a life at sea. Naturally, they argued about it.”
He winds his free hand around the back of John’s thigh, stroking at the strong curves of John’s buttocks, kneading at the hard muscle—the feel of it under his fingers making his own erection throb where it’s still trapped against his breeches.
They work together in silence for a time, and Sherlock is concentrating so hard, that when the sailor speaks again, Sherlock doesn’t hear what he says. He’s forgotten entirely he isn’t by himself.
“A bit too late for that.” Moriarty laughed. He let go of John’s face and turned towards the wall that was lined with windows.
John’s voice is full of remorse; his eyes soft on Sherlock’s face as he continues to stroke the hair back from his forehead.
“Well then, as your superior officer I override your decision, and request that Mr. Jackson remove himself from the quarterdeck at once.”
until saliva was running down his chin and over the crease of Sherlock’s arse, until Sherlock came, screaming, his cock untouched.
It isn’t that the man has done or said anything to raise Sherlock’s alarm, but there’s something in his presence that rankles Sherlock, like an itch under his skin, something about his mood that acts as a counter to the general good humor of the group of working men.
He watches John’s eyes alight on what must be the emerging bruises left by Anderson’s fingers at his throat.
Sherlock stepped closer, his voice dropping several octaves more as he quoted another line from the opera, his face now lit up in a menacing smile. “
The man was shaking his head, his face gradually turning a bright shade of puce. “You’re going to be sorry you ever threatened me.”
“Ooh.” John suddenly realized what he wanted. “Green curry,” he said longingly, and may have drooled a little in his eagerness.
. He was just a bloody kid.” John forced his fists open, forced his palms to lie flat on the tops of his thighs, felt them trembling. “It was my job to keep him safe, and I didn’t. He died under my charge. And in the end there was nothing I could do to help him.”
“I’m going to go get things ready for dinner so we can eat whenever we like. But maybe when I come back, I can help you wash any…” John smiles suddenly—gleeful, wicked—and Sherlock feels his face heating before the words have left John’s mouth. “…hard to reach places?”
“Anderson, don’t argue with me,” Lestrade said, steering him away by the arm. “It’s too hot for this.”
Mrs. Hudson eyes him nervously, a mug of tea in each hand. “I don’t know, dear. I think it may have started early this morning.”
He dreams of a white bird flying over the ocean, diving down over the cliffs along the coast not far from where he grew up, and Sherlock is following it from the shore, desperate to catch up with it. He runs along the shoreline, but he cannot get close enough. He is high above the water; if he slips, he will fall to certain death on the sharp rocks beneath him, pounded by the surf.
The hot blue brilliance of the day seems to have affected the energy of the crew in a similar fashion to that of the passengers—there is little noticeable activity on the deck. A group of sailors sits at the foot of the mainmast, sewing sails and talking in low voices; a group of midshipmen are finishing their calculations on the quarterdeck in silence; and the lieutenants gathered near them are as quiet as the helmsman at the wheel.
He let himself sink slowly, oh so slowly, into the delicious warmth, until the water came up to his chest, lowering himself down until he was leaning against the back of the tub. He let his eyes fall shut and he kept them closed as he rejoiced in the prickly, hot sensation tingling over every inch of his skin.
Sherlock’s eyes rake the surrounding crowd but there’s no sign anywhere of Billy. He wonders if it was Billy who led her here, or if she simply followed the rest of the sailors from the
“Hush. I’ll answer every question you can think of later when you’re feeling stronger but for now, you need to rest.”
John fought for some semblance of control, even as he felt himself slipping, sliding down so easily into the darkness of his own pleasure.
He begins to bob his head in a steady rhythm, sliding his mouth up and down, creating the perfect amount of slick wet friction. Finally, finally, it’s just the right amount of speed, of pressure.
How could he have forgotten? How could he have forgotten how much it means to him just to smell the slight must of the velvet lining the case? The smell of the rosin, the crisp scent of the polished wood rising up to meet him in a fragrant rush of sensory memories, memories of fire lit nights when Sherlock played for Mycroft in a corner of their drafty nursery, rare moments of peace between them that seemed only to come when Sherlock had his violin in hand—memories of colder nights, up on the roof of their vast home, the world spread out at Sherlock’s feet in a tangle of silver-tinted shadows, the cost of slightly frigid fingers worth every moment of blissful solitude he spent, playing to the moon.
They’ve come to a halt by the portside railing and Miss Hooper turns to rest her elbow on the rail, squinting out over the water and chewing on her bottom lip, as though deliberating.
The case had involved exactly the kind of “legwork” that Mycroft found so beneath him, and Sherlock had accepted the case almost immediately, eager for the chance to get out of London. There had been a bit of a lull in the activity of the London criminal classes and John was as eager as Sherlock to get out of Baker Street for a few weeks, and travel to someplace completely different.
Sherlock took another long drink and then stared down at the glass in his hand, turning it this way and that, studying the way the light caught the amber liquid. He started speaking, eyes downcast.
But seeing John now, closer at hand than he has been all morning, his concentration fixed absolutely on the task before him, the sun-bleached hair that’s pushed back from his eyes starting to uncurl from his exertions, the strip of skin visible underneath his jacket glowing in the light of the morning sun, Sherlock finds he’s forced to drop his gaze, so quickly does the blush rise to his cheeks.
He almost can’t watch, but he forces himself not to look away, afraid in some half-formed superstitious way that if he does,
He’s still sitting, naked, on the desk, and as he presses himself forward into John—John who is still somehow wearing his trousers—he remembers with a pleasant shiver of anticipation that John has yet to come.
John holds his mouth there, his breath coming out in warm, unsteady plumes as he continues speaking. “I want to eat you up.”
Not only does this mean one more day until any of them will have the chance to escape this ship—for however brief a time—what’s far more troubling is the news of the captain’s foul temper.
He felt the shudder that went through Sherlock’s body at the contact and his mouth broke away from the side of John’s face with a gasp.
Not only did the sound create another layer of sensation for his wonderfully stimulated cock, but it reminded John how much Sherlock was getting pleasure out of this activity too—maybe almost as much as he was, and he longed to reach down and feel to see if Sherlock was as hard as he imagined, in the expensive material of his dove grey trousers.
“I should hope not!” Dimmock turns back to John, pink-cheeked with indignation. “You’re to come with me, Watson. Lieutenant Lestrade wants a word.”
It was even nicer then he’d imagined it would be after having John’s tongue in his mouth. This John kissed back with intention and made small breathless noises in the back of his throat when Sherlock explored the inside of his bottom lip with his tongue.
“It’s something that happened with Moriarty, isn’t it?” Sherlock’s voice was uncharacteristically soft.
A good while later, red-faced and out of breath, his shirt clinging to his back with sweat, Sherlock takes a step back, lifts a hand. He doesn’t want to suggest they take a break, doesn’t want to give any indication of his own weakness but he’s so hot he’s starting to feel light-headed.
John sets his bag down at his feet before stepping closer to Sherlock to take him by the arms again.
Afterward, Sherlock lies on his bed, staring at the same stained ceiling that he has looked at all the long miserable months he has been at sea, but this time, he does not see the buckled wood, the long, grey watermark that looks like a bulging horse’s head, instead he sees the letters of John’s note, as clearly as if they had been traced there onto the ceiling for him to see, and he reads them over and over and over again.
John remembered the way the late afternoon sun had thrown its gentle light over Sherlock’s motionless, sprawling form, how it had warmed the hollow of his pale chest, his long folded fingers striped with shadows from the half-sunk blinds, the motes of dust caught in the beam of light above him seeming to move in harmony with the rhythm of his words.
How much, John wasn’t sure. But it passed, and it continued passing. He drifted from moment to moment, often feeling as if he’d just woken up. Memories were murky, odd collections of shadows and statements.
Following my walk in the village, I enjoyed some time in the sauna to gather my thoughts and prepare myself for a meeting with the constable, a man by the name of Dimmock. He is a wafish man, thin and sickly looking with a voice pitched higher than I expected. Although he was the one who requested my assistance, he seemed annoyed with my presence, dictating to me the various things he’s done to investigate and asserting that there was no more to be done about it. I assured him that I would inevitably prove him wrong, which earned me a short tempered glare and a curt “guten Nachmittag” (good afternoon). Had you been present, you might have reminded me to mind my manners. Instead, I smiled broadly and tipped my hat, again assuring him that I would have answers by the third day of my holiday in his humble town, despite his insistence that it was futile. One of his deputies ushered me out shortly thereafter, entreating me to avoid their offices in the future.
Do write back and let me know how things at Baker street are holding up. I would love to hear any updates about London, as well. I miss her.
John dragged his feet, stumbling along the sidewalk until they reached the stop. He could see the bus down the street, and of course, Sherlock was right. It was exactly the bus they needed.
John,” I purr, yanking his wrists above his head and capturing his mouth with mine. The kiss is urgent and sloppy, broken by quick gulps of air and muttered curses of passion as our bodies rub against each other, his back arching off the bed to find me. With my free hand I stroke his flank, gripping his hip bone tightly as I rock into him. The contact is enough to make my eyes flutter shut, the beginnings of ecstasy throbbing through me.
let you do it the way you want to. Every time you lay your hands on someone, the quaking inside stops, doesn’t it? When your fist connects with flesh and the bones crack beneath your hands, you can’t help but grin. I saw it when you beat me last week, the
I blink, and when I lift my head I’m no longer in Chinatown searching for him. I’m standing by the pool where Carl Powers was killed. John’s in front of me, torso strapped full of explosives with a terrified, pleading look in his eyes.
“Shut it, Mycroft. I’ll see a doctor, just stop lecturing me. I’m not your little brother,” I interrupt, tone snarky.
“Aye, same, Brodie. I’ll hae a pint, if ye please,” John answered, plopping down on the barstool next to his neighbor. The barkeep set down the heavy glass in front of the man with a wink, wiping the spilt liquid with a towel before moving on. In the corner, a jukebox played some heavy rock music, filling the silence between the two men as they slugged back the cool lager.
I nod at him and grasp his shoulders, taking my first step out of the tub. He feels steady beneath me, supporting all of my weight as I pull my other leg out. Twisting away from me, he grabs a towel from the back of the bathroom door and wraps it around my shoulders, rubbing my biceps to warm me up and dry me off. I would never have allowed this before, even knowing my feelings for him, yet in this moment I find it soothing. It’s the same as the comfortable air we held between us on Sunday mornings, drinking coffee and reading to ourselves. The sunlight would stream in the windows, warm sunbeams falling across our bare feet as Rachmaninoff lilted quietly around us, broken only by the turn of the page or the ruffle of newspaper. Neither of us felt the need to speak--in fact, we would hold these soft moments in reverence, doing all that we could to protect them. I have missed this feeling, the feeling of
Sweaty and sated, John smiled over at Sherlock. His hair was disheveled, curls haphazardly sticking up around his head. He had a pleased sort of smile on his face, the kind that only comes from doing something truly enjoyable.
I glance his way as he looks towards mine, and we hold each other, unspeaking and untouching, for the space of several breaths. There has never been a human on this planet that I could share such nonverbal understanding with until I met Sherlock.
Rushing over to the sink, I turn on the cold water tap and throw my hands under it, the burn from the coffee that splashed all over me immediately relieved. I hear the
“Obviously,” I reply with false sarcasm, rolling my eyes. He smirks and drops the bag in a chair to come help me as I throw the blanket off my lap and swing my legs over the side of the bed.
“It was after I passed out. I never saw the face, but I’m guessing it was Charles going by the brutality of it.” Sherlock frowns, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth before flouncing out of his chair to stalk to the sofa. One large step and he’s standing on the coffee table, his hands in his hair while he whirls about, muttering to himself. I watch for a moment, transfixed by his agitation. His thoughts are moving so quickly, pinging from point to point attempting to draw the lines between them all.
“They’re removing his life support devices and taking him off sedation. It’s likely he will wake soon. I thought perhaps…,” Mycroft explains. His voice sounds so far away, as if he’s talking through the wall. Is he even still here? My ears feel clogged, like I’m underwater.
“They’re always tearing us apart, Sherlock,” the man below me sobs, body shaking. I maneuver myself to view his face, following his gaze up to the hospital bed. He’s staring at Sherlock, defeated, eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot in purple-black pools of bruised skin. “Why can’t we just be together?”
I’m holding him before I realize it, slotting my shoulders under his arm and wrapping myself around his torso for support. His breath is labored, coming out in short gasps. I can feel his chest heaving under my hands, my fingers splayed out amongst his ribs. Suddenly, I feel self consciously aware of how intimate this position is for us, pressed from shoulder to thigh against each other. Each exhale from him bathes the top of my head in warm air, filling my nostrils with his unique musk and tea scent mixed with the chemical, bleach-laden smell of the hospital. It’s an intrusion, pungent. False.
Stepping under the too-hot spray of the shower feels like a benediction. It hits my back first, sliding down the crease between my shoulder blades before falling with large splatters on the floor of the tub. The water runs down my legs, soaking the bandage wrapped around my thigh and stinging my wound. I realize I forgot to ask John if I could get the stitches wet;
than a rugby player,” John argued, already defensive. He was used to proving people wrong about him, showing them how intelligent he was. This would be no different.
Bored with the current track of conversation and disinterested with playing audience to the fireworks, I interject, “
I drain the last of my coffee from the cup, the caffeine already singing in my veins, and set it down on the table next to me. “I remember being at the pub. You...well, not
“Time, yeah, I know. You said that. Time for what, exactly?” I cut him off with a snarl. Raking my hands through my hair, I scratch at my scalp with a groan, encountering more than a few tender spots. A jolt of adrenaline surges through me as Moran suddenly appears before me, his tongue teasing,
Boots crunching on the frost covered ground, John again entered the wood and marveled at the way the air stopped moving. Tall birch trees lined the edge of the forest, their white papery bark peeling and curling around their trunks like holiday ribbon. He resisted the urge to pull at one as he walked by, thrusting his fists deeper into his pockets. Skirting the edge of a small circle of stones, he plunged further into the forest, his hot breath leaving puffs of condensation in the air behind him.
There, that ought to do it. After taping it to his roommate’s bureau, John snatched up his phone and took a few photos. There’s no way Mike would believe him otherwise. And, good to have evidence in case he needed to file any complaints with the headmaster. He hoped it wouldn’t come to that--he’d never had issues with roommates before, and he didn’t particularly want to start now.
needs to be said. John, obviously still tense, clenches his hands into fists and waits, working through his own thoughts and searching for something coherent.
“Wrong,” a gasping, whispering voice breathed into his ear. He swatted at it, feeling the sting of his fingertips against his earlobe as he flinched. Whipping his head around, he searched the trees for the source of his torment, and found only the bleak, stiff wood. Pulling the icy winter air in through his nose, he breathed and stepped out of the stone circle, the toe of his boot hovering above the forest floor.
“What...what d’you...I need to see Sherlock Holmes. He was just brought here by paramedics, he was nearly dead, I need to see him now
The bathroom light is harsh, reflecting off the bright surfaces of the tiled walls and floor, illuminating my face far beyond a level I’m comfortable with. Bruises mottle my jaundiced skin with purple, blue, and yellow discolorations, telling the story of my recent abuses. A patchy, uneven beard and mustache shade my upper lip and jaw, adding to my disheveled appearance. My clothing, ignored until now, hangs at odd angles from the crust of dirt and blood stiffening the fabric. I look
I am a scientist, after all. A man that relies on his senses and recognizes that without an open mind, humanity remains blind.
Dipping my head, I hover my lips in front of his, nearly touching while searching his eyes for any hesitation, anything uncertain. Finding none, I inhale and smile.
, and I finally give in to the sobs that I can feel swelling within me, clawing up and out of my mouth. The first pained sound fills the bathroom and I feel myself falling over the precipice, losing myself completely.
Aside from Mycroft. The dark grey, portly cat appeared in his mind, hopping towards him across the highland plains. Meowing a greeting for John, welcoming him home and reminding him of his growling stomach.
After a few seconds of giving in to my wicked tongue, his hands come between us, pushing me away gently. Not a rejection; just a pause, a moment to catch his breath. “Can you...maybe wait to kiss me until you have some pants on?”
His friend stopped, body going rigid as he blinked owlishly at John. “Whit dae ye mean?” he asked, voice dropping to a whisper. “Nae a body goes intae th’ wuid.” Bringing a hand to rest on John’s forearm, he leaned forward to peer into the man’s face. “Nae a body.”
The sobs in his throat finally broke free, erupting from his slack mouth as he shoved his face into the pillow in an effort to stifle the cracked, embarrassing sound coming from his core. His body shook beneath the sheets, muscles spasming as he finally let go of every false wall he had thrown up around this vulnerable, raw part of him. He cried until he could cry no more, and then laid still, staring at the floor.
“Hey,” John says, concern knitting his eyebrows together as he peers at me. “You look like you’re trapped up there. What are you thinking about?”
“Stop! You’ll pull his arms out of their sockets, you arsehole!” I shout at Charles, every ounce of rage and fear constricting my voice. Sherlock’s assailant relents, choosing instead to release and knock him down, his face slapping against the concrete. I hear the sharp huff of air through his nostrils as he pauses, willing his body to be still.
The man watched his cat, chuckling to himself as the animal waddled around with his low-hanging belly. In the distance, the sun crept higher in the sky, casting long shadows off his small herd of Highland cattle while they grazed in the nearby pasture. He sighed and followed Mycroft into the cabin.
“Mrs. Hudson, you don’t have…” She smiles even wider, her eyes twinkling as she shrugs, feigning innocence.
Mycroft glares, planting his feet in front of me. “And I have private medical staff who will attend to them once I return to my office,” he asserts, tugging a handkerchief out of his waistcoat and dabbing at the blood near his mouth. He glances at it briefly, his nose wrinkling in disgust, before he folds it over the damp spot and tucks it back into his pocket.
The second day they crossed paths, John knew he was blushing, thinking about the previous night, but he still managed a small smile at the gorgeous stranger. The man stared, his head cocked to the side, blinked twice, and looked away. As John passed him, he heard him clear his throat, and he wondered what his voice sounded like.
He shakes his head once, the crease between his eyebrows deepening. His grip on my hands is firm, yet I can feel him shaking.
, Mycroft. Moran is a psychopath, and before the incident at the warehouse his sights were set on me. I am the person who last saw Moriarty alive, and so he clearly blames me for his death. Now, though...now he’s had a personal slight to shift his focus...to John.” He flips the envelope up with a flick of his fingers, address label facing us.
His form, blurred by the shower door, is stock still. His fists are clenched, resting on his thighs, and his back is ramrod straight, face turned towards the ceiling.
What would Sherlock say about that? He’s a pragmatist--surely he’d realize that Moran’s death would be the most efficient way to solve our problem. Charles is hardly invested enough to pick up the mantle and run a “consulting criminal” organization--he’ll flee to the next villain looking for a grunt, to the next opportunity to carry out his sadistic fetishes.
Sherlock paused, cocking his head to the side and nosing into John’s beard. The man felt a smile against his neck as Sherlock continued nuzzling him, clearly pleased with his admission. John returned the smile, pulling his arms around the lithe form. He dared not think about his lie, for he knew Sherlock possessed the ability to know his thoughts. Despite the war in his mind, he knew one thing was certain--he needed an escape route.
He’s right, of course. A few bills and adverts, nothing more. Mrs. Hudson sees me when I return, and she sweeps me up into a tight, motherly hug.
Hearing about his time before the wood cleared the haze in John’s head enough that he realized he needed to remember this name of his before Sherlock overtook him again. Keeping one hand embedded in the head of curls in his lap, he used the other to draw his name in the dirt floor of their cave near the wall so it wouldn’t be disturbed.
He hums in agreement and tightens his hand around mine as if strengthening his resolve. Always the soldier. No backing out now.
I’m staring at the door and feel my heart thundering in my chest, blood pumping in my ears with a sudden surge of anxiety. What lies beyond that door? What happens when I open it back up again? I suppose I never really closed it all the way in the first place. I pulled it as shut as I could, but the secrets of that life continued to spill through the cracks, bleeding out until they finally overtook me completely. The life that

my mantra at the moment, repeats itself over and over in my head, coinciding with the pulse that’s throbbing in my ears.
, Sherlock--you are--but I want--” Squirming beneath me, he twists his wrists out of my grasp and flips us over easily, his strength evident in his sweat-slicked muscles as they bulge in his arms and shoulders while he pins me. Dropping his head to my chest, he sucks one of my nipples into his mouth, laving it rhythmically with his tongue and causing zings of pleasure to spark straight down to my already aching cock.
The fabric was warm against his skin. As he pulled on his boots, he noticed they had been scrubbed clean of the dried, grey dirt that had adorned them all winter.

The air that met him was warm, warmer than he ever remembered this area of Scotland being, even in the middle of summer. Sweat beaded on his forehead and above his upper lip as he made his way back towards the wood, though he knew not where or what he was fleeing from. His legs needed to move, needed to carry him away from the not-his-house and the not-his-cat.
“You shouldn’t be here,” the voice murmured as the body behind me pressed into mine, threatening to crush me against the wardrobe. “You
As I move next to the table, John shifts uncomfortably and clears his throat while staring, in shock, down at the pile of his letters to me. “Oh, I didn’t realize...I thought Mrs. Hudson would have binned them,” John says sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck while he regards the pile on the kitchen table. “I’ll just--” He reaches out to snatch them up, but my reflexes are quicker, my hand resting on top of the pile. His fingertips brush the back of my knuckles and he jerks back, flinching as if burned. I can’t help but wince. “Sherlock, you don’t want to read these,” he warns, glancing sideways at me. His face is twisted, contorted. “I can’t even...I can’t even remember what’s in them, but I know they aren’t--”
“Charles, give John some motivation to be polite, will you?” I hear before pain shoots through my side, electricity sparking up into my ribcage and constricting my lungs. Groaning, I pull my legs up and curl into the fetal position, willing the throb in my lower back to subside.
Grinning against his skin, I reply, “Good,” before settling back down next to him and pulling the duvet and sheets over us. Our breathing relaxes while we lay together, listening as the rain lulls us back into the familiar silence of each others’ company. As my eyelids grow heavy and my vision blurs, exhausted with the events of the day and the stress of external threats, he shifts against me and clears his throat to speak.
All at once, the unknown force released his arm, which fell stiffly to his side while he collapsed to his knees on the path. The damp of the rotten leaves slowly soaked through the knees of his trousers, sending a chill up his thighs as he cradled his injured wrist. Silent tears streamed out of his icy blue eyes, the warmth a welcome shock on his cold-numb and ruddy cheeks. Letting them slide slowly open, he cocked his head to side and glanced behind him.
John’s fingers are moving meditatively against the skin of Sherlock’s belly, through the hair below his belly button. Sherlock shivers in appreciation, pushes closer back against John’s hips.
the feel of him, hot and hard and aching under Sherlock’s hands, it’s like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced—Sherlock can feel his own cock bearing heavily down against John’s thigh as his own desire swells in the wake of John’s. He feels John’s fingers tighten against the flesh of his arse in response, dragging Sherlock closer against him.
He felt Sherlock pull the material down his hips and then his broad palms were sliding up over the tensed muscles standing out in John’s thighs, his dark head bent in reverent contemplation over the cock-shaped bulge in John’s pants.
There is something raw in his voice, a longing that resonates through every word, the depth of emotion in each note so present that Sherlock feels an ache in his chest at the sound. Sherlock is certain then that if anyone else were to sing this particular song, it wouldn’t be half so full of feeling. But listening to John sing it, the downturned corners of his sorrowful mouth as he sings the refrain, it hits Sherlock like a punch to the gut.
Sherlock disappeared and returned moments later with the extensive medical kit John kept on hand for emergencies. It hadn’t take him long to learn that living with Sherlock meant medical emergencies were practically a daily occurrence, so the kit was well supplied.
Colonel Jackson has gone to stand at the gratings. He’s peering down through the latticework to the deck beneath, his face still the same deadly pale color.
Sherlock watches John intently for several seconds, and then raises his own dripping brush to the bulwark, copying John’s movements.
Sherlock eats the cold bread and cheese scarcely tasting it, his eyes fixed on the shimmer of blue beyond the windows, puzzling over the event of the poisoning in his mind. What could be the reason for it? Who would have cause to poison Lieutenant Lestrade?
The disinterest of his parents came as no surprise but Mycroft’s abandonment of Sherlock had come as rather a nasty shock. When the subject of Sherlock’s shipment to the East Indies had first arisen, Sherlock had vehemently protested, and he had expected Mycroft to stand by him in acknowledging that the suggestion was a preposterous one. However, much to Sherlock’s horror, Mycroft had been the biggest proponent of the plan, stating that he believed the voyage would do Sherlock “a world of good.” Indeed, it had been due to Mycroft’s insistence that his parents hadn’t completely forgotten about the idea altogether.
Sherlock went on talking, his eyes breaking away from John’s, almost stumbling over the words in his hurry to get them out.
From this angle, he could just make out the fringe of Sherlock’s eyelashes against his cheek, the bone in his jaw as sharp as a blade.
If John were really suffering, how awful would it be for him to have to constantly try and act otherwise?
He opens his eyes and sees John leaning over him, dripping wet, storm-blue eyes dark with worry. His clothes are soaked through, his shirt sticking to his chest, the blue kerchief around his neck, dark and dripping. His face is creased with concern, deep lines around his mouth and eyes.
There is an expression of such pure unadulterated excitement on John’s face that Sherlock feels his own heart begin to pound against his ribcage in response.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Oh please. They only sell it in the Virgin Islands, and I know this is your first voyage. Besides, no midshipman could ever afford it.”
