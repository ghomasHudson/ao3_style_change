“Yeah, it’s just been … a long couple of days,” Steve said, which was unbearably true, and he felt a pang in his chest with how much he missed Tony suddenly, even with everything hanging over his head.
really cold. Dr. Stark is going to see a hell of a lot more than his bare chest, so there’s no reason to suffer if he doesn’t have to.
Tony made a face, but he didn’t push, and Steve suspected Tony would know more about Steve’s mission than he knew himself by the time Steve got to SHIELD. “Call me when you can,” Tony just said and then kissed Steve roughly, as if Steve needed more reasons to come back as soon as he could.
“You alright there?” Tony asked, his voice breathy, because even though he’d been half hard since seeing him in the doorway, Steve’s reaction had catapulted him to completely erect and desperate to get naked in the span of about zero point seven seconds.
“I’m visiting a friend of mine up in Rathburn,” Steve said, mentioning the town two hours north.  “A mutual friend of ours died a little over a year ago,” he said, his voice rough, his gaze disturbingly
Tony raised his hands, making sure Natasha saw that they were completely out of range of the fabulous breasts he was currently sporting.
“We’re supposed to have sex,” he said, tearing the bandage off, becase there was no way to break the news gently to him. “You’re supposed to … .” He took a deep breath. “You’re supposed to fuck me.”
Damn it. Steve kind of wants to curl into a ball and moan for a while. That’s not really an option, however, so there’s nothing left to do but stiffen his spine and throw all his clothes into the hamper, take one long,
“It’s not going to be that bad!  I’ll be there, too, and I’ll field all the difficult questions.  Just . . . be yourself.  It’ll be fine.  And, um, don’t flinch or anything when I kiss you.  Okay, so that’s it then,” Tony said, leaning forward to put his cup into a holder
For the prompts “marriage proposals” (cap_ironman bingo) and "pretending to be a couple" (avengers_tables).  Just another one of those fics that have been sitting around for forever and won't ever be finished.  Apparently I have a lot more of these than I thought.
For a second, it seems like Dr. Stark is going to say something—but then he sighs quietly instead and all that comes out is, “I’ll leave you to get dressed then.”
“Ni—” He barely kept himself from saying that Nick had implied Tony knew about Insight. “I thought that—”
Okay, that’s a lie. He totally understands how he’d gotten desensitized considering everything Dr. Stark had been doing and everything he’d been feeling as a result, but still. It smells like his bedroom on the last day of a really intense heat, and they’re not even done yet. They haven’t even gotten to the actual
, Captain,” she said, her voice hitching. She cleared her throat. “Now if you’ll just take off your clothes down to your underwear, the doctor will be in shortly.”
And even though Tony had already promised to be in the same room, with Steve’s sight and hearing taken away, it’d basically be the same to him, and wasn’t that why Tony had done it in the first place? So he could be there but without Steve knowing how much he was coming apart?
He spent some time just petting Steve and telling him how well he'd done, easing Steve down and letting Tony keep touching him. After all of that, he was achingly hard, but there were more important things to tend to, like Steve's knees, which, since Tony had just been on the ground himself, he was sure needed a break, so he helped Steve turn until he was sitting on the bench. Once he was certain Steve was more comfortable, he turned the rest of the spray toward him so he’d be warm, and then he sat next to him, pressed to his side, slowly stroking his thigh while he rubbed the fingers of his right hand together, remembering how it felt to have Steve squeeze tight around them.
“I didn’t think you wanted me back. I was trying to respect that,” Steve said, all wounded eyes, and bullshit. Bull. Shit.
good, never touching the head of his cock, only using one finger to fuck himself with, going slowly enough that Tony was tempted to call him on following the letter and not the spirit of his instructions. He didn’t, though, because Steve loved and hated being edged, and his machinations were kind of adorable.
Steve doesn’t mean to cry out, but he’s barely started to come down from his orgasm, and while he realizes Dr. Stark isn’t actually going faster or pressing harder than before, Steve is so oversensitized that it feels like he is. Dr. Stark is so deep now, so fucking deep, and Steve doesn’t understand how it still can’t be enough.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Tony said, but then he winked. “Not that I don’t appreciate the results. But you look gorgeous, whatever you’re wearing, and I’d much rather have you here as soon as possible than wait while you put on clothes I’m just going to take off a minute later.”
Warnings: Morning after a drunken binge, waking up naked with someone you don’t know, references to getting drunk by imbibing alcohol from an orifice that is not the mouth
Unbonded Omegas, on the other hand, were a different matter.  He definitely didn’t want to be the focus of any of their fantasies, not when Omegas could go into heat at the drop of a hat.  It was like puberty where a stray breeze could cause a boner, but one hundred times worse.
He was a sham. A complete and utter shame of a CEO. He should have stood firm in moving forward with his original plan, but now there was no way this would ever get done.
Rumlow’s hand jerked back from the arc reactor as if it had been bitten by a snake. His body tensed up. His hand remained hovering in midair. Tony watched in stunned shock as the life drained from Runlow’s eyes. Slowly, he tipped over to the side and fell off Tony in a cloud of dust. The flesh around a black hole in Rumlow’s temple pulsed red with what little was left of Rumlow’s life force.
“Look, you want in or not?” Natasha was getting impatient. “Take it or leave it, but I ain’t offering this to anyone else. And as much as you may or may not like it, I have a job to do. So?” She gave each of the boy’s critical looks, daring them to back down now. “Are you in or out?”
That got Steve to raise an eyebrow. “Really?” he asked in muted disbelief. “You're soliciting those assets? I thought you gave up spying when we got you out of Russia.”
Tony quickly turned his attention to his pet projects.  None of that mattered right now. “If you see him, tell him I’m not home at the moment. Don’t want to ruin the surprise. Diagrams and pictures on the wall might not give him the right idea. Iron Family stuff and all that.”
The world froze for a second as Steve waited, neither of them moving. It felt like the ground would fall out from under him any minute. Steve’s body trembled, Did he say too much? Was he too forward?  God, why hadn’t he agreed to let Bucky set him up?
Steve just stared at the card. He read over the silver writing twice, and then a third and fourth time. Was it true? Where his eyes deceiving him.
“I have to wonder though,” Steve closed the hatch with a gentle thump and pulled Tony out of his day dream (or night dream. Or was it just a dream since it was already night time?) Steve rubbed the back of his neck with a large calloused hand. His body was directed at Tony, but his eyes were darting around to everything but him. “Why are you so okay with the fact that I’m…well, we’re-”
Tony wanted to ask if she would be okay. Pepper handled a lot of his dirty work: clothes, schedule, people, female guests, occasional male guests, but dead and almost dead bodies… Clint usually took care of those. But they didn’t have the option now. If the bodies hadn’t been taken care of by now, it was necessary. Iron Man was too far up the chain of command to get his hands dirty like this, and War Machine and Hawkeye were down for the count. It had to be her. Tony had every confidence that Rescue could handle the job, but the person inside the suit. The person burred under the persona. Pepper.
Bruce sighed. “Well then, tell them to take some painkillers and call me in the morning if it continues to hurt.”
A need, an itch that had been burning under his skin the second he stepped off dry land. It was a secret he was born with. Something so personal and dangerous that, if discovered, could land his ass first on a dissection table or spirited away to some secret lab hidden far away from civilization while they broke him down to his last molecule.
“And yet here I am; a successful entrepreneur with a thriving rehabilitation center airing my grievances out to one of the creatures I should be healing. What am I even doing here? I could be helping you. I could be helping so many magical creatures in need, and yet all I can think about is how miserable it is to be single.”
“I’ll need a place to work eventually," mused Tony as they boarded the elevator to the top floors of SI. "Some place to stretch my legs and keep all hours of the night. Would it bother you too much if I use your office? I remember loving the view as a kid."
“Just let me do this one thing for you,” he begged, barely breathing. “I haven’t had a lot of good news today.”
He remembered their escape as no more than a blur of shadows, red bricks, and dark corners until Steve set him down against a wooden crate. Tony looked around with lidded eyes. He has no idea where they were. Only that there was a bright white light above, white washed walls, a back door, and the sounds of an infrequent wind down the alley. Probably meant they were close to a main street and traffic.
He gave Tony’s cock a few more good sucks before releasing Tony’s member with a loud pop. White come glistened on his lips. “Good morning, beautiful,” Steve said with a satisfied smile. His cheeks were flushed red.
“Maybe I did, but I’m not the only one at fault here. You have your secrets too. Why didn’t you say something?”
“Like this?” asked Steve. He cautiously approached the counter and patted the dome of the dough as if he was powdering a baby’s butt.
“But you haven’t seen yourself the past few days,” Rhodey insisted. “Tones, you’re a mess. We know you’re driven to get the guys who took your heart. But the last few days have been the worse we’ve ever seen. You’ve been running yourself ragged building and inventing and frankly it’s beginning to scare us.”
Over the past two weeks, Tony had gotten better about it all. And despite the mountain of work and stress that Tony found himself drowning in, Steve thought he was slowly working his way into getting a straight answer out of Tony. But after today’s call, he wasn’t quite sure. Tony seemed interested, but maybe he really wasn’t. Maybe Tony was just saying things to placate Steve. But that didn’t make any sense. If he was just trying to entertain Steve and his simple hope for something more, why would Tony go to all the trouble of getting Steve in touch with the Iron Family? It just didn’t make sense.
Steve bit down on his tongue and let Tony do his thing. He was happy sitting in silence, but Tony seemed unnerved by it. “If you really need an excuse,” he said as if Steve needed a reason to let another man tend to his wounds. “Just think of this as payment for the favor.”
Bucky hissed as Natasha dabbed an antibacterial wipe across his shoulder. “Not bad. Couple of bruises, few scratches, nothing my healing factor can’t take care of in a few hours.”
“Over down here.” Steve clumsily pulled Tony down a sharp turn and forced him down into a crouch. “Hopefully all that should buy us a little time.”
was more than enough rubbernecking for Tony Stark, thank you very much. “Now can I go after my weapons?”
“Didn’t expect to see you here. I thought everyone would be at home tonight.  It is Christmas after all, no matter how little snow is on the ground.”
“If I did care that you blabbed, I wouldn’t have the mercy to shoot you in the head,” Iron Man said, cocking back the smoking weapon. “If we didn’t need that info out there, I’d shoot you in the knees and then strap you to the tracks for the 5 o’clock train.”
“We can’t do nothing Steve,” Bucky whispered, biting into an apple. “Parks are public property.  Can’t start a fight on open turf. We got a rep to keep intact.”
Bucky’s hand stopped centimetres away from unsettling the gray dust on the unlabelled lid. “Good point,” he said, gingerly moving away. Maybe that brain of his was working after all.
"Might also want to put a few extra eyes on the street and in the air if we want to have a clean run. Looks like we got some new neighbors moving in." Sam flashed a copy of the morning rag.
Tony shook his head. He couldn’t let doubt could his vision. He was Iron Man. He shouldn’t be intimidated by a bunch of thugs just because they go their hands on some big guns. He had bigger, better guns than they would ever have, and he’d use them to take those scum loving bastards out one by one so they suffered a long, painful death.
Tony took a moment to look down at his arm. The blood was beginning to clot, but it still looked like a mess. “It’s fine. Just another workplace hazard. Happens all the time.”
Blood rush to Steve’s cheeks. “Tony,” Steve hissed, covering his boyfriend’s mouth. “Not now. Kid just went to sleep. What if he hears you?’
Tony slammed down the receiver with a loud groan. He rubbed the bridge of his nose in visual frustration. “Is the world out to get me, or do I have a sign on my back right now begging for my ass to be kicked?”
“Does that mean you’re going to let him skip on his vegetables too?” asked Clint. “Shouldn’t do that. Kids need their nutrients and that’s a steep hill you’re climbing, Steve.”
Thor and Sam looked at one another, a silent debate passing between them. “Our alliance lies with the Captain,” summarized Thor. “You have our trust until he says otherwise. But be warned, I will not hesitate to dismember you if you betray us.”
Taking his chance, Tony leapt out from his hiding place and started firing at the faceless goons cowering behind wooden crates. They put up a good fight, but small handguns were no match compared to the Iron Family’s custom made weapons. A lot of his shots missed, but they were close enough that it seemed to be scaring the living shit out of them. Even with one repulsor, he had them cowering for cover.
“Are you shitting me!?” Sam nudged Bucky in the side, hard. With a wince, Bucky gave Wilson a hard glare. The bruises for the beating were still a sickening yellow coloring his sides. “What?” he demanded, unhappy at the harsh irritation.
“All the more reason to get your affairs in order,” the doctor almost whispered as he made his way over to the bar.
“I don’t want to be too cocky, but I think it looks good. What do you think?” asked Steve as he stepped back from the board.
“I have no idea what you mean mister,” said the towering giant of a man, with the largest most innocent looking baby blue eyes Steve could muster without looking like a fag.
“Pepper!” Tony greeted her with a wide smile and a kiss on the cheek. “Love of my life. Please save me from the boring pleasantries that is meeting and greeting every soul in the company.”
Tony rubbed his nose and sniffed. “No,” he said. Tony hiccupped a few times as he attempted to control his emotions. His shaking hands calmed down to a small, almost unnoticeable tremble.
“And does he know about…” Rhodey waved a hand around to all the stuff in the lab, but Tony knew he meant much more that what could immediately be seen.
“Tony, babe,” Steve said, his voice slowly breaking through the haze. “It’s okay. You’re safe. I’m here. He’s safe. We’re safe. Everything’s going to work out.”
“And didn’t even need a loan to get ‘em. Looks like somebody has been able to take care of herself,” Sam joked, trying to lighten the mood.
Tony turned up the attitude to ten. “I have every right. It’s my name on the building, my name on the weapons, and me who gets blamed when shit happens. Because, guess what, shit happened. I just got a report, from a very reliable source, that one of our grenades brought down a building on someone. And I’m not talking about a metaphorical building here Obie. I’m talking literal, physical bricks, cement, metal pipes, and dead human bodies falling down on someone in the middle of civilian filled Brooklyn. Brooklyn, Obie! I may not be a fan of the place, but I sure as hell don’t want weapons with my name on it going off in civilian filled areas. It’s more than just bad for business. It’s negligent.”
Bruce sighed. “Not much we didn’t already know,” he said, plopping down in one of the seats. “Hit on the shop was coordinated by someone in Hydra, but the guy you brought me ain't spilling on who.”
A smile broke across the kid’s face faster than you could say ‘America’. He looked like a kid who had just landed feet first in the best candy shop in the world. “Did you hear that, Steve? I can keep him!” he yelled, running straight into Steve’s arms.
“In any case,” said Tony, desperate for a change of topic, “ I’ll get the fryer going so we can start feeding the boys outside. Natasha?”
With that smile on Steve’s face that just made Tony’s world turn, Steve took his hand and allowed Tony to pull the big, blond, and no longer angry street boss into the tightest hug Iron Man could offer.
Pistol to the ground, Steve cautiously passed row after row of dark storage units. The sounds of bullets and battle cries felt far behind him.
“Explain later. Just help me get this shit off him so we can get him in the car,” grumbled Tony, fingers fast at work to remove as much of Rhodey’s armor as he could. Never mind how much it cost to make the armor. It did its job. It protected Rhodey’s heart, and now Tony needed to get it off.
“No.” Tony’s curt reply came out more abrasive than he would have liked. “This isn’t your fight Steve.”
“Barton. I thought you were surveying,” Tony was suddenly conscious of the location of his hand on his assistant’s ass. When did that get there?
“I know you’ve been through a lot. SHIELD gave me your file,” Tony said as he pushed the wolf’s dinner through the doggy door. “Forced to perform in a circus. Put on display for everyone to look at you. I can’t even begin to imagine what that would have been like.”
Unlike most people Steve had interrogated in the past, Joe didn’t break a sweat. With slow and careful hands, the man reached into his breast pocket. “Phil Coulson. Information broker for The Daily Shield,” he said, slowly relinquishing a business card.
“Code names, cute,” Bruce replied, though his tone held no hint of patronized superiority. “This is War Machine.” He motioned to the unmoving statue of a man. “He’ll be providing support if things go sideways.”
Fixing someone’s scooter by the looks of it. Pocket knife in hand with various tools sticking out of his pockets, Tony was the epitome of pure concentration. Without a hat, Steve got a good look at the disheveled brown hair, elegant against the plains of his head. His eyes were cool and focused as his tongue darted back and forth across his plump lips. Steve’s fingers began to twitch in anticipation. His eyes darted back and forth across the scene in front of him, breaking down all the little details that made this moment perfect. He needed to capture it. He needed to get it all down.
“What?” A cold panic settled in his chest. Tony scrambled to get up. "How the fuck did they find one? I thought had every last one dismantled after we stormed the Ten Rings’ base.”
Iron Man stared down Clint with cold eyes as he pulled back on the trigger. He felt a satisfying chill run down his back as the associates looked away. The resulting shot was deafening as it echoed throughout the damaged building.
Sorry about the wait guys. Chapter 9 ended up being MUCH longer than could have expected (*cries at the word count*). And when I started writing Chapter 10, I realized I need to hold onto it a little longer. But this part is ready to go, so here you are!
He let out a deeply tired sigh and turned away from his friend. “Don’t know what he saw in me to draw me so good. Guess I’ll never know now.”
“I thought everything would be better,” said Tony. He tried his best to hold back his emotions (“To be a man,” like his father said) but the cracks in his defenses grew bigger and bigger with each second.
He swelled a little with pride. One of Tony’s inventions that wasn’t reliant on arc reactor tech or, more importantly, owned by the government.  A mounted crossbow that folded up to hide along the length of a person’s arm. Easily concealed by a thick enough sleeve, but getting the string to maintain the tension between rest and active combat was a hell of a problem to solve. Took twenty six prototypes and four hundred seventy three test dummies before Clint was satisfied with the results.
“You sure?” asked Steve. He didn’t want to push too much, but it really looked like there was something important on the boy’s mind. Something must be holding him back.
"Tony," it seemed like the only coherent thought Steve could say. "You really didn't have to.” A part of him was yelling to give it back. Steve didn’t need charity from Tony, and he didn’t have time to dwell on such trivial things when the gang was supposed to come first in his life. But his hands held on tightly to the supplies as he brought the pad up to his chest. The solid surface pressed into his chest like it was meant to be there. No matter what his brain was telling him, Steve didn’t want to let go.
Rhodey didn’t look happy with that answer, but this wasn’t his choice. It was Tony’s. Just like it was Tony's choice to date Steve. “Well, if you do feel anything, let us know. Natasha is driving. Bruce is trying to sift through the data we salvaged. Bucky would help but he’s, well, Bucky. Clint might know what to do if the kid wakes up. He’s the only one with parenting experience.”
How much time did Tony have before the donut truck had to move to the next army base? They never stayed in one place for more than a week. Sometime they stuck around for a mere three days. Sometimes one. Could Tony attract and woo a legendary American soldier into the back of his car in less than one day? Impossible. The numbers were against him no matter how hard he tried to make it work. Tony would have to be either very brave or extremely foolish to try something as risky as that.
. Your well-being means more to me than, than trying out a new toy, or whatever plan I had for the night, or any anger I might feel at the time. I’m not—” Tony let out a huff of laughter, but it sounded ragged. “Doms aren’t perfect. We make mistakes, but we have to trust that our Subs will let us know when that happens. It’s not a
“It’s just my luck that I get handcuffed to the epitome of male perfection, and I am too drugged to do anything about it.”
There’d always been something about Tony that got to him.  The first time they’d met had been at Pepper’s birthday party, Tony stumbling in as most people were getting ready to leave.  Steve had thought he’d been drunk from the way he was acting and had pulled him aside, telling him off for being rude and obnoxious on Pepper’s special day.
Natasha gave Tony an amused grin. Flattered, but compliments weren’t going to distract her from her goal. “How is he? I don’t see him,” she said, craning her neck around the rehabilitation center.
Tony grinned. Oh, this was going to be fun. He wrapped his arms around the back of Steve’s neck, seductively grinding his hips against the growing bulge in Steve’s pants to capture his ‘attention’. “In that case, I’ll give you a private lesson. We got a tent on the far side of camp just for these kinds of situations.”
Just as their lips were about to touch, a loud noise broke through the tension. Tony whipped around to the service window just in time to see at least five heads duck down and out of sight.
Sam placed both hands on Steve’s shoulders. He pushed Steve up and started ushering him away from the chairs. As Steve made his way toward the washroom, he heard Thor and Sam whisper amongst themselves.
“I know that. Daddy tells me to think critically all the time,” said Tony. He picked up the fork and knife and gently tapped them against each other as if they were dolls. “Hey, Steve?” asked Tony as he waved the fork and knife back and forth in the air.
He’d heard enough. One hand reached under his jacket to the holster wrapped around his chest. Feeling the cold familiar metal in his hand, Iron Man pulled out the weapon and pointed the barrel at Barton. His heart and head were steady in the tense air. His body was apprehensive, but controlled. Unlike the nerves of the new associates. Their eyes were the size of saucers as they looked on. Each one clung to the others like helpless rats. Apparently, they were not used to seeing disciplinary action.
But true to his word, Tony started walking straight for the exit. As Tony pulled one shoulder back to shimmy past Steve, the blond man grabbed Tony’s arm and pulled him close. “You’re not really going to leave him like this, right?” he hissed into Tony’s ear.
The kid looked at Tony. Then Steve. Then back at Tony. “What aren’t you telling me? Is it one of those things you’ll tell me when I get older?”
Well, it certainly wasn't going to be the only sketch of Tony Steve would draw in the book. He already was making plans for each stick of charcoal. "Yeah," Steve said in a soft voice that was almost too soft for his own ears. "That would be nice"
“Yeah, and look at all the good that did us,” Tony said with a snort, as he shoved his emotional baggage back down. He could always work through the trauma another day. “We can talk about reasons later. Right now, I want my weapons back and I want you to hit the track and get out of harm’s way.”
Slowly, Tony cracked open his eyes and saw red. Gorgeous, flaming red hair that belonged to his favorite assistant. “Hey Pep,” he mumbled, slurring the words together. “I ever tell you how pretty you are? Like, really pretty? Like, prettier than Lady Liberty herself.”
Metal scraped against concrete as Tony tried to right himself. But it was no use. Rumlow’s bruising grip held Tony in place. As much as he tried, Tony couldn’t kick himself free. He was stuck. “War Machine!”
“Of course not, Tony. No one could even come close to replacing Howard," reassured Stane. "No, I brought you here to begin your own legacy. Perfect timing, if I do say so myself. Morale is low. The fall in stock hit us hard. Had to let go of a few thousand workers. But this is your chance to step out of your father’s shadow and make a name for yourself. To do something. To make something only Tony could do. Not Howard. Make a name for yourself. Make the 'S'in SI stand for Tony Stark not Howard Stark."
“Tony,” Stane ruined the fun. As usual. “I hate to be a busy body, but we need something to show the board. We’re meeting with them this afternoon, remember? A prototype, a model, a sketching on a napkin. Anything you can give them.”
Steve blinked in confusion. Did she know? He hadn’t been that careless about his relationship with Tony, had he?
“Excuse me?” said Tony, not really sure if he heard the request correctly. “You want me to teach you how to make donuts?”
His problems didn’t even include the trouble Tony would be in when the Iron Family found out. Fuck. Steve almost forgot about that little aspect of mafia families. Not only would Steve be punished for finding out, but Tony would also be punished for letting the proverbial cat out of the bag.
Tony let out a shaky breath. He couldn’t let this continue for much longer. He wanted the fight to stop, but there was no safe way of doing so. He hated doing this, but Bucky was a were. He could talk care of himself. Hopefully. Probably.
Everything happened so fast. Tony tried to get between the wolves to break up the fight. He yelled “Stop!” and “Break it up!” but his cries fell on deaf ears. The weres darted back and forth among the trees, trying to get the upper hand on each other. Tony got close to grabbing Bucky’s scruff, but the wolf darted out of the way at the last second. He was about to try again when one of the wolves got a little too close and knocked him off balance.
Let's hope I got everything in for a coherent story. Thanks everyone for the kudos and the comments! Since I'm starting from scratch, I think I might switch to once a month update unless I can crank these chapters out faster. But, I'm coming up on the climax, so we'll see.
Sam didn’t believe him. “Bullshit!” he said, reaffirming his grip on Steve’s pulsating body. He pushed down at just the right spot for pain to replace red anger. Sam moved his face down so all Steve could focus on was the black face opposite his. “Now I can either hold you down all day, or you can calm the fuck down and tell me what the hell is going on.”
“I mean, I know I’m not as young as those kids you see dancing at clubs, but I’m still a catch, right? I got a stable job, a roof over my head, friends, hobbies. Sure, I have my vices, but who doesn’t? All those kids swiping left because they have these ridiculous expectations. No bears, no old guys, no fatties, no drama, no queens, no fems, no baggage, no bisexuals or pans because you’re not a real gay unless you only like dick. Must be over six feet tall, must have at least a six-pack to even be in the running, do you see what I mean, Steve? It gets old fast.”
“Who told you?” Stane’s face twisted into something hideous. Classic intimidation tactic. Luckily, Tony didn’t fall for that shit easily.
“Well, tell me next time you set me up like that,” grumbled Steve. “Almost got chewed out because of your little surprise.”
They sat there a few minutes, Rhodey giving Tony the accusatory eye and Tony pretending it didn’t exist. Eventually, he got tired of the look. “What?” he asked, not bothering to look up from the wielding.
“Yeah,” said Steve with hesitation in his voice. There was a flash of something complicated on Steve’s face, but in the blink of an eye the emotion was gone. Tony was okay with that. He could wait until Steve was ready. Trust took time. Tony held his own secrets close to his heart (Rhodey might even say ‘literally’ close to his heart) but Tony understood. Maybe, one day, they could be in a place where they could be honest with each other. Maybe after Tony was out of the mafia business. He didn’t think Steve would approve of that.
“What look?” asked Tony. He didn’t have a look. Did he? Of course he didn’t. That was impossible. Was it? He was thinking about Steve, not some pretty dame on his arm. That was the look Rhodey was talking about, right? Thinking about pretty dames, wasn't on his radar. Besides, Steve would be much better than any random dame.  Dressed to the nines in a well fitted tux, blue eyes shining like sapphires from the flashing photographers.
Tony grinned. Oh, they definitely weren’t talking about food anymore. “I’m interested in teaching you. Maybe after a few lessons you can join the donut truck, become partners, maybe even something more? You know, if you’re interested. I hear the benefits are very good,” said Tony, turning the flirt up to eleven. Now that Tony knew Steve was interested and they had a little privacy,  Tony had to make up for his lack of game earlier. Steve was an impressive man in more ways than one. He deserved to be wooed off his ass.
“I’ll take you to see him,” she said with a haughty air.  “However, he’s a very busy man, so I can’t guarantee that he’ll talk to you-”
“With what?” demanded Dr. Banner. “Can you tell the difference between a brachialis, a biceps brachii, or a brachioradialis? How about knowing which tools to use for foreign objects of various sizes, shapes, or mass? Know anything about that?”
“No!” Tony insists, cradling the touch closer to his body. There was no way he was going to let Steve touch him now. Whether it was punches of disgust or touches of reverence, Tony wouldn’t be able to resist, and he needed to resist everything about Steve with all his might. “I just got caught up in the moment, that’s all. Just try to forget about it.”
“I beg to differ,” interrupted a voice. Steve froze. Caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He tried to play it off as cool as he could, but a quick look around revealed that he wasn’t the only one feeling on edge.
As the sun began to set and the bright blue of the sky began to fade, Tony took shelter under a large blue and white beach umbrella. He had moved the wooden table and two recliner chairs off the beach house patio and onto the sand so he could watch Steve fish for their dinner. Well, it would be more accurate to say Steve was chasing their dinner.
Within seconds, red and gold scales hidden under his skin slipped through his fleshy membrane and covered his entire lower body. His legs fused together, muscles and bones rearranging themselves to form a single, powerful tail. The slight webbing between his toes stretched and grew until they formed a translucent red fin. The gills around his neck fluttered like wings as they stretched to life.
Tony cleared his throat. Thank goodness Steve wasn’t the only one nervous. “Short version, it’s a machine that keeps me alive. I had to install in myself after the Ten Rings gang hit my Boston hideout with a Jericho missile.”
Steve ducked under a few low hanging beams and carefully began his inspection of the cargo bay. It was the only place Tony could have snuck away to without running into anybody.
Pepper silently rolled her eyes in irritation. “Should be taken to the fifth floor and up the chain of command. I’ll check it before sending it off, but please remember next time. I can’t keep checking your work every time you make a mistake. I already have enough on my plate dealing with Mister Stark.”
“And what happens if you die Steve?” Tony yelled, forcing his way into Steve’s face. “What happens if you get caught in the crossfire? What then? That’s another death that I caused, more innocent blood on my hands, and I don’t want that to happen to you!”
“Come on, Steve!” Tony said, trying to be as encouraging as possible while also fearing for the were’s safety. “You can do it.”
Only a few hours after his encounter with the illusive Phil, Steve realized that he never got a reply from Tony. In his embarrassed adrenaline high state, Steve had planted a rushed kiss and dashed off to find a cab before he could get turned down. But would Tony have turned him down? Tony hadn’t kissed him back, he hadn’t said ‘I love you too,’ but he had definitely shown signs that he wanted to do so before the firefight that fated night. Didn’t he? The thoughts of doubt assaulted his psyche so bad that the next morning he sprinted to the nearest phone to call St. Mary’s Hospital.
“Oh. Okay. Thank for telling me,” he said, looking relieved. “But I’m not really interested in spending time with girls.”
Steve let out a weak laugh. Tony seemed so small now. It would take no effort to push Tony out of the way and out of his life forever. With a low voice, he looked down his nose at the poor man. “Tony, if I were you, I would stay the hell out of my way.”
“No, you don’t,” Bruce rolled his eyes in amusement. “But if you’re looking for a scapegoat, might I suggest our resident marksman.”
Tony became deathly still. Despite the pain of his wounds, he still felt the phantom heat on his lips. Steve had kissed him and risked it all despite the possible fall out if Tony didn’t return Steve’s affections (which was stupid because Tony was a little head over heels about Steve). He had done that despite the firefight, patched him up, and gone as far to try to go for help without a second thought. Steve was worth everything, and yet Tony put him in danger just by being around him.
“What?” Grapevine wasn’t as strong as Tony thought if Pepper hadn’t heard about his little shit show down in the lobby.
Angry surged into Steve’s blood. His vision zoomed in on the figure as he pulled back the safety on the gun. He lifted the pistol with both hands and began firing at the figure. It didn’t matter that each bullet pinged off the metal casing. Steve wanted him dead. He wanted to pierce the heart of the man who used Tony before beating his body into a bloody pulp.
Tony cocked his head to the side. He knelt down and placed two fingers along the man’s still wrist. “Surprisingly, still alive,” he said. Tony looked almost impressed.
Tony hesitated before looking up at Steve. Something was off. It felt like Tony had put up a mask between them and it wrecked Steve to see Tony like that. “Yeah, well, when you’ve been in the white collar business as long as I have, you realize how easy it is to forget the difference between networking and abusing privileges. It’s all in the semantics.”
“What the- Steve, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just… Oh god. Please, whatever is happening, I didn’t mean it.” Tony pressed his hand against the scruff of Steve’s neck, but the werewolf shoved him off.
“Whiners don’t get red, white, and blue pancakes from Captain America,” Steve said, praying the bribe would get Tony’s mind off the very adult situation.
Without a moment of hesitation, Tony rushed over to the face down War Machine. “Hey,” said Tony, giving the helmet a light tap. “How you doing?”
Looking into Steve’s blue eyes, it dawned on Tony that Steve was more worried about his friends than petty revenge. Schmidt had numbers, Steve’s guys didn’t. No sign of gunfire, but that didn’t mean things would stay that way. And while Tony was also worried about his family, he was confident they could take care of themselves. Besides, he had more pressing concerns.
“Tony!” Steve called ahead, hoping that he hadn’t passed out. The blood stains on the ground and the stark white wall were the first thing he noticed. The second thing he noticed was that Tony was nowhere in sight.
“You will all suffer!” yelled Schmidt as he ducked for cover. “Germany will rise again! Cut off on head, two more shall take its place!” he called as he ran for safety.
From underneath the iconic red and gold metal helmet that encased his head, Iron Man, new money mob boss of the Iron Family, surveyed the situation.
“What the hell am I doing?” he murmured to himself. Steve wanted so bad to sink into the bench and forget everything. So much had happened within the past week, it wasn’t even funny anymore. Not that it was to begin with, but Steve was getting tired of having the weight of the world on his shoulders. The Iron Family was an unwelcomed surprise to the pecking order, as was finding out that legislation to permit prohibition was being discussed in congress. Contracts for their booze were being dropped left and right, and it was making Steve antsy. Steve wasn’t into politics, but Sam was. According to him and his sources in DC, they meant it this time. They had gone so far as proposing four different drafts and presenting it to the floor twice.
Sam pointed to the left. Specks of red decorated the floor like breadcrumbs. There were a few large drops of blood, but something had dragged through them like a paintbrush. Something large. Something heavy. Something Steve could punch.
The wolf didn’t respond. His attention was solely on Bucky as the white wolf paced back and forth over the upturned ground.
“What? No. No! Do not do that. Absolutely do not do that. Under no circumstance should you do that. Ever.”
“So,” said Tony, clearing his throat from the conversation he would rather not have. “I assume you have another reason to be here aside from questioning my sexuality.”
Tony tried to come up with an excuse, but Rhodey didn’t wait around for an answer. Kid in hand and Clint following closely behind, Rhodey stormed away to the register, leaving a very awkward silence between Steve and Tony.
It took Tony a few moments, but when he figured it out, it was like a series of lightbulbs went off in his brain. “Of course! Of course, it all makes so much sense. The circus fucked with your food. They put drugs in it so of course you wouldn’t trust anything I give you.”
“I'll take you on the run. I'll do all the work, all the heavy lifting, and then I'll take you home. You don't have to participate in any part of this, okay? I'll make sure you do nothing illegal. And if anybody asks any questions, I'll take all the blame.”
Tony bit down on his hand and tried not to cry out. The friction of the cloth against his cock burned the sensitive skin. Steve’s touch was muted by the fabric, but god it felt so good. Tony tried to stay still, but he wanted more. He needed more friction. Tony’s hips began buck up into the air, moving in time with Steve’s hand as he chased after the heat.
All Tony could do in the situation was nod in confirmation. “Take care of it.” The ‘be careful’, was implied.
After a few more bites, Tony swallowed. His face was ripe with disgust. He turned to Steve, begging for some sympathy. “Will you marry me now?”
“There won’t be anything to discuss unless we get this guy on a table stat!” Tony lashed out in rage. “Get your ass in gear and let’s get going!”
Tony glared at him in disbelief. Scrapes, you could deal with on your own. Bruises, you could deal with on your own. Sprains, you could deal with on your own. Potentially broken bones were not something you dealt with on your own. You went to a doctor, or some type of professional to deal with it for you. Steve wasn’t a professional. Tony tried to push a little more. Because that's what friends do, right? “You know, I know a doctor who can help out if you really need-”
With a low grunt, Tony pushed himself up off the ground. He was a little tipsy, but Tony had enough of his wits about him to know what he was doing when he turned the bottle over and poured the remaining drink over Steve’s headstone.
“So what?” Natasha asked with a shrug of her shoulders. “You gonna to scold me for going above and beyond your expectations?”
Steve let out a heavy sigh. “Sorry. I should have closed the window on the way in. I just got so excited about finally asking you out that I completely forgot all about it,” Steve said with an awkward laugh. “I knew the guys would try to eavesdrop. I just didn’t expect them to be so sloppy about it.”
A wave of heat and wind crashed over him. The force of the explosion knocked him off his feet and sent him tumbling once more into the ground. Debris riddled air howled in his ears with the strength of a tornado. Tiny shards of shrapnel bounced off his armor with an earsplitting
The side of Steve’s lips hooked up into a shy smile. He placed a warm hand on Tony’s glove and gave it an affectionate squeeze. “Promise.”
“Can we focus here?” Tony snapped at the voice on the other lines. It was becoming increasingly difficult not to rub his temples in frustration.
At first, nobody answered. Then, Tony heard the sharp sound of angry whispers. When the voices died down, a familiar blond woman rose up from behind the counter. Carol waved at Tony, and embarrassed smile on her face. Tony, scarlessly believing what he was seeing, waved back.
Expensive whisky glugged out the glass and soaked the ground. Rivers of amber liquid flowed back and forth across the headstone, washing off months of dirt and grime from between the crevices. The empty carving of Steve’s name filled with temporary spirits. Then his birth. Then his death. Once the grave and the ground were adequately soaked, Tony shook off the remaining drops and shoved the empty bottle back into his bag.
“Oh, you know, no more than our usual rescue,” Tony said with a tight smile. “Aside from the stubbornness and the anger management issues, he’s been an angel.”
Tony’s vision bled red. That bastard. There was no way in hell he would let this man’s grubby, Nazi fingers harm a single hair on Steve’s head.
“Oh no, I recognize it all right,” Sam said, grabbing the lid to cover up whatever was inside. “But I have no idea what it’s for.”
“Think of is as a welcoming present, Mr. Iron. A gift in hope that you will use our services again.” Phil said with a gentle smile. “And from the report I have on your character, you’re not the type to pin the blame where it doesn’t belong. That means a lot to us at SHIELD. We need more people like you in this town Mr. Iron. Welcome to New York City.” With that, he turned to head out the door.
"Exactly.” Steve moved so his body blocked Tony from the others. “Tony isn't used to this kind of thing. He'd be better off with someone else.”
As soon as the clacking of shoes disappeared, Rhodey shifted a critical eye to Tony. Tony tried to avoid it by rustling stuff around to create a busy façade, but Rhodey wasn’t buying it for one second. “One of ours?” asked Rhodey.
Pepper took a preparatory breath. This was not going to be good. “Overall it doesn’t look that bad. A few pieces here. A few pieces there. But Tony, this has been going on for years. And the records are horrendous. It took me all morning just to figure out where to begin.”
Happy Halloween everyone! Snow/ flurries have been spotted in my neck of the prefecture and it's not even November. Fan fucking tastict. Updating on my tablet, so excus any spelling errors.
Tony shrugged, distracting himself with an assortment of wires and switches. In a voice quiet enough that Steve almost missed it, Tony mumbled, “Didn’t want you making a big deal out of it or taking advantage of me.”
They being Rhodey and Clint. After the successful raid with War Machine the week prior, he had sent the pair to prepare a storefront together. The same storefront that Iron Man was standing in front of.
Turning on his side, Tony looked at the place where Steve had stood awestruck minutes, maybe hours before. “Shoulda seen his face, Pep,” he gushed quietly. “When he saw what I did, looked at me like I was the best damn thing in the world. And then when he figured it all out, god Pep. It crushed him, and it crushed me too.”
“Hey bratwurst! Do us all a favor and ship yourself back to Germany. I’m sure Hitler would love a new red faced lap dog,” the onlooker shouted with a laugh.
Tony coughed up the last of his air, filling his lungs with ocean water. His shoulders itched under the wetsuit as red and gold scales popped out from under his skin and dotted his dark flesh like freckles all the way down to his now very scaly waist.
“Listen friend,” Steve said in a voice that was all but friendly. “I don’t know where you’re from, but in Brooklyn, loving someone for who they are or who they aren’t ain’t no thing. We may be a bit queerer compared to you folks in the Lower Eastside, but in Brooklyn if it ain’t your business, we don’t pay it no mind. If you or yours has problems with queers, or variants, or niggers, I best suggest you turn us down now before vicious words are the least of our problems.”
“They are new,” Natasha confirmed. “And less likely to blow up in our faces when we open them,” Natasha added with a nod of approval.
Dammit! No! Those were not the type of thoughts he should be having. He had a company to run. A reputation to uphold. He could not out himself as a fag at this critical juncture. Admiring a man in a well-tailored suit was fine. Those thoughts in private were fine. But Tony was seconds away from pressing his lips against Steve's just so he could feel the soft, plump, solid weight against his as it reached out with a tantalizing shine and he wrapped himself around- Nope! Not gonna happen!
Steve skulked off the in the other direction. After showing them the weapons, Natasha had conveniently disappeared. But she couldn’t have gotten far, right?
The aggressive energy drained from Tony’s shoulders until all that was left was a mortified husk of a man. His lips formed the beginning of quick lies and excuses, but nothing came out. Giving up with a sigh, Tony ran a hand through his dirty hair and begged, “Can we just pretend you never heard me say that?”
“Horrible. I got kidnapped, throw in a room full of scientists with the creativity of a pigeon, and used as a guinea pig for one of AIM’s crazy experiments all in less than twenty-four hours,” said Tony, trying his best to look as distraught as possible. “Feel sorry for me, Steve. Why aren't you over here pampering me? I need kisses to make me feel better.”
“Well don’t get used to it,” Tony said, trying to act as if the request was something as boring as a milk run. “I’m only doing it this once”
“That’s Captain Rogers to you jackass,” snarled Steve. He charged at Tony full speed. Tony had no choice. He charged up the repulses, but Steve was fast. In the blink of an eye, he had a fist directed at Iron Man’s head.
“Boss,” Clint grunted, pushing aside a bullet riddled table and some rubble. “Next time you want to test us, give us a warming first. I think I might’a broke something.”
Steve knew Tony didn’t have a great childhood. He had held Tony through enough screaming nightmares to know their relationship wasn’t ideal. But the way younger Tony was crying, Steve never realized how bad it really was. He knew some of the facts. But being told about it from Tony’s removed, adult perspective was one thing. Seeing how younger Tony reacted to a very current problem was something else.
Chapter 4 and 5 need some minor edits, chapters 6-7 are in the major editing process, and chapter 8 is in draft form. Basically, your feedback can influence parts of the story. Just btw.
“I many not have your resources, but I certainly have connections. Connections money can’t buy.” Steve reeled his arm back as far as it could go.
As he stopped to catch his breath, small clouds of hot air fogging up his helmet, Tony heard a heavy set of footsteps come up behind him.
“The breadline? Really?” The surprise in her voice was genuine. But so were the frustrated mutters along the lines of, “I told him I could scout out the other territories myself.”
Steve closed his eyes and whipped his mouth with the least bloody part of his sleeve. He looked over his shoulder at Tony, expecting to see some sort of shock or horror at Steve’s barbaric display of anger. Instead, the look on Tony’s face was the antithesis of fear. He looked calm and relaxed, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.
“So, what do you think? Bet it’s not what you expected,” asked Tony, not minding his appearance of red suspenders hanging down from the top of his pants and sleeves rolled up just enough to give Steve a show that made the crotch of his pants feel a little snug.
Pages about how Steve’s biceps flexed as they pushed and pulled the dough until it was elastic and smooth to the touch. Long diatrads depicting the small beads of sweat that formed like a crown around his brow, glistening in the flickering light of the food truck. Paragraphs describing how his breath grew heavy and more labored with each push of the dough. Or detailed passages about how his eyes grew dark with intensity as he worked the soft mixture between his fingers.
“Dully noted,” Tony replied before shuffling around some projects with a free hand. He was going to get this figured out even if it killed him.
“Oh,” said Tony, the reality of the situation finally dawning on him. Not only was he not in trouble, but Steve liked him. Like, actually liked him the way Tony liked him.
Words. Steve could remember them; make them into a nice coherent sentence. “Still in shock that this is all you, but it’s nice,” said Steve, trying his hardest not to ogle Tony as his eyes darted around to everything but. He could salvage this conversation if it was the last thing he did. “The workshop, It’s very you. Can’t say I’m a fan of your wallpaper though.”
It took Tony a few seconds, but when he finally realized who the ear belonged to, it was like taking a bucket of cold water to the face.
The arc reactor wined down to a low squeal, leaving Tony a panting, gasping mess inside the metal armor.
Sam held up a hand to slow the conversation. “Wait, you’re actually going to go out looking for guns for us?”
“Barton is acting like a child,” Steve said, turning on the coffee machine. “Don’t worry yourself about it.”.
“Would I like to go to-” Tony’s cheeks burned like a furnace. He had only meant to rehabilitate this poor creature and- God, how was this his life?
I know this is heavy, real life stuff, but I feel like you guys should know. I want to finish this fic, but I need to acknowledge that if I haven't updated it in a year, I most likely won't finish it any time soon. I'll definitely try, but I feel I should keep you guys in the loop. Hope you've enjoyed the chapter and thanks for sticking with me for so long.
“Looks like Thor and Falcon are keeping them busy,” reported Bucky, joining Steve. “I also heard someone up on the catwalk making a lot of noise earlier.”
Steve licked his face. No tongue down his throat this time. Not that Tony would have minded. He wasn’t into that kind of kinky stuff, but the thought of Steve, human Steve, doing all sorts of things to him; licking the inside of his cheek, pressing his large human paws against his torso, Steve’s cold human nose nuzzling chest, his hips, his navel, and then his cock, it made something warm and feral curl in Tony’s stomach.
Iron Man punched the remains of the door open. Inside was worse than the outside. At least now the family had a slightly better excuse to renovate the place. The shoddy lights had been shot out completely and gray dust filtered through the rays of light from the bullet holes. Blood spatters decorated the once pristine walls. Moans of pain echoed down the brick walls making his heart race. Where were they? It shouldn’t be that hard to find two of his best people.
“Don’t do it kid. His taste in fashion is atrocious. He has enough plaid shirts to clothe an lesbian bar,” warned Tony.
Tony's brain was running a thousand miles a minute. Devilish thoughts and ideas cascaded around his brain as warm dark arousal pooled in his gut. It was a familiar song and dance for Tony. Entice a man with a broken radiator and the next thing you know, you want to bend a blond over backwards and fuck an artist (and be fucked by said artist) six ways to Sunday. Normally, Tony would distract himself from such sinful thoughts by reciting all prime numbers up to eight digits, but today was turning out to be harder than most.
So, Chapter 6 and & 7 will be on schedule. I'm going to try my best to keep my goals since I'm running into some motivation problems writing the story. Hope you're enjoying it so far! I'm working on the climax and it's getting harder to punch it out.
“Still, it feels like I’m losing a competition against myself. Like I should bring him back just to ask him where to begin. Grab him by the lapels and say, ‘Do I take Steve out to a fancy restaurant or a tiny hole in the wall? Is he allergic to anything? Does he like long walks on the beach? Ten-foot bunnies? Tell me, other Tony. Tell me!””
“That look!” Rhodey pointed to his face. “That stupid happy look like you’re a dog in front of a butcher shop drooling over the cold cuts.”
Steve looked down at the large, red stain on his shirt. Bucky’s blood. Bucky’s life plastered to his chest. Steve thought about how good it would look paired with a set of freshly bloodied knuckles. He clenched his fists, feeling the tense energy in his shoulders roll into his hands like choppy waves before a storm.
“No! Of course not. They’re the ones who dared me to come over here in the first place. I wouldn’t have said anything otherwise.” Steve turned his head to the side, trying to hide his embarrassment. “You… uh… you have a way of taking a guy’s breath away.”
Steve’s eyes snapped. There was no mistaking it. No way he misheard that memorable sound. Didn’t matter where he was or what he was doing, Steve would have recognized the voice immediately.
Tony smiled. He squeezed Steve’s hand and quietly led him out to the hall. He locked the door to the interrogation room behind them before leading Steve up a set of stairs hidden behind a wall of wine barrels. Tony turned the handle of a hidden door, revealing an luxurious office. The floor was line with an extravagantly designed yet tasteful tile. A variety of plush and wood chairs had been meticulously placed around a large red rug in the middle of the room. The exposed wood walls were a dark brown that matched the heavy, desk on the opposite side of the office.
“Shhh. It’s okay, Tony. I’ll take care of you, promise,” Steve murmured as he pressed one last kiss over the skin above the arc reactor. With a smile, Steve shimmied down the bed until his face was right next to the tent in the sheet where Tony’s cock hid.
Tony let out a heavy sigh. “Who knew coming back from the dead would involve so much paperwork,” he said, tossing a manila envelope onto the floor.
Steve closed his eyes and let out a heavy sigh. “I think, Buck’s injury bringing us together would make a weird start to a relationship. What if he has a turn for the worst? What if he doesn’t make it?”
‘AIM. The Ten Rings. Pain.’ The memory consumed his senses, but Tony didn’t pull away from the touch of fingers on skin.
Ms. Potts ignored his remark. “Dinner with Victor will is scheduled for 7:30 tonight, so please be down in the car by 6:00. You know how busy the streets get in the evening. And don’t forget that Obie will be stopping by in a few hours to check on you. If there’s anything you don’t want him to see, take it down or take him out to eat at someplace nice.”Tony snorted as if the prospect of going out to eat was on a list of impossibilities.  “On the Southern Front, meeting concluded right on schedule. Our new provider has agreed to the terms of our arrangement. I’ll draw up a contract and we should be expecting product within the next few weeks.”
Rhodey’s eyes suspiciously shifted to the side. “It made sense in the moment,” he mumbled in embarrassment. Yeah right. As if that wasn’t code for ‘I don’t approve of who you’re dating, so I’m going to give him a very
The next morning, same as before, Tony dragged a tray of meat out to the werewolf enclosure. The wolf had moved from the tree line toward the doggy door, but he still wasn’t comfortable enough sleeping in the open. Instead, he was sleeping under a large log within eyeshot of the doggy door. Unfortunately, the food from the prior day remained untouched.
“Don’t know,” said Steve, a playful smile on his lips. “It felt like the guy in gray was reading me my rights when we met up.”
“No. Absolutely not,” he said like this was the most certain he had been about anything in his entire life. “This… you… It’s fine.”
Tony swam around the iceberg, debating how many hints Iron Man could drop before the Avengers started getting suspicious. But as he circled around to the front, something changed. The water hadn’t turned warmer or colder. Something was just… wrong.
On the other side of the service window was Captain American flag himself. He stood at parade rest, shoulders back, clumps of blond hair stuck out from his head at awkward angles. The moment their eyes met, the man smiled. It was one of those small smiles that lifts up only one corner of the mouth. It made the captain’s deep blue eyes sparkle under his long lashes and Tony’s cold heart melted like spring snow.
“A guy? What kind of guy?” Steve’s body tensed up. Good guy? Bad guy? ‘All hands on deck’ alert kind of guy?
“See,” said Steve, placing a fork and knife down in front of Tony. “Adults can be wrong about some things. It’s important to remember that and think for yourself.”
Tony forced his legs to run as fast as possible through the heavy weight of the suit. But a punch in the kisser from stupid, fucking Rumlow sent his spiraling off course.
Hints of a smile tugged at the edges of his mouth. It didn’t make the doubt go, but it was something to have someone rooting for him. “You have a bet running in this?” he asked, a hint of humor in his voice.
“That’s because you’re not looking at the whole picture,” grumbled Tony, pushing the print in Rhodey’s hands against two other sheets of parchment paper, filling in the blanks and making the device perfectly safe. “Don’t you have any faith in me Rhodes? They’re modeled after mine, so you have nothing to worry about. Yours and Pep’s just happen to be a little more tricky because you don’t have a power source in your chest.”
Steve shouldn’t have been scared of a man. But what he saw come out of the dust was something new and terrifying. War Machine was encased in a large mass of metal, making the man look broader and stronger than ever before. The large metal hands attached to the steel torso looked like they could crush a man without breaking a sweat. A captivating blue light emanated from the centre of War Machine’s chest, radiating raw energy.
Tony frown. “Okay,” he said with a dejected sigh. He looked down at his pancakes and his mood went from bad to worse. “What? Strawberries? I hate strawberries. They look weird and they have too many seeds.”
“My assistant,’ replied Tony. “My paper pusher. My hands and legs when they aren’t available because I’m busy being a genius. My ‘get stuff done’ lady when I’m too busy otherwise.”
Steve looked up from his book and smiled. “You did? What did you make?” Steve asked as Morgan climbed up on the couch alongside him.
Steve went back into the beach house and came out a few minutes later with his sketchbook in hand and actual clothes on his body. He sat down on the chair alongside Tony and, as he had done so many times over the years, flipped the book open to an empty page, twirled the pencil around in his hand, and began to draw.
“First of all,” Tony said, because he had to set the record straight, “they’re not weights. They’re just empty boxes of oatmeal. Second, Steve stop smiling.”
“Wait,” said Red. Her inquisitive eyes gave Steve a once over. “You need to find a Tony. Describe him.”
Embedded in the wood was a single arrow. The purple shaft and feathers still wobbled from the impact, as if mocking him. Steve noticed a small bulge at the tip as well as a white note attached to the shaft.
He heard Steve test the shove’s blade against the palm of his hand. The dull thud of each hit reminded Tony exactly what would happen if Steve landed a blow on his neck.
“Couple hours ago,” Tony said with a smirk. “My place isnt as bad as your though.” He scooted closer to Steve to clean away the smudge.
Bruce turned around to face him, face warped in utter confusion as to how Tony got from point A to poing P. “Huh?”
The mouse of a gal stood up instinctively, hiding behind a small clipboard of paperwork. “But Mr. Stane told me to keep an eye out for you.”
“Don’t play dumb. It doesn’t suit you.” An amused smile flickered across Steve’s face. “You’re wondering what I think about when I draw you.”
He couldn’t have this sullied part of him paraded around like a prized cow. Not here. Not now. If his true colors were revealed the company would be taken away from him for good. Probably auctioned up at a ridiculously low price. His people would be out of a job, forced to hit the streets in horrid economic conditions. A high percentage would fall to suicide or the bottom of a bottle. That didn’t even take into account the plan.
“That is what you should expect if you betray me. There will be no second changes. No excuses of ‘I will do better next time.’ Work is hard to come by friends, and protection is even harder. You idiots are a dime a dozen, and don’t think I don’t have what it takes to throw your ass to the curb if you fail me. This is the only warning you will get. Do I make myself clear?” He inspected the line of fools, glaring each of them down into submission. Not a one of them moved to leave.
“What about second date or third date? You had plenty of chances and not once did you hint that there might be some life changing information that I need to know.”
“Nooooooo, you’re lying,” the kid whined. “Jarvis got me stickers of Cap’s shield as a reward and everything.”
“At this point, there is no other way,” he said, not bothering to hide sound of defeat in his voice.
“On it,” Bucky confirmed with a nod. Without hesitation, he hoped over the shoddy cover and ran towards the action.
The clattering of empty shells stopped. Rhodey leaned his head back as far as the suit could go. “Steve is the leader of the Brooklyn Boys,” he confessed with an exasperated sigh. “Figured it out when we met the guys who were gonna sell us the hooch. Knew we’d run into them again, but never expected it to be like this.”
Tony rolling his eyes. How he managed to land a possessive and yet adorable fiancé, Tony would never be able to figure out. “Only for you and only because you’re so adorable,” Tony said, turning to catch a quick kiss over his shoulder. “But there’s still a lot of work to be done before we let people outside the Avengers know. Need to talk to Pepper about an official announcement before the media catches on and the stocks rocket. Have to get paperwork looked over by lawyers and approved by the board.”
Iron Man scanned the new associates as they began to gather in the front around them. Many of them were worse for wear, but the majority looked like that would live with few or no scars. Their bandages were bloody and messy, but they were up and moving about. Rhodey and Clint had done a good enough patch job. Must have been a bad firefight if associates, not cold bodies, were first on the list. “Any clue who might have done this?”
“No thank you,” said Tony as he struggled to pull himself up on one of the bar stools. “Steve is going to make me pancakes.”
“Me neither, but I’m honestly not surprised,” grumbled Rhodey as War Machine retreated back to the end of the aisle for cover
“Yeah,” said Steve, his voice thick with emotions too complex to be limited to a single word. “A little bit.”
But what if Bruce couldn’t fix it? What if Tony had finally done enough damage that things couldn’t be fixed. Maybe it was too late. Maybe the damage done tonight as well as the damage from nights before had finally tipped the scale so out of his favor. Maybe he had passed the point of no return. All those hours, all that hard work trying to taking responsibility for his actions only for it to blow up in his face; Tony couldn’t stand the thought.
Stane shook his head in disbelief. “Go ahead and get settled in Tony. I’ll tell Ms. Summers when the board meeting is. They’ll want to meet you eventually.”
Tony smile disappeared. He didn’t expect that question, but he tried feign disinterest. “Is that the only thing that you guys talk about anymore?” he asked, hopping down from the table, trying to act nonchalant. “But because I’m in a good mood, I’ll answer your question. No, it’s not some doll. Why do you ask?”
Steve froze in his tracks. For a second, Tony reveled in Steve’s lack of works and the look of utter joy that spread across his face as what Tony offered sunk in. “Tony, you really don’t have to,” Steve stuttered, trying to graciously deny Tony’s gracious offer.
The plan was brilliant, and it was all thanks to Steve. Or, Steve's broken heater as was the case. It only took Tony a few hours to create the device before the plan was put into action. With a little help from Phil, God bless self-interest and capitalism, Clint was able to sneak into one of Hydra's better known hideouts under the guise of a heating repairman. Claiming to check on the local utilities for any broken parts, Clint had masterfully installed the device under Tony’s orders and gotten the hell out of dodge. By itself, it was perfectly safe, but the next time Hydra turned on the heat, the entire heating unit would burst into flames leaving a large burn mark on the wall that looked like the Iron Man Helmet. Guess the next time turned out to be sooner than later.
Pepper didn’t say anything. She just brushed his hair in silence and let him feel sad. She had known Tony long enough to know that words wouldn’t help him right now. Tony felt it was true and nothing she said would make him think otherwise.
Oh, so their relationship was like that, was it? If these were the guys taking SI weapons, it would make dishing out revenge all the more sweeter.
“Let’s get what we came for and get out of here,” he harshly whispered to his crew. Thor, Sam, and Bucky began packing up and putting lids back where they belonged, but they were too slow. He could see the shake in Sam’s hands as he clumsily dropped the wooden lid down with a defeating clatter. “Now!” hissed Steve.
“Don’t even start with me Barton. I know where you live,” Tony scolded playfully. He wasn’t in the mood for another talk about ‘the birds and the bees and other interesting things a duo could do’ anytime soon.
Which was fine. It didn’t bother him. Didn’t matter that his teammates thought Stark was a right bastard. They thought Iron Man was a hero, a team player, a good guy. So what if they didn’t know Iron Man and Tony Stark were the same person? Made it easier for him to keep his secrets. Keep his distance. Keep the world from knowing a creature like
Steve was special. He made Tony’s steps lighter and his heart sing whenever he was near and long after they had parted ways. Steve’s presence alone made every moment they spent together special and bright. Tony would be damned if he lost that. After Steve dropped him off (wherever that was) Tony planned to leave Steve in radio silence until the shit storm passed. In the grand scheme of things, better to lose him now and hope for forgiveness than to lose him forever in a power struggle and beg for his life as Steve’s life blood flowed down the river. Maybe, if they were lucky, they could pick up back up later. Obviously, Steve would be mad that Tony had left him in the dust. Maybe even livid, but Tony would slowly coax Steve to see his side of the story. How he was a martyr in all this white collar, mob boss mess, and Steve would come round.
To his displeasure, a brown haired bimbo with a pile of paperwork stood between him and the elevator. Her shoulder length hair looked familiar only in passing. What was her name again? Daisy? Ms. Johnson? Skye? Someone had called her that in a break room, right?
His eyes drifted to Tony, eyeing him up and down for any sign of distress. “You sure you’re okay? Any health problems? Bruce’s not sure of the details, but he said to be on the lookout for nausea or stuff like that.”
Tony’s face fell, the guilt flooding Steve’s conscious in a surge of blackwater. “Steve-” Tony’s voice was tired and raw as if this was the last thing he wanted to hear.
Rhodey glared at Tony. He walked up to Tony until their faces were only inches apart. “Don’t give me no lip, Tones,” he said in a curt voice. “It’s one thing for you guys to fight in private or on a mission. It’s something else to fight in front of a kid. You of all people should know that.”
“You mean kiss?” asked Tony with a completely straight face. “You and big me already argue all the time like mom and dad. All we have to do is kiss like Jarvis and Mrs. Jarvis and we’ll be married.”
“Oh, that’s easy. Because my husband is doing exactly that right as we speak,” Natasha said, gesturing to the top of the fence.
“That’s enough. You two need to settle down right now!” Steve boomed. “Bruce,” said Steve, trying to get them back on track. “Care to update us on our situation? Have you figured out a way to get this little guy back yet?” asked Steve, shifting Tony up and out of sight of his elder counterpart.
Steve looked up from his sketch book and smiled. He tried to say something, but his words were also a jumbled mess. “I…um… What I mean to say is… um….”
Steve’s ear twitched, but his blue eyes showed no sign of recognizing the man. He turned his attention to a nearby tree and resumed his inspection of the enclosure.
Tony nervously bit down on his lower lip. His eyes flickered over Steve’s shoulder to catch a glimpse at his older self, and then back to the ground. His feet were fidgeting a bit and there was a tiny sparkle of curiosity in his eyes, but he held onto Steve’s hand like a lifeline. “No,” he said.
With a name like War Machine, the local patrons and residents had paid particular attention to stay away from the “Under Construction” signs that hung from the window. Good thing too, considering there was a second hit on the same location just over a week later.
Tony laughed as he tried to push the monster of a man off him. “You’re human now, silly. Humans kiss. Remember how to kiss?”
“And I'm supposed to believe you just because he gave you his digits?” Bucky yelled from his position.
Steve immediately went into attack mode. “What? What is it?” he asked, his eyes darted around the room for anything dangerous.
“Then why the hell would you keep something like this from me?” asked Tony. To him, it didn’t make a lick of sense. He was the boss. The boss was supposed to know everything.
Steve nodded, hand over his mouth as he tried to will the beat red flush away. “Yeah. Yeah. Just need a minute to… um…”
“Hey!” Natasha banged on the open back door of the truck. “We got hungry boys out front. What’s the hold up?”
Steve’s heart skipped a beat. His cheeks flushed hot with embarrassment. Steve’s entire world lit up in a flash of possibilities and just as quickly went out.
Steve hummed. He took Tony’s fabric covered head in his mouth. His tongue swirled around Tony’s head. Then, he hollowed out his cheeks and sucked.
“So, no telling him too much about the future and touching or else the world implodes. Easy,” said Tony. Even a genius like him could remember something that simple. No touching. No talking about future tech. No filling him on how much their dad was an ass and he shouldn’t listen to a word he says. No words of encouragement. No bragging about his accomplishments and how Tony surpassed their father in every way.
There wasn’t much clear information about mafia politics on the street, but Steve could very well speculate from what was whispered in back alleys. Once Iron Man found out about Tony’s slip, fuck. Steve figured Tony’s life wouldn’t be on the line, he seemed like too valuable an asset to be disposed of by the usual means. But with the reputation Iron Man had, me might take Tony all the way to the brink of death before making the man plead for his life.
Happy pulled the van around with Bruce perched in the back. Bruce took one look at Bucky and his eyes grew to the size of saucers. “Tony, I can’t-”
"You got it boss," said Clint, almost skipping out of the room. Most likely, he was creating a shopping list of where to pick up necessary supplies.
Not that they really needed saving. All combined, Tony and the girls took out more than half of the enemy soldiers, but the sentiment was appreciated. After chasing away the enemy, the Howling Commandos helped the girls push the truck out of the mud and back onto the road. The girls took the opportunity to fawn over the very attractive men while Tony secluded himself off to make a quick batch of donuts to say thanks. The two groups exchanged stories about their adventures and then went on their merry way. Tony drove off thinking he’d never see the nice men again. At least he did until now
“Well whatever they did, it works great. We’ll be able to send out the first shipment in a few weeks.”
“Great. Let me wash my hands and then I’ll be right back,” he said, darting off to the washing station.
That’s when it hit him. ‘T. Stark’. Tony Stark. Good God, Mary, Joseph, and all the holy saints! Tony wasn’t just some run of the mill engineer. Tony was Tony ‘freakin’ Stark: son of the great Howard Stark and new head of Stark Industries, inventor extraordinaire, and one of the few companies trying to do some good in the wake of the crash.
“I don’t care about the business. We always have Malibu to support us if things go south. Besides, this isn’t about money. This is about revenge, pure and simple. We have an opportunity that not many other have. We can stop the weapons leak at the source. We can track down the bastards that order the hit on me, and we can end it before they try again. That's it. That's the mission. Stop the leak before someone else gets hurt. What we make is for the battlefield. Nowhere else. I don't know if you realize, but my name is on the line. And I'll be damned it I let someone ruin it while I stand by the sidelines twiddling my thumbs like some idiot.  We stop it here and now, and make damn sure that it doesn't happen again. Do I make myself clear?”
Tony huffed. He really didn’t want to leave without giving Steve a proper goodbye, but the slow growing wetness on his shoulder was becoming a good reason to go. “He’s going to expect me to be here when he comes back.”
When Steve started describing the devastating bombing, Tony’s vision narrowed and his breath slowed. The meaning behind the dirt and dust sprinkled across Steve’s frame had suddenly become important, and not a mere contouring aesthetic. All he could think was, ‘My weapons did that. My weapons hurt Steve’ as a pit of dark guilt began to swirl in his stomach. And although there was no sure way of know for sure where the weapon had come from, Tony had a gut feeling that it was definitely his company’s name sprayed on in white on the side of the explosion. Where else could folks get their hands on an explosive that could cause large scale damage? Molotov’s couldn’t bring a building down on someone, and Justin Hammer was incompetent enough that he couldn’t be credited for the destructive handiwork.
“What?” Tony laughed in angry hysterics. “It’s not like it’s going to make a difference! Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t be sending everyone home right this second!”
“I’m not surprised,” said Vision. “FRIDAY showed me the equations AIM used for the time machine. AIM’s process of pulling Tony into the present, it seemed as if one thing went wrong, the entire thing would collapse in on itself.”
Steve’s ears dropped. He looked at Tony with such big, sad eyes as if trying to say, “What’s wrong? What did I do wrong?”
“Well, seems like a good place to start,” Tony said, leaning closer to Steve until they were only inches apart. “Speaking of firsts, it sounds like he never took you out on a first date. How about it, champ? Up for popping your first date cherry with me?”
Rhodey pointed to a dark shadow behind Steve. Sure enough, the young boy was cowering behind Steve’s legs like a caged rat. He held onto the doll with both hands, pinning it to his chest like a cross to ward off evil.
“Is someone else in there?” asked the kid. He craned his head trying to get a look at what was hidden behind Steve’s legs. “Do I know them? Who is it? Is it me? Are you having a sleepover with me? No fair! I wanna have a sleepover with Steve.”
“If I sign it will you shut up and go away?” Tony abruptly interrupted her with a louder than needed suggestion.
The wolf attacked the bars; growling and spitting with the desperation of someone who hadn’t eaten in days.
Tony closed his eyes and clamped down on the urge to sigh dramatically. He really did. Tony loved Steve with all his heart. He’d put up with a lot of crazy stuff Steve did because he loved the man. But Steve didn’t need to know about that. His ego was already big enough.
“Less than a pint,” Tony said with a groan as he tried to push himself up. “I’ll be fine. Mostly in shock right now, so it looks worse than it really is. Bullet is stopping a lot of the blood from coming out, so bleeding to death is not how I’m going to go out.”
As quiet as possible, Tony hid in the shadows of some boxes labeled “Pym” as he tried to get a lay of the land.
"You heard me," said Steve trying not to be distracted by how familiar the voice rang. This was not the time or place to get caught up in fantasies. He pulled back on the safety. The familiar click brought back his focus. "What the hell do you think you’re doing on prancing around a place like this? You think you can just walk in and do whatever the hell you want?"
He’d seen it a dozen times before, but it didn’t make the emptiness in his chest hurt any less. Tony dragged himself over to the headstone and pressed his fingers to the beautifully carved name embedded in the rock. He traced his fingers along the swoop of the “S”, letting the edges press into the sensitive flesh.
"Thor, we need to speed up the processing of the prohibition. Talk to Jane and see what you can do to make things go faster."
Theirs was a little room in the back of a red brick warehouse. There was absolutely no circulation during the summer months, and the free hanging lights swung back and forth in the spring, summer, fall, and winter air that snaked through the cracks and openings in the poorly constructed windows. The boys had tried to make it their own adding posters, pictures, and miscellaneous souvenirs for various fights up in the wall, but Steve would freely admit the place was crap in quality and sad if you stayed more than the span of their weekly meetings (not they they met only that one time. It was just the one time a week that meetings were "official"). The lone light above the room highlighted the lack of furniture, easily making it feel vast and empty if it wasn't for the empty crates and pallets stacked in a disorganized manner along the walls.
“Settle down you two. Tony, hurry up and eat your pancakes,” Steve said, putting down a perfect cup of coffee in front of
He looked up. Golden fur dangled in front of his face as the werewolf stood over Tony like an alpha protecting his pups.
Steve grinned. He set the wooden tray down on an empty spot on the bed. “You’ve been working really hard this week. Thought I’d surprise you with a little something special. Do you like It?”
But it would never happen. At least, not as long as Tony worked for the army. It was impossible to pursue anything that went beyond a one-night stand. Or, at the very least, ill advised.
Steve whirled around, looking for clues. “Tony?” Steve yelled into the darkness. He couldn’t have gotten that far. Could he? Tony said he would stay put. Could he have gotten kidnapped? No signs of a struggle and there was a lack of a blood trail, but that didn’t mean anything if Tony had passed out. “Tony!” Steve began to panic.
Steve’s smile came out as forced. He looked in Tony’s eyes, looking for something, but for the love of God, Tony couldn’t figure out what. Steve’s face changed to that of one with resolve and pressed his lips against Tony’s. It’s too short, too much pressure forced onto one area, but feeling Steve’s plump pink lips against his own made Tony melt upon contact. “For the record, I like girls too, but I also like you,” he whispered, face already flushed to the max as they broke apart. “Be back soon.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony yawned, not able to stave off the fatigue for much longer. “I should sleep. Call this day a wash. Just… let me rest my eyes… for a few minutes. We can… talk about this more… in the morning…”
With his hands as shirt was as clean as he could get, Steve bent down and splashed a bit of water on his face. Steve let out a long sigh. Water ran off his face in large drops. He closed his eyes and allowed himself a moment to breathe.
There was another crunch of gravel. And another. The rapid crunching of stones under feet made it sounded like an army was forming right outside the thin metal door.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve detected movement from behind a dark mahogany bar. A man in an intimidating dark gray suit stood up from the bar stool, his movements toward the group were slow but deliberate. Why hadn’t Steve noticed him before? The darkness of the room shouldn’t have prevented him from seeing such a large figure nursing a drink at a bar. He needed to get better at spotting people in the shadows. With quick breaths and sharp eyes, Steve tried to evaluate the strange form.
“Terrible," muttered Tony, quickly shucking the cap to the empty seat by his side. "But if someone asks me to pick one good thing about this stink hole, it wouldn’t be too hard.”
“I’ll have a look around,” she said, crumpling up the paper in her delicate hands. “See if I can’t find anything your speed. Might be awhile, need to do a little digging in places I haven’t looked in on in a long time, but it should be worth the wait.”
The flames of anger began to burn in his stomach. Steve felt his breath catch as he grew desperate for the taste of revenge on his tongue. His fingers dug into the rich fabric of Tony’s suit with enough brute strength to rip the material to shreds. “Sam said not to kill anyone,” said Steve, his eyes still on the man.
“This way Mr. Rogers,” she said, ignoring him and coxing him over to the large door with a wave of her hand.
Bruce took an unsure breath, considering the possibilities. “I can certainly try. Don’t know if our guest is privy to information like that.”
“Yeah, rather not take that option if we have to,” Tony considered aloud. “What about arms Pep? What are we looking at?”
“I have her address here coincidentally. Would you like it?” she asked politely, as if she were offering him a glass of water instead of turning his world upside down.
“I’m sorry you had to spend so much money,” Steve said, referring to all the furniture Tony had purchased in order to soothe the manager’s anger.
“You’ve been behaving yourself and being a good boy for me after all,” Tony said thoughtfully, his fingers working steadily. Steve tried to shake his head, but it was so hard to concentrate on anything that wasn’t Tony and the things he was doing to him. He managed to toss his head back once, but the ears slapped against his cheeks, and the muzzle stretched and pulled, and it was disorienting enough that the tenuous hold on his self-control just slipped further. “I suppose a little treat is in order, don’t you think, Puppy?”
“Maybe not in so many words, but your actions were clear enough.” He gave him a flat smile. “Sure you don’t want any?” he asked, wiggling the bottle in the air.
“I’m pretty sure I owe you,” Tony said, and Steve felt a wash of relief. It wasn’t going to be bad after all.
“Yes, I have. I know what to expect. Mostly,” he added, because to be fair, no one knew what to expect, but whatever happened, he was going to save Tony, so that was all that really mattered.
“Nice,” Tony says as Steve gets out of orbit and realizes Tony must be doing patrols. They’re both too high-level for it to be exciting, but it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t really care what they do as long as they’re doing it together.
Stark twisted and turned, going faster and faster as he showed off, until Steve finally yelled, “You’re crazy!” the words forced out, but it was better than the yell that had wanted to escape, far better than giving vent to the emotions that had surged forward before Stark began his wild maneuvers.
“Tell me if it hurts too much,” Tony ordered, putting his hands on Steve’s bent arms, and he lowered his head.
"So what you're telling me is that you don't mind the commands, but that there's a time and a place for it?  And it's not when we're doing battle.
.  Not that Fury seemed to care about that, oh no.  Tony Stark was a loose cannon.  Tony Stark couldn’t keep a secret (
He lets them explore instead, making sure he doesn’t grip too tightly and never going directly between his Angel’s legs. Other than the wings, his Angel seems to be shaped similarly to Humans, so Tony assumes his sexual organs are located in the same place. Sure, Tony’s touching and tasting, but he’s not
“Lick,” he said, and Steve’s eyes went wide, but he did as Tony asked, his tongue flicking against his skin. “Again,” he ordered softly, and it was definitely a little wetter this time, saliva apparently pooling in Steve’s mouth, and he wondered if Steve was thinking about sucking it; if he was thinking about sucking other things.
“Thank you for taking care of me,” Tony said, a small smile on his face, and yet his expression was so, so tender. He leaned in and gave Steve a soft kiss at the corner of his mouth. “Goodni—”
It’s one of those questions that Steve has been dying to ask, but there’s no way to politely bring it into the conversation. Nice shader; oh, by the way, are you attracted to men? Yeah, not so much.
Did it matter though? Well, it would. Tony already knew he’d pick apart every second of this conversation later. Still. Steve had asked.
“Ah, is my little puppy getting too excited?” Tony asked, and Steve would’ve shriveled up in embarrassment … if he hadn’t noticed that Tony’s voice was lower than it’d been a moment ago, if the hand on Steve’s back hadn’t seemed heavier.
It was hard to pay attention to what Tony was saying when it felt so good, Tony’s touch sure but gentle. Steve hadn’t let himself think about it, about one more thing that he might never have again, but he’d missed this, the slight burn that just stoked his arousal further, the sensation of having Tony inside of him, stretching him out so he could take more.
He shivered, bringing his thumb to his mouth to relive the memory. Tony had rough hands, and Steve had liked them all the better because of it. He would’ve been happy to spend more time exploring them with his tongue and his mouth, and he wondered if Tony would want him to do that in the future again. If he’d demand Steve suck on them. If Tony would thrust them in and out of his mouth.
Tony’s voice whispered in his head again like a fading echo, and he could feel his cheeks burning, which was a ridiculous reaction to an endearment.
It made his upcoming punishment something to almost look forward to in a twisted way, because then at least, he could begin to make amends. He was going to do everything in his power to make sure Tony didn’t regret or reconsider his decision. He was going to be good, better than he’d ever been before, and he was going to show Tony how sorry he was, how much he valued—
But all Tony did was cup Steve’s face, his thumb stroking over his skin. It was devastatingly kind, and even knowing he shouldn’t, Steve couldn’t stop himself from nuzzling into it, from taking whatever touches he could in preparation for the ones he wouldn’t get in the days to come.
Or he tried to anyway, but the reality of Tony in his arms made him tremble, made him cling and memorize the feel of him safe and alive—
“Pepper’s making me. I have ‘responsibilities’ apparently,” Tony says, and Steve can hear the air quotes.
He tugs the sheet down in Steve’s lap, covering more of his thighs, which would be considered kind in most instances, except Steve almost jackknifes off the table as the material drags over his cock, which still hasn’t gotten the message that nothing else is going to happen and lets out a spurt of precome in doomed hope.
hide at this point, the robe barely even covering his shoulders with all the moving he’s been doing, the sheet against his stomach and under his cock. Steve is completely on display, and he feels exposed and defenseless and so turned on that he aches.
Dr. Stark hums thoughtfully, and Steve finds himself leaning forward, as if to chase his hands as they move away.
His fingers are already rubbing against Steve before he’s even finished talking, so Steve doesn’t get the chance to brace himself, letting a ridiculous squeak escape as what feels like a jolt of electricity shoots through him.
But while his head believed it, his heart didn’t, and he was finished and waiting by the elevator in record time, the need to check on Tony warring with the need to
“It was a plan to use helicarriers to monitor potential threats in order to keep them from becoming real ones. Nick said you—”
“It’s okay, Steve,” Dr. Stark says, understanding and so terribly kind. “We’ll make a note that increased sensitivity is one of your symptoms.”
Bucky’s safe with T’Challa, but Sam and Natasha are down the hall, and he knows if he knocked on either of their doors, they’d get up and keep him company. He also knows, however, that it won’t help. He won't fall asleep again for hours, if he manages to at all, and the nightmares just keep coming back. He hasn’t slept well in over a month. He’s so anxious about what he might see after he closes his eyes that he’s been going to bed later and later, and when he wakes up, he feels worse than ever, his body heavy and slow, his head aching.
Well, this is unexpected, he thinks, as Steve comes barreling into the room wearing skin-tight leather, and maybe it’s shock setting in, but the foremost thought in Tony’s mind is that he didn’t buy him that.
Steve nods and stares down at his lap, but he can’t help stealing one last glance out the corner of his eye at Dr. Stark as he’s reaching for the doorknob, since Steve’s not going to get another one for six months.
“Don’t, Steve,” he rasped, forcing himself to move, and he crashed down next to him, the agony in his back nothing in comparison to the one in his chest. “You don’t need to do this, Sweetheart.”
“Yes, it was,” Stark snapped, but his shoulders relaxed slightly. “It won’t happen again,” he said, turning toward him, and Steve didn’t know what to do with the promise in his eyes.
He’d intended to finish out his contract with Tony, but he’d thought they might do it long-distance at first, keeping their separate apartments but seeing each other on the weekends and gradually move towards living together again. That had changed as soon as he’d realized how hurt Tony still was about what had happened. He couldn’t ask Tony to have a long-distance relationship when that meant leaving Tony over and over again. It had to be all or nothing.
, maybe they hadn’t heard about Tony and Pepper’s breakup, or maybe they worried they’d get back together, but for whatever reason, they modified the spell so the only way to break it is for him to have sex instead.”
“You didn’t know Natasha and I were on a mission together?” he asked flatly. It’d been his third mission. Steve was much more comfortable with computers now, but the objective had required a level of expertise that he hadn’t achieved yet.
“I’m going to move the sheet out of the way now,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve wonders if it’s his imagination that Dr. Stark’s voice is raspier than it was a second ago, but he wants and he hopes …
“Yes,” Steve said, even though he wasn’t quite sure. There was something a little humiliating about sitting on Tony’s lap, nevermind that he was bigger or that Tony had to look up at him. He felt like he was on display, that Tony could see each and every one of his reactions, and embarrassingly, he felt his cock start to stir.
Steve says something else in his own language again, voice hushed and almost reverent, and then he nuzzles Tony’s cheek. “My soulmate.”
Steve sneaked a glance, and Tony looked … had Tony been that worn down a minute ago? Harsh lines bracketed his mouth, and his eyes were dark and flat. It made Steve dare to turn his head and hesitantly brush his lips against the edge of Tony’s palm, ready to jerk back if Tony didn’t want it.
He didn’t know if Fury had set up the whole thing in order to get Tony to react, or if he was just taking advantage of the situation—although it better be the second, because the thought of Fury arranging the exam on purpose had him wanting to pull up the plans for the last missiles he’d been designing before he’d gotten out of the weapons business—but either way, Fury had to be pleased with the results.
There’s a burst of light, so bright that it blinds Steve for an instant, and by the time Steve can see clearly again, Tony’s gone.
“You were perfect today,” Tony said, and it was only the truth. “Are you going to keep being perfect for me, Steve?” he asked as he lifted Steve’s chin with his fingers, his thumb brushing over Steve’s mouth.
It was over an hour after Tony had gone to his room that he finally came out, and Steve stood immediately, glad that he didn’t have to look at red on white anymore and wondering if Tony were going to eat first and what he would say—except all Tony said was, “Follow me.”
Steve lets out a embarrassingly eager noise when Tony climbs on top of him, but what does it matter when he abandoned his pride in regards to Tony a long time ago, and he wraps his legs around him, pulling him down so he can grind his cock against Tony’s thigh.
He finds himself wondering if Tony has always had that kind of body underneath his lab coat, and even as he acknowledges the absurdity of the question, he can’t stop thinking it. Yes, he started falling for Tony because of his kindness and personality and okay, his good looks, but how could Steve have not known? He feels almost cheated that he hasn’t been fantasizing about what (else) was under Tony’s clothes.
Because no matter how much he’d thought he didn’t like the guy, he couldn’t stand to see the despair on Steve’s face.
He nearly cries in relief when his Angel moves and shows signs of waking up. Thank the Deep, now Tony will finally have something else to concentrate on other than licking his way up and down his Angel’s body.
“Controller,” Steve mutters, and it’s not exactly a lie, even though he knows Tony’s assuming he’s having issues with his PlayStation controller, and not that the person doing the actual controlling is the one with the problems.
Let himself. As if Tony hadn’t actively gone out and looked for someone. To make the pain go away. To make the pain that much worse.
Steve was remarkably patient with him as he “washed” this particular body part, squeezing and kneading and just watching the way it exposed Steve so beautifully to him. Tony had every intention of making it up to him, of course, although . . . perhaps Steve wasn’t being quite so altruistic as he’d first thought, Tony realized, listening to Steve’s breath catch.
His hips tilted, the muscles in his thighs twitching as he sped up, his hand feeling heavier and heavier.
Tony’s lips twisted into a shadow of a smile. “Because I’ve always wanted to know, Steve,” he said, his voice hoarse and almost pained, and it struck Steve once again how much he just wanted Tony to be
Steve’s breath hitched, and he squeezed himself a little, his other hand starting to slowly rub up and down his thigh.
So he said, “I want to be good for you,” the words just as true, even if they didn’t express the full extent of his feelings.
Steve felt Tony move around on top of him and then a sharp tug on the strap around his bicep before it went loose and the material started to slide against his skin.
I am just so amazed by the response from you guys, and you really have no idea how much it means to me. Seriously, I just floated around for days, all swoony with feelings. Thank you.
Tony didn’t try to take his hand again as they stood in the elevator, but it almost seemed as if he wanted to, standing closer to Steve than the small space warranted. Tony opened his mouth a couple of times as if he were going to say something, but he never did, too careful and considerate to upset Steve, and Steve …
Should he kiss him? Would Tony want him to kiss him? Two kisses didn’t automatically assume permission for more. Did they?
Steve’s mind reeled with the idea of going outside as a puppy, naked but for the gear that Tony had chosen for him. It didn’t matter that Tony had said he owned the surrounding 100 acres of land. How was Steve supposed to do that?
. The person who’d reminded him to say “please” and “thank you,” had taught him the difference between right and wrong, and had shown by example how to be more human than a large percentage of the people on the planet. And she was coming to Wayne Manor.
part, and Steve doesn’t mean to get preoccupied by the idea of Dr. Stark shoving things inside of him, but come on, and the next thing he knows, Dr. Stark is setting up something over Steve’s torso, effectively cutting off his view of anything going on between his legs.
Steve followed Tony to the kitchen and watched as he lifted the lid of a bubbling pot and stirred the contents. They smelled amazing.
“Oh, definitely more.  I mean, less,” Tony said quickly.  “So much less.  Obviously.  Live a little, Steve!  You’ll like it; I promise.  I can
And so it had begun.  As the years went by, he’d gone from dreading their encounters to tolerating them to eagerly anticipating each and every meeting, pacing in front of the Bifrost and counting the minutes until his father arrived to accompany him, as was agreed.
“It’s like you’re trying to give me a crick in my neck,” Tony complained. “Sit down,” he said, and when Steve turned towards the other chair, Tony clarified, “On my lap.”
Tony looked happy, he thought wistfully, taking in the broad smile, the flamboyant spread of his arms. He was wearing a tuxedo, if the bowtie was anything to go by, and Steve wished he were closer so he could see details.
“I’m okay,” he rasped belatedly, and it wasn’t a lie, because he would be; he’d make himself be. “Please don’t feel like we have to go back up for me. I wa—” He bit back the word, unwilling to say it. “I’d like to. Eat down here. If you’re still interested.”
“Okay, Tony,” he said finally, his shoulders lowering slightly, not far, but enough for Tony to pull himself up to his feet, although he had to lock his knees to keep standing. He made himself take even breaths, counting slowly to try and calm his racing heart.
Also, I'm not saying there's a correlation with getting a lot of comments and updating faster, but...
“Tony,” Steve said, just his name, but Tony finally fell silent at the impatience in Steve’s voice, even though Steve hadn’t meant to reveal anything at all.
, is the next question, but on second thought, it makes him sound a little crazy, and obviously that’s not such a huge issue right now considering he just dived at Steve’s door while yelling at JARVIS, but there’s no reason to give him even more fodder.
Steve shook his head, walking in until he was a few feet away, and Tony had been around the military enough to recognize a parade rest when he saw one. He had just a second to wonder what Steve was going to say, dread making him twitchy, when Steve spoke.
He didn’t think of anything beyond what he had to do, getting a mug, pressing the appropriate buttons, wiping down the machine to make sure there weren’t any drips, grabbing a napkin …
“Tie this around your waist,” Tony whispers, handing Steve his shirt, and then he heads to the counter, presumably to get more napkins, while Steve tries to put himself together.
Also, guys, this is now my most kudos'd fic! \\\o/// *does happy dances all over the place, humping everything*
He settled back on his legs. His hands weren’t quite steady as he grabbed the denim, and they were strangely slow, moving the material at a glacial pace. He watched as first dark grey cotton boxer-briefs were revealed—the undershirt just covering the juncture of Tony’s legs—then toned thighs with their sprinkling of hair, knobby knees, and finally, he got the barest glimpse of Tony’s shins and calves as the jeans fell completely to the floor.
Steve swallowed, the floor rocking underneath him, and he couldn’t talk. For the life of him, he couldn’t seem to get even one word out of his mouth.
He broke off when Steve’s face flushed even harder, which, man, he hadn’t known a person could turn that shade of magenta.
Stark let out a huff of air, slapping his hands on his thigh like he’d come to some sort of decision, and stood up. “I’ve got a few phone calls to make. I’ll be back in a bit.”
And when Tony had fingered him . . . Steve didn’t remember it ever feeling like that before. He didn’t usually do it to himself when he masturbated, because it was a lot of effort for something that was over with fairly quickly, but if it had felt like
Steve froze when Tony started to move, the tears flowing even faster, sure that Tony was going to pull away at long last. But Tony just turned slightly instead, sitting on the floor and resting his side against the couch, his eyes closing for a second and his breath coming out slowly before he gently began guiding Steve toward him, arranging him so Steve’s back was to the couch and he could burrow against Tony’s chest.
It wasn’t the first time he’d made that decision. And maybe it was foolish of him, maybe it set him up to fall that much further later on, but …
He knew, though, that just because Tony had told him eight, it was no guarantee that he’d actually call for him then, knew that more than likely, Tony would make him wait, just like he had yesterday. What else was he supposed to do, though?
He was so lost in his thoughts that when Tony finally said, “Take off your clothes,” Steve’s head jerked up, and he forgot all about keeping his eyes down.
He was so preoccupied that he didn’t pay attention to what Tony was doing until Tony was stepping closer to him and running hands through his hair.
“Hmm, what’s that?” Tony asked as he pulled his shirt up over his head. “You want to use both hands? Be my guest,” he said, walking over a few steps to one of the strategically located bottles of lube. He tossed it to Steve, who caught it easily.
“Please,” Steve said, placing both hands on Tony’s thighs and leaning in close. He hesitated only a moment before rubbing his cheek once against Tony’s and keeping it there as he whispered into his ear, “Please.”
Tony jerks out the tentacle from Steve’s cock, the ones on his nipples accidentally yanking themselves off in reaction as well, and Steve groans like he’s dying, convulsing in Tony’s arms again and again, warm fluid streaming over the end of Tony’s tentacle in a rush and white feathers filling his vision. It catapults him into his own orgasm, and he pushes both his hectocotyli in as far as they can go until he hits resistance, eliciting a high-pitched shout from Steve that makes Tony shake as he comes deep inside of him, the pleasure so all-consuming that his vision goes hazy and he loses sensation in his tentacles, the weight of Steve in his arms the only thing keeping him anchored to himself.
Tony was tempted to fuck him with the vibrator, popping the knot in and out of him until Steve came all over himself and floor, but he decided to save that for later.
They sat on the couch in silence for a long time, until some of the lines bracketing Steve’s mouth had finally smoothed out and Tony was confident that the worst of it had passed for Steve.
“That’s … that’s never happened to me before,” he somehow manages to say, and he has the crazy urge to cover his chest protectively. The nipple Dr. Stark had touched is still tingling.
“H-hi,” he croaks, and it’s a wonder he manages to get anything out, and in English, no less, because it’s much more likely his Angel knows that than Atlantean. “You were—”
“I said that I love you,” Steve told him, and it was just as impossible this time around as it had been the first time. “And I know you probably don’t believe me and that I—”
“What can I say? I’m just lucky, I guess,” Tony said, but there’s a twist to his lips that made Steve look away.
He doesn’t, because it’s already a tight, tight squeeze inside of Steve, and he doesn’t want to hurt him, but maybe after Steve’s gotten used to taking more of him …
Kissing Steve feels right in a way he can’t explain, like it’s more important than talking or breathing, like he’ll never need anything else as long as he has this. He thinks he could be satisfied with just kissing him for hours on end.
He frequently found himself up at all hours of the night, and he took to running to make the time pass faster, finding the heavy thud of his feet on pavement thankfully mind-numbing. He probably should’ve tried to sleep more than he did, but it made him jittery to lie there with only his thoughts to keep him company, and he always ended up giving up sooner rather than later.
He likes to go around demanding affection from all the Avengers, winding between his chosen victim’s feet, tripping them if necessary and even nipping at their ankles until they pick him up and start petting him.  Then he purrs loudly and smugly, flexing his claws in warning if they seem like they’re getting ready to stop giving him the attention he deserves.
Still, it was a relief that Steve seemed more adventurous than that. Just how much more was yet to be seen. He couldn’t imagine Steve as being too hardcore, but stranger things had happened. Whatever Steve wanted to try, though, Tony was more than willing to do—there wasn’t much that fazed him, even if he didn’t get off on all of it. What he did get off on was turning his partner into a mess of sensation, and no matter what Steve eventually asked for, he’d do, because better it be him than someone who wouldn’t have Steve’s best interests at heart, who wouldn’t take care of him half as well.
“There wouldn’t be anything to fix if I hadn’t—” Steve’s other hand came to curl around Tony’s, joining the first. Tony hadn’t noticed the quiver running through Steve until then, but it was obvious as Steve held onto him. “I’m so
“Swallow,” Tony said just as he started to come, as if Steve had considered doing anything else, and his throat worked as he swallowed again and again. “Good,” Tony gasped, “You’re so good,” and Steve couldn’t explain why that made more tears well up, but it did, and he held onto Tony all the tighter because of it.
That quickly changed to fear, however, when he looked up from the slide of Bruce’s tongue to see Bruce staring at him with eyes that saw way too much.
“Damn it.” That’s the last time he tries to fiddle with machinery while he’s driving. He means it this time.
“Steve,” Tony said, shaking his head. “Steve, Steve, Steve. This isn’t for me. Well, okay, it is. But it’s mostly for you. Are you telling me you don’t want me to put you on your knees? You don’t want me force your mouth down on my cock?” he asked, his voice getting quieter and more serious with every word. “Don’t want me to choke you a little bit, until you can’t breathe and you’ve got tears dripping down your face? Because I’ve watched you,” he said, his hand moving from Steve’s nipple to his throat. Steve swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing under Tony’s palm. “And I think you’d feel cheated if I didn’t do that to you.”
“That’s because I am a genius,” Tony said and tugged Steve down for a quick kiss.  “Now about my Christmas present . . .”
“Do you want to go ahead and set up your next appointment, Steve?” she asks, and he opens his mouth to automatically agree—
,” he said and couldn’t stop the hope that rose up. It was the first hint that Tony might actually agree with him, even if he had been willing to let the last several days go and forgive Steve anyway. Maybe Steve asking for punishment had been a step towards restoring Tony’s faith in him. “Anything you want.”
He understands now why he’s clamping down on Dr. Stark, why even this much is wrecking him. It’s just one more way his body is trying to reel Dr. Stark in, showing him just how good Steve would feel, how satisfying it’d be to break Steve open on his cock. The thought makes Steve bite down on the blanket, letting out a muffled whine of excitement and pain as Dr. Stark thrusts into him a few times, undoubtedly trying to loosen him up and get him ready for more.
He hesitated for a second before replying, “Tony,” and slapped his hand into Steve’s, giving it a quick shake.  Tony’s fingers spasmed in Steve’s grip for no good reason, and Tony jerked back, curling his hand into a fist that he hid beneath the counter.
His old life had been taken from him, and while Steve could rail and rage at that fact, there was no one left to blame. With Tony, however, all the fault was his own, and it ate at him, all the things he’d given up, and never seemed to stop.
“Look, I do feel a little bad about all of this. You probably would’ve met your own Tony one day and been really happy together, if I hadn’t come along. I can’t give him back to you, but I did leave you a bank account with a tidy nest egg—”
It made Tony glad that he’d already gotten his orgasm out of the way, because it left him clear headed enough to be able to explore as much as he wanted. Not to say he was unaffected by Steve’s nakedness and proximity, by Steve’s reactions to his touch and the thoughts of what he’d like to do to the him. But who knew how much time he’d have left with Steve now that they’d started to have sex, how long he’d get before Steve decided he’d had enough and wanted to move on? So Tony had to memorize the feel of smooth, heated skin over shifting muscle as he washed him while he still could, the sounds Steve made and the sight of the soap running in trickles down his back. The clock had started ticking down, and Tony needed to hoard every second to his chest to dwell over later when Steve was gone.
It’s cold and strange, not quite uncomfortable but far from pleasant, and it causes Steve’s hips to lift up and elicits a shuddery moan that makes him want to die a little bit and shove further down a whole lot more.
He hadn’t been surprised when all the physical tests had come back and confirmed the body in front of them had Tony’s DNA with the appropriate shrapnel scarring and the corresponding signs of surgery. Of course it was going to be physically identical. Tony had lived a very public life, and whoever had sent it wouldn’t have bothered if they couldn’t get that much right.
to be down here, Steve.” The thought of what Steve had put himself through made the tears threaten all over again. “I didn’t ask you to do this, I don’t need or
He’s exhausted by the time he gets home, and he doesn’t call out to Tony to let him know he’s back like he normally would. He’s not angry, has no reason to
“Yeah, although apparently, it took almost six years before I was able to open my eyes,” Tony said, and he looked exhausted but much more relaxed now that he wasn’t locked up anymore. He was still required to stay on SHIELD grounds, but there were no cameras in his temporary apartment that Steve was aware of, and even if there were, Steve was sure there wouldn’t be by the time Tony went to bed.
something to make Tony see, and together, they could find a solution. Steve had to believe that. “I’ll let you know.”
Just as he’d thought, Tony’s outside with his flowers a scant few minutes later. Gabriella’s waiting after all, and he would hate to disappoint. Still, he makes a note of Red, White, and Blue Flowers in his phone. He might just be in this neck of the woods and need to drop in again sometime.
The absence of sound was almost as loud as the music itself had been, but Tony didn’t seem to notice, so absorbed in what he was doing that Steve assumed it’d all become background noise for him.
Tony’s not naïve enough to think Steve feels the same way.  He's exchanging money for a service when all is said and done, and while he likes to think that Steve’s enjoyed himself during their time together—actually Tony
The thing was that the more Steve thought about it, he couldn’t imagine that slow and careful was going to be enough. He had to do something that made sure Tony couldn’t tear his eyes away.
He’d never really thought about that before, the threat of someone pressing down, the possibility. What if Tony had tried to choke him?
to do anything.” Tony’s jaw clenched as he glared at the monitor, the only thing keeping him from exploding the knowledge that for all of his anger at Fury, Tony was the one who should’ve stopped things before they got out of hand. “Is this how all military Subs are treated?”
Steve hadn’t known just how hungry he was until he started eating. Everything tasted amazing, and Tony seemed intent on feeding him, nudging plates closer to him and smiling every time Steve took another serving of something. It was tempting to eat everything in sight, especially with Tony keeping up a steady stream of chatter between his own bites, stories that didn’t require more than the occasional acknowledgment on Steve’s part. He knew, however, that if he ate too much, he wouldn’t be in the mood for sex, and there was no way he was going to let that happen. So he controlled himself, eating enough for two men instead of three, and by the time he put down his fork, he didn’t feel too full.
Tony did finally end up sleeping when they were an hour into the flight, slumping down in his chair even though he’d told Steve the seats reclined to a completely horizontal position.  Steve tried to focus on the book he’d brought, but it wasn’t long before he was turning his seat toward him and watching, taking it all in.
So even though he hadn’t wanted to spar with Stark either, he’d done it, had decided he could put up with that and more for the possibility of real freedom. And if he thought about Stark’s insistence that they train together before going into the field as common sense instead of one of his rules, then it made it that much more bearable.
There's a buzzing in his ears, and he doesn't really process what Dr. Stark is saying, doesn't even react when he touches his thigh and moves upward, too focused on what he knows is in Dr. Stark's hand. He can’t actually see it, but considering how excited he is from the anticipation alone, that’s probably a good thing.
“It’s your excuse for not calling me, but it’s not important? JARVIS, what’s Project Insight?” Tony asked, staring him down, and Steve didn’t know how much JARVIS would find out since it’d never been mentioned in the news, but considering how easily Tony had hacked SHIELD’s servers before, he’d bet he didn’t have much time.
“What happened?” Steve asked at last when the tremors had quieted and he couldn’t justify allowing himself to take comfort in Tony’s embrace any longer.
Steve was tempted to ask about what “things” he needed to get ready, but that would have to wait until later. Tony had been teasing him this whole time about owing him, and he still didn’t know what he was referring to.
At SHIELD, it’d been incredibly frustrating to encounter website after website that was blocked to his access as he attempted to understand more about the world he was now a part of. That didn’t seem to be an issue at Stark’s, although Steve had apparently traded that greater freedom for even more supervision.
One thing had led to another, and here they are, a year later and living together, and Steve’s been so happy, happier than he’d ever thought possible until—
“Okay, but this doesn’t change anything,” Steve says, and it’s the last attempt of a drowning man to swim in shark-infested waters.
“Oh hey, is that for me?” Tony asked, grabbing one of the sandwiches off the plate on the counter. Maybe he should’ve waited for confirmation from Steve, but he wouldn’t have waited before all of this had happened, and he wanted to get back to where they’d been before everything had all gone so horribly wrong yesterday.
“I knew I shouldn’t have let you drive yourself this morning,” Happy said, shaking his head.  “This is what happens when I leave you alone.”
It’s justification and permission both, and as Dr. Stark does something particularly cruel with his fingers, Steve groans through gritted teeth and starts to come again. He sounds like he’s being tortured, and it almost feels like he is, the pleasure so severe that Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he damages the leather of the exam bed from how tightly he’s holding on. It’s all he can do not to thrash around, and he’s not completely successful, his hips shuddering against the onslaught of Dr. Stark’s fingers, but the fact that he doesn’t fall off is an accomplishment all on its own.
It should’ve been enough for him, having Tony depend on him, getting all those little bits and pieces of Tony that no one else ever got to see.  And in many ways it was, because Steve valued their friendship so much, he would never have done anything to jeopardize it.
He’s always been impressed by the employees they send over.  Attractive obviously, but that’s the least of their qualifications.  They’re well-read, knowledgeable on politics, philosophy, pop-culture, fluid dynamics, whatever he could want, he’s never been disappointed, and that’s saying something considering Tony can be a demanding son of a bitch, or so he’s been told.
“I already packed everything of yours,” Tony said, pulling out his phone from his pocket, and while he didn’t do anything with it, Steve realized his mind was already somewhere else.
and process what Steve was saying instead of just reacting, he had to put space between the two of them.
“Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?” he asked Tony, his voice still clear by strength of will alone. Steve wanted him to stop, to turn around, to think of another way, even though they all knew there wasn’t one.
After a while, Dr. Stark’s hands move from his nipples to his chest and back, again and again, and Steve is going to go crazy. His nipples are already more sensitive than normal, so it almost hurts when Dr. Stark touches them, a sharp burst of sensation that sweetens and expands until Dr. Stark lets go to massage him again, but even that feels better than it had before, Dr. Stark’s fingers pressing into the muscle, lifting his breasts almost like an offering while his nipples pulse with remembered pleasure.
different, he decides when he’s bare in front of Dr. Stark, the only things preserving his modesty a thin sheet and a pair of socks. He doesn’t normally have an erection when he’s in public, for instance.
Although if he were thinking about all the things Tony deserved, being addressed by his first name was actually very low on the list.
Tony watched as earlier-him noticed the two occasions Pepper had mentioned and responded accordingly.
“Of-of course not. I—” He faltered as Tony moved so he could rest his hand on Steve’s leg, and Steve didn’t mean to flinch at the contact, but he did.
He jabs harder at one of the wings, a mass of sodden feathers that take up way too much room, and they twitch in response, albeit weakly.
Tony hummed thoughtfully, his fingers gently massaging the back of Steve’s shoulders. “Out of curiosity—and I ask this purely in the name of science, you understand—how frequently
?  Maybe I like the ten dollar ones we had to buy when your neighbor across the street nearly had a heart attack seeing us making breakfast naked!  Maybe I like having those reminders of our—”
He spent a few minutes reveling in the storm when he came back out, so it took him a while to realize the wind had blown his book to the ground.
“A lot like who?” he demands, and he feels sick at the thought that Tony might’ve fallen in love with him because he reminds Tony of someone else.
“It’s been a really long day, though, and I’m beat,” he said after winding down his story, trying to make voice low and soothing. “Do you mind if I turn in?”
He’d always known Steve was more than just his wholesome exterior, but he hadn’t known how much more, doubted Steve really knew the answer to that question either since it wasn’t as if he’d had a chance to explore much, what with the war and everything that had happened after. But even if Steve had fallen on the lighter end of the scale, had been the type of Sub to only want a slap and a tickle, some light bondage maybe, and alright, a hint of choking, Tony would’ve been alright. Sexual compatibility was important, but having Steve—no matter how short the time—was everything.
He tried to compartmentalize his thoughts. There was so much to take in, so many things he should ask about Loki and the Tesseract.
“Thank you,” he says sincerely, and relaxes just a little, because it’s out of his hands now. He can’t get to Steve, can’t ruin their friendship by letting his knot take over his brain and make a pass where it’s not wanted. He’s safe.
He’d wanted Steve for so long, had loved Steve for so long, and the idea he’d somehow managed to convince him to love him back …
He was mostly hard by the time he was finished, an instinctive response to being naked in Tony’s presence, which would’ve been fine before, good even, but which was just humiliating now when Tony was so angry with him, his body not realizing its shame.
“Whatever you want,” Steve gasped, leaning against the table for support and making himself that much more vulnerable to Tony in the process.
“Not—” Steve had never been the type to back down from a fight, even when obviously outmatched, but he felt as if Tony was steamrolling over him, and he couldn’t defend himself, couldn’t do anything but take each blow as it came. It was the guilt. It was knowing that he’d doubted Tony and had acted as judge and jury without giving Tony even a chance to explain that made it so hard to talk. He
“You look amazing like this,” Tony said, his hand caressing over Steve’s enlarged belly, and Steve twitched, sucking in a breath as his muscles tensed involuntarily.  He couldn’t stop the groan that escaped as the pressure seemed to increase tenfold.
The flare of heat in Steve’s eyes told him he was, and Tony was going to have to think about ways to test if Steve had an oral fixation while he was gone.
“Okay, now where were we?” He comes up to Steve and pulls out a little flashlight from the pocket of his lab coat. “Say ‘ah,’ please.”
And now he couldn’t help but wonder, what if there had been other times Steve had wanted to stop, but Tony just hadn’t noticed?
“I’d like to examine you. I realize we’re not in my office, but we could use your bed as an exam table, and I’ll perform a few tests, some of which might be a bit intrusive but nothing worse than what I’ve done to you before—”
It’s only when Steve begins tensing like a spring, his wings fluttering wildly against the water, that Tony starts lashing his hectocotyli as well as thrusting them, something one of his Human partners had told him felt like a vibrator on steroids.
Steve blinked, looking from the rigid line of Stark’s shoulders to the affronted face of Dr. Reynolds. Stark wasn’t exactly blocking him, being smaller and shorter than Steve, but . . .
He explained the whole situation, from the request for a meeting to the bait-and-switch, and finally said, “It’s
Fuck, he didn’t want to deal with this right now. “Even if it means I decide to whip you?” he asked, closing the distance between them. “Or make you stand in the corner wearing nothing but your birthday suit until you fall down? Or dress you up in something pink and frilly and take all kinds of pictures of you?”
“I understand why he didn’t, and what matters is that I’m here now, right?” Tony said, and the look Peter gives him said louder than any words how much Peter had missed him.
He knew that Steve wanted him to fuck him. He didn’t think Steve realized just how obvious he was about it, even if he didn’t come out and say the words directly, and in the overall scheme of things, it didn’t mean a lot—while simultaneously meaning everything.
Dr. Edwards had explained that because of the placement of the uterus, omega males’ prostates tended to be higher in the body relative to alpha or beta males’. That meant a knot wouldn’t constantly press against it, but it also meant it was more difficult for doctors to examine them digitally. Dr. Edwards complained about needing longer fingers a couple of times, and Dr. Stark—
“I love you, and I’m sorry I ever gave you reason to think I didn’t,” Steve said, the words tumbling together and sounding like he’d dragged them across sandpaper, “but I do. I do love you, and I should’ve said my safeword, but it wasn’t better that it happened with you, because I
Tony moved to the large floor-to-ceiling windows, keeping his back to him, and Steve had to bite his lip to keep from saying anything else. He was acutely aware that he was still holding his shield and duffel in his right hand, having never set them down, and that it’d take one trip to get all his things downstairs if Tony refused. And then that would be it. All traces of his stay would be gone from Stark Tower.
More than anything, he realized, it was the idea of Tony purposefully keeping the truth from him that had Steve wondering how they were supposed to go forward—even while the thought of leaving Tony made it feel like something was trying to eat its way out of his chest. What kind of relationship could they have, though, if Tony kept something like this from him?
“Then I don’t mind at all,” Tony said, and Steve nodded, slowly sliding to the floor, watching Tony’s face to make sure he really was okay with it. He put his knees as close to Tony’s feet as he could, wanting to feel the warmth of his body if nothing else.
.  He once spent the whole time he’d reserved having Steve try on one outfit after another—with Tony in the room the whole time, he’s not stupid—and they’d never even gotten to the sex.
He moaned, unable to contain the pain at the thought that Tony would be gone by the time Steve was dragged out of the ice again.
for betaing this. I was really worried about this chapter (all these damn chapters omg), so I really appreciated the help so, sooooo much.
“They are, yes,” Steve said, and it was nice to have a chance to talk about it with someone, even if Clint had never been on his list of confidants before. He still didn’t have a therapist in New York, though, and while he went back to DC when he could to visit Peggy, it wasn’t regularly enough to see Dr. Saunders. He’d discussed Tony a little with Peggy, enough to know she approved, but he hadn’t felt comfortable talking to his former lover about his current lover, and Natasha typically had longer missions than he did, so their schedules didn’t match up frequently. Other than the two of them, the last person he’d talked about dating to had been Bucky—
What he’d failed to consider, however, was that he had a Dom now, and that meant that if he had an appointment, then Stark had an appointment too.
was okay,” and Steve writhed inside, could only imagine how humiliating that must have been for a Dom, how desperate Tony must have felt to do it, “and still, nothing from you. And then you show up on my doorstep without so much as a text! You say you don’t want to leave, but you’ve made it more than clear how you really feel, so yes, I’m easing the way for you. Here are your things. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”
