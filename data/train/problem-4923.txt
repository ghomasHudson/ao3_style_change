Cas felt his face flush at his failed, and frankly embarrassing, attempt to get on his boss's good side. Without a word he fell into his chair, putting his head in his hands. It was just a minor screw up, and how was he supposed to know anyway? He was just doing what he had done every other day this week, there is no way Mr. Winchester could be angry at him. Right?
"So," Dean began between bites, "Why do you stick with this whole secretary gig instead of doing something more travel oriented?"
Cas continued his exploration of Dean's neck, a smile on his lips, as his hands slid slowly down Dean's chest. Dean's heart began to race, eyes opening to flick towards the door, suddenly all too aware of the vague figures moving around the office outside. He felt a soft tug at his stomach, Cas gently pulling at his shirt to untuck it, but giving Dean the opportunity to stop him if he wanted.
Giant picture windows surround him, dousing the entire floor in a soft glow as the morning sun struggles to rise above the Seattle cloud cover. To his right, along the outer wall are a series of desks designed to be shared in a similar fashion to a computer café. To his left, three long tables with bar seating stretch parallel to a couple glass enclosed meeting rooms. A few lazy morning smiles turn to greet the pair as they walk to the other side of the floor, between the desks and tables. While personal belongings are strewn across most of the desk spaces, it seems all present are gathered around the long tables, talking quietly, coffee cups clutched in their fists.
He made no moves to leave the office for the rest of the day after this morning's incident. On Fridays, Dean would run the blocks to work rather than going to the gym. It was a nice way to start his weekend, and gave him the little burst of adrenaline to get through the day. His office had a nice ensuite bathroom, equipped with a small shower and closet. Sam had told him that before the company bought the building, the top floor was intended to be a penthouse suite. Plumbing already in place, they decided to make use of it when the plans changed to an office suite. Dean took full advantage, despite Sam telling him it was 'weird' to shower at work. It had never been an issue. Well, before today it hadn't.
She let out a puff of breath, looking quickly back at Cas before continuing, "Dean Winchester, stop worrying about everyone else and worry about you. What do you want? Why don't you try just opening up to someone, see where that gets you? Try a different approach this time! And please, everyone loves and supports you, and we are willing to take down anyone who says otherwise. Do something to make you happy. Take the man out on a date
Dean was a little nervous that Cas would be bored. Sure he had mentioned wanting to explore the city, but he'd been here for weeks and maybe what Dean had planned wouldn't be any fun. Maybe Dean was just getting nervous, and maybe he needed to just do the damn thing because he liked Cas and he wanted to hang with the guy.
Dean is half aware that Sam has stopped talking, and he cracks an eye to peer over at him. He’s watching him, the crease between his eyebrows all Dean needs to see to realize he understands what he was doing.
"So did you see anything good?" He asked, waggling his eyebrows suggestively.
He was just stepping out the door when he felt a hand on his arm and froze. He turned to Dean, who was standing just behind him, making the hair on the back of his neck tingle. Dean seemed to be particularly focused on Cas's eyes as he spoke.
At that, Dean glanced behind them towards the booths of Winchester Roasters employees, as if he forgot they were there. This had been Cas's intention, to distract him enough that he might forget where he was. While the idea of taking Dean home was, at this point, something Cas was definitely interested in, he was having a perfectly fun time with their banter. He glanced back at his table, where Charlie had taken his seat and was deep in conversation with the guys. "It seems Charlie took the last seat, huh," he mentioned, hoping Dean would take the bait to continue their one on one time.
"Oh no, no, by all means, continue!" Dean said with a wave of his hand, "This is the perfect time, when I'm wide awake and fully attentive."
So when Monday rolled around, he had made up his mind to not make this into more than what it was, fun. Cas gave him a quick glance, accompanied by a deep blush and a smile as he had walked into his office. He wasn't sure if Cas was the kiss and tell type, and so making any obvious advances in the office was out of the question. He did make more frequent trips outside of his private office than he needed to, however. Cas was, once again, wearing a slim fitting button down and slacks that hugged him in all the right places. His hair was a little unruly, but his eyes their usual breathtaking blue. He had caught Dean checking him out at least once, and met Dean's slightly embarrassed gaze with the raising of an eyebrow. After lunch, on Dean's third unnecessary trip to the brewing counter, his thoughts were interrupted by a deliciously rumbling voice behind him.
, and Dean wasn't used to having it served right back to him. But wow, he kind of liked it. He gaped at Cas, eyes pausing on his ass for a second, as he walked back to where Charlie and the guys were sitting. Balthazar and Charlie both shot Dean a quick glance as they turned to see Cas walking over, probably trying to figure out what had just happened.
Balthazar had texted Cas immediately upon getting in the elevator, sending simply a heart eyes and drooling emoji. Cas had rolled his eyes. Over lunch, Balthazar had spoken enthusiastically about the entire 2 minute interaction, picking apart every detail.
Cas had spent the day checking over his shoulder, making sure Mr. Winchester was not looming behind him with a soul piercing, green eyed glare. Every once in a while, he looked up to see another office employee watching him with an amused grin. The clock seemed to slow down with each hour that passed. Fridays were apparently slow, nobody wanting to bother the CEO so close to the weekend. At this point, downing a couple drinks sounded more and more appealing. Anything to push the embarrassment out of his head, and make less obvious the flush that rushed to his cheeks every time he thought about it.
Cas's eyes widened, a flush spreading across his cheeks as the tickle of Dean's breath shot through every nerve in his body- right down to his dick. At this proximity, there was no way Dean
"Hello?" he supplied, sitting up and rubbing his eyes before he had a second to consider what this call might be about.
Cas had started at the front desk of the local library in his small hometown as a Summer job. He found he had a natural knack for keeping things in order, for talking to people, offering direction or advice, and so he kept the job through the rest of high school. College had never appealed to him, so he took his talents and traveled with them. One letter of recommendation to the next, he had picked up jobs in vet clinics, doctor’s offices, car dealerships, anything he could find really, and he traveled, staying in places for as long or as little as he pleased. He had been beach side, had stayed in the mountains, spent time in bigger cities, until he found himself heading for Seattle, Washington.
"You have poured every piece of yourself into your work since he left, and it doesn't matter why, because look what has come out of it! We have grown as a company, and a family and a team because of you Dean. Maybe you closed yourself off for a while, sure, but Cas came along and was able to get through to you. And you
It was a normal question, but Dean felt the heat spring to his cheeks, "Well, uh, yeah I mean, I would usually, but.. If you, you know, I can wait till you.. Do whatever.." He rubbed the back of his neck, looking away from the eyes that were slowly narrowing at him.
"I don't know, Sammy. It just seems like I can't ever get a win. I thought after things with Benny… I don't know. It took me a while to get back on my feet after, now it looks like it was just to get knocked back on my ass." He wouldn't look at Sam, eyes focused on the ceiling above the booth while his fingers traced idly through the condensation on his glass. "I thought things would be better, because, I mean, how could they be
Cas's breath caught when he said his name, the way his face flushed when he had gotten close to him. The way he only held Dean's gaze when he thought nobody else was watching. Dean's face was getting warm just thinking about it, thinking about being frozen under Cas's stare while his voice rumbled out-
Cas could feel his face getting hot as his brows furrowed in concern, not sure how to proceed. Dean didn't know Cas knew about Benny, so for him to bring it up would lead to more of a mess. But he couldn't ignore this, could he? He had never made things official with Dean, so maybe that meant Dean was seeing other people. But this wasn't just other people, this was his
"I apologize for driving you crazy," he said, his voice coming out, if it was even possible, raspier than usual.
Cas's face flushed and he cast his eyes back down. "I um, some of the other employees were talking and…" he trailed off. Dean's jaw tightened as soon as the sentence was out of Cas's mouth, his eyes no longer soft and inquiring but hardened.  Why the fuck couldn't people keep their mouths shut.
For a moment they stood in silence, Charlie not entirely done with her pep talk and Dean not done with repressing his feelings.
Charlie led Cas out of the waiting room, down the hall to her office. Upon walking in, he couldn’t help but smile. The office had a floor to ceiling bookshelf full of coffee mugs picturing characters from various comic books and movies.
Balthazar's comment had not made it any better. Did he come off as gay? Not that he cared if he did, but that might have made Mr. Winchester even more uncomfortable. He paused at that thought, wondering if perhaps that was what made the man so stand offish. He shook his head, there was no way this guy could be a homophobe, not in this office. Maybe it was the whole
"Thanks. Me too." He all but choked out, throwing his backpack over his shoulder and turning to hurry toward the elevators.
Over waffles, with a side of bacon (
On Wednesday, he made chicken pesto pasta for dinner with Cas. Cas watched, eyes narrowed and head tilted to the side, from a safe distance, asking some questions but mostly mesmerized by the way Dean danced around effortlessly as he cooked. They ate with bread and wine, and collapsed on the couch giggly, full, and attached at the lips when it was over. The next morning, Dean lent Cas a fresh shirt and hung around outside the office to give him a head start, not realizing till much later that their matching hickeys probably gave them away.
Left alone to feel his cheeks flush, he decides Dean fucking Winchester needs to be more of a boss and less of the charismatic friendly face people around the office seem to see him as. No more mister nice Dean he thinks as he exhales. He sets his jaw, elevator doors opening to the seventh floor office penthouse, and steps out.
Dean cleared his throat, sitting up a little straighter as he typed in his password. "I thought you said he was a confident professional. He doesn't need a job introduction" he replied coolly, not lifting his eyes from the screen. Charlie was one of his closest friends, but this was work, and if needed to take his job more seriously than so be it.
"So… have you heard from him?" Charlie asked, cautiously.
There were moments when Dean was soft, the look in his eyes similar to the one he had when they had watched the sunsets, and other times when the man was ravenous for Cas's lips. Either way, Cas felt like he floated through each day.
He squeezes his eyes shut one last time before raising his head and looking out to the street, and feels his breath punch out of him as his eyes meet squinting blue.
Climbing back into his car, he dialed the number, putting it on speaker and pulled back out onto the road. He had barely registered he had been holding his breath when Dean's voice came over the line, breathy and concerned.
Cas moved his hands to either side of Dean's head, crawling upward as he continued his slow thrusts, planting soft kisses up his stomach, chest, and neck until his head was resting against his collarbone.
, or maybe it was because he had too many. It wasn't Cas's business to force that on him, either way.
He squinted at Dean, tilting his head to the side, "Are you… asking me out?"
Dean smirked then, eager to change the subject. "You used to be able to keep up," he gestured at Sam's mostly full glass. Sam's eyes narrowed, accepting the challenge, catching up without missing a beat.
Dean rounded the corner to see Gabriel step into the elevator, and hurried to catch the ride up with him. Seeing Dean's thoughtful expression, he raised an eyebrow. "Worried about the new guy?" he asked, ever perceptive. Dean sputtered, annoyed that everyone knew him well enough to read him so easily. Maybe that was his damn problem.
Exhaling, he squared his shoulders and clicked to open up his email. The phone ringing to his right gave the final jolt to break him free of his thoughts.
Dean threw his arms around Cas's neck, pulling him down into a kiss that said more than any words ever could. Cas picked up his pace again, something gentler than before, resting his forehead against Dean's when they pulled apart for air.
They walked home chatting about their day as usual, and were barely in the door when Dean pressed him up against the wall, his lips immediately finding Cas's neck.
Cas’ expression brightens ever so slightly as he nods. Dean suddenly feels nervous again. He begins to fidget awkwardly as he speaks. Damn he hates chick-flick moments. “Look, Cas, uh… I just wanted to say that… I’m sorry.”
“Of course I’m- I mean…”
are the reason everything went to shit, Cas. You think that telling me how you feel is gonna change what happened?”
“Have you ever even thought that maybe I want to save you too? You save us all the time, whether we want you to or not! So don't be such a damn hypocrite..."
“It’s up to you, Cas,” Sam finally says. “Angel or not, you’re family. Whatever decision you make- we’re here for you.”
easy, and a truly pleasant experience, or so Dean thinks.
The Shadow clicks their tongue in annoyance. “...Looks like I’ve gotta run. But don't worry, I’ll be seeing you again real soon, tree-topper. Don't go anywhere.”
try for you?”
. Dean can’t deny that despite the hesitation he feels lighter now, like one of the thousand-pound weights that he carries on his back every day has been lifted.
“I love you,” he repeats, boldly stepping closer. “Everything I ever did for you, everything I do now, everything I will do- it’s because I love you.”
Sam chuckles. “Right. Well, honestly, it is kinda weird that we’ve never had a case near a beach,” he admits as he sits down across from Dean.
“And that was that.”
, man, you’re even
Castiel looks at him and nods in acknowledgment. “Hello Dean.”
“There’s nothing you could’ve done,” Cas argues. “No matter what you say, no matter what you feel, nothing could have saved me. Regardless of the reason that I went after Lucifer, regardless of if I wanted to live or not, that fact remains true. You mean too much to this world to continue on like this. I won’t expect you to listen, you have never been particularly good at that, but I will ask this.”
at the implication of his words. “Cas, I... I don’t wanna be the reason you fall,” he says. “I don’t wanna be the reason you lose everything. I can’t live with that. I just
“Good call,” Dean says idly. “What about the Shadow or whatever?”
“Hello Miracle!” Jack says sweetly as he lovingly strokes her ear. “I’m Jack.”

to argue- but he understands what Cas is getting at, and given how they both were, arguing about it would only be continuing to go in circles, and that's the last thing he wants for either of them. “I just… I guess I’m just having a hard time believing it, man. We’re here. We’re
“No,” Jack says flatly. “He might be asleep. If he is, I’ll have to wake him up first. Then once he's awake, I can see where he is in the Empty and go right to him.”
“Well, Sam learned from the best.” Cas sets the towel down after he finishes drying. “Thank you. This lesson has been… informative.”
“My head hurts.”
so I can spend time with Eileen. It’s a win-win situation."
he’d said.
Jack smiles sadly. It’s terribly bittersweet. “I didn’t want to tell you this because it’s kind of embarrassing, but the reason I didn’t want to go back with you at first was because… I thought that the longer I spent with you… the harder it would be for me to let go. I thought that I had to leave then while I still could. But then I realized that you were right- that even after everything, I couldn’t just leave Cas like that. Not when he raised me to be who I am.”
The passage of time blurs together in here. It could've been minutes, hours, days,
“Yeah, according to Jason. Could be more. He doesn’t have a whole lot of details. But apparently they’re pretty pissed off. They already killed two people- two college kids who were exploring an abandoned house after hearing rumors that it was haunted. There was only one other survivor. Poor guy was scared out of his mind.”
“Why would the Empty care about keeping Cas there?” Sam asks. “Why would they care so much about Cas but just let someone like
“Sam’s right,” Dean adds, although something deep down tells him that their attempts may be futile. “Come back home. We can- we can start a new life, you know? We can go back to having movie nights in the bunker- you always loved those.”
Cas nods. “I can assure you, I don’t think I’ll ever want it back unless I have to take it back. But I appreciate it.”
“You’re probably right,” Sam admits. “I just feel bad for these kids. They didn’t get the justice they deserved.”
Dean tries to hide the flush sitting high on his cheeks. “Yeah, well… kinda taught Sam everything he knows about, well… everything. Besides his lawyer shit.” He waves a dismissive hand. “That was all Stanford. Although if you were to ask him now about anything he learned there, I doubt he’d remember.”
me that I’ve been nothing but shitty to you, okay? I’m never gonna be able to make it up to you no matter what I do so just-”
“What? No, that’s not what I’m saying! It’s just that I’ve been a little out of the game when it comes to the whole job thing, you know? I mean at least you’ve got a little bit of college under your belt. I dropped out in high school.”
“Perhaps, but I couldn’t help myself. Humans were still new to me and angels are unable to dream. Your imagination is fascinating.”
“When’,” Dean notes. “You never had to worry about that before.”
when she finds out,” Sam says through a laugh. When both Dean and Cas shoot him a look, he clears his throat awkwardly and adds, “she uh, she told me a while back she had a feeling about the two of you. Apparently you guys give off ‘intense parent vibes’.”
“Cas? Hey, Cas! You’re okay. I’ve got you; you’re alright.”
Castiel smiles sympathetically at him. “It’s not. As much as we both wish it was, it’s not. But…” he gestures to their surroundings, “this is your way of grieving. You’re allowed to be upset. You live a life of repression and sublimation, after all.”
“I don’t regret what I did. If I am meant to die protecting the two of you, then so be it.”
He’s made his choice, and he doesn’t regret it.
Then, in that moment, Dean does something he never does.
“Jack,” he says through a breath of relief. It floods him with joy to see a familiar face that
Dean hasn't slept since Cas- and he's glad for it. If he had a dream, he knows that it would've featured Cas.
He makes a promise.
that voice- and the Shadow had just left to go investigate, after all... right?
Cas repeats. “There is a part of me that wants to keep what remains of my Grace. It’s my essence- everything that makes me an angel. And my last experience as a human was… less than pleasant.”
A small smile spreads on Cas’ face as he leans into Dean. “Thank you. And for what it’s worth, Dean, I forgive you.”
Dean chuckles at how absurd that sounds. But of course, if Dean were to give Cas some lame ass apology like that, he would accept it and say something like “no need to apologize, Dean. You were under the influence of the Mark”. And then he’d smile kindly and tell Dean not to worry.
Despite the uncomfortable angle, Cas melts into him immediately. He accepts Dean so readily and
Cas blinks and furrows his brow, but nods and steps to the side to let Dean enter. As Dean observes his room, he shuts the door and pauses his latest episode of
Sam shifts uncomfortably in his chair. “Oh, they do. I um… got a lot of death threats. While I was calling around.”
It’s real. And he
“Shit,” he muttered low under his breath, turning his head to wipe at his eyes and cheeks. “Damn Cas, got me bawling like a baby over here…”
Despite how much it hurts him to do so, Dean bites his tongue- for the moment.
He decides to start with the most pressing question on his mind. "Why'd you do it?"
Sam drums his fingers against the table. “If you really don’t want to talk about it, I can’t force you. But Cas was my friend too. Don’t you think I have a right to know everything that happened?”
Again, he doesn’t answer. So Dean doesn’t question it anymore. Whether or not it was “real” was starting to become less and less of an issue. Frankly, Dean was just glad that he could see him, even if this Cas was just a figment of his imagination, trying to console him and keep him grounded.
Sam? There is no ‘maybe’. This is
He used to think of Dean Winchester's overflowing empathy as a poison. He knows better now. It's the greatest gift Dean has ever given him. It's that very gift that gave him the strength to do this.
Cas looks up at him, amused. “You’re very smooth, Dean.”
“Everyone’s gone,” he continues. “Cas… Mom… even Crowley… everyone. Sam… what do we do?”
Well, he was about to be a huge hypocrite.
Oh God.
“Even though you broke the first seal and kickstarted armageddon?”
Dean dramatically drops his fork. “You did
“Oh well.” He rises to his feet. “Cas, let’s go get a beer.”
“Hey, Cas, look- it’s okay.” Dean says as he walks over to sit beside Cas.
Then Sam does the thing- he gives him the
“...I had assumed that your interests only lied with women,” Cas admits. “Until you kissed me. I’ve been confused ever since, but I didn’t want to pressure you.”
After that, something in Dean’s mind seems to shift. He’s come to the realization that kissing Cas is something that he can actually
Truth be told, there was no way that Cas could be alive, he was there when they buried his body (they had opted for a burial on the off-chance that he could come back) and he was most definitely dead. He wasn’t in Purgatory, Hell, and definitely not Heaven. But even so, despite being a natural skeptic, Dean tried to be open to all possibilities when presented with reasonable cause. And if there was even a slight chance that Cas was out there somewhere, alive or not, he would take it.
“I know,” he interrupts. “Cas was… important to you. He was important to both of us, but, in his own words… you guys had a ‘profound bond’.”
Sam leans against the table. “So what, you think he’s communicating with you in your dreams?”
Cas. Feel
He pulls him into an embrace, and the dam that had been holding it all back, the hopelessness, the self-hatred, the
live after he had the perfect opportunity to kill her.
He leans in, raising his hands to grab Cas’ face, when he hears the door click open- and he jumps back faster than he thought was humanly possible.
“...But you’re going to die one day,” Dean tells him urgently. “I mean- you’ve never had to worry about that before.”
“He’s an

actually.
“That's not it- of course I want to,” Jack insists in a slightly raised voice, hurt laced in his tone. “I... I want Cas back too. I miss him more than anything.”
And just like he predicted, Cas interrupts him to pin the blame on himself. “Dean, I should be apologizing. I’m the one that has betrayed you so many times. I’m the one who has always turned my back on you. I’m the one that didn’t trust you when I should have. I’m the one that… I’m…” And suddenly, Cas can’t find his breath to continue speaking, and he gasps, desperately trying to take in air as more tears begin to brim in his eyes. Dean is quick to pull the angel close to him, his previous matter of personal space now lost to the past.
don’t even understand it. But I don’t have to. I just have to believe. I just have to be myself. You, Sam, Cas, and my mother- you all taught me that. It’s thanks to all of you that I had the strength to do this.”
He doesn't feel all that nervous, though. He knows Sam well enough to know that he has no reason to be anxious.
“Sam dreams about Mary a lot,” Castiel continues. “He told me that once. I visited his dreams a few times when I was alive. I felt strange about interrupting dreams with her in them, so I merely watched as a spectator.”
and here is part 2!
And when he hears the flap of angel wings and a flash of a tan trench coat, he knows then that he’s
Dean closes his eyes again, as if it pains him to look at him. He can’t bear to look him in the eyes. "I-I want... I want
He knows that he, even if unintentionally, played a role in that as well. If he can save Jack from that fate...
The words roll off his tongue so easily now. He almost wonders why he had so much trouble with it before- but he knows exactly why.
what Billie said?! If there is one thing I’ve learned during my time here on Earth, during my time with
Dean hadn’t really thought about it like that. Perhaps a case would do them all good. Before, when Cas came back from Purgatory, he had mentioned wanting to be a hunter. He wonders if he still holds that desire now that he has the chance to pursue it.
“I’ll tell you again, if you want,” Cas continues. “One of the reasons I didn’t bring it up again was because I thought it would hurt you, or make you uncomfortable. But if you still don't get it, I'll say it again."
his brain reminds him.
it’s so rare to see him smile like that- big and carefree. “Yes. Of course.”
Castiel turns to face the park. “Do you remember when I came back from Purgatory? You thought it was your fault. You thought you had left me behind. But I just didn’t feel like I deserved to be saved, I felt like I had to stay.”
Castiel fidgets with his now empty shot glass. “I don’t remember much, but it was not a pleasant feeling. I’d rather not do it again. It takes an entire liquor store to intoxicate me, after all.”
“Alright,” Jack says, his eyes flashing gold. “Let’s get back before-”
And Dean doesn’t think he should have to feel like he’s living with a ghost.
“Don’t- don’t make excuses for me,” Dean says lowly. He musters his courage and meets Cas' intense gaze. “Please.”
The knife that had been in Dean's gut since Cas' return twists again.
Cas wasn't going to let Dean talk his way out of this. Not again. There was too much left unsaid between them for him to risk letting Dean weasel his way out of a conversation. “No, you are going to stand there and shut up and
Dean lets out a bitter laugh. He steps closer to Cas- closer than they’ve been in a while- perhaps closer than they've ever been. “...You’re in love with me,” he says. He despises how wobbly his voice sounds.
The angel refuses to meet his eyes, keeping his gaze fixed on the ground.
Sam tenses at the suggestion. “Alive?”
But in the meantime, when Dean isn't agonizing over this in his room alone, he decides to try and teach Cas how to do more mundane things- things that he enjoyed doing more than he cared to admit. It gives both of them something to do when they’re not watching movies or TV shows.
Miracle barks excitedly and rubs her nose against Jack's hand.
I don’t expect you to get it, but Cas is-“
“Dude-”
“What do you want with me now?” he asks, sounding far more annoyed with them than frightened or intimidated.
Dean stiffens at the mention of John. “...Well, you haven't been to a doctor either,” he grumbles after a few seconds of silence.
to sort out your issues-
Sam’s eyes go wide. “...You never told me that.”
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and heads towards the door. "Fuck it. I can't fucking do this, sorry I wasted your time-"
“No,” Cas said frantically, “no, what did he do Sam? What did he do?”
the Mark!”
“Dean. This is your mind attempting to ease your guilt. Because you know, both here and in the real world, that I wouldn’t let you feel guilty about this. Not for one second.”
Dean’s face heats with shame. “...Yeah,” he says hesitantly. “Why?”
He’s tired of the excuses and the bullshit- he couldn’t see why Jack would want to deny him. He's so
The world is significantly safer. Not
Cas holds up a finger. “Let me finish. As my friend, you feel obligated to protect me. I understand. But laying down my life for you? For Sam? For this world? It was the greatest sacrifice I’ve ever made. And I don’t regret it.”
“They’re back on Earth,” Jack says quickly. "But we don’t have a lot of time. There’s only one surefire way to get you out of here- you’ll just have to trust me.”
“I know,” Dean replies, "and someday I’ll tell you everything. But just… just not right now, okay?”
Dean Winchester can tell when he’s dreaming. He’s been through too many dream-induced states for him to not be able to.
"Okay. Sorry." Sam sighs and runs his hand through his hair. "But Jack did say that he had a plan. You should trust him."
“This will do extremely little for me,” he points out, yet he accepts it nonetheless. “But thank you.”
“...I’ll take it for now,” Cas finally says. He looks over at Sam and Dean and smiles. “My powers may be failing, but I suppose I can make what little I have left be of some use, even if only for a short time.”
“You sure? Because we can still pray to Jack- ask him to fix you up. He said the last time he was here-”
Dean swerves, slamming on the breaks as the Impala not so gracefully screeches to a stop in an empty motel parking lot. “Don’t say that! Too many people have died because of us, Cas. Too damn many. And I’m not gonna let you-“
and Dean is filled with a feeling that he can't put into words. It's far too great, way beyond his understanding. It slowly pours through his veins and sinks into every square inch of his body, settling him and preventing him from trembling further.
It's the first contact he's had in what feels like centuries, so Castiel melts into it, holding onto Jack a bit longer before reluctantly releasing him. “Jack… are Sam and Dean really...”
Sam glances uncomfortably at the space between Jack and Dean and sighs. “Jack, could you give us a minute?” he asks.
he exclaims.
“That’s not…” he trailed off, looking guiltily at the beer next to him. He tried to protest, but the knowing expression on his face gave him away. “I’m not good at goodbyes, okay?” he finally said. He wanted to wince after he realized it came out snappier than he'd meant it to.
“It’s alright.”
Dean opens his mouth to answer, but closes it again when Cas suddenly walks across the living room over to the tiny hallway.
“Bullshit,” Dean retorts, stepping closer to the angel. “This isn’t a coping mechanism, this is
“You thought I wouldn’t find out?” Cas stormed into the kitchen- Dean swore he could see grace flickering in his eyes. “You were just going to doom yourself to an eternity in the ocean without telling me?"
They eat in silence for a few moments, with Dean making an occasional comment about how Chinese food isn’t nearly as good once it's reheated, before Sam clears his throat, and by the look on his face Dean can tell that he’s about to launch into one of his Feelings Speeches- the very topic he'd been trying to avoid.
Dean shakes his head. “No, Cas, I mean tell us where you are
what I’m worried about,” Dean argues. “Look, when Cas was human, he had it rough after I… after I kicked him out. He was starving, he had nowhere to sleep- he even got himself
Dean’s jaw tightens. “...Alright. Fine.”
“We should hurry,” Cas says, brushing past both of them to take the lead. “Before they show up.”
Sam says flatly. “Of course you’re not gay.”
“Well that’s great, but uh… could you maybe give it back?”
He can hardly believe it. “Are you… are you really here?”
“Oh- you
Sam blinks owlishly before bursting into loud laughter. “Why’d you say it like it was some kind of government secret?”
"They just... let him go?"
Panic settled like a heavy weight in Cas’ chest as the reality of the situation hit him. He’d just
Castiel looks over to him and nods. “...Yes. I’m ready.”
“…I apologize for making you feel that way. I just... want you to choose
Dean doesn’t sleep- although he's not sure if it's due to his own stubbornness or his body's refusal to do so. He wishes he could just shut down, shut it all out.
the one he-” he pauses, swallowing back the words yet again. He tries to force them out and they don't budge.
awake for at least quite a few centuries.
He must know Cas pretty well then, because his mind had done a damn good job of tricking him. Of course he does- he knows Cas almost like he knows Sam.
. The voice is warm.
“Awfully charming, isn’t it?” he remarks, nudging Sam’s arm. Sam merely rolls his eyes and doesn't bother to humor him with an answer.
Cas answers the door when he knocks and immediately welcomes Dean into his room- he doesn’t question him, doesn’t ask what he’s doing there. Dean walks inside, and to break the ice he makes some sort of comment about how this room lacked personality and needed some decorations, and immediately regrets it as soon as it comes out of his mouth.
be against this?”
“Cas-“
He likes this. He really does. He likes being able to lay in bed with someone else on the other side. He likes that the other person is Cas.
Sam pulls a face. “I’ll go with the Chinese food.”
“You’ve been saving our asses for years, Cas. And yet… have we ever saved you?”
“I like you.”
“...Holy shit,” he says, voice breathy, “I mean- I had always suspected, but I didn’t want to assume…”
is more like it.” Dean sighs, internally resigning himself to whatever Sam had in mind. “Alright. Whatcha got?”
Dean wants to say something,
“Jeez, aren’t you a ray of sunshine,” Dean mumbles as he takes another bite. “That’s kinda fucked up, isn’t it? I mean- we’ve saved this world how many times?”
Jack’s eyes light up at the mention of the Nintendo Switch that Sam had gotten him when they celebrated Christmas together with Mrs. Butters. “...I did miss that,” he admits. “Okay," he says, "we’ll talk again in the morning.”
“Really?” the Shadow questions, clearly dedicated to their performance. “I never forgave you for
And you usually come back from college.
But things were different now. Cas had a home and it was with them, and now he was gone.
. But everything after that kept happening so fast that Dean hasn’t had time to sit down and focus.
But he’s not strong. He’s never been strong.
"Since now. Now quit bitching. We're not that far."
The world didn’t become a paradise just because Jack took over- there are still monsters, still bad people in the world- and they’ll never stop. Monsters will continue to exist long past Dean’s lifetime. Dean has always believed that evil is eternal, and meeting God hadn't changed his mind on that.
He stops. The words he so desperately wants to say wait impatiently within him.
“Of course.” Castiel nods. “What did you have in mind?”
Dean hung his head, bringing a hand up to rub the back of his neck. "Charlie, I don't know. After the other day I just can't get him out of my head." He paused, looking over to where Cas was listening enthusiastically to whatever dorky thing Sam was saying. "It's different. I feel like I can't get enough… like I want to just know everything about him."
It didn't take long for Balthazar to catch on, him and Gabriel cornering Cas at the elevators one morning until he agreed to talk with them over lunch. Cas knew Dean was still hesitant, even if he didn't say it out loud, and so he was sparse with the details. Gabe understood why Dean would be so apprehensive, making sure to convey the seriousness to Balthazar before he went spilling to the whole office.
"Did he call out sick?" Dean croaked, his voice giving away a weekend lacking in sleep.
He sighed, knowing full well this would happen eventually. He curled forward, letting his chin rest on his knees. "Sure." he murmured.
"So, if you don't mind me asking, what will you call it?" He asked.
"What- how, who else knows about this?" He asked, nerves rising.
"I'm not sure, maybe. Depends how the day goes." He shrugged, he would make up his mind later.
So instead, he sat staring blankly at his phone in an empty café at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon. He was acutely aware of the barista glancing over at him every few seconds, probably because he had come in and sat down without ordering anything, and was now just sitting there in silence. With a long exhale he hauled himself up and walked to the register.
"Good morning Mr. Winchester" Charlie smiled as he opened the door. Dean rolled his eyes.
"Cas!" Dean yelped when he finally caught sight of him, taking a startled step backward.
His self loathing train of thought was cut off by a quiet knock on the office door. He could see Charlie's red ponytail bobbing out of sight as he caught her peeking through the adjacent frosted window. Dean chuckled, dragging himself up and tossing the paper ball into the nearby trash can, thinking he was thankful not everyone close to him was as big an asshole as Benny was.
A million thoughts raced through his head as he sat, Dean getting himself organized. What had he done wrong? Dean had seemed relatively friendly literally moments ago. Maybe somebody had said something about him? Or something about Balthazar? Color quickly flooded back into his cheeks at the thought, and he lifted his eyes from his knees to the green ones watching him from across the desk. Dean smiled.
With a grin, he turned to greet Cas, "Good morning, sunshine!" Dean poured Cas a cup of coffee, and refilled his own mug before sliding onto the bar stool next to him. "How'd you sleep?"
They strolled back to the table, trying to look as nonchalant as possible, despite the small smile tugging at their lips. Dean was glad their friends paid them the courtesy of not making a huge deal as they walked up. The group was getting ready to head out, and Balthazar offered to split an Uber with Cas.
A beat of silence, where Cas saw Dean's lips tug upward as they stared at each other, then Dean was shimmying himself into Cas's space. Dean nuzzled at Cas's jaw, trailing his lips up to his ear while he wound his arms around Cas's waist. "I think I owe you a favor from earlier" he breathed in Cas's ear.
"He's ignored all my calls and texts, I just, I don't know what to do. I snapped, I deserve this, I just wish I had explained it to him and now he wants nothing to do with me all because of what everyone
Slowing his hand, Cas considered this. He was, and always had been, a giver. He liked watching his partners fall apart by his doing. But Dean wanted to do that for him, who was he to deny the man.
"You can't fool me, Dean. You think turning into a stone cold CEO is going to change what happened? Prevent it from happening again? Your employees, your team, loves you Dean. That's how you built Roasters into something this great. Don't push people away. You're the reason they love coming to work every day."
was the only word Dean could think.
"Hello? Are you gonna spill?" She asked, mouth full of fries.
Cas shivered, glancing around the apartment before meeting Dean's eyes, "Do you want to shower?"
Suddenly a soft hand on his shoulder. Gabriel. One of Sam's oldest and dearest friends. Dean cleared his throat causing Sammy to turn, his eyes lighting up when they landed on Gabe. It was always a funny sight, Sam being almost two times Gabriel's height, pulling him into an embrace. They talked excitedly, forgetting about everyone else, and Dean smiled. Sam made the office feel like a home again, when for so long it was just work.
Two hours into his drive back north, Cas stopped off for some gas and snacks. He had left almost immediately upon hanging up with Charlie, throwing his phone in his bag, then into the back seat, speeding out onto the highway. Now, as he refueled, he fished his phone out of his bags, seeing notifications he hadn't bothered to check after his wake up call.
"Oh!" He exclaimed, "You have to see if he can hold out till Friday. Get him when he's coming in from his run." He waggled his eyebrows at this, and now Cas rolled his eyes.
Despite his friendly attitude toward the other employees, he had yet to establish an outside of work relationship. Granted it was only the first week, and tonight he had agreed to go out for drinks. He also understood the employees being apprehensive to trust him as a new guy in light of the recent scandal. Hopefully tonight would change that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabe's still arched eyebrow implied he didn't buy it, but he wasn't going to pry. Not yet, anyway.
He watched as Dean tensed for a moment before turning around, eyeing him over the rim of his mug. Cas made sure to hold his gaze.
She shook her head, glancing back through the frosted glass at the empty chair. "Have you heard from him?"
He stopped himself, squeezing his eyes shut and taking a deep breath. Cas was nothing like Benny. What he had with Cas was nowhere near similar, it was so remarkably different and Dean was happy for the first time in a long time. Even if they hadn’t put a label on themselves, he wanted to keep this thing going.
Dean opened his mouth to protest, but with one look and a raised eyebrow, Charlie cut him off.
"Cas!" she nearly squealed and it occurred to him that he had ignored all her texts and calls for the last three days, "Can you talk for a minute?"
"It's just my voice, I don't do it on purpose," he had replied.
It was a Friday evening, and Dean had suggested skipping out on end of week drinks in favor of going home (Dean's home, although sometimes Cas caught himself calling it home as well) to make a nice dinner and watch a movie. Dean had pushed Cas from the kitchen, declaring he needed to be alone for something so extravagant, and so Cas found himself on the couch. He was half flipping through channels and half watching Dean in awe as he floated around the kitchen humming to himself.
Sitting in the café sipping on his latte, he fantasized briefly about stepping out of his life long role behind a desk and instead, stepping behind a counter, dawning an apron and hand crafting the small cups of perfection that his office dwelling coworkers worked so hard to put out in the world. Just out of curiosity he opened his laptop, doing a quick search for barista jobs in Seattle, and chuckled at the results. The Winchester Roasters shop, the one he and Dean stopped at so frequently, was hiring.
Dean needed to release some of this pent up tension or he was going to lose it. He toyed with the idea of relieving himself in his private bathroom, but why would he do that when the source of his frustration was just outside his door?
Dean cut in, "Yeah he, uh, came to keep me company…" he trailed off, eyes lowering as he rubbed the back of his head.
"And hey, thanks for the coffee Cas."
" he groaned, thrusting a little to meet Cas's mouth. "Cas I'm, I'm
"I think you've got a pretty good seat right now," Dean mused, finally returning the once over Cas had given him. Cas waited to meet his eyes, intending to hold them they way they had at lunch the day before. This time, Cas licked his lips, savoring the way Dean's cheeks flushed pink as his eyes shifted down to watch. His eyes came back up to Cas's, this time with the slightest glint of
That's what Dean had let himself believe anyway, but a couple hours and quiet a few beers later, they were stumbling through the door of Dean's hotel room, desperate to make up for lost time, to gain closure maybe, to take out all the pent up emotions that had been bubbling under their skin. Dean wasn't sure if the relationship he had with Benny had been real or just another means of getting information, but this felt pretty real. Dean could give him nothing else, and so maybe what he wanted this time was Dean.
Throughout the week, Dean called Cas into his office for help with paperwork or calendar questions. Only, when Cas stepped inside, Dean would push him up against the desk, grinding into him and tangling his fingers in Cas's hair as he pressed their lips together.
Finally, exasperated, he lobbed his phone in the general direction of his little brother's big head and let out an aggravated groan. "
He figured maybe jumping into this fire was the easiest way to get over the fear of being burned. Dean wasn't trying to recreate his relationship with Benny, but he needed to get past all the crap he associated with it if he wanted things to move forward with Cas.
"Alright alright, just poking fun. I'll get back to you about the farm before the end of the week, okay?" Dean could still hear the smile in Sam's voice, but he didn't press it.
He hesitated, not wanting to read further into this then he should, but his stomach still being in knots said otherwise.
This was a very important business man, someone whose business practices, mission statement, and face were admired by people world wide. And now, Cas had the responsibility to… to, what? Not screw it up like past employees had? Maintain his reputation? Make sure he got his coffee in the morning? No, he was in the coffee business, he had to get his own coffee. Did he? Was this Cas's job now? Never in his life had he doubted his confidence in his job, it defined him, this was who he was. But this was different, and he felt all too warm as a wave of nerves flooded through him.
Cas smirked to himself,
When he was outside, he called Charlie. Charlie was the only person that had grown to know both of the fairly well, and he needed her input as far as Dean's side went in this.
"Dean, I can read the signs, you don't need to say it out loud. I know rejection when I see it, please just let me go." He blinked back the hot pricking of tears. He shouldn't care so much.
His whole life, people had called him Cas. Easier to pronounce and spell than his full name, it had just become who he was. But there was something different about the way Dean said it that made his breath catch in his throat. Even if he would play the sound over in his head, he didn't want to think much more into it. He barely knew the guy.
He took a deep breath as he hung up, continuing his walk the couple blocks to his studio. He wondered if Dean would call, or if he should call to clear the air, or if Dean would go see Benny now that Cas had left for the evening.
“Wha- Cas?” Sam says, taking a slow step forward and reaching out to grasp Cas’s hand. He hauls them to their feet, Dean still clutching tightly to Cas and Cas’s free arm firm around Dean’s waist as he turns to repeat to Sam the same few words he had given Dean.
He swallows back a small sob and shakes his head, not even sure how to respond, his mind now screaming into the void with the pain he feels in his chest. Silently he pats Sam’s hand and goes back to playing with his food.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, savoring the feeling of Cas's light covering of stubble raking across his skin. Cas's lips were gentle at first, kissing and softly sucking their way down below Dean's collar. He started his journey back up to Dean's jaw, nibbling the soft flesh. This time, Dean's hands found their way to Cas's hips, pulling them together tightly.
Dean stammered, squeezing his eyes shut to regain focus, before locking them on Cas's bright blue stare. "I think that if you're going to do any talking, I'd rather it be the dirty kind at the moment."
"Yeah it seems nobody mentioned to him I like to strip down in the office on Friday mornings and he walked right in. Good times for the whole office." Dean wasn't going to make this into anything more than it was, shaking the image of bright blue eyes going wide out of his mind.
Trust me. Just go say something. I need to sign on you getting fired anyway if things go south, so don't worry about." She winked at him, stepping aside to let him out of the booth.
A few hours later, they realized they were maybe getting too old for trying to go drink for drink. Especially on a Monday night.
Was his reply, and she smiled to herself. Sam could always make Dean feel better.
"Well, Mr. Winchester, don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything, anything at all, I can do for you." Cas said, turning and strolling back to his desk.
Dean reached out and pulled Cas quickly into him, pressing their lips together hard for just a moment. "I guess I should have come up with a Plan C, huh?" He mused. Pausing for a moment to think, he placed a quick peck on Cas's cheek. "Let's get us dry, alright?"
"CAS" Charlie's voice broke through his ramble, "Hey man, slow down. I'll be at your place in twenty."
"Oh stop it," Charlie said, shooting him a glare ,"not every guy is out to break your heart. Besides, who is to say a pretty little lady sitting out there couldn't do the same?" She waggled her eyebrows and smirked.
Cas's eyes narrowed briefly, detecting the note of sadness. "Well, I think that all the while I have been traveling to find a place that best suits me. I'd like to find a place that means a little more than just a secretary job, but that hasn't happened yet. But I can assure you, Mr. Winchester, I have no intentions of leaving any time soon. I take my job seriously, and I want to do everything I can to help make yours easier."
was too much to say out loud.
"What? No oh my god no! Why would you- he's my boss!" Cas supplied, Balthazar's expression unchanging. Cas gave an exasperated sigh and turned his attention back to his laptop. He wasn't going to let this phase him. At least not while he was still at work.
Dean keeps his hands on Cas’s collar, still refusing to let go as he searches the Angel’s eyes. The same pure joy is etched into his face as the last time Dean saw him, but there is some fear creeping in around the edges the longer Dean stares.
Cas fell apart. Dean smirked against the man's neck, alternating between nibbling, sucking, and moaning himself, while Cas's hands searched for something to hold onto. He was biting his lip to hold back soft whimpers, and so instead they were coming out as low moans in his throat. They should stop, Dean knew, but this was too good, and he was enthralled in the way he had Cas squirming in his hands.
With a grumble he hauled himself off the couch and headed to the fridge for another beer, trying to determine whose face he wanted to mindlessly watch for the next couple hours. He was leaning towards anyone with blue eyes.
"Jesus, man, what the hell!" Dean yelped, using the wadded up shirt to cover his torso.
A slew of employees followed them down to Tasting, where Sam met Balthazar, enthusiastic and flirty as ever, and he began to set up his tasting. Dean, Charlie, and Gabe hung at the back, eager to watch Sam spew all his newfound knowledge. Out of habit, Dean turned to whisper something to Cas, and felt a sharp pang in his chest when he realized he wasn't there. Charlie caught his expression, gently taking his hand.
Sam began a long winded explanation of this coffee and what made it so unique. Dean loved how passionate Sam was about these things, and he appreciated all of the work Sam put in, but he liked the
The fear bleeds away and Cas is pulling Dean to him again, his face settling back into place against Dean’s neck, and Dean feels himself smiling, really smiling, for the first time as his happiness blooms.
They were pulled from their conversation by Cas clearing his throat, walking toward them with Dean's phone showing Sam waving enthusiastically. "I gotta go guys, I'll talk to the guys over here and get more product up there by next week! Love ya'll!" Sam disconnected before anyone could respond.
Cas sighed, shaking his head. He was in no place to be even thinking about relationships, he was new here, and he knew all of like, six people. If he wanted to stay here, which he thought he might, he couldn't go sleeping around the office.
"Well, Mr. Winchester, don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything, anything at all, I can do for you." Cas supplied, maintaining his smug smile all the way back to his desk. He plopped down, sipping at his coffee before starting to make it look like he was doing some important work while he waited for Dean to return to his office.
It worked, apparently, because Dean's face contorted into something a little sad while being simultaneously grateful. He looked around then, scanning the restaurant, then shook his head.
"I'll see you soon, Dean."
Sam ducked his head, and Dean was sure they were both equally unsure how to start. "I just want to make sure you're okay, man." Sam said, lifting his eyes back to Dean's.
unless Dean could compensate him for keeping his mouth shut. He had been heartbroken, this wasn't the man he had fallen for. But after losing his partner, he couldn't bear to lose his company, his friends. And so he caved, giving Benny the money he asked for, and Benny had kept his word. It had been months and now Dean was prepared to deal with the consequences should he decide to go back on his end of the deal, but until then, he had go just hope for the best.
"Uh, I guess you could say that." Cas shifted his weight back and forth between feet, looking down, "Did Charlie not mention that part of my resume?"
she had said,
The room was silent for a moment, save for some quiet slurping, as they enjoyed the afternoon snack. It was Cas who finally broke the silence.
And of course, there was Castiel.
Why did Dean still have his number?
He let his mind slide slowly through the events of the day before, fast forwarding through his awkward encounter with his boss, and slowing down to appreciate the lighting and giddy feeling of their conversation later in the afternoon, smiling to himself. He got to the point where Aaron was giving him the details of the information leak scandal, and tripped up a little bit.
Never again, he thought. No more getting close to his employees. No more blabbing his mouth off late at night after one too many beers. He wasn't going to put everything he had worked for at risk, not ever again.
he thinks after a moment,
"Well," Sam began, "usually that's on the tasting team as they spend so much time really getting to know each blend. But I think this one is special, and if I have a say I'd like it to have something to do with where the beans are grown. This place really is like a little Eden hidden in the mountains."
"I'm free almost any night of the week." Cas rumbled at him, slowly reaching out to touch Dean's arm. Apparently he couldn't read the signs at all.
The week progressed… frustratingly. Cas liked the idea of surprising Dean and dominating the experience, but it was all the
Dean went for his neck, and now, exposed chest, sucking and biting harder in places Cas's shirt would cover. He stroked them both slowly at first, but as Cas began to crumble again, he sped up. Cas was no longer trying to stifle his noises of pleasure, he hands finding purchase on Dean's hips. Dean could feel himself getting close, and judging by the way Cas was beginning to shake, so was he. He pulled back, giving himself room to watch as Cas fell apart in his hands.
Some say Seattle has little to offer outside of the business market, the atmosphere dull and depressing, but Cas saw something different. Sure the place lacked a few days of sunshine, but he found the frequent cloud cover buzzed with not only the electricity of impending storms, but that of anticipation. He could feel it under his skin the moment he stepped out onto the sidewalk. This was a place without the dizzying nonstop lifestyle of New York, but the same sense of awe and excitement.
"Let me get us some coffee." Dean suggested softly, quickly brushing his hand over Cas's in hopes of comforting the man a little. It was beginning to make Dean equally as nervous.
. He couldn't afford what this getting serious, going public, would do to his career. If that meant taking a potential relationship off the table, then so be it.
Cas was still trying to get himself on board with whatever it was that he and Dean had going. They're conversation over lunch had him leaning toward something with the potential to become more serious, but the way Dean acted afterward, in front of Charlie and Sam, made Cas feel like maybe this was something better kept quiet. Mixed signals aside, Cas was one hundred percent sure he wanted Dean either way.
Cas's rumbling voice reached his ears, and the confidence he had faltered. He was afraid to meet the guys eyes, afraid he would devour him right here in front of his whole office staff. So instead, he cleared his throat to signal his arrival and raised his beer at everyone to say hello.
And so that is where Cas found himself this Saturday. Settled on his little loveseat, letting the rain scented breeze blow in through the window, smiling to himself as he looked around the studio. It seemed different from other places he had lived, but not in a bad way.
Cas cocked his head to the side and squinted at him then, as if trying to see through Dean's play. He leaned in ever so slightly, and Dean froze, eyes going wide, frantic. Cas's arm reached up slowly and Dean felt like his heart would burst through his chest. They were alone and out of eyeshot of the rest of the floor, but someone could come over at any moment and-
Still stunned, Cas reached over to grab Dean's fidgeting hands, and only then did he look up to meet Cas's gaze.
And then they stayed in Seattle, with their business-made family and the little life they settled into, together.
It hadn't occurred to Dean that having fun might be a two player game.
A few more shaky breaths and he feels like he can pull himself back together again. For now, at least, until they get back to the bunker and he can lock himself away.
Mr. Winchester turned back to him then, and let out a laugh of his own, forcing Cas's eyes back to his boss. Cas let out an apprehensive chuckle of his own. This was good, right?
Cas exhaled, wanting to squeeze his eyes shut as his heart just about burst from his chest, but as he was still driving he simply smiled, running a hand through his hair. "This is the first time I've wanted more than anything to stay." he said, unable to keep the smile from his voice.
Dean had ordered the classic wings with a side of their famous Phoenix Ash hot sauce, which he made Cas promise to try, while Cas ordered some parmesan chili garlic wings for himself. From there, Dean was surprised, they fell into easy conversation. Dean brought the topic back to Cas's history of travel, which sent Cas on a storytelling spree of his adventures. It was easy to see the guy was passionate about being able to have his freedom, and Dean couldn't help but smile at the way he spoke about each new place with such detail. He reminded him a bit of Sam. Distantly, he noted he would love for them to meet.
He smiled, swooping in for a quick kiss before sitting back. "Sorry" he mumbled, "I couldn't resist."
As Balthazar leaned across Cas to open the door, he whispered, "Dean didn't want the media to know he was sleeping with the guy that had sold his company secrets."
Convinced his cheeks were red enough to attract attention, he excused himself for fresh air. He rounded the corner outside, making sure to get out of sight range before exhaling and scrubbing his hand over his face. What was he doing? This was exactly the thing he had been trying to avoid. And with the first damn guy to come into his life after Benny? He was being an idiot.
“Castiel?” A vaguely familiar voice asked from the doorway. As he looked up, a faint smile of recognition played across the redhead’s features.
"Cas," he breathed, unsure of what he was even asking.
He cleared his through, bringing his voice back down to his usual gravely rumble, "No, uh, yes. I ate already." He gestured uselessly towards his desk, where an unopened bag of chips still sat. Whatever.
Thank you guys for being so incredibly patient and supportive of all this! I'm working towards an ending, promise, I've just always been bad at conclusions so it's slow going. Here's this to hold you over until I get more that I feel good about! xo
The staring contest incident at lunch the day before had been… something. Dean had gotten lost in his head, and those eyes, and wanted to know more about the man they belonged to. He had spent the entire second half of his day yesterday distracted, and he knew he just needed someone quick to sleep with to ease the tension, but at the same time, he didn't want it gone. There was something almost electric between them; the waitress had seen it yesterday, and it seemed that Balthazar was catching on, too. Was it something to pursue, or something to put an end to?
"I'll see you tomorrow, Dean" Cas said, and Dean's heart did a little skip.
"That has nothing to do with it" he mumbled, casting his eyes down to the folder labeled
Cas was beginning to feel the lazy smile that came before his buzz started to hit, and noted that he probably should have eaten a little more at lunch. As he returned to the table with his second drink, he heard a round of hoots coming from behind him, and turned to see Dean and Charlie strolling into the bar. Cas watched as Dean's eyes scanned the room before locking onto to his own, apparently finding what they had been searching for. He felt Balthazar squeeze his arm, having seen it too, and he smiled, shifting his gaze to Charlie. She waved before dragging Dean to the bar, giving Cas the opportunity to consult Balthazar on what to do next.
"Yes, if you will have me, yes. I want to talk about things and… I want to keep doing this, with you."
"Mornin," Dean smiled, "Ready for the weekend? Hopefully this sunshine will hold out!"
He had barely brought his gaze back to Dean's when the man surged forward and pressed their lips together. Cas unlaced their fingers and brought his other hand up to cup Dean's other cheek, Dean's arms finding their way around his waist. The kiss was slow, and soft, and… wet.
Dean chuckled, running his hand through his hair before turning to Cas. "You're right, definitely inappropriate, but not unwelcome." He raised his eyebrows in question, trying to figure out where this was going.
assistant thing, maybe he was more accustomed to some tiny little thing in a short skirt taking up residence outside his office, maybe he didn't like not having the eye candy, the options…
The idea thrilled him.
part more than the research. What held his attention was how intently Cas was listening in, his brows furrowed ever so slightly, his lips parted as if a question was waiting just on the tip of his tongue. More than once Charlie playfully kicked his foot when he had been staring for too long. He couldn't help it, the guy was kind of adorable, but he would never admit that.
Cas could hear the mumble of voices on the other side of the door and hesitated. He'd take any excuse for a few more minutes to figure out what he was even going to say. He fidgeted, biting his lip and flexing his fist before finally taking a deep breath and knocking.
Dean followed eagerly, toeing off his shoes and pulling at his shirt buttons while he walked.
Shaking his head, Dean lowered himself on the couch next to Cas, "You're wrong. I thought I loved him, but the man I thought I loved wasn't real. He was playing a role and I couldn't see it. I was stupid and over eager and I thought…" he began wringing his hands, taking a shaky breath before he continued, "Cas I thought I knew what that feeling was but I didn't. Not until I met you."
"I appreciate your input Cas," he had said, just loud enough that anyone pretending not to listen could hear it, "I'll think it over and I'll get back to you before the end of the week." Dean had caught his eye and winked at him then, before wishing him a safe home.
"Well… I mean yeah essentially. Secretary, personal assistant, that's basically the same!" Cas opens his mouth to speak but she cuts him off. "Okay you just had so much experience! And Mr. Winchester needs someone like you. He needs someone who knows what he's doing, and out of all the people I have interviewed you were the only one who seemed genuinely interested in the position and the company. It doesn't seem like this is just a job to you… it's skill and it's a hobby and you enjoy it. That's what De- uh, Mr. Winchester needs."
"God I love the way that sounds," he laughed, his own voice coming out raspy, still clutching the collar of Cas's shirt. He noted it had become slightly untucked, and wondered if he also looked so disheveled. Cas pulled back far enough to meet his eyes, searching them for where Dean might want to go from here. Before he could say anything, the door swung open, and they jumped apart, turning to the sinks to tidy themselves up while Dean silently prayed it wasn't someone from work. Luckily, the stranger only hesitated a moment, narrowing his eyes at them before carrying on.
It was Dean's turn to glare now, the only way he could think to handle his discomfort with this topic, even if nobody else was around to hear the conversation.
Cas was falling for this guy, his own boss, and nothing could stop him. The little routines they had worked out together, the way they moved with and around each other like a practiced dance, the way they fell into such a fluid rhythm. Cas often found himself dumbfounded that he could be so lucky.
They had chatted briefly on the walk over, Dean pointing things out to Cas along the way, including the nearest Winchester Roasters café to the office and apparently, Cas's apartment. It happened to be the one Dean frequented on the weekends, or times when he needed to get work done outside of the office environment. He'd spent many hours there when sitting at his desk proved to be a little too painful to get any work done.
"Mr. Winchester," Cas greeted him with a smirk, "I would hate for you to be away from your desk any more often than necessary. If you need me to bring you in more coffee I would be glad to do it."
After a quick rinse, he exchanged running clothes for business attire, and made his way out to the floor brewing station. As he fixed himself a cup of coffee, a cheerful voice called to him. "Hello boss!" Dean turned to see Balthazar striding toward him, his face split by its usual grin.
The interview went smoothly, as Cas had been through the process many times. It certainly helped that he and Charlie had already become friendly, giving the situation a lighter atmosphere. She questioned his extensive experience, asking why so many jobs rather than something stable. He was used to this question, fully aware that his resume made him look like a flight risk. Fortunately, he knew a little something about schmoozing through it, his lopsided grin and bright blue eyes helping to clear any worry from his interviewers mind. Cas was a people person when he was working, talking to people was quite literally part of his job. Outside of professional relationships was a different story. And, he reassured himself, if this place didn't work out, there was always another opportunity just ahead. He would be itching to travel somewhere new soon anyway.
He thought about what to say to Dean, if he decided to talk to him again. He knew he would, it was childish to just disappear like this, but he needed time. After this past month or so he had really started to feel something for the man, started to think about Seattle being more permanent, about
Cas felt like he was in heaven. Cloud nine, living in a dream, all that. The more time he spent with Dean, the more he felt like they had known each other for years. It was just
They're all pretty friendly in this office, and when this whole incident went down, that had been Dean's biggest regret. Benny had been playing them all, flashing his smile and charming everyone with his heavy New Orleans accent. Nobody had suspected he was here for information, to turn around and betray the team that had grown to love him. The media flashed a story of loose lips in the break room, some chatter amongst employees that got into the hands of some no good people, but nobody knew the real story. Nobody knew just how close he had become with his personal assistant, or just how much Dean might spill to someone he thought he could trust. Someone he thought his was falling for. Or at least, he thought nobody knew. Again, it seems he was too easy to read within his own office. He scrubbed his hand over his face with a groan, thankful that his remaining employees respected him enough to keep his personal life out of this.
"That is perfectly fine with me, Dean." He said with a smile, slowing down as they approached his door.
"I'm not a huge fan of heights, but if you want…" Dean mumbled, eyes wide as he stared at the building almost shrouded by clouds.
"Can I take you out to lunch?" Cas's eyes snapped up again, wide as he saw Dean mindlessly straightening papers on his desk rather than looking at him. "As a like, welcome to the team kinda thing. Obviously. Since you're new. I guess that's obvious too." Dean's cheeks were flushing almost as quickly as Cas's.
Having been so hyper focused on work since lunch, he had gotten done earlier than usual, and figured he would see if he could leave the couple minutes early. Cas had emailed Dean over a copy of his schedule for tomorrow and an overview of the next week, sent him a reminder to follow up with Sam before the weekend came, and set up the paperwork he would need to look over in the morning. He packed up his things and, with a deep breath, went and knocked on the office door.
"So, uh, what's up?" She asked, her voice quiet as her eyes glanced over her shoulder at Cas.
However, as they headed to the bar, his confidence faltered. Like last week, Dean had waved to them as they were leaving, seemingly busy with some paperwork Cas had not given him. Cas worried that maybe his little display earlier in the day had scared him off, more of the playful from a distance type than Cas and Balthazar had realized. Balthazar had ordered Cas a hard cider, not wanting a repeat of what happened last week, and before they knew it they had settled into lazy conversation. Aaron made an appearance again, waving them over to chat with him and Gabriel. Cas noted that he hadn't seen Charlie yet.
Very wet, suddenly, as the skies opened up above them with the storm they had been holding back all day. The kiss broke with a yelp from both of them as they uselessly tried to shield themselves with their arms. Drenched in seconds, they sprinted for coverage under a cluster of trees. It didn't help much, but it allowed them to pause and erupt in laughter. Cas reveled at the way Dean's eyes bunched together in the corners, his head tossing back as he ran a hand through his damp hair. Cas thought briefly he would like to make Dean laugh like that.
It was well past midnight, but Dean was wide awake. When he had gotten back to his apartment, he popped open a beer and sat in the dark at his kitchen table, mulling the evenings events over in his head. Going into this, he had planned for something to snap between him and Cas, but he never thought it actually
"Oh." was all he said. Well, it had been worth a shot to apply.
Cas smiled, appreciative of the small caring gesture, "I don't want to take over your whole weekend, Dean. I should go."
The paranoia in his gut reached full strength and he realized he was more worried about losing Cas than the world finding out his deep dark secrets. He hadn't explained anything to Cas at all, and now he was walking away and clearly didn't want anything to do with Dean anymore.
"So, Charlie says Mr. Winchester isn't always so stern. Is it just me or is there more to this?"
"Uh, so if you want take a shower or I can lend you some dry clothes…" he wasn't sure what Cas would want.
While Dean spoke, Charlie shot a quick message to Sam.
But there was just the one thing still whispering at the back of Cas's mind after these couple months.
"You better make a move before he decides to bolt," she said bluntly, and Cas's eyes widened in shock.
One hand still clasped around Dean's wrists, the other reaching back behind him, Cas began to roll his hips forward to rub himself along Dean's quickly hardening length. There were nights that Dean loved to be in control, but this wasn’t one of them, and Cas was relieved. He paused in his movements for only a second to fish around the bed for lube, before returning his attention to Dean.
Dean cleared his throat, "Hey, it's cool. I just, um… I don't know. I want to talk to you. I need to talk to you. I'm sorry I got out of hand, you didn't deserve that and I'm just sorry."
Cas feels his face flush, but he lets out a laugh, trying not to let the embarrassment get to him. "Yes I suppose you're right, but I wouldn't mind seeing some more" he raised an eyebrow, playing into the joke. Might as well.
"Dean" Cas cut in, "I would love for you to cook for me. I'm not so great myself, maybe you can even give me a few pointers." He met Dean's eyes with a smile, and Dean beamed right back.
"Wha- what're you, oh- Cas, what- " Dean tried, cut off by Cas's lips catching his. Cas could feel that he was a little tense, unsure what was happening, but he wasn't fighting it.
Charlie nudged at Dean's elbow as they lounged together, sharing a plate of fries. Years ago Charlie had started the French Fryday tradition, which had encouraged Dean to start his Friday morning running routine. Maybe it was counter productive, whatever, they had fun.
Cas had come to Seattle after a position with a company he felt a particular reliance on. Winchester Roasters had fueled many of his long days behind a desk, giving his fingers the will power to challenge his own words per minute records, his hands the energy to pick up the phone before the second ring, and his eyes crystal clear blue to take in anything - or anyone- he might find of interest around his newest office venture. Company headquarters had been in the news for a scandal involving the leak of trade secrets, leading to the job loss of several lower rung employees who thought what they heard in the break rooms could never be tied back to them. And so, opportunity called Cas to the Pacific North West.
"I'm glad too." Cas said after a moment, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "I'm still getting used to Seattle, but I feel like I could see myself here more long term. It's not quite New York, but in a good way. Like there's always something happening here, but it's not as urgent as other cities." He shrugged then, looking back down at his wings. "Either that or the lack of sun is getting to my head."
And Mr. Winchester continued right into his office, door closing with a click behind him.
Dean groaned. Of course she would tell him. "Oh, yeah. Castiel. He's only been here about a week, but so far so good. Doesn't seem like he's here to screw us over, at least." He forced a smile, hoping Sam would understand he didn't want to conversation to go there.
He stepped back, turning to make a break for the door, slipping from Dean's hands.
"Hey man! I was wondering if you were going to come up here. What can I get for you?" He smiled at Castiel as he spoke and Cas noticed the cheery attitude was a little contagious.
"I, uh.." Cas struggled to figure out what to do. "I don't feel very good all of a sudden."
, he'd told Cas.
as Charlie had called him.
Cas beamed at him, pulling the door shut and locking it behind him. "Are we traveling by foot or would you like me to drive?" He responded, and Dean's mind flashed to long drives with the windows down, Cas behind the wheel.
Already having exchanged a few emails and phone calls with the HQ hiring manager, he made his way from his rental studio to the office building for a face to face interview. If this didn’t work out, he was confident he could find something else, but he wasn’t about to pass up the chance for an unlimited supply of the coffee that kept him going day by day. Cas had been frequenting Winchester Roasters since he was in high school, and it was one of the only constants he had as he traveled state to state, town to town. With his odd secretary jobs funding his addiction, there was no better way to bring his passions together.
Oh. Okay.
"Listen, man. I know I came in here like a hard ass on you. I don't want you to think it was personal. You have been doing an excellent job, better than I could have hoped for after having the position empty for those few months, and I don't want you to feel inadequate. So, I'm sorry." He maintained his gaze, smile still on his lips as he waited for Cas to react.
Cas arrives in the Winchester Roasters lobby at five to 8, where Charlie is waiting to show him to his desk and familiarize him with the building. At the front desk he is introduced to Donna, a bubbly blonde woman directing anyone that might walk through the front doors. Around the corner in the security office they say hello to Jody and Alex. At the elevator, Cas meets Adam, the solemn mail room manager waiting to catch a trip downstairs. Charlie seems anxious as the elevator dings at each new floor, and it Cas cocks his head to the side realizing the button for the seventh and topmost floor is highlighted. His experience and job title had always kept him closer to the ground, dealing more in the customer service and paperwork realm than working as a personal assistant. He turns to Charlie as another ding signals their arrival, and she smiles, stepping out ahead of him onto the office floor.
"I still don't like having to wait all day to kiss you," Dean growled, "But damn do you smell good when you walk out of that place."
Dean had turned to look at him, his little brother speaking these words of wisdom, and it dawned on him just how grown up they both had become. He hoped their parents would be proud, despite the mistakes and the setbacks they'd had along the way.
Dean had barely spoken this whole time, distracted by the way Cas was taking it all so seriously. Charlie had been right to pick him for this company. He was passionate in all the right places, he was eager to learn more and share ideas. He really was such a unique find. Dean smiled to himself, all too aware of the parallel between Cas and this 'heavenly' coffee.
he thought.
"Nope, thanks." Dean said, and the call ended.
By Friday morning, Cas had made up his mind to do some light digging, and maybe a little brown nosing. He made sure to get to the office early, nodding a friendly hello to everyone else that had the same idea. While they clustered around the usual tables discussing plans for the weekend- tasting tables, he had learned - Cas wandered to the floor brewing station and began fixing a cup of the piping hot dark roast for Mr. Winchester. It had been a long week, and what better way to start his boss's weekend then with a cup ready for him to get right to work.
"You're such a nerd, you know that?" Dean teased, pushing his sentimentalities back down. "Do you think we'll be able to do some effective business with them?"
“Cas,” he starts, his voice raspy from crying but he pushes on, “I love you, too.”
They are standing in silence when Eileen pulls up, and of course she is perceptive enough to understand this might not be the joyous reunion she was hoping for. Sam mentions going back in the diner to grab her something to eat, leaving Dean to regain his composure.
"Listen, Cas. It's nobody's damn business. I love my team, I really do, but they tend to stick their noses into stuff they don’t understand, and they don’t realize who they can hurt…" Dean trailed off, and Cas had to prevent himself from prying. He had the feeling Dean would tell him on his own terms.
He pulled Cas in the shower with him, exhaling as the steam beat the chill of rain from his shoulders. He let Cas step into his personal space, pushing him back against the shower wall as he moved for Dean's neck. Dean gave in then, releasing all tension from his body and relinquishing control to Cas. As if he could feel it, Cas moved to capture Dean's wrists in one of his hands and raised them above their heads, pinning him to the wall. His free hand on Dean's hip, their bodies slipped together and he continued to explore Dean's upper body with his mouth, sucking small bruises along the man's collar bone before dipping his head farther down. Cas caught one of Dean's nipples between his lips, and Dean began to crumble.
"I don’t know yet, I still have my studio and everything I just… needed some time to think."
Cas had never really been a relationship kind of guy. His traveling life style kind of prevented it. When he lived in places for longer periods of time, he had occasionally had more serious partners, but he always knew he would be moving on and he didn't want to hurt anyone by ending things suddenly. His last more serious partner, Michael, had been nearly two years ago. Since then, he'd been with a guy here and there, but it had been quite some time. With Dean acting the way he was today, Cas was starting to realize that maybe it bad been too long.
Letting his head fall into his hands he let out a groan. He had screwed up big time if what he was realizing now was true, and there was probably even more to it than that. He could understand now why Dean hadn't explained himself, it probably hurt him too much. And with Cas, well, he was doing it all over again. But Cas had no ulterior motives, no secrets, he just wanted Dean. He felt a lump forming in his throat at the thought of never being able to express that to him again. What the hell was he supposed to do now?
His mind continued to over think the rest of the way home, and for the remaining time he sat staring at nothing in particular as he waited for Charlie. She let herself in, immediately going to the fridge and grabbing a couple beers. This conversation would need it.
And then there had been his conversation with Balthazar. Of course, Cas knew the weird eye contact thing wasn't just a weird happenstance. Then, he had mentioned the tension in the office, the way Dean smirked when he said Cas's name, they way he had to know he was toying with him, and that he kind of liked it.
"Hey so anyone up for some coffee? I could go grab some… heard there's a nice little coffee shop around the corner." He winked, all but running out the door.
The tasting process was kind of cool. First they smelled the beans, the first ones roasted just for them. Then the grinds, coarsely ground for a French Press, and then finally, the coffee itself. Sam went over the different notes the coffee had, and how they changed slightly through the brewing process. Slurping the coffee, they discussed the flavor profile, how it felt on the tongue, all the boring stuff people don't think about when they're chugging through 3 cups a day. And finally, the pairing. Much like a wine pairing, all coffees pair with foods that help to accentuate their flavors. In this case, the dark cocoa notes paired beautifully with the chocolate chip muffins. This was Dean's favorite part, and he savored the way the paired combined on his taste buds.
A tentative hand reaches out between them, Sam’s fingers pausing to hover over Dean’s shoulder before shifting down to squeeze his forearm instead.
"I'm still trying to get acquainted with the area, and the office, but I am enjoying the work." Cas replied, his usual rolling thunder voice raised to be heard over the noise of the Friday afternoon crowd.
"What did I do Charlie?" He mumbled, rubbing at his eyes.
"Well…" she said slowly, turning back to him with a hopeful expression, "Balthazar is planning on bringing Cas out for drinks tonight if you think you can drop the big bad CEO persona and want to come along."
Cas blushed, smiling slightly at Charlie's approval, before frowning at the thought that this could be over and it would be on him. "I suppose I'll sleep on it and talk to Dean in the morning."
Afterward, having drank potentially the entire contents of his personal liquor cabinet, he had called Charlie. Sam, in Costa Rica at the time, had made his second trip back to Seattle in that same month the next morning after Charlie had gotten in touch with him. The first trip after the initial leak had been all business, and Dean had done all he could to steer the rumors away from Benny and toward 'a group of interns' in hopes of preventing Benny coming forward. The second trip was for a near incoherent Dean to explain everything to his little brother, in hopes of finding a solution. It was Sam who told him the best plan of action was to keep moving forward and hope for the best. Months later, and Charlie and Sam were the only people who knew the real story.
"Later." He mumbled into Dean's neck, reaching behind him to turn the shower off. "Come on, where are towels?"
he thought, turning his gaze to his awakening computer screen. Seconds later, his door opened and shut, and be looked up to see Charlie glaring, arms crossed over her chest.
He had gone out for drinks with the team Friday afternoon as usual, trying his best not to stare (more like gawk) at Castiel every chance he got. The guy was reverberating confidence, happiness even, his usual furrowed brow replaced with a soft smile for the whole evening. Dean managed to coax him outside to steal a few kisses. Dean wanted more, to take him home, to leave everyone else, but he was going to be patient with this one.
, he just wasn't entirely sure it was a good idea. Was this moving too fast? Wasn't that part of the fun? What about all the people who definitely saw Cas walk in here just a few minutes ago?
"Nah, not me. There's a whole coast right here full of cities with… opportunity." He flashed Dean a grin then, causing his stomach to churn with a little bit of butterflies and a little bit of disgust. His gut told him to drop the bartender a twenty and haul ass back to his hotel, back to Seattle even. But at the same time, the familiarity of sitting next to Benny at a bar, his subtle smell, the way his voice rumbled in Dean's chest… he didn't want it to go away.
He smiled back, "Can I get a, uh, vanilla latte?" it had been a long time since he'd treated himself to something other than Winchester brand coffee.
He didn't bother closing the door, but instead pulled Cas in and then pressed him up against it. Resuming his grinding, he began to undo the buttons on Cas's shirt, eliciting a quick inhale from the man before he followed suit. Dean kissed him long and slow now, matching the pace at which their bodies moved together, trying to work Cas back up to the wriggling mess he had been just a minute ago. He reached down then, pulling at Cas's belt, undoing his pants and pushing his hand in to wrap around him. Cas let a soft whimper escape from between their lips, his own hands searching for Dean's waist, but Dean swatted him away. He undid his own pants as he continued to stroke Cas slowly, then, pushing himself closer, took both of them into his hand. He grinned as Cas broke their kiss to let out another low moan, his head thudding back against the door.
Cas made a mental note that Dean was maybe a little apprehensive about being intimate with a man, despite what Cas knew about his past. He wouldn't question it, but would happily reassure and guide Dean if needed.
He knocked, waiting just a second to hear Dean's reply, and walked in.
Cas sighed, knowing exactly how Dean was feeling. "Do you need to call an Uber home? I could invite you inside while you wait…" he said with a smirk, raising an eyebrow suggestively.
He smirked, mostly annoyed that she knew him as well as she did, but also happy at the thought of being happy. And maybe a little at seeing Cas in casual clothes, too.
"Hey, mind if I walk with you?" Dean asked. They could figure it out on the way.
He heard her moving away from the noise of the bar during happy hour as soon as she processed the serious tone of his voice, and then he told her everything. How Balthazar and Aaron had spilled the big secret to him when he first started working there, and how he hadn't really cared until Dean came into the picture, and Dean and never brought it up and now Benny was texting him and Dean was still sleeping with him and he was so stupid to ever--
"Dean" he began, clearing his throat as he sat down, "Dean, I know you loved him."
"Fine now, I think I just needed some sleep. Long week, I guess." Dean noticed Cas was looking down at his hands now, fiddling nervously.
He quickly typed out a reply to Balthazar and went back to his book. Ironically, the rain had followed him down the coast, as if tell him he couldn't just run away from this. He was parked along the water, curled up in the passenger seat with the window cracked listening to the waves and the soft beat of rain on the car. He thought about the way the rain sounded through Dean's windows at night.
