They torture him, but they don’t even ask him anything. They don’t want to know anything he can tell them. He figures that all they want to know is already written in his blood.
Steve came to the penthouse late at night. Tony was surprised by the visit, because Steve had been avoiding him since he’d gotten back from D.C.
“Who, Barnes?” Tony tries to sound genuinely curious.
“Steve—”
Steve clasps a hand against Tony’s mouth. He can’t make a sound, and he doesn’t know what Steve is up to, but he’s not scared. Steve’s end of the bond is cool and determined, with nothing threatening for Tony.
“He said to call me? Just that?” Nat asks.
And then,
“St—”
“So,” Tony starts again when he’s calmed down, “I’m assuming your answer to my question is
“Yeah, but... well. I guess people are divided on the issue. Some blame me, some blame you… but to a lot of folks you’re still Captain America, you know. It’s not something you can shake easily, that level of respect.”
“It’s… complicated. But, yeah. I suppose I did.”
“You think you’ll be able to sleep?” Steve asks later, when they’re settling into bed for the night. It’s still early, but maybe Steve wants this day to be over as soon as possible, so the next can start. He’s not a patient person, after all.
“Tony, I forgive you.”
. Then Tony would touch Steve, or suck him off, or lay there under him while Steve braces with one arm next to Tony’s head and jerks off, staring into Tony’s eyes, coming all over his lap, on his soft dick. Sometimes, he would even lick it clean, and Tony would shudder and whine, because it’s too much. They go to the bathroom after that, clean up properly, and then they go to bed.
Tony closes his eyes against the empty room, touches the wrinkled part of his t-shirt. It’s warmer than the rest.
He’s about to speak, but Tony puts his extended forefinger on his pursed lips, says, “Shhh,” and Steve doesn’t talk.
“Can you say it? I’m sorry, I need… I need to hear you say it.”
“Yeah, that was smart.”
To keep his mind and hands occupied, Steve starts packing and straightening up the bedroom, so they won’t have to do it in a rush later. He doesn’t have many things, and he’s been his usual tidy self during their stay here, so his stuff isn’t scattered all around like Tony’s. Still, he separates his things from Tony’s, folds some of Tony’s clothes that still look and smell clean, lines up his canvas shoes against the wall.
“What do you want?” She grumbled, arms crossing over her chest. He scoffed.
“Thought you were Bucky.” She muttered, grabbing the blonde’s shield and moving it to the cupboard. It was more so she wouldn’t trip over it as she’d done a hundred times before.
“I’m yours Buck, forever and always I’m yours.” She whispered. Chuckling softly, he brushed the tears from her face.
Unlocking the door to the flat she shared with her two best friends, she groaned at the mess. For two super soldiers, they sure knew how to create a mess. Steve Rogers, the famous Captain America, was currently away on a mission but Bucky was still here having not been needed for this particular mission.
“Well, well, well look what the cat dragged in” Mouthing a ‘fuck’ into her drink she turned to see Nathan.
Tony reached for the bottle with shaky hands, not bothering to wipe his mess-of-a-face off. Steve handed him the bottle with a soft smile, “Here you go.”
"You okay?" Steve asked him softly once Tony seemed to be settled, head lying against his chest. When his hand went up to play with Tony's hair, it was almost instinctual, and the pleased grunt he received in response let him know the action was appreciated, "Ready for bed?"
He'd just made it blatantly obvious that it was because of Steve's presence, but he didn't care. He'd rather Steve knew he was hiding something than know
about to get it. The point where he knew didn’t have a way out, no matter how much he talked.
“Nothing,” Steve told her calmly, making sure to keep any and all defensiveness out of his voice. He definitely didn't enjoy the third degree that he was getting, but he could understand why she was so overprotective. If he was in her position, he would probably be ten times worse. He hardly even knew Tony but by then, he felt like he could kill for him if necessary. Deep down, he couldn’t help but be scared of how protective of him he’d be if he actually could claim him.
. Tony figured maybe that was what made him such a shitty submissive in the first place.
behaving like one,” Pepper seemed unbothered by Anthony’s attitude as she continued, matching his glare tenfold, “It wasn’t put in place for no reason, Tony. When you don’t eat or sleep and then lie to me about it,
Suddenly, Tony shifted again but this time so he was gazing up at the Dominant. Steve ignored it for a second, figuring it would pass after Tony found whatever it was he was looking for. When a few moments passed and it didn't, he couldn't help but chuckle as he finally looked down to meet his eyes, "May I help you?"
expected to get away with it.
!” Tony argued pitifully into Steve’s neck, beginning to cry again. That was his argument and he clearly was going to stick to it, Steve realized, logic be damned.
Tony just pouted harder, so Steve continued with something he knew Tony would like a little better, “If you behave yourself and drink some water, I’ll hold you again and help you fall asleep. But, that’s
"You are good," she corrected without missing a beat, smiling brightly at him, "I love you, baby boy."
Tony was too wrapped up in the comfort and his headspace to realize what Pepper was witnessing completely contradicted everything he'd told her about his feelings towards Steve. Hell, it completely contradicted everything he'd told
Steve chuckled at the Submissive, shifting just enough to reach in his pocket and pull out his phone. Honestly, he was just as thrilled as Tony was. The Sub looked the happiest he'd ever seen him, and Steve wanted him to be happy.
to feel like that, Anthony.”
Tentatively, Tony peaked over at Steve who'd perched himself on the edge of the couch once he finished with the submissive's shoes. He was trying to search for any sign that this isn't what
“Aht-aht,” he reprimanded softly, gently moving Tony back to his original position. When the boy whined and pouted up at him, he just gave him a look, “Bedtime means no more watching movies. Do we need to turn it off?”
, of all people, because he was borderline perfect.
Tony wasn’t all the way…back, yet. He’d only slept a few hours and he wasn’t all the way out of his space just yet. This diluted his anger just enough for him not to immediately shoot out of bed, find the big behemoth, and give him a piece of his mind. He still wanted to; he just didn’t quite have the energy.
This wasn't news to Steve. He
With the number of tears Tony managed to shed over the last few hours, Steve figured he needed to get him to rehydrate before he fell asleep. Once he did that and got the tears to stop, then it would be lights out.
She smiled at that, and Peter thought,
“Morgan,” she replied, and Peter smiled.
“Baby?” Ned whispered, breaking the silence. “Come back to bed.”
“Ready?”
“Yeah! If I’m honest, I kinda like Hailey better,” she said conversationally. “You’re right, Morgan is a boy name. But Daddy’s nickname for me is Maguna, which is better than Hailey, so I guess its all even.” She looked at him for a second and shrugged. “No offense.”
In reality, when Tony’s mind was quiet and he looked at Steve’s eyes and hair and nose and face and hands, the first thought that would pop into his mind is,
“Yeah,” he said, kissing her head. “Morgan Hailey Stark.”
The urge to role his eyes was overwhelming, but he bit it down. “No, they aren’t. Mine aren’t as black. I feel like your eyes are going to swallow me whole.”
A part of Peter melted at the nickname. He could feel the fight drain out of him.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he mumbled.
“Love…”
“You okay?” Ned asked.
Peter didn’t jump at the noise- he heard Ned waking up from their bed and looking for him about ten minutes ago. He kept his face on the cool glass of the window when he replied. “Yeah?”
He adjusted his grip on her to make sure her head was supported, but in doing so, she scrunched up her face and opened her eyes. Dark, intelligent orbs that looked so similar to ones he’s definitely seen before, on a mischievous, curly-haired boy.
Ned didn’t seem to buy it.
When Steve gets hurt on a mission and he isn’t waking up, Tony holds his hand and rubs his thumb into his palm and silently silently chants,
Sometimes, when they’re laying in their bed on a quiet night, tangled together in a mess of limbs and soft whispers, Tony thinks it so loud he’s scared Steve can hear it.
or just
time, Ned!”
But bless his soul, he still let it go.
She shook her head. “Let Tony take her. My hands are shaking enough as it is.”
“I’ll feel bad.”
“Peter?”
Peter shrugged and put his head on his knees. “I like it here.”
And then he was carrying her. His daughter. She barely even had any hair, if you could even count the peach fuzz on top of her head as such. And she had a button nose and puckered lips and big eyes, which were closed. She was also kind of sticky, and on any other occasion, Tony might have found that gross.
Ned rolled his eyes, then took a finger to Peter’s eyelids and softly closed them shut.
Ned didn’t reply to that, opting for warming Peter’s unusually cold hands. Every once in a while, he’s place a kiss on Peter’s knuckles, and he’d lift his shoulders up like it tickled. Something lifted in between his chest at the soft gestures, and he let himself relax a little.
Peter laughed, then held on tighter.
There weren’t many occasions where Peter was caught lying, but this was one of them- in less than ten minutes, he was out like a light.
Now? He just took her all in even in her sticky glory.
“You don’t have to.”
“Bed?” Ned breathed, and it was only that they were so close that Peter could hear him.
With shaky hands, he dug in his pockets and pulled out his phone, not bothering to unlock it before lying down and curling up on his side. He was still fully dressed in his party attire, which was a sleek, black suit, but he didn’t care. At the moment, it didn't take much for him to be comfortable. It was just nice to be off of his feet.
“Oh,” Tony breathed out after a moment, crestfallen. Now that he knew she was leaving her actual Submissive to come to him, his excitement was dwindling.
hurt him.
He felt a small pang of fear as he thought about Steve taking advantage of him with nobody there to help, but he looked at the Dom who was still untying his right shoe and the thought left just as quickly as it came. None of the men who'd ever hurt him before had cuddled him on the couch or took his shoes off for him because he didn't have the energy to do it. They definitely hadn't called Pepper for him to help him calm down. If Steve wanted to hurt Tony, he probably would have done it before then. Besides, Jarvis was always watching, whether babysitting protocol was enabled or not. If Tony told the A.I. to get him help, Jarvis would do just that.
do anything that could even be
“Nah, I’ll head in there myself,” she sighed before taking a long drink from her coffee, “I’m sure he’ll be happy to see me.”
This wasn't the time to work on him, though, and when he heard the water shut off abruptly in the bathroom he was reminded of that.
When Steve began to manhandle Tony until he was pushed far back enough for them to make proper eye contact, the submissive tensed in preparation for his response. Steve still didn’t hesitate to grab both of his hands in one of his own, holding in front of him as he almost growled, “You do
do anything, though. Well, besides just up and leave, apparently.
“He’s begun to stir, Madam,” Jarvis informed her dutifully, ever the babysitter, “Would you like me to inform him of your arrival?”
That was the answer Pepper seemed to be expecting and she quickly gave a short nod in response, "Alright, sweetheart. That's fine."
"C'mere," he spoke softly, opening his posture and softening his features. Tony stayed in the doorway of the bathroom for a moment, seeming to weigh his options. His eyes darted around a little before landing on the cell phone lying next to Steve on the couch. It must have been what he was looking for, because once he spotted it, he slowly began to shuffle his feet towards Steve.
Fortunately, he didn’t seem to have an argument to that and just closed his eyes with a huff. Steve was thankful – he was ready for some shut-eye his self, by then. If Tony was finally going to give it up, they could both rest for a while.
.  Stupid Steve fucking sucked and he never wanted to see him again, but he was just...expecting him. Who cuddles someone to sleep and then just wakes up and leaves? It was an asshole move, in Tony's opinion, but he wasn't about to tell Pepper he was feeling this way. That would only make things worse.
Tony's heart swelled without his permission. Steve had barely even done anything, but the slightest, gentle and caring gestures were sending Tony head over heels for this stupid man he'd been running from and he could hardly even help himself. He was so far down he found himself wondering what the hell he was so afraid of.
“Yessir!” Tony didn’t hesitate to cry, nodding vigorously against his pillow, “I’ll never do it again!”
"Yeah, he does that when it's been a while," she sighed out, her tired eyes now focused on something off-screen, "I'm not there to help him and he refuses to ask Rhodey, so he was trying to hold out until I got back. I’m guessing you soiled that plan for him.”
He obviously wasn’t picky about his face either. From what Steve could tell so far, it was just his chest he didn’t want messed with. Steve figured that was easy enough to abide by as he made quick work of cleaning off his face. He had to bite back a laugh when Tony’s face scrunched up in distaste, much like a toddler. It was funny, but he didn’t want Tony to think he was teasing. Not that his eyes were open to pay attention, anyway.
Domme.
Tony was fairly comfortable in the fact that Pepper wouldn't be upset with him for not being able to get himself to bed. He just needed help. Pepper wouldn't be mad about that.
"It's alright," his deep voice comforted, his chest rumbling under Tony. Looking in his eyes and hearing him speak like that again made Tony want to melt. He didn't know what it was, but Steve made him feel safe. He made him feel like it was, indeed, alright, "Go on and get ready for bed. When you've done that, I promise you will get the phone back, okay?"
“I know you don’t like it, Anthony,” he comforted quietly over his tears, understanding, “I’m sorry, but you
Tony didn't really want to choose. Not because he didn't know what he wanted, because he did. He just wasn't sure if there was a right answer or not, and he wanted to upset neither Pepper nor Steve. Pepper usually made his choices for him when he was this far down and he preferred it that way.
Before he could decide if he was annoyed with the way she'd threatened him or amused by her mama-bear-like protective nature, the familiar British voice rang out throughout Tony's living room (Steve wasn't sure if the enormous open space he was in that connected to a kitchen and dining room area could be considered a living room, but that was his best guess), interrupting his thoughts. "Excuse me, sir?"
behave himself for Steve, as much as he was regretting it, but he was still pretty pissed at him for making him drop in the first place. He'd been
It was pitiful. Steve actually had to refrain from cooing at the submissive, but it didn’t take a genius to know that wouldn’t help. Instead, he began rocking them back and forth, shushing the distraught sub as he did so.
just take a trip over Steve’s knee. However, Steve did note that when he first went to move Tony, he tensed up and became visibly scared. He wasn’t sure if he was expecting a spanking or something worse, but whatever it was probably had something to do with why he was so worked up. Of course, Steve didn’t think the scolding was appreciated either, but he doubted just that resulted in such a reaction.
dumbfounded.
, either, but maybe he was wrong?
Still, he couldn't escape the way Steve made him feel. From the first time he met him, everything about Steve made Tony want to fall to his knees, bow his head, and just submit. He’d never, ever, felt that for anyone else. And because of that, Tony immediately put up a wall.
“No!” Tony protested again, frustration bleeding from his voice as his fists balling up at his sides. Considering his body language and whiny tone, Steve wouldn’t have been surprised if he stomped his foot. He took a deep breath before, eyes squeezed shut as he ground out his words, “I don’t
He was trying to convince himself more than anything. If he could just get to his quarters
He tried to force the words out of his mouth, but his tongue-tied and it caused the first set of tears to roll down his cheeks. He wished misbehaving was as hard as
“Of course I wanna have sex with you. I can barely think about anything else. I dream about fucking you while you wear a wedding ring with my stupid fucking name on it.”
“Ouch. That hurts.”
“That I hope you and Tony can fix things. That I hope you’re happy, or will be soon. That I hope we can stay friends.”
“Every discussion we have ends in a fight.”
But it’s Tony, instead.
He thinks about how he always comes across as too eager, too enthusiastic, it’s too much, and why do you care so much about this, Tony? No one else does. What, you feel so alone that you need to fund an entire team of superheroes so you can pretend you have friends? As if any of these people would actually like
“Who here looks like they’ve been doing pretty much nothing for the past week except sleep under the Tuscan sun and maybe visit some churches? Not us.”
“We could,” Nat says, interrupting Tony’s train of thought, “but I don’t think Steve would—”
“We were manipulated. An old friend of mine was in the middle of it.”
Steve looks at him. He presses his lips together, but his jaw doesn’t do that horrible thing it does when he’s truly displeased.
“You did it!” Steve cheers, smiling to encourage Tony to be proud of himself.
“Tony—” Steve whispers, his voice trembling.
“Oh, that’s—”
“Can we… can we start slow? I, I feel like my heart is going to explode.”
“You gave me the tech to reinforce the room, I thought—”
, the way it seems to echo in the empty gym at night, how sincere it sounds despite everything—it gives a twinge to Tony’s chest that forces him to take his eyes off of Steve’s. Sometimes, when this happens, Tony feels as though there’s not enough skin to cover the hole above his heart. He fears the scars are stretching at the seams, that the skin grafts are melting off of him. He fears that the same pain he felt waking up in the cave is waiting for him in his near future, instead of being just a thing of the past.
All of a sudden, he finds himself in a strange place. It’s a cave. He’s very familiar with one specific set of caves, in the Afghan mountains, but he’s never seen this one. Not that he can remember, anyway. Maybe he’s been here before, though. It’s a bit weird, the way he remembers it, but doesn’t really.
Tony hesitates. “It was.”
“You’re my dads.”
He looks at the translucent shine of his own saliva and imagines it being his come dribbling out of Steve, and he can’t wait to be inside him. He can’t fucking wait.
It doesn’t hurt, though. Not much, anyway. There’s that, at least. The man always brings lube with him, a good brand, and Tony doesn’t need a lot of preparation, especially after months of being fucked every night. But the man doesn’t always care about slicking himself up sufficiently, doesn’t care about making it good for Tony. He doesn’t care whether he hurts Tony or not; it’s just coincidental that most of the time Tony can tolerate it.
Steve touches his arm at the elbow.
And even if all of that had to happen, even if Steve had to keep that terrible truth from Tony, maybe there was still a place, in the entirety of the damn multiverse, where Steve didn’t smash his shield on Tony’s arc reactor, on Tony’s heart, where he didn’t walk all over it. Where he didn’t walk away.
He turns. Tony is studying a part of the building with his engineer eyes, sunglasses in hand, his nose comically close to the wall. He looks at Tony until the power of his stare makes Tony look back.
Steve’s first instinct, while the water washes over him, is to bang his head against the tiles as hard as he can. Then he remembers that would probably mean breaking the tiles themselves, and it doesn’t seem like a good idea anymore.
The shield hits a wall and skids across the ground. It ends up close to Tony in a clatter.
It’s always great, because they’re in love and they love having sex with each other, but even for Steve it’s starting to feel a bit like a chore. They both want it to be more— spontaneous, Tony thinks.
“Steve. No,” Tony says, and the word, that
But Steve starts to wonder what it would be like to come inside Tony, you know, just because he really likes feeling like a kicked puppy, and because that’s the thing that never happens, and, sure, it could just be that Tony doesn’t like bottoming, plain and simple; not everything Tony does has some weird, hidden motivation that Steve isn’t privy to. But Steve wonders, and the more he wonders the more it doesn’t happen.
“I’m trying to help him, but... I don’t wanna rush him, of course, but I’m starting to feel like I’ve been hanged by the neck and I just won’t die.”
“Steve,” he sighs, right before he’s about to come, and then Steve does something that Tony really didn’t expect.
As an indissoluble vow. A violent promise of eternity.
He hears Tony sigh and walk across the room. With a gentleness Steve doesn’t deserve, Tony takes his wrists, makes him turn around and spread his legs. He curls up in Steve’s lap.
Steve reaches for Tony’s soap. He lathers up his hands. He starts massaging Tony’s back, slowly making his way up toward the injury, towards the swollen, red-blue skin of his shoulder. He goes above it, over Tony’s collarbone, and below it, reaching as far as Tony’s elbow, coming back up again on the underside of his arm. When Steve’s hands move over the nape of Tony’s neck, pressing his thumbs deep into the skin at the base of Tony’s head, that’s when Tony lets go of the sob he’s been holding in his chest this whole time.
Against all odds, for Steve.
“You can’t… you can’t be serious.”
, and—
This is relief.
“It’s hurting him plenty, believe me.”
“It must be amazing, to connect with someone like that,” Steve says, and it leaves Tony in a strange sort of bafflement. Steve
He adjusts himself on Steve, props himself up on Steve’s chest, and rolls his hips.
Steve lowers his head and nods. “I love it. Thank you.”
“Oh,” Steve whispers.
But it’s okay. Steve’s got him.
“Yeah?”
“Brubaker’s Bakery.”
Tony turns. He sighs, exasperated, closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose, lifting his glasses with the gesture.
“And it was good.”
“Steve, listen to me. You know you’re going to die if you don’t… you know it, right?”
And after that, of course, Tony doesn’t suddenly love himself. He isn’t magically healed. But he doesn’t think about the way he sees himself for a while, and he feels grounded again, centered; he finds his balance again. And for the time being, that’s enough.
He just wants to be able to hug them both, and tell them he loves them one last time.
“Before I met you, everyone told me that you were just like your father. And you were, in some ways—all affectations. But the way you think... I’ve seen your father think. You’re different. His science wasn’t as sound as yours. He’d often have to rethink things because they malfunctioned, or didn’t work as he expected. I’m not saying he wasn’t a genius, ‘cause he was; or that you don’t make mistakes, ‘cause you do. But the way you see things... you can see miles ahead. Into the future. He couldn’t, not like you. He could see how the world would be the next day. You can see it in a hundred years.” He smirks. “So I figure you must’ve taken after someone else.”
He shivers again. He’s cold, and he’s bleeding. It’s bad. It’s so bad.
Maybe it’s not actually a smile, maybe it’s just an involuntary reflex, but. She smiled.
Where he didn’t leave.
Tony smiles. “Okay,” he sighs, “okay.”
“Steve.”
“Good morning,” Steve replies, touching Tony’s hand resting on the couch. “Thanks for breakfast.”
“Oh?”
“Good morning, sweetpea,” he says into her hair.
“I’d rather you stayed here,” Tony says in a whisper that only Steve can hear.
Steve twists on his side and curls up against Tony, burrows his face in his chest. Tony caresses his back in long, reassuring strokes. Steve breathes in his scent, wood and coconut, and a light undertone of bleach and garlic, both stubbornly clinging to Tony’s fingers from last night.
“I’ll need you by my—fuck. I won’t ask you to fight, but…”
“Shhh. Don’t think about that, please, it’s... I’m fine.”
for a perfume. Steve doesn’t know if it airs in the States, he never watches television, except the news sometimes. And movies, yes, a couple of TV shows, but the DVDs have no commercials.
“Wha—Die? When? Me?”
He remembers existing in this room, their room, a room that suddenly felt like a place Steve had never been to, because Tony wasn’t there anymore, and Tony was
“Okay.”
“No, no. You get your rest. I’ll watch you sleep in a non-creepy way.”
I don’t want to talk with him. I don’t have the heart for it. Or the stomach.
He looks so small. He’s a kid. He’s just a little kid. He goes to
“Oh?”
Tony moans, loud and deep and so unlike anything Steve is used to hear from him, so different from that one other time he got to do this to him, before, when Tony got so worked up that he could barely stand Steve’s touch. Steve pushes his finger deeper inside Tony, experimentally, looks, transfixed, at Tony’s face, every breath and moan and groan like a declaration of trust, a promise, a commitment.
“So perfect that you went into heat because I needed you to be.” Steve’s voice is like honey filling Tony up, the sweetest thing.
“Me too,” Steve says.
“I…” he says, but can’t continue for a moment. “I feel like… myself,” he finishes. Steve is about to ask for clarification, but Tony speaks again. “I’m me. Whole,” he says, and Steve understands.
“Keep breathing.”
Steve hears Riri say something. He doesn’t know what; he’s not really listening. She leaves, though, so maybe she was excusing herself. Saying that she’d leave them alone to sort this out.
Thankfully, Steve hadn’t been rude about it or showed any of the contempt he must have naturally felt. He hadn’t acted scandalized either. Not that he’s a bigot, actually, from what Tony has seen at least, but… oh, hell. He was even nice enough to kiss Tony back, for fuck’s sake. Tony went up on his tiptoes, turned his face just so, hesitated for a moment, and then Steve kissed him, meeting him halfway, too kind to force Tony through the awkwardness of refusing him or the annoyance of putting him back in his place. But no matter how inexplicably good Steve’s reaction was, the mess had been made and there was no turning back. Tony remembers saying goodbye, even calling Steve
“Call… call—”
“Ugh... damn.”
“I’m not telling you. Not now.”
, says the label on the strap.
How did they not realize. How did Tony not realize.
Blood. Brain. Bones.
“I just meant that I thought—”
Steve doesn’t really pay attention to it.
Steve is back in the house the moment Tony and Stella stop embracing. He’s polite like that.
Tony hesitates, and he shoots a quick, timid glance at Steve. “Maybe because we hoped that this day would arrive, baby. That we would make up at some point. That thing you felt last night, the fireworks in your head? That was me and Dad taking care of our garden again after so many years. And I’m so glad we did, but it took me too long to decide, and you… I hurt you.”
“Oh, don’t... don’t mention it,” Steve says, while the doors close between them.
Tony wakes up and rubs at his eyes, yawns. Steve is there, sitting on the bed next to him, his pillow trapped between his back and the headboard, his socked feet still under the blanket. He’s drawing.
“It was
That’s what Tony does, isn’t it? He takes care of people. He wants to take care of virtually everyone, and he’s crumbling under the weight of that responsibility, which he can’t possibly keep carrying alone.
“Yeah, I… you’re the only Alpha he’s ever listened to.”
“I’m here. I love you. I love you so much.” He wants that to be the last thing Tony hears. To know that he’s loved. “I’ll love you for the rest of my life.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, because he simply can’t not do it.
“I don’t want to hurt you. I swear.”
“Sarah,” Tony replies.
Steve’s words from last night reverberate inside Tony’s rib cage, behind his heart.
Her skin is fair and wrinkled, stained with age, but healthy. She’s wearing a coral lipstick, and has a bit of mascara on her eyelashes. Her long, white hair is tied up at the base of her neck in a bun, but a few strands have escaped the knot and frame her face in a way that looks like a portrait.
He’s about to attempt an apology, but Tony straightens his shoulders, and his demeanor changes into something fake and constructed.
He’d die. But he wouldn’t touch him.
He caresses Tony’s face one last time, then gets in the car himself and starts driving, sure of the direction he’s taking because sometimes the serum is actually useful.
“Can I…” Steve hesitates around the request. “Can I get some water?”
So much for everything Nat taught him about being stealthy.
“I can get you hard. I bet I can, I’ll—”
But sad? Tony can’t deal with sad.
Steve has no idea what Tony is doing, he only knows that come and lube are leaking out of Tony and onto Steve’s stomach so Steve shoves three fingers into Tony’s hole, to keep everything inside. To keep himself inside.
Tony looks up, between the branches of the tree. He picks up a peach and gives it to Steve. It’s deliberate, how he lets his fingers brush Steve’s. Tony looks at their hands. He grimaces.
He’ll call Tony if there’s any trouble.
“Tony?” Steve asks, tentative, keeping some distance. He’s scared of what’s about to happen; he’s never been more scared than this.
“Yes,” Steve answers immediately.
Steve’s eyes widen, and he rests a hand over his heart. “Like, like my… like my mother?”
“Earlier today, you were saying… How did it feel, making love? To me.”
“I love you,” Steve whispers, like it’s the first time he says it.
Tony wakes up suddenly, a gasp on his lips. His breathing is ragged, he tries to get it under control but to no avail.
“—thirty-one.”
He wets his hair then, parts it on the side. He combs it down with his fingers. It’s not as long as he thought it’d be.
“Yeah. I explained, hope you don’t mind.”
“Tony… When was your mother’s birthday?”
The same place where he keeps his father, and Obie. Where he keeps Afghanistan. Where he keeps the worst of his guilt, the part of it that’s so sharp and evil that it wouldn’t let him right his own wrongs; it would only crush him with its weight. He keeps it bottled there, lets himself feel only the superficial spikes of it, so he can never forget what needs to be done (change, be better, do better) and why (for the people he loves, for everyone else, for those who can’t fight for themselves), but also so that he doesn’t wallow in despair.
“Why’d you send Rhodey there? Nothing against it, just why him?”
When he steps inside, Steve can’t see anything for a few seconds; even his eyes have to adjust to the darkness, to the contrast with the blinding light that dominates outside. He watches Tony perch his sunglasses on his head, a few feet ahead of him.
“Can we—”
“Thank you for giving me your drawing,” Tony whispers after a while, then falls asleep.
He smiled at my motivational speeches, as though he found them a little ridiculous but couldn’t bring himself to mock them. They gave him hope.
“The answer to your question is
Tony feels incredibly alone.
Tony’s eyes sting because the truth of it is that this feels incredible, and he’ll have to do without it from now on.
Just pain.
he murmurs back.
He doesn’t want to think about it now, though, so he coats his fingers with lube and begins rubbing it between Steve’s cheeks, pushing just the tip of his thumb inside to test things out.
“I love you too. I never stopped. I needed not to forgive you right away. I needed to see if I could hold the point. And I could, but… it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. And I withstood actual torture at some point.”
“I have faith in you. I already have a place in mind. Tony’ll love it.”
“And look how I’m repaying her. Taking care of the man who killed her. Like she doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. Like she never… like she never meant anything.” His grimace cuts his face in two halves and Steve’s stomach lurches at the sight.
“That won’t happen.”
In all of this, Tony is what he always wanted to be: he is legacy.
“I do. I remember. I thought you were lingering, but I couldn’t figure out why. Ha.”
Tony flinches back before Steve can touch him.
“Yeah?” Steve says, averting his eyes and trying to sound casual, rearranging his sweaters in his duffle bag for the third time and why did he even bring so many sweaters for two days? Fuck.
“But… Tony, the water’s cold. I can’t—”
“I don’t think so. But I think she was very alone. It does something to a person, Tony, that kind of loneliness. You start clinging to everything. Every scrap of memory becomes huge.”
Steve’s heart breaks, his eyes burn.
Tony fucks himself on Steve ruthlessly, viciously, and lets Steve go so deep, too deep, it’s too damn much—
“Tony, no, we… Let’s just rest—”
And it wasn’t just that.
“Sit on my face, Steve. Right the fuck now.”
“Fine!” Steve clamps his mouth shut an instant after the word comes out, filling the room with how loud it is. Steve is always so careful about the way he speaks. He rarely needs to raise his voice to be listened to, and he never does it with Tony or Sarah or any of his friends.
“Why not?”
– he’s gonna remember this image forever and he’s so, so screwed.
“Yeah. We can. Is that something you want?”
“I don’t know, I just... Please. I want you inside me. Need you inside me.”
“But, are you guys together now? ‘Cause I feel like I should know this.”
“Would you?” Tony insists, and he is officially the shittiest human ever. But he needs to know. After the way Steve tackled him to the ground, he needs to know.
Tony sighed, annoyed because she was right and sad because he
At first, Tony flinched. This wasn't a touch he was very accustomed to. Honestly, he wasn't very accustomed to any touch by then. He wanted to pull away and tell him to leave him alone, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. The fingers against his scalp felt nice.
"I know, sweetheart," she appeased sympathetically, sounding sad, "I know. Just a few more weeks."
just so she could try and make sure that he was okay. God, he loved his Pepper. And he could never repay her.

Sometimes, it was well before he even made it over her knee. Sometimes, it was as soon as she gave him the
long. Getting to let go with Steve was actually a little therapeutic, whether Tony liked it or not, but nothing was as soothing as his Pepper. Even with his still-stinging ass, this was the calmest he'd felt in months. He didn't have shit to worry about it and it was lovely.
“Relax, Tony," Steve shushed him, calling him by his nickname for the first time. He kept one arm wrapped around him while the other hand kept his head cradled against him, "You're gonna be just fine."
Steve gave an exasperated sigh. Before he could respond, though, Jarvis spoke up for him, “Some have already been lied out in Tony’s restroom, Sir.”
nice. Steve was obviously very experienced when it came to this kind of stuff. Tony couldn't figure out why the man was alone, and he definitely didn't understand why he was pursuing
And it wasn't completely one-sided either. Not if all of the sputtering and blushing Tony did whenever the two of them spoke was anything to go off of. Steve had plenty of patience and time to wait for Tony to come around. He wasn't worried about that. However, he was expecting a lot more time to pass before he ended up with Tony bawling in his lap, nearly inconsolable.
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly one night when they were at one of Tony’s famous parties at the tower. Tony had been hiding from the mass amounts of people out on his balcony, and Steve had followed him once he’d noticed his absence, “What’re you doing out here?”
Pepper didn’t like it when he got shitfaced drunk, though, especially not in the public eye. That wasn’t a phone call he wanted to receive. And God forbid she actually came to the tower to deal with him. Just the thought of Pepper’s hairbrush made him shudder.
By then, it was clear that Tony was struggling to articulate what he was feeling in an appropriate manner. Honestly, he was so frustrated that Steve was surprised that he hadn't burst into a tantrum already. It was all getting to be too much for him, bless his heart, but Steve was happy that Tony was still trying so hard to behave, even though it was hard. There'd be tons of praise to offer as soon as he got the stubborn sub to finally go to bed.
Steve kept his voice low as he explained the obvious, gesturing to the wet, loose collar of the undershirt that Tony had been using to wipe at his face all night, “It’s perfectly okay if you don’t want me to see. It’s nothing for me to step out for a second just so you can-“
"How'd I know..." he heard Pepper's voice from the phone in his hand and it caused a smile spread across his face. Her tone held the same exasperated fondness she used so often when handling him and it had him making impatient grabby hands at the phone, his previous turmoil long forgotten now that he was no longer alone.
"You can't blame yourself," he comforted. It really wasn't her fault; Tony just needed more attention than she had to give him. And he didn't want anyone
The word came out as a shriek, causing Steve to sigh. This was definitely becoming a tantrum, and the ‘easy way’ was slipping further and further out of his reach. He loosened his grip on Tony to the point where he was barely touching him but could still catch him if he fell backward. If he needed some space while he worked through his fit, Steve would give it to him. He would not, however, let him hurt himself.
“I’ll be there in the morning, baby boy,” she promised again, using another familiar nickname that made Tony blush. Before she could continue, someone outside of the screen caught her attention. He couldn't make out most of the conversation, but he could tell they were talking about her plane.
Steve was hoping for the easy way; the way where he could just hold and rock Anthony until he fell asleep and then lay him in his bed without his knowing. He didn’t want to be mean (or, at least what Tony would consider mean) but he also wasn’t letting him stay up all night. He pretty much had one job and it was to get Tony to sleep; he did not plan to fail.
expecting Tony to pull his arms back and hit him, with both hands, in his chest.
"Okay, listen, I
"I'm going to talk to Steve to make sure he can take care of you as well as possible because I know you don't like to make that too easy on people," Pepper explained truthfully, lifting the camera to show her not-so-pleased face as she continued, "Anything we've said about you or will say about you in the future when you're not listening is just us talking about what's in your best interest. You know better than to think anything otherwise."
His heart fluttered a little bit when Steve grinned at him with a fond look in his eyes. He tickled at his sides a little bit as he spoke, “I believe it was about a certain
"Mr. Stark would like the both of you to know that he's ready for bed and for you to give him the phone back," Jarvis announced, sounding wary, "I must let you know that he hasn't exactly done what you've asked of him..."
Tony nearly sputtered because well, yeah...that’s exactly what it was. Nobody wanted a submissive who didn’t know how to submit, especially not one who was Tony’s age. All he could manage to do was glare at Steve and give him a pitiful shake of the head. He didn't trust himself to speak.
. Almost as if nothing in the world could touch him
Steve didn’t know what part of “earlier” he was referring to at first, but he knew better than to ask, so he just racked his brain for a moment. He’d pretty much forgotten about Tony’s little fit already, but it came to the forefront of his mind after a short moment in thought.
"Whether he chooses to go to sleep or just cry in your lap all night," Pepper was chuckling as she answered him, but he could tell she was dead serious, "Tony comes with a lot of long nights. Luckily for you, I don't see tonight being one of the bad ones, but you never know. That's why I want you to be absolutely sure you'd like to stay instead of calling Rhodey. I just don't think it's fair for you to see his worst on the first night."
“It was no trouble,” he answered truthfully, smiling back at her before he began to walk towards the elevator, “I’m sure he’ll have plenty of
a soft white) and the A.I. spoke again, “On the second shelf, you should find plenty of washcloths, Sir.”
At first, he figured she was just being the overprotective mama bear that she was being the previous night, but apparently, he was wrong.
– it was all over. Tony’s plan to get Steve to just leave him alone with minimal complications went completely out of the window. He was
big it was for so long. It kept him from drowning in guilt, sure, but the way he was feeling now made up for it tenfold. Now, he was wishing he could go back in time to that night and just mind his curfew instead of being a

, did he want to pop Tony’s ass. It would have been cake to flip him over his knee and let him know all of the ways in which what he just did was
Much to Steve's relief, Tony giggled in response. He shyly brought a hand up to wipe at the tears that were forced to fall when his eyes crinkled, "Do you know how to work
“Are you.. are you seriously standing here cooking in your bloody uniform?” She snorted; well at least that was a sight to brighten her day.
“What the fuck is this?” Holding out his phone, she squinted at his phone screen being the only light source in the room. Flicking on a light she glared at him.
It’d been a long day; University had been busier than normal in the lead up to exams. She just kept telling herself - one more year - when in reality she still had to find a graduate job. What can one actually do with a degree in Criminology?
“Laura, darlin’ it’s late. Come on we’ll got through to my-“ Steve was interrupted by the front door slamming. “The fuck Buck?” He said turning to his best friend.
“I do actually own the place..” She groaned
it was because of the two thank you texts he’d received from the two idiots. His two favourite idiots.
When she arrived back at the flat four hours later, Steve was already opening the door to her before she could even get her hand on the handle.
“I was hungry!” He whined.
for him to come around. Every-time I tried to make the first move it didn’t work. Bucky doesn’t want me, I’ve accepted that now.. maybe it’s time you do too. Matchmaker isn’t really your biggest strength.” A weak smile on her face as she finally pushed her way out of his grasp.
“Why can’t you just answer my question?”
“It wouldn’t be that bad, though, I mean—”
Steve is waiting for him, patiently leaning back against a table, arms crossed over his chest and face pensive, his hair falling over his forehead and catching the light just right.
Except now he is.
“Are you sure, Tony? It seems like it’s none of my business.”
Pain is like a vise around his face and his heart and his soul.
He’s so tight and wet and hot and—
“People who didn’t even know her were there. And I wasn’t. Because I was too busy dealing with Ross and covering up your shit to go to Peggy’s funeral, or to even realize that it was happening at all!” He has to hold his left arm in place with the right one so it doesn’t shake too badly.
Steve gasps, but he doesn’t do anything else. He doesn’t flinch, doesn’t move. He’s so good. So careful.
“I wish,” Tony pauses, takes off his glasses and hangs them at the collar of his t-shirt, then he mimics Steve’s gesture from before, swipes his hands across his face and presses his fingers into his eyes. He squints in the sunset light until his vision goes back to normal. “I wish everything was different. I wish we could... talk and... that there was no rush and that we... worked. I wish it wasn’t so hard.”
“Wha—” Steve’s eyes go wide while Tony slides a hand up his stomach. “Oh.
Steve takes his time fingering Tony, slowly, but he knows what he’s doing now and there’s no hesitation in his movements, pushes deep and deep and deep as far as he can go, as far as Tony can take it. There are tears in Tony’s eyes, and Steve pulls him in, hugs him even tighter with his free arm.
Steve, opening the door just a bit. A sharp intake of air. An unplanned moment of hesitation. “The… the towels are in the sink cabinet,” he says, quiet.
He can’t. He can’t.
“Then?”
He sat on Tony’s couch like a man on the electric chair, and said, “I have to tell you something important about Bucky and your parents’ death.”
Steve touches Tony’s soft dick, strokes it, smears his come all over it, gathers some drops and rubs them into Tony’s gray pubic hair, shoves two fingers into Tony again to pick up some more of his own come, uses it to massage Tony’s perineum. Steve keeps moving his hand on Tony, leisurely, patiently, until he’s more than half-hard.
He closes his eyes and tries not to think about it. It’s just the rut. Steve will be back to his own self soon, and Tony needs to help him on the way there, because he promised, because he loves Steve and he promised.
The only thing Steve doesn’t particularly love is how small the space around the Duomo is: the piazza suffers from it, the city presses in from all sides, doesn’t allow the building to breathe like it should.
It’s Tony. He doesn’t look nervous, not exactly, but he’s usually more controlled than this. He looks like he hasn’t slept in a couple of days, which isn’t much for Tony’s standards, but his eyes are red, his head looks too heavy for his shoulders. He’s wearing a suit, one of Steve’s favorites, a light grey Tom Ford three-piece with two buttons, a white Yves Saint Laurent shirt underneath, the dark red Brunello Cucinelli silk tie, custom italian leather shoes. And really, the fact that Steve can be this accurate about Tony’s clothes…
“Fight each other, you mean. Which we already do,” Tony says, and he’s not whispering anymore. He lifts his head, too, and Steve doesn’t push him back down. His hand falls to his own lap, still warm from the contact with Tony’s skin.
Do I? Are my powers coming back? Or is it just the healing?
Tony straightens his shoulders, lets his arms fall to his sides, self-conscious about them even more than usual now. He squints at Steve, a gesture meant to convey inquiry and impatience in equal amounts. If this is some type of messed-up courting then Steve can save it.
Steve pushes the lever down, and the water stops. Tony shakes his head and blinks at him, slowly, surprised to see him there. Steve grabs a towel and dries Tony’s hands off, massages his knuckles through the fabric while he ignores all the thoughts wrestling for space in his mind.
The smell of Tony’s skin, his sweat, his callused hands beautifully framed by the silver bracelets at his wrists. His thick fingers, the dark hair on his arms and on the underside of his hands, his veiny muscles—strong in a different way than Steve’s, strong from hard work with machines and tools, from the daily contact with the materialization of his science, with the practicality of invention.
He’s been trying to stop.
When Tony enters Steve’s body this time the room is full of light.
He kisses Tony again, long and deep.
. Tony doesn’t really pay attention to it, but after he stops working on his tablet, the movie picks up some of his attention. Not really out of a conscious decision, he stretches on the couch and places his head on Steve’s lap.
“Yeah...”
There’s Bucky in the frame. His hair is a mess, he’s wearing a tank top and boxers, and has a very visible hickey under his ear. And, most importantly, a big, tired smile on his face.
“My editor suggested I took them out from the English edition, because no one would understand them unless we added a translation. I did it reluctantly, I’ll be honest; they’re a relevant part of the story. Look.”
“I’m almost done with the reactor. Sorry I didn’t say sooner.”
His shirt is unbuttoned, the two sides hanging open over his chest and revealing a tank top that’s now more gray than white. The shirt itself is stained with blood, as though Tony used it to clean up his head wound as best he could. His black pants are scuffed at the knees, and his leather shoes are covered in dust.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
After lunch, they go back to the Piazza and inside the Palazzo Pubblico, where Steve spends more time than Tony probably has the patience for staring at the frescos and taking notes, but Tony doesn’t complain. He simply waits for Steve to be done.
Nah, he’s just fooling himself. Alpha/Omega dynamics are still so often like that at their core, even though masked under the veil of good social norms, tradition, duty, biology. Otherwise, Tony wouldn’t have had to build a web of Omega shelters across the world, to allow unmated Omegas to go through their heats without Alphas breaking into their homes and—
Steve thinks about the sign saying not to go up the tower in case of heart problems. But Tony is… he’s fine. Right? He said so.
“Nevermind,” he replies, and goes back to licking into Tony.
“Right. Yes. I just... I like watching you cook.”
Tony’s still asleep.
He rests a hand on his own thigh. He turns his fist upwards, opens his palm.
He straightens his sweater while he enters the kitchen, but Tony looks at him and giggles.
Steve starts moving into him, slow at first, just like Tony asked. Tony reaches out to him with his mind and he feels Steve already there, waiting for him.
Steve sighs. “Guess you saw it on the news. The Accords, the fight at that airport in Germany.”
“I love this place,” he tells Steve. “Almost all my ties, I get them from here. Handmade, one by one. This is top quality artisanal craftsmanship, Cap.”
“I forgive you. Steve. I forgive you.”
Later, during lunch, Tony asks him about the team again.
“I saw Peggy. Wanda, I mean, she made me see Peggy. The war was over, there was a party.
Tony locks his phone, the
Tony cries out in surprise while his body shakes as much as Steve allows it to. He can’t possibly take Steve’s fingers on top of the half-formed knot; it’s starting to hurt and the stretch is too much, so much more than what Tony can tolerate right now. Steve grunts and takes his fingers out of Tony’s hole, bringing his hand in front of Tony’s face and just waiting, his forefinger and middle finger glistening with Tony’s slick all over them.
A long minute passes.
They drive off.
“Yes. It’s, it’s a choice. A choice we make.”
“Your hair is a mess.”
And here, this place. The quiet of the countryside, the stillness of nature, this slower life...
They start climbing the stairs, towards the light.
this was going to happen.
, Tony thinks, some things really never change. Sometimes you just love hating yourself in some particular way that you manage to pick it back up right where you left off, no matter how long it’s been.
Steve takes off his own t-shirt and caresses Tony’s arms again, from the elbow up to the neck, lingering on his shoulders. He smiles, pure now, and kneels in front of Tony, slow as if they’ve got all the time in the world to dedicate to these kinds of little games. He touches Tony’s stomach and lures a gasp out of him, the sound rippling against the walls of the empty gym, of the night. Steve frames Tony’s hips with his hands, stares at someplace between Tony’s navel and his dick, hard and visible through his pants. He should’ve worn something thicker, he should’ve stayed in his room. He should’ve kept watching Steve from afar knowing that he wasn’t an Alpha to be trifled with.
Half his face is scar tissue. His right eye is grey.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Steve doesn’t fall for it. He never has.
, Steve thinks, an acute sense of calm chilling him deep to his bones.
He’s trying to keep Tony’s organs from falling out of him and doing a piss poor job of it.
He clutches at his heart, feels his mother’s necklace under his fingers, trapped between his skin and the technical fabric of his undershirt. He feels all the ridges of the little sun-shaped pendant, remembers how it looked against the fair skin of her neck.
It’s Tony that eats at his soul in the dead of night; it’s Tony he thinks about when he’s restless and the heat between his thighs just won’t go away. It’s thoughts of Tony that erode him, consume him bit by bit like millennia of rain have done to the mountains.
“If you don’t mind.”
There are many people in the room with him while it happens, but it’s always the same guy putting his hands on Steve. Bald, big, Alpha. Particularly gleeful about it all. He has a
A terrible laugh raises up from the floor and fills the entire cave, shakes the walls with its contempt for Tony, with the power of its sickening mockery. Rocks fall from the ceiling, and Tony’s chest bursts with pain.
“Yeah—”
“Never again?”
“Yeah, that’s where they got us. We were on our way to… shit, the weapons—”
“What did she say?” Tony asks, echoing Steve’s question.
“I do not disapprove—”
“Now the sling,” Steve says, passing it to him once they’re in the bedroom.
It’s everywhere. It clouds Tony’s presence in his mind, mutes the bond and brings him into a state of abject misery.
He comes back to himself to hear Tony’s concerned voice call his name. It’s a gift, each and every time it happens, each and every time Steve gets to feel Tony’s lips form the sound of his name. It’s the only thing of Tony that Steve can still claim as his in the privacy of his heartbreak.
Tony sighs and sits next to Steve. Here it comes.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut, forces himself to regain control. He opens his eyes again, blinks a few times, blinks the tears away. Steve dabs at his face with one of his sleeves.
The man clutches him tight when he fucks him from behind, or while laying on their sides. One of Tony’s ribs is bruised. More likely broken. It’s not healing properly. It’s not healing at all—weeks have gone by and it still hurts like the first day. But it’s not just the man’s fault—sometimes, Tony twists and breathes in too deep on purpose, so the sharp jolt of pain fills his mind to the brim, and he can’t think about anything else. He can’t feel anything else.
she says, taking Tony’s hands in her own. “Listen to this old lady: he loves you, and you love him. You’ve hurt each other, and you shouldn’t ignore that. I know it’s hard, Tony, but if you can find it in yourself to forgive him and move past this, I don’t think you’d regret it. No matter how little time you think you have left, it would be worth it.”
“Take off your armor. Sit down and breathe. Now.”
So when it finally happens, it’s not really a surprise. They’re in the gym, sparring, and everything seems normal until they’re both on the floor, Steve on his back, Tony on top of him between his legs. But instead of trying some move to keep Steve from freeing himself, instead of scrambling to his feet, instead of doing any of the million things Tony could do in a situation like this– Tony sets his jaw, braces his hands on the floor on both sides of Steve’s head, takes a deep breath through his nose, and presses his hips into Steve’s.
“Steve,” he tries.
Steve wipes Tony’s face with a handkerchief and kisses him, biting his bottom lip in the process, and he tastes like freedom, and Tony swears it’s not a joke about America.
She kisses him again, and leaves.
He kisses Steve, and without slowing down at all he says, “I want you to forgive yourself.”
There’s something in him, an awful sensation in his lower abdomen, like ten invisible knives have been planted and twisted into him. His legs weigh so much he can’t even move them.
At some point, there’s a sharp pain in his lower back, and Steve stops feeling his legs altogether. All things considered, it’s probably better this way.
God, Mom was so much better than him. Her fingers weren’t as thick as Tony’s, or as rough. She played in such a refined way. She moved her whole body with the music.
Steve looks up at him, confused, fisting his cock as hard as he can to keep the pain at bay.
“All our clothes have been folded.”
“Bucky’s gonna murder me.”
“Alright.”
It’s good to have people around.
Steve pushes himself up onto his hands. He groans.
Steve’s heart is beating so fast. He’s in love, so sue him.
“I’m really sorry I snapped.”
Steve does care, and he does worry. It just happens to be more about Tony’s well-being than his libido.
Maybe Tony has underestimated how much Steve is hurting. He seems fine, except for the way he smells. But he’s also not a normal Alpha.
“But it was too dangerous! After SHIELD—”
“Might sound like a case of pot and kettle, me saying this, but the world’s problems are not on you. They’re not your direct responsibility.”
Steve laughs.
“Right, remember that time I gave Ross the middle finger and fucked off to help my dumbass friend and if discovered I would’ve had to, and I quote, ‘arrest myself’? Oh, wait! That was actually you!”
“Steve.”
“Shut up.” Tony has to close his eyes for a moment to gather his patience. “You can ask for more food, if you need it.” There’s more force to the words this time.
It’s whole.
,” Tony says, harsh and rude, and he wants to kick his own ass as soon as the sentence leaves his mouth. Steve takes the blow like a champ and walks towards the little wall at the edge of the hilltop. There are trees there, providing cover from the sun. Tony follows him.
Steve can’t feel Tony’s presence next to him anymore, and turns to look for him. He stopped walking (again) in the middle of the street, and he’s reading something on his phone, eyes wide behind his glasses and a worried frown on his forehead.
But Steve touches Tony’s forearm, then travels up—big fingertips, slightly tapping at the skin, sliding over it in a whisper—to burrow his hand underneath Tony’s sleeve, grabbing at his bicep, at his deltoid, stretching the cotton until it might rip. Steve’s other hand is at the hem of the t-shirt a moment later, lifting it, and in a brief blur Tony’s half-naked, stumbling a little when he almost loses his balance on the padded floor.
“Please, Steve. Just a little effort. I know it’s a lot, but... it’s important.”
There’s symbology there, something psychosomatic, as Sam would say. He doesn’t want to acknowledge it.
