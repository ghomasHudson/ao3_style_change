“No hay problema, rest a bit then you can both join me for a good meal - I want to know details about Mr Baker’s next novel! - and a vehicle will be ready for you.”
Murmuring, Molly tries to catch her friend attention. “Sherlock! Stop that, it’s a wedding, we are in church!”
With a sigh, Molly shakes her head. “Sherlock... remember what I told you a few weeks ago. I’m going with my new boyfriend.” After a pause, she adds blushing slightly. “Have you... did you... RSVP?”
Remembering that he was following an ex-military, the detective starts to cautiously tail him. A few meters behind, enough to be able to see anything but not that close to raise any suspicion – the campus was a public building after all! – the little game quickly became useless. Texting Lestrade, he notes everything. As boring as it was.
The voice, coming from the passageway, makes both men freeze. Greg, who was all for telling Sherlock, looked at his brother-in-law with a critical eye.
It's not perfect, it's falsely cheesy. 'with the right man at my side' bla bla, no way I'm going to fall for someone who needs me to be someone like that!!
Reply by Harry: Are you all right John? I am so worried, and Clara too. Didn't like yesterday's comment either... One day at a time, everything is going to be nice again, I promise!
Opening the files on Watson, he surveys what happened after he left the Yard. Nothing special, he walked home, the light went off an hour later
“Stamford! You are right on time,” a clearly inebriated Murray called, “Watson was talking about his conquests!”
Also, I'm going to be away from my computer for the next two weeks (Belgium, here I come!) so I'm going to be a bit late for the next chapter...   Update: April 7th: I'm back! I'm going to work on the next chapter and hope to have something before the end of the weeks!
With innocent eyes, the family man chuckles. "It went... well... if I remember what the pub owner told me when I came to check that everything went okay with our guests before leaving for our honeymoon." He winks and at Mike satisfaction, John was turning a nice shade of pink. "And then..."
“Mike,” Watson interrupts his friend, “have you not caught that the most important part of this is that it’s a STUDENT!” He looks around, but nobody was paying attention to their discussion.
"Stop it! Someone was with him, I learned later that it was his brother." He grimaces as he remembers his 'conversation' with the man. "He's probably out of the hospital right now, it wasn't really serious."  The image of the limping young man, his bruised face, the blood on his lips was affecting him.
"No, no, I won't. But I don't want your conflict with the Holmes brothers to hurt our friendship." He pauses, looking at John with pleading eyes. "Please, for old time sake."
Unconsciously, the image of the young brilliant outcast, too bright for the other students, finding peace in his work but bullied by some idiots was juxtaposed over his own life. He even found works written by Smith that he sent to other students, but it was not the goal right now...
After a quick stop at the shop, the joyful trio arrived at John's cute little house. As the doctor gives his key to Clara, she quickly runs to open the door, leaving John and Harry alone for a moment. Harry laughs at Clara's obvious ploy to leave them on their own. "I think she wants to be sure that you have the chance to chide me in person!"
“Yes,” Moran chuckles, “I think it is.” After a moment while he sits without even looking at his prisoner, he asks, “what did you two chat about?”
“A second man is helping the other by holding Holmes now!” Anderson shouts. “We must send someone right now! The nearest cops are only a minute away and -”
After one last look, Mycroft turns and runs to the small plane for the one-hour flight to Serbia, as Greg - still in his best suit and ready to play his part - rushes to the car.
Reply by Harry: John darling, don't react like that. We just want to help you get better and I want to hug you so badly right now!
Angry at what he considers a disrespectful tone and the sexual innuendos, the rugged man nearly loses his temper when he remembers that he had a wild card. “Already tired of you little doctor, Holmes?” Playing innocence, Sherlock cocks his head interrogatively.  “You know, we investigated the dear captain and –“
“I know that you are not in your element, but I think it’s a nice place to start,” the pathologist protested, suddenly unsure.
At 18.30, Mycroft, without (openly) looking that interested in the outcome of the whole affair, walks by the CCTV room. “Any news?”
Shaking himself from his stupor, he tried to step near the bus door, but it was impossible to do so. Guilt and horror raised in his gut, the feeling of being useless overwhelming.
Pointing out the cane to Clara with an amazed grin, Harry asks quietly, "and then he just... disappeared?"
– and Sherlock indulging in his love of dancing which he rarely had occasion to do, was nearly happy.  After one last high paced cha-cha, where Molly and Sherlock wouldn’t stop laughing about how inept Molly was,
"I never said that you were..." placing a comforting hand on his now shaking brother, Mycroft continues, "but you aren't a high-functioning-sociopath either. Please think about it. She's a brilliant woman who is working with MI5 and MI6 agents, she's going to be able to... understand... what you want or need to tell her."
Once Mycroft had left his room, the detective fights his constant exhaustion and opens his eyes. Willing his body to obey, he sits and turns slowly before placing his legs over the side of the bed.
He was still gazing at the sky, lost in his thoughts while putting back his phone in his pocket when it rings. Breaking the silence.
As usual, thank you for reading and remember that kudos and comments are little gifts from the internet Gods!
The stunning woman would have tempted him a few days ago, but at the moment, she was a bit of a nuisance. “You’ve got the wrong man, miss, if you can just move your car, I am in a bit of a hurry.”
"Yes, when you said your name at the end of our exchange..." He raises his hand to stop John's outburst. "but not before. Stamford never told me your name." Wanting to occupy himself, he rushes to the kitchen for tea. "Do you really think that I would have accepted had I known?"
Less than ten minutes later - after a mad course in lanes, jumping over gates and other madness - they were both laughing like madmen in the middle of the street.
“You can try if you want.” John, arms crossed, waits patiently. “Might want to speak a bit faster, though, I don’t want to be late.”
“Don’t fish for information, Holmes, I know you’ve met... the boss.” The slight hesitation was clearly audible.
“I love music, especially when played by a brilliant man, and anyway I can promise you that I have ideas that are going to
“Mister Baker, your room!” He opened the door to a cool and neat room as if he was the owner of a small B&B showing off the amenities. “You have everything that you need in the bathroom, towels, soap, razor.” With a wink, he walked to the end of the bathroom to open another door. “Conjoined room, because sometimes you may need something,” he winked again to John’s annoyance, “in the night.” The other bedroom was a duplicate of the first, small but kind of lush compared to the outside of the building. “My dear friend, you don’t have a bag… I have a man that is tall and thin like you. I will get you things. Okay?”
Marcy, who is now silently fighting with Alan to get the detective’s bag, explained. “It was before our time, but it was the talk of the campus then! A student, Max Smith, was found dead in the Chemistry lab.”
In a soothing voice, the government man replies calmly. "Yes, this is was people usually do. Or a telegram... but... 'Lock, you remember that... he does not know that you are alive."  Placing himself in front of Sherlock's path, he tried to engulf him in his arms, but the detective shrugs dismissively.
"That, one way or in other, you'd find a way to go back to John Watson." Her laughter echoes in the deserted church shaking John to the core, "You already died once to keep him safe. Now you must die to preserve his reputation and his liberty. Think about it, you can be a hero and die tragically, romantically, even in this church or the fact that John killed that cabby after only knowing you for one day is going public."
"If it's dinner... and it's not going well it can be much longer, and then it will be more awkward at work..."
“Don’t tell me what to think about my brother, DI Lestrade, just be sure that nothing unsavoury happens, that’s all I require.”  Greg shudders at what he knows for a fact was a very unsubtle insinuation that Holmes wasn’t overly confident about the Met’s ability to protect his brother... and to keep him away from the sweeties.
Harry, like a telly host, opens the message and clear her voice theatrically. "Dear Sleepless. I just want to say that I have been touched by the apparent similarity of our profiles. We are both scientists of some sort, my life is quite exciting sometimes and you look like someone who is in dire need of excitement. In fact, I really don't understand what you are doing in that village, as I personally can't imagine my life out of London. We both have utterly disgusting meddling siblings. We should talk if only to stop them and protecting ourselves. I may not be perfect, far from it some may say, but I think that I am a great person and that, with the right man at my side, I could aspire to become a good human being."
The man, John’s friend for nearly ten years now, is always there when needed. A harbour  when the other man is lost.
“Oh, sorry!” John raises his head quickly, turning to the screen to realize that he hadn’t even set  up his computer.
"What are you saying? You need to go back to London? Now?" John is looking at his sister, surprised. "You seemed so happy to be here for the New Year and now..."
Not liking the direction of the discussion, Sherlock rises, suddenly drained.“I’m tired, think I’m going to go back to London. Molly, you’re all right?”
The fact that the life of such a brilliant student, curious and eager to learn ended like that was a personal affront to Sherlock.
! Fortunately, he was sensible enough and took a shower before dropping in his bed and wasn’t stinking of stale alcohol.  Looking at the hour, he decides that it would have to be enough if he wants to be able to go asleep tonight! Jumping from the bed, really slowly and massaging his bad shoulder, he grabs his phone before going into the kitchen for a coffee.
"But now, how can we convince John to read it and give her a chance? Or at least to be willing to start an argument with her?"
"Moriarty. You are the last line of defence. Or, as the man is dead, you're the man... executor, the heir to his vengeance against me."
“Oh, you’re back!” He grins, “I was wondering if I would have to turn off your computer to get your attention.”
“He’s not aware of that fact. You already have a few pictures of him holding you, I’m trying to get them erased but it’s not that simple.” Getting up, he presses his lips as if he was already regretting what he was going to say “I know someone who knows the dean, I’m going to ask her to put in a good word about Doctor Watson. He should be able to end the semester, at the very least.”
They stayed on the sofa, kissing gently, caressing more daringly until a pliant Sherlock murmured close to John’s ear, “I was crazy to think that I could live without you... I love you, John.”
when someone knocks at his door. Closing his laptop he walks to the door cautiously as he rarely has visitors and looks through the peephole before opening the door. "Hello Mike, come in!"
?" The pathologist was, of course, aware that Sherlock wasn't dead and wasn't happy to be at John's wedding either.
“Who was it Sherlock?” Molly asks curiously “You’ve been saying that for nearly two years but I don’t know who it was.”
Urgently, he taps out a message that remains unanswered, like the others. Without a word, Sherlock leaves the table and rushes in the direction of the door.
He is still trying to corral his feelings, to push everything away, when shouts coming from the classroom help him to change the course of his line of thought.
Eyeing the front of the church where the doctor was waiting for Mary to walk down the aisle, he murmurs, "a bit late for that..."
“No, you won’t, you know you love me.” They walk to the other side where the criminals were waiting for transport. “Ah! You were right, mate, it was Appleton and not Holt.”
Now, when the DI was present in the house, his voice resonates everywhere, warming the cold rooms by his presence. Beer and junk food find a place in the fridge.
“Yes, Moran was the intermediary.” McAlister chuckles before being yanks on the way out, “thank God for consulting criminals.”
Not letting the disturbing presence of the sexy doctor – who looks a bit lost that morning poor thing – unsettle him, Sherlock opens his laptop to check the story about the suicide of that student. His friends are right, it was the talk of the campus three years ago! The young prodigy, the award winning awkward young man, killed himself in the middle of a Chemistry lab – now decommissioned - to be found by one of his teachers. Looking around, reading all the available articles, a name pops up many times but always unofficially. Discreetly taking his phone in hand, he quickly sends a text to Lestrade. Half an hour later, a predatory smile appears on his lips as he read the DI’s response.
"Only one year... And I am a man! I am the one who is supposed to --" but John's light banter halts as his eyes fall on the most beautiful man he ever saw. He was tall, not overly tall but way taller than him, thin but with an energetic look, a mop of black curls all over the place because of the wind...
Sherlock, not taking any notes, is mesmerized by the man in front of him. Barely older than himself, he exudes confidence, his authoritative yet warm tone commands the room. With patience that seems boundless, he repeats or explains when needed, replying to questions without any doubts.
Using the nearest bench as leverage, Sherlock rises and sits. Defeated. "Okay... Can I just be alone for a bit, please." Not wanting to leave him, the men hesitate until the detective murmurs lightly, "i'm in a bloody church, what can happen to me? Go home."
"Let me know how it goes." Looking at her notes, she asks, "have you ever considered writing a blog?
Great Sherlock, can I call you Sherlock? M Holmes it's kind of... Don't know. Anyway good, see you at 7PM.
"That John, my brother and DI Lestrade are just behind you." He smiles mockingly. "I think I still know John Watson enough to know that even though he's a man of his word, you won't stay married to him for long now." In his mind it was a blatant lie! John choose her after all... But he couldn't resist to the little jab.
He is finally at a gate when, luck is on his side, a cab turns onto Nassington Road. Not questioning how it is possible that odds were so much in his favour in that deserted area, he jumps in the cab. “Soho, as quickly as possible!” Looking at the hour on the car dashboard, he closes his eyes, trying to summon the last breath of air in his lungs.
He realized, in the last months, that it wasn't as tranquil as before now that it was Greg's home as well if he was honest.  I
“No, no, I am not against the idea. It’s just that I thought that they usually go to clinics that are specifically for them…” On the contrary, he was thrilled that his new employer was that open!
"Who would want me as a flatmate, Stamford, be realistic." He turns to walk toward the door. "I'm going to the mortuary, I forgot my riding whip." With a flourish, he exits the lab.
Without a word, Sherlock slides into the car and crosses his arms. “Everything is fine, I have nothing to say.”
Finally, all the doubts disappeared, leaving only desire and love. John, unable to control himself, was finally able to taste Sherlock’s lips again, longingly playing with them until they opened under the tender assault. Moaning, the vampire let go of his fear, embracing everything that was John. Intensifying the kiss, he pulled the smaller man over him, wanting to feel the warm body on his colder one. Revelling in the fact that he was the one who was causing John's little whimpering sounds and incoherent words. It was sloppy, messy but beautiful. Soon, the only sound in the room was the rasps of their breathing and the wet sound of their kisses.
"Come back with us, John!" Clara insists with a big smile. "For the fireworks and all... I know you miss London!"
“It’s Dakha, and as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh used to be a British colony, I think that most of the moderately educated British citizens should know that.” Everyone turns towards the door where a frowning Mycroft Holmes is standing, as regal as if he was on his way for a meeting with the PM. He smiles coldly. “Or perhaps you asked a rhetorical question? I never know with idiots... DI Lestrade, a word please.”
Of course, he knew that it wasn’t the case, but as he had never felt that way so quickly before, he was overwhelmed. He chuckles nervously,
“But after his suicide, you changed the test to justify his action.” Sherlock shakes his head as Appleton nods, disappointed for once to be right.
“Be careful, brother mine, please. As I told you already, I really don’t like this case. You can’t go back to that mindset without... without consequences.”
Sherlock was looking at Mycroft, not believing a word of what he was saying. "You said, that you need someone to pick up an envelope for you in that big round thing next to Westminster Bridge."
Sherlock was finally all over him once more, he was able to press his hands down his spine, toying with the elastic of his pants until he touches his plush arse.
"Doctor Watson is clearly curious! And now that we know that he interacted with Sherlock on his blog..." She smiles. "Maybe we can set up something!"
"I won't inflict myself on anybody right now..." The doctor replies before changing the subject back to their classmates and how the world is changing far too quickly.
Both trying to stay (remotely) serious, they walk up to Mycroft's car before their little moment was broken by Anthea.
Not listening to the women who were gossiping about what they heard on the boat, something about Madonna buying something at a place or somewhere else he doesn't know or care at the moment, John starts following the man. Rushing, afraid of losing him, he didn't realize that his sister was holding his hand until she pulls harder, yanking him back.
“You really didn’t know...” Sally chuckles, looking at John in amazement. “He worked undercover for us, silly man, how stupid you must feel right now! He changed his look, colored his hair and everything.” Her attitude switches to pity when she saw the hurt in John’s face. “You know, he doesn’t deserve any... feelings you may have for him. He’s a bloody psychopath.”  The pregnant silence that falls between them was cut short by McAlister angry growl.
“Oh, I’ve got something for you, doctor, the delivery man gave it to me yesterday.” She started shaking her big bag, looking for the small envelope as John discreetly rolled his eyes. “Ah! Got it!” She extended her hand and gave the small white envelope to her neighbour.
"Yes, so it's the perfect moment to be anonymous, don't you think?" turning back to his computer, Mycroft hides his annoyance with difficulty.
“Yes...” John replies, absentmindedly “Then I saw him at Scotland Yard after we shared a ride in a panda car.” Another sigh. “Anyway, he’s my student. I can’t do anything.”
"I'll give you 10 minutes, not a minute more." Sighing, John left Mary after a small kiss and walks in direction of the bar.
A few minutes later, as soon as the two women were out of the corridor, the doctor runs to the door and slides inside after removing the paste.
Rolling his eyes at the cheesiness, John chides his sister. "Harry... Stop this. I am happy with what is going on with Sara."
A few minutes later, when they both received their latte, she opens her phone again and pushes it in Clara's face. "Read! It's brilliant! Just so, so, so good!"
Screening rapidly the operation on John’s phone, Anthea realizes that he never read Sherlock’s message! “I can’t believe it! What wrong with men?”
"Another case of selective listening, love. Yes, of course, ex-wife or more specifically never-been-wife. Being married under a false identity is somehow frowned upon." Holding Sherlock's hands in his, he smiles the most luminous grin. "And you know what? I realize something."
"Are you sure about that, My'?" Greg was keeping his husband close to his chest. "It's dangerous..." He was confident in all the preparations they had made over the last weeks, but nonetheless, it was a risky mission.
"It's only the biggest and most important day of your life, don't panic." Mike jokes, trying to enlighten John's mood. At his friend's dubious look, he repeats, "yeah, it is! You are marrying the person that you love and care about most in the world."
Finally fully awake by the horrible sound of his own screams, John pulled away in panic. “DON’T TOUCH ME!”
“How am I, really? Except for a few bruised ribs, a sprained shoulder... Really shouldn’t be here.” He smiles obliquely, “By the way, I told you that I didn’t need to file a complaint against Bidget, hope he’s feeling as bad as me!”
"What are you talking about?" They jump as the voice, from the man they were plotting - not against, let say for - resonates in the lab an hour later. "You look really smug, both of you."
And of course, what that little shit did is unacceptable and Sherlock should say something to Kings' security! It's sexual assault.
Forgetting his sister’s dire situation for the moment, a burst of annoyance mixed with an absolutely unrequited excitation took all the place in his mind.
Putting back the phone in his pocket, a bit afraid of knowing if Sherlock was going to x-kiss him back or not, John rushed to the nearby Tube station.
"I don't know why you wanted to come here," John complains as the number of party goers rises exponentially as they walk down Westminster Bridge.
Curious, the doctor asked as if it was a spur of the moment question when he actually thought about it since he arrived, “yes, maybe. I’ve seen pamphlet about vampirism in the reception room, do we take care of them also or is it only to help your clients on how to deal with them?”
A little smile on their lips, Anthea and Mycroft exchange a glance as they both read the transcript of the discussion on their respective phones.
Sherlock, not willing to let it go that easily, asks petulantly, "what do I get in return for playing your errand boy, brother mine?"
Thinking quickly, he improvised. “Easy. I observed. You sometimes look as if you are forgetting something. A walking-stick. You are clearly favouring one leg over the other sometimes but can remain standing in front of a class without looking for a chair or sitting at or on the desk. So, psychosomatic. Don’t be shy about it, PTSD is hard... even for doctors.”
“True, you are really good at getting but not really good at keeping,” one of his army mates chuckled before Murray quickly slapped him on the shoulder.
“Yes, don’t worry. I’ve got a room in the hotel next door and I won’t bring any psychopath or not-born-in-the-right-century man with me!” She chuckles, clearly a little sloshed, but adds seriously “Thanks again for what you did for me earlier ...”
"It's a miracle, you can let that man get away now, you realize?" Stamford's soft confident smile was the last push John needs.
Lost in his thoughts, John never realizes that students were flooding his classroom. The murmurs, the questioning look, the giggles from the female students... all that stops when Sherlock enters the room and drops into his usual place, Alan in tow. The silence persists as minute went by, the students eagerly waiting for Watson to say a thing, for William to exchange a heated gaze with the older man, for anything! As their teacher remains unaware of them, a young man on the first row clears his voice. “Sir? Are you all right? It’s five past ten and...”
"Invigorating... What a nice way to put it, My'." Greg tone was definitely flirty as, now that Sherlock was stable and on the road to recovery, they felt more inclined to return to the intimacy of their relationship that had been neglected over the last months. "Tell me... are you really that hungry?"
“This won’t do, Moran, he’s mine,” Moriarty muttered, glaring at the gloriously happy couple on a monitor. “He's going to be mine or he’s going to die.”
At six, Sherlock was already at Baker Street, trying to put everything in its place to calm his nerves.  As his lease on Montague Street was coming to an end, he decided to move in any way even if he doesn't find a flat mate.
“I presume that you want news about your... friend?” Mycroft says, with mirth in his voice, stopping Sherlock’s wool-gathering.
“Bloody know-it-all! Who knows the capital of Bangladesh anyway!” Anderson sniggers, looking at the surveillance camera they discreetly put in the pub.
“I,” he pauses and murmurs, knowing that it was definitely a bit not good to make the suggestion, “I can offer you a substantial amount of money --“
“Ohhhh that is so sad.” A slightly drunk Molly was on the verge of tears. “But do you like him? Maybe he’s looking for you? It's a man, right? What his name?”
A calm smile on her face, Ms Hudsons hugged her friend again. “I know what it is, you are neither crazy nor violent.”
"Who knows, the fright of seeing me again could spontaneously cure your psychological limp!" Handing a slightly abused mug to John, he looks at the man trying to deduce what was new since... since that night. "If you want to talk to your therapist before moving with me..."
“I seriously hope that the boss took some pictures, if he was gagged, I may even put it as my screensaver!” Sally chortles, motioning the medic towards John.
John was quickly losing it, thrashing from one side and another, when a hand finally engulfs his cock. “Oh Gooood, yes!” But it wasn’t long before he realizes the hand wasn’t moving. Not moving at all! Understanding that the detective wants to go slow, he sighs, pressing a kiss into the mass of chocolate curl. “Brilliant man... You’re right... Go slow... Do as you wish... I want to come with you inside... I want us to become one...”  Sherlock caressed him lightly one last time before turning the shorter man on his stomach. “Oh Sherlock... more... yes... God... yes...” Pushing him slightly on the bed to restrain him to hump on the mattress, his friend's precious lips start kissing, biting and licking a path toward John’s perfectly round buttock.
"I don't know." The sound of the detective's voice was now partially lost as his arm was now covering his mouth.
“No, don’t be silly. I will take care of it myself.” Picking up his bag, he places his hand on the door handle, “stop the car, I’ve got enough of you playing the good older brother.”  The car stops a minute later.
He discreetly spotted a few military men at the back of the pub, unable to read more about them because of the low lighting. Even if the uniform were less theatrical then a century ago, it was always a sight to be reckoned with. Something about the power, the control, the will to follow or give orders. The routine, the strict precision of it… He sighed as fond memories surged in his mind.
"No, but I presume it won't be long before we find out. My men are outside, Anthea is checking the CCTV --"
John’s exasperation quickly rises now that he knows that the ‘kidnapper’ wasn’t a drug dealer and that his life isn’t in any danger.
"Oh... look who's talking! As if --" John regrets the words the moment they leave his mouth. "Harry... sorry!"
"No, not him, you are really not that quick for a DI, Greg." She smirks, with a glint in her eye. "WE are going to reply for him!"
But he knew that it was more than that. So much more than that. Opening his closet, he sighs at his limited options.
Sliding next to John and changing his longer stride to match John’s shorter one, he murmurs in his ear, “they are going to say, ‘You are going to meet the love of your life today’.”
“Yes, more reasonable, of course.” John smiled, holding the man closed, knowing that it was a bit soon to talk about becoming a vampire himself.
me, 'Sherlock'!", the air quotes around his name nearly visible in a word bubble over his head. "What the Hell? Is this a game?"
“Sure deal, mate, that a little gem that stuff. Perfect for stressed out students or anyone who wants to forget their life for a while!” Suddenly, Sherlock is sure that it was the voice of one of the men in the lab!
Rushing to his bedroom as fast as he could, he opened his wardrobe and opened a panel to reveal a secret compartment.  Finally catching his breath, he checked that his military medals, dog tags as well as his sidearm were still there.
“The case of the ‘Never been kissed detective’ of course! Maybe you should write an epilogue to your post, so people know that the place is taken...”
He was lighting a cigarette when his phone emits a light buzz, looking at the screen as he turns to face his prisoner, he lets go a dark laugh that chilled John to the bone. “Oh, poor man, you’re also a friend to one of those junkies... Or more precisely, you
Sherlock smiles at her constant babbling, “of course I am, you don’t need to –“ but his protestations were cut short by Alan stepping near them after jumping out of his bus.
he grabs Harry and Clara by the arms and puts on a happy face. "Come on, beautiful ladies, your carriage awaits!"
"So... If I commit suicide, you are going to keep that story out of the press and... what? Carry on with the charade of domestic bliss?"
Sherlock is on his phone, a bit angry. "Mycroft! Your man never showed up! I am turning for no reason in a stupid Ferris wheel while scantily clothed women scream at me from the other pod!" He turns away from the window - to the dismay of the young ladies - just to find out that the pod on the other side is also full of young, very drunk professionals.  "You asked me to arrive at 11:30, which I did, told me that the man was going to be right behind me, which he did not. I've met my part of the bargain, I'm going to get out as soon as this glorified bicycle wheel comes to a stop! And you are still going to take care of Mummy's presents!" Angrily, he closes his phone.
Opening his laptop, he checks his emails, replies to a few students then tries again to find something new about the drugs trafficking at Kings. He has befriended as many professors and employees as possible in the Chemistry and Medicine faculty without finding something definite.
In the last days, their flat add been raided by secret services thoroughly before he was allowed to go back to take his things - he didn't want to stay at the place anymore - and he went through many hours of questioning, psychological evaluations and signed an overwhelming amount of forms. Greg, still a good friend and privy to most of the story, stayed with him all that time but remained silent every time John asked questions about Sherlock's condition.
"Right, but at some point, he's going to know! Anyway, we are not there yet..." His eyes glued on the screen he continues "I've been celibate for quite a while now because my lifestyle does not suit everybody." Greg chuckles,
Unaware of the starring role he was having in his flatmate dream Sherlock was sleeping on the sofa when his phone rings. (Bien sûr! it's only a dream, naughty readers! Sherlock won't take advantage of his drunk friend like that, shame on you!). Holding it in front of his eyes, he quickly replies. “Lestrade... it’s better be... WHAT! On my way!” Rushing to his bedroom to wake John, not noticing that the bedspread he placed over his friend was now in disarray as well as John's blissful expression, he shouts while placing a coffee on the nightstand before opening the window to let the sun in. “JOHN! Quick! A crime scene!!”
need to go to sleep..." He abandoned John in the bathroom and poured a tall glass of water with two Paracetamol while thinking about the soft look his friend has when he's drunk.
“Oh... I see,” the big man pats his young friend hand, winking, “A bit nervous, yes, yes, I’ll get you a beautiful Chianti and a nice candle or two, more romantic –”
"Too bad  we weren't able to hear what they said," one secretary sighs, "it looked really romantic!"
Let me know if you decide to move back to London for good, I'll hook you up with that man from Bart's. MS
Satisfied and nodding to himself, John closed his laptop and looked around him for a little treat to celebrate. But the flat was bare of good chocolate, bearable alcohol or tolerable tea.
“Yes, it’s better now, I think. Maybe I’m better at all this the second time around,” not wanting for John to elaborate, he quickly starts to talk about his little verbal joust with Holt and his TA, the work he was doing with his new friends, and the time passes again easily.
John is helping Sherlock to stand up and they are about to walk out of the pub when the police finally arrive.
The first part of the day went as the detective expected. First, a boring Chemistry class where Sherlock had to literally write down the periodic table in a dozen of languages to stop himself from insulting Holt in front of the class. Secondly, lunch time with the few students he gravitates around then a study session at the library. Beside the fact that the case was never far in his head, the whole experience was... pretty normal. It is  a surprise for Sherlock to have what can be called ‘friends’ or even ‘fans’. It wasn’t like that the first time around for sure!
Also, this is a bit trickier, and understand that it's nothing to be worried about. But, yesterday - wanting to understand why he was pulled by the few things he knew about you - he suddenly decided to go to Yaverland. He's the man who stood in front of your house for a minute or so, before rushing away back to London, afraid of having acted like a fool.  He told us that you were with a woman and that you looked loved. He's sincerely happy for you I think, even if we are sad that he closed himself off again so quickly.
It wasn’t really what he wanted deep down, but he surely needs the money. He sighed melancholically.
chose to open to, the doctor even talked more seriously about the attack on his battalion, his wounded shoulder, the loss of friends. He never felt diminished in front of the fit and unmarred younger man. “I shouldn’t talk about this, it’s a bit of a mood killer. You are so young,” The doctor chokes a bit on the last word,
“As long as I am your sole subject, it’s all fine with me! I’m signing up for a lifelong study!” John, remembering the fake suicides and the cab driver asks suddenly, “and who’s the killer, do you have any idea?
"No, certainly not! Especially when he didn't really love the woman if yo want my opinion." He let go a small humpf, "just a rebound, when the loneliness is unbearable... hard to find something else when you've lost the real thing."
“Come on, man!” Greg is looking at the CCTV near Angelo, the wide angle allowing a good view of the street. Luckily, as it was a Wednesday, the area wasn’t as full of people as during a weekend. But Doctor Watson was nowhere in sight so far! He saw Sherlock walk inside the restaurant a few minutes ago, apparently nervous but with a resolute expression. “Where are you Watson! You have only a few minutes left!”
“Doctor Watson, you are here.” The detective remains stuck in place, not knowing what to do. Looking away at something further in the street he murmurs without really paying attention “you are late –”
"It's a blog, from a doctor... I was thinking about asking him about a peculiar gunshot wound as --" Molly stutters as she improvises.
Watson laughs loudly. “Do you know your brother at all, Sir? Even you don’t have authority over him, I guess!” Again, a light chuckle, quickly muffled, echoes in the otherwise deserted building.
"He was with me a few minutes ago and now..." his hand instinctively went to his pocket, only to finds out that his phone was missing! With a silent apology to his mother, he swears against his brother once more.
“John!” Stamford called from the bar. “How are you!” Quickly waving for the barman, he asked for another whisky for his protégé. “We need to celebrate! The second instalment of
Frowning, the younger man looks at Lestrade, completely clueless. "But... I don't understand. He married her, he loved her. John is loyal, he won't push the woman of his life for something from her past. Of course, working as a  mercenary is less honourable than being a soldier but..."
“Shut up! I don’t fucking care and – ”, the noise of a door opening stopped what was certainly going to be a harsh talk down as another man enters the room. “WHAT!”
, it's good for him this way. He needs to connect with someone, he was kind of always a bit melancholic when he stopped pulling women, I remember..."
“Sorry to say that he didn’t tell me his name,” the detective turns toward his left than right hand frowning at the handcuffs that still restrained his hands and feet. “Is this really necessary?”
Rising from the chair slowly, he looks away from the young woman not wanting to see the look of sympathy in her eyes. “I’m okay, I don’t need medical attention after all. You know where to find me officer, if you have any questions.”
"It's the man in front of me right now in the rain..." He tilts his head back, letting the rain washing away his doubts, his pain, his errors...
A few hundred kilometres away, Clara was now looking severely at Harry, shaking her head. "What have you done, Harry?"
And here he was, jumping out of a cab and running to the restaurant to charge into Sherlock who is exiting the place decisively!
"I know that you want to know what happened after we left each other last night..." He waits a bit, knowing that his friend will probably tease him relentlessly, and drinks his coffee silently for a minute. "I had to go to the hospital, you know... I couldn't just let him be there alone."
"Don't try to downplay it, John!" Harry argues with a small smile. "You were frantic! God, I even thought that you were having a panic attack or something. But no... it was more of a heart attack!" She playfully winks at her wife.
Angelo is suddenly there at his side, babbling away. “Sherlock! My friend, my saviour, I’m so please! Anything that you want!” Eying his glass, he glares theatrically, “pfff!!! Water, let me get you wine, I’ve got a nice –“
Sherlock, turning around to see if he can find something about Moran destination, shouts “One last thing.”  Appleton and McAlister halt as the policemen stop walking. “Who helped you? You are a bad chemist and a petty criminal... You can’t have pulled this together.  I know about Moran, who’s the real boss? I need a name, anything.”
“You were talking about the drugs, about the deal, in a park!” The other voice replies with authority, “totally unaware of that teacher behind you!”
If he accepts, let me know. It may be interesting." He was going out of the office when Stamford enters the lab.
Picking up his walking stick, he closes the door leaving the two women on their own.  He deeply loves them, but their little apartment was quite... little. It was cozy, but a bit modern for his taste and he never felt at home in it.
Muttering something about how blond, brown, red or black hair clearly all looks different from each other on a black and white photograph,
Sherlock, with help from John, finds the link between the two victims (even though at first, John is somewhat disappointed that the detective didn’t tell him about his friend).
The impact of a bullet against his bulletproof vest that pushed him to the sandy road finally brought him back to the present moment. Fighting to get his breath back, the blow thou not fatal still hurt like a bitch, he turned on his belly and started crawling away while staying out of the range of the gunmen.
You have probably been swamped with hundreds of messages, way more interesting than ours, but... we just want to say that he was also 'the' anonymous who left you a message on your blog. It seems that he saw your blog when he came into the office and wasn't able to get it out of his head. So this part is solely his. He talked to us an hour ago, ashamed of himself, saying that it wasn't his usual behaviour to think about things like stars and such and even more not his style to actually talk about it, especially to a stranger!
“Like the idiots who died from it.” They both chuckles as if it was a good joke, not thinking about the destruction their drug trafficking was causing. After a moment, they carefully walk to the door and – after a quick look around, making sure that the corridor is deserted – they walk away.
"No, she's going to her brother's house in Bournemouth, and I'm going to be on call for emergencies anyway." Christmas was going to be a small affair and it was perfect for John. "Don't worry, I'm going to be fine. A nice fire, a book, music... I don't need more."
“I’m not worrying, what a arse!” Looking in the mirror, she sees that her date was screaming and raising his fist in the air. “He’s really angry...”
Rising quickly from his chair, Mycroft steps from behind his desk and walks rapidly (not running, it’s undignified) to the media room. And here he was, still in the middle of nowhere, looking at his surrounding and looking a bit lost.
“I missed the last one, come on mate! I really need help!” Ogling Sherlock’s body he mutters, “I won’t be... ungrateful.”  Suddenly, without further warning, he pushes the detective to the wall between two rows of lockers and shoves a hand in his pants. His fingers touching the detective’s cock without hesitation, clearly demonstrating how he plans to repay the service. “It could be beneficial to both of us.”
"Oh, your page was open on a colleague's computer." He tried to remember what Molly told him. "Ah! Yes, in fact, she wanted to ask your opinion about some gun shot wounds or something. She's a pathologist."
"We are both adults, we can get over this... We... We slept together one night two years ago. As you said, it shouldn't change anything. I am willing to try if you are."
She shrugs into her coat, holding her phone as if she's been contacted a minute before. "It's an emergency! I need to check a contract for a foreign client..." She turns to her wife for support.
Sherlock’s mind was fleeting away, cataloging the sensation for future (unknown) use. He was nearly unconscious when a voice resonates in the alley. “Hey! What are you doing? STOP THAT!”
“You don’t know him... McAlister, he’s the devil... You don’t want to go against him!” The sound of a bag being dropped on one of the table echoes in the otherwise empty room. “Here’s the next delivery, do as you told and everything is going to be fine.” After a pause, where probably both men simply challenge the other, Watson and Sherlock catch the unmistakable rustle of the exchange of money. “Listen to me, don’t do something stupid or you are going to end up dead.”
“You are lost in your mind, John,” Stamford teased, “thinking about a lady?” The wink that followed was one of the worst attempts of a wink in the bar’s lengthy history.
Looking at the young man with worry, he argues while still trying to get his thoughts together and thinking that the shots were definitely too much! “but, I need to go with him!”
“PHILIP!” Sally shouts before Greg had the time to say something, she is definitely feeling guilty for what she said to Watson, “that’s enough!”
"Is it still raining?" letting go John's hand a second, he pushes his wet locks away from his eyes with a sweet smile. "John... I've loved you since the first second my eyes fell on you."
small, but the concept of being voluntarily that isolated was something that he wasn't able to understand. Far from cases, far from his favorite restaurants, far from Bart's, a nightmare!
Contrary to the feelings he felt last week, when he last uttered the two tiny words,  John didn't feel a hint of a doubt when he replied, "I do."
The class is over and most of the students are heading to the cafeteria or the library but Sherlock, able to escape a little group of new ‘fans’ after a flimsy excuse to Alan, hides in a corner of the corridor and waits for Watson to exit his classroom. Uncustomarily, his judgment is clouded by his opinion of the man.
"You are clearly just back from Afghanistan with a wounded shoulder and a psychological limp, of course, you've got a therapist." Sherlock smiles, happy to be able to keep an upper hand on the discussion.
He was checking his vital signs when the blast of the exploding bus shoved him back to the ground again as the enemy released a new volley of machine gunfire. Using his body as a shield to protect the unconscious man, he nearly didn’t realize that a bullet entered under the edge of his vest, shattering his scapula until he saw the fresh blood running on his arm.
December 24th: The sky / It's Christmas Eve, the sky is wonderful and full of brilliant stars. I wish you all, where ever you are, a peaceful night.
Closing the door behind him, John steps outside closer to Sherlock. "I'm coming out then," waving a hand at Sherlock's concern, he repeats, "are you sure you are well enough to be outside like this?"
Greg, always a gentleman and wanting to support Molly, added, “and no way are we going to choose someone for you at the Ritz or the Criterion!”
Molly was still rambling at his side when something she said finally got through his thoughts. “What did you say? About a ‘parlour trick’?”
"I'm going to be honest, even if I am usually considered to be of striking appearance, my attitude has often been called a turn-off. Probably because I have a low tolerance for stupidity. So, if you are stupid, please do not contact me, If you have any doubt about your intelligence, don't bother."
Mouth agape and thinking that everyone was definitely winking way too much, his eyes narrowed on the cupid bow lips that were currently pouting as he talked to his companions.
He was about to say that all this was utterly stupid when his eyes locked with someone at the back of the pub.
Rolling his eyes at the inconvenient timing, Sherlock replies impatiently "It's better be impo -"  His beautiful face becomes radiant as an exhausted Lestrade explains why he called. "Where? Okay, we are going to be there in 15 minutes." Not explaining anything to John, he grabs his hand again and starts running in thedirection of Belvedere Road to get a cab; his imposing stature creating a path through the crowd, when the voice of the doctor stops him.
As the beautiful man turns on his heel, John protests. "What?? Is that it?" Stepping directly behind Sherlock, he places a hand on his shoulder. "Look at me! You are not pushing me away like that!" They were now only inches away.
“That, Sir, is none of your business,” John was fuming! “He’s an adult, a bit younger than me maybe, but nothing unlawful or unnatural—”
“You are a famous ANONYMOUS writer,” Mike stated, seriously, “does anyone know that you write? That you are the man behind John Baker?”
“Don’t fuss,” the detective mutters waving a hand in dismissal before replying to Lestrade who is asking for more details, “it’s just transport.”
John beamed at the sound of a helicopter, shooting to force a retreat from the Taliban, knowing that help was on its way. “Elliot, we are going to be okay, transport is here!” His patient head turned away from him, his cheek touching the warm sand. “Elliot, don’t do that to me man, I –“  Worried, the doctor used the hand of his unwounded arm to carefully remove his helmet and turned his face to evaluate his condition. “No, no, that’s impossible!” The captain recoiled in horror, not understanding what was going on. Instead of the pimpled face of his blond soldier, it was Holmes’ ivory skin and short black curly hair!
Nonplussed at the reason why John, having finally been able to keep a woman around him because he wasn't there to spoil everything wouldn't fight to keep her, the detective utters sadly. "Why?"
"Miss Morstan, I think it's better to stay out of this right now. This is between John and Sherlock."
"I can't believe I am saying that... but not everyone is looking forever after and commitment you know." She turns a nice shade of red and she had "Sometimes, just being in someone's arms for a while is nice."
Everything becomes a blur as Mary - in despair - shoots Sherlock while Simpson and Greg jump her.  John rushes to Sherlock's side and was quick enough to catch him before he fell to the floor. His hands full of blood, he screams at a paralyzed Mycroft "Call 999! or something better if you can!"
“Good, but don’t count on a make-out session in a booth or something, this is a formal vets’ social occasion after all.” After a small kiss, he placed his hands on the heavy collar of Sherlock’s cape and pulled it straight, making the perfect dramatic backdrop to the vampire’s striking figure. “Voilà! Now it is perfect.”  Hand in hand, they left the flat to slide into Mycroft’s car that was waiting in front of 221b.
“The boss,” the ex-military utters calmly without being able to completely hide his impatience, “in the car, the subject of discussion.”
"Thanks, darling..." Silently, the woman peruses Sherlock description before asking. "No picture? And is this a man or a woman? It's kind of unsettling don't you think?"
As Mycroft seems particularly eager to have him do this favour for him, Sherlock pushes his luck a bit further. "...and the next Mother's Day as well?"
Being confronted by that woman about his sexuality and his attraction to Sherlock was horrible, especially when he realized that his exasperated scream
Reply by Doctor John H. Watson: Me too. And next time that you want to talk to me, use the messaging thing. Don't want everyone to read us.
Remaining silent for a while, Sherlock finally acknowledges his brother's offer. "Thanks My', I will come to your home tonight, do not worry. I just need time to think... And tomorrow --"
Sherlock thought for the umpteenth time. To say that it wasn’t his usual scene was an understatement… and the happy-hour crowd did not help, at all!
“I was feeling a bit rejected when you went on cases without me while I was at work, I think we may be able to find a way to combine the two.”
The pub, a popular place near the university, is nearly full and the only place available is at the bar. But it is okay, the crowd is more prone to give them anonymity than a deserted place where their voices would resonate everywhere in the room.  After they receive their beers, Mike waits silently, looking at his friend with an open smile that screams
A happy smile on his face, John was waiting at the ferry's terminal in Ryde. The weather was fairly nice, even if it was colder than on the mainland, so he was standing outside looking at the sea. It was December 28th and, as planned, Harry and Clara were staying with him for the New Year. He was mentally creating a list of the things he needs at the grocery store when his phone pings joyfully. It was his sister, excited because the boat was near the island. He quickly texts her to resist and stay inside the boat as the temperature on the sea, with the wind and the spindrift, was a perfect way to catch a cold! Going inside the terminal, he sits near the exit, waiting for them while forwarding a few cases to his colleagues, as he had asked for the week off. His sister was a pest sometimes, he chuckles at the whole 'Let's put John on a dating website', but they are really close especially now that their parents were both deceased.
. "Do you think Mycroft can give her a new identity? A better one? Maybe she... maybe they could start anew away from London."
“No, I’ve got no idea at all...” Sherlock replies dismissively, surprised by the fact that it wasn’t currently the first thing in his mind. Turning towards John, he grins. “Are you hungry?”
"I won't talk to you about Sherlock... don't even try." The doctor was clinging to his wife like a lifeline.
“Great. It’s going to give me personal time where you won’t be able to spoil the end of my novel or finish the crosswords for me.”
The enthusiastic constant gibberish in the background of his mind finally stopped as his ‘friend’ halted in front of a door, switching back to English in regard to his visitor.
“No, and it’s better that way. When I am at work, I am a doctor. That’s all. Too many pitfalls come with fame.”
He is attached to a cold surface, concrete if he can trust the feeling under his feet. Trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible, he starts to pay attention to the voices around him as a few people are talking ten or twelve meters from him.
“No, nothing wrong with my little brother, Doctor, except the usual stubbornness, of course.” Mycroft small grin shows his affection for the younger man, “I only want a discussion with you, nothing to worry about.”
Putting down his buzzer - his table was about to win the Pub Quiz anyway – he follows the men discreetly with his eyes as they walk through the crowd to a little table in the corner. After a quick one-sided discussion with the couple who is drinking and minding their own business, they take command of the table, sit and wait
Checking his phone which is vibrating in his pocket, Mycroft sighs lightly. Greg is about to protest that they weren't THAT incompetent, when the government man turns away to speak into the phone “What do you mean, a brawl? With whom?” His voice turns deadly suddenly, “that little shit! And the ring leader was there? Do you have any identification?” He pauses a little, listening to Anthea’s report, “I see... No, don’t intervene until he’s in real danger... I don’t want him to be mad at me for interfering. Thank you, Anthea, call me as soon as something happens.”
Harry, as soon as the door closes, rushes to her home office with apologies that 'she must get on with her work!' When in fact, she spends the afternoon playing Candy Crush while sending Clara dirty texts.
"Better not!" the doctor snarls comically, trying to erase the sad look on his sister-in-law's face. "Talk to you next Saturday!"
“Willlllllliam! Are you all right?” It was Lucy, she spins around the detective, assessing his condition, “O-M-G! Are you hurt! When the fight started, I was so afraid that I wasn’t able to do a thing except calling the cops! Alan wanted to jump in the melee, but it was over so quickly!” Getting a grip on Sherlock’s bag, she says as she transfers it to her shoulder, “give me that! You must take care of yourself! Are you sure you’re fit to go to class?”
"Of course it wasn't pleasant! I wasn't there to do everything for him!" John laughs, even if concern about Sherlock starts leaking into his indignation at the sadness in Greg's voice. The vision of Sherlock, hurled on the church's floor, not moving, not even trying to protect himself...
Nodding at the cunning man, the detective replied before John was able to protest. “Thank you, Juan, this is perfect. But we won’t spend the night, we need to reach our destination as soon as possible.”
Closing his eyes, he remembered Sherlock’s expression when the blood started dropping. The lust, the hunger... A look he never seen in the vampire’s eyes since he had started to befriend him.
“I won’t,” the young man winks. “I’ve got a girlfriend for that!” Opening his computer, he continues to chit-chat without looking at Sherlock “And you?”
"I know it isn't what we planned, bro', but it's good, right? A little holiday in the big city!" Harry smiles sweetly, hugging her brother tightly. "The most important thing is to be together."
A few streets away from the grounds, his mind is still fighting away unwanted reminiscences of his Oxford years.
"I know, your sister knows big shots!" She laughs, thinking about the email she had received a few hours ago with the request of getting her brother to the London Eye at quarter to midnight. "Quick, John! We only have 10 minutes left!" Raising her eyes she spots an elegant woman with a little sign with their names on it. "Oh! It's there! Hi! My name is Harry Watson, and these are my two guests."
“Yes, sergeant, and in a surprisingly positive disposition if I recall what you said to him in that warehouse,” Holmes replies coldly.
With a last look at Greg, Mycroft strokes his brother hair slowly. "Yes, 'Lock, you can go back to Baker Street. Not right now, but tomorrow, I swear."
Looking in the mirror as he arranges his hair in a casual but neat manner, his own reflection becomes surrounded by dozens of
A little joyful commotion erupted in the pub when Stamford entered, as John’s college friend’s good and funny nature were appreciated by everyone.
Turning a bit to check his surroundings, John sighs as he sees William’s brother and steps out of the car, shaking his head.
“That class was dismissed 20 minutes ago...” The other students had tried in vain to get William’s attention, wanting to gossip about the fight, about Doctor Watson, but it was to no avail. He remained undisturbed, so they slowly left the class to go on with their day. Even Alan, late for a meeting with his tutor, had to leave his new friend behind. “The next session is after lunch, don’t worry you can stay here if you want.”
John winces at the term ‘normal’, the idea that someone could have been mean to the brilliant man in front of him was unbelievable! “You seem to have a good crowd around you know, you are quite the star in the Chemistry department,” John replies, trying to lighten the mood.
The news that he received last night, that the police weren’t able to find anything about Moran, wasn’t helping his mood
. He was still computing everything when John stops. Not realizing that the doctor was just there, Sherlock mind was still going on, adding a new range of emotions to his analysis.
His head falling on Sherlock’s chest, John started to play with his shirt buttons, opening then one by one as he murmured, “I would have let you, you know...”
Sherlock, not wanting to hear anything else, turns the communication device and – after sending a quick text to Lucy to postpone their meeting - he mutes his phone. Breathing slowly, he forces himself to walk calmly as he exits the building, his hands slightly shaking.
“It’s okay John, it’s break time, you don’t have to be Doctor John H. Watson every minute of the day, you know.” She went to get two fresh cups of tea, handing one to her new colleague. “So, is it a woman? Your girlfriend?”
Totally oblivious to the constant allusion, Sherlock frowned at the idea of putting on someone else’s clothes before he asked, “as for transportation –“
“Doctor Watson get in the car please,” the voice was warm but authoritative, as if talking to a child.
In fact, he said to the pathologist to go in the back seat to ‘let the man in front’ but Sherlock refused, stunned by the lack of gallantry.
that happened a long time ago affect my - our - life today..." He waves his hand dismissively, fixing the tea after he asks John how he takes his. "...but I totally understand if you want to turn and run away."
Thinking about the blog he saw on Molly's computer, he shivers at the thought of living on a small island. Of course, he knew that the Isle of Wight wasn't
Rolling his eyes, the detective laughs. “Pressing charges? If everyone pressed charges every time someone acted like a complete and utter moron, the courts would be overrun with idiots.”
Bing, bing, bing, bing... 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 emails! They finally stop after he receives a staggering 137 new emails.
In the detective's defence, the suite of three rooms - a small living including a desk and many books shelves, a bedroom as well as a bathroom - was more spacious than many London flats. Even if his brother rarely visits, for Holmes this space was his and only his. A safe harbour, a place where he can come at any time if the need arises.  A place where he could recover, if need be. Standing outside, still holding the case files in one hand, Mycroft knocks again with more force.
"Mary left the hall the minute I took you aside." As the doctor frowns, he repeats, "come with me. Please."
Not realizing that the void of the doctor's existence was echoing something deep inside him. That he was the missing link that the doctor needed was as clear as that the ex-captain was what Sherlock desperately searched for without even knowing it! Unable to go back to sleep now that the others tenants start to shout and bang around, Sherlock suddenly knew what he needs to do.
Except for divorced parents, alcoholic and violent father, now deceased, nothing out of the ordinary except...
"Thanks, dear. Now go do something... feminine and fluffy." Laughing, the woman rushes to the door after one last greeting to her boss and Greg. Mycroft was on the verge of taking the first sip of his coffee when his husband swears. "Gregory? What is it?"
"It's a crazy thing, that ex-wife of his don't you think? I've been with him a lot over the last days, carrying his things out of the home, bringing him in for interrogation at MI6... Really shitty situation."
Imagining a deep and silky voice, the only one that he can envision with such a suggestive body, John resolutely put down his pint. Nodding to himself,
Without realizing it, the constant fear that had been underlying his actions since he returned from war was replaced by anger.
Finally able to get the over-eager restaurateur/former criminal’s attention, the detective shakes his head, “no, Angelo, not wine, maybe later.  I’m waiting for someone and anyway I should probably go and –“
Doctor Watson,” rolling his eyes as if the mere concept of interrupting a lecture to say something that wasn’t a hard-cold fact was ridiculous, “but if you want
Mike, who was looking at the scene flabbergasted, places a comforting hand on John's shoulder and murmurs "Please come with me, John, you are too emotional right now... Later you --"
"John, are you all right?" To the doctor, the concern in Sherlock's smooth voice was the most erotic thing ever.
Even if his friend is only a bit more rested, he is painfully cheerful. He grins and winks, "hey mate, how are you? What a night!" The good night of sleep was the only reason why he is looking marginally better than his friend.
"Yes, maybe. But John won't be here to save you this time." She gloats as Sherlock realizes that she knew that John shot the cabby.
Feeling for the envelope in his coat pocket, he squinted his eyes to read the address, “yes, got something in the mail from Colombia.”
“Is he passed out?” The man that looks in command asks, the ‘Colonel’ as John was calling him in his head, “does he needs care?”
"Yes, Sir." The young woman smiles with affection. "I will, right now." She was leaving when she places a few envelopes on the table. "Oh, I forgot! Your personal mail! Simpson gave it to me."
Lost in the moment and barely able to think, John raised his hand to angle Sherlock’s head and deepening the kiss further, if it were humanly possible, when the detective stopped moving suddenly.
"Yes, no, maybe... I don't know!" John wasn't sure if he wanted to talk about the man he saw outside his house. For him, it was something personal, something for him only.
He knew that the idea of a relationship being 'comfortable' wasn't a peak of romanticism, but currently, it was good enough.
"Tomorrow, Baker Street. Don't worry." Holding Greg's hand, the older Holmes walks thru the door, sending a worried look behind him until the door closed.
Sadly, John picks up his cravat before mustering a smile that they both know is fake. "Being with Mary is the best thing that ever happened to me." He pauses, looking at his reflection in the mirror. "I love her and she loves me. And she wants all this, being a couple and everything, with me. I couldn't be happier."
“Ohhhhhh, a nice looking fella –” Stopping just before he speaks Sherlock’s name, the older man gives them a menu and another candle (He’s going to burn down the table!), winks again before he disappears into the kitchen.
Greg was sorting their luggage when the discreet knock they agreed on (two knocks, a pause, then two knocks, and then a single one) made him rush to the door. Mycroft was there, in one piece and now dressed as a waiter, pushing the breakfast tray. After the door was closed, the DI whispers between kisses, "are you okay? Is he okay? I was so worried!"
"Sherlock, say something." Mycroft was looking at his silent brother anxiously. He was fully dressed, a regular occurrence since he was feeling better, pacing slowly in the living room. "I know it's a shock..."
But how can he when he has kept one too many secrets - the secret about Sherlock's 'death,' from the one person he has ever had feelings for,,,
“I just want to know how things are going, brother mine, just that.” He motions to the space beside him, “please join me, would you?”
Laughing softly, nearly lovingly, the criminal drops his smile mockingly, “But Sherlock, it was a gift... I know that you love a good drug!”
John, nearly out of breath again at the sudden appearance of the beautiful man, stutters “William... shit... erm... Sherlock.”
"Think about him. I know."  The idea of Sherlock being held prisoner and probably questioned by unsavoury criminals was too horrible to imagine! "But to think about you... there."
Stifling a groan, he sits in a place where he was able to see everything. Everything except the altar. The altar where John was waiting for her. For
Her cheeks turn slightly pink, she admits having an alert on Sherlock’s blog. “To know if he talks about... unauthorized things, you know.”
He was pondering what he should do next when someone knocks on the door. Pasting a polite smile on his lips, he shouts a light, "come in!"
Once at the door, he knocks softly and calls out for his potential flatmate. "Sherlock? It's me, John, can I come in?" As the door was already slightly ajar, he enters calling the name again... right before his world shifts at the view of the man in front of him.
Unconsciously he tries to put some order in his hair as if the doctor was about to enter the room. “What did you say?”
He is about to simply walk away when his phone vibrated, thinking that it was William, he grabs it quickly.
"Isn't it perfect!?" Harry was grinning like a fool, getting out a tissue to wipe the tears from Clara's face.
The detective and their host were walking a few meters in front of him. He presented himself to John as Juan before turning to Spanish to talk animatedly with the detective.
"No, I'm done here... let me grab my coat." As Donovan nods a last salute and rushes outside her boss office, Greg shakes his head. "Don't be so hard on her, I think that she realizes how easily Anderson and her fell for Moriarty's master plan. She's trying to change her but she's hated your brother for so long, it's hard."
Not listening to John anxiously screaming at him to wait, Sherlock runs like he had never had before, sliding on the damp path, full of fallen leaves and small broken branches.  The tombstones were the only obstacles to his will to get the maximum of distance between him and John.
He was trying to fit a 26 letter name in 20 little boxes when Sally drops her phone on the paper. “What do you –” the DI’s eyes widen as he starts reading Sherlock’s blog,
John, picking up his walking stick, rises silently and moves out of the view of the camera without a word.
with tea and your favourites, gingernuts." With a last look upon his now calm brother's face, Mycroft rushes to the kitchen.
"It looked… weird… seeing him plotting in a bench near Kings after what happened...." Turning his head in the direction of where McAlister's voice was coming earlier, he adds, “You know that your
“Hey John!” Mike is walking like a man on a mission! “Moira is at home with the kids, a friend of her is there to watch a stupid romcom so I’ve got the whole evening! It’s time for a few pints!”
“Don’t worry, I am not that stupid anymore.” Opening the door, he flew toward the nearest tube station.
“So, we have all the time in the world, right?” She smiles at him as she pulls out her notebook and pen. “First things first, could you please repeat your name and what’s your relationship with the young man? Do you know the men who assaulted him?”
Not listening to Sherlock’s protestations, the doctor smiled knowingly. “You know, I think I found what it is.” Using his unarmed hand, he softy played with the luscious curls absently, murmuring as if he was talking to himself, “all your schemes to look unsuitable, the hundred texts, the jealous looks directed at my boss, the boorish attitude over the last days, leaving me all alone in that cemetery...” After a pause, John kissed the vampire delicately, “I didn’t say thank you for saving my life. Thank you.” He kissed him again and whispered, “thank you.”
“Don’t touch anything, you know... fingerprints and everything.” He shows his phone playfully to his lecturer. “I’ve texted a friend that I’ve got in the police, he’s going to come discreetly to check for fingerprints, that sort of thing.” He can’t tell him that he is working with the police, not until the case is closed, or at least not until Watson’s role in this was made clearer. “Should be here within 15 minutes... You can go if you want, I’m going to wait for him.”
"John..." Harry was looking at her brother, frowning. "you must do something." Even with the blurriness of the webcam, he looked awful. "Have you been sleeping? You need to take care of yourself!"
Clara suddenly takes over from her wife. "I know that nature is gorgeous on the Isle of Wight, but it must have few good pubs or clubs somewhere? And don't talk like that to Harry, she's doing really well!"
True, and I’m still rooting for him as your in-law lol Are you keeping an eye on him? In case, you know, it turns sour. GL
"I'm fine, it was spectacularly superficial." He shrugs his shoulder, not wanting to elaborate on the extent of his injuries
His aversion to Professor Holt makes him want the pompous arse to be guilty, but he needs proof! He was nearly there, he knew it! The number of emails that Holt and Smith exchanged was abnormally high, compare with what the other students exchanged with him during the same period. It was apparently innocent, talking about research and so on, except for the high number of emails.
Remembering the way William walked close to him, until they nearly touch, when they were in the lab. The way his hand gently covered his mouth, John nods. “So, you talked to him quite often?”
December 13rd: Drinks / Went out for a pint with some people from work. It was nice to be surrounded by people until it wasn't. Nobody talked about my leg.
Sniggering at the thought of CCTV following John everywhere, he admitted, already vanquished, “it surely would be more... convenient... for your protection if you were here.”
Sherlock was walking along the Thames, not wanting to be at his flat. The temptations that were so readily available to him were not conducive to staying clean in his current mindset.
Laughing, Watson nods. “Yes, we’re right... we shouldn’t... it’s unwise to do so.” His boss’ warnings were flowing around him, but it was so hard with William right in front of him.
Turning back to his paperwork, the DI never realized that the level of excitation was rising on the floor until people start shouting.
Thinking about last night, when the DI had spent a few hours with his restless brother, Mycroft sighs.
"And you saw him here also, that is really weird!" Harry was dumbfounded by the whole affair. "Is he a stalker? Do you know him from uni or the army or something?" She was suddenly worrying a bit because she actually put a link for her brother's blog...
The door opens a little, just enough to let Stamford in but blocks out his rowdy kids. "Sorry, John, they are overexcited!"
Laughing, Harry pushes her brother playfully. "You need help sometimes, that why you have a big sister!"
Not arguing about the statement, Sherlock asks worryingly "Is something wrong with John? Or with Ma -- " he choked on the name. "... Or with that woman?"
He was starting to get cold, his scarf and hands in his pocket weren't enough to keep him warm, but it was better than any of the alternatives. He grunts at the thought of being at home with his parents and Mycroft... His brother insisted, of course, but he wasn't in the mood for it.
"Why do you want me dead? I'm not a threat for your life with John, he clearly doesn't want to talk to me anymore -"
December 24th: The sky / It's Christmas Eve, the sky is wonderful and full of brilliant stars. I wish you all, where ever you are, a peaceful night.
Reply by Harry: It's okay! I want the 38 inhabitants of your little village to know that you are looooooooooved. xoxoxo
"It's all right, Sergeant," Holmes interrupts coldly "you weren't invited anyway so you needn't worry." In fact, Mycroft was the one who made sure that she was working that night... as he knew that it was going to be hard for his fiancé to invite his whole squad with the exception of Donovan. "Gregory, are you ready to go to lunch or do you prefer if I come back later?"
John, follows close behind still confused as ever. "What are you talking about... where's Mary? I won't go anywhere until someone explains what's going on!"
. He shrugs his shoulders, "but for now it must do, I don't have enough money for something nicer, even if a woman I know is willing to give me a nice price on something really central."
He was leaving but stops when Greg adds slowly, "he's been with us since we came back from our honeymoon..."
Angelo discreetly sent his staff away a few hours later, leaving the cleaning of the dining room for the next morning, when it was obvious Sherlock and John were going to close down the restaurant.  Dimming the light a bit more than usual, he remains in the kitchen, singing a silly romantic song in Italian.
As he was looking around, his eyes fluttered at the view of a curvaceous blond woman, when Stamford discreetly nudged him in the direction of the pub entryway.
He was deep in his thoughts, trying to find the will to go on, when a mocking tone brought him back.
A shiver of disgust ran thru his spine at the idea. He had done it decades ago, of course, but the interaction needed to do it still left a bad feeling in his mouth.  As he was against violence, he used to simply ensnare his chosen ‘victim’… with the obvious disadvantage of having to deal with them until his voluntarily boorish attitude finally broke the spell.
“That we thank him for his help, that you were not severely injured, and he should expect you to be back to class in two days.” Texting Anthea, he asks about the doctor’s whereabouts and chuckles at the response. “He’s in the cafeteria drinking bad coffee right now.”
“No! You need to bring it to me –“ the noise of someone taking the phone stopped his sister’s supplication.
“He didn’t want to be a part of it, didn’t want to give the whole recipe,” Sherlock continues, “so that poor excuse of a man decided to cause the academic fall of the young prodigy.” Opening his phone, he shows him screenshots that we was able to get his hands on, “a little anonymous message in the Facebook page of the Chemistry students association about how Smith research wasn’t that original – which was taken down after a day – was enough to convince him to work with you. In academic research, your name is everything.”
Looking at the women who were now chasing each other in the kitchen, a little burst of envy hit him suddenly.
The Skype window turns black as the Londoners quit the conversation. John, lost in his thoughts, steps outside his little house and walks slowly in direction of the sea.
Checking the kitchen door to be certain that Sherlock wasn't within earshot, he murmurs roughly, "you weren't at the stag night... he talked about Sherlock the entire time! His eyes... My', it was so fucking sad."
A blissful state of peace appeared on his face as he remembered Sherlock’s last smile yesterday, right before he left him.
He was lost again in his thought, counting the number of flowers he was able to see through the window panes first then at establishes how many shades of pink were present -
“Is this too obvious and easy?” The vampire looked at himself in the mirror over the mantle, unsure of his choice of costume. He knew that John was watching him carefully but didn’t dare to turn, a bit afraid that he would make fun of him.
“I do not know you, you don’t know me, I don’t know where we are going… I don’t even know your name!”
Not paying attention to the whereabouts of the people around him in the busy establishment, he thinks about what he learned today. First, a young brilliant Chemistry student apparently committed suicide two years ago with what he now knows is a drug that hit the streets only in the last year.
His eyes slowly adjusting to the lack of light, he sees that it is really only a basically furnished lab. With laboratory tables, cupboards, a few Benson burners... He was about to get out to switch the lights – he isn’t able to see where Watson disappeared to – when the noise of a key turning in the door forces him to retreat quickly! Rushing to the back of the room, he opens a tall cupboard, thankfully only holding lab coats and a few brooms and was able to shut it down just as the silhouettes of two men appear in the light coming from the corridor.
"Maybe you should find a flatmate?" Mike asks, wanting to help while thinking of who he knows that may need a flatshare.
. He gently knocks on the door again, turning the knob to realize that the bathroom was empty. "John? Where are you? Are you all right?"
“Hampstead Heath, I think.” Anderson replies, sniggering, “the man isn’t as stupid finally, good call to run away from --”
Feeling a bit claustrophobic, John, after his bed is set up in the sitting room, tells his sister-in-law of his intention to go for a walk.
"It's okay Molly, he's right... I wasn't acting like myself. It's ridiculous!" He jumps from the chair, standing tall. "I'm over this now. Yes. Over." Shaking his head, he laughs at his own foolishness. "Oh God, I was so stupid... How could... Can you imagine! And replying to his blog! Talking about stars! I'm so ashamed... Please erase everything that I said in the last hour!"
"Really interesting fellow, even if he's a bit peculiar! He was looking for a flatmate, maybe I can put in a good word for you!" Mike smile drops a bit as John shakes his head.
“Yes, I think so, weddings are insane, if you think about it. She’s been on edge for weeks...” He turns to look at his wife, who was talking with her friends on the other side of the room. “The honeymoon is going to put everything back to normal!” Sniggering, Sherlock swiftly picked up his whisky-sour to hide his smile. “Oi mate! You are alone, so you can’t say a word about others who are in a happilyeverafterrelationship!”
The noise in the room rapidly died down as the hundred or so students stop talking and moving around. The man surprisingly, as he wasn’t that imposing, generates instant respect.
He knows that arguing wasn’t in his best interest, but he was unable to stop himself! “No... I’m not, but –“
The evening was going nicely. They eat, talk and relax. Exchanging news about their life, funny things about patients, clients or bosses. Harry, with a bit of mirth in her eyes, asks about Sara. John sadly kills her hopes by saying that finally, it was already over.
"MI6, why?" Sherlock asks, not happy about the stress that all this brought to John. "He's not the culprit here!"
“Look around you, Doctor Watson, do you see anything unusual?” Without being able to stop himself, John turned his head slowly, checking his surroundings.
"Come in, young man, come in." She closes the door as soon as he passes her flat. "Sherlock is upstairs, waiting for you." She nods in the direction of the stairs. "Hope you don't mind the steps, with your leg and all... I'm the landlady by the way. Ms Hudson. Go, go!" With one last conspiratorial smile, she turned and entered her flat humming softly to herself.
December 26th: Sorry / Really sorry for last night rambling. I think that... Christmas, you know. It's not easy right now. I think about how special Christmas was when I was in the army. The other medical team, the soldiers, it was like a big family. It wasn't special and extraordinary, it was the sum of a lot of small things. The excitement of expecting something from home, the camaraderie between us, a special meal - not from a tin, thank you very much - at the mess. A bit of music and fun to forget for an evening the horror outside of the camp. Right. That's cheerful. Apologies to my 2 readers. 3 if I count 'anonymous' from the other night.
“No, no... God... I don’t know why I dated that man. The first few times we went out, he was nice. In a traditional-woman's-place-is-in-the-kitchen-romantic kind of way.”
Leaving him to his rest after he gives him the generic non-addictive painkillers, the government man left the pile of cold cases on the nightstand near the untouched muffins and fruit.
The sympathetic man waves a hand as to say 'don't worry, you can have your little secret' before his eyes fall on John's blog. "Hey! I didn't know you knew John Watson?"
"Oh!" Turning to check the church door, as if she were expecting Sherlock to just barge in at any moment, "and what did he say?"
"A date?" the doctor laughs merrily at the madman. "We don't know each other, I didn't even know your name, and you want to go on a date?"
Lestrade, curious and a bit nervous for Sherlock, grabs a chair to sit in front of the screens. “Do we have any idea where is going?”
The idea that he may wish for their happiness for the sake of it never crossed his mind neither the fact that Molly was like a little sister to Lestrade.
“Yes, me too.” Thinking about his sister’s reaction to the news of the beautiful man’s particularity, he remained silent on the vampire business.
“No, maybe a TA or a post-doc student at Kings. Face is a bit familiar, nothing more.”  Suddenly thinking about the other prisoner, he point a door far away in a corner, “they have someone else in a –”
“Twitter!” Donovan sputters, “it was on Twitter. He read the first line on a public screen at Kings than walked away. He’s been walking since then without taking his phone out.”
The first thing he remembers is the absolute silence, as the loud explosion completely deafens him for a moment. Automatically, adrenaline kicking in, he turns towards the men and women of his small expedition group to check if everyone is okay. Helping one to get to cover, pushing on a wound to keep the blood loss to a minimum. Pushing with one hand.
"Yeah, you know... If it's going really terribly, it's just a drink so it's not too long and we'll be able to laugh about it the day after in the break room."
“Yes, yes, I’m going to be ready on time.” The man murmurs clearly without paying attention. But remembering Mike's wedding when Molly was fussy about the colour of his tie and pocket handkerchief he asks with a smile “Any colour that I should avoid?”
I trust Mike's judgment, he's a good down to earth guy. If he said that we can get along without killing each other, I believe him.
“It’s only that we think that he didn’t read –”, one detective explains before a colleague interrupts him.
Opening his computer, he waits for the internet to kick in - the bandwidth was abysmal in this part of the island - pondering about what the heck he was going to write about.
As the woman was approaching Mycroft with a smile and an extended hand, Greg mutters, "Sometimes I'm a kind of afraid of what I've gotten myself into..."
"JOHN! What's the rush!" She asks, a bit confused by her brother's action. He was now looking around, a bit lost, his cheeks red. "Are you all right? Are you having a panic attack or something?" She slowly moves them toward the edge of the room where it was quieter.
“No, nothing like that,” unsure about what he can actually say, Sarah seemed nice, but she was his new boss after all. But today, he has been presented to one of the other doctors who was openly with another woman. Pictures on her desks and all. Not wanting to start his first day with lies and unashamed of Sherlock, he said proudly. “I was thinking about a man I hope will want to become my boyfriend, it’s pretty recent but… I think he’s the right one for me.”
, John turns around to look at his so-called friends "Is it just me, or you all don't look surprised that he's alive..."
“And never again,” Sherlock drops his mouth on John’s, rejoicing at the thought that they had a second chance. Everything was better now! The lights of the street were brighter, the case was more exciting, the air was different. The fear of being rejected again disappearing in John’s warmth. Opening his lips, he accepts his lover’s deep kiss joyfully. The intimate exploration driving him mad as he was unable to silence the humming that was coming from his throat, from his heart.
