Mycroft smiles and carries Crystal to the room. Everything is organised and labelled in neat groups. “There are human and vampire grade strengths of everything, ma’am.” He explains.
The man smiles and nods before standing from the stairs and walking outside, knowing Turk would follow.
John laughs quietly and heads upstairs to dress, and brings down the soiled duvet to put through the wash.
"Indeed...don't expect it to last." Mycroft replied. "I am surprised how taken he is with you...should we be expecting a happy announcement by the end of the week?"
Sky smiles and hands him Danny so she can hold Sophia. She hums and leads them into the house to Danny's room to put them down for a nap.
Udos nods. “Just don’t go overboard, or you’ll end up as wide as me.” He chuckles. He strokes Sherlock’s bump tenderly, “How are they feeling?” He asks.
"He's not upset with you. He's just embarrassed and he's worried that he's ruined everything with you."
John smiles softly and kisses her back. “I love you too, sleepy head. Come on, you’re the host.” He smiles softly.
"I thought you'd never ask.." John muses and pushes his big hard cock back into Mycroft. He groans as he fucks Mycroft hard. He moves Mycroft's legs up over his shoulders so he can go deeper and rub against all the right places inside Mycroft.
Sherlock heads over to Crystal and smiles. “How is everything coming along?” He asks softly. “Maggie’s having a nap with John before everything kicks off.”
“Mm I know. Soon. I think I’m onto something though. Look.” Magdala hands Camille a book about summoning spells. “See there’s a spell there that I think will work but we’re going to have to boost its power. I haven’t figured out what the boost is yet though. A ritual or a sacrifice.” She shrugs.
He pulls Sherlock out of bed and presses him up against the wall. He kisses him deeply and lifts him up, wrapping Sherlock's legs around him as he pushes into him.
Sherlock blushes and leans against John. "Mrs. Hudson.. I.. Ah.." He gets a bit flustered. "I proposed to John.."
“Oh.” John blushes a bit. “Practice I guess. He just needed to feel secure. When you cross his arms and fold his legs up like that it’s familiar to what being in the womb felt like. It’s safe. Helps to ground them. I’m sure he’s constantly around new people so it’s hard to feel like anything is stable.” He hums softly and pats Jared’s back gently after he drinks his whole bottle. Jared burps softly and cuddles against John. “Better?” John smiles softly down at the boy.
"We'll see." He pushes a large vibrator into John's prepared hole. He turns it on skipping the first the level all together. He slaps John's arse hard without warning as the vibrator works in him.
Greg smiles and takes John to where the others are. "Hey, Myc. Can you and Collin go lay with Sherlock? I need to make sure that John stays awake and he wants you both to be with Sherlock."
“Yeah. I can feel those two nervous in the other room. You can send them in if you want.” She smiles.
Greg let's out a half chuckle half small sob. He doesn't want to go back to their flat. He never wants to go back to that flat.
“Tell me.. Will I look like you? So big and round and pretty? I want to look like you. I want to be filled with babies. It’s all I’ve ever wanted. It’s the only thing I need. I crave it. I’m so empty, Violet. Tell me. How does it feel? How is it being full?” She purrs, rubbing Violet’s clit gently.
“I know. I’m just an idiot for letting this happen. That’s why I want Mycroft to do the missions. So our people don’t have to suffer like this anymore. So we can fucking live.” She growls. “I don’t want my babies to suffer like I have. Never. I’ll burn this whole planet and start over if I have to.”
“And you just feel so warm and wet around me, but it’s fair that we wait for Sherlock.” John moans as he’s spread wider by Sherlock. “How big are you going to make me, Locky?” He moans.
I can’t. I gave it to Mycroft. He asked for it, so I gave it to him. I can’t disrespect what he’s asked me to do. He’s my sire. -SH
Leona smiles. “Hi Margeret, I’m Leona. This is Luciel and Nathaniel, this is my my husband Dominic, and I’m sure you know Pythia and Diōnē.” She smiles, rubbing her stomach.
Mycroft sighs and kneels down in front of Camille, taking her hands. “Can you remember the first words I said to you after you changed me, Sire?” He asks softly. “I vowed to protect you. To serve you and your memory until the end of time. You don’t need to ask me if anything. I am asking you to allow me to serve you one last time, Sire.” He explains softly.
“What you just did is called projection. You thought about something you wanted to happen. You incisions it clearly with all of your sense. When we get back Crystal will be telling you all about the fantastic wet dream she had.” Maggie smirks.
Kia smirks and starts to pound him, making her cock thicker and longer knowing it would make Sherlock happier and she was the goddess of joy after all.
“In fact, I don’t Mycroft. If you have something regarding the matter, please tell me now. I trained you better than this.” Camille frowns. “What did Augustus do to you?” She mutters to herself.
“Good.” She smirks and slowly starts to thrust. “I also had them made to squirt cum. Real and fake.” She purrs and kisses her neck.
"Absolutely brilliant, babe!" Lucas smiles and picks her up, spinning her around. Sky giggles and holds onto him.
He relaxes his throat immediately, slipping deeper into subspace from the commands and firm grip on his hair.
"Lots of mates do it... If they're true mates. The Alpha understands that it's a joint bonding, and just signs the bloody paperwork so the government leaves them alone. I think... I'd be able to call you my mate. It feels right, saying it even now."
“Er... no. We’re going to fuck each other raw. Until we’re all too tired and too empty to fuck each other anymore.” Crystal giggles.
Collin moan loudly as Greg squeezes around his cock tightly. He comes hard and fucks him, pumping his cum deep inside Greg. He pulls out of him and pushes a thick deep plug into Greg to keep him open and his cum inside. "Fuck you're perfect. Brilliant." He pulls him close and kisses him deeply.
He swallows hard again, allowing his eyes to slide shut at the invitation. He shudders at the sensation of fingers behind his bollocks and bites his lip against a moan.
“Oh Dark..” Sky moans, eyes closed in pleasure. “Mm you’re doing so good. She can’t even think.” Darius praises.
John moans like a slut, swallowing around the man. He reaches out his hands to stroke two of the men's cocks.
Greg follows Camille into the office, keeping the cross over his chest and stays near the door. “John says you’re the leader here?” He asks.
He takes him upstairs to get dressed. "Do you want to go to the funeral?" He asks softly as he dresses him.
“Jesus.” Mycroft gasps and pulls out his phone, making a call. “Code white. Full force to the estate. I repeat Code White.”
Mycroft smiles and shuffles the cards before dealing them. “How has America been?” He asks. “Loud and noisy as usual?”
Mel blushes and nods. “Feels nice. Like to be fucked. Want more of it.” She smiles shyly, not noticing Greg coming over.
Udos smiles and kisses Sherlock softly, “you should be made King of the Gods, Saviour of all.” He hummed.
“John, dear, when your husband runs an international drugs and weapons transport ring you learn how to tell if someone’s hiding something very quick.” Mrs. Hudson smirks.
‘After a hundred years or so your body has adapted to the new way of life. Some get special abilities and talents beyond the regular you acquire at your rebirth.’ Camille hums.
John mutters something that even he couldn't discern and gave Mike one of those polite smiles you give when you bump into someone you vaguely remember at the grocery store.
"I know. You're doing so good for me, baby. Just a little more." She praises and adds a third finger.
“You can fuck me but I’m so tired. I’m going to sleep and you can fuck me all you want.” She mumbles, falling back asleep already.
Sky cries out as she’s filled with his cum, moaning loudly as she feels it shoot right up into her womb.
She whimpers, grinding against her. She pulls off her nipple for a moment. “Just need Mommy to talk to me.” She blushes, latching onto her other nipple.
“Because if we have can have sex anywhere, we will. And sometimes, we’re just not in the mood. Or maybe Kia will be there in her child form and even though we know she’s older, it’s not comfortable.” John explains softly.
“Mm, I think I should be the one thanking you.” He pulls out a hotel card and writes his room number on it. “Stop by tomorrow, yeah?”
He pulls back and smiles widely before taking John's hand and pulling him out of the crime scene to the car. He doesn't notice that the entire crime scene has come to a screeching halt behind them as they walk away.
John looked around. "You cleaned, too." He mused. "A for effort." He cut up his beef and savoured the taste. "This is really nice. Thanks, Sherlock."
Sherlock smiles. “A dildo and a vibrator. What at the same time?” He laughs, “strip.” He slurs, having not been this drunk in quiet a few centuries.
“Mm, hopefully different variations of Sean or it will be very confusing.” Sherlock teases, licking and sucking a hickey onto John’s bond mark.
"Mm stranger things have happened." She smirks as they make their way to the Farris wheel. "We're gonna have to get someone to open it up." Greg sighs looking at the closed signs.
Greg smiles and cups her cheek. “You’ll be a good leader. Your kind and fair and just.” He says softly.
Greg bites his lip and hums as he makes his skin too hard for Crystal to bite through. He moans and twists his hips to push further into her.
“I want you to make me look like John’s ideal shape. He is mine, he said so, so I want to be his.” Sherlock whispers. “I just don’t know what that is.”
Pythia gently feels Leona’s stomach, feeling the flicker of energy from her sister. She smiles softly. “You’re a perfect choice..”
“I fell asleep on the couch. He went out for a walk and got himself a date with a woman,” Sherlock hissed.
Sherlock pulled her to the dance floor. He pulled her close. "I'm going to tell you something important and I need you not to react."
Nina smiles as she runs to Sky, hugging her tight. Sky smiles and scoops her up, carrying her over to Danny and Colin.
Lydia moans loudly, pressing her breasts into his hand and rides him harder. "Fill me. Oh god please. Over and over. Knock me up constantly. I always want to be pregnant with your babies. Please." She begs. "Jesus. Just listen to her. You've don't that to her. You and your cock. You've turned her into this cumslut." Bryan smirks, fucking John harder and making Lydia bounce more.
Camille hums and thinks. “An intermediate would be good. Does everyone agree so far?” She asks, again daring anyone to speak against her.
She hums happily as she waits, bouncing a bit with excitement which also makes her tits and arse bounce as well.
Camille nods. “A ring would be easier to get ahold of. We’ll get Pythia to do everything.” She looks up at Sherlock. “You’re still invisible to vampires, shall I take that off?” She asks.
“Greg hates vampires. Camille hates humans. Crystal loves both. She saved Greg’s life even though it almost killed her. She served Camille dutifully since she was turned. The linchpin is that Crystal is in the wind. She’s the only one who can patch the up again. She’s the original healer.” Pythia sighs.
'You say that as if I don't have her already.' Tiger suddenly appears in front of Michael. Sky is kneeling at Tiger's feet naked and a collar locked around her neck. Tiger smirks as he holds the leash and Sky claws at her neck trying to get the collar off.
The man starts swearing and leaves the cafe slamming the door. She sits at their table. "I'm really sorry about that.." She says quietly and doesn't look them in the eye for long than a few seconds.
Cecil groans as Sherlock clenches around him, getting pulled deeper into him. “Good boy. Always such a good boy for Daddy.” He growls and starts thrusting, each thrust feeling deeper than the last.
“Oh god, really?” John gives a half groan half chuckle. “I didn’t know I still did that. What did we talk about?” He relaxes into Sherlock’s hold.
“Oh I know, baby. I can see it every time you checkout the package of a passing stranger wondering how it’s feel to have them stuffed up your pert little arse.” Greg strokes him faster but looser.
"It's Veronica." Sky shows him the text. **What is taking your sexy ass so long to get here?--Veronica**
“Yeah. I know it just looks like a regular office building but the really horror is below ground.” She gets out of the car and follows him to the door that’s locked.
Mycroft smiles and kisses her cheek. “I love you.” He says softly. He squeezes her waist before looking back at Diōnē, “So what do you need from me? A sample?” He asks.
"He does. However, that's doesn't mean he's not going to play with me first." She winces as he wraps her hand.
"Don't worry, Greg. He'll have to bounce off the walls of Baker Street, and play Cluedo with me." John chuckles.
Sherlock shakes his head as he looks John over. “You’re perfect.” He whispers and then raises a brow as he looks at Johns shoulder. “You have a scar?”
“Mm I do hope so.” Crystal purrs and watches him go. “Quite the charmer, your boy.” She looks to Mycroft, smiling.
"It would be wonderful. They do say it takes a village to raise a child.." He smiles. "We just need to get Sherlock and Greg on board." He takes another drag.
Carol hums softly as she sits between Collin's legs on the couch as he rubs his hands over her small baby bump.
Sherlock's moans get louder and louder as the pound into him. "Can't help it. Daddy's gonna take us to his island so you all can use me like a bitch in heat. I wanted to be full for the boat ride over."
Crystal draws another card, a 7. “Show em.” She nods and outs down her cards, 20. “Auggie has always been a prick.” She shrugs.
John screams as he pushes through the screen. He felt odd, like punching through water. And in his rage he stumbles through landing on the solid ground beneath Kia’s feet. “Let her go.” John orders, immediately standing and turning to Myropis.
“We need Beta backing. They make up a large part of the population but they don’t feel like it’s their place to meddle in omega and alpha affairs.” Anthea sighs.
"Head on collision. Female is unconscious but was responsive on scene. Male has been out since being found." The medic list put their information. Lydia starts working on the woman who's just flatlined leaving the male for John to work on.
"It doesn't bother *me*." He murmured. "But it bothers *you*. You know I have no time for idle gossip. If they want to think we're together... let them. But you," He cocked his head. "You're really bothered by it... is it because of our first conversation at Angelo's?"
“I try my best, Ma’am.” John smiles and leads her to Greg’s flat. Greg opens the door, surprised. “Why are you here?” He asks suspiciously.
John snaps his mouth shut and states out the window, blushing furiously. *Shit... Fucked it up now, Watson, old boy...*
"Can you be a good boy and control yourself or do I need to gag you?" He fucks him with his finger and rubs against his prostate.
“My good boy. Tries to act so dominant and in control. This is what you’re made for. Bouncing on my cock.” He smirks.
He takes a deep breath and nods. "Th-Thank you, love." He pulls away after a few minutes and looks at him, leaning forward to kiss him softly. "I love you.. I don't care what Ford has to say. He's not going to stop this."
“Stay with me. Always. You’re so nice and handsome and you make such good tea, John.” Sherlock smiles at him, so in love.
“Mm?” He hums, darkening the marks he’s already made on her neck. “I’m gently pushing my cum toward your eggs. I’m going to make sure you’re knocked up with my child before I ever pull out of you.” He growls softly, feeling very possessive of her.
“Mm, yeah. Feel free to go check it out. All drinks are on me tonight, just tell them to put it on Collin’s tab.”
She giggles and nods. ‘Will you plug my holes so I don’t drip to much? Or did you want to fill me again?’
"I want you to fuck me hard. Make the bed rock, go as deep as you can. Make me come over and over again until I can't anymore."
"Mmm..." Sherlock murmurs his assent. "Please..." He bites his lip and opens heavy lidded eyes to look at John with a small smile on his face.
"It's fine, Gregory." Mycroft assures. "I'll call a car to take me to Vauxhall. I have clothes and a small suite there for when I work days at a time." He finally gets up. "Thank you for the use of pajamas..." He bit his lip.
He nuzzles him sensing he wants to talk about something else. "George invited all of us to stay here for Christmas."
"Thinking." Mycroft admits. "I feel like I've rushed us into this..." He grimaces. "We don't even live together, yet."
Mycroft sighs. ‘It means everything to me. I love you Crystal, come on, please. Show him your innocence and pain and he will back off.’ He begs.
“That’s a good loud slut. The louder you are the mor likely everyone will hear you and come looking for a fuck.” James smirks, starting to thrusts immediately. Jason smirks as he watches, stroking his cock.
"I'll make sure papa reads you a story at bed time, okay?" She smiles and peppers his head with kisses.
“Yes she passed in the late 30’s. She lived about twenty five years after he did. She had lovers and such. I was one of them.” Sherlock chuckles softly. “Their son died in the 60’s. His ashes were added to Stoker’s but hers were scattered in a garden.”
“How do you want to be? On your back or stomach?” John asks as he slips his fingers out of Sherlock. John rips the condom packet open and rolls it on. He shudders and slicks himself up.
"You really need to stop say things like that about yourself. You're actually starting to believe lies." She tuts.
Magdala shrugs and gets into the cab with him. “They weren’t supposed to really. I wanted them to have a normal life. Well not as normal as my late husband did.” She rolls her eyes. “I just wanted them to know that there are other possible realities existing around them other than their own.” She hums.
Mycroft gets the girls in the jet. “We’ll see you soon, yeah?” He nods to Sky and Dark as he gets on the jet.
John nodded. "I'm not one to believe in heaven or hell, but I hope he's being tortured by the devil himself."
John smiles as he stops the bleeding and rolls his sleeve down, he keeps his eyes off Sherlock, not sure if he wanted to be watched.
“I’ll go get him,” Theodora says, happy for the chance to disappear before her family demanded to see her bond bite.
"Only because she loves garlic bread," John says softly under his breath. He's thinking of how he can hide vegetables in the sauce.
Diōnē nods. “I want you to go, and Pythia. Pythia will help you through everything.” She promises, still crying.
She moans loudly and arches, gushing around his cock. The man groans and hits George’s prostate over and over as he thrusts.
"He did work for a lot of different government agencies before getting hooked up with Moriarty." She frowns.
“Oh I don’t know if I’ll want bunnies and puppies, I’ll just want lots of hugs from and daughter and my boyfriend.” Sherlock smiles softly.
He moans and growls into the kiss, his cock throbbing as he comes hard into her, filing her with buckets of his cum.
"Oh god you're going to make me come. Please please." She whimpers against his lips as her thighs start to tremble.
“No, darling. These men care nothing for human life. They’ll use you and throw you in the trash with the rest of the garbage.” She hums, the only female buyer in the room.
He smiles back at her as he gets back to his feet, "Suppose we should get Rosie so we have enough time to make it to the shops and cook," John says, "if she had it her way, she'd probably live at the park."
Sam pushes a plug into Collins arse as the man finishes pissing on his face. “Thank these gentlemen.” Sam smirks.
John flops back and lays on the couch. "The only problem is he wrote his own name." Greg says and crosses his arms. "Why the bloody hell would he write his own name?" John asks and watches Sherlock look for something. John leans over and picks up Sherlock's shirt from the floor. "Oi here." John says and tosses it to him.
Sky smiles softly and leaves them to sleep. “Ow..” She mumbles softly and rubs her tits from the fullness pressure. She wanders around looking for someone who might be interested.
The next day, John yawns as he accepts the black coffee, no sugar from the barista. He smiles thankfully, knowing their job can be far more stressful than his. He leaves a 2 pound tip in the jar to compensate for his grumpy morning persona.
“Need to be fucked. Please, Mikey. Need it so bad.” He begs, rocking against the stool he’s sitting in for some friction.
Mycroft nods and smiles. “I’m here for you brother, just like you were there for me.” He says softly.
John sinks into a longer kiss and he is drowning in the closeness of Sherlock. His head is spinning with the surprise of having this man finally inside his personal space, his nose taking in Sherlock’s scent, his face enjoying tickles on his skin from Sherlock’s curls. The little hum that Sherlock makes as they kiss vibrates through John’s chest; every nerve ending alert and relishing in each new sensation. Years of desire and fear are finally shattered in mere moments.
"You can practice on me if you want. Pretend I don't know you. Just so you can have the experience if you ever need to tell someone." She smiles and squeezes his hand.
Sherlock follows John home, nervous and excited at the same time. “Thank you for being so patient with me.” He says softly.
Sky and Michael take Danny to play. "Collin is rather well shagged at the moment." John grins as he sits next to Greg.
“Of course.” Margaret nips at his lips before sitting back, mumbling under her breath as making his cock larger inside her.
"Oh yes, on my single-person bed, built for a kid, not a grown man. Brilliant idea." John laughs then pulls away and glares at him. "Wait, you just want to go see my room. Don't you?"
"I've no doubt that she loves you dearly as well. She's very lucky to have you and I'm sure she knows that."
“We came from you. When humans create a religion, a God, they become real. We were once the most powerful of Gods, the most followers, but then Christianity came along and everyone believed in that God, and forgot about us. All but me. Sherlock I’m sorry, it used to be so vibrant, so full of life, but it’ll just be us two.” He explains.
Mycroft smiles and lets Alderose go first before following them into the room. “Would you like to take a seat?” He asks, motioning to the plush chairs. “Doctor Watson, are we ready?” He asks.
She whines softly and arches a bit at the sensation. She lays down all the way and tries to relax like he said, getting less tense.
He frowns, his face going pale as he thinks of what happened yesterday. "I.. I'd never seen him like that, Greg.. It was bloody terrifying."
"Actually, there's something I need to discuss with Harriet and Mycroft. Why don't we do the dishes then leave you two for the evening?" Anthea suggests, "We'll stop by mid-morning with your security team and discuss the move north."
“Carol, darling. Suck your Daddy’s cock.” Violet smirks. Carol blushes and kneels in front of George, opening her mouth for him.
“Mm I think you need an even bigger plug. Your arse is just so greedy.” Zack smirks and spanks him, knowing it’ll shove the plug and maker.
Margaret leans in and kisses John deeply, tightening around him as she takes his cock deep inside her.
"Yeah. I'm sorry. I should have called you earlier. We were supposed to be home yesterday but we go called back out on an emergency on the way home. Everything's okay now. Hopefully we'll be back tomorrow morning." She hums and sits up on the counter as the bath fills.
John watches carefully as his aunt turns her back to them and begins making tea. He looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes and notices him watching her with slanted eyes.
Sherlock waves down a cab and pulls John in after him. “221 Baker Street.” He tells the cabbie, his words slurred. He tugs John close in the cab, having seen him shiver a bit while they were waiting. “It’s freezing tonight. Maybe it’ll snow.”
"You feel so tight.. You haven't been taken in a while have you? You just want to take but it's my turn to use your delicious body.." He sucks his neck and nips his jaw.
"Is it in the hotel? Or do we need to get ready to go somewhere else?" John asks, checking his watch.
John chuckles and turns the show on. He knew Sherlock secretly loved it. John didn't mind it himself, there were some wonderful dancers.
“A blessing for your womb.” The leader smiles. “To ensure you will be able to carry as many babies as you’d want to.”
"Mm you might want to give her a minute. Anderson is trying to get her back and she's not having any of that." She hums and puts a stack of finishes files up in the desk. She takes another stack and starts writing. "Oh did you know Anderson's wife is pregnant? He doesn't know yet.." She looks at Greg.
"How anyone could be more unconventional than you is mind blowing." Greg runs a hand through his hair. "Does he pose a threat? And if so what kind?" John asks falling back on his army ways of sizing up the enemy.
Mycroft relaxes into his arms, fingers stroking Gilbert's fuzzy nose. "The power of Gregory and Gilbert." He whispers.
"Tell me you want this. Tell me you want to raise a child with me. Tell me you want to hold our child like this one day." Mycroft says quietly and holds him close. Danny huffs softly breathing through his nose and closes his eyes relaxedly as he drinks happily.
“It is cause guess what? No nose bleed.” Maggie smiles. “Some magic is easier for some people than others. Physical magic is easy for me. Mental magic seems to be easier for you.”
“I’ve got everything set up. The owner’s got something special in mind and Sherlock and Mycroft are meeting us there.” He groans, picking up the pace, the head of his cock hitting her cervix with each thrust. “Mycroft wants me to knock you up.”
As he twitches through the aftershocks of his orgasm, he flops bonelessly against the bed, panting harshly.
Mycroft nods. “Should I keep tabs on Gregory as well?” He asks. “Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid?”
She holds her hips and fucks her with her tongue, rubbing her clit outside and running her cervix inside.
Mycroft kisses Anthea cheek and pulls his wrist away once she’s finished. He licks at wrist, healing the puncture marks. “How are you feeling Anthea? Can I have someone take a look at you?” He asks softly.
John paused. "Is that it?" He asked softly. "I mean, you've slaved over a lovely meal that takes at least four hours, you're plying me with good wine, better whisky, and cannolis for dessert. I feel like there's something else hanging over our heads."
He nods and takes a few deep breaths, willing away his orgasm. He's soon backed off enough and nods.
“It is. He has as long as he needs. There’s no rush.” Crystal nods. “I heard you were also considering a rather permanent decision.” She says softly.
“I’m reading how you feel about Magdala.” Sherlock states. “Why don’t you just tell each other? It would be easier. I wouldn’t have to be here telling you how the other feels.”
John smiles and walks the way Kia came from. He turns one corner and finds Dorro and Mico still arguing. He turns back around the corner and smiles to Udos. “Do you mind breaking that up?”
"Mm exactly.." She hums. "I remember. I couldn't see you that well because of my black eye but I remember how much I wanted to run my fingers through your sandy blond hair." Greg laughs.
She turns him around and holds him tightly. "We'll get it taken care of. Just no more cutting your chest, okay?" She kisses his head.
"Thank you." Turk smiles. "Turk, darling. Will you get the door?" Sky smiles and then the door bell rings with the package for Michael and the others.
"Come for me. Make a fucking mess. Be a good boy and come for me." Sky growls and fucks him deep as she bites him hard.
“Mmhmm. We’re releasing certain pressure points to help her body transition from a resting to a labor state. See, feel.” Turk takes John’s hand and presses it to Mel’s belly. “The babies are moving into position. Feel how low it is now?”
“Is that right? You want to carry my babies? Your sibling?” He smirks, pressing on his belly as he rubs his clit.
“Michael. The love of my life. Which is a ridiculous thing to say because he doesn't even know me yet.." She laughs at herself.
"It isn't easy, but so far they haven't discovered fire, or that electrical outlets spark... so there's that," John says with a laugh. "You'll see soon enough, though there's three of you. Still, you turn your back for one second..." As if planned John looks around and groans, "Where's Thomas?"
John reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s wrist before could step away. “Hey. I’m sorry, if I worried you,” John said before snuggling into his pillow and closing his eyes.
"O-oh God please.." He whimpers and wiggles out of his pants. "L-lock the door. I-if Mrs. Hudson comes up she'll have a heart attack."
'But it's not fair. I don't want you doing this.. It's too dangerous and if something happened to you, I..' He wipes his face as tears start forming.
John can't help the groan deep in his throat. Pulling back slightly to catch his breath, he looks up at Sherlock, panting. "Sherlock..." He breathed, before drawing him in for another kiss.
Sherlock blushes as he bends over the hood, wiggling his arse teasingly. “We can give them a good show, Daddy.”
Sherlock knew he couldn’t just show up unannounced. The shock would probably give John a heart attack. No, Sherlock needed a plan and he needed one now. Out of sheer desperation and exhaustion he came up with a temporary plan while he thought of something more long term. He went to one of his bolt holes and stashed his belongings before transforming into a big black dog. His back was still slashed to shreds and torn up. He wanted to get back to John as soon as he could so he didn’t let anyone fix him beyond some heavy pain meds.
If you needed any more evidence that Rosie was a genius in the making she can count to five all by herself already. This weekend if the weather permits we may go to the zoo because she’s been obsessed with penguins lately.
"You're perfect. So beautiful and brilliant. Absolutely perfect." He rocks with him and strokes him.
See if you can get her to call you Papa. If so, send me a video. I'll try to remember my Facebook or Twitter passwords so I can catch up on pictures and videos. But, I'm not sure our connection is strong enough to make browsing social media pleasurable. I'd probably spend more time waiting for videos to load than watching them.
He presses their foreheads together, trying to calm her down. 'Nothing is going to come back. I promise. You don't have to protect it alone. We are all here for you.'
“What I’m thinking is that if Sky can carry pups. Part human or totally dog, then that means she can probably carry other animals. So what I was thinking is what if she carries endangered species? She said she wanted to be bigger right? Well then let’s fill her with something bigger while also saving a few species.” Ms. Clark smirks.
Sherlock remains silent while he patches Greg up again. He bites his lip as he finishes, not moving from where he had knelt on the ground. "Do you.. Ah.. Do you want to talk about it?"
"Mm I'm going to tie you down and spank you as I fuck you with a vibrator. I'm going to tease you and tease you. If you come we're going to start all over. You can only come when I let you, understand?" He purrs as he pushes two fingers into his still slick arse.
John bites his lip and signs back. "Better now that he's awake." He looks at Mycroft and Sherlock and smiles. "At least they're getting along."
"Let's fill her up. Knock her up together." Cecil groans. "Please please please." Violet mumbles into the bed, her wetness dripping down their cock.
Sherlock grips John’s jumper tightly, pulling him closer. “I.. John..” God, his chest was so tight, he felt light headed. “John, make it stop.” He holds onto him like his life depended on it, and in that moment he truly believed it did.
"Yes, maternity shops can be quite dangerous with all those elastic waistbands." John chuckles then said a bit more seriously, "If he's there, then I can't be in that much danger as long as you're playing his game, right? Between Mycroft and half the government watching me, and my skills. Which, by the way, aren't too shabby, if I might toot my own horn. I'm fine. Plus... I will be needing those stretchy clothes sooner than later. Today's lunch tipped me over the scale of being comfortable in jeans. I'm in sweats right now, Sherlock... Freaking exercise clothing. I shouldn't even be showing yet, so I guess it could just be the food."
He nods and falls into step next to Sherlock. It almost feels like they're on a case again just walking next to one another but the playground in the middle of the path dispels that illusion quickly. After a few minutes of walking, John breaks the silence, "I should apologize for how I ended things. I should have talked to you sooner but by then all we did was argue and I didn't want her to see that."
"I love you, too. So much. So so much." She moans against his lips. "You feel so good." She whimpers and rocks her hips.
He blushes and whimpers, licking his lips at he looks at her. "Yes.. Fuck, I love it.. Christ, though, I don't.. I don't know if I can go another time.." He blushes brightly. "Jake made me come about six times.."
'I think your boyfriend is getting jealous. Take him, Sophia, Danny, and Kate to the garden to play and have tea. Tell Mycroft I want to talk to him. I'll be in the library.'
"Of course." Sherlock smiles and follows them down. Mrs. Hudson come out of her flat. "Oh I'm glad I caught you boys. I made to many biscuits. Take some for your holiday." She holds out a large tin.
“Sherlock? What’s going on?” John had been happy to make light of it but he was feeling a bit nervous for some reason. “Are you worried something will happen to me? Because, it’s okay. This happened to me on a case, while chasing a criminal. I’m pretty sure I’ll be safe to get a cab to a restaurant and a cab back home. I won’t even drink alcohol, if that makes you feel less worried.” He couldn’t work out what this look on Sherlock’s face was. But it was unsettling.
Irene frowns and gets up. “I’ll be right back.” She tells Sabine and goes to talk to Sherlock. “I need your brother to get Sabine into a private facility. John says she may need skin grafts. An all female team would also be helpful.” She tells Sherlock. “Can he do it?” She asks, knowing Mycroft would do anything for Anthea and that would most likely extend to her mother.
"Get a grip, Watson," he scolds himself, gripping the sink and staring at his reflection. His cheeks are pink, and heat prickles down his spine and between his legs. "Good god, get a grip."
Greg groans as his cock is freed. “Mm she’ll always take more if we want her to. Such a perfect cumdump.” He smirks and pulls out her plug before pushing into her cunt. Sky whines and arches, still needing to be fucked more no matter how many times she’s pounded into.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. “I never knew.” He whispers. “All this must seem like a bad dream then. Compared to how long you have been alive, this must seem so short.”
“I know.” Mycroft says. “I enjoyed his company as well. But instead of going after the people that did this, you need to prove to him you’re not like her. That you’re still the same man he knows.” He explains softly.
Sherlock stiffens and clenches his fists as Anderson blames him for everything. He grits his teeth and launches himself at him, tackling him to the ground and hitting him repeatedly. "I already blame myself for this, I don't need you to join in!"
“That’s the idea.” Sherlock beams. “But she’s the only one to be fucked. No one else, it’s her birthday after all.”
"How so? Simply because of the fact that she's not blood related? Would you feel the same way if John and Sherlock adopted a kid? If you don't consider her your granddaughter, I still consider her to be mine." He stands his ground.
John kisses Margaret softly. “I love you. I feel so lucky have two beautiful, wonderful people in love with me.” He cups Sherlock’s cheek, letting his fingers stroke his hair.
"Mm they make you look sexier.. I didn't even think that was possible.." Greg purrs softly into his ear as Anthea pulls up in a car for them.
“I know.” Sherlock nods. “I just find it strange that you’re helping vampires and not the clans in London.” He says softly.
In one swift move, he slams Mycroft back against the wall, his hand tight around his throat. “If you ever and I mean ever touch my mate again I’ll rip that cold black shriveled organs from your chest where your heart should be. If you ever pull some bullshit like this again I’ll tell Mummy about your arrangement with Anthea.” He snarls, his hand so tight around his brother's neck it’s sure to bruise.
Sherlock stiffens, his hands clenching around his mug. “I.. I’ve no idea what you’re talking about.”
Camille smiles, “that is fine by me, Anthea.” She says softly. “May I teach you to run fast?” She asks softly, not wanting to step over her bond with Mycroft.
“Good.” Mycroft frowns and he crouch’s down in front of Anthea and strokes her lovingly. “I’m sorry I didn’t do this before, sweetie. I was a fool to leave you in pain for so long.”
Greg smiles and wraps his arm around John happily. Sky leaps from her seat and runs to the stage, body checking Mycroft out of the way as two shots ring out. One from Sky's gun and another from the sniper in the next building who was aiming for Mycroft's head. The sniper dies instantly as Sky's bullet passes right between his eyes. One of the guards in on the assassination plot grabs Sky by her hair and lifts her up, ranting and raving as he waves his gun around. Sky breathes deeply as her thigh bleeds heavily from the snipers bullet. 'Turk. You have to shoot me. You have to shoot through my shoulder and into his heart. It's the only way. Please, baby. Shoot me.' She begs Turk in his head as he stands in front of the stage, gun drawn. She knew he'd do it because it was the only way everyone would survive since the mad man was using her as a human shield.
"I hope we sleep under the whale." Rosie says as she swings both Sherlock and John's arms with her own.
“Sherlock, honestly though, I’m pleased you told me. I think it’s great. I’m happy for you. And… he’d be lucky to have you. You want my real advice?” he said, looking right at Sherlock. “Don’t wait.” His eyebrows creased in thought. He thought about how much he had wanted Sherlock to think of him that way and it made him sad. He had tried that very first night and Sherlock had fobbed him off. And sometimes after that he thought maybe… but he’d never had the courage. Sherlock was just too high on a pedestal and they were friends and flatmates and it was all too complicated. He had made peace with that. “You know, if you overthink things and second guess things too much… sometimes it just becomes too late to make a move and you miss your chance… ” he said as he looked away.
"I'll call your mum tomorrow and have her moved here by the end of the week. There's a flat for you both across from where we live. You guys can be there and we'll be close. Does she.. Does she know yet?"
“No it doesn’t. Some people can’t be saved. It’s not your fault. It’s their time.” Sherlock says softly.
Mycroft nods. “Camille made me happy, coming back. But having Crystal and Maggie, they’re like my wives. One is my Queen and the other is my goddess.” He explains softly.
"Are these them?" Veronica asks Sky. "Yup." Sky smiles. Veronica walks around the boys looking them up and down. "You have excellent taste." Veronica praises Sky and Sky laughs.
"Mm it's the carnival. I've been away and everyone thinks they can run amuck without me to watch them like a hawk." She frowns and makes herself some tea.
He hums. “Never really grew out of it.” He puts his arm around him. “Cecil and I used to smoke weed in our dorm in Uni.” He chuckles softly.
She drools around his cock and lets him go deeper, subtly tapping into his thoughts wanting to know what he’s thinking.
“Almost, baby. Just one more finger and ten you can have my cock.” Eli kisses his neck and slowly eases the last finger into Josh.
Mycroft reaches down and haltingly uses the tip of his index finger to trace light patterns against Greg's perineum, applying the slightest pressure.
"God, you could make me hard anywhere. I just have to think about you pressing your hot cunt against me. I want to feel you get wet in your panties, finger you from over them."
She bounces on his cock. “Not my fault. You just feel so fucking good.” She whimpers, her cunt starting to make a puddle on the floor as her slick drips off his balls. “Never had a cock like this. Never been full like this. Making me want more cock.” She whines.
"Good boy. I think I've had my fill of teasing you. For now. This time when I fuck you hard I'm not going to stop until you scream." He smirks and pulls his fingers out, leaving Mycroft empty.
He moans and takes him balls deep, keeping him deep as he just rocks his hips to make Fitz’s cock rub right against his prostate.
“That’s it. Pound that pussy.” The man smirks. Sky moans loudly as he fucks her, pushing back for more. “Deeper. Show it who’s boss. Your cock is in it. Use it. What? Don’t you have a cock? I guess not the way your fucking it like a little bitch.” The man taunts.
Sherlock pants again, gripping John's hair in a vice like grip, his cock leaking heavily down John's throat. "Fuck..." He whimpers.
Mycroft offers his hands to Crystal to help her up. “How can you look so beautiful after sleep so uncomfortably?” He asks softly.
"It's okay. I'm sorry it was such a shock. We should have talked first. I'm sorry." He squeezes his hand, making sure they were good again.
"When does he get here?" Sky sighs as she does her make up. "Now." George frowns. "Oh I swear to god when this is over I will scream at you so loud your ears will ring for a year." She snaps.
“Please, I’ve won battles for her before after starving for a month an a half with most of my bones broken. This is nothing.” Crystal slowly gets up, hiding how much pain she’s in.
"I..." John stammers, sitting down hard on the edge of the bed. He didn't know what to say, or if there was even anything he could say to that. Lowering his head John lowers the mental walls around his and Sherlock's bond. Sherlock's presence rushes in, like a dam breaking, and he lets out a choked sob. He hadn't even realized how much he'd missed the sensation.
"I know, baby." Eli sits in a chair and pulls Mycroft up to sit in his lap. He kisses Mycroft's back as he lowers Mycroft down onto his cock. Brains moans and strokes himself as he watches.
He moans louder, gagging a bit as Eli cuts off his airway. Mycroft whimpers, needing more to be pushed over the edge. He gasps and flicks his eyes up to Sherlock.
“Mm I don’t even know how many loads are inside you. Lost count.” He chuckles, teasing him with the plug.
“Mm I know you do.” He groans and holds Sherlock’s hips as he starts to fuck Sherlock, the people around them starting to notice.
“Mm your brother did tell me to make sure you behaved so make sure the possible killer knows I’m the only one allowed to fuck you.” John chuckles and kisses his cheek.
“Well whatever you do. Don’t disturb me unless it’s important.” Greg sighs before leaving her too it.
Her expression is soft but falters when she sees Greg's bandaged chest. She doesn't ask what happen she just gives him a tight smile. "The weather is nasty today. The weather man said we might even lose power. I just wanted to come up and make sure you boys had everything you needed." She says looking to John. "We're fine Mrs. Hudson." John assures her. "Good good. If you need me I'm right down stairs.." She says and heads for the door. "Oh and Mrs. Turner wanted to know when the wedding is?" She asks.
“Daddy missed your cunt, baby. You always feel so good around Daddy’s cock.” He starts to slowly thrust into her.
"Pain in my arse I swear to god." Sky grumbles as she stuffs Turk in the trunk before getting in to drive.
“Ohh Yes.” She moans loudly as she’s filled, whimpering as she watches her belly grow with their cum.
He looks down at him lovingly. "Touch me and I'll give you everything. Just one touch, that's all it takes. Touch me and Daddy will take care of you." He signs.
Sherlock kisses him some more and decides he wants John’s on his hands and knees to take him from behind. Or maybe he wants to pin him to the wall and fuck him hard enough to makes the frames on the wall rattle. “Would you rather I take you from behind or hold you up as I fuck you against the wall?”
“I think there’s an underground omega trafficking ring that gets their supply of omega’s from killing their alpha and then kidnapping the omega to sell to the highest bidder.” Sherlock frowns.
Sky mewls and arches, fucking herself on his cock. "So good. So so good." She whimpers. "Fuck. Are you imagining your cock getting bigger?" She moans, feeling the stretching grow.
He hums softly loving the feeling of John's lips on his own. He loves the firm pressure and the gentle glide of his lips. He loves the wet heat of John's mouth and his tongues moving with and against his own.
"So good, baby. You're doing so good for me.." John has to let go of his cock or he won't last much longer.
"Let me ask you then," John says after a moment of silence, "do you want us to be done? Because I wouldn't be putting myself or Rosie through this mess again if I didn't want things to work. Yes, she pushed me into seeing you again but when I did I realized how much I missed you. I do want this, Sherlock but not if it's going to cause you anguish. I don't want you hurting yourself because that's what you think you want." He looks up at the ceiling to get his bearings as he continues. "You're right. I don't like therapy and I don't like poking at emotions because they're messy. I like to sit and brood but I can't do that anymore because it's not working. My tactics for dealing with things are not working, so I'm willing to try therapy. I'm willing to put the effort in because we're better when we're together.”
“Too bad you brought a knife to a gunfight.” John pulls out his hand gun. “Drop the knife or I’ll drop you. Your choice.” He points the gun at Ryan’s head.
"I know.. And I know how each of your scars. I watched each one form on your bodies before it happened. I know.." She gives Sherlock a tight smile but doesn't try to cover her scars.
“Funny?” Sherlock frowns. “But... Maggie’s birthday is coming up soon and I was wondering if you could help set something up for her.”
Holding Sherlock tight, John buries his neck in Sherlock' neck. "Mine," he says softly while scraping his teeth over Sherlock's scent gland. He wants to bite but resists.
John has a sinking feeling in his stomach as he follows Sherlock. “I think I need to start coming up with new words to express how brilliant you are.”
“Oh yeah? He’s right here.” Greg pulls out his phone and turns the camera on selfie mode, pointing it towards Mycroft showing him himself.
Sherlock hums softly and leans against Mycroft. Lydia's fingers play over the table top as if she's playing piano while she's lost in thought.
“Yeah..” She blushes brighter. “I just felt your cum start dripping out of me. I didn’t realize how deep you pushed it into me. Or how much.” She mewls softly as she feels more leak out.
“Yeah she was. Camille. We have a new leader now, we all have to meet him, as soon as we’re turned. He’s... he came around once with his wife, did you meet them?” He asked, “I think you thought they were my parents.” Sherlock explains. “We don’t live in a democracy. The oldest person is the leader, when they’re killed, then the next oldest become leader and so on and so on.” He explains. “Age equates to wisdom after all.”
He blushes. "I always envisioned it with you on your back and me fucking you like that and Cecil behind me. But I think for my first time it would be easier for me to be on my back."
Mycroft knocks on his office door and carries Anthea inside. “Sire, forgive my intrusion, but I believe that Anthea, my assistant is ready for the transition.” He explains softly, sitting Anthea in one of the plush chairs.
Turk showers quickly, getting out and getting dressed, not ready for them to see the thick scars all over his body.
John chuckles. “Yeah lead the way.” He smirks, following Sherlock out sneakily making sure no one sees them.
"Sherlock your bleeding. Let me disinfect and cover it. Please?" John says with a huff as he puts away the items. John goes and gets his kit.
John thrusts a few more times into Morna before adding his own cum to Sherlock’s inside her. He growls loudly, as he thrusts through his orgasm.
"Looks like they're getting ready to go to dinner." Jean hums as Sky and Zack finish the last interview.
“Yes yes.” John moans, rocking his hips. He had no idea what was going on but it felt so good he could care less.
"Anything you want. I can tie you up, blind fold you, put a cock ring on you. I could edge you for hours. Or make you come hard over and over. Nipple clamps are a personal favorite."
Mycroft bites his lip, willing his erection to whither. He doesn't want to move in case he wakes Greg.
Mel blushes and mewls softly, feeling his meaty head rub against her tight cunt. She relaxes, rocking back against him for more.
“Are you going to have your way with me, Doctor? Bend me over your exam table and make sure I’m good and knocked up?” She purrs and kisses his jaw as she presses close.
"Not until I say." She growls and fucks him harder. She strokes him and hits his prostate over and over. "Come! Now!" She commands.
Mycroft moans loudly and adjusts his angle, aiming for Greg's prostate. "Come for me, Gregory.. I want to hear you.."
“She has such nice tits. Doesn’t she? So big and perky. ”  Violet smirks as she pushes them together. Sky whimpers and blushes as she’s played with.
“Yes, Sir.” She pulls at his bottom lip with her teeth before turning and bending over for him, arching with her arse in the air.
“Sounds good. If you see Sky will you send her to me? I’ll talk to her about getting you a cunt and womb and me a cock.”
He moans and takes his cock back into his mouth, adding a third finger. He fucks him with his fingers slowly.
"We went to an address your mate gave us, for a case...it's an empty neighborhood with chemicals seeping out everywhere, near the old abandoned hospital." Sherlock replied.
Marianne ordered a pint for both of them and took the drinks back to their reserved table. "So, your presentation tomorrow... Got it figured, or are you gonna wing it?"
"You are. Such a fuck toy. A needy little cock slut. So needy to be fucked by anyone and to fuck. You're such a whore. You love it, don't you? This primal urge to fuck and to own. It drives you mad." She bites and sucks on his neck, pussy throbbing around his cock.
“He may of banished me but that doesn’t mean he didn’t need my skills from time to time. Don’t apologize.” Madgala hums and smiles.
“No Sherlock they have ten.” John says softly. “We can bare more.” He says softly. “We can have as many as we want.”
He knew it wasn't easy for Sherlock, so he didn't say anything. Instead, he just nuzzles his mate and kisses the spot below his ear.
Collin moans and fucks Sherlock with his tongue. "Mm what a perfect way to wake up." Mycroft hums and nips at Sherlock's jaw as Greg and John start to wake.
"Danny, this is Chloe. She's going to be Zack's wife." Sky smiles. "Coco!" Danny smiles happily at Chloe.
"Probably." John agrees. "I haven't been home since... well, mum. So it makes sort of sense. It's probably an emotional response."
Sherlock smiles, ‘thank you Crystal.’ He says honestly. “How are you feeling John? Still woozy from blood loss?” He asks softly.
“Don’t you dare ever stop.” Sherlock presses close, pinning John back to his chair. “I’m never letting you go. Never again.”
Carol blushes and smiles shyly, pussy twitching as she sees them. "It's a brilliant idea. I want it so badly. Please keep me full and pregnant with your babies. I need it. It's what I was made for. To be breed over and over. Give me what I need. Never leave me empty. I need to be carrying your children always at all times. My cunt belongs to you. All I ask is that it's always full of cum. Please oh please I want this so badly."
Sherlock smiles and hugs John tightly. “It’s beautiful.” He whispers. He turns to face away from John, so John can put it on him.
He groans and bites his neck, fucking him hard and fast, not going to cum until Michael gives him permission.
“You are. You’re such a good boy.” He holds his hips, pounding into him and leaning down to kiss him hard.
“Cross your legs Sherlock. Hold on tightly but don’t dig your fingers in.” John says softly before place the bunny in Sherlock’s lap and going to get another bunny.
Jean jumps, surprised. “Ohhh I didn’t even see you! Good one, mate!” He grins and squeezes his shoulder before heading back to reset.
Eli groans and arches. “Mm you just want me to fill your greedy holes with cum in front of all those important people.”
“Oh fuck. The more you come the more cum it’s going to suck out of me.” He groans, hips still flexing and rolling as he fills her. He feels the tightened of her cervix and knows that not even a single drop is going to escape her greedy womb.
"You fill her up so good. Listen to her. I can almost hear all that cum slushing around inside her." Sherlock nibbles on his neck.
Sky flinches whenever someone raises their hand. “I think she needs a break.” He gets up, going to her.
Mycroft smiles and nuzzles him. Sky walks by dragging a handcuffed man on the ground by the collar of his shirt. "Evening boys. Enjoying the party?" Sky asks acting as if it's not a big deal to be dragging a handcuffed man.
“I prefer to cook. Helps me decompress from the day. Plus I get to watch Mycroft enjoy it. Win win for me.” Greg grins.
Leona stiffens as the light touches her, but relaxes when it doesn’t hurt. She rubs at her tingling stomach. “That was beautiful.” She whispers.
Mycroft bit his lip, closing his eyes against Greg's onslaught. "That in itself is questionable... from what John said, she took family emergency days... there could be something in that..!" He inhaled sharply.
“Everything. We are ridiculous. This is ridiculous. Our lives are ridiculous. And knowing all of that I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I just think it’s the most ridiculous thing that I got so lucky. So lucky to be alive, to meet you, to be here in the moment.” John says and sips his tea.
Closing the lid he places both items on the top then walks quickly over to Sherlock and roughly grabs his chin, forcing the man to look down at him.
Mycroft looked at Greg and smiled. "*Je m'en fiche de toute façon, Juliette. Je laisse la décision à Gregory.*" (“I don't care anyway, Juliette. I leave the decision to Gregory.”)
‘I know. I’m trying too. At least I didn’t bite your cock off.’ Crystal goes to the bathroom, turning in the shower.
Mycroft nods and smiles. “I think they need to work out their problems for that.” He smiles, “May I go see her?” He asks, standing.
[Fine. I'll see you tomorrow.] He sends back before turning his phone off for the rest of the evening. He wants to at least get a few hours of sleep so their conversation makes sense.
"Did anyone try to kidnap her in the eight years she's been alive?" Benjamin asks, "sounds to me like your ex was just trying to come up with a way to leave you."
After she explained everything that had happened and what everyone's response was to the cocoon, she changed the topic. "Can I come home?"
"He tends to like a mixture of both.” Mycroft smirks. Sherlock blushes and mewls as he listens to them.
Eventually, she started talking to me again after I told her good girls who don’t draw on skulls with marker get to go to the park. We walked past the dog park and she held onto the fence and watched the dogs for almost half an hour straight without distraction. So now she wants a dog of course. I will say I may be inclined to indulge this want a little more than you may like.
John thought of his army bedsit. "All right. I'll trial it." He acquiesced. "One month. But if it doesn't work out, I'm gone."
Lydia whimpers softly and stands on her tip toes. She holds Anthea's face gently in her soft small hand.
Sherlock looked up at him. "You still... you still want me to sleep next to you even after you.... you remembered everything?"
“Mm true. I guess we’ll just see what happens.” She shrugs, turning to put on high stripper heels. “However you want to do it. It’s up to you.”
Sherlock smirks slightly as he angles the phone's camera just that little bit so that he was fully on display, and began to record. He'd show John what the doctor was missing out on.
"What.. What if I stop? What if I stop making you happy? What if I stop being good? What if I stop being useful to you?" She asks quietly. "People always leave, Michael. They leave when I stop helping them. They leave what I stop being useful to them. They leave when I'm not enough anymore. They use me up and throw me out because I've stopped.." She sounds like she's crying.
Sky laughs. "He offered me the world in turn for my obedience and loyalty to him. I told him that I'm not a submissive and that I would teach him a lesson of he ever thought of me that way again. He begged me to see him tonight and I told him maybe." She smiles slyly.
His hand goes to Brent’s hair as he slips his tongue back into his mouth, gently gliding it against his.
"I'm out of the business. Well whatever business I was in. Closing up shop and setting down some roots." Turk smiles, wrapping his arm around Sky's waist. "I'm pregnant." Sky blushes and smiles, relaxing into Turk.
“Hello, dear. I’ve got some biscuits. How are-“ Mrs. Hudson stops mid sentence as she sees Jared. “That’s a baby. Why do you have a baby?” She smiles and puts the tray down before going to see the baby.
"What? No." John shakes his head as a means of protest, "Baker Street is your home. It's part of your identity. I've already taken so much from you, I'm not going to take this too."
He hums softly, his mind turning over John’s words. “Grieving period.. grieving period... Grieving period!” He says suddenly, going back to a stack of papers.
"I'm fine." She says softly, finally leaning against him. "I'm sorry I yelled at your dad. You mum was right. I shouldn't have done that. I know he didn't mean it that way but just.. I couldn't hear that. Not today of all days." She whispers.
"Mm you've made such a mess. If there weren't so many people here I might let you convince me to lick you clean.." She purrs and pulls in his ear with her teeth.
Mycroft sighs. “That’s the motions of it. But... everytime I see you, I get butterflies in my stomach, knowing that we’re together. I want the whole world to know that I love you. Everything I envision doing, I envision doing it with you. You’re never out of my thoughts and neither is Magdala. That’s what love is. It’s not the actions. It’s the feelings.” He explains.
"Daddy, your cock feels so good. Makes my tight little pussy feel so good. Such a big cock, Daddy. All for me. Stretches my wet cunt so much. Oh, Daddy. Fuck me."
He blushes as he looks at the time. “As much as I’d love to continue this, my break is about to end.”
“If he is able to, my Sire shall possibly give us something useful to use on our travels.” Sherlock explains as he leads John downstairs. “He doesn’t want me dead, or any of the vampires he’s sired to die, and because I’m going with you, that protection will help to protect you too.”
"Still the same," he smiles, looking at the pictures on the wall as they walk through the hall towards the kitchen in the back. "Frank looks great," he commented as he passed a recent family portrait.
"You were so good, love.. So so very good.. You were brilliant. You solved those clues so fast. It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. You were mind blowing.." He kisses, licks, and sucks his way down John's body.
Greg sighs and texts her back. **Sherlock is in the hospital. I'm not coming back until he does. --GL**
"I left him in a whimpering heap on the floor. Felt good. I don't think I broke anything other than his pride."
John sighs. "What was in it? Was there even any of his regular seven percent? Was it even cocaine?" John is tired so tired but he knows he's not going to sleep till Sherlock wakes up. When ever that will be. John sits in the row of chairs leaving one open for Greg in between Mycroft and himself.
Anthea smiles and relaxes into Mycroft’s hold. “We need to go back into Camille. We shouldn’t keep her waiting.” She says softly.
John smiles and sips his own tea, looking around the flat. Things have been moved and then put back in place. Mycroft probably had the flat search. "How's the tea?" John asks turning his full attention back into Sherlock.
John twitches, still very reserved about the scar that spreads across his left pectoral and shoulder blade. But, a moment later, he sighs in acceptance.
She nuzzles him and smiles at him lovingly when he's finished washing her. "Mm you're going to be a great dad.."
She smiles softly and relaxes. She bites her lip and leans against him just a tiny bit, training herself to get used to feeling him.
John gets out and towels off wrapping it around his waist. He takes Sherlock's hand leading him out of the shower. He dries him slowly, gently, lovingly.
made something. Together. It isn't the pups that make me want to jump your bones, but..." Trailing off for a moment he sighs then says, "I guess it's just proof that we love each other. We wanted this. Them.”
"Kind of. He goes by the name 'Tiger' which Moriarty gave him. Sky has made a hologram of him and I've had my people searching for him since. He's not in England." Mycroft frowns. "У тебя на коленях." Sky command, 'On your knees'. Ivan sinks to his knees easily. Sky picks up the briefcase full of money and walks to George's office. "Ползать." Sky snaps, 'Crawl'. Ivan bites his lip holding back a moan as he follows her, crawling on the floor.
“It murdered hundreds of humans.” Greg snaps before stepping back away from her, in case she lunges.
John smiles and holds Sherlock tightly. “I’ve always hated landing. I was tempted to be a marine just so I didn’t have to fly.”
Harriet laughs then pulls her two mates in for a hug. They press their faces on either side of hers and wrap their arms around each other.
"Mm I've been a slut your whole life. You just found out, baby. Tell me what you remember." She pulls him in and kisses him deeply.
No. He didn’t eat me. Then again I didn’t have my handy dandy broach to stab him with if he tried.-JW
'I uh.. When I was younger I used to get high and sleep around.. I hated how I felt and I didn't want to have to think.. The drugs and sex didn't help so I swore off everything. I haven't been with anyone since then.'
Sky stays still and looks at John shyly, blushes brighter as she hears the thoughts come from his head about what he would do to her
“I don’t know! She isn’t any more or less kidnappable than she was when she was in nappies. But apparently to my ex it is.” Sherlock sighs, sipping his coffee again to keep the nauseous feeling at bay when he says ex.
“I mean sex is a lot freer because they talk about it. They teach their children about it. They make their own contraception.” Crystal hums as she closes the book.
Anthea goes next, sliding off the bed with graceful movements. She drags her fingers along Harry's naked collarbone as she passes then pinches her arse.
Maggie gets up slowly and heads towards the bathroom. “Morning.” She says softly and stretches, her little baby bump on display.
“It’s real. I promise. Feel.” She takes her hands and rubs the over her body. She takes her hands and work the up over her thighs to her hips, over her belly to her breasts. “All you.”
"How was your brother? Annoying? Please tell me he was wearing a nightgown with one of those funny sleep hats that dangles past his chin."
He pats her belly as he stands, “stay there Maggie.” He orders, as he steps over to Greg and Crystal. “Would you two like to join in using my little toy for a while? My toy needs to learn whose in charge now.”
She rolls her eyes and lets out an exasperated sigh that is so reminiscent of Sherlock that John feels a tightness in his chest. "So when does the rest of the class get here?"
She smiles as she watches him eat. "I hope it's alright." She says as she looks over his chart and his labs from that morning.
"Fuck me, please. I need you both in my arse, fill me with your come, make me your slut, your dirty whore." He blushes and begs. "Make me sore. Fuck me and fill me, then plug me. Use the vibrating one, the one with the remote. You can tease me during dinner and the movie. I.. I bought a clit vibrator.. Use that too.. Use me in public, please.." He begs, moaning loudly.
Greg shrugs and nods. “Just do whatever you need to and then leave.” He whispers, still not moving. He doesn’t want her there but knows it’s important that she is.
"That's right. You're here for my pleasure. Let's see if you can take another cock in your arse." He smirks.
Eli nods. “I’ll be in meetings most mornings. You guys are free to do whatever.” He hands them credit cards.
She's still for a moment in shock before swooping down and kissing him. "Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes. A million billion trillion times yes." She gasps against his lips.
"How? How does he do it? How does he deal with all this uncertainty? How does he focus mainly on us when he has a million other things screaming for his attention? How did we become the most important things in his life to him?"
“You look fantastic.” John smiles and goes to her. “I do seems to remember you making a comment about being 20 years younger then I’d have a chance.” He teases and squeezes her hands.
He grins and goes to kiss him. “Take care of our slut, yeah? Make sure he gets nice and full. I’d like to come in him after he’s had enough loads.”
“It says there’s a temple? Grand and full of statues. Once the fires go out in the temple the god’s will be lost forever.” Sherlock frowns. “We have to go re light the fires.”
"No need to bloody shout. 'm not deaf!" Smythe grumbled. "Won a contest, you say? Don't remember entering no competition. An' I got no one to take to some fancy posh knob for dinner, since Mrs Smythe passed, God rest 'er."
“Oh I think we have to, Lock. She’s absolutely dripping. It’s never good to leave a bitch in heat without enough cum inside her to keep her busy.” Cecil smirks. Sky whines and rocks against him as he nudged the plug. ‘Mycroft what’s me to be absolutely desperate so all the men in the house can breed me. I won’t tell if you two wanna have a sneak preview of fucking me though.’ She pants, dripping around the plug.
She lifts herself and let's his fingers slip out. "Mm I'm going to be so deliciously sore I already know it." She purrs and pulls open the bedside drawer. "Cuffs or ties? Which do you prefer?"
**Mm the lace feels so good bushing against my nipples.--Chloe** She takes a few more pictures and send them to him.
John frowns as Greg's caller ID lights up on his phone. "Greg? Whoa woah. Calm down. What happened?" He gets up already leaving the clinic because it's what his instincts are telling him to do.
Sherlock smiles. “Will you, show me?” He asks, excitedly. “Give me a little show?” He suggests, giggling.
He blushes and smiles, kissing him back happily. "We're about to go to the hotel, if you'd still like to join."
“I mean the whole act of feeding, it seems more personal and intimate than when we eat.” John says softly.
He palms Mycroft slowly. "I haven't been able to stop thinking about the way you looked at me this morning. That cheeky smirk. You knew exactly what my wife did to me, didn't you? You knew she fucked me good and hard.." He squeezes him.
John nods. “They both do. But I’m glad you’ve found someone, Morna. Are you going to keep this one?” He asks.
Max is speechless. "And that's Mycroft for the win." Greg smiles and takes Mycroft's hand walking to the door. "I hope you enjoy being his bitch on a leash, Greg!" Max snaps. "I do love it when he puts me on a leash. It's quite enjoyable." Greg smirks and they leave.
He smirks and thrusts his fingers a bit more before pulling them out. "Turn around for me. I want to see you."
“If he wants.” Collin chuckles. “Oh he wants.” Sherlock blushes as Dave looks him over. “I’m Sherlock.”
She sighs. "Alright.. You're going to do what you want anyway at least I have a heads up this time. I have to be there though or else it won't happen, get it? Do you want him in the holding cell or interview room?"
John sits back in his chair, humming softly as he drinks his tea. He should have gotten biscuits... oh, well. He looks over the rim of his cup at Sherlock. "What *is* engaging that big brain of yours?"
"Yeah. After me and you have ours I'll be a surrogate for Michael and Jake. Then we'll see what happens." She smiles.
Collin smirks and goes to straddle Mycroft in his chair. "Need something?" He asks innocently as he grinds against him.
"Mm, well it was nice." John looked up and glanced over at the clock. The day is only half over and he wants to spend the whole day in bed. Still, he knows Sherlock has work to do, and Mycroft has evil plots to hatch.
Mycroft sighs, taking small bites of food. "Anthea and Molly will make good mothers." He murmured, slicing his knife into a garlic and Parmesan potato.
'I know every dirty delicious detail you and Collin talked about as you fucked her. You should just have us girls in a row, bent over as each of you take a turn fucking us. That way everyone gets a fair chance of being a Daddy. However many times we get fucked by whoever after that is just fair game. It's open season on our pussies and whoever wins adds another baby to our soon to be rapidly growing family.' Sky smirks and spreads her legs, knowing he's watching her.
“Welcome everyone. We’re finally together again after so long. All thanks to the heroics of one man. Sherlock.” Helea nods to Sherlock. “He saved us for a void of nothingness. Tonight and every night we feast in his honor. Let us eat.”
Mycroft gasps and whimpers. "Please! Sherlock, fuck me! Please! I need it so bad.. Need you.. I need you to fuck and fill me.."
He pulls out of him slowly and lays him back on the couch before pushing back into him, pressing close. "Better?" He kisses him softly.
“Fuck me as long as you need, Daddy. I always want your cock in me. Feels so nice, Daddy. Your cock is perfect for me. Makes me feel so nice a full. Such a perfect cock, Daddy.” She rocks her hips with him, the makings of a perfect cockslut already.
Mycroft's moan vibrates around Greg. Swallowing, he s l o w l y draws Greg in, thankful to be sans a gag reflex. His lover was HUGE.
At first I wanted to like John's aunt. But by the end of this chapter we realized nope, she's a bitch.
"I got him into clubs. He has an excellent head for business but has a hard time picking the right thing to obsess over. I just pointed him in the right direction." She smiles. "And he's a terrible waiter but a much better spy."
"Wake Jake and come out to the kitchen." He smiles and kisses him before getting up. He pulls on a pair of low slung sweat pants and heads out to the kitchen.
“No. He was ill as a child but recovered. His life was very precious to him.” Sherlock hums. “When he was dying he considered it. He had a few strokes and sent for me to see him but he had died before I could arrive. Florence came to live with me. She cultivated a beautiful garden in London.”
“He does. He really does..” Sherlock nods. “And So do you. I mean just look at everything you do. It is everything. You do everything.”
Security grabs Sherlock by the shoulders and forces him to sit back down. “No leaving until the auctions are over.” They snap at him before walking away.
"Then don't worry about it. She wants you. That is blatantly obvious. You only need to worry when she tells you to worry. That's how she is. She wants you to be happy. She honest and open about what she wants. So don't stress over nothing. Okay?"
“You just want my cock back in your perfect arse.” He mumbles and rubs his hands up over his stomach and chest, biting at his neck gently.
“Mm 15 minutes left but considering we’re going into business together I think we’ll call this a product trial and you can use her as long as you want.” Turk smirks.
While she had been working towards getting them together the whole day, John could tell this request was just his daughter wanting to sleep next to her best friend, so he didn't complain. He just sets his sleeping bag down beside Sherlocks.
Fitz leads him to a large wear house onto a cat walk overlooking the ground floor at the people training.
"That's to bad. I guess you don't want to get off. Oh well." George shrugs. "I suppose we'll just have to used him as our personal cumdump then." Cecil strokes his cock in front of John's face.
"Sorry.. We'll pulling up now. I'll tell George to fuck off and put on his big boy pants so he can deal with his own shit. I'm just having a bad day and was looking for a fight."
"My files.." She hums and pulls out stacks of files and flash drives. "Everything I ever did for Moriarty. Every medical test I've ever been subjected to. This is me on paper and memory.."
"We can have anything here. Anything you can imagine. Anything your heart desires." She kisses his neck.
John wiggles his arms loose and thrashing about as he gets covered up. He whines loudly as tears roll down his cheeks.
She smiles and goes back to her room. She hums softly and crawls into bed with Michael who is sleeping.
“That’s the John I know.” Sherlock smiles down proudly at him as kisses his nose. “Welcome back.” He says softly.
She blushes brightly as he calls her baby girl, letting him look at her all he wants since she’s been naked this whole time having completely given up wearing clothes.
He whimpers softly and collapses against the bed. He mewls as they kiss him and blushes at the praise.
Sherlock crawls up onto the couch and cuddles John carefully after pulling his pants and trousers back up.
“I’m sorry, love. I’ll be more careful.” Dominic says softly, laying on top of the covers so he doesn’t stimulate her by being to close.
“Oh god, I haven’t worn things like this in years..” she gasps as she looks at all the clothes. “Are we going to a club?”
“No. They didn’t tell me anything. We worked off a no news is good news system.” Sherlock pulls out his phone and shows it to John. “Go through the texts. Read everything they ever said. All of them are pretty much about shift changes.”
"Yeah... Um, can we just be left alone tonight? I'll ring if we need anything." John asks of the nurse, who frowns but nods and closes the door behind her on her way out. John knew it wasn't proper protocol, but he had a sneaking suspicion that Mycroft had pulled a few strings for him.
“Oh yes, Daddy!” Sky whimpers, her nipples starting to leak the moment he touches them. “I need it, Daddy. I need to be filled every minute. Feel so empty without new hot cummy.” She whines.
Greg moans and whimpers as he suckles, bucking his hips a bit. He gasps as she starts to work her cunt around his cock.
Sky hums softly and tries to eat but she mostly pushes her food around her plate making it look like she's eaten. She's not used to having more than one meal a day and she already had breakfast that day.
“You need to get pregnant, as soon as you know that you are, I’ll bless your child, so they will grow up healthy, as well as promise my soul to the child.” Diōnē smiles. “It would be nice to have a bed for the night.” She smiles to Dominic.
Violet goes to get a selection of strap ons, all vibrators as well for both of them. She sets them on the bed. "You can pick."
“Mm maybe just a bit. I haven’t given birth since we’ve been here. That’s the longest I’ve gone since I started having them.” Sky giggles and blushes. “But you know I always like to be fuller.”
Michael's eyes widen when he finally gets it. His eyes start watering. "S-Sky?" He turns to look at her to make sure it wasn't a joke.
"I don't need to tell you that John is a complex man because you already know that. I think he hasn't slipped into a sub role with you yet is because he feel to protective over you so he can't get into a submissive head space easily."
Mycroft looks up at where Sherlock stood frozen. His broken expression easily seen through his red, puffy eyes.
James closes his eyes, letting his head hang. John licks his lips. “I’ll let you have her cunt. I’m sure it feels brilliant with all that cum.”
John whines a needy and blushes. "You heard Mycroft. Stretch yourself, slut." Sherlock smirks. John whimpers as grabs the lube, starting to stretch himself for them.
Mycroft smiles softly down at her. “Yes, Anthea. Camille has offered to change you. To get rid of your cancer. To makes you better. You have done so much for me. Let us do this for you.” He says softly, he wraps his arm around her waist, scared of how tired she looks.
"Your parents were highly religious...neighbors thought it was about a boy...your friends didn't mention one when questioned. They left out that you were dating one of them. Your father especially didn't like it. According to a police report he was taken in for domestic violence..." Sherlock replied.
“I won’t. We made a promise that we wouldn’t be able to hurt each other. I wouldn’t be able to hurt you even if I wanted to. I mean hunt you more in a tracking sense. I want to see what your senses pick up. How in tune you are with your powers. How much work we need to do. Also I was thinking of throwing knives but we’ll see.” Crystal shrugs. “I need to see how much you rely on or suppress your instincts.”
Not wanting to tear open every book his family had ever owned, John instead ran his fingers along the covers and inspected the corners for lifting glue. Once he thought he'd found something, only to cut the book open and find it was just old and worn. He was just beginning to grow frustrated when Sherlock looked up from the stack of books he'd been pouring over and held up one of his mother's gardening books, his eyes bright with discovery.
He licks his lips. "How can I say no when you're begging so nicely?" He strokes himself to full hardness again.
“My friend Matthias.. He was trapped there all this time.. But he couldn’t contact me? Even though before he must have been stronger? It just.. It doesn’t feel right.”
"I love you.. Thank you for showing me I'm worth loving.." He bites his lip as he mumbles the last part.
“Make sure you get John in on the surprise so he’s not caught off guard. I think this may actually push him over the edge to want Maggie to have his children.” Crystal giggles.
"Because she feels like she owes him her life. She'd do anything for him. She doesn't care. It's out of some false sense of repayment. If she didn't feel like she owes him there's no way in hell she would have stuck around here."
Greg kisses him from his shoulder to his neck to his jaw to him chin and finally he kisses his lips. "I love you." He mumbles against his lips.
“Yeah, you did. You’re a right twat when you want to be, you know that?” John tries to joke but his misery is written all over his face. “What am I going to do Sherlock? I can’t go home now. I can’t…”
All the god’s and goddesses look at each other before bowing to Sherlock, understand how important he is.
"Mm the only thing I expect is to make you feel good. The only thing that could be changed is my way of making you feel good. Okay?"
The kitchen still smelled like home to John. Hints of his mother's favourite tea and her perfume still lingered, though it was nearly so faint he couldn't pick it out.
Mycroft sighs heavily and removes himself from the bed, trying to be careful. He goes downstairs, not bothering with clothes as he goes into the kitchen. "Greg."
"I'm going to come into you again and then eat my cum out of you. You're going to sit on my face, understand?"
“Do it. Fuck me with Daddy. Fill me with daddy. Knock me up with Daddy.” She whines, spreading her legs a bit more so he can fit inside her with George.
"Sherlock's parents are going to throw a fit that you got to meet them first." John laughs, walking over to run a hand over Teddy's forehead, brushing a dark curl back under her knit hat.
Sherlock smiles and relaxes against him, closing his eyes. Mycroft frowns. "That's where we will run into trouble. He's not easily put off. Never has been. The only thing that ever seemed to bother him was mummy."
"You don't pay a lot of attention to Mycroft...or me, unless you want something. And for the record, John was my idea." Greg rolls his eyes.
John strokes Mycroft through his orgasm. Greg strokes them together and presses a finger against Sherlock's still slick hole.
John groans as he pulls out of her, his cock shrinking back to a normal size. He climbs up the bed and lays beside her. “Look at you so round and full.” He smiles, patting her taunt belly, he prods it and wobbles it with an evil grin on his face.
Sherlock nods and picks Diōnē up, holding her in his arms. “Either I’ve got stronger, or you’re really light.” He smiles.
Sky closes the door and leans back against it pulling him closer. She leans up and kisses him having him press her back against the door.
John smiles and carries Sherlock to his room, tucking him up under the blankets. “I’m going to get your brother. I’ll be back soon.” John says before leaving to head back to the pool.
"I can't believe you told on me." Sky pouts at Turk. "No pouting, little miss. He has more sense than you." Nico scolds. "You could have fallen." Turk frowns a bit. "I've never fallen." Sky sighs and Nico nods.
He blushes. "I.. tie both of us up. I.. I want to be denied my orgasm until I'm breathlessly begging for it."
Greg licks up his length. Mycroft slowly loosens and Greg pushes in two fingers. He sucks gently at the head of Mycroft's cock.
John doesn’t know what to do next. He finally grabs out his phone and dials Mycroft’s number, his blood boiling.
Mycroft frowns a bit. He hadn't meant for her to cut off contact with John. **Apology accepted. Just.. Please try to control yourself.. If you would like, I could pull some strings to get you into a program for your drinking problem. You should try to stop, at least for John's sake.. --MH**
“With you perhaps. Neither of our workplaces know. Didn’t want there to be… any conflicts there. And now that John is like this, Greg’s staying at his own apartment. He’s not happy about it.”
Sherlock whimpers as John pulls his hair before he releases him. He nods and quickly tears his clothes off.
John stands and holds his hand out for Magdala. “I need to check on Sherlock, pray that he’s not in the centre of this.” He chuckles, nervously. “Come with me.”
*Is that so? Should I bring the step ladder then? Or are you going to figure out a way to slow me down?-SH*
"Have you told him that? Those words exactly?" Mycroft inquires, "The two of you need to have a healthy discussion before you run off. I consider the entire Watson clan to be in my care, and if John takes off after you... He won't like me when I bring him back."
"Yes yes. I love my brothers cock. Feels so good. Makes my pussy so wet. I love being your slut. Need to be your slut."
John sighs loudly. "No. Don't do that, Mycroft. You did all you could within your power. The bastard just hijacked and broke your bugs and cameras." He slumps against the uncomfortable seat, twiddling his thumbs.
Mycroft presses his forehead into Greg's shoulder, shuddering, feeling his lover's cum warm his insides.
"Alright alright. Let him breathe." Chloe pushes her brothers and sisters away to give Zack some space.
Camille smiles and squeezes John’s arm. “Hello Greg.” She smiles softly. “I just wanted to speak with you a bit. You must be confused right now, I thought I could answer some questions.”
“She’s just so perfect. She knows exactly what I need when I need it. A few days ago she pressed me up against the wall and fingered my soaked cunt until I was squirting over her fingers.” She whines, knowing there would be a growing wet spot in her panties if she had on any.
Molly chuckles softly. "Don't let her bully you." She says to the nurse, smiling, as she gets into bed. She lays down with a sigh.
“My love, there is nothing at all you should feel sorry for. That was fucking amazing. You are gorgeous. Honestly the best sex I’ve had in my entire life.” Greg lays down next to him.
Sherlock whimpers as John teases his body. He gasps softly and stiffens when he finally presses his finger into him. This all was so new to him, but it felt strangely good.
“Mm lucky for you I’ll let you do pretty much anything you want.” She purrs, kneeling on the bed in only her bra.
'Talk to me. Tell me how I look. How it feels.' She purrs and sucks his cock like it's her favorite things to do in the whole world.
He breathes heavily, sputtering a bit. "I.. I just.." He sniffles. "My mum told me to apologize for taking John but I needed him. I felt like he was going to leave me and I needed him. But now I'm going to take him away for a while and Carol won't be able to have him and I just.."
"Ah." John gives a nod when she waves at them. "Well they seem to be getting on. That's good." He shifts awkwardly on his feet not sure what to say to his ex.
Mycroft growls, nearly primal as he fucks her harder, faster, deeper, moaning as his balls slap against her clit, moving one of his hands to push a few spit slick fingers into her arse. "You know I love it. Love fucking my baby girl's pussy. I'll fuck you right after you push out my babies, filling you up again. Mm, maybe I'll fuck a baby into Mummy so both of my girls can give me babies. I want you to record the sessions in the whore house. Every minute. I want to be able to watch it again and again."
"Race dune buggies and dirt bikes. It's actually really pretty out there. It gets to hot in the summer and the engines overheat so it's mostly a winter things."
Anthea smiles back and blushes a bit. "Who ready to go check on Sherlock progress?" Lydia asks and smiles.
“I believe he can. His ancestor was able to cast curses, I believe that power may have passed down to the man here today.” Mycroft explains. “If he is unable to do it, and harms her in any way, I shall take full responsibility for it.” He explains.
“He’s a lot like you, actually. He’s a doctor and was in the military. Cool under pressure and knows how to boss people around to get a situation resolved. What would you recommend I do?” Sherlock looked at John, hoping he’d connect the dots.
Sherlock lays John down and pulls the blanket up around him tightly. He kisses his cheek before heading back down to find Margaret.
Sherlock glares at her and pushes himself toward her, gripping her shoulder tightly. "Don't fucking test me."
Sherlock shakes his head. “It’s not that. I’m not. I just... can’t control them. I love you so much, we just need to take this slow. I’ll talk to my Sire when we return, he’ll give us... offerings for doing this, I’ll talk to him about what we can become.” He explains softly. Sherlock links his fingers behind John’s neck and keeps him close.
She blushes and cuddles into him even through her legs are still spread open by the spreader bar which is also attached to the spreader in her cunt.
“Why?” Crystal asks, wanting to know why Mycroft chose the life of an infant over the lives of those women.
He moans breathily. "Christ, it felt amazing.. Fucking someone's pregnant wife, pumping her full of my cum."
Sherlock adds some sauce to the spaghetti and mixes it before portioning it out. He lets John add more sauce and vegetables.
“Mmhmm..” She kisses and nips at his neck. “You cock is in the same spot as your pups are gonna grow. Isn’t that right?” She purrs. “You’re going to knock me up, aren’t you? You’re going to knot me and breed me with your big hard cock. Tell me.”
“How are you feeling now, Sherlock?” Crystal asks softly, finishing another glass with a smile. She had sped up his effects so it was more painful on her but it would be over sooner.
He blushes. "Oh.. I.. I would like to apologize to Carol. I realize you need John in this time and I was being selfish." He hates admitting it, knowing he was in need of John too, that he was hurting.
Molly cringes. "Not looking forward to this." She grumbles, but sat up with Anthea's help and stood slowly, knees shaking slightly.
“How did you sleep?” He asked as he leans against the kitchen counter, watching John closely. “I’m glad to see I’ve not made you feel too queasy.” He smiles.
She whimpers quietly she starts to get wet, pressing her legs together even though she knows David will be able to smell it.
Timothy, on the other hand, sat perfectly still on the sofa while watching his parents corral his older siblings. Sherlock, currently at least
“Because I have Sherlock. You’ll have to ask him, whether I’m allowed.” John says softly. “Humans are different to Gods, a bond is the most important thing in their life, if I got you pregnant, I would be breaking that bond.” He explains. He opens the door to his bedroom and drops Morna on the bed beside Sherlock.
"Don't frown, love. You can always come to me but if I'm in a room and the door is closed I want you to knock first. Then I'll tell you if you can come in or if I need you to wait until I come out to you. Okay?" She smiles softly.
"Please, Daddy! I want to be full of stranger's cum. I want to be leaking so much that I make a mess in the cab."
Sherlock collapses beside the snoring John, on Maggie. He pants heavily, playing with Maggie’s breasts drunkenly.
"Then how are you dealing with your mind? That's right you’re not. You have so much stuff swirling around in your head. You're not talking about it. Your not dealing with it. So how do you expect things to get better if your not trying to make them better?" She frowns.
“I don’t want you to leave. Everything I’ve done since I met you is to get you to stay.” Sherlock sighs. “I had a.. well he called it boyfriend but in actuality he was my pimp.” He looks anywhere but at John.
He frowns and moves to sit on the bed. "I want to. You don't have to talk, I just need to say some things, alright?"
"Lily was brought here by poachers and sold to the highest bidder. I got to her before she was sold. This is also a wild life preserve. All of my animals here have been saved and are protected. We're similar in that way." Sky hums.
Sherlock moans loudly and arches as he feels him deeper. "Can't wait until Daddy can fill my cunt." He cock throbs just thinking about it.
'Mm pregnant people usually find their mate's sent very calming..' Sky hums softly in his head as Chloe relaxes against him and continues to subtly smell him.
John faltered. "Sherlock..." He said, softly. "How long were you.... *have* you been... involved in .... selling yourself?"
He smiles and nods, pulling him closer. "Mm.. Alright.. The boys can do what they want together tonight.."
Mycroft nods. “I know, baby. I feel the same.” He smiles before sliding his fangs down and grazing them over her neck. “Are you sure?” He asks with a slight lisp.
"Is chewing out new arseholes helping fix whatever the problem is?" Harry asks, her voice deep and guttural. Mycroft shakes his head once, making her smile. "Good, then hang up the damn phone and take us on a tour of your bedroom."
She kisses him and gets in position. “I’m gonna feel tighter than usually because there’s more pressure in my pelvis. Okay?”
Sherlock blushes and smiles shyly, kissing him back. "Been taking a lot of cocks. Daddy's having the boys come to his private island to use me all day. I'm making sure I have my arse filled with everyone's cum before we go."
He blushes. "I've wanted to marry you since Sherlock introduced us. My mind was made up the moment you showed interest in me."
He led John out of the hospital and into a big black car. He had managed to convince John that he still needed help, because he had a skull fracture – even though it was slight.
“We can give her a break. She’s started so it’s going to progress now whether we do anything.” Turk nods.
Sherlock smiles and offers his arm to Morna. “Shall we?” He asks, his other arm underneath his belly.
A fourth climbs up and straddles her shoulders, they force their cock into Morna’s mouth and fuck her mouth.
“Mm..” John hums and nods. “It’s interesting to tell you something you don’t already know for once.” He chuckles softly. “There are different sets on the stations of the cross. An older and new version. Basically the same story with different emphasis on a different part.” He nods.
She presses her face to his neck and breathes. "It wasn't you. You were so good. It was me. I just.. Got overwhelmed suddenly.. I'm sorry.."
He cries out and comes hard. “Mm thought I heard a slut.” Cecil chuckles as he walks into the office.
"I'm glad we have a habit of working over dinner... if those papers had been in the car." he says, "Not only would we lose information... but... it's my dads..."
"No, no... I don't think that's it. He's ... Clingy. Like he doesn't want to lose me, or thinks I'm going to leave him in the lurch, but... Well, you know what we talked about, down the pub, last Saturday? About how I feel about him?"
"You make me sound like Lara Croft." Sky giggles. "If your calling me up to do a charity fight it better be a damn good cause because I'm not leaving this bed or this man for anything less than brilliance." She hums.
Greg rubs against his prostate. "Mm a-are you going to come, Sherlock? Are you going to come with my finger inside you?" Greg purrs.
"Mm you can come, baby. I'm going to make you come so many times tonight you're not going to be able to feel your legs." He smirks.
John chuckles and rinses off as well, following Sherlock out of the shower to get dried and dressed.
“I love you, too.” Greg nuzzles him. “Let’s get you out of this suit. I want to see my fiancé naked.” He grins.
Mycroft smiles and pulls out a decanter of spiked blood, from the bottom drawer of the desk. He pours them both a glass and hands one to Camille before moving the decanter closer to her and sitting down beside her. He holds his glass out for Camille to tap with hers.
“Here.” Sherlock turns John and pulls John back against himself. He reaches under John’s belly and lifts gently to take the strain off his back. “Maybe if you got a root beer float they’d leave you alone.” He kisses John’s neck.
Sabine laughs quietly. "That is true." She murmured, thinking to herself. "How..." She swallowed. "How much would a... night, perhaps two... cost to hire you, Irene?" Her voice trembled, nervously.
“I know. I do know that. But I still get jealous over you. So jealous.” Anthea whimpers and wiggles in his cock.
“Mm if you’re going to get me pregnant you need to feed as well. Keep your strength up.” Magdala smirks.
"He was lucky to have someone watching out for him. Not everyone is so lucky. And in a mixed school, god..."
“Mm that’s right. Take it.” The man drains as he pushes down his throat while the other man pulls out of his arse.
John hums and kisses Sherlock’s jaw, “I love you.” He says softly. “Have you ever had... more than one at a time?” He asks.
"Oh... about that," John says, quickly explaining the circumstances of his parent's bonding. Mycroft raises an eyebrow, and says "Remarkable people, having remarkable children."
"Can't wait to burn out that humour you picked up for your slut." Jim says while prodding Sherlock forward with the gun. "Red car. I've prepared the boot just for you."
Greg smiles and falls silence, tracing soft patterns into her skin. “I’m glad there’s someone in charge who cares.” He says after a long while.
‘Always needy. So needy. Can’t live without being fucked and filled. Can’t think unless I have at least three loads filling me up.’
“You heard him boys.” Sam smirks. The man grips his hips and fucks him harder. Another steps in front of the arm of the couch where Collin’s head is and rubs his cock over Collin’s lips.
"I don't think I have much of a choice.. I can't just tell them about all of us being involved with each other."
"How domestic." Mycroft picks up Sherlock's chart and browse through it. "It seems like you can go home tomorrow evening. Tell me Sherlock what possessed you to leap in front of a bullet?"
Sherlock blushes. “No I knew you wouldn’t. You’re not like that. But..” He frowns. “People always leave me. No matter how hard I try.” He holds onto John a little tighter.
"Of course, Crofty." She nearly preens at Mycroft's pride in her. She turns back to the man who's still kneeling. "God I love a man on his knees." She sighs wistfully.
Hank smiles at the thought of his son raising his own children. For so long he and Joann had fretted over John's fate. They'd turned down dozens of bids from alphas who wanted to buy him the moment it went on his medical file that he was an Omega.
As Sherlock's eyes flutter open John nearly cries. "Sherlock, love?" John's voice is soft and somewhat broken.
Sherlock is stunned for a moment before he kisses John back, slowly wrapping his arms around John’s neck. “I’ve upset you.” He frowns against John’s lips. “I’m sorry. Let me make it up to you.” He straddles John’s lap. He can’t make John upset or else John won’t want to stay, he has to fix this.
Greg has grown out his beard since Mycroft had last seen him and his hair seemed to be even grayer. He had more of that hot Dad vibe every day.
"Good boy.. So gorgeous.." John walks around him trailing feather light touches with his finger tips.
Mycroft trembles and nods. He feels awful, his immediate response is to shut down. He takes a deep breath, closing his eyes and trying to calm his mind like his therapist had taught him.
‘Make sure you knock me up this time. A nice big litter. I want to be so full I can’t even walk.’ She whines, drooling.
Sherlock sits down opposite Pythia and shrugs. “She’s been abused for so long. Even before she was turned. I thinking moving past that and knowing how much she’s worth, that will help her.” He explains.
“When in debates, if Kia calls me her dad, then it’s seen as bias, and that it’s an unfair debate and vote.” John explains.
"Yeah well, I'm not a bloody actor." John spits out and stands. "I can't just sit here anymore. I'm done waiting."
“Thank you.” John blushes. He smiles as Sherlock comes in with Samuel. “Congratulations, Daddy.” He chuckles and shows Sherlock his son and Shaun.
“Im always loving towards you. Even when I’m shouting.” John chuckles, that floaty feeling lingering.
"Yeah the toxicology reports just came back." Molly hands him the reports and Sky let's go of his hand.
Sherlock smiles, “can we go back to our bed, Will it be big enough for the three of us, and all our children?” He asks.
He smirks and squeezes gently, pulling him forward a bit. “How about we drop the innuendo and you tell me exactly what I can do to you?”
Sky stands there in the bathroom and watches Michael in the mirror as he wipes away blood that she can reach without hurting her wound. "Thank you.."
"Merely stepped wrongly and kicked the desk." Mycroft said, swallowing a whimper. "I told you to stop arranging all the furniture slightly to the left, didn't I?"
She gasps and moans, legs spreading a bit for him. 'Want you to fuck me. Need you. Take me over and over. How ever you want. As much as you want. Just need to feel you.' She babbles.
John laughed quietly. "Not above bribery, then." He muttered. "Must be a family trait." His eyes shone with laughter. He took a half of the grilled cheese sandwich and took a bite, just as his stomach grumbled.
"I love you, too. So much. Talk to me. Please." She begs and whimpers as she rubs herself over her panties.
“I think we’ve established we want to be together.” John smiles softly and squeezes his hand. “And I’ll keep believing that until you tell me otherwise.”
Sherlock listens intently, taking in every bit of information John gives. He memorizes everything and files it away “I think it does. I.. I’d like to be that four our pups.” He says softly.
“Everyone knows. Everyone was there. Mrs. Hudson cried. Greg was your best man.” Sherlock nodded. “Oh umm… Greg and Mycroft have been secretly dating for a few months now.”
"It'll only take a moment then you can get back to the sea creature.." He smiles and puts sunblock on Sherlock's back. "Besides if you get a sun burn we won't be able to touch you." He purrs softly and nuzzles him.
John nuzzles into Sherlock, “Greg’s going to be okay. He’ll listen to Camille, I promise, he’s a copper.” He whispers.
“Mm. You’re going to leak through your trousers. Everyone will be able to tell how horny you are. How much of a slut you are for Daddy.”
He gives a nod before turning his attention fully to filling out the paperwork. It takes almost the entire rest of the session for them to answer everything and by the time they're handing them back there's only ten minutes left.
"Mmm?" Mycroft hums, carefully lowering himself to his knees, so that he was facing Greg's cock. "Tell me?"
He blushes brighter and leans in to kiss him, stopping just a bit from his lips, making sure Zack truly wanted this as well.
"Come for me, Gregory. Make a mess of your pants." He growls and nips at his neck as he strokes him faster.
"I heard Greg leave for a run so I thought I'd come see if you were awake." He smiles and kisses him softly.
Sky swishes her tail excitedly, having to sit curved because her belly is to big for her to sit normally.
Mycroft continues to drink, he will take it easy once he’s full. He’s so hungry. Still so hungry, he needs more blood.
Finishing his food, John scoops a bit more curry onto his plate and swipes some Naan through the sauce.
"It's up to you, Locky, but you'll basically be going in there naked." She hums as she caresses her knives lovingly.
John smirks as he waits for the kettle to boil, having already put tea bags in mugs. "Science, eh? Is this also for science, you horny bugger?" He looks over his shoulder and quirks a brow.
Cecil pulls his fingers out and pushes into Mycroft, moaning loudly against his neck as he pushes in all the way. "Such a good boy for Daddy.."
Ms. Cheyenne smiles softly as his cock leaks against her, trying to decide if she should wake him up and let him fuck her of if she should let him cum against her in his sleep.
Udos smiles, “you’re very sweet Sherlock. It makes a change of pace to what it’s usually like here.” He says softly.
Mycroft rolls his eyes and kisses Crystal hard. “Is there any other phrases related to you?” He winks before adding, “you can take a horse to water...?”
He gasps and moans softly, already half hard from his dream and getting harder from Mycroft. “I was dreaming about how Daddy used to take us out on the boat. But now I was dreaming about him sailing to that secret island that he has. And you and him fucked me all day on our own little island. All the guys were there. We left all the girls home. You all took turns fucking me on our private island.” He blushes brightly and whimpers.
"Of course I did. There's no where else I'd rather be.. Besides where would I want to go if you weren't there already?"
John pushes the phone back at Sherlock, "I don't need to see it." He sighs, "it's fine. I just wish you'd told me. Here I was thinking this neighborhood was full of people ready to mug me."
“How is he? What happened? Is he going to wake up? How extensive was the damage?” Sherlock’s questions came out almost as rapidly as his slamming heartbeat.
He hums, smiling back at her softly. "I could give you a massage, we could take a bath, whatever you want."
“Yeah?” John raises a brow. “I thought the last time I let you in the kitchen the toaster somehow exploded.” He chuckles.
He mewls as Collin starts to thrust into him, leaning in to do what he had seen John doing, swirling his tongue around her clit. John smirks as he slowly rocks his hips.
"Mm we named Daniel after Carol's mum's dad. I suppose if it is another boy we could name it after my mum's dad." Collin hums. "Yeah. I've always liked Nichols." Carol nods and smiles.
“Babies usually like the silky feeling.” John smiles and hands it to Jared. Jared smiles happily and holds it close, rubbing the silky wings.
Mycroft felt his hips cant into Greg, before bearing down on Greg's finger. "Gr... Gregory..." He moans. "So good, so, so good..."
John presses close to Sherlock and wraps his arms around the pregnant man. He kisses Sherlock softly and slowly.
He takes a moment to try and gather the nerve it will take before finally speaking. "I still love you."
Sherlock feels his heart clench and he swallows heavily, his eyes burning. “Let’s go see Uncle Mycroft, yeah? We’ll see if he can help Papa..” As much as he doesn’t want to, he leaves and goes back up to the room, hoping Mycroft was still there.
John nearly pulls out of her completely before pushing back in, knowing he was right against her cervix.
“Really? That’s not super villainy at all.” She frowns. “Why stop the mission?” She asks, searching his mind for information about ‘the creator’.
Mycroft smiles at Crystal and kisses her cheek, before picking Camille up carefully. He leaves the room before speaking. “I’ll take you back into the bedroom you and Sherlock were in, Sire. Is there anything I can get you?” He asks.
Eli frowns as he looks at John. “It’s not him. It sounds like it’s a hospital.” He hands John the phone. “You should listen.”
Leona smiles, “such a tasty little vamp.” She spanks her thigh hard, get undressed. “Tell all the needy witches there’s still someone gagging for cock.”
“I told her to be careful. She doesn’t listen to me.” He sighs. “Does she want me there? Do you think I should come?” He bites his lip, knowing she’s having his triplet girls.
This time you’ll have plenty of people come home to. Rosie and I and Mrs. Hudson and everyone else. You’ll have Rosie to take care of and me to take care of both of you.
"Michael!" Sky moans loudly and arches. Jean holds Michael's hip in one hand as he fucks him harder and squeezes Sky's breast in the other as he bites at her neck.
Mycroft moans loudly as John pushes into him, rocking back a bit before forward into Rachel’s mouth.
Sky smiles and kisses him softly. "It's going to be fine. I wouldn't put you in a situation where you would need to worry." She nuzzles him.
"And it's as easy as that." She muses. "Get dressed and ready to go." She smiles and leaves giving them some privacy.
Sherlock takes Morna’s arm and stills her. “Why don’t we wear something skimpy and matching, I feel like putting on a show with you.” He beams.
John leaves money on the table knowing Angelo won’t take it otherwise. He puts the ring box in his pocket and follows Sherlock out.
Carol smirks and licks her lips. "Sherlock, get on your back on the bed. Collin, stretch Sherlock. Mycroft, stretch Collin enough for you and John to both fuck him." She orders.
“How about I take you out? On a proper date. Food, some shopping, an activity. I want to take my husband out.” John smiles softly.
Resting his head against Sherlock's chin he takes a sip of his drink before placing it back down. He then closed his eyes. Taking a few calming breaths he focuses on his heart rate. With one hand pressed against his pulse point on his neck he does his best to send Sherlock a vague idea of its rhythm.
Mycroft gasps. "Fucking slut.. You just want my cock.. All the time.." He grunts and pulls him closer.
"Do I even want to know what everything means?" Greg asks. John goes down stairs to get the door after the door bell rings.
“Years?” Mycroft asks. “How about we have some fun?” He smiles. “Grow them all to the biggest they can be. Years old, and we’ll walk you out to the other Gods, see what they make of you.”
He blushes brightly. "A plug in my arse and a vibrator on my clit. I want to be brought to the edge of coming and kept there."
“Besides you have your schooling to focus on.” Sherlock nods. “Now finish your breakfast and get your chores done before your grandparents get here. You know how your grandfather likes to go through your research step by step.” He chuckles.
"Good. Let's go up." She smiles and leads him upstairs. Collin meets them at the door. "Ah I was wondering if I'd see you up here tonight." He smiles at Zack.
John moans and bucks his hip. He pulls Sherlock down by the back of his neck and kisses him deeply. "You're so fucking brilliant. So sexy. I love you so bloody much." He growls and nips at Sherlock's lips.
“Yes you do. It’s so little and bite-able.” Sherlock smiles, “and you make the saddest, puppy-dog eyes. We’ll talk about it more when I return. I love you John. Really. More than anyone before. I’m glad I was made a vampire for the soul reason of meeting you.”
John and Sherlock instantly stand and walk quickly to the next room over. Sherlock reaches his brother first and takes in the pinched expression. He pales instantly and grasps John's arm.
Sky hums as she Zack. "How long have you been staring at that thing? Cause it's not gonna hit you first." She asks as he looks at the punching bag.
Sherlock seems thrown by this. “You’re a doctor. A good one by the number of patients in and out of the office and how relieved they look after they go. You served in the military but were injured. Probably why you were sent home. Sexuality and gender therapy is odd though. Something you experienced in your youth. Perhaps a friend or family member not accepted for their identity spurred you on to learning all you can and making a safe space for them. You push people just enough to where they really think but not enough to break them open. For all intents and purposes a good man.”
Dave obeys, barely rocking his hips into her, just enough to make subtle movements. He continues to suckle from her, moaning as she leaks into his mouth.
Sky smiles and puts her coat on as a worker comes over and hands her a bowling pin as a prize for getting a perfect game.
He whimpers, keeping his hands by his side so he doesn’t touch himself without permission. “S-Sorry, sir! J-Just like being humiliated.”
"Yes it does." John turns to Mycroft. "I think it's past time for you to call in your people. Don't you?"
“I remember.. I remember being small. Running around with no clothes on. No one wore clothes really.” Mycroft shrugs.
“Mrs. Hudson likes the little sewing kits. And I give you the candy to experiment on.” John chuckles.
She purrs as she’s carried, staying in his cock. “So how have you been?” She hums, straddling his lap and kisses his neck.
Magdala hums and wraps her legs around Crystal’s waist. “Drink.” She begs, “Yes, Yes. Bite me. Please god above, bite me.” She moans. She wraps her arms tightly around Mycroft not wanting to let him go.
"Mm yeah. Just a bit hungover." She hums softly, relaxing back into him, always feeling better when he touches her.
"Mm, that's okay. When you're ready." John said with a nod, understanding what Sherlock was trying to say. Holding his hand out in silent question he gave Sherlock a gentle smile.
"I've noticed," John can't quite believe how amazing her room looks compared to what it was before when he had been living at Baker Street. "This and sugar...I'm lucky she wants to stay with me at all."
'I'm trying. I'm trying so hard but it won't work until he's gone. Until I never have to hear his voice in my head ever again.' She pulls away, not wanting him to see her cry.
Sherlock concentrates and focuses on giving John his energy for a few more seconds before pulling his hand away and kissing him gently. “This could be the reason he was so harsh on you, but please take my apologies until John wakes.” He says softly to Margret.
“She tried to kill me. I feel that was only fair.” Greg hums. “She would have killed me if my blood wasn’t poisonous.”
“A human?” Mycroft raises a brow as he looks at the card, frowning as he sits. “Better help? From who?” He frowns deeper.
Sky has Turk sit Matt on a bench in the shower. “Go get the stuff ready for him. I can handle this part.” She smiles softly and stretches up, kissing Turk softly.
“Mm you love it.” Crystal purrs and leans in, gently kissing the head of his cock so light he can barely feel it.
Anthea takes his hand and kisses his knuckles gently. “Then it’s settled. We’ll bond.” She smiles softly.
“No, John.” Sherlock wraps his arm around John and holds him close. “Never. I love what we have. I’ve never been happier in my entire life.”
Myropis moans as he watches the two pregnant men try to press closer, their bellies in the way. He comes deep into Morna’s throat as he cries out in pleasure. They were his. Completely and utterly under his command and he was going to love every second of it.
“Mm I get to pick your punishment right?” Greg smirks. “I think George and I should fuck you and make you wear the cock ring. Then when you’re near bursting we’ll make you come deep into Sky so all our babies can be carried together.”
He takes a shaky breath and nods. "I've never loved anyone more than this.. I.." He gives a small, breathy chuckle. "C-Christ, I was willing to give her a kid.."
“It’s interesting. They seem nice. But it’s all guys?” Morgan asks. “Yeah I dunno. That seems weird. They said there was more in their group. I wonder how big it is.” Wanda nods.
"Okay good.." He signs and smiles. Lydia smiles. "It shouldn't take to long. A few hours and then he wakes up down in the surgery bay. I'll keep John down there for a bit because it's quiet and it's going to take a bit for him to adjust to hearing again.." She signs and says.
She gasps and moans as she grinds against his leg. She kisses his jaw and neck. "I need you to fuck me. I need it. I need you inside me. Please, Michael." She moans his name bowing it drives him mad.
“It’s his choice in the end. He can either live with you forever, or be your King for fifty or so years.” Mycroft says softly. “It’s what he would prefer in the long run, because every day that passes he’s growing older and you’re not. Believe me.” He says sadly.
"I love you, too." John kisses his shoulder and carefully rinses his hair. He takes the soap and washes Sherlock's chest with his foamy hands. He rubs over his collar bone, down his chest, over his nipple.
The sight of Sherlock skipping in any capacity has John grinning like an idiot. "Yeah, he still has the same heart, deep down inside."
“Yeah something like that. Mind if I crash here tonight? I’ve brought beer as a bribe and payment.” John chuckles, holding up the beers.
Crystal hums softly as she cooks, turning over the sausage and bacon. She cleaned as well as made a bouquet of fresh flowers for the table.
I mean, I do, you're my best friend. But I don't just want to like you as a friend. I want to like you more, I want to love you. I want you to love me. I want us to be an actual family, with you listed as Rosie's legal father. (Adoption, not just guardianship) I want these rings to be something real, not just a token to ward off unwanted attention.
He blushes at the praise and starts to rock between them, slowly thrusting into Sky and back against Jean.
“Yes both. Please both.” She begs. “Dark!” She gasps and moans loudly, trembling as she feels his tongue in her arse. “Mm isn’t that a sight.” Darius smirks and pushes deep into Sky’s mouth as it hangs open.
"The person that has the flat next door is an entomologist some of his creatures escaped." She hums.
John cuddles Lydia close. “You’re going to have to help look after Maggie, make sure she’s comfy and got plenty of food and drink.” He smiles.
He mutters about it not mattering if he wore pants or not. He gets up anyway and started to pull on a pair of his skinny jeans.
“I know.” Crystal smiles softly and kisses him back. “If.. if you want to fuck Magdala that’s fine with me. I don’t.. I don’t know how long it will take me to get comfortable with you doing something like that to me though..” She says softly, looking away again.
Leona nods. “You’re- aahhhh- going to make me a quivering mess.” She moans. “Harder. Harder, oh fuck, through the bed.” She begs.
“We need to be home before dinner.” He smiles softly. “Please pretend to not know anything about it. They have worked hard on this.”
“Ummm..” He counts on his fingers. “Like forty ish? I think?” He hums. “That’s not counting the babies though.”
Greg takes a few deep breaths and pulls away. He smiles softly. "I'm going to go get dressed. Okay, hun?"
He gasps and moans breathily. "Yes.. your slut.." He tries to rock his hips. "Make me fill you over and over again. Until I can't come anymore."
Sherlock shakes his head. “But... not rough, I’m not ready for that again after last night.” He says softly, taking her hips and squeezing them. “What’s John’s ideal shape then?” He asks.
She kisses him deeply and opens his pants, stroking his cock. "I love your cock. It feels so good. So big and hard. A love it." She whimpers needy.
“Be good or I’ll give you another pup to carry.” Sherlock teases, nuzzling John’s cock through his pants.
He moans and pulls her into a harsh kiss. "Fuck, if you can go again, I'd fucking love to watch you grind against my leg."
He gasps and pushes his arse back into his hands. He blushes and mewls finally accepting Sherlock words like he never had before.
“Sherlock had a lot of improvements to make anyway. He’s grown up a lot since you came into his life and even more since Rosie was born.” Greg hums.
“Of course.” He deepens the kiss slowly. “Mm we leave in a few hours. By the time we get back in a few days you should be good and knocked up.” He nips at his lips.
“Oh sweetie don’t even worry about it. You did much better than I hoped. The first time I did it the egg exploded when I just looked at it.” Margaret laughs and cleans up. “Try again. Come on.”
Greg frowns a bit and takes him outside. He lights a cigarette for Mycroft and then one for himself. "You're quiet, My.. It worries me when you go quiet.." He says softly sounding concerned.
Greg's hips jerk a little every time Mycroft hits his prostate. "Oh Ahhh please, Sir. Oh fuck I'm going to come oh fuck. Yess yess, SIR!" Greg nearly shouts as he comes.
"Mm, think about it mum. Do whatever you want. Even if you just get a nursing degree. There's a lot you can do with that. Half the time they do more than the doctors anyway."
He smirks. "$35 for the chance to knock up a slut in the fucking loo? Don't mind if I do." He starts to thrust roughly immediately. "No condoms or nothing, such a dirty whore."
"Mm yes. She really deserves some lavished attention, doesn't she?" Jean smirks and nibbles at her back making her squirm.
When he came out twenty minutes later he's dressed in pyjama bottoms and a soft cotton t-shirt. Normally he slept without a shirt on. But he’d once more or less told Sherlock he had a scar on his shoulder from the bullet wound he’d received in Afghanistan. While he did have a scar, it wasn’t from that. It was from the wound that had killed him eons ago, and it wasn’t on his shoulder. It was just below his left collarbone. Death wounds were the only scars that would remain on a vampire’s body, and he wasn’t ready to explain that one. Not just yet.
John goes off and gets two large books. “Here we are. I’ve been trying to got around the books in order.” He explains. “Which one would you like?”
“Yeah?” He pulls him closer by his hips. “How do you want to be submissive?” He kisses along his jaw.
“Mm whatever you want, baby. I’ll give it to you.” He groans and fucks him, rubbing his g spot and prostate at the same times.
Sherlock thinks, his brow pinching a bit. “I don’t think it was sudden. I think it was a slow progression but the moment you limped into my life it was never the same. That’s when it started.”
"Isn't that right, Sherlock? You missed having Collin's cock in you, yeah?" Sherlock whimpers and blushes from under Mycroft, rocking his hips.
"They lured the last line. The end wasn't that fine. Their lives weren't worth a dime. To find the hands look at the time.." Sherlock reads out loud as John writes.
Carol cries out as she comes hard, squirting around his cock as she feels him against her cervix. “Your whore, Daddy. Fuck, I can feel you against my cervix. Just a little bit further, Daddy, that’s where I want your cum. Want you to put it directly in my womb. Please.” She begs, leaking all around George’s cock.
John laughs softly. "Better." He mumbles, licking at Sherlock's shoulder, the tang of blood making his frown slightly.
Sherlock looks quickly. “There’s a path there. It hasn’t been used in a long time. But it’s definitely an over grown path.”
Mycroft frowns slightly. "Of course I meant it. I'm incredibly happy and proud for you. No matter what, I will always love you, Sherlock."
"Good boy. Get on your hands and knees while staying on the bed. Put your fantastic arse in the air for me."
“It’s alright. Next time.” Diōnē squeezes her hand gently, smiling softly. “Maybe we should go out and visit the coven. I’m sure someone there will volunteer.”
"I suggest getting another one and making sure it's not broken before you put your hands all over the evidence."
Sky blushes and spreads herself open with her fingers as she opens her legs wider. “Have at it.” Turk chuckles.
"Mm where do you think?" Carol purrs and rubs her hands down over his chest as she stands behind him, leaning in to his his neck.
"That was fun. I liked your cock the best. It always makes me feel the best. No one else can make me feel the way you do." She hums still out of it, relaxing as he washes her.
"Daddy, please.." He begs, rocking against him. "I can hold a vibrator to my clit so I can keep coming while you fuck my face."
"Mm I can make you whatever you like, baby.. Pancakes, eggs and bacon, or your favorite cinnamon toast?" Greg hums softly and rubs his thumb over Sherlock's sharp cheekbone.
"Everyone will be getting up soon." She hums softly and bites her lip. "They're going to want to... Talk." She frowns a bit.
John leans in and whispers to his to him. “I’d kiss along your cock, looking up at you as he dragged my tongue over it.” He nibbles at his ear gently. “Then I’d kiss lower, putting your legs over my shoulders as I teased your arse with my tongue.”
Helping Sherlock up the stairs when they got home, John set the box down on the desk and set about making tea.
"Drink up. I'm sure she has plenty. Don't you, sweetheart?" Violet smirks. "Mm yes, ma'am. Feels so good." Sky moans.
He hums and nods. "I know. He's so soft spoken it's hard to remember that he's actually a strong person." He massages his shoulders and neck.
She blushes a bit. “I wish there were more.” She hums as the next contract comes up. This time a young woman comes out onto the stage, barely looking 18. Her contract price quickly skyrockets.
John growls and nips his lip and grinds against him. "Mm what do you want? Do you want to watch me bounce on your big cock? I could ride you for hours just holding you there at the edge. Not letting you come but I'd be so full of your cock I wouldn't care. All of be able to think about is how good it feels to fuck myself on your cock. I'd use you like a fuck toy."
He groans as she pulls him deeper and kisses her hard. “Such a dirty fucking slut. I’m going to fuck you in front of our kids just so they know what a cock hungry whore their mother is. So they know how badly you want to be fucked and filled with babies.”
Crystal thinks for a few minutes. “Come with me.” She hums and gets up, pulling on a robe as she leaves the room.
“Besides I don’t usually eat children, unless they’ve been naughty. Have you been naughty Kia?” Sherlock asks taking her foot and pretending to go for a bite.
