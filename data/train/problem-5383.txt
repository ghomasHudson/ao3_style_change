“I’m fine,” he says, not opening his eyes that he hadn’t realized until now were closed. The dark is nice. “I’m fine, Nat. I swear—“
Death didn’t respond other than to caress his face when he visited their graves, reminding him of her inevitability. Reminding him that if he was lucky, he would someday leave someone without answers, too.
The only time Tony ever heard Jarvis yell was when he wasn’t supposed to. Howard had been drunk one night and Tony had been stupid, running into the workshop because he’d heard a terrible bang. And when he found his father bringing himself out from beneath jagged scrap metal, Howard was furious.
Steve didn’t want him. Obviously. He knew that. Tony had known that, had always known that, would always know that. He’d known, and yet he’d tried to kiss him. Because he was an idiot. He’d made the man uncomfortable, and probably ruined their friendship which was just starting to get somewhere—Steve had just started coming down unprompted to the workshop with a sketchpad just a month ago.
When there’s no response to his dumb joke (Steve almost always laughs, even if Tony’s not funny), he looks up from the vibranium trousers he’s making to see what’s happening.
“Whatever you’re gonna ask me to fix,” Tony started. He tried, but he couldn’t keep his head from lulling until his chin hit his chest. Fuck, it all hurt. “Whatever you’re gonna make me fix… Have you tried turning it off and on first?”
“Perhaps a rematch soon then, Captain? When you have recovered your strength?” Thor asks, obviously eager and pleased with himself for having won without even using any of his supernatural abilities.
He also thinks of the team, wonders if they’re sad. Thinks of Natasha flipping the dagger he gave her as a Christmas gift to distract herself, Clint steering clear of the workshop vents, Thor bringing rain upon the tower, Bruce trying to cook a dinner nice enough to bring them all into the same room. All of them there at the dining table, talking about how much they’re going to miss their shellhead.
The blow only made the aching in his head impossibly worse, like his brain was in a blender. But worse than that pain came the guilt. Tony knew he shouldn’t feel wounded as deep as he did since it was received from this asshole, but the familiar sickness still sank down deep into his stomach; settled there heavy.
Space wasn’t as beautiful. Streaking through the stars and supernovas couldn’t compare to what it had felt like when Steve had pressed his lips upon Tony’s— couldn’t hold half a candle to what it felt like to be told “I love you” and have it be sincere.
Maybe if he hurried back in, said the right things, held Tony in the tenderest of arms, kissed him slow and soft, steady, not too strong, it could work out and they could—
For what feels like the millionth time in the past few days, Steve’s heart breaks. Because Tony really doesn’t know how much he’s loved— doesn’t know that no one can sleep, Pepper won’t eat, Rhodey took an indefinite leave of absence from work and Steve—Steve can’t take this bullshit.
“What do we—“ Steve begins, but something catches in his throat. He coughs out of pure habit, knowing logically that it’s grief. The feeling of never quite catching his breath isn’t ever really going to go away. “What do we do?”
They’re trying to be careful; it’s obvious Tony is injured and Steve is in no state to be getting out of hand, but they’re fire and gasoline. Steve douses the ground and Tony strikes a match. Each gasped breath between desperate kisses is an inferno. They’re burning alive.
He hears Natasha affirm his judgement from somewhere to his right: “That’s literally the least funny thing I have ever heard you say.”
“Mister Stark!” Peter beams (an adoring Maria already superglued to his leg), like he’s still the fifteen year old fanboy Tony met in Queens so long ago and not the top-of-his-motherfucking-class-at-MIT-Jesus-chrIST-is-tony-proud adult he’s grown into.
And when Tony inevitably ended up injured or worse (Steve doesn’t deserve a quarter of the faith they put in him), they’d feel like it was their fault, too. And these people— these good to the soul of their beings but heavy with all the grief and guilt of the world people— didn’t need that on their conscience.
Tony, who was usually too proud to accept comfort especially of the physical variety, just fell apart. He was too weak to brush Rhodey off, make up some lie about how he’d be okay, get him to stop combing his fingers through Tony’s hair like how his mom and Jarvis had when he was young. He clung tight to Rhodey that night, and Rhodey, not because he wanted Tony’s money or prestige but because he loved and cared for him like a big brother he never had, clung tight to him.
He didn’t sleep, but he dreamt. He dreamt with his eyes open. He probably should have seen Peter falling into ash, felt the phantom press of his desperate hands, but he didn’t much dream of him.
The last thing he remembered thinking, before he pulled open the door and saw their somber faces and just knew, was about how he hoped his breath didn’t reek.
Tony doesn’t waste another second, focused and lethal as he slams him into the closet door with a force that dents the wall around it, either completely oblivious or wholly uncaring to Ass Clown’s responding screech.
“With all due respect, Sir, my software which you seem so inclined on ‘dismantling’ had me alert emergency services before you were even in the suit,” is JARVIS cool-delivered, scathing response.
Rhodey found him. Still standing in the doorframe, one hand curled around his stomach (like he was trying to keep himself together) and his eyes wide, unseeing (like he was falling apart anyways.)
“I’m fine,” Steve says, flat. He isn’t hungry. He isn’t thirsty. He isn’t tired. He isn’t anything. Why they’re all pretending that life is going to go on fine for him after this, Steve has no fucking clue.
And Steve closes his eyes so he doesn’t have to see that dead body drop onto the floor, or have to feel like Tony just stole his last hope at coming out the other side of this half the man he was when he came in.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, sounding far louder and more vivid than he had been in Tony’s other dreams. Maybe he was just further down the hallucinogenic line, Tony figured. “Oh, God—“
“Shut the fuck up,” Tony snarls, winding a metal hand around Ass Clown’s throat, effectively blocking the grating sound. “You piece of fucking shit, I should fucking kill you, I should put you six feet into the ground you fucking piece of fucking shit---”
“You mean— you mean, when I was dead” Tony jokes, going for humor. He realizes that it’s ineffective as Steve’s face crumples out of its contented state.
It’s just a cough, really. Nothing particularly special about it; just hacking up some mucus and inhaled saliva like any normal, sick person would.
“I know, Tony,” Rhodey said, voice steady, and it made Tony calm just a little to hear the meaningless platitude. “I know.”
When he lands on the rooftop, the reaction is immediate. The five men startle a little, but then jerk their guns up to their shoulders; so nervous that the barrels on all of them shake. No, scratch that, Tony notes. There’s one man— a bald man with a shitty neck tattoo— who doesn’t do anything. He’s a big guy, too; bulking muscles, heavy shoulders. He’s just standing there, smiling, confident, gun limp in his arms.
A pregnant, questioning pause filled the air before Steve asked, obviously confused, “I don’t think I’m following?”
“Don’t be.” Tony wasn’t sure if he was hallucinating, because the touch felt like lightning and fire, but then Steve’s fingers were slowly tilting up his chin until they were just inches apart. Steve’s sweet, minty breath blew across Tony’s nose, and he could swear that every single hair on his body stood up. “I think it’s cute.”
“Tony?” Rhodey had called, hurrying out of his little piece of shit Toyota Tony couldn’t convince him to quit. Even when he offered to pay for it, not because Tony thought the car was ugly (though it was), but because it wasn’t safe. Rhodey said he’d take the money if Tony would quit drinking. And Rhodey was still driving the Toyota, so one is free to draw one’s own conclusions about that. When Rhodey got closer, saw the look on his shell shocked face, he just asked gently, “What’s wrong? Why are you—“
“I missed you, bud.” Though he’d be content to hug him for hours and never let him get close to danger ever again, Tony knew the action wouldn’t wait for them any longer than it had. So he just planted a quick kiss on the side of Peter’s cheek, ruffled his big, brown curls, and went back to the fight with a new found vigor.
After a few seconds pass and there’s no snarky comment or painful condolence forthcoming, Steve brings his head out of his hands. He should apologize for yelling. It was wrong. Everyone’s hurting right now, Bruce was right.
And he did. Tony was practically screaming into Rhodey’s shoulder where his best friend had him cradled, and he managed to carry them both surprisingly graceful back into their apartment.
When Jarvis came back in to check on him a few minutes later (coming up to tuck the blankets even tighter, pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead, said “Goodnight, Master Anthony. Sleep well.”) Tony feigned sleep because he didn’t know what to do knowing someone loved him enough to risk their whole livelihood for him.
“Never. Again. Don’t forget I’ve got enough dirt to bury you, Mister Stark, and I will if you even think of touching him while I’m on this earth to stop you.”
Steve looks nervous— an unusual thing to see. He’s got his big hands tucked into pockets, his shoulders hunched in awkwardly, face tilting tilted toward the ground. Tony can practically feel the anxiety rolling off him in waves. It makes him uncomfortable. And sad.
“Neither am I”, said Natasha looking at Clint dancing with Laura. She was already over it. She had her chance and she lost it. Clint always says it was the other way around, that Natasha will always be his lost arrow. He says it when he is drunk and not near Laura, he didn’t want any problems with his very loved wife.
Then Steve walked out of the bedroom door, all sleepy, and semi naked, and shivering because of the fever. And Tony knew he couldn’t tell him to wait a year, another one, for him.
“I wasn’t married!” Steve was holding a milk cartoon, and Tony could see it all over the walls already “It wasn’t my wedding day, Tony” he said enunciating every word.
When Tony walked out of the door, Pepper waiting outside, Steve felt as the air was punched out of his lungs. He went back to Clint’s bedroom and took his backpack. He threw it against a wall (would have to pay Clint for it), and he sat at the bed, crying his eyes out, and murmuring a whole lot of thigs that meant nothing.
Inside Natasha was the first dropping the smile, Steve saw the reason for it in front of them, Clint was holding his wife’s waist.
Steve caressed Tony’s jaw, he was going to miss the feeling of his stubble, the fantasy of feeling it between his legs would have to wait a little more than planned.
They made love, as the poets would have said. Deep kisses and long caresses, little ’goodbye’s all over each other bodies.
“You almost gave me a heart attack there for a moment” he said kissing him again in the chin, and then the neck.
“Yes, Tony, that’s what I though. I’m just starting to recover my reputation, just enough so policemen don’t stop me every fucking second while I’m trying to do my job. And now I can’t even do my job because paparazzi are c
“A movie marathon, you super soldier” Tony smiled. Steve did too, he liked making Tony think he didn’t understand certain things so he could see him smile, it was worth it every single time.
“I caught the bouquet” said Natasha, and Steve looked at her with surprise. “Yeah, I don’t see myself marrying soon either”
“Such a gentleman”, Tony laughed and gave a couple of claps in Steve’s shoulder, “but Natasha is a grown woman you can stay a little more if you want”.
“Not my problem you are so eager in the morning, honey.” Steve bit his tight “Ouch, you know I like that, not a good tactic.”
Steve got up and went out of the house, letting his bag behind and a note for Clint saying “Thanks, but sacrifice isn’t the only way, I learned it the hard way.”
Back in New York Steve didn’t want to go out of his house just to face the journalists waiting for him on his front door.
“I’m going to wear it every day, for now to forever.” Steve smiled. “Enough of this, it’s rotting my teeth. Let’s get down to business” he said winking, and took Steve by the hem of the t-shirt he had put on so little time before, and backed throwing them both into the bed, crushing himself under Steve. Just as planned. More or less.
Steve laughed a little, felling a little more like himself “You would have lost too” he said, and Tony smiled at him.
“Yes. Still, I’m buying a motorcycle” Tony said, Steve laughed and made something that made Tony moan “And” he tried to keep going “, and about the apartment. I’ve been looking around here, In Brooklyn, I know you love this place, and we’ll be near Clint, and it won’t be such a great change for you”
Clint didn’t answer, Kate sent and audio “Nothing of your business, but, I’m the better Hawkeye.” After it Clint say goodbye again and Tony did the same. That was a case for another day.
“Tasha told me you needed a shoulder to cry on. And I’m kind of the new psychologist of the group. Also she is in some mission and couldn’t come. This is Lucky, say hey Lucky, you aren’t allergic to dogs, are you?”  Steve didn’t have time to answer “Anyway I haven’t read a single newspaper, and I have Netflix so no TV either. What happened?”
“’Him’ is here” said Tony. Kate shrugged. She showed them everything, and they decided (caps or tails) who was sleeping where. Tony had Kate’s room, it was very very purple, but not as purple as Clint’s that didn’t surprise him. At all.
Tony hit him in the knees, and he fell to the floor face first. He stepped on his wrist and took the gun. The big man couldn’t even react and just put his hands up.
“It doesn’t look like it!” she threw a newspaper at his face. “Do you even care about anything apart from you, Tony Stark?”
But the time came that Tony had to go out through the door. And Steve didn’t have the guts to let Tony go without kissing him.
Tony took Steve by his t-shirt and upped him, kissing his neck, biting it, taking of his t-shirt, not as gracefully as he had thought he’d do it, and kissing his mouth, then pushing him back in his knees, all in less than a minute.
They were just at the other side of the press conference room. Pepper was adjusting her tights, and a woman he didn’t know was attending same small details in his suit, was it his wedding suit? He didn’t remember.
Then everything started to get a little calmer, with the Holidays coming up there where more things to talk about, still they have received e-mails and letters, even phone calls, from LGBT groups asking for their presence in the parade, and magazines asking for a special “Christmas at the Stark-Roger’s house”, what made them realize they didn’t really have a house. They had been staying at Steve’s apartment, but it was too small for Tony.
He opened the fridge and looked for something to make dinner, so he could offer it to Steve as some kind of apologize, he hadn’t had time to think about what to do or say, but he knew they had to talk.
It was the start of a bittersweet goodbye. Their fairy tale didn’t last a day. The whole world wanted it to end, needed it to wait for a little. But it was far more easy saying it than doing it.
The whole room went crazy, questions shouted, and journalist getting up, the members of the staff trying to keep everybody calm and doing an awful job of it.
Tony was sitting next to Pepper in the limo, and feeling her as far away as ever. Pepper didn’t deserve what was about to come. Steve didn’t either. He was the only one that deserved it.
“Look. I just thought maybe, after all that happened, that is still happening, we should… limit our physical contact?”
“I- I’m not talking about not taking the blame. But we can’t just… I waited too long, Tony, and you too. And Pepper doesn’t deserve it either! We fight to make this word a better one, and we have been beaten, hated on, yelled at, never gave a damn about it all, but I’m not going to take a year of lies and burden for the world that doesn’t care about us.”
“There is no ‘this’, Tony” he whispered, and walked towards him again. “We lost it, because we are a couple of idiots.”
Tony turned and Steve looked at him, directly in the eyes, he didn’t look away after seeing him all red and still weeping, even if it hurt him like a knife to the heart. Steve showed him his hand, as if Tony was some kind of scared cat. Then he touched his hair, caressing his face after it.
rounded him. He quickly saw where he could grip, and he was very sorry for Steve’s hair, but if he didn’t hold onto something he was sure he was going to end falling down. It was better than anything he had imagined, and he had imagined a lot. He opened his eyes, almost losing it at the sight of himself sliding in and out of Steve’s mouth. His head knocked back, the wall not hard enough for Tony to even feel it.
“Stop” she said. “After that year or so, we fill up the papers for divorce, you wait a couple of weeks, or a month, and you can give another press conference saying that Steve was your shoulder to cry on, and that feeling started appearing. I give a little interview, saying I’m happy for both of you, and that Tony and I weren’t meant to last forever, and I’m okay with all of it happening.”
Everyone remembered how they used to laugh together, a little too close, a little too soft, so intimate it almost looked like they were telling each other a love poem.
“I…” Steve couldn’t answer for a second. Pepper was far away talking to her friends and family, Steve could say the truth and be on his way, but he didn’t want to make Tony sad.
“God knows I have made mistakes” everyone was quiet the moment he started talking. He coughed, the mic made a horrible sound “I’m sorry. As I was saying, I have been wrong a lot of times, but I think, at least I like to think, every time I came up with a good solution” he looked at Pepper “and the times I didn’t, this beautiful, smart, intelligent and dedicated woman, Virginia Pots, helped me came up with one, serving it to me on a silver plate. It’s for that, that I love this woman-”
There’s no question about it. There’s no doubt in his mind that Tony wouldn’t have gotten through the grief if not for Rhodey.
“Bruce will be here in under a minute— just keep those eyes open, soldier. You listening? Steve? Steve? Don’t leave me, please. Not again, please. Steve?”
And oh fuck, the last rounds of shots really hit him then. Spinning the world up and over around itself, though Steve stayed perfect and beautiful and sad and undistorted in front of him, looking like someone just kicked his puppy and that someone was himself and it all was really hurting now and Tony was too drunk to think around it.
And look. Tony’s kissed a lot of people in his life. Girls, guys, neither, both. He knows how to feel it before it happens; that palpable tension that pervades the air like how wind turns thick before a storm. And every nerve in his body came alive, because he felt it then and there. With Steve. So close he was going cross eyed trying to see him.
He knew it was going to kill him. He felt death, his life-long lover rub her hands up his shoulders to tell him she was coming.
“Tony, we lost you.” Steve looks into Tony’s big, aching eyes. Feels a rush of affection so strong it hurts. “I lost you.”
Luckily, Baldie seemed to have had his full of fun as he laughed to himself, small and refined; a complete opposite of the unhinged man he’d revealed just a moment ago. Tony heard his footsteps pass him, pause at the door for a moment— as if deciding something, before he flicked out the lights and left. Leaving him alone and aching in the dark.
“I promise,” he said, pulling back from her and standing up on shaky legs to make his resolve more prominent. “Everything’s gonna be fine.”
“Tony,” Steve has said, gazing at him with more love than Tony had ever seen in anyone’s eyes. It was amazing. And it was somehow for him. “Can you look at me?”
He knows that people really do believe he’s dead. The man, who’s Tony taken to calling “Baldie”, showed him the live news footage. He proved it via video on his shitty Apple phone (why people still buy from those clowns when Stark technology is objectively better priced and far superior, Tony will never know). Baldie looked on wearing that same cruel smile while news anchors with (in Tony’s opinion) unreasonably somber voices talked over footage of the initial explosion, the blood spilled all over the parking garage, and worst of all— scraps of his armor and obliterated helmet lying destroyed on the pavement.
The AI was, predictably, unamused. “I also believed Captain Rogers’ intent to be romantic. His vital signs were elevated in a manner that suggested typical male arou---”
“JARVIS, just tell me that he can breathe,” he gets out between wild, airless gasps. “Can Tony breathe?”
Imagine Steve’s surprise as Tony’s expression abruptly turns more determined than he’s ever seen it (and he’s seen the man save New York single handedly a thousand times) and then feels the mechanic’s lips crush onto his.
“He went to go make sure the people that took you paid up,” Steve answers, voice hard, almost like he’s jealous of the opportunity. Maybe he is.
Tony had pretended to cave after a few, admittedly well-placed and likely severe-injury-inducing (he already knew and dreaded the fact that Steve was going to freak out about them), punches to his face, ribs, and stomach. He’d just simply let his pain show through the mask; pretended he couldn’t take it when Baldie taunted him. Tony was Academy-Award deserving for the performance he gave--- begging Baldie to stop, sobbing that he’d do what he wanted so long as he please, please, please just let him die mercifully in the end. And Baldie, that fucking idiot, smiled at, unbound, and brought him everything he needed.
“I’m not tired,” Tony says, trying to sound adamant. Truth is, he didn’t sleep to well on whatever pain medication cocktail Bruce has him on. “I’m well rested and ready to go.”
Tony looked around again, at his little family. They were all okay. They all would be okay in the world he’d helped to bring about.
Steve hears the quick inhale through Tony’s nose and understands his time is over; tries to memorize the buzzing, drunk high of their lips touching, knowing he’ll never be that close again. Knowing it’ll be the best kiss of his life and he’ll never get a better one. But it’s okay. Just five minutes ago, Steve had been under the impression he was doomed to live his whole life without knowing what it felt like. And now he knew.
So when they landed, and Nebula took him in hand to lead them out upon the grass (it felt like years since he’d seen anything but red dust), he assumed it was still a dream. Because Steve was there, running up towards him like he couldn’t stand the distance.
“Bruce, I need that sedative now!” Nat shouts from above him. He feels her hand go in his, feels her iron grip come down on his hand. Steve appreciates that. He thinks he’s gonna fall off the earth without it. “Steve, you’re going into shock.”
Within a month of announcing himself as Iron Man, Tony had built a protocol for the event of his death. (Come on, he’s not that optimistic. He knows none of this is gonna end well for him.) He’d programmed it so JARVIS would alert Pepper, Rhodey, then the media in the (inevitable) event he was killed in action. And when the team had moved in—woven themselves into Tony’s life, became people he loved—he altered the protocol so JARVIS would let them know, too.
“Ah, Stark,” Ass Clown addresses, notably nonchalant for someone holding a hostage up by their hair and having a loaded weapon aimed at his head. “Always the businessman. Always with the transactions.”
Rhodey caught Petey before he could fall, and that was how Tony knew it’d be alright. Rhodey had been around this block before. He’d know how to help, how to keep his kid safe. They’d be just fine. Tony was comfortable in the knowledge that he was leaving his sun and his stars with the people that’d never let him burn out.
She wouldn’t curl her fingers around Tony’s little hand, but he still held tight. Squeezed her palm. Tried to tell her in the morse code he learned from whiskey-ruined Captain America comics that it’d be alright.
FRIDAY activated the “EDWIN JARVIS” protocol he’d made so long ago, when death was just a little daydream. But it was here now. Quiet.
He thinks of how Pepper must be holding up, remembers her telling him how he hates job hunting and experiences a surge of guilt at that, but feels better when he remembers just how much money he’d left for her. She could take her time looking. She could work at a non-profit for three lifetimes with what JARVIS had surely wired into her account by now.
“What are you talking about?” The sympathetic voice came closer, and he heard then felt Steve prop him upright on the desk behind him. It felt weird. He almost started laughing. “What’s so funny?”
Steve doesn’t have to look behind him (though he does, because it’s a fantastic view) to know Ass Clown doesn’t have a right hand anymore.
Jarvis, Tony thought with some shock. He didn’t have much time to think about it before they were at it again, loud and clear.
“When we’re out together dancing cheek to cheek,” Steve finished, all in that lovely low register that drove Tony fucking nuts.
Steve feels just as helpless as he watches Tony’s expression devolves from instinctual fury and anxiety into comprehension, shock, pity, while he looks back at him, running his calculating gaze up and down Steve’s new (or, old, technically) body. Steve doesn’t have to be a mind reader to know what the genius is thinking.
“I don’t want to—“ he gasped when he could, but his lungs ached where they pressed against the stupid hunk of metal in his chest and it all hurt and Death was rubbing her hands on his shoulders and he was scared, goddammit. “I don’t. I don’t want to die, Pep— but I think— I think I’m gonna have to and I’m—“
“I think the better question…” he had begun, but the sound of his mouth was muffled by the floor beneath him. Huh. He didn’t remember falling. Didn’t really remember half the things he did that night. “... Is what did you do?”
“It’ll take some time, but—“ Nat starts, quiet, well-intentioned. She just wants him to feel better. Steve sees red.
“No!” Tony had screamed, dislodging the debris around him and shooting out from under it with one single minded focus. One mission.
An electric current shoots up from his stomach where the barrel was aimed— crawling up the wires of his suit.
Maybe it was a cowardly thing to do. But Steve couldn’t take that chance (a certainty, really— we’re talking about Tony motherfucking Stark, here.) So he ran.
“I’m sorry!” he yells, and his voice is an ugly, mangled thing. Tony deserves someone who sounds like an angel, but Steve genuinely thinks this is hell. “Tony, please— please, breathe! I’m so sorry!”
And that makes no fucking sense to Steve. He pulls back then, still keeping Tony’s shoulders tight between both his hands like the mechanic might fall through them if he lets up. Reading his face doesn’t clarify anything; all Steve sees is the same nonsensical sadness mingling with the fresh injuries across his jaw and temple.
“What did you do?” the genius demands, turning back to the man caught in his literal iron hold, voice eerily steady.
He should have been back this morning, because Tony is (or used to be) pretty sure Steve is (was) one of three people in the whole wide world that truly gives half a shit about him.
Steve is smart. Less attached than Tony had anticipated, which hurts, but he understands. He must have finally been made aware of all the chinks in Tony’s incredibly dented armor and figured out that he’s not worth it. Which is smart. Tony can respect smart. He knows from experience after years of fixing cars that some things are so broken, so stupid, so unlovable that they’re a waste of time.
“Edwin Jarvis lived his life kindly,” the pastor had said, like it somehow made sense. Like it made sense that Jarvis was here a week ago, and he wasn’t ever going to be here again. “He will be rewarded in the kingdom of the Lord for that.”
“Two down, boss.” And that was good enough for him as he broke through the last couple walls, nearly crashing himself through the next one but regaining his footing before that could happen.
Because Steve is weak now. He doesn’t know how exactly they did it; he was screaming so pathetically loud and hard in that dark little box they locked him into that he couldn’t hear them talk about it, except little snippets like “—lost over half his weight—“ and “—reverse serum’s effects to—.” And he couldn’t feel anything except the needles; pulling blood and bone and skin and what felt like Steve’s fucking soul out of his body which was somehow impossibly smaller— shorter— weaker — sicker — every goddamn day, until one morning, this morning, the doctors (sadistic bastards) hear him cough.
The sudden sound of Peter’s breath hitching echoed in Tony’s ear, and that made him anxious. Call him an overprotective dad, but it didn’t set right with him. He knew like an instinct that something had gone wrong. Very, very wrong.
“No, Captain.” There’s a hesitation, a silence filled with only Steve’s wordless not-breathing that sounds awfully similar to the asthma attacks he used to get as a sick kid, and then JARVIS elaborates, “I’m afraid I don’t understand the importance of this answer to you in particular. But if you must know, the diagnostics I have run state the electrical shock that was his cause of death immediately stopped his heart and lung function.” Another painful, agonizing, oxygenless moment passes. “I’m sorry, Captain. Tony could not breathe.”
No one’s quite sure how he survived. They took him to the hospital to pronounce him dead, but his heart started beeping before they could zip the body bag. Doctors say it was a miracle.
“Make him breathe,” Steve gets out, choking up what feels like water, blood, snow, snot, and electric wire. “Please… he needs to breathe…”
They didn’t have to elaborate. Tony knew “it” was giving up a normal life to be a metal man, never settling down, never being safe.
“Hands up!” Tony’s voice thunders into the room. (Oh, God, Steve has never heard anything sweeter in his stupid fucking life, he could write sonnets about Tony’s voice, even coming heavily filtered out of the suit’s speakers, it’s so beautiful.) The armor gleams bright, red and gorgeous even in the dismal hotel lighting. Akin to seeing the sun after a million rainy days. “Let go of him, unless you want to lose that fucking hand.”
But he wasn’t. So the day he got out of medical from the malnutrition and poor oxygenation, he drank. He drank, and he didn’t stop.
But Steve isn’t in the mood to laugh. As a matter of fact, he’s not sure if he can even get enough breath into his downright pathetically small lungs to do much more than breathe (and now he can hardly manage that.)
“Because I thought I lost you, not the other way around,”  Steve said, moving their hands closer together without even realizing it as he spoke. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. I made a mistake because I lied to you and I’m so, so sorry, I love—“
“You’re gonna fix our guns, you’re gonna fix my extremis, and— here’s the kicker, Stark.” Tony saw, heard, then felt, Baldie’s boot crash into his rib cage; a sickening crunch echoing in the room. Tony bit down on his tongue, choking down the scream, but it was a close thing. “You’re gonna do all that. You’re gonna do everything I ask. And I’m still gonna kill you.”
“I could make us all some tea?” Bruce offers, heartfelt but see-through. “Steve, you haven’t eaten in a day. With your metabolism—“
“No, you’re not— you’re not crying over me being gone, are you?” When Steve’s only response is to raise his eyebrows, look just as perplexed back at him, Tony continues. “Why would you… You know that I left the tower to you, don’t you?”
Tony doesn’t see who picks him up, but they do it softly. Gently. Quietly. They lay him so carefully on something plush, and forgiving for his aching bones. Tony would like to think it’s how Steve would have done it, if Steve were here. If Tony wasn’t a complete goddamn idiot and could find Steve.
“Ugh, God— can someone please turn it off?” Tony groans. He hears the whole room shift around him; people getting to their feet and rushing to where he is, decides to play to his advantage. “I’m not waking up till that fucking beeping stops.”
He remembered looking into those starry blue eyes that held a new andromeda in them, turned into black holes threatening to pull Tony towards his demise.
“Who did we lose?” Tony asks before Steve can get another word in, devastation plain on his beautiful, beautiful, face (God, did Steve even ever know how beautiful he was? Even beaten to high hell, he’s so beautiful. He’s the most beautiful person Steve’s ever seen.) “Was it— was it Nat? Clint?”
“Yeah, yeah, sure,” Tony says, dismissive. He doesn’t want to admit he’s got a migraine like a bitch because then they’ll want him in bed rest for way, way too long. “I’m all better, Doc.”
Tony’s not really in control of his body when he kisses Steve. It’s an instinctual thing— like breathing. He just closes his eyes, winds his hand in the lapels of Steve’s shirt and just fucking kisses him for all he’s worth.
The cold chill of the early spring wind bites at his exposed arms; nipping up his neck and bringing tears to his eyes, but Tony smiles despite the discomfort. Because he did it. He fought his way free. Not for the first time either. Houdini has nothing on him at this point.
“Tony,” Steve calls, so quiet through his scratchy throat that he doesn’t expect the genius to hear. But he must, because the glaring, glowing eyes of the Iron Man armor look away from Ass Clown to train on him. Watching. Observing. And after a few stilted seconds, in which it’s revealed that Steve isn’t sure quite what to say (maybe, “Hey, love! Miss me? Probably not. Either way, don’t kill him! He’s probably the only person that can fix me!”), the faceplate draws back.
“I fucked up,” the kid choked out abruptly, sounding scared. Which in turn, scared the living hell out of Tony. “I— Mister Stark— I cut the wrong wire.” Every hair on the end of Tony’s body stood on edge. Oh fuck. “We don’t have time, we don’t have time, I have to do something. I have to do something.”
“If you do that, I’m taking Tony with me.” Jarvis’ tone was dead serious. Not a single change of inflection.
But the man is impossibly faster. He raises his gun, flicks the safety and fires before Tony can even blink.
Steve wants to stop coughing. He wants to get up and take a swing at these assholes for all he’s worth; make them feel even a fraction of the pain he’s feeling (and shouldn’t he be able to? He’s Captain America, for fuck’s sake), but he can’t. He’s on his hands and knees, staring at the floor beneath him. Hacking the contents of his pathetic, skinny chest up. Black spots encompassing his vision, swallowing everything he can see and turning it into a terrifying blindness making him impossibly more vulnerable to the already awful situation he’s in.
“Evidently,” Tony responds sarcastically, seeing as he’s still (unfortunately) alive. “Do we have a perp on scene? Or are they making my life unnecessarily difficult?”
“Let’s just take it easy, huh?” Steve suggests, smiling so soft and gentle that Tony’s head goes fuzzy for a second. “You’ve been through a lot in the past few days.”
“I emotionally cannot handle another episode of ‘This is Us’, Pete,” he cut in. Tony thought it over, analyzing risk and reward in the way he’d got very used to doing since he started the whole superhero thing. With a heavy sigh, he gave in. “Alright. Let’s do this.”
“Good work, kid,” he commended, snipping his last red wire as he did so. A sense of satisfaction filled him when he saw the clock stop ticking at five minutes. They still had five minutes, thank God, because apparently, Tony couldn’t focus on anything unless it was six foot and unfairly handsome as fuck. “I’m wrapping up my second one.”
“Don’t coddle him, Maria,” Howard had said, right on cue, catching Tony’s shoulder in an uncomfortably tight grip. When Tony turned to look at him, his father didn’t face away from the coffin being lowered into the ground, but he didn’t need to. The message was clear. His voice was like metal and men that didn’t cry.
None of this is to mention the migraine pulsating with the force of a million heartbeats in his poor head. As it turns out, the stress of life-or-death situations and an enhanced, angry dickbag beating the shit out of you isn’t really beneficial to someone who already had a concussion to begin with.
And the reason it’s so fucking hysterical is that a month ago, just one goddamn month ago, he was worried he was too strong. He fretted over his body; began to resent the fact that he had become a lethal weapon--- shiny shield unnecessary, just an optional accessory. He never really cared about that before, even though he knew it.
Tony examines the scene, feels relief that he was the last one out of the building to avoid civilian casualties, but tenses when he becomes aware of the crowd that’s amassed behind him. They’re snapping pictures his armor, oblivious to the danger they’re in and seemingly indifferent to the fact that they’re within a hundred feet of an active fire.
He’s so caught up in his thoughts that when he sees the sidewalk, he nearly misses it. But he doesn’t dare slow down; knowing men like Baldie usually have ground patrol close to their station. His bare feet bang against the pavement, cutting up the skin there. He hardly feels it. He just needs to get home.
Tony wouldn’t have blamed Pepper if she decided to leave. He was a mess, maybe even worse than after his parents died, and though he tried his best to avoid it, he still dragged everyone through the mud with him. Pepper’s immaculate hands were getting dirty.
But that’s not the worst part. The worst part is he’s plunged into darkness— the suit evidently unable to stand the technical interference. It becomes an iron coffin crumpling beneath him. He falls to the pavement for the second time that day, feeling the full weight of the heavy machine press into his unfortunately very human, very organic, very vulnerable body.
Tony fell silent, and the hot water from the tank over the forge clanked and rattled the pipes. The steaming water made the soap flakes stir and swirl as they melted, easily letting Tony get lost in watching them sprinkle from hands unscarred. Hands that belonged to a clear conscious.
Romani Bucky features heavily in this verse. No understanding of the Roma or Romani culture is needed to rasp this, I think, but if something needs clarified, please do let me know!
If their hands strayed to each other, and their lips lingered in kisses, perhaps, it spoke to their closeness. Or perhaps it spoke to how they both know- with absolute certainty, how much the other means to them. For how close they both came to losing the other, before they ever came together. One to the bottle and inner demons, and one to the violence of man against itself.
He hammered through the nausea, and he sweated out the booze another drop at a time. The air was hot, a fetid stench of rancid sweat, of booze burning out of him mixing with dried old rusty blood. He worked the metal, shaping it a shame, a death, a sin at a time. His eyes watered from the fumes as he plunged the metal into the water, steam billowing up alike fog from the lake near his childhood home.
A family, with Tony and Steve at the helm- guiding and shaping them together, each taking up the slack for the other without thought of when to step up, dancing as naturally together as any ballerina could dream of.
His heart was no longer ash. His body was no longer flesh. The boiling print of blood on his chest, over his heart, would never wash away, for he could feel it sunk into his very soul. Could feel his sins radiating from it to pulse through him, the molten lead where blood should be in a man.
Because he woke to “uh-oh!”s from his kids, hugging each other and giggling together as they pretended to be Teletubbies. He had a recipe for Tubby Toast to try for breakfast, and the day was gonna be a lot of fun, even if it was just him and the babies all day.
Here, he didn’t have others of the tribes nearby, he didn’t have anyone with a Torah, but he had many stories of his Father’s distant kin. He spoke the language, and as his skin darkened in the sun, he looked more the part. He felt nearly at peace with himself, with the world. He had done horrible things, yes, his body had been not his own, his mind a thing to be wiped and programmed… but he could remember himself. Not just himself before the war, or himself the human, but himself the little boy loved by the sun. Himself that was a hero to his sisters for fixing their dolls. Himself that had stood up for Steve and watched out for him long before it was stay with the Rogers or go it alone far too young.
Three nods, and then, messy sounds of eating and smacking lips, but no fighting or arguing, and all three plates were clean. By the time the yodeling singing puppet in the pink house had faded away, Bucky was looking up what items could be delivered in time for the bath.
The choking tension in his lungs breaks, and the scratchy itch in his eyes resolves into fat drips, but he can not make his voice work, for all he tries. So it only makes sense to lean that last half foot between them, to press lips, salty and wet, to their match, to the lips he has dreamed of and never allowed himself.
He could fight- but if he did, every blow would be mirrored. Every shot would be taking out parts of himself too raw and fragile to bounce back, no matter his serum. If it was fight, or the world. If it was fight or Stevie dies… he would, of course he would… but it would be his own death.
He would never scrub the story of Sherriff Rogers brother out of his mind. Could never. That Rogers had been saved by the man, a boy at the time, had learned so much of how he worked from them... had opened his eyes, to how the savages... were people. Too little too late. He could not stuff the genie back in the bottle.
But if Teletubbies kept working their magic, he was more than happy to sit through a thousand hours of a giggling baby in the sun. He yawned and curled up, lifting the phone to take a picture of the family, all sleeping around him in the family nest, the Teletubby nightlight in the background. “Hey love, we’re all just fine. Keep saving the world- between the new miracle of Teletubbies, and how amazing our kids are, we’ve got a happy nest.” He nuzzled the kids again, then drifted off to sleep. And if he dreamed in ridiculous sounds of rising periscopes and childish “Uh-ho!”s, then that was fine.
The phantom feel of the other matching golden one throbbed on his chest despite there being bare skin where he felt it. Where that mark had condemned him as it pressed to him, where it burned into his chest to never leave as the hand pressed there went slack.
The air was filled with the witch hazel and herbs that Bucky had used in making them. That Steve always smelled of. Tony didn’t comment that Steve brought his own. He didn’t fight being shoved into the slightly too hot water or the scrubbing of his body.
It’s hard to find a balance, even here, where they speak the tongue of his Papa and no one thinks of the Howling Commandos. In a place HYDRA forgot, in a place that has no memories or preconceived notions about him besides the way he looks now. He finds simple things to focus on. The bite of plums so dark and black that they speak of flavors he’d only ever tasted in jams before. He thinks it is the fruit that makes him stay here. The familiar people in the building, so run down the water only worked a few days in the months he had been there, despite scores of men working and swearing at the pipes. Even the lilting curses remind him of a time so long ago it seems untouched by all the struggles to follow. Between the language, the people and the bite of the plums, the smell of the cooking in the flats around him, Bucky drifts most nights in safer times.
Bucky laughs softly, rubbing Stevie’s back as he makes a disgruntled noise. “That’s right Theo, he looks like he likes taking things apart just as much as you do. Maybe we can get you some tools like that, so you can play at taking things apart safely, practice with them.” Bucky might as well have not talked at all, because the pumping of the tire has the two enthralled once more. Stevie finally wakes up, face screwing up to cry at having his nap disturbed. He struggles with sign language, hands barely becoming coordinated enough to do it now. His lagging behind his siblings in so many ways frustrates him to tears regularly as he can’t express his upset any other way. Bucky has so much sympathy for it, every time he sees it, and it makes him miss his old friend, the sickly boy that had more gumption than body. “shhh hey, Stevie, shhhh my little Chayim, It’s okay.” Bucky rubs his back and lifts his youngest to see the screen as well. The enthusiasm and joy of the boy getting his little ride along bike trailer set up with his dad makes the smaller boy chortle with delight, arms waving in a jerky and uncoordinated imitation of the screen boy’s actions. Bucky savors the peace for a bit.
Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s wrists. Pressing over the soul marks, over the connections that anchored their fates as intertwined, that said they, somehow, in some way- belonged together.
Stevie is, as usual, a complete dream, dark hair a little halo of wisps around his head, sleepy and nestled easily against the curve of Bucky’s rapidly growing belly where he is gumming his omo’s shirt enough to leave a messy wet spot. The two others are what have him mildly stressing being alone with the babies. The eldest, their little Annie, is wrestling with the fancy “always stays sitting up” teddy bear slightly bigger than she is, and the fact that at nine months old she is winning the battle to pin it says a lot about her heritage. She gets a lot of her stubbornness and fighting spirit from her Alpha. Theo, sweetheart that he is, has had to be pulled away from attempting to disassemble the roomba three times now. With his strength, he’s already managed to break three of them but the intelligence displayed in wanting to see how they work just delights both his parents too much to be annoyed at the destruction. Bucky, as always, is more worried that somehow Theo will hurt himself with the pieces.
It was refined by blue eyes, no condemnation, just grief. Just horror and anguish. It was fueled, by the compassion, in the other print.
“Oh, Tony.” Steve breathed, coming into his space, hands, clean of the blood of Bucky, of the lifeblood of a boy that died to save Tony’s life, despite how it would, could never be half as important as the boy-man whom Tony had cost everything. Including now, his very life.
For Stevie, he brought over a cup with a large set of raised bumps like a maze of stars across it. Stevie loved tactile things he could trace, far more than he liked images of characters. All three children pointed at the TV and signed “more” nearly in synch, and with a laugh, Bucky agreed. “Okay, okay, since you all agree. But you all have to keep eating your food till it’s all gone, okay?”
By the time the leather was finished and the stain set- by the time the shield was complete, his hands shook as his vision waivered. His sweat was clean of booze, and his body felt heavy as lead and like it was hollow at the same time.
“I shut up- hard to listen if you don’t talk.” Tony prodded, the suprasensual side of himself boiling up like some sick pervert in a new dirty novel like
It was a full time job, minding Stevie, and if the price to pay for being accepted into the lives of the Rogers was a baptism… well… he never let it phase him. He couldn’t. Bucky sometimes, in the darkest moments, felt guilt for the heartbreak he must have caused his mother. For how she must have worried for her son, for how he was leaving her, and himself by pieces.
Teletubbies is offered, and Bucky eagerly turns that on by saying “Play the Teletubbies from the first episode.” He is grateful all over again that their house has all these automated tools to hand. It takes Theo a bit to realize the TV has something for him, but ever attentive Annie whips her head around at the first giggle of what looks like a baby in the sun. She plops down, the high pigtails of her curly hair making a perfect pair of stubby wings for the bear as she uses it for what it is intended as- a place to lean and rest. She stares up, enthralled, and Theo joins her as the strange showerhead looking things push up from the grass. By the time it is focused on the clip of a child pushing himself around on a bike, Theo has crawled his way over to his sister and both babies are leaning on the bear, sharing it’s back support as they watch. Two dark heads of hair, closer to black than brown, rest against each other till their hair blends. Both children are nearly silent as they watch. The tools the little blond boy uses have Theo wiggling and making “same!” in ASL again and again.
Tony let the hammer strike the red hot metal again. His heart was pounding still, and if he stopped, the shaking of his hands would make him scream. Four hundred women, children, true innocents, in every way, between just three of the dozens of massacres he knew of. Tens of thousands of bison. An entire way of life, THOUSANDS of people starving, dying because of him.
Bucky begins to worry something is wrong with the show when it repeats the clip of the boy, but if anything all three of his children get more excited. Theo and Annie pumps the bear’s arms and Stevie wiggles and squirms till he is helped to stand to try to do the up and down motion too. He then sits, not on Bucky, but after sharp grunts and pinching at the blue cloth, on the other little pillow chair Bucky had stitched for him, the sturdy corduroy shaped and stitched just so to help him stay sitting upright just like his siblings, but letting him rock as he wanted to. Bucky often has to cajole him into it and away from him. He almost can’t believe all three of his children are entertained, and none of them are getting into anything, or wanting cuddles or- anything. By the time they got to The Old Duke of York two episodes later, Bucky had carefully pulled out the crochet bag, and begun working on the new sweater for Stevie.
Bucky has never been so grateful that Stevie is, for all intents and purposes, a standard human, with the only traces of the serum’s effects being a slightly faster healing speed and a boosted metabolism. Bucky is desperate, and, since his saving grace, Maria, is out right now, Bucky does something probably a bit dangerous, and asks the Television “What is good for Babies to watch?”.
Oh, how Tony felt a fool. How Tony felt the sins of every lauded “victory”. How he dug into the reports, how he had sought anything to disprove the halfblood liar, instead finding only the damnation of ever more proof. Now he had his sins laid bare, an accounting he could not turn away from in any measure...
Steve doesn’t snap back at him, and doesn’t let it stop him cleaning Tony as if he were some toddler that got into mud. But as Tony can’t muster the energy to really care, let alone do it himself, it goes without mention.
Bucky blinks, and then grunts, “Huh. Guess that makes more sense than her trying to make a coat out of them. Wait till I show Steve.” He begins to leave the room, when Tony finally realizes what Bucky just asked. He jerks back, bashing his head and burning his hand, all while shouting. He stumbles from the bench and is pulling his finger up to suck it as he desperately scrambles after the already departed Bucky. “WAIT, NO COME BACK! Why did you ask that???”
Another two episodes later, he was getting the package from the front door.  When he turned off the TV, all three children stared with huge eyes as he showed them his order. “New bath toys, but you can each only play with them if you don’t fuss about the bath.” He signed along as he spoke, and Stevie shrieked, but Annie and Theo both nodded eagerly. The bath was a rousing success, as was the new nightlight. By the time all three were asleep, Bucky had ordered a bunch of new toys and looked up similar shows. He was excited for this Fraggle Rock show, while Teletubbies was a bit simple, he thought he could really love the puppets of the other show.
Nothing could fix this hole inside him. Nothing could fix the deaths he caused. The thirst he felt, the need to crawl into the bottle again grew as everything began to hurt again. As the sheer size of his sins as a whole, of all that he had allowed to happen, piled up again.
“What?! But Pops!” Peter complained. “No buts, Peter. It’s either that or no more Spiderman.” Steve firmly said. Peter made a dramatic groan before nodding his head and said. “Fine. But I want to know who I’m going to work with.”
“-while keeping Peter safe from harm’s way. Steve and I need to be there for him so we won’t be focusing on anything but our son.”
It snapped Steve from his catatonic state. “What do you mean by that? What are you up to Tony?” he asked his husband who began to get out of the bed and went to the phone beside his small office table he had in their bedroom and picked it up. He began to dial a number.
Gambit who was playing with his cards looking bored, Johnny Storm also known as the Human Torch was beside Daredevil, thumping with his iPhone.
“I…yeah. I was going to come here and… Well…ask you a favor?” He asked a little bit shy and nervous since Tony’s entire friends were eyeing him like he was something they wanted to dissect and study. “Favor? Oh! Sure kid. You can always ask me anything. So what is it?” Tony asked, a little edgy. “Oh… I was just going to…uh… I was going to ask if…you can sign this for me...” Peter fidgeted, producing a paper and showing it to Tony.
“If you want we can take this at the basketball gym since there won’t be any practice for today.” Peter notified. Bruce agreed as the two headed out. (
Peter, on the other hand, was hiding in some dark corner where Clint wouldn’t see him. Peter had known from the start he was being tracked by someone; his spider’s sense was alerting him a while ago.
Peter froze on his spot when he noticed Bruce was inside the room as well, sitting on a plastic chair. “Uh…B-Bruce? W-What happened?” He asked. Bruce just eyed him seriously which made him felt uneasy. Bruce sighed before saying.
. His sense screamed for him to move aside and he obeyed wordlessly, moving to the left as an arrow missed him by an inch, passing his right ear.
“Okay it’s just that. I don’t think it’ll be a good idea if your room is beside us. I don’t want to scare you when you hear Steve and I are doing it, going at it all night or something.” Tony said with a playful look. “Oh my god! Eww…dad! I definitely don’t need to know that.” Peter said, already grossed out at the thought of hearing his father and Steve doing
“Okay you two. Knock it off. We didn’t come here to argue. We’re here because Peter asked us to help him out. Not for this. If you really do care about your son then please do try to get along, for Peter’s sake.” Damn the stupid wig and shade made him less chilling.
“I think this Spiderman isn’t a threat… I mean judging from his background you give us and from what I read from the newspapers….he seems to be less a danger to us. In fact I think he’s doing us a favor by stopping petty crimes.” Steve said, not looking up as both Nick fury and Tony stopped arguing and everyone eyed him. “Well, that might be true but what caught my attention isn’t that. What caught my attention is, about the whole incident with the lizard-creature that had occurred three months ago.” Nick Fury sternly pointed out.
Natasha glanced around the hallway. She noted the students were talking among each other before she spotted the principal in a deep conversation with a male student. The moment they were done, she made her way toward him. The headmaster of the school saw her making a beeline towards him.  “Yes? What can I do for you ma’am?” He asked. “Ah, yes. I’m Detectives Romanoff.” She said.  The man’s eyes squinted “What can I do for you, Detective?” He asked. “I’m here to ask about the incident three months ago? I actually work for the CSI-” Here, Natasha showed off her proficiently fake-designated badge, “-and they want me to investigate one of your students that was involved with the incident at Oscorp. If I’m not mistaken, she worked there as her part time job. And I think her name was--” She was interrupted by the man.
“The only person I have encountered was Hawkeye and you could say that I have mistaken him for a bad guy.” He said.
When Peter finally calmed down from his laugher, he replied, slowly explaining to Harry about the whole Intern things as both boys talked throughout the whole night.
Peter and Nova continued to have their own conversation while Brain and Bruce continued to explain their new plan. They put aside the plan for Spiderman for now.
his husband, hoping that Tony hadn’t lost his mind. Tony was doing just fine for these past few years. Well, not that fine. They were still having problems regarding their relationship - the distance between them lately - and trying to avoid the other was just getting out of hand. And Steve, dear poor Steve, was at his limit, worrying over Tony all those years ago and it still didn’t change even now.
(Relax, babe… I think we can still pull it off. The plan might work if we play it perfectly and carefully.) Tony said and then there were arguments, another short silence and another streak of arguments from both Starks. Bruce would have been worried if not for the fact that he’d known them longer to notice that this was just mere playful banter between the two lovebirds. As always. Bruce noticed Natasha coming out from the principal’s office. She made a gesture with her chin, pointing it to the exit.
He whispered in the boy’s ear. “Poor Peter Parker. No mother, no father, no one.” He then stabbed the boy in the hip.
The Starks had gone mad. They were acting as if they were his parents. It was rather annoying than touching.
Steve stayed for a while when he felt Tony moved on the bed and crouched towards him, arms wrapped around his waist. “Steve. I’m scared. What are we going to do when Peter starts to question about everything? If he wants to find out who he is?” Tony asked. His grip a little tight on his husband. “We’ll deal and handle it like when it comes to that. You know Peter has the right to know. Right now let’s just enjoy our time with Peter as his boss-” Tony glared at Steve’s sudden giggle “-and as his friend. Anything he wants us to be. Like Bruce said, we should try and make a happy memory with this Peter.” Steve said.
Peter went towards the elevator, bag on his shoulder with his Spiderman costume in it as he took off. He ran into a nearby alley and put on his costume before swung to where he met Nick Fury yesterday.
Peter thought. “That’s a relief.” He said. Soon, they went inside the elevator. Nick pressed the button to the conference room where he was sure the rest of the Avengers and young Avengers were waiting for them to arrive.
Tony often went to visit the nursery room that he and Steve designed years ago whenever he was bored or in need for a break from his lab or sometimes just feel like staying there. He felt as if the child was still around albeit knowing he wasn’t with them anymore. They hadn’t got rid of it or rather, they couldn’t. None of them wanted to forget their son that was stolen from them a few weeks later after he was born fourteen years ago. If Peter was with them right now, he’d have Tony’s hair and smart, maybe Steve’s puppy eyes and ,and, and-
PS: I would also like to say a big thank you for WookieCookie for beta-ing this story for me and this chapter as well. I'm really thankful for all your help girl. ^^
“Oh, okay.” Tony glanced at everyone. It was surprising most of them were present. Especially the steel-claws mutant who was there because he was dragged by none other than Beast.
That was how Steve, Tony and Clint found themselves when they came to visit; the sight of a broken Peter. Eventually Steve had to pry the boy away from his aunt as the nurses, and the same doctor surrounded the deceased woman, stating the time of her death.
Few days later, the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Hank Pym and Logan were having a meeting after Tony sent Peter away.
The next day in the morning the Avengers had another ‘Meeting’ with the rest of the members, but this time Ben of Fantastic Four and Henry McCoy, with Dr. Strange were there at Tony’s conference room. Tony was standing at the center, with a glass of wine in his hand, taking a small slip before putting it down at the table, looking up at everyone who in return were staring back at him with that weird stare of theirs.
“How about that one?” Bruce asked as they glanced at the door before they both nodded and opened the door, only to find another set of stairs.
Inside the boxer was another box, but with red-designated color squared box. He took it out and opened it, only to find that inside it was a baby hoodie blanket that was still neat and new. The blanket had a printed of Captain America design all over it.
“I’m sure everyone here knows Spiderman, correct?” he asked the rest of the Avengers only to receive a string of nods and murmurs whereas Tony snorted and said. “Who wouldn’t? The guy was like what? Everywhere! In the newspaper, in the news, Time magazines… So what the deal with this kid?” Tony asked.
Along the way, Tony and Steve were getting attached to the boy (something that wasn’t part of the plan at all), opening up and growing worry of the boy. Sometimes being protective of him whenever they saw bruises on the boy, a result from the bullies. In silence, Peter was the son Tony had ever dreamed to have. Thus why he couldn’t help it if the need to pummel whoever hurt Peter somehow overwhelmed him. It was vice versa for Peter. He imagined Bruce as his uncle (No one could ever replace Uncle Ben) and both Starks as his father figures.
And I also wanted to know on which Venom you guys wanted Peter to pair up with? Pick between Flash (Eugene Thompson) or Harry Osborn as Venom.
They still needed to pack a small number of things from Peter’s old home. Peter hadn’t left his room for the past few days. He only came out to fill his stomach.
“What?” Captain Britain asked. “I so hate you right now.” Logan said. “Huh? What did Cap Brit. Do now?” Johnny asked confusedly. Logan groaned
Well, finding out your son was a hero was a big no-no on his last but it was too late to regret that now.
“He does speak and act like you a bit. We have encountered Spiderman plenty of times and let’s just be honest, the kid has a badass attitude, and talkative. He babbles too much. In fact he’s kind of reminds me a lot like you, Tony.” Clint explained.
He spun around the city, heading towards the Avengers Tower when he saw Hawkeye. He landed in front of the man. “So what’s up, Hawkeye?” He asked. “Sorry about interrupting you during your school hours. But Iron Man and Cap need your help along with the young Avengers.”  Clint said. Peter raised a hand.
Oh! And one more thing? I would like to say many, many thank to WookieCookie for being my beta. :) I'm happy for all your hard work on editing this story and for being my Beta. :)
Steve stopped him with another simple, quick on his lips again and hushed him as he said. “Hey, Hey... None of that now, Tony. I’m sorry for avoiding you but you didn’t notice that you too were being the same to me too all those years ago ever since Peter was taken from us. I was worried that you were going to breakdown or something. But hey, I’m glad you’re not… And I’m… I’m just happy to see you back to normal. I was worried that our relationship would never go back to the way it was before like in the old days but I’m
The blood result came out positive, meaning this Peter Parker was indeed Tony and Steve’s stolen child. The two were shaken; trying to sink the horrifying fact their son had been used as a test subject to a sick, lack-of-humanity research by none other than Richard Parker himself. This was just too much for them to bear with.
Once the blond was sure enough his husband managed to collect himself, Steve released him lightly, letting out a small sigh, knowing the others were watching them closely, preparing to lend a hand should both of the Starks in need for it. Steve was grateful for it, he really did. Tony looked he did too.
The second serum he had injected on Peter, when he was two-year-old, was the second level, making the serum lasted a bit longer up to three years. The last serum Richard had injected him at that time lasted for about eight years.
Seriously, Peter thought, did he really look like a mess? The Starks were being so careful with him when they weren’t even like that before.
He groaned, shutting the alarm clock off, trying to remember why he had set the alarm clock early in the morning. He remembered the day; it was Monday. He had school in an hour.
Tony decided to look around and found a small security system and a small desk. He noticed the tapes in some of the drawer, grabbing one to read the label; ‘Progressions’ input’ and other with documentaries. Tony didn’t waste time to pack everything up. When they were done, Tony had ushered back. Their job was done here, time to head home. Soon they made it back to the tower and made a beeline to the lab, putting things they had discovered in one place.
Peter woke up to the sound of his alarm clock as he switched it off (smashing it, due to his new mutation power). He sat up, stretching his arms and giving a little yawn here and there, before leaping out of bed. Peter went to the bathroom to take a quick shower. When he was done he put on new attires before marching downstairs to the kitchen for breakfast; cereals, milk and sandwiches, before heading to school. He left note on the freezer for his aunty May to know he went out going to school already.
“Very well. I could give you a few lists of our honor students here that might interest you…” He said as he went to pick up a thick folder with student grade background. “Thank you. That would be great. Does the student have pictures of them so I may know who I’m looking or dealing with sir.” He said.
When they were done, silence filed the room. Bruce tapped his finger on the list board, throwing a glance at the boy before stating his decision. “I think you’ll do.” He said.
“You want the entire super-fucking-heroes to have this meeting just for one kid? A kid. I press and repeat, a kid.” Wolverine harshly took the offered drink from Steve. Ahh, liquor. He still felt annoyed and amused at the same time. All this shit just for a noisy kid Logan knew he could cut, cut chop, chop to pieces within seconds. He wouldn’t do that though. Despite popular belief, he had a heart and murdering kids wasn’t his thing.
“Rooftop?! What the heck is he doing there?!” Steve asked. “Actually, young sir has been there the moment you left his room this very morning. And he’s wearing nothing.” Jarvis informed him.
“You look…err…hot?” Richard bluntly blurted without thinking which made Steve, Tony and Bruce to stare at him weirdly before Tony grinned like a loon.
pull it off and back to reality soon, for Peter’s sake. He could only hope both Starks could try to pretend or be strong when they were around Peter. He could guess, heck he did know Peter Parker didn’t have a single grasp about this or whatever his step—or foster father’s scheme was in the past. Perhaps Peter’s aunt hadn’t anything to do with this too, wasn’t related to and kind or form with Richard Parker because if she did? Gods help her, Tony and Steve would make her life a living hell.  Old woman or not.
The principal nodded in understanding before he went to pick up a second file with photos of chosen students, handling it to Bruce. “Here they are. You can look them up and just come back later or anytime when you have picked one, and I might call them for you so you can interview them." He brushed the bridge of his nose.
“And you are her-?” The doctor asked as Steve answered. “His nephew, sir.” He said. “Oh…and how old are you?” The doctor asked a little concerned since Peter looked much too young than he had thought.
Peter swung from building to building. It was good that nothing happened and anyone in need for his help but still- ‘Aww…come on, man! Three weeks and still nothing.’ Getting frustrated, he spun another round as he performed his acrobatic movement in the air only to pause for seconds when his Spider’s sense was
He wouldn’t need to worry much. Still, going out fighting in ‘Spandex’ was definitely a no-no on his list.
“Okay what I want you three to do inside there is ask the front desk counter to lead you to where the Parker couple’s office was and when they had left there? Go and look for anything you can find that might give any information about their experiment and stuff. After that, come back here, and we can all look at the collected information back at the tower along with the rest of the group, okay?” Tony said with a grin.
He was scared. He was immobilised. He wanted to scream so he did but the voice that escaped his throat wasn’t of his own. It belonged to an infant. It confused the boy. No, this wasn’t him. This nightmare wasn’t his. He didn’t- this wasn’t his. Not his. Definitely not.
Bruce sighed before saying.  “Looks like nothing can’t be found here, Clint.” He said, placing the item back inside the box to bring it with them. Not once both men looked at the tag;
Nine months later, Tony gave birth to their child, but not without any complications. Their son, proudly named Peter Benjamin Rogers-Stark, was born small and came out pale-blue. The doctor had immediately sent the infant in the incubator room for future notice and checked if the infant surfer more than just breathing problem. Tony was devastated while Steve - who was outside waiting for the news and the arrival of their son - found out about the whole ordeal when the doctor had informed Steve regarding the issue of their son.
“You were stabbed by the Green Goblin with a poisoned knife. Your body was doing its wonders and got rid of the poison from your veins with an extra help from Reed Richard himself.” Bruce said.
Nick looked at the files of Spiderman for the last time before he made a call, requesting for Phil Coulson to come back to his office to talk and discus a few things about Spiderman, followed by a call for the Avengers for an important meeting.
Steve went outside, returning minutes later with a tray of two mugs of warm milk. He heaved and leaned his shoulder on the door, looking at Tony who was watching footage of his time with Peter. Steve was getting worried for his husband,
“Are you sure?” Steve asked just to be said. “It color green with a few pins and stickers.” He said. “That’s good.  What kind of stickers and pins were they so it would easier for us to track him down tomorrow morning.” He said. “It was uh…” Clint stopped. Tony snorted. “Oh now you forgot it?”
“They are using an infant as their experiment to test the serum on?” Richard couldn’t help but to feel sick at the deep part of his stomach.
It was raining when Peter took another spin from his night duty. He was still mad about the previous ordeal.
It was bit awesome for Peter. It meant he wouldn’t get sick ever. He had always wondered why he never got a fever when he was a kid, despite his weak features. He never complaint about his outer appearances, about why he was born small, short and thin. He was completely satisfied with the way he was.
“Y-You knew?” Steve asked.  There was no point in hiding it anymore now that they’d found out he was Spiderman. It was time they shared the truth. “A-Aunt May told me that I was adopted. Though, she didn’t know all of it. I found out about it in one of mom’s letters she left for aunt May to give it to me, but aunt May decided to give it to me before she died.” Peter explained. “I knew what Richard did to me too. I…I was going to…let you know. B-But I couldn’t…” He said.
Steve and Peter were done getting dressed. Tony watched Steve scowl at their son in the living room. The boy felt guilty. So Tony saved the boy from further trouble by telling them that they should have dinner together but Steve told Tony that Peter wasn’t off the hook yet. Tony just patted his son on the shoulder. Who whined in return for the whole night about him being grounded by Steve.
Luckily her injuries weren’t deep, but since she had a weak body and a fragile condition, it was only natural something like this would happen.
Richard hesitated before saying. “I feared that he might have somehow stolen the child from somewhere and raised it as their own? Or at least that’s how it looks like.” He said. “What are you talking about that they might steal a child from someone—” Tony declared, and then it was all clicked in his head in comprehension.
“I won’t mind so long as Peter would let me know if he has made his decision so that I can let his guardian know of this great offer.” The principal said. ‘
Steve watched Peter. No he wasn’t being creepy. He just loved the sight of his son eating his food as if it was the most heavenly thing he had ever tasted. “Did you like it, Peter?” Steve asked, blinking like an old-school housewife. “Um? Oh yeah! You’re a great cook, Mr. Steve. Thank you for the food as well. I haven’t had this great meal after aunt May left for her trip.” Peter shyly admitted.
Tony sighed. “I have instructed JAVRIS to record every move Parker does whenever he sets foot in this tower. It won’t be a problem.” Tony ordered JARVIS to play every record to them. A wide white screen blared to live in the middle of the room. Holographic transmission of Peter could be seen within the whole room.  Peter; doing projects with Tony, nodding at everything Bruce was telling him, enhancing some of Tony’s firewall systems (Tony didn’t know about this. He blinked at that), inventing his own implements and showing it to Tony, looking all happy and shy at Tony’s approval (Steve smiled. Tony’s gaze softened).
“Young sir is currently-”Jarvis paused for a bit, wondering how to explain this situation to the blond. “Well? Where is he?” Steve asked. “He is currently at the rooftop, sir.” Jarvis said. Steve blinked at that.
Hawkeye had his hand around the boy’s waist, trying to support him, since Peter was struggling to stand up due to the pain in his hip. The stab was a little deep, but not too deep to actually kill him. “Hey kiddo, are you okay?” Hawkeye asked. Peter’s vision started to blur. ‘
“Alright, who won the lottery?” He joked. “Very funny, Pete. But we didn’t tell you to come here for nothing.” Tony said as he grabbed and dragged his son towards one of the glass tubes.
Just as Tony promised, Phil did go to his school to pick up his bag, handing it to the boy with an annoyed look, obviously disliking the fact he was called to do mundane thing – but did it for Captain America’s sake.
“JARVIS scan that video and zoom it closer so I can see what they are taking.” Tony ordered in a low derision voice. It felt like he already knew the answer but still needed confirmation.
Peter was panicking. He needed to be there for his aunt May. He didn’t know what to do and the only thing clouded his head was the thought of Tony’s offer about providing his every need or emergency should he was in need for it. Peter didn’t have to think twice as he went towards the tower, taking the train on the way there.
Steve batted his eyes. His son was eating junk food the whole time? Preposterous! His son needed to be in a perfect shape and health.
His head snapped as he turned to look behind him and saw a person with an arrow gripped tightly in his hold. The archer pulled the quiver and discharged the arrow, aiming perfectly at him again. Peter blinked underneath his mask before leaping backward, avoiding of getting hit by the piercing arrow. “Damn! The guy’s good!” Clint blinked as he began to chase Spiderman.
The morning came and the sun woke Steve up as always. He lied still and watched Tony slowly waking up “What time is?”
Tony was still resting on the couch, the TV on. But he was searching for a series in Netflix, not ‘real TV’, as they had called it, allowed. And Steve was making something for breakfast, nothing fancy, Clint didn’t have the ingredients for it, just French toast.
He got out of bed and into the shower, the water not washing away any of his worries, how was Tony? And, most important, how was Pepper? Had they found out the news (they were the news) or was the paradise they had gone to so remote they had escaped for now?
He went into the bed. And it all fell over him. Just. Everything. The whole day. Weighting like the moon had landed in his chest. He couldn’t breathe.
“They are doing what?” Steve didn’t answer. “Look, Steve, I’m very sorry. I…”. His tone changed drastically “You kissed me too!”
“It’s okay” Steve smiled, and doubled his efforts, caressing his balls, pressing his tongue against his slit, going as deep as he could.
But no one had even though of going to live separated again. Not after almost having to do it for an entire year.
“You were going to say the money?” Tony laughed and Steve went red. “It’ll be a good change living in Brooklyn, I’m tired of living in mansions.”
“What?” Tony looked as surprised as Steve. And a little angry. “Why didn’t you tell me you were toge… Ooh, it’s a thing of the moment, yes?” he winked.
“’Slut’. That’s the sweetest thing they are calling me. They think I took you to that park and tried to ‘steal you from Virginia Pots’.”
Pepper stayed. “So, I have another thing to tell you, Tony” Tony braced himself, Pepper saw it “Okay, we have to give a press conference, about… us. About the three of us. But I think is better if Steve doesn’t come.”
Steve laughed again, it just kept undoing Tony every single time, if Steve had said ‘jump’ at that time, Tony wouldn’t have time to stand up before jumping as high as humanly possible. Maybe even inhuman.
“We don’t want that now, do we?” Steve said smirking, and Tony took fistfuls of the sheets as Steve pushed inside him. It felt so good, it was even better that how he remembered it, and it was Steve inside of him.
“I know; I know” whispered in a reassuring tone Natasha. ‘Just as much as you couldn’t invite your wife’ she though.
“Of course no, no one ever is. But I’m tired of living without you” Steve smiled, he went back up just to kiss Tony. “God Bless, I though you’ll never do that, thinking you were still frozen after all.”
And they cried. They cried all the tears they had tried to keep inside. Tony tried to bite his lip to stop it for happening and Steve smiled and looked away, just till he saw Tony’s whole body shaking and gave in too.
His ears full of the sounds Steve was doing around his cock while he pumped it too, caressing his tight at times, going too deep for his own throat at others. He licked, nipped and sucked.
While eating breakfast Tony realized once again how fucked he was. But he couldn’t keep his eyes out of Steve, it was like seeing the moon for the first time. He was so scared of closing his eyes and losing him.
The next morning, they could see why Clint haven’t changed his sofa. It was small yes, and they had slept all over each other, Tony could swear he slept on the floor for part of the night, Steve kept telling him that it didn’t happen. But, still, they woke up as if they had sleep in king size beds. Tony’s neck and Steve shoulder were hurting a little, but nothing compared to what it should be like after two adults tried to sleep together in a three places sofa.
When he stepped out of the shower he noticed something different. “Natasha?” No one answered, but he knew someone was in his house. He didn’t have time for that.
Clint let the pizza in the kitchen with everything else he had brought and, in a single movement, unfolded his bow.
Was that the first time Tony had say ‘honey’ to Steve? A part of Pepper hoped it was, another part didn’t care anymore.
“That’s not half of it, Steve, and you know it.” Tony wasn’t calm anymore, he wasn’t shouting like Steve was either, but bit by bit, he was getting there.
Steve let a try of kisses all over Tony’s torso, admiring the hard build that he rarely was cocky about. Getting rid of Tony’s pans and underwear at the same time Tony’s cock jutted up from his trimmed groin. And, oh God, he hadn’t thought about it but of course Tony trimmed. He released a moan, the saliva almost building up in his mouth at the sole thought of testing Tony, of having him in his mouth and making him come like he had thought of doing too many times.
“You can’t just say all of it and then go to your bedroom. Or Kate’s bedroom or whatever.” He got up.
“I don’t know. Reflexes, I think” Natasha shrugged and smiled a little, Steve did to. “Are you okay?”
Tony opened his mouth, then closed it, biting his already swallowed lips that were all but begging to be kissed again, to be ravished. And Steve was so happy to obligate. He kissed him as hard as he was fucking him, each thrust harder than the last. Their skin glistened with sweat. Tony took one hand off of the sheets and Steve took it, lacing their fingers.
“I don’t want to” he caught Steve by the arm, the jacket not giving and some stitches breaking. Steve went back up. A photo was taken.
Steve was sitting in the sofa tipping in his phone. He had received a message from Tony “We fucked up”, Steve thought about what to answer, finally he had sent: “We? I’m not married.”  Moments later Tony answered: “Well, I’m not going to be married for much longer”.
all of them, they were the only movies they had found in Clint’s apartment. Tony wasn’t disappointed. And Steve haven’t seen them. They were just the right kind of films to watch that night.
“Don’t. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I have to go now, what’s left of the Company needs running, even if it all is going to be closed by next Saturday.”
Tony moved to the side table, opening a drawer and taking a box out of it. “So, would you come see the apartment with me, Steve?”
Steve went back up, pressing against him, Tony caressed his bottom lip with his thumb and then kissed him, testing himself in Steve’s mouth and regaining slowly the ability to talk “That was… amazing” he said, kissing him again, slowly turning him so Steve was the one resting against the wall.
“I have had enough, Tony.” Tony didn’t respond. “I don’t like parties, that’s all, I just want to get to my house and sleep like the old man I am. Are you happy? That’s the truth.”
“Steve… I” his own words sounded like another mouth was saying them. To slow, another octave completely, and he wouldn’t recall even saying them “I’m not going to last”
He woke up way pass dinner time, he could hear Steve sleeping, and he thought that maybe Steve had fallen asleep without dinner (what was better than thinking Steve ate right there without even telling him ‘Hi’), so he stood up and went to the kitchen, nothing looked like it had been used, and it was an open kitchen, so he would have, at least, smelled Steve cooking.
“No shit, Sherlock” she murmured. And knocked again at the door. Tony opened it, his eyes all watery because of the fever and looking like a beaten puppy, but he was still shielding Steve behind him, as if he was the strongest one and not the other way around. Pepper remembered why she had fell in love with him “Hi, Tony”. She looked pass him, Steve was trying to stay still and look the less ill possible, he was trying to smile, but Pepper could see he was hurting all over. “Hi, Steve” Steve said hi in return and then coughed. “We are coming in” she said, and Tony let them.
Steve did, slowly feeling Tony’s neck, kissing it just after, and turning him around to see how it looked. Steve’s eyes watered, he kissed Tony’s Adam’s apple.
“Yeah” Tony looked at the bad guys, one in front of him, the other just below him “You two, what do you want.”
“Ha, ha” he mocked, lying next to Tony, who moved to rest at his side to look at Steve “how could be frozen under your oh, so sweet, sweet talk” he said, sarcastic.
“You keep saying that, but still” Tony stepped closer to him, making their bodies press against each other. Steve coughed. “As much as I want…”
He lifted Tony’s hips, fixing a pillow under him, and spread his knees, making Tony moan out of anticipation and the loss of his legs around Steve. He forced his body to relax as Steve put his legs on his shoulders. Pouring lube all over himself and spreading Tony cheeks, he started to circle him, every second the most delicious torture. He kept preparing Tony for what felt like hours. “Steve if you don’t start pounding me I’m going to lost my mind.”
“You can” Steve said, and moved them towards the nearest wall. And Tony let him. Oh, he wouldn’t stop him if his life depended on it. “You want?”
Steve closed the door and threw a newspaper at him. That was the second flying to his face in the same day, a new record. “Why won’t people stop doing this” he whispered.
“No shit” the big said. “If we knew you two here, we come four or five. Not fair fight two versus you.”
Tony’s hands were in his shoulders, but not for long, as slowly as he could he made his way down Steve’s torso, and up again, cupping his head just as Steve was doing. He brought their lips together once more, and before kissing him he said: “Just one last time.”
They sat at the sofa, it wasn’t a fancy one, not bigger enough for the two of them to lie. A blanket over their shoulders, and Steve had found a bag of popcorn, so they put that to good use too, they were ready for the marathon.
He remembered when he told Natasha “I think I’m in love”, Natasha have laughed and answered “I think everyone knows you’re in love, except for Tony of course”, Steve had gotten so red he thought he was going to explode “How do you know is Tony?” Natasha shrugged.
“So we are going. Bye Tony, congratulations again.” Stave started walking before Tony could say anything. Natasha was following him. When he went through the front door he smiled, sighting relieved, Natasha next to him, laughing. It was raining like ever.
It’s all he heard, but they weren’t talking to him, he heard an electric saw and moved away. Ran to the kitchen and caught the first knife he saw, it wasn’t impressive at all, just a table knife, but he knew how to use it.
“Oh, you will love it alright” Tony said rounding Steve with his legs and thrusting against him, “but first things first” he said, Steve almost falling against him.
“And let me tell you one or two extra things. As I have already said, I don’t always have the right answer. But neither of these two people deserve a punishment or having to make a lie out of their lives for my errors. The company it’s very important to Pepper, you know?” he said, as if he was talking to a couple of friends, “And she’s doing a wonderful job out of it, that’s the reason I’m making her the boss of it all, and I know she’ll keep carrying on with all the charity campaigns we are working on right now, for that reason I ask you to make me the center of your complains and not the company nor Pepper” he got up, and took Steve’s hand to help him get in the pallet where the table was. “Another thing, if anyone else calls Steve Rogers, something even similar to a ‘Slut’ or Virginia Pots a ‘Bitch’, you’re going to tell those words to Iron Man’s face, and someone once called me Earth’s Greatest Avenger, I’m only warning you.” He made a pause. No hands up. “Thank you.” He kissed Steve, right in front of everyone. “I’m not going to be answering anymore questions, Pepper?” Pepper smiled and waved them goodbye. She knew that could happen, and she had prepared accordingly.
“Yes” That word made his ears buzz. He smiled. Everyone was smiling. The preacher kept talking like he was supposed to do. He kept smiling, like he was supposed to do.
Two guys, one really big and the other slim as they come burst the door open and went into the apartment as if they were ready to fight and die. That Tony could do.
“But” Tony continued as if Steve’s presence hadn’t altered him, and it had, but his discourse didn’t change because of it. “But, as my nanny should say “You can’t choose who you love, cariño” and I love Pepper Pots, but amo a Steve Rogers”, and he hadn’t finished saying it when three of the Hispanic journalist at the room started cheering.
He prayed to find Clint’s lube (he had to have something) or he would find another way to prepare Tony.
They sat at the same chairs they had used for tying the attackers. Steve inspired till his chest was full and then started talking, not a discourse, just a simple phrase “I’ll do it” Tony looked at him as if he had just walked in the conversation, “what Pepper said, she was right. I can’t be that egoist.”
“Follow me.” Tony started walking down the street “Please”, he added turning back. Steve sighted, and followed him.
“Steve?” Tony said getting up in his forearms himself “are you-?” he didn’t had time to say anything else, him getting up had been an offense to Steve, and he was ready to fix that. One leg at each side of Tony’s body, he lowered himself, pining Tony’s arms with one hand over his head, and started nipping at his neck. “Fuck” Tony whimpered and Steve felt as if his body might combust at any moment.
“Me too.” Tony said, upping himself in his forearms, just enough to kiss Steve, he took Steve by the nape and brought him down with himself.
Oh, they knew Tony also loved Steve. How he cherished every good moment with him, how he always remembered the little puns that had made Steve laugh with him. He was going to ask Steve out once, Rhodey knew.
“What kind of- “Tony stopped himself, because it was taking too long with the sarcasm, and Steve was offering a blowjob to him. It was really happening. In Clint’s living room yes, but... He was taking too long to answer. Steve was starting to look less ready and more dubious. “Yes, yes, yes, of course.”
Steve didn’t let go “I hate you so much.” He said kissing Tony back, this time both responding to it. Steve let go of Tony arm.
“Rhodey is far away. I think he doesn’t know yet” I hope, Tony thought. “So, where do you live when you aren’t in the farm? Your family adores me Clint, don’t worry”
He didn’t feel the same way for Steve and Pepper, that much was true. But that wasn’t bad. It wasn’t like he loved Pepper any less. It was just different. Different in a good way. Yes, he still felt something for Steve, but so did a lot of people for a whole lot of other people, and they still marry and have children. And all of that. Why wouldn’t him? Steve had had time to say something about the wedding if he’d wanted to.
“Okay. Do you think Clint has any movies around here?” he said already moving his head looking for them in the room.
“Till next time” Tony said.  And it happened so quickly Tony was laughing at the top of his lungs. Steve upped him, Tony’s legs around his waist, and it was an easy (except for the doors) way to the bedroom, where Steve all but throw Tony to the bed. “A little eager, aren’t you?”
He stopped smiling. Almost crying he fastened his seatbelt, it didn’t work, he just couldn't make it click, it was too much for him, he felt his eyes watering and his heart beating faster and faster. Natasha hugged him. “Thanks”, he said “I’m sorry, I’m being an awful companion”.
Pepper had her head low, but she was smiling width, just as she had expected, Tony was still as predictable as always, she would have loved to be with him a little longer, but that totally planned spontaneous part of him would have drove her crazy sooner or later, she liked to thing that.
“Tony’s doctor” she didn’t get an answer. Tony and Steve were talking between them, and she was getting angrier by the second, her patience had a limit, and she was well over it.  “Open the damn door!” she yelled.
“Pepper?” She turned. Her eyes closed as strongly as her fists. She moved her foot, trying to break another hole in the tablet and cutting herself on the process.
“I have my demons” Tony answered with a thin line of voice. He was melting against that wall. The whole word already forgotten. It was just him and Steve, finally.
“That’s what they are calling you today. I’m sorry, again. That’s why I have brought everything for a good stay at home day. So you don’t have to face reality today.” Clint moved his head, readjusting the aid in his ear. “There is someone climbing the wall?”
“Goodbye, Pepper” they didn’t even shake hands. Tony closed the door and sat at the couch, he knew Steve was angry and he e didn’t want to fight, so he was ready to pass the afternoon in that sofa, he would talk to him at dinner time, when both had had time to think and the medicine had kicked in. At least he hoped so.
“Anyway, after he was born he was taken away from us. We tried looking for him, looking for the people who had stolen him from us. We even had our friends to help us out but years passed and we couldn’t find him. Steve and I couldn’t get over it. And we never could get rid of this room. We couldn’t. Didn’t want to forget about him. Most of the time, we had hoped that one day that our son would return to us safe and sound with open arms and all.” Tony finally decided to just tell Peter the truth.
PPS: I would also like to thank you to WookieCookie for being my beta, even though that she took her time editing this chapter while still having a mid fever, I still would want to thanks her for all the help she did.
Could it be said that Bruce Banner was working with the guy who attacked him days ago? If it was true, why would they go this far just for one man? Would he play in their twisted game? Should he put himself in harm just for this? Peter inhaled slowly. He could play along, see where this would go. Besides, he was Spider-man. It wouldn’t kill anyone if he joined, right? Right.
The doctor blinked. “Not good. I don’t think she will survive. Her injuries aren’t serious, but the trauma and pain she’s endured has led her into her current state. She has a fragile body. There is a chance that she could survive this or likely….not. We won’t know. It’s up to her now.” The doctor explained grimly.
“Tony, we’re not even sure if this Peter Parker is our lost child. Do you think Peter’s parents would do such a thing to us? Don’t you remember Peter once told us that his aunty was a lovely family he has left? She told him his parents loved him dearly even though they’re not alive anymore. And judging by how he sounded when he explains it to us, I doubted Mr. and Mrs. Parker would do anything immoral.” Steve supplied.
“Yes Richard and I went to the same academy together before we went on our separate way. The last time I saw him when he was married to his wife Mary Parker. But I didn’t know he had a kid, much less a son.” Richard Reed was now interested about this. He knew his former college friend had died years ago. He was there at their funeral, and was able to meet Ben and May but there wasn’t any sign of Peter there. “I was at their funeral and was able to meet with your aunt. They never mentioned about the couple having a son before.” Richard said, looking suspicious. “Oh?...” Peter said in a small voice before stuttering.
Peter read Richard Parker's journal and found out that Tony Stark was actually his biological mother who given birth to him. Then he was called for help from his fellow Avengers as he aid them, fighting against robot and Green Goblin? How will Peter handle things from there when he himself got injure from Green Goblin stab?
“I think whatever it is you decide it doesn’t matter. You’re smart enough and that is more than enough for you to take the internship Mr. Stark would like to offer.” Bruce explained. “So what else do you want to know about?” Peter asked. “Family’s background… if it’s, okay?”
“…so that’s our guy?” Tony asked as they watched Peter heading towards the school. “Yup.” Clint said. “Might as well ask students later between or after school?” Steve probed. “Good idea, cap.” Natasha got out of the car as everyone turned to stare at her. “What are you doing Tasha?” Tony’s brows contorted.
(He can invent things? Damn! This kid is a big deal! I want him as my scholarship! As my student! Dude--) Tony voice could be heard from their communication. “That’s astounding.” Bruce said proudly with a smile. ‘If our Peter was alive and this smart, I would be proud of him.’ Bruce thought. “Thanks.” Peter sheepishly said. “It also listed here that you often become the victim of bullying?”
Peter jumped into the elevator and went into some alley to put on his Spiderman costume before he spun off somewhere to cool his head a bit.
In the boy’s defense, it wasn’t that he was being ungrateful. He was still mourning and everything the Starks had done for him didn’t go unnoticed by him. He truly appreciated it but he couldn’t deal with any of it yet. He needed time.
“Idiot! We could never be disappointed or disown you as our son, Peter! I’m proud to have you as my son. But...” Tony stopped dramatically for a second.
Though secretly, it was the other way around for Peter as he felt indebted to the man and this looked like something he couldn’t ever repay back.
“We could still do the plan B after we done doing whatever plan C is supposed to be if that’s okay with everyone?” Henry McCoy suggested.
“No, it’s just as far as I know Richard Parker and his wife had been trying to conceive a child for a long time now. Mary couldn’t have a child. She was barren. I know this because Mary was one of Susan’s friends and she kind of confided to her about this. Like I said, it’s odd this Peter was their kid. Not just that, the boy didn’t uphold his parents’ outer appearances. As far as I know, both Richard and Mary’s side of the family are mostly blondes with blue eyes.” Reed said.
) Tony said, which made Steve’s eyebrow twitch in annoyance, but before the couple could begin their lover spat, Bruce interjected them off with a groan and pleaded,
“But pops! I was bored!” He retorted. “So staying upstairs the whole day wearing nothing is your way to spend time?!” Steve asked. He certainly didn’t expect this.
?” Peter looked somewhat curious. Clint just snorted, glaring at Tony who flashed him a wide beam. Steve groaned.
“It’s kind of creepy how this kid almost looks a lot like you too, Tony. Especially those eyes and—“Johnny spluttered impishly only to be cut off by Henry‘s ‘Shut the fuck up before I feed you my expired strawberry jam’ glare. The human torch was tip-toeing the line by almost bringing up the memory of Tony and Steve’s lost son.
“The third one is almost like Iron Man suit. Plus, here.” Tony handed what looked like a thick watch to Peter.
Just then, the front door hovered open softly as both his parents, Steve and Tony, went inside. Peter paled. They looked solemn.
But after Richard Parker’s death, the serum had less effect on Peter’s system. If it wasn’t for the Radioactive Spider’s bite, Peter would probably be dead by now.
Tony waves his hand at him and said. “It’s okay, I get it. And yeah, I’ll sign this for you.” He cooed as he pulled out a pen and signed the paper before handed it back to Peter. Tony didn’t miss the sparkly lit in Peter’s eyes as Peter grinned at him and said. “Thank you, Mr. Stark! I owe you for doing this for me. I wanted my aunt to sign this in the first place for me but since she’s out of town, I couldn’t possibly ask it from her.” He said, now beaming. Tony couldn’t help but to feel something inside him explode with glee and warm. Darn it, he really did care about this boy.
he discerned, going onward and was about to tackle Spiderman from behind him when Spiderman saw this and moved away, making Hawkeye hit the wall where Spiderman’s bag was dropped. He snapped and thought of an idea when he noticed he was beside Spiderman’s bag and quickly placed the tracker inside the kid’s bag before getting back on pretending to attack Spiderman who continued to escape his multiple offensives.
won’t happen and that you want our relationship back but more importantly, I want our son back as well.” Steve said as he kissed Tony again.
“I…I didn’t know the Avengers are working with SHIELD. I thought Iron Man hates working for the government?” He asked confusedly.
“I don’t know? You came up with the idea in the first place.” Clint said as he and Tony began to argue again. “Don’t you think is kind of weir that Spiderman stopped here at Midtown Science high school?” Bruce asked.
It was so unfair that both his dads were allowed to go on missions while he couldn’t. He had already cleaned his room yesterday, did his homework, and read books. He even finished watching all his favorite anime in three days and played video games.
Peter just looked at Tony then at Steve before sighing and slumped back down on his bed. “Fine. But what about school?” He asked.
Peter, for his part, felt loved. So his dad did really want him as his son, but did he think of him when he went missing those years ago?
Spiderman remarked the way Hawkeye was about to assault him. He ducked Hawkeye’s firm attack and stirred sideways.
PS: If anyone could guess about where I get the idea of the yellow Spider suit that Peter's received from Tony?
“So… I was adopted? But w-what about my real parents? D-Do they know how my real parents look like? Why-why did my biological parents thr-throw me away? Why wouldn’t they want m-me? O-or did mom and dad adopt me from an orphanage?” His throat felt dry. So dry.
After finding out that Peter Parker might be their long lost son? Tony began making new mission plan for the Avengers.
Peter ducked his head, but didn’t mind the affection Steve was giving him. In fact, he liked it. He had always wanted to have a dad since Richard Parker wasn’t around. Okay so maybe he didn’t think of Richard Parker as his dad. He still couldn’t forgive what Richard Parker had done to his life, so he was out of the question as Peter’s father figure-like.
“Uh…um…w-would it be all right i-if I called…you uh…pops? C-Cause I think it’s…kind of cool to call you that?” He said. Steve couldn’t help but to give a genuine smile and chuckle at that as he ruffled the boy’s hair.
Now that caught Peter. “HAWKEYE?! Wait! As in one of the AVENGERS?” He asked, slightly stunned. His anger had finally subsided away by the news.
Unknown to the couple who was busy lip-locking, Logan scurried out from the room to summon Captain American and Iron Man, only to regret it when he saw the leaders of their Avengers were smooching-like-shitty-opera-couple out in the hallway. He shut the door real loud, marching off elsewhere. Face red in anger and displeased.
“About what happened just an hour ago…? You totally went wild. Want to tell me what’s going on?” Steve cooed gently.
The video tape was recorded regarding the couple’s experiment. Mostly just Mr. Parker’s experiment along with his fellow co-workers.
“No kidding?! Who signed your approve signature? I’m sure it couldn’t be your Aunty May since I know I was there when she went out to that flower camp!” Harry asked.
“I.. Well…my school is having a field trip next weekend and…I kind of forget to tell you. I know I have my Aunt to do that but she’s out of town for a few couple of days. I don’t have anyone to sign this for me…The teacher want us to at least have our parents or any guardians to sign this paper to allow us to go. And I really, really want to go it’s just that…well…” Peter said nervously.
“Are you behind this?” Spiderman demanded. Green Goblin just chuckled and said. “Why? Don’t like my little gift for ya, Spiderman? I’m sure you are starting to get bored just doing nothing but petty crime now aren’t you?” He irked. “Shut up! Where did you even get this thing? Or are you working with someone else?” He asked.
Peter thought of it for a moment before nodding. “Yeah. I would really appreciate that. I want to go see Aunt May. I n-need to make sure she’s safe and-and all right.” Tony’s lips puckered downward. Peter’s voice smothered with love for his
Steve wasn’t stupid. He had heard what Richard mentioned about Parker’s parents. “But we don’t know that. We don’t know if that’s true,
In the middle of the night, Clint, Logan, Francis and Brain came back with the information. They came with a name: Ronald Withhold, one of Mr. Parker fellow co-workers. He solidified his belief that he knew nothing of this but revealed Dr. Conner Kurt was also involved in it as well.
He might be able to forgive his mother and understand her reason. But not Richard Parker. He could never forgive this betrayal, this hurt and all it happened because of one experiment. Did he ever worth anything to him than just a test subject?
“Ah, what can I do for you Mr. Banner?” He said as both Natasha and Bruce looked up at him. Bruce snapped and remembered what he aimed to do and said. “I’m here to ask if I can interview some of your honor students for an invitation of intern scholarship, sir.” he hurriedly added. “I was actually told by Mr. Tony Stark to find him a brilliant student to work in his company.” He explained. “I thought that Mr. Stark wasn’t interested in those?” The principal asked.
Clint who was near the printer picked up the paper and handed it to Tony who was looking it up then went towards Francis, handing him the now printed tag number.
“Ah? Okay, yeah sure let’s go.” Peter gave up as he entered the car. The team was following the car from behind.
“Fine, fine. But will Steve be joining us?” Bruce asked worriedly. Everyone already knew Steve was Tony Stark’s husband since the couple made-public their relationship before their little Peter was even born.

Tony placed the wig on Steve’s head and adjusted it, quickly putting on the sunglass as well on Steve before examining Steve’s new appearance. “There! Now no one will recognize you as Steve Rogers-Stark with this disguise!” he said triumphantly. Richard and Bruce looked at Steve, nodding dimly. It was a good thing Tony didn’t put his husband on anything that could turn all attention to him. Vivid outfit and anything obvious would shift public stares on them the moment they entered the building.
Tony gave Peter a smile and a tender, slow brush to his head. Peter gawked at the man. That gesture was why too affectionate for Tony Stark.
“Okay… Can I ask one more thing? It is said here in your statement that you and Mr. P…Peter Parker has been seen hanging out lately and some of your friends said that I should ask you if he was involved. They said you only interact with this kid.” She said.
The next morning, Tony was on the phone, talking with Peter’s headmaster and informing him that Peter would be away for a while. Once he was done, Tony made another call, waiting for Happy to pick it up.
Tony took Bruce’s seat while Steve walked the other way around to sit on his son’s bed. Peter looked drained. He threw his tired gaze at his hands, not having eye contact with his parents. He was too scared to see their disappointed look. Steve frowned at how Peter was looking afraid of something. But afraid of what?
“Actually, I haven’t yet…” He admitted. It was soundless on the other side. It was Tony who broke the odd silence and said. “What do you mean you haven’t placed it yet on the guy?” He asked. “He avoids every projectile!  I have no idea how he knows and manages to evade my every attack. It’s like he’s eyes on the back of his head or something. I’m chasing him right now to try it again.” He explained. “Haa! Someone finally beat up Clint? Dude! This is something to--” Before Tony could finish his sentence he was cut off by Steve’s authoritative voice.
Steve was searching thoroughly everything when his eyes set on a family photo of three; a female on a chair, a man standing behind her whilst his arms were around the woman’s shoulders and a child nestling safely on the woman’s laps.
Clint looked at the hat Tony handed him. “You’re kidding me, right?” Clint wailed. Tony ignored him, going towards Steve to give his husband a kiss to the temple. “Dude! I’m so totally not wearing a ‘Dora the explorer’ hat with a weird looking shade. I mean- come on! Look at this!” Clint whined.
“Uh…” Harry said. It was quiet all of a sudden and then Harry could hear Peter laugh. “Ha ha, very funny, Peter.” Harry said in his I’m- not-so-amused voice as he added, “But seriously. How did you even manage to get Mr. Tony Stark to sign that paper? Or are you just joking with me? Cause I find it so not funny, Peter.” Harry warned.
“Uh, Professor, m-may I be excused? I don’t feel good, sir.” He lied. The teacher eyed him for a while before nodding his head. “T-Thank you sir.”
It was Peter turn to be confused when he was called to the principal office as he followed Ms Tina towards the office. When he was in, he saw not only their principal but someone else. On the chair sat a man, wearing a purple sleeve shirt, brown pants and office shoes. “Ah. Parker. Have a sit.” His principal declared. He blinked his eyes before sitting down. “You called for me sir?” Peter asked.
“I see...well then you and your group should head downstairs. Tony and the others are already there, reading the files and solving it. I’m just going to stay here and wait for the girls since they are the only one left that haven’t returned yet.” Steve informed Clint as Clint nodded his head and trudged from the room.
Peter was furious. Who the heck this guy thought he was. He was about to tell Nick his final answer when a young voice joined in.
The kid glanced behind him when Clint was finally gone. He sighed in relief, taking another spin from the building before landing on some empty street to take a break. It was then his sense was stinging him, alerting him that he wasn’t alone in this empty area.
