Steve’s face heats up and he hides it in the crook of Tony’s neck. Just like with Peter, the familiar scent comforts him. Tony holds him close, enjoying the bit of time they get before the rest of the house wakes up.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “No. No I won’t lock you up. I won’t put you there. Steve, there’s other ways.”
Tony tips his head back, his falling shut and breaths labored. Steve whines softly and curls up with him, laying his head down on his chest and listening to the soft beating of his heart.
“I don’t know if I can make you understand,” Steve says, his voice quiet and soft. He forces himself to meet Tony’s eyes, showing off the tears that have formed in his own.
Peter makes sure it’s just the two of them before lifting up both his hoodie and shirt, exposing the small bump beginning to form. Ned’s eyes widen and he gasps.
Steve sniffs and peers up when he hears Tony enter the room, his eyes shiny with tears. “You came back?”
Tony is currently lying on the exam bed in the middle of the room, one arm folded and resting behind his head. He keeps his gaze up, focusing on the ceiling above him and taking slow, careful breaths. He places one hand over his belly, fighting back the urge to vomit. There should be no reason for him to be on the verge of vomiting again when he had spent a good portion of his morning beside the toilet.
Peter shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to. He left it this way and I don’t want to mess it up.”
Tony rises to his feet. Before he can even leave the room, Steve is calling out to him and he turns back around.
“Holy shit,” he gasps in surprise and Steve peers up at him, worry and fear flooding his eyes. Tony’s seen this same look before, 17 years ago. “You’re pregnant?”
“I’m okay,” Steve assures softly and he reaches out to touch Peter again, this time to brush away the messy strands of hair from his face. “Were you a good boy?”
“Yeah.” Tony lets out a sigh and rests his head back against the wall. He squeezes his eyes when tears threaten to fall. He doesn’t want to cry, especially not in front of the kid. Peter didn’t need to see him so broken.
“Haven’t had this in a while,” Steve admits and he takes a bite, moaning a little from the delicious flavor bursting across his taste buds.
The woman hasn’t noticed him yet, she’s too busy typing away on her phone. It’s not until she glances up do their eyes meet and she too releases an audible gasp.
Bucky rips his hand away so that he and Natasha can lift Steve, but the Captain cries out and they’re forced to set him back down. There’s a pool of red around him now, the air filling with a mix of smoke and the strong stench of blood.
There’s no pictures of the funeral service, but the news footage shows the heartbroken citizens mourning the loss. A few of them are holding gifts and lit candles to place for a memorial.
By some miracle Morgan doesn’t wake up exactly two hours later. The sun is just starting to rise when her small whimpers come through the monitor. Steve is up first, already out of bed and shuffling out of the bedroom to get to their daughter before her cries rise in volume. There was no point in going back to sleep after that, and Tony gets up, letting out a yawn and stretching before he follows his husband.
It’s not until he lowers himself in the rocking chair and puts a bottle to her lips does she quiet down. Tony breathes a sigh of relief and glances down at her, watching quietly as she nurses greedily from her bottle. Tony rocks back and forth in the chair, hoping the soothing motion and her warm bottle will help coax her to sleep.
Tony blows out a breath. “What do I do? I can’t do this, Pep. I don’t know how to be a father. I can’t be…I’m not Steve.”
“Please!” Steve turns to begging, though he knows it won’t do any good. “Please, Alpha don’t! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”
In the trees above them birds are chirping, their songs a little too happy for Tony’s taste. Being here didn’t bring him happiness. How could a place like this, full of death and sorrow, bring anyone joy?
“I have by the way. Oh and tell Pete to stop dangling from the ceiling to scare Harley. He doesn’t listen to me.”
“Hey, how did you get in?” Tony questions, even though he knows he won’t get an answer. Dodger barks, and that’s when he realizes the sound is different. “Hey, buddy what’s wrong?”
Ned’s eyes widen in shock. “Really? Peter, maybe you should just tell your parents and they help you.”
He recognizes the signs almost immediately. He woke up that morning with the urge to be near Steve and hold him close. His mornings usually involved waking up to the omega beside him and curled up in his arms, but there had never been the need to mate with Steve. It was a huge step for them and they’ve only talked briefly about the idea. They were taking it slow.
Tony kisses each of his pups goodnight and adjusts any blankets that have slipped off them. He shuts the door halfway. He peers up when he hears soft footsteps and finds Steve coming down the hall with a sleeping Peter in his arms.
“Fuck. Touch me,” Tony begs, bucking his hips up to rub them against Steve’s growing bulge. Steve groans in response, his clock reacting to the friction. Tony cries out when Steve grants his wish and touches him. It’s not enough. He needs more. “Come on, Cap. Touch me.”
“And he’s not getting you or the baby. I won’t let him. I said I’d do whatever I had to to keep you safe, and I will. You’re safe here, Steve. He can’t hurt you anymore.”
“I know.” Tony soothingly runs a hand along Steve’s back. “You’re doing so good, honey. Just breathe through it.”
That’s as far as they go. Tony is careful when he touches Steve, making sure his mate is comfortable enough for his hands to be on him.
Tony smiles at her and beckons her closer, pulling her into his lap. “It’s a very big surprise for mommy. We can’t tell him okay?”
Morgan scoffs. “They don’t show it. I just wanted to work on my stupid science project. It’s something I know dad would like and he’s too busy for me. I know they have a lot to deal with but so do I! I can’t even talk about my days like Peter gets to.”
“Don’t have a choice,” Steve says through gritted teeth. His eyes squeeze shut and he groans loudly. There’s a building pressure deep in his pelvis, and when the next contraction hits, the pressure is relieved and wetness forms between his legs. “Shit! My water just broke.”
“Ignore this. Bucky and I were...figuring things out.” Sam immediately begins picking up around the room. Peter’s brow raises when he notices a small pile of baby items. He recognizes a few of his old baby stuff mixed in.
Peter stares up and screams at the darkened sky. The rain falls on his face, but he doesn’t care. He screams until his throat burns, until his lungs beg for air.
It shouldn’t take Tony long to respond. If anything his response should have been immediate, and yet Steve notices the delay.
They’re finally able to start working on the nursery, and it’s Tony’s turn to want to make things simple. The mansion wasn’t their home, at least not really. They’d be moving back to New York once Peter was born and it was there where they’d raise their son. The nursery at the mansion didn’t have to be extravagant when Peter’s room was back at the tower.
Steve tips his head back against the wall, settling his gaze on the bulb above him. He breathes steadily through each contraction. The pressure in his pelvis increased; it was almost time to push.
“That’s good.” Tony stands and makes his way toward the stairs, fingers still gripping the envelope tightly.
One glance around the silent table has Peter wishing he could be thrown off the roof. No one has said a word since everyone sat down. His parents were having some sort of silent conversation between themselves, something Peter has witnessed before. It makes him roll his eyes and stab his chicken a little too harshly. He knows it wasn’t the poor chocken’s fault, but someone else has to suffer alongside him.
Steve takes Morgan to the nursery to put her down for her nap and Tony heads in the direction of their bedroom. He paces the floor, an internal battle going on inside him. He needs to talk to Steve, but he’s afraid. Honestly, he’s not sure what he’s even afraid of. Was he afraid that he would upset his husband? Was he afraid that Steve would actually come clean and confess that in fact he wasn’t okay and that he needed help? Tony wasn’t sure.
Peter is screaming for Bucky to stop, and Sam and Natasha wrestle to get Bucky off Tony. Their efforts prove futile, and it’s Peter who breaks up the fight. The sticky web latches onto Bucky’s arm, and Peter pulls roughly, gritting his teeth as he struggles to pull his uncle’s arm away from his dad’s face.
That plan could still very well be in motion. He already accomplished the escape part and it was highly unlikely that they would search for him here. For the time being he was safe. His pup was safe. That’s all that mattered.
The other omega says something Steve doesn’t quite catch, then she’s turning on her heel and heading back to the elevator. It’s just him and Tony now.
“What!” Steve snaps his head up, eyes widening at the question being asked. “No! I can’t be-I’m not..ah!”
Steve scoffs and slips his hands free. “Better? Sure. This is better. This is better for who, Tony? Our son? Me? No, it’s better for you.”
The drink burns as it goes down, but it doesn’t compare to the discomfort he’s already suffering through. Tony takes another drink from his glass until it’s empty. He tells himself just one for tonight, but it’s a lie. Pretty soon he’s going to drag his ass off the couch and toward the bar.
Flash’s eyes dart down to Peter’s stomach, and suddenly he has the urge to touch it. He holds off on that urge, deciding it wouldn’t be the appropriate time. He was smart to wait because the door opens and he jumps, expecting scary Tony Stark.
It was usually the alphas showing more strength and aggressiveness, but Steve wasn’t any ordinary omega. He was stronger than any alpha Tony had ever crossed. He was not to be underestimated, and pretty soon Hydra and Alexander Pierce were going to realize that.
“I don’t want to touch it ever!” Peter exclaims angrily and more hot tears run down his face. “This is his home too. Why do we have to mess it up?”
Hey guys. Sorry for the late update. I swear I’ve been trying to get my stories updated but I’m struggling, especially now after hearing about Chadwick. I’m devastated and honestly feel horrible. It’s hitting me so hard and no one in my family understands. Sorry I just wanted to get that off my chest. Anyway, thank you so much for your wonderful support. It means a lot ❤️❤️❤️
“Right.” Steve nods. He’s gotten better about leaving Peter with one of their friends. Being a parent had many rough days and break was something Steve found himself needing.
“What?” Tony finally has enough air to speak. Pepper’s eyes are full of tears again and they’re streaming down her face. He’s never seen her so distraught. “Pep, he’s not...what?”
“The choice should be obvious, and it is. I’m keeping the baby. If you want to be on board then...then that would be ideal. Great even. If not...I understand. I just thought you should know. You deserve to know. Please call me back. Bye.”
Tony sighs and pulls out his phone. He taps quickly on the screen until he’s pulling up images from his security footage. The first video still is of Alexander Pierce.
The moment he learned of her existence was the day he vowed to protect and love her for as long as he lived. But when she came, that promise he made was broken. He had only kept part of it.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Not really. But yeah...you were right. I don’t know why I ignored the signs. They were right there this whole time.”
Steve is still asleep by the time Tony comes back upstairs. One peek in the room shows the omega passed out with the envelope resting over his belly. Tony smiles softly and steps into the room, careful not to disturb him.
Tony grunts again and takes a deep breath before bearing down, this time with more effort. His hard work pays off because Peter is inching closer, his head slipping free and weighing heavily between Tony’s legs.
“Don’t say stuff like that,” Pepper scolds. “You know he isn’t that person anymore, just like you aren’t the guy they think you are. You’re definitely not perfect-”
“I’m gonna miss you, Pete. Be good for Papa okay?” Tony tells his son, then he’s turning toward Steve. “And if he fights you don’t hesitate to call. I’ll be down here in a heartbeat.”
Steve isn’t asleep, and Tony finds him curled around himself and staring blankly at the wall. Tony lets out a small sigh and crawls in beside him, wrapping his arms around him and pressing a kiss to the back of his neck. “Honey, talk to me. What’s wrong?” Tony asks, sensing that something other than sleep deprivation was affecting Steve.
Tony sighs heavily. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. Now get out of here so I can clean up. You’re not doing a damn thing today.”
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts. He sounds annoyed. “The mission didn’t go according to plan. Captain Rogers-”
But now as he makes his way through the cemetery and toward the familiar gravesite, his heart clenches painfully. He takes a slow, deep breath to keep himself from breaking. His eyes fill with tears despite how much he wishes they wouldn’t, and he squeezes his eyes shut, not wanting to give into the pain.
Nick didn’t kill him, but the look he gives Steve when the Captain enters the room with his son holding his hand could kill. Steve doesn’t even bother trying to apologize, knowing it wouldn’t do any good.
It wasn’t until he met with Doctor Patterson did she confirm the pregnancy. The news was both shocking and happy at the same time. Getting pregnant was difficult for him and for years he wondered if it would ever happen. He had gotten lucky when he conceived Harley.
“You did everything you could. Steve-” Tony quickly takes his husband's hands. “-you did everything right. It’s not your fault. And don’t think for a second that I blame you because I don’t. These things happen. But God does it hurt. It hurts so fucking much.”
Steve heaves out a heavy sigh before answering, “I...panicked. I didn’t know the first thing about being a parent. I didn’t know your dad very well, you know with us sharing a mutual friend and all, but I told him and he freaked out.”
A snarky comment builds on Tony’s tongue, but for once he remains silent. He probably wouldn’t have time to even form the words. Bucky would have him dead in seconds.
“I guess you have a point. Tell you what, after I’m done with these I’ll play with you and Pete can hang out with mommy. Sound good?”
“Yeah,” Peter sighs sadly and picks up some egg onto his work. The first bite is tolerable so he keeps eating, hoping this is the day he can keep his stomach full.
, Tony has to remind himself. Steve is always reminding him, but lately he’s been too distracted preparing for their son’s arrival. Tony needs that assurance. But it won’t do any good. He’d still continue to poison his unborn son.
Tony smiles down at him and continues to stroke his face until he’s sure Peter is peacefully sleeping. He leans down to give him a kiss, then he goes back to join Steve.
Steve nods and he finds himself drifting back to sleep now that Peter has stopped crying. It’s not until he hears the sound of Tony’s feet against the floor and small whimpers does his eyes shoot open. The bedside lamp is turned on, its once dim glow now too bright.
He gives his friend and daughter one last look, then he’s turning away and heading back in the direction of his own apartment.
He shoves aside the conversation he had with Jarvis and focuses on the design plans for his son’s room. For a moment he’s able to get lost in the project, but not for long.
I love Dodger! He’s so sweet 🥰 I enjoyed writing this and all the cuteness. I love my angst but fluff is always needed. I hope you guys liked it! ❤️
The rims of his eyes were inflamed, his cheeks were blotchy and wet, and his nose was red and dripping snot. Peter grabs more tissue to wipe away all of the evidence of his tears.
“Maybe.” Tony agrees and Peter’s expression softens. “Your life would be easier, right? You’d have Steve and all of the Avengers. Life would be good. So yeah, maybe it should have been me. I don’t have anything good to offer.”
“Don’t fight me.” Alexander growls, and he grips Steve tightly by the jaw, forcing their eyes to meet. “You’ve brought this on yourself. You disobeyed me, and now I have to punish you.”
Natasha leans forward to kiss Steve on the cheek, then she’s rising to her feet and gesturing for both Sam and Bucky to follow. Tony walks them out, shutting the door after saying his goodbyes. He turns back toward Steve, sighing sadly at the sight he finds him in.
“Let me take over. All I’ve done today is sit through another boring meeting. Waste of my time, really. I should’ve been here with you.”
Sorry you guys! It’s been so crazy lately and I’ve been struggling to update. I finally got this one finished and hopefully I can work on my other works. Thank you for being so patient!
“Just tell everyone you gained weight. It’s not a total lie. Oh but wait…what happens if you go into labor in class?”
“That’s your baby.” The doctor points at the screen and Steve leans even closer, eyes growing misty at the tiny blob in the middle of the screen.
The Avengers had grown significantly over the years; their team was stronger now, more so than it’s ever been. It was the perfect time for Iron Man and Captain America to settle down and start a family. Of course there would still be days when the world needed them, but that’s when the support of their teammates came in. Natasha had offered to babysit whenever Steve and Tony needed a break from parenthood.
Steve nods and rests his head back. Tony makes sure he’s comfortable before returning to the front of the jet. Happy turns in his seat when he hears him come in.
Natasha doesn’t seem too convinced, not that Tony was expecting her to be. There were days when he wasn’t convinced with his own words either.
“Yeah. I don’t mind, if that’s what you’re wondering. I love all of the changes. Having Pete has its moments, sure, but I wouldn’t trade that little boy for anything. And...I got you back. I thought we were done.”
While he waits for his parents to come downstairs, Peter helps himself to a piece of candy from the bowl on the coffee table, giggling when a fake hand attached to the bowl reaches down to grab him.
“Good,” Tony shoots Steve a small smile. “If you need anything just ask Jarvis. I’ll make the meeting quick.”
Harley giggles and lets go of Sam so that he can hold out his arms for his father. Tony takes him into his arms and hugs him close.
“I was told this wasn’t possible,” Steve says and he gazes down at the sleeping baby on his chest. “Him. He...he shouldn’t be possible.”
“Steve, are you alright?” She comes closer, the smile on her face faltering and replaced with frown. “What’s going on?”
“Why do you want us to mate so bad, J? Do you get off on it or something?” Tony chuckles at his own lame joke. The AI is clearly unamused.
“Wow. You must have your hands full. Four pups. I don’t have any myself. Riley and I never had a chance to.”
It’s heartbreaking and Peter wishes he didn’t have the urge to run away and only consider his dad family. The team had been his family for as long as he could remember. He couldn’t leave them yet.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Peter mumbles and turns his head toward the window to hopefully avoid another painful conversation.
Peter shakes his head and reaches for the glasses, ready to take them off. “Dad, I don’t like this.”
“Speaking of sleep…” Tony lets out a yawn. The exhaustion has finally caught up to him. He stretches his arms over his head, groaning softly when his back and shoulders pop. “Maybe we should actually sleep now.”
Steve sighs and rolls his eyes. Tony knows a fight is about to break out, and he decides to put an end to it before it begins. “Steve, I’m sorry. I just...he’s everywhere and you’re always ignoring me-”
Tony nods and Steve pecks him on the cheek before making his way up the stairs to console their son.
being the issue into your head just to cover my trail. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. You never noticed the tea, or the extra pill I would slip in with the rest of your vitamins. You didn’t even notice when your food was tampered with.”
Tony holds onto Steve while he cries. Steve clings to him tightly, fingers digging into the soft fabric of his shirt and staining it with his tears. Tony witnessed Steve cry before, but this time was different. He can finally see the pain and suffering Steve was battling on a daily basis, and it killed him inside. Steve was hurting and deep down Tony didn’t know how to help him.
“No it’s okay. You stay and do what you want. I’ll just be…” Tony trails off and glances toward the direction of the car. Peter doesn’t protest and he stays behind while Tony heads back to the car.
Tony’s heart breaks at those words. He wants to tell his son that he’ll do better and they’ll find a way to work past this, but he knows when he’s pushed someone away.
“Yes,” Steve snaps and he rises to his feet, grumbling in frustration when the wet spots continue to grow. “Jesus. I just changed.”
“Fuck, Tony. I’m so close,” Steve pants, thrusting faster and harder. He’s hitting that spot inside Tony every time. They both weren’t going to last.
“I know,” Tony says, his tone calmer. “I know. And it was so stupid of me. The test, the lying; all of it was stupid and I’m sorry. I’m not good at this. I’m not good at opening up to people. I’m terrified of the idea of falling in love because the last thing I want to do is hurt someone I care about. But then you happened and I fell hard. At the time it had been just helping you out but then something changed and...and I fell in love with you.”
Tony kisses him again, properly this time. They’re forced to break apart when Jarvis reminds Tony of the call that’s on hold.
“There we go. All better.” Tony tells her while he gently wipes around her mouth. He glances up at Steve. “You gonna get ready?”
It’s been two years since Steve escaped Hydra. The past couple of years haven’t been easy. Dealing with four pups on top of discovering a new world and finding his place in it left Steve overwhelmed. He doesn’t know what he’d do without his wonderful mate.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry Uncle Bucky hit you and said all those things. I know you didn’t kill him. I guess he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Peter takes a deep breath to calm himself and once he deems himself presentable, he leaves the bathroom. He makes the mistake of glancing down, and that’s when he collides with another body. Shit. It’s probably Flash.
I got a tiny bit of inspiration for this story. I’m still working on it. I have some ideas but there for later chapters so I’m still trying to figure out what else to add.
“Steve,” Bruce acknowledges the omega. “How far along are you?” He asks, coming closer to begin the exam.
There was a moment of doubt and self worth, but little by little he was finding his place in the world. His papa had believed he could do great things, whether that was as Spider-Man or just by being Peter. He didn’t want to let his papa down, so he started to work hard to become the hero he was destined to be.
The brief session that’s been called should only last twenty minutes. Thirty minutes at most. The team is already gathered, ready to start the discussion regarding their newest assignment. All of the chairs are filled. All but one.
“I don’t know,” Steve replies softly. He plays with the plastic ring around the bottleneck. “I do...but...I’m scared.”
“I’ll sign them in a minute,” he mutters and pulls out his phone, his finger hovering over a number he should’ve called a long time ago.
And poor Steve just can’t catch a break. How about a little more drama in the next chapter and then he can have a moment to relax? Sound good? Good!
“Where’s Uncle-” Peter pauses when his hair is ruffled and he turns, finding the person he had been asking about.
But God did he wish he could hide away again and pretend that his life wasn’t the shit show that it was.
“Papa?” Peter’s voice is quiet. Tears gather in his eyes and he has to squeeze them shut. He needs to be strong.
“Hey, hey,” Tony’s voice is calm when he takes Steve’s hands in his own. “You’re a wonderful mother. I know finding out about them is shocking but...it’s okay to be scared. They’re terrified too. But they have you now to take care of them.”
Steve pats his belly, wincing when a sharp pain shoots through it. He hisses from the discomfort and shifts in his seat. It leaves as soon as it appears.
But it’s not the odd contraption that piques Tony’s interest. The figure strapped to it is difficult to ignore.
“Yeah. Everyone’s super cool with it. Maybe you can come over for dinner. Uncle Sam makes the best food.”
Steve’s back arches and he comes with a small scream, his body tensing and eyes rolling to the back of his head. Tony continues to thrust his fingers and lapping up the sweet slick that spills from Steve’s fluttering hole.
Tony learns more of what kind of person Steve was. Steve was still the same heroic Captain that Tony knew him to be, but he was also a good friend and a good father. He sacrificed everything for the ones he loved. Their feelings and needs always came before his own.
The door to the bathroom is opening and Tony glances up, shooting Steve a small smile when he emerges, only for it to falter when he doesn’t receive one in return. He knew Steve was exhausted, but there was more than just a tired look in his eye.
“I’m not saying that,” Steve says, making sure his voice is calm. He doesn’t want to set Tony off. “I’m just saying maybe it’s time to get...different clothes. Something more comfortable.”
Steve smiles and gets a washcloth, then he’s running it under warm water and gently scrubbing it over his son’s face.
A knock on the door cuts through the retching sounds. Another knock follows not even a minute later, and then the door is opening.
Peter is calmer now, the tears in his eyes drying up and the frown on his face disappearing. Bucky smiles, feeling proud of himself for getting his nephew calm.
“Yeah. A scrawny, sick little pup. She did her best. Money was always an issue but she worked hard to give me a good life. She taught me everything I know. I wouldn’t be who I am without her. Thought sometimes I wonder if...if I lost myself. I wonder if she would still be proud of the man I am right now.”
“Yeah.” Steve is still in shock. For years he had been trained to never fight and to always comply. “I guess I did.”
Tony gives Steve one last look, silently pleading for them to stop fighting and work as a team. “I love you.”
Clint peers over Natasha’s shoulder. “He sort of resembles an old man, though. Hey, Stark, you were right about him looking like you.”
The suit would be a better way to keep his family safe. His days building weapons aided him in creating the suit. He could finally protect his family the way he was supposed to.
“Yeah. I’m good. I hate that guy,” Tony grumbles and rubs at his arm where another bruise is beginning to form.
Steve groans softly and leans forward to set his tea down, but Tony is faster and urges him to take it.
“Not yours but I’ve heard stories from others who have been. There’s a lot of alphas out there that are real assholes, even some betas. But Tony’s not one of them and you have no reason to doubt him.”
“I know. And I know you’d never abandon him. That’s not you. You’re doing the best you can, Tony. No one said any of this was going to be easy, and I hate to say it, but it’s only going to get worse before it can get better.”
“He’s better. He has his moments but...you’ve done something. Just be patient with him. Tony’s not a bad guy. He just does stupid things sometimes.”
Steve follows Nick and the woman he later learns as Maria Hill to a new part of the hellicarrier. Tony remains by his side, holding him close and comforting him with his scent and tender kisses. The PDA probably makes everyone else uncomfortable, but Steve can’t bring himself to care. He had his mate back and they were safe.
Sam sighs and leans forward in his seat, clasping his hands together. “He’s right. This isn’t the time to discuss replacements. If Peter wants to eventually take Cap’s place then great. And if he wants to meet Tony...I guess that’s okay too.”
He’s not left in complete darkness; the light to Steve’s room is still on, spilling into the living room and giving it a dim glow. Tony turns his head toward the hall, waiting for the light to be shut off and Steve to go to bed. But it remains on.
“I punched it...so yeah I guess. Ah!” Steve hisses when Tony starts to clean the wound. “You know the serum will take care of this, right?”
After his papa leaves the room and he’s alone again, Peter goes through the book. He finds the chapter that describes the week he’s currently in and reads the passage. He giggles to himself when the book describes the baby being the size of a blueberry at this stage.
Peter voices his complaints about the new position, whimpering again when he’s no longer on his father’s chest. Steve shushes him quietly as he gently pats his son’s back. It takes a few minutes before Peter is releasing a small burp. It’s messy when more than just air escapes and Tony quickly grabs the burping cloth to aid in cleanup.
Once Morgan has had her fill, Steve burps her then he takes her to the changing table to clean her up. He dresses her quickly.
It’s their first outing in public after the discovery of their son. There was hesitation being out in the public eye with fear that the press would cause problems. Tony was used to the attention and the headlines that always followed when he was spotted out. Steve not so much. He’s shown up in tabloids whenever he was by Tony’s side. It happened when they were first dating and again during their honeymoon. Sooner or later news was going to get out that the famous superhero couple was expecting.
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s crying until his vision blurs and he feels wetness on his cheeks. He wipes the tears away with the sleeve of his sweater and sniffs. He pushes those negative thoughts aside and continues cutting the vegetables for dinner.
Tony rolls his eyes and makes his way up the stairs. He finds the omega fast asleep in the large bed, still in the sweatshirt and curled around the pillows. He looks so tiny, so delicate.
“That’s it! Fuck!” Tony cries and buries his face deeper into Steve’s chest. “Shit, this hurts. This really fucking hurts.”
It never went well. He still felt the pain and anger from the fallout he had with his friends, but more importantly, Steve. As much as he wants to blame Steve for his bitter attitude, the finger doesn’t deserve to be pointed at him. Tony royally fucked up, and now he had to deal with it.
Tony pulls away first and presses his lips against Steve’s ear. “Get on the bed, baby. Let me make it up to you.”
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Maybe robotic arms to sprout out of the computer and poke and prod at his growing middle. But it’s nothing like that. He doesn’t feel anything.
This chapter is just some fluffy stuff. I love writing Steve and Tony as parents because it’s so soft and cute! I’m used to writing more angsty things so I wanted some fluff. Which this story will have most of in the beginning until the angst comes in.
“Yet.” Tony chuckles as he takes the car seat away to pack it up until they need it again. “Babies love to pull and chew on things. Dodger will be slobbered on, no doubt about it.”
“I love you, too.” Tony turns back around and takes Steve’s hands, bringing his mate closer. “I love you so much. I mean it. I’m crazy about you, Steve. You think someone like me never existed, but it’s you I thought didn’t exist.”
“Wait, Tony! You forgot about the-” The door slams and Steve has gone unheard. He sighs. “-hologram. Dammit.”
“What am I going to do with you?” Pepper shakes her head and comes over, pulling open the first drawer of his desk and retrieving the red tie that’s inside.
“Hey,” he says quietly. “Can I come in? Just for a second? I swear I’m not trying to steal anymore time.”
“He’s at home,” Tony finally replies to the question. He lays Morgan over his shoulder, one hand supporting her tiny head and the other her bottom. She’s still whimpering. “Shh, it’s okay, sweetheart. You’re okay now.”
“This doesn’t look half bad.” Tony smiles proudly at the work they’ve accomplished. The table is set with two dinner plates, utensils, two glasses of water and a bowl of salad in the center. Steve joins him at the table with a plate of garlic bread. “I thought you didn’t know how to cook, Cap.”
“You mean the side that tortures and brainwashes omegas? Yeah, it's a great side. Let me guess, you have jackets?”
“Shh.” Steve holds a finger to his lips. “Don’t wake your brothers and sister. It’s a little late for them to have hot chocolate.”
Peter takes a deep breath. “It means I have these really weird powers and I’m super sticky and can shoot web and-”
Tony chuckles and comes over, leaning down to press a kiss to the top to Steve’s head. “You’re almost there, honey. Two more weeks and then we’ll meet Peter.”
“I know. Pete’s a good kid. I just...she’s so young and I feel awful for leaving her now. We’ve never been separated before,” Steve says.
“Yes,” Tony assures. He slips one hand free from Steve’s to reach up and wipe the tears from Steve’s face. “I want you to be happy. That’s all that matters.”
Steve musters up the bit of strength he has left and he pushes. He screams through it, his throat burning. Then finally the baby is sliding out and into the doctor’s awaiting arms. Steve gasps and slumps forward, right into Tony’s arms.
The sun is just beginning to rise when Steve gets outside and on the track. Getting up this early wasn’t unusual for him. His morning runs have become part of his daily routine. It was going to be difficult to maintain once the baby arrived, but they still had months until then, and Steve was going to take advantage.
Tony moves toward her, his gaze falling on his fussy daughter. He wonders if she’s upset from being disturbed from a nap or if she can sense the energy in the room. Tony gestures for Natasha to sit in the seat he had been occupying earlier; he’s not going to be needing it anymore.
Tony turns away, deciding to get to know the man he decided to invite into his car. He never picked up strangers like this. Usually he was drunk and the stranger he met was someone he crossed paths with at a party and hoped to get lucky with.
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony releases Steve’s hand and rises to his feet. “Hang tight. Maybe get some sleep. It’s gonna be a few hours.”
Steve awakes with a gasp. He stares up at the ceiling, his eyes beginning to adjust to the dark. He’s panting and covered in sweat from his latest nightmare.
Tony can’t help but beam proudly as he boasts about his son. He never thought in a million years that he’d ever be doing something like that. He could gloat all day about himself and the inventions he’s created. His tech was his most prized possession; it meant more to him than anything else this material world had to offer.
“I just...um...isn’t she a little...young?” Tony tries to save himself. The last thing he wanted to do was upset Steve after all of the progress he’s made.
He loved his son. Of course he did. They didn’t have a strong relationship yet, but Tony vowed to create one and always keep it strong. He could admit to himself that he was a shitty father. How his son even wanted a relationship with him was baffling. But Tony was done hiding away from his problems.
“Why?” Steve interrupts. “Why do we need a story? The world doesn’t need to know about me or the pups. We’re fine.”
“Good. He’s kicking right now if you want to…” Steve trails off. Pepper smiles again and comes over, reaching out to place her hand over his belly. Steve takes her hand and leads it to the spot where Peter was currently moving.
“I’m home!” Morgan announces the second she steps through the front door. The first thing she notices is the mess of toys in the living room and her pouting younger brother sitting on the couch.
“James,” Steve calls out to the older pup and steel blue eyes meet his. “You can sit here.” Steve pats the spot on his right. The pup eyes the spot for a moment, then he curls up and shakes his head. Steve sighs sadly.
Tony is hard at work on something Steve can’t even fully comprehend when he makes his way down the stairs to Tony’s lab. The alpha has his back turned, his attention on the array of screens in front of him. More holographic images appear and Tony plays with them, making sounds of displeasure every now and then.
With furrowed brows Peter glances around, searching for the source. He expected another video to be playing, but when he finds the screen blank, he realizes the audio is from what sounds like a voicemail.
But now that he has it and no AI on his side, Tony feels even more lonely than he did before shutting himself in his penthouse.
His face burns from the blows he received and there’s a hint of copper in his mouth, but it’s nothing he hadn’t experienced before. Coming out of a mission unharmed was impossible.
“I love it.” Steve smiles and flips through the blank book, already imagining the pictures he’s going to fill it with. “I thought my art days were a thing of the past.”
Tony begs to differ, but he agrees to go back to the party with Peter, reminding himself yet again that he was here for his son and no one else.
Tony turns in his seat to watch Steve serve himself a glass of juice and grab a muffin while he chats with Bucky. Steve is nodding along to whatever Bucky is telling him, but the reaction isn’t what it normally is whenever he’s around his best friend. Steve seems distant, uninterested in whatever Bucky is saying.
“How did this happen again?” Pepper asks, brows furrowing. She continues to clean up the cut on Tony’s temple, sighing when he refuses to answer. “Tony-”
The tears don’t stop streaming down Peter’s face. They mesh with the falling rain, but Peter doesn’t care. He’s never felt so alone. So broken.
Tony carefully removes the tie around Steve’s eyes, smiling now that he can stare into them again. “Hi.”
Tony gives a glance around the room, frowning when he realizes he went overboard with the decorations. More was still needed to be done. The caterer would arrive soon with an array of food and a cake probably too big for just five people. And that wasn’t even including the gifts.
Peter takes a deep breath to calm himself. He feels guilty for ditching school and lying, but it had to be done. He needed to take care of his problem, then hopefully his life would return to normal.
That all changed when he got the serum and then met and fell in love with Tony. Steve held onto that hope that one day their little family of two would become three or four. Steve wanted a big family, and for the longest time he was sure he would get it.
Sam takes Bucky’s hand back in his own. “I’m not going anywhere. And even when I do die I’m haunting your ass.”
Peter doesn’t budge, turning his face when Steve offers him his nipple. Steve switches positions, wondering if Peter would prefer the other side. The reaction is the same.
Tony smiles and wraps Steve into his arms. “I love you,” he says and ducks down to place a kiss on Steve's head.
James is sitting on the bed, watching as his younger siblings play. Steve can tell he wants to join, but he’s holding back. Steve can’t wait for the day when all of his children are comfortable around him.
He’d be a father. Something he never imagined himself becoming. It would be his responsibility to care for the fragile life. He could barely take care of himself half the time. It was Pepper and Happy who were always checking in to make sure he was still breathing.
“You smell different,” Steve frowns and he leans closer, nose wrinkling from the scent he picks up. His face pales and his eyes go wide. “T-Tony…”
“Nat, that’s enough,” a new voice says and Peter feels relief wash over him at the sight of uncle Bucky walking towards them.
“Shut up,” Peter mumbles and makes his way over to his desk, plopping down onto the chair. He watches as Flash eyes the bed. “Just sit down.”
Steve smiles and leans back against the porch swing, sipping from his own mug and letting his eyes take in the quiet scenery. The night ambiance echoes around them, making the scene more relaxed.
“I know! God, Tony it’s not like we’re telling him his dog ran away or something. He lost a sibling! A sibling he was so excited for. How do we tell him that?”
Tony is left to watch completely dumbstruck with how quick Natasha is able to calm down his fussy son. He thought he was good at calming Peter, but now he was learning he had some serious competition.
They eventually break apart. Steve doesn’t miss how shiny her eyes appear. He sends her a small smile, hoping it’s enough to reassure her.
Tony makes sure Bruce is comfortable in one of the extra bedrooms before finally returning back to his little family. He pokes his head into the room, smiling at the sight of his mate and son. Steve has never looked so vibrant, so beautiful.
Steve turns in Tony’s arms until they’re facing each other. Tony smiles softly at him and strokes his face.
Tony can’t bring himself to think about Steve. Just hearing his name is too painful. He hates the way he remembers him. Their last face to face encounter had been worse than the first time Tony walked away from him. He blew Steve off, and never gave him a chance to speak.
“Then what are you gonna do? Because the Tony I know would pick himself up and get his shit together. You already wasted 15 years. Do you really want to waste another?”
“Then pizza it is,” Bucky grins and helps his husband off the floor. “You’re paying since you decided to be an ass.”
“Honey?” Tony lays a hand over Steve’s shoulder. “Just rest okay? I’m gonna schedule you an appointment for tomorrow. Are you in any pain?”
Peter wraps his arms around Tony’s neck and rests his head over his shoulder. Tony takes Peter to his room and tucks him into bed.
The room is cold, nothing at all like the warm one he’s normally kept in. It’s smaller too and lacking any windows, the only bit of light he has is coming from the single light bulb hanging above him. It gives off an eerie glow.
Peter reminds himself of the good things he still had. He may not have his papa around anymore, but at least he had the rest of his family. He could still train with his aunt and have dinner with his uncles. He could still learn about Asgard and the funny stories Uncle Thor liked to tell. He could still work in the lab with his Uncle Bruce. And when his Uncle Clint came around, they could practice with his bow.
He signs the discharge papers, wishing he could spend at least one more day with his son. But he was needed back home. So much needed to be done before they could bring Peter home. A nursery wasn’t even built and they didn’t have all of the essentials a newborn was going to need. It was overwhelming.
But the alpha inside him demands he breed the omega. Why else would he find himself locked in a room with a ripe and fertile omega? The omega was practically on display for him.
“T-Tony…” Steve stammers and ducks his head down so that he can bury it in Tony’s neck. He pants heavily as he increases the pace of hips, begging his stamina to keep up. For the first time it fails him.
The guilt is too much. It’s taking over every part of him, constantly reminding him of the horrible thing he was forced to do. He should be used to this feeling by now, and maybe over the years he’s learned to accept his fate, but this was different. This alpha was different.
Bucky realizes what Peter is doing and he backs off. Sam immediately holds him down and Natasha steps in to help Tony off the couch. She tries to look over the bruises and gash along Tony’s cheek, but he shrugs her off and moves away from Bucky, not wanting to risk another beat down.
“I think you’ll like it better than ice cream,” Steve says and takes one of Peter’s tiny hands, placing it over his belly. “You’re going to be a big brother.”
Steve almost whines at the idea of having to comply. His body was aching and begging for rest. He pushes himself a little harder, not wanting to disappoint.
“Sorry, kiddo. Peter. I think I’m going to name you Peter. And don’t ask about a middle name because I don’t know. I don’t even know if you’re going to be a Rogers. I’m trying, Pete. But the truth is...I don’t know what I’m doing.”
“Will you just stop? I wanted to take them in and raise them as my own. I love those kids, so don’t for a second even think that I regret them.”
Steve nods. He wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him down for a kiss. He clenches down on Tony’s cock, urging the alpha to move again. Tony groans and moves, slowly at first, until Steve’s begging has him fucking into Steve at a rough pace.
A small grin spreads across Tony’s face. “Yeah,” he says and pats his belly. “Guess we’re having a big kiddo. That’s from your side obviously.”
Peter sighs heavily and pulls out his phone, his heart sinking when he finds his inbox empty. Would it have killed his dad to at least send him a birthday text? Surely Peter didn’t screw up everything that much.
Peter thinks it over for a second. Then he says, “Last chance. I wouldn’t screw it up if I were you.”
“Tony.” Steve comes closer and cups the alpha’s busted face in his hands. Tony stares into his blue eyes, finding nothing but pain and fear in them. He misses the way they used to shine with happiness. All of that was gone now.
Peter grips the paper tight and crumples it in his hand. Sam pats his shoulder again, then he rises to his feet and goes back inside.
A sad smile appears over Natasha’s face. For a moment Peter feels he’s upset her by saying those famous words, but then her smile is gone and Peter knows he’s in trouble. He groans when he hits the mat again.
With a huff Steve rolls over onto his side and shuts his eyes, waiting for sleep to take him away from his never ending thoughts. Only, it’s not just Tony that’s keeping him awake. His belly is cramping up again. Steve cries out and buries his face into the pillow, breathing through it and praying for it to end.
Steve moves through the space until he spots something hanging up on the opposite side of the closet. This rack holds different sets of clothing; they’re more laid back and casual. It’s tempting to take a t-shirt with a name Steve doesn’t recognize, but it’s the black sweatshirt that’s caught his eye.
Steve chuckles and pecks Tony on the lips, then he gets up so he can get ready for bed. He slips off his shirt and tosses it into the hamper. He can feel Tony’s gaze on him, no doubt checking him out like he always does. It’s not until he turns to catch him in the act does he notice the confused expression on Tony’s face.
“Does it have to be a conference?” Steve asks after a few minutes of listening to Tony and Pepper go back and forth. Personally Steve doesn’t feel comfortable getting in front of the press to talk about it.
It didn’t happen overnight, but Tony eventually came around to the idea of having a dog and he grew closer with Dodger. Their relationship changed so much that Dodger started following Tony wherever he went. At first it was slightly annoying, but after a while Tony didn’t mind the dog’s presence.
“Yeah,” Bucky nods and glances in his husband’s direction, smirking when he catches the annoyed expression on Sam’s face. “I think I will.”
“Safer?” Bruce sighs and removes his glasses. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Tony, what are you not telling me?”
Steve walks Tony out, chuckling softly when Tony frowns at the idea of having to leave his son behind. Tony makes sure to give Peter plenty of kisses before he goes.
Steve’s oblivious to it. He believes the tears are for their loss. A part of it is, but the rest is the guilt. This was Tony’s fault.
Tony makes himself comfortable on the sofa and takes a drink, then he checks his phone. He had called and Happy had assured him that everything was fine and Steve would call him back. Steve hadn’t returned his call yet, and it was beginning to worry the alpha. He just needed to know that his mate was okay.
By the third time Peter wakes them up, neither one is prepared to answer their son’s cries. Steve groans into the pillow when he hears Peter’s crying through the monitor.
Tony lowers himself down on one of the sofas, his eyes immediately trailing to the empty armchair beside him. He wonders if Steve would have sat next to him, or maybe even talk to him. Maybe Steve would have been willing to forgive and they move forward. They would become the family Steve wanted them to be.
But now Steve wanted to take their love to the next level. He had done it once before when he agreed to marry Tony. But something was missing now.
“That’s really cool. Now we have another artist in the group. Sara is another one,” Sam says, gesturing to the older woman sitting across from Steve. Their eyes meet and she smiles softly. Steve smiles back, then it quickly falters. Sam senses the change in the omega almost immediately. “What’s wrong?”
“He’s perfect.” Steve’s eyes fill with tears and a few roll down his face. He had been emotional on the day he had his firstborn too, but these tears were not just for happiness, they were also tears of relief. He had another son, a healthy, baby boy that was his to love and cherish. He wasn’t going to lose this one.
The drinking was no longer a coping mechanism for him anymore. He’s proud to say it’s been a few months since he’s reached for the bottle. Even though Peter chose to step back and think, he was still working on Tony. It was crazy just how much that kid affected him.
Not much has been said about Tony’s surprising return. It was obvious the team wanted to sit down and talk about it, but finding the time was difficult. Sam’s injury was on everyone’s mind and their main priority. But it wasn’t the only reason for the delayed discussion. Talking about Tony wasn’t easy.
“Did you get taller?” Tony immediately turns to joking. He’s uncomfortable, wishing he could leave and never come back. His lake house beckons him, offering him tranquility and no ass whooping of any kind.
It’s not until they’re riding in the elevator does Tony break the silence. “So have you back by 6, right?”
But even though he had the suit and he placed some of his daddy’s gel in his hair, he still didn’t like the reflection staring back at him. Something was missing.
Tony is waiting for him in their bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed. He’s working on his tablet, but Steve knows it’s just a distraction. Tony peers up when he senses Steve’s presence and lays the tablet to the side.
I finally got around to getting this one updated! I can't say for sure when the next update will come but hopefully soon!
Tony was terrified. He tried to make more lame jokes to lighten the situation, claiming it was to distract Steve from the pain, but in reality it was just his way of coping. In just a few hours they would be welcoming their son and Tony would officially be a father. He had months to prepare for this moment and now that it had arrived, he felt like any preparation he had was stolen.
Tony’s eyes fall shut. An internal battle rages on within him. A part of him wants to give in to his needs and properly mate with Steve, but the other half screams at him to back off. The omega had been through enough. Tony had already hurt him once, and he didn’t want to do it again. He’d never forgive himself.
“Tony?” Steve gasps, eyes wide. He allows himself to go limp in front of the alpha. He submits like he knows how.
“Everyone loves presents! And cake and parties. Come on, you did it for me. Please?” Tony turns to begging now, using his best puppy dog eyes to persuade his mate.
But he’s not here for Clint or Thor or anyone else who wants to see him get his ass handed to him. He’s here for his son.
Morgan keeps her gaze locked on his face, listening contently to the familiar voice. Tony smiles and brings her closer to press his lips against her forehead. “You’ll be okay.”
“It’s an...acquired taste. I think I’ve had worse,” Tony says, then he sits down beside his son. “We’re good, right?”
Tony brings Morgan closer, softly shushing her and pressing a kiss to her head. She continues to cry, the sound getting harder and harder to hear.
“James?” Steve whispers and the older pup glances up at him, growling and snarling. Steve ignores the warning the young alpha gives and steps further into the room.
“Tony, getting him help isn’t messing anything up. It’s you caring about him and his well-being. I’d talk to him.”
Tony gives him one last look then he turns to leave the room, only to stop in his tracks when he hears a soft whimper. He spins around, finding Steve tossing and turning, whimpering. He’s at his side in seconds.
He can’t eat anymore, even though he knows his body needs it. His stomach is churning, and he can’t tell if it’s from the usual nausea that comes with pregnancy or the fact that Tony was being different toward him.
He doesn’t get much sleep. It’s not the pillow that prevents him from getting any rest. Steve is woken up by a sharp cramp in his belly. He can’t help but wake with a gasp, eyes going wide from the startling pain. He rolls over with a groan, one hand falling to the spot where he feels the muscles of his abdomen tightening.
“Alexander. You don’t have to call him that anymore. He has a name. Though I’d prefer to call him other names.”
Peter hadn’t been enthusiastic when he first heard that he was going to be a big brother. He was the baby and used to getting all of the attention, but eventually he came around to the idea and couldn’t wait for his little brother or sister to arrive.
Tony struggles to fall asleep. He’s gotten used to having Steve curled up beside him and his scent wafting through the air. The lack of his warmth only makes the bed that much colder.
Their moment is cut short when the sound of feet on the stairs can be heard. Harley rushes into the living room first, followed by Sarah and then James. The oldest is quiet when he comes down, not even muttering a greeting. He sits down on the sofa and distantly watches the tv show.
I’m so sorry for my lack of updates! Life has been...a pain to be honest. My car was vandalized so that’s in the shop while I await for the expensive part to come in. I did get a dog to cheer myself and my son up. It’s helped. I swear I’m trying to update more but my schedule is a mess right now.
It’s not the response Steve was hoping for. He wanted details. He wanted to know how his son was doing, if he was going to be okay.
Those three words bring hope. Tony was hinting at a chance. Steve wasn’t expecting anything out of the alpha, but a chance, a shot to get to know him and raise their pup together, was something Steve couldn’t deny he secretly hoped for.
He can’t stay any longer and he gets up from the bed, gathering a pile of clothes he might need from the closet before leaving and shutting the door behind him, vowing to never step foot in there again.
“C-coming!” He calls back, hating how shaky his voice sounds. He clears his throat and rushes toward the vanity to make himself presentable.
was a show Steve had definitely missed. There was still so much he needed to catch up on. Tony helped introduce him to new things when given the chance, but lately a lot of their time was spent preparing for their son’s birth.
“Actually, I love spending time with you. I like watching you work. It’s incredible what you can do and I wanted to capture those moments.”
Tony rocks slowly against Steve, pressing his body even closer. One arm is wrapped around the omega, the palm of his hand cradling his belly. He presses kisses and tender bites along Steve’s shoulder, trailing higher until he’s reaching the sensitive skin on his neck. Steve whines when his bond mark is nipped at. Tony smirks against the marked flesh and places soft kisses there.
Peter sobs again and pushes himself away from Tony to wipe at his eyes. “It wasn’t just you. He did stupid things too. I just wish you both would’ve done more. I wish he didn’t go on that stupid mission. I wish you had been there.”
“You?” Tony replies and Steve nods his head. “The guy who faced Hydra twice and won? The guy who didn’t give up and kept fighting, who continues to fight? Absolutely. Steve, you’re the strongest, most bravest person I’ve ever met. Every day you’re continuing to amaze me.
Tony finds Steve where he always is these days-curled up on the sofa with Peter snuggled up beside him. Tony smiles at the sight.
Tony pulls up to the cemetery and shuts off the ignition, a heavy sigh leaving him as he peers out the tinted window and toward the cemetery gates. He practically talked himself into coming, otherwise he’d still be cooped up in his lab and fighting the urge to drink.
At the mention of their son, whatever is left of Tony’s heart finally shatters. Their son. Their little boy. He was so excited to meet his baby brother or sister. Now they had to break the worst news to him. It wasn’t fair.
“See? I wasn’t entirely wrong,” Tony says and leans closer to kiss Peter’s cheek. “I love you, kiddo.”
Just as Tony had predicted, Dodger had been showing signs of protectiveness. It started out harmless, following Steve around the tower like he always did, and it wasn’t until Steve began showing did Dodger’s new behavior become worse. He was always around Steve, never leaving him out of his sight. Steve thought it was cute.
Peter takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes as he thinks about the worst day of his life. He finds the courage to open his eyes, and when he does, he gasps at what he sees.
“Bucky-” Natasha is the next to try and console him, but he’s not having any of it and he storms off.
But now he’s thinking maybe it was too soon. His aunt did say he could finish the rest of the year at home. Summer was just around the corner anyway. But Peter missed seeing Ned everyday and his studies did help take his mind off things, even if it was for a few hours.
“I can’t either. We have other options. Adoption is one. At least the baby can go to a home with people who want it.”
Steve doesn’t appear to notice Tony’s attitude and lowers his shirt, then he disappears to the bathroom to start his nightly routine.
They fall into a silence. It’s slightly uncomfortable, especially when the quiet continues to go on and no one appears to make the first move to end it. Steve finds it worrisome. He wonders what he did wrong.
“You have nothing to apologize for. This stuff happens to everyone. It happens to me sometimes.” Tony glances down at where his hands are still resting on Steve’s shoulders. He removes them quickly, not wanting to upset the omega more than he already was. He mutters an apology and leans back to give Steve space.
Sooner or later Tony was going to need to go back to his own apartment. Steve had honestly hoped for later, but he doesn’t make any attempts to stop him from leaving. He needed to figure out how to be alone with his son. Peter was going to be living with him full time and Steve didn’t want to rely on Tony for everything. He needed to prove he could take care of their son by himself.
“Hey don’t worry about it. I’m sure it will blow over and you’ll never think about that night again.”
