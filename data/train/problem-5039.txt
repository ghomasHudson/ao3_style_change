Steve stopped him with a firm kiss to his lips, just long and exaggerated enough to make Clint groan. "Hey, sweetheart," he said, rather impishly. "Wanna get a room?"
"Monday? There's no way in hell that I'm waiting until Monday!" Tony exclaimed. "No, you can be damn sure that you'll be hearing from my lawyers before midnight tonight, you got that? This is all just a big pile of bullshit and you know it!"
Tony’s lips twitched as he tried to hide his grimace.  Despite his reputation, he didn't really enjoy meeting new people.  People couldn't help but size him up as soon as they learned his name, and after a lifetime of it, Tony was beyond over it.
"I'm good," Peter said automatically, frowning when Dad quirked an eyebrow. "Seriously, Dad, I'm okay. I just… really miss you."
"Uh, thanks," said Gwen. She shot Peter a sly wink as she reshuffled her index cards. "Okay, Peter. Which two countries were first aided by what was known as the Truman Doctrine?"
"Okay, good," said Grandma. "Then I'm going check on how the caterer's doing right quick, all right?"
“Yes, yes, and I know you’ll be absolutely brilliant, my darling.”  Mags pats Peter on his hands, then stands to her feet, looking down at Tony.  “Your usual, then?”
"Thanks for walking with us, Dad," Gwen said as they arrived at the front doors of the school, where Peter could already see the dance going in full swing. He had managed to keep his composure through most of dinner, only getting a bit teary when Gwen asked him how Dad was doing. He tried to explain how hard it was for Dad with not knowing where Papa was or even if he was still alive, but who also felt like he had to hold himself together for Peter's sake.
Peter jumped back with a gasp as Dr Strange's eyes suddenly flew open and he shot to his feet, frowning as he glanced over at Peter, then at Mantis, Drax, and Quill, standing a few metres away.
"Steve!" Tony gasped, swerving to the left to avoid one of the guns that had locked onto him. "Steve, where's—where's Pete? Where is he—do you have him?"
"Bruce!" Steve yelped, ducking to avoid a war dog that launched for his neck only to be hit from behind by another, slamming him against a jagged boulder so hard that it knocked all the air from his lungs. Panic instantly welled up inside Steve, as it always did whenever he couldn't breathe, and for a moment he was completely frozen, unable to even raise his shield as at least five of the war dogs jumped on top of him, biting and tearing their way through his uniform.
"So far this is just the prototype design, and I'm not completely done with it yet," he began. "But once I'm finally happy with it I'll be making a whole fleet of 'em."
"Simon!" Mrs Stacy admonished as she shot Peter an apologetic glance. "I'm sure Peter doesn't really want to talk about that."
"Yeah, I remember you telling me some stuff when we were still studying World War II," Peter said. "He seems like he was a pretty cool guy."
"Yes! That's exactly what it is!" Steve exclaimed, his blue eyes wide as he looked down at Tony, obviously understanding that reference. "So it wouldn't be like Yesterday's Enterprise, it'd be more like Parallels!"
Steve breathed in slowly, deliberately relaxing his shoulders. He'd been hoping that not even O'Brien would dare to stoop that low, but apparently even the small amount of credit that Steve had tried to grant him had been misplaced.
Peter watched as Gwen's shoulders dropped, and she nodded, gently patting Peter's shoulder. "One of the other officers already called my mom, and she's trying to find someone to watch my brothers so she can get to the hospital."
"It okay if I take him out on the lake for a bit before dinner?" Steve whispered. "Give you a break for awhile?"
"What the hell?" Tony muttered as he grabbed onto Peter's elbow, heading over to Strange. "Uh, Strange? Are we all right here?"
Dr Strange sighed as he raised his scarred, slightly trembling hands, his left hand embossed with a large, golden two-fingered ring. "I'm very sorry, young man, but I don't really have time to explain it any further at the moment. Now, are you ready?"
"Yeah, Ned, I know that," Peter said, rather shortly. "But the leader in Moscow was still in control of everyone. Those other countries' leaders were just puppet governments installed by Moscow in rigged elections."
dinner, the one that had started with him getting basically interrogated by Chief Stacy and ended with him puking and writhing in pain from eating a piece of peppermint cake.
"Yes, but not like this," said Steve. "Getting details mixed up about the different HYDRA raids during the war isn't the same as having my two timelines merging together like this."
Steve gave a sigh; he'd been hoping Tony wouldn't ask that. "I'd like to. He seems sincere enough, and if he really thought that Peter was Spider-Man he could've arrested him or even gone to the press right after the attack at the theatre, but—"
Bruce had just finished rechecking Peter's temperature when there was a loud knock on the bathroom door.
He felt Steve grin against his skin. "Pretty sure I wasn't," he said. "In fact, I'm almost positive that you know exactly what I said."
And those of you who comment every week, I love you with all of my heart, and I can’t thank you enough.  ♥️♥️♥️
"There, there, little guy, you're safe now," Papa said once Peter was finally cleaned up and settled in his bed, his bandaged elbow propped up on an extra pillow. Papa was trying to sound reassuring, but even in his pain-induced delusional state Peter could still make out the thick edge of fear and anger in his voice, and still sense the worried looks that he and Dad were exchanging over his head.
"Captain Rogers," he said, offering Steve a quick salute that he returned. "The general is expecting you."
“I’ve always said that Pete’s the smart one, honey,” Dad said gently.  “So I’m thinking it’s a good day to listen to him.  Don't you?”
With Papa's stress levels already through the roof, Peter knew that having to travel across hundreds of kilometres of barren frozen countryside yet again wasn't helping him at all, and was probably causing Dad even more stress as well.
"Really?" Peter breathed, too exhausted to mount any more excitement than that. "Oh, thank you! Gwen's gonna be so happy!"
But, according to what Peter understood from the files, the HYDRA scientist Doctor List was still working with the CTX-616 form, which meant that he was basically trying to replicate Killian's super-soldier experiments while still retaining the memory-wiping effects.
"He did indeed, Master Peter. However, I must protest at this course of action. Captain Rogers and Mr Stark's instructions were clear that you were to—"
"And once, and once, and once," Tony cut in. "Honey, can you even hear yourself? And I thought I held the title for the best excuse-maker on the team, and you know I don't usually like to admit stuff like that."
"Uhh, that was Admiral Nimitz," Peter said, frowning as he flipped his pen again, catching it just before it would have flown over the edge of the table. Normally he would've been able to just rattle off answer to that trivia question without hesitation, but apparently not today.
"Yes, it does," Steve said, clearing his throat. He chugged down the rest of his drink, the blue stuff that reminded Tony of that goofy alien booze from one of Peter's favourite television shows. "So your father never spoke to you about it?"
Scott gave a nod, shoving the rest of his sandwich into his mouth. "Except that it probably wasn't as much as you're thinking. You see, the Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there you've got to be incredibly small. And time, well, let's just say that it doesn't work at all like it does out here. The rules in the Quantum Realm are, well, actually there really aren't any rules. Everything's unpredictable. So even though I was gone for about ten months out here, for me it was only about ten minutes."
Peter nodded, allowing Grandma to help him guide his IV tower into the bathroom next door to his room so he could pee and brush his teeth. He was so tired that he was practically falling asleep on his feet, his strength so low that he could barely even squeeze the toothpaste from his toothpaste tube. Lately it'd been taking so much of his energy to just keep breathing that even the simplest tasks had turned into almost unbearable chores.
Peter thought bitterly. Liz was his friend, and it hurt him to think of her being alone and afraid in some strange place and having to pretend to be someone else, with only her mother knowing who she really was.
"Um… pretty sure it was Uncle James," Peter said cheekily as he flipped over to Rhodey, landing gracefully onto his back. "Right, Uncle James?"
Guilt flashed across Peter's huge brown eyes as they locked with Tony's, just for a second before flitting away again. He looked so exhausted that Tony was surprised he was still able to stand, with his cheeks even paler than usual and big purple circles under his eyes, and while Tony could understand being tired—neither he nor Steve had been sleeping well lately—this seemed like a lot more than simple school-induced stress and fatigue.
"Yeah, it pretty much was," agreed Tony. He pressed his fist to his chest, right over his heart. "And his little head was right here, close enough for me to kiss him, and he just snuggled right in with his little face tilted up towards me, sucking on his thumb while the rest of his tiny fingers held onto my shirt. At first I was too scared to even move, thinking I'd wake him up again the second I tried to do anything besides just stand there, but after an hour or so I finally chanced it and sat down on the chair in his room. I'd say I was out less than thirty seconds after that."
"No, it's not okay, and I need you to understand this." Steve brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his finger over his wedding ring. "I love you, and if I've ever made you feel like all I'm doing is—is using you to help myself feel better, then that makes me a lousy husband, and—"
He gave the door a firm knock, then stepped back, tugging on the sleeves of his dress uniform jacket as a corporal opened the door.
"Nope, I guess I don't." Sam downed the last of his superwater, banging the bottle back down onto the table as Bucky got to his feet. "Guess we'll see ya tomorrow then, Cap. Class starts at 0700, so don't be late."
“Mmm,” Dad muttered as he nearly dropped his phone again.  “I was under the impression that the entire point of this conversation was to ensure that you
They took seats over by the window, leisurely sipping their hot drinks as they watched the various people walking by outside. People-watching had always been fascinating to Steve, and he'd been known to sit inside shops or outside on park benches for hours when Tony was busy in the lab or at a meeting, just observing humanity and occasionally sketching in his sketchbook.
"This was it, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he rubbed soothing circles on Tony's back. "This was the universe we've been looking for. It was almost identical to ours, they had gone through the snap just like we had. And Peter was there! He was right there, right in front of me! This has to be how we win, Tony, it just has to!"
And right there, worn proudly on his left arm, was the gauntlet. Golden in colour, it was embossed with four coloured stones set in a line across Thanos' knuckles. Purple for the Power Stone, blue for the Space Stone, red for the Reality Stone, yellow for the Mind Stone.
"What happened out there?" Steve yelped as he grabbed onto Bruce's shoulders, gritting his teeth. "This was a Code Green if I ever saw one, so where was Hulk? We needed him, Bruce! So where was he?"
Steve beamed as he took a mouthful of his own soup, closing his eyes against the wave of nostalgia that hit him square in the chest. Peter had told Steve the previous summer that tuberculosis was no longer an issue in the U.S., that it was barely even talked about, and Steve couldn't help but feel a bit bitter about the fact that his ma had had to die such a horrible death from an illness that was nothing more than a footnote in most medical texts only a few decades later.
"I see," said JARVIS after a short pause. "According to the top medical texts published in this country, it is quite unusual for someone of Master Peter's age to not have already undergone corrective surgery. Most children with this type of defect have it surgically repaired prior to six years of age."
“Yes,” Steve said, without hesitation as he grabbed onto Tony’s perfect ass, pressing down on him as he rolled his hips up to meet him.  A gasp tore from Tony’s throat at the friction, sending such a strong burst of heat across Steve’s chest that he threw his head back against the pillow.
"Okay, so hold on a sec," said John. "Are you trying to tell me that someone else had access to our super-secret, high-energy tech? Someone working for Meridia? Or with Meridia?"
“Copy that, Mother Hen,” Tony quips as he flies up over the roof, hovering in place.  “Hustle it up then, will ya?  I’m itching to finish this.”
"I would trust these agents with my life, Mr Stark," Stacy interrupted. "No, I'd trust them with my daughter's life. They are ready and willing to help, all we only have to give the word. I swear it."
"My main function is to monitor the transfer of energy from the tesseract to the individual satellites, and then from the satellites to the various national power plants," JARVIS replied. "But Master Peter created me with a virtually infinite capacity for expansion, so the possibilities are theoretically limitless."
"But, Tony… Peter's name is on that list. Our son's name is on that list, which means that the people here knew about him and what he can do. And now we don't know where they've gone or who else they've told."
And if it worked, which it would, as Dad's stuff never didn't work, then Peter wanted his dads to be in as good of a mood as possible when he asked,
"Yeah, I do, 'cause they did the same thing to me," answered Peter. "It was a different place, and they were different people, but they were still HYDRA. They were trying to take over my mind, only… it didn't quite work."
“Look, honey, all I’m saying is that I could be out there in only a few hours,” Tony said to the phone screen clutched in his hand.  “Then you'd at least have some decent company on this goddamn wild-goose chase Fury’s sending you on.  And with no backup, by the way.”
"Eh, Papa didn't mind too much," Peter said with a shrug. "Uncle Sam still teases him about it, though."
"That was very impressive, Mr Stark-Rogers, thank you!" exclaimed the lead judge as Peter concluded his three-minute unprepared speech. By sheer dumb luck the topic Peter had been given was the history of asthma treatments, which, thanks to his papa and his own experience with the disease as a young child, Peter was practically an expert on. Tony watched proudly behind his sunglasses as the entire audience applauded his sweet boy, a wide smile stretching across his lips almost against his will.
But Steve couldn't even bring himself to answer. It was like he'd been caught in some kind of energy shield, unable to even speak as he watched the enemy fly closer, and closer, and closer…
"All right, just give me a minute," Steve said as he disappeared into their closet, returning a few heartbeats later with his new Captain America uniform, complete with a brand-new cowl. "It even smells new."
"Um… well… sometimes it does get a little weird," Peter said, which wasn't even a lie. He felt Gwen squeeze his hand, giving hers a squeeze in return. "But you know, they're all pretty cool, so—"
A second later Steve came, hard and uncontrolled, shouting and gasping and writhing as Tony slammed home one final time.  A hoarse sob tore from his throat as he spilled inside Steve, collapsing on top of him once he was spent.  For several moments, Steve could honestly not move, could barely register the warmth of Tony’s breath and the slight scratch of his goatee as he trailed soft kisses all over Steve's chest and neck.
Making it even more important that he and Dad figure out what went wrong during the trial mission as soon as possible.
"I am grateful, Captain," T'Challa said, glancing around him as Peter, Shuri, and the twins came bursting out of a side palace entrance, their laughter echoing across the yard. "And in more ways than one. It is not often that my sister is able to enjoy being the teenager that she is, so spending this week with your younger team members has been good for her as well. She was very close to our father, and mourning him has not been easy for her."
But on the other hand, just like Stacy had said about Gwen, Steve knew how much Peter adored Gwen, and how devastated he would be if they were forced to end their relationship against their will. Gwen complimented Peter in ways that reminded Steve of his and Tony's relationship, and to lose her would not only break Peter's heart, but Steve and Tony's as well.
"Here, kiddo, take a sip of water, yeah?" Uncle Bucky said. He handed Peter his water glass, nodding in encouragement as Peter took three small sips. He did need to calm down, both for his own sake and for Papa's. Freaking out wasn't gonna do Papa any good now.
"Yeah, but this would all be a whole helluva lot easier if we knew where Thor was," said Bruce. "It's not like him to be gone this long."
"Good. Then let's go with that," Tony said. He collapsed the hologram and reached for his coffee cup, which had annoyingly gone cold already. "Is Steve awake yet, J?"
Uncle Bucky bit his lip, as if he was divulging a deep secret. "Yeah, I did, or at least I suspected. Never said nothin' to him, though, I didn't wanna embarrass him."
"Not yet, mo grá," Steve said, his voice so rough and husky that Tony couldn't help but let out an absolutely wanton moan. "Not gonna hurt you."
“I don't know about any other-way-round thing!” Peter protests.  “All I wanna know is what’s bothering you!”  He raises his hand as Tony starts to speak.  “And don't just tell me ‘nothing’, either, ‘cause I won’t believe you.”
Or that when he looked in the mirror and saw himself wearing the very uniform he’d sworn he would never touch again, it was almost like he was looking at a complete stranger.
"It's not safe for us to talk at the base anymore, sweetheart," Steve said, his voice so grim and monotone that Tony's blood ran cold. He curled his fingers around Tony's hand, as if trying to warm it, yet another thing that Tony adored about Steve. He radiated more heat than an actual space heater, and Tony absolutely loved soaking it up.
"Yeah, I liked how well we all worked together," agreed Steve. "It's too bad we don't have any way to contact him."
It’s no use.  Now that his curiosity is piqued, Steve’s not going to be able to concentrate on much of anything until that 4pm meeting is over.  Which means his entire day is pretty much shot.
Uncle Bucky flinched, shifting on the chair, and for a few seconds Peter was afraid that he'd hit such a strong nerve that Uncle Bucky was going to get up and walk out.
"No," said Tony, probably a bit more harshly than was necessary when Phillips scowled. "No, Colonel, nothing at all."
just another mission and no one knew that better than Tony, but he supposed they could pretend for a moment or two longer. He slid his fingers underneath Tony's chin, pressing a gentle, lingering kiss to his lips. "I'll see you soon, okay?"
"I wish I could agree with you," Peter murmured into her hair, her gorgeous, silky blonde hair that always smelled like honeysuckle and something else that he couldn't quite place. Sandalwood, maybe? Whatever it was, it was glorious, and apparently just what he needed at the moment. He breathed in deeply, feeling his tense muscles relax just enough to un-numb his toes and slightly lessen the tight pain across his shoulder blades.
Taking as much of the possibility of human error out of the equation as possible would only make things better, and Peter wanted to do whatever he could to make sure that Steve was able to get home safely.
"Call the emergency crews and alert the hospital!" ordered Phillips. "Tell them we're gonna have a very cold and very dehydrated pilot on our hands!"
"I'm sure our diplomatic relationship with King T'Challa will eventually grow to include a technology exchange, Tony," Steve cut in. "But for the moment, let's just concentrate on getting home, all right? Which means you need to be resting as much as possible."
"Huh?" Peter said as he snapped his head up, immediately grimacing as his Physics teacher, Ms Warren, shot him a look of irritation. "Um… yeah," he said sheepishly. "I'm—I'm here. Sorry."
Within reason, of course. But Steve could not recall a single time where he and Tony hadn't dropped everything the very second that Peter needed them.
And just like that, with three simple words, all of the tension and fear that Tony had been carrying for an entire week began to seep from his body like he was a human sieve.  He tipped forward, thudding his forehead against Steve’s chest as Steve’s strong arms wrapped around him and held him tight.
Now, though, it was like they were screaming at him, signaling him with flashing lights and blaring alarms.
"Well, Sam and I went on a lot of picnics back in the beginning," answered Bucky. "There's a nice spot east of the ball field that's great for stargazing, if you're into that kinda thing."
“Uh huh.  That’s what I said,” replied Peter.  “And before you go off laughing at me, don't forget about the time that you stepped on your own shoelace and face planted right in the middle of the entire lunchroom.”
"Eat, Tony," Rhodey suddenly said from his chair, startling Tony such that he almost knocked over his coffee cup. "'Cause in the state you're in right now you're not much good to anyone."
The dessert which had turned out to be only the very best blueberry pie that Tony had ever tasted, baked earlier in the day by his very own husband and son. Tony had enjoyed it so much that he'd even had a second piece, knowing that Steve and Peter would happily devour whatever he didn't finish.
"Meaning if the tesseract does try to cause any problems, the box its in will keep it in line," answered Tony.
Obie scowled as he pointed to the monitor.  “Yeah, you know, ‘cause that’s what it says right here.  I do know how to read, Tony.”
Peter rolled his eyes as he flopped backwards onto his bed, accidentally sending his polar bear bouncing onto the floor. "I know, Ned, okay? And if I could do something about it, I would. But I can't."
Uncle Bucky shrugged as he moved his far-side right pawn. "You were talkin' a bit loud, and you sounded upset."
As soon as the elevator doors closed behind Sam, Steve padded down the hall to Peter's room, poking his head around the door. He was still sleeping comfortably, his arms wrapped around his polar bear and his sweet face relaxed, with his bottom lip sticking out slightly. The sight of him was able to lighten Steve's heart just enough to make his footsteps back to his own bedroom seem a little less heavy.
"Nope, I'm good," answered Steve. "Numbers are good, JARVIS says I'll reach the atmosphere in fourteen seconds."
"I don't see anything but trees, personally," said Clint from the copilot's seat. "These Wakandan dudes aren't Ents, are they?"
So far, based on what Peter had already found, HYDRA had apparently been trying to use the CTX-616 to convert ordinary people into a controlled, enhanced army, a process that coincided with the arrival of Aldrich Killian. Killian had taken the drug and altered it into the form that had given him his super strength and pyrokinetic abilities, but didn't affect his memory like the CTX-616.
Bucky jumped slightly at the first sharp whistling sound of the pressurised air, but kept his eyes firmly on Peter the whole time, watching his face and smiling at his boyish joy at getting to work on something so unusual as a high-tech metal prosthetic arm. In addition to his almost-constantly running chemistry experiments, Peter had been assisting Tony with his work practically since he'd been old enough to walk, but he still approached nearly every new project with the same excitement as if it was the very first thing he'd ever been allowed to participate in.
Tony's lower lip was shaking, and he caught it between his teeth as he looked into the beautiful eyes of the man who he knew without a doubt loved his son just as much as he did.
And then Tony, who Steve had been forced to wake in order to quickly go over all of Thor's new information. Like Peter, he had tried hard to hide how frightened he was, and it had nearly cracked Steve's heart right down the middle to have had to leave him right after delivering that kind of news, knowing full well that Tony would make a beeline right to his lab as soon as the Quinjet took off.
"No!" Tony yelled. "No more!" He sucked in a deep, shaky breath, pressing his palm to his thudding heart. "I need to get back to the base."
that he’s never seen anything so unbelievably swoon-worthy as the dimple in Steve Rogers’ right cheek.
"Yeah," Tony whispered. Sometimes it was so easy to get lost in his own grief, he would forget that millions of others around the world were experiencing the very same thing as him and Steve.
"Have fun, buddy!" Tony called back, warmth spreading across his chest as he watched his two boys motor away until they disappeared into the sunlight beaming off the water.
you!" he choked past his tight throat, holding his boy as tightly as he dared. "It's been way too long, buddy. Way too long."
Tony flinched as the pencil in his hands snapped right in half, fighting against the tears threatening to reemerge.
"Steve?" Tony said as he skidded to a landing right behind Steve, his right repulsor at the ready. Gripping his shield, Steve pulled open the door to reveal another laboratory, complete with several machines that Steve remembered seeing in Dr Cho's offices as well as Tony's lab, as well as a couple of chemistry setups similar to what Peter used at home.
"Hmm. Well, thanks. And I should be able to get there in time to see you tomorrow evening, all right? Colonel Phillips told me he's gonna make sure that I'm able to leave on time at least twice a week from now on."
Peter swung his backpack onto his shoulder and stepped back, allowing Gwen to step in front of him. "After you."
"I am afraid I am unfamiliar with the phrase, 'like-like', Master Peter. Could you perhaps be more specific?"
As evenings go, it wasn't too bad. After finishing his homework and helping Uncle Sam make a massive pot of his nana's famous gumbo, the four of them settled onto the couches in the living room to watch The Last Jedi, which Uncle Bucky especially loved. Since he had seen it multiple times before, Peter ended up only paying half attention, preferring to focus on his papa's strong heartbeat beneath his ear and how cute Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky were all cuddled up on the opposite couch.
"I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else," replied Helen. "And while we're in the operating room, we will also repair Captain Rogers' cheekbone and realign one of the broken ribs on his left side, which is currently scraping against his lung."
Tony sighed, shifting Steve so his back was against Tony's chest with Tony's arm across him. "I know that, honey. And Pete's name was also in those research materials that you guys found in Siberia, so—"
After putting away his sketchpad and brushing his teeth, Steve crossed the items off his list and stripped out of his clothes.  He had been almost uncomfortably hard the entire time he’d been sketching, and so didn't waste any time grabbing the tube of lube from under his mattress and squeezing a generous amount into his palm.  He let out a sharp gasp as he began stroking himself, the pleasure immediately spiking to almost stratospheric levels.
“I knew you could do it, Papa, I just knew it!” Peter said as he carefully placed the glasses in their case.  Then he crawled onto the chair, giving Papa a long, tight hug.  “I’m so proud of you!”
Sam and Bucky were already standing outside the door of the restaurant when they arrived, Bucky looking a lot more like himself dressed in civilian clothes and wearing his metal prosthetic arm.  As soon as Peter saw him, he rushed over to give him a hug, the huge smile lighting up Bucky’s face making Tony swell with pride.
"Hey, Uncle Bucky!" Peter said, with probably more enthusiasm than was necessary. It had the intended effect though when Uncle Bucky gave him a huge smile in return, holding his arms open for a hug.
Steve thought, shocked at how quickly and easily the thought jumped into his mind. For a second he was afraid that he had even said it out loud when Tony shot him an alarmed glance, but quickly realised it was probably because he was squeezing Tony's hand so hard that he likely could no longer feel his own fingers.
Or at least, the conflict that Peter hoped would follow. He couldn't imagine that the Avengers would just sit idly by and allow the registration act to become the law of the land, because to do so would go against everything that Papa had fought for during the war and everything the Avengers had stood for up till now.
"Don't—don't turn away from me now. I need you. I can't—I can't do this by myself. I just can't. Please!"
"Yeah, don't I know it," Steve said with a wink. Then he tugged on Tony's hand, pulling him back against the far wall as Howard called for everyone's attention.
"No, Tony, right now I just need you to listen to me," he said. "I hope by now you've realised that nothing you say to me could possibly change how much I love you, or how much I love Peter, so please,
"I never said you were," Steve said. He dropped his shoulders, letting out a heavy sigh as he glided his palms up Tony's back. "I just… want you to remember that you're not alone in this. I'm here, and so is the rest of the team. And none of us like to see you like this, under so much constant stress. Especially Peter."
Phillips had informed Steve's team during their patrol briefing the day before that once it was determined that each of them had demonstrated the appropriate proficiency with the normal flight operations of the X-302s, they would then begin special simulator programs to prepare for a possible extra-atmospheric launch, which was apparently fancy science-code speak for space travel.
And it didn't help that Dad and Uncle Bruce had just recently uncovered a campaign funding trail from a company run by the late Alexander Pierce to not only President Cole, but also to several of the recently-elected senators, a fact that Dad had refused to pass along to Papa without Uncle Sam being present.
Out of the corner of his eye Steve could see a crowd forming behind the mass of fire trucks, see Sam Wilson being forcibly held back by one of the burly firefighters as he screamed Bucky's name over and over. Burning hot tears stung Steve's eyes, Sam's desperate pleas nearly cracking his heart in two as he gritted his teeth, ignoring the pain radiating throughout his arms and legs and his smoke-filled lungs as he slowly worked the canopy open.
"Um… that's—that's good," Tony choked past the lump in his throat. "So… what has Pete told you about Project Phoenix?"
Because he did. Steve knew exactly what Tony needed in that moment, because he needed the exact same thing.
"It's okay, Papa. We'll be able to fix you up again once we get out of here," Peter said softly as he helped Papa to his feet, draping his arm across his shoulders. He was heavily favouring his left foot, which looked so crushed and misshapen inside the boot he was wearing that it no doubt hurt like absolute hell.
“Well… remember those half-baked ideas that I mentioned?  I’m afraid this might be one of ‘em,” says Tony.
Taking Tony's hand, Steve guided him down the hall into their suite, settling them onto the plush couch in their sitting room with Tony's hands in his.
"And you would be correct, sir," JARVIS interrupted. "That particular code was written to allow Mr Beck to transfer certain project files to a computer server off of the Stark Industries premises."
try and pull that bullshit chivalrous nonsense again, 'cause I have already told you multiple times that it's not a goddamn option, so there's no point in you wasting your breath—"
"Yeah, well, that's just too damn bad now, isn't it," Tony said with a scowl. "'Cause I've been begging you and begging you to talk to Sam for who knows how long, and if you'd've just listened to me then we could've done this during the daylight hours like normal people. But since you're just too goddamn stubborn to see things for how they are, then I guess we're gonna have to do it now."
"It's just like what happened with Uncle James, Dad," said Peter. "Remember when they wanted to dump him too? He told me that Colonel Phillips almost lost his job trying to convince the government to keep him on, and that's just not okay. To cut off a person's access to treatment just because he can't fly anymore, or to kick people out of the Air Corps just because someone doesn't see them as useful anymore, it's just not right. And it's got to stop."
Actually, now that he thought about it, he didn't even know if Gwen considered herself his girlfriend or not, which was probably something that he should clarify before asking her if he could kiss her.
Thor also had taken to teasing Peter rather mercilessly about his friend Gwen, even going so far as to ask Peter what his intentions were the last time she was over, and then volunteering to speak to Chief Stacy on Peter's behalf when Peter ended up blushing and stammering too hard to answer.
smiles. He tentatively reached for her hand, his breath hitching when her fingers curled around his, ignoring the amused snort that Uncle Clint shot their way a second later. Gwen's hands were so soft, nothing like his own which were drier and more calloused from working in shop and chemistry and in Dad's lab at home. Peter had suffered from pretty bad eczema as a little boy, and while he hadn't had to worry about that since his enhancements started to emerge, he still doubted that he'd ever be able to get his skin as baby-soft as Gwen's.
The process of grieving, Steve had learned, was a fickle one, full of fits and starts, forward progress and backpedaling. Growing up without a father, as a boy Steve had watched his ma mourn her husband, killed on the field of battle half a world away, for most of his life. Later, losing his ma at age eighteen had forced him to mourn her in much the same way, all while still learning how to be a man in a time that didn't allow him to seek the kind of comfort that he desired.
A knot rose in Peter's throat, and he tore his gaze away, unable to look at her. She was right, and he knew it. But that didn't mean he had to admit it out loud.
"Tony, I'm so close," Steve said as his strokes grew more erratic, his sharp breaths even hotter as he gripped Tony's hip to the point of bruising. "Oh God, Tony, I'm gonna, I'm gonna—!"
It was revolting. Almost as gross as the old man passed out cold on the couch, a tipped-over highball glass barely caught in one hand.
"Oh, Captain Rogers!" Gwen cried as fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. "I'm—I'm so sorry! Peter—I never meant to—"
that followed was probably the loudest Tony had ever heard, causing the entire hangar to shimmy as Steve's excited voice came over the comm.
After staying in long enough that it would likely take a week for his fingers and toes to de-prune, Tony reluctantly shut off the water and blotted himself dry, his face twisting into a fierce scowl as his eyes trailed down the six-inch scar littering the centre of his chest, his semi-peaceful feeling all but evaporating into the cloud of steam rising above his head. He tried so hard to put its existence out of his mind that every single time he had to see it again it was as though he'd been slapped in the face with a brick.
"Gwen! Peter! Dinner's ready!" he called from the foot of the stairs, the youngest one from the pitch of his voice. "Mom says it's time to come down now!"
"Ahh… no. No reason," Tony answered, relief washing over him like a wave. After being forced to fight without JARVIS's help while up on Titan, it was a huge weight off Tony's mind to have his trusty UI back again.
“I love you too, honey.”  As the screen went blank, Tony pressed his palm over the arc reactor, his fingertips tracing along the chain that framed it.  On the chain hung the dog tags Steve had presented to him after they spent their first night together, tags that Tony hadn't taken off since.  He had known how much of a romantic Steve was pretty much from the get-go, when, after their first date, he informed Tony that he was going to demonstrate for Peter the proper way to court his “best guy”.  But Tony had shed honest-to-goodness tears that morning when Steve presented him with his dog tags, set in the middle of a breakfast tray complete with two plates of perfectly scrambled eggs, two homemade bagels loaded with melted butter, and two perfect cups of coffee.
“Call me, Bucky,” Bucky said as Sam helped him into his uniform jacket, making sure the Purple Heart medal pinned to his lapel was on prominent display.  “And yeah.  I’m ready to kick some ass.”
“Uh huh,” Peter says as he tosses the useless pair of goggles into the trash can next to his bed.  Then he picks up his bag and slings it over his shoulder, remembering at the last minute to grab a towel from the bathroom.
"Everything okay?" she asked once he was settled, his blankets pulled up to his chest. He had noticed that he'd been feeling even colder lately, corroborated by one of the doctors earlier who had increased the amount of the oxygen flowing into his nose.
"Well, for starters, just admitting the truth is a huge first step," said Sam. "Finally getting it out in the open instead of just letting it eat you up inside, especially when it's been going on for as long as it has, that's a big deal. And I don't think I have to tell you that Tony's been worried as hell about you, do I?"
An awkward pause followed, finally broken when Mrs Stacy cleared her throat. "So, Peter, Gwen tells us that you're in Academic Decathlon as well?"
At first, Steve didn't respond, too confused as to how in the hell he was able to look the man straight in the eye when he was lying on the floor.  It wasn’t until several heartbeats had passed that Steve realised that he actually
"Copy that," Steve said softly. Glancing back at Tony, he held out his hand, squeezing it gently once Tony was at his side. "I'd like the three of us to be the first off the jet."
He had just finished eating his lunch—Grandma had ordered him to take a nap after breakfast, using the excuse that his heart rate was too high for him to be doing anything more strenuous than sleeping—when he heard Uncle Sam, Uncle Bucky, and Uncle James all talking out in the hallway next to the kitchen. For all the times that the doctors and nurses in the hospital had spoken about Peter like they hadn't realised he could hear them, it was almost funny how often the adults in his own family did as well.
It still didn't make any sense, though. Dr Strange had been so emphatic back on the ship that he would rather allow Peter or Dad to die than give up the Time Stone to Thanos that he and Dad had almost come to blows, so for him to change his mind so suddenly in the heat of the moment only 'cause Dad happened to beg him to was just plain weird.
A second later his phone beeped with the probable location, an area not too far from an abandoned playground, close to a lake.
He could even tell that Gwen knew that something was up, especially since he had only managed to pick at his lunch earlier that day, his appetite almost nonexistent as Ned and Betty prattled on about something or other. Gwen hadn't had a chance to say anything yet, but Peter suspected that questions were coming as soon as practise was over.
"Oh, that's for sure," Steve forced past the knot in his throat. He knew Bucky was only trying to ease his own nervousness by talking. He'd done the same thing during the war too, before all of their HYDRA raids. It was just that Steve could barely even think about Peter and Tony without nearly doubling over in pain and worry, and he simply couldn't afford the luxury of doing so at the moment.
The boy gave an unaffected shrug. "So? We all know it's what Dad's thinking anyway, I'm just the only one brave enough to ask 'em out loud."
“No!” Papa said, bolting upright on the chair like he’d just flipped a switch inside his mind.  “No, I can’t do that!  Sam said that I can’t keep running away from this, so I’m not gonna do it anymore!”  He straightened his shoulders, nodding in Dad’s direction.  “I want to keep going.”
As soon as he stepped through the doors, Peter began a silent countdown, smirking when the two security guards fell into step behind him exactly eight seconds later.  Happy always liked to brag that his guards were invisible, that they blended it, and Peter had never had the heart to tell him that they just didn't.  All were big, burly, broad-shouldered guys at least six feet tall, many with previous NFL or WWE experience, who wore all-black suits with white shirts and black neckties, like they had just been teleported from the
"Don't you think these things kinda look like the speeders in Star Wars?" Bucky asked from Steve's side, his rifle clutched firmly in his hands.
He had always hated that disgusting moss shit, the green stuff that suffocated trees and gleefully ate its way through plaster and wood. Being the billionaire that he was, Tony had proudly employed a team of groundskeepers to care for the Malibu house, many of whom he had known for most of his life. They, like most of his employees, were wonderful people, devoted to their work and highly motivated by Tony's generous pay and benefits.
If he were braver, he would've banned it from the house altogether, especially since Howard's indulgence in the whisky—and his absolute dependence on, for that matter—had been steadily increasing over the years. As it was, Tony tried to justify it by telling himself that very few things brought Howard Stark any true joy, and so if the occasional glass—or three—happened to provide him with just enough to help make Tony and Peter's lives a bit easier, well, then Tony supposed it was worth it for the peace it provided.
Which likely meant that the stiffness he had felt while making Tony's breakfast and tying his running shoes earlier that morning had been because he had cracked another one of his knuckles.
"I didn't tell you about Steve 'cause I didn't wanna upset you," Peter said once he'd finally regained his breath. "You were already so bummed that you couldn't get here much, and I thought if you knew that some random pilot was visiting me you'd be even more bummed. I know how you feel about the Air Corps, and especially about most of their pilots, so—"
"Forgive me if I am being presumptuous, Captain, but I do not believe that screaming in your sleep and destroying yet another set of bed linens would qualify as 'fine'," said JARVIS. "In fact, if it were Mr Stark displaying such alarming behaviour, I do believe that you would encourage him to seek help, as you have encouraged Master Peter to seek help."
"Yes, you are," she said, so softly that Peter barely heard her. "But Steven, he doesn't know. I could never bring myself to tell him."
"Papa, are you okay?" Peter asked as they pulled into the school's parking lot. He slid off the back of the bike and handed Steve his helmet, his big brown eyes filled to the brim with concern.
"You just need to hush so they can fix you up, okay?" said Tony. "We'll go up and see him as soon as we can."
Peter's two dads, who seemed to be so stunned by his appearance that they were frozen in place, gaping at him like they weren't sure if he was real or just a mirage.
Steve's jaw clenched as he looked away, biting his lower lip as about a hundred different emotions bounced across his mind. "What, so you think I've just been using you? Tony, I
"JARVIS, are Peter and Tony awake yet?" Steve asked as the elevator continued its climb. Tony had been sound asleep when Steve's alarm had gone off ninety minutes earlier, so Steve had taken extra care not to disturb him as he readied for his run. Steve also knew that Peter had his own schedule of alarms to wake him up, but he always felt it prudent to check up on him anyway. With how fast Peter had been growing lately he'd been sleeping like a rock at night, and was often pretty difficult to rouse.
He should’ve known the day was going to go to shit the moment he got off the elevator, when he saw the look on Pepper’s face.  Pepper had been Tony’s assistant since Peter was two years old, and so had seen Tony go through a lot of crap.  But Tony had never, in over a decade of knowing her, seen her look so uneasy as she had been when she handed him his coffee that morning.
Everyone was eager to reassume some level of normalcy after an entire year of absolute chaos. Or at least as "normal" as a team of superheroes could achieve while still being superheroes.
But somehow that didn't often help all that much. Especially not when it seemed like the demons always managed to wind up on top while he, Steve, and Peter were just left there hanging.
"Mmm, I think you're right," Steve said. He let out a soft moan as Tony's lips found that sweet spot of his right below his jaw, his eyes fluttering closed at the sharp bolt of sensation that shot through his body.
"Nah, no one got hurt," said Uncle Sam. "Might've scared the hell outta some birds, but no one got hurt."
"Okay, maybe, but—um… I still don't—" Peter paused as he shook his head, internally kicking himself.
And right on its heels, all the ways that he could make HYDRA pay for all of the pain and suffering they had caused his family, if he was just able to figure out where they'd taken Papa.
While they hadn't accomplished everything that Tony had wanted to accomplish on the trip, especially when it came to getting his hands on some of the Wakandan technology, Steve was still relieved to know that the team had a powerful ally they could call on when and if they needed them.
"And so the serum turned him into a monster," said Tony. His eyes flicked in Howard's direction, his expression almost unreadable. "The serum is supposed to amplify everything inside the recipient, so good becomes better, and bad—"
Peter huffed, squinting as he tried to concentrate on opening his locker without breaking the lock. "Just… tired…" he finally said. "Didn't sleep all that great."
There was no way Steve could allow that to happen. He, and Tony as well, simply had to believe that just like their country—no, actually their entire
"Anyway," interrupted Steve. He had heard more stories about Tony's party-fueled and promiscuous college years than he ever cared to remember, especially since Tony was such a different person now that he had been back then. "Raxton wasn't the only other name left on that list, right? There was still one more."
Tony whispered as Steve broke away from his mouth to trail kisses down his jaw to his neck, sucking gently on his pulse point. "Honey, you're—I need—"
Steve had barely crossed over the threshold of their room when Tony's hands were on him, pulling and tearing at his clothes with the same pent-up desperation that Steve had felt ever since he'd carried Peter out of the hospital.
There was a brief pause for a moment while O'Brien contemplated Steve, looking him up and down as though he were inspecting his uniform cleanliness.
From what Steve already knew, desperate for anything to give them an edge on an already devastating and very costly war, Langaran military scientists—with the help of a few civilian contractors—had developed what they termed a Super Soldier serum, a compound designed to enhance a soldier's strength and physical agility in the hopes that these enhanced soldiers would be able to turn the tide of the war that much faster. As a small and rather sickly child who had grown into a small and still rather sickly young man, Steve hadn't even been under consideration to get the special serum until Colonel Phillips showed up at his ma's house late one night after curfew. Steve vividly remembered how they had locked themselves in his father's old study for nearly half the night, discussing various things back and forth in increasingly loud voices that finally came to a head when his mother yelled at Phillips that he knew it was what Joseph—Steve's father—would've wanted, and that Phillips at least owed him that.
Peter's shoulders sagged as he nodded. "I know, and I'm sorry, okay? I was really looking forward to my birthday party too, so… I guess I'm in a bit of a bad mood." He instinctively raised his right hand to scratch at his nose, jumping at Ned's sharp intake of breath.
"That is not at all what we think, young man, and you know it!" Dad retorted. "Papa and I are only trying to keep you safe, and—"
Tony thought bitterly as he unlocked his office door. Then he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and sank down onto his chair, pushing all thoughts of Rhodey's injury and Captain Rogers' sweat-plastered hair out of his mind as he imagined the huge smile on his sweet son's face when he told him that he'd gotten JARVIS up and running.
"Oh, yeah," said Tony. "Since it's only a couple blocks away from the school hosting the competition, I just thought it'd be easier than trying to cram everyone into a hotel."
"Oh, you think you're smarter than me, do ya?" he murmured, scrunching his nose as his fingers began flying across the datapad. "Well, let's just see about that, hmm? 'Cause I'm pretty sure that you're wrong. I'm one of Langara's best-kept secrets."
"But you are!" Peter exclaimed. "You are, and you know it! Dad, ever since the school year started you've been like this! I've seen it! I hear you pacing the halls at night, hear you and Papa bickering when he's trying to get you to stop and rest a bit, and it's just not getting better! So why can't you tell me what's going on?"
"Ohh," Steve murmured as a second firework shot up over the tall trees, starbursting into dazzling lines of green, white, and orange. Tony's breath hitched as he glanced over at his husband, and the way the bright colours reflected against his snow-sprinkled blond hair, making the strands almost sparkle.
"How—how many are left?" he stammered past his dry throat, his mind spinning way too fast to do the math.
"You can call me Doctor List, Captain," the man said, far more politely than Steve would expect from an agent of HYDRA. The man gave a slight bow, placing his hand on the middle of the young woman's back. "And this is one of my colleagues, Ms Wanda Maximoff."
Peter chuckled as he set down the duster.  “No, Papa.  I meant it’s embarrassing for them.  It’s not like you and Dad are asking for ‘em to make fools out of themselves.”
It wasn't until Tony had reached the sanctity of his own office that he’d realised he was shaking so badly that his knees were threatening to give out.  That had been the first time since he’d taken over as CEO that he had ever truly stood up for himself with Obie, the first time that Tony had basically told Obie to go jump into a bottomless lake, and it had been one of the most liberating experiences of his life.
, not offensive like Project Insight. It's not gonna be targeting innocent civilians just because we don't happen to agree with their political views or banking habits. The system will react if and only if it detects a threat to our safety, there won't be anything done proactively." He paused as he glanced at Steve, his jaw set tight. "And once they're in place—as long as they work according to my specs, which they will—then there should be no more incidents like that one at the lake, where I had to watch you be encased in ice like freaking Han Solo, and—"
Bruce gave a somber nod. "Yeah. The theory is that by reducing the kinetic energy of atoms, it condenses them and makes them colder, which—"
that! So why can't I fight too? Why can't I stand up for myself against the bullies just like you and Dad?"
“Good morning, Mr Stark,” his assistant, Pepper Potts, said as soon as he stepped onto the lush carpeted hallway that led to his office.  As always, she was impeccably dressed, with her expertly applied lipstick a perfect match for the bright pink of her three-inch—or was it four-inch?—heeled shoes, and carrying her ever-present clipboard in her left hand, no doubt covered with various appointments and other whatnots that were demanding Tony’s attention that day.
“No one else would be able to find it either,” Dad finished.  He huffed out a sharp breath, slapping his palm over his face so hard that Peter winced.  “Holy shit, bud.  I can’t—I can’t… I thought she betrayed me!”
"That's what I've always thought, but… lately I've been wondering if it meant something even more than that." Steve pursed his lips, giving his head a quick shake. "But that's a conversation we can have another time."
"Oh, you know," Peter said with a shrug, running his tongue across his dry lips. "Ms Sharon was off today, so… I just try not to bother anyone too much when she's off. It's okay."
"I'll tell you how it feels!" Thanos rasped as Mantis cried out from her perch on his shoulders. "It feels like this!"
Suddenly the entire screen of Tony's workstation lit up, with numbers scrolling by so quickly that he almost couldn't keep up.
"As for this dinner invitation, Dad and I are fine with it as long as you wait until after we get home. It should only be a couple more days, all right?"
He didn't remember all that much from the ensuing hours. He could vaguely recall his mother dragging him out to her car—calling for an emergency transport was well beyond their meagre budget—strapping on his safety belt, and slapping him lightly on the cheek, warning him very sternly that under no circumstances could he fall asleep. Steve's lungs were so tight it was as though they'd been caught in a vise, his throat so swollen and sore that he couldn't breathe out. He had been told by his doctors numerous times over the years that if he ever reached the point where he couldn't seem to exhale that he was in very serious trouble, and the thought that he was literally suffocating from his own built-up carbon dioxide as his ma drove only made his panic that much worse.
"I never wanted to presume," murmured Steve. "I know how much you love him, Tony, and I never wanted you to think that I was trying to intrude on anything—"
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, blinking away the tears still threatening to fall. If anyone knew how relentless HYDRA could be, it was Bucky.
Just then a light flashed, so hot and blindingly red to Peter's eyes that he cried out, releasing Papa and curling into himself as he tried to escape from the burn of it.
"I think I might have some idea," Steve said as he gently squeezed, pulling such a loud moan from Tony that it would've embarrassed the hell out of him if he hadn't trusted Steve implicitly.
Out of the corner of his eye Steve noticed Howard hanging back, shifting from foot to foot as all of Steve's teammates rushed past him to get to Peter, offering their thanks and congratulations. Steve stepped back once Ma and Bucky arrived, allowing them to take his place while he walked over to Howard.
"There's just too many of them!" Bruce yelped as he was brought down by another herd of war dogs, his metal arms and legs writhing in the dirt.
He wasn't ready. He wanted to watch as Thanos arrived, wanted to see the look on his hideous face as he realised he would be facing an army much larger than he'd anticipated.
"But you saved us first," Tony croaked. He wound his arm around Steve's neck, pulling him down for a sloppy kiss that was all teeth and tongues and panting breaths. "You just appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the desert. I couldn't believe you were even real."
"Looks like I'm about four minutes behind Steve," said Captain Barnes. "And my numbers match up with JARVIS's too."
A rather big problem, since it was kinda the entire point of the whole goddamn missile.  Obie had already thrown three massive fits about the fact that it still wasn’t ready, demanding in no uncertain terms that Tony have it ready to go by Monday morning.
Since it was already after curfew, the hallways and parking lot were dark and quiet as Steve gently loaded Peter into the backseat of Tony's car, tucking a blanket over him before crawling in next to him.
"'Cause the second he shows up you get that dreamy ga-ga look on your face," Bucky said, rather matter-of-factly. "You know, the look that you may as well be broadcasting throughout the entire base?"
"No, mo grá," Steve said as he lifted his head, his chest still heaving as he trailed his thumb across Tony's cheekbone, his eyes so full of love that Tony could barely look in them.
Gulping, Steve shook his head. "No, I can't say that I'm opposed to having your hands running all over me. But—"
He heard Dad sigh into the receiver. "I'm rapidly getting to the point where I just don't care anymore, Pete. If it means that I can't even get outta here in time to come and see you, then—then what's the goddamn point?"
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he brought his hands to his waistband, untying the drawstring. "Um… okay, but I thought that—" He paused when he noticed Tony reaching for a light blue bottle on the bedside table, recognising it as the same cream that he had applied to Steve's sunburned skin on their honeymoon. "Oh. Sweetheart, you don't have to do that, it'll probably heal up on its own in a few hours, so—"
"Well, good," said Tony. "The perfect place for you guys to hide while Sam and I pick off the stragglers."
The mood was subdued the next morning, the team speaking in soft whispers as they ate breakfast before suiting up and strapping the compass devices to their wrists. Stepping into the training dome, the team formed a circle as Tony completed a final check of JARVIS's interface with the tunnel controls. He had also linked JARVIS's program to the compass devices, which would hopefully allow the UI to pull someone out of the tunnel if their device somehow became damaged en route to the battle.
“All right, bud,” Tony finally said.  “I’ll text you once I leave the office, yeah?  Should be around 4:30 or so.”
"I didn't say that I was giving up, just that I understand," said Peter. "More than you think I do."
“Oh, yeah?” Tony snapped.  “Well, fuck you and your disgusting homophobia, Obadiah!  Fuck you for being a goddamn war profiteer who sold out his own country’s servicemen just so he could make a few extra bucks!  Don't you get it?  People are
"If you knew my papa at all you would know that he tried everything he could to save as many people as possible on that day, and that he's felt guilty every single day since then that he couldn't do more," he said quietly. "Papa always says that in his line of work he tries to save as many people as he can, and that sometimes they can't always save everyone, but deep down it eats away at him so much that he can't. So maybe the next time your father starts ranting about the Avengers and how it's their fault that the aliens came in the first place, you can tell him that."
"Does this information discuss anything regarding the possible extra-atmospheric travel?" Steve blurted out, his heart skittering when Anthony's wide brown eyes locked with his. "I mean, I'm not trying to pressure you or anything—I'm just—I'm just really curious, and—"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough already," said Tony. "The fact still remains that Fury told you that whatever this was doesn't need to concern us, and yet you're still making it our concern."
Once again Davis shuffled his papers, shooting a furtive glance at the poor aide sitting in the corner who would likely be job-hunting as soon as the hearing was over.
"Steve, something else is happening!" Bruce suddenly cried, clomping to a halt a few metres behind Steve, where the wind had mysteriously started to swirl, churning up dirt and leaves in its wake. "Oh God, he's coming!"
And Peter had not only managed to rebuild JARVIS practically from scratch in only a few hours, he had also done so by hacking into the Air Corps systems using only Bucky's datapad, and while gradually becoming so weak and hypoxic that it was a miracle he'd been able to think clearly at all.
"Did Peter tell you about the redesign I made for the containment vessel?" Howard cut in, tipping sideways into the wall. "The rhombus? It'll boost the energy output by at least—"
Steve was barely able to stop the corners of his mouth before they curved downwards. The prejudice and contempt that the old general had for Tony's father—and by extension for Tony and Peter—couldn't have been more obvious if he'd stated it outright.
"We're gonna figure it out, little guy," Steve said, a lot more calmly than he felt. "Somehow, we'll figure it out, because that's what we do."
"Good morning there, Cap," Carol said, her helmet tucked under one arm. Her eyes flicked between Steve and Tony, a rather smug smile playing on her lips when she noticed the love bite on Tony's neck. "You two get any sleep last night?"
Thankfully, Peter seemed eager enough to start practising with him, and his father seemed eager enough to grant Peter his wish, that Steve was able to spare himself that embarrassment.  He’s actually rather proud of himself that he asked for the amount of money that he did as well, when only moments before he was debating whether or not to charge less.
Peter's heart gave a quick lurch at the word 'friends', briefly wondering if Uncle Bucky was wrong and he had just been misreading Gwen's signals the whole time when Gwen glanced up at him through her beautiful long eyelashes, and his stomach did that flipping thing it often did whenever she looked at him.
"Ah, yeah, that's gonna be a no. Sorry," Bruce said firmly. He held up the syringe in front of Steve's nose, shaking it slightly. "This is enough tranquilliser for a hippo, or maybe even a triceratops, and you're gonna take it. 'Cause if you're gonna force me to reset and stitch up what looks like at least seven of your fingers and your left thumb, then I can't have you thrashing around on me while I'm trying to work. Not if you're ever gonna want to draw or paint again."
"Pete?" Dad suddenly said from his doorway, rapping his knuckles against the wood. "Feel like having a milkshake for dinner?"
A feat that turned out to be a lot more difficult than Steve had anticipated as the clock dragged along towards 1900 at the pace of a drunken snail.  Only the arrival of three separate customers during the final forty minutes was able to give him something else to focus his attention on, even if the final customer, a late twenty-something or early thirty-something woman, kept trying to flirt with him.  It wasn't the first time that a customer had tried to wheedle her way into Steve’s personal life, but since this particular lady had borne a striking resemblance to Bonnie, his girlfriend during his final year of high school and the first girl he’d ever slept with, she had been particularly annoying.
"Uhh, sure. I can do that." Ned did have a point. Watching Finley swim around in his tank was pretty relaxing, and something that Peter had been doing a lot of ever since Christmas Day. He had even set up a special camera so he could watch him while he was away.
Three months ago, Tony wouldn’t have even noticed the condescension dripping from Obie’s voice as he asked the question, or noticed his raised eyebrows as he glanced between the monitor and Tony, and the way his fingers were steepled under his chin.
Tony whirled around, swallowing his sharp retort as soon as his eyes landed on Bucky's face. Bucky looked almost as scared as Tony felt, with his pale cheeks and razor-sharp jaw. Back when they brought Bucky to the Tower after the Project Insight mess, Peter had been the first person to really get through to him, and Tony knew that Bucky's adoration for Peter was pretty much limitless because of it.
"What happened to me wasn't my fault, Tony," he said quietly. "You of all people should be able to understand that."
"So beautiful, isn't it?" he said, to no one in particular. "I've always imagined the Soul Stone to be the most striking of them. Almost like it's carrying its very own universe inside."
"As you wish, sir," JARVIS said, followed immediately by the familiar sound of his repulsors charging. They fired a split-second later, emanating the sound of his conventional suits almost perfectly.
"So, there's apparently two other people out there who were born with innate enhancements," Peter said. "Or, at least the potential for the development of them."
"Copy that," O'Brien said with a sigh. "However, you are under strict orders not to engage without authorisation, Lieutenant, is that understood? We just managed to broker a ceasefire after almost thirty years of war, so the absolute last thing we need to be doing is violating it before the damn ink's even dry."
They followed T'Challa into the sparsely furnished office, taking seats on the uncomfortable couches. Propping his shield up against his legs, Steve removed his cowl and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees.
That hospital stay had ended up lasting over a week, and once it was over, Steve swore that he would never, ever go through that again.
Before he even realised what he was doing Tony had turned around and grabbed Howard by the lapels of his uglier-than-sin robe, slamming him up against the wall.
"Hello, Peter," said Steve, attempting a smile. This boy was obviously far, far sicker than Tyler had ever been, and Steve wasn't quite sure he was comfortable with that yet. "My name is Steve."
Steve smiled into Tony's hair. "Back in my day, being invited to a girl's house for dinner meant that you were pretty serious about her."
"Catastrophe, gentlemen, on a level simply impossible to quantify," he said. "This is why we must find out all that we can, and we must do so as soon as possible."
Peter's eyes went wide as soon as the words left his mouth, thinking that he might've finally pushed Uncle Bucky over the edge. He held his breath, watching as Uncle Bucky's mouth opened and closed three separate times before he finally hung his head.
"They're both charming," said Steve. "There was no way I could've resisted either of them. I was a goner pretty much from day one."
"No, I don't think it's a coincidence either," Steve said. He let out a heavy sigh as he downed the rest of his tea. "I just don't like not knowing what's going on. Especially if it's something that might be important, if that makes any sense."
"My home," Tony repeated. He drew in a shaky breath, squeezing his eyes closed. It would no longer be a home without Peter there, and even if they did end up making it back, what if Steve wasn't there? What if he was nothing more than a mess of ashes, scattered across the Wakandan plain?
"Well, I guess after his accident, he kinda went nuts trying to find a cure for the nerve damage in his hands. Ended up selling just about everything he owned to try some really weird treatments," said Ned. "And then one day he just up and disappeared. My mom's friend thought he was dead until she saw him again."
Papa had never been good at hiding his emotions, and even less so since the attack up at the Compound. And the intense fear that had been constantly plastered all over Papa's face ever since the Compound attack was not something that Peter liked to see.
Peter immediately clapped his hand over his mouth, his eyes scanning rapidly across Uncle Bucky's face, where about a hundred different emotions were crossing all at once. "Oh my God, Uncle Bucky, I'm so sorry! I just blurt out things without thinking sometimes, my Dad says I get it from him, and I just—!"
“Okay, JARVIS,” Tony said as he crossed his arms, stepping back two paces.  “Go ahead and give that a try, yeah?”
"But, why?" asked Beck, sounding more like a whining teenager rather than an extremely intelligent engineer. "The MAUDE glasses don't work without the added effect of the drug, so without it the whole thing's useless!"
"Thanks, Rhodey," he whispered. He tore off a chunk of the muffin, shoving it into his mouth as he reached for the pills and the coffee cup. He tossed the pills back, swallowing them down with a big gulp of coffee, which was so hot that it burned a raw path down his throat as he swallowed it. Tony didn't care, though. At least it helped remind him that he was still alive.
"That charge was just the excuse you people used to get me," Steve said, his injured ribs protesting his vehemence. "Now, what the hell do you want?"
“No point,” Tony replies without looking up.  “You're hurt, and I’m not.  It’s kind of a no-brainer.”
"Are you sure you can promise the boy's confidence?" Fury asked. "No offence, but Peter doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to secrets."
"They have disappeared!" cried Mantis as she pointed a shaking finger towards the pile of debris where Nebula had been sitting, the imprints from her boots still visible in the thick red dust. "All three of them have disappeared!"
“Yeah.”  Releasing Steve’s hand, Tony stepped back, giving Steve a final once-over.  “Well, I gotta say,
that I'm not going to allow you or Peter to become slaves to the government, or whatever else they're planning on doing with this!" Papa protested as he got to his feet, taking Dad by the elbow. "Tony, I can't do it, you know that I can't!"
was the stubborn one, how could he not see that Steve was only trying to protect him? "But, sweetheart, you're not genetically enhanced, so why would they—?"
Steve smiled, showing off the dimple that Tony was convinced could launch ships and start wars. "Thank you, sweetheart. I really appreciate it, and I know Bucky does too."
Now, though, it’s like all of the fears and anxieties that have been simmering right beneath the surface decided to bubble over and start ganging up on him.
Phillips huffed, his frown deepening. "All right. As a matter of fact I do know the kid you're talking about," he said. "His full name is Peter Stark."
"Wasn't it obvious?" Steve's words were slurred like he was drunk, his limbs deliciously heavy as Tony kissed his way back up Steve's abdomen and chest to his mouth. They laid there wrapped in each other's arms for what seemed like hours, just kissing languidly until their lips were swollen and Steve was achingly hard again.
“Oh, I can always use another bookmark,” said Peter as Steve led him over to the counter, where a rack of bookmarks stood next to the cash register.  All of them appeared to be handmade, embossed small pictures similar to the drawings on the front windows, with popular book quotes arching across the top and bottom.
They sat in a semi-comfortable silence until Papa's truck pulled up, with Dad jumping out of the passenger side almost before it came to a complete stop, a very worried look on his face.
"Well, good." Phillips groaned as he pushed himself up from his chair. "Now, get out of here and get back to work. I wanna be able to present the final satellite design to the General's War Advisor next week."
Besides that, Tony and Bruce had been on the verge of what Bruce was calling a pretty major breakthrough when they were getting ready to leave, and Steve hadn't wanted to interrupt him. It had been far too long since they'd had some good news.
Even after Tony's appeal for his heart surgery was denied for the third time, Peter still held out hope. And while Tony had no idea how in the hell he did it, he knew it was also the very reason why he had to continue fighting for him. Peter had the potential to literally change the world, and there was no one—
Hitler had had gas chambers, Khrushchev nuclear weapons, Sadaam Hussein biological agents, and now President Graham Cole… his own virtually unstoppable iron army.
"Well, let's hope so," Steve said as he unearthed some chicken thighs from the freezer, setting them onto his favourite cutting board before washing his hands. "We'll start with the tea first, and some breakfast for you, little guy, and then once the soup's done we'll bring him some of that. Sound good?"
"Jesus, Pete, how do you even know that?" demanded Tony. "I told you that you weren't allowed to watch that stuff."
Gwen smiled, sending a burst of warmth across Peter's chest. If he could only figure out some way to bottle his girl's radiant smile, he'd never have to worry about being cold ever again.
And it was similar for Tony as well, as Tony still insisted that no matter how sweaty or stinky Steve was, his skin always smelled of vanilla, which had always been one of Tony's favourite scents. That plus the fact that Peter's precious curls always smelled faintly of green apples and Steve was one happy family man, surrounded by his boys and their comforting, foody-type scents.
" Peter breathed as another shiver raced down his spine, more freezing cold than he'd ever felt before. "Does that mean I was—was I
followed directly by a nearly blinding overhead light and two sets of footsteps walking towards his cell, one heavy and one lighter.
"Why do you think I'm here?" Rhodey asked with a slight grin. "O'Brien's probably gonna call you tomorrow with the news, so you gotta promise me that you'll act surprised—"
"It's all gonna be over soon, right?" he said. "Soon as the mission's over we'll be able to get Pete fixed up, and then he'll be as good as new."
"Well, then it's a good thing that I asked for a gate to be installed at our new house," said Steve. "Hopefully that'll be enough to keep them out. I don't mind giving an interview or two when the time is right, but there's no need for anyone to bother us at our home."
But now all the progress that he and Tony had made with conquering their water demons was gone, and he was back to square one. And while Tony would tell him that being frozen in ice for the second time in his life would be enough to cause any man to be afraid of the water, Steve still couldn't bring himself to accept it.
"Yeah, yeah, I know," Papa said with a sigh. Peter watched as Dad led Papa towards the living room, setting him up on the couch with his casted foot propped up on a pillow, his sketchbook and the TV remote both within easy reach. A lump rose in Peter's throat as Papa watched Dad head back to his lab to finish his work on the upgraded defence drones, and he glanced at the clock, noting that he had about an hour before the baseball game was due to start.
But they’re no different.  And judging by how Shostakov is making a complete ass out of himself two lanes over, he obviously believes that the clock isn’t lying.
Huffing out a sharp breath, Steve tightens the heated towel draped across his shoulders and turns up the volume on his earbuds, hoping that if he blasts
"Hey, little guy," Steve said as he settled himself down on the spare chair. "I said I'd be back this afternoon, remember?"
Tony blinked, his fingers tightening around the handle of his mug as he stared at the older man’s face, trying to figure out if he was joking or not.
“Yep, that’s me,” Peter said as he took his card from Steve’s shaking hand and signed the credit receipt.  He was very much used to people reacting like that when they learned his name, and in his experience, it was best to just ignore it.  “And it was nice to meet you too, Steve.  I’ll definitely be coming back here soon.”
"My kid is a genius," Tony repeated for probably the eightieth time in the last thirty minutes. Aside from creating an entirely new user interface program and drawing all of the diagrams of the satellites and containment vessels from Tony's specs, Peter had also managed to calculate how long the current national palladium stores would last before they were depleted and had already written programs for the creation and testing of new elements that could possibly replace the palladium should the need arise.
You may have noticed that I’ve added a chapter 😉 My words got a bit away from me, as they often tend to do.  I hope that’s okay with everyone 😊
Peter decided to save it anyway, just in case, and had just clicked on the next file when he heard Papa's heavy footsteps in the hallway, heading towards his room. He quickly closed both laptop screens, grabbing his tablet just as Papa knocked on his slightly opened door.
"Nothing," Peter said quickly as his face flushed hot. "Just… I fell when I was waterskiing and sprained a couple of my fingers. It's nothing."
"Peter!" Gamora said sharply, elbowing Quill hard on the arm. "For once will you please just listen?"
But while Tony was able to fall asleep rather quickly once they climbed into bed, Steve found himself lying awake deep into the night, unable to calm his troubled mind. The day had been a welcome distraction from the self-imposed stress he'd been under lately, but now that it was over, all of it had come roaring back with a vengeance. His optimistic words aside, Steve was not only worried about Tony, who seemed even worse now than he'd been following the Battle of New York, but Peter as well. He and Tony were just so much alike, and it was like clockwork that whenever Tony was particularly stressed out, so was Peter. His perceptiveness never allowed him to not notice when one or both of his dads were struggling.
Carefully Steve leaned over him, brushing the mass of thick brown curls off his forehead before gently kissing him, the feel of Peter's slightly cool skin reassuring him that yes, he was in fact all right.
DUM-E gave a rather fearful warble in response, one that prompted Peter to give him a reassuring pat on his arm. "Aww, it's okay, boy," he said. "This isn't gonna hurt. Right, Dad?"
Peter breathed in as he looked at his two incredible dads, the dads who had literally gone back in time and battled several universes worth of aliens to ensure that he would be able to sit there, in that kitchen, wearing that comfy hooded sweatshirt that smelled like his girlfriend.
Plus, Steve loved how much Bucky adored Peter, especially given how instrumental Peter was in Bucky's recovery.
"Take your time, sweetie. I don't mind waiting," she said. As soon as the door was closed, Peter glanced up at his reflection in the mirror over the sink, his upper lip curling into a sneer at what he saw. Pale, greyish skin, nostrils all dry and irritated, massive padded bandage on the side of his neck, and his eyes all huge and sunken. At least he could see a bit better now that Ms Sharon had trimmed his hair for him. She had even helped him wash it afterwards during his shower. Peter knew Dad had always loved the smell of his shampoo, and he'd wanted to make sure to look extra nice for when he and Steve arrived.
A dry gust of wind suddenly blew across the desolate, dust-covered plain, sending a violent shiver down Tony's spine. Slightly lifting his head, he half-expected to next see a tumbleweed roll by, or whatever the hell happened to pass for a tumbleweed on that toxic wasteland where he now sat, home of the genocidal lunatic who had just stolen Tony's son right out of his arms.
"Tony, just… wait a second!" Steve cried, the fear in his voice gripping Tony's heart like a vise. "Are you
Tony lifted his head, trying to ignore the deep worry wrinkle between Steve's perfect eyebrows. "Oh, and you don't? Wait, don't—don't answer that."
"It does kinda look like those things, doesn't it?" Tony reached for Steve's hand, nudging the hologram up so they could step underneath it. "It's actually a drone, designed to be part of a complete tactical defence system. My ultimate plan is to create an entire fleet of these babies and station them at strategic points around both the Compound and the Tower. They'll have similar programming to the Iron Legion, so JARVIS'll be in charge, but you and I will have manual command functions too, just in case JARVIS somehow gets compromised."
Steve shook his head, unable to admit just how right Peter was. In fact, despite his dislike that Tony had taken to wearing his nanite armour case around the clock now, even to bed, Steve had unconsciously grabbed his own case while collecting his wallet and keys, placing it underneath his leather jacket in the hopes that Peter wouldn't notice.
Taking his seat, Tony scanned the various senators facing him from the oval-shaped table. Senator Davis sat to the right of the committee chairman, some old guy from Oklahoma who in Tony's experience seemed to be chairman in name only, always deferring to his colleagues whenever anything of actual importance was discussed. He picked up the pitcher of water in front of him, pouring both he and Steve a generous glass as Rhodey and several other high-ranking military officers took their seats in the rows behind them.
"I don't know," replied Bruce, so forlornly that Tony couldn't help but wince. Stepping through the hologram, he ruffled through his scattered piles of papers, pulling one out that was so creased and bent and covered in coffee stains that it was barely readable. "We're doing everything right, or at least from what I can tell. But we just can't seem to nail down this final variable, which means—"
Dad held onto Peter's elbow as they made their way to the truck, which was double-parked and blocking traffic as Peter crawled into the roomy backseat, laying down on his father's lap after Dad slid in next to him and covered him with a blanket. Papa looked back at them from the rearview mirror, what Dad always called his "worry wrinkle" on full display as he manoeuvered the truck back onto the street.
Tony's eyes flashed with guilt, only for a split-second before he was able to turn his face away, but it was still long enough for Steve to notice.
Peter nodded, pulling out the books he needed for his homework that evening. "So… then… this is what you're really wanting to do? Study at Oxford?"
"Well, too late," Tony stated. "And especially if you go and do dumb shit like that again. It's bad enough that you're up there five days out of seven, but still—"
But since Steve has no such reputation, and he knows that Ma is watching him right now from her hospital bed, he picks up his warm-up suit, walks right up to Shostakov, and offers him his hand, ignoring the downright evil gleam in the Russian’s eye as he takes it.
"No, no no!" Steve exclaimed as he felt the all-too-familiar tug behind his naval, indicating he was about to be yanked out of the tunnel. "No, please! Not yet!"
Ms Sharon frowned as she pressed her stethoscope to Peter's chest. "You really need your rest, sweetie. Your lungs are sounding pretty waterlogged at the moment, and I know your dads wouldn't want you to—"
"Ohh, Captain Rogers!" he said breathlessly. "Please, sir, feel free to come in and join us! I'm sure you would have some incredible first-hand input into these events that we're discussing!"
Tony buried his nose into Steve's hair, gripping him so tightly he was shocked that he hadn't yet torn his uniform. "Steve, you can't keep trying to lock all this stuff down and forget about it, okay? Believe me, that's exactly what I tried to do before Pete came along, and it almost killed me."
But Tony only shook his head. There was no way he could sleep with the way his mind was swirling, and especially not with Peter whimpering like he was being beaten every couple of minutes.
"Gwen's fine, little guy," said Papa. "She and her family are safe at the Compound—I mean, the Tower."
Dr Strange threw up his hands, rolling his eyes. "Well, that's just great. So now the very thing that I didn't want to happen is going to happen."
Tony thought as he slid his key into the lock, wincing as he heard it click open. Rhodey had told him that he was free to use the cadets' locker room as often as he wanted, and even assigned him a locker to store his toiletries. The only thing that he said he wouldn't do was wash Tony's laundry for him, even though, as Tony so helpfully pointed out, he used to do it for him during their time at university together.
So he pushed his feelings aside, filing them in his mental compartment titled "Later", and kept his focus purely on Tony. Bathing him, dressing him, cajoling him to eat and then feeding him when he flat-out refused to eat on his own, Steve cared for his husband as though he were an invalid, because in many ways, he was. His overwhelming grief for Peter had him locked so tightly in its iron cage that not even Steve, with all of his serum-induced strength, could manage to break through.
"Yeah, it does. Be kinda nice if it stopped though, if only for a little while," Papa said with a sad smile. He twirled the wedding ring on his finger, a replacement Dad had made for the one that HYDRA stole from him. "What about you, little guy? Was your night okay last night?"
Or at least it would be if the good guys managed to win, which at the moment didn't quite seem like a given.
"Well, it's about goddamn time!" he heard Tony say not even a second later as he flew past the Suburban. "Waiting to make a dramatic entrance, I see? How typical!"
"The rest of the time it's just frustrating," Steve answered matter-of-factly. "And I just try and deal with it, just like any other husband or parent would." He looked down at Tony's hand, tracing his wedding ring with his thumb as his blue eyes filled with tears. "But we need to figure out what to do about this, 'cause we can't let Peter do that again, Tony, we just can't, and it's not just because we can't let him be Spider-Man while he's still a child. I'm afraid—I'm afraid if something like what happened happens again, that we won't be able to get him back. That we'll lose him, and—"
“Oh, come off it, Tony!” Obie snapped.  “You know what those damn tabloids say when you show up to those kinda things alone!  It’s not a good look for the company!”
"No, I guess not," Steve murmured as he pulled on his jeans, tucking in his blue button-down shirt that was one of Tony's favourites. "I guess Sam and Bucky's shower didn't last quite as long as ours."
It was as if Tony was convinced that he deserved nothing more than to waste away into nothingness, causing Steve to grow more and more desperate. There was no way he could begin to work through his own feelings of loss without Tony's help, and yet, as another day passed with hardly any acknowledgement from his husband, Steve felt his hold on his own demons, the demons he'd tried to keep so carefully locked away, starting to loosen. At James and Natasha's suggestion—actually, more like Natasha's insistence—he began exercising again, hoping that an everyday morning run and a few rounds with some punching bags in the gym would help clear his head a little, maybe help beat his demons back into submission. It did work, in that it helped Steve feel a bit more like himself and forced him to regularly eat and drink. But to come home and find Tony sitting on the floor of Peter's room again, clutching their son's pillow to his chest and with the tray of food he had so carefully prepared for him completely untouched, was starting to wear on Steve, tugging him that much closer to his own breaking point.
Sam sniffed as he nodded. "Yeah. I can—I can do that. Thank you." He clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "Take it easy for awhile, okay, Cap? No sense in pushing yourself before you're ready."
“Well… it’s like this,” he says.  “I’ve already let two teams down when I had to quit the sports because of my asthma attacks, so… I guess I didn't wanna risk that happening again if swimming didn't work out.  I mean, my old soccer team never won another game after I had to leave, and my old tennis partner—”  He breaks off as Dad pats him on the back.  “I don’t want any more people relying on me to play if I can’t see it through.  Swimming’s an individual sport, so… if I end up having to quit because my lungs start acting stupid again, then nobody gets hurt except me.”
"And as I've said multiple times, being a vigilante is never cool," said Mr Stacy. "That… guy wearing a red and blue leotard and flying around Queens on ropes might've been able to do one decent thing, but he was also interfering with police business and is damn lucky that he hasn't inspired some other kids with too much time on their hands to do the same, or someone could really get hurt."
"Holy shit," Tony whispered, the tears he'd been trying to hold back finally breaking free. "You really think that someone would try to—"
"Finally!" Bucky said as he dropped his arm holding the handlamp. "My arm wasn't gonna last much longer!"
"It appears that we are, sir," JARVIS answered. "I am detecting no anomalies with either the nanite design or their structure."
“I’m positive,” answers Steve.  He replaces the armour between his teeth and leans back, bracing himself on his arms.  “On the count of three.”
But as exhausted as he was, once Peter set down his phone he found that he couldn't go to sleep, his mind still spinning. He had a strong feeling that something had happened during his dads' meeting down in D.C. that was only corroborating what he had found in that bill, and it both worried and annoyed him that Dad and Papa still thought him too young to share whatever it was.
The task that happened to be defending the Time Stone against the strongest creature in the entire universe.
"'Cause it's like I told you. They tried to do the same thing to me, only it didn't exactly work the way they thought it would," Peter said. "I'm… well… I guess you could say that I'm a bit different from most people, and so the words didn't affect me the same way. But one of my uncles, those words used to work on him. HYDRA had taken him and turned him into a cold-blooded killer, so once we found him my dad developed a piece of technology that was able to take the words out of his head. And now he's free of them, and so am I. And I know that my dad would be willing to do the same for you and your brother once we get out of here."
"Okay, well, how 'bout I make you a trade offer?" said Pepper. "I've been going back and forth about even bugging you about this, but since you called—"
"Um…" Bucky said a few heartbeats later, poking Steve in the arm. "In order to actually 'go', you kinda have to, you know,
"Well, it is called space, Captain Barnes, not vast quantities of stuff," replied Tony. "Now, JARVIS will alert you when it's time to release your trial satellites, so—"
"Steve," Natasha said as she came into the room. Steve had been holed up almost exclusively in Tony's lab since they'd been back, thinking that if he was surrounded by his husband's beloved equipment and bots it would help him stay more optimistic about his and Peter's safe return. So far it hadn't exactly worked like he'd hoped, but it was at least better than trying to sleep in his and Tony's bed by himself.
Steve nods as he takes another sip of his juice, nearly choking when it tries to go down the wrong pipe.
Oh, he could train with them, in their massive training arena up at the Compound where his family usually spent the weekends. He could practise all the manoeuvres that he'd been perfecting ever since his genetic mutations began expressing themselves, including using his homemade webbing and web shooters that had so impressed Dad that he'd started using a few of Peter's design techniques in some of the new tech he was building for the team, but he still couldn't call himself an Avenger.
"No, it's actually worse," Uncle Bruce whispered, rather conspiratorially. "Just don't tell Thor I said so, okay?"
"Okay, but if that is the case, then we really have no idea of what we'd be heading into," said Sam. "Without a clear view of the target, there's no way we'd know what kind of resistance they've got or even the size of the building. We could be heading straight into an ambush."
Tony hesitated, unsure as to just how much he should divulge at the moment. As a matter of fact, he did have several theories as to what HYDRA might have been working on, with each one being even scarier than the last.
"The drone will be able to fire no more than three times at that range before burning out," replied JARVIS. "If I had more time, perhaps I could—"
"Steve," Bruce suddenly said over the comm. "Helen and I are on our way, we're just a couple minutes out. Try and keep him as warm as possible until we get there, okay? Skin to skin contact would be best if you can do it."
“Yeah, would you mind telling our other guests that they can come in now?  I think we’ve all had enough of this asshole’s rants.  Oh, and tell Happy to accompany them, we don't want any further casualties on company property if we can avoid ‘em”
"Yeah, Steve," said John. "I'm thinking that after all this is done and we save the planet and all, you should owe me a round of golf."
Shuddering, Steve took a large gulp of the coffee, grimacing as the bitter, lukewarm liquid slid down his throat and into his empty stomach. Natasha had brought him some food a few hours ago and insisted that he eat it, even staying to watch him for a few minutes to ensure that he followed her orders. But while Steve had put everything else on pause since Tony got back, his metabolism hadn't yet seen fit to take a hiatus, and he knew he was going to have to get something else to eat soon or his chances of staying awake would soon drop to zero.
"Steve," Tony said once they were out of earshot, his heart lurching as he studied his husband's face, which was covered in dirt, sweat, and blood from various scratches and bruises.
"Yeah, I'm still here," Steve replied, way too calmly for Tony's rising panic level. "But it seems like I've lost JARVIS."
"I won't. I'm sorry," Steve whispered, just before capturing Tony's lips. It was a quick kiss, as they were both practically asleep on their feet, but it still was enough to send a burst of tingly warmth through Tony's exhausted body.
It was almost as though Phillips was being encouraged to do so, but why and by whom Tony had no idea. Rhodey was a possibility, but since his position within the Air Corps was rather precarious as well Tony highly doubted he would risk it further by bringing up the personal life of one of the Corps' civilian contractors to his boss, no matter how close he and Tony were.
Tony practically shrieked as Steve's index finger brushed across his prostate, sending spikes of hot pleasure shooting throughout his body. "Shit, baby, I'm already open enough! Just get inside me!"
"Oh, that's good," Tony said in a rush. For how much he hated the idea that most people saw his child as nothing more than a burden to society, at the moment it was probably much safer for Peter that way. The last thing Tony wanted was for Peter's vast intelligence to be somehow discovered and for him to be forced into governmental servitude, like Howard had allowed him to be.
"Because I was curious?" Steve said, just a hair shy of patronising. Being so hungry was sorely testing his patience. "I wasn't aware that Howard's son was involved in the test-flight program, so I was just wondering—"
Finally, after what seemed like hours, the screen flickered, displaying a perfectly clean document.  Peter quickly began to skim it over, realising only a few lines in that instead of it being his mother’s employee file, it was… something else.
"Sam, we need to figure out where these guys are coming from," Steve said as he stood back up, scanning the smoke- and debris-filled area. "There's gotta be some kind of centralised area that they're working from."
Peter shook his head as he grabbed onto Steve's shoulder, sliding slowly onto the bed. "No, he wasn't able to get away yesterday. But when he called me he said that his boss told him he'd make sure to get him out in time tonight."
"No, I am afraid not, son of Wil," said Thor. "Because as mere humans, you lack the capacity to wield them. No, I believe that only a being of immense power would be able to handle these stones."
"Who, me?" he said, shooting Tony a wink that was anything but innocent. "I have no idea what you mean."
"Yeah. And in the meantime, I want you to get some sleep, okay? Getting some rest should help keep your breathing more steady too."
"We'd have to kill Thanos first," Steve said softly. "As soon as he places the stone in the gauntlet, we'd have to kill him."
"Care to share your interesting thought?" Steve asked. "Does it involve the technology from Beck's proposal?"
Once Steve was settled, Tony reached his hand over Peter's head and wove his fingers through Steve's hair, telling him without words exactly what Steve needed to hear.
"Shh, kiddo," Uncle Bucky murmured as he patted Peter's back. He glanced furtively at the monitor, grimacing. "You gotta try and calm down, okay? We don't want Ms Sarah to hear us, right?"
"Eh, I'd say more like infamous, as it were," Cam said with a smirk. "Let's just say that we heard quite a bit about a certain person's looks, size, stamina—"
"But what if I don't wanna go anywhere?" Peter cried, immediately clapping his hands over his ears as he broke into a cold sweat. He tipped over sideways on the couch, curling into a tight ball and wishing he could just sink down into the cushions and disappear. His senses were already going bonkers since he hadn't slept the night before, and listening to his dads shouting at each other was only making it worse. "Why would you think that I'd want to be separated from either of you, isn't that exactly what the Nazis did? Ripped families apart? Why should we let the government rip ours apart when we can still fight back? Isn't that the very reason why they're trying this? 'Cause they're afraid we'll fight back? They just want to control us, that's all this is!"
“Yeah, till he sent me off to boarding school halfway across the world,” Tony snapped.  “I’ll see ya tomorrow, Obie.”
“Well… then I think it’s wonderful that your father encourages your love of reading so much,” said Steve.
"Peter, that's not being respectful," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "It doesn't matter how smart you are or how strong you've become, you're still a child—"
"Peter Stark," he barked at the hospital operator, not even attempting to be polite. Tony tapped his fingers impatiently on his desk while he waited, his eyes flicking up to the drawing of Mrs Bird and her three chicks as a mental portrait of Steve and Peter sitting together in his hospital room chatting as they sketched formed in his mind, almost against his will.
"That's fine, sweetheart," Steve said, just as softly. "And I hope—I really hope that you like it. I designed it myself."
Steve huffed, his grip tightening on Tony's arm. "I don't like it, Tony. If someone's managed to get their hands on those HYDRA artefacts, there'd be nothing from stopping them from turning them into weapons, or—or something even worse, and—"
They all loved him, and Steve knew that not a single one of them would hesitate to take care of both he and Tony if it ever became necessary.
"Yeah, I know, but I've already got somewhere else to be," Steve said. He bit down hard on his lip, his fingers tapping impatiently on his leg. He was in a good mood, and very eager to get to the hospital to see Peter since he hadn't been able to see him the day before. "Maybe tomorrow?"
Just like Steve and Tony, Bucky tended to blame himself, even when there was absolutely no reason to do so.
"Nah, it's okay. But hey, could you send me another one of those videos of your fish when you get home? I like 'em, they're really relaxing."
"I'm sorry it has to be this way, Maria," he said before turning and heading back down the walkway just as Tony let out another bloodcurdling scream.
Steve smiled, so widely that his dimple, which had been missing in action ever since before he left, finally reappeared.
“Yeah, Miss Potts, I’m gonna need you to rehire all the scientists from the old pharmaceutical division that Obie let go,” he said.  “Offer ‘em twenty percent higher than whatever they were making before, yeah?  I’d like them to get started as soon as possible.”
Peter drew in as deep a breath as he could before driving his elbow into the wall three times in rapid succession, forming a spider web of cracks across it as he tried to break a hole big enough for Chief Stacy to fit. He cried out in pain as massive wood splinters and razor-sharp pieces of drywall drove through all of his layers of clothing and into his skin, trying to maintain his grip on the wall with his sweaty fingertips as the monster let out yet another deafening roar.
"Well, it helps when you play a lot with someone who can run really fast," said Peter. "And I've even managed to tag him a few times."
"Okay, honey, okay," Tony murmured as Steve kissed down to his neck, latching onto his pulse point as his hand slipped under Tony's ass, pressing their hips together. "I've got you, babe. I've got you."
"Yes, it does," answered Steve. "Never thought I'd ever go through this again." He kept his eyes firmly on Peter as Ma directed Sam and Sharon to lift him into the capsule. The anteroom Sam had mentioned was already almost filled to capacity with Steve's Air Corps teammates, including the entire A-shift, B-shift, and most of the C- and D-shift pilots.
But other than his cell and this massive arena-like area, he had no idea what the rest of the bunker looked like, or how much resistance he'd be facing if he were to break free.
"Sounds good." Tony tilted his head up, pressing a lingering kiss to Steve's lips. "'Cause I got some pretty big plans for you tonight, babe."
Or, maybe not-so-secretly wishes, if Natasha’s pointed glances and particularly sharp pokes in his side whenever Tony laughs at one of his corny jokes are any indications.
"Right away, sir," said Rhodey, jerking his head towards Carol. He was a bit less excited than Tony would've expected too, but Tony quickly brushed it off. Everyone had been working their asses off for almost five days trying to keep two whole countries from falling into panic and bring Steve home at the same time. Tony could understand if they weren't running around leaping for joy.
"Love you, honey," Tony whispered into the empty lab. Then he sucked in a deep breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. He'd run out of coffee just before the first explosion hit, and it was far past the time for a refill.
"You thinking that something might've happened to him?" Tony asked as he sat down at his workstation. "I thought his dad was the king of Asgard or something."
"I am insulted that you could possibly believe that I could even make such a grievous mistake, sir," JARVIS said, with such petulance that a sharp pang of nostalgia shot through Tony. He could just picture the look of disgust on Edwin Jarvis's face as he said the exact same thing.
“Hello!” Peter said, grunting when his voice jumped an entire octave on the ‘o’.  He gave his head a quick shake, trying again.  “I mean, hi.  Um… no, thank you.  I’m just here to look around… if that’s okay?”
Steve was quiet as he and Tony made their way towards the elevator, their hands clasped tightly together. His entire body felt numb, the burst of energy he'd felt during his reentry and safe touchdown now completely gone, leaving him wishing for nothing more than to curl up in bed next to Tony and sleep for the next week or so.
Dad flinched, his arms tightening around Peter as he looked over at Dr Strange. "If anyone would know, it'd be him."
Steve’s confidence gets a slight boost when the announcer introduces him as the defending Olympic champion, enough for him to give a genuine smile as he waves to the crowd.
"Oh, nah, not too bad," said Steve. "Mainly just going on about how we're all supposed to be on our best behaviour tomorrow. Apparently our new class is being taught by a civilian liaison instead of one of our own."
"Okay, okay, we can work with this," Sam said. He took a sip of his coffee, his calm demeanour already easing Steve's frazzled nerves. "You said it was Peggy on the radio with you?"
"Can you roll over for me?" Steve asked, his beautiful face so flushed and eager that he could've asked Tony to bring him the moon on a platter and Tony would've scrambled to do so. He stole another quick kiss before turning onto his stomach, rutting lightly against the sheets as Steve grabbed a bottle of what looked like massage oil off his bedside table and poured some into his hand.
But there in that moment, standing face to face with a man he'd always despised but never thought as anything more than a bothersome troublemaker, Tony had to admit that there was no way he would've been able to hide the massive cauldron of emotions threatening to boil over. By aligning himself with HYDRA, Justin Hammer had literally sold his soul to the devil, and was therefore complicit in every single thing that HYDRA had done since Project Insight.
Whatever Phillips was going to say next was interrupted by the appearance of Carol's X-302 as it pulled into the hangar, followed closely on its tail by Steve. Tony had finished his simulator session with Major Lorne and Captain Wilson a bit earlier than usual that day, which meant that he was able to get back to the hangar in time to watch Steve disembark from his aircraft for the first time since they started dating two weeks ago.
Tony's brown eyes were glassy as he reached his left hand up to cover Steve's. "You know I can't. But, honey, what if we just end up screwing things up even more? What if we—?"
Aside from the whole getting dressed up part, and the reason for it, Peter still wasn't quite used to the fact that their new house even had a "guest bedroom", much less one that was almost twice the size of his old bedroom at Grandpa's house. Peter's bedroom in the new house was huge too, complete with its own bathroom and two full sets of windows since it sat on the back corner of the house. The master bedroom, which was the largest, sat on the opposite back corner, and was so spacious that when they first toured the house after Peter's release from the hospital, Dad joked that he was afraid he was going to get lost in it.
He impatiently tapped his fingers on the not-glass as he waited for her to return, trying not to itch at the healing cuts on his face and growing more and more anxious by the second until he saw her coming back towards him, a slim metal device in her hand that kinda looked like a pen.
"I don't think that'll be necessary, little guy," said Papa as he pulled into the Tower garage. "Gwen is a nice girl, and I'm sure the two of you will have a good time. Dad and I just want to make sure that you're both safe."
“We’re still trying to figure that out,” replied Fury.  “But it seems as though a few of the scientists that were brought on after World War II had some ties to the organisation that weren’t discovered in time.”
The team worked on the speeches for the entire practise, much to Peter's surprise given Liz's propensity for the rapid-fire questions. His speech on the hidden cons of fabric softener went over quite well with the team and managed to absolutely stump Mr Harrington, as did Gwen's speech on solar power vs wind power and Ned's on the scientific difference between a malt and a milkshake.
"I'm not sure how much longer we can stand by!" Steve shrieked. A second later he heard the loud rev of a motorcycle, with Natasha and Clint appearing on the street about a half a kilometre away. Increasing her speed, Natasha jumped the barrier of thick bushes surrounding that side of the lake, skidding to a halt as she landed.
"Pretty sure Петр's anxious to get home too," added Bucky. "Think he misses that girl of his. He was up pretty late last night talking to her."
"Yes, it is," Thor said as he sat up straighter. "I've recently experienced a vision, one that I believe to be prophetic in nature." He went on to explain in detail the same vision he had described to the rest of the team before their departure, during which T'Challa listened intently.
Tony exclaimed. His fingers wrapped around his left forearm, squeezing hard. "You told him you knew who he was? What, are you talking in some kind of a teenage code or something?"
Natasha nodded, giving him such a hopeful smile that Steve's heart lurched. "Copy that. Bruce said he and Rhodey can have it up here in a few hours."
"Стив?" Uncle Bucky said as he raised his shiny black rifle. The Chitauri speeders and scaly whales were still circling around Thanos and his aliens, finally coming to hover behind them as Thanos let out a wide, leering grin. "What do we do?"
That prompted Steve to lift his head, and he cupped Tony's cheek in his palm, brushing his thumb across his cheekbone. "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he whispered. "I'm so sorry. For everything."
He was just never going to allow Peter to leave the Tower ever again, once they managed to make it home. It really was that simple.
"I'm sure they won't mind waiting till the drones are done upgrading, especially if it cuts down on the search radius." Bruce paused, giving Tony a sympathetic look. "Steve's pretty tough, Tony, so you know he's not gonna go down without a fight. And he knows we'd never give up on him either, 'cause there's no way in hell he'd give up on any of us."
"Nah, I can join you guys," he said. He'd noticed it was raining out anyway, so not the best weather to be driving in on a motorcycle. "I'm already busy tomorrow though."
Steve whimpered as someone took his left hand, plucking out bits of fabric from his damaged skin with a set of sharp forceps.
Tapping the case twice with his fingertips, Tony stood perfectly still as the nanites emerged, easing across his chest and down his arms like hot syrup spreading over a stack of Steve's homemade pancakes. They were warm, with just the slightest of tingling sensations as they formed Tony's helmet and facemask, finally closing over his fingers and toes. Once he was fully encased, he looked down, giving his feet an experimental wiggle. From what he could tell, everything looked good.
He looked positively debauched, and Tony was convinced there was not a more glorious sight in all the universe.
"And he did, Tony," said Steve. "Sam told me downstairs, when you were still getting dressed that just about everyone in Langara already knows what Peter did. That he literally saved not only me, but our entire planet. Apparently it's been on the news, now that the news people can actually report the real news, so… Peter's a hero, sweetheart. And everyone knows it."
Carefully, Steve hefted Peter off the bed, letting him test his wobbly legs a bit before releasing him to walk to the bathroom with Tony's help. At least they didn't have to worry about Peter losing as much of his muscle mass this time around since he was only asleep for a few days instead of several weeks. That would hopefully help both he and Steve recover a bit faster.
Since Tony wasn't as fond of pancakes as Steve and Peter were, Steve instead made him an omelet, complete with sharp cheddar cheese, green peppers, and tomatoes. Tony had told Steve when they first started dating that the Stark's old butler, Mr Jarvis, had often been responsible for preparing Tony's meals when he was a child, and that omelet had been one of Tony's absolute favourites.
"Seems like those Meridians aren't liking what we're hitting 'em with up here," said Mitchell. "How long do you think it'll be before we see some of their new hardware?"
"Uh huh," Peter said, his eyelids already heavy. He blinked them open again, forcing himself to focus on Dad's face. "Um… I need to ask you guys something else, it doesn't have anything to do with… well, anything, but—"
"Okay, but honey, just listen for a second, yeah? Yes, we are stopping him. We have been stopping him. But we're nowhere near to actually getting
"Yeah," Quill cut in. "I know you think you're probably pretty strong and all, but there's no way we can just wrestle him down and take the gauntlet. It'll just never work."
"Just be prepared for some dirty looks if people see you with him, Stevie," Bucky said. "I know Anthony Stark isn't his father, but not everyone's gonna see it that way. There's a lot of prejudice floating around out there."
"Hmm. You look like someone cut the ends off your shoelaces," he said. "Something happen on your run?"
"It's okay, baby," Tony managed. He tilted his head to capture Steve's lips, plunging his tongue into Steve's mouth just as one of Steve's hands wrapped around his cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts. "'M close too, I can't—"
Shaking his head, Tony chanced a glance up at Steve. The tall, broad pilot was still standing in the middle of the room, his expression so forlorn he could've given Peter's best puppy-dog eyes a run for their money.
"Like Steve said, we found it in the street a few days ago," said James. "But you still haven't answered how you managed to get in here—"
"Congratulations, Tony. Well done," Phillips said softly, a slight smile stretching across his thin lips. He was a bit less jovial than Tony would've expected, but Tony supposed it didn't really matter. Phillips had been working almost nonstop since everything began as well, so the old man was probably just exhausted.
"Damn." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, cursing the three tons of intense fatigue that had taken up residence across his shoulders, fatigue that hadn't budged since HYDRA ripped Steve away from him.
"Uh huh," Peter said as his mask closed over his head. He quickly shot out a web, swinging into position almost directly above Dr Strange. "I'm ready, Dad."
"And neither are you, from what I've seen," Gwen said gently. "It's understandable to miss your father when he's away."
"Yes, I am," answered Peter. "I know my papa, and I know that he doesn't think of himself as above the law. Not in any country. The Avengers aren't vigilantes, they're just… extra equipped to take on certain threats. And by doing that, they help keep everyone else safer. Just like the police force."
As soon as Gwen clicked off Peter flopped back onto the bed, eyeing the two laptops stacked on his bedside table. He had been debating for most of the day on whether or not to tell Dad about the HYDRA files, trying to decide if it would actually do any good or just make Dad even more stressed. The guilt was eating away at him so badly that it was almost crippling, but Peter knew he had no right to be selfish at the moment.
"Helen's scheduled another set of x-rays for your hands day after tomorrow, buddy," Dad said quietly once they were all settled on the couch, with Peter in his usual spot between his dads and Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam on the loveseat opposite them. "And once the splints are off, I'm gonna need your help with some stuff in the lab, okay? I was gonna wait on it until we got back to the city, but now…"
Steve grunted, patting Peter once on the back. "Peter, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Have a good night."
Steve's arms tightened even more around him as he sucked a mark into the top of Tony's shoulder, soothing it with his tongue. "On our bed, mo grá, where I can lay you out in front of me and touch as much of you as possible."
But then tears filled his eyes, and he slumped down so low in the chair that he almost slid completely off.
And the fact that Tony remembers something like that is enough to bring a slight smile to Steve’s face.
“That’s ‘cause you're amazing,” Steve said just before bringing their lips together.  As he deepened the kiss, Steve shifted so Tony was lying on top of him, straddling his waist.  Then he took hold of Tony’s hips and rocked up to meet them, Tony’s answering gasp sending a bolt of pleasure straight to his crotch.  “God, Tony, you’re just so fucking gorgeous.  I want you so badly, and—”
"I will take what you said under advisement, which is all I can promise you at the moment," T'Challa finally said. He got to his feet, followed by Steve and the rest of the team. "Now, if you will excuse me, I must make arrangements to return my father's remains to our home—"
"It is a stupid amount of work," Peter murmured, his pencil flipping around his thumb. "Which is why—"
"Nuh uh. Don't you be trying to give me excuses, buddy, I know you too well," Dad cut in. "You keep telling yourself that it's just one more file, but then it'll be just one more, and then just one more, and so on, and so on, and—" He paused, letting out a sort of morbid chuckle. "Can't say that I don't know where you get that particular trait from, but… it's probably not the best thing when it's a school night, don't ya think?"
could tolerate going that slow either. After a year spent making love only to his fist, Steve wasn't about to waste anymore time.
"So, I heard that you kicked your Uncle Sam's ass again at chess today, hmm?" Tony said as he brushed the curls out of Peter's eyes, trying to keep his expression as neutral as possible.
"Are you all right?" Steve asked between his panting breaths as Tony came up next to him, automatically reaching for his right hand.
Anger flashed through Peter like lightning, and he fought against the urge to scowl, very much aware of Gwen's eyes shooting darts of mortification and apology.
Peter was so lost in his morbid thoughts that he completely forgot about watching the clock, nearly jumping out of his skin when the bell rang to end the period. He packed up his computer and books with shaking hands, kicking himself for not paying closer attention.
"Let's get you in the tub, bud," Tony said. "The eau de teenage boy you're emanating is a bit strong at the moment."
"Uncle Thor!" Steve suddenly heard from behind him, just before Peter launched himself into Thor's arms, all skinny arms and legs as Thor lifted him up from the ground, laughing.
"That's my sensitive man," Tony whispered as he did it again, pulling a choked moan from Steve's throat. "You like that, don't you baby?"
Before Tony could say anything else, Steve slipped his fingers under his chin, tilting his head up and capturing his lips. Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck as his tongue swiped across Tony's bottom lip, asking for permission like the gentleman he always was. He whimpered as Steve's tongue plundered his mouth, teasing and tasting as one hand slipped underneath Tony's t-shirt, his blunt fingernails scraping lightly up his back.
"Someone outside the company?" Tony asked. He curled his fingers around his left arm, squeezing against the tingling pain.
"I've already got it, Tones," Rhodey said as Sam took out yet another Chitauri warrior, sending him careening into the outer hull of the ship. "Target is locked, waiting on your mark."
"You think so, do ya?" he asked, lifting his head to stare into his husband's eyes, so bright blue—with just the lightest touch of green—in the late-morning sun that they almost didn't seem real. The very same sun that was filtering through Steve's blond hair, giving him an almost halo-like effect.
He cuts off as Tony’s eyes crinkle, and he lets out an amused chuckle.  “You mean, back in your day, eh, Cap?”
Tony shot him a scowl, which was so exactly like one of Peter's scowls that Steve almost laughed. "And I told you that you were being ridiculous," he said. "Pete's not gonna think that you're weak, that's just a bunch of macho military nonsense. All he wants is to see his Papa."
And why wasn't there a term for it? There was a term—widower or widow—for the loss of a spouse, so why not for the loss of a child?
Papa’s eyebrows knitted together as he buried his long fingers into his hair.  “But that’s almost exactly what I told them!  I told them I needed to get away from there and try to forget about all of it!”
"Nah, Птер would know better than to give any clues about his location," Bucky said from his perch on the arm of the couch. "If I were him I'd just hitch a ride on a truck or something. There's gotta be tons of 'em out there on the highways during the night."
"Yeah, me too," Tony said softly. He smiled then, his beautiful brown eyes flicking to the white star on the middle of Steve's chest. "So? You can't leave me hanging like this, honey! What'd you think?"
"Dad!" Peter called, straining as the alien struggled to get to his feet, his giant pickaxe flailing.
"Hopefully not just once," Tony said as he curled his hands around Steve's shoulders, tugging him down so he could kiss him, his need to get Steve out of his clothes nearly all-consuming. As Steve's lips kissed across his neck and down to his collarbones, Tony slipped his hands underneath Steve's tight blue t-shirt, making a thoroughly embarrassing noise as his fingers found Steve's skin.
Dad opened his mouth to protest, but whatever he was going to say died as soon as he looked at Steve. "All right, fine. But you better warn her that Howard's a pretty mean drunk and that he doesn't like strangers, so—"
“No, no, you're fine,” answers Tony.  “I’m just—since JARVIS isn't here, I’ve gotta—I’m calculating the amount of force I’m gonna have to use, and… well… I just wanna make sure I don't screw up the math.”
?" he asked, almost afraid of the answer. It wasn't as though Steve hadn't ever done just that, and on more than one occasion.
"Yeah, I suppose the last thing that we need right now is for Loki to throw another tantrum," Dad said, handing Uncle Thor his newly built eye. "Try that on for size."
Warmth burst across Tony's chest at Steve's words, spreading down his arms and legs. He may not have been able to understand Steve's attraction to him, but that didn't mean he wasn't grateful for it.
"Godddamnit," Tony whispered. He had never been great at staying angry at Peter, and this apparently was no exception. Shaking his head, he stepped forward, placing both hands on his son's shoulders and vaguely aware that the maroon cloak was still following him around like a lost puppy. "Good grief, buddy. Don't you think for one second that I blame you for any of this. But you were supposed to go home, not follow me here, and now there's no way to let Papa know that you're okay."
"No, I don't think it's quite that either," Gwen said with a huff. "It's more like… I'm not sure he knows what to think, actually. On the one hand, he's just a normal guy, a police officer in charge of trying to keep the Midtown precinct a safe place, and he's really good at what he does. His officers are loyal, they never have anything but good things to say about him, and his percentage of cops that turn dirty is the lowest in the entire state and has been for years." She paused, tapping her fingers on her lunch tray. "I think part of it is that he's envious. 'Cause I mean, he is just a normal police chief running a precinct that also houses the Avengers—"
Tony had never been able to look at Howard that way. Not that Howard ever seemed to have given a rat's ass, but Peter… Tony was absolutely certain that he would shrivel up and die right there on the spot if he ever saw even a glimmer of the abject disdain in Peter's eyes that he'd regularly thrown Howard's way.
The walk to the infirmary passed in a haze of pain and nausea, and before Steve knew it, Bruce was pushing him down onto a gurney and taking hold of his right forearm, shaking his head as he examined the bloody, swollen mess that was his hand and fingers.
Instead, he'd felt as though he'd been broadsided. Shot with a missile from his left flank at point-blank range with absolutely no warning.
Except, as the days went by, even Steve had to start to admit that he wasn’t.  Because not only did the bad dreams continue, they grew even more graphic, more terrifying.  Instead of seeing Morita’s bloodied and broken body lying in that rubble, he would see Tony’s, his beautiful eyes completely lifeless as Steve sobbed over him, begging him to come back to him.  And Peter, sweet, loving Peter, who tried so hard to keep Steve’s mood as uplifted as possible, it was his blood-stained and dust-covered hands who kept reaching for Steve’s from underneath the mountains of rubble, begging him to help him find his father.
"Yes, yes, I was just getting to that, Mr Stark," Davis retorted, shooting Tony a scowl that if looks could have killed, would've splattered him all over their table. "So, if you don't mind, Captain, can you please give us just a brief synopsis as to what happened after you and Colonel Rhodes recovered the Starks in Afghanistan?"
“You good there, hon?” Dad asked as he started attaching the various leads to Papa’s forehead and chest that would keep track of Papa’s vital signs.  “You need a blanket or a pillow or something?”
"Okay… so… um… why're they having interviews for the summer already when it's still October?" he asked. "Isn't that kinda early?"
After helping Steve brush his teeth, they both crawled under the covers, Steve's chest pressed up against Tony's back.
"Better?" Tony asked once they were cuddled up in bed, his head resting in its usual spot on Steve's chest. He noticed that Tony felt a bit warmer than usual, but it was so slight that he brushed it off as either his imagination or as a result of the litre of coffee Tony had consumed since dinner time.
"Steve!" Tony shrieked as he lunged towards the hole. He plunged his armoured hand down into the icy water, grabbing onto the first part of Steve that he could reach, which happened to be his shoulder, and yanked him up and out, barely managing to get his entire body onto the surface before the hole started to close.
"Steve, you're still here?" she said in surprise as she set Peter's food down on the rolling table and reached for her stethoscope, placing the bell against Peter's chest. "I thought I had just missed you leaving."
"And if I'm right, which I always am," he said. "Then it'll not only be able to help you, but Pete and Bucky as well."
Tony nodded, his plush bottom lip caught between his teeth as he tugged Steve's head back down for a fierce, hard kiss.
"We need to know what we're up against, Tony, you know that," he answered, gripping his pencil as he frowned at the television. "And I'm tired of always being three steps behind the enemy. It's time that I quit slacking."
"I'm not really expecting you to say anything, Captain," Gwen said, as if she had read Steve's mind. "I guess I just thought that you might like to know what happened."
"Well… we thought we could keep it to five friends each for the twins, plus their families… I'm thinking it would be around sixty people total? So around seventy including the rest of us."
Tony's head had snapped up at the words, "old drug," and his eyes narrowed, studying the image in front of him. The only "old drug" he knew of that could possibly help someone interface with a holographic system was the CTX-616, but Tony had ordered all of it destroyed after the team had discovered that Obie had administered it to Peter in Afghanistan so he could wipe his mind while the Ten Rings experimented on him.
"I'd like to practise giving the unprepared speeches today," Liz continued, earning a chorus of groans from the rest of the team. "Cindy, you'll go first."
"I'm losing him!" Mantis cried as Thanos' bared his teeth, his clouded-over eyes narrowing at Gamora's twitching body.
"Thank you," Steve said as he leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to Peter's forehead. "I'll just be gone for a bit, okay, little guy? I promise it won't be too long."
"Tony," Steve gasped into his mouth, his arms tightening around him as he flipped around to lay Tony down on the bed, pulling off his shoes before crawling up to hover over him. "Tony, I—"
"Just a kid I met at the hospital," said Steve. "From what he tells me he's got a pretty messed-up heart, one that should've been fixed a long time ago, and I just thought—"
"Look, Gwen," Peter said as he placed his hands on her waist. "I am so, so sorry. I know I've been a jerk to you sometimes, and it's even more jerky to just leave you like this, but I really, really gotta get going right now or this whole thing is gonna be shot to hell, so—"
—even after all that time only proved that O'Brien had been an absolute fool for grounding him in the first place.
Peter rolled his eyes in such a perfect imitation of Tony that if Tony hadn’t been so goddamn tired—or called out—he would’ve laughed.
Thor grimaced. "Ah yes, that wretched animal. Loves to leave her treats, as Valkyrie calls them, right on the front steps of my home in New Asgard, but… there is no one I would trust more to lead our army. I only ask… while you were observing in the tunnel, you did not happen to see Loki there amongst the warriors, did you?"
And even besides all of that, having Steve standing there next to him while he laid out all of the evidence that he, Rhodey, and Peter had so painstakingly gathered would no doubt give Tony the courage he needed to actually see it through.
Peter grunted, giving his head another hard shake. And he used to think that Uncle Thor liked to talk in riddles.
"That's always been HYDRA's goal," Steve said quietly. "You heard Zola in that recording, he came right out and said that they wanted to take humanity's freedoms and replace them with chaos, and chaos always induces fear."
Tossing his used towel into the bin by the door, Tony exited the locker room, one hand holding up the loose waistband of his pants and his eyes trained on the floor as he ran through his latest set of calculations through his head, searching for any possible errors that he would need to correct before the pilots had their first jaunt up in the X-302s the following day. Tony had asked Phillips for an extra day so he could triple-check everything but as usual his request had been denied by the leadership, saying that no delay would be tolerated unless it was due to an unavoidable equipment failure.
"And besides, it's only gonna be temporary anyway," added Peter. He flipped open his notebook, showing Uncle Bucky the design for his prosthesis. "My dad's gonna build this for you once Project Phoenix is over."
Tony scoffed, fighting against the almost overwhelming urge to scream. He was so exhausted that he was starting to smell colours, but despite Rhodey, Carol, Sam, and even Phillips himself telling him to take a break—"just fifteen minutes, Tony, please?"—there was no way in hell that he could possibly relax enough to rest.
"I will indeed." Uncle Thor gave a nod, looking around at the various team members all standing around him. "My friends, until we meet again, I bid you all farewell."
Unable to speak, Tony simply nodded.  He had no earthly idea how Steve could know everything was going to be okay, but he did at least appreciate the sentiment.
Gathering up his coffee cup and tablet, Tony exited the room, nearly knocking directly into Pepper as she came around the corner.
"'Cause I knew it would just get you upset," Peter replied. "And you've already got enough stress at work without adding more to it. Especially since it's not even a big deal."
He'd even gone so far as to tell Peter that he was in love with Tony, something he hadn't even managed to say to Tony yet.
"Stand by!" Steve sharply whispered, watching through narrowed eyes as Thanos carefully moved the stone over to the gauntlet, dropping it down into its awaiting slot. Almost immediately, his entire body seized, the bellowing cry he let out as the combined power of the six stones surged through him just as jarring to Steve as it had been the first time.
They ended up driving through Uncle Bucky's favourite burger place, the one that had the milkshakes that were so thick you had to eat them with a spoon. Uncle James disappeared into his room for more conference calls as soon as they were done eating, and Peter and Uncle Bucky were just about to start a game of chess when JARVIS announced that Dad and Papa were on the line.
"When can I see you again?" Steve rasped as he pressed his forehead to Tony's. "Tomorrow night? Please?"
up from the ashes of its own captivity so it can be reborn. Because I am taking a stand, right here, right now, to say
"Yeah, I already know that, Dad," Peter said, rather smugly. "So, with the vibranium powering the arc reactors the satellites would pretty much be able to run forever as long as they were in standby mode most of the time, which they would be if we were only gonna use them as a weapons system. But since we're not, then we're gonna need…" He paused, turning to a page in his notebook where he had drawn a perfect rendition of the very cube that lay at the centre of all the controversy surrounding Howard Stark.
Tony leaned his head against the doorframe, carefully shining the handlamp across Peter's skinny chest as he watched it slowly rise and fall with each of his laboured breaths, the slight
Steve shifted slightly on his feet, hooking his thumbs into his belt loops.  “You know, I could tell that the moment you walked in,” he said.  “There've been quite a few people who have come in just to poke around a bit, probably out of curiosity more than anything, but I could tell you weren't one of those people.  There's a certain look in someone’s eyes who truly loves books, and, well… I could see that in you.”
"Nice flying there, Tony," said Sam. "Barton, you, Nat and Bucky coordinate with Stacy's team to take out the rest of the personnel inside the prison. Once they're all secured, you guys find Steve and Peter and then get the hell outta there."
"All right, Tony, all right," Steve said. He let out a heavy sigh, pressing another kiss to his temple. "Then we'll both go, okay?"
"All right," Tony said as he circled the hologram. "Now show me the areas that are in the targeting range of the current drone system."
He was just getting started on his closing procedures when Tony walked through the door, looking absolutely exhausted.
"Well, we might beg to differ on that one," Clint piped up from behind Natasha, placing his hand on Wanda's shoulder. "Wanda here is pretty damn powerful, and I bet if she put her mind to it, she could at least put a couple of dents in the thing."
"Uh huh," Peter said as he checked the wall clock. "It should hopefully be starting in about ten minutes or so."
Now, he can barely stand the sight or smell of it.  Can barely stand the sound of ice cubes as they slide against each other in the tray inside his freezer, or in the big cups of Coca Cola that he and Peter like to get whenever Steve picks him up from school.
"We could bring them all home," Steve said as tears welled in his eyes. "Sam, and Bucky, and Wanda, and—and—"
Steve's dimple grew even deeper. "Oh, yeah?" he said, rather cheekily. "Well, then, Mr Stark, what would you say to becoming my fella? Is that a prospect that you might consider?"
"One! Freight car!" finished Sam and the colonel. Both Bucky and Winter Soldier froze as soon as the final word left their mouths, and an eerie silence fell across the room as the colonel leaned closer to Winter Soldier, almost as though he was scanning him.
"Then he should be scared!" Tony screamed, so loudly that his own ears started to ring. Steve immediately froze, his lips clamped together and his eyes squeezed tightly closed. It was a testament to his stubbornness that his grip on Tony didn't lessen in the slightest, even as Tony knew he would've liked nothing more than to shove Tony away from him. Steve absolutely hated any kind of shouting or screaming, not only because it hurt his serum-sensitive ears, but because it also reminded him way too much of being in battle.
"Nope, don't think so." He slid his hand down Steve's back to his ass and gave it a playful squeeze, smirking when Steve let out a soft growl. "You're a good man, Steve Rogers," he said. "And as soon as I can manage to kick you out of here to go make us dinner, I'm gonna call Pepper and tell her that we'll all be unavailable for that week."
A sudden knot rose in Tony's throat, and he gave a slight cough, trying to clear it. If Steve only knew a fraction of how worried he had been, how scared he'd been that he might never see him again…
"Oh my God, are you okay?" Gwen exclaimed as she rushed closer, a pile of books in her arms and her pretty eyes wide with shock. Peter immediately nodded, leaning against the bank of lockers as he gingerly palmed the sore spot on his head, his heart thudding madly.
"I would concur, Your Highness, based on what we saw in New York," added Steve. "I think we're gonna be in for quite a fight."
Tony huffed in frustration, pressing his palm to his chest as he resumed his pacing. "Can you double-check the location for me, J?"
And the best part was, neither did Tony. Even with all of Tony's previous experiences and partners, he never failed to tell Steve that he was the best he'd ever had, and every action that followed only proved his words multiple times over.
But then Peter came along, and although Tony had been tempted more than a few times over the years, he hadn't touched a drop of the stuff since then.
Tipping his head back, Peter sucked in the slowest, deepest breath that he could, pressing his palm over his heart that was racing so fast he was surprised that it hadn't just decided to explode and be done with it.
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve unzips his dark blue Team USA-issued sweatsuit jacket and slips out of his matching pants, draping them neatly over the back of the chair behind him.  From the corner of his eye, he sees Schmidt doing the same, frowning slightly as the charismatic German blows a final kiss at the stands before mounting his starting block.
"No, no, six hours is fine." That would put it right around the time that he'd be back in his room for bedtime anyway. "Can you get started right away? Please?"
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve said on a gasp as Tony did it again, a rather self-satisfied smile on his kiss-swollen lips. "I can't—I can't… feels too good…"
Tony wasn't sure how long he had laid there—his forehead pressed into the desk and his glasses splattered with drying teardrops—when he was startled upright by a loud knock on the door. He snapped his head up, wincing at the pain in his wrenched neck as he hurriedly scrubbed the tear tracks from his cheeks.
Bucky grinned, firing a bullet directly between the alien's eyes. "Copy that." Less than a second later the four Chitauri were laid out on the plain, and Bucky was already reloading.
series.  He crouched down, intending to just glance past them, when one box in particular caught his eye.
Setting down his notebook and pencil, Peter lay back against his pillows, briefly closing his eyes. He was getting so tired lately from just the tiniest things. Even drawing, something that he used to be able to do all day back when he was first admitted, was starting to wear him out. Just in the last week or so he'd gotten to the point where he had to take a break about every ten to fifteen minutes, making it that much harder to actually get anything done.
Steve’s cheeks immediately flush hot, and he softly grunts, hoping like hell that Thor and Clint don't notice.   It can’t be a coincidence that Tony used that particular word.  Ever since Natasha pointed out to Steve that Tony tended to slip into older vernacular whenever he was around, Steve’s awareness radar has been working overtime on catching it.
Hesitating only for a second, Steve quickly laid out Tony's plan, assuring the king that they had absolutely no intentions of keeping the Soul Stone once it was located.
“It sure is, little guy, Steve said as he hugged Peter close.  Because it was.  Against all odds, Steve had not only managed to survive being frozen,
Especially the government, who as soon as Peter's prognosis was made official, proceeded to demand so much work from Tony it was as if he were in some kind of sick and twisted study on how far you could push another human being before they completely cracked, right down the middle.
“No, goddamnit!” Tony cries.  “For Christ’s sake, Steve, can’t you just leave me the hell alone?  I’m trying to work here!”
In all of his wildest dreams, he'd never actually thought it was possible that the bill might not pass. A high-pitched squeak worked its way from his throat as he attempted to swallow, his disbelieving eyes still staring at the television.
As soon as the screen went blank, Peter glanced towards his slightly-cracked door and reopened the document he’d been going over.  He still wasn't sure if he should feel horror or vindication that he had correctly guessed why Dad was being so twitchy about everything, but he supposed it didn't really matter.
Setting down his StarkPad, Tony rubbed at his temples, trying to stave off the headache that persisted in taunting him. Steve had gone over to the residence about twenty minutes ago to make them some food, and while Tony wasn't hungry in the slightest, he knew that if he didn't eat, Steve would try and cut off his coffee intake, and that was simply unacceptable.
“Because we have orders for those rifles, Tony!” Obie exclaimed.  “Orders placed via the military contracts that pay all the goddamn bills around here, in case you've forgotten!”
As it was, he very much hoped that Maria had been successful in getting Tony to sleep before the lights went out, as he seemed to have developed an irrational fear of the dark ever since his surgery, one that none of the doctors could seem to explain. He had been in the middle of the harrowing surgery, completely under the influence of very strong anaesthesia when the hospital suddenly lost power, and so should have been completely unaware of the chaos that had then ensued attempting to keep him alive until they could get the emergency generators online. There was absolutely no reason that Tony should've been at all aware of what was happening, or so Howard thought.
From what Peter had learned in school and Dad had explained to him, Grandpa had been a member of a group of scientists that were attempting to study the tesseract as a means to help solve the worsening Langaran energy crisis. Only three days before the Battle of the Continents, Grandpa had caused a rather minor explosion—as if explosions could ever really be called
“I know!  It just slipped out!” Steve says, somewhat sheepishly.  “Thor was starting to think that’s how regular people actually speak, and I—”
"Everything okay, Peter?" asked Ms Sharon as she swept inside his room with his breakfast tray. "I got a notation on my monitor outside that your heart rate's a bit elevated, so—"
"Yeah, I know," Peter said as Dad pulled into the school's parking lot. He smiled as he noticed Gwen waiting for him by the doors, like she usually did. Since her dad's police shift started pretty early in the mornings, she usually got dropped off at school almost thirty minutes before the first bell.
Several seconds passed as Joseph waited, his eyes burning with the effort of looking into the white-hot sunlight until suddenly the aircraft appeared again, its afterburners going full-blast as it dove straight down, heading directly for the location of the power plant.
They came so closely together it was impossible for Tony to tell who was first, but the next thing he knew his body was being bombarded with such intense pleasure that he actually thought he blacked out for a second or two, finally regaining some feeling in his limbs when he realised that Steve had collapsed half on top of him, his breaths sharp puffs of air against Tony's sweat-dampened skin.
Instead of answering, Steve pressed him even closer, cupping his jaw and angling it up so he could capture Tony's lips. The kiss started out sweet, even somewhat chaste, but then he felt Tony's tongue swipe across his bottom lip and he gasped, shifting Tony so he was now straddling his lap as Tony's tongue plundered his mouth, tasting him. Tony's hand tightened in Steve's hair as their kisses grew deeper and more frantic, giving it a slight tug and pulling a whimper from Steve's throat, just a second before he had to abruptly pull away in order to catch the frisbee that was aiming directly for the back of Tony's head.
"You don't have to thank me for wanting to be with you," he'd told Tony just the night before, while walking him back to his office after their date. As soon as he'd said it, Tony had dropped his eyes and started fidgeting on his feet, two things that Steve had noticed Tony often did when he was feeling insecure.
Sam said with a grin. "I mean, up till about a month ago you'd never even heard of Monty Python, so—"
Peter thought as he took a big bite of his pizza.  At least now he had something of his own to work on, something that wasn’t just yet another Lego set.
"Yeah. Can't imagine why," said Uncle Bucky. "Jesus, that makes our 1940's medicine sound high-tech!"
"Yeah," Tony said as he swiped at his eyes. "He always said he never got the proper chance to try and save the world, but… if anyone could've done it, it would've been him. He was… indescribable."
"Ah, I found one!" Tony exclaimed as he emerged from the depths of the third junk drawer. He signed the paper with only a bit of his usual flourish before handing it back to Peter. "Did Papa happen to mention what he was planning for dinner tonight before he hit the hay?"
the Avengers aren't exactly like other peacekeeping or law-enforcement organisations, are we," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "And since we are also a private organisation, then the onus falls to us to make the rules by which to best operate our team. And dare I say,
Ned winced, then immediately busted out laughing. "Okay, ouch, that sucks, but now I'm trying to imagine you on waterskis, and I just
"Nah, bud, Papa's gonna be okay," Dad said as he sat down on the bed. "He heals pretty fast, remember? His burns should be a lot better by tomorrow, and he's grounded from flying for the next three days so his eyes will have plenty of time to heal."
A noise somewhere between a choke and a gasp worked its way up from Peter's lungs, only to get lodged in his throat.
"No, no, that's not it!" he cried as he locked his knees and elbows, trying to angle his upper body downward. He managed to get himself parallel to the water barely before he would've broken the top of the fog line, activating his parachute as a sort of makeshift flight stabiliser.
Tony called it breaking the cycle of shame, and Steve couldn't agree more. Steve had been drawn to both of the Starks from the very moment Nick Fury first showed him their pictures in their SHIELD files, promising Fury that he would search for them until he found them, no matter how long it took.
The next chapter will feature the big confrontation, and then a shorter epilogue will close out the story after that 😊
"All right." Gwen gave her ponytail another tug, her pretty green eyes sad and worried. "Just remember that you're not alone, okay? There's a lot of people who care about you."
“Oh, good.  Make sure you keep the lock passwords changed every six hours, you got that?” said Tony.  “‘Cause I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let someone else die over a bunch of OTC pain relievers.”
