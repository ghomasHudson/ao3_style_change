Clint thought viciously. But he had no choice here. He couldn't lose any extra chance on finding Stark.
things. In the warehouse, Thorpe knew that Tony created Ultron. We never released that information, it was all under wraps. And now they somehow managed to break into our own base right through the front door? This is gonna go south very fast. And we can’t even prepare for it because we don’t
But Stark was also right. Steve didn't tell anyone but his crew; no one should have known about them meeting.
Stark’s eyes blinked up at him slowly, the drugs already pulling him under. “Where you goin'?” he managed to slur out.
“Steve?”
Tony gave him another dirty look. “I highly doubt it. Alright, lay it on me. What’s on the docket?”
"So, you're telling me we have nothing."
But he was desperate. For all he knew, Steve was trapped below rubble at base, all alone. Tony recalled the brief consciousness he had when he was stuck under the exploded warehouse last month. It was horrible; awake and aware without being able to move.
Steve froze.
“First I’m hearing about it,” Steve quipped, small smile adorning his face.
Sam shrugged. “But we knew that. Steve met with Loki the first time you went to go see Stark. This isn’t exactly anything new.”
“How? How was it the right call?” Clint roared, spinning around to glare at Bucky. His face was drawn and pale, no doubt from not seeing the sun in the past few days. His eyes were open and irritated, rubbed raw to the point where tears couldn’t be created to soothe him.
Zola replied, almost sadly.
always working effortlessly together
idea to get everyone back in contact.
“No time, Barton,” Tony interrupted. “He’s still out there and he has my reactor. Knowing him, he has a whole line of prototypes to try out.”
“Well,” Steve continued. “Not completely, Sir, and that’s part of the reason we’re here. We think that- ”
The office was bare, impersonal even, and Steve couldn’t help but think back to when he first stepped into Tony’s office. Both were just covers; no real work was done here.
“Tony.”
It was James Barnes.
“I leave for like five minutes, Tony," he groaned, unimpressed. "Five fucking minutes and you can’t keep your hands to yourself.”
The lab was quiet, a rare feat in itself, and Steve’s echoing footsteps into the room felt like a march to the gallows. Tony was bent over a table, looking down at a mess of God-knows-what, but neither his hands or eyes where moving. His focus was clearly on Steve.
Rogers deflated, rubbing a hand through his hair. “Tony, I- I didn’t know how to tell you. I thought it would bring up bad memories, what with your strained relationship with your father.”
A hoarse sob tore from his chest as the rest of his body started to shut down.
“Clint, stop! Don’t look!” Bucky's yelled behind him.
By the time they’d reached Casey, Steve had gotten everything he could think of, hoping that the weird structures that littered the town would be enough to tire Tony out for tonight.
Bucky collapsed down into his chair. “Jesus,” he moaned, rubbing at his face with his flesh hand.
“Which means that you’ve got at least one employee connected with the Ten Rings.”
As usual, I live for comments/feedback!
“It’s ok,” Steve soothed. “We’ll find him.” Steve didn’t know if he was saying that for Tony’s benefit, or for his own.
"You gonna invite me in?" Stark asked, gesturing to Steve's office behind them.
He didn’t know where he was, he didn’t care.
“If you say so,” said Steve, a small smile playing on his lips as he rested his cheek in Tony’s hair. “You’ll be safe?” he asked quietly.
Clint pressed his fingers hard against his temple. “Yeah, sorry, Phil. Got a little lost in thought there.”
“You can’t do this; you won’t do this. You don’t have that kind of dark side.” Hammer almost taunted.
needed you and you weren’t there. I-I can’t do this. I’m trying and nothing is working, and I can’t
Steve hissed back at Bucky.
Steve watched as Bruce’s eyes turn an alarming shade of green. “You listen to me. This man right here is my friend. If he dies on this table, you’re going to have to deal with me.”
"You know, you're really starting to piss me off."
Emily let out a shaky breath as she pushed up on her supporting leg, until she was on the ball of her foot. There was a slight moment of stillness, grace and elegance covering the body, before there was a slight jerk in the leg, wobbles to each side increasing with each turn before a tipping point was reached, sending Emily tumbling to the floor.
Who the hell was Joseph Grant?
Steve jumped, a voice from the ceiling startling him. “What the- ”
So Tony had talked enough for the both of them. Not so different from the last time he and Barnes had spent time in this building, when Tony had tried to distance himself from Steve’s betrayal, and a one-armed Barnes pleading for him to dive off the deep end. The only good thing about this trip to the office was that Tony could finally give himself the upgrade he so desperately needed. With the weapons division shut down, Tony had been working exuberantly, desperate to finalize that product that Obie needed to hook the board in.
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve said finally. “It won’t last.”
And Steve did.
Tony finally did stop when he felt Steve frozen beneath him. He pulled away, staring into Steve’s eyes that had found a way to become even wider.
Bucky’s hand popped up in his view, long enough to shove the box of microphones away from Steve’s grip. Steve glared up at the other man, getting an equally icy glare in return.
Phil was working in the belly of the beast, just feet away from the man who was now in charge of HYDRA. Clint had pleaded with Phil, trying anything to get the man to leave, to quit, to do
Steve narrowed his eyes at Tony, trying and failing miserably to not blush as Tony dragged his tongue across his bottom lip.
Ward stared back down at the report. “Officer Coulson.”
Rumlow was cut off by Rogers slamming him into the wall. Using his surprise to his advantage, Rogers broke free of his restraints, grabbing Rumlow’s gun. A few quick shots later, and Rumlow was still on the ground.
But be warned; this is your calm before the storm. The next three/four chapters, the shit's going to hit the fan, so be prepared.
“God, he’s gonna kill me,” he chucked uncontrollably. “Well, no, he’s gonna kill you first, then me,” he clarified. He sent a smile over to his friend, freezing when he saw that he wasn’t smiling back. He wasn’t even looking at him, Steve’s eyes closed, his body still.
“This is all my fault.”
“Find me that shooter.”
The man didn’t see Steve approach, too caught up in taking apart a horrendous looking purse. “I don’t know,” commented Steve, smiling as the man gasped in fear. “I don’t think that purse is really your color.”
what they did.
Tony nodded, shifting the kittens into one arm so he could scratch gently at one head with the other. “JARVIS hasn’t sensed the mom yet, but at least these three didn’t end up like pancakes today,” he said with a smile. One of the kittens started to paw over their eyes. “Looks like I’m not the only one who need a shower, huh?” Tony continued gently, talking now only to the cats. “Let’s get you out of here. J, where’s the nearest shelter? Time to get you three cleaned up for your mama.” And with that Tony sauntered out of the collapsed building, right past Steve and Bucky wearing equally dumbstruck faces, seemingly without a care in the world.
The Commandos.
Clint ran over to her, searching for injuries. “Thank god, you’re ok. You are ok, right? I mean, should I call- ”
“Tony,” Steve sighed.
Tony snapped his head back to the cemetery where Barnes was still being housed. Tony, of course, owed the man nothing; he had already saved his life.
Steve scissored into Tony, searching for his prostate. With a quick curl of his fingers, Tony howled. Tony pushed back frantically onto Steve’s fingers, trying to find his sweet spot again. Steve moved to insert a third finger when Tony stopped him. “I’m ready. I need you. Now.”
This shouldn’t be happening. Tony had made sure the warehouse he chose was free of security or and shipping employees. The trail of bread crumbs he left Hammer was almost embarrassingly easy. There would have been no reason for that extra firepower.
“I’m sorry, what?”
Steve reached out and grabbed the other man before he got too far. “Stay outta sight, and
“Well, if HYDRA has all of these men, there’s always the potential for different attack styles,” Natasha offered.
-------------------------
“Thank you, Captain. You’ve done it again,” a smiling officer said as he shook Steve’s hand.
Steve walked around the room, poking at the papers, shutting the drawers. “Not that I can see. I’m sure he was looking for more addresses for location drops. Don’t worry, he didn’t find any. Other than that, there wasn’t anything important enough to take in here.”
Tony narrowed his eyes. “What are you saying?”
“Then how did Stark have the virus?”
“Stane happened.” Tony pulled back, trying to push himself to his feet.
“What, that I should be counting my blessings that Fury didn’t decide to send you to LA? I mean, everyone’s beautiful there, and- ”
Tony sighed, staring back into the flames.
Tony walked back over to the lab table, grabbing a blowtorch and welding mask, slipping the metal cover his face as he started to take the Doombot apart. It was comforting, the sparks from the blowtorch, the sounds of metal reacting with the heat. See, this? Tony could do this. He could do this all damn day. He was good at it, the best at it. But everything was foreign when it came to being a family man. Tony could more easily explain string theory than how to change a dirty diaper.
Tony froze, staring back at the picture. He looked closer and –
“This was a professional hit. The attack was aimed at me, and they’re using my people to get to me. I’m not going to sit idly by and let that happen,” Tony snapped.
They always pegged it off on Thor’s misunderstanding of the mortal world. That sometimes he couldn’t keep up with all the lingo. That he was ok with the team demoralizing his brother. That he didn’t understand the jokes being tossed around.
“Fine, let’s talk,” Tony snapped, not moving from his spot. “Let’s talk about why you know what this place is.”
" Steve gaped at him. Just earlier this morning Stark was telling him to take a hike. Something had changed, and Steve was willing to bet that it wasn't anything good. Stark may be crazy, but he surely wasn't stupid. Whatever he had on HYDRA was worth the risk of entering The Commandos den.
Steve was definitely surprised when Tony had kissed him. But Steve was stupid if he said he didn’t feel the pull of physical attraction, the tension that was in the air whenever they were together.
“Steve?”
“Yes. So?”
Steve stormed back over to Tony. When Steve saw his face, however, he stopped. “
But, it turns out God just liked to continue to fuck him over, as Tony was about five blocks downwind when he realized he’d left his briefcase back in the cemetery.
The Captain caught his foot mid swing, easily using the momentum to flip Tony over and onto the ground next to him. With the air knocked out of him, Tony had no time to recover before The Captain was back on his feet and dragging Tony along with him. He grabbed fistfuls of Tony's shirt, pulled him up like he was a sack of flour, and forced him against the wall.
Sam spent a long time sitting in the sand after their talk, long after Riley had gone off the bed, long after the sun had begun to crawl over the horizon. He thought about the man he knew – more like the man he thought he knew. The man who, after all this time, after all this hate, still thought the sun shone out of Sam’s ass. And if Riley was man enough to suck it up for his nephew, so could Sam. He stood up and went about his shift, mind made up. On his lunch break he searched the crowd, finding Riley tucked into a corner, and plopped down next to him. They were inseparable after that.
He needed to get to Happy; he needed to help. He had been standing next to the car when the blast happened.
The air between the two men was tense; Stark looked up at Steve with wide eyes, Steve just glaring back at him, as if daring Stark to argue back.
Life wasn’t like that.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.
“Fuckers,” Sam whispered under his breath.
The horn came from a train, one which was heading straight for Steve.
Obie postured, pointing down the darkened staircase. “You gonna invite me down for a drink?”
Stark had said.
“Clear!”
Stane snorted. “Don’t play dumb with me. It was you, wasn’t it?”
Tony felt himself getting thrust back, a huge force knocking him off his feet. A searing heat wave washed over him, Tony quickly covering his face when he felt debris land around him. Ears ringing and head pounding, Tony felt someone grab at his suit, pulling him back up.
“He might,” Fury shrugged.
“I’m going to sick Steve on you,” Tony threatened.
“That could just be anyone,” Steve said softly. He knew it wasn't. That man was the only explanation for what happened today. But he trusted Stark as far as he could throw him, probably even less than that. Steve wasn't going to blindly lead his crew into a trap to deal with Stark -
“Clint, I was trying to protect you.” Another platitude. That's all it was.
Warm hands were grabbing at his face, forcing Tony to meet the gaze of an endless sea. “Are you alright?”
Another charge was sent through his husband’s body. This time, as Tony collapsed back down on the bed, his lifeless face fell towards Steve.
“I wouldn’t say we’re exactly buddy-buddy,” Rhodey replied. “But we do all have the same interests in mind.”
He never found his answer. And when he was finally released, Sam found himself straying from his usual path, taking one that he hadn’t thought about in years. He wasn’t sure what he would do in New York, what he
“Clint?” Tony prompted again, eyeing the archer with confusion.
“Are you ready to listen now?” The Captain asked with a slight tilt of his head.
Tony snapped his eyes to meet The Captain's gaze. “Umm, there- there hasn’t been any change.” Tony cleared his throat, ignoring how it constricted. Happy’s coma was still a tough subject for Tony to grasp. It had been a shattering jolt back to reality, a terrifying reminder that not even he was untouchable.
had told The Captain not to worry. Now he and his right hand men were about to walk into a blood bath.
“I hate you,” Sam said to him, his voice rough from the smoke.
“Well, Cap,” Tony started, his warm voice tickling Steve’s ear. “If I would’ve known I’d get that reaction, I would have done this days ago,” he chuckled.
“No, but that’s what worries me. Steve isn’t the only one that’s ready to throw everything away if that means that Tony will get some justice.”
Tony thought, eyes wide with shock. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Tony looked back over at The Captain whose surprise mirrored his own.
Pepper frowned, ignoring the question. “Are you alright?”
Clint thought to himself. Figures that a rag-tag bunch of criminals couldn't muster together a sincere '
“Are you sure he'll go through with it? After everything you told us about their past, you're sure Stark will push through his daddy issues to get to Steve before Loki does? I'm all for getting Stark back on our side, but I don't know the man well enough to trust that he'll follow suit. I don't want to risk Steve on your gut feeling.”
It was moments like that that showed Tony how much he relied on Pepper, on how he needed her in his life. She was his lighthouse, a constant beam of light and security that he would be lost without.
When Tony pulled away, he was transferred over to Steve, giving him an equally as hard squeeze. “Sorry, Clint,” the blonde apologized. “It’s real good to see you.”
They were safe, for now.
What would he tell Bucky? What could he tell him? Steve himself wasn’t even sure what was the matter. Maybe it was the fear of unwillingly becoming the cheese in the middle this game of cat and mouse. Or maybe it was the fear that it wasn’t unwilling; that it was anything but.
Steve rubbed his hands over his face. “This could not have gone worse.”
Tony, after hanging up on Coulson, continued on his venture of getting the hell out of dodge. The Commandos knew where to go, and Tony was given the perfect window to slip out of their lives for good. And, of course, the lying Captain got the added benefit of knowing that his just as deceitful best friend had survived.
“Buck,” Steve’s voice wobbled.
“The Captain.”
The volume decreased to Tony’s usual ramblings, Natasha listening intently to the engineer. “No, Sam’s not lying to you. Really. Steve wants him and Clint to go check on the old SSR file locations. We’ve stopped at some already and someone’s been clearing them out. We need to know what else is missing.”
Clint clenched his jaw. “I don’t have time to waste on you. Come on, Thor. This asshole will get what’s coming to him eventually.”
There was a long silence before the prisoner finally looked up to glare at the two of them. Greasy, unruly locks covered a pale face. Loki was almost unrecognizable in the cell; Pierce grinned at the the man's current state. He'd told his boys that their most recent inmate was not their top priority, and it seems that they took it to heart. It looked like they had some lingering beef with the Norwegian as well.
“Steve, get out of my way. I need to- ”
Tony hated it.
Barnes shrugged.
Fury gave a hollow chuckle before reaching into his uniform. Tony tensed, his hand still lying over his gun. He couldn’t help but give a small curse when Fury pulled out not a gun, but a warrant.
Steve looked away, tears threatening to spill over his ashen cheeks. “No.”
“I may have done some digging in my spare time,” Tony answered innocently. “Found some cool spots that even I’d like to try. Washington, Nevada, Arkansas, Indiana. Florida.”
Clint begged. “You know Stark is on our side.”

Steve spun around in the loose grasp. “Are you doing anything later?”
Steve rolled his eyes, but didn't push further. Tony Stark had unbelievable resources; if he wanted to find The Commandos base, he would with no problem. Hell, Stark was probably about three steps away from finding out Steve's name, if he hadn't already.
“Yes,” Natasha confirmed. “He and Bucky are already writing them down. He said he’ll shoot over a list of which ones are empty after they’ve all been checked.”
“I’m sure we can scrounge together something,” Steve answered ruefully.
“I was walking outside the precinct.”
Tony froze, causing Steve to stumble into him.
Even with the meal in his mouth, Clint could still hear the rumble of Tony throat trying to form words. He felt a small smile tug at the corner of his lip, watching at Tony’s increasing frustration at the speed of his chewing – turns out even his own body couldn’t keep up with that mouth. “I’m just saying,” Tony continued, as he washed down the rest of the burger with his drink, “everyone needs closure. And if your version of closure is flying thousands of miles to murder a foreigner with a weapon from the Paleolithic Era, I’m game.”
“Pietro got sent off to Coulson again.”
Tony sighed before getting to work. Stark Industries was in the clean energy business now, and hopefully, at some point, Tony will be able to create individual systems for businesses, hell, even homes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve snorted. “It took you a few hours to find my home base. Surely Tony Stark could figure out a measly phone number.”
He heard Yinsen hum. “The braces are fine; they’ll hold for a few more weeks and we’ll go from there. As for the other one,” he said, carefully switching between hands. “You haven’t ripped your stitches, which, for you, is a momentous achievement. Any loss of mobility?”
He was here because he wanted the same thing for Steve.
Tony grumbled, but relented, leaning back into Steve. “Steve, I- ”
They both collapsed onto the sheets, neither man making a move to pull away from each other. Steve felt himself drifting asleep, so he curled protectively around Tony, pressing a small kiss to the back of Tony’s neck.
“No, Obie. I’m not getting involved.”
Tony nodded, not trusting his voice as his heart throbbed at the memory of Steve’s teasing laughs and carefree smile, his promises burning sweetly. “But they don’t know that I do,” Tony finally managed to grit out.
“Yes, of course,” she confirmed. “Tony, Obadiah has gone insane, he’s in there and- ”
He’d unknowingly walked Barnes through the process, his mouth spewing steps out before his brain had thought to catch up. And while Barnes was quiet in his deliberation of Phil’s situation, he had more than enough to say about him replacing his night-light.
“Don’t mind if I do,” said Sam.
Steve sighed, looking around the grand foyer again. There was no good way to make any further progress. This was a dumb idea. He needed to regroup and scout the building. Regardless, he had to find something fast. Tony would be up soon, if he wasn’t already, and once he found that Steve wasn’t in his head, it wouldn’t be hard for the other man to put two and two together on where he’d gone.
Steve nodded. “What about you?”
“You gotta shift tonight?” Steve tried not to sound too desperate.
“Well, we don’t exactly have a lot going for us,” mused Clint, looking to Thor. “He works with your brother. Any chance you could call him up so I can shoot him between the eyes?”
Bucky listened closer. It was hard, his ears struggling to work, his brain sluggish as it tried to comprehend the noises. They were familiar tones; he’d heard them too many times before.
crying?”
It wasn’t long before the facility was encased in silence again. The few men that were charged with guarding the building were no match for the onslaught from The Commandos.
“I don’t like to be ignored,” Tony pouted, crossing his arms. Steve caught a flash of color in the other man’s hand.
With that public knowledge, not only to Stane and Hammer, but to other mobs as well, it wouldn’t be long before every mob in New York would be gunning for the man and all the secrets he held. Steve Rogers and his knowledge were worth starting a mob war over. Sure, Pierce and HYDRA were a devastating force, but trying to get to Steve Rogers before the rest of New York could prove difficult. That’s not even getting started on the backlash he is going to get now that Hammer and Stane know why he wanted The Captain for himself, leaving the two of them to deal with Stark.
“What the- listen. You’re young. You’re fresh meat. The mobs in this town will eat you alive, spit you out, and leave you for the dogs. You’re not going to be able to hang with them. I get the whole angsty rebellion phase, trust me, I've been there, but there are other ways to deal with your feelings that won't end with you six feet under. Have you ever tried pottery? I hear it does wonders for the temperament.”
“No rest for the wicked, I suppose,” Yinsen answered before taking apart the nearest weapon closest to him. “How are the hands?”
Bucky let out a deep breath. “I haven’t seen you like this since you first set eyes on a microphone. The whole episode, you just- you weren’t right.”
He tore his eyes back to the remnants of his base.
Steve whipped around to face Stark. “Thor?”
Tony Stark sat elbows deep into his new project. Parts were strewn all over the mansion’s back lawn, but Tony never spared a second glance. He rubbed the sweat off his forehead, only to replace it with grease stains.
But Tony didn’t have eyes for him anymore. He stared off onto Steve’s shoulder, a hand reaching forward to pull a small rock that had gotten lodged from his tumble.
Steve shot him an unimpressed glare. “I won’t put another bullet in you.”
Tony’s heart was pounding in his chest. There was no way he could have known these things. Maybe he was bluffing?
“You, know, maybe they’re right. Maybe you should take a day,” Steve suggested.
Tony sighed again, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck. “Nothing, I just, uh – I thought maybe you liked me better like this.”
Tony nodded again, flopping back against the mattress. He heard a cap pop, Steve opening the bottle of lube. There was another pause, and Tony couldn’t help but peek up again, watching Steve rub the lube between his fingers. “What are you doing?”
It happened more often than not. Clint’s ears just aren’t always reliable. He had been blessed with some of the best eyes the world had ever seen. Of course, his other senses had to pay the price for that. His hearing was mediocre at best, and the beatings he got in the circus didn’t do him any favors.
“Someone threw a bomb down a storm sewer? Why?”
Moments dragged on, as Steve battled inside his head. “There’s a floor safe. Under the rug. 1918,” he said, defeated.
Tony led them further in, through the kitchen and past the freezers, and into a cramped storage area. The team stepped lightly, trying to walk over cleaning supplies and other storage items. “I suppose there’s a reason we’re all crammed back here?” Clint sighed.
was one sentence. But at a closer inspection, ‘
Obie! Do you really want these people running around with the best weapons on the market?”
With the decisions I've made in the past month, its a miracle that anyone ever thought that I could lead them. I mean, HYDRA almost killed you, Buck! I got our home destroyed, I got us loved with Loki, I gave out SSR secrets! And was that enough? No. No, now I gave them my name."
“Yes. Let’s take a look at your life. You’re a killer. You’re a junkie. The real question is why she would bother saving a low life like you. You’re so self-absorbed and stupid. But she’s gonna come and clean you up. You’re gonna take her love like a sponge. And you think you’re finally safe. And then yesterday happens.”
Tony bit his lip. This was not the time or place for this. If Tony had his way, there would never be a time for this discussion. Tony didn't do feelings. Tony could argue the validity of abstract math theorems, but through emotions at him and he's basically useless.
“I considered that. But then I was thinking. You and Stark have interacted before. You drove him home after I questioned him.”
Steve groaned as he rubbed his forehead, wishing for ancient memories to stop swirling around in his head. This wasn’t the time get nostalgic; his team needed him.
“I didn’t hear you complaining last night.”
He remembered what Riley had told him once.
Clint bit his lip. Maybe Bucky wasn’t the only person he had to apologize to.
When Tony finally got a good look at Steve, he almost stumbled back in surprise. His hands were covered in blood, chest heaving, and tears were leaving hot trails down his cheeks.
“Then try your usual supplier,” Tony snapped. “You seem to be doing just fine without my help.”
It was going to be a long night.
“Okay, now make sure when you pull it out,” he continued, watching as Pepper’s hands emerged with the edge of the wire. He never finished his statement as he heard another burst of Wilson’s heated voice. He couldn’t make out anything except for one word:
His apartment was a wreck. Furniture was smashed and overturned; broken glass littered the floor. His floor safe was open, his silver was stacked to the left.
“Now, don’t do anything stupid and listen to Bucky, alright?” Tony said as he stepped back, smoothing out the lines on Steve’s jacket.
“It’s my job to know,” she said softly.
“I don’t know anything that they’d be interested in.” The Commandos were still under Steve’s command. Tony was just a….
Steve nodded. He was right. Bucky was always right.
“Try me.”
“Relax, Stark. Bruce can take care of them. These are for you.”
“Well, you passed. With flying colors, if a may add.”
“Nice try,” Steve said, pinching at Tony’s sides. “Why?”
“Don’t worry about it, mom,” Bucky said with a huff.
“Captain Rogers, you need to stand back,” a doctor’s hand shot out, trying to push Steve away.
Stane sighed, pacing the length of the office. “What about Hammer? I know you weren’t alone in this.”
“What are you saying?”
“So, how are we gonna go about this then?” asked Sam. “There has to be something we haven’t thought of.”
Coulson rolled his eyes, not bothering to give a response. Another quick look at his son and Tony finally gave in. “Alright, lay it on me. What’s Pietro done wrong today?”
You still have nothing?! Ward, I gave you this job a month ago and you’ve made no progress.”
With a snap of his fingers, the door burst open again, two armed guards dragging another body in.
“It wasn’t your fault, Steve,” Hill tried to soothe. “You saved a lot of people this week.”
“I would rather smell like rodent that risk catching whatever venereal diseases lurk in those buildings,” Tony hissed.
“But this is
“If you
Silence followed, as Steve tried to ignore the fact that Hill was talking to him. It didn’t matter now, did it? Tony was… dead. He didn’t have to keep any of the man’s secrets anymore. But those secrets, they were all he had. Those quiet moments between the two of them, as Steve sat in his chair while Tony draped himself over his, the one Hill was currently in. Fears, hopes, dreams even, passing between the pair as the hours ticked by.
Tony snorted. “Yeah, asshole. We. As in you, me, and all those mutts out there,” he said, nodding to the open door. At Steve’s shocked face, Tony continued. “Square deal?” he asked, putting a hand out.
But there hadn’t been any demands. The man had said nothing, just stared coldly at Tony as he went on and on about how good his blood will accent the tie he’s wearing. Which, frankly, was just plain insulting. Tony really doesn’t do the whole silence thing, but he wasn’t about to let some nobody show him up. Which, of course, is how Tony found himself stewing silently, counting the blood splatters left on the wall.
Tony huffed dramatically. “Don’t be such a putz.”
“I should have lied. I should have said I was busy.”
Which was, of course, enough noise to startle Tony away, the man shooting off the stool and down to the ground. Steve rushed around the island reaching forward to Tony who looked up at Steve with wide eyes, hands unconsciously reaching for his chest.
Like the fact that he was sitting bound in an old iron chair, staring up at what Tony assumed to be some mob man’s muscle.
Tony sat up, gazing at Steve from above. “He’s you, isn’t he? Your loop.”
Never again.
“Well, maybe next time you’ll think before diving head first into a battle royal on an exploding hellicarrier. And then, of course, diving out of it. Into the river,” snarked Sam. “Honestly, I shouldn’t have been surprised, given your track records with aircrafts.”
“Don’t be a stranger,” she said to him, cryptically, kissing him on the cheek.
“Well, you’ll be happy to hear that the police finally caught up and found the secret underground base in the sewers. They’re out there right now scouring the whole system looking for people.”
idea,
“Just a minute!” Steve shouted. He turned back to Bucky. “I can’t do anything for you.”
“I’ll go out again!” Rumlow started but Fury was having none of it.
“I need you to call Thor.”
Tony saw Wanda’s grip tighten on her knife, red flashing across her eyes.
Steve’s vision dragged in and out of focus, black dots dancing in front of his eyes. He could feel himself take shuddering breaths, but couldn’t hear them over the ringing in his ears. He squeezed his eyes shut as tears started to form from the plumes of smoke around him.
Now, because of his stupidity, Tony Stark was on his merry way back to the city, knowing
Clint sent him a smile. “You can’t get rid of me that easy, buddy. Where’s Steve?”
Relief poured over Tony. Steve was fine. He was at Stark Industries. Where Tony was not.
“Yea, so when Treachery needed me to get Nick into Stark Industries, it was a breeze.”
Steve walked back into the hallway. “JARVIS, where’s Tony?”
Clint was cut off again, but this time it was because of who he assumed to be a linebacker for the New England Patriots. He hit the ground hard and all the air was knocked out of his lungs, his ears picking up the scathing roar of
Steve stepped off the boat, finally reaching England. He smiled; he had made it.
“Relax.” Bucky swiped a leg until Steve ended up on the ground.
“Are you kidding me? One Stark weapon is worth more than a whole warehouse of Hammer’s shit. He hears that I ‘forgot’ about some boxes, he’ll be racing to snatch them up. That man would probably sell his soul to get five minutes alone to tinker with my guns. We’ll use their own plan against them. Hammer will send some people to pick it up, and- ”
Of course when the man woke up, they got a whole lot of nothing. The man wasn’t giving them anything to work with. Steve had even sent Natasha and Hill in there. At the same time. No man should have been able to come out of that alive.
“I know,” Clint comforted, bracing a hand on Steve’ shoulder. “You didn’t mean it. You know that. More importantly, he knows that.”
She spun quickly, already in a defensive position. She recovered instantly when she was met with Bruce.
“Oh no,” Pepper replied. “I’m not calling the police. I’m calling Rhodey.”
“You’ll have to forgive me,” muttered Pepper. “It’s just a little hard for me to wrap my head around this. I mean, shootings and bombs? The Tony Stark I work for may deal with mobs, but he steers clear of anything that could be considered that messy.”
“I have to stay with them, Tony,” Phil continued.
The small bend in Clint’s lips looked about as close to a smile as the man could muster. Whatever, Tony would still consider it a win. “Thank you.” He tilted his head slightly, almost looking like the old Barton for a second, when he added, “You falling asleep on me?”
“I don’t work for anyone; they work for me.”
“No, Cap. That man deserves what’s coming to him.”
Tony closed his eyes. There was yet another problem he had to deal with. Pepper had come back from the ‘potential business merger’ in England, and it left Tony out of ideas again. He couldn’t exactly send her of to another country; he’d already tried to go the vacation route, but got nothing but an unimpressed gaze. She was starting to get suspicious. Part of Tony just wanted to run and tell her everything, wanting, needing the comfort of his friend. But he couldn’t. The Captain wasn’t going to be a problem now anyway; the less she knew about the entire matter, the better. Tony just had to keep Pepper out of the spotlight until he took care of HYDRA.
“Rumlow, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”
“Tony,” Steve moaned, his movements getting erratic. “Tony,
And you can’t spell Howard Anthony Walter Stark without spelling slander.
Everyone makes assumptions. We can’t help it.
Tony turned back to his desk, looking down at the files laid out before him.
“Nah,” Clint said, grabbing a banana from the fruit bowl, hopping onto the kitchen island, his feet swinging. “These were from the ‘90’s.
After flicking off the lights, Steve trudged back up the stairs to the main room, where Bucky was showing off his new arm to the rest of the crew.
He had had his suspicions, but the confirmation was all he needed. They were all alive. Alone, but alive.
“You know, I don’t think you will. I think you’ll lie again.” Tony was pushed further into the barrel.
They had tried the whole relationship once. After Stane, and the whole almost dying thing, the two just ended up together.But it was never meant to be. They had missed their chance. All of the years of Pepper taking care of Tony, and Tony doing everything to make sure she wouldn’t leave, proved that the two were just meant to be family instead.
“I appreciate you coming down here, Mr. Stark,” Coulson said blandly.
Bucky nodded. “Yeah, I really think he will.”
Steve closed his eyes, contemplating. "I need more than that Tony," he said softly.
“Wait what? You’re ditching us?” Clint asked.
“You’ll get over it,” Steve chided, rubbing a hand down Tony’s flank. He stopped, however, when he reached back up towards Tony’s chest, where the new addition of an arc reactor currently resided. Carefully, watching Tony to make sure it was okay, Steve pulled down the sweatshirt he was wearing, the pair’s faces becoming washed in soft blue light.
he hissed, breaking off in a yowl as Steve heard a thud under the table, no doubt Bucky retaliating like the mature adult that he was.
So much for keeping his cool. Tony felt his heart rate skyrocket, blood chilling in his veins.
“You bought us a street,” Steve said hollowly.
“Jesus, Tony!”
He wasn’t exactly sure where he was; he wasn't exactly sure he cared. What felt like years since he had spoken to an aid on the phone, a vehicle rolled up to where Tony was huddled over Barnes, doing everything in his power to keep him breathing. Hands reached out and loaded them both in. The same hands that pushed him out of the way to start working on Barnes. He didn't fight them, opting to collapse into a seat and drift, pretending he still couldn't hear the other injured passenger's screams in his ears. And then he'd somehow ended up here - wherever here was. He figured it was better not to ask - Tony had asked for
The four of them nodded, walking towards their respected jobs. “What about me?” Bucky asked. Steve bit his lip. It was still a struggle for Steve to let the man out of his sight each day, wanting nothing more than to lock him up to keep him safe. But their friendship had been so strained, with Steve fretting constantly over him, and Bucky fuming over Steve’s mother henning.
“Listen, a brother’s got to impress the ladies somehow.”
He saw Steve open his mouth to talk, but Tony brought his other hand up to cover his mouth. Steve stopped, eyes widening just a fraction. He knew what Steve was going to say. It was the same thing he whispered each night they were together, just as Tony was drifting off to sleep. It was the same thing he’d admitted to Tony on the floor of his office, the words fumbled out of a nervous mouth. It was the only thing that had seemingly kept Tony sane these past few weeks.
Phil heard Clint suck in a deep breath, no doubt agreeing with Phil’s statement.
Bucky rubbed a freezing hand over his face as he stomped into the building and up the elevator. It wasn’t long before he found himself parked once again in front of Stark’s door.
Tony frowned. “Why do I think I’ve heard that before?”
“No thanks to you,” Tony said on impulse. Yinsen shoved an elbow in his general direction.
“Don’t you see? It doesn’t matter, nothing matters. It’s too late; they probably already know you snatched me,” the man continued in between his laughs.
you to wait, to sit back on the information. Let The Captain and his merry men drop their guard. But no, you just couldn’t resist. Just had to prove that you had the bigger guns.”
“You’d let us stay here?” added Sam.
“Not quite. I’d like to see the rest of your house,” she said. Tony watched as Hill entered the sitting room and sat down. Tony slowly walked and took a seat on the couch on the other side of her. Unbeknownst to them, Steve lay behind the couch, shield at the ready.
Amand had found out about his brother’s death. Of course, he couldn’t tell his sister and mother, because they were dead as well. From the bombing in Dresden. How Amand survived was a miracle. The war cost him everything: his family, his home, his life.
He pressed his thumbs down, a whining noise filling the room as electricity sped through the wires, building together to create a blast. A flash of bright light and boom. Both guards lay dead at Tony’s feet.
Clint just hummed.
Steve had nothing. He was on his last clip, their cover was being blown to smithereens, and there was no possible way to get the any of the exits without getting a few rounds pumped into them.
Steve fumbled, still focused on that sharp stare, his entire argument evaporating from his mind. All he could think of, was his mother, yelling in his ear about manners. “Sorry,” Steve blurted. “I-I didn’t realize you were with someone. I’ll come- ” he tailed off when he saw the person Fury was meeting with flounder at the sound of his voice. A familiar mop of unruly, and a pair of equally unruly eyes, peeked at him from over the chair back.
And let it be said that Steve was never one to short change his boyfriends.
“Carrie?”
“Well, she sure as hell isn’t here!” Mrs. Mason snapped angrily. She saw Natasha and scolded, “Stop inviting your derelict friends here before I call the police!” The old wench slammed her own door shut before Natasha could respond.
He idled back over to the couch and sat down, facing the window. His troubled thoughts were soon subdued over the familiar scratching on pencil against paper.
Steve bit back a laugh, hiding his face into Tony’s neck. “A toaster. Really?”
Steve couldn’t help but feel a pulse of selfishness, the key to Tony’s safehouse burning a hole in his pocket. Steve would be getting a larger slice than everyone else – that was, if Fury didn’t arrest him on finding out he ditched Kansas to head to North Carolina. But, if he knew the rest of his team, he had no doubt in his mind that they wouldn’t be trying something similar.
Further up the road, he saw another man aim a gun at a hobo, shouting at the top of his lungs.
“Did you forget to notice that the building you just flew into is on fire?!”
was all she could whisper, unable to tear her gaze from the phone.
Tony could feel his heart threatening to thud out of his chest, the blood rushing through his veins a dull roar in in his ears. “You confessed,” he finally grit out.
Steve shuddered. “I know. There was… it was cold. But how am I here?” Steve broke off, looking back at his friend. Bucky was pale, his dark hair looking more black against the pastiness of his skin. He was in a sweatshirt, one of Steve’s, with a blanket thrown across his own back.
“I already told you, HYDRA!”
“You bring up a good point,” said Clint. “I don’t think we should bring him here, per say.”
Steve snorted. “Barely. Clint had just rounded up two before the cops showed up to deal with the other three.”
Another pain hit hard in Steve’s chest. After all that he'd already done, it still hurt Steve every time that Tony didn’t expect anything in return. Like he didn’t deserve it. That somewhere out there, someone had told Tony that he wasn’t good enough. That he wasn’t worth it. Steve was going to change that.
Steve spun around to be faced with Natasha. “Natasha, hi! I wasn’t- I mean, I was just- ” he broke off with a huff.
Steve sat up, moving his hands around Tony until he was seated in his lap. With this new angle, Steve hit Tony’s prostate with each thrust. Tony cried out into the night before grasping at Steve’s face for a brutal kiss.
Steve watched as Tony’s fingers dug into the arms of his chair. Could he really let Tony do that? Stark Industries might have started with Howard, but it flourished because of Tony. The brunette barely talked that side of his life with Steve, but he knew that it was still an important part of him. It had always been a part of him. Just last week, Tony had been manic, whispering excitedly to Steve about the new avenues the company was going to explore now that they shut down their weapons division.
“I’m going to regret this.”
Steve’s answering smile was blinding, and Tony didn’t even have a chance to reciprocate before the blonde was atop him again.
“And we have a winner.”
“The only one playing here, Steve, is you.”
The car screeched to a halt. “Why are you stopping? We’re not… there…” he trailed off, looking out the front window. Traffic was bumper to bumper, only a mere block away from Stark Industries. And while there was always traffic in New York City, there wasn’t a jam due to bright flashes of light, the bursts showering out from the glass windows of his building, wreaking havoc on the public below.
“The dead leave bodies, Clint," Natasha negated, pulling him from his thoughts. "Why bother hiding the body from us? If anything, they’d want us to find him.”
Tony tried to control his breathing as he filled up another cup. His hands were shaking so much that the old coffee spilled all over the table.
Hill frowned, but didn’t argue. She reached down to her belt and pulled up her walkie-talkie. “May?”
Steve was out of the room in an instant, sprinting towards the car as he heard Hammer cackle behind him. Steve jumped into the driver seat, seeing that Thor and Clint had sidled in with him.
Tony smiled sweetly, giving him a gentle kiss. “Our bed,” he agreed.
So when Fury asked him to consult on SHIELD business, Tony accepted. When Fury asked to make new tech, Tony accepted. When Fury asked him to take in the Avengers, Tony accepted.
“Tony,” Steve sighed.
It’s not like he wanted to stay.
“How much do you know about The Monger?”
Wanda bit out a laugh. “Are you joking? No. Absolutely not. If Stark got nabbed then that’s on him. It’s about time he finally get wiped off the map.”
“I’m sorry?”
Tony immediately shouldered the burden himself and without question, like he was the reason that the problem was there in the first place. “You know, I do have a private jet,” the man said.
“More than you’d think,” Yinsen answered with another smile, his eyes gleaming mischievously.
“Probably not a good move. I mean, the one bargaining chip we had killed himself, so I wouldn’t even know where to start. Besides, now that we now HYDRA is in with the police, God only know where else they have their claws. We draw them out and we could soon find ourselves over our heads.”
Once loaded, the fleet on vans peeled onto the street, Steve on the phone with Tony’s friend Rhodes to have him meet them there. The twins hadn’t said much, but he tried not to dwell on it. Apparently some of their homeless friends had seen Stark through one of the windows when they were trying to find somewhere to bunk for the night. He knew the twins wold pull through, despite their misgivings about Stark. This was the break that they were waiting for, the one that they needed.
Bucky pulled him from his thoughts. He looked over at his friend questioningly. “We’re here,” Bucky stated, nodding out the window. Steve peered out and saw the innocuous warehouse looking back at him, across from the alley where they’d parked.
“Don’t bother, he's out,” Barnes grit out. “We need to get him dry. Now.”
Tony groaned again, shaking his head. “I’m just so damn hot,” he whined.
“Don’t you fucking think about. Don’t even look at my ride. I’ll put a cap in your ass so fast if I see you by my baby again.” The hobo took off running. “Yea, that’s right, you better run!”
“Captain,” Hammer started. “I’m a powerful man. I can
“Cap.”
“Tony isn’t the monster you want him to be. Not with me here. I won’t let that happen. Do you know what that means? That means no Iron Man, no chaotic future, no Peggy, and most importantly,
“That was one time,” Bucky tried to interject, but Steve held up a hand.
“Then it wasn’t your fault," the archer responded decidedly. As if he was saying to convince both him and Tony. "You didn’t kill Phil.”
Dismantling Riley’s father’s cooperation had been startlingly easy, but Sam had also been careful. With what he wanted to accomplish, however, Sam didn’t have the luxury anymore. So, he started to get less careful. Went loud and went fast. Riley would have appreciated that. He danced between rallies and protests, leaving with bruised knuckles and an escalating police record. He fought and vandalized, exposed and expunged. He’d stand tall on Capitol Hill, and scream and scream, and scream.
Tony walked out from around the wall and stared back at him. Then, he watched in grim satisfaction as the frying pan sailed across the room, smacking Steve in the shoulder with a satisfying thud.
“You too, man,” Clint huffed. “What the hell are you doing here?
“You what?!” Clint pulled Tony down the stairs, back to where Steve was. Not, of course, before passing Delmar’s cell. “Is that a medical team? What the hell did you do?”
“Really?”
“I think he’s finally good to go,” said Bruce, pulling Steve out of his head. “Of course, God forbid we get an actual doctor that can give you actual answers.”
Barton turned to face Loki. “Let’s go.”
Thor sighed, leaning back against the wall. The man had been trying for days, pleading with Loki about any possible leads for finding Tony. Clint was surprised to say the least. Sure, Thor would do as Steve asked and help the team out, but he never expected Thor to go completely out of his way to try and save his main competitor. Thor and Tony were always at each other’s throats, more so than Tony and Bucky. But then again, how the two of them managed to come away from it as the best of pals, Clint would never understand. He could only guess almost dying in a burning warehouse would change any man’s attitude.
No, not that kind of warm. Not the kind where he had to roll up his sleeves to stay cool in a sweltering summer. Not the kind where his legs always stuck to the backs of leather seats. Not where he tasted the salt from his brow, or felt the dampness of his clothes.
“Shhhh, sweetheart. It’s ok.” Strong arms wrapped around Tony, pulling him back up against a solid chest. “It’s alright, breathe with me.”
“Probably.”
He stopped when he found Tony looking at him oddly. “What?” Steve snapped.
Pierce tightened his fists. “Steve Rogers is not your concern. Only Stark is.”
Steve brushed a hand over Tony’s cheek. “Come on, Shellhead. We’re superheroes. What could happen?”
“He doesn’t pay me,” Coulson retorted, still staring out at the road ahead of them.
Steve pulled Tony flush against him, plundering Tony’s mouth again. He gripped at Tony, snapping his hips like a wild man. He felt Tony reach down for one of his hands, only to pull it back up into his mouth.
“This is good news,” Steve replied, eyes far away in thought.
Stane found himself grinning. “Oh, I think it’s worth your time.”
Steve must have found the bedroom eventually, because Tony felt himself shift from the comfort of Steve’s arms and onto the soft mattress. He barely had time to whine out a protest before the blonde was climbing in after him, pulling the blankets around the both of them. “Sleep,” Steve muttered, lips pressing against the underside of his ear, as he bundled Tony into his arms.
He looked across to Stark, who was typing furiously on his phone. Even after these weeks of working together, Steve was nowhere closer to understanding the enigma that was Tony Stark. It seemed that, besides his initial hesitation, Stark was fully invested now. He always seemed to be working, exhausting his resources to get a lead on HYDRA. Steve could see the faint dark rings that lay under the brunette’s eyes, the chestnut orbs going a little dull themselves. Each passing day, Stark seemed to look more and more grim. Not that Steve could blame him; he didn’t doubt he looked exactly the same.
“Tony, we need to talk about this!”
“I got off the phone with Steve,” Bruce continued. “He said Tony was cold when he was shot. As I’m sure you know, most people usually describe it as a burning sensation.”
But not this time. Adrenaline started pumping through his veins. He was finally getting the answers he needed. That meant they were catching up.
He couldn’t go back to them. Couldn’t face them.
Steve ignored her, taking out his cell, typing furiously.
Tony let out a fake yawn. “Well, it’s late. I’m going to hit the hay.”
there the next morning. In fact, it was hard to get him to move those mornings – not that Steve or Bucky ever wanted to. He was always so soft, warm and pliant against the other two men. How he managed to fit so well between them, slotting perfectly in each nook and crevice, was beyond Steve. He sprawled across the bed and clutched to each of them like an octopus, trying to soak up every bit of the afterglow.
Clint groaned. “Tony, this really isn’t the time.”
Lucky whined again and looked out the window. A dull thud sounded from outside.
“I’m sorry, Sam. We got here as fast as we could.”
It was his pictures. The ones from his wall in his old office. Every newspaper clipping, every candid photo, every scribbled doodle. Everything.
Clint nodded again. “Yes, Sir.”
Keep the comments coming, I'm loving them!
Steve sighed and headed out the door, only stopping when he ran into Bucky. “Go with Thor and dump that trash in the street,” he commanded, nodding to where Thor was carrying Hammer's half-dead man up the stairs.
“There’s a chance, but he might not have,” Hill argued. “The official use of this building is for a task force sanctioned by Pierce. Our usual hideouts, when in use, are monitored by officers and our tech employees from our home offices. Pierce could theoretically be hiding the files away from the NYPD by using the NYPD to hide it.”
He saw Steve slump in relief, grin growing on his face. “You do understand that’s kind of the point, right?”
“Slow,” she frowned. “The coding is complex. If Tony were here, he could probably break through it in a few hours, but… we’ll know eventually.”
And then Bucky was laughing, sporadic chuckles that left him wheezing as tears slipped down his face. How could he not have seen?
They had already graced the scene to take care of the fire, why not stop a robbery as well?
“I’m not saying that,” soothed Bucky. “We’re not gonna leave Steve to fend for himself; we can’t let him meet with Loki anymore. We don’t know what the bastard’s planning, so it’ll just be easier if we take precautions and just keep Steve away from him. All we gotta do is keep Steve occupied until Stark gets here; if the man isn’t here by the end of the week we’ll just go on without him.”
Looking in the kitchen, Steve could already see the rest of his team had made it. Thor and Barton had already made themselves at home, raiding the kitchen shelves, while Banner sat quietly on a stool, anxious as always.
, it’s yours.” When Bucky didn’t answer, Tony pushed on. “I’ve been working with Bruce so we can get it attached to your nervous system. If our math is right, and let’s be honest here, it always is, you shouldn’t be able to tell which one is made of metal. And, I mean, the possibilities are endless. This is just the prototype, but I figured that you would want one as soon as possible. It might carry a little heavier; I haven’t had the right alloy shipped in yet, but I promise, that-
"No," sighed Steve. "But then again I wasn't looking. And even if I was, I wouldn't even know where to look; I was the one that wasn't supposed to be there."
(See the end of the chapter for
When Steve pulled his hand back from the cool metal, it came back sticky.
“Don’t even think about it.”
“No, you don’t,” Steve cut him off. “And neither do we.”
"If you say so, dear Captain." Another bang, much closer this time, followed by a muffled '
correct?”
“Why?” Steve felt himself whispering to the injured man.
“The fact that it’s even an option is more reason for us to stay,” Phil replied easily.
“Please, Coulson,” Fury replied, shaking his head. “That’s old news. Word travels fast on the streets. Everyone knows that it was a set up and the two of them are working together.”
Tony huffed. “
Steve stared in wonder as the watch floated over into Tony’s hand. “You’re really good,” he said.
“Lucky for us,” Steve answered, slowing the car to a halt. “I think we’re at our first stop.”
Pierce’s eyes narrowed in confusion, watching her with beady eyes. “Romanoff,” he finally breathed in realization. “What, Rogers didn’t have the balls to face me, so he sent you instead?”
“Rogers.”
Natasha looked across the studio and saw a few other moms still milling about with their daughters. Natasha cursed under her breath, making a steady retreat to her office before one of the women – the dreaded Mrs. Barkley – caught her eye. If she had to listen to that woman bitch about her daughter not getting enough attention in the class one more time, it would not end well.
“What kind of news?”
Tony charged down the stairs and across the living area and bar, sprinting back up the entrance steps as quickly as he could. He didn’t know who was looking out for him, because he made it in the nick of time, reaching the top as Obie opened the door.
“I’m sorry, Cap,” Clint continued. “I tried, but with everything that’s happened, people just…. I’m sorry.”
Steve let himself be pushed down, his body on fire where Tony touched his bare skin. But he needed more. Reaching back up, Steve grabbed Tony’s shirt, Tony letting out a growl when he felt the fabric rip.
. I'd be surprised if I last the month. So thanks a lot, fucker, for- " Tony stopped himself, his gaze turning lethal.
“I don’t want you going alone,” Steve pushed. “You should take Bucky with you.”
,” Bucky hissed, obviously thinking along the same lines as Clint.
The guards tossed the brunette in the chair across from Steve, Tony's movements sluggish in retaliation.
“Nat,” Clint started.
And with that, Thor took off, running down the alleyway with a still shouting Steve in his arms.
But he could deal with that all in good time. Right now, it was time for Pierce to step back in the game. Word on the street was that The Captain and Stark were still enemies. While Stark had released the wrong name, Pierce deduced that the man still wouldn’t let his guard down, still letting Stark think he had the upper hand.
“Really, thank you,” Phil echoed.
And Tony knew it was true. Jarvis never touched a drink again. But after the funeral, it was all anyone could talk about. The drunk driver that had killed the Stark family. Tony became obsessed, trying to find any evidence that would clear his butler's name. He knew it would be true, so then what had killed them? It wasn't until he had managed to steal the coroner's report that he knew something was wrong.
“I’m sorry,” Steve continued. “That I couldn’t do more.”
Sorry for the short chapter, but it was definitely needed to set up the next sequence of events. Enjoy!
It was clear that Stark's flippancy and overall attitude was taking a toll on Steve.
“Everyone else?”
“Don’t worry. I had Thor and Buck take care of him already. None of this should reach back to you.”
“What?” Steve groaned, voice rough as he rubbed his face in the top of Tony’s hair.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” she replied, patting his cheek. And with that, she was gone.
“I knew there was a downfall to sleeping with you.”
“Of course,” she said back, her hand squeezing Tony’s shoulder comfortingly.
Steve hissed.
“I hid a camera,” Sitwell hissed. “This time I got him!”
Tony stomped through his office, slamming the door with a large bang. Not even stopping to take off his jacket, Tony made a beeline to his personal bar. His hands shook with anger as he poured himself a large portion, only to opt to drink straight from the bottle.
There was much to do: Bruce needed to be called, surgery needed to be set up, but when Tony led both Steve and Bucky up to their floor before hunkering down on the couch, Steve knew that everything else was a conversation for tomorrow. Tony trusted them to not push him farther, as Steve and Bucky trusted him to be fine for another night with Extremis roaring through his veins. Even know, Steve could feel the heat coming from Tony, but wasn’t sure if he actually felt it, or if it was subconscious. The need to hover and to get an accurate gauge of Tony’s health wasn’t present; this time, Steve knew that Tony would be fine.
ask me to do this again.”
“Pepper,” Tony sighed. He didn’t really have time to get into
“Your band of misfits! Do they know who you are?”
Steve still refused to answer, still staring at the papers in front of him. “Really, the silent treatment? What are you, seven?”
Clint closed his eyes. “I’m so tired, Tasha.”
Even with Steve and Tony here, Sam knew that he wasn’t getting out any time soon. They would leave and he would stay, content to continue spending his days staring back at the invisible bars that mocked him.
With a completed scan, Tony could send the face out to Quill or Danvers and have the job finished within the hour. But when is life ever that simple?
“Same person.”
“And I will,” Steve confirmed. “For Phil’s exoneration.”
“You’re not affiliated with me!” shouted Steve, before he was cut off by his watch beeping. “Oh shit,” Steve whispered under his breath. “I’m late. Listen, I gotta be somewhere.”
Tony felt the gears in his head move, trying to catch up.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, Tony squirming out of his grip easily. “Oh no you don’t. Keep those puppy eyes away from me. Go be a mother hen somewhere else; I don’t have time for this.”
did. Tony had made the promise as well, to meet him down in South Carolina.
“I really gotta go through all this again?”
“Tony?” Steve saw his husband’s head move towards him, as if tracking his voice.
Speaking of. Tony was jostled out of his thoughts when Steve cleared his throat. Tony quickly recoiled his hand, blushing furiously.
Pepper’s expression darkened as she nodded slightly. “Are you sure it was kidnapping?”
Of course, there were more pressing matters at the moment.
“Listen, you need to wake up. This is the 21
“Because you were too busy moping over your crush,” Bucky chided. “Once again, I’m the one who has to swoop in and do all the goddamn work for you lovesick teenagers.”
The other man nodded. “Yeah.”
Sweat was pouring down his face; there were dark rings under his glazed eyes. Tony was surprised he could even stand up-
He drove south first, than farther east, crossing a bridge and taking the most inconspicuous way he knew, zigzagging and making loops to throw off any tails. Once he was satisfied, Tony found a small parking lot and ditched the car; he would come back to get it later.
Steve was excruciatingly gentle with him when he first came back, refusing to let Tony so as much lift his own fork without a helping hand – not that Tony had minded. Surprisingly, Tony found himself actually enjoying the overabundant codling, a heady warmth spreading in his chest that he hadn’t felt since he was a child, skinny legs swaying back in forth as he excitedly blabbered about a new idea to Jarvis, in between bites of Ana’s homemade Shepard’s Pie. But if anyone asked, that feeling was due to his body regulating with the arc reactor, nothing else. Certainly not because of Steve Rogers.
Tony shot another glare towards the hulking blonde. “You'll have everything on this guy! Five minutes and I can have him posted as a top sexual predator. Hell, buy me a coffee, and I’ll have him up on the FBI Most Wanted list before you get back. I can send everyone on this guy, both government and criminals with just a few taps on my keyboard. What about the secrets this guy is hiding? Release those to the public and HYDRA thinks he’s gonna rogue. No matter now we spin it, we’ll get what we need from him, he’ll be a dead man, and you wouldn’t even have to lift a finger.”
“Oh, let’s not start this again,” Tony snapped.
“They sent the kid to live with his aunt I think. I don’t know.” Steve highly doubted that. Steve knew for a fact that Tony would have made sure that the child would be taken care of and set for the rest of his life.
“Jesus Christ,” Bucky hissed, storming out of the kitchen. “I don’t know why I fucking bother.”
"J, pull up the CCTV footage again."
Loki rolled his eyes. “You and your lackeys are to punch a confession out of me.”
Their captor laughed. "Please, Captain. Don't be naive. Your name, now."
The team got instantly, scrambling to get whatever they could get their hands on. Clint had even managed to push Bucky into the fray as well, grabbing him from wherever he had been hiding. Steve stood to try and help, but rough hands dragged him out the door and into the passenger seat of a car. “No heavy lifting for you, Cap,” said Tony, buckling his seatbelt. “You’re still on bedrest.”
“Fine,” Steve whispered in defeat. “Kill me, take the files, I don’t care. Just spare my crew.”
Tony’s face twisted.
Because anyone who saw his face never lived to tell the tale.
Clint had never been much of a reader. No one had really bothered to teach him when he was in the circus, but even when he finally did learn, it seemed like a waste of time. Natasha, on the other hand, always seemed to have a book at hand. Whether she was curled up in the tower or on the way back from a long mission, Clint constantly saw her with a different classic in her hand.
Steve narrowed his eyes. Was this Fury admitting to dealing with the SSR in the past? No one ever mentioned his name when Steve was working there, but they had been running a long time before Steve had shown up.
Tony dragged him to a door, one that Steve had originally thought to be a closet. However, when Tony opened it, it revealed another slim hallway. The two walked down back across the new level reaching yet another door. Tony nodded to Steve, gesturing for the other man to open it.
“No kidding,” Steve added, rolling his eyes.
“I mean, that tucking tail is exactly what the FBI is expecting,” Tony continued. “We need to tread carefully here. When Steve first showed up at my place about a month ago, we were prepared to make a move for everyone. But we decided against it; as much as we needed to see you, we wanted to be smart about it. The FBI has everyone on different check in schedules, making it almost impossible for all of us to drop off the map without someone noticing immediately. Fury’s not an idiot; I’m sure he’s already considered every way to stop us from making a play.”
They called Sam a hero for finishing the op alone. For apprehending Khalid Khandil. Sam knew the real hero was shipped home in a pine box. After Riley died, he had too hard of a time finding a reason for him to stay over there.
“You,” Stark retorted, pointing at Nat, “are going to go back out to your sources. Tell them you caught wind of some Stark weapons that didn't get loaded for shipment at this location.” The brunette dipped a hand in his suit before slipping a piece of paper across the table to Natasha.
He saw his younger self he thrown from a house, his eyes meeting a man screaming as a house fell around him.
“What do we do? Stark’s flown the coop, Barnes is out of commission. We don’t even know where half of our own legion is. Friend, I will never be one to doubt your leadership, but we cannot sit idle. Not while those monsters still roam the streets.”
Phil sighed. “We’ve had this conversation a hundred times before, and something tells me we’ll be having it again one day. I know you love Clint as much as I do; you’ll do anything and everything to bring him home to me every night. That’s all I can ask for.”
Tony clenched his jaw. “You and Bucky like me better like this,” he confirmed. “Admit it.”
A laugh rang out from the other side of the phone.
Tony scowled at her, but dutifully stopped fidgeting with his arm. It had been a few days since The Captain’s attack, the tension seemingly increasing each day. Obie had fought with him about increasing Tony’s security, but Tony had shot it down; there was no way he was going to let himself go on house arrest. Pepper was absolutely flustered, like a mother hen constantly fretting over her baby chick. She checked in with Tony at all hours of the day, making it impossible for him to be anywhere else besides where he was supposed to be.
“I think it’s pretty obvious what happened here,” Steve replied hollowly.
there’s too much in here, now, even for me!” Tony shouted. “I don’t know how, but I
Steve paled, soaking up Zola’s words.
Tony shot him an unimpressed glare. “Don’t insult me,” he snapped. “I have it covered.”
“That’s what you said when I was going to bed. I promise the armor will still be here when you get back,” Steve continued, pushing Tony towards the door. “Today’s a great day for a picnic in Central Park.”
“It’s time to meet Fury.” Barnes’ voice sounded through the door. “We’re ready to go, unless you wanna bang it out one more time. Not like there’s a crisis going on or anything, no Sir.”
Barton dragged him down another hallway. “That won’t hold them,” Barton panted. “With Barnes dead, it won’t be long before The Captain comes to finish us.”
No one ever took notice. No one ever cared to.
“And they landed on ‘Go Ugly Early’? Definitely not what I would’ve gone with.”
a bad thing, Steve! You can’t keep going around, living in the past and your glory days. You don’t think I miss it too? But we’ve got a family to think about, Steve. Kids! We have to make sacrifices.”
“I don’t know why I let it happen,” Tony answered roughly. “I just, I
Right on schedule, the front door was kicked in, and SHIELD agents flooded his living room. It wasn’t that hard to subdue him, he was not as young as he used to be.
“How is this possible?” Steve demanded.
“Kids, listen to your father!” was the only response he out from the kitchen.
“Come now, Captain. We have business to discuss.”
Secondly, I will be out of town this coming weekend, so the next update might not be in on Sunday. However, I don't want to push it off and make you guys wait a whole extra week. So, the next update will probably be that Monday or Tuesday. That way you won't have to wait two whole weeks for the next chapter. Hopefully that's cool beans with everyone.
Clint breathed in a sigh of relief when he saw Bucky slip back through the back door. Of course, his lightened mood was quickly suppressed when he saw that his friend had come in alone.
Clint snorted as he fell into step besides Bruce, the man leading him further into his half of the lab. “Both, I suppose,” he finally answered.
“I wouldn’t say that,” responded Stark. Steve looked at him questioningly, but stopped when he heard a familiar jovial laugh carried over the gunfire.
Tony huffed, but opted not to respond.
Tears slipped down his cheeks now, as Tony had stopped trying to rein them in. “No, please. Don’t do this.
Lo and behold, there he was, standing right on the steps of the precinct, waving over at Clint.
Tony leaned back against his desk. “I still fail to see what this has to do with me.”
Clint thought. Around here, it didn’t matter what he wore. One step through the doorway and folks would know that he wasn’t from around here.
Tony scrambled for his phone; he had completely forgotten about the search he sent JARVIS on. Quickly connecting to JARVIS, he asked, “What do you got for me, J?”
Her skin was still warm as he tugged her across his chest, arms winding around the still body as he sobbed into her perfect hair. If he had been ten minutes earlier, he might have been able to save her.
Steve groaned, trying to force himself up. Someone was calling his name, trying to get his attention.
“He ruined me.”
Tony looked over at Steve. “Steve,
Steve gave her an odd look before busting out in laughter. “What Hallmark card did you steal that shit from?” he grinned.
Steve startled, turning around to face Natasha, taken aback by her response. “Nat,” he started, giving her a glare, but she ignored him, looking back at Fury.
“That’s not possible,” he whispered, staring down at the photo in disbelief.
“Just a minor setback,” Bucky tried to reason. “We’ll get through it. We always do.”
He hated it.
As soon as they landed in the field however, Tony knew something had happened.
“Get me there in forty-five. And try Pepper again.”
save Steve’s life. If there was anything to keep him going in this hellhole, is that Steve is somewhere out there still, looking for a way to bring Tony home.
Stane shook his head. “It’s been days since the blast and there hasn’t been a single word from The Captain. I know he’s a skilled tactician, but there is no way that that man would just sit by and do nothing if some of his clan was in the blast. You fucked up. We had one chance to make it count and you’ve ruined it.”
And Tony wasn’t sure if it was the right moment or not – they were crashing together on an adrenaline high, holding off the last few minutes before leaving to face an unimaginable doom. But, in a moment of clarity, Tony could finally relate to every cliché in all those cheesy movies. The thought of Steve leaving with the chance of never returning, all without knowing what Tony had to say was an unbearable thought.
Tony pleaded. “You have to stay with me long enough for me to take you back to your family. You need to see them again.”
Out of the rest of them, he’d want to know what Fury had said to them most of all.
Natasha paused. “You deserve to be happy, Steve.”
Natasha shushed him again. “You did so well,
Steve sighed inwardly, balling his hands into tight fists. “Bruce ordered dinner for the team, a team of which, you are included. I promise your lab will still be here after dinner.”
"Don't tell them anything, Cap," Tony slurred out, his head rolling against the back of his chair. "I got this," he tried to smile.
“Should be pretty simple,” Bruce said. “Gunshot wound to the abdomen, massive internal bleeding.”
Clint’s eyes shot up. “
“Oh my God, yes,” Tony said, echoed only by Pepper’s cry of
Tony started typing a few commands to JARVIS, searching for a phone number. Tony might not have any friends at the moment, but that didn’t mean The Captain didn’t. Number secured, Tony pushed the phone to his ear.
Bucky had wanted to scream at him. There was nothing on this Earth that would ever scare him enough to leave Steve’s side. It was an admirable trait to a third party, but Bucky knew it was Steve’s least favorite thing about him. But it turns out that that was Bucky’s least favorite thing about Steve. How he is always ready and willing to lay down on the wire, but vehemently refuses the offer to have anyone lay down with him. It’s almost as if he saw himself as nothing else besides cannon fodder.
“Shouldn’t you be,” Tony trailed off, giving the other man a once over. “I’m going to go with painting a Jackson Pollock?”
Steve’s gaze snapped back to Coulson. “You find them?”
He and Tony stood before the final warehouse, the one they almost died in. Today had been a cruel trip down memory lane. Tony had shuddered against Steve when they found the remnants of the exploded building; Steve’s eyes still scanned the tree line like he was waiting for someone to try and take Tony from him. When they had reached their final destination, they stopped, unwilling to go back in.
Another body fell to the ground. Another body for the furnace.
“And this dumbass over here wants to walk up to the station and deliver the news himself,” Bucky finished.
Steve remembered the first time they had gotten a donation. Clint had barged into their apartment, chest heaving as he held his laptop above his head like a trophy. Knowing that dumbass, he sprinted all the way to their building like that, touting the computer around like the Olympic torch.
The Red Skull snapped his head towards the two, quickly taking off in the other direction. Without a moment of hesitation, Tony pulled out his hand gun, firing at the retreating man, but to no avail. Tony wanted nothing more than to chase after the man and pump all his rounds into him, but Steve was the priority. The pair raced up to the now gaping hole in the river, the ice floating almost innocently atop the deep abyss.
“You know who.” Images of blood stained lab coats flashed through Steve’s head.
Tony turned over, so his face rested against Steve’s chest, his calloused hands wrapping around the muscled torso. His breath synced up with the blonde’s easily, as if nothing had happened at all. He felt his eyes flutter shut as Steve’s hand shifted, running through the hairs on the nape of neck. Sleep was coming hard and quick, his body reacting to Steve better than any pill. As he finally slipped away, he couldn’t help but think one final time:
“Yeah, yeah,” Bucky interrupted, pulling Tony towards the jet ramp. Steve followed the pair in a daze, leaving all their things behind, to be picked up later. JARVIS would lock everything down until then. Soft lights guided them into the tower, and as soon as they were in the elevator, JARVIS started the assent to the penthouse silently.
Natasha hummed, tapping her fingers against her armrest. “This whole time you’ve basically been the crypt keeper for all these secrets. You never thought about getting rid of it? Burning it? Hell, even selling it all?”
Tony snorted.
"Tony!" A final door opened, revealing a very flustered James Rhodes.
She blinked a few times just to double check that she hadn’t already gotten to the wine and had forgotten. To be fair, it she had gotten smashed enough, she didn’t think her go to hallucination would be Tony Stark wearing a sweatshirt with a camo deer head on it.
Sam sighed sadly. “Come on, Steve. You can’t keep doing this to yourself, man,” he said, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Nobody here blames you. Why? Because we know whose fault it was. It was HYDRA's. Did you place the bomb? Did you start the timer? No, Steve. It was them; you couldn’t have known.”
Steve smiled. “Put on the suit.”
“You have a type?”
“So, tell me,” Barton snapped, jogging next to him. “Why the hell were you looking at those files? I could’ve gotten hands on them.”
The pair started to make the journey back to Steve’s office, where the two had been holed up for months, pouring over files and security footage from JARVIS. They had just made it to the bottom of the stairs when -
Ignoring Stark’s comment, Steve looked up at Clint. “You’re going to cooperate because I say so.”
“Please, ma’am,” Steve pleaded. “We need to ask you a favor.”
“Good. Now, go.
Bucky pushed Steve in front of one of the beds, before spinning Steve around to face him. “Are you gonna listen to me now? Or am I gonna have to beat your ass again?”
“Yes,” Steve answered, following Fury’s gaze to where Steve and Bucky housed the recording equipment, microphones and wires spilling out of the plastic tub they sat in.
Clint frowned. “Let me guess. It’ll take a while.”
“If you think you can just come in here, and tell me how to interrogate my prisoners- ”
to do anything. I do as I please. It’s all on you whether I grace you with my services.”
“But.”
“No,” Hammer said, catching their attention. “He wasn’t here. He was going to see you, last I talked to him.”
