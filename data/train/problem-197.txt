Sherlock comes in to steal a samosa, which doesn’t upset John anymore because he’s come to expect it, now, and always orders extras. Sherlock stops, for a moment, in front of the telly. He looks at John, who is mesmerized and does not look back. He rolls his eyes.
The woman slumps in relief, but the other man does not seem pacified. He advances, takes a fistful of the black satin suit, gives a shake. Even gnashes his teeth. No one seems to notice John.
Between kisses and words whispered over pillowcases, wide palms and clumsy fingers, bars of sunlight through the blinds, Sherlock reconsiders an old matter: the inception of each reality, whether the prior is the dream prolonged or the dream cut away, or whether the new extends indefinitely. If only it were possible to bottle dreams in test tubes! Sherlock still can’t make any sense of it, and that’s still disarming, but it’s not so bad, not anymore.
“You obviously do not understand the caliber of work with which my associates and I are entrusted.” He smirks and presses his index finger into a tiny censor just below the knob. “Easily missed by those who do not know where to look.” The door gives a sigh and comes open at the slightest touch.
John looks at him for a while. He puts his laptop on the coffee table and clears his throat. Another glance. Hesitation. Sherlock understands. He climbs over the middle cushion. John reaches out. Sherlock leans into his palm and his thumb tests his cheek, the swell of his lower lip. He sighs. John takes his face in both hands. It’s a meticulous exploration. At some point Sherlock closes his eyes. John drops his hands after an indefinite time and Sherlock gazes at him, sees that he’s sheepish, rubbing at the back of his neck with one hand.
It’s been a week, and the clinic is chaos. The patients have spread through the entire hospital. And although every morning half of them lie cold between the sheets, twice that number crowds the waiting room. The news spreads slowly, because nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to make it real. And so a silent terror to begins to sink into the city.
“Listen.” Mike is talking; they are moving, John realizes, moving side by side through the park. “I’ve got an idea.”
“Just imagine if they knew…think about the newspapers, the protests, just picture the fucking humanitarian groups! What would the United Nations say, the President?”
John grabs his wrist and leads him into his office. The desk is covered in a chaos of paper, medical documents and histories and visas and birth certificates. John grips Sherlock by the shoulders. His hands are strong. Sherlock wonders if he will snap.
Silence falls. Sherlock tries not to think about the meeting with Adler. He distracts his mind with silly games, naming all the capitals of all the countries in the world, identifying every specie of tobacco known to man, counting the creases in John’s face. One for every death. But this particular game rapidly devolves into simply observing John. He has opened the medical dictionary again and every once in a while flips a page, but he is still not really reading, the absent flicker of his gaze betrays that much. He is thinking. He is thinking and Sherlock can nearly hear the rhythm of his thought, slow and measured, such a contrast to the racing and erratic tempo of his own mind. How strange that they get along so easily.
Now that he has discovered his role in this intricate theatre of unfamiliar faces, Sherlock must do all he can to play the part well. He is not daunted but rather intrigued by the idea. The flat is not uncomfortable and John is not unlikeable; perhaps he can hollow out a space for himself here, regardless of his memory. And even if he cannot, at least he can enjoy the thrill of experimentation for a time.
always wondered, though,” says Sherlock eventually, because he is Sherlock, and he hasn’t changed, not fundamentally, he’s just a little brighter, and therefore he must wonder, always, and John loves him, loves him. “The excess color, that used to make me so sick. When I feel something now, where does it go?”
Usually John ducks his chin. Usually he braces his palms on Sherlock’s chest, breathes into the hollow of his throat. Usually he melts from his arms –
Artful detectives and villains as they are, they strike up a conversation before getting down to the business of death. They speak evenly, only raising their voices to be heard over the ragged come and go of John’s breathing. Sherlock knows the game well; in fact it is predictable until Moriarty turns and saunters away. For once he is dumbfounded, but has no time to wonder before he is tearing at John, ripping away his coat and the explosives, reassuring himself that he is warm and alive, clutching at him even as he plucks at his sleeves and gasps not to be so frantic, it’s alright, they’re safe.
“I do fear that you and I will have to become rather acquainted with one another.” His voice takes on that same surreal tone as before. “Not only am I considerably compelled by…personal curiosity, was that how I put it? I do believe so. But I digress; not only am I considerably compelled by personal curiosity…” He smiles indulgently and curls one hand around the rail of the bed. “To keep a close eye on this little one, but…well, Mr. Watson, though by no fault of your own, you have been rendered somewhat privy to a matter best kept unknown.” He sighs. “By the way, do forgive Anderson. I fear there is no help for him.” Suddenly his eyes are sparkling and it all has quite an effect on his face, playing off the sharp angles impishly. He looks almost childlike. John thinks it terribly strange.
Death watches John dress in fresh civilian clothing. A sweater and khaki trousers are foreign; his callused fingers catch on the soft nap of the fabric. He gazes at himself in the mirror. Bewilderment. There is no dust anymore, no sweat, no ownerless blood on his palms. His shoes are so bold as to shine in the dull light of the military base. He feels naked.
He dawdled on the way back to the flat and it is already late afternoon, almost early evening. The sun slants in through the thin curtains like tarnished brass. Rainclouds boil on the horizon, but for the meantime the sky is pale blue, touched faintly by the sunset. Sherlock hangs his coat in the hall.
Sherlock is already on the scene when John arrives. Double murder: mother and child. Ugly. Sherlock is glowering at Anderson and Donovan, arguing that the mother smothered the infant before she died, that she did not do it to spare its suffering. He knew from a bit of lint or some shit. John’s not really listening; Sherlock is probably (definitely) right, but no one wants to believe that.
At first, it’s worse. They get a case, so Sherlock is happy, but the ride to Baskervilles is loaded with silence; with John’s unspoken, crackling jealous grief; and with Sherlock’s lacking—of response, of anything, or maybe it’s just confusion, whatever he makes of it, who knows. Then there’s a bed and breakfast, and a room with one bed, and that’s terrible, that might be the worst moment of it all, and then, for a little while, it’s okay. Or not okay, exactly—it’s just nothing, because they can’t exactly think about it because, well, there’s a fucking hound, a fake hound at first until suddenly it’s real, until suddenly they’re sitting by the fireplace and Sherlock is telling him it’s real, and John is laughing until he’s serious, and then he takes the scotch out of Sherlock’s trembling hand and says hey, hey, hey, let’s go back to the room if you’re going to yell like that, not expecting him to agree because Sherlock never agrees, never follows John, never, but then he
Night falls and the infirmary quiets. The soldiers either drop into sleep or groan more softly out of fear that they might wake their companions and suffer their resentment. In their white dresses and caps, the nurses seem to be ghosts floating between mattresses that are more like tombstones. John winces at the grim comparison. He had not meant for it to come to his mind. He rubs at his eyes as if doing so might erase the thought.
“No, you’re right.” John speaks softly, slowly, shaping the spaces between each word into expansive, atomically intimate silences in which he knows their lives can stretch, infinitely separate and yet wound inexorably together. He knows it deeply, wildly and fantastically and utterly, utterly irrationally, such that it is the surest sort of knowing he has ever done. “I suppose we can’t.”
Sherlock turns his face, and he is looking at the window; the light slants through the curtain, cuts across one of his eyes, down his cheek.
“It must be so hard to be you.” He settles down beside him. “Nothing ever surprises you. You poor tragic thing. How do you survive?”
Quiet. John begins to realize what he has said. Sherlock does not move, does not even breathe. His eyes are distant. They both stare into the river. They dare not look away.
his eyes fluttering open, smell his confusion as he orients himself, taste his surprise at finding arms snaked around his waist and curls pressed against his neck. John has become all five of his senses. Sherlock draws him closer. Six months in a cloudy world. Without John Watson, the agony of unfamiliarity might have sapped him of strength long ago.
It’s very late when Mycroft leaves; John hears the click of the door, and then the sound of Sherlock’s footsteps, one by one up the stairs. He’s finished his blog post already and is curled up in their bed reading a mystery. He listens as Sherlock’s footsteps stop. He can imagine the way he pauses outside the door, and wishes with one fervent ache that he wouldn’t hesitate ever again. Still, John waits for him, knowing, now, that he will come. A heartbeat later the door opens. Sherlock steps inside, and—wise man, or at least a little wiser than he was before—sets down the two cups of tea he brought with him on the nightstand. Then, he sits at the end of the bed, his back to John, only a slice of his profile visible, the slender shapes of it turned more tenderly square by the lamplight. John looks up from his book.
“So you think that I have been rather brusque. Forgive me; it is only that you seem to be quite willing to surround yourself with Death.”
Blue. If you see two people walking on the street with that color on their hands, you can’t help it: your heart curls with envy, with shame. If you’re with your partner, it’s even worse to see it, because you can’t not look at each other and wonder why you don’t look the same. And even though you know better—it happens all the time, plenty of us never feel it, and people can be happy without it, people
Their relationship is simple. They wake early. Sherlock might find himself nestled into the crook of John’s shoulder, breathing against his skin, or John pressed into the hollow of his chest, his hands curled on his ribcage. More likely, however, they are on opposite sides of the bed, enjoying the singular peace that comes with familiarity. They know each other too well to be uncomfortable with separation.
“I need her for research,” he explains frostily. He is not really lying. He does need her. But that is not why he trapped John’s pulse. “I have a permit. I need her for research.”
Or perhaps it was the other way around. He’s never been quite sure as to the inception. And by this he means that he can’t tell whether the prior world is a prolonged dream from which he just wakes or the new world is a fresh dream into which he continues indefinitely. It doesn’t really matter, but he’d like to know. He never will. It’s profoundly frightening. He doesn’t like to talk about it.
But then they have pulled up to the clinic and Sherlock is springing from the cab. He pays again. John does not protest. He does not even think about it. The words ring too loudly in his mind. They prohibit all other thought. Surely Sherlock cannot mean that. John shakes his head. Surely not.
Irene gives a mirthless laugh. “Ironic that a country in war has to take such desperate measures to stop people from dying.” She smiles grimly. “Perhaps this is our punishment for creating something we shouldn’t have.”
The days blur together. John still seems tentative, uncertain; he still bites down on his lower lip whenever he reaches out to touch Sherlock. Sherlock wonders if he has always been this way, or if the accident made him oversensitive. He wants to show him that he will not shatter, but he misses his memory more than he would like to admit, and some days he feels very fragile indeed.
“Yes,” he manages finally, and his voice emerges dry and crackling, as if his throat were covered in dust. The man starts. “I’m fine.”
John shakes his head. “It’s so fleeting.” His voice is scratchy. “Gone in an instant, before you can even think. It’s strange. Cruel. I learned this from the war, but it’s only just started to matter to me now. Now, here, with you, and…this.” He sighs in frustration. “This. Whatever it is.”
At some point a knock on the door shatters the scientific reverie. Sherlock sighs and admits a young woman into the lab. John recognizes her as the girl who was with Sherlock when he first broke into the clinic three weeks ago. She is slender and her mouth pulls down at the corners with worry. She gazes at Sherlock with eyes stretched out of proportion with admiration. John swallows and glances uneasily to the side. He cannot help but touch his own face and wonder if he was wearing such an expression not moments ago.
A tenuous moment of silence, then they both laugh harshly because they know she has asked him to achieve the impossible. She runs a hand through his hair again. Her fingers are cool and dry. Her palm curves to fit his cheek and he cannot help but lean into the touch.
Sherlock wants to scream because John is so wrong. He is sucked back to the meeting with Irene, the coded conversation, the temporary excuse. He wants to pull at his own hair and scream. He wants to grip John by the collar and scream at him that not even the slightest fault belongs to him, because if there is any fault at all, then all of it is Sherlock’s. He leaves none to spare. He is greedy and selfish. John may have none. John must be spared.
All this has happened in the space of an instant, but one must keep in mind that there are centuries of tiny observations catalogued in the mind of a genius.
Irene rolls her eyes. “Must you be so dramatic? It doesn’t suit you.” She runs a hand through his hair. “Hush, Sherlock, I can tell you’re thinking. Calm down. Try to stop for a moment. Just stop thinking.”
“Maybe to you. But it’s necessary, isn’t it?” He shrugs and takes another bite, speaking around his fork. “Just like sleeping and breathing.”
And there is John, too, and he is saying: fantastic, amazing, unbelievable, genius. There is John, and for some reason he is kneeling, pulling back her shirt—and he is trying not to think, in the beat of his blood, war war war war war—and looking with the death-seeing eyes that he thought he would never use again, would never want to.
There was nothing else to do but laugh; it was the only good thing, and it had to make all the other things not quite bad enough. It had to. In that moment, looking at each other and nothing else, laughter good as liquid gold would shiver over their bodies—crouched, even as they were, in sand.
In any other situation, even just a week ago, he would have dismissed the idea. Too much. Too many problems. Memories that jolt awake shattering the darkness. Blood on his hands swirling pink down the drain when he still hasn’t turned on the water. Scars twisting from the junction of his neck and collarbone digging knurled fingers down beneath his skin to contort his lungs and ribs. The war. The war. The war. John Watson is not suited to live with anyone, not anymore.
He grabs Sherlock’s sleeve—careful, so inexplicably careful not to touch his skin—and yanks him past them. Anderson and Sally watch, loose-jawed. John is glaring.
Summer billows warm and rainy into London and Sherlock wakes to realize that six months have passed since the accident.
The curtains lie drawn to reveal the faint impression of autumn on the horizon. Gone are the summer sunsets, the prismatic wash of light, acrylic orange and red. The sunlight is clear, raw, and the sky is brittle with cold. His wrist dips. Tenuous strands of notes expand and contract. John is reading. He’s got something on the stove; Sherlock doesn’t want to eat. Night begins to bruise the horizon.
John considers rolling down his sleeves—the curdling bruises, cords of color twisting like a second set of veins on his forearms—but then thinks why not, why not let him see. As if it matters to him anyway.
John leaves the toast plain. Sherlock is in the sitting room, facing the window: he is still in his dressing gown, who knows if he slept at all, there are charcoal circles under eyes, his hair is wild, he holds his fingers steepled. The morning is all over him: almost yellow, but not quite. Not quite. He sits with his knees drawn to chest, his eyes narrowed. He probably hears John (he hears everything), but he does not look up. He is apparently doing nothing at all, but John knows better now.
He can’t bring himself to care that two Koreas have materialized on the map overnight, not when John opens his arms with a smile. He doesn’t mind that the wallpaper has changed seven times in the last month, not when John is asleep on his chest. It doesn’t matter if Mrs. Hudson has started to speak with a French accent; John’s kissing him, and murmuring something silly about love, and nothing else seems very worthwhile. It’s not so bad. Not at all.
John sighs and comes to his bedside. He reaches out to wrap his fingers around the railing but stops and stuffs them into his pocket. “In a sense,” he says. “How do you feel?”  He speaks politely, detachedly, but the flicker in his eyes betrays him. Sherlock stares into his lap.
Honest, at least. That might be a little bit gratifying. When’s the last time they were honest with each other?
John shakes his head. “No. That’s alright. Not thirsty.” He pauses. “Actually, I...well, I was wondering if you would do me a favor.”
John is just as happy. They hold hands in the back of the cab and his pulse is steady and content. Sherlock wants to tune himself to the consistent rhythm; he is as nervous to return to the flat as he is eager. Mrs. Hudson did him a great service over the past two days; now this favor rests heavily in the jacket of his trench coat. John has forgiven him. John kissed him over the hospital bed and tasted like stale coffee and relief. But Sherlock cannot forget the old man, and although it is not like him to become so attached to material symbolism, he fingers the little box through the silk lining of his pocket as if it were about to disappear.
For the first time ever, life develops a rhythm. Sherlock wakes, and at a glance finds the little change – the tear in the sheet, the pan missing from the cupboard, brown eggs replaced by white. He sometimes wanders the flat while John is still asleep, just to be alone with the dawn and his mind. In the end he remains solitary, a creature of habit despite the changeability of his world. He needs time, but later he’s glad to return to John and nestle into the sheets with the morning sun smooth on their skin like gold leaf.
Perhaps it is because John is familiar and sharply defined; perhaps it is because the Sherlock lost in the gloom of his memory is fighting back into his consciousness. Perhaps it is because John spells his heart in boldface whether he means to or not; perhaps it is merely because John is there. Regardless, Sherlock lies awake at night tracing shapes over the strong lines of his back; he marvels at the sharp angles of his shoulder blades, the powerful curves of his hips, the gentle slope of his stomach. He listens intently to the rhythm of his breathing and thinks what luck that he married such an intriguing man.
But they are adults and they are powerful, and they have responsibilities, and at the most terrible times those responsibilities are of course the greatest. Mycroft Holmes sighs and drains his glass in one tremendous gulp. Irene Adler raises an eyebrow, impressed. But more than anything she is trying to stave off the alarm that turns the air static.
It’s a cliché, but they say that the smallest pebble begins the avalanche. Unaware of its own enormity, the tiny thing shifts out of place by a millimeter, or not even so much. Perhaps it was prey to caprice. Perhaps there was no reason at all. In any case, it happened. It moved. There is an inhale. An unsteady exhale. An irregular heartbeat. The world pauses. Blinks. Bates its breath. Watches. And one by one the stones begin to tumble.
Sherlock draws back. “But I do care.” He sounds surprised. John cannot help himself; his looks up sharply. Sherlock is gazing back at him quite seriously. His eyebrows are raised and furrow slightly at the center. The curious angles of his face seem to draw together at the touch of the lamplight.
Donovan’s shoulders stiffen. Anderson touches her elbow; sympathy, forced, the color wan. Empty gesture, ulterior motives. Sex, probably. Sherlock would know for sure.
John is quiet for a long moment. “But I think I might keep trying, even so.” He gives a crooked smile. “I’m afraid that stubbornness runs in my blood.”
“Classified,” he replies unhappily. He would like John to know. In any other situation he would have explained. But not now. It cannot be now.
– but John seems oblivious to his lapse of composure, and he has the time to deduce that the place is nothing more than an old haunt. It is shabby and John is relaxed, and the owner booms and beams at them fondly. It is nowhere special, just familiar. Or so it should be. He is relieved when they return to the flat, the more sharply-defined reality.
Blue. In old films, black and white, the best actors could conjure a flush onto their skin, and because every shade was grey you could trick yourself into believing it, even though a part of you knew that it wasn’t really there, of course it wasn’t, of course not. Then came technicolor, and for a while that did hurt the magic. It was impossible to believe that the afternoon sky of affection or the cerulean glow of friendship smoothing over an actor’s skin could be anything deeper. It became custom to simply suspend your disbelief, because everyone knew it didn’t say anything about the performance. Feeling something like that is impossible to feign. Maybe it’s better that way.
John shrugs. He has shut the medical dictionary by this point. “You know, I can cook. I mean, I’m not brilliant for it or anything like that, but it’s usually edible. So if you go out and buy some food, maybe some bread and milk, a few fruits and vegetables, even some eggs or meat if you’re feeling really adventurous, we could have square meals, maybe even three a day.” His voice is warm with hidden laughter, and Sherlock cannot bring himself to resent the quiet joke being made of his lifestyle. “Only if you’re up for it, of course.”
Sherlock rolls over and closes his eyes. He feels the mattress sink and the sheets draw more tightly across the bed. John fumbles noisily with the lamp for a time, and then they are enveloped in darkness. The silence is fractured by his breathing; he is far from sleep. For the first time it occurs to Sherlock that they will eventually have to perform sexual intercourse. Oh.
And as they bid farewell to Molly and Lestrade, it occurs to John that he has just met Sherlock’s family.
it. Sherlock, I. Breathe, breathe. No no no. It’s alright, John tells himself. It’s the truth and it’s all I have and it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright.
Mycroft sighs as if he has just been dealt a mortal blow. He starts talking; Sherlock pays him little attention. The past two decades of his life have been returned to him in an instant. What will it take to regain the rest?
In that moment, John thinks he sees it again. On his skin. Like morning sun, breaking through blinds. On his skin. On Sherlock’s skin.
For a moment John is completely still. Then he draws back and lands his fist in the concave of Sherlock Holmes’ cheek, feels the breath escape and the body bend, thinks for a moment how pleasant, to have even this small part of him be enveloped in Sherlock’s skin and bones, how right, and then the anger leaves him all at once, so expansively and absolutely that John knows it’s over, feels the crimson implode across his skin and then vanish, forever. Clean.
Sherlock rises slowly to find John already propped up on his elbows. Blood drips from his forehead but he is smiling rakishly. Victory. Sherlock looks at him in relief and he remembers everything; for a moment he cannot move. He groans and presses his face into his hands.  He hears John shift forwards in concern, his hand on his arm:
Mike beams at him, satisfied, and John is not surprised. Not even as he feels the paleness lapse back into place, sucking away the color into the non-shadow that feels so starkly visible to him that it almost makes him wonder how anyone on earth could possibly believe that he was alright, that it really mattered to him where he lived and with whom and if at all.
And because John will do anything Sherlock asks—and because he also cannot ignore the feel of Sherlock’s unuttered
Sherlock does not buy groceries. John knows he eats—tea, toast, several strands of spaghetti at Angelo’s—and yet. No groceries. So John buys groceries. He hates buying groceries. He didn’t always, but ever since he got back from his tour, it’s been hard. He would get takeaway or something for the microwave or he would just forget to eat. He had liked cooking before, but there was just no strength for it now. Paleness had a funny way of doing that to him, making him feel like the smallest things (brushing teeth, tying shoes, chopping onions) would really kill him, once and for all.
Sixty years. An eternity. Without knowing why, Sherlock asks: “And what was is like? To be with her so long, I mean.”
Sherlock serves as the guide through the labyrinth of white tile hallways, carving a haphazard path that dips in and out of the pools of light cast by emergency exit signs and florescent lamps that buzz softly in the silence. Occasionally a research assistant will flicker past. Their heels sing against the floor and leave a trail of echoes that hangs in the air long after they have disappeared past the bend in the hallway. Eventually they come to the end of the hallway. At the left there is a door. John reaches for the knob, but Sherlock intercepts him halfway there.
Mycroft nods sadly. “I will see to it straightaway.” He rubs at his temple. “Thank goodness the queen is away on negotiations in the United States. May she stay there until this whole matter is good and sorted.”
One Sunday, Sherlock wakes late and descends to find a strange man enthroned in their living room instead of familiar John frying eggs at the stove. He stares until John pokes his head from around the corner and gestures at him with a spatula. Sherlock’s stomach turns. Is he supposed to know this man?
, he follows him down the hall and up the stairs, and then they’re back in the room and John turns on the lamp and sits on the edge of the one bed and Sherlock stands by the door, unmoving, still gripping the knob with a hand that does not tremble.
Sherlock sees an opportunity. “Ironic that you would say that,” he says quietly, “when I might ask you to do the same.”
He turns on the television while John arranges the food on the coffee table. Some mindless medical drama. Of course he immediately guesses the disease. Too easy. He throws his head back on the couch with a groan. John rolls his eyes but there is the trace of a smirk at the corner of his mouth.
“Do forgive me for saying so, Ms. Hooper,” he says without looking up from the test tube, “but if the world acted on every
For a long time the sound of the television and the murmur of the rain fill the room. Outside, London slowly darkens. The night is unusually quiet, as though the rain somehow cast a moratorium on the combat for the time being. Only every once in a while does the spatter of gunfire break the curious tranquility. Eventually night falls completely and the yellow glow of the lamps eclipses the room. At some point John shifts and clears his throat.
He wakes and the bed is empty. Terror seizes his heart. He tears through the flat. John is standing at the stove in socks and boxers, frying an egg. Sherlock sinks onto the stairs. He’s forgotten that he’s naked. He’s forgotten everything but terror and relief and the sudden flood of love that threatens to wash him away. He springs to his feet, grabs John and kisses him fiercely, murmuring thank you, thank you, thank you, over and over again. Thank you for existing, existing for me to keep all to myself, for existing as you always have, when nothing else in my universe stays for very long at all.
He spares a few pounds for a coffee. The barista stares. She has not seen real mint coins for a long time and ogles at the weight of the cool metal in her palm. She had her pen poised to mark off the ration booklet and now hides it away in her breast pocket in embarrassment. She hands him his coffee. John thanks her sympathetically and wanders back onto the streets.
It washes over his skin in gradients, concentrates at his shoulder, his thigh. Above all, it seeks, reaching for color, sucking at trails of it when they curl newly from his hands or the soles of his feet.
John snorts and presses his nose into his shoulder. Then they’re kissing, idly at first, until John shuts off the telly and puts his hand in the hair at the nape of Sherlock’s neck. It’s gotten a bit more serious; John tastes of spice, tea leaves, a trace of mint toothpaste, and his other hand is on Sherlock’s neck, close to his singing pulse. A while later he breaks away, drops a kiss at his jaw, and shifts so that Sherlock nestles in crook of his legs to extend luxuriously over his chest.
Sherlock stares. He is breathless. He is breathless and impossibly relieved. It occurs to him that he has been hoping with all his heart that John would say something like that. Of course Sherlock wants to be understood. He is repelled by humanity, but in the end he is only human. He wants to be understood as desperately as John wants to help his sister, and cannot allow himself the luxury in much the same way. But if he had to select anyone in the world to be the first to understand him John Watson would be the first choice. Yes, he is impossibly relieved.
He stops the bow. The music ceases. “I’m sorry.” It’s all he can say for now.  It’s the first day back from the hospital. It’s the first day of reality, and he needs time to adjust. They both do, really; they’re not sure how to be around each other yet.
Sherlock throws his hands into the air. “The doctor and I! But that hardly matters, does it?” Fear and exasperation eat at his voice like acid. He fears that soon it will be left full of holes like an old rag and his words will slip through the gaps and shatter on the ground.
The old man lifts his gaze to the ceiling. His face clouds with memory. Memory. Only now does Sherlock understand the value of such a thing.
- and in any case it is no longer safe to wander the streets. There is no law, not yet, but rather an implicit curfew. Doors lock. Lights burn all night. Even in their sleep the citizens of London keep vigil for the crackle of gunshots, the low groan of a grenade, the dull shout of a soldier, dying or running or exalting his victory, who knows? Nobody wants to anyways.
“But…” Sherlock shuts his eyes, opens them again. “I’ve stopped myself from feeling things before. For my work. For my—mind.”
John bites into what would have been Sherlock’s first meal in thirty-six hours, puts the lid back on the butter dish, and slides it in next to the half-frozen knuckles, which suddenly seem to belong there. Where else would they be? John shuts the fridge. He takes a bite of toast. Chews. Swallows. Another bite. A sip of tea.
John does not lift his face from his hands. The boy drifts between languages. He pleads in English and prays in Arabic. John would much rather it were the other way around. He recognizes certain prayers. It hits him that the boy knows he will die. He has abandoned hope. Death leans forwards in his seat. He is neither smiling nor frowning. He watches. John would not have lifted his face from his hands for the entire universe.
Then it occurs to him and he nearly leaps from his chair in victory, too thrilled to feel strange or question his revelation.
Sherlock wants to tell John why he forgot the solar system. He wants to explain that he can’t be bothered to mind something so vast, that could be changed so minutely every morning. It’s not worth it. He wants to confess that he doesn’t sleep during cases because he can’t wake up to a different set of details and have to start fresh. He’s brilliant, but he can’t handle that. He wants to explain that he performs the experiments, the ones with body parts and acid, because sometimes he wakes up and can’t
For his part, John is surprised when he peers out the window and does not see a scar of blood on the sand.
The series of deductions falls into place effortlessly: John is his husband, so Sherlock consented to marry him. Therefore, he was quite in love with the man. The idea does not seem impossible; his mind wastes no time worrying over sexuality (merely chemical, that), and John is not unlovable. However, it soon becomes obvious that they are not an affectionate sort of couple. John does not drop kisses on his cheeks or forehead, only sugar cubes in his coffee, and he looks alarmed when Sherlock smiles at him one morning over his mug.
“This is Doctor John Hamish Watson,” he says effortlessly. “And should you profess to maintain even the slightest particle of common sense you might do well to understand that this alone serves as sufficient authorization.”
John is beside himself. He does not sleep. It is heartbreakingly ironic that he only remembers to eat at Sherlock’s insistence. Always at his shoulder is the shadow of Death, leering like a crescent moon. It seeps into his eyes, his skin, his very hands, which do not tremble even when dawn breaks on twenty new corpses. But he bears it all. It is extraordinary.
He nods helplessly. For the moment there is no choice but to be honest, even though it drives him to the brink of insanity with terror.
John blinks and shakes his head. “If you’re referring to that rubbish about…” He pauses. “Well, I’m not even quite sure what it was about myself. Something about humanitarian groups and biology. It’s truly all a load of rot to me.” He is lying, but only a little. “As you can see, I’m not much of a threat.” He shrugs. “No need to waste energy. Nothing but a regular old army doctor here, after all.”
He realizes that it’s getting close, the part he most dreads. He’ll have to tell John about their relationship at some point, but for the time being he darts away, hides, shelters himself with elaborate explanations of his behavior. Why he doesn’t sleep, eat, why he’s so strange and abrasive, why he’s so cold. He’s aloof and precise, a scientist explaining data, but John’s face falls slack, and he puts down his cup, rests his forehead in one hand.
The pediatric ward is out of the question; so is intensive care. He will take her to the clinic and watch her. He only trusts himself with the task. The girl takes the news calmly. Relief even flickers into her expression. She thanks him quietly. Startled, he asks her why.
“Funny, but you don’t look much like a member of the family to me.” He crosses his arms. “I was generous last night. This is an army clinic. You can’t be here. Leave.”
“Okay, I’ll bite. Why, Sherlock, at the tender hour of seven in the morning, are you drawing your own blood?”
“I knew you would say something like that,” he mumbles. “You’re not wrong. I am being illogical. But when you think about it, this whole thing is illogical.” He runs a hand over his face. “I can’t figure out why she died. I’ve been thinking all day, doing research on the symptoms…nothing. No good reason. She shouldn’t have died from that sickness, Sherlock. It was serious, yes, very serious, but not life-threatening. There were none of the right signs. It just doesn’t add up. Surely even you can admit to that much.”
John makes a soft sound in the back of his throat, and Sherlock leans his head onto his shoulder, reaches down and tangles their fingers together; the urgent lightness on his cheeks deepens fast into that steady, resilient blue. John buries his nose in his hair. For a moment, Sherlock is still. Then:
He leans into the older boy, even though he hates it, and feels him wipe a lurid tongue of vomit from the corners of his lips. And then from somewhere deep within him a thought slips to the surface: it is weak, and ragged, but it is real.
John opens his eyes and gazes, from the point where their hands meet and their wrists wind up and away from each other, at the blue of Sherlock’s skin, mirrored onto his.
Still, he’s not surprised that Mike beams. He knows that seeing the colors is not the same as understanding them.
John knows that Sherlock plays the violin. But he has never seen it, and he gets the sense that if he has never seen it, it’s because Sherlock doesn’t want him to, and so when he comes home from Tesco one afternoon and there he is, standing by the window, chin tucked bow raised, John wants to throw his hand over his eyes, wants to protect the sudden sacredness that has rooted itself into everything, the armchairs the wallpaper the yellow smile and its bullet holes, but also he doesn’t, he doesn’t, he can’t, couldn’t, not to save his own life maybe not even to save Sherlock’s, because it’s beautiful, it’s so beautiful.
She smiles thinly. He ignores her and empties the rest of the liquid from the pipette. He lifts the test tube and chuckles as it exhales a slender finger of smoke. He swirls it gently. The smoke dissipates. Interesting. Most scientists would jot down notes. Most would fill journal upon journal with their findings. And after that most would strut about bubbling over about their discoveries. They would strip off every last bit of value by rattling facts away for the price of a few impressed looks. Disgusting.
A final interval of silence in which Sherlock can hear his heart beat as clearly as a drum. Finally John shakes his head. And then he is smiling.
Sherlock glances at him, then looks away quickly, his lower lip disappearing beneath his teeth as a shy spray of pink softens the edges of his neck and jaw.
A woman in her thirties. She came from work, and soon her husband and two children join her in the clinic. She runs her hands through their hair one by one. They are pretty things, like little china dolls, cheeks airbrushed with rose paint and eyes of blue enamel.  They smile at their mother. They do not understand. Even Sherlock must look away, but John has no choice; he greets the little girl and boy with a smile. As all doctors must do, he offers them each his hand, a piece of candy. Sad restitution for the loss of their mother. But they cannot know that.
John cannot bear it. As he presses the needle into the slender blue vein at the junction of her elbow he wonders how long it has been since he was last compelled to overuse the cool syringes of morphine. He pushes down and she cries out in pain. He apologizes again and again. But he cannot stop until her jaw slackens and she sinks back into the pillows with a sigh. Her face is no longer a slip of paper but rather a puddle of milk. He touches her cheek and rises with a grunt of pain; the leg still worries him.
He does not remember the feeling. In the odd twenty years of his life that he recalls, he never knew it. Perhaps he remembers the occasional flicker of affection for Mycroft; there was also some warm sort of connection with their mother. He remembers feeling secretly grateful to Lestrade. But never has he been in love. He greets the feeling cautiously. It is an uncomfortably new acquaintance.
“Experiment.” Sherlock pricks his skin, grins as the blood rushes free. “I need at least seven vials. You wouldn’t understand.”
A dreamlike week of travel. The helicopter cuts through shimmering heat waves, sails high above ragged snowy mountains, finally slips back into the cool grey envelope of the European sky. John wakes to find himself in Heathrow. He takes a cab. Military blockades, small fires that send shivering fingers of smoke towards the sky, occasional spatters of gunfire, screams of shattering glass, flickering eyes of citizens who daren’t so much as dart from their homes to fetch the newspaper. He is stunned. He cannot even speak. Death is rather pleased and gloats in the silence.
“Entirely famished, of that much I can assure you.” He opens the door with a grandiose sweep of the arm. “After you, my dear Watson.”
Sherlock gazes at him emptily. His brow furrows. Neither of them considers their current situation: injured at the crumpled ruins of an old swimming club. The police are probably already halfway there.
The hospital is another one of those dreamlike realities, just like the ones produced by the amnesia. Hard colors like white and silver blur soft at the edges. Juxtaposition. The voices of the nurses are gentle. The whine of their heels against the tile hurts his ears. There is the stifling reek of antiseptic, the cool dry palms of the doctor as he turns Sherlock from his cot onto the examination table. There is the biting cold of the stethoscope against his chest, the dull pain of the injection in his arm. Ointment wet against his stomach. He drinks a cool liquid. There are voices. The rush of water. Exhaustion tugging at his arms and legs, morphine sucking away his consciousness.
John shakes his head. He is not sure why Sherlock is apologizing. They have forgotten that they are standing in the middle of the clinic.
How long did she sleep the night before, was she restless, and did she seat the vanilla pudding that silly old nurse left out for her the other day?
John obligingly fills the plastic cup and hands it to him. Sherlock sips slowly. He feels that so long as the water lasts, John will stay. He has some ten ounces of liquid to make an irreversible confession. Perhaps the most daunting challenge he has ever faces.
John tells him to shut up. His shoulder is burning and they’re cornered, he realizes—fuck, at the edge of the rooftop, the step-father about to reach the top of the fire escape, gun in hand. Must be fifteen, twenty feet down. He and Sherlock lock eyes, and it’s really that easy.
What does John know of the neurological system, lymph nodes, the heightened sensitivity of nerve endings?
Sherlock barks a laugh—performative, arrogant. It is something he wants other people to hear. And yet when he speaks the words are low, controlled. Almost private.
The cab stops and they step onto the street. Sherlock pays as John takes the suitcase he brought to the hospital from the trunk. They exchange a smile before John walks to the door and fits his key into the lock. The door swings open and he steps inside. Sherlock doesn’t follow. John turns back to ask whether he’s coming or not and Sherlock can see his heart unfold on his face.
He’s astounded by Molly, quietly amused by Mycroft, openly intrigued by Irene. At first, he laughs at the idea of loving Sally, but at the end of the story he pales and mumbles something into his teacup, perhaps a broken apology. He grimaces at the psychiatric ward, and it’s amazing. Sherlock is amazed. John still hasn’t questioned a thing. Sherlock is tense, waiting for it – the scorn, the disbelief, the ticket to the hospital – but maybe John believes him that easily. It would be just like him.
John shakes his head. “It seems quite the opposite to me. Maybe you feel so much, Sherlock, and so deeply, that your dreams are so rich that they’re…well, that they’re reality. Maybe you’re the strongest dreamer. Maybe you can meld the world with your feeling because you have so much. Maybe it’s not reality that controls you, in the end.”
is uncertain as he scoots across the mattress and tentatively winds one arm down around John’s waist. The gentle rhythm of his breathing stutters and Sherlock pauses, but John only sighs and presses against his stomach. He is still asleep. With bated breath, Sherlock carefully splays his fingers across his stomach, tests the swell of his abdomen, the nuances of his ribcage, the thrum of his heartbeat. Then all at once he buries his face in the crook of his shoulder and a sigh of immeasurable satisfaction escapes his lips.
He sounds almost like he means it—though, perhaps, not about the body. Later, John shoots a man for him. Why? The question remains.
He wakes and scrabbles for his gun; he sweats and curses and does not cry. He lies there breathing and tells himself about the shadows of his flat, tries to shut his eyes as he feels the slow sink of reality. John Watson, Afghanistan. The ache of his shoulder, his leg. Sand. John Watson—not Afghanistan. Anymore.
The rest of the day slips away through their fingers. The effort to hold onto the hours and minutes, to grasp for the seconds, is hopeless. Their hands cannot find purchase. They work. The patients groan and ask for water, painkiller, any number of things. They comply. What choice do they have? And before they have even so much as taken a breath the pale winter afternoon bleeds into the inconstant color of dusk.
He rubbed his arms for warmth. “Shout at you, I suppose.” He tugged at her sleeve. “Let’s go, Molly.”
The report comes in at half past seven, and there is chaos with nothing more than one matching symptom. He wishes they would hush. Excitement will accomplish nothing. Besides, the little flutes of glass are delicate things. He balances them carefully between his fingertips and measures drops from a pipette. He would prefer silence and still air. With so much noise it seems the test tubes might shatter at the slightest provocation. The idea is irrational but unsettling nevertheless. The lab is ruptured by clattering footsteps and crackling white coats. He wants to scream. But he never does.
At that, Sherlock seems perplexed. John can’t quite believe it, but there it is: Sherlock, paused, like he’s been asked to explain an idiom or proverb for which he had allowed himself to forget the real meaning because it was so obvious that he never thought anyone, not even the most ordinary person in the universe, would ask him to explain. Of course, he often has to explain things, and this disappoints and frustrates him, but right now he doesn’t look angry or disdainful; this isn’t like his deductions, then. Not like when he thinks people should know what he knows, but they don’t, and he knows they don’t. This is—what? In this case, he must assume that they just
He woke screaming. His mother put her hand on his forehead and told him to stop pretending. Molly wasn’t real. His fixation had become abnormal. His cries died in his throat. Abnormal. That name stuck, too. He would believe his mother for twenty years, until he met Molly again in a morgue. How ironic that, years later, she would make him fall again. But that’s far off yet. Now is what matters.
She has no papers, no parents. Not uncommon nowadays. Perhaps her family was killed in the last raid. Perhaps the father is off fighting and the mother was shot by a stray bullet. Perhaps she is a stranger in London and she saw them all slaughtered in some faraway village. In any case they hand her off to John. He’s worked on the front. He has experience in these things. Doesn’t he? He wonders how much experience is enough. Never enough. The little girl clings to his neck.
“If you expect anything of me,” says Sherlock, and his voice is so tight, straining over each syllable, so tight that John thinks it would have been deep and gasping and laden, laden, laden, were he not forcing it between his cemented together teeth. “Even one single thing, John. You expect too much.”
“I might have been a detective,” drawls Sherlock as an explanation. He drums on his lower lip with his index and middle fingers. A habit; perhaps it embodies the rhythm of his thought. “Had I not been manipulated into running errands for the government before I could protest, that is.”
For her part, Molly nearly dissolves on the spot. She beams and the expression makes her look uncomfortable, like her face is about to part in two.
While Sherlock is bound to his bed, John brings him tea, coffee, books, his laptop, anything, whatever he asks. He tolerates complaints and he tolerates erratic periods of taciturnity and he does not ask for thanks. If Sherlock talks, he replies, and does not flinch when Sherlock returns with cutting fragments of sentences. Several times, when he thinks Sherlock is asleep, he smoothes back the hair from his forehead with a startlingly tender hand. He forces him to eat. He laughs.
“Really, mate,” he says, and maybe he means it. John doesn’t know, and the clue could be anywhere: joy coloring the back of his neck, his inner ear, the space between his toes. Or nowhere at all. “Really.”
They spend a while longer in the lab, puttering around the test tubes and shaking up the petri dishes. John cannot deny that he is intrigued by the whole business. Sherlock moves through the web of scientific equipment and chemicals with a glassy sort of grace, not unlike the way he moves playing the violin but colder, more calculating, less free. Every footstep is carefully measured, and his fingertips play out orderly patterns over the microscopes and the eyedroppers. John watches in helpless fascination. He can understand without trouble the compounds and the equations, the purpose and execution of the study, but never will he be able to carry himself with such meticulous ease. It is strange and admirable, and he nearly forgets himself in watching Sherlock.
Baker Street strikes a startling juxtaposition with Sherlock Holmes. First and foremost, John steps into the flat and feels comfortable. It is late afternoon, and the foyer is soft and rainy. In between the rays of sunshine that cut through the curtains wink motes of dust like fragments of diamond. The light is a gauzy silver shroud hung over the walls and furniture, but the flat is far from lifeless. Rather, the room seems to breathe. The gentle respiration of the lumpy couch and the quiet exhale of the armchairs and the rhythm of the lungs of the bookcases mingle and fill the air. John inhales and tastes dust, parchment, a trace of tobacco, and the rich flavor of old wood finishing. Sherlock steps inside after him. Despite his sharp suit and glittering eyes, he seems to melt into the peeling wallpaper. He is home.
John is going to die, and that’s terrible but not so terrible, and then Sherlock finds him, of course he finds him, and John is not just going to die he is dying, right then and there, dying all over again, he is dying of fear. He wants to scream, don’t come any closer, he wants to scream, please. Please, do not come any closer. Please.
Mycroft quirks a brow, and John gets the feeling that he is trying to choose between surprise, amusement, and anger that he was bold enough to ask.
He smoothes the hair back from his forehead. A gesture heavy with affection. Sherlock doesn’t know what to do. John’s hand lingers at his cheek and Sherlock bends just a bit, into the bowl of his palm. John’s still smiling, but it’s softer. Hesitant. Sherlock chews on his lower lip. John drops his hand, takes his jaw.
And the little boy will do it; he’ll do it. Nobody could expect him to know any better. The older boy is sneering; that would be enough in and of itself. Even if it weren’t, the little boy is just a child. He has simply not been alive long enough to learn all the different ways that people have of hiding.
But Sarah is looking, always looking; Sarah sees it for the first time one night after they’ve had sex, when she is breathing against his shoulder, her stomach and breasts flushed pink and purple with orgasm and oxytocin. Across her back spreads a summer sky, and then there is John, and it’s creeping around his wrist, up his arm—furtively, regretfully, moving like ugliness for all the flaring beauty of the color. She looks, and looks, and he knows she knows it’s not for her.
“I am always serious.” Indeed, he looks almost solemn, betrayed only by the gleam of impatience in his eye. “She is an idiot.”
, not at all. Sherlock groans and the world rushes back to life in an excruciating explosion of sound and color. He is glad for John’s hands on his shoulders. Otherwise he fears he might break into a thousand pieces.
“Lieutenant General Adler.” He turns from the window with a measured smile. In the end, however, he supposes the subject matter does not call for smiling and resigns the warmth to his eyes. He reaches for a crystal decanter of cognac and pours two glasses. The General takes her seat on the other side of the desk. She crosses one leg over the other and accepts the drink.
Sherlock has no choice. He wants to take that chance so much that he could scream. But he doesn’t. He never does. He can’t. It’s too much. He doesn’t risk a look at John. He couldn’t bear it.
“Do stop with these dreadful pretenses and just ask him to the cinema already.” He smiles indulgently. “At this point we all know that the government signed you to be in charge of this madman’s adventure, and we simply cannot imagine what we would do were you not here to kick us around.”
. From when you remembered two sugars in my coffee after two days. John Watson…” His voice is thick. “John Watson, I daresay that I have loved you from the start.”
Dawn breaks, and the sunlight is ash, and London is a graveyard. It is a clear day with an icy wind that cuts through the walls. No rain; the air is dry, and the light pale. Each papery ray seems to flutter gradually down to rest and drift on the grey surface of the city, as though it were a pool of water. Neither of them has slept. They roamed London all night. They had nothing to fear. The streets are safe as a mausoleum nowadays, and likewise haunted by the inconstant sense of Death. He leers from alleyways and the cold empty windows of the shops, from the bloodstains on the sidewalk and the piles of sandbags and barbed wire on the street, from every abandoned apartment, but it is only a glimpse of his face. No longer is he constant presence at John’s side, at least not while Sherlock is there.
The rest is unintelligible. John is trying to maneuver Sherlock onto the bed and Sherlock is still trying to talk, and John is terrified he is going to fall on top of him and he will feel his body all against his, the bones and blood, the utter reality of it, and then what will he do, what will he do?
“Who are you?” screamed Sherlock. He wiped his mouth on the edge of his sleeve and spat a glob of bloody spit onto the grass. The older boy was crimson with pain and rage. He clutched at his hand but jewels of blood slipped between his fingers anyways.
They are quiet for a time. Neither wants to bring up the matter that they know they must discuss. For a moment they wish for nothing more than to pretend that things are as they always have been. They will drink, run over maps and tactics, crack jokes about their subordinates, and of course they will talk about Sherlock. He is the reason, after all. The infuriating precious reason. The glue of their friendship.
“Alright.” He puts his hands on his hips. “I believe you are. Thanks, anyways. I’ll go get somebody right now and put this out of my mind.” He glances up and his eyes are gentler. “Good luck with whatever t is that you’re doing, I suppose.”
Hatred. He had been immersed in himself, spinning through the crooked hallways of his own mind, and he doesn’t want to find his way, not to this place (hospital bed), this time (he is twenty-seven), not to this person (Daedalus, he thinks, so cold in his craft, and his lips nearly curve). But the older boy won’t leave; he knows the older boy won’t leave. So he breathes once through the tiny space that, in the ferocious set of his expression, he has left open between his lips.
, his agonizes, why? Why does he share this flat with Sherlock? Why does he look at him so carefully, hesitantly, sometimes gently, sometimes angrily?
He hopes, vaguely, to die; won’t do anything about it, though. Never does anything about anything. Not really.
Most of the restaurants have closed. There are no more customers. As a matter of fact there is little food left to serve. And yet the lights of Angelo’s still glow, a flickering greeting from across the street. Another fragment of normalcy in the center of the crisis. John cannot help but smile. He dares to glance up and sees the light reflected in Sherlock’s eyes. Pools of yellow in the pale slivers of glass. Angelo sets up a special table for them with as much fanfare as though the restaurant were packed. He looks exhausted. He leaves first thing in the morning. He wanted to be the last to go.
But it was a false exit, of course, and Moriarty’s back, and there’s no choice. The face of death again. Another smile. John nods and Sherlock pulls the trigger. The universe goes up in flames. He clings to John until he falls unconscious. In the end it’s always inevitable. Sleep, that is.
, the ghost of it pressing against his skin, and he can’t help it, hope against hope hurts in his chest—he stops. Sherlock looks at him. Looks away.
John easily becomes immersed in these memories. In the public opinion this is his greatest failing as a doctor. Too easily affected, they say, too easily lost. Soft and malleable around the edges like worn modeling clay. Usually only Sarah can shake him from the claws of his past. Her hand on his shoulder is cool and wakes him from the desert wasteland and the invisible scar of blood.
Sherlock’s eyes gleam and in an instant they become colored chips of glass. It has been so long that John has nearly forgotten they could look like that. Sherlock grips his shoulder.
John bites down on his lower lip. “Your violin.” He dares not turn from the mirror. “Do you think you could play something for me?”
“Not quite sure myself,” replies Sherlock as they step into the building, hands still joined. He can feel coolness of the ring and a wild smile breaks onto his face. He kisses John again in the foyer. “I’d just rather like to thank you.”
Halfway there, an enormous explosion rattles the streets. The cab stalls for a moment. The wash of light does not fade for a few seconds. John counts his heartbeats. One. Two. Three. Four. Thudding in his mouth. Then darkness falls. Not long afterwards, the flicker of a searchlight bathes the streets. John jumps, unsettled. In the light he sees Death beside him in the cab, just where Sherlock was sitting. His face is a white glimmer in the dark and he drums his bony fingers on the window. John follows his gaze.
In any case, John becomes immersed in his memories less and less frequently. He no longer has the time to chat with Death; these days he is too busy entertaining speeding, flying, brilliant audiences with Sherlock. His life feels flooded all of a sudden. His blood sings and his mind races. But still he cannot keep up with Sherlock Holmes.
“John,” says Sherlock, beckoning him over. “Do come and introduce yourself. This is Molly Hooper, my top research assistant.”
, the situation only grows more perplexing. It would seem that he and John share the place; the furniture is a jumble of personalities, the walls peeling with hidden stories that Sherlock itches to uncover. He has been confined to his bed, but once John has left to purchase some groceries, he rises and begins to wander about the apartment, searching, but for what? He has harbored the quiet hope that something will jog his memory, that he will be broken from this dreamlike world which does not seem to belong to him, but as he runs his fingers across the spines of crumbling old volumes and hesitantly presses his palm into the cushions of the sofa, as his fingers find the slender bow of a violin and – much to his surprise – draw out a few whining notes by the windowsill, it becomes increasingly apparent that this will not happen.
“Old line of my brother’s, that. What a terrific arse.” He shifts his weight from one foot to the other. “In any case, as a point of interest that relates to the subject at hand, I myself have long been in search of a flatmate. The rent has spiked in these conditions, and while my landlady is very kind, I have  grown unfortunately fond of her, and hate to see her suffer financially solely on my behalf. In short, doctor, a few extra pounds would greatly soothe my guilt. In addition, I believe you should know that I find you to be an intriguing if not an entirely bearable human being.” He pauses. The bow of his lip curves and for an instant he is an impish child.
In the end dawn breaks, and he supposes that he will have to content himself with that much, for the meantime at the very least.
He learns that fear can be selfless. The case doesn’t matter. Reputation, the game, the victory – none of it matters anymore. John. The bomb. The labored sound of breathing. The terror and resolve in eyes which reflect the quavering glow of the swimming pool. That matters. That’s Sherlock’s entire world. A narrow reality. No room for change.
John is not really listening; he wants Sherlock to grab the plate so he can stop balancing it on his knees.
And with that he sinks back into the grimy glow of the restaurant. John gazes warily after him. Sherlock meets his gaze and raises an eyebrow. They are silent for a long moment. John snorts. Sherlock’s upper lip trembles. And then they both dissolve into helpless laughter.
John looks at him sharply. “Misunderstand you? Tell me, Sherlock, what is there to misunderstand?” His voice breaks and he bites down on his lower lip. “Look, I don’t know why you’re bringing this up again. I was going to stay and make sure you were alright. Then I was going to find a new apartment and move out. We were going to forget about everything.”
At long last the last note sobs from the violin and silence falls. Sherlock becomes human again and the night solidifies. The shadows calm. The lamplight strengthens. This time John does not applaud. He cannot. He watches as Sherlock bends to place his violin carefully on the windowsill and feels helplessly overcome by that something he cannot define.
“Do not forget, Doctor Watson: caring is not an advantage.” His eyes narrow. “For everyone involved.”
Another pause. Perhaps they are both struggling for words. Or perhaps there is nothing more to be said. John cannot place a name to the feeling. It fills his mouth and throat and heart and lungs and pounds in his very blood. It is familiar but strange at the same time. He does not know what to say. What words he could possibly place in the space between them? Perhaps he’ll never know.
And for once, Sherlock cannot deduce what he was about to say. Naturally, he is immediately seized by a desperate curiosity, but he does not act upon it. He only nods slightly and fixes his gaze on the television, trying to drown himself in the blur of color and sound.
“I worry that is has,” replies Irene, staring into her drink. “We knew the risks when we authorized the operation. We knew the risks when we assigned Sherlock.”
One corner of her mouth quirks upwards. “You’ll be good as new in a few days, Mr. Holmes. It’s my job to help people with pain, you know.” And with that, she whirls from the room.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Me?” He sits back in the armchair. “I don’t require any, and if I did I would provide it for myself.” He swallows. “But thank you, I suppose.”
Now John closes the book, leans over to put it on the bedside table, and takes his cup of tea and sips it once, twice, before he puts it down again.
Since his release from the hospital, John has dozed at his bedside, waking him every few hours, making him walk a few paces to ensure that his concussion has not taken an unseen toll. Sherlock assumes that the upstairs bedroom goes unused; such is the behavior of married couples, is it not? But John looks stricken when he tries to stand from the bed and Sherlock catches his hand; his pupils dilate and Sherlock can see color rush to his neck. His own breath catches. Has he made a mistake? Impossible; he swallows the pounding of his heart. Impossible.
“Sherlock…” Irene stands and presses her hand to his shoulder. He wonders if he will collapse even beneath such a slight pressure. The fear seems to suck all the substance from his body. He is left a paper shell, easily crumpled, tossed away. Irene drops her voice to a croon.
happy without it—it only gets worse, the questions you both ask yourselves, that neither of you wants to admit to asking. In other words:
No. He can’t fall in love with John. No matter how much he longs for it. He knows John loves him too - he’s already said it in countless tiny ways – the loyalty, the quiet secret smiles, the tea - and sometimes it’s tempting, the idea of having him for even just a little while. But Sherlock knows better. It would be a gift to love John honestly and wholly. But he can’t. He would break if one day he woke and John was just another face. He can’t be alone again.
Sherlock collapses into one of the chairs in the waiting room. He puts his face in his hands. The excuse has failed. He cannot ignore it. He cannot delude himself. Three more. They will be dead soon. They will be dead soon and there will be no more escaping. There is no doubt about it now.
Mycroft is in the sitting room. John is in his robe, scratching his belly as he walks downstairs, and Mycroft is in the sitting room, and Sherlock is perched in the armchair across from him, and both of them are fully dressed—immaculate suits, silk ties—and nether is saying a word, just staring, staring.
The boy was Mycroft Holmes. Fifteen years old. His brother. Before Sherlock fell asleep that day, he didn’t exist. But he did for everyone else. And when Sherlock said otherwise, Mycroft sighed and Mummy glared and went out for a smoke, and his cheeks burned. So eventually he stopped saying otherwise. But he never stopped thinking. And that became a habit.
He is a teenager. But in him still, there is the little boy, a child, really. The boy is trying his best but sometimes he just has to, god, sometimes he just has to. He didn’t want to get caught. He’s usually too smart to get caught. He
He wakes again after some time. Brittle bars of sunlight spill in through the hospital windows to shatter into razor shards of gold on the tile. Late afternoon. The burn wound only hurts him vaguely. He turns over and sees that the other bed is empty.
“Did you know, Sherlock,” says John at some point, “that people who don’t dream are considered dangerously sociopathic? No emotions to project, no desires…it’s funny, now, to think that people call you that.”
Sherlock meet his eye for a long moment, and John wills it away—green, the fester of it, the brewing storm. Finally, Sherlock looks away. Expression inscrutable. Again, it is terrible.
Sherlock knows he should be quiet, but his hands are shaking. His shirt is torn and there is a burn twisted into the skin of his stomach. His head swims with pain and exhaustion and fear. John is not his husband. He has made a fool of himself.
They take him straight to the clinic. At this point in the war, the military hasn’t even the funds to get him a flat. In fact, they have barely spotted him enough for the cab. But a fat book of coupons rests in his suitcase along with his pistol and his dog tags, and this is everything he needs. There will be extra food and clothing at the clinic. He can sleep at his desk.
“Our work is fatal, Sherlock. We’ll die out here. You know it, and so do I. That’s alright. It’s preferable, in the end.” He flexes his knuckles on the railing. “But I can’t help but think that…oh, Sherlock. What if we never get the chance?”
Does Sherlock put butter on toast? John has seen Sherlock eat toast (rarely is not never), but he doesn’t remember what he likes (Sherlock would remember what John likes, or would not even need to remember, would deduce it from the pattern of his jumper; John is not Sherlock). Fuck. Jam? Honey? Nutella? Peanut butter? Peanut butter and banana? Sliced banana? Sliced in little yellow circles? Almost cute, as if for a child? As if packing their lunch? Oh no. Sherlock does need—nutrients, doesn’t he? Some fat? Some protein? A little sodium? Sugars, preferably natural? Banana sugar is natural. And potassium? Fuck. Who the hell knows what he needs? Well, probably Sherlock.
“Your pension is nothing, you’ve said so yourself.” He draws a card from his pocket with a sharp flourish. “Do allow me this one ordinary courtesy.”
John can’t just sit there, he has to speak, has to do something, terrified that otherwise his skin will rupture at the seams in a bright singing excess of emotion even though he knows of course, that such a thing is impossible. For most, at least.
And besides, were Sherlock to open his own face as a canvas, the result would be so brilliant as to burn the eyes, and nobody would dare to take a second glance.
John pushes his plate away. He has barely eaten anything. He reaches across the table and swallows the dregs of Sherlock’s coffee. Unthinkingly, as if it were nothing at all. Sherlock stares. John wipes his mouth on the edge of his sleeve.
He will move what little he has from the clinic the following morning. He is in no hurry and it is too late anyhow. They dallied with the violin and the tea –
Mycroft is the cold, the aloof, the angry, the inheritance. Molly is confusion, unhappiness, admiration. His mother is the bitterness, the indignance. Sally is the broken, the lost, the misunderstood. Irene is the unattainable, the incorrect, the sensuous. It falls into place. The pieces of his heart. He begins to understand that each represents a facet of himself, with one exception.
When they level with each other in the steps of their private waltz (the broken rhythms of which they join between them, somehow, and John hates it, hates it), her gaze encompasses him. John watches, ignorant. He is a stranger, he realizes then, an utter stranger. He grits his teeth in rage and humiliation, shame. An ache spreads from his sternum, and he can imagine it already. The discolored blue.
“Big brother Holmes.” The suggestion of a smile stains the corner of her mouth. She takes a deliberate sip of cognac. “You look well.”
And Sherlock turns from the window and meets his gaze, and John realizes that, for the first time ever—in their entire lives, he imagines—Mycroft looks like he might not know, exactly, what’s about to happen next.
John is stunned to realize that the research department is in the basement of the clinic. With a smirk Sherlock tells him that it has always been a secret well kept. John makes a disgruntled noise in the back of his throat, but his eyes shine. For the moment the shadow of Death lifts from his shoulders. Gratifying.
And so his presence – Death, that is – becomes more familiar. John crouches at bedsides and watches as skin yellows and bellies bloated like balloons, and Death checks the time. John picks over an abandoned battlefield and discovers that rotted blood smells sweet, and Death swoops onto the young man at the right and shows off his twisted expression with a leer. John ties off fresh stitches and Death hovers anxiously at his side, twiddling his thumbs and hoping that the infection will spread. John cannot help his own kindness and he runs out of morphine a month. No new provisions come. Every time a soldier faints from the pain, Death hopes that he will never break from his slumber.
Soon there is an ugly murder; John crouches by the body and says the woman was asphyxiated, though there are no fingerprints at her throat, no traces of inhalation. Sherlock struggles to disguise his pleasure. John will have none of it and scolds him, but his eyes shine. They gather evidence, they test theories, and Sherlock berates John when he fails to meet his deductions halfway. They shout and throw things and John banishes Sherlock to the couch several times.
The fighting broke into London and it was only a reminder of the threat that loomed like a bruise on the horizon. Defeat. An unfamiliar taste. They can all smell it in the air. The military must be growing desperate. John drains his coffee. He cannot bring himself to care. He will continue to heal what injuries he can and after that he promises nothing. The war has left him blank. He can do very little but accept what life may bring. He chucks the empty coffee cup into a nearby rubbish bin.
John laughs softly, and the sound seems to take on a color and blend into the walls, the air itself. “Believe me, I’m well aware. By the way, do you fancy some coffee at the moment?” He gestures towards the kitchen. “I noticed that you keep plenty in stock.”
John’s heard about people like him, of course. He thought they were more of an old wives’ tale, but still. He had heard.
He cannot believe it when they tell him that the fighting has spread to Europe, that they want him in London. Impossible. The streets of London are impervious. They are too old and stubborn. The people of London do not die on the streets of London. Guns are not fired on the people of London in the streets of London. Never mind whether the United Kingdom started the war. Such matters are of little importance. One does not make war in the streets of London. One talks of war. One declares war. One plots and schemes and perpetrates war. But one does not make war.
John exhales and his words are buoyed towards the ceiling. “You’re going to think I’m very foolish, Sherlock, and you’re probably right. But who am I kidding. You are right. You always are. I’ve known that much about you from the offset.”
John can’t move. Fear, utter fear. Whatever Sherlock does next, he knows he will accept it. The strength has drained from him, drawn into the sudden slip of closeness. Into the taught skin of the moment, a tiny expanse of time pulled flat and trembling between them.
At around half past six the landlady marches into the flat. She is an aged woman but the line of her mouth is strong and proud. John introduces himself. She smiles and shakes his hand and prattles on about how lovely it is to finally meet him. Finally? But before John can ask she jams her hands on her hips and declares that he and Sherlock must be very hungry. In the end they have no choice but to agree and five minutes see them bundled into a cab to dinner.
“A mother’s love is not a guarantee.” Sherlock is tilting her chin back and forth, examining the blood on her neck. Mottled, there—a tiny strain of gold. But Sherlock looking only at the blood. “Nothing is.”
If Sherlock noticed the meticulousness with which John pries his clinging fingertips from his sleeves—not wanting to move the fabric, for him to see the blue shot through with every ugly color in the universe—he does not mention it in the morning. Instead, John makes tea, and when Sherlock comes downstairs, they have breakfast in silence. It is a careful, built-up thing, and it is so very unlike them. John reads the paper until he can’t bear it anymore. He can’t forget the implication in her voice.
Weeks pass like this. The cases blur together. Sometimes Sherlock won’t speak to John, or sometimes he goes out and comes back bleeding, and once he even collapses in the middle of the street because he hasn’t slept in days and he is a person, a human person, after all. John gets a job at the surgery to help pay rent, and it’s fine but it’s not like the Work, stretched by Sherlock always into a proper noun, which is more than a little self-important, but, well, John can’t help but agree. Nothing, it turns out, is quite like the Work. And that’s. Well. That is what it is.
Nobody has yet dared to call it World War Three and he supposes that they never will. Perhaps if the United States were to come to their assistance the nickname would catch. But true to the character history has painted, the Americans want nothing to do with the new European front. Granted, Britain does not stand alone – the smaller European countries are eager to raise arms at her side, as is a good portion of Africa and the Middle East – but the combined might of France and Germany is considerable and they seem to gain more allies with each passing day.
“If it makes you feel better,” attempts Sherlock, “the father is on a business trip. He’ll be back. She’ll be safe.”
John stifles a chuckle behind his fist. He knows he shouldn’t encourage Sherlock. Lestrade seethes. Molly covers her mouth with her hands and turns to hide her face. Sherlock turns back to his test tubes without another word. They take their time, dawdling until John’s cellphone calls him back to the clinic. Sherlock follows without question. John did not expect anything else. For better or for worse they are in this together, and will not be separated.
He grips the counter for a long moment. The throat clearing doesn’t even matter. John must have already given away too much. Was it an experiment, then, their fingers brushing? He aches as he takes plates out of the cabinet, forks from the drawers. John Watson’s Heart, A Dissertation. He tries to tell himself that it doesn’t matter, that nothing will change; even if Sherlock knows everything, he won’t care. It’s not like he’ll kick John out of the flat. It’s not like—Christ, John breathes, fuck. It’s not like he’ll take him away. From here. From him.
It is the first time they have said it aloud. They both stare into their laps for an indeterminable time. Finally Irene lifts her gaze. She swirls her drink once, twice. Runs her index finger along the rim. But nobody can dawdle forever.
“No, don’t be ridiculous. This has nothing to do with you.” He closes his eyes for a long moment. Tries to measure his breathing. It is difficult. He opens his eyes again. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock shakes his head. She drops her hand. “Like a fool,” he replies. “I’m afraid I’m rather unaccustomed to the feeling.”
“All right, all right.” If Sherlock doesn’t want to talk, he won’t; John lets it go. “You’re an arrogant prick, you know that?”
“I,” John says. “Well, yes, you’re right. I did know that. You didn’t have to tell me. It’s not as if I’d hoped…”
The actors are kissing now. Blue, so blue. And John thinks, how amazing are special effects these days. That he almost believes it.
He doesn’t give John time to react. With great effort he recovers his familiar icy composure. He sets down his teacup and looks at John over the crest of his nose. Now it’s your turn. Three years after a fall, you said. Explain. John puts down his teacup, too, because his hands are trembling. Sherlock swallows.
At one point, John remarks on how much calmer life has become, and Sherlock can only give a noncommittal nod. How should he know what life was before?
Silence, for a long time. Sherlock doesn’t look at him. Then, just as John is really sitting up, just as he’s about to ask again—
He puts down the violin. John shuts his book. A tacit invitation. Sherlock comes to the sofa. He draws his knees to his chest. Comfortable silence. He and John don’t like words. Too clumsy, unreliable, easily misinterpreted. John gets up to mind the stove and set the table. Chicken, potatoes; Sherlock rolls it around on his plate. Digestion requires sleep, after all.
He goes to the set of test tubes and plucks one at random. He swirls the liquid inside until it colors a pale blue. He reaches for the nearest pad of paper and jots down a few notes with the pen that Molly left behind. He is acutely aware of John, who for the meantime occupies himself circling the counters and squinting into the miscellaneous petri dishes. But then again, he is acutely aware of most things.
Morning comes and the pattern becomes inescapable. The waiting room of the clinic is cluttered with exhausted people collapsed in rows with their heads lolling on one another’s shoulders, skin as white as the plaster walls, their fingers and toes flushed and swollen, their nerves fine-tuned to the slightest pressure.
Sherlock suggests that they get some dinner, even though of course he is not hungry. It is really nothing more than a feeble attempt to ply the stricken expression from John’s eyes. Italian? If you say so. You can’t really be hungry. True. But you are. And he turns away from the surprised look John gives him. But he is thankful that something has replaced the grief.
The nurses regard Sherlock nervously, perhaps because he as cold and intimidating as he is handsome, or perhaps because he can deduce the last time they made love, with whom, and whether it was satisfying or not, simply from a glance at the color of their lipstick, or the angle of their breasts. To be fair, this would set anyone ill at ease.  It is obvious that Sherlock strikes a brilliant discord with the world. But together he and John seem to create a strange harmony. John is not sure what to make of it, but he finds it pleasant to the ears.
Sherlock nods, heart pounding. Admittedly, he isn’t sure about the bandage, but the rest seems to fit. The nurse smiles.
Sherlock wants to cheer. How stupid he was to even so much as consider that John might ask something so useless as what’s that or what are you studying. If only he could answer such an astute question as it rightly deserves.
John opens the fridge. Knuckles. Human. Half-frozen: unfreezing. Not there last night. Well. He butters Sherlock’s uneaten toast.
When Sherlock woke he was on a couch in the common room. The air reeked of beer and pot and his head spun. He blinked and saw Sally laughing with another man. Her skirt was hitched nearly to her hip. She was drunk. He staggered to his feet and tried to push the other man away. Sally screeched and spilled her drink. Her eyes were vacant. Sherlock began to understand.
“Explain, Sherlock,” he says in a low voice, tone steady but wrenched with desperation. “Please, Sherlock. You have to explain.”
And with that, the fluidity is gone. His eyes glitter again. Curiosity. The buzzing buzzing buzzing of wanting to know more, more, impossibly much. It must be so maddening. Never resting. Thinking. Thinking. The desperate pursuit of thought paused for a few moments between the frosty chords.
“John. It should not need to be said, but you are not to speak of this to anyone.” He looks down. “To be perfectly honest I’m not quite sure what I was thinking, showing this to you, after all.”
When John wakes, his hand is not on Sherlock’s hip. That’s the first thing he knows, and then, shifting, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, he thinks for a moment that Sherlock is gone, which is strangely not terrifying. It actually makes a curious sort of sense, feels almost reassuring. Sherlock wouldn’t be the type for a morning cuddle anyway—sad, that, but John will make do. He’s probably off doing research for the case. His old self, then. Everything is fine. Then John shifts awake a little more and realizes that Sherlock is still there, just far away, sitting on the very edge of the bed, naked, sheet around his waist, shoulders hunched, fingers steepled, looking at the wall, or at nothing.
“You’re just funny,” he explains feebly. “Most people don’t even think about that, breathing, whether it’s boring or not.”
Sherlock shrugs, eyes distant, nowhere close to John and yet, John has finally come to understand, in many ways as close to him as possible.
“And I, you,” he lies. Sherlock looks at him sharply. John ignores him. “Rumor has it you’re quite handy with the pipette.”
John cups his jaw gingerly. He feels as if the imprints of Sherlock’s fingertips had been welded into his skin. “What is what?”
Cornered. Sherlock is infinitely grateful that John does not understand what he is saying. He hopes he never will. He nods tersely. “I will give you that much.”
At first John is passionately angry. Then he gets a better glimpse of the pale alien face, of the dart and glitter of sharp eyes like colored marbles. He tastes warmth and life. The anger drains away. An instant of silence.
But when he dreams it is in terrible color. Grey, steel. There is a whirl of guns, bullets—no, more than that, sky and earth, dull beats of blue and green. John keels over into sand that is golden and seeps hotly into his knees. And then his body is cracking open, bones folding out in whittled, creamy ash peaks, and the red part is the shape of him, turned inside out and wrenched onto the sand.
the blue, the blue that eclipses John entirely. Their teeth clack together, Sherlock’s tongue lashes out, his fingers dig into John’s hair, and John is blue, nothing more, Sherlock groans against his mouth, he is blue and nothing more.
“Tell me,” demands Sherlock. And a demand it is; he looks at John as if to not comply would be the most enormous offense imaginable. “I want to know.”
His fingers are cold and John finds himself halfway across the clinic before his breath returns. They bob and weave quickly between the mattresses. Sherlock says nothing. In fact, he does not so much as look back over his shoulder while John stumbles over his own feet and tries to find the words to protest. Sherlock does not even seem to feel the need to ask for directions. Soon they are standing at the foot of the bed where the little girl is slipping between sleeping and waking. Her fever still rages. Her lips are dry and her breath whistles painstakingly between them.
At some point they’re kissing. It’s gotten easier, and the room spins a bit. Effect of the tranquilizer, rationalizes Sherlock. Maybe that’s not the whole story. He wants to sleep again. John is unbuttoning his shirt, innocently, like a parent to a child, and pulling him to his chest. He drowses, and for the first time in a while, he has the impression of a dream.
She leaves a little girl behind. It’s not elaborate, but there’s blood between her legs, and her nails are broken. She fought. John closes his eyes and breathes through his nose for a long moment. He doesn’t look at the girl in the corner. He doesn’t look at Sherlock. He walks onto the balcony while they finish gathering evidence. Sherlock finds him there afterwards, staring out over the ashy lawn.
Sherlock stares at him for a long moment. His expression is unreadable. Finally he blinks as if snapping from a dream and his upper lip curls. “Don’t be so dramatic.” An outright sneer. “It doesn’t suit you.”
He drowsed one afternoon in a pool of sunlight. His head was pillowed on his mother’s lap and her fingers were in his hair. He dreamt ideas, amorphous shapes and indefinite colors, nothing tangible. At some point the dreams broke into a rainy afternoon. An older boy was shaking him over and over. His face was fat and flushed and his wispy ginger hair was dark with rain. Frightened and confused, Sherlock acted on his first impulse. He bit mercilessly into the boy’s hand. Blood flooded his mouth. He felt nauseous. The boy howled.
“I don’t know,” he lies. Of course they will all die. Such is the magic of the disease. He knows that much better than anyone. But that is another story. One that perhaps he will never be able to confess. In any case, he cannot tell John. For all his fascinating unusual qualities, John is still an ordinary man at heart, and he subsists on hope in much the same way Sherlock does on black coffee and nicotine patches. To take hope away from him would leave him nothing put an empty shell.
“I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you.” John realizes that he must have sobbed the words, in the middle of it all. “God Sherlock I love you I love you I love—”
He takes an unsteady sip of tea, shuts his eyes, and talks. Refuses to think about what he’s saying. He stumbles through the beginning, but he says it all, even the parts that make John clear his throat, look away. His voice drops, grates; he can’t disguise the bitterness.
A few weeks have passed since the sick little girl first arrived in the clinic. A few weeks since Sherlock materialized at her bedside from somewhere deep in the cloak of night. A few weeks since John heard too much. And since then, Sherlock has made himself a constant presence. He stalks between the mattresses demanding information, flashing his authorization should anyone dare to refuse him. No one ever does, but rarely do they know the answers to his questions. And so after a few days he has largely taken to sitting resignedly at the girl’s bedside, jotting down notes and occasionally taking her pulse.
John is not sure whether, by “elsewhere,” Sherlock means another room, another flat, or another universe. All this over Thai takeaway, which is to say all this over the fact that John does not want Sherlock to die of malnutrition. It’s funny—hilarious, even—but he knows better than to laugh.
Three days later sees them on their way back to Baker Street. Sherlock is eager to see the flat again, this time with his memory returned. He wants nothing more than to run familiar eyes over familiar books and furniture and peeling wallpaper, and is positively delighted by the fact that he can finally explain the bullet holes and yellow spray paint on the far wall.
“You’re not my husband,” he whispers. He wants to bite his tongue. For a moment there is silence. John chuckles cautiously.
“Positively adorable,” he murmurs. The laughter fades from his voice. “Thank you, John.” He takes him by the collar and kisses him briefly. Their fingers wind together.
Holmes does not seem impressed. His upper lip curls in disgust and he gingerly plucks the other man’s hand from his lapel.
Sherlock watches as he weaves between the beds and disappears down the hallway. He is going to the morgue. Sherlock glances down at the still face of the little girl. Her skin is already yellowing in places. His stomach turns. Not disgust. Fear .
“Alright.” He rubs at his temple. “In any case, there will be paperwork. All sorts of such rubbish. I’ll get to work on that right now. Don’t worry, Sherlock.” He turns. His face is hidden from view. “You’ll get her in one piece, I promise. I would hate to get in the way of…whatever. Whatever it is. Doesn’t matter.” His shoulders bend with the weight of a sigh. “You have my word.”
John lurches upright and the medical dictionary falls to the floor. He swears quietly and picks it up, flipping once through the pages without really seeing them. He throws it onto the couch and runs a hand through his hair.
They leave the kitchen and Sherlock gestures down a short hallway that leads to his own bedroom. His lip curls in vague disgust and John gets the feeling that he doesn’t sleep very often. Doesn’t seem to be the type. Probably thinks the whole process to be a waste. Why sleep when he could be thinking. Deducing. Making discoveries. It doesn’t bother John. Each to their own. And besides, he doesn’t like sleeping much, either. Not these days, at least.
Even in the almost-darkness, he can see John’s jaw slacken in shock. Do they really have sex that often? Sherlock will have to do some research, evidently. He realizes with a jolt of shock that the idea sends his heart into his throat again. He swallows thickly and turns away, drawing the sheets closely around himself.
“Goodnight, John,” he manages, shuts his eyes. Silence stretches between them, and then Sherlock feels a hand come to rest at his forehead, feels fingers tentatively smoothing back his hair. His heart stutters.
“Nonsense,” continues John, but before Sherlock can intervene there is another knock at the door. This time Sherlock rolls his eyes and gives a terrific sigh as Molly lets in an older man with silver hair and a poorly tailored black suit.
When Mycroft leaves, Sherlock sweeps John into his arms and kisses him until neither of them can breathe, think, wonder, forget, remember, anymore.
“Yes. Of course.” Sherlock runs a hand through his hair. He swallows and the pale flesh of his neck contracts. “Follow me.”
“Thank you,” breathes Sherlock. He doesn’t know what else to say. John chuckles, and looks away. He’s happy. And that’s worth it. Even if Sherlock wakes up the next morning and he’s gone, it’s worth it. John’s happy, and it’s all because of him. He doesn’t understand it, but it’s worth it. It’s worth everything.
Once Mycroft goes, Sherlock stands by the window, watching the car slide away down Baker Street, shiny and black like an oil stain.
And he pauses, and John’s hope (the shape of sparks, yellow, skittering across his fingertips) catches on that tiny miracle: Sherlock Holmes, pausing. And then, Sherlock Holmes, coming alive, so alive with color he seems wreathed in it, black purple grief and orange yellow joy and red, red, pain and anger, and everything else imaginable and all of it impossibly intense and yet in every bit, in every single color, at the same time there is that lithe and lovely blue, the one John’s only read about in sonnets and seen in special effects, but never really, never really—except, of course, on his very own skin.
He intends to force Sherlock into explaining. He is not sure how this might be possible, but nevertheless he fully intends to do it. He tries to plan. Words fill his mouth. But then they step into the clinic. Then they step into the clinic. Then they step into the clinic, and the little girl is dead.
And then he is laughing. He is laughing and laughing and laughing. He can’t stop. Survival runs all the way to his very fingertips. His stomach aches with it. Survival, even if for only one more day. Gold and gold and gold and gold.
Sherlock snorts. “Don’t be. It’s completely acceptable. Very masculine, even, wanting to thoroughly examine and object of affection. It’s quite scientific, actually. I’d go so far as to say…”
And John knows, intuitively, that it is not a hallucination, it is not a ghost, it is not any of those many many soft grey dreams he half-hoped half-dreaded to one day stop having.
The other man was up for a fight, but Sally put her hand on his arm. “He’s not worth it,” she slurred. “Let’s get out of here, Anderson.” She stood, wavering, and spared a glance at Sherlock over her shoulder. No recognition. He was humiliated.
There is no small talk; the feeling grabs hold of him without so much as an introduction. It possesses him. It fills his mouth and nose and eyes and ears. He is fixated on John, on the tiny red dot wavering on his forehead. He sees his own expression reflected on his face when Moriarty grins and his eyes flicker upwards momentarily. It is not hard to deduce.
Sherlock manages to convince Angelo to dump the food into a brown paper page, and they head straight to Baker Street. They dodge the shadows that dusk blends into the horizon and duck inside just before the clouds break into a thin rain. Water trails along the windows as John fetches two plates and sets the kettle on to boil. Watching him, Sherlock thinks that he might even eat something.
“And what do they plan to do with the patients?” John takes a deep breath. “What do they plan to do with the people who haven’t shown symptoms yet?”
John shudders into an armchair. From the music comes the color and from Sherlock comes the music. Is this data of all possible data somehow insufficient?
Sherlock frowns. “Don’t. You have no reason. This is my fault. I involved myself.” He puts his hands in his pockets, drops his gaze to his feet. “I wasn’t expecting…all this.”
The nurse furrows her brow. “Your pulse is racing all of a sudden,” she says, and presses her palm to her forehead. “How do you feel?”
The rain strengthens. John is breathing hard. He kisses Sherlock’s cheek with startling tenderness, and asks if he’s alright, if it’s any good. Sherlock sighs. It’s fine, it’s perfect; he’s ready. John hoists up his knees and cradles his back carefully in his palms, as though he were made of porcelain. Sherlock wants to mutter something smart, but he’s out of air.
- but that morning, he stays. His fingers wind into Sherlock’s hair; he opens his mouth; one hand drops to the soft spot at the brittle curve of Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock feels dizzy. The light outside the window weakens; rain sings against the roof. He is breathless; that must be why he feels so desperately compelled to inhale John.
“For the love of god, John, don’t pretend to be any stupider than you already are. You know what I mean.”
Sherlock doesn’t see. John makes sure of that. He doesn’t see, does he? Would John know if he did? Maybe. Maybe. But, he reminds himself, he’s not even looking. Not even looking. No matter how much of a genius you are, it’s hard to see what you don’t ever think to look for.
John wants to ask what Mycroft apologized for, but he waits, knowing that Sherlock will tell him if he wants to tell him, that pushing him to talk will only unsettle the delicate balance of sincerity suspended between them. For a moment, Sherlock is still, sitting on the edge of the bed, and then he turns and meets John’s eyes for a split second. A violet shiver of need cuts across his cheek and somehow communicates itself directly to John, jutting deep into him. Then Sherlock is clambering across the mattress, kicking up the covers and crawling underneath. John shifts, lets himself be moved and molded until Sherlock is fitted against his side, not in his arms, exactly, but pressed up against him, the lines of their bodies perfectly parallel except for the meeting point of their ankles beneath the sheets.
“More,” he sobs in broken English. He seems to know his surroundings enough to understand who John is. “More, sir, you are a doctor, please, more. Make it stop.
They linger for as long as can be justified, drinking two rounds of espresso and splitting a slice of tiramisu. How Angelo still managed to get his hands on tiramisu will forever remain a mystery. They swallow the last bites with difficulty. Angelo seems as reluctant to bring the check as they are to receive it. They stretch the evening thinner with a few desperate snippets of conversation. Then they can pretend no more. Angelo waves farewell as they finally step out onto the street.
It is one of those mornings when he and John wake up on opposite sides of the bed; late on a Saturday with rainy sunlight trickling through the windowpane to puddle silver on the floor. Sherlock is comfortably warm. John is quiet except for the rise and fall of his shoulders, the whisper of his breathing across the pillow. His back is turned. Sherlock – unsettled by having lived so long in a world he doesn’t remember - wants to reach for him, to touch the anchor in the dream, absorb his tangibility. He rises onto one elbow.
Three more. Three more clustered in the lobby with wan faces and hollow cheekbones. Three more with swollen fingers and toes. Three more with skin so sensitive that they cry out at the touch of a fingertip. Three more with fear in their eyes. But this time they have papers. This time they have stories. This time it will be unimaginably worse. John stares at Sherlock with terror in his eyes. And Sherlock can do nothing but grit his teeth and wonder at the irony.
Sherlock watches her and realizes that the father is dead, he was shot down in combat at least a month ago, but she still hasn’t told the boy because she can’t bear it, she is weak and exhausted, and does not want to hear him cry. He is struck by a profound disgust. When John asks him about it he shakes his head and tells him that it was nothing. John should not be weighed down by the miserable, private insanities of humanity. Such is Sherlock’s lot in life and he will not inflict it upon others. Or at least not upon John. Not unless he asks.
?” He gestures to the trio of test tubes suspended in the center of the glass case. “What sort disease is that?”
“Correct. You are so terribly clever.” She folds the paper crisply along the creases and tucks it back into her breast pocket. “Sherlock. What is the meaning of this?”
The dance eases; silence clings to the room, to Irene and Sherlock’s bodies. It’s over, but it does not feel merciful to John. On Irene’s face there is something almost light, a sort of sharp and expanding comprehension. A not-quite-sunrise.
John nods, thinking of the episodes he still has, where his skin flares so bright that he can’t see or think, can barely breathe, and he has to turn away from the world—on a case, tucking himself into phone booths or alleyways, at home, turning his face into the back of the sofa or locking himself in their room, lights off blinds shuttered. The sort of viscerality behind the sickness, the pure, vicious experience of it, is a constant in his life, at once a reality more real than any other and completely untenable; it makes Sherlock who he is, and it is almost always unspeakably beautiful, so ferociously alive, and John loves it, loves it infinitely, needs it. Still, the moments where it's too much, where it overflows even Sherlock's capacities—these moments are agony, utterly. They are all the more excruciating because there is so little to be done; John can shelter Sherlock on the street, can type softly for him to hear in the living room, can massage his temples in their bedroom, but he can't make it stop, not entirely. John hates feeling helpless; it goes against all of his instincts as a doctor, and as a person who loves.
But it was always like that, everyone but Sherlock.  He was an exception. Born to break the rules. He thought about this at night as he tried not to sleep. He didn’t want to wake to another contorted reality. Maybe the brand of tea his mother liked would change. But maybe his father would be sitting beside her at the kitchen table alive and well. Maybe they wouldn’t even recognize him. Maybe he wouldn’t be their son any longer.
“It being an infant hardly makes it more or less deserving than an adult human,” he says. “It simply hasn’t been given the chance to ruin something.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak, but the words die, John can see them die on his lips, can imagine their crumpled bodies falling into the narrowness between them, and isn’t that just perfect for them, those tiny deaths before this comes into being, whatever it is, before John looks at Sherlock there is dying, words dying, words becoming nothing in those several heartbeats before they meet each other’s eyes and John lifts Sherlock’s wrist, which he is still holding, with its jumping pulse, before John lifts Sherlock’s wrist which he is still holding with its jumping pulse and to the culmination of his skeleton, the tender small meeting places of bone and skin, presses his mouth and sucks.
“I’ll tell him.” He surrenders. “No use souring his opinion of you as well. He grows close to so few.”
“Sherlock.”  John leans forwards. He looks like he wants to take his hands. Hesitation. Sherlock reaches out and takes his, instead. Palms callused, tired, warm. Familiar. John tenses, but doesn’t draw away.
John gives him a curious look, but he does not seem displeased. Sherlock finishes the last slice of his orange and shrugs. It is unusual that he should have to feign nonchalance. But it is hard to remain removed from someone like John.
Later that night, John still doesn’t feel like cooking—only eggs in the morning, eggs in the morning—so he gets Thai takeaway. He’s on the phone with the restaurant when he pauses for a long moment. Then, he orders for two. Sherlock drew a lot of blood that day, he should eat something. The food comes, and John goes into the sitting room and puts a carton of pineapple fried rice at Sherlock’s elbow. He does not look at it. An hour later, he has not so much as unwrapped the chopsticks.
People like Sherlock and Irene – and Moriarty, too, but that’s another story – have a way of finding each other, and the moment Sherlock walked into her classroom he found himself the subject of an interest that was as sharp as that of his psychiatrist but benevolent, perhaps even admiring. Irene called him over after class and smiled. He would never forget that, the quirk of her lips, crimson and suggestive. He wasn’t imagining it.
“She just existed,” begins the old man. “She was there in the morning and still there in the afternoon and in the evening and stealing my pillow at night. I breathed for her and she breathed for me. I’m sorry, it’s hard to describe…” His voice swells with a chuckle. “We never talked about it much, you see. We didn’t have to. We were rubbish for words, anyways. We knew each other as we knew ourselves. She was familiar like the back of my hand. Is that the old saying? Or was it different?” He shakes his head. “Irrelevant. She was always there. Her presence grew to be both as essential and unnoticed as…as the presence of my heart, or my lungs. We never remember that they’re there keeping us alive.” He smiles. “They simply are. They just exist. So did she.”
“Just as I’ve showed you how to do all this time—tirelessly, and out of pure love, I might add—even though you never quite listened, but now you see the error of your ways, and you will do as I suggest?”
“So do you,” replies John. He isn’t wrong. But Sherlock always only looks exhausted. The frenetic pace of his mind does not allow such luxuries as tiredness. “But I suppose you’re right.”
John is stunned to see that the owner knows Sherlock. He booms and claps him on the shoulder, and ushers them over to a choice table in a secluded corner. He even deposits a little candle in the center of the red checked cloth. John shrugs out of his jacket and hangs it on the back of his chair. Sherlock straightens his cuffs and rests his chin atop the steeple shape he makes with his fingers.
Sherlock tells Lestrade to fuck off. He does, and John is silent. Nobody has been unpleasant to him since he got back from Afghanistan. It feels ugly. And is that—it is. At his wrist, a purpling bloom of irritation. He watches, waiting for the color to be sucked away, not sure whether to be relieved or not when it goes.
His eyes are sad; he turns to leave. Were Sherlock not so dizzy with pain and shock he would’ve reached out to stop him. He wants to scream in frustration but his throat is cracked and dry. John is wrong. He doesn’t know. He needs to know.
They’re sitting in their chairs, and John is working on his next blog post, and Sherlock is thinking, or hallucinating, or performing cellular respiration or whatever it is he does when he steeples his fingers like that, and then John feels, like intuition but sharper, clearer still, the weight of Sherlock’s gaze. He almost looks up, almost laughs, almost says, “What, do I have something on my face?”
“I really do need her,” he emphasizes rather feebly. “I can’t…look, I can’t say why, not yet at least. I wish I could. But it’s very important, you see. I’m sorry. I know that this rubs you the wrong way, that it somehow goes against your morals. Oh, don’t look at me like that!” He tugs on the lock of hair between his thumb and index finger. “I am sorry.”
John brings the plates back to the sitting room. Sherlock does not look at him. Which is just like always. It’s just like always, and relief comes to John with a loneliness so perfect that it feels like something breaking, flooding him until he understands the weight of his own body as only that of who he is, of his love, and the impossibility of sharing them. Sherlock, I love you I love you I love you I love I love I love—
“I don’t,” says John, confused, stupid, because it is the only way he can be in that moment even though he knows everything Sherlock really means. “Expect color, Sherlock, I know you, I wouldn’t—”
“John,” says Sherlock, and some things never change: John rolls his eyes, but he saves a draft of his next blog post, folds up his laptop, and retreats upstairs, leaving the older and younger boy to whatever it is they have to say to one another.
She wanders into the clinic clutching her hands together in front of her chest as if caught halfway through a prayer. Veins bulge sickly blue and purple from her wrists and fingers. She is wearing a pink cotton dress and her face and lips are stained with ash. The nurses swoop down on her like birds of prey, their crisp caps and pressed white skirts flared to ward off competitors. She begins to cry.
“Don’t be absurd. Of course I can. For example, when we met yesterday I saw your desire to stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. Or don’t you recall? It’s still there, by the way. And yet, you have done no such thing. So, what does that tell us? That you are brave? That you are a coward? Or perhaps you are waiting for a sign. From all we can learn from colors, it is just as likely that you are done waiting and are simply too apathetic to do away with your own miserable existence. But is that the case, really? I don’t know. I simply do not. And I suspect that neither do you.”
She seems to bloom at the praise, color flooding her cheeks, her eyes kindling. John smiles sympathetically and takes her hand.
Another nurse swoops into the room just as he finishes wiping his eyes on the edge of the sheet, bewildered. He prays she will not give him another injection. He wants to be awake; he feels fine, albeit thirsty. Always thirsty. She brings him another cup of cold water and does not try to fill his veins with morphine. He takes an instant shining to her. She is jotting down notes on a clipboard when he dares to ask for John.
