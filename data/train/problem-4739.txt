Chuck disappeared with a smile.
Faith eyed the machete he was still holding, “Fine. It will take at least a week for the letter to reach my parents.”
“I’ll make sure Michael and Lucifer can contact me before I leave,” Chuck offered.
Faith rolled her eyes at Dean as he brushed past her. She greeted Charlie happily and pulled Sam into a hug.
Castiel shrugged, “I doubt it would change anything.”
“Cas, you have my permission, so let’s do this.”
“Raphael is dead,” Castiel reminded her father.
“Why don’t you go upstairs and sort the place out?” Sam asked curiously.
Gabriel chose not to remind his brother of how transparent his thoughts were without his Grace blocking the signal. Castiel was thinking of ‘humanity’, but he really meant Dean Winchester.
“Sure, no concerns about the memories of you picking up women, watching porn or sleeping around?” Sam replied sarcastically.
Faith pulled him aside while Dean was making suggestions and arguing over the definition of ‘girly’ drinks with Gabriel.
Faith giggled into her pillow as Castiel offered his internal opinion.
“Dean, this is your bed,” Castiel pointed out, “You can sit up here; I’ll move if my proximity makes you uncomfortable.”
While Adam ate the lunch that Gabriel provided, Chuck explained that across the world, communities which existed in harmony with nature were being guarded by Angels. They had significantly higher proportions of fertile people and were in danger of being exploited by others.
“Gabriel is hugging him,” Castiel added, “Maybe this will comfort Lucifer somehow?”
“About three hundred years,” Samandriel answered, “I’m not sure if Michael left him in a dream-state while he was fighting with Lucifer, or if he was aware of the passage of time.”
“Dad just creates a new reality, which diverges from the original at the point of change,” Gabriel explained, “He only let off one ‘Big-Bang’, and all the parallel realities were created when he interfered. I’m sure we’ve had this discussion already.”
“Ignore him, Dean,” Castiel advised wearily, “He enjoys making you uncomfortable.”
“How detailed are the new memories of me and Ruby?” Sam asked worriedly.
“I should be human, like in that other timeline,” Castiel argued, “But this time I won’t have sex with a woman possessed by a Reaper. Does that make her my sister or a cousin?”
“I have forgiven Father for my time in the Cage,” Lucifer admitted, “But forcing me to experience the human digestive system is a whole new grudge.”
Dean went for a shower after he had finished eating. By the time he returned with a clean-shaven chin and damp hair, Sam was waiting for him in the hall.
Michael said quietly,
Dean would only realize Castiel was viewing a memory when images surfaced in his consciousness. After the fifteenth time he had to guide Castiel out of his teenage memories, he was becoming quite frustrated.
“Not yet. My penance in Purgatory was cut short, and this will suffice in the meantime,” Castiel explained, “How are Dean and Sam faring?”
“My orders were to retrieve you from Hell,” Castiel said flatly, “But your soul is the brightest, most compelling thing I have ever seen. I chose to infuse your soul with my Grace, and I don’t regret it.”
“The changes will be external for the most part,” Castiel recalled, “I expect it to be painful.”
Gabriel could feel the approach of something huge. Dread began to grow in the pit of his stomach. He didn’t realize he was searching for his Flock telepathically until Castiel’s voice sounded in his head, enquiring why he was worried.
“No,” Gabriel answered mysteriously.
“We gave up on him,” Sam added.
“With humans?” Balthazar clarified dubiously.
“Watching humanity panic has been rather entertaining,” Lucifer admitted.
“We used to display our wings like butterflies, using our Grace to manifest the colours. Grace-sharing was between close friends, and some Angels even bonded in pairs. Lucifer changed that,” Michael explained, “Many of the Angels who shared Grace with him, rebelled with him and were killed. I didn’t want those ideas spreading further.”
Castiel was passive in her mind, though she could feel the relief in the Angel as she settled next to Dean.
Faith stood up and kept her restrained wrists against her chest, “I don’t want to hurt anyone, or get my head chopped off. Just chain me up. Now!”
“I have too many realities to watch over,” Chuck explained, “Some are self-sufficient, but not enough.”
The café was called Eugenie’s and seemed nice enough. Faith sat down in the area Gabriel had described and waited.
Each time manipulation was an adventure and he liked being constantly surprised by humans and Angels. The Winchesters tearing up the plan had left the Angels floundering, but Chuck had been enthralled. Past disappointments had transformed into hope the first time a manipulation spawned a parallel Universe after the averted Apocalypse.
“It’s genetic,” Charlie decided, “Go find your woman with the sexy butt, before Dean and Castiel have their awkward reunion.”
“I think I want to get drunk again,” Castiel decided.
“Someone had to,” Lucifer muttered.
Faith blurts out the details of the proposed meeting in a rush. Gabriel teleported them to the park to await the Nephilim.
“What is television like, now?” Faith asked curiously.
“Do I hold some sort of record, now?” Adam joked weakly.
“Is that because you know that no human should ever have to make such decisions?”
“There is a secret Department in Heaven, set up just before I left,” Gabriel explained, “The Angel in charge, Naomi, tortures any Angel who shows evidence of free will, and removes memories to ensure compliance. Castiel has been in that place more times than any other Angel. He was forced to kill Samandriel and report your every move to Naomi. The cuffs are the only thing keeping him cut off from Heaven and out of the torture chamber.”
“I mentioned Michael and Lucifer,” Chuck explained as he prodded at his plate of pancakes, “And implied they would be running Heaven in the future.”
“No,” Castiel said flatly.
Dean saw the shift in expression a moment before Castiel reached for him. The smirk on the feminine face was unmistakably Castiel.
“I’ve been furious for so long,” Lucifer said thoughtfully, “Now, I’m empty.”
Castiel had just enough time to turn around before Dean pulled him into a fierce hug.
Sam sagged back onto the lounge heavily and Chuck disappeared.
Meg eyed her from head to toe, “Cute, but I preferred your previous vessel.”
“Everyone who helped me was killed,” Lucifer said flatly.
“The Angels were almost extinct in the future; one of Chuck’s conditions for sending me back was to stop the fall. Without Abaddon in the way, there is no need for you to bear the Mark of Cain,” Gabriel explained patiently, “So much of the next few years can be completely avoided because of a few small changes.”
“Will I be able to see True Forms soon?” Dean wondered.
Sam listened to Lucifer mutter his disinterested agreement while he struggled to answer the question.
“Sometimes, you remind me of Michael,” Gabriel said snidely.
“He had twenty-three feathers ripped out with pliers,” the Archangel said quietly.
“You are not an abomination, Sam,” Gabriel sighed, “The fact that such a pure soul was made to think so poorly of himself is the real crime, and you are not to blame for that.”
“Chuck?” Dean growled, “CHUCK?!”
“Try it before you discount it,” Gabriel advised, “Humans pretend they are civilised, but under the surface it’s all about needs; sex, food and sleep.”
“Is saying ‘hello’ no longer sufficient?” Michael asked as he was released.
Faith knew the impending separation would be not be pleasant and was quite unavoidable. When she turned to see Sam staring at her longingly, she could only offer him a small smile.
Castiel reached out toward Gabriel with his free hand. Gabriel caught it with both of hands.
“Yes; I stuffed him in a pocket Universe to spin his wheels for a while,” Gabriel replied easily, “That man has serious issues; no wonder you two are so screwed up.”
“I had one from Cas for a while; they can be healed eventually,” Dean offered.
“Who’s Grace?” Faith asked Sam quietly.
Around midnight, Sam’s prone form shifted abruptly, eyes shining in the darkness.
“I found a secret passage,” Faith revealed with an excited grin, “There’s all sorts of books and weird stuff in there.”
“Me?” Lucifer repeated, “Gross.”
Faith felt a second person catch her ankles. Sam’s scent reached her a moment later. She reached out blindly and caught his shoulder with both hands. By the time she was lowered onto the waiting bed her fingers were pressed into his neck, her fingertips seeking his rapid pulse.
“Sam agrees with me,” Gabriel said slyly.
“Pick up the feathers,” Gabriel instructed someone.
“I don’t seem to get more than two words in a row,” Dean said between mouthfuls of pancakes.
The Vampire nest was a complete disappointment. Once the wards were destroyed, Balthazar announced that the building was empty.
Sam made a wounded noise, “Bobby’s in Hell? No!”
Castiel could only shake her head and stare at the tabletop.
“Has been moved to a holding area; Loki can escort him upstairs when he wants to make his dramatic return.”
Lucifer spend three days scouring books, swearing at the content and then crossing out the lies. He inserted corrections on the lined paper Gabriel provided. The Bible was thrown in the bin as a complete loss.
“Yes, ma’am.”
Sam would later argue that he did not make a conscious decision to limit the power of the Archangel. He realized that Lucifer needed to be separated from his abilities, at least long enough to deal with the emotions which had festered for so long.
Balthazar and Castiel disappeared down the hallway while Dean argued with Gabriel. The Hunter was abruptly silenced when he was presented with a debit card.
Lucifer snorted derisively, “More like he knew the Universe couldn’t survive two of you.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “I believe you.”
Gabriel promised.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “Your obsession with sex is disconcerting.”
“And they wonder why people mistake them for serial killers,” Faith joked to Castiel.
Kevin and Linda sat as far from Meg as possible. Though the Prophet had met her before, his experiences with Demons had soured his opinion of her.
“Hold on, little brother,” the tense Archangel replied, “We’ll be home in a flash.”
“Or it could be Chuck declaring that pineapple of a pizza is a sin,” Dean joked. He craned his neck toward the kitchen with blatant curiosity.
Samandriel was not particularly interested in the fights occurring in the gym; he had been a soldier long enough that violence was not something he could enjoy.
“I am the worst Angel in history, including Lucifer,” Cas said miserably, “I rebelled, started a civil war, allied with the King of Hell, loosed Leviathans into the world, deceived my friends and killed my fellow Angels. These thoughts are not new, Dean.”
“I liked that one,” Amara decided.
Dean called Gabriel a strong of rude names, surged to his feet and stomped away.
“He calls himself Jack Winchester,” Chuck said shortly, “If you’re unlucky enough, he might drop in on this Universe one day.”
“Eat something,” Gabriel said with a grin, “Try my top ten favourite foods and you’ll soon understand why I love humanity.”
Sam laughed, “I was quoting you; well, the hallucination of you.”
“I can see how that would be an issue,” Gabriel agreed.
Faith’s link was tucked in predictably close to Sam’s. Her voice, when he chose to listen, was rather muted. Gabriel assumed her Vampiric heritage was to blame.
Lucifer smiled, “Yep; he’s the sensible Archangel. Even I didn’t predict that when he tried to eat clouds.”
Gabriel found Crowley interesting. For an Archangel who had been alive for billions of years and exploring Earth for thousands, it was a definite compliment.
“It took us a while to find it; I only know about it because of the memory updates,” Sam explained.
him to have another chance to destroy the world?”
“So have you.”
“I’m assuming you had a strange urge to check the records of this place this morning?” Gabriel continued.
Annoyance crossed the face of the Archangel, “A broken heart. By the time I was killed, he was already depressed enough to bargain his life away. Had the opportunity came up, he would have swapped his existence for oblivion without hesitating.”
“Yes, it does,” Dean replied flatly.
“It’s hinted at the books, and obvious when Dean and Castiel are in the same room,” Charlie agreed, “I’m not into guys, and Castiel makes me wish I was.”
’. Lucifer met Sam’s gaze and repeated with all the sincerity he could muster, “I’m sorry. I know you hate me, and can never forgive me, but I wanted to apologize before I leave this reality. I am truly sorry.”
“I agree,” Sam added, “I can’t listen to any more interviews with Chuck without being partially off my face.”
A small cough heralded the successful application of the counter-spell. Wavy brown hair swayed, and a pair of deep blue eyes peered up at the two Hunters.
Sam frowned at the Archangel, “What so wings have to – no; I still don’t want to know.”
“I can be a woman,” Gabriel offered with a smirk, “Father showed me some short-cuts which would have been so useful back in the sixties.”
Gabriel chuckled and Crowley was clearly impressed.
“Could you have gone back further?” Dean asked thoughtfully, “To stop Sam dying so I didn’t go to Hell in the first place?”
“Most Angels are very arrogant and think humans are only slightly more evolved than apes,” Faith explained.
“He was in the Cage for over a year and was so scarred that he went insane!” Dean spat.
Michael glanced away, regret easy to read on his face, “I didn’t ask questions about her methods; I was desperate to save the remaining Angels from the poison Lucifer had spread.”
“You will be informed of Father’s plans when the time is right,” the Archangel said in a commanding tone.
Faith smiled as she recalled family dinners with her parents and extended family during holidays; they were only silent when food was being devoured. It was reassuring to realize some things did not change over time.
“It’s a human thing,” Gabriel explained, “An interest in sex is a part of the transition from childhood to adulthood.”
“No hidden fantasies about horny Angels?” Meg teased.
“They both need a good kick in the backside,” Gabriel declared, “I’d turn Dean into a woman, but he’s so stubborn, he’d be a lesbian.”
Castiel didn’t know how to escape the dread which weighed him down. The images from the nightmares were all linked to the memories he had acquired, or already had.
Castiel sent back,
Lucifer sighed, “Your Flock leader is an annoying little shit.”
“It’s not possible to force an Angel to take a vessel,” Gabriel clarified, “I’ll need your help to convince him to cooperate.”
Sam leaned forward, “There are realities with no Archangels?”
Dean switched his gaze to the woman sprawled over him, “You’re watched orgies?”
Faith confided that Linda reminded her of her aunt, and she had been unable to control the tears at that point.  Jane was equally drawn to Linda, as she had lost her mother on the day she was born.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Cas?” Dean gasped.
“I tried that once,” Gabriel revealed, “Not my style. Castiel, are we moving you into Dean? I must say, everyone who sees you two gazing at each other assumes you’ve been in him at some stage.”
Castiel sighed and closed his eyes again, “What do you want, Gabriel?”
“I’m not sure, yet.”
“Father has returned,” Cas whispered.
Castiel nodded, “Without your consent it would be a violation.”
“Hurry back,” Rowena replied sweetly.
“Don’t judge me.”
Gabriel sighed, “If I can.”
“Nothing,” Sam replied quickly. He pulled his shoulder away from Dean to remove his shirt from the grasping fingers. The angry glare from his older brother was equally unavoidable.
“That’s a very bad idea,” Sam warned.
Sam remained unamused, his back against the wall and his arms crossed over his chest.
The lack of reaction convinced the Hunter that the creature was dead, or the spell was still in place. He headed back upstairs to search for a key to the door.
A circular burn appeared on the inside of Adam’s wrist.
Cas flopped back onto the bed while Dean backed out of the room, his skin alarmingly pale.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Michael regarded Gabriel with confusion. Gabriel sighed and pulled the taller man into a hug. After a few moments, Michael patted his back tentatively.
Kevin sat between Jane and Faith, his eyes darting between the three Archangels regularly. He was clearly upset about something.
Humans were flawed creatures, and so was every Angel he had ever met. At least humans didn’t pretend they were perfect to maintain a shared delusion.
“Well, Castiel has given me a taste for Angels,” Meg said with a smirk.
Gabriel was extremely bored. The Winchesters were interviewing witnesses and connecting bodies to their Werewolf hunt. Apparently, it was interesting because the kills were happening throughout the month rather than just at the full moon.
“I think Lucifer has found an aspect of humanity he approves of,.” Gadreel observed.
Lucifer frowned, “That was annoying. I tried reasoning with Michael before I was tossed out of Heaven; it’s useless.”
Dean surged forward and took control, “That’s enough from the peanut gallery.”
Sam and Faith were planning to retire at midnight, though sleep was not their top priority.
Jane wanted to help, but she was the third wheel. She could see the tendrils of their souls wrapping together neatly in a glowing dance invisible to mortals.
Castiel knew Dean sensed his amusement, whether through the bond or by clues in his expression.
“Male or female strippers?” Sam asked with a smirk.
Sam gulped, “Yes; but we stay together.”
“And consuming the remains of a pig is more important?” Gadreel questioned.
“Colonel Sanders learned the hard way not to underestimate your girlfriend,” Dean joked.
“Talk it over with Gabriel,” Lucifer suggested, “I’m not meeting with Father until dusk.”
Watching Gabriel flirt with Rowena was rather entertaining. Castiel had learned about short-term courtship from the Winchester brothers, and Faith had assured him there was more to a long-term relationship.
“Dean took some clothes off,” Castiel offered innocently.
“You are so very wrong,” Gabriel replied with a wink, “I could put a pole in here if you ever want to give Dean a show.”
He was mollified by the certainty that Cas felt the same way.
“You both had the sense to know that risking Michael and Lucifer escaping would have been incredibly stupid,” Gabriel surmised, “Wait until he wakes up to kick yourselves.”
Cas watched Dean hide his head under a pillow, “I’m making you uncomfortable,” she realized.
“Can a Vampire starve to death? Who knows what a half-Vampire could survive?” Sam mused aloud, “If the spell held, she could be perfectly healthy.”
Castiel enjoyed kissing Dean far more than his experience with Meg. Even though he didn’t need to breathe, he was soon drawing in air in short bursts.
“The physics of multiple Universes and time travel has that affect,” Gabriel agreed with a smile.
Sam was annoyed that Kevin and his mother were going to get an instant trip to the bunker while he had to go to St. Louis. Dean had not known any details on what the problem was, only that James Frampton needed help.
Gabriel arrived back at the bunker in time to hear genuine laughter from Dean and Meg. He was relieved that no-one had resorted to violence.
“Some abandoned factory,” Dean supplied, “Angels seem to like crappy hideouts.”
Castiel held out his hand toward Dean, who regarded the limb warily. The Angel wondered if something distasteful had materialised on his fingers.
The stubborn defiance in Castiel’s face sent a surge of pride through Dean, “No idea,” the Angel replied honestly.
“Did Cas get an update?” Sam asked wearily. He had his arm over his eyes to block the light.
“I’m fine with avoiding the trials, but I’m not kissing you, Crowley,” Dean warned.
“I could leave, if you don’t want to talk to me,” Sam mused, “I thought you wanted some form of contact; I could leave you my lectures from Stanford, but memorising any would have been boring, so they would be quite fragmented. I could share my Cage memories, but you think most of them were not real -”
Sam disappeared into the horrible box and the door slammed shut.
Faith moaned involuntarily at the taste. She could only compare it to crossing a desert, finding an oasis and diving in.
“Or he’ll make her mute,” Sam mused.
Gabriel waved a hand, and the bucket became empty and clean again. Castiel had earned his hangover but the Archangel was not going to tolerate the stench being produced.
“She is willing to help a friend, until I convert Jimmy into Jemima,” Gabriel confirmed, “Castiel has this weird power to make people fall all over themselves wanted to help him. It’s bloody irritating. I can’t leave Castiel in the vessel while I do the conversion; he is struggling to cope as it is.”
“I’m a crappy brother, alright?” Gabriel huffed, “But I’m trying to be better.”
Gabriel checked in on the couple and ascertained that they were still bonding. He was pleased with the progress they had made in a single day. His other pet project was not faring as well.
“That’s very patronising,” Castiel pointed out.
“Heaven has not ‘decayed’!” Michael protested, “Once Father left, I had to alter how the garrisons were managed to prevent chaos!”
Dean gaped at the Archangel, “Balthazar? Didn’t Cas kill him? Won’t he be pissed?”
“Would you believe that?” Gabriel asked. An orange jellybean flew up into the air before dropping nearly into his mouth.
The Dhampir had no interest in exploring pornography, so she had suggested he wait until she was asleep to work on that project.
Sam put aside the laptop in favour of a book on Angels. If something was messing with Cas, they needed to help him.
“Dean wants to know why Chuck is bothering with this,” Michael said from the opposite side of Gabriel to Lucifer, “It does seem pointless.”
Castiel glanced at the single hand he could see gripping the blanket as Gabriel struggled and failed to control his mirth.
Castiel sat up gingerly. He could feel the cold sweat on his skin as heavily as the concerned gaze of the Dhampir.
, Sam?” Lucifer sighed.
“Wow,” Dean managed.
The idea of being human again was interesting, even if the only goal was to get away from Crowley’s influence. The chance to go to Heaven after a mortal life was so bizarre, she could barely contemplate it.
When he had spoken out against Michael, Balthazar had stood firm next to him and waited for death. Only Gabriel’s intervention had saved Castiel from being killed on the spot.
Lucifer slouched on the lounge near his brother. Gadreel was patrolling the perimeter, the skills of his previous job too ingrained to ignore.
Dean recognised the mounting anxiety in his sibling. He appreciated the reaction, even if he didn’t share it. The Dhampir was either dead or going to live; worrying wouldn’t impact anything.
“I’m here, Cas,” Dean assured him, “You saved us in true Winchester fashion; by being an idiot.”
“Keep it down, knuckleheads,” he called irritably.
“I don’t know,” Castiel’s gaze flicked to the arm Dean was resting across the back of the couch, now that Meg had left space for him to stretch out, “Faith has a theory.”
Castiel was not sure how to keep Dean’s soul close without it seeking out tendrils of his Grace.
Castiel was sipping something non-alcoholic, citing a need to wake up without vomiting. Had she been in her make form, Dean would have argued. Instead, the Hunter remained silent.
“Your interest in my relationship with Dean is becoming rather irritating,” Castiel pointed out with a disapproving frown.
“Yeah,” Sam sighed, grasping the chains in his fists to keep his balance, “Where are we?”
Gabriel was still glaring at the weary man, “You’re planning to suffer every second of a human lifespan because you feel guilty? You had no choice but to kill Raphael; I wish I had been there to give you another option than Purgatory.”
Gabriel nodded, “And there is another plausible explanation; the Cage was designed to contain and torment Lucifer. Sam was his vessel; the Cage itself may be responsible for most of Sam’s suffering, to deny Lucifer a potential ally.”
“Not Dean,” Gabriel revealed, “Sam has the hots for Faith.”
Gabriel waited patiently, sensing that Lucifer was not waiting for a response.
“And your brother is a jerk,” Faith said to Castiel.
“This is Gabriel,” Sam continued as the woman leaned as far from the Archangel as she could in the handcuffs which restrained her.
Dean knew Samandriel was offering a smile as a sign of encouragement, but the whole situation still felt strange. It didn’t help that Cas was lying on her back, so Samandriel’s chin was obscured by a pair of breasts.
“Are you finished throwing tantrums?” Sam demanded harshly, “Losing your temper every time someone disagrees with you is just childish.”
“There is definitely something under the floor,” Jane warned.
Chuck appeared near Gabriel and greeted the Hunters with a genuine smile, “Hello Sam, Dean. Gabriel tells me that you want to critique my plans as though you have the ability to stop me.”
“Dean, I spent years in Hell fighting my way to you and more fighting my way out. I’ve seen enough not to be intimidated by anything you imagine or dream.”
“Probably not, but if you form a Flock with me, you’ll have to learn about wing-grooming.”
Gabriel was humming to himself contentedly when Dean threw open the bathroom door and stomped into the room with a towel wrapped around his waist.
The Archangel was tempted to do something obnoxious, especially when Castiel pushed Dean back against the lounge and straddled his lap.
“So, figure out a way to stop him; stuff him in the Cage or rip out his Grace and send him to Earth as a human.”
Castiel propped his elbows up on the table and buried his face in his palms.
“Why not go back to before Dean sold his soul?” Faith asked.
Dean finished his meal in silence. By the time he deposited the empty wrappers back in the bag, Castiel had his eyes closed. His hands were resting on his torso.
“Time travel gives me a headache,” Faith decided.
Beyond Faith, Sam was asleep. Dean recognised his ridiculous hair even when his face was hidden.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Come on, Dean,” Gabriel coaxed, “It’s all right to be screwed up, as long as you are aware of it and don’t let the trauma screw up your life. Sam resents John Winchester and feels guilty for not loving him; how messed up is that?”
“It’s not really thwarted,” Gabriel corrected, “It’s still there, unchanged; this one branched off.”
“Do you think hosting Lucifer is a bad idea?”
Michael kept a close eye on Naomi and stuffed her in the Cage when she tried to incite a Civil War.
“I wanted it,” Sam said flatly.
“Never!” Gabriel scoffed, “Jane is fascinating, and quite charming. Too bad she avoids you like the plague.”
Sam felt his appetite vanish, “On the night I killed Lilith, in the voicemail.”
Castiel took control a moment after Faith realized she did not want to be the focus of an annoyed Archangel.
Sam shrugged, “Also hooks and chains.”
“Why do you still care?”
“They’re sensitive, but not that fragile,” Cas assured him with a smile, “If any feathers are broken or twisted, do this.”
“No,” Castiel responded. To the Hunters, it sounded like a plea rather than a denial.
Sam gulped noticeably, “All the time?”
“Only if you never refer to us as ‘the vessels’ ever again,” Dean complained, “Yes.”
Gabriel snorted, “Give Castiel another hour and he’ll be all set.”
“Lay down properly and sleep for a few hours,” Castiel instructed firmly.
“Adam,” Michael greeted, his voice slightly deeper than that of his vessel.
Castiel ignored the irritation she felt due to Dean’s sudden departure from her personal space. Gabriel had shared a few tips to help her fully experience emotions and sensations without her Grace numbing her vessel.
“You would have to ask him that. Is it the thought of intimacy with another male which disturbs you?”
“Ten years is a short time to someone as old as the Universe,” Dean said worriedly, “Why didn’t you mention that you were dying?”
Lucifer snorted with amusement, “I’m imagining your reaction if Satan dropped into a dream to talk about his feelings.”
“Time to handcuff the lady to the bed,” Dean announced. His tone suggested it was something he did every evening.
“You’re just as cursed, no matter what the name,” Gabriel said dismissively, “Samandriel is your Guardian Angel, so be nice. Dean stabbed his Angel before he knew his name.”
“Stop using my Grace!” Lucifer hissed.
“Gabriel belongs to me,” Asmodeus snarled, “Tell me where he is or your boyfriend dies.”
Faith found a comb and began working on the knots in her hair.
“Comfortable,” Gabriel replied mischievously.
“Your brother is an ass,” Dean said to Cas.
Dean sat up, interested in the answer.
Gabriel caught him as his legs collapsed out from under him. He heaved Dean onto the bed and brushed his hands dramatically. He leaned over to whisper to Dean, “I still want to know what you would have done to Castiel if you had gotten him alone while you were a Demon.”
“Balthazar seemed cool,” Faith agreed. She immediately regretted her words because the devastation on Castiel’s face made her chest hurt.
Sam and Dean shared a strategic glance before joining Gabriel at the map-table. They deliberately sat on either side of Cas, who was pale and staring at the tabletop.
“So, you let Naomi strip away out memories and everything which made us a family?” Castiel demanded scathingly.
Dean rolled his eyes, “You’re not that dumb. Let’s take her to the Interrogation Room.”
Faith prayed carefully,
The image around them flickered ominously, “Guiding you through these memories is more taxing than I anticipated,” Castiel mumbled into Dean’s shoulder.
Sam grimaced, but Dean was not convinced, “All five? Yeah, right?”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably, “I have no frame of reference to know how to judge that.”
“Castiel doesn’t like being away from Dean,” Faith said with a frown.
“When will he wake up?” Dean asked quietly.
“I’ll carry her,” Sam offered. He held out the box of keys to Dean, who was annoyed that he had to put his gun in it to carry it upstairs.
“Kind of; yes.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Faith said heavily, “I know your first instinct is to protect Sam. I feel it too.”
“Useless,” Castiel replied easily, “Dean cannot see past my vessel.”
Samandriel was about to ask what Jane was, but the flutter of wings announced the arrival of their guests.
Faith knew instinctively what to do when she had consumed enough blood. She cut her tongue on one fang and used her blood to heal the puncture wounds.
“Can you turn the light down?” Dean asked, “I’d prefer to keep my eyes.”
“Nothing bad, I swear!” Lucifer insisted, “Sam doesn’t care that Father is destroying civilisation as he knows it, so I asked why he had given up.”
“They are a walking contradiction,” Gabriel agreed, “Sometimes they say or do things which are profound; then they revert to ignorant little creatures in an instant. I considered keeping them as pets when I first met them.”
Inias shook his head, “No; or, at least, I have no memories of it. If Father hadn’t returned, she would still be in charge of Heaven. I went into hiding after most of my Garrison was killed.”
“Ignore him, Cas,” Dean advised, “He’s trying to distract us, so we don’t ask about the Cage.”
The power surrounding the Archangel was awe-inspiring. She could see the glow around the trees before she was able to see his human form. It was even brighter than the early afternoon sunlight.
“There has been a striking number of deaths across the world, and experts are struggling to find a connection between them,” the woman across from Chuck said, “Do you know the cause?”
“It could be secret, Angel business?” Sam guessed.
Sam and Charlie were just close enough to hear Dean demand to know where Cas was, while talking to Faith.
A wave of energy knocked both Hunters back against the far wall. Their protests were muted as the Archangel stalked forward.
Sam was painfully aroused and knew he was blushing noticeably.
Dean flicked some mashed potato at Gabriel and was scolded by Linda.
Meg stood behind the right shoulder of the Archangel; her eyes trained on the Hunter. She was clearly expecting a hostile greeting.
Gabriel moved to the handcuff attached to her left wrist.
Castiel nodded, “They are worthy.”
Sam said simply; If he exists in this new world, his death can be avoided.
“Instant food delivery,” Castiel mused.
“I’ll keep that in mind if you start your period,” Dean joked.
“Tell me more.”
Dean killed the Werewolf with admirable efficiency while Sam distracted the creature. It was over so fast that Dean appeared disappointed.
The extra guests were scattered around in their own little cottages and crops were being planted.
“Does Cas have any idea of what Gabriel is planning?” Sam asked as Dean casually entered the room.
“She’s wrong,” Dean said vehemently, “Having empathy isn’t a sign of weakness, but of strength.”
“I should go for a shower,” Sam mused.
Dean made a few noises and waved his arm vigorously.
“Ah, so it’s awkward that a bunch of people have seen your feathery bits?”
Sam caught Faith’s hand with a shy smile and their strides synchronised easily.
“You could have explained that before you played celestial taxi,” Sam said, trying to be reasonable.
“Zach was an ass; let’s move on without the shouting,” Gabriel instructed, “It feels like I never left Heaven.”
By the time Faith was able to control her breathing and fight off the anxiety, only Sam was left in the room. He had settled opposite her, sitting on the floor with his long legs stretched out in front of him.
“Amara is still in there?” Dean realized.
Gabriel sent, without opening his eyes.
Sam groaned, “I can’t believe I was stupid enough to talk to Lucifer.”
Gabriel narrowed his eyes at the Dhampir hosting his sibling. He waved a hand to keep their conversation private.
Gabriel sighed, “You two self-sacrificing, emotionally stunted morons deserve each other!”
“What about Kevin?” Sam asks as soon as Dean put the phone down.
“Michal and Lucifer are idiots,” Gabriel declared, “I have humans stashed in pocket-universes all over the place. These two are important, so they need special protection.”
“Yeah, right,” Dean scoffed.
“Next round is Sam versus Michael; Sammy is kicking Archangel booty all over the gym.”
“Do I look like a maid?” Dean demanded grumpily.
Lucifer hunched over the book, correctly guessing that Gabriel was tempted to steal it, “They don’t like me,” he muttered.
“Maybe,” Gabriel replied with a shrug, “Talking to myself got old, fast.”
The shy smile on Castiel’s face was entertaining in itself; the awestruck expression on Dean’s face forced Gabriel to suppress a litany of comments.
“Sam has repressed Lucifer’s powers,” Castiel revealed, her voice tinged with awe, “He is dealing with the raw emotions without his Grace to mute them.”
The lady, identified during the introductions as Alanna, stared at Lucifer worriedly, “The Devil?”
“That shows progress,” Castiel assured him, “Blindly believing you deserve power over others is quite dangerous.”
“Luci? I know we didn’t part on good terms, but I missed you.”
“Gabriel wants me to give you advice,” Sam admitted, “Do you plan to destroy the world again?”
The sharpness of the sensation had gradually dulled on the drive home and the compulsion to find Cas immediately was increasing.
“I’m here to help; Gabriel thinks you need assistance with the human stuff. Tell me to go away if I get annoying,” he offered.
“In a way, yes.”
Dean reached out to place a hand over the limp fingers of his best friend. While unconscious, he looked so damn vulnerable.
“Don’t say that, Cas,” Sam implored, “You did what you had to; Raphael would have destroyed half the planet with his stupid plans.”
Castiel folded her arms across her chest, “It is rather sad when I have to consider Gabriel to be an adult, with his history. Behave, or I’ll tell Linda how you need a time-out.”
Castiel struggled to his feet, the burning pain in his wings making him whimper. He kept his teeth clenched and sucked air he didn’t need into his body to suppress any further humiliating noises.
“Yep; he was such a sour-puss, I changed his nickname to ‘Chuckles’,” Dean added.
“Do you miss having Michael with you?” Samandriel asked curiously.
“The ultimate narcissist,” Sam agreed thoughtfully, “I can’t even describe him as ‘evil’ because he didn’t even enjoy inflicting pain; it was all a means to an end. He was sure that if he caused enough trouble, God would come back.”
The Wicked Witch had already been dispatched by the time Gabriel stopped laughing at how uncomfortable Sam could be when forced to discuss Dean’s sex life.
“Castiel is surprised that I don’t avoid emotions as though they were rabid Hellhounds,” Faith explained when Sam regarded her curiously.
Chuck snorted, “Faith; the excuse used by assholes for centuries to kill in my name. Whether you label me as God, Allah or something else, I will judge all by their thoughts and actions. If I was going to favour a group, I might pick Atheists; they didn’t need an invisible friend to guilt them into morality.”
“Your human will be home before lunchtime,” Chuck said to Castiel, “I will return when they arrive home. In the meantime, enjoy the vessel I’ve redesigned for you; during daylight he will remain unchanged and at night you get a body Dean will not be able to ignore.”
Michael ignored the irritation evoked by the reminder than he was at Dean’s mercy, and he wasn’t sure how to comfort Lucifer anyway.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the Angel, “You acted like you were fine.”
“Your ability to master sarcasm gives me hope for your future,” Gabriel declared, “Just remember that human society is riddled with taboos. Dean will probably have a melt-down, but it’s not you who will make him panic; it’s his ingrained rubbish.”
“You need to learn to control that temper,” Gabriel observed calmly, “It doesn’t do you any favours. It took me years to funnel my anger into something productive; punishing assholes.”
Adam left the room before the Archangel finished speaking. He headed to the library at a jog, intent on finding Michael.
“I can’t see his aura,” Castiel admitted, “You are concealing his power?”
A direct prayer made Gabriel tense. Samandriel waited patiently.
“Maybe it’s about Sam, not you.”
Faith located suitable underwear, which made Dean’s eyes wander up to the ceiling. He didn’t blush but he wasn’t comfortable seeing her bra hanging where the handcuff had been. The slip-on shoes were another welcome addition.
“Pet?!” Dean exclaimed, “I am not a pet!”
“Or back to before the civil war in Heaven?” Castiel asked, “You could go toe-to-toe with Raphael and avoid Leviathans and Purgatory.”
“It’s after midnight!” Dean grumbled as Gabriel flew to the door in an instant.
“This is a Demon,” Chuck explained patiently, “Holy water will burn it, and the exorcism I outlined earlier will force the Demon out of the vessel.”
“Humans?” Castiel realized, “Aren’t you supposed to be trying to wipe them out?”
Sam pressed one hand against the black surface, quite aware that everything he was seeing existed only in his mindscape.
“As long as she remains alive, Kevin will move to the bunker,” Dean said with a shrug.
Samandriel moved closer to Adam so he could rest the back of his hand against the forehead of the unconscious human.
“Some are; my Flock have suffered, and their souls still remain pure,” Gabriel argued, “And I think you’re jealous.”
Dean left Cas to shower in peace while he organised breakfast. He considered a greasy meal to see if he could make Cas throw up, only to have Gabriel glare at him from across the room.
Both Dean and Michael felt the approach of a familiar Grace, well before Castiel strolled into the bar.
“Probably not,” Sam admitted, “But I wouldn’t destroy the world if he did.”
“Sam?” Gabriel whispered, doubting that it was the Hunter watching him.
Sam and Dean watched Castiel proceed to skull the entire bottle.
“Let me be his vessel,” Faith offered, “I have a few things to say to him.”
Sam visibly relaxed, which made Gabriel chuckle, “Now, do you understand why I killed him so many times?”
“I’ll fix anything you break,” Gabriel offered. He knew Dean would throw a tantrum if his windshield-wipers were broken by the backside of an Angel.
“Such a Dumbass,” Dean sighed. He tucked the gun away and muttered a few more descriptive words under his breath.
“Give us time,” Gabriel joked, “Castiel was definitely corrupted by the Winchesters; it took months.”
“In the hospital, he wasn’t armed,” Sam added, “That didn’t happen often.”
Sam wanted to laugh, but he could feel Lucifer’s presence and his heart was pounding with anxiety.
“If she keeps her teeth to herself,” Dean grumbled.
“No; Jimmy Novak’s soul went to Heaven when we were killed by Raphael a few years ago. When I was resurrected, I was alone,” Castiel explained.
He was just starting to relax back into slumber when Gabriel came out to speak to Jane in a low tone and then disappeared again. Within minutes, Jane exited through the front door.
to eat.”
Lucifer snorted, “I’m not ‘Samael’ anymore; I’m Lucifer, the evil bastard who gets the blame for everything.”
“Dean has become rather entranced by Castiel in a female vessel,” Gabriel confided, “I’m not sure if it will carry over to her male form.”
The oppressive silence hanging over the pancake-laden table wiped the smirk off Dean’s face. The odd pride at having annoyed Sam by simply knocking on his bedroom door was quick to fade as he sat down next to Cas.
“One big room won’t work for these two,” Gabriel explained, “I’m going to put in a bathroom and a kitchen. They can sleep out here; think of it as a large bedroom.”
“Here’s the deal,” Faith began, not at all intimidated, “If you give Sam any shit, I’ll have Gabriel drag your essence out of my boyfriend and put into my head. I already checked with your Father; I could contain you for a few months without any permanent damage.”
“It was odd, but not painful, as I expected,” Castiel answered thoughtfully.
“You won’t need to sleep, but if knocked unconscious he would have control of your body, but not access to your subconscious mind. If you choose to sleep, he could enter your dreams to interact with you, but you would retain control over the rest of the images.”
“The Devil is a virgin,” Gabriel confirmed with a laugh, “Grace-melding is the closest Angels get in their true forms. It’s like Grace-sharing, but much more intense.”
“Lucifer will need a vessel, when I release him,” Chuck said lightly, “If not Sam, who should it be?”
“They won’t,” Sam scoffed, “Not that quick.”
Sam ignored him, “You never hurt anyone else?”
“I’ll heat it up,” Faith offered, “I like playing with the microwave. You two, make friends.”
“Why are you telling me this?” Jane asked suspiciously.
Dean smirked at her, “Only you get to make him bleed?”
“Your Vampire heritage is very interesting. Did this develop when you drank his blood?” Castiel asked curiously.
“We have very different definitions of ‘torture’,” Sam snapped.
“Crowley?” Sam exclaimed, “Why? Did Gabriel become impatient and contacted him without us?”
“Gabriel?” he whispered.
Dean seemed to be coping with Michael; it certainly hadn’t diminished his appetite.
“Wait until you try chocolate, or sex,” Gabriel advised.
“The best thing you can do it accept yourself, and try to do better,” Chuck suggested, “From my perspective, you’ve already improved so much.”
Dean headed to the kitchen to do the washing up, since Sam had cooked.
Gabriel appeared briefly, laughing so hard that he fell out of sight beyond the end of the bed.
“When Lucifer wrapped you up in his Grace, you would stop for a while. Michael could hear you, even when I couldn’t.”
“It is much easier to enjoy the pleasures in life with a body,” Gabriel confided.
“Half the time Castiel is utterly confused and struggling to cope. His Grace protected him from most of the emotional instability, so he is going to get much worse without it. He will struggle to name what he is feeling, let alone know how to deal with them,” Gabriel growled.
“Expect more nightmares,” Gabriel warned, “With everything we’ve seen, sleep becomes an outlet for all the fears we can ignore with our Grace intact.”
Castiel couldn’t properly articulate the regard he held for Dean. Love, devotion and obsession all seemed to fall short.
Dean watched his brother use his sleeve to wipe the dust off her motionless face. He had already noticed that Sam was gazing at the woman with concern rather than a healthy wariness.
“I’m sure; thank-you for the offer, but I feel like facing him again is inevitable,” Sam explained, “At least, this way, I’ll have control.”
Dean sat to the right of the Archangel, with Castiel slouched against him, her body positioned in the V created by the Hunter’s legs. Dean had his hands around her torso and was polite enough not to let them wander.
Dean slowly released Castiel’s wrist and shifted so he was lying on his side to face the worried Angel. He was glad that he was below the blankets, while Castiel was on top of them. His eyes were drawn to the wing which curved over the bed.
Dean felt the warmth on his shoulder first, as though the Grace embedded in his soul was welcoming the arrival of the rest. The light faded and the warmth spread through his chest and into the rest of his body.
The colour fled from Sam’s face. Faith pressed herself against him immediately, fearing he would lose his balance.
“No,” Castiel managed before he disappeared.
The settlement was developing quickly, and Dean enjoyed pitching in to build the fence to separate the domestic animals from the fields where vegetables and grain were being planted.
Gabriel had updated the Winchester’s memories to the point of Dean becoming a Demon before they left. The only person who still needed to know more details about the previous timeline was Castiel.
Castiel recognised the signs of attraction in himself and Dean; he found the fluttering sensation in his stomach to be quite annoying. He enjoyed seeing Dean’s pupil’s so dilated while the Hunter watched him intently.
She had never felt so lost; even during the months of captivity she clung to the thought of the people who wanted her to endure and return.
“At least you admit you have them.”
“You are far too harsh,” Gabriel decided, “I am a sweetheart underneath this sexy exterior.”
“But in here, you can’t see or hear anything,” Sam realized, “Sorry.”
“He stood up to Heaven, which was something I could never do.”
“Less than an hour,” Balthazar offered, “Just enjoy it, Samuel.”
“Can I stay out of the dungeon?” she asked hopefully.
“You look stoned,” Dean observed flatly.
Faith felt her fangs slide to full extension, which made Sam gulp instinctively. Her eyes flicked up to Gabriel to see his reaction.
“It’s also a gender thing,” Faith explained, “Society teaches men to ignore their feelings, while women get to express them. It’s very unfair, and from what I have observed very little has changed since the fifties.”
“No,” Castiel answered easily, “Though, if you were ever wounded beyond the ability of your body to heal, I could temporarily occupy your body to heal you.”
“Yeah,” Sam replied, still staring at the closed door.
“You’re an asshole!” Dean spat at Gabriel. He turned away and stomped toward the boat where Kevin was concealed.
“I’m an optimist,” Gabriel teased with a wink.
“You use so much shampoo, I wonder if you eat it,” Dean grumbled.
He could also feel the mess of emotions radiating from Lucifer and couldn’t deny the pity he felt for his former tormentor. It did not mix well with the revulsion.
Lightning flashed, even though there were no storm clouds in the sky. The flash of wings behind Dean silenced everyone in the area.
“That’s easier to explain,” Gabriel offered as he headed toward the door, “Dean matched Michael and you survived the crap Azazel put you through. If Dean hadn’t sold his soul to bring you back, Jake would have been Lucifer’s vessel and his sibling would have hosted Michael.”
“Other than not dying? I was trapped in the dungeon of a Prince of Hell having my Grace stolen between torture sessions,” Gabriel explained darkly, “That timeline needed changing.”
“Gabriel is here to supervise, and make sure I don’t bleed out if you damage an artery,” Sam explained calmly.
Faith continued to struggle, but the blood Dean had injected into her arm continued to sap her strength. She estimated she was left with less than half of the strength she was accustomed to having.
“About two steps behind you,” Castiel revealed quietly, “He has been claimed by Balthazar and is still unconscious.”
Chuck appeared in front of the television, “Now, do you understand why I am experimenting with the timeline?” he asked pointedly.
Gabriel passed along the warning to Michael and Lucifer. They gently disentangled their Graces, though the warmth of shared understanding remained.
Chuck was explaining why a small percentage of the population had an Enochian symbol on their left wrist when Castiel emerged from the bathroom.
“They are; I’m over twenty-five years old and I still make lots of mistakes. You’ve been human for a day, and those memories show me you were basically an emotionless ass when you first met Dean.”
“Probably,” Dean agreed wearily.
“She wants to be his vessel?” Sam asked worriedly.
Lucifer gaped at the audacity of his True Vessel. Before he could reply with something deeply scathing, Gabriel burst into laughter.
“You’re nuts,” Dean decided aloud, “Completely off your rocker, screw loose insane.”
“Ew,” Sam groaned, “Don’t even go there.”
“This Flock thing in another layer of protection against Lucifer and Michael,” Dean summarised, “I vote ‘Yes’, even before I found out Sammy was going to let the Devil back in.”
“Don’t be stupid, Dean,” Castiel ordered flatly, “You can’t hurt him.”
“It’s true,” Sam confirmed hesitantly, “The Men of Letters were wiped out in 1958; we only learned about this place when out grandfather time-travelled.”
Lucifer tilted his head backward to expose his neck. Chuck reached forward with a small knife.
Dean laughed, which seemed to confuse the Angel.
He recognised the opening text as the movie ‘Dogma’, which he hadn’t seen in years. Dean barked a laugh when he realized what Balthazar had chosen.
“I would like to begin the process, though I understand you have to take me out at least three times before we copulate,” Castiel said solemnly, “Your comment about the third date made sense once Gabriel explained it.”
“I miss you, too.”
“Dean is checking on our supply of Dead Mans’ blood,” Sam said quietly, “So we can take the cuffs off at night.”
Castiel had known Gabriel long enough to know he should not follow any advice the Archangel gave in that tone.
Lucifer rolled his eyes, “How could you think that
“Please, don’t call him that to his face,” Castiel instructed firmly.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“And when I sleep?”
“Why not? We know where the problems are; let’s be proactive,” Gabriel said firmly.
Faith would abide by any decision Sam made, and she warned Gabriel that she wanted to know what was really written on the missing pages of the Dhampir book.
Adam moved forward to hug the Archangel who had been his companion for centuries. Michael patted the back of the man hugging him, glad that Dean had explained the meaning of the contact.
“Can I touch your wings?” he whispered.
Lucifer felt Sam observing the entire conversation. He was not surprised when the Hunter took control, though the ease with which he did was humbling.
“It’s there,” Faith disagreed, “When I get too close to you, or even think of your blood, something deep inside knows I would be risking death.”
“I still hate the idea of helping Crowley,” Dean muttered.
“Put on a sweater,” Dean suggested.
“Giving you a hug,” Gabriel sighed, “Has no-one except me ever hugged you before?”
“Angels are trained to be soldiers,” Castiel said with a hint of sadness, “We are not supposed to indulge in emotions.”
Sam was unprepared for the sharp wave of arousal which shot through his body when her fangs pierced his skin. It was stronger than the reaction he had experienced when she had first fed from him over a week earlier.
“We are not screwed up!” Dean argued.
“Knowing about the Reaper in the other timeline still disturbs me,” Castiel admitted.
“Not at the moment,” Faith replied with a glare, “So, drop it.”
“You two have this weird co-dependency going on,” Gabriel pointed out, “You won’t let Dean sacrifice himself and he won’t let you. So. Don’t. Bother.”
“Gabriel transported us,” Castiel explained, recognising the unasked question.
Gabriel inspected the ceiling, “No reason.”
“You can’t see it, but her wings are fluffed up because she’s so happy,” Gabriel continued, “It’s downright adorable.”
Gabriel patted Sam on the shoulder to offer support. The distress radiating through their mental link was like a constant itch the Archangel just couldn’t scratch.
“I’m not sure,” Castiel admitted, “I know you are uncomfortable expressing affection while my vessel remains male. After sunset, it should be easier.”
“Why?”
“He means it,” Dean confirmed, “All sorts of mushy thoughts are swirling around in there. Angels really need to learn how to beat the crap out of each other, hug and then get drunk together. I swear, most of your civil wars and stuff would have been avoided.”
“I’m not Alfred,” Gabriel argued, “If anyone, I’m Batman. Sam and Dean together add up to a sad Robin. Faith can be Batgirl; unless you want to mud-wrestle her for the title, Meg?”
“I suspect that would make my head explode,” Crowley complained.
“You don’t want to watch his dreams?”
Sam hoped that whatever James needed assistance with will be a quick case. Otherwise, he would have to resort to asking Gabriel to fly him back to the bunker when Faith needed blood.
“Yes!”
Faith squeezed Dean’s hand, “Can you still feel the connection to your Angel?”
As much as Dean loved the intimacy of the closeness with Cas, he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the grey wings which curled around both of them.
“Barn animals don’t comment on farts,” Castiel pointed out.
Michael was unsettled by the venom in her tone. He could also hear Dean cheering her on.
Lucifer watched Sam long enough to see the moment when the Hunter recognised him. The sharp intake of breath and sudden tension evoked a pang of something Gabriel had labelled as regret.
“The strongest, healthiest humans with a good sense of empathy,” Chuck explained cheerfully, “Too little or too much empathy can lead to problems; I’ll probably add psychopaths and sociopaths to the kill list, on a case-by-case basis.”
“Castiel wants to know what eating faeces has to do with smiling,” Faith said with a smirk, “I’m curious too.”
Faith approached the café with a racing heart. When Gabriel had outlined the plan, it had seemed straightforward. Now, she was sure she was going to die.
“Dean? How are you coping with Michael?” Adam asked hesitantly as Samandriel trotted closer.
“He moved!” Sam hissed.
Sam moved forward, causing a fresh gust of his scent to reach Faith.
“I want the one you wore today,” Cas requested.
“That sounds like a compliment to me,” Gabriel mused.
Lucifer prodded at the spongy item with his index finger.
Gabriel pouted, “So uptight. I really don’t understand why humans have so many hang-ups regarding sex. All animals do it, and no other species gets so weird about it. Male, female; as long as they are consenting adults, why should anyone give a shit?”
“Henry Winchester. He was supposed to be initiated on the night of the massacre,” Dean supplied. He was pretty sure she wasn’t going to try to attack, but he held onto the machete anyway.
Chuck regarded Sam sadly, “Touching the Grace of an Angel without the protection of a physical body is incredibly painful for a human soul. Castiel described your soul as having been ‘flayed alive’ because Lucifer’s Grace damaged it in a similar way. Such contact is incredibly intimate; closer than occupying the same vessel. I have no doubt that my son picked through every memory and thought he could find, and had you trapped in his choice of nightmares. I doubt the location in your mind made it less traumatic.”
“All done, Darling,” Rowena said smugly.
“You don’t want to stuff more memories in here to torture me?”
“I was bored,” Gabriel said dismissively, “You two and Charlie can take out a pair of Djinn’s early, then Dorothy can give Charlie, Rowena and Meg a tour of Oz.”
Lucifer closed the book reluctantly, “And if Holy Water gets thrown at me?”
“Of course; you’re a sexy woman with a lot to admire,” Dean groaned, “Isn’t that obvious?”
“Not since you lot averted the Apocalypse,” Chuck replied happily, “Since then, I’ve just enjoyed the ride. When it got too bumpy, I sent Gabriel back to smooth it out.”
Faith giggled, which leeched away some of the anger Sam was feeling.
“If I interfere too much, the Universe will implode,” Chuck explained, “I do what I can.”
Sam leaned down and a gruff voice in his mind told him that he was being an idjit.
Gabriel was proud of his brother; Luci was finally growing up. The stunned expression Sam wore was also rather entertaining.
“If it seems loose, tug it gently like this;” Cas continued, guiding Dean’s hand to show him how much force to use, “It will either come off or become itchy, so I know to remove it soon.”
“You have a giant, Angelic hickey on your soul, which every Angel can see from a mile away,” Matthias clarified, “You are marked as his, and his devotion to you is just as visible. It is obvious to everyone but you.”
“My memories of the Cage are hazy, at best,” Sam began, “The hallucination of Lucifer implied a lot of things, and I need to know what really happened before I consider any vessel ideas.”
Dean realized he had reabsorbed his Grace; the way he held his body was a clear indicator. His head was held high and his glare held the arrogance of an Angel of the Lord.
Gabriel sat up slowly, knowing there were very few beings capable of bringing an Angel back to life.
“Come with us?” Faith suggested, “Castiel is safe from Angels in the bunker; there’s room for you too.”
“Have you ever masturbated before?” Dean asked quietly as his hand explored the hardened flesh with confidence.
“No; I will restrict his abilities so he cannot leave, take control or influence you beyond being present. You can visualize locking him away and he will be trapped.”
“Can you see the bond-thingy, too?”
Gabriel shook his head, “No; only Chuck, Amara and Nephilims sired by Archangels can to that. I can only imagine how many Gabriel’s exist in total.”
“Thank-you,” Jane was clearly relieved.
“I would have access to all your memories, thoughts and dreams,” Castiel warned in a trembling voice, “And I suspect you would have access to mine.”
“Lucifer wrapped his Grace around your soul, which was a violation in itself. Whether he was trying to save you or force you to stay with him is something even he doesn’t know.”
Sam grabbed the lock connecting the handcuff to the wall-chain and swiftly unlocked it. He produced a second key from his pocket and unlocked the handcuffs.
Faith wasn’t prepared for the burning sense of loss which grew steadily as Sam left the vicinity. She could sense the direction the brothers headed and had to ignore the impulse to follow.
“We were only together for a few hours,” Castiel admitted, ‘I tried to respect his privacy as much as possible.’
Gabriel shrugged, “I wish Castiel could have left when I did.”
“What did you do? I felt a burst of power I didn’t recognise.”
“You look rather happy,” Sam observed.
“Castiel is wondering how many dimensions contain a Gabriel who is not a huge pain in the ass.”
“It’s a little worse than usual,” Gabriel agreed, “Though, that vessel usually has bed-hair.”
Castiel’s hands clenched into fists and he squeezed his eyes shut, “If you’re going to cut them off, just do it,” he growled.
Gabriel chuckled and shifted his eyes to the bathroom door, “Apparently, the humble bra can confuse even Angels.”
“You win the ‘my family is crazy’ competition,” Adam said to Samandriel, “I can’t top Pagan orgies.”
Dean knew he was acting like an awestruck child and he wasn’t going to apologize for it. Even Sam would be jealous that he had missed out.
When he didn’t respond, she dragged his head back with a fist in his hair. She pressed the point of the blade under his chin.
“They’re not screwing yet,” Gabriel supplied unhelpfully.
“Yep, we should have at least five minutes before they get distracted by something shiny,” Gabriel decided.
Castiel blinked, a habit he also found annoying, “No. Should I have?”
Dean nodded.
“Yes,” Lucifer muttered, “Not that it helped.”
“Faith, you okay?” Dean asked suddenly.
Gabriel drew Sam and Faith out of the dream of the Cage to find Castiel and Dean making out like horny teenagers.
Dean smiled a little at the comment, “And the company is much better. Why did your idiot brother lock us in here?”
Gabriel rolled his eyes, “Screw what Dad wants; he gets his way all the time. He ignited your empathy, but he can’t dictate when it applies.”
Castiel had bade her goodnight and walked away, as though the bond between them meant nothing.
The addition of Linda Tran as an older sister or mother figured reminded Castiel of Bobby interacting with the Winchester brothers. Nothing was lost when a third person entered the dynamic, though there were adjustments made by everyone.
Gabriel wasn’t surprised, as Sam had mentioned something similar.
“So, what is making your frown?” Dean wondered.
Lucifer was overwhelmed by another wave of fury. By the time he returned to his senses, Sam had his hands on the shoulders of his humanoid shoulders, pinning him in place.
“What?” Dean spluttered, “I did not!”
“Hey; no hurting my Angel!” he protested sharply.
Lucifer sent,
All the Angels froze when Chuck turned to glare at the camera, “All Angels not already involved in transporting humans to Sanctuary need to report to my position. Jane can watch over the bunker.”
Lucifer glared at Gabriel, the red glow in his eyes fading, “He accused Sam of lying! That memory is quite clear; Sam hesitated, until that voicemail infuriated him.”
“He said I ‘broke’ him,” Lucifer said sadly.
“Why does he even care?” Castiel demanded, “He wouldn’t drop in for the multiple Apocalypses, but he cares if I get laid? Bullshit!”
“Try it with Dean,” Gabriel suggested, “Some humans find them very sexy.”
Faith shared an amused glance with Sam before the Hunter sat up.
“I understand,” Gabriel whispered.
“How can I not feel guilty, Sam?” Cas sighed, “My arrogance caused so much suffering.”
Dean huffed a laugh, “You gave me a soul hickey.”
“Well, they’re here,” Castiel said wearily, tapping his temple, “All the way back to when I argued against Lucifer being punished for having an opinion. I didn’t realize I was the first Angel tortured into submission. Falling in love with a human seems like a fitting middle finger to Heaven.”
“Even though most of them are assholes, I do feel sorry for them,” Adam admitted, “Even Lucifer.”
Gabriel chuckled as Samandriel immediately followed Adam, as though there was an invisible string connecting them.
“I’m glad you got him,” Dean offered.
Once the four of them were seated at the table with beers in hand, Sam glared at Gabriel meaningfully. His brother was not as tactful.
“There’s a Wicked Witch in a container in here; who better to slap her down than the most powerful witch in history?” Gabriel countered.
Once he ran out of memories before the Cage opened the second time, he switched to Castiel facing off against Raphael while Sam didn’t have a soul.
Dean tried to explain as the group headed back toward the bunker. Gabriel transported the bodies to the driveway of a cult that was hoarding weapons which had all been sabotaged.
“Try closing your eyes,” Faith suggested.
Sam cringed instinctively at the reminder.
Cas nodded, his head still pressed against the pillow, “I had nightmares last night,” he recalled softly, “You were dead, and God came back to tell me it was all my fault. I woke up wishing I had died in my sleep. Humans can die so easily.”
Castiel was completely drunk less than ten minutes later. His Grace remained around his neck like a glowing blue pendant.
Dean reached the final cell a moment ahead of his brother. He expected to find an empty bed, so the unmoving body lit up in the artificial light made him hesitate.
“And I will kick your as when required,” Gabriel offered, “You get points for trying not to be a dipshit, though.”
Dean went first, using both hands to shine the flashlight and point his gun simultaneously. Sam suspected they would find the remains of the creature but feared she would be close to death and still suffering.
“And what did you do?” Dean prompted.
“Could I communicate as a soul?” Sam wondered, “Angels can talk without a vessel.”
“Do you wish to vent your frustrations?”
“I trust you a hell of a lot more than any other Angel; as much as Cas. Lucifer terrifies me and I can’t be at his mercy every again.”
“From what I saw, your intentions were good, and she was an excellent manipulator,” Faith said thoughtfully, “She reminded me of Joe.”
“It is rather irritating,” Castiel agreed.
“Would I sleep?” Dean wondered.
“You did warn me that the bond-thingy could cause problems,” Dean pointed out.
Sam was beginning to worry that Faith had left the bunker when he felt her presence through their bond.
“Did you seriously do that?” Gabriel demanded of his brother.
Though Dean was watching the movie, Michael stared at his Fallen brother in the Hunter’s peripheral vision.
“He’s a dick,” Dean muttered.
“Many of our viewers have questioned your steps to take away their right to have children,” the interviewer managed, “Do you have any statement to give regarding their concerns?”
Faith nodded, “I never felt this attached to Joe.”
“Go annoy Dean,” Sam suggested.
; they just kill people.”
Faith slept in until noon, which made sense after Jane skimmed the book on Dhampirs.
“Why bother?” Lucifer asked despondently, “I’ll just stuff up there, too.”
“Well, I can,” Faith pointed out, “I’m half-Vampire; could that be why?”
Seconds later, the Angels were gone. Sam, Faith, Jane and Adam shared worried glances.
“What does that even mean?” Sam asked sceptically.
“Bullshit. You know something, Sammy,” Dean growled.
Jane closed her eyes and silently wished for the opportunity to meet her soulmate.
Gabriel relayed the tentative agreement from Lucifer to Michael. He refrained from pointing out that the ‘Messenger of God’ was not designed for passing messages between Archangels who were perfectly capable of speaking to each other directly.
“Hey!” Gabriel protested, “I am downright pleasant compared to Michael and Lucifer.”
“That was unwise, Dean,” Cas said in the deep version of the woman’s voice, “Why are you trying to get yourself killed?”
“There’s the ruthless bastard we know and love,” Gabriel teased, “Let Bobby get stabbed, then swoop in to save the day, Luci.”
Gabriel refused to watch the man and Angel dance around happiness and never take the plunge; not for a second time.
Dean felt Michael stir, his thoughts on memories of refusing to share Grace with Lucifer. He longed to connect with his closest sibling that way.
“Can I help?” Dean offered. The idea of walking away from Cas while he was wounded and vulnerable made his stomach churn.
Sam nodded. Learning how to focus on his immediate vicinity had taken close to an hour.
Sam added,
“She has chosen Sam,” Gabriel explained, “I expect they will ask me to bond their souls later today.”
Gabriel removed the handcuffs while muttering in Enochian. From his tone, he was saying something very unflattering.
“Yes; too little or too much can be unhealthy for a population. Within a hundred years, there will be no more sociopaths raising children. I am currently reviewing each one individually to see who should be culled right away.”
Gabriel threw back his head and laughed loudly. He clapped Dean on the back and congratulated him on being mildly entertaining.
Sam expected the floor to slam into his aching head, but a pair of strong hands caught him. The small, feminine body should not have been capable of hoisting him back into the chair.
“I remain classy while doing so.”
Neither brother could find the words to break the shocked silence.
“No; I didn’t even realize the body and soul could be separated like that.”
Sam tried to recall what Chuck had described, but the memories remained unclear.
“Obviously not.”
“Have a seat, son,” Chuck suggested in a casual tone which made Lucifer immediately apprehensive.
Lucifer sat back to observe while Sam conversed with those around him.
Fear blossomed in her gut and raced to every cell in her body. She yanked herself away from the terrifying creature hiding under the mask of an ordinary man.
“God doesn’t want you dead, obviously,” Gabriel said, “He’s quite happy for you to remain King of Hell.”
“You want advice on how to approach a past version of me?” Sam clarified.
“Cas is probably right,” Dean agreed, “Friggin’ Chuck; I don’t trust him.”
“Yes. Gabriel informed me that taking on the appearance of your deceased girlfriend was ‘creepy’-”
“And Faith?”
Dean watched the tip of the blade slide down the neck of his best friend. One by one, the buttons of the white shirt fell away. The woman then moved behind Castiel and used the blade to cut the shirt from neck to hem. The remains of the garment hung on Castiel’s arms.
Dean cocked his head to the side as he listened to Cas, “He will understand if you decide to kill him, but I won’t sit back and let you.”
“Perhaps; not that the bond with Castiel has been consummated, your powers will manifest,” Chuck offered.
“Can we wake her up?” he asked.
“Cas!”
“I know,” Lucifer grumbled, “This place is becoming crowded.”
Castiel could feel the bond reacting to the touch. Contentment spread through him as Dean laced their fingers together with careful movements.
Gabriel sighed dramatically, “Fine; I’ll play fetch. Eat your dinner.”
Dean was intrigued when Cas stared at their joined hands and nodded slightly. Dean ran his thumb along the feminine pinky finger and waited patiently.
“I don’t know how to avoid being shielded by my Grace,” Castiel admitted stiffly.
“You just said I was their pet Angel,” Castiel recalled.
“Cas is recovering, so I’d probably be in the driver’s seat,” Dean speculated nervously. The idea of being a vessel was horrible; he was only considering it because he trusted Cas.
Matthias waved a hand and a gag silenced Dean. He made some incomprehensible noises and struggled against his restraints.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Let me go!” Dean hissed. He realized that the blankets which curled around his body were wings and the chest he had used as a pillow was bare.
Dean decided that Samandriel resembled a puppy.
“I promise I will return in two days.”
“Maybe Dean likes it?” Gabriel teased. He made some kissing noises to drive the point home.
Dean had no such concerns. Within an hour, it was difficult not to laugh at the absurd way Dean and Michael carried on a conversation aloud. Lucifer could only differentiate between them by the slightly deeper tone Michael spoke with.
Castiel sat down at the table, regarding the game with genuine interest.
“What about yours?”
Gabriel sensed Castiel begin to shake off the shackles of unconsciousness. He watched his brother closely for any movement. He was not surprised that the first evidence of Castiel awakening was the grip tightening around Dean’s hand.
Castiel moved so fast Gabriel didn’t have time to move before his younger brother grabbed the front of his shirt, “Do you really expect me to believe you didn’t organise this?”
“I like to read, if that’s what you mean,” Faith replied without looking up from the book.
“Bullshit,” Crowley scoffed.
“Archangels are made with in-built batteries,” Gabriel explained, “We’re independent of Heaven.”
“That was a good thing,” Castiel offered, “Raphael’s vessel was left a drooling vegetable after only a few days. Exposure to the raw power and memories of an Archangel can drive any human insane.”
Michael gripped the edge of the poll table with both hands, “You can see Angel wings?” he demanded.
Chuck sighed, “No-one is ever happy. That’s why I left, you know.”
your wings?”
Dean knocked again, “You’re nearly as bad as Sam for hogging the big bathroom.”
“I’m serious,” Castiel insisted, “Take my Grace out and I’ll wear it in a little bottle around my neck.”
Gabriel was not impressed, “If he tries to kill himself, I will not hesitate to stuff his Grace back in.”
bad in the world?” Lucifer demanded.
Dean was sure he was already infatuated and silently hoped she was a lesbian.
“Stop your panicking,” Gabriel advised wearily, “He’s not angry at you; he finds you interesting. That’s all we’re going to get from him; mild interest.”
“You don’t want to go out there,” Gabriel assured him, “Sam and Faith are being all cuddly; it’s sickening. They didn’t even notice when I put in a stripper pole, complete with dancer.”
Gabriel regarded the former Angel critically, “You’re struggling with the memories?”
Her unexpected burst of strength shoved the first demon into the fire, releasing Gabriel.
“We were equally startled, I think. While we are in physical contact, the emotional connection is easier to read,” Cas explained.
“Mmm, not bad,” Gabriel decided.
“I found something like that in my room, but I thought they were weird undergarments,” Faith realized.
“Do all humans feel like this?” Lucifer wondered, “I’m cold and feel like my guts were ripped out.”
“Let it out, Sammy,” Lucifer encouraged, “I like hearing you scream.”
The atmosphere remained solemn, even with Balthazar describing alternate uses for various food items. Castiel would never look at honey the same way.
Gadreel froze in place, his eyes fixed on the far wall as he listened.
“She’s probably long dead,” Dean mused as he ran his hand behind the third shelf, “How long could anyone sleep under a spell?”
“So, I am going to remove the obstacle which stops Dean accepting Castiel,” Gabriel continued calmly, “I am going to transform his vessel into a woman.”
Sam gaped at the Archangel and stuttered a heartfelt thank-you.
“How do I avoid scaring the crap out of past-you?” Lucifer asked with exasperation, “As soon as I introduce myself, you’ll hate me.”
“Samandriel?” Castiel gasped.
“The truth hurts,” Gabriel replied breezily, “I’m beginning to understand why Luci is in such a bad mood all the time. Don’t blame me for pointing out what should be obvious.”
Gabriel reappeared and smiled smugly when Sam dropped a curse and spilled beer on his shirt.
Balthazar tapped his finger to his chin thoughtfully, “I could remain scarce until night-time to confront Castiel over her boyfriend moving too fast.”
Castiel mumbled Dean’s name.
Gadreel had chosen to stay with the current timeline, and Lucifer had promised to free the alternate version of Gadreel from prison as soon as he could.
Gabriel handed him another one, with the top already gone.
“I don’t understand you,” Sam admitted crossly, “Are you bipolar, or something? One minute you’re depressed, and the next you’re grinning like that.”
“And the rest of the bar?”
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Dean, does Michael like the taste of pizza?” Sam asked.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Chuck reached forward to touch Sam’s forehead. Lucifer dodged, but he was not quick enough.
“He was being an asshole,” Faith added.
Castiel glanced away with something akin to embarrassment, “They deserve long, healthy lives.”
“We’re not modelling anything,” Faith said bluntly, “Will you provide clothing, or am I taking Castiel shopping?”
“Do you throw Balthy around with your powers?” Gabriel asked with a wink.
The sight of a wink stretching toward Gabriel shocked Sam into stillness. The bronze feathers hovered in the air patiently.
“Yet, you refused to show me memories of your sexual exploits,” Michael pointed out, “What if that’s what Father wants me to learn?”
Gabriel rolled his eyes, “Take your time and learn some moves while you’re there. No-one should get to your age without experiencing a threesome; it’s just sad.”
“Even you have to see that Angels are as flawed as humanity,” Gabriel scoffed, “Just as petty, violent, judgemental and demanding. Someone was going to rebel; you just moved faster than the rest of us. The Intelligence Department has been busy for thousands of years to keep everyone else from following suit.”
“All settled in?” Gabriel asked with a sly grin.
Linda and Kevin were preparing dinner in the kitchen. Gabriel had tried to ‘help’ but had been chased away by Linda wielding a wooden spoon.
“So, basically, when he does get his own body, I don’t have to punch him in the face?” Dean surmised.
Dean led the way down the stairs. The discomfort in his chest eased as Sam and Faith came closer.
Cas considered the idea, “Until she craves blood again?”
utterly adorable, and the urge to cuddle was probably evidence of a brain tumour.
“Sorry,” Castiel whispered brokenly, “Nightmare.”
Sam was on the opposite side of the bed. He reached out to touch Faith’s shoulder while he quietly said her name.
“It will be done before you wake up,” Gabriel assured him, “Seriously, though; imagine Castiel in a female vessel. Dean would hit that in a heartbeat.”
“Bullshit!” Dean snapped, “She’s had a hold of you since she woke up.”
Knowing he had been instrumental in releasing the Darkness made Castiel wish he could have all his memories wiped again. The final kick in the teeth was realizing he had allowed Lucifer to ride his vessel out of Hell and wreak havoc for no reason at all. If Lucifer had been crucial to stopping Amara, he could have justified being so reckless. Instead, he felt like the biggest moron in the history of the Universe.
Faith emerged from the hall, dressed but her hair was a mess. No-one was rude enough to comment.
Gabriel lifted Rowena’s hand to kiss her knuckles, “If you’ll excuse me, Darling?”
“Relax, Sammy,” Dean advised with a cocky grin, “She suggested being cuffed to the bed. It’s a good idea.”
Sam hating seeing her fear. He was furious that the Men of Letters had imprisoned and tortured her in pursuit of knowledge.
“Maybe,” Gabriel agreed lightly, “But those two have a habit of succeeding when it doesn’t seem possible.”
Gabriel leaned in to whisper something to Dean. Sam was extremely curious about what the Archangel could have said to make Dean blush and nearly inhale his beer at the same time.
Dean chuckled and found the burst of courage he needed to ask; “So, when you say ‘regard’ for me, what do you mean, exactly?”
Gabriel waited patiently in the dungeon. A full three minutes after he sent out the call, Crowley appeared in the far corner of the room. Gabriel used his powers to close the gap in the wards so the King of Hell couldn’t escape.
“If I have to.”
“Not really; Father made excuses and Michael nodded along like an idiot,” Lucifer grumbled, “I have a few days to ‘learn something’, or I die.”
“Don’t tease Dean,” Faith instructed the Archangel, “Castiel needs to heal, and it upsets him.”
“Even in dreams, you feel safe in the bunker,” Gabriel explained.
Sam pondered the memories Lucifer had shared of the lead-up to the Fall. He sympathised with the Devil, which was an odd feeling. He was distracted by thoughts of God’s culpability in the matter as he dropped his work-out clothes in the laundry and headed toward the kitchen.
“It all looks like junk to me,” Lucifer said with a shrug.
“You’re off your rocker,” Dean agreed.
Gabriel regarded Castiel critically, “You were there; you saw how devoted the humans were before and after they became the first Demons.”
“Yes; though most stories about me are false,” Lucifer replied gruffly, “I pointed Eve toward the Tree of Knowledge and welcomed humans who chose to commit evil deeds when they died; the rest is on you lot.”
Sam gaped at Chuck, “You’re talking about genocide.”
“It’s okay,” Dean decided, “There are worse ways to get a tattoo.”
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“I have some ideas about that.”
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but no words formed.
Dean hadn’t felt so safe, warm and utterly relaxed since his mother had been alive. He watched his brother accept the extended hands with a lazy smile. He saw the moment when years of suffering were soothed by the muted Grace of both Angels.
Samandriel offered a polite greeting before returning to his position pressed into Castiel. His head was tucked tightly under his sister’s chin and Gabriel was pressed against his back.
After he woke up with a sore neck, Faith made him settle against her with a pillow to support him. She knew he was struggling badly with living as a human, so she didn’t mind him falling asleep with his head in her lap each night. When Joe was ill, she would offer him the same comfort.
Dean barked a laugh while Sam was tactful enough to restrain his reaction to an amused snort.
“Will you refrain from attacking my vessel?” Cas asked.
“He was angry, but so worn out by the clash with Lucifer, that he had no choice but to listen,” Chuck explained, “He allowed Adam to take over and you two tried to talk my sons into accepting each other rather than fighting.”
Matthias tapped the blade against Castiel’s jaw. He flinched away, his eyes on the ground to his right.
The unexpected reply in a snarky voice surprised Dean. The humour in the situation eased some of the tension he was dealing with.
Gabriel smiled condescendingly, “That key opens other bunkers too. These two are going to need a place to ‘get to know each other’ and I’d prefer not to hear them having sex. Why knows what weird shit Balthazar is into?”
Michael reminded him.
“It is when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, leading to psychological stress. Dean knows there is something much more than friendship in his bond with you, but he also knows he is not sexually attracted to men. He wants you, not your vessel,” Gabriel explained gently.
“What does Chuck want?” Dean asked rudely. Cas reached out to grip his forearm again, in warning.
“Flare your wings, Castiel,” Matthias instructed in a threatening tone.
“How’s Cas coping with being in your head?” Sam asked, “The Vessel-Angel thing can be rather intimate.”
Sam glanced over in unison with the rest of the Angels to regard Chuck warily.
Gabriel held out his hands placatingly, “I have a few things to offer, and some things I want.”
“Ten years,” Dean recalled, “He has less than ten years to live?”
Gabriel withdrew from the dreamscape enough to give the couple some privacy. He had no doubt that Sam would be unable to repress his Cage memories while his focus was on Faith.
“Why?”
Faith encouraged the brothers to try out the ping-pong table while she headed toward the library.
“Why don’t Angels usually manifest their wings?” Sam continued, “Dean implied it was embarrassing or rude.”
“You were already an adult when I was born,” Sam argued.
“You’re planning to cull them?” Castiel asked in a horrified whisper.
“I thought you hated me, full stop.”
“This is weird,” Dean decided.
“Get your mind out of the gutter,” Dean chided.
“Why did showing our wings become taboo?” Castiel asked coldly.
“And dig up the Angel tablet,” Dean recalled, “Do we have to rescue Meg?”
“My children tore into each other viciously, but the Cage would not let anyone die. When they exhausted themselves, they retreated to opposite corners to recover. Michael was furious with you, but Lucifer wouldn’t let him harm you,” Chuck continued, “He was also angry, but grateful that he was not alone in his incarceration.”
Gabriel grinned at the Hunter and winked. Sam rolled his eyes, knowing that his thoughts were as visible as a billboard.
“Cas; you should be blasting a hole through the wall to get us out of here,” Dean sighed, “Why aren’t you fighting this?”
“What about Nick?” Sam asked Lucifer.
“Father did always like the sound of his own voice,” Gabriel mused, “Balthazar used to joke that I was made the Messenger because people were so sick of Father prattling.”
“My apologies,” Castiel said sarcastically, “I was doing my job watching over the Earth instead of attending every orgy in history.”
“It’s called Empathy, you jerk,” Jane pointed out.
“That was an awkward silence,” Gabriel explained condescendingly, “You’re feeling regret.”
Castiel’s expressions turned contemptuous, “That’s the only reason you won’t kill me?” she summarised, “No wonder Heaven fell into decay under your leadership.”
“So, Father made us all screwed up?” Lucifer huffed.
Castiel had trouble tearing her attention away from Dean, which was a familiar dilemma. She turned toward Faith and ignored Gabriel’s teasing about a ‘female bonding moment’.
“Who would dare sire an abomination?” Michael hissed.
Sam snorted in disbelief.
Gabriel shrugged, “Soul bonds were never my area of expertise.”
“I think I’ve adjusted remarkably well,” Faith pointed out, “If it is something that important, I need to know.”
There was more than a hint of anger in his tone. The divergence from the teasing personality he usually displayed was startling.
“Blame Dad for your lack of education,” Sam retorted easily.
Dean was not bothered, “Works for me.”
“Intentions matter,” Gabriel said simply, “Screwing up is forgivable if you have good intentions – Castiel is a prime example of that.”
Crowley heard a request to visit a specific location on Earth while he was overseeing the latest influx of souls in Hell. The voice was so powerful that the polite wording made him extremely curious.
“You never paint your nails,” Cas pointed out.
“Don’t push me, little girl,” Lucifer growled.
“There’s no list,” Sam assured the Archangel, “That was Dean being a jackass.”
“Rowena,” Sam acknowledged heavily.
Gabriel was intensely grateful that Lucifer had finally gotten over his bratty stage, and he still sympathised enough to try to help. The spiral of depression Lucifer was following could last for days.
“It wasn’t me,” Castiel replied between heavy breaths.
“I just want Kevin to be safe,” Linda replied.
When she sat down, he was already suspicious.
Faith tuned out the conversation in favour of praying to Gabriel. She and Sam had had a long discussion and wanted the Archangel to connect their souls.
“We can’t just give her a bus ticket and wish her luck,” Dean argued.
Dean nodded and made some more weird noises. Castiel recognised them as an agreement.
“If Gabriel can successfully convert my former vessel to a female, possibly,” Castiel replied honestly.
Gabriel tapped his chin thoughtfully, “I could try to blur those particular memories -”
“See?” Cas said with a hint of cruelty Dean associated with his possession by Leviathans, “Full of shit.”
Meg remained slouched back so Dean and Castiel could see each other. Flirting with the Angel was fun, but she could see there was something brewing with the Hunter.
“Clear,” Sam agreed.
Dean glared at her and Castiel replied, “I am unsure how rabbits’ mate, but Dean and I do not engage in copulation.”
Dean eyed the Angel warily, “It sounds friggin’ agonising. I’d be seriously pissed if my junk disappeared.”
“Where is the Archangel Gabriel?” the dick in the white suit asked with a distinctive drawl.
“I don’t know. Do you have human or Demon informants?”
Michael and Lucifer had retreated deeper into the bunker. Sam had been relieved to see them go; even seeing Michael’s power did not detract from the dread evoked by Nick’s face.
was me?” he scoffed, “It sounds like he was all talk and no action.”
“I swear we won’t hurt you,” Dean offered lamely.
“Is he in danger? If he looks like a Nephilim?”
“I’m sure your motives are as pure as a sewage system,” Castiel mused.
“Mmm?”
“Then, why aren’t you letting me up?”
“So, I’m trapped for now – even if I reabsorb my Grace, I can’t go anywhere,” Castiel realized.
“It’s my brother; and your brother slash sister, you perv!” Sam growled as he headed toward the room where Dorothy and the Wicked Witch were stored.
,” Gabriel pointed out, “He doesn’t
“And you have my permission to check my dreams if you think I’m having a nightmare,” Dean added, “I trust you.”
Gabriel chuckled at the wildly fluctuating emotions Lucifer was experiencing.
“Lucifer lashed out verbally, as he often does when he is emotionally vulnerable. You took control of your body and told Michael off.”
“Humans; as soon as they hear my name, they skitter away like I’m going to rip their lungs out.”
“The world ends; not with a bang but a whimper,” Sam said quietly.
Dean had swerved suddenly and slammed on the brakes. Sam recalled seeing a flash of light before he was plunged into Darkness.
“You don’t trust God?” Sam said with a snort, “Somehow, I’m not surprised.”
“I’m not,” Dean complained, “I don’t like seeing my brother marked like bloody cattle.”
“He regarded you as an ally against Michael because he refuses to acknowledge friendship, lest it indicate weakness,” Chuck explained.
Castiel made a disapproving sound. A moment later she flicked her black hair over her shoulder.
“I don’t care how old you are, boy,” she had growled, “I’ll turn you over my knee if you don’t shut your mouth.”
“Where is Cassie?” Balthazar asked with a sigh, “Does he still stare at mortals all night? He might need a mirror to gaze adoringly at Dean.”
Castiel didn’t want Dean to leave, and he felt even worse knowing that he couldn’t accompany the brothers to keep them safe. Gabriel had grudgingly agreed to keep an eye on them to appease Castiel, tactfully leaving out that he had planned on watching them anyway.
“Ah, alright. I’ll see if he wants to meet you.”
The snorting noise and desperate gulps of air from Gabriel prompted a reluctant smile from Dean.
“Castiel retrieved your body after four days of Earth time,” Chuck continued, “Which was over five months in the Cage.”
“Sam is laughing at me,” Lucifer realized with a frown, “You two suit each other.”
“That sounds so wrong,” Dean muttered.
“Emotions cannot bite; they don’t have teeth,” Castiel pointed out.
Balthazar reached for Gabriel with more of his Grace, the echo of a terrified younger sibling seeking safety.
Sam turned sharply and saw Dean when he was expecting to see Cas.
Jane liked exercising her powers for more than hiding. It was liberating to interact with Faith, as the other woman really knew what she was. It was exhilarating to have a friend.
“I’d be tempted to help you,” Jane agreed.
Lucifer sent to Gabriel tightly.
“Plans?” Sam repeated incredulously.
“No,” Dean replied bluntly, “We need to know what Chuck is planning.”
“A little bit,” Sam returned with a smirk, “Gabriel sent me to tell you that he’s over your depressed, broody face and that we have to talk.”
“To give Kevin his life back,” Sam realized.
“My vessel has shared memories of eating,” Gadreel revealed as he sat down next to Lucifer, “It is a strange process.”
Michael backed away from the tornado of emotions Dean was projecting.
“I didn’t realize she had that much power,” Gabriel admitted, “I’ve sent out a call to bring the resurrected Angel to the street outside.”
“I’ll ward the fridge,” Dean threatened.
Gabriel pretended to be offended by the warning, “I am a perfect gentleman,” he protested.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“He’s right, Sam,” Dean agreed from under Cas, “Don’t go all self-loathing on me or I’ll ban you from alcohol for a month.”
Faith rolled off the bed and ducked down to keep the mattress between herself and the Hunter.
Dean studied the small dinosaur before if darted back into the vegetation. He was still amazed that he was seeing an actual dinosaur.
“No; not even with the honesty compulsion Jane struck me with,” Gabriel grumbled.
Gabriel didn’t let go of the rain-soaked Angel until they had descended the flight of stairs.
Instead, Dean asked for help in a quiet voice.
“I’m desperate,” Gabriel sighed, “The memories contained more than they should have; Chuck didn’t warn me that Castiel would recall every second of torture.”
Faith slept surprisingly well during the early morning hours. Sam clearly hadn’t wanted to stay and chat, which she understood. She did feel a pang of loss when he left the room, though she wasn’t sure if it was because she wanted to talk or seduce him.
“I meant the pain went away when we touched,” Dean clarified, rubbing one hand over his heart, “Like something with claws was trapped in my chest and fighting to get out.”
“Apparently, Angels can suffer from depression,” Gabriel mused, “It makes sense; Lucifer is a total psychopath.”
Sam glanced at Faith, who pressed her palm against his spine to encourage him to accept the invitation.
The chorus of confirmation sent an unexpected warmth through his chest. He had never imagined he would find a family on Earth, let alone one which included humans.
Sam grimaced, “No; I don’t even want to think about either of them in that way. So, no; you’ve scarred me enough already.”
“You are really strong,” Sam muttered.
Dean blinked, and Gabriel was gone.
“Didn’t they need Dean to break the First Seal?” Sam asked as he followed the Archangel into the hallway.
“Dean,” Castiel gasped. His hands were gripping the corners of the mattress.
“Coke or orange juice?” Gabriel responded.
Balthazar chuckled, “In a crowded hall full of witnesses; then, he asked if this was really Michaels’ plan, or if Lucifer had found a way to speak through him.”
“Yeah, I didn’t expect that,” Sam agreed. The power thrumming through his body was oddly calm, which Gabriel had assured him was good.
Dean explained with annoyance,
Sam shifted further into the box to lean against the wall just inside the door, “Chuck helped me to sort out what happened in the Cage.”
Jane gulped; the words were reassuring, but the sheer power of the being in front of her was terrifying.
“You’re apologizing to
Gabriel rolled his eyes and pushed the man away, “Threats don’t work, Dean. Archangel, remember?”
“We’re the test case,” Castiel realized.
“And yet, when I’m sad and need a hug, no-one wants to swoop in to comfort me,” Gabriel complained, “He’s like a puppy in a trench-coat.”
Lucifer muttered rhetorically.
Lucifer made a noise of agreement around a mouthful of pancakes.
Castiel woke from a nightmare which involved being repeatedly hit in the head with a hammer. As he adjusted to his surroundings, he realized that the throbbing pain in his head was very real. The exhaustion and aching muscles were more insistent than he had ever felt before.
Gabriel sighed dramatically, “Fine; right here, or in private?”
They were three hours into a Lord of the Rings marathon and Gabriel was feeling rather smug. He was perched in the centre seat of a double-chaise lounge; Sam was sprawled out to his left, playing big spoon against Faith.
Gabriel stared at the ceiling for a few long moments, “After saving me from that awful timeline, I can’t object to anything he plans.”
“And now you want to start experimenting on Angels and humans?” Dean summarised.
“So?”
“The Grace-burn,” Sam said worriedly, “I don’t have any scars like that on my body.”
“It’s none of his business,” Lucifer muttered.
“And the civil war with Raphael? What should I have done differently?”
Sam leaned back, his height not enough to keep his nerves at bay.
“You are lying to me,” Matthias said calmly, “I can see it.”
Castiel sat up and shifted so he was sitting next to Faith. Gabriel moved to sit on the remaining section of the couch.
“Is there a basement?” Sam wondered aloud.
Dean was gone a second later. His rapid footfalls echoed down the hall.
“Castiel needed time to process what I told him,” Gabriel said flatly, “You ripped out your Grace last night, Castiel. If I gave you all the memories straight away, you would have stuck your Angel blade through your heart.”
“Did the movie night count as a ‘date’?” Cas wondered.
“Promise me that you will always talk to me when your thoughts turn this dark,” Dean said seriously.
“And tacky,” Gabriel interrupted.
Faith could see the terror in Castiel’s face even in the dim light. His heart thudded furiously, and his skin was shockingly pale.
By the time Dean and Castiel reappeared, Jane had a large pile of chips in front of her.
A loud knock at the main door gave Dean an excuse to escape from the conversation. By the time he climbed the stairs there was an odd ache in his chest that he hadn’t noticed before.
Sam was reading the final notes in Faiths’ file when she emerged from the bathroom.
“Is Chuck going to stop by for a quick sex-change or something?” Dean joked.
Castiel wanted to reassure the Hunter, but the memories of the original timeline had illustrated the folly of lying to his friends, “I don’t know.”
“Sam!” Dean hissed.
“Fix this,” Castiel said flatly.
Gabriel sauntered into view, flashed a grin at the couple and then headed up the stairs to open the front door.
“She’s right,” Castiel agreed, catching Dean by the arm.
Lucifer had sworn Gabriel to secrecy regarding his emotional struggles. The realisation that being human was full of suffering and indignities was as painful as it was humbling.
Sam was suspicious, “Why the change?”
Dean was not as easily cowed, “Why are you shitty at us?”
Lucifer tried to offer a witty reply, but Sam surged forward, seized control and shoved the Archangel into a box at the back of the Hunter’s mind.
“Why?” Michael asked Balthazar, “Wait; never mind. Dean just provided an awful image.”
Faith was curious to know why Castiel appeared uncomfortable, “Who’s Meg?” she asked.
“That’s the one,” Samandriel confirmed.
“Heaven hasn’t been this good in centuries,” Samandriel said quietly.
“I’m not sure,” Chuck admitted, “Happiness comes from within, and it took me too long to realize you needed to hear me admit to my mistakes before you could accept your own.”
“You returned the memories of the Reaper,” Castiel argued, “That counts.”
“I swear I didn’t use your girly shampoo,” Dean joked.
“Your hands are tiny,” Gabriel noted.
“Sorry for the rough trip,” Dean offered casually, “Let’s just keep the fangs pointed away from my neck.”
Dean said flatly.
“Cas is family; of course, we’ll look after him,” Dean declared.
“Tell me where Gabriel is, or I’ll kill the Winchester.”
Castiel stood up and began pacing, “I’ve inflicted so much damage, I don’t deserve to be happy.”
“Free will is irritating,” Gabriel decided, “Sam is going to be annoyed when I wake him.”
“Some are claiming that you are unfairly targeting ‘Western’ civilisation. Do you believe this is true?”
Gabriel had made a joke about exploring female sexuality with Faith, which he had dismissed as the Archangel making jokes at his expense. Castiel had been surprised when Faith had reluctantly agreed that he needed to learn more about sexuality if he wanted to pursue the bond with Dean.
“You’re not scary, little brother,” Gabriel said with a smile.
“Would you prefer to be compared to single-cell organisms, instead?” Gabriel teased.
Gabriel could see Sam slowly following the trail of logic. Humans were endlessly entertaining, but extremely stubborn.
“Did you try wiping out humans in the first place?” Michael asked.
“Luci has a bloody nose, but dodged fast enough to keep his teeth,” Gabriel continued, “Where the Hell did Dean learn that?”
Sam smiled, “It’s amazing how much you’ve changed since we first met.”
Faith reached out to rest her hand on his knee, “I saw more wins than losses, Sam. My God, you went up against the Devil and won. Don’t be so hard on yourself.”
“I hope she isn’t planning to kill us,” Gabriel replied honestly.
The growl which erupted from Faith sent a strange tingle through Sam. He moved to restrain the Dhampir a moment before she attempted to lunge at Dean.
“I need to put my wings away,” Castiel said heavily, “May I draw on your strength?”
Sam nodded, but couldn’t summon the motivation to turn away from her.
After observing humans for thousands of years, Castiel had been oddly unsettled by the turn of events.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Lucifer hissed with pain but did not flinch away from the blade.
Asmodeus regarded the woman with an amused smirk, “Uncouth, just like the Winchesters. Women associated with the usually die rather quickly. Who are you?”
Gabriel sent as the credits rolled.
“Do we have to?” Meg complained, “I really want to kill him.”
“I’d offer to help with the pain, but it won’t work,” Gabriel said with a frown.
“Only an hour?” Balthazar scoffed, “Cassie needs to work on his stamina.”
Jane muttered ‘good’ when the reported spoke of all nuclear weapons in existence mysteriously disappearing. The rioting and cult pronouncements were less encouraging.
Dean gulped, “You look good, Cas,” he offered, “I can’t believe how similar you look to Jimmy; your eyes -”
Gabriel waited until the cure was completed and only Faith remained awake to approach the Dhampir with an offer.
“I regretted killing you,” Lucifer offered sadly.
“You’re lucky I’m an Angel,” Balthazar grumbled as he pulled her through the hole, “You’re not light.”
“Yes, and I can still see the guilt you carry on your beautiful soul,” Castiel replied easily, “Your scars do not define you; they show how resilient you are.”
“Keep your wings flared, or Dean loses a finger,” Matthias instructed.
“Have you considered Father’s offer to send you back to the moment you were first released from the Cage?”
Considering she was the only Nephilim on the planet, and Heaven wanted her dead, time-travel didn’t seem so far-fetched.
Sam retreated to the room Gabriel had prepared for the Flock. He warned Faith that he was going to confront Lucifer after alerting Gabriel psychically.
The interviewed was remarkably composed; after spending time with God, a bunch of Angels was easy to accept.
“Where did you find her?”
Gabriel howled with mirth, Sam exited the room with a red face and Lucifer felt oddly proud of himself.
“Still not used to that,” Dean said without thinking. The wingtip pulled away sharply to hide behind Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean blinked at Sam without comprehension, “I never called you a Vampire.”
Gabriel smiled, “A friend.”
“How are orgies amusing?” Castiel asked innocently, “They are usually just messy and repetitive.”
Lucifer shoved himself away from the Angel hovering over him, adrenalin surging through his system. Lucifer demanded to know what in Father’s name Gadreel was doing.
“Understatement of the month,” Faith commented loudly, “He’s been using his Grace to block the pain, and seriously pining.”
“As this is a memory, we are observers only. None of the animals will be able to sense you in any way.”
“Not enough!” Gabriel piped up.
“Knife and fork, dude,” Sam instructed between bites of bacon and eggs.
“Good,” Cas purred, running one hand through Dean’s hair and another along his neck, “I enjoy being close to you.”
Castiel retrieved the pillow in silence. He did not see the way Dean watched him with a concerned frown.
Faith had a faint awareness of his physical presence, though there was no urge to seek him out. Sam remained at the forefront of her thoughts; it was as if her body was stating a clear preference.
run out!”
“Yes, Father,” Gabriel said aloud.
Sam wasn’t convinced that the title didn’t apply. Thankfully, the buzz of Angelic power under his skin did not fill him with the shame which always accompanied Demon blood.
“I’ve broken them into segments of time,” Gabriel explained, “I need to give you the complete set up to the Angels falling; you know the main points already.”
Gabriel glanced between the four of them silently gathering his own courage.
“Let’s go,” Dean urged, “Your presence makes her worse.”
“We were in a memory,” Dean recalled, “Cas! What happened? He’s gone!”
“You both have a lot of television to catch up on,” Dean said with a grin.
The Angel wasn’t surprised to find Dean already in the hallway. He was sure the Hunter didn’t realize one hand was rubbing his chest right above his heart.
“All human should be crushed,” Lucifer grumbled.
Castiel found the change in Dean’s behaviour to be quite baffling. She was still an Angel, yet the Hunter was hovering closer than usual and smiling more during dinner.
“I’m not sure yet.”
“Why?”
Gabriel twirled a bottle cap on the table, “In Heaven, Castiel had his emotions continually ripped out of his mind. Spending time with you two allowed him to develop far beyond the limitations of any Angel. He wasn’t really living until he chose you over Heaven,” he directed the last sentence directly to Dean.
Meg emerged from her room just after midday. She looked exhausted and miserable.
“Really?”
Dean was quite attractive too, she admitted to herself. He was classically handsome whereas Sam had a sense of vulnerability which drew her attention. Faith was sure Dean was a heartbreaker with more emotional baggage than anyone could ever recover from.
“They can’t all be death and mass-destruction,” Amara assured him, “It’s fun for a while, but convincing Dean to let himself be happy takes more planning.”
“Why are hideouts always so dark and ugly?” Dean asked as he surveyed the abandoned warehouse, “Just once, I want to hunt in a fancy hotel with a nest of something in the penthouse.”
Castiel was silently thankful that he didn’t need to breathe because his throat closed up. He offered a wordless nod to accept an honour only bestowed on a handful of Angels.
Dean and Castiel heard the last pronouncement before they moved into view.
“They were real,” Castiel whispered, “Memories.”
“Meet me and Balthazar at the house in two minutes,” Gabriel ordered, “I have something for each of you.”
Castiel grabbed the blade and spun it around to use the very tip to cut the edge of his throat. Sam and Dean lunged forward to stop him, but Gabriel was faster.
“Sam has locked your Grace away,” Faith pointed out, “So you’re dealing with an avalanche of emotions you’re not equipped to deal with. Gabriel even mentioned some tears.”
Lucifer stood up abruptly, prompting Sam to take an involuntary step backward. The humanoid form he maintained was a mixture of features from previous vessels, shifting obscenely.
A familiar banner reading ‘Congratulations’ appeared in the air behind Sam and Faith.
“She went to Heaven, if that’s any consolation,” Gabriel offered, “The memories of his humiliation at the hands of Lucifer should haunt him for eternity. I look forward to seeing his reaction when he finds out how he dies.”
Dean took his time with his breakfast, even as Michael’s demanding tone turned to pleading.
Castiel made a stricken noise, “Sam was only traumatised because his soul lost the protection of his body?”
“I don’t want to claim your soul just because you think being my bitch is an easier option,” Gabriel said harshly, “A Flock bond is about family and trust; not desperation.”
Dean mumbled something and rolled over, so his back was facing his brother and the Archangel.
Dean regarded the feathers in every shade of grey with awe. He reached out carefully to run one finger along the closest feather.
The colours lightened, “Yes; not your judgement sometimes, but I do trust you.”
“I was an arrogant psychopath,” Lucifer protested, “I couldn’t grasp what I was doing until Dad used Sam to mess with me head. Now, I can see that I was being an asshole.”
“None of these people are Werewolves,” Gabriel revealed, “Though a few do bite.”
Faith sat up to regard the man who was watching her with clear concern.
“Michael,” Castiel greeted tightly.
Faith backed away and sat down on the chair next to him, “You passed out for a few seconds,” she said quietly.
“But another Angel could fall for the same lie?” Jane theorised, “I will always be a target.”
,” Jane giggled.
“Hello, Dean,” the warm body rumbled.
“Talking, singing, throwing firecrackers; anything to keep my attention fixed on him,” Sam recalled.
Dean forgot to remain offended, “Seriously? You swap a dick for a pair of boobs and barely notice?”
“Is this your version of torture?” Lucifer wondered, “Drag me down to the level of you apes by talking about my ‘feelings’?”
Sam smiled, “Something is stopping you, and it’s pissing you off.”
The expression on Gabriel’s face switched from relaxed to menacing in an instant. He nailed the taller Winchester with an intense glare.
“Did you apologize?” Gabriel asked pointedly.
Dean grunted as the Angel slumped against him, “Cas! What’s wrong?”
“Can Gabriel change your vessel to a female?”
“Can you stand?” Gabriel asked gently, “I can get rid of the iron bar, but I don’t want you to fall on your face.”
Sam had felt the fangs pierce his skin and then immediately retract. He could feel her tongue sliding along his skin to lap up the blood. His head dropped forward and until his forehead pressed against her right shoulder.
“What’s up, Bitches?” Charlie greeted happily.
Faith had trouble reconciling this new knowledge with the non-threatening man who regarded her with worried eyes.
“Stay,” the wounded Angel said flatly. Dean wasn’t sure if it was a plea or an order.
Sam glared at him, “Don’t compare torture to having empathy.”
“She’s covered in a layer of dust,” Sam called to Dean, “The Sleep Spell has definitely held. One of the other keys might -”
“That was Gabriel,” Dean answered, “He’s saving humans and hiding them, or something. We’re prisoners.”
“Fine; but if anyone waves a cross at me, I’ll stick it up their -”
“We’re in human vessels, discussing pornography and your future vanilla seduction of Dean Winchester; human milestones are quite relevant,” Gabriel decided, “I’ve had male lovers in the past, but Dean isn’t my type; he talks too much. That’s why I suggested the ball-gag.”
“No; the same one,” Castiel assured him quietly.
“What?” Dean observed the expression he called ‘Bitchface No. 4’ on his brother. Usually, it indicated a serious problem or food poisoning.
Castiel leaned into Dean gratefully, “Why is there a gallery for peanuts?”
Dean felt like he was looking at the scary Angel who stalked into the barn more than four years earlier. It took a few seconds for Dean to recognise his trusted friend again.
“Whatever. Did Gabriel get Baby? I forgot to ask what that cow did to her.”
Sam nodded and the smile fell into a frown, “You have all the memories too?”
Samandriel had missed Gabriel more than he had ever realized. Being close to the Archangel and feeling the overwhelming Grace brush up against his own was wonderful. They remained there for well over an hour, simply enjoying the closeness neither had been able to enjoy in so long.
“My fate is inconsequential,” Castiel stated blandly.
“Look forward to the pizza,” Dean replied cheekily.
Dean was grateful for anything which would distract him from the thought of bonding with anyone, “Then he’ll be able to use his wings?”
“My former cause was being a dick?” Lucifer guessed.
“Hello,” Chuck returned easily, “Sam can see my True Form, now.”
Castiel fell silent and sighed with relief.
Dean’s hand squeezed tightly as he processed the implication of Castiel’s statement, “You saw me torturing souls?”
“Exactly; I’ll be interested to see how you and Dean adjust to unforeseen changes. If you don’t bond with Dean, another Angel might find they are rather compatible with the Righteous Man, too.”
“The memories knocked him out?” Sam asked incredulously. Beside him, Dean was swearing.
Sam added.
“Lucifer is claiming innocence?” Dean asked sceptically.
“May I ask why?” Castiel asked hesitantly.
Dean found Cas in the room he had been guided into the previous night. He was lying on the bed in the foetal position, in an echo of his collapse onto the bed while drunk. Thankfully, Cas was sober this time; Dean refused to dwell on the memory of helping Cas undress.
“Yes. I was weak and made serious mistakes which got people killed,” Sam admitted.
“Or you could stop being a jerk and just tell me?” Dean snapped.
“Castiel?” Samandriel sounded so happy to see her, which confused Castiel.
“Thank-you, Sam,” Faith said quietly.
“No small talk?” Gabriel scoffed, “No wonder you two are always single; foreplay is as important to conversation as it is to sex. Don’t skip the entrée, boys.”
His eyes slid down her body possessively, leaving Faith feeling rather dirty.
Gabriel enjoyed spending time with Linda. The feisty woman dismissed his status as an Archangel and didn’t hesitate to grab him by the ear when he made a blatantly inappropriate suggestion.
“Cas looks a lot like Faith, now,” Gabriel noted, “Don’t get them mixed up, Sammy!”
Faith heard the subtle rush of blood which heralded the slight blush in the cheeks of the former Angel. Thankfully, she was not craving blood at all.
“When he wakes, we have to convince him to change vessels,” Gabriel said with a frown, “The best way to heal, without returning to Heaven, is in the company of a human soul.”
“You’re like Cas,” Gabriel realized, “Tired and unkempt. Does no-one look after their Grace anymore?”
“And annoying; thank Chuck Balthy is keeping her busy.”
“Hello, Winchesters!” Gabriel greeted happily, “You look so adorable, cuddling your Angels like that.”
Dean wanted to argue, and Sam waited for the overprotective-brother instincts to kick in.
Dean nodded, “Alright, then. Let’s move Sleeping Beauty upstairs.”
Castiel returned the clothing to the bathroom, though the thought of disrobing in front of Dean was interesting.
“Yes! Dean is having a similar effect on Michael, though it’s not happening as fast. The process was
“I would like to see the safe house,” Jane decided, “Having somewhere to go where Angels can’t follow would be useful.”
The concern which flowed from Dean was hard to describe. Castiel felt the emotion while images flashed through his mind.
Sam waved a folder at his brother, “This file is marked as ‘Active’! In 1958 a prisoner was put in an enchanted sleep and left there.”
“Dean can still see my wings,” Castiel informed Gabriel.
Balthazar emitted a growling noise which made Gabriel laugh. Jane reached out to rest one hand on her mate’s knee.
“Can I eat before we disturb all the dust?”
“It’s a metaphor. I was pointing out how oblivious men can be, and sometimes downright stubborn.”
“Are they as solid as they were before the chant?” Castiel asked.
“Of course,” Gabriel agreed with a grin, “It’s instinctual and necessary for survival.”
“Of course,” Sam agreed.
“Castiel worries too much,” Gabriel said dismissively.
Castiel remained hopeful that he and his allies would defeat Naomi well before Dean or Sam died. If God wouldn’t return, Gabriel could run Heaven. He denied wanting the responsibility, but he would be just.
“Gabe, Lucifer is laughing at the idea of closing the Gates of Hell,” Sam said wearily, “Can you explain the joke, or do I have to gag him?”
Castiel could feel the anxiety blossom within Dean. He wasn’t sure how to reassure his friend that witnessing his sexual exploits would not alter his opinion of the Hunter.
“Who has the Angel tablet?” Castiel asked Gabriel, “Tell me and I will let Faith bite me.”
Lucifer snorted derisively, “You say that like it would be easy.”
“You could eject him at any time,” Chuck added, “That would be the only way for him to leave, unless Gabriel pulls him out.”
