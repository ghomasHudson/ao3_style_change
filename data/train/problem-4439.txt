Exactly one week after Cas had sacrificed himself for Dean, after he’d
Cas had told Dean he loved him, then died for him, and now clearly couldn’t stand the sight of him. It left Dean with very little choice; he couldn’t spend his afterlife searching for someone he just couldn’t have. That didn’t mean he wasn’t about to wallow in it for at least a little while, though.
So Dean did that in the only way he can think of and leans in slowly to kiss his angel, his gaze flicked to Cas and after a moment of brief surprise, Cas met him halfway. The press of the angel’s lips and Dean was gone. It was momentary slightly awkward, but then it became good,
It had been as if his brother’s strings had been cut, Sam had collapsed to the ground and Rosa had followed suit, dropping straight out of the air with a sickening thud as her body crashed onto the frozen soil of the graveyard. The witch’s magic had been almost instantly effective. Sam hadn’t stood a chance.
“I would prefer if you would refrain from attacking me in future.”
Cas could tell instantly exactly what this man was. It was written all over his body language.
“How much time we talking here?”
Dean tried another prayer as he got into his Impala, Cas, come on man, talk to me. I - please, just please Cas. He waited, but exactly how long was impossible to say.
It seemed like it was Dean’s turn to do something dramatic. He didn’t have time to prepare for pain because it was a sudden, unexpected white hot burning on his shoulder. He couldn’t think - his only response was to scream. He was only vaguely aware of his daemon whining and someone shouting his name. Later he realised it must have been Cas.
“What’s wrong with him?” the hunter barked, panicked, quickly leaning in to touch his brother shoulders to keep him from moving too much.
“Dean, stay with your brother. He needs you, so you’re gonna stay exactly where you are and suck it up.”
The worrying black lines on his brother’s arm hadn’t gone anywhere since Castiel’s interference. That was the biggest relief. His brother wasn’t getting any worse and he no longer writhed in pain as he had done when Cas had begun his treatment.
Dean dropped his hand to his side and his daemon sniffed at it. Her nose wrinkled. Cas watched as the other man and his daemon shared a moment, communicating silently through their body language. Castiel looked away and found some dressing in a first aid tin for Dean to wrap round his arm.
“Listen, man. You’re my best friend-”
He was perched on a stool in Heaven’s replica of Ellen and Joe’s Roadhouse, one of the first places he’d been after finding himself, or rather imagining himself, a home. He was now a regular since it turned out home didn’t really feel like home when he couldn’t share it with Cas.
“He’ll be fine,” Bobby reiterates; his blunt tone calmed Dean. He sounded so sure that Dean almost believed him. Almost. He’d believe it when he sees it. “I know someone who can help,” he said and then added in afterthought, “Just try not to piss him off.”
“I’m aware.”
Please forgive any mistakes!
Castiel stopped before the open arch into the kitchen and felt a twinge of irritation at the mess. He didn’t even have the magic to fix up his kitchen quickly. Healing magic was, for him, particularly tiring. But that’s one of the things his family liked about him – his magic was better used as a weapon. The hand print glowing on Dean’s shoulder was a reminder of that. His brother Lucifer’s magic was just the same. He suppressed a shudder at the thought.
And that - that hurt something awful. Once again that pain, the tightness in his chest that had made him feel like he couldn’t breathe, was back. Not that it had truly even left since Cas had died for him yet again.
And then the warlock fell backwards, Dean swore and his instincts caused him to snatch at the guys arm to stop him cracking his head on the floor. He pulled the guy onto the foot of the bed, wincing at the pain it caused his chest, but Sam’s gigantic body was so big that Cas was lying at an awkward angle over Sam’s feet. Sam had stopped shaking and the black magic had, as far as Dean could see, retreated somewhat.
And yet, Cas was nowhere to be found.
He clutched the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white. He wanted to scream. Break something. He turned the key in the engine, letting Baby purr and drove her far into the middle of nowhere so no one could watch him do what he was about to do. Except probably Jack.
The latter was chosen when Dean began yelling insults and ‘monster’ slipped out of his lips. For a second, Cas saw only red. And it only took that fraction of a second for him to slip up. His magic reacted without him even thinking.
For a moment, Cas had no idea what he was talking about. But then it hit him – the family photograph taken when he was much younger on a holiday. Before Cas knew – before they all knew – what the family business really was. Though Cas suspected Michael and Lucifer, the more he thought about it, probably already knew or were at least vaguely aware of what was truly happening. How they made their fortune. It had been a rude awakening when he found out and he hadn’t even been meant to, at least not at that point. Naomi, his mother, hadn’t believed him to be ready. Cas supposed she was right but he never stopped feeling relieved that Gabriel at told him.
The warlock gave him a small smile, “I’m under the impression your brother is in need of some help. Shall we?” he motioned towards the door, but he didn’t move and Dean was grateful, knowing that he was waiting for Dean’s permission.
“Probably for the best,” he agreed. “I can get you something that’ll promote healing?”
“Alright. How can I be of assistance?”
Glass shattered onto the driver’s seat, onto the ground around him. The bonnet, the hood, the tires, what did it even matter when this was heaven? What did it matter if they were completely ruined? All it took was a thought and his Baby would be perfect again cause in heaven you could have anything you wanted.
“You bastard,” Dean gave up moving his brother to abruptly charge at Cas.
But a part of him was also jealous.
With his spare hand he returned to examine the origin of the magic currently trying it’s best to kill. He could feel the power it was giving out and now that he was pushing his magic against it, it was a little more difficult that he had first believed.
Dean swallowed heavily. “It’s Sam. I don’t know what to do,” his voice wavers.
Burning a hand print into Dean’s arm wasn’t the most shameful things Castiel had done, but it was up there in the greatest hits. At least this mark would heal, which he couldn’t say was the case for some of the other things he’d done. Speaking of healing, though, the Winchesters were going to put a rather large dent into his supplies. But, he supposed, some of that was his own fault. He was just relieved that there would be no long lasting damage to the hunter. Not because he was attached to Dean in any way - that would be ridiculous - but because he didn’t want any of his magic causing harm someone who didn’t deserve it.
He also didn’t have any on speed dial – no surprises there. But he did have the next best thing. Sort of.
They didn’t talk until after both of them had finished their breakfast. Dean tried to ignore the quiet and he now realised that there must be a clock somewhere because he could hear the unrelenting ticking.
There was no easy way to answer that question. At heart, Cas wanted to help people but right now the person who needed his help happened to be an overly-protective hunter who had tried to kill him. So why hadn’t he kicked him out already? Somehow he’d managed over the period of half a day to grow invested. Bobby trusted that Cas could fix Sam so he felt a measure of responsibility to do what he could.
The fuck?
“What tell ya; I’ve had to take care of more than my fair share of injuries – though none quite like this, gotta say.” Dean shot him a charming smile but Cas wasn’t convinced of the carefree attitude that Dean was presenting himself with. He couldn’t think that having to stitch yourself back up over and over again was anything less than miserable. He felt a pang of sympathy for the hunter. Hunting was, needless to say, a dangerous job. A job which you weren’t paid for doing nor got much, if any, thanks for and it almost always ended in the inevitable demise of the hunter.
His ‘guest’ really was wrecking his house, “Dean!” Castiel barked, gaining the other’s attention instantly.
“If Castiel hadn’t pulled that handprint stunt, I might even be impressed.” She was lying at the foot of the bed, Sam’s legs next to her under a white quilt, her head rested on the soft fabric.
“Heal me?” Dean laughed, cruelly. “I’m sure,” even in the concussed state he was in, he hadn’t lost his sarcasm. Cas tried not to let it grate at his nerves but Dean had a way of get on every single one of them and he’s known him for less than twenty-four hours. As Cas was considering giving up and fixing him with the brush of his fingers, Dean mumbled, “You’re a Milton.”
“I need your help.” The words seemed to be almost forced from his mouth, obviously unable to conceal his disgust at the very thought of asking a non-human for help. Typical hunter. It was also said in such a way that it felt like an order more than a request which really made Castiel want to slam the door in this guy’s face. With the attitude the hunter displayed, the warlock didn’t feel that inclined to help him, in fact Cas was more tempted to finish him off more than anything. By the looks of it, it wouldn’t take much.
Dean kept his expression blank and responded, “Duly noted.” Dean rolled on his feet and Cas watched as he considered his own body, his lips parted in surprise when he felt no pain. His green eyes flickered over to Cas but he said nothing and then just as quickly looked away.
“Milton Medicine ruined my life,” Dean finally looked at him again, his eyes brimmed with anger that Cas didn’t think was still aimed at him, though god only knows he deserved it. At the forefront of all of it was pain. Cas could read it off him a mile away. His parents business had caused a lot of pain to an awful lot of people. He felt he should be used to it by now, the guilt, the stab of pain in his chest that almost took his breath away, but every time he thought about it, every time he came across anyone affected, it was as heart breaking as the last.
There was no saying how long he'd been sitting there, time moving wildly differently to that on earth, but for Dean it felt like only a few minutes since he'd sat before the peaceful air was disturbed by the tell-tale sign of an angel.
“I think we got off on the wrong foot. I would like to remedy that, if you’ll allow it,” Cas said slowly. It sounded unsure to Dean’s ears and Dean made no comments which Cas seemed to take as a confirmation to continue. “I’ve not been the best host. You are, after all, my guest and I want us to get along, at least until you can leave with you brother. I know you don’t want to be here but whilst you are here, I believe it would be better was us to try and work out our differences. If we can’t do that, we’ll just have to avoid each other best we can,” he began to ramble but Dean didn’t stop him as he wasn’t quite ready to talk.
“Yep. Can you fix him?” Cas could detect a hit hope that he would bet the hunter was trying to conceal from him.
Castiel opened his eyes, fully in control of his magic, and watched the blue tinged power flow from his palm through his patient’s chest. If someone were to touch his hand, Cas knew, it would feel burning hot but he couldn’t feel anything but a tingle – almost like pins and needles. Starting from the heart would help protect it from any effects of the dark magic and then Cas would work backwards. Unfortunately there were several reasons it couldn’t be done all at once.
“Pontiac, Illinois.”
life – Cas didn’t owe him anything. And now, the hunter was beginning to irritate him. He was not a morning person and he temper was starting to stir. “Tell me what’s going on.”
“How about the fact you love me. Let’s start there.”
“You’re also scaring the other customers.” She nodded towards the rest of the room where the rest of the customers had apparently tried to sit as far away from him as possible. It was almost comical, as if he’d got his very own people repellent.
But he didn’t seem to be getting better either.
He swallowed; his throat so raw it hurt. “Why are you avoiding me?”
He’d been in heaven for what felt to him like several weeks. He’d seen his mum, Charlie, Bobby, Ellen and Jo and that was only scratching the surface. Reuniting with everyone he’d ever lost. Well. Almost everyone.
Dean laughed a little hopelessly and perhaps slightly manically, “Well, surprise, guess you fell in love with an idiot.” The moment he said it, he flinched. Face dropping and gaze falling to the floor.
“Stop lying,” Dean tugged at his brother, attempting to pick his up but not having an easy time of, still injured from the day before.
Dean shot round like a startled cat, his face immediately darkening at the sight of him. Castiel was at a loss to why that would be. He can’t have done anything in his sleep. So why did Dean look like he was ready to gut him? The hunter’s mood swings were already starting to bother him and he hadn’t known the man more than a day.
“My name. It’s Castiel.”
Cas resigned to losing this debate, deciding that he was too tired to shoot snarky comments back and forth about their lifestyle choices and instead tried for a joke, “I don’t think our hair’s long enough to braid,” he kept his voice level and in the same serious tone as before.
Cas was awoken suddenly by the sound of pained grunting and cursing coming from beyond his closed bedroom door. It sounds like someone was attempting to move something heavy along his corridor, like a large box filled with heavy items or small elephant, maybe. Castiel surmised that neither of those thing were very likely and it was obviously his guest making all the racquet. He ran his hand through his hair which he knew would be stuck up in every direction. Every attempt to tame it failed until Cas gave up.
He swallowed the lump of fear in his throat and whispered, “Not anymore,” He shook his head violently, “I want nothing to do with them…How do you even…?” Castiel didn’t understand at all.
A hunter.
Heaven was now designed so that if you wanted to see someone, all you had to do was take a walk or a drive and you’d find yourself, sooner or later, with the person, or angel in this case, you wanted to see.
Castiel didn’t smile back - it would have felt hollow. “Hunting is perilous.”
Dean studied him for any sign he was lying until he saw whatever it was that he needed. “You even still want us here?”
“No, don’t. I know you’re not.”
"Hello, Dean." And it was like every time before and yet completely and totally different.
He was stunned and he found himself taking a small step back. His mouth parted at the dismissive tone laced into Cas’ voice. But no, he wasn’t going to let Cas derail him.
Castiel took both of their plates over to the sink and turned the tap on, “If you have any questions, I’ll answer them honestly.”
She hadn’t said a word since Sam had been injured.
“Up the stairs, to your left,”
Cas just stares, but this time his eyes wide and wet, the steely exterior non-existent. “Dean, I thought you said I was like a brother to you?”
“That’s good news,” Dean sensed something in Bobby’s tone that made him tense, “but I got some bad news.” When did they not? “I’m tellin’ you this, not because I want you involved, but because I need you and Sam to stay out of trouble.”
That being said, he wasn’t going down without a fight and he could control his magic. He was about ninety percent sure of it. And Dean had one huge flaw – he was fighting with no forward thinking. He was reckless and letting his emotions cloud his judgement. For that reason, his technique had only one aim, brute strength. Fortunately Castiel knew how counter it.
Thank God.
Dean scooted the wooden chair forward, cringing at the horrid noise it made against the flood. Hopefully that hadn’t disturbed Cas. Reaching forward he ran his fingers down her soft flank and she shifted from her spot to nuzzle her head alongside his.
Dean wasn’t stupid; he could put two and two together - if Cas didn’t want to be found, it wouldn’t matter how long drove with Baby, how desperately he prayed to him, just to see him, to talk.
“I suppose not,” Cas muttered. If Dean said she was dead, then he supposed it didn’t really matter anymore.
The only response Cas received was silence and after a minute or so, he thought that was the only answer he would get. He expected a nod, nothing more, because he couldn’t blame him if wanted to leave. Bobby might know someone else anyway and now that Sam was stable it gave them chance to consider somebody else.
“Yes, Dean, I am. I’m not sorry I saved your life but I’m sorry you didn’t get to live more. You shou-”
Cas raised an eyebrow. “Yes, Dean - Jack isn’t a monster.” Cas’ eyes glazed over for a second and then cleared. “I have always felt we were one species short, I look forward to meeting Miracle.”
The warlock hovered over him, avoiding contact with the daemon, looking at the curse that was spreading up his arm and had started its track along the man’s shoulder. Twisting the guy’s arm so that Cas could see the palm of his hand, he could inspect the thoughtful little signature that the witch had gifted to him - a small black mark that looked almost like a knotted rope.
It was good to hear the reassurance, “Yeah. I’ll talk to you later.” He hung up, too distracted to have meaningful conversation. He toyed with the idea of researching the hunter’s deaths, maybe making a few calls to some other hunters. But if he did that, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from going out and trying to gank the sonofabitch who was behind this. And then he’d have to leave Sam. He couldn’t do that right now. He couldn’t leave him with someone he barely knew. Not a chance. Especially when that guy was probably passed out and unable to monitor Sam’s condition.
The wolf daemon growled, sight fixated on Cas’ hissing margay, perhaps sensing that he was not feeling particularly charitable today – at least to hunters. Cas didn’t care. Like he said, the man in front of him currently looked like he was about to fall over without any help whatsoever from him, so he wasn’t exactly feeling threatened.
A crowbar clattered into the ground beside him.
Cas grabbed at a towel and dried his hands. He came over to Dean and held out a hand. “Hello, my name’s Castiel Novak. I’m a warlock and my social skills are a little rusty.”
As Cas straightened his posture from leaning partially over the bigger Winchester, he asked, “So Bobby sent you?” Dean had name dropped the much older hunter when they moved Sam into the house. Cas wished he’d known in advance. It was possible that Bobby he called him but he’d not had his phone with him.
But Cas was now struggling to keep his head up and his concentration was wavering. The only mercy was that Cas didn’t have the power for there to be a surge that would surely obliterate Sam’s insides instantly, but much more of it and the younger hunter wouldn’t be able to handle that either.
Castiel stepped towards him but Dean backed away at the same time. A sigh came from the other man, “Dean, please, I need to see it. I need-”
Dean’s momentum as he crashed into him sent them both straight to the floor. Cas didn’t even try to avoid it, he only braced himself and restrained the tight coil of magic that hissed at him to be let free. His magic had reacted oddly to Dean last time; he didn’t want to find out what it would do at almost full strength.
The hunter blinked and took a moment to respond, as if shocked by Cas’ question in some way.  “Um Dean.” He cleared his throat, “Dean Winchester. And that’s Sam,” his voice was guarded, like Cas was tricking him in some way.
Dean told himself that that was to be expected considering the warlock had told him it would be a long process. Patience, however, was definitely not one of his strong suits. It never had been. His brother got all huffy when Dean got bored during stake outs and then Rosa would flap her wings in a gesture that Dean took to mean as giving him the finger.
Naomi wanted to leave this legacy to her five children. Cas had spat it right back in her face. They were monsters and Cas would be damned if he ended up anything like them.
There was a knock at the front door that sounded more like the person was trying to put their fist through the glass. It certainly got Cas’ attention but he rather thought that that was the entire point. Castiel had no idea of who it was but he believed anyone who wished him harm would probably not make themselves known first. Still, he approached with caution, going through his living room and into the hallway. He could see a figure of a male through the fuzzy glass panel so he unlocked the door and opened it, poking his head round first. His eyes instantly widened and he let the door swing fully open.
Dean couldn’t be mad, well, he knows he could be, but he doesn’t actually care. The very sight of Cas alive and in front of him made that impossible now he’d gotten over the initial shock. “I’m just glad you’re here now, man.” He understood, he’d be a hypocrite if he couldn’t. He was the master of running away from his emotions, that was pretty much the Dean Winchester way. Until now. Cas deserved his honesty and he damn well deserved to be happy.
Dean wasn’t sure Cas was on anyone’s side particularly, “How did you even know he would help us?”
He shouldn’t be thinking about how the man before him would look if he really smiled and was, well, a little less covered in blood. Cas imagined that it would light up his whole face. He wondered when the last time Dean smiled genuinely. Hunting is not the kind of occupation that made a person feel happy. It went hand in hand with pain and loss. Not much to smile about in Cas’ book. A sudden desire to make Dean laughed startled him inwardly.
“Stay the hell away from us,” Dean spat at him. Cas could do nothing but relay his look of confusion, he didn’t break away from Dean’s thunderous face to give his daemon a look for fear that the moment he did so, Dean would do something they’d both likely regret. The wolf by Dean’s side was showing off her equally lethal teeth, aiming it at Sofia. Sofia didn’t bother responding; she didn’t know what they were meant to be fighting about this time.
“I’m sorry.”
“I think you would regret leaving,” Cas said.
**********
The hunter let him go, his fingers unfurling from him slowly, but didn’t back up.
Except, apparently, the one thing he craved the most.
“Not conscious but alive and not getting any worse,”
What he saw next was not at all what he’d expected. His patient was lying on the floor just before the stairs at the top of the hall, his raven daemon on his chest. A couple of boxes filled with old items destined for his loft were no longer stack neatly, but cluttering up the path along the upstairs.
“He better have an excellent excuse for this noise,” Sofia grumbled, flexing her claws. Cas watched through narrowed eyes – he didn’t wanted claw sized holes in his bed sheets. They’d already had to replace several sets since she’d settled for that reason. He didn’t understand why she kept doing it.
When they’d gone Sofia hoped up on to the table and lied down. Castiel pulled out a chair and slumped into it. Today was doing its best to kick him to curb. He needed to check up on the unconscious hunter lying in his guest bed but he couldn’t convince himself to move. Unless Sam’s condition changed, there was nothing Cas could do for the time being – he didn’t want to rick overloading the Winchester and he himself wasn’t doing too well either. The next step was to figure out some remedy that would help the process quicker, but currently Castiel was more concerned he’d add to the mess on the floor by dropping ingredients.
The warlock rubbed his eyes with fingers, “You’re agitated, I understand, but would you please stop.” He moved Sofia’s tail from the top of his laptop. “I need to concentrate.”
The hunter froze. “Just a burn?” he said slowly. What was they meant to mean? If this had some freaky magical consequences, he just might kill him...after he knew his brother would be alright. But then he would kill him.
So why now?
Castiel cautiously met his eyes but Dean was way too uncomfortable to maintain the eye contact.
Finally Dean shifted. “You ever killed anyone?”
“It’s okay, kid, just tell me what happened,” Bobby does a better job than Dean could ever do at remaining calm when Sam is hurt.
Castiel’s eyes flickered open and widened comically, “Dean? Wha-” he reached out to push himself away from the hunter, placing a hand over his shoulder in the process.
Sam smirked some as he watched Cas scoot closer to Dean but he made no comment, he wouldn’t tease Cas. As Dean started to eat the former angel had gone to use the bathroom and Sam snickered out “How’s the food Honeybee?”
Dean didn’t reply to his brother this time and just went to his room. Dean changed into his fed suit, he had had it cleaned last week, and they hadn’t had a case, so it was still in pristine condition. Dean trimmed his stubble, and then put on his favorite cologne before studying himself in the mirror for a moment, and maybe silently giving himself a pep talk, because despite his brother confidence Dean’s was shakey. Dean finally grabbed the bouquet and the jar of honey, before he went back into the library, where Cas was enthralled with whatever lore book he was reading. Dean took a breath before clearing his throat to make sure Cas looked up at him. Cas gasped gently at the bundle of flowers and the jar of honey.
Cas nodded as he moved to make Dean’s coffee, “Alright, well if you need anything while you are out there, pray to me.”
Dean did his best to relax, but he was freaked out and he couldn’t remember at all what happened, the last thing he clearly remembered was telling that Cas he was going to go for a walk.
Dean closed his eyes tightly, thrusting up into Cas’ hand desperately. Dean was vaguely aware of his mouth moving but his heart pounded loudly in his ears,. “Fuck Cas, Cas fuck, Cas… I’m close don’t stop, don’t stop please…”
Cas gave a small chuckle and shrugged softly, “More of Hawaii Five-O, I have almost finished the seasons that are on Netflix,” After studying Sam for a moment he asked, “Are you going for a run?”
Dean frowned but nodded and moved closer to Cas clinging to him and bracing himself for the flight. Cas closed his eyes and flew to where he could feel Gabriel’s grace when both the angel and the hunter opened their eyes, they found themselves in the Impala.
6 hours later Cas woke up, Cas groaned gently, wincing at the same time from the pain as he was pulled into awareness. “Ow…” Cas muttered softly.
Dean hummed gently, “I will take a scotch and soda, and he will have a glass of champagne, something sweet.”
Dean sighed but ignored Gabe’s annoyance and bad mood before replying to his angel, “I will talk to Sammy, but I can’t force him to do anything. Anyway, Baby needs a wash, you wanna help me out angel?”
Cas shook his head vehemently and used his grace to hide his wings, he hated them, desperately hated them. So many angels had shunned him simply because of the black color, and then they had gotten burned carrying Dean out of Hell, “They are hideous Dean…”
Cas nodded and moved out of Dean’s way so Dean could look. Dean easily found all the pieces in Cas’ size. Dean handed them to him then looked at Cas, “Do you want to pay for it?”
Lost my feet, lost my soul;
The girl chuckled and nodded, “My girlfriend says I am the same way,” She takes the card from Dean, sliding it before handing it back to Dean. After carefully wrapping the flowers and grabbing a few floral food packets she gives Dean the flowers, “Okay here ya go! I would wish you luck, but you seem pretty confident, so I will say congrats.”
Dean finds his old sketchbook from high school, filled exclusively with drawings of Mary. Dean asks to draw Cas and then pushes to see his angel's wings.
Sam cheered excitedly, “Bath time!!”
Dean shook his head some not caring and pulling his angel close to him again, pressing his lips firmly to Castiel’s. His whole body felt completely relaxed, and he truthfully almost felt high with energy from the ritual.
The fake Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, "Castiel, my king please talk to me."
The dragon had grabbed him and taken him to the sewers, torturing him and collecting his blood even if Cas’ didn’t know why. Cas had deep cuts to his chest and wrists, not to mention a few burns from the dragon as well. The former angel was in and out of consciousness on their way back to the motel.
Dean sighed more heavily this time before taking a deep breath, “I was going to… I have… I have just been nervous about this Sammy,”
Gabriel tried to fly back to his spot, Dean and Sam closed their eyes when the light was too bright, but Cas could still see the fledgling and caught Gabriel midflight, looking at him sternly, “Gabriel, you can not fly unless, in an emergency, Samuel and Dean are human, they cannot look at your grace, and you can hurt them. You do not wish to hurt Sam or Dean correct?”
Dean looks at the clock again and tries to hold back a sigh. It had been nearly two hours now since Sam and Gabriel had gone to get dinner for them all. Dean had only started to get worried half an hour ago, and he knew Sam and Gabriel could most definitely be on the side of the road somewhere having sex, not that he loved the idea of Sam and Gabe having sex in Baby. Cas was anxious at this point, and he finally spoke, “Dean… they should have returned by now,”
Dean softly chewed on his lip before nodding some Cas was right. He had only gotten his usual 4 hours during the hunt, and then after killing the werewolves they had come straight back to the bunker, then Dean had spent an hour building the pyre and then they had spent the day outside watching her burn. As Dean started to relax, his music lulling him to sleep and the warmth of Cas next to him, he was able to finally fall asleep.
Cas could not help but smile back at Dean, he knew very well of Dean’s obsession with cowboys and they had roleplayed before. “We should be fast Dean,”
Sam did not stop the chuckle that bubbled from his chest and shook his head, “Dude, I could have told you not to go against Cas; he is freakishly good.”
There were suddenly cheers and people clapping around them, Cas tried to look up but before he could Dean quickly captured Cas’ lips, kissing him deeply. Cas closed his eyes and leaned into Dean’s warmth until Dean slowly pulled away and Dean chuckled gently despite the tear rolling down his cheek. Dean then carefully slipped the ring on Cas’ finger before quickly returning into his seat. Everyone else’s excitement from their new engagement started to wind down around them, but Dean and Cas were both still buzzing with their enthusiasm. Dean paid, and then instead of getting in Baby, they decided to walk next to the lake near the restaurant that was barely large enough to be called a lake but also to large to be called a pond. Cas finally broke the excited silence, “You know we do not have to get married for me to be with you until the end of your life, Dean.”
Dean closed his eyes tightly, doing his best to fight the tears that threatened at his eyes and trying desperately to swallow around the lump in his throat, Charlie was gone, and it had been his fault, he should have been closer. Dean had been riding on a high since they had started their relationship, even with their first hunt together having gone a bit sideways, Dean had been letting himself think that maybe for once things could be good. Now, thought he couldn’t stop himself from wondering how long it was until he got Cas killed too.
Dean took a deep breath as he stood at the end of the aisle, nodding to Sam as he made his way to his chair that was behind Jody and the girls. Dean locked eyes with Cas, and he attempted to choke back the tears he waited for them to stand before starting down the aisle. Dean nearly laughed as he sees Claire holding their adopted kitten, but he was more focused on his angel than anything else.
Castiel’s voice had gone from soothing and calm to harder and dangerous, as if he was challenging Dean, and it made something knot in Dean’s chest, but he forced himself not to jump to conclusions. “Okay, Angel,”
Cas gasped loudly as Dean’s hole spasmed around him and he only manages another thrust before he found himself spilling inside of Dean.
Cas held back a chuckle, shaking his head some before helping Dean up, and then sitting him on a chair, Gabriel made appear. Cas carefully stroked a piece of hair from Dean’s face, he was only slightly worried still, but he was ignoring the very concerned looks from the humans around them speaking softly, “I am sorry Dean, I did not expect you to have such a reaction… this ritual has only been performed with humans before to combine souls… It was never performed with an angel before… I should have realized there would be some problems…”
Cas quietly listened to Dean ranting, and he smiled just a little. Dean was OCD, even if Sam didn’t see that. Yes, when it came to eating, he would just shove the food in his mouth but Cas knew that had nothing to do with him being a slob. It was the way Dean had grown up, constantly unsure when he would eat again, constantly giving the little food they had to Sam. Dean had learned growing up that if there was food in front of him, he needed to eat it because he wouldn’t know when he could eat again, and because of his tendency to always make sure Sam was fed, he had not learned that aspect. Dean had become OCD because of his need to keep things organized in his completely unorganized and unstable environments. Cas forced himself to shove those thoughts away because they made him hate John Winchester even more, and he desperately wanted to go to the man’s heaven and lecture him, try to make the man see the hell he had put his oldest son through. Although Cas was unsure what he would be capable of if he had ever come face to face with John Winchester.
Cas came into their bedroom and saw the book Dean was holding, out of curiosity he walked over and looked over Dean’s shoulder to see an gorgeous sketch of Dean’s mother. “That is beautiful Dean, did you draw that?”
“I do not care, Dean, whatever you wish to make is fine,” Cas said softly but he was distracted. Cas knew he didn’t have to come up with a pet name but since Dean had one for him he wanted to have one for Dean. Dean was halfway through cooking breakfast when it came to him and he blurted it out before he could stop it. “Honeybee.”
Cas was still quiet before finally pulling his hand away and the glow faded as he looked at Dean, “I was using my grace to clean the mattress thoroughly,”
Gabe looked at Cas with confusion, "Why were you in Purgatory baby bird?"
Cas moaned into Dean before pulling away, focusing on thrusting his hips and focusing on their connection, it was everything Cas had ever dreamed of.
Dean came in as Sam had said ghoul and made a humming noise, “Good, I get to shoot things in the head. So where at?”
Castiel wakes up to the most intense pain he had ever been in, his wings being the main source of his pain.
Sam nodded, quickly putting his bag down before grabbing Dean’s and digging in it for the first aid kit. Once Sam finally found it he handed it to his brother and then grabbed a washcloth from the bathroom and handed it to Dean.
Cas was indeed using his grace to avoid causing Dean any pain, overall technically he shouldn’t be using his grace for such a small thing, his grace was still failing as Heaven itself was failing but he couldn’t seem to care at the moment.
Dean huffed and rolled his eyes in annoyance before looking at the map again trying to figure out where the hell they were, just then there was a loud crack of thunder. When Dean looked out the window, the light sprinkling was now a full downpour of heavy rain. Dean sighed, he hated the rain, then he looked at Cas a glare still on his face before shaking his head and replying. “You should have said something Cas, I could have pulled over and figured it out then, I have no fucking idea where we are even at right now.”
One by one Dean was cleaning the cuts and burns. The hunter tried to work as fast as he could be he needed to make sure they were clean before he sutured them so they wouldn’t get infected. Cas’ screams of pain were muffled by the rag in his mouth and he tried to move away from the pain but Sam held him in place. Dean’s voice was gentle as he cleaned the cuts, “I know Angel, I know baby I am so sorry… just breath in and out…. Okay”
Cas frowned, "King... why... why do you keep calling me that Dean?"
Cas nodded and slowly pulled Dean up so they were both standing, “We should go to your room.”
Cas was sitting in the library talking to Gabriel, Dean came in just as Cas started to talk, “I understand your feelings for Sam brother, but he was very hurt by your death, and he failed in his attempt to move on. You will just need to give him time, he is doing better now than he first was.”
Cas glanced over Dean’s shoulder at the digital clock, “It is 11:56”
Dean chuckled warmly and smiled down at the toddler version of his brother, “I forgot how addicted Sammy was to McDonald’s when he was little like this,”
Dean looked over the menu quickly before replying, “I will take the surf’ n’ turf, and he will have the lobster mac and cheese,”
Cas chewed his lip, "I... I had hoped since Father brought you back he would have told you..."
The next night though, Castiel finally brought up the one thing he had been avoided for so long now. “Dean there is something I need to talk to you about,”
Cas hummed softly, “It’s alright Dean, I just, I want you know I’m not going anywhere. I promise. Get some rest, I will wake you when Sam and Jack return.”
Cas sniffled before chuckling softly, "Dean might try to kill you but... I know Sam misses you even if he doesn't say it..."
Cas watched and listened to Dean nervously, he remembered having feelings for Meg when he had been driven insane by Sam's hallucinations but they had only really been because he had thought Dean had abandoned him. Cas ran his fingers through his unkempt hair, "Dean... I..."
Cas’ voice sounded more broken than he wanted it to and Dean could tell the angel was lying, it hurt something deep inside Dean to see his angel so broken. Dean knew Cas would protest to being called an angel because he wasn’t, but wings and halo or not, Castiel would forever be his angel. Dean turned the radio off and carefully scooted closer to Cas. Despite his feigning of straightness, the hunter was very much not straight. He was bisexual, pretty much as long as he could really remember but didn’t accept it until he was 16.
Dean got up and kissed Cas deeply, then sat back down and finished his dinner and fries. After that, he ate two pieces of pie, with the ice cream, of course. Once he had finished, Dean was full, and the exhaustion kicked right back in. Cas went with Dean back to his room and slowly massaged his sore muscles, using his grace more than anything really, but it wasn’t long before Dean was out cold.
Dean sighed some before nodding and going with Cas inside, holding his hand tightly. Dean went up to the booth, with Cas just behind him and waited as the girl with black hair was writing something down. When she looked up, she smiled warmly, “Hi, do you have a reservation?”
Cas looked around confused, figuring out that he was in some sort of castle "What is going on?"
“It… they are all gone… Charlie, Bobby, even Donna!” Sam spoke with obvious fear in his voice.
Cas slowly nodded, “Anything you wish Dean,”
Dean sighed, having hoped and maybe even prayed a little, that the former angel would forget that detail, but of course, he hadn’t. “That my angel is a story for another time. Why don’t we figure out where the hell we are so we can get home and I can have access to booze if you want to have that conversation.”
Cas pulled away from Dean some to look up at Gabriel, whimpering gently, “B…brother…”
Dean let Cas headrest in his lap, putting the cold rag on the back of Cas’ neck and gently ran his fingers through Cas’ sweat-soaked hair, “I’ve got you, angel, I’ve got you.”
Dean practically purring and rolled to his side, curling into Cas’ slightly sweat soaked chest. Cas closed his eyes and pulled Dean in closer to him.
Dean didn’t have to ask how Cas knew what he wanted, he had been silently praying to Cas without even meaning to. “Yes… please… I need you.”
Cas chewed his lip and looked at the ground, he instantly knew he had made Dean nervous, but he needed to talk to Dean about this, and it was every bit as dangerous as he had made it sound. “Do you know anything about… angel sexuality?”
Cas shook his head softly, leaning his head against Dean’s some of the tension in his body released, “I feel like everything I have done so far has been wrong… Gabriel seems to hate me and… Sam… I don’t know what to Dean. My first instinct is to make them sleep and not interact with them… but I… I know that is not what you wish to do… I feel lost… but… I am trying to do well and show you I can handle children but…”
Castiel slowly nodded, “Yes, but, the child would have us, and as an angel, I could protect them… even after…”
Gabe smiled down at Cas warmly, trying to be comforting before he touched Cas’ forehead and tried to figure out what was wrong with him. After a minute he sighed heavily and pulled his hand away, “Shit…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas fell forward onto Dean, laying his head on the hunter’s shoulder and panting harshly. Dean wrapped his arm loosely around Cas’ back and found himself clinging to the angel.
Dean smiled more in his sleep, as his dreams were nice and pleasant. Cas closed his eyes, since getting his grace back Cas could barely stop thinking about how Dean had touched his wings and the look on his face. The touch had sent jolts of pleasure through his grace and his body, but the touch had also terrified him. No one had touched his wings since Hell. It had been hard enough for him to find help grooming them before because of their dark color. Balthazar had helped him after Gabriel left Heaven before then Gabriel had always down it. Cas closed his eyes remembering how Gabriel would tell Cas how much he loved Cas wings, how beautiful they were. Not to mention Gabriel had told him that they were his favorite set of wings, despite the hate the other angels had given him.
Cas swallowed around the lump in his own throat, he knew Dean understood that they didn’t need to get married for him to spend the rest of his life with him, but after another slightly tense second he nodded, and his voice was more profound as he fought the tears, “Of course Dean,”
Cas sighed gently before moving closer to Dean and taking his hand, “I understand that Dean, but technically he did not kill you, and he had been trying to prepare Sam for living life without you. Come on we should go get our stuff”
Dean held back the urge to chuckle and smiled warmly, “I already wrote down you size angel, just find something you like and I will make sure it is the right size.”
Dean stopped himself from laughing but again grabbed the angel by his tie and pulled their lips together, his fingers also working to undo the angel's tie and pull it off. Dean pulled away again, smiling gently. “I want you inside of me Cas… I… I have dreamt about us… before and just… I want you inside me. I uh… I have had sex with men before… so I… I know what I am doing,”
Dean looked up to meet Cas’ innocent-looking blue eyes, and at that moment, his frustrations melted away. Dean softly sighed and patted the bed motioning for Cas to sit next to him, “Not your fault angel, I am just really competitive.”
Dean didn’t want to admit how much he sort of liked the idea and brought up the only argument he legitimately had against it, “I get all sneezy around cats Cas, I think I am allergic,”
When Castiel won again, Dean got up and stalked off, to annoyed to say anything to his angel. After Dean had been sitting in his room a few minutes by himself trying to work out his frustrations without taking them out on his angel, Cas gently knocked on the door before stepping in, “I am sorry Dean…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel moved closer to Cas and stopped him, "Shhh baby bird. It's okay, I am alive. Dad brought me back."
Cas carefully moved out of Dean’s embrace, wanting to make coffee and breakfast for Dean. Cas treaded lightly out of the room to make sure Dean stayed asleep. After quietly leaving Dean’s room, he went to make him coffee first. Sam was at the coffee machine making himself a cup of coffee and turned when he heard footsteps, smiling some at Cas, “Morning Cas, so what’d you watch last night?”
Dean returned the kiss in earnest, closing his eyes, even when Castiel had told him how he felt, and said such meaningful things to him, he still didn’t believe them.
Cas sniffled the tears away and nodded tiredly before moving to his stomach again, so he was settled between Dean’s legs and his head in Dean’s lap. “That’s b… better… thank you Honeybee.”
Cas’ eyes were a more dull blue then Dean was used to seeing, his hair slightly matted to his forehead with sweat, he whimpered, “Hurts…”
Cas knew it was meant to be a rhetorical question but he answered anyway, “You have saved the world Dean, more times then some can count. You deserve happiness”
Cas wasn’t full-on dancing to be fair, and he was swaying his hips to the music he was listening to, not that Dean could hear because he had headphones in. Dean smiled at Cas when he had turned to grab something. Cas jumped when he saw Dean, gasping loudly and quickly pulling his headphones out, silently guessing that this must have been how Dean and Sam felt when he would appear behind them. “D… Dean… I thought you were… uh going to do shopping…”
Dean smiled and took them before walking back towards Baby but stopping at the Honey booth. He bought a few different jars of honey, one of them had fresh honeycomb in it, and Dean knew Cas would love it. After the man wrapped up, the honey Dean headed back towards Baby. Dean took a deep breath before pulling his phone out to text Cas to get dressed in his new suit, then carefully put the honey on the floor and the flowers on the seat next to him. Dean’s drive back to the bunker had his nerves on edge, and the ring box was burning a hole in his pocket.
Cas smiled gently and nodded, “Yes Dean of course, why did you stop?”
Dean turned his back quickly and then going to his room. When he got back, Cas was no longer in bed, but the bathroom door was open and he could just see Cas lying on the floor. Panic went through him again and he rushed to Cas’ side, Cas was pressing himself against the cold tile and there was vomit in the toilet. Dean flushed the toilet before getting a rag wet and gently wiped Cas’ mouth and stroked his hair gently, “Hey there Angel… Gabe is coming okay,”
Cas hesitated for a moment before slowly placing his hand on the scar, he hadn’t touched it directly since the day he pulled Dean from Hell.
Dean huffed softly and looked away, before he kissed Cas again and checked his grocery list and shouting out as he walked away, “I will be back later, Angel.”
Gabriel shook his head, “Wrong, you are feeling aroused and protective. Every time Dean makes even a slight noise you look at him to check if he is okay and then you look at me as if I am encroaching on your territory”
Cas opened the book and gently flipped through the pages, he was in complete awe of his human, the drawings were breathtaking, even some of the first ones that weren’t as good. “These are all amazing Dean, really they are breathtaking,”
Cas closed his eyes tightly and covered his face, something told him to play along for now until he could get out. Whatever this was he needed more information so he could find his way out. "N...no I... I am sorry Dean. I... I am fine... I... I had a bad dream."
Dean looked at the flowers some before focusing on the young woman again, “Hi... I… I uh wanted to propose to my boyfriend and I wanted to get him some flowers…”
Cas sighed gently and started to stand feeling slightly restless, and he had spent the entire night in his room wide awake. Typically staying in one room all night was okay with him, but he was also usually watching Dean sleeping and listening to his breathing. Although Cas did have Chaos to entertain him, the small kitten was litter-trained, and still being bottle-fed every three hours because of how little it was. Just as he was about to get up and pace some more, there was a knock on his door. Carefully laying Chaos to the side Castiel stood up and opened his door, Gabriel and Sam stood there quietly. Cas let the pair in before he went back to his bed and picked up Chaos, who was sleeping and protested with a soft whine but quickly settled back against Cas’ chest. Before Gabriel or Sam said anything Cas could feel Dean’s thoughts on him and he reached out with his grace to feel his human waking up, Cas used his grace to make his phone appear in his hand. Gabriel had seen Cas’ grace expand and rolled his eyes, knowing what the angel was doing, “Okay baby birdie, I am going to talk to your Human. Moose here wants to talk to you okay?”
Gabriel’s shoulders fell and he sighed, “Yeah okay”
2 weeks after the stupid heat the witch put Dean in, he needs to get things done and he finally feels good enough to get them done
Cas started to pull away, but Dean was faster and easily hooked his arm around Cas’ waist keeping him in place. After a quiet moment, Cas looked down and his voice was softer and shakier than Dean had ever really heard it, “Do you not find me, attractive Dean?”
Dean suddenly cut Cas worried rambling off with a kiss to his lips, running his fingers gently along the nape of Cas’ neck, and tugging softly on the short hairs there, drawing a gently groan from Cas lips. It was a surprisingly sensitive spot Dean had discovered one night a couple of weeks back when Cas was asleep. Once he had Cas’ attention he pulled away just enough to be able to lock eyes with Cas, “Cas I have more scars than you do, some may not be as bad as your but your scars don’t make you any less attractive. Cas, I think they make you look hot,”
A week later, they brought home, a runt of the litter, black male kitten, with one bright blue eye, and one bright green eye. Since Cas was the one who wanted the kitten in the first place, he let the angel name him. Despite the kittens sweet, very calm demeanor Castiel chose the name Chaos, saying it just seemed right.
Dean noticed Cas’ eyes had glazed over some as the angel was deep in thought, Dean wrapped his hand around the back of Cas’ neck and pulled their lips together, the angel responded in earnest before pulling away, Dean searched Cas’ eyes. “Are you sure you want to…”
Dean chuckled softly and nodded, grabbing the grocery list from the fridge, stepping more into his angel’s space, “I forgot the list for the groceries, so I came back to get it. Having fun, Angel?”
Dean almost instantly felt overwhelmed by the sensation of having Cas touching him, it had never felt this intense before but then again with Cas everything was more intense, it always had been.
Cas nodded desperately, “yes… yes please…”
Dean took Cas hand in his while the man was focused on ringing up the last 2 pairs of jeans, at first Cas was hesitant to let him because he knew Dean’s views on public displays of affection, especially with him, and he could tell that the man in front of them was obviously homophobic, simply by the awful thoughts going through his mind, as he projected them to heaven, obviously unknowing Cas was an angel. When Cas’ saw Dean’s smirking though he relaxed minutely, knowing full well Dean intended to piss off the jerk in front of him.
When the thundering in his ears died down and his vision cleared, Dean realized two things, and the first thing was that at some point he had collapsed to the ground. The second thing was that Cas was talking to him, “It’s okay Dean… I’ve got you now; you are alright now Honeybee, you are safe.”
And indeed Castiel fell, both literally and figuratively for Dean Winchester. Cas had known the moment he gripped Dean Winchester’s soul and raised it from Pe3rdition that something was different about this human.
Cas hesitated before adjusting his hold on Gabriel, so he was cradled more into Cas’ side. The toddler huffed in annoyance and pulled away from Cas, quickly trying to move next to Sam, wanting his attention. Sam brushed Gabriel off at first, and further cuddled into Dean. That is until Gabriel started crying, Sam instantly moved to comfort Gabriel, and then the two cuddled into Dean’s side.
Sam nodded some but paused before Dean started, “Dean… I can do this part if you want me to…”
Cas pressed his lips to Dean’s and continued working on opening Dean’s hole. Dean moaned openly into Cas’ mouth and arched up into the angel starting to feel desperate.
Confusion hit Sam and he was a bit flustered but he could hear the anger and obvious concern in Cas voice so he quickly grabbed the keys to Baby and headed for the garage, “Not that I know of but I don’t think he has ever been stung, Why Cas what’s wrong?”
Just as Sam had opened his mouth to argue more, Gabriel waltzed in smiling gently, “We got a case? Cool.”
Cas knew in an instant with the young version of Gabriel had done, “He used is grace to fly from the table since he is a fledgling he can only fly with his grace exposed.”
Dean moved to kiss Cas lightly, then cupped the angel’s face in his hands, “Hey… come on it’s my birthday. I lived a whole nother year Angel,”
The waiter nodded, and after getting their sides he wrote it all down and took their menus, “Alright I will get that all in for you guys,”
Cas shook his head gently and hugged Dean tighter back, "I am sorry Dean, I... I didn't know. it has only been a few hours for me..."
Sorry this is so late in the day after I got off work this morning I slept all day
They were naked, Cas was supporting most of Dean’s weight without issue, one hand holding Dean by his ass and the other around Dean’s back. Dean’s eyes were closed but Cas didn’t need to see the man’s eyes to know they were full of tears, he could feel the emotion pulsing off him.
Castiel smiled even though there were definitely tears rolling down his cheeks now and he leaned forward to kiss Dean again the contact was exhilarating and like a soothing balm to a burn deep inside him. The hunter chuckled into the kiss and kissing Cas deeper pulling the angel closer to him by holding the edges of the stupid trench coat the angel held so dear. After a minute or maybe longer Dean carefully nudged Cas away from him and gave him a look, “So want to tell me the truth?”
Dean gasped out with his last breath “I love you, Angel,” Dean’s eyes fell closed, and Cas could feel his heart-stopping. That finally broke the dam and Cas sobbed hard into his husband’s shoulder, clinging tightly and desperately to Dean’s body. Cas could feel Dean’s soul drifting out of his body and attaching itself to his grace, near where his heart was, and it made Castiel sob even harder.
Dean wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and whispered, “Night’s not over yet Angel,”
Cas hesitated but he was frustrated, technically he could do this with his grace, and he had been getting ready to do it when Dean sat down. “Only if you promise not to peak at your present…”
Cas looked down at Dean and smiled, “Dean I love it”
Sam looks at the sigil, he recognizes it to and he goes to one of the bookshelves to grab a book before putting it on the table, then flipping to a page that showed the sigil, that says Horn of Gabriel and that's when Dean remembers as Sam explains it, "Yeah, remember wasn't Uriel using it. It calls angels to it... it reminds them of Heaven or something."
Cas looked over at Sam and smiled, “Hello Sam, have you found a case?”
The woman smiled brighter, “That is wonderful, are you seeing anything you like?”
Dean nodded and then cuddled more into Cas’ side closing his eyes tightly. He was mentally and physically exhausted, the smell of Charlie’s blood and burning flesh clinging to his nose and making his stomach turn, he dug his face further into Cas’ shoulder trying to just focus on Cas’ smell. Dean wished desperately he could bring her back, Charlie hadn’t deserved to die, especially not the brutal way she had, it wasn’t fair. Dean closed his eyes tighter clinging desperately to Cas, and he didn’t realize how tightly he was clinging to Cas until Cas’ fingers were gently raking against his scalp to calm him and his voice was a little strangled “Honeybee, hey it’s okay…”
Cas looked at Dean curiously but stayed quite still. Dean went through the drive-thru and got them dinner, Cas had lost his appetite at the prospect of needing to deal with the toddlers and so when Dean asked him what he wanted to eat he just shook his head. After getting their food, they were soon back at the motel with Sam and Gabriel were happily and very messily munching on their dinners. Cas watched the two toddlers eating and couldn’t help but feel confused and slightly concerned as to how he was going to be able to care for the two toddlers over the next week. Cas had learned that humans were messy, and he had mostly accepted it, but human children, ten times dirtier Cas thought silently.
Dean smiled some and chuckled softly, “Well lucky for you, and I single-handedly raised Sammy here by myself, basically anyways, so I think we will be alright Angel,”
So this was a little cliche but I hope you guys enjoy it anyway! Thank you all for reading it means the world to see all the comments
Sam closed his eyes tightly and then took a long deep breath, “Okay…”
Now Cas was fast asleep, he was doing much better, his wings were tucked against his back comfortably, and Cas was breathing faster than usual but he was also much more relaxed.
Dean turned around planning to find his angel, and his angel was standing in the doorway, his hair wet and just a towel around his waist, Dean raised his eyebrow curiously, “You never shower anymore?”
Cas sighed gently but nodded and gently handed Dean his present, and the paper. “Thank you, Honeybee,”
So if you asked Dean Winchester what being in love felt like now, he would tell you that being in love, was more complicated, but also more amazing then you could ever really imagine.
Cas laughed softly, pulling Dean close and kissing him then gently whispering, “It is okay to enjoy other music Dean,”
If he wanted to, Cas could have let himself cry, but he refused to cry yet. Cas just smiled warmly at Sam, “Thank you, Sam, it is my honor to be a part of your wonderful family.”
Dean smirked gently, his eyes wrinkling at the corners even more, “Mmmm I know. Come on, Angel.”
Dean stretched out his tired and sore limbs out before he started at the oven first. While Dean had turned the oven off, he hadn’t taken the things inside out, so the food was burnt to the bottom of the pain. Dean put that stuff in the sink to soak first, then started putting things that weren’t spoiled back. Then a pair of strong arms wrapped around his waist, making Dean jump violently and nearly turn to attack whatever was holding him, but then he recognized Cas’ familiar waterfall scent and quickly stopping himself but pulling away and turning to face his angel. Dean held his chest as he tried to slow his racing heart down and yelled a little too loud, “Damn it Cas! You know better than to do that to me!”
Dean had been sitting next to him and he gently laid his hand on Cas’ neck and stroked through the small hairs on the back of Cas’ neck, “Shhh easy Angel, Gabe said your wings are molting,”
So angst? I love writing angst, honestly, I do, it might make me a terrible person but whatevs. Anyways, hope you all enjoy this one. Cas is wounded on a hunt only a week after they finally admit their feelings for each other
Just Sam was about to call for Dean, Cas came in stretching his arms out and rolling his shoulders gently. Sam smiled, “Hey Cas,”
Dean shook his head before turning on his side and grabbing the lube out of his drawer and then forced himself to take a deep breath, he would show Cas instead. Dean gently nudged Cas away from him, “Just… watch and… and then do what I do.”
(PS:This is a short one sorry guys)
Dean’s eyes opened and at first, he just noticed their nakedness but when he saw a small flutter behind Cas his eyes caught Cas’ wings and his eyes widened, and he met Cas eyes, “Really Angel?”
Dean heard Sam sputter and huffed in annoyance but he could hear Gabriel pulling Gabriel out of the room slamming the door. Cas sighed gently and ran his hand over his face, “Dean…”
She smiled and then gathered a few, also putting in some other small greenery, so the bundle looked a little fuller, but she still thought it was small and softly asked, “Awesome, do you want to do just these or maybe something else too?”
They had both wanted this for years, despite neither of them acknowledging it to the other and now they were finally here. Dean slowly met Cas’ eyes and nodded, “I’m okay Cas,”
The doctor nodded gently, “You had a severe allergic reaction to the stings, your throat was completely closed when we first got you. We gave you some epinephrine and some heavy antihistamines…. We are going to give you a prescription epi-pen so we can avoid your reaction being this bad again,”
Dean gave the woman his main cell number and then paid for both rings, deciding to pick up his ring when he picked up Cas’ so he didn’t have it burning a hole in the underwear drawer. Barely a minute after Dean walked out of the store, Cas called and he went to find him. They finished all their shopping relatively quickly and without any more incidents. Dean stopped for food on their way home, taking a long way home. His whole body buzzing with excitement for the ring to be ready. He knew it would be a long 3 weeks, but in the meantime, he could plan out how he was going to ask his angel to be his husband.
Dean nodded, “Yes I like those,”
Dean hummed softly and then nodded, “That sounds nice Cas…”
Dean felt his heart constrict some, “Sam, what’s going on?”
your dreams may keep.
Dean closed his eyes and leaned into Cas once more, then the realization that they hadn’t eaten crossed through his mind and he groaned deeply, “Shit, we didn’t stop for food… I don’t want to cook…”
Dean’s eyes widened as he stared between the food and Cas, he couldn’t stop the smile that crossed his face, “Cas…”
Dean shrugged some, “You can if you want to but I have kind of been needing to do a good deep-cleaned of the kitchen and whatnot. I just haven’t really had the chance, well I guess the motivation to actually do it,”
Cas had an instant and reliable response, “I can cure that Dean, it is straightforward,”
Cas opened his eyes and gazed into Dean’s incredible green eyes, for a moment just studying his human. After a minute too long in Dean’s opinion, Cas nodded, “If that is what you wish for us to do Dean, I told you when you asked me, all that matters to me is that we are together.”
Cas watched Dean, who was obviously in a lot of pain and he felt bad for his human. A human body was not used to experiencing an angel’s heat and Cas was not sure how it would affect him. Cas gently used his grace to make their clothes disappear, remembering enough about an angel in heat to know what Dean needed right now. Dean relaxed minutely at the feeling of cold air against his hot skin.
Dean blushed deeply before looking away, “Thank you Cas, you… you can keep it if you want. Hell, you can keep the whole book… I don’t…”
I apologize now guys,  this one hurts a bit. Also this is a canon death but not the actual way said character died so
Dean studied Cas for a moment before asking, “Do you want me to check Angel?” Cas eyes widened, it would be better to have someone else groom his wings, and he had already let Dean touch his wings before so it wouldn’t be that intimidating, but the intimacy of grooming his wings when they were already in a relationship would be overwhelming. Dean could see the hesitancy in Cas’ eyes and gently spoke, “Hey… if you don’t want me to, I don’t have to Angel"
Dean panted harshly, his chest rising and falling and he met Cas’ stunningly blue eyes, “I am okay, just, go slow.”
Castiel welcomed the darkness that surrounded him, it was his time, and he knew Dean would survive, even with the likes of Chuck who was causing terror at every turn. That was who the Winchester’s had become, they were survivors.
Cas hummed gently for a moment before he sat next to Dean as he opened the pizza box and handed it to Dean. They flicked through the options, and after some discussion, they decided to watch Law and Order.
Cas nodded some then watched Dean as he ran his fingers gently, barely a feather’s touch along the longest scar that went diagonal across his chest. It was from the dragon, they had removed the stitches 2 weeks ago and the scar was still raised and red and very sensitive. Cas shivered gently at the feeling and his stomach fluttered gently. Dean lowered himself further so he was looking at Cas’ chest now, Dean gently leaned forward and softly licked and kissed along Cas scar. When Dean looked up Cas was doing his best not to move and groaning gently a bit overwhelmed at the new attention to his over-sensitive scar. Dean smiled and his hand trailed down Cas’ happy trail teasingly slow before he gently unbuttoned Cas’ jeans that weren’t his jeans. Cas watched Dean with needy anticipation rising in his chest. Dean slid Cas pants down part of the way along with his underwear before gently rubbing along Cas’ half-hard cock that was quickly becoming fully hard with the attention. Dean was kissing and nipping, and licking at Cas’ scars as well as rubbing his cock. It didn’t take long before the angel was starting to writhe in pleasure and Dean knew his angel was getting close. Dean being the tease he was slowed down and then stopped as he pulled Cas’ pants off.
What it is like to be in love, explained by two people who are completely and uttrly in love with each other.
Dean made a soft whining noise at being flown back to the bunker, the flight had always made his stomach queasy but it seemed worse this time. Dean clung to Cas’ hand desperately and curled towards Cas needily, “Cas… please…”
Cas chewed on his lip, before softly asking and maybe using a bit of the puppy dog eyes that rivaled Sam’s, “I would like it if we could maybe get a kitten Honeybee,”
Cas tried to stop him but it didn't work. Dean opened the door and then all of a sudden he dissipated like a mist and there was a voice behind him that he had not heard in years, "Hey baby birdie."
Dean smiled some before stroking Cas hair and shoulder gently carefully avoiding his wings. The next two days were spent similarly, a cold bedsheet on Cas’ wings was the easiest thing to soothe Cas’ pain. Dean was doing everything he could to help Cas, trying to make sure that Cas was in as little pain as possible. By the time all the feathers grew back they were still pure black, but they were no longer burned or ashen looking. They had more iridescence to them now, and Dean wondered if that was what they had looked like before Cas had rescued him from Hell.
Gabriel scoffed, "As if a little thing like dying would stop me, come on. Nah Daddio rebuilt me."
I honestly am not a fan of this chapter but I hope you guys enjoy it anyways
Cas blushed deeply and looked at the slightly damp towel in his hands, “I uh…”
Castiel was confused but followed the order, stood in front of him was the Empty, still using Meg as an image to present as, the blonde hair was different than when Castiel had known her but it would have fit Meg well. It was almost hard to distinguish The Empty from Meg’s image, the only distinctive difference being the blonde curls. Castiel wasn’t sure what to say, all coherent thought was in a tangled mess in his mind. Castiel had expected to sleep endlessly, like the Empty so desired, and in truth, he had welcomed it.
This chapter finally has some smut, so I hope y'all enjoy it
Dean sighed heavily and ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, then gently kissed Cas, “It’s fine Angel, and I didn’t hear you so you sort of scared the shit out of me,”
Sam smiled some and then followed them to the room they had now put Dean in. Cas went to Dean’s side and took his hand clinging to it desperately, “Oh Dean…”
Castiel loved Dean, but his feelings for Dean Winchester were so much more than the word Love could really fully explain. Love was such a simple word, but the way Castiel felt for his human, it was so much further from simple. The English language just did not have the right words to really encompass how Castiel felt for Dean. There was a word in Enochian that explained how he felt, but of course, the English language just didn’t have the right word so the translation was completely impossible.
Sam groaned and rolled his eyes, “Try to keep it down, dude.”
On the inside Cas wanted to scream, he tried to argue, he wanted to go to his father and demand that Dean live, even though he had known this was going to happen eventually it didn’t make things any easier. Cas pulled on his grace and snapped his fingers to light the fire, before watching the fire consume his husband’s body and collapsing to the ground as all the emotions broke over him again.
Dean chuckled again and smiled, “It was cute Cas, a little subdued, I think. What are you even listening too.”
Dean pulled Cas in for a long, passionate kiss before pulling away and going to his room with the duffel bag. Dean put his things away, then went to the bathroom and took a quick but nicely warm shower and getting dressed. When he ventured out towards the library, he could smell the burgers and his mouth watered, he could also smell something sweet but wasn’t sure what it was. When he got into the Library, the lights were now turned down lower, and candles were sitting on the table. Cas was slightly leaning against one of the chairs in jeans and one of Dean’s t-shirts that Cas had taken because the texture of the fabric was soothing.
Dean chuckled gently but adjusted his cowboy hate and smirked, “Come on baby lets play,”
Dean stared at Cas’ wings, there were huge chunks of feathers missing, and just making Cas’ wings appear it had made him lose more feathers. “Is there anything I can do?”
Dean reached up and tried to pull Cas against him, but Cas growled lowly and stopped him and his voice dropped an octave, “I am in charge. You will get what you want but I am in charge of this, is that understood Dean?” The authority and power in Cas’ voice made the side of him that hated being dominated bristle, but the largest part of him loved it and he preened with desire. When Dean failed to give an understandable answer, Cas growled more and pinned Dean’s hands over his head, “I said, Is that understood Dean!”
The young girl smiled back and nodded excitedly, “Absolutely! I am so happy to hear someone willing to be open about their sexuality, and it’s so rare around here.”
Sam was running to the garage then and replied trying to stay calm, “Okay Cas… um… fuck make sure to get his feet up, his clothes need to be loose enough for him to breath”
Suddenly Dean remembers what had happened, “A bird was messing with a damn wasp’ nest, I remembered feeling one pinch and then the next minute I was full-on swarmed…”
Sam shook his head some, “I just figured you would have told me, Jerk.”
The woman moved over to the register, putting the order in and when she was done she nodded, “Okay so that will take 3 and a half weeks, We can call you when we get it in?”
So this is a super short one, mostly to make up for the fact that the next one is going to be pretty long. I hope you guys enjoy though!
Cas gave a slight nod and watched Sam go before turning as Dean came in, he checked over his hunter more thoroughly, Dean had a cut on his cheek, and the man was favoring his left leg, with his grace he could see a deep cut on Dean’s leg, and there was a small fracture. Dean carefully put his duffel bag and the bag of guns on the table before he moved to wrap his arms around Cas.
Castiel felt relief bloom in his chest, even though he was nervous to think about how Dean would react to him after Castiel had told the man the truth, he needed to be there for Dean. “I understand, thank you…”
Cas looked up and blushed some before nodding, “I like the color of these jeans better than than the lighter ones you gave me.”
Dean shook his head, he hated how much the former angel doubted himself and gently made Cas look at him, “I love it, angel.”
The woman paused for a moment before an idea popped into her head and she went to another basket, grabbing some white flowers, and some more green foliage and made a rather elegant looking bouquet. As she came back to her small counter so Dean could pay, she explained, “These white flowers are called Dittanies, they symbolize love, passion and some people believe they are an aphrodisiac.”
Despite having barely been paying attention Dean was aware that Sam was no longer there, and after a minute he finally couldn’t take it anymore and he started to break down, Dean’s knees gave out and he started to collapse but Cas’ arms caught him and gently eased Dean to the ground following with him. Cas hugged Dean tightly and let Dean sob into his shoulder. Dean hadn’t had much chance to break down after her death besides his episode of pure rage taken out on the werewolf that had killed Charlie. After killing the rest of the pack, they had wrapped Charlie’s body up and put her in Baby and drove straight back home. Dean had wanted to get her back to the bunker for Hunter’s funeral she deserved. Dean had chopped the wood for the pyre and taken his anger out on the trees.
Dean was supposed to be out Christmas shopping, and grocery shopping, but he accidentally forgot his grocery list and needed to come home. Cas was cleaning the kitchen as Dean had asked, and listening to music and dancing when Dean comes home.
Cas smiled a little, resting his forehead against Dean’s and he was about to say something when Chaos jumped up onto the table, the cat was full-grown now, his tail swayed gently as he rubbed against Dean’s shoulder and purred. Gabriel had used his grace to make the cat immortal because it was effortless to do with pets but very hard to do on humans. Mostly because human souls were not exactly meant for immortality. Chaos continued to rub against Dean’s shoulder and arm begging for attention, Dean quickly gave the cat the attention it wanted. “Well good morning Chaos, where have you been?”
Castiel needed to focus on something else and their joined hands seemed to be where his eyes wanted to fall as he chewed his lip, after a quiet moment he replied, “I thought maybe… I wasn’t sure if you remembered. Or… or if you still... I messed up so much Dean…”
Sam yelled from the next room having heard his brother, “DUDE! You are so gross. Haven’t you had enough!”
Cas looked out the window and he could recognize he was in Rome, but something about what he was seeing was off, some of it seemed blurry that should have been clear. Cas couldn't figure out what was wrong though, he just knew something wasn't right. Castiel knew he shouldn't be here, he knew he was an angel. When he tried to use his grace he was being bound by something, and when he tried to call his wings they refused to appear and panic coiled desperately in his chest, "No no no no..."
A few times when Dean and Cas hug. Very fluffy
Dean carefully moved Cas’ hair back from his eyes gently, “Okay sweetie… Should I get Gabriel?”
Cas smiled proudly, also ignoring the slight hardening in his pants because no human being should ever sound that divine while only eating a burger, “Yes, there is also a pecan pie in the oven.”
Dean pulled away and searched Castiel’s eyes, their mouths still only centimeters apart as they both puffed gently to catch their breath. “I love you…”
Cas sniffled gently and nodded before whimpering out, “S…something c…cold on my wings… please…”
After almost half an hour of lazy thrusts, tender kisses, and nothing short of what felt like worship, it was no longer enough for both of them and Dean begged him for more. Cas slowly pulled almost all the way out before slamming back in, and not giving Dean time to process before he was doing it again, this time speeding up between each thrust. Cas used his wings to help him keep his balance and this was turning Dean on even more and pushing him even closer to his orgasm.
Dean sighed gently, he knew how Sam had felt for the archangel after a drunken night ending with Sam sobbing to sleep over Gabriel’s death. “Because Sam, I don’t trust the guy enough to leave him here by himself, so we take him with or one of us stays back with him.”
“We’ll tell him you're desperate to see him. Don’t worry, idjit, we know. Hell, everyone goddamn knows.”
“I am uncertain. There are many factors to consider but your brother seems strong.” Cas frowned slightly and glanced curiously at Dean, “You say a witch did this?”
“Come on, little brother,” Dean murmured, his voice strained as he lifted him on the backseat of his car. He tried not to stare at the terrifying thin black lines creeping up Sam’s arm, reminding Dean of rain down a window pane. Dean guessed he wouldn’t like what happened when those dark streams reached his brother’s heart.
Unfortunately for Dean, it hadn’t quite been that simple.
“They must want something from us,” the margay daemon hissed.
The only effect this session would have would be to slow or even stop the rate of infection. Stopping it wasn’t going to be biggest problem - it was removing the damaging magic of the curse from his arm and then, most difficult of all, the source of dark magic in his palm.
The doubt that had filled Dean dissipated. He felt the blush crawl up his neck and bloom burning red all over his face. “Cas, you can’t say soppy shit like that.”
Cas’ daemon was slumped in the chair. She seemed comfortable enough but if he was going to move Cas, she had to come with them. Indira sighed heavily and then prowled over to the other daemon who was thankfully smaller than her and grabbed her between her teeth and began pulling the cat lightly by her neck.
His mother was a sore spot. Somehow, like fate was fucking with him, he’d ended up in the same house as a member of the very same family who’s caused Mary Winchester’s death. Being in the same space as a Milton was forcing his feelings to rear their ugly heads and Dean Winchester did not deal well with them.
Ellen raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
Cas scowled, “Just because I’m not human, doesn’t mean that I don’t have an understanding of why you hunt. What I disagree with is when prejudice hunters murder my kind or someone who does not deserve it,” he bit out savagely.
The warlock visually relaxed and he looked truly exhausted, “I believe you will be fine,”
“You listen here, boy,” Bobby interrupted, sensing Dean was about to protest, “Good people are on it. You do not need to get involved with this,”
The man gave him a glance up and down and grumbled out, “You’re a witch,”
Dean nodded but it was more in consideration of but Cas said than an actually admittance that he thought Cas was right.
“You had no right,” Dean said, his throat raw, and began to close the distance between them. “You left me.” It was far more complicated than that, he knew, and yet he couldn’t help but simplify it to the words that had echoed in his head since It had happened.
Dean finally gaged his eyes open and he gave Cas an unhappy smile, “You left a damn picture in the guest room.”
Castiel hid the shock at such a blunt question, though he knew he shouldn’t have expected anything less. His heart thumped heavily against his chest and he gave the most honest answer he could, “Only in self-defence.”
Nothing.
A spark of energy flickered in the warlock’s eyes. It wasn’t the first time Cas had been threatened within his own home and the last time it happened, it had ended with a hunter immobile (but still breathing – if barely) on the porch. In fact, the only reason he hadn’t thrown the rudely behaved man out of his house was because that he was clearly terrified for his sibling, “I don’t appreciated being threatened by the person I’m trying to help,” his voice rumbled out calmly but with a hit of a warning that the hunter couldn’t fail to miss. Cas wouldn’t continue to tolerate it. There was a limit to his patience.
As Cas returned to the kitchen, he felt a powerful jolt run through him. The jar he was carrying slipped through his hand and smashed on the tiled floor. Castiel flinched away from the mess. Pieces of glass and petal lay before him but he couldn’t even comprehend the damage – too distracted by the force. Someone had just tripped his wards. Actually it was more like they stumbled into them so violently that Cas could still feel a sort of aftershock. A ricochet from the contact. Sofia’s head whipped round to his and she made a deep rumbling sound.
The warlock probably had the better deal.
Sofia prowled across the table top, pacing back and forth until Castiel gave her a stern glare. Briefly she stopped, tilting her head and then, deliberately slow, continued to cover the surface of the table and brushed her tail across the screen of Castiel’s laptop every time she went past.
“If you try anything, I swear to god-”
It took only a moment to find what he was looking for; a jar of rare purple flowers that in the world of magic were associated with healing. Making mild healing substances, amongst others things, were how Cas made a living. This was his last jar and as far as Cas could tell, no one was selling. His usual supplier had told him that they wouldn’t be available for another few weeks.
Once Cas had pulled himself together to finally react, he skidded to the hunters side. His heart lurched. Theoretically, there was no way that Dean should be still breathing after all that magic had slammed into him, but it didn’t stop him asking, “Dean?”
“And you killed her?”
He swept the pile into the corner to reduce the chance of an accident. It was lucky that he had some stock that would help both Dean already and he didn’t have to make it from scratch because he didn’t think he’d be able to do that right now. His brother was a different story. There was a jar of a healing salve he’d created for nasty burns which should help Dean. The recipe was based on one his family used for their business but with a few important differences. There were no surprising and ultimately nasty or profit worthy side effects, just to name a few.
Dean cut him off, “See it?! Are you blind? It’s the colour of a fucking tomato! You can see it perfectly well from there!” He didn’t want that asshole any closer to him. If he couldn’t control his magic then he shouldn’t be anywhere near him. And neither should Sam. Bobby had been wrong about this guy.
“Trying to help your brother,” Cas deadpanned. If the hunter was going to let him, that was. And from the corner of his eyes he could see Sofia’s position; she looked ready to attack if necessary. “Do you want me to save him or not? I would estimate that he has but a few hours left.”
Cas could feel the hunter watching him like a hawk; he was stood on the opposite side of the bed seeming as if he might pounce if Cas so much as looked at his brother wrong. He decided to break the silence, “What do I call you?” he let the unconscious man’s hand fall to the mattress.
Castiel didn’t say anything. If he were honest with himself, he wasn’t sure why he was going to such lengths to help a stranger – a hunter no less. His relationship with Bobby Singer was little more than acquaintance and yet here he was doing him a difficult and trying favour. His mother always said he was too soft and Cas could see that maybe she was right. But he’d take soft over his mother’s more cruel and manipulative nature any day.
There was a beat of silence where both men glowered at each other but neither of their daemons had begun to hiss or snarl as they had done previously. In fact Sofia appeared the most relaxed, lazing on the table as if an intense exchange of words was not happening around her. And Dean’s daemon did little more than watch from the chair next to the hunter, still, but only slightly, cautious. The warlock knew very little about Dean but he knew his own daemon and he knew himself. He didn’t feel offended by Dean’s words and Sofia knew it because he’ll admit, though maybe not to the hunter, that Dean made perfect sense. If he were in his situation, Cas wouldn’t trust him either. Actually, if Dean knew him at all, Castiel estimated that the hunter would want to be as far away from him as possible.
Cas sighed offhandedly, “Would you please hold him for me?”
As Bobby had recommended him, he was allowing himself to let the warlock do his work but he obviously wasn’t about to start trusting him. The warlock was a means to an end to help his little brother. He didn’t even know how well Bobby knew the guy. Bobby was a hunter, so why he even knew a warlock was a mystery.
Dean shoved a couple of the upstairs doors open until his found a bedroom and took the passed out man in his arms to the bed and dropped him on to it – or tried to because then Cas returned partly to the world.
It was clear that he didn’t want to say it but Cas was mildly impressed that he actually had. Combined with just how sad the man looked, Cas just couldn’t help himself. He wasn’t totally heartless.
Dean stared at him, incredulous, as if he were trying to tell whether or not he was being serious, “You missed the point.”
Dean cleared his throat awkwardly, “You look awful, man. Maybe you should get some rest.”
“Don’t. Just don’t.” Dean was not going to cry. He wasn’t.
Since there had been a fairly long pause; each party weighing one another up and the hunter waiting for Cas’ response, the man eventually seemed to lose his aggressive posture and his shoulders caved in as he sighed and stared towards the floor. He ran a hand through his short hair.
Milton Medical had hurt Dean and whilst Cas didn’t know how, or to what extent and Cas himself certainly hadn’t had anything to do with it, helping his brother was the least he could do. It might even prove to Dean that he was on the opposite side of the spectrum to most of the rest of his family.
