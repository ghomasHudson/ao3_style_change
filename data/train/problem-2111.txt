“What time is it?” a low mutter came from the bed.
He had almost lost Sherlock – had almost forgone any chance of telling the younger man his true worth and what he meant. Even if Sherlock was unaware, he had saved John in a way beyond anyone else could have. He had given him purpose – had stayed with him despite his own faults of depression and anxiety. The very things he had hidden from the world since his discharge from the Military.
“I believe you just found a key, then” he responded, trailing his eyes to Mycroft.
His head was dropped and he heard the tapping as the man began another text message, along with the sound of a zipper as the man tucked himself back into his designer jeans.
“Sherlock, get out,” twenty-three-year-old Mycroft slurred, catching himself on the footboard of the bed.
His reaction garnered the same look as a response. “When Sanders and I arrested Dreln Hargett, there was a man in a suit. Seemed a bit more…official than the lot of us.”
As the third cut drew, he could no longer hold back and began shouting as he tried to pull the man’s arm away.
John jerked his head towards Sherlock, whose eyes were fluttering beneath his lids. Keeping his tone and manner as calm as possible, John set his hand on his Sherlock’s with a light grasp.
John gave him a quizzical look. “Man in the suit?”
With that, he left their presence, walking towards the black vehicle awaiting his return.
He was uncertain how long he spent trying to get his best mate’s heart to start, how many times he attempted to breathe life back into him; however, the next thing he knew, he felt a grip around his shoulders and he was being pulled away towards the door. His limbs flailed as he tried to get away, his attention focused on Sherlock, who was now being flanked by two men dressed in blue and white. Even as one of the men began applying the pads of an AED to Sherlock’s chest while the other continued chest compressions, he kept fighting against the person holding him, their words inaudible to his constant calling and begging to the man he cared for above all others.
“Sherlock—”
“Could always go downstairs and do was Cleary did.” There was the sound of retching as a response.
It took a moment, but Sherlock began to relax when John gave his hand a light squeeze. “I suppose that would be proper,” Sherlock said as his eyes darted away.
He moved the man’s body around the side of the building, positioning him in a way he could have been mistaken as sleeping. Once set, he searched the pockets and waistband, finding a walkie-talkie and a pocket knife – the apparent weapon they had been reaching for. He took both, along with the man’s hooded sweater, and returned to the outside of the main entrance where he found the door propped open by a small piece of wood. He entered quietly as he put the sweater over his light jacket, uncertain as to who would be on the other end, making sure to keep the wood block in place, understanding the door would lock when fully shut; and with Mycroft, and he was certain Lestrade by that point, en route, leaving the entrance unhindered was within their best interests.
As the medical personnel approached him, he tried to push them away, saying he was fine. “Sherlock.” He clamped his eyes shut, recalling the memory of seeing his friend’s failing state. “Where is he? Greg, Sherlock was with me. He was drugged – where is he?”
Suddenly, a loud noise emanated from the direction of the head, cutting through the silence and pulling Sherlock back to reality.
Finding himself waiting for the laughter signalling the witticism, Sherlock unconsciously tensed when it failed to ring throughout the basement. There was the sound of footsteps right before the mattress shifted.
Also, I had two scenarios in my head on how to do this chapter.
They waved the weapon before putting it back behind them. “Yeah, whatever.” Their annoyance was clear. Whether it was because of the request or because of the unfamiliarity, he was unsure. Either way, it granted the passage he wanted.
Body betraying him, Sherlock dropped forward and his arms were twisted up, followed by the sound of a crack as his right shoulder came out of its socket. His vocals were next to follow suit and he began releasing a mixture of shouts and groans. The pressure that had been mounting in his lower abdomen had turned into a sharp pain with each motion. He tried to tune it out, tried to return the place within his mind, but was void when Dreln started twisting his hand inside him, forcing hand and wrist further.
“It’s annoying.”
Serial killers who planned out their dump sites would not travel too far from their hunting grounds – the places they felt comfortable with. Even a group as dangerous as Cielo Diablos would not be willing to travel outside of their comfort zones – places they believed the police and investigators would not look.
“Get a copy of this – we need the identity of those men,” Lestrade said to Donovan as he stood up, opening the number pad on his phone. Bringing the phone to his ear after punching in the digits, his voice broke through the receiver. “How many of those structures are near the river?” A pause as he left the room, leaving his sergeant to send the footage. “I know you sent the locations, but time is of the essence, so update it!” He barely acknowledged the manager of the pub as he passed the bar, leaving the pub to the sidewalk. “Then you have my apology, now just do it.” He hung up in obvious frustration.
A few minutes passed by before John decided to enter the room. Drawing Mycroft’s immediate attention, the official stood straight, his hands moving to clasp the handle of his umbrella, which had been leaning against the bed. Though he tried to hide it, his face was a slight hint of pink, proving to John that Sherlock’s sibling was capable of human emotion. The thought caused him to chuckle internally, imagining what Sherlock would have said had he have been awake. It would be something he would have to tell him the moment he had the chance.
“Who the hell are you?” the man demanded, finger tracing the trigger of his weapon.
“No, I’m honest with you. If you can’t trust your best mate, then I don’t know what else to tell you,” he said with an air of nonchalance. When Sherlock failed to respond, John shrugged. “I’ll leave you to dress. I’m going to enjoy breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. You’re more than welcome to join me when you’ve finished.”
A cold metal met his forefoot, along with the honeycomb pattern of a grate, as he stepped up. After a few curved steps, light emanated from somewhere near the top, reflecting off a grey wall. He stopped, listening for a hint of life. Hearing nothing, he lifted his foot to the next step.
“It’s done. You can leave, now.” The look she gave met with her tone had everyone in the area scatter. In any other situation, John would have found her assertive and pompous tone grating; yet, at the moment, he could not have welcomed it more. After they left, leaving the two alone with nothing more than the steady beeping, Donovan released an audible sigh, shaking her head while John watched her. “Bloody parasites,” she muttered, taking a quick glance to the incapacitated man on the bed.
“John,” her voice finally pieced through the veil of haze. “Yeah, a minor one by the looks of it,” she responded to a question the doctor did not hear. His vision began coming into focus, the features of the detective filling his view. “Can you stand?” she asked, to which he groaned as he rolled to the side, nodding. She helped him to his feet, holding his arm as he stumbled.
The man nodded, seemingly satisfied.
One of the officers holding Dreln jerked him forward towards the door Mycroft had come through and the two officials left with the man, whose silence and concerned expression brought a sadistic amusement to the Holmes brother. Down the hall, Lestrade passed the trio before entering the room through the same door, approaching Mycroft. Mycroft interjected before the detective-inspector was able to get a word out. “Where’s Sherlock?” he asked, trying to maintain his proper attitude, despite anger on the edge of his voice.
At the statement, John’s own brow furrowed.
There was the sound of shifting, followed up with, “Well, you got his mouth or his ass.”
For a moment, Sherlock shut his eyes and allowed himself to sink into the mattress. “Why are you still here?” he asked without opening his eyes. As though expecting the curious look John was giving him, he followed up with, “You’ve been here for two days. I may be stuck here, but there’s no reason you should still be here.”
“No,” was the immediate response. “I think that highly of him.”
The streets were fairly vacant and the streetlights already lit, casting shadows every which way. A couple was walking on the opposite side of the street, both obviously intoxicated, whereas they were both laughing obnoxiously as the two men could overhear them discussing past matters. The woman was latched onto her partner’s arm, doubling over and stumbling several times before they turned the corner. Even as the distance increased, they could still hear the couple’s laughter. There was a man talking hastily on his cell phone, walking towards the duo, paying them no attention as he was heard shouting at the person on the other end, who Sherlock concluded was his wife, judging by the tone and subject. He failed to notice the six-foot detective, bumping into him and offering no apology, instead flowing into a slew of curses to the woman over the phone.
John grabbed Mycroft’s arm quickly and licked the two puncture wounds closed. Seeing the blood disappear made Sherlock buck against his restraints in an attempt to strike again, but the ghost twine held fast. “Shh,” John whispered in his ear, the warmth breath sending a shiver down his spine.
“Ah, ah!” the boy groaned again at the pleasure his Sherlock was giving him, eager for what was to come. The detective agreed, preparing to add a second finger. “Ah, wait Sherlock don’t!” He shoved both fingers inside, rutting roughly a few times against the boy’s arse again, enjoying how the tight muscle surrounding his knuckles twitched around him. His boy was panting and moaning now and Sherlock could tell he was no longer relaxed. “Please take them out, it hurts,” John cried out, but the man knew what was best for the teenager, even if he didn’t.
Dropping the body to the floor, even as blood continued to pump out of the nurse’s neck, Sherlock rose slowly. He could smell his brother, the sweet blood that flowed like melted chocolate through his veins. Sherlock licked his lips and then dove for the human. His fingers just grazed Mycroft’s lapels before two large hands hit his shoulders.
“They won’t, no one has ever loved me like Sherlock,” John knew this to be true. In his whole life he had never even seen somebody with the intensity Sherlock could focus on people.
“Study me?” John asked, his eyes going wide. “That’s ridiculous, Sherlock, if that’s even your real name.”
“Hey Molly.” John kneeled down and ignored the two men who left them to walk to the kitchen. “How’va been kiddo,” John smiled at her and brushed a piece of hair behind her ear. Molly looked happy and healthy, which was all John could ask for.
“Sherlock,” John said, propping himself up on one elbow, “neither of those sound good. Subs aren’t just something you can control by putting a collar on them. We’re people, not some horse you need to break in.”
Sherlock crawled onto the bed, pulling the covers back, exposing his prize with a gleam in his eye. When he noticed John had a slight smile on his face, his cock hardened almost painfully fast. John wanted his lover even in his sleep, and Sherlock would never deny his boy what he craved. So, he straddled the thin hips, leaned back and began stoking himself over John.
“Hey, you okay there buddy,” John leaned down to look at the dazed man leaning against the bar.
“Okay John,” a sad smile across his face, “so what happened next?”
John sprung out of his chair, grabbing the plate in his hand, just in case he needed to use it as a weapon. “Don’t come any closer,” he threatened but his voice sounded slurred for some reason and the man he was warning seemed to double.
“So I was thinking. What if we created a class at IBAD to teach Subs with RDD how to create their own bliss! Then…then they could become soldiers, firefighters, police officers, anything. They wouldn’t be able to be Dommed and they would be able to do the dangerous jobs out there without any fear. It’s perfect!” John had a wide smile on his face, proud that he had come up with such a brilliant plan. Hell, he could even teach the classes.
If he left, then who knows how many people would suffer from Sherlock losing his mind. If John wasn’t there, would Sherlock pick someone up off the streets? Would he be able to solve cases? Would he kill somebody? Would he get hooked on drugs again? There were so many questions, and John knew most of them didn’t have good answers.
“Well,” an amused voice came from behind him, “it seems a little thief does come back to the honeypot. So soon, though, hmm, well perhaps you are not the smartest thief I’ve ever met. What is your name?” The voice asked and John leapt away from the wall, scurrying around to the other side of the table, away from the other man, who was clearly a Dom too.
“Please pullout it hurts,” John sobbed, but Sherlock observed the trembling hips jerked back towards him, subconsciously seeking out the pleasure the man could give him. He stood there for a moment, enjoying the feeling of being inside that warm twitching canal, imagining how full, how complete John must feel now that he had his lover all the way inside of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something tickled at the back of his brain and John identified it as danger. “I need to get home. I told my mom I would be home by five, Sherlock.”
He paused, in fact, dealing with his brother was the only time Mycroft hesitated in his decisions, and quite frankly it was pissing him off to be so inefficient. He sighed, leaned back in his chair and sealed John’s fate. “No, send one of our officers to find the evidence at the beach and then contact Mrs. Watson. Keep our men on the case, Anthea, I don’t want anyone sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong.”
John felt good, really really good but the problem with feeling like that was his mind just couldn’t quite grasp onto any thoughts as they passed through his brain. He was sliding down fast on a slick surface with only Sherlock standing at the bottom to catch him, which should terrify the young boy but he felt too good to care. A forehead was pressed against his, hands wrapped tightly around his chest and back, and the hot breath on his neck brought John even deeper into the light blue haze enveloping his entire being. There was quite mumbling next to his ear but John couldn’t make out the words, nor did he care to try because the deep timbre of the voice offered comfort in a way he’d never thought possible.
“No!” Sherlock shouted, his hand squeezing John’s spine.
“Help what?” Jim scoffed. “Help give us giant scars on the back of our necks? Help brainwash us? No thanks,” he stepped in between John and Harry. “I think you need to leave, John. I don’t have any use for Dom lovers in my group.”
As soon as John got home, he ran up the stairs to start his homework and talk to Sherlock. To his amazement, his new friend was a genius and helped him get his lessons done in record time. However, after three rapid texts during dinner, his mother told him to put the phone away, so John couldn’t talk to the teen until he was done and lying on his bed in his room.
The tension hung thick in the air. This was only the second time John had seen Sherlock nervous, the first being when John and Mycroft almost drowned in the Thames. It pulled at something deep down inside of John, something that told him to lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder to comfort him. The teenager wasn’t going to do it, or at least that’s what he’d planned. Now though, his head was resting gently on Sherlock’s shoulder, and his body was pressed up against the Dom’s side.
The man sat down next to him, touching their thighs and shoulders together. “Well there are hundreds if not thousands of beers around the world for you to try. That’s what’s cool about trying new things and having as many experiences as you can, yeah? Well, I don’t…that’s what I think at least.”
“Shoot him,” Sherlock said. John looked over to see Sherlock standing at his side with a hand on the Sub’s shoulder. “Do it,” he hissed. The tall gentle man he once knew had turned into a twisted caricature, with deep blackened eyes and a hungry sharp-toothed grin.
“Yes, yes, of course dear. I’m going to go over to Donna’s for a tick, will you be okay?” John nodded, not really hearing or caring what she said, “Good, it’s best you get a good night’s sleep for your first day back at school, yes? Good night, love,” She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and then he walked up stairs to the room she’d told him was his.
“Will Molly be there? And Jim?” John asked, hopeful to see his friends again.
“John, please, it doesn’t have to be this way. David and Amy will take good care of you. We don’t harm Subs.”
“At 10pm there will be a meet and greet brunch in the dining hall. You, Sherlock, and John will all sit at the head table. Would you like there to be a kneeling pad? Or will John be sitting on Sherlock’s lap?”
“What’s going on out there?” Mycroft called from inside the room. Without being told, John walked in to see a very pale, very un-Mycroft looking Mycroft. His hair was disheveled and his normally bright piercing eyes looked exhausted with dark circles hanging just above his cheekbones. There were wires and tubes sticking out everywhere, but John’s eyes were drawn to a pale arm wrapped in thick gauze.
The human attempted to stand, but his knees continued to wobble. Resorting to crawling, Mycroft made his way closer to his brother. A soft grunt and steady panting came from his prey and the stretched material around the man’s crotch told Sherlock he was the most powerful predator in the world to bring Mycroft Holmes to his knees. Well, the most powerful predator in the world if he wasn’t tied to a fucking chair by the vampire who created him.
Please enjoy(: and  feel free to comment below.
“What? What’s going on?” John asked, opening his eyes to see two black ones peering back at him. “Jim?”
Sherlock's POV as he tracks down John.
“How…” John asked dumbly, looking from Jim to Irene.
“That’s exactly right,” Greg told him, “they’ve been breaking into a lot of houses and stealing very valuable property. Now, if I’m not mistaken, you are the leader of that gang, yes?”
John let out a deep growl, but he knew he was stuck. If he moved just a millimeter, he would scratch Sherlock, which would result in that sweet blood dripping in his mouth. John knew he couldn’t handle that, so he simply released the numbing agent his body produced to stop his victims from screaming. “Good,” Sherlock said as the bottle filled with an opaque liquid.
, John’s mind kept telling his body, which only wanted to be held and kissed again.
Thank you for reading(: I hope you enjoyed this chapter.
“We’ve taken them into custody and our doctors are working on healing their internal organs, but most of them will need transplants to survive,” Mycroft said.
“And your mother, let’s not forget about her.”
“Oh God John!” he heard a shout from the end of the phone and he smiled at the approval in the man’s voice. “You are so beautiful, I would eat all of you in one bit,” the deep voice grunted and John knew he had come looking at the picture of his cock. “Come for me John.”
Sherlock's pissed and in more trouble than he knows. John sets in motion one of his brilliant master plans.
John laughed, trying to wipe the blush of his face, knowing he was being stupid for getting so worked up by a bloke he had only chatted with for an hour. John typed back.
“Don’t say that,” John chastised. “Greg would have grabbed you if I wasn’t there.” John was sure it was true, even though he did see fear in the Dom’s eyes when he was cradling Mycroft’s head. Jim needed to believe that though, believe that his guardian would risk his life to save him. It was important, and John had to realize that he wasn’t Jim’s protector any more.
“W-When you went down stairs…I-I saw my phone and I tried to call her, just…just to see…” He could tell the boy was worried he was going to upset the man for doing something behind his back. Sherlock decided John had been punished enough and no longer desired to extend the lesson. All that was left was picking up the pieces and putting them back together, just where he wanted them.
“Go away!” the man shouted and clutched his arm to him desperately.
John joked in his mind, barely even paying attention to what the Doctor was doing.
Ignoring the lady outside, who was now on her phone, John grabbed David’s mobile and typed in Baker Street on the GPS. If he could find the street then he could find the house, as it was the biggest one for kilometers.
Greg only huffed and threw his gun over his shoulder. “Sherlock’s secure. Now what?”
“Here,” Mycroft said, holding up a small cup of water with a purple straw. “The Doctor said you are only supposed to eat ice chips, but I asked for a glass of water.” The smugness in his voice was palpable, and Greg felt the need to throw up more than ever.
“Good. Now, whatever you do, don’t panic. He’s harmless,” Sherlock said, as he opened the door to reveal the vampire in his bed. John had knocked off a thick plastic vase, which was now sitting idle on the ground. Sherlock couldn’t find any reason for the vampires actions, but let it be, in favor of watching Lestrade’s reaction.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” John shouted and stood up from his seat, ice cream be damned.
“It’s all been taken care of; you never have to go back to that horrible life again, love.” Sherlock’s hand began moving down from his chest to the hem of his pants.
It was cloudy, but John didn’t mind, nor did he mind that his feet were still bare, because he got to feel the soft expertly cut grass below him. He hadn’t realized how much he missed being outside until this moment when all the memories of nights spent looking at the stars and sitting by a fire Mike made came rushing back. The feeling was strange to say the least, John thought, as he was walked to the car. It was so peaceful to be free and make his own choices, where he wanted to sleep, what he wanted to do, but at the same time it was nice to have a warm bed under him and to not have to worry about where he was going to get his next meal. “Watch your head,” Sherlock told him as a hand was placed on the top of his head.
Chapter 12 – Try a Little Tenderness
The wall behind John exploded and debris knocked everyone at the front table onto the floor a few meters away. Half of the back wall was missing and large concrete blocks were scattered through the room. Although not hit directly, the ceiling began shaking and showering dust on everyone as they tried to flee the scene.
“What did I do to deserve you, John?” the older man sped up his hips, moving over to rub against the boy’s thigh, which John was ever grateful for because even the soft material of his pants was irritating his oversensitive cock. It was strange feeling Sherlock’s hardness against his leg, recalling their first phone conversation when the man told him he was eight inches long. He really didn’t know how big eight inches was, but whatever was rutting against him felt enormous and intimidating.
“What the fuck are you on about, John? This is prime stuff, we can’t survive without it,” Mike challenged, holding some of the food Harry handed him closer to his chest.
Knowing this might be the only chance he’d have to escape, John sat up, jumped out of the bed, ran down the stairs and out into the fresh air…well, at least he tried to sit up but something strange stopped him. The teenager was still lying flat on his back when he looked down at his body. He screamed at the top of his lungs when his eyes fell upon his armless and legless from. His arms were cut off at the elbow, with neatly stitched off ends and his legs where cut off at the knee with similar care shown to the sown off joints. “Nonononono NO!” John screamed and tried to wiggle his deformed body awake, knowing that this had to be a dream. Sherlock might be crazy, yes, but he would never do this,
John was about to open his mouth to protest at being talked about like he wasn’t there but when the man named Mycroft turned his gaze upon him, John couldn’t help but lower his and continue eating. “And you propose this…feral Submissive will provide us more useful information than the two hundred we hold at our facility, is that right Sherlock?”
With his doctor side winning, John took the hand, cupping it gently in both of his. He let his tongue skim over the cut, causing a slight burning sensation and then a brief taste of pleasure. Sherlock sighed, lifting his hips slightly off the couch and rubbing his other hand over his chest. Without thinking, he put his hand on John’s head and tried to pull him in to lick his thigh.
“I thought he said he’s coming tomorrow,” John added when he saw a chance to give Jim and Harry more time. “It’s almost dark, so why not wait until he comes in the morning?”
Sherlock smiled, then poured some shower gel into his hand and began rubbing it gently over John’s smooth chest. He couldn’t stop the moan from escaping his lips at how just one touch made all of his skin tingle and feel like it was burning from the inside. One large hand held the back of his neck, while the other slowly worked the soap into a lather down his arms, his chest, and stomach, finally traveling down to his half hard cock. As soon as Sherlock began playing with the short fine blonde hairs resting around his member, John dropped his head on the man’s shoulders.
“No,” Sherlock and Greg said in unison.
He figured he looked like a beached fish flopping and shivering around on the bed but none of that matter, at least not when the loud moans above him approved so wholly of his actions. “Mine!” Sherlock shouted and then there were warm streaks hitting his belly, chest, and face. When John opened his eyes he saw pearly white come spread over him and a large leaking cock deflating in Sherlock’s hand. He was marked,
“No, I shouldn’t have acted that way. I just, I can’t lose you John and I over reacted, it’s my fault.”
“Whatever,” he tried to glare at the man and look threatening even though he was almost a full head shorter, forcing him to look up and expose his neck.
“You’re doing the right thing,” Greg told him. “I promise your friends will be taken care of.”
John looked longingly at the door, hoping Sherlock would come in and make his decision for him. It was that right there that made John question himself, and decide to go with the other Subs. After all, the only person looking out for John was John, not Sherlock or Mycroft. “What do you need me to do?”
“Oh yeah, uhh, sorry I just…do you really mean that because if you don’t that’s cool, I get it-“
“Oh God,” Sherlock said, his whole body tensing as John held him tighter to the couch. He came with a groan, his whole body shaking as come shot onto his chest. John finally pulled away, his eyes turning blue again and the intimidating canines pulling back up into his gums. “John, that was…that was,” Sherlock tried to say, his post orgasmic state, along with the drugs coursing through his veins, getting the better of him.
“Hmm?” Mycroft grunted, but opened his eyes and made a valiant attempt to get off the bed. “Yes, yes, of course I can, why wouldn’t I be able to walk on my own?”
“I don’t understand,” John said, because he didn’t. His feet just moved on instinct, other than that, he couldn’t really remember what happened.
“John,” Sherlock said, “you have to understand that we have your best interest at heart, all the Subs for that matter.”
I hope you enjoyed or I at least made you feel as icky as I felt when writing it. I would love to hear what you thought. Thanks for reading(:
“Are you alright? Was it the soup I made?”
“Y-You can’t do this,” John sputtered out, trying anything that came to his mind to get out of this horrid situation he fell into. “There are laws…laws that say you can’t keep a Sub without-“
John let out a growl, his teeth descending. He got up on his knees, preparing to fight off the crazy human with all his might.
There is explicit material in this chapter. It is more consensual than the ones in 'Lies' but obviously, John is still a minor who has been manipulated by Sherlock to think everything is okay and normal. So, in a sense, this is more dub-con than non-con but this is just a friendly warning(:
John sniffed a few times, the cold doing nothing to help the snot pouring out of his nose. “I’m sorry,” he said to the tombstone. He ran his hand over the white stone, his fingers tracing the grooves that spelled out the boy’s name. John was sorry for all the Subs who had died because they couldn’t feel bliss. What Doms were doing might not be right, but John knew the first step was to make sure no more Subs died because of the way this stupid world was set up. It was John’s job to protect the Subs who were still alive, then he would worry about the resistance.
“He said he would wait for you. However, you must realize John is still a child and has a lot of-“
“Of course, I understand. You were a great help with John and I already have people watching him around the clock, most likely until he graduates. I do care about him, Lestrade, although I know it does not seem so, but I make the hard choices to protect him better than anyone can. Please, I ask you to reconsider your resignation and come back to talk to me when you aren’t so upset, yes.” Mycroft let a sympathetic smile come across his face as Greg walked out of the room, his shoulders slumped slightly.
It was light outside when John woke, the navy blue curtains glowed slightly as they stopped the sun from penetrating the room. The Sub groaned as he rolled over in a soft silky bed and to John’s surprise he was able to roll twice and he still didn’t fall off.
His John smiled back with adoration in his eyes, “cheers,” he said, but as soon as he took a sip, the smile faded and Sherlock could tell he was not a fan. However, even if he could coax the boy into drinking half the bottle, with his low tolerance level, it would relax him enough to stop jiggling his small knee. “It’s not bad, I guess but I don’t see how people can drink this one with dinners and stuff.”
“No!” She protested seriously, making John laugh and wince at the same time. Molly looked down at him then back to Sherlock, cupping her hand again to tell the man a secret.
“John’s not,” Sherlock said, though John didn’t know why that was important. He was feeling quite warm now, and honestly, all he wanted to do was close his eyes and curl up next to Sherlock. “Don’t close your eyes, do you understand me John?”
“Why?” John asked, the question taking Sherlock off guard. How did he not know? Sherlock had worshipped the ground John walked on for five years and would continue to do so until the day he died. He’d branded a ‘JW’ on his body for John, killed for John, made love sweetly to John, taken his virginity, taken everything and given everything for John.
“No, not anymore, but you were before the Holmes’ saved you, correct?”
“Shh, that’s it,” he felt something cover his face. It was plastic, or maybe metal, John really couldn’t tell and honestly didn’t care as a strap pressed against the sides of his head and all the way around to the back. There was a soft click followed by praise, which made everything alright. Everything was alright.
John felt the warmth on his side and the hand on his back as it brought him slowly back down to earth. Sherlock held onto him tightly, making John want to snuggle in deeper, but he knew he wasn’t supposed to. He did anyway.
“My John, my John,” Sherlock chanted as the thrusts became faster. The first time he’d actually listened to the words spilling from the man’s lips, John panicked at the possessiveness he heard and felt. Later though, it became a way of life, a comfort when he felt he had nothing to hold onto. If nothing else, if his mother didn’t cried at his funeral, if Mike didn’t try to contact him, if everyone thought he was dead and didn’t give a flying fuck about it…at least he belonged somewhere and to someone who John knew would never let him go. This was his life now and John cherished the way Sherlock held him tighter and whispered “I love you,” over and over again in his ear when he felt hot come shoot into his body as his own release escaped him and landed on Sherlock’s chest and face.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said, standing up and walking over to the Sub lying on the floor, sprawled out and panting. “He’s just panicked by his own nature finally returning from its dormant state. A cave with silhouettes is nothing compared to actual grass beneath your feet, is it John?” The tall man was now standing above him, looking down with a wide smile on his face. “The pound wouldn’t know what to do with him, you know that Mycroft.”
“Sherlock, settle down, you are only making it harder than it already is for the poor boy,” a familiar voice came from somewhere inside the building.
“Indeed, I had the good fortune to be born with a receptor, but I am like you John. All of the Subs in our cause are like you.” She turned back around to face John.
Sherlock and Mycroft sat on one side, while Greg sat on the other with Jim shuffling in behind him. “Jim, it’s good to see you are in good health,” Mycroft said, bowing his head slightly. The eldest Holmes had his arm in a sling and a large bandage over the top of his hand.
John felt something inside him break, something similar to when he was a boy and he found out he wasn’t going to see Sherlock for ten years. Except this time, instead of tears and sorrow, John felt anger boil up inside him as the small fountain began to gush with the black tar Sherlock had fed him over the past six months.
“I-um-well, you see…it’s kind of a funny story,” John stuttered, scratching at his neck again.
“Oh, well I guess I’m about four and a half or five inches when I’m fully…umm hard. What-I mean how big are you?”
“Oh yes you are,” Sherlock countered moving down to kiss along the boy’s cheek and down to his collar bone. “And cute, and adorable, and smart, and cheeky,” he emphasized each compliment with a kiss until he got down to the armpit, “and stinky!” John panicked, realizing his breath must smell awful, along with his armpits and his greasy hair.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand, and to the boy’s horror and secret glee, the man kissed his knuckles. After a brief moment, Sherlock placed John’s hand back in the water to continue covering himself. There was a bright smile on Sherlock’s face now, one John had never seen before. It was akin to Molly’s joyous expression when she had chocolate for the first time.
and John would be fucking him at 221B within the hour. “What do you think, John?” Sherlock asked, keeping his voice light and making the intent of his question unknown. Knowing John, his sweet John, the boy would immediately think Sherlock was asking if Archie should come back home with them. It was a bit sad really, and Sherlock took the blame upon himself that John would still think there could ever be anyone else in their lives. Now though, he was grateful for it and used it as an advantage.
“You’re not taking me to the kennel, are you?” John asked nervously, putting his head down, not willing to look at Sherlock.
Suddenly, John’s vision went from red to a calm yellow hue. He didn’t know how it had happened, but Sherlock was whispering in his ear and rubbing one hand along his back and the other through his hair. “Shh, easy, easy” he said as if trying to calm a wild colt. “Let him finish, John, and then we can discuss the details.” John hadn’t realized he was basically in a choke hold until Sherlock let go and righted him on the couch.

Chapter 7 – Take this Dirty Water
“No, no, of course not,” Sherlock assured him, because it was true, he wasn’t even attracted to the small unconscious boy in his bedroom. All he wanted was John, and John was what he would have. “I only want you, John.” Sherlock lifted himself up slightly, pulling off his pants as well as John’s. “Tell me you want me.”
Just thinking about the gorgeous college student kissing him made John almost come right in his trousers in the middle of class.
“You’re welcome then,” Mrs. Hudson said a tad annoyed at being completely ignored.
“I believe you are going to want to hear what I have to say, Mr. Watson,” a female voice said.
“Sherlock, I don’t want to be here,” John said, his voice breaking as tears threatened to fall. The man avoided eye contact though, and ignored John’s pleas.
When he finally arrived, Sherlock paid the cabby and then cautiously made his way into the old building. “Well look who it is,” a voice, not John’s voice, echoed off the walls like a pinball. “The great Sherlock Holmes has come to grace us with his presence!”
“Sherlock,” the boy moaned when the detective finally touched the tight puckered hole he wanted from the first moment he talked to John in that chat room. It was all down to this final scene and the play would be over and John would finally be his.
Hello everyone! Wow, I was really amazed by the response I got for the vote. Since so many people voted and some wanted good while others wanted bad, I will be writing both endings. The good-ish ending will be the official one and the darker one will be an alternate ending. Thank you all for voting, now here, have some smut on the house.
The man behind him sighed but didn’t remove his hands from just under the elastic of John’s sleep trousers. “John Hamish Watson his dead,” Sherlock ran his other fingers over one of the teen’s nipples, bringing a moan from his lips. John could feel himself sinking in the pools of lust and sensation, his feet and arms treading as hard as they could to keep his mind coherent and logical. “Your mother’s son died Sunday morning and then John Franklin Thomas was born.” Sherlock’s nonchalant voice was what made the teen really start to panic. The lies could be undone, his death wasn’t real, this John Thomas wasn’t real, however, sitting in this man’s lap was and there was no escape, no light house to help him find a way out.
The man was as tall as Sherlock, but had reddish-brown hair with a well-trimmed beard that shimmered lightly in the fluorescents. He walked towards John with an air of confidence and the heaviness of a man who had been through a lot. “John Watson, it’s nice to finally put a face to the name.”
“Really?”
“I’ve told you before, John, there are only two options for Subs with RDD that will be internationally accepted. One,” Sherlock stood, wiping his hands on his gown, “they are either put down or given electrotherapy. You of all people know this, and it will continue to happen every time a faulty Sub presents.”
“Cheers,” the boy smiled and took a long sip of the dark brown ale. He tried hard not to scrunch up his nose at the bitter taste, but he failed miserably causing the other man to giggle at him. “It’s not bad, I guess but I don’t see how people can drink this one with dinners and stuff.”
“I’m-I’m okay, I guess,” John mumbled, his nerves calming down now that he knew Sherlock was okay.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I’m glad you’re okay too,” John told her, trying to pull away, but as always, she was much stronger and kept her brother securely in front of her.
“You believe? YOU BELIEVE!” Greg shouted, throwing his glass against the corner. Amber liquid and shards of crystal smashed and scattered across the floor. “You didn’t see the look in that kid’s eyes, Mycroft! John Watson doesn’t exist anymore, Sherlock made sure of that and all you can say is ‘I believe she’s trying to help him.’ Bloody hell, I’m done,” the DI said and stood up.
John stayed quiet, listening to the beeping and arguing going on around him. The voices seemed far away, but he kept his eyes closed and breathing even, just in case.
Thinking quickly, and cheating a bit, John looked at Molly’s ice cream and a light bulb went off in his head. “I wanted ice cream and the nurses wouldn’t bring me any.”
“Good boy,” Mycroft smiled, running a hand through John’s hair, making the boy close his eyes and shiver at the uncomfortable contact. “I knew you were smarter than you looked. Now, I believe Sherlock is waiting for you. Go,” the command washed over him but it wasn’t strong enough to force him. However, the threat of uncertainty was enough to make John rise from his chair and head upstairs.
“That reminds me,” Mycroft said, standing up and walking over to kneel in front of Molly. “I brought this for you.” He pulled out the largest bar of chocolate Molly had ever seen. She had only had chocolate once before she met Greg, and that was only a small piece that John had stolen for her. Now, Greg would give her sweets all the time, as long as she ate her vegetables, of course.
The change was immediate. Bell let out an inhuman growl and looked directly at Sherlock, who was still enveloped by the darkness. Sharp white teeth hissed at him, but Sherlock merely rolled his eyes and stood up to walk towards the trapped beast. The net was made from the finest ghost twine, latching on to the vampire’s skin and keeping him in place even as he used his superior strength to rip it.
“Sherlock?” his head popped up, looking down at the man who gave him a crooked grin. “You’re alright, you’re…” suddenly, John’s head felt lighter than air, but it wasn’t from happiness. John leaned back on his haunches, his eyes rolling back into his head. “I don’t…I don’t feel so well,” John mumbled, as feeling in his limbs started to fade and his tongue went numb.
A deafening shot rang through the room and the tar turned to ash instantly, floating off to settle beside him. Sherlock gasped as the weight was lifted from his body, peering over to see Moriarty’s lifeless body next to him. “Sherlock!” John shouted, bringing the detective to sit up and look at the pale, terrified boy with a gun, t
With a single word from Mycroft, the driver pulled away towards the Holmes estate. They sat in silence for a long time, but the heat emanating from both Doms on either side was driving John mad. He was burning up being pressed against Sherlock’s side. Sweat started forming on his brow when they finally pulled up to the house.
John knew all new vampires had to remain with their sires until they were five years old. If Mycroft tried to take Sherlock away, the newly transformed vampire would wither away. The darkness in John smiled. It would be his first vampire, and Sherlock was perfect for the job.
“She’s not going to die, none of us are. Harry and Mike, you two are going to start the fire at the neighbors. Do you still have those whiskey bottles?” He asked Harry, who was already putting the Molotov cocktails they’d made a couple of weeks ago after robbing a bar.
“But?”
His youth, inexperience, and the fact an older boy was thinking about him while jerking off made John shoot off like a rocket. “Holy fuck!” He groaned looking down at the light white come all over his shirt, “damn it.”
“You need to leave. You’re only making things worse right now,” John told the two men who stood in awe of the animalistic behavior from their friend. “Go!” John shouted when they didn’t head for the door.
It took him no time at all to stumble into the corner, his thighs still felt like jelly but he supported himself by propping his head against the wall. He didn’t like it, it was too exposing and made John feel vulnerable to have his back turned to the entire room, especially now that a new addition was about to be made. The thought was horrible but John prayed that it would only be Sherlock coming to get him and perform whatever experiments he wanted.
For a moment, he thought John wouldn’t follow him, but when he arrived at the bottom of the steps, he heard the slight thump of someone walking down behind him. Sherlock smiled and flopped down on the couch, his robe and pajama trousers swishing behind him. Now, he would wait for his chance, like a lioness waits in the brush.
“No, that’s it, don’t you see? He wants me, so I can be the bait and then you can catch him, it’s perfect!” John shouted, a wide smile growing on his face as he waited for Sherlock’s approval. However, that approval would not come, would never come when John tried to revert back to his old ways of being the martyr. The detective’s face grew dark as he stared down the boy until John’s smile turned to a frown. “It’s the only way, Sherlock,” he tried once more. The rub of it was though that yes, of course it was a brilliant plan. Talk to Moriarty at the chat room, make him think he was talking to John, convince him the boy was angry at Sherlock and wanted to go home, and then the spider would leave its web and come to his to be exterminated.
“Pity, that’s all you seem to be able to say and you know I do not approve of that kind of language, John. Some might think you were doing it on purpose…to get a rise out of me, as they say.”
“If you aren’t going to put them in yourself, then I will. Now hold still,” John took two long strides over to the couch, straddling Sherlock’s thin hips and placed a gentle hand on brown curls to hold his head in place.
“How are you feeling? I sent a nurse to fetch you better blankets. You can have my coat for a bit if you want. Does your head hurt? I told them to give you more morphine, but I’m pretty sure the Doctor lied to me when he said he gave you the proper dosage,” Sherlock said in one breath, then looked at John expecting him to answer every question.
John moaned softly, his breath steady as it flooded into Sherlock’s mouth. It was like they were breathing for one another.
John said and pulled his shirt and trousers on. He didn’t know what he was supposed to do now. The Resistance gave him one more mission; to expose Mycroft and Greg.
“For what, lad?” Greg asked, taking a few more step towards John, hovering over him.
“Sure,” Sherlock said, wrapping the lead around his hand and walking out of the room.
“Yeah, I totally agree with you mate! That’s why I was so excited when we talked about these scholarships. Uni will be awesome, I just know it!” John took another sip of the beer and set it down on the table, focusing his attention back on the papers and trying hard not to think about how warm Sherlock’s leg was against his. The two sat on the couch filling out the forms quietly, but the teen just couldn’t stop his mind from running around in circles. “Can I use the loo?”
“My God, what happened to your neck?” Harry asked, grabbing her brother’s head and none to gently pulling it to the side. “What did those bastards do to you?”
if John was being honest with himself. If he and his sister hadn’t presented as submissive, then he wouldn’t be a freezing homeless runaway thief gang leader,
“What in the hell did Sherlock do to him?” Greg growled. The human was sitting on the couch with Mycroft’s head in his lap. His hand carded nervously through his lover’s hair, forcing a touch of sympathy from John. Although the two men on the couch had dedicated their lives to slaughtering his kind, oddly enough, John didn’t want to rip them limb from limb. Did he like them? Eh, not really. But John did respect them for sticking with Sherlock even when their friend and brother was turning into a vampire.
“I’ll work with him, Mycroft. I said I would,” Sherlock said, looking over at John.
“Ummm, yeah a Coke sounds great,” John yelled, causing Sherlock to smirk when he had even caused the boys voice to crack. He knew exactly how to use that anxiety to his advantage, and would do so beautifully. Sherlock made his move, striding gracefully into the living room holding the Ale he’d always intended to serve.
“Fuck,” Sherlock laughed in his post orgasmic high, then he slowly stood up and headed for the bathroom. Stripping and turning on the tap to the bathtub, he sat his mobile down on the edge and gracefully sunk into the warm bubbly water. Instead of murders, clues, facts, and deductions battling through his mind, Sherlock was graced with peaceful images of the teenage boy sitting in their tub letting his best mate and lover wash off the sex from a few minutes ago. The detective leaned his head back and closed his eyes, a slight smile on his face as he cradled John in the tranquility of the blackest chasms of his mind.
Hey everyone, there are only a few more chapters left and I promise everything will be explained in the next chapter. Oh and sorry about the cliffhanger, it's a doozy(:
One more note, Ignorance was Bliss is not a Muse song, but I really liked the title so I used it, so don't be surprised if you can't find it.
“Well, the way I see it, you can either put your trousers back on, leave, and let Mycroft come back in a couple of days to try again, or,” John paused, looking over at Sherlock, assessing, “I can wake him up and we can try again. It’s up to you. You need to be willing or your fear is going to trigger Sherlock’s instinct to hunt.”
“No, nothing like that,” Sherlock replied, though John hadn’t said a word. He hated when Sherlock did that, well, actually, deep down it made him feel good to be completely translucent to someone. “Their kidneys, livers, hearts, and brains had been so adversely effected by their constant use of bliss, that all they could do was walk around smiling. They had become addicted to the dopamine their body created, and it destroyed them.”
“Maybe,” Sherlock furrowed his brow, thinking of what would bring John over to their side without completely breaking him. “Maybe.”
The blow hurt John’s hand more than it hurt David, causing the teenager to cradle his hand his chest.
“Is that understood, John?” Mycroft asked again. There was sternness in his voice, but no malice or anger.
“Jim, are you okay? What happened to you?” The man’s voice was panicked. It strangely made Jim’s tummy warm to know that someone was worried about him, especially a Dom.
John had a wide grin on his face as he walked out of the store with a plastic bag full of the clothes he purchased. Mike and the three girls were still sitting at a table drinking their coffee, when he bought his own and joined in on the conversation.
Sherlock had a small eerie smile on his face as he looked at John. “That’s what you think.”
Inhaling in an attempt to compose himself, John came out with, “You’ve had the contact information of the group who took Sherlock all along?”
Upon Mycroft’s entrance, Sherlock moved from behind the desk.
Once unfettered, he crouched to search the man, only to find him unbothered by a weapon. A frown befell his face, but he quickly shook it off, taking the only chance he may have to escape the enclosure.
,” he said mockingly. “You already know what’s coming, so you might as well play along.” Sherlock locked eyes with him, not responding, his jaw tightening. He handed the cloth to the man in the mask, before being handed a jug of water from the person off-screen.
John closed his laptop and turned to face him. “I heard your breathing pattern change while he was asking me about my Service. You’re getting rusty.” He smirked at Sherlock’s dismissal. He still had not told Sherlock the extra protection had come from Donovan, knowing neither he nor whichever officer took over would ever hear the end of it. “Might as well go back to sleep. It’s past ten.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The pause was one to drive Sherlock to madness.
“Hello?” he queried as he brought his phone to his ear.
Versed the alternative, which he knew included a live dismemberment.
He reached out to grab the chair and pull himself up, taking in his surroundings and listening for the sounds to ensure he was not alone, though there were none. Behind him, the door to the office was closed. Approaching it, he reached out to grab the handle, only to realize there was not one. His chest tightened and he turned around, his stomach immediately lurching.
Clenching his jaw, he slowly spoke, “Sherlock…there is nothing to absolve you from – you did nothing wrong.”
On the desk was the deceased’s severed head, blood pooling on the desk and dripping over the edge to the floor. In one chair sat the severed limbs, the torso in the other, each dripping red. Slowly and hesitantly, he inched towards the head, his jaw tight and eyes focused. When he passed the chair harbouring the limbs, the severed arm reached out for his leg, causing him to jump and take his attention from the desk. He glanced back to it, only to see it was gone.
Sherlock’s breath caught as his gaze finally came up to meet the other’s. His pupils began to grow smaller and he drew out, “John.”
The man’s accent was slight and forced, making the detective realize he was not British, nor part of the United Kingdom. Opening his eyes, they began to focus, albeit slowly.
Sherlock had to come to terms with his situation, no matter the pain it would cause. It was not something John was looking forward to, but until he did, the younger man would have nothing to look forward to but anxiety, panic and the inevitable depression. Given his inner workings, the latter was what terrified John the most. If Sherlock’s mind were to fall into the part that was always behind the curtain, pulling him back would prove to be either difficult or impossible. He wanted to help him avoid that darkness as much as possible, but, at the same time, he could not stand idly by and allow his mate to self-destruct.
Before John could respond, familiar voices were heard from beyond the door to the hall, drawing Sherlock’s attention.
Even Sherlock would have known to stop pressing for comments, leaving John to his own devices.
“Right. Thanks,” he said as he began following the officer. “Keep me updated, won’t you?” The response he received was a nod from Donovan, though her attention had gone back to staring into the holding room.
After making another right and walking the block to stand outside of the restaurant, he turned to see how far back his friend was, only to see he had not yet turned the corner. He waited another moment, but when Sherlock still failed to round the street, he released an aggravated sigh, his steps heavy in annoyance as he retraced his steps. When he turned onto the street, he expected to see Sherlock caught up in reading a flyer or something of the like; instead, he was introduced to his best mate leaning his back against a building, holding his head, appearing to sway.
A sharp headache made itself apparent.
“Goddamn it,” the unmasked man groaned. With his free hand, he started to lightly smack Sherlock’s face. “It’s too early to die, Sherlock. C’mon. Wakey, wakey.”
It was not long before John took out his laptop. The first page to pop up was a news headline reporting more on the drug trafficking ring, listing more members. The same three pictures were at the top of the article of Francis Bellman, Dreln Hargett and Emilia Hernandez. Seeing the face of the American caused a flare of anger in John’s chest. Sherlock had gone quiet and when John glanced at him, his mate’s eyes were trained on the same photo, jaw taught and fist clenched as tight as he was able. Focusing back on the laptop, he scrolled down, getting the images off the screen as he set his other hand on Sherlock’s, grounding him. Sherlock commented on the article leaving out information about members of Scotland Yard having been discovered in the ranks, seeming to ignore the contact, but John was acutely aware of his fist relaxing.
He shook his head, shrugging. “Nope. Don’t even know if he saw our video, to be honest.”
Even in his boredom, he would not stoop to such a mundane level.
He quickly positioned his right wrist back into the shackle without locking it back into place and slipped the pin into the cuff of his shirt. He set his head on the ground.
“For what?” came the nonchalant response, John’s eyes scanning the lit screen in front of him.
as the call ended and he returned his phone to his pocket. “Seems the van has been located,” he responded to John’s unasked question. “You will be accompanying me, I assume.” He passed John to the flat’s door, but not before he took up his umbrella, which had been leaning against the back of the chair his younger brother typically occupied.
At first, he was not even aware his mobile had gone off, it having fallen to the floor at some time during the night. His laptop nearly met it when he sat up, only being caught by John at the last second. Finding his phone underneath the bed, he was alerted to several text messages that Lestrade had apparently been sending throughout the night, the most recent reading 87. He unlocked his phone and sat back in the chair, scrolling through the updates, checking for anything that was not number-based. He tossed the phone on the table with a sigh when they were just that and stared at his incapacitated ally.
“Holy shit,” the man laughed, going faster. “I wonder if I get to my elbow?”
The only reaction he received was the masked man pulling the white cloth over his face and pulling back, forcing Sherlock’s head backwards. “Get your last breath in, Mr. Holmes,” the unmasked man said as he undid the lid to the water jug. “You’re going to need it.”
He was eyeing the steamed fruit when hard footsteps came to a stop outside of the door to the room.
“Texting your boss to tell him you’ve got me chained to a chair?” he asked, voice flooded with sarcasm.
Sherlock shot him a glare before rolling off the bed. He crossed the room to stand in front of Mycroft. Taking the door, he slammed it shut and crossed his arms across his chest. Mycroft visibly tensed. Even in his drunken state, he was standing straighter and eyeing his younger brother.
However, the other rolled their eyes and knelt back down by the body, bringing up the saw and continuing with the final limb. Satisfied, the American brought his phone back to him and continued scrolling and sending out messages.
From Sherlock’s coat, scarf, socks and shoes to his mobile phone – the one thing he was never without.
A small noise escaped from Sherlock’s throat, one which could have been mistaken as a whine. It was followed by, “…stop….”
“The detective dies, even if his “important brother” were to stop his own investigation.”
The moment seemed to drag before the obstruction was pulled from his throat, giving him a moment of reprieve. Dreln positioned himself, his hips directly overtop Sherlock’s head as his forearms kept him propped up, allowing him to thrust his hips forward over-and-over, moaning with each lunge. Sherlock gave up trying to push him off, accepting being used like nothing more than a doll as he tried not to gag each time the impediment hit his uvula and further.
Even with his eyelids shut, he could see the flash of the American’s phone shine on the wall.
John managed to break free from the detective inspector.
The recollection of being violated and humiliated ran across his mind and Sherlock found himself creasing his forehead, complete uncertainty raging throughout him. He began recalling all the times John had stayed with him, when anyone else would have abandoned him: his initial verbal reading of the older man in the cab, John being near death during his first confrontation with Moriarty, his rejection of companionship during their time in Baskerville, his return after his supposed-death and John’s initial rejection.
The safety of the nation was more important than one man. With a group as violent and threatening as to what he had experienced, having the like trouncing about the county would only end in the bereavements of thousands.
As Donovan escorted the young woman to Lestrade’s office, Lestrade looked at John, whose eyebrows were furrowed upwards, apprehension written across his face, though Lestrade was certain his expression mirrored the same.
At Lestrade’s confirmation, John’s disheartened posture was difficult to ignore. Without so much as a glance, she left their presence to pull out the patrol car; meanwhile, the army doctor was searching for other possibilities, his mind turning over itself as every thought that flittered across his mind wound up at a dead end.
The closer he got, the more inquisitive he became.
The man stepped over the body, which was now missing its head, both arms and one leg, unlocking his phone and bringing it to his ear.
I've read four of former-FBI Profiler John Douglas' books, two of the Asylum books and several of my old college textbooks.
So...it's been over a month.
“Look at that: he does cry,” came Dreln’s voice next to his head.
Mycroft staggered to the door and opened it, a hint which Sherlock blatantly ignored. “That would because you are a child, dear brother. It is beyond you.”
“Hey,” he called to him, drawing his attention. “Mind if I get a fag?”
The other clicked his tongue before pulling his attention back to the American. “Have you heard from Mycroft Holmes, yet?”
“No. No – no – no – Sherlock, don’t you dare,” he spoke in haste, leaning back on his heels. He gripped the sides of the man’s shirt on his breast, pulling it apart, the buttons popping off in random directions as his chest was bared. Lacing his fingers overtop each other, he began pressing the heel of his palm over Sherlock’s breastbone. “You can’t leave me like this, you bastard, come on.” Using his own bodyweight, he started compressions, eyes on Sherlock’s face, waiting for a semblance of life.
“As quick as it can be.” Dreln shifted, his hand leaving Sherlock’s forehead to run down his cheek. “I really was hoping to see you make it, you know,” Dreln said as he straddled Sherlock’s hips, bringing his hand to trace Sherlock’s neck. “It’s a shame, really, someone like you going to waste.” He began adding pressure, leaving Sherlock to shut his eyes as he tried to make his final thoughts memorable.
“Breakfast already?” Sherlock asked still full of sleep.
John breathed out a laugh. He had not even realized Mycroft was there. Then again, of course he had to have been. He was right on their heels on the ride to the hospital. “Mycroft.”
As he pulled it out of his pocket, Donovan’s began ringing.
“I suspect you know when they’ll release me from my shackles,” Sherlock asked as he bit into it, making a face as though he were a child.
Outside the door to the flat, his hand hovered over the doorknob. With a deep breath, he pushed the door open.
The van was sitting on the southern bank of the River Thames by the time John had arrived alongside Mycroft. The van’s interior was waterlogged and several scenes of crime officers were scouring the taped-off scene, taking photographs and trying to recover what they could from the damaged vehicle.
Peering down at the soldier’s taught expression, Mycroft spoke to the person on the other line: “Do excuse me. I have a matter to attend to.” He brought the phone from his ear, ending whatever call he had taken. He pocketed his mobile before standing straight, looking at John as though he was an inconvenience. “Is there a problem, Doctor Watson?”
“Ah, Sherlock. Glad you could join us. I was just showing your brother some of my favourite moments together.” Sherlock looked at Mycroft, who said nothing, instead watching his younger brother with nothing but disappointment. “We did have fun, didn’t we?”
The camera used in the video shook as it was taken off the tripod and moved closer to the semen dripping out of Sherlock’s rear. His right cheek was gripped and spread, followed by the American’s voice with, “Mycroft, if you want in on this, give me a call.” The camera was turned, showing the face of the speaker, a smirk on his features. “You know how to find me.”
There was a pause before Sherlock came out again with, “Bath.”
He was by the river.
Without any prompting, the man brought their mouths together; reactionary response had Sherlock clenching his jaw. The American spent a few moments trying to get Sherlock to open his mouth, which he had to force by pressing his fingers into Sherlock’s cheeks. The moment there was slack, he sucked the genius’s tongue between his teeth before biting down, garnering a muffled shout as Sherlock’s tongue retracted from reflex. The man pulled back, grinning as he licked Sherlock’s blood from his own lip.
Two men entered the room, one donning brown cargo pants and black tank-top, the other in dark-washed jeans and white button-up. Unlike the people Sherlock had been introduced to, neither of them had track marks on their arms, nor were their eyes reflecting any form of drug use. The way they carried themselves, for the first time, had Sherlock feel threatened. There was the speculation that it was not they who listened to the man Sherlock had first met, but had most likely received orders from higher up – perhaps even the runner of whatever group Mycroft had managed to gain the attention of.
“Damn, Sherlock,” came the voice of the American – Dreln – followed by a laugh. “How do you think Mycroft’ll feel seeing his little brother so loose?” Sherlock felt a finger enter his rectum, followed by two more digits. “Fuck…I could probably fit my whole hand in there.” The comment was met by a fourth finger, making Sherlock tense. When a thumb entered him, Dreln followed up with, “I’d love to stick my dick in there, but I don’t fuck whores – might catch something.”
“You’ve had their contact all along?” John’s voice came out tight, a clear attempt at not shouting as Mycroft turned to face him, his phone at his ear.
Sherlock raised his brows. “You knew?”
A smile formed at the edge of his lips before he scoffed and set it down on the table. Focusing back on his phone, he pressed the power button and was genuinely surprised when the screen lit up. He entered his passcode and was introduced to a slew of unread messages – namely updates about potential cases he had been following prior to the abduction. There were a number of texts from various phone numbers asking for his assistance about certain issues, which he found himself screening through to see if any were worth his attention.
Lestrade failed to respond, instead stalling as he gave the eldest brother a sympathetic look, his eyes glazed over. “We found him unresponsive in the sub-level. Medical is working on him.”
“You’re not alone.” John held his hand out to him. Sherlock looked down at the open palm in uncertainty. His eyes darted up, but before he could comment, John continued, “I’m here with you, Sherlock. I’ll always be here.” With the reassuring gaze of his best mate, even despite his own internal conflict, Sherlock found himself reaching out his own hand.
At the very end of the article was written the hospital Sherlock was being housed in with the line “and we wish him a quick recovery.” He hung on that last line, reading it over and over until the words meant nothing.
He had coffee started before returning to the living room. The sound of the shower running could be heard, signalling that Sherlock was already awake. He was half-tempted to knock on the door to alert him of his presence; yet, when his eyes caught the letter again, he figured to wait a few minutes. He picked up the letter on the table, releasing a chuckle at reading Lestrade’s note.
Then again, perhaps he would not have to confront them both, after all.
The sound of Lestrade’s mobile broke the tension.
The thought made him smile.
His air of relief quickly diminished when the man walked into the room. He swung at him, aiming for his temple, only for his hand to be grabbed and twisted until there was a faint
Many times, he had found himself in life-threatening situations, but there had always been a way out – an alternate solution. For the first time, his logic had failed. All of his hope had to be placed in the external, something he knew was unreliable and relied on chance; yet, all of the chance cards he had once held were confiscated and he was left with the solemn realization that his moments were few.
He moved into the same direction the nurse had gone towards the lifts. If he was lucky, Sherlock would be coming-to, though it was an optimistic thought. It was a day ago when he had been asked to pose as a Cielo Diablos member and his mate had yet to return to the waking world. Lestrade had stopped by during his free time; whenever he was not dealing with cases files or the overall investigation of the drug cartel’s infiltration of the city. After Christopher Cleary was brought in, the information John was given became less and less. While he understood why, he had to refrain from becoming actively upset with being left in the shadows.
At the comment, Mycroft reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s groin. “Is this what you want to know about?!” he said with a ferocity Sherlock had only heard a few times before. The contact immediately caused Sherlock to go rigid and his arrogant demeanour to melt away, the colour draining from his face. “You’re so determined to know everything, after all!” He pinned Sherlock against the door, his knee between his thighs and his hands moving downwards to undo the belt to his brother’s trousers.
“Just like when we were younger,” Mycroft said as he caressed his brother’s cheek. “It will always be your fault.”
His chest had grown so tight by the time he entered the bathroom, breathing felt like a chore. He caught himself on the sink as the crutch fell to the floor, making a loud
The memories forced his unwanted emotion to the surface and he felt his eyes burn. “John,” he said, calling his mate’s attention.
His mind raced with possibilities on how to find his best mate, but with no leads, he could not think properly on where to start. The feel of Mycroft’s eyes watching him was making him crosser and he found himself wanting to slam his fist against the eldest Holmes’ face. If Mycroft would have at least told
Anywho!
Even Dreln’s reaction was of surprise at the comment as he went back to scrolling through his mobile. The normal confidence Sherlock exuded fell the wayside under his brother’s cold eyes; it was the very same look he was given that night when he was sixteen – when Mycroft left him bleeding and curled up on the floor.
The EMP leaned back as another shock coursed through Sherlock’s body.
If I don't have chapter six up by Saturday,
“That wasn’t me,” he said, voice shaking. “It was you.”
John could not help but chuckle.
“Care to give me a chance before getting my prick all splintered?” came the familiar voice of the Irishman, who Sherlock could have sworn left the room prior.
Even with everything against him, he found his one regret to be something he had never – and would never – openly admitted. Something he had not even admitted to himself until it became too late.
Lestrade looked at him, as though studying him. His mind was clearly at work, seeming to want to say something and trying to figure out how to go about it. The silence had John raising his brows, wanting the detective inspector to speak what he concluded. At the reaction, Lestrade sighed and ran his hand through his hair.
Though he knew that Mycroft would never risk security, the back of his mind begged to release the unfamiliar emotion at the presented datum.
“Meaning we’re looking for evidence of a secondary vehicle?” Lestrade confirmed with an audible noise. “Have they found another set of marks, then?”
“We managed to break into Hargett’s mobile.” The response was enough the garner Sherlock’s attention. “Apparently their ring runs deeper than we thought. Even some more…authoritative entities were involved.”
Once again, he found himself in his brother’s office.
“What is it?”
Thank you SO MUCH for the feedback! I hope you all enjoy this chapter as much as the first!
It was not as though John did not understand why he was being asked the favour, but he doubted he would have been able to keep himself in check if he were to come face-to-face with Dreln Hargett after finding Sherlock bloody, violated and not breathing. John had since seen the third video, where Dreln was near elbow deep within Sherlock’s rear. It was after witnessing that video where he lost his composure, in the only way a soldier could, beside his best friend’s unconscious body, apologizing for not finding him sooner, for walking away the other night due to something so trivial, for things that were typical banter between the two of them.
His breath hitched in his throat and a low-pitted whine escaped him.
Seeing the proud Sherlock Holmes so vulnerable, every ill-gotten thought coursed through him. They had been made aware of the abduction minutes after it had occurred, yet they still could not track Sherlock or the men who took him until the young man was put through immense physical and psychological trauma. Lestrade found himself praying Sherlock’s genius shielded him from any long-term psychological damage, though he had a sinking feeling it would only make it worse.
Donovan finally got out, “There are police already canvasing the area,” annoyed at not only having been talked over for the last few seconds, but also having a now-civilian essentially telling them how to do their jobs.
Surprisingly, it worked! (laughs)
“Be quick, won’t you?” he said, his voice breaking.
Granted, I don't know how long I'll have power, so I wanted to get this done and uploaded before the inevitable power outages hit.
Mycroft’s eyes were swimming while he aimed for a disapproving glare that failed as he had to maintain his balance by keeping a grip on the footboard. “I am not in the mood to deal with you. Get out.”
“Sherlock was with you?” he asked as if in confirmation, to which John nodded violently.
I am SO SORRY. m(__ __)m
“Clean-shaven, hair groomed with only a few hairs sticking out, shirt clean and ironed – You were preparing to meet that shop keep from last night, but she turned you down last minute. Now you’ve got a reservation for two at a restaurant you’ve been wanting to try, but no one to go with.” John sighed and, while anyone else’s interpretation would have been irritation, his was more-or-less of understanding with only a hint of annoyance, which he knew Sherlock picked up on. “How’s their tea?” Sherlock asked without prompting, causing John to chuckle.
I am SO SORRY this took so long! (bows) m(__ __)m
If Sherlock were there, he would have definitely suggested the entire area be scoured and the local buildings be searched. Yet, as he recalled the scene, he knew that had not been brought to the investigators and detectives’ attention; though it did have him question why Mycroft Holmes had not advised and required the local zone be combed. Then again, while Mycroft claimed to be more intelligent than his younger brother, in certain areas, it was clear that his little brother claimed domain.
John managed to break away from one of the guards, looking to Lestrade, who he just registered was in the room. “He was there that night – talking on the phone. He was there. He was the one who drugged, Sherlock.” Lestrade’s eyes adverted to the nurse, while Donovan’s stayed on John, brow furrowing as if judging the validity of the accusation. “He was trying to give Sherlock Rocephin.”
He moaned with each thrust, groaning in particular whenever Sherlock gagged.
After the hesitation, he finally entered the flat, shutting the door lightly behind him while he peered up the stairs, as though listening for Sherlock’s presence; whether it be the violin, loud banging, yelling or, his least favourite, gunfire. Hearing nothing, his heart dropped and shut his eyes. More times than not, he had hoped to come home to quiet after a stressful day, but now that it was, it was unnerving and he found himself regretting ever wanting it to be quiet.
Not that having nothing to occupy his time helped.
A groan escaped Sherlock’s mouth as his hair was pulled and more warm liquid filled him. His rectal cavity throbbed from the abuse, while nail marks and bite marks littered his lower and upper back. Even though he had made several attempts to escape reality while it was happening, he found his efforts failing. Each time he tried, he found himself in Mycroft’s office, being guilt-tripped for what he logically knew was not of his own culpability.
He was thrown back to the floor as the man went back to the deceased, whose neck was only held on by skin and sinew.
The statement had both officials’ demeanours change.
It was the same man he witnessed violate Sherlock in the second video.
Though he did not see it, the man smiled.
John's reaction to the video send him home, where he meets the man the video was meant for.
“Oh, um, thank you,” John sputtered, indiscreetly knocking his shoulder into Sherlock, getting the detective to force a smile to the young woman.
“Sherlock’s mobile,” he responded, forcing himself to not break eye contact. His attempt failed when the other’s expression was unchanging. “Also his coat and scarf…socks and shoes.” The information had John shut his eyes as he shook his head, while Mycroft seemed to stand straighter, if at all possible.
“The only reason you were not shocked was because I rather like that china you have in your hand.” Mycroft put his coffee down and pulled out the remote, fixing John with a deadly glare. “But know this, if you do not sit down and eat within the next ten seconds, you will be shocked and then I will tie you to the chair myself.”
John meets the Resistance and learns something new about himself, in more ways than one.
His Dom stepped in and pulled John into his chest and away from the old ladies hand.
Thanks for reading(:
“Just get it over with, please,” John begged, closing his eyes tightly, afraid to see what Sherlock was doing.
When he could feel Sherlock’s bollocks draw up, John knew what would come next. He grabbed the man’s head and tilted it to the side, preparing to strike.  “I’m gonna…I’m gonna-” Sherlock whined, stiff in John’s arms. With that, John shoved himself deep into Sherlock and bit down on the blue vein sticking up beneath the pale flesh.
“John’s back?” Mike said as he came from inside another tent.
There was a loud bang at the other end of the alley of a rubbish bin falling to the ground. John turned so quickly he almost fell down. In the bright moon light stood a tall devilish figure with a pale face and a wide grin.
Enjoy!
“You taste so good, John,” Sherlock’s voice was husky and dark. “Now, hurry up and go upstairs to change clothes. We leave in five minutes.” Without another word, John ran upstairs, taking two steps at a time. He quickly washed himself off and threw on a pair of jeans and a black and blue striped jumper. Thoughts of who he would see, what the crime scene would look like, and even where they were going flew through John’s mind rapidly. If he played his cards right, perhaps Sherlock would trust him enough to go out on his own one day. Then, he would have a head start and possibly find a way out of the city. John knew he couldn’t go to the police or any government owned places without fear that they might be working for Mycroft. No, John would have to find someone outside of the Holmes’ reach if he was going to plan a successful getaway.
Sherlock latched onto the bag, squeezing his eyes together as he sucked the red fluid into his mouth. When the last drop was gone, Sherlock sighed and slumped back on the couch. “More?” he asked John hopefully.
“Charnock Plumbing is decent from what I’ve heard,” Sherlock said, to which the man made a verbal acknowledgement. “A bit expensive, but I doubt that’d be much of a problem. All Trades London is a bit cheaper, if you’d rather.”
His hair was grabbed and pulled, dragging him down and backwards, off of the mattress. The only bit he could muster was grabbing the forearm of the one who hauled him.
“Why you’re still here.”
There was the sound of something being hit before the echoing of laughter.
“I didn’t want him involved,” Mycroft said firmly, irritably, his composure beginning to falter. “This isn’t one person with a few political ties here and there that wouldn’t pose him or us much of a threat. This group works underground, and they do whatever needs to be done to keep it that way. Going up against military or government is what they train to do; taking out partners, family members, anyone they need to get what they want.”
He saw the flash of the camera go off as the urine spilled out of him and he could no longer do it – could no longer hold himself together. His body shook, attempting to not vocalize the emotion he had suppressed for so long.
White shots of light began flashing before his eyes as the physical contact began to distance itself.
Please let me know if you enjoyed this chapter! (^ ^*)
He had to find him before that.
Within a few minutes, Sherlock was dressed to his normality, overcoat and scarf included, and he and John were out on the sidewalk, walking to the restaurant John had been so looking forward to.
“Apologies, but you’re not quite my type.”
I was working on some other fics while working on this simultaneously.
Mainly because my job will have me out of commission for a while,
There was a pause of contemplation. “Do you think so little of him?”
“We need the traffic cam footage from that night.” He folded the papers and slipped them into his back pocket.
The scents of sausage and eggs filtered through the halls and rooms the moment a trolley carrying the breakfast trays for the various patients arrived on the floor. John was talking to a nurse at the nurse’s station, trying to get information on when Sherlock would be discharged. All they would tell him was that he would have to wait for the doctor. Even with John now being listed as Sherlock’s primary physician, they refused to divulge. He tapped his fingers on the counter before sighing and dismissing himself back to the room.
“Doctor Watson,” was all she got out before John looked accusingly at the red-haired female.
No longer having to worry about causing Sherlock to have another panic attack, John returned his attention to following the news articles on the takedown. Not as much was coming out, the bulk having been the initial twenty-four hours. There was a small headline that caught his eye:
“Before I leave, do you want to hear my favourite moment with your brother?” They held eye contact, the leer on his face growing. “When we pissed in him and made him cry.”
“I don’t need help!” Sherlock snapped, the cast on his wrist catching on the trousers’ fabric. “I can do things on my own!” John felt his shoulders drop. Sherlock fought for a few more moments before getting to the point of tossing the trousers off to the side.
Movement caught his attention of a man descending the couple of steps from the front door. Their features struck a familiar chord and it took him a moment to place why. Watching the man light up a cigarette and hit it a few times, the familiarity registered.
“Is the option to obtain my nutritional needs through an intravenous needle still available?”
There was a scoff, followed by close steps and a hand on Sherlock’s left buttock. Through his slacks, fingers ran from the bass of his scrotum to his rectum, making his body tense against his will. It was followed up with the band of his pants being gripped before a hand slipped into the band, where the flesh of fingertips began running down his buttocks to his entrance. An unwillingly grunt escaped him as an index finger pressed against him before crossing his boundary. He attempted to block the foreign sensation, yet his body clenched against his will, squeezing the man’s finger.
John now sat in Sherlock’s room, his laptop open as he found himself following the reports of the Cielo Diablos’ takedown through various news sources. A cold cup of instant coffee sat on the bedside table, which he still found himself taking occasional sips from. With Lestrade handling the main investigation and Mycroft dealing with the political spectrum, John was the only one left to watch after Sherlock, waiting for him to come-to. After the situation that morning, John had not left his mate’s side. It was Donovan who had sent an officer to the flat to get John’s computer, along with a change of a clothes and toiletries. From the woman who had always made her disdain towards Sherlock more than apparent, she had made certain John would not have to leave him until the young genius was conscious.
“Right,” John drew own, his eyes falling back on Sherlock, who was turning ahead in whatever book he had buried his nose into. “And that doesn’t bother you in the least?”
What made it flare back up was going to see "Crimes of Grindlewald" two weeks ago. After writing a one-shot for that film, my writing muse sprung back to life and I was able to work on this once again.
“There’s always the catheter—”
The door led to nothing more than a room containing a desk, an old filing cabinet and a door to the left – the door which had a light glowing from underneath. Hand back on his weapon, he approached the door and reached for the handle. With one more inhale, he turned it and swung the door open.
Mycroft’s mask melted away and he jerked his head towards Lestrade, expression nothing but concern. “Take me to him. Now.” His voice was commanding and Lestrade gave no comment.
Sherlock’s mind travelled, his spine tingling.
A fact that had the younger man groan.
Meanwhile, John was reviewing what he knew: they had Sherlock in a basement near the river, but the location the sunken van was recovered did not have a building with a basement in the surrounding area. Logic dictated that his mate was held in the closest building with a sub-level, even if it was several kilometres from the dumpsite.
The expression Lestrade saw etched all over John’s face read more than words could ever give. What he read was something more than concern of a friend, of a comrade. Over the years, the only time he had ever witnessed such determination in both vocals and body language were those who deeply cared for the victim – those who loved—
A sharp pang shot to his chest at the thought, realizing that those times of normality may have very well come to an end.
Pictures of dismembered bodies filled the screen as John scrolled down, reading the methods of torture and mutilations the cartel was apparently known for. “Jesus,” was the only thing he could get out as he ran his hand through his hair, staring at the various photos.
Another long pause.
I've been gone on a job for weeks, which made it impossible for me to actually sit down and work on this.
“Rather you didn’t,” came the response, his eyes quickly darting down to a bulge in the man’s jeans.
Lestrade had made an appearance a few times since Sherlock was conscious, something the young genius was sure to point out. While the first encounter was tense and awkward – Sherlock remaining silent while Lestrade fell into a slew of apologies for not locating him sooner, ending with an embrace that Sherlock awkwardly accepted and returned – the following visits were filled with Sherlock asking the detective inspector questions about the group, what they had found out and if they were certain there were no loose ends. Not wanting to divulge sensitive information, he was only told the basics that John had been privy to, much to Sherlock’s aggravation. Though he acted like Lestrade’s check-ins were annoying, it was still clear he was thankful he cared enough to even stop by.
“I’ve offered to release the Cielo Diablos members currently in our custody, travel, money, immunity – everything.” His gaze finally met John’s, whose were filling slowly with understanding.
Confusion was the first emotion to grow across Sherlock’s features. He drew his gaze to where John’s hand rested on his own, uncertain as to why. Even still, his eyes were distant, thinking.
Sherlock’s jaw tensed before he glanced from John to his crutch against the table. Though he did not take his hand back, the conversation was quickly ended with;
“C’mon, Sherlock,” he said in a moan, pressing the head of his penis against Sherlock’s lips. “Use that pretty mouth again.”
He shrugged while Mycroft groaned.
The animosity John had been feeling towards Mycroft dwindled, regret seeping into his chest at his outbursts and belief that Sherlock’s own brother cared naught of his own blood. The way Mycroft spoke, it was beginning to become clear that the government official had been negotiating for his brother’s safe return the moment he was made aware of the abduction. His flippant demeanour had started to make sense. Probabilities were that he had been making the group proposals that had not been – and would not have been – approved; propositions that could have had him incarcerated if they had been found out or accepted.
He pulled his arm back and out, Sherlock’s body making a popping sound as the foreign object was extracted. With his upper body on the mattress and his buttocks in the air, Sherlock buried his face into the dirty mattress, hoping he could escape back to his haven. Pain continued to shoot down his right shoulder through his back, while his rectum and abdomen throbbed. With his vision hidden in the darkness, he failed to see the flash of a mobile phone. Shortly after, his hair was grabbed and he was forced to lift his head from the mattress.
“C’mon, Sherlock,” the man said as he wrapped his free arm around Sherlock’s hips as he leaned close to his ear. “Scream for me,” he whispered as he pushed in further. Sherlock’s face contorted in pain, veins straining against his neck as he willed everything in his being to refrain from releasing the build-up in his throat. When he failed to get what he wanted, the American began hastily pumping his hand in-and-out.
“Ah, right,” the eldest Holmes said with a nonchalant expression. Moving back to the laptop, he switched to a tab that he must have had loaded before John’s arrival. A bolded headline came up reading
“We’ve got a pulse.”
about an impending threat, he would have been on guard of any suspicious activities or persons.
“Have you found anything else?” John asked Lestrade, breaking the tension.
It broke upon impact, sending splintering wood in every which direction.
