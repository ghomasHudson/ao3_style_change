Although she had never had the largest amount of grace to her, she still had some dignity. The odds of this remaining intact dwindled as she allowed herself to stare at John for a moment. His skin was tanned from sun exposure, and he’d grown a few more inches.
Sherlock yelped again when another splash of water hit him square in the face. A few attacks later, and Sherlock was beside himself with laughter while John just watched him with an amused smirk on his face.
“A very special shop where we’re gonna buy clothes that make you feel sexy, and John cum in his pants.”
“What the fuck do you think you’re playing at?!” I snap as I close the door to the storage cupboard.
When I run my mouth, though they are astounded, people tell me I’m weird, or that I’m a freak, but not John.
I’ve been drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the night, but now I am most defiantly awake, certain parts of me more than others...
He should have been happy, but he was anything but. This was not a good thing. His dad wasn’t exactly a bad man, he was just very different to John. They had nothing in common, and didn’t have the best connection.
Freak. That’s what he was. Sherlock felt another sobbing fit coming on, but he held back his tears. “An asshole.”
He forced himself not to laugh, not really caring to explain his thoughts to John. He’d much rather keep up the charade that his thoughts were entirely concerned with chemistry, maths, John, poisons, and tobacco.
I falter for a moment, wondering what to say next. That’s when I realise how new this all is to him. The way he talks, the way people talk to and about him, and of course the record of times he’s been admitted to medical. (I may have checked his records after I walked him back to his cube.) As he sits in front of me, staring up at me intently, I wonder if he’s ever had a friend, or if he’s spent his years alone.
John chewed the inside of his cheek again for the umpteenth time, the skin probably raw by now, and shook his head.
“Not really a fair comparison is it? Nympho over here has no standards.” Rosie said, the time she found Irene tying a girl to a table in mind.
He lifted Sherlock up on to the counter, and positioned himself between the brunette’s long legs. Sherlock felt pleasure coursing through him as he felt john’s thick erection poking at him through both their jeans. John massaged Sherlock’s tongue with his own, drawing low moans from the other boy, fuelling arousal in both of them. Sherlock ran his fingers down johns back, and fisted his shirt in to his hand, lightly raking his bare back with his nails.
When John put the phone down, he felt his heart sink when he remembered he still didn’t get to tell her he loved her.
John positioned himself at Sherlock’s entrance, hands gripping his waist, bunching the skirt up. Sherlock was relaxed and ready for him, so he thrust in with very little hesitation. Sherlock let out a small yelp, but it quickly turned in to a moan after the initial shock.
After cleaning up, John scooped Sherlock into his arms, and gently placed him under the sheets and amongst the pillows.
Sherlock pouted, and let out a frustrated whine. John quickly grabbed the bottles of whipped cream and chocolate sauce along with the box of strawberries.
She giggled on the other end. Sherlock’s laughter was the single best sound he had ever heard, and her smile the best thing he’d ever seen.
He desperately tried to avoid flinching when her hand come in contact with the bite mark, then his intentions changed to keeping the grin off his face as his thoughts circulated back to last night for the umpteenth time.
She gasped out a moan, and threw her head back. He continued his descent down her torso, sucking on her pulse point, nipping softly at her collar bone, slipping his tongue between her cleavage.
“Yes, mummy. Fine.” He rambled, feeling the need to cover himself with his sheets despite the fact that there was a locked door between them. He hoped she hadn’t heard him crying out. There would simply be no denying what had happened. He showered quickly, then dressed, and ran down the stairs.
“Not you, don’t worry. I have a lecture. I was meant to be there... three minutes ago... shit. Ok, I’ve gotta go, but come to my room later? We can see about a third kiss.” John grinned.
He blinked a few times as he took in the marvellous view of Sherlock, kitten ears and all; perched, ready to pounce.
“He’s my chemistry lab partner.” John said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable that the sinister, older teen had been watching them.
Her nanny, Mrs Hudson appeared at the playroom door, and held out her hand for Sherlock to go with her. She liked Mrs Hudson, so she was happy to oblige, and followed her into the kitchen. Mrs Holmes was bent over by the oven taking a pie out, which she then placed on a counter she knew Sherlock couldn’t reach.
“You mean to say he doesn’t normally?” John grinned, lightly nudging the boy in question. Mrs Holmes smiled broadly as she looked between both boys.
They entered the sitting room, which was a large room with photographs and portraits decorating the walls and shelves, a few statues on the mantle piece, and three vases of flowers. Sherlock was intrigued by the photographs, and went over to look at each of them. She was particularly drawn to a picture of a blonde boy, maybe six years old, with a big grin, showing where he’d lost one of his front teeth.
“My god, earlier...” His lips move down to nip at my neck. “When I was making love to you... you’ve never looked more stunning.”
Merry Christmas. This is your third at the front. I can only pray you’ll be home for the next. I’ll try and telephone you later. I miss the sound of your voice.
Sherlock sucked his cheeks in between his teeth in a manner that rather made him look like a fish as he raised his hips again to allow John to push another pillow underneath him.
pulled his jeans down to his ankles. John chewed his lip between his teeth as he saw sherlock’s new panties revealed to him in full. They were dark; ebony against Sherlock’s ivory skin.
John furrowed his brows, then looked back at the other boy. He was regarding the blond with a nervous disposition, awkwardly shuffling his feet.
Sherlock experimentally opened her mouth, opening Johns with it, and slipped her tongue passed his lips. He moaned softly.
When the second orgasm hit, it distracted him for a moment, the image of John pounding in to him spurring him on, but when he came back down from his high, panic set in again. He could be stuck for hours before john came home, and the whole time, he’d have to sit with a never ending buzzing plug between his legs.
“I thought that this might spice up our relatively boring day. We can’t have sex, so...” John shrugged with a chuckle. “I thought I’d amuse myself by keeping this on my person for a few hours.”
“I love starting the morning with a blow job.” He panted, reaching out to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. He giggled, and bumped his head up against johns.
Sherlock felt himself hardening again as he stared down at John’s ‘impressive equipment’, beads of pre-cum leaking from the tip.
Sherlock had been woken up an hour ago with stomach cramps, or what she thought were stomach cramps.
Both boys could have done with more sleep, but got up, and went downstairs regardless. Mrs Holmes wasn’t in the kitchen, presumably sleeping till a more reasonable hour. The tired teenagers sat down at the bar stools by the table, and rested their heads on their elbows. They were drifting off when Mrs Holmes came downstairs.
Sherlock’s bed as he tried to sort out the fastening on his trousers. Sherlock came back a few minutes later in a fresh pair of clothes.
Sherlock used his free hand to pass his mother the coffee jug, and slid his other hand further up John’s leg. Mr Holmes engaged Mycroft in a conversation, and Irene got up to go to the bathroom. This left Mrs Holmes to talk to John and Sherlock.
“No, no.” He says quickly, his voice raspy and chocked up. “I don’t... I don’t know why I’m crying.”
We eventually go our separate ways down the corridor, me to the cafeteria and him to the common room.
Sherlock barely had time to blink before John had crossed the room, and pushed him down on the bed. John was kissing him with fiery passion, lips, tongue, teeth.
“Can we change positions?” He rumbles, his voice practically a growl that causes me to start weeping.
“How would it make you feel if they saw me with my hands in your trousers... getting you off?” Johns voice lapped at his ear, his lips ghosted his neck, and his teeth grazed his skin.
Sherlock jumped up from the bed, and reached across John to uncover his laptop from a stack of papers.
He moved his mouth up and down thrice more before Sherlock was coming with a loud sob and a cry of his name.
Sherlock undid the buttons of John’s shirt with haste, and pulled it down his arms before blindly throwing it behind her.
It’s so intense that I have to rely on his sturdy build to hold my weight up, my motor skills completely failing me.
He loved being filled, Johns length stretching his walls. John was balls deep inside him now, their bodies flush together.
The ear splitting grin that appears on his face stirs up something inside me... something primal that probably promotes my next words.
When I’m a few inches away from him, he spins around, and hits my in the shoulder with the end of the rake.
“Oh that’s sweet. We’ll have to arrange to see them some time. Sherlock, pass me the coffee please darling.”
“There is a girl in your room, your hair is mused, your shirt is buttoned wrong, and your neck is covered with hickeys.” Sherlock inhaled sharply. “Need I go on.”
Sherlock is lying beneath me, his hands gripping my arms as I push my finger in and out of his tight, virgin hole. He’s not as relaxed as I’d like him to be, but he doesn’t seem unhappy. I ask him anyway, and he assures me with a nod and the invitation of a kiss.
I am urged to remember a stunt my brother pulled where he used surveillance technology to track my every move after I left the lab I had been using.
“Oh, the adrenaline rush is a wondrous being, isn’t she?” Sherlock grinned, spinning around the living room.
Sherlock panted heavily, wriggling as John pulled his fingers out. He settled between Sherlock’s legs after sorting out a condom. He sat for a moment to allow his eyes to wonder Sherlock’s face. His head clouded with arousal as he drank in the sight of him. His skin was glistening with saliva, on his neck, his cheeks, flushed pink, eyes desperate and needy.
John was humming along to the lyrics as they danced, bobbing his head in time. He’d been holding both of Sherlock’s hands but he’d brought them down to rest on Sherlock’s hips, swaying them to the music. Sherlock giggled, not resisting in the slightest, putty in John’s hands. The last chorus ended, and John dipped Sherlock backwards like at the end of the tango. Sherlock was giggling when John brought him back up, and pressed a rather enthusiastic kiss to his lips. They fell on to Sherlock’s bed in a fit of laughter, Sherlock sprawled out on John’s chest.
“No fair. You’re hotter than me as a boy and a girl.” Molly chuckled, reaching out to stroke Sherlock’s arm.
I want to feel his hands in my hair, his skin on my skin, his lips on my lips... his erection rubbing between my legs...
Rosie turned her head so her cheek was pressed to the floor as Irene came in. She was dressed, hair brushed, fresh make up on her face. Rosie on the other hand had hair like a rats nest, and last nights makeup ringed round her eyes like a raccoon.
“Yes, it’s just... it’s all very real. I’m excited about it, though.” He says, reaching forward to grip my hand. “Just a little anxious.”
“John, I wish I didn’t have to use my little fingers *gasp* I wish it was your huge cock inside me- ah!”
They’re not as soft this time, but they have the unique, palatial blend of mint, tea, and shortbread that I’ve come to associate with John.
Mrs Holmes may not have known the exact nature of the relationship that existed between the pair, but she knew it was one that included interactions that would rather go unseen.
“No, I think I’ll make you ride me. I want your tight little ass bouncing up and down on my cock while I just lie here letting you do all the work.”
He still doesn’t say anything, but he wriggles closer stretches his legs out to tangle them with mine.
His expression evolved in to one of fear and alarm after a moment, so John chose to put his acerbic tone down to that.
“This ok?” John asked through gritted teeth, holding back a moan at the new feeling surrounding his cock.
“I came prepared this time. Tissues and wet wipes.” He chuckles as he presents the items from his pocket.
Sherlock blew John a cheeky kiss before slipping away into the bathroom, leaving John alone with his thoughts. This was amazing; being with Sherlock was amazing. Why did he allow himself to talk himself out of his feelings, why did he deny that he liked him for so long? He’d never been so happy. Sherlock made him happy. These were some of the thoughts that ran through his head as he waited, alone in Sherlock’s room. That was when he heard keys in the door, and two voices. One was unmistakably Mycroft’s. And the other was a girl.
John practically dragged Sherlock out of the cafe, and down the street where upon they stopped outside a very familiar shop.
John turned his head to catch Sherlock’s lips in a kiss. Said boy squeaked in surprise, they happily opened his mouth when John slipped his tongue passed his lips. He stepped in between John’s leg, rubbing his knee up against his groin.
Sherlock nodded, and ran out into the hallway where he spotted the phone on top of a cabinet. He called for an ambulance, then went back into Harry’s room.
As I’ve come to understand, people in a relationship tell one another things about not only their day to day lives, but of the experiences they have encountered, both wonderful and tragic.
He tightens his grip on my hips, and pulls me to him at such an angle that my erection brushes up against his.
The announcement that war had broken out was on every radio channel in the country. Everyone, Sherlock included, was fully aware of what was going on by now. She was too caught up listening to what her parents were saying that she failed to consider one major consequence. She’d finally managed to fall asleep after hours of pacing her room, only to be interrupted by something colliding with her window.
The slighter teen shivered and arched his back at the touch. John leant in to capture his lips in a kiss. He opened his mouth, opening Sherlock’s with it, and slipped his tongue past his lips. Sherlock moaned appreciatively, and moved his tongue to role over John’s. Johns tongue was warm and wet as it explored his mouth, the faint taste of blueberry evident. He groaned when John drew his bottom lip between his teeth, lightly tugging. John pulled back to kiss all down Sherlock’s neck, mouthing, sucking, biting.
At this, he pressed a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s head, hoping to wake him as even though he was right there, John found himself missing his company.
He runs his beady eyes over me, and I have to resist the urge to pull my shirt collar up to hide the hickeys I know aren’t on view.
“You want it harder?” John asked huskily, tugging at Sherlock’s earlobe with his teeth, his breath hot against Sherlock’s skin.
“There’s a cleaner here that never locks the door to his cupboards. He’s always high. Marital problems. Honestly, this school is a disaster.”
“I don’t think I’ll be able to stand...” Sherlock mused as he crawled up behind John, wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck and nipping at his ear lobe.
The figure had a deep, mellifluous voice, one that sent shivers down John’s spine. He, cos it was definitely a man, slipped out from the shadows. He was tall, much taller than John, (although most people were.) with wavy, sandy brown hair, a dark stare, and a sharp nose. He was dressed in the same school uniform as John, but was a few years older, and was holding a black umbrella. He looked positively terrifying.
“About what happened after.” He said, not looking up. “Look, Sherlock, I meant it when I said I wasn’t gay.”
“Well, well, well. Did someone need a little  extra discipline?” She chortles as her reptilian like eyes scan the scene before her.
“It’s getting better.” He said honestly, moving his hips a little from where he was pinned underneath the other boy’s weight.
They both turned their heads to see Irene and molly stood in the door way. Irene had a massive parcel in her hands, and molly was holding about a thousand books.
“I know... wait, how did you know I have Chemistry? Have you looked at my schedule or something?” John teased.
My breathing is heavily laboured, restricting my ability to speak coherently, so instead I go with the symbolic ‘thumbs up’ gesture that seems to reassure him.
Thankfully she didn’t say anymore on the matter and instead brought her teacup to her lips, only to instantly recoil when the cold liquid filled her mouth.
John was still in between Sherlock’s legs knelt up at such an angle that he was resting his chest on the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, the other boy’s legs still draped over his shoulders.
John’s eyes roll back in his head as I reach my arms up to allow my thin, nimble fingers to tug lightly at his soft hair.
John dropped down beside him to take a look at Sherlock’s restraints. His hands were cuffed together, and another set of handcuffs were linked round the chain, and cuffed to the bed post.
“That’ll Be dinner. I’ll go open the door, and you know, get the food... for us to eat.” John muttered, slipping past Sherlock to open the door.
Sherlock couldn’t fathom how much this hurt. It felt as though her insides were stabbing themselves with knives.
“Take this to the post office. Please.” She held the letter out to Mycroft, who graciously took it from her.
Sherlock and John come to the realisation that the latter may not be home for the arrival of their child.
Harriet was leant against her door frame wrapped in a dressing gown, clearly having just awoken up herself. John looked down and saw that he was indeed shirtless. It was a fact Sherlock would probably appreciate, but maybe not the rest of the town.
Said boy let out a loud cry at the feeling of being filled before reaching his own end, and ejaculating all over his stomach.
Almost anyone, perhaps with the exception of Sherlock herself, would have been a better comfort to John.
He clears his throat, and corrects his posture before handing the book over, gently brushing my fingers in the process. It’s not like how they describe it in the books. It’s not electric, it doesn’t make my heart skip a beat, the Earth doesn’t stop, but it’s something. Something.
Sherlock reached down, and grasped at Johns hair, pulling at the roots, emitting low groans form the blond.
“Sherlock!” Mrs Holmes snapped. “Not at the dinner table.” She instructed, thwacking the younger boy with a tea towel as gently as one can thwack someone. “Swear at him all you like later.”
John looked straight at her then, unconvinced. Anyone could see the fear in his eyes, and it just broke her.
I wish I was able to keep my eyes open, but with my hyperactive brain desperately trying to focus, my eyes close in an attempt to not get distracted by the other sensory events going on around me.
“Yes.” He practically pleaded. “Yes, I’ve been bad... I...Mmmm... john...” Sherlock whined, arching his back as John dragged his tongue down his lean body.
“Hey, ummm... I was wondering...” John started. “If you wanted to come to my game this Friday. It’s a big one.”
Sherlock watched with a dazed expression as John dipped his head, and began pressing kisses down his body. He arched his back as Johns tongue swiped across his skin, moans tumbling from his mouth, pleasure gripping him.
Sherlock remained quiet for a moment, which lead John to believe he had offended him. John began drafting an apology when Sherlock answered.
I can just about make out his ‘rabbit in the headlights’ expression through his dark curls as he hangs his head.
“Lucy, put that down!” She called to the toddler currently attempting to lift one of the patio chairs.
Hi guys! I’m really enjoying writing this, and I’m so happy people seem to be enjoying it. Only a few more chapters until John and Sherlock get together, so stayed tune. ;) also, I’ve just written another Sherlock fan fiction, a teenlock slow burn with loads of smut... go check it out!
He looks up at me with his icy, feline eyes, as if he’s staring right in to my soul. I’ve noted that this is what he does when he’s ‘deducing’ people. It’s a little unnerving, but it’s also extremely hot.
With some amount of difficulty, John managed to turn the vibrator off, and pull it out with a small whimper.
Fuck, when this is over, work will be a brief moment, interlude even, where I have to be away from him.
Mycroft took the doctor up to Sherlock. She didn’t move when they came in, just as Mycroft expected. The doctor took her temperature, took a blood test, and listened to her heart.
“I’m not dreaming, am I?” He asked groggily, his eyes going to the shoulder he’d been using as a pillow.
Sherlock hadn’t seen John for a few days, and was beginning to get worried. Everyone else seemed worried and tense, but for very different reasons. There had been rumours that the country was on the verge of war for a few weeks now, and by this point it seemed almost inevitable. Sherlock was fairly oblivious to it all as her mother had ushered her out of the room  anytime someone brought it up during house parties, and always turned the radio down during broadcasts.
He helped Sherlock off the bed, and pushed him into a kneeling position, his wrists still tied behind his back.
“Alright, lets do something else.” John said after having chased Sherlock’s king round the board for 10 minutes.
Sherlock reaches over to grab his hand. It wasn’t spasming. Initially she’d believed it was a form of PTSD, but then she’d noticed that when he was stressed, like in moments such as this one, it stopped.
“And sex with you is less dangerous. And far better.” Sherlock added when he saw a playful glare forming on johns face.
He flashed him his signature boyish grin, then turned on his heel, and left. He wandered down to his biology class, which he actually enjoyed, although he couldn’t stand his teacher. Mr Mitchell was a stuck up prick, who was always desperate to catch Sherlock out. So far, every attempt had been a fail. Sherlock quickly walked to the classroom, not a challenge on his long legs, and slumped down in a chair in the second row by the window. His usual logistics for where to sit to avoid getting called on thrown out the window, as he knew Mitchell would find him wherever he sat. The only way he could go undetected was if he threw himself out the window, and ran home. He also knew his stuff when it came to biology, and any opportunity to show other people that was one he grasped with both hands. He ignored the snide comments other children exchanged as he walked the halls. That’s what he’d always done. Other children filtered into the room, including his lab partner, Molly Hooper. Molly was a bouncy girl with light brown hair, hazel eyes, a pale complexion, and a gigantic crush on Sherlock, which she was terrible at hiding.
He’d been vulnerable because he trusted John, he’d been emotional because he loved John, and all of that was reminded to him with merely the sight of the blond in his denim jacket on the other side of the lobby.
“He rubbed some people up the wrong way, and he was told to ‘do some time in prison’, who needed some staff... or go on proper sabbatical. He picked prison. Anyway, he’s back now. He reckons I should go in to the police.”
Sherlock’s whole body spasmed as copious amounts of fluid spurted from the end of his cock, then he fell back on to John’s chest, completely spent.
He retaliated in a fit of giggles, turning around in the tub, and splashing John with a large amount of soapy water.
Sherlock stammered out a moan. He trembled in his shoes as John made a start on pulling down his jeans.
Sherlock was careful to push his body flush against John, rubbing against his legs, his cock, his stomach and his chest as he stood back up.
Mrs Holmes turned to regard her eldest son, who had since moved off the doorframe and was hovering by the fruit bowl.
John pressed his lips up against Sherlock’s as he pushed inside of him. They both moaned loudly, and Sherlock’s nails dug into John’s muscular back.
John looked up the flight of stairs before wandering up them. There was a closed door, like a front door, at the top of the stairs. John pushed it open slowly. It was a decent sized room with a desk, a chair, and a sofa, which was currently occupied by Sherlock. He was sprawled out on the leather, his hands clasped in front of his face.
I whip my head around, expecting to see Sherlock on the floor, but instead, I see him throwing a punch Moriarty’s way. He misses, and instead gets a sucker punch to the gut.
I have ruined so many bedsheets by now. My laundry is getting ridiculous, and I’m pretty sure my search engine wants to drown itself in bleach.
You can find whatever you want down in max, so provided you make some promises, you can get those who come down to clean SHU to give you things.
Neither of them were sure when it happened, but the couple had found themselves on the dance floor, bopping away to Beyoncé.
He groans, and bucks his hips up, rubbing his erection between my legs in a way that causes the most pleasurable friction. I can’t help but gasp out a moan, my cheeks immediately flushing when the noise hits my ears.
John took both her hands in his, and began to dance. They frolicked around the floor with the other pairs, laughter filling the room.
Sherlock giggled and wrapped his arms around johns neck as they reconnected their kiss. John placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips, pulling him closer, forcing their bodies flush together. John’s tongue tracing sherlock’s lips made him moan low in his throat, and his hips buck forwards.
She broke in to a run and retreated as fast as she could towards the tree line at the end of the garden.
He grinned when he saw Sherlock shiver. They all turned their attention to Mr and Mrs Holmes as they came back to the table. They all thanked them for brunch, then went outside.
“Mrs Watson, I need you to look at me.” Sherlock said as softly as he could. “John is taking care of Harry, and an ambulance is going to be here any minute. She’s going to be ok. I promise you. Neither of us is going to let anything happen. She may be unconscious, but you need to be strong for her. You need to be strong for John.”
Currently, my legs are between his, one of my hands is lost in his dark tresses, and my other hand is joined with his, resting on his hip, our fingers are laced.
She grabbed her things, and raced out to her bike before anyone could stop her. Lily let her in, and took her through to John who was in the kitchen.
Sherlock woke the next morning feeling very uncomfortable. His trousers were wet, and sticky. He lifted his covers and pyjama bottoms to see copious amounts of creamy, sticky fluid. A blush spread to his cheeks as he realised what had happened. He’d had a wet dream about John. He sat in silence for a moment in confusion. He’d never even had a wet dream before, never mind about the boy he considered his best, Well, only friend. He awkwardly shuffled to the bathroom, preying that neither of his parents or Mycroft would choose this moment to leave their rooms. He stood in the shower just letting the water wash over him as his thoughts ran wild. There was no doubt that he had feelings for John, he couldn’t deny that any longer. He didn’t like to feel things. He cleansed his body of the drying fluid that covered his thighs and abdomen, then scuttled back to his room wrapped in a towel warmed by the radiator. He got dressed, then stared at himself in the mirror to give himself a pep talk. Be normal. Be normal. This was essential if he ever wanted to be invited back to john’s house. He tried to put the situation he’d found himself in that morning out of his head, along with the dream that put him there. He also decided he wasn’t going to wonder about the relationship that may or may not be forming between John and Rachel, or whatever her name was. He was very good at distancing himself from his feelings. He got on with his day regardless. He’d sauntered down the stairs, made himself some tea and cereal, told Mycroft to fuck off when he asked if Sherlock was planning on taking John out on a date, and managed to escape the house before his mother could fuss over him. He arrived at school before John, who showed up some ten minutes later, his hair unkempt, and bags under his eyes. Clearly he’d over slept. Again. Sherlock quickly deduced he’d been left to his own devices, and his mother had gone out. His clothes hadn’t been ironed, and he’d heard about how johns mother had once ironed his shoelaces. There is now way she’d let him out like that, never mind oversleep.
The brunette raised his head, and a smile broke on to his face. He ran over to John, and halted in his path before he ran into him.
Even though we are now both giggling, it’s still incredibly hot. My legs are wrapped around his waist, his hands are in my hair and his pelvis is pressed right up against mine. I can feel something hard poking in to my thigh and it makes my cheeks flare up.
Their eyes met in an intense stare. They were both breathing heavily, lips bruised, and wet, hearts pounding. John could only hold his gaze for a moment before he crashed their lips together again.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, you gott- fuck- Gotta stop...” John panted as he grazed his entrance with the lubed up tip.
By the time his train pulled in, Sherlock thought she was going to faint, her heart was beating so fast.
They lay like that for a moment, basking in the after glow, chests heaving, hearts pounding, bodies gleaming with sweat, their skin sticking together.
Sherlock aimlessly lobbed them at her over his shoulder, followed by an apology when they collided with her head.
He bit back a low moan as he worked his wrist up and down, his head dropping back against the door. He didn’t need Sherlock to know his plan was working, so keeping quiet was a necessity.
It was that moment that Mrs Holmes caught Sherlock watching John with a sort of love sick expression. She had suspicions about the pairs’ blossoming friendship, but had nothing to confirm these queries other than their extreme fondness for one another. As she left the room, she could only pray that John would return Sherlock’s affections. The inconsolable mess he would turn into otherwise didn’t bare thinking about.
I have to get back to work before anyone notices I’m gone. I also have to make sure no one comes down this corridor. God forbid anyone notices he’s missing.
John raced up the stairs where Sherlock lost sight of him. John ran into Harry’s room, where he saw his mother knelt on the floor, cradling Harry’s head in her lap.
“Happy new year my darlings.” A very drunk Harriet kissed both children on the cheek, the feint smell of the vodka she’d been discreetly sipping at all night lingering after she walked away. Other people gravitated towards them to wish them a happy New Years, then stumbled away in their drunken sweep. They found their way back to each other at the end of the night when they were to say goodbye to one another.
The ambulance arrived a minute or two later, and paramedics were sent up to get Harry. Mrs Watson went in the ambulance, and the two boys were escorted in a paramedic car that followed behind. The staff suggested Sherlock went home, but he’d insisted on going too. John looked relieved at this, and clearly appreciated the act. They’d been sat in a waiting room for nearly an hour. John hadn’t said anything since they’d got there. Mrs Watson had been taken aside by the hospital staff in an attempt to treat her shock, then taken to wherever Harry was. Sherlock wasn’t sure how he was meant to help, but he knew if he didn’t say anything, he couldn’t make things any worse.
“Well, only because you asked so nicely...” I purr before digging my nails in to the sofa and driving in to him with abandon.
He’s since dropped his gaze to the floor, but looks up again at that. He looks somewhere between flattered and confused.
John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s neck, mouthing and biting at pre existing hickeys. He dipped his head further, and trailed kisses along the smooth skin exposed where Sherlock’s crop top cut off.
They all shared greetings, except Sherlock, who was opposed to meeting new people, as she’d stated many times.
“Jesse Christ- oh god- fucking hell... John!” Sherlock cried as he buried his entire fist inside himself.
They both broke free of their trance, and quickly jumped up from the bed. John trailed behind Sherlock into the kitchen where Sherlock’s mother stood taking a pizza from the oven. They washed their hands, then happily sat down to eat.
Mycroft was sat in one of the lawn chairs on the patio, a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits on the table beside her.
“John- mngh...” I grunt as earth shattering waves of pleasure rush over me, setting my whole body alight with endorphin induced bliss.
In his thrawls of pleausre, Sherlock forgot about the key next to him on the bed. He would have had enough leeway from the cuffs to unlock himself, as he was, after all, a man of many talents, but that plan had gone out the window as soon as he thought of John, and the key had gone sailing to the floor. After coming down from his climax, he made the discovery, and subsequently the deduction that he was now stuck.
I hardly slept last night, but after another necessary masturbation session, I eventually managed to get some sleep.
“Oh. I... I suppose I’ll go home and deal with the drudgery of my parents, although compared to this place it’ll be like live at the Apollo...”
He smirks as he reaches behind my head for my vest, which he balls up and gently pushes in to my mouth.
He peers through the glass window in the door and out in to the hallway before nodding to me that it’s safe for us both to leave.
“Don’t mock me with cruel the temptation of screaming when I must remain silent...” I groan, dragging my nails down his back, not to hurt him, but to force him to suffer the silence also.
I managed to find Sherlock yesterday evening just before I left and went over the details of the plan.
His hands on my hips feel like being wrapped in the most revitalising embrace in a warm blanket, his palpitating heart beating against not only his chest but mine too from where our bodies are pressed together.
“This is what she always does! Always gets herself in a state, and looks so pitiful you can’t tell her off! She gets away with everything!” John shouted, thumping his fist against a wall, then recoiling and wincing from the pain. Sherlock followed him out into a green, where his outburst would be less disruptive.
With the discovery of the abandoned break room, our precious, stolen moments become a lot more frequent in their occurrence. Of course they’re still rushed, but it’s worth it.
John had stroked himself through three orgasms that night, the memories of the day fresh in his mind. He hadn’t wanted to get out of bed, but school wouldn’t wait for him. The reminder that he would see Sherlock was what finally woke him up. He rolled out of bed, and groggily set about getting ready. He left the house before his mother, or Harriet was back at home, could notice. He spotted Sherlock walking towards the school gates in front of him, head down, lost in thought.
He obeyed, and settled on the bed. He trembled where he sat as John walked over to him, his intense, steely gaze making his cock ache.
“I’m sorry daddy! I had to! You make me so- ah- so horny!” Sherlock sobbed, desperately rutting against the mattress.
John worked at Sherlock’s skin with his teeth, his lips, his tongue, leaving wet marks of slick saliva as he moved his mouth. Sherlock went to turn around, but John put his hand on the back of his head, keeping him still.
“Here...” the blond murmured as he pulled the other teen in for a kiss, carving his lips with his tongue.
“Please... fuck me... John...” He panted as he watched the blond deliberately miss his throbbing erection, and move to lick his upper thighs.
Transfixed on the other adolescent in his lap, John had failed to notice the drop in temperature. He pulled back and frowned.
Sherlock stood up, and hungrily pressed his lips to Johns. John didn’t care anymore that he could taste himself on Sherlock’s lips, and opened his mouth regardless when Sherlock’s tongue swiped across his lips.
He knew Sherlock was orgasming when he screwed his eyes shut, and howled out Johns name. John watched with hooded eyes as the brunette ejaculated all over himself, semen covering his legs and stomach. John felt shockwaves of pleasure, his muscles spasming, his cock pulsing as he followed. His eyes closed as he emptied his load with a low groan before collapsing on to Sherlock’s cum stained chest.
Sherlock smirked devilishly before pulling John to her again by his shirt collar. The couple left hand in hand, running, well, hobbling in Johns case, down the road in a fit of giggles.
It was summer, so she was wearing her coolest clothes, including a light blue blouse, and a grey skirt. She was making the most of the fact that she could still wear socks. She’d have to trade them for stockings in a few years, just as she had seen Mycroft do. They arrived in town after a short walk, and tram ride.
Sound, lights, people, it all came back at once. Sherlock’s eyes snapped open as he left his mind palace. John was stood before him, and was thrusting a phone, his phone, at him.
“I’ll just text my mum. We can swing by there later so I can grab some things. I’m not wearing your pyjamas again. I looked like an absolute prat.” John grinned as he typed away on his phone.
It wasn’t the most comfortable of ways to sit, Sherlock sat sideways with his back against the arm rest, John knelt on his chair, settled between Sherlock’s legs.
I’m not sure in which context he is inflicting this description upon himself, but none the less, I reassure him he is not in the slightest.
Sherlock hesitated before tearing his eyes away, then shuffled forwards on his knees, and wrapped his lips around johns cock.
“I mean, he was here for a while and I never saw him do anything but read. Why all the hobbies now? I suppose he was occupied.” She muses.
His breath is a hot rasp by my ear, one that sends chills up my spine, and blood flooding down to my groin.
I want hard, rough sex. I want to be fucked until I can’t stand. I want to be covered in marks, I want to be sore all over. I want to know his body better than he knows his own, I want him to know my body better than I do.
“Mmmm... we should go to sleep. Getting you off really tires me out.” John stated dryly, making Sherlock turn a bright shade pink.
“Chemistry. It is what interests me most, and unlike the other subjects, I cannot obtain what I require for research without alerting the authorities... you would have thought Mycroft’s position would help me avoid them, but my brother would give them my address without prompting.” He says with a chuckle.
Sherlock never normally swore, only in their more intimate moments. For now, just having him groaning profanities at the back of his throat was enough for John, but he wanted to have him screaming them in pleasure. Sherlock had his eyes squeezed shut and his fingers tangled in johns hair as the older boy abused his neck. He locked his ankles round johns ass, pulling him close. He moved his hands from Johns hair to grab at his hoodie.
“I’m surprised you didn’t see it.” He says after a few minutes. “You are a medical student after all.”
“We’ve been keeping him topped up on water all day, you have to feed him. Unless, like the solar system... knowing how to nurse a baby is also a gap in your knowledge. It’s not a trivial thing... even Mycroft knows how.”
I can only offer him a smirk as anyone with half good eyesight would notice if I were to respond more affectionately.
He didn’t mind her too much. She was smart, kind, and probably the closest thing he had to a friend. She had a good number of friends herself who were clearly more tolerable of her bad jokes than he was. They were testing substances with iodine, which was rather dull, which left plenty of brain power for chatting. Oh goody(!)
“Ok, I have housework to do, but if you want to download a film, or something let me know. I can make you some snacks, drinks-“
A act on a whim, grab him by the hips and carry him across the room where I drop him on the counter top, mindful of the presumably out of order, forgotten toaster.
Mycroft thought Sherlock should have been annoyed enough to answer by now. She exhaled a shaky breath, then got to her feet.
John slowly began to pump his finger in and out whilst he continued to press passionate kisses on and around Sherlock’s lips.
They were sat under his desk, bursting at the seams with giggles as they drank a bottle of off limits scotch.
She tried not to sob. John didn’t need to hear her crying. He didn’t need to know that the crying extended into the night because of the heartache, the sorrow, the pain.
The words hung in the air for them both to stare at, before Sherlock tried desperately to take them back and shove them away again, John not letting her, instead grabbing on to them and pulling them towards him.
Sherlock looked up at him with sultry eyes, and took John’s fingers in to his mouth. John couldn’t help the strangled groan that left his throat as he watched Sherlock take his fingers further into his mouth. When Sherlock pulled back, he let johns fingers go with a pop.
Sherlock watched John over the back of the sofa as he got their drinks. Johns warmly tanned skin was glistening with moisture, his hair was all spiked up, and his towel was slung low on his hips. Sherlock would jump up and demand that John fuck him again if he wasn’t so tired and sore. He grinned to himself, and snuggled further in to the towel.
He stood up and went to the bathroom to get cleaned up. When he got back, Sherlock was in the doorway, bottom lip chewed between his teeth, and a look in his eyes that said:
Sherlock liked April fool’s day. It kept him occupied, entertained. It stopped him being bored. It was stupid, and childish, but he enjoyed it all the same. He’d been concocting a plan for most of the day in between classes. He had a few ideas, but nothing was certain. He still had till midday. He decided to mull things over in the shower for a bit after class, see if anything sparked is imagination. That’s when his leg hair started falling out.
Never miss my parents, never want to spend time with my brother, it never bothered me that I didn’t have friends, it just wasn’t something I concerned myself with.
Shelrock gets punished for his behaviour at brunch. He should have known it would come back to bite him in the ass.
“God, you’re so beautiful.” John repeats, his voice breathless and husky, and fuck, it goes straight to my cock.
I just want to be able to put protective shields up around him and keep him safe. But I can’t. Not whilst he’s still in here.
As I go through inspection, I can only be grateful that if the guard notices how red and sore my rim is, he doesn’t say anything.
He successfully managed to avoid John for most of the day, spending his time with Molly and Mike instead. Unfortunately, he couldn’t avoid him forever. He saw John in the courtyard, and thought he’d managed to get by unseen. But John has spotted him, and trailed after him.
He looked down at the blanket, then turned to look at Sherlock. He reached out to stroke her cheek, which was adorn with fresh tears. She closed her eyes, and lent into his touch.
“How do you know- ok, never mind. You know everything. Ok, not everything.” He adds when I open my mouth to contradict him.
Sherlock enveloped the head of Johns cock slowly, running the flat of his tongue along the underside, being mindful of his teeth.
I haven’t smoked since my army days, but there’s a very real chance Sherlock will get home before me and might start making his own jelly.
He snapped out of his daze, and looked up at her with his gunmetal blue eyes, tears brimming in them.
It’s too risky to go back to our break room. We got lucky with Irene. Someone else might have caused a lot more pain than a rather illegal favour... that has been dealt with and will never be spoken about again...
I lean forwards, and press a soft kiss to his nose. To my surprise, he pulls me back, and connects our lips. His tongue is soft and warm as it snakes in to my mouth, the taste of my minty toothpaste fresh on his breath.
He managed to shuffle the pillows out from underneath the brunette’s back, then  carefully manoeuvred Sherlock’s softening cock to the side so he could lie down again.
Sherlock let out a little whimper, bitting his lip in a futile attempt to silence himself. He loved the idea of having John watch him. He knew he could put on a good show. He smirked at John as he grabbed the lube from him, and poured a generous amount on to his fingers. He moved to the top of the bed, and leant up against the headboard, his legs spread wide. John shuffled down to sit at the end of the bed to get a better view. Sherlock felt a rush of both arousal and confidence as he saw John watching him with a predatory glint in his eyes, practically drooling. He moved his hand in between his legs, and closed his eyes as he began circling his inner thighs. He grinned when he heard John let out a quiet groan. He moved his fingers closer to his hole, causing his legs to jerk involuntarily. John was sure he was sure he was going to draw blood as he bit down on his lip, barely able to control himself.
John assumed that from the distant look on her face, Sherlock was unaware that she was being photographed.
I have a new plot. Sorry this took so long, I kinda ran in to a wall plot wise. Enjoy! Oh, and please comment ideas if you have any, those walls are very frequently ran in to 😆
Rustling of blankets woke Sherlock from her slumber for the first time. She didn’t pay much attention, and swiftly drifted back off. The second time, she was awoken by mumbling. She opened her eyes, and saw John tossing and turning on the sofa across from her. He went quiet again, so she fell back to sleep. Barely minutes later, she woke for the third time. This time it was screaming. She jumped from her bed, and went to johns side.
I censor myself from telling him exactly what I plan to do with them later, although surly that was his intention when he gave them to me.
“I wouldn’t be worried, sir. I assure you, I am listening. I got an A on my last assignment, which is a sure fire sign of your excellent teaching.”
It felt good, but there was still a twinging pain around his ring of muscle that was keeping him grounded.
She giggled at this, probably more than she should have done. Sherlock would have preferred if she didn’t giggle at all, but even by normal people’s standards this was too much. He decided to silence her by asking the question he knew she was waiting for.
John rolled his eyes, but put the coat on regardless. It was a short walk to Sherlock’s house, one in which he still had time to panic over all the things that could go wrong. By the time he’d got to number 59 on his list, he had arrived at the address. He hesitated for a moment before gingerly knocking on the door. A woman answered. This time, it was defiantly Sherlock’s mother. The resemblance was uncanny, except she was blonde, with softer features, unlike Sherlock with his raven locks, and sharp cheekbones.
“I didn’t want to do it... He’ll never come home now. His family will never see him again. They’ll just be sat there waiting... waiting for him to walk through the door. But he won’t.”
John looked Sherlock up and down, then settled on his eyes. Sherlock had very nice eyes. They were so pale, and piercing that John felt as though he may be able to stare into his soul. He realised he was staring, and hadn’t blinked for about 10 seconds. He compensated for this by blinking four times, then adverting his gaze to the floor.
“What did she want?” Sherlock asked before dropping back in to the leather arm chair by the fire place.
“My mother asked me to come by to tell you she’s going to telephone John this evening. She’d like to know if you wanted to talk to him.”
“We’re not animals.” John chortled choosing to ignore the evidence behind Irene’s statement, and the look of amusement on his boyfriend’s face.
"Are you coming with?" Sherlock asked, briefly disappearing behind a wall, then reappearing in the living room
Oh fuck, his lips have travelled down my chest, and he’s drawn my nipple in to his mouth, and oh god, his tongue is circling my skin, his teeth are grazing the pebbled flesh-
As John thought about this, he realised that the bedroom was fast becoming his favourite place to ‘hang out’ with Sherlock.
After a lot of questions, it had been squeezed out of Mycroft that she had met a chap at university. She’d caved after her mother’s persistent nagging, and had invited him over for tea. Of course Sherlock had guessed as soon as she came home. The smell of aftershave was unmistakable on her coat.
The rain subsided within the hour. Sherlock handed Lucy over to Mrs Hudson, then went into the kitchen to retrieve the tin. She went out to her bike, strapped the tin in her basket, and cycled off down the lane, careful to avoid the puddles.
It was a small space, shelves lining the walls, packed with cleaning products. As Sherlock closed the door, he realised how close he and John were. As of now, his back was up against johns chest, and his ass was pressed in to johns groin. He slowly turned around, trying not to knock in to the toilet rolls by his right shoulder.
“I’d tie you up now, but I didn’t bring a belt. I guess that’ll just be something nice for you to think about.”
Sherlock got up, and grabbed the jam from the counter. He sat back down with it, and went back to staring at his phone.
Sherlock loved how deeply he could feel John inside him, stretching his walls, throbbing and pulsing.
They lay like that for a good half an hour, exchanging sweet nothings, and tentative touches and kisses.
The blond gasped out a groan almost immediately, his eyes fluttering shut. On occasion, he had been known to experiment with his fingers, sometimes even a dildo similar to this one. It was a fun thing to try.  He paused his plunging motion, and opened his eyes to look over at Sherlock. He knew the brunette could take a lot more than he could. And he took it so well, too. John grinned to himself as he watched Sherlock push a third finger inside himself with a moan. As much as Sherlock wanted to watch, he was distracted by his own pleasure as he worked himself further open.
The nurse who was normally timid and quiet was shouting commands at Sherlock, her voice fierce and demanding and she screamed for her to push.
“How dare you use your fingers to get yourself off?” John snapped, cracking the whip against Sherlock’s ass.
Because of the fucked up system, I doubt anybody will question me if I say he needs to be taught a lesson.
She squeezed his hands over the soft mounds of flesh, moaning at the new sensation. She brought her hands back down after a moment, trusting him to continue his ministrations without her guidance. He was kissing her feverishly, thrusting his tongue in to her mouth, making her arch her back in pleasure.
After Sherlock had finished off her ice cream, they set off to look for the head teacher and Sherlock’s further classmates.
Sherlock felt a twinge of panic as he remembered he’d have to get John’s well endowed cock inside of him. He felt that panic change to arousal when he realised how good it was going to feel.
I think of John in his uniform, although the shirt is a little tighter, clinging to his developed muscles as I begin to pump my wrist up and down.
“It’s remote controlled... That way... I can watch you writhing in pleasure... even if it’s not me who’s touching you.”
“Baby, you need to relax. This is going to be really painful otherwise.” John murmurs, his voice strained.
She gleefully followed John up the steps to his house, and into the parlour. The maid brought them each a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits.
“What? Yes, yes I’m fine. Just... tired.” He nodded, not sure if he was trying to convince John or himself of this. The bell rang before John could ask anymore questions.
Sherlock didn’t say anything more, simply made a gesture for John to go ahead before flopping back down. John saw the yoghurt the other boy had had mentioned, but opted for a rice pudding instead. After heating it up, he went to sit with Sherlock.
They danced around the living room, Sherlock’s head on John shoulder as they moved across the floor.
He reaches for the lube, and coats his fingers in a generous amount before squirting some more around my entrance.
“Fine.” Sherlock sighed. “She seems like a nice girl, I won’t tell Mum and dad she was here, there’s left over stir fry for you in the fridge, please don’t have intercourse while I’m still in the house. Afternoon.” Sherlock quipped.
“Oh really? What were you thinking of that requires more time...?” He drawls as he moves to mouth at the shell of my ear.
“Oh, please. He’s always been moody. Even when he was chubby. The diet just makes him worse. Who knew that was possible...” Sherlock muttered, popping an olive into his mouth.
John chuckled softly, briefly wondering when the terrifying teenager would make an appearance. Sherlock got his own pair of pyjamas out from under his pillow, and started to undress. He unbuttoned his school shirt, slowly revealing new, pale skin centimetre by centimetre. John was a little startled by Sherlock’s actions, and wasn’t sure where to look. He tried to look away, but couldn’t help himself, and ended up staring at the other boy. Sherlock took off his shirt, revealing his long torso, and washboard stomach. John felt his breath catch in his throat, and his boxer shorts tighten. He prayed to god his school trousers were loose enough to hide his arousal.
I can’t help my noise as John pushes himself inside my soft, supple body, which is oh too happy to accommodate his, wrapping him in warmth and velvet.
She finally let the grin break out when she left the room. Manipulating Sherlock was a skill she’d perfected when the girl was merely 2 years old.
“I’ll take that as a yes- oh...” He trails off when I move my lips down to his neck, mouthing at his warm skin, dragging my tongue across the surface.
Sherlock had been replaying the lyrics to the song in her head over and over for weeks, and it was staring to drive her mad.
Sherlock quirked her eyebrows, daring him to continue. “It is rather amusing for me to see you being possessive. Who would have thought. Sherlock Holmes. Jealous.”
In the excitement, John had completely forgotten about the ice cube tray sitting on the chest of draws.
Sherlock tilted his head up to press a kiss to John’s lips. He stared deeply in to Sherlock’s eyes, and affectionately bummed his nose.
“Sherlock, this is my friend John from secondary. Sherlock and I went to sixth form together.” Mike explained, but John was hardly listening, his gaze fixated on the brunette, who was also staring at him.
Sherlock had never tried on so many clothes before. The first thing he tried were some high rise jean shorts which he matched with a pink off the shoulder top. He awkwardly stepped through the curtain where the three girls were waiting for him.
John buried himself to a hilt, his hip bones pressing up against Sherlock’s ass. He started slow and steady, pushing in, and pulling out, emitting small whimpers and whines from Sherlock with each movement.
Molly came back into the room a few minutes later in a dressing gown with a towel wrapped round her head.
“Ok, first things first. Boundaries are very important. What are your rules?” John asked, pulling Sherlock into his lap.
Mrs Holmes had changed into a floral dress and red jacket, and already had her hat on, and the pie in a tin. She extended her hand to Sherlock, who took it somewhat begrudgingly. She was nearly six, and more than capable of walking down the street without holding her mum’s hand.
He faked interest as she babbled on about baking with her grandmother, making noises of agreement, and nodding his head where appropriate. After they finished their experiment, they sat waiting for everyone else to finish.
“I just want to make sure it went well. That nobody got hurt, and you’re alright. It can be quite emotional.”
John’s plan didn’t exactly work out as it turned out the cake was rum cake, a fact they failed to notice with their dulled taste buds.
Sherlock stood in silence, unsure of how to respond. Before she could come up with anything, the room went quiet. Sherlock was first through the door, closely followed by Mrs Watson. John was sat bolt right up, white as a sheet, eyes wide and bloodshot. When he was like this, Sherlock wasn’t sure he could even see her in the room. Although he was awake, he was still very much lost in his own head. It took a few moments for his breathing to return to normal, and for him to start blinking again. Sherlock slowly walked over to his side, and sat down on the floor. After a moment, john reached out and slowly entangled their fingers, words unnecessary. He didn’t need to tell her he needed her. She already knew that.
“You Alright?” John asked, bring their intertwined hands up to his lips, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s knuckles.
John chuckled as Mrs Holmes explained. “Him and the other one are always getting in to fights. Although they’re not normally that of the food throwing kind. Normally verbal, you see. And I must say, I’ve heard some very interesting insults.”
“I was invited to this impromptu party, and I couldn’t get time off. Lestrade said I could go if I got someone to cover for me. Could you cover my shift tomorrow night?”
He hops off the bed and makes a move to leave, but he falters a moment at the doorway. He turns back to face me, and looks at me through his dark lashes with his bright cat eyes.
“How much do you care if this thing gets ruined?” John rumbled as he tugged at the fastenings of Sherlock’s corset.
The idea of Sherlock living with me, the idea of waking up to him first thing in the morning... I sigh in content.
“She’s in the parlour. If you will excuse me to get changed. As you can see, I’m not dressed to entertain.”
They looked up to see the athlete stood on the stairs, clad in only a white cotton undershirt, and a pair of boxer shorts.
He’s quiet for a little too long for my liking, so my instincts tell me the best way to deal with this is to continue rambling.
He went to pull back, but John held him close, gripping him by the hips and pulling him up so the brunette was straddling him, his head adorned with ‘freshly got fucked hair’, strands of it dangling over his eyes.
He turned on his heel, and continued his path through the battlefield. He guessed he should consider himself lucky. He’d been captured, and interrogated over the last few months. He’d only just got away. He was lucky compared to some. Some didn’t escape at all. He knew he couldn’t think about that now. All that mattered was getting home. Home to Sherlock. He inhaled deeply as he thought of Sherlock. Beautiful Sherlock. Had she changed a lot? What did she look like now? She’d be nearly 16 by now. He knew he’d see her again. He knew he would. With his new found determination, he picked up his pace. The ground beneath his feet held memories of the battles fought there, the air carrying the smell of death. Death was following him as he walked, he knew that. He couldn’t outrun it, so he simply continued walking. As he walked, he called to mind a story Mycroft used to tell. The appointment in Samarra.
He went in to the bedroom, and bolted the door behind him. He rifled through the draws for that bag, that bag containing that outfit that he’d gone out and bought in secret. The outfit that he’d forget about, then he’d remember, and he’d go all warm on the inside.
“I didn’t want to presume, but umm...” he explains. “I didn’t want to be unprepared if... you know?”
This was new, and exciting, and so very, very hot. Sherlock felt intoxicated as he lay there, his head cloudy, his very being on fire. John continued to squirt whipped cream on to Sherlock’s body, then licking it off as he went. Sherlock’s whole body seized up when johns tongue made contact with his nipple.
He threw his head back into the wall when John mouthed at his neck, kissing, biting and sucking at his pulse point.
“Why does it matter where we are?” He whispers after a moment, sliding along the desk so our legs are touching.
“Such a good boy, cumming for me. Now...” John drawled, kissing at Sherlock’s  collarbone. “Let’s go to our room... and see if I can do it again.”
He looked well rested. There were still bags under his eyes, but he looked rather refreshed. Sherlock’s eyes drifted down to his left hand which was spasming.
Sherlock awoke with her first hangover, and very little recollection of the nights events. She sat up, her hand immediately going to her pounding head. Her hand then moved to her cheek. John had kissed her. She remembered that for sure. She went down the stairs, shivering as the cold winter air nipped at her skin, the thin cotton night dress she wore doing nothing to protect her from the chill. Mycroft was in the kitchen resting her head in her arms. Sherlock took a seat opposite her, which caused the young woman to lift her head.
I stalk through the corridors, head down, choosing to ignore my surroundings. This may have been a bad idea because out of nowhere, someone grabs my arm and pulls me in to what I believe is a cupboard. After I get over my initial shock, I realise that my ‘attacker’ is none other than John.
sherlock grows accustomed to the other guards and John has a little alone time thinking about the dark haired beauty.
“Mmm, but then you’d die... maybe I’ll stab you in the chest? No, cos that’ll be a few weeks in medical, and then you’ll be out... maybe I should just accept fate and let you go...”
“You know your safety word. If you need me to stop...” He husked by Sherlock’s ear. “You know what to say.”
“Is there anything else you want me to do?” John asked, mouthing at the sweet spot on Sherlock’s neck.
She quickly wiped her face with the heal of her hands, although it didn’t really make much of a difference.
“Would you like some hot milk?” He asked finally, arching his eyebrows at the teenager who had been staring inquisitively at his alarm clock, but upon hearing the offer of milk, shot his head up.
I won’t go so far as hugging him, but i have grown to miss human contact over these last few weeks. That is just one item on the list of things I never thought I’d say, along with ‘stop hogging the corn nuts!’, because the food is terrible, and I’ve been reduced to a person who... eats corn nuts. After I’m searched, I go back to my dorm. There’s a guard in front of my cube, holding a book, my book.
“Why don’t you ask John to send a list of names he likes and you can send him a list? See if any match?”
“I’m really sticky.” He complained, chuckling a little as he swiped his finger over his still sensitive nipple.
I’ve never been like this with anyone before. I don’t even really have friends. I have people I know, but they’re not my friends.
She fell back on the stairs, and sat there, numb. She ran back up before they could hear her, and collapsed in heap of tears on her bed.
Later that night, Sherlock was tucking herself in to her make shift bed. The sofa, although very wide and spacious, hurt her back too, although she wouldn’t admit it.
“You’re so big... how am I gonna get your big cock in my little mouth?” He coos, his voice coquettish and sultry.
“My younger sister is in an asylum for the criminally insane. Mycroft was worried I would end up going down a dark path... shooting myself up until I was an unresponsive, desolate shell of a person. That’s how he sees our sister.”
“I think it would be more fun if I blindfolded you. Well, more fun for me.” John chuckled mirthlessly.
I’ve never had enough time to see how long his refractory period is, so I don’t want to make him cum yet, just in case.
The brunette pouted, but moved to rest his head on johns neck so he could sort out the shower. Almost as soon as the water was hot enough, John had Sherlock pinned up against the wall by his hips.
John paused to see if Sherlock would do as he was told, then went back to pinching the little buds, and rolling them around between his fingers.
Mrs Holmes was used to these sorts of fights with the troublesome teen, starting with why she had to heat the crusts of her bread when she was three years old.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John could see a twinkle in the blue orbs as the cogs inside the brunette's head started to move.
The second time I see the blond guard, it’s in the common room. He’s distracted this time, so I have the opportunity to observe him properly. His shirt still doesn’t have his name, so ‘blond guard’ will have to do. I allow my eyes to wander, scanning down his form. The way he stands... the way he does his hair... Ah... that explains it. I grin to myself, and walk back to the dorms.
“I can still hear you. You repeating ‘doesn’t Javier have better things to do?’ Over and over is kinda hard to ignore. Besides, you’re gonna wear a bloody rut in the floor boards.”
Sherlock had worried she wouldn’t have anything interesting to say, but seeing as John hadn’t done anything either, she didn’t feel as inadequate.
She steered him towards a row of lingerie, some of which were modelled on male mannequins. He looked over his shoulder where he saw Irene, a half filled basket in hand, practically thrusting a lacy panty set into Molly’s arms.
“No sex. I’m not ready. Just yet.” Sherlock said, affectionately running his fingers along John’s arms.
His voice was gruff, and shaky, but yet it sounded familiar. He slowly held his arms out to her, and she all but fell into them. She couldn’t help but bawl her eyes out onto his shoulder, grabbing at his shirt, her whole body shaking. John wrapped his arms around her, gently stroking in between her shoulder blades. They didn’t need to speak. Besides, there weren’t any words to describe how either of them felt. If there were other people in the room, she didn’t notice. All that mattered was John. She’d heard his voice, she’d seen photos, but nothing compared to being in his arms again. He smelt of soap, and Brill cream as she nuzzled in to his neck. That was one thing phone calls and letters could’t give her. The other was his heart, pounding in his chest, right up against hers. She didn’t want to let go. She was afraid that if she let go, she’d lose him. When she did eventually pulled back, she kept her hands on his arms. Her eyes were red and puffy, her throat raw, tears still streaming down her face.
Sherlock followed after, her toes curling, her back arching as the euphoric pulsation enveloped her whole body.
With that, John pressed their lips back together, and gently pushed the head of his cock past Sherlock’s ring of muscle.
Christ, I was a soldier. I watched men die, good men. I stood at the side, stood at their funerals, watched as their families grieved, not allowing myself to cry, holding it all together. But here, now, locked in a bloody storage cupboard, I find myself unable to keep my self contained.
Only went and posted this on the wrong story. AO3 was acting up. *eyeroll* anyway, hope you enjoy! Drama in the next chapter!
He trailed off as he leant in, and pressed their lips together in a sticky kiss. When he pulled back, he squirted a small amount of cream in the divot of Sherlock’s collarbone.
When she came back, she reminded Sherlock of the rather unpleasant task of delivering the after birth.
"In about two hours... What are you doing?" Sherlock asked when he noticed John leaning in towards him.
“No, it was. So good in fact. But these are nice trousers. I don’t want to ruin them. Do you get what I’m saying?” John asked with a smirk.
She went downstairs, and left the two boys to get ready for bed. “How long are your parents ok with me staying here?”
“Sorry. Had to ask. Wait a second, have you been planning for this?” John asked with a fiendish grin.
“The only way to do this without you guessing would be to do it out of the blue, so that’s what I’m doing. I uhh... I would get on one knee, but uhh...” he chuckled wearily as he reached in to his pocket.
“Off.” John husked, gesturing to Sherlock’s jumper. He took off the garment, but paused when John stopped him from pulling down his skirt.
The last time she had been in this position it was Mycroft holding her whilst she screamed for John to come back.
“I like the kitten ears.” He giggled softly, indicating with his index finger to a bright red, lacy pair of kitten ears.
Sherlock was aware that whilst she could offload the child’s emotional needs on to other people, feeding it was a task that she alone had to carry out.
John jumped up from the sofa, and walked over to Sherlock, who seemed all too happy to pass the seemingly imperative metal container on to someone else. Sherlock watched over John’s shoulder as he eventually managed to open the tin.
“Agh!” John groaned, his jaw clenched as he watched Sherlock move his mouth down his length. He thought he’d loose it then and there when Sherlock hollowed his cheeks, and swallowed more of his achingly hard cock.
After dessert, the pair got up to leave, John still focused on the man. He was evidently on a date with a blonde whom he had seemingly little interest in as he was paying more attention to Sherlock than to her. Just as they were about to leave, John caught him staring at Sherlock more intensely. John normally wasn’t a petty man, but this was rubbing him up the wrong way. He made sure the man was watching as he pulled Sherlock to him by the waist, and pressed his lips up against hers. She was surprised at first, but melted in to the kiss after a moment.
Sherlock’s free hand had been balling the sheets up, but he had since brought it up to toy with his nipples.
“I am. I’ll tell you to stop if I’m uncomfortable.” Sherlock reassured the blond as he shuffled closer.
I watch from my bunk as the guards change shifts. CO Mary. She’s nice by other people’s standards. She talks to us like we’re people, which I suppose, is nice. She always vouches for me when I do certain things that land me in medical, at least. As I sit, I wonder where the blond guard is. I jump up from my bed, and wander out in to the common room. I patrol the prison till lunch time, then Mike all but strong arms me in to the dining hall. The guards have all switched over by the time we return to the dorms, and the blond is back in the bubble. I take sneaky glances of him as I tidy my side of the bunk. The fourth time I look up, he’s looking right back at me. I quickly advert my gaze. I feel my cheeks heating up, and a fuzzy feeling spread to my stomach. I shake my head in the comforting, albeit pointless motion of attempting to clear my thoughts. The clock on the adjacent wall reads 16:58. The showers are normally their quietest at either five am or pm, so I grab my wash stuff, and wander down the corridor. The pathetic dribble of lukewarm water isn’t exactly pleasant, but I’ll take it over the steady stream of freezing cold water in the other shower any day. When I walk out of the showers, I walk right in to something solid. That something turns out to be someone, and of course, it’s the blond guard. I step back, blinking wildly, my hands quickly reaching to hold the towel around my waist in place.
His hands are on my hips, pulling me in to him again, and oh god, I just want more of him, I want all of him.
“I’ve never really... felt... before.” His eyes are down, staring at our hands. “But last night... I felt everything.”
He was doing his best to stay quiet, but the way John’s tongue worked the underside of his cock had him ready to burst.
He’d never been touched like this before, and it was getting him close to the edge faster than he wanted it to.
It was clear Valentine’s Day was not Mollys favourite day of the year. Sherlock on the other hand, loved it. He had something very special planned for John tonight.
“The most dangerous boy you’ve ever met, and one who has the potential to become the most dangerous man in the country.” Sherlock said this calmly, his icy eyes locking with johns.
He was fed up of guessing, and just wanted an answer by this point. He was unable to look John in the eye as he waited for a reply.
Niceties are a thing of the past, the desperate lust for one another taking the front seat in both our minds as we rid each other of clothing.
He furrows his brows, and looks at me in confusion, his cerulean eyes darting about my face as he tries to read my expression.
Mycroft’s lips curled upwards for a moment before she caught sight of Lucy out of the corner of her eye, and the smile became a frown of irritants.
“Agh! Oh god!” Sherlock cried, tugging hard at John’s hair when he brushed against his prostate. He whined when he felt John pull his fingers out.
“Hello.” He says once he slips through the door, being sure to close it behind him as quietly as possible.
There’s nothing like it, and no words printed on any page of any book could ever make me feel the way he does.
“Yes!” Sherlock howled as he rocked faster and faster, making his kitten ears bounce with the motion.
John moved his head down to Sherlock’s shoulder, and started placing kisses there, and dipping his tongue into his collarbone.
When she pulled back to look at him, his eyes were sad and bleary, a thousand thoughts and memories washing across his vision as he stared at the young woman before him.
“It’s a literary term. It’s used when the weather reflects the emotion of the characters. Grey cloudy sky..” She said, pointing upwards with the unopened umbrella in her hand.
Now that I think about it, if I hadn’t been high as a kite, I still don’t think I would have understood what was going on.
John picked up another forkful of cake, and dipped it in whipped cream before holding it out to Sherlock. The younger of the two furrowed his brows before taking a bite.
He offered John his hand, and squealed somewhat indignantly as the blond pulled him to his feet. John disconnected his headphones, and turned the volume up as loud as possible. Before Sherlock could comprehend what was happening, John was spinning him round, twirling him,  effectively forcing him to dance.
He looked down the corridor at his now closed bedroom door. He knew Sherlock was behind it. He had an idea of what Sherlock might be up to in there, but it wasn’t confirmed until he heard a buzzing noise coming through the wooden barrier, followed by a low wine from Sherlock. On the other side of the door, Sherlock had his head thrown back in bliss as he plunged his vibrator further inside his channel. John went to open the door but it didn’t budge.
Throughout the day, Sherlock and John snuck cheeky grins, winks, flirty glances, and heated stares. Throughout maths, Sherlock could feel Johns intense gaze on the back of his head. He could hardly keep his focus. When they got back to Sherlock’s house, they all but fell through the door. It was new and exciting, adrenaline coursing through their veins. Keeping their hands off each other was becoming a mundane task. All their pent up desire and attraction for one another had finally been released, and it was exploding like a volcano. As they made their way through the house, John kissed Sherlock’s full lips hungrily, nipping at his lips, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth, running his hands all over his lean body.
John chuckled against Sherlock’s neck before moving down to place kisses along the brunette’s chest. Sherlock threw his head back, eyes closing in pleasure.
“I’ll wait for you.” She inhaled deeply. “I should probably get your mother and Harriet. They’ll want to say goodbye.”
John placed a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s lips, then he reached down between them, and grasped his leaking cock. Sherlock felt arousal pooling in his stomach as John got closer to where he desperately needed to be touched. This was happening. He was about to lose his virginity. He was going to have sex. And it was all with John. He felt his heart rate slow down as he looked at the golden boy between his legs. John, whom he loved so much, and trusted whole heartedly. He closed his eyes, then gasped audibly when he felt the tip of Johns shaft press against his virgin hole.
He sucks on the bud itself and the soft skin around it, my body responding of its own accord as I find my pelvis tilting forwards.
John reached over for the body wash, leaving Sherlock leaning against his shoulder. He tentatively washed Sherlock down, running his hands over the smooth panes of Sherlock’s soft skin before moving to wash his hair.
“Yes, another time. Where I can bind your hands together, and fuck you from behind.” John grumbled, his teeth scraping the skin where Sherlock’s ass met his legs.
I thought about asking him for a bit, but based on the way he reacted last time, I decided to drop it.
He hummed in agreement, anticipation spreading throughout his body, making him tingle. He watched as John looked back in the draw, and pulled out another set of handcuffs.
I seem to miss the exchange where he grabs my arm and pulls me in to a room somewhere down a quiet corridor.
He was going to see Rosie. He wanted to see her. He was going to leave Sherlock, and he was going to spend time with her. Sherlock walked back home from school, tears beginning to fall from his eyes. By the time he got to the front door, iridescent beads were streaming down his face. He fumbled around for his keys, then tumbled through into the hallway.
After a moment of hesitation, John kissed Sherlock on her plump, pink lips. When he pulled back, her eyes were wide.
“Wha- oh! Ah, ah! Oh...” Sherlock gasped out a chuckle when John swiped his tongue along the skin on his pubic bone.
Sherlock felt his heart hammering in his chest as John lent in towards him. A warm sensation went down Sherlock’s spine, and filled his abdomen as their lips touched. He felt his cock twitch in his trousers. He didn’t have time to think about it before he felt John’s warm, wet tongue slip past his lips. He moaned softly, and opened his mouth to grant John more access. Sherlock was surprising himself at how needy and ready he was for this sort of thing. After that first small taste of the world of ‘shenanigans’, he found himself desperate for more. He moaned when John slipped his hands round his waist, under his ass, and pulled him into his lap. Sherlock was glad he wasn’t the only one who was hard. He could feel John’s lengthy erection through his jeans, brushing between his legs.
It feels like someone has lit a fire between my legs, and not in the way that people describe being horny, it actually feels as though I’m burning.
Sherlock felt his insides go all squishy, and his knees go weak when John smiled at him. He hated it. He returned the smile, then continued down the corridor with John following close behind.
The intensity of his words, the depth of his voice as he spoke them, the consequences entailed if I didn’t follow them... I’m sure he wouldn’t tell me off, but what if he did?
“Alright, I’ll be back at eight. Don’t wait up.” He grinned, then bent down to kiss the other boy on the forehead.
“I like having the apartment to ourselves.” John murmured by Sherlock’s ear, pressing his pelvis up against the trembling teen.
He managed to track him down the following day during one of his breaks. He was in the music room, a violin under his chin. He was playing the most beautiful melody, fingers dancing, his eyes closed. John watched him from the hall for a moment, taking in just how beautiful he was. He stepped forwards, and entered the room.
“Brought you a spot of lunch.” She called to him as she crosses the grass, tray of sandwiches in hand.
I’ve held off my climax for as long as possible, but with Sherlock’s body convulsing around my engorged cock, I can’t contain it anymore.
They arrived at the university, and walked through to the lecture hall. A few students were already in their seats, scattered around the hall. A handful of them turned to look at Sherlock when he came in. He gripped johns hand a little tighter. One or two looked confused, but no one said anything. Sherlock felt himself relaxing by the second. His professor gave John permission to sit in, and barely noticed Sherlock’s outfit.
“Look Sherlock.” John said, pushing Sherlock’s book down. “Do you want to go to a bar with me? To hang out?”
John brought his hands back under Sherlock’s ass, and carried him over to the bed. He covered Sherlock’s body, still situated between his legs. Sherlock’s erection was straining painfully up against his shorts, poking into john’s stomach. John was practically attacking Sherlock’s mouth with his own, sucking on his bottom lip, flicking Sherlock’s tongue with his. John pulled Sherlock’s top off, shortly followed by the shorts. He was surprised that Sherlock had his cotton briefs on underneath, but those were pulled off too before he could think anymore about it.
I traipse across the grounds to the greenhouse where, leant up against a table, I wait for the other inmates to be escorted inside by another CO.
“You can’t work it out, and it’s driving you crazy. You can’t work it out because you are like everyone else.”
I want to be able to hold him, kiss him, sooth him, comfort him, bask in the afterglow, be with him for as long as he needs, as long as we both need.
“I’m sure we can think of plenty of things.” I say simply when I realise I haven’t exactly tailored that end of my idea.
After catching his breath, he pulled out his softening cock, and rolled on to the bed beside Sherlock.
Sherlock beamed back as she took his hand and lead him over to where her mother was stood with the baby.
After Sherlock had thrown a dart at Mycroft (it was still undecided whether that was an accident or not), the pair had ended up in her father’s study.
John pulled back to look at Sherlock in surprise. Although the couple had been going out a few months, Sherlock still seemed unsure when it came to initiating anything. His eyes searched john’s as he waited for an answer. John leant in, and pressed a kiss to his temple.
Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was the panties making him horny, but Sherlock threw caution to the wind, and acted on his next impulse.
She got to her feet, and walked across the room to her sofa. She grabbed the duvet, and her pillow, and grabbed something from her overnight bag. When she returned to Johns side, he was laying down, staring at the ceiling.
“The science of deduction. That’s what it’s about, and it’s title. Just in case you were interested.”
I can see the hickeys John left on my skin, I can smell his aftershave in the air... I can still feel his cum inside me.
“You’re really horny, aren’t you?” John teased, pausing his actions to press a kiss to Sherlock’s inner thigh.
John and Sherlock had only had unprotected sex a handful of times, including their first time, and when neither of them could be bothered to go to shop for more condoms. John had to admit that he preferred it without, although there was very little difference. They had only ever had sex with each other, and kept on top of routine checks regardless.
“Well, at least I only have two. Spiders have eight. Why do they need so many? What’s up with that?” Sherlock garbled incredulously.
John worked him open, slow and steady. He added another finger, making Sherlock whimper and grab at the sheets.
Other girls were embraced by their relatives, laughing, crying. They were all occupied with their own goodbyes, so John took advantage of the moment, and leant forwards to press a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
Then there are his lips, which make every nerve in my mouth tingle, not in an unpleasant way, more analogous to that equivalent sensation of eating ice cream.
“Not at all, darling.” She smiled softly at him. “You will be grateful for the time together, I’m sure.”
She could tell he was definitely enjoying himself, the crease in his brow, the way his  breath hitched, the strangled groans that escaped him.
Mike Stamford, my bunkmate, possibly the only person here whom I don’t hate. He’s regarding me with what appears to be concern as he gets up from his bed.
After a split second of hesitation, John leaned down, and placed a kiss on one of Sherlock’s rosy cheeks. He pulled back, and left without another word.
He tipped Sherlock’s head back, and pressed their lips together. The brunette shuffled uncomfortably, his wet briefs clinging to his skin. John took Sherlock by the hand, and lead him in to their bedroom, where he pushed him down on to the bed, their lips never parting.
“Nothing, Nothing. I was merely... let us say feeling rather... skeptical about this conversation. As I’m sure you know, I have very limited knowledge on the subject of carnal relations, and thusly, the conversation will be all but one sided.” He rambles, pausing only when he realises that he is indeed doing said action.
"Umm, yes thanks. Sherlock, What are you doing?" John asked when he noticed the brunette jump up, and run into the living room.
Johns hands were on her waist, controlling the speed at which her hips moved. His tongue flicked her nipple as he sucked on the mound, all the while using his hand to massage the other.
John wasn’t sure how to respond to this. Although he’d only known Sherlock a short time, he was already rather fond of him.
“Although to be honest, I’m kind of afraid to do anything now. Seeing Mycroft may have made my dick invert.”
“You know what you need to say if it gets too much, don’t you?” He asked, running a hand through Sherlock’s curls.
Sherlock opened his mouth to ask further questions, but paused as he caught on to johns playful tone.
Sherlock couldn’t move. It felt like she’d been thrown in to an ice bath. The blood in her veins froze, her limbs seized up, her whole body went numb. Time seemed distorted. Things were happening around her, but she couldn’t focus on those things, only the things in her own head.
I really tried to keep this chapter real. It’s also not as depressing as the title makes it out to be 😆
I’m a little hot under the collar, truth be told, and his bright blue orbs watching me under hooded eyes are not helping.
John was hungry for more. The way Sherlock’s pelvis was pressing in to his, rubbing against his erection, the friction driving him absolutely mad.
“I that am lost, oh who will find me? Deep down below the old beach tree. Help succour me now the east winds blow. Sixteen by six sister, and under we go.”
“I have to go. But I won’t be out long- oh...” John trailed off when he felt Sherlock’s lips on his chest.
Sherlock rolled his eyes then joined in the cheering. They saw John hugging his team mates before running over to them. Sherlock couldn’t help but ogle him, his kit clinging to his muscled form, tanned skin glistening with perspiration, beach blond hair stuck up at all angles.
I kiss him one last time before exiting, leaving a “caution wet floor” sign behind me as a deterrent.
Sherlock held out a packet of toffees she’d bought in the gift shop to john. She’d bought it with money from her parents. Nothing they ever bought her was what she wanted, so they’d given up a few years back. John was the only person who really knew what she was interested in. Not only that, but he brought himself to have an interest too. Sherlock hadn’t noticed, but she’d been staring at him for a good few minutes now.
I notice something flicker across his face for a split second, concern, if I’m not mistaken, but he quickly goes back to being serious.
I can see that even though he is clearly experiencing intense pleasure, he would stop if I needed him to.
John raised his eyebrows, but didn’t voice how he felt about this, and instead just  re-buttoned his shirt.
Sherlock had noticed John’s rather withdrawn manner through the evening, and finally asked him what was bothering him.
John quirked his eyebrows, but pulled Sherlock up so he could unbutton his shirt and pull it off. Beneath it was a scarlet corset. John sat back on his haunches, eyes wide.
Both John and Mrs Holmes watched him with caution as he dragged himself up the stairs before going in to the kitchen.
It’s not the feeling of being gagged, it’s a combination of being deprived of something you desperately want to do, in my case, scream out how well I’m being fucked.... and having someone assert their power over you...
John chuckled, thoroughly amused that Sherlock’s idea of conversation was him spewing random facts, and john just nodding along.
She’d never heard John use this tone of voice before. She lead John into the parlour, sank down into a chair, and patted the one next to her. As John moved into the light, she got a proper glimpse of him. He hadn’t shaved, and the dark bags under his eyes suggested he hadn’t slept either.
After a moment, he begins tapping his fingers on his knee in time with the beat, and gently bobbing his head. During the last chorus, he closes his eyes, and tips his head back, his dark curls falling back and away from his face. When the song ends, he turns back to me, a smile of approval on his face.
“Yeah, they just want to ask what I know of the two of them. Honestly, I don’t believe Holmes did do it, and if he did, I bet he had good reason. In fact, if I had been on duty, I would just say he didn’t do it.”
John presented Sherlock with a fork, quirking his eyebrows flirtatiously. Sherlock took the fork, and swallowed a mouthful of cake.
Sherlock halted in his tracks when he heard John’s voice. Was he here to gauge the knife further in to his back? Never one to shy away from confrontation, Sherlock turned around to face him.
“What?” The brunette asked, somewhat confused as he watched John leave the bed and start getting dressed.
“Well, if you want to. I mean, I’ve never actually taken you out on a date... but if you don’t want to, I-“
“Well, you know it’s a good day when you walk in on the love of your life shouting at an inanimate object.”
Sunday was Sherlock’s favourite day of the week. While he enjoyed his lessons, he didn’t enjoy when they were different times to johns, meaning they didn’t see each other all day. On Saturday, John had rugby. Sherlock normally went when there was a match, but when it was just a training session, he spent his time doing experiments. This left Sunday as the only whole day they had to spend together. It occurred to Sherlock at around 10 am they they had already wasted a good percentage of the day lying in bed. They normally spent their Sundays in bed, but the activities were never that of the sleeping and lounging around variety. They were currently on their fourth video of funny cat videos after falling down the rabbit hole of the internet.
“What I don’t understand is why you two don’t go to a hotel.” Irene shrugged as she took the wine from Molly to examine it.
“Oh... ah... mmm...” Sherlock hummed in appreciation. When John pulled back, there were angry red marks covering Sherlock’s skin.
He spread Sherlock’s legs, and pulled him to his lap so he was straddling his thighs. They both let out a series of moans when their erections brushed against each other.
He was so stiff and achy as he lay with John that he made no effort to hide the grunt of disapproval that escaped him as the athlete sat up.
John stared after Sherlock as he shrugged on his dressing gown, and disappeared down the hall. He sat on the bed, fiddling with the sheets, running them through his fingers, trying to take the focus off the pulsing erection between his legs. Sherlock was not only the first boy he’d been with, but the first person. He’d had a hand full of girlfriends, but it hand never gone very far. He had known Sherlock was the one for a while, but he had wanted to wait for Sherlock to make the first move. He was ecstatic that Sherlock was ready, and that their first times would be together. He knew it was cliche, but it was also kinda hot. The very thought that Sherlock had never been touched at all turned him on immensely. He got off the bed, and reached in to the pocket of his jeans to retrieve his phone. He scrolled through the list of songs, and selected ‘Ride’ by Lana Del Ray. He looked up upon noticing Sherlock’s presence. He was standing by the door, his cheeks flushed.
No dresses. No dresses that were right for a date, anyway. She’d never needed one before, and now... now she was screwed.
“Get it yourself. Consider it your daily exercise.” Sherlock said with a wink as he crammed a bite of toast in to his mouth.
John chewed the inside of his cheek as he tried to ignore the amazing warmth and tightness of Sherlock’s body around his, and instead focus on the fact that it was going to get worse for Sherlock before it got better.
“Fine.” The brunette responded curtly, too busy looking around to see if the blonde girl had tagged along. He caught sight of her talking to Molly a few yards away. She waved, but didn’t come over.
With that, John slowly pushed inside Sherlock’s passage. Sherlock winced at the strange, imposing sensation spreading through him, and up his spine.
“Gaaaah!” I cry out as what may be the most intense orgasm I have ever experienced in my entire life hits me like a double decker bus.
John pulled Sherlock to him by the front of his underwear, holding their bodies flush together. “Trying to distract me from my homework?” John tutted.
“What’s the matter? Why are you... oh...” John mused when he recognised the jolting, almost... buzzing... motion Sherlock appeared to be experiencing.
Suddenly, the pressure on my windpipe is released and I can breathe again. I collapse against the bookcase, my head spinning, my chest heaving as my body takes in all the oxygen it can. Once my eyes open again, I see a flash of blue and khaki.
That’s what Mycroft had said when Sherlock had mentioned it to the wiry woman. It had taken the younger of the two a while to fully piece together why on earth would he miss it. He seemed perfectly traumatised to her. Then she realised that it was the lifestyle, the adrenaline, the sense of being part of something. That’s what he missed. Compared to all that, sitting in the garden of your country estate in sunny Shropshire might just be a bit boring. Sherlock knew all about being bored. There were moments when she felt like she’d go insane from all the normality and simplicity of the events unfolding around her. She thrived on the complicated, the unusual, the unsolvable. She lived for adrenaline highs.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, his icy orbs searching Johns gunmetal blues. “Close your eyes, and don’t open them till I say so.” John ordered.
Sherlock wasted no time in pushing the pram out the door, and speed walking down the road to the train station.
“I don’t think vanilla pod over here can handle the answer.” She said, winking at the girl behind her.
He plunges his tongue down my throat, licks up between my top lip and my teeth, draws my tongue in to his mouth... fuck...
He follows in toe as I gather up the other inmates. When we get to the kitchen to collect the last inmate, I manage to put a face to the name of the inmate I recognised.
Sherlock was a classical case of shy in the streets, sexy in the sheets. Although, in this case, the streets referred to his living room.
“Shhh, no, no. You have to throw it like this...” Garbled John as he tried to prise the dart off of Sherlock.
There I was thinking Mycroft was a completely soulless asshole with a pie addiction. Who would have thought he had compassion?
“That is broaching so many rules... laws... all because you couldn’t keep it ‘in your pants’. I must say, of all the things I thought I’d have to tidy up under the rug, a passionate prison affair was not one of them.”
“Yep. It can get crazy on visitation day. Saying that, you might get put in the bubble, and miss all the action.”
She knew johns house as well as her own, her legs taking her where she needed to go. Was he ok? How badly was he hurt? Would he be happy to see her? He heart pounded in her chest, her mind swirling, gasping for breath.
Sherlock wasn’t sure what to do here. It was at this point in an argument where Mycroft would call him a worthless bundle of cells that could quite easily have been a cow instead of an irritating child. Sherlock would then say out of the two of them, Mycroft was clearly the cow, then their mother would come in, tell them to behave, and send them to their rooms. All three of them had failed to notice Mrs Watson and the doctor’s return to the room, and had witnessed quite a lot of the argument.
As he spoke, John couldn’t help but wonder what his son would look like. Sherlock, himself, a mix of them both...
I reach down and fish his hair in my hands, tugging so hard it must be hurting him, but he doesn’t say.
“She’s started throwing things... so maybe it’s better you’re not here. Wouldn’t want a... foot stall... to the face now, would you?” Mycroft grimaced at a loud clattering on her end.
“Yes.” He said quickly. He didn’t really feel like having his parents company when entertaining John.
Her corset pushed her breast up in the most delightful way, practically spilling over the top. His hormones were raging, the sight before him somewhat maddening. The only downer was that he’d still have to figure out how to take it off. He sighed in exasperation when he realised what a task that would be.
She sometimes wondered what it must be like to be able to leave somethings to the imagination. She could tell May liked John. She could always tell.
“I get up to clean my teeth, and you two are making out by the sink. I try to get cereal, and your feeding each other yogurt. I try to get in to the house, and you’re in a sheet with your tongue down his throat in the door way. The final straw will be when I find you fucking on the couch while I’m trying to watch gossip girl.” Rosie teased, strutting across the floor to grab an apple from the fridge.
John sat back with a grin, and applied a generous amount of lube to his fingers. He moved forwards again, and slowly parted Sherlock’s legs, dragging his fingers up his inner thighs till they were right by Sherlock’s tight ring of skin.
They exchanged a deep kiss, delving their tongues so deep in to each other’s mouths they were close to tonsil hockey territory. They pulled back to breath, just staring into each other’s eyes.
Irene winked at them, then disappeared out the door. John carried the bowl of popcorn over, and settled on the sofa. Sherlock went to the bathroom, then took his normal place in John’s lap when he returned. Half way through the movie, he felt Johns fingers slip under his shirt, tickling his skin.
“Oh yeah?” I find myself asking, even though I have absolutely no problem believing this. He’s rock hard against my thigh as we speak.
“Well, the missus and I have got theatre tickets today, but we’re in town till Wednesday morning. How about dinner Tuesday night?”
It was sweet and gentle as they took their time to explore each other’s mouths. Sherlock eventually pulled back for breath and pressed her forehead against John’s whilst her mind raced.
“Fast... and hard... I want you... fast and hard...” I pant against his lips. “Fuck me as hard as you can.”
Sherlock shot John a wink, and tried to make his way in to the kitchen, but tripped over his own feet, and fell back in to John’s arms.
It’s not like he’s never seen me at least partially naked before, but now he’s become notably cautious due to the knowledge that this action will lead to a lot more than our previous interactions.
I have changed the format, so there is an additional update from Johns POV in the last chapter. The inspiration for this chapter came from when Sherlock gets his words jumbled up when talking to Irene in ASIB
John laughed loudly at the wonderful sight before him, only he stopped when Sherlock grabbed the bottle of chocolate sauce, and squirted it at him.
“Yes, That was my plan.” The slender boy cooed as he slapped johns book out of his hand and straddled his lap.
John slowly pushed deeper into the slender teen’s body, enjoying the way that Sherlock’s body reacted to him.
