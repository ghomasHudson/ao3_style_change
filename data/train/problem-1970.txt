“Your shirt, there's blood on it.” Anger filled Sherlock, making it easier to breathe again. This was how John did it, react with anger instead of sadness, it made a lot of things easier. He spun around and faced John and bellowed.
Do you wanna see some more? Sherlock asked. It was only then John understood what Sherlock was saying. He was asking John to come along. He wanted John to come with him to the crimescene. It would mean seeing another horrible death. It would be a risk, maybe it would trigger his ptsd again. Even though there was many reasons for him to say no (One of them being that if he said no, they might stay in the apartment and snog for the rest of the evening), there was no hesitation when he answered.
"I was still wondering, um… If I can spend some extra time in the practice-lab? I think it would help."
What did you say? Sherlock reappeared with two glasses of wine in his hands.
Nothing, John blushed and took the glas without another word.
- Why would the great Sherlock Holmes doubt his senses? John taunted. Sherlock frowned.
- Well you don’t love me back do you? He spat.
Dr Watson, he said as he walked past John. John closed the door behind him and sat down in his chair.
- We’ll be in touch, he said and once again strode to the door. John felt finished with following Sherlock blind.
You mean cuddling? He asked gingerly. Sherlock dragged himself to a sitting position. His shirt was a bit creased and his hair was messy but he didn’t seem to mind. He just pulled his finger through his hair, moving it away from his eyes.
- He said he had written a new will when he gave me this stamp. That the one thing left was to tell his other children, but he kept putting that off. When he died I waited to be called to the reading of the will but that didn’t happened. I don’t know what to believe.
“I have been through hell the last two years.”
- Well no, but this is not an ordinary first date. And yes, I’m wondering if you have had sex. Sherlock smiled a bit, looking forward.
“But I” Sherlock protested.
Yet here you are, John looked at Sherlock thinking. He was beautiful, there was no other word for it. He was bright and scary observant, and he seemed to have the emotional capacity of a five year old.
-okay, okay, then what was the other night about?
Sometimes, well most of the time, the police finds it hard to solve even the easiest crimes and then they need help. I help them.
- You say that I don’t want to take things further, how can you be so blind? It’s taking all my willpower when we kiss to not throw you over my shoulder, taking you into my bedroom and not letting you go for days. Sherlock spat the words out. They were words of anger, not of seduction. Still John could feel himself responding.
"Thanks, Mr… I mean Dr Watson" he stole another look at John before he walked out of the room.
You don’t listen when I say that I don’t want to see you anymore, you came here, he indicated the room with his hand.
What do you mean?
“Look at me, Sherlock”. Sherlock hesitated, long enough for John to lose patients. He put his hand on Sherlock’s cheek and forced him to look. John looked even more like a mess than when he first opened the door. But a different kind of mess, and Sherlock thought but didn’t believe, a happier kind of mess. His hair was sticking out in places, his lips were swollen and his cheeks red.
“True” Sherlock could hear a faint smile in John’s voice. He turned around, slowly enough to give John time to stop him. They looked at each other without saying anything. Sherlock had too many questions to ask to know where to start. He wanted to know about John’s drinking habits, about this apartment, about his attempted suicide even if that train of thought still petrified him. Then there were the questions about the kissing. John had said that he wanted him, what did that mean in the next twenty or so minutes? Where did they go from here? He knew what he wanted to do but had the feeling that it was John’s choice to make. John took his hand and brushed away some curls from Sherlock’s forehead. It left the skin tingling where they had touched. He closed his eyes, trying to save the feeling in his memory. He gripped John’s hand. Something to continue the physical contact but didn’t involve anything new. They had held hands before. Not in this setting but still, no new input. John seemed to take that as encouragement since he smiled and put his other hand on Sherlock’s cheek, caressing his cheekbone with his thumb. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from leaning into the touch, it felt too good.
“Well I’m not going to fuck you on the kitchen table just minutes after you tell me you haven’t even kissed anyone before now am I?”
“It was actually a rather clever plan. It was my idea, Mycroft helpt but still most of it…” Sherlock trailed off. He had realised as soon as he said cleaver that it had been a mistake. John looked livid. He walked up to Sherlock, buried his fist in Sherlock’s shirt and pushed him against the door. Sherlock vinced, it wasn’t that long ago he had been whipped.
I thought I made it clear to you that I’m not ready for any kind of intercourse so we can’t seal the deal so to speak. John blushed up to his hair.
- No, John said. He didn’t know if he would ever be able to say no to Sherlock when he looked at John with such want in his eyes.
You’re not mad about the theft, you’re mad that I tricked you, he said.
“Is this okay.” John asked quietly. Sherlock straightened up, a bit embarrassed by his obvious enjoyment of John’s touch. He had to clear his throat before he could answer.
“How long have you lived with this secret? How long have you decided what I feel?”
- John. Sherlock had closed his eyes as well.
I guess you’re not supposed to date students but it seemed like your Mr Holmes’ older brother could see to that if it would pose a problem. He had saved his brother before.
- 26280 hours. Sherlock said, then continued when he saw the look on John's face.
So you’re telling me that you actually asked me out? John stared disbelieving at Sherlock.
I’m sorry John, I should have known, Sherlock said in a low voice. John shook his head. This was not Sherlock fault, could never be Sherlock’s fault. This was all on him. He had put Sherlock in harm's way.
- Well it has to have been someone close to father. And we have invited all of our family and father's old associates. Mrs Gordon kept quit so John assumed she agreed.
- Did you Google things to talk about on a first date? Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John dressed with care the following night. It felt strange to dress up for someone who saw you in your pyjamas now and then. But he still chose a pullover Sarah had bought him because she said it looked good on him. It was a fifteen minute walk to the restaurant and John was ready and walked down to the living room at twenty to eight. Sherlock was sitting in the sofa but rose when John walked in. John could feel the butterflies in his stomach, it was clear that Sherlock also dressed for the occasion in the purple shirt that always made John's eyes linger. Even before this whole business, did Sherlock know that? Highly likely John thought. He tried to act calm through the nerves and smiled at Sherlock.
- I... Sherlock sighted. He was quiet for a moment longer, and then started the monologue John was waiting for.
- I’m going for a walk. He said. Sherlock didn’t reply. The air was cool when John stepped out onto the pavement, rain hung in the air. He took a deep breath, feeling like he hadn’t taken a proper breath since Sherlock came home. His thoughts kept on spinning. Sherlock loved him, was in love with him. And had been for a while by the sounds of it. And John was... flattered, he had to admit. Even he who had never looked at men like that could see that Sherlock was attractive. And it was nice having someone wanting you. But he didn’t think he wanted Sherlock to want him. Even though he had felt things these few days, he was pretty sure those feelings would abide. Even if they didn’t, did he want a relationship with Sherlock? A relationship that involved cuddles and kisses and sex. John stopped dead in his tracks by the thought. Sex with Sherlock was a thought that made him equal parts terrified and aroused. He was in trouble.
- just bloody do as I ask for once and just forget about it! he shouted. Sherlock looked surprised, he hadn’t realised how upset John was. It gave John a hint of satisfaction. It wasn’t often he could surprise Sherlock.
“I could have lost you.”
I want you to tell me how much you lied about yesterday, something flashed in Sherlock’s eyes and he sat down in the chair eying John.
Don’t you know? He said. Sherlock shook his head.
Sorry for what? He asked, meeting Sherlock’s eyes for the first time this day. Sherlock rolled his eyes, sighing.
What did I say? Molly looked surprised. John felt he had to tell someone.
When John came down from his bedroom newly dressed and heading for the kitchen and the kettle, he saw Sherlock standing at the door. He sighed, knowing that tea and the newspaper had to wait. Instead he headed for the door, following Sherlock out to the street and into a cab.
“What’s wrong?”
You don’t need to call me Mr Holmes, Sherlock said almost at once. John was surprised, Sherlock usually didn’t speak at all when he was in John’s office. And if he did it was usually because John had asked him a question.
- I’m close; he tried to warn Sherlock and got some murmurs as a response. But Sherlock didn’t stop or slow down. Just a few moments later John came in Sherlock’s mouth. John shouted, gripping the chair tighter so he didn’t fall off as the world spun around him. Like he was far away could he feel Sherlock releasing him, putting his head against John’s knee. Then John could hear a zipper being pulled down and soon he could hear Sherlock groan. All was still and quiet for a few moments. Then John opened his mouth.,
I’m not a civilian, I’m a consulting detective.John rolled his eyes.
You need to go, he whispered to ashamed to meet Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock hesitated.
"Please, sit down" he indicated the chair opposite the desk. Mr Holmes sat down but started to bounce his leg as soon as he sat down.
“Are you using again?”
"Are you going home?" Mr Holmes asked as John put his card back in his wallet. He nodded his answer.
John thanked her and started climbing the stairs. He could hear classical music from the apartment above. He knocked on the door and the music stopped. Sherlock opened a door dressed in a purple shirt that was ridiculously tight over his chest. It made John’s mouth water.
“Why haven’t you told me before?”
- I love you.
“Irene was, is, just an infatuation. She intrigues me, but no more than a painting or a piece of music. I can’t deny she affects me, but a beautiful piece of music does that as well. It’s nothing compared to my feelings towards you.” Sherlock blushed, both embarrass and liberated talking about his feelings so freely.
- Did you do that math in your head? He asked. Sherlock rolled his eyes as an answer.
I haven’t found anyone I wanted to kiss before. It seemed like a waste of time. John tried to take this in and decide what it meant. He decided not to make a big deal out of it, following Sherlock’s lead.
- I’m relying on your discretion Mr Holmes, your brother recommended you. Sherlock nodded but didn’t say anything. That Mycroft pushed cases in Sherlock’s direction was nothing new.
“Sherlock” John said. He wasn’t shouting any more, instead he sounded concerned. Sherlock looked at him, though he had a hard time focusing. John took Sherlock’s vrist in his hand and checked his pulse. He shuddered as he did it.
- Yes, I was thinking we could go to that new Italian place down the street? Sherlock still looked at him like he was talking a foreign language and John was beginning to regret his question.
"Do you have any siblings Dr Watson?" John nodded.
I’ll have you, he said, the words only a whisper. Sherlock smiled and clapped his hands together.
John sat still for a while, fighting the feeling of dread in his stomach. He was in trouble. His small infatuation with Mr Holmes had gone from a small irritation to a bigger problem, especially if it would affect a students grade. He waited impatiently for Mr Holmes to come back. He came on the second two hours after John had last seen him. John had started to pack up his things with nervous glances towards the door. He stepped just inside the door and held his hand out with the card in it. John walked up to him and took the card.
What kind of experiment? He asked patiently watching Sherlock move.
Then you’re more stupid than I thought, he said before the silence could stretch. Sherlock draw in a deep breath.
- Wait, you men love? Like lovelove? Sherlock rolled his eyes.
You wanted to see me, Mr Holmes said, leaning against the doorframe. For a second, John let himself think about how good he looked in the light shining in from the window. Then he pushed the thought aside and focused on his role as a teacher.
- We are as sure as we can be that our father places this stamp with his others. Sherlock leaned back in his chair again, he met John’s eyes. He looked pleased, not a very appropriate feeling. John had never collected anything, more than football cards when he was young. But he guessed that the stamp was worth more money than he would ever se.
- If you tell me what this is about maybe I can tell you something useful, he continued. He could hear Sherlock moving around in the bathroom.
- You didn’t ask yesterday if we were going on another date. I wonder if that means that you don’t want to date me anymore. Sherlock spoke matter of factly.
“Sherlock, wait. What are we doing?” Sherlock met John’s eyes. His pupils were dilated making his eyes look darker.
“For dying.” It wasn’t what Sherlock had planned to say, but it was the truest thing he could think of now that he saw John. Saw what he had done. It had been clever and it had been necessary. But it had broken John. John made a sound halfway between a giggle and a sob.
Did you serve in Afghanistan or Iraq? John looked nonplussed at Sherlock who was still smiling, apparently enjoying John’s confusion. How did he know? John never spoke of the army to his classes, he was afraid they were going to ask questions that was going to trigger something.
“You have no right coming in here after two years making demands.” Sherlock wanted to contradict John, tell him he hadn’t been gone for two years. He had made it back before the two year mark.
“I don’t know what this.” Sherlock indicated them both with his hand.
"Dr Watson" he said falling into step with John.
- Where should I start? Sherlock drank some of the tea, made a face when it was too hot and motioned in the general direction of the windows.
CO-CA-INE, Sherlock said slow and loud.
Sherlock looked at the brown door in front of him. If John didn’t open, it would take him approximately three minutes to get in. It was a cheap sort, fit only to keep flies out. Sherlock would have thought that a landlord in a neighbourhood like this, where the crimerates were high would invest in better doors. He wondered how John could sleep here. He shook his head. Scolding himself for thinking about nonsens instead of just knocking. He was stalling, that was it. He had thought of this moment for two years. Every second since he jumped from the roof of S.t Barts, his goal had been to get back to John. In his fantasy John had stayed in Baker street and not moved to this depressing housing complex. Sherlock hoped that other parts of his fantasy would prove more true. He was suddenly afraid. Angry with himself for the weakness, he raised his hand and knocked. He could hear footsteps inside and the shuffle of two safety chains. He smiled, thinking that some things hadn’t changed. Then John opened and Sherlock could see that other things had. John had lost weight. He had never been fat. But he was well built. His training habits from the army had stuck. And with a diet of beans on toast and takeaway ment that he was never thin. Even when Sherlock met him and had seen how little he had eaten since leaving the army, that weightloss had still been hidden beneath the muscles. He had looked fit then. Now he looked ill. The skin was starting to sag in his face, he had dark circles under his eyes. He had new wrinkles. Not the nice kind that came from laughing and smiling. These were from frowning. Sadness etched into his face permanently. It took John a moment to realise who was standing in the doorway. When he did, he took a step back.Sherlock took one forward and closed the door behind him. Saving himself from the risk of getting the door slammed in his face.  John stood still a few feet from him. Sherlock had thought he would look happy, at least a bit. He could understand that this came as a chock, but still.
Sherlock gave him a long look but didn’t say anything more.
- Come on over John. We need to see if we can find anything new in the surveillance. I’m stuck, I don’t like being stuck. John sighted but he folded his paper and watched the tv instead. They had gotten the footage from the three cameras in the room of the safe deposit boxes. Sherlock had chosen to start with the one that filmed the entrance, the date was six months ago. They sat in silence watching as people came and went. John was bored after five minutes and after half an hour he was ready to cry of boredom.
That you are in love with me? John answered.
“I think I need a drink for this conversation, John said.
"You can borrow this. I’ll be here two more hours but then I need it back." The student took it, flashing a fast smile that to John seemed a bit out of character. Then he stood up.
- I know what you said. But actions speak louder than words and you don’t seem that interested in taking things further. Sherlock straightened up a bit and when he spoke he sounded angry.
- Tell me why we want to spend more time in the presence of those people? They were so utterly boring. John just looked at Sherlock for a while before he sighed and continued.
“You could have died” he had meant to sound angry but it came out as a whisper. John rolled his eyes. In that moment, Sherlock couldn’t see anything of his John in the person standing in front of him.
John’s office wasn’t quite like the other staffs. His desk had been standing in the middle of the room with the back towards the windows when John got the room. He had quickly moved it so he was sitting with his back against the wall instead. He knew he was being silly, noone was going to attack him through the window. But this was the only way he could concentrate. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. He walked in and stopped in front of the desk, fidgeting with his backpack. John sat down, thinking that it might make Mr Holmes more at ease.
“Why…?” He croaxed, still struggling to clear his mind. John had tried to end his life. Sherlock could have done everything he had done the last two years and John could have been dead when he came back. He could have lived in a world without John.
- I asked your assistant to send me all the records and surveillance concerning this case. I’m hoping he has started? Sherlock rose from his seat. The others looked surprised at him as he strode out of the room. John rose slowly and smiled at their stunned faces.
"And you are…?" The stranger smiled a little smile that reminded John of someone. He couldn’t figure out who.
- How do you steal something from the Bank of England?
Actually you’re an army doctor. John stod silent, not following Sherlock’s line of thought. This wasn’t news to Sherlock.
- If you don’t have any experience in dating, does that mean you don’t have much experience in...? You know... Sherlock looked at John with a look of humour.
“I…” He started and then fell silent again. He had no idea how he would explain what he felt and had thought about his feelings.
Sherlock started to walk towards John, he felt that he suddenly had trouble breathing. He could feel his heart in his throat as Sherlock leaned into him, placing his hands on John’s armrests. Then Sherlock’s lips touched his. It had been a long time since John had kissed anyone, but that didn’t explain the rush of emotion that flooded his system. His mind went blank, the only thing he could think about was how right this felt. It didn’t feel strange at all, not even that awkward like first kisses usually did. The kiss deepened, John lightly pressed his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth who opened his lips willingly. He was still standing bent over John and he ended the kiss too soon in John’s liking. Sherlock leaned back, sitting on John’s desk.
You’re saying his brother threatened you so his brother could stay at uni?
- What do you mean?
“I know,” John said gently. Sherlock was grateful that he didn’t make a snide remark. He could realise that what he felt now was nothing compared to what John had endured.
So that’s good right? She said after a while.
“Could you… “He trailed off, his eyes drifting close again. He cursed under his breath as Sherlock tried to suck at one of his fingers.
Of course I am, John looked up at Sherlock. Part of him wanted to say that he was not serious, that all he wanted was to be with Sherlock. But that wasn’t an option as long as he could hurt Sherlock. Sherlock scrutinized him.
“Oh, I thought. Of course Sherlock, of course I want you. Any way but bloody.”  he winked and left Sherlock alone with his throbbing heart and pink cheeks.  He unbuttoned his shirt, wanting this interlude to last as short as possible. He hadn’t had time to move before John came back. He paused in the doorway, his eyes roaming over Sherlock’s naked chest. Sherlock blushed as he could read John’s thoughts clear as day. It made heat build in his stomach again. John cleared his throat but his voice was still a bit lower than usual when he spoke.
"No, no, there’s nothing you can do there. I just need to practice more." John felt for the man. He wasn’t supposed to but he took out his card that gave him access throughout the school. And handed it to Mr Holmes.
Iraq or Afghanistan? John was sitting writing at his computer when he heard a voice from his open doorway. He looked up, Sherlock was leaning on the doorframe. John took a second to take in the beautiful human standing there. He had another one of those shirts who looked like they were made for him and his hair looked like he had been out in the wind, it fell in curls into his eyes. Those eyes he couldn’t pinpoint the colour of. Yesterday they had looked grey, now they looked green. John mentally shook his head, he had to stop this.
- They are used as payment for post. They usually have the queen on them. Some people collect them. And I think I have some in my wallet if you need some? John could hear Sherlock’s sigh and knew he was rolling his eyes.
“You don’t know everything about me and my feelings, John” Sherlock knew he was being careless. He should stay quiet. Let John have his tantrum and then they would move on. End up in their usual habits. But he just couldn’t take it anymore, something had to give.
“Bet you didn’t see that one coming” he teased. Sherlock didn’t answer, he didn’t think. Instead he fell on his knees, moved closer to John, took his head between his hands and kissed him again.
- This is a rather delicate matter. We have never seen anything like it.  Mr Jackson kept on talking.
- Are you trying to ask me if I’ve had sex? Is that really a question for a first date? John blushed.
- I and my wife are hosting a dinner party tomorrow night at eight. If you want to talk to people that we suspect. John looked at him with a question in his eyes.
- I have never been on a date, Sherlock said.
I won’t listen? John spat out, trying not to shout.
No, I didn’t. John felt anger rising in him, he tried to suppress it, keeping his cool.
“What did I do?” John asked quickly, then he understood the full implications of Sherlock’s word. Sherlock could see it dawning in his eyes.
I won’t be making that mistake again in a while, John tried to joke, hiding the nervousness he felt.
You know those stolen bodyparts we all got emails about? He asked her.
"The only thing different yesterday from other days was that your keycard was used accessing the morgue. Why were you there?"
Why are you here then, why do you take this class if you have a job as well?
“You still should have told me” came from beneath John’s hands.
“I need a drink” John said. Turning around and stomping out into the kitchen. Sherlock took a moment to close his eyes and compose himself before he followed. John had poured himself a glass of some clear liquor. The bottle was already half empty and looked like a cheap, generic brand. Not the whiskey John had usually bought and only drank once in a while. Did John have a drinking problem now? Sherlock stored that worry for a later time. John was standing with his back against the counter and eyeing Sherlock with the most direct gaze he had had since Sherlock entered the apartment. The daze and shock was gone.
I… I don’t know. I never got around to ask. He blushed.
“You kissed me first!” Sherlock interjected.
When John came down for breakfast the next morning the living room was filled with boxes. Sherlock was sitting on the floor, resting his back against the sofa and raftering through a box. He only gave John a short glance when he walked past to the kitchen. John could see that he was still in his dress trousers and shirt he had worn the previous day. Sherlock had spent the previous evening pacing the living room, frustrated that it took the bank so long to gather up the surveillance and bring it to Baker Street.
“But you know what” John said and leaned back, not waiting for an answer. Sherlock wasn’t sure he could have gotten one out if he had tried.
- Well, that, I... He closed his mouth trying to think of a coherent answer.
- Lovelove? He asked which made John smile.
“Why would I? It hadn’t made a difference.” Sherlock succumbed to his knees weakness and sat down in his armchair. He had to grip the sides so he didn’t just stand up and walk away.
- I think you want to see me miss Williams. He was buzzed in and John followed Sherlock into the elevator.
You’re a doctor, he said slowly eying John.
“Will we ever be okay?” John opened his mouth to answer and then shut it again. Seeming to ponder the question.
"I don’t think that’s a good idea, Mr Holmes." John felt bad for letting the man down.
“Surprisingly nice” Sherlock said honestly without thinking. Most of his bloodflow had traveled south leaving him a bit lightheaded. He had thought he was kissing John just for his sake. Now he wanted to continue for a lot of selfish reasons. John started laughing, bending forward and put his hands on his knees. He seemed to be having a hard time stopping laughing. It felt to Sherlock like it took a long time for him to silence and straighten up. Then he saw Sherlock’s confused look and started giggling again. Then, at last he pulled himself together.
- Who has most to lose with a new will that introduces another heir? Sherlock asked, looking at John with a look that said he was being slow.
- Well no, we... He was interrupted by Sherlock.
- Because someone has forged a will, and I’m pretty sure who it is.
“I love you.” he said. Looking like he had just made a high jump. Sherlock felt relieved, he knew what to say to this.
So you’re a drug addict? He asked, more to get a reaction than anything else. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Yes, that’s the word.
- Oh god, he said as Sherlock put John’s erection into his mouth. He almost came from the sensation alone. His fingers grabbed the side of the chair and held tight. He could feel his orgasm building up fast.
- To visit Mrs Gordon? Sherlock smiled, letting John know it was the right answer.
I was testing how fast a liver disintegrates when doused with acid.
You didn’t go to the practice lab yesterday, he said to a still standing Sherlock. He pursed his lips, like he was fighting a smile.
- Is it a no? Sherlock said, scrutinizing John.
- I love you, was the words that came to mind first. Sherlock eyes him suspiciously.
“Kissing?” He answered but it sounded like a question. John smiled so the answer can’t have been that wrong. He leaned in for another kiss but John put his hand up between them to stop him. Without thinking, Sherlock licked one of his fingers. He was curious how they tasted and felt. He wanted to know everything about John that he didn’t already know. It made John groan and close his eyes. He didn’t remove his hand though, Sherlock took that as encouragement. He kissed the palm of John’s hand, hearing John’s breathing hitch. He tried to lick the place he had kissed. Then doing the same with all of John’s fingers.
- Sherlock, should we... he was interrupted by Sherlock.
“What?” The question came as such a surprise to Sherlock that he smiled. Anger flared in John's eyes so he quickly sombered his face. He looked around in the small kitchen, there was only room for a small table and two chairs. If he took two large steps he would be right infront of John.
“No, I’m not. That’s not why.” Sherlock could see that John wasn’t convinced. He unbuttoned his cuffs and rolled up the arms over his elbows. John took a step forward as Sherlock stretched out both of his arms for John to see. John touched Sherlock’s wrist where there were still red marks from the restraints he had been in just days before.
"Mycroft Holmes, I believe you have made the acquaintance of my brother?" John took a step back. Had Sherlock sent his brother to speak on his behalf, what grown up did that?
“Like it isn’t a good idea to be kissing me” Sherlock filled in, looking over John’s shoulder to the wall behind.
-So we can expect you in the office then? There was a hint of desperation in his voice. John had learned to pick out those small hints in people’s voices during medical school. A certain hitch in a patient’s voice could mean there was something they weren’t telling him. But since he moved in with Sherlock his ability to read people through their voices had grown exponentially.
This bit, whatever you call it, Sherlock waved his hands round in the air. John sat back on his legs looking at Sherlock.
- I just... John lost his train of thought as Sherlock started licking Johns cock.
When John came to work the following day he was greeted by his boss. He didn’t look too happy and John tried to remember everything he had done the last week, trying to figure out what he had done wrong. His boss only spoke to him when something was wrong.
- It isn’t for me, he said gritting his teeth. Sherlock had stopped in front of a door, he flashed John a smile.
"I know" the man said, shaking John’s hand. He had a firm handshake.
- Are you still angry? he asked. John shocks his head, and then realised Sherlock couldn’t see him in the dark room.
Okay, did he or she give a good explanation? John realized he hadn’t even asked.
- Is this what you want?
But mind you, I’ll keep my eyes on him, Molly continued when she saw that John was about to object.
The twinkle in his eyes told John what Sherlock was talking about. His heart skipped another beat and he felt like this thing between him and Sherlock was bound to cause heartbreak for his part.
- We have an appointment with the branch manager. And I want to see the perimeter as well. The taxi slowed to a stop and they both got out. They were standing in front of a bank office that looked like every other bank office John had been to. There were large glass windows full of posters urging people to borrow money to follow their dreams, and to save so that their children can follow their dreams. As they walked in they were greeted by the man John had seen with Sherlock just a few hours earlier. He had changed his tie but otherwise looked just as rumpled as before.
That I’m falling for you, John said. Sherlock didn’t respond. He didn’t show any sign of emotion.
“It wasn’t a miracle. It was a carefully calculated plan. I could tell you…” he trailed off. He could hear a huff coming from John.
“I don’t think this is a good idea.” Sherlock went cold and hurried to crawl back to his own chair. Not an easy thing to do in a dignified way. John leaned in trying to hold Sherlock’s hand but he kept himself busy putting on his shirt, looking down at his hands. The shirt was unpleasant to put on. It was spotted with dried blood that got stuck on his bandages. But it gave Sherlock an excuse to not look at John for a whole minute.
“I don’t do sex.” he started. It sounded more crude said out loud than it had in his head. John choked on his drink.
- John, I’ve already told you, I want all of you. It’s you that need to make up your mind. With those words Sherlock continued walking and John had to run to keep up. They walked in silence the rest of the way home. John was mentally kicking himself, he felt like he had messed up. He wasn’t sure about much these days, but he was sure he didn’t want to mess this up. He didn’t want to hurt Sherlock. He was still thinking about what to do when they entered the apartment. Sherlock took of his coat and headed for the living room. Then he stopped and turned around.
I do to, the blush on Sherlock’s cheeks grew more prominent as John looked at him. John could sense it was a big admission for a man who said feelings was to complicated and messy to deal with.
No but I… John felt more stupid by the second.
- Coping? Is it that hard loving me? John tried to make his question into a joke but failed. He could see anger flare up in Sherlock’s eyes.
It didn’t help John at all with his level of desire that was threatening to overcome him. But he sensed the logic in what Sherlock was doing. The man was so tall so he was now almost completely level with John. He leaned forward, feeling a bit unstable sitting at the edge of the chair, and kissed Sherlock again. It was even better the second time, Sherlock seemed to be a fast learner and the kiss quickly depend. John had his hands in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him closer. Sherlock’s hands roamed from his neck down to his bum. They only let go of the other ones lips for occasional gasps of air and John was feeling a bit lightheaded.  His only thought was to keep Sherlock close, he could not get close enough. Sherlock seemed to think the same because he pushed John even closer to him. Which made John lose his balance on his office chair and he fell forward. The chair rolled away behind him and John felt onto Sherlock. His quick reflexes made him catch himself before he crushed Sherlock. But he was still sitting on top of Sherlock with his hands on either side of his head, who had his legs bend beneath him in an odd angle. They looked at each other in surprise, and then they started to giggle. Sherlock moved to untangle his legs but he didn’t attempt to get up. John tried to catch his breath. His erection was straining in his trousers and as he sat, he could feel Sherlock’s cock hard against him. It made him want to forget where they were, how inexperienced Sherlock was and just rip the clothes of him and fuck him every way possible. Instead he steadied his breath, relaxing the muscles that was strained with the desire of pulling Sherlock closer. He lowered his head and leaned his forehead against Sherlock’s. He closed his eyes and they stayed like that for a moment. Both of their breathing slowing down, echoing each other. John felt his desire being taken over by fondness. He really cared for this man lying beneath him. He barely knew him, but he felt connected to him in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time if ever.
- Of course I did. I don’t have your experience. John opened his mouth to disagree but closed it again. He was experienced compared to Sherlock.
- I don’t want to talk about it. He unclenched his fingers trying to finish making his tea.
- Where are we going? John asked while looking out through the window. Sherlock was typing on his phone, but glanced up on John. He didn’t answer. Instead he pocketed his phone and looked at John with an urging look.
“Cruel.” Sherlock said quietly, not intending for John to hear it. But John’s grip tightened telling him that he had heard. They sat in silence while John got his breathing under control.
I don’t know, he said finally and then turned around and walked out of the room. John sat down, weak in the knees.
“Of course I do”
"Mr Andersson" John said continuing walking towards his office.
“Of course it had!” John raised his voice a bit.
- Do you know why you weren’t in the will? Sherlock continued. Miss Williams shook her head.
What’s wrong? Sometimes John was grateful over Mollys’ knack of seeing through him, today wasn’t one of those days.
Was in you that played? John asked, he hadn’t imagined Sherlock as an man who liked music.
Yes, yes you can kiss me, John finally manage to make a sound.
- He passed on his interest in stamps to you? He asked. Miss Williams smile got a bit more genuine.
- But you go first. John didn’t fight him about that. He didn’t like the idea of telling Sherlock about his feelings the last couple of days but he knew when he was beaten. If Sherlock said please there was no way he was letting this go.
You want to go, John said quietly.
This chapter doesn't add more to the case, just a little Johnlock to tie it all together :)
- What do you know about stamps? Sherlock’s voice came from the doorway. John was sure he had closed it before entering the shower. But Sherlock was never one to bother about privacy and closed doors. And John was so used to his flatmate ignoring all usual social cues that he didn’t even get irritated any more.
"I heard he was in a bit of trouble" Mr Holmes said and sat down in the chair opposite the desk. The one Sherlock had sat in the day before. John remained standing. He didn’t trust this man and his instincts told him to not place Mr Holmes between himself and the door.
- Isn’t obvious? He continued walking. John tried not to get angry, but sometimes Sherlock made it so difficult.
He’s just up the stairs dear, she said pointing up a stair in the narrow hallway.
He threatened me, said he could put incriminating pictures on my computer if i didn’t let you stay. But if you were any other student you would be out from this university at once. Stealing body parts, I have never heard about anything like it.
“So…” John cleared his throat.
- Yes, I think that would be nice, Sherlock replied.
“You should have told me” John repeated. Now, Sherlock was feeling annoyed. It was a nice feeling compared to being scared.
"Yes I have" John answered slowly. Mr Holmes nodded. He must be the older brother John thought. He looked older and a younger brother wouldn’t try to save his older brother, right?
- What happens now John? You said there was usually kisses after a good date, was this a good date? John felt an overwhelming feeling of affection for Sherlock. This man who claimed to be a sociopath to keep people away showed himself so vulnerable to John. He felt it was an honour. He stepped forward, reached up and put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face and kissed him soft on the lips. He could feel his heart race, feel his body aching for more. But he tried to steady himself, tried to savour the moment. Sherlock stood still, frozen, but he couldn’t hide the tremble that ran through his body. It made John want to hug him. So he ended the kiss and folded his arms around Sherlock. Now he could feel Sherlock’s heart beating against his own. Sherlock’s hands were gripping the back of John’s shirt, his forehead rested on John's shoulder. They stood so for a while, none of them seemed eager to move. Then Sherlock released his grip on John.
Wait, John said, standing as well. Sherlock stopped and turned around.
John had stepped away to get some peace and quiet, and to gather his thoughts. He had tried all evening to figure out if anyone of the guests had a motive to steal a rare stamp. But so many of the guest came off as fake to him so he wasn’t sure if they were just hiding ordinary things that everyone did, or if they hid a secret theft. And he had found it hard to concentrate with Sherlock playing the ever so attentive boyfriend. He couldn’t understand why it rubbed him the wrong way when Sherlock was holding his hand or calling him darling. After some time acclimatizing he had done the same. And also found that he and Sherlock was a perfect fake couple. Still, he was agitated and needed to get away from his partner. He walked around the house and leaned against the brick wall. Maybe he just had too much alcohol and too little sleep. If he could just stand there in the relative quietness for a couple of minutes, he would be fine. John could hear steps in the gravel and looked up. He could just se the silouette of Sherlock standing a few feet away, hands in his pockets.
“It was necessary to keep you safe.”
God I hope not.
- What?! John exclaimed, looking at both Sherlock and miss Williams.
- How come you noticed? Touchy feely stuff as you put it isn’t your strong suit.
I figured, he said. Tearing his eyes away and meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
- Bank of England? John guessed. Sherlock nodded with a hint of a smile.
I liked it, I just… it’s too much at once. Sherlock took John’s hands in his, prying them open.
"Do you… hm… do you…"John looked at the stuttering man in front of him, feeling pity.
"I’ll be talking to your boss as well. Goodbye."
Afghanistan, he said finally. Sherlock smirked. He leaned back in the chair, his hands behind his neck. The buttons in his shirt straining. Once again, John thought that Sherlock was good at flirting. If this wasn’t flirting he didn’t know what was, and it was working. He forced himself to look away and met Sherlock’s eyes instead.
- John! Could be heard down the hall. John said some excuses and half walked, half ran after Sherlock. He had seen that look on Sherlock's face before and he knew it was likely Sherlock went without him if he didn’t hurry. Sherlock was already waving down a cab and getting in when John exited the house.
-Yes.  Sherlock said, not missing a beat. John felt like he had gotten a bucket of ice thrown at him. The safe feeling he had a moment ago was gone.
"What the hell, are you threatening me?"
- It just means I am unsure if you still want to date me. John could see that Sherlock was about to object so he continued.
- Sure we do, Sherlock answered. John smiled in a reassuring way.
- That’s why he gave it to you, Sherlock filled in. Miss Williams nodded. Sherlock looked at John.
I think you do, I trust you. John opened his mouth to object but closed it again. What could he say?
“You’re having a panic attack Sherlock, try to take a deep breath.”
Yes, drugs, mostly cocaine. I have been clean for three months. He started pacing again, avoiding meeting John’s eyes.
- I thought you were likely to visit someone concerning the case, that isn’t many. We have already been to Mr Bryce place and I didn’t recognise the address you gave so I guess Mrs Gordon. John could see that Sherlock was pleased but he didn’t say anything. He stared out the window and by the way his eyes glazed over John could tell he was thinking hard. No point in disturbing him then. He had his own thoughts to keep him occupied, because he had just made a disturbing realization. John had gotten butterflies in his stomach when Sherlock smiled at him. That was not good, not good at all. Was it still some lingering feelings from last night or was this something new? Or was it something old and he was just noticing it now? Either way John found it disturbing. His life was complicated enough without him falling in love with Sherlock. He just had to wait until the feelings died out, which they probably would during the day. He had just been dazzled by the attention and charm that Sherlock used sometimes. He had seen countless men and women succumbing to Sherlock's charm when he chose to use it. This was just the first time they were used on him.
- I haven’t. I don’t see why I should sit and do Smalltalk with a stranger just so we might have sex afterwards. John could see Sherlock’s logic, but it raised more questions.
Sure doc!
I think you still want to be with me, and I want to be with you. The only issue is this notion of yours that I’m not safe. But I say I am. I have several inches on you, I train in martial arts. If you try to hurt me again I can defend myself.
“Well you didn’t, did you?” The bitterness in his voice was easy to hear. Sherlock was lost for words. This had gotten so out of hand.
No I don’t. You seem to have a notion that because you have issues you have to punish yourself for it. A bit of fire crept into Sherlock’s voice, he stood straight with his chin lifted, defiant.
Dr Watson, are you still there? I’m about to lock up. It was the securityguard. John cleared his throat before answering.
Very good, he answered instead.
- I hope you’re not allergic? I know I’m living up to the stereotype of a spinster with a cat. But it’s nice with some company. John smiled in response.
“Hello” he said. His smile faltered almost at once since he didn’t get a response from John.
- Do you think anyone in there did it? John asked before Sherlock had a chance to say anything. Sherlock shrugged
- Only if you tell me why you did it. Sherlock seemed to think for a moment. Then he nodded.
It’s… I… Sherlock stammered, seemingly struggling for words. His chest was heaving and his cheeks were red. He took a deep breath before he continued.
- Just forget about it, he said.
- First the sister. She is heavily in debt and need the money. When she is sober she seems bright enough to pull this off. She didn’t know her father was going to die so soon and she felt she couldn’t wait for the inheritance.
“Thats what you've been doing these two years, you just kept on fighting Moriarty?”
"I, um, need some help. I have a hard time concentrating in your class and I’m falling behind." He looked up at John with longing in his eyes.
- There is one stamp missing, the rarest one in our father’s collection. It’s a post office from Mauritius. There are only 13 like it in the world. If it would have been sold, we would have heard about it. Sherlock leaned forward
- Where are we going? Sherlock gave him a long look.
“Okay” Sherlock said slowly. He had a hard time jumping between feelings the way John did. He was still stuck at fantasising about John naked.
"Can I help you with your concentration issue, is it something special?" Mr Holmes looked up at him alarmed, pink colouring his cheeks.
You were attacked, that could never be your fault, he said. He didn’t dare to move any closer to Sherlock. Even though shame was the most prominent feeling in him, he could still feel the urge to hug Sherlock, kiss him. He walked behind his desk instead, increasing the distance between them. Sherlock rose from his seat, walking towards John.
- Thanks, I took your favourite. Question answered John thought while he put his jacket on. Sherlock did the same and they went out in silence. The silence stretched as they walked down the street. John tried to find something to say but his mind was blank. Sherlock seemed just as lost for words, or maybe he was calm with the silence.
It had been two weeks since Sherlock had asked if he could stay in John’s office from time to time. That had apparently meant that he would show up almost every day, pace around John’s office or sit in the chair facing John and stare out into the air. He rarely spoke, just muttered under his breath sometimes. John had the feeling that this was what Sherlock did at home and now he had just moved location to John’s office. He didn’t seem aware of John most of the time. John didn’t say it out loud because he didn’t want to make Sherlock stop coming but his presence made it really hard for John to concentrate. It was even worse the days Sherlock didn’t show up, then he just sat staring at the door waiting. Now he was giving into his urge to ask Sherlock questions instead of grading papers.
- Yes, I’ve had sex, with men and women. But only while I was using. And before you go all doctor on me, I’ve taken the entire test since I got clean. John kept silence. He didn’t know what he had expected, but he was surprised. Luckily they arrived at the restaurant a moment later. When they were seated Sherlock started to deduce the other guests and the conversation was effortless after that. John was reminded of how nice it was to spent time with Sherlock when there wasn’t a case to distract them. He was surprised to find that they soon were the only two guests left, time flew. He took the bill and Sherlock didn’t argue. He had probably read up on etiquette on a first date. They decided to walk home as well. John felt it was a chance to clean his head. He had a lovely evening and he didn’t want it to be over just yet.
“One year, eleven months and five days,” Sherlock couldn’t resist this time. John’s hand stilled.
"He stole some bodyparts" Mr Holmes smile widened at that.
- Is this just to humour me? Are you feeling sorry for me?
- I guess I do, Marge said she and Thomas had hired a private detective to find something missing from their father's possessions. John looked puzzled at Sherlock who couldn’t hide his smile.
Yes, enough for a lifetime, far too much. John’s throat actually thickened up, when he spoke. Memories came flooding back to him.
- Do you ever sleep? John asked, Sherlock shrugged.
So you actually asked me on a date?
I do, it’s more lucrative than you think. He rose and walked over to the kitchen.
So what’s your problem then? John explained how Sherlock had made his feelings clear and at the same time saying that they didn’t matter. And then how he continued to flirt with John but made no other move. Molly listen and asked questions. And when lunch was over John felt a little bit more at ease with himself. It made it easier to smile at Sherlock who was standing outside John’s office fiddling with his phone.
You have nothing to apologize for, this is all on me, he said, his voice straining from guilt rising in his throat.
- What made you so upset? Sherlock asked a hint of concern in his voice. That made some of the anger seep out of John. He let out a long breath of air before he spoke
Of course I was, why wouldn’t I? John shrugged his shoulders.
Do you want to know how? John wasn’t really interested in crime solving. But if it would get Sherlock to speak he was up for anything. And to listen to Sherlocks deduction was nice, to get a glimpse inside that man's head. He leaned back and nodded to Sherlock who started talking in a fast pace. John wondered if he ever stopped for breath. Sherlock talked on his own for over five minutes. John got pulled into the story. When Sherlock had finished John was sitting with his arms on his knees, leaning towards Sherlock.
- A fake diamond, Sherlock whispered.
“I had to feel it for myself. I knew as soon as your feet left the ceiling that you would die. But I thought that if someone could survive that fall it could be you. You could have produced a miracle in some way. They didn’t want to let me touch you but I had to see it for myself. And it was gone, you didn’t have a pulse, you were dead.” John stopped talking, his breathing ragged. Sherlock suspected that he fought not to cry.
“I thought you would be at Baker street” This was harder to admit. The discrepancy between his imagination and reality made him feel foolish. John stopped pouring, but down the bottle and faced him. He looked angry but the expression fell as he saw Sherlock.
- John, if you’re not going to say “no” or “oh god, yes please more” then shut up. John realized that being bossed around like this by Sherlock was a big turn on so he did shut up and focused on the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. He kissed Sherlock’s chest and grinned with satisfaction when Sherlock gasped for air. He didn’t have time to savour the feeling for soon Sherlock was pushing him down onto the kitchen chair. At the same time we was working at the fly on John's trousers, pulling them down. John could feel his pants going the same way. Sherlock fell down on his knees pushing John’s legs apart so he could get closer. It took a moment for John to realise what Sherlock was about to do.
- Could you explain to me why we are visiting Mrs Gordon's childhood friend? Sherlock was about to step out of the elevator but he stopped and turned around.
“It was true what I said, when I said it. It turned out after a while that I had been wrong.” Sherlock went quiet, trying to find the right words for his feelings towards Irene.
Those feelings you talked about yesterday, John started, swearing to himself because he was so bad at talking about feelings. Sherlock didn’t help him. He just stood there motionless.
“You told me that you were married to your work, that you don’t have time for romance. And you haven’t shown any interest in anyone. You didn’t even seem that interested in Irene in that way.”
So a former drug addict stole body parts with my card and I’m supposed to let you stay on the course because otherwise a lower worker in the government will put pictures of children doing god knows what on my computer? John could see the corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitch in a suppressed smile.
- Do you have any idea when the theft occurred? Mr Jackson looked surprised at John, like he had forgotten that he was there.
I got the adress, I’ll see if I can make it. Sherlock hung up and turned around to face John.
“I don’t know how much of myself physically I can give. However, I didn’t think I liked kissing ten minutes ago. If you want me like this, I’m yours.” Sherlock felt exposed in a way he had never done before. He had never been as frightened over an answer before either. It was both frightening and liberating. He knew that even if John would turn him down, he would do it gently. John didn’t answer, instead he moved so he stood in front of Sherlock, then leaned in and kissed him softly. Sherlock flinched as the weight of John made him press his back harder against the doorframe. John immediately stood back.
- The others were never interested but I loved it. That’s why... She trailed of.
- How did it go? John asked, closing his book.
“Either you show me or I come and look anyway.” Sherlock’s voice wasn’t more than a whisper. He was scared and angry and it made it hard to talk. John met his eyes, daring him to do anything. There weren’t many times Sherlock used his larger frame against John. He had felt it was polite to let John think he would win in a fight between them. Now he didn’t care. He took the two steps he needed to be up close with John and pried his arm away from his body. He pulled up John’s sweater with force. John tried to pull away but he was trapped between Sherlock and the counter and didn’t have much room to maneuver. When he had confirmed his fears Sherlock took John’s other arm and did the same on that one. Then he just stood there with John’s wrist in a firm grip. On both of his arms there were the telltale scars of someone who had tried to take his own life. John took advantage of Sherlock’s shock and pushed him hard in the chest. Sherlock stumbled back, still trying to process what he had seen. He tried frantically to find another reason for scars like that. Even if he could find another reason, he saw the truth in John’s face.
Fascinating. He leaned forward looking at John with keen interest.
- Mr Bryce the older last opened his safe deposit box six months ago, since then we have no record of anyone trying to access it. John nodded to show that he understood. He could see why Sherlock was pleased. It was almost like a locked room mystery.
Well, do you want to do it again? He asked instead. Sherlock smiled, then he dropped to his knees. John stared, wondering what on earth Sherlock was thinking about. Blushing over the things he was thinking about when he saw Sherlock in his knees in front of him. His pulze that was already elevated started to race. His cock had started to grow hard and he willed it to stay down.
Well, I hasn’t been the best of weeks lately, John said dryly. Sherlock rolled his eyes at the respons.
- We will be there, he answered and then followed Sherlock out of the room. He was standing outside the bank, back leaning against the large windows typing away on his phone.
- I was coping.
Can I come in? The question was uncharacteristic, the only thing that gave John a hint that Sherlock was nervous. He looked calm, met John’s gaze without any hesitation. It was like nothing had happened between them.
Well you were the one saying that you had trouble seeing emotions in others, you just have to take my word for it, John said and moved out of his desk and into the isle. Sherlock followed him, careful not to come too close. John didn’t look at him, he just kept on walking. When they reached the door of the lecture hall, John let Sherlock out first before he locked the door behind him.
- Then no. he said, pushing Sherlock aside and returned to the party.
- Do you have any news for us? Mrs Gordon asked. John glanced at Sherlock but it seemed like he hadn’t heard.
You’re a trauma doctor who is teaching, not a very exciting work if you trained to take care of accidents. You have a psychosomatic limp and probably ptsd. You’re clearly military, it shows in the way you conduct yourself and the order you keep on your things. You have a poppy on your bag and it’s not season for wearing them. So where do a army doctor get ptsd at this time? Iraq or Afghanistan? John reluctantly admitted he was impressed. He sat quiet for a moment, wondering what he would say.
I just ran into your special student in the hallway, she said giving John a long look. John tried to keep a straight face but he felt sometime like dread at the thought of what Sherlock had said to her.
“You’re going to say we can’t be friends or live together because of my feelings but we have been friends for several years now without my feelings being a problem. So there is no need to change anything now.”
You need to tell me yes, I’m not good with seeing emotions in people. You need to tell me what you want. Sherlock’s voice was suddenly darker, it made goosebumps appear on John’s arms.
“You don’t know how it feels, you’ve never had your heart broken” John spat at Sherlock.
“What do you want it to mean?” Sherlock shrugged and winced.
Are you sure about this? He asked into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock straightened up, looking John’s in the eyes.
The cab dropped them off at an apartment building after a drive that took them almost through the whole city. Sherlock jumped out of the cab and was ringing a doorbell before John had paid the fare. He only heard the last of what Sherlock was saying.
“FOR YOU! I jumped off that sodding roof to save you and you just… you could have…”Sherlock started to feel short of breath again. His line of vision was getting smaller. He could see darkness growing in his peripheral vision.
- we told everyone that you are friends of ours and that you are romantically involved. We can’t tell anyone the truth and it’s politically correct these days to have gay friends you know. Sherlock pressed his lips together to a thin line but he didn’t say anything. John wasn’t sure what bothered him the most, the woman’s statement that was far from politically correct or the fact that he was going to spend the night pretending to be in love with Sherlock Holmes.
For how I behaved yesterday of course, I shouldn't have cornered you like that. John looked at Sherlock in disbelief, did he actually think what happened was his fault?
I know, but I don’t know why. There is something about you, Sherlock said making John blush. He didn’t really know how to respond. Sherlock didn’t seem to expect a response either. He stood up and started walking to the door.
“You’re bleeding” he heard John say. He had walked to the doorway between the kitchen and hallway. Sherlock had a hard time looking at him, for once he could understand John’s urge to hit people. He ignored John, trying to remember if he knew anything about panic attacks. He was pretty sure it was what he had but he had no clue how to make it stop.
- What’s stopping them then? If you know everything? Sherlock rolled his eyes
- Well, I’m making lunch. He said, standing up. He didn’t bother asking Sherlock if he wanted. His experience said that if Sherlock had a choice he would say no. But if John just put food in front of him he would usually eat. And then there was always icecream. Sherlock never said no to ice cream, no matter how wrapped up in a case he was. One time they had been on a stakeout for several days, and Sherlock refused to take time off to eat. So John had gone to the nearest tescos and bought a pair of halfpints of ice cream and a couple of spoons. Then they had been sitting behind a dumpster eating ice cream. John made two tuna sandwiches and went back to Sherlock. To John's surprise, Sherlock reached for the sandwich. When he gave it to Sherlock he accidentally brushed against Sherlock's fingers. When they touched an electric bolt shot out from John's fingers throughout his body. He quickly let go of the sandwich and sat down on the sofa, a bit further away from Sherlock than before. They ate in silence while Sherlock fast forward as soon as there was an empty screen. They both sat up straight when they saw Mr Bryce the older on the tv. The siblings had provided them with a photograph and he had an elaborate mustache that was easily recognized. Mr Bryce walked into the room, seemingly heading towards his box. About fifteen minutes later they could see him walking out of the room. As soon as Mr Bryce was out of the picture Sherlock was out of the sofa. He looked through the other dvds, putting another one in the player and sat down. The date on this surveillance photo was the same as the previous one but from a different angle. They couldn’t see more than a bit of Mr Bryce jacket at this angle. Sherlock rose again and found another dvd. This was yet another angle, here they could watch Mr Bryce walk past and then walk back a few minutes later. John felt a bit deflated. There was nothing special with Mr Bryce visit as far as he could se. And the angle was wrong so they couldn’t see what he was doing. John slumped in the sofa, putting his head against the back and closed his eyes. But Sherlock rose, standing in the sofa, then stepped over the back heading for the door.
I solved the case, Sherlock stretched his legs out in front of him, taking a sip of wine. John got a bit distracted with how very long Sherlocks legs were.
- I love... John started answering, and then he saw something in Sherlock’s eyes.
- Yes Sherlock I lovelove you. John looked on as Sherlock took the two steps it took to close the gap between them. He had pulled his chair back and risen without thinking about it. Sherlock stepped even closer, laying one hand on John's back and the other one gripping the nap of his neck. John tried to remember how to breathe but he found it difficult. First Sherlock kissed him in the same way they had kissed a few times now. Then he moved away, just an inch.
- What about him? John just sighted as an answer, Sherlock took the hint and continued.
I rarely eat. My landlady usually makes something for me. John didn’t comment on that, he thought that there would be a later time that he could talk to Sherlock about taking care of himself. He didn’t want to do it on their first date, if this even was a date, he guessed so. Instead he rose, taking on of the folders Sherlock was holding. He leaned in kissing Sherlock softly on the lips. He had been thinking quit a lot about if he should make any advances tonight. He had felt that it might be safest to let Sherlock take all the initiatives. But he dared one kiss, not letting it turn into something else. They both sighed as John ended the kiss, smiling at each other. Sherlock had just leaned in to kiss John again when his phone rang. Sherlock answered it, looking irritated.
- We have to go through the security footage first thing in the morning John, se if anything feels odd. John murmured an answer, then he fell asleep while Sherlock’s voice washed over him like one of those tapes with ocean sounds.
“Please” he said but Sherlock wasn’t sure it meant please stop or please don’t stop. Airing on the safe side he stopped. John opened his eyes and met Sherlock’s eyes. He looked a bit embarrassed but smiled non the less.
I won’t kick you out, your brother saw to that, John said dryly. He could see Sherlock straightening up at once.
"Did it go okay?" He said. Mr Holmes nodded, his eyes looking around the room, not fixating on anything.
Listen to us, you make me sound like a lovesick fifteen year old.
- Please, Sherlock said. He looked honest as far as John could tell.
- I don’t trust my observations. He said quietly, straightening up.
Your tone suggest you already know. I don’t know why you want me to repeat it? Sherlock looked bored. It made John close his hands on the edge of his desk to fight the impulse of shake some sense into the man.
So this is what you do? For a living? Sherlock nodded.
Yes, please come in and close the door. Sherlock did as he was told. The nervousness from yesterday was gone. He looked as calm as his brother had done before. John started to suspect that he had been more fooled that he had first thought.
… that it looks a lot messier when other people do it. It took a moment for John to realise what Sherlock was saying.
- Well, It’s not been as obvious for everyone else. I have known who my father was since my teens. But it’s been a secret for everyone else. On the outside it just looked like a man being extra nice to his daughter's friend. Miss Williams smiled but she looked sad and John thought it can’t have been easy living with that secret your whole life.
I thought we might order take out and just hang out, isn’t that what people do? John smiled.
“Can you sit down please?” he met Sherlock’s eyes and his started to twinkle. And then Sherlock could see the humour in the situation. John always made everything brighter. He could hear John’s sharp intake of breath when he saw Sherlock’s back.
- We were invited to a dinner party tomorrow, John said. Sherlock glanced up quickly from his phone.
- Just wait until I can get my hands on you properly, he said. Sherlock’s grin widened.
I told you, Mycroft is worried I’ll start using if I get bored. Sherlock said this with such ease. John would have thought he would be a bit embarrassed about this fact.
A week passed, John had to drag himself out of bed in the mornings. Force himself to attend his lectures and not just hide in his office. Even though his office was only marginally better to be in than to be in the lecturehall. Sherlock was attending every lecture, not looking at John at all, but still being a clear presence in John’s mind. It felt like torture seeing him there and not being able to talk to him. He fled to his office as soon as he got the change, not wanting to run into Sherlock on the grounds. But his office held the memories of Sherlock. He had rearranged John’s bookcase in his liking and John hadn’t the heart to change it back. Even though he thought of Sherlock every time he glanced up from his computer and saw it. If he closed his eyes, he could see Sherlock standing in the doorway or sitting in the chair opposite John’s. It was a relief when the day ended and he could go home. It was the friday on the second week since the attack (the word John used for the incident) when John heard a knock on his doorframe. He looked up, feeling himself go cold and hot the same time as he saw Sherlock stand in the doorway.
“Jesus christ Sherlock, that was…” He shook his head and pulled his hands through his hair. Sherlock thought it must be a new habit.
"Then you don’t know how it is to be an older sibling, you never get over the responsibilities. Especially when you have a brother like Sherlock. Pray, what did he do this time?" Against his own judgement, he seemed to lose it when dealing with either of the Mr Holmes, John answered.
“Sometimes you can be so stupid, and so blind” John said. Sherlock didn’t understand what he was saying. He was thinking of a reply, assuming John meant that their friendship was ruined now. But then John leaned into him and Sherlock's mind went completely blank. He stopped breathing as John came closer, he had risen from his seat and was now hovering over Sherlock, mere inches from Sherlock. John stopped when he was so near that Sherlock could feel his breath on his face.
“That’s not what I meant” John said forcefully.
- I know they are talking about theft but he gave it to me. You believe me, right?
- Sherlock, John tried. He got a murmur for an answer.
“I couldn’t stay. It felt haunted, I felt haunted.” The silence stretched between them. Sherlock wondered where all his things were. His science equipment and his violin. He wondered how he would ever make up for what he put John through, if he could fix him.
- Out, come on John! John had to hurry to keep up. Sherlock was waving down a cab when he exited the apartment. Sherlock got in and hold the door open for John. He said an address to the cabbie that John didn’t recognise. It was in a posh part of town so he had his suspicion, but he still asked.
What did you expect? He asked, shortly. Sherlock’s eyes locked in his. He seemed to be searching after something.
Well, you knew I’ve been to Afghanistan I just guessed you could see it on me, John said with a smile.
I’m sorry, Sherlock said. John startled. He had prepared a speech for Sherlock which started with the same words. It threw him for a loop. Did Sherlock say he was sorry or did he know what John wanted to say and beat him to it.
No I don’t. Sentiment is unimportant. Can we just focus on why you shouldn't kick me out of your course.
- I slipped up, sorry about that. John opened his mouth but couldn’t find an answer.
“Say what” John looked around the room. Seemingly searching for some inspiration or courage.
- When people say forget it, it usually means they won’t, Sherlock started but John couldn’t take it anymore
- It was obvious from the photo we saw earlier, the similarities was striking. Same nose, same mouth, Sherlock intervened. Miss Williams didn’t seem to mind.
- If we didn’t live together, I would ask you if you want to come up for tea. John smiled at Sherlock who looked a bit concerned.
- mhm, John murmured.
- Mr Holmes. She was still ignoring John, which was fine with him. That gave him time to sit and observe the people in the room. He felt a strong dislike towards Mrs Gordon, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. She reminded him of Harry.
- You do look good you know. Sherlock laughed as John had hoped.
- You’re usually quite well with touchy feely stuff. He looked up from his phone but didn’t stop typing.
- It’s not money that’s holding them back, the brother has money. You saw his cufflinks? They were new, you don’t buy anything like that if you’re low on funds. Sherlock gave John that look that said “You knew that”. It usually just rubbed John the wrong way but tonight he had to close his fists since the urge to punch Sherlock was strong.
- A date? Sherlock finally looked up, his face was blank.
No I know, John said. He had guessed as much, since Sherlock called him John and had done since the first day. The fell into silence. John working, he didn’t know what Sherlock was doing. He looked like he was thinking hard but John had no idea what kept his mind occupied for so long.
Sherlock stop, John’s voice sounded more certain than he felt.
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was barely a whisper. Still, his voice made Sherlock feel at ease, at home.
- How did you know?
Yeah guess so, John really wasn’t that bothered with that rule. There were other things more worrisome, that brother being one of them.
“They tortured you?” John’s voice was weak.
“Just shut up Sherlock.” John’s words sounded like a growl said into his hands.
- I don’t know Sherlock. Can you please just let me be and let me sleep? Sherlock glared at him
- This is Mr Bryce, his wife, his sister Mrs Gordon and her husband. Mr Jackson pointed out the person attached to the name.
- It’s time to contact Lestrade, Sherlock said as the waited for the elevator to descend.
“Love” Sherlock corrected him.
- I... I don’t know. I think I was disappointed but... he raised his voice a bit. He didn’t want to say things to Sherlock that got his hopes up.
“I don’t know.” John smiled a faint smile.
- It there anything else we need to know? Mr Jackson started to shake his head but Mr Bryce spoke up.
“Do you mean to say that you loved me?” John said after some silence.
It threw John of, the only other time he had seen that look on someone's face was the girls that had had a crush on him when he was a soldier.
- Worth the wait, Sherlock said with a sheepish grin. John felt himself smile just as sheepishly.
- It’s going to take us forever to watch all of this.
So if I wanted to kiss you, you wouldn’t stop me? Push me away or threaten to expel me again?
“Guess I have to go first then.” He paused, seemingly to pluck up the courage to continue.
What? John’s voice rose without him wanting it. He was grateful Sherlock had started to close the door as soon as he entered John’s work room. Sherlock stopped and looked at John, he didn’t seem to think that was an odd response.
They started texting several times each day. John would be in class, feel his phone buzz and smile out of the blue. Molly commented on John’s change in mood, he couldn’t be bothered to hide it. Sherlock seemed to be busy, he only showed up in John’s lectures at the last minute and disappeared as soon as John finished. He texted John about his case, about a policeofficer he seemed to like but still irritated him, or just random observations. In between came texts were Sherlock would tell John that he missed him or things he wanted to do to John.Those texts usually came at night to John’s relief. Some things Sherlock said made him so aroused he had to wank to relieve the pressure. He had asked Sherlock when they could meet but only got “after the case” as response. Then one day when John was beginning to wonder if he was ever going to be alone with Sherlock again, a text that just said “221B Bakerstreet, 6 o’clock”. It made John’s heart skip a beat and he spent too much time picking out clothes. He wanted to look nice but he was unsure what he was going to. Was it a date? Were they staying at baker street? He took a cab, arriving ten minutes early. An older woman opened the door.
“For what?” John actually met Sherlock’s eyes then. He looked surprised in the middle of all the hurt, grief and anger.
“Mycroft estimated that it would take me two years to finish all of the cells. I hoped I would get done before that.” They sat in silence for a while. John finished with the bandages, Sherlock could hear him closing the first aid kit. John put one hand on his arm, resting it there for a bit before he stroked Sherlock’s arm down to his wrist. He checks Sherlock’s pulse again. Sherlock remains still, at a loss what to do.
Wha, what are you doing? He stammered.
"Well, your results are great so I don’t think you need to worry." John spoke calmly, trying to catch the man’s eyes.
“Not this” was his first and honest answer. It made John chuckle.
- You are, well you are an attractive man. I think a stone would be affected if you looked at it the way you looked at me. Sherlock gave John a weak smile.
John was still moving his hands up and down Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock hoped he would never stop. Maybe it was the time appart but he was more aware of John’s physical presence now. Or maybe he had just forgotten how affected he got by John. It felt like his fingers were firing a smal electrical current. Still a bit dazed, he met John’s eyes. They were dark and serious. Sherlock grabbed hold of John’s sweater before he had a chance to back away. Then, without a proper thought, just acting on a hunch. He leaned in and kissed John. He had always trusted his hunched, they were just answers to facts he hadn’t processed yet. This one surprised him though, he hadn’t really enjoyed the first kiss. But this one was different, not as rough. John stood frozen, his hands had stopped their wandering. Sherlock hoped that he would snap out of it and take charge of the kiss. He knew kissing could involve more than this simple pressing of lips together, but he had no idea how to get from point A to point B. Then John seemed to wake up and he tilted his head a bit and then they fitted together much more nicely. Sherlock placed his hand at the nape of John’s neck to prevent him from pulling back too soon. This had just gotten interesting, he didn’t want it to end just yet. This was far nicer than it had been before and he thought that his suspicions about John’s abilities had been right. John was touching his face and weaving his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. It gave him goosebumps.  When Sherlock felt John’s toung against his own he made a sound that should have been embarrassing if John hadn’t made a similar sound. Sherlock put one arm around John’s waist and pulled him closer. They both gasped and broke off the kiss when they felt the telltale sign of the other one's arousal. They looked at each other for a moment before they closed the gap between them and kissed again. Sherlock’s head was spinning, he wondered why they had never done this before, and if they would ever do it again. Could he ever live without this now that he knew how addictive it was. He tried to touch every ince of John he could reach. Only above the belt, he didn’t dare to do more than that. John had one arm cupped around Sherlock’s cheek. The other one slid down Sherlock’s back to press him against John. Sherlock couldn’t help a wince as pain shot through his back. He took a step back and John ended the kiss.
Netflix and chill, he said.
Why are you here? He asked. It seemed like Sherlock didn’t expect that question. Maybe his flirting didn’t go as well as he had thought.
How could I know?
“But I love you in a want to kiss you all the time, sleep in the same bed, and do a whole lot of other fun things in that bed- kind of way.” Sherlock blushed. He knew what John was getting at and knew why he didn’t think Sherlock felt the same.
- As apparent from the sisters jewellery, she is in serious dept. Probably due to alcohol since her hands were trembling. She is trying to drown out the fact that her husband is not so secretly gay and screwing her brother.
“Yes, it’s... good.” To prove his statement he leaned forward to kiss John. John’s hand returned to his cheek, holding him in place. Sherlock felt like he grounded him when the room seemed to be spinning. That he could do this, that he wanted to do this made his head spin. He licked John’s bottom lip and got a satisfied humming as a response and John opened his mouth. Sherlock took a deep breath as John started to play with the curls in his neck. Surely it wasn’t supposed to make him aroused, such a small thing. He tried to reaproach and was rewarded with a groan from John. And suddenly he was kissing Sherlock with more urgency. They had both moved forward in their chairs, now their knees were touching. Still, it wasn’t enough for Sherlock, John seemed to be seated too far away for comfort. He solved the problem by clambering onto John’s lap. It made them both gasp as his own erection brushed against John’s. Sherlock didn’t stop to think about what that meant. Instead he caught John’s mouth again. It had no right feeling this good, especially since he could have been doing this for years without realising he wanted to. John broke off the kiss.
“Well… What?” John looked utterly confused. Sherlock took some comfort in that he didn’t look appalled.
-Welcome Mr Holmes, you’re most welcome. And Mr... he trailed off.
"A student borrowed my card yesterday, he said he was going to study in the practice lab. I’ll talk to him Mr Andersson." John felt utterly embarrassed.
- That was amazing. Sherlock chuckled as he sat down, wiping his mouth. He tried to untangle his legs to get his trousers and pants of in a not so gracious move. In one way it made John feel even more affectionate. This was a Sherlock only he could see, sitting dishelmed and almost naked in his kitchen floor.
“There you go.” John said. Sherlock pulled his hands over his face, embarrassed by the tears and total lack of control.
Mycroft can’t keep away. It was his idea I took this class in the first place. He thought keeping busy would keep me from using. Sherlock had started pacing. John stood motionless, this conversation was rapidly spinning out of any sort of control.
What? John exclaimed again, staring at Sherlock.
“One year, eleven months and five days, yeah i know.” He said annoyed as he saw Sherlock’s face.
- I want more, John replied without hesitation. Sherlock’s grip on John tightened, and then he kissed him again. But with force this time, letting John know what he had been holding back. John felt his mouth being forced open by Sherlock’s tongue, feel his teeth scrape against Sherlock’s as he leaned into the kiss. He stood on his toes for better reach. He gasped when Sherlock’s hands moved to pull at John’s sweater. His hands were hot on John’s skin. John couldn’t stifle a moan as Sherlock’s hands caressed his chest and back.
“I’m not”
It was only one lie, I only lied about going to the lab. Everything else was true. And no one was using those livers anyway. Sherlock leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest.
- The late Mr Bryce, Mr Bryce and Mrs Gordon’s father, used our bank for most of his affairs. More specifically, he held a safe deposit box for his stamp collection. Mr Jackson was interrupted by Mr Bryce.
“You mean that I? That you?” John felt silence. Sherlock felt he had nothing more to say. What could he say? He had offered up his heart and soul and now it was up to John to crush him.
Oh, for an experiment. Sherlock said, not slowing his pacing down. John thought he could grow real tired on Sherlock’s habit of only answering just the question he was asked and not the one that was implied.
You’re serious? He asked after a long silence in which John had started to put his papers together.
- Something is bothering you. You started acting strange after I asked if I could kiss you. Sherlock spoke matter of factly but John knew he couldn’t reply in the same manner. Maybe he was overreacting but he felt entitled to, the way Sherlock treated him sometimes.
Oh shut up, he said after glancing up at John, reading his mind. John was thinking that he needed to get Sherlock out of his office. Maybe he could take a vacation? He clearly couldn’t be trusted around Sherlock.
- I’m not sure. I’ll need to process some things first. He sounded tired and John was reminded how Sherlock loathed these kinds of events. Too many people to deduce, too many inputs. If John felt his head was full, he could only imagine how Sherlock was feeling. Sherlock walked closer, still hands in his pockets. John assumed he was going to mimic Johns pose with his back against the wall so he closed his eyes again. In the distans he could hear classical music drifting from inside. He opened them again when Sherlock’s shoes scraped against his own. Sherlock was standing close, very close. Their toes were touching, Sherlock was looming over him, one hand on the wall to steady him. John could feel his pulse quicken. Sure that Sherlock didn’t bother with personal space, but this was something new. But not unpleasant. It felt safe and exiting at the same time. John met Sherlock’s eyes. It was hard to see in the darkness but he looked worried. And it looked like he was searching John’s face for something, some answer.
- How come you haven’t been on any dates? Haven’t you been curious?
I’ve told you that weeks ago, you’re not stupid John. I used cocaine, almost died and now I’m clean.
How did you know i served? He asked, realizing at once he had answered Sherlock’s question without meaning to. Sherlock’s smile widened. He straightened up and strode into John’s room, sitting down in the chair opposite the desk.
“I shouldn't have done that.” Now he looked embarrassed as well as sad. Tears were glistening on his red cheeks.
I do, he said, not elaboration on the answer. It Sherlock could play that game, so could he.
- Obviously, it’s shame. Sherlock held John's gaze but he was feed up with Sherlock’s mind games and looked away. Staring out of the window and didn’t say another word as the cab took them home. He went straight to the kitchen when they got home. His plan was a cup of tea to calm himself down and then bed. At the corner of his eye he could see Sherlock standing in the doorway. He could feel it as well. It seemed that John couldn’t get too far away from Sherlock this evening. Though the safe distance and kitchen table between them, John felt it like Sherlock was standing next to him, towering over him. He really needed to get away to the relative safety of his room.
- A whole evening wasted listening to people gossip. I can only see one or two who even had the mental capacity to pull off a theft like this. Sherlock started ticking things of his fingers.
"Sure" John said. In his mind thinking of what he was going to say to Mr Holmes when he got a hold of him.
Do you love me? He asked, John nodded. His throat had swollen up again due to all the things he wanted to say. It was crazy talking about love after this short time, but he was sure.
You do? Sherlock looked at him with surprise in his eyes. It looked genuine but John had learned his lessons, he didn’t trust those eyes.
“Sherlock I didn’t mean…” John’s voice trailed off. He abandoned his attempts to hold Sherlock’s hand and put it on Sherlock’s knee instead. It felt like it burned through the fabric like it wasn’t there.
“If you don’t breath for me soon, you won’t be here so please try.” John stroke his hands slowly up and down over Sherlocks upper arms. Sherlock found that he could synk his breathing to John’s movements. It helped him to calm his breathing down and he was actually able to take a real breath. His vision was coming back to him and his heart wasn’t racing as hard.
Did you want to say anything else?
- Okay, do you want to go on one with me?
“You’re not listening, I didn’t want the consequences your knowledge would give.” John sighed. He leaned forward, put his elbows on his knees and rested his head in his hands. He didn’t say anything for a while. His silence unnerved Sherlock a bit. He felt a great urge to fill the silence.
- Give me your best guess. This was one of Sherlock's usual tests, one that John didn’t mind.
“Mm.” Sherlock said. Not bothering with words.
John stood motionless for a while, wanting to make sure he was well gone before he fell into his chair and drew a sigh of relief. He drew his laptop closer to the edge of the desk. He thought he just as well google Mycroft Holmes to see if there was any weight in his threats. Several minutes of frustrating searches didn’t prove much. The older Mr Holmes wasn’t on any social media. The only things John could find was passing mentions in different papers. He seemed to be working for the government, but not in a very high position. That didn’t calm John, maybe he had connections higher up? He was interrupted by another knock in the door. This time it was the younger of the Holmes brothers.
Sherlock, John said after an hour or so in silence. Sherlock was now looking through John’s bookcase. He turned around, a copy of Gray’s anatomy in his hands.
And that you’re on first name base with this student has nothing to do with him staying? John blushed, you could not slip things past Molly.
That was the police officer I told you about, he need help with another case. Sherlock seemed torn. John could easily see that he was eager to go, to work. But the fact that Sherlock hadn’t just kick John out and left told him that Sherlock also wanted to stay.
- He knew he was getting older and he wanted to set things right. He came to me a while back with this stamp, the post office. And he told me he wanted to tell his family about me, he wanted to include me in his will. He wanted me to have all of his stamps since I was the only one of his children who collected. But he didn’t expect to die so soon and now I don’t know what to do. She sobbed and John reached out to pat her knee.
Dr Watson. He walked in before John, stopping at the middle of the floor. As soon John had closed the door Sherlock pressed him against it, seeking his mouth with his own. John’s whole body went rigid with panic. He had to get away, protect himself. He didn’t know where he was just that he was under attack and needed to defend himself. Distantly he could hear someone calling him. Someone called him John. That was odd, everyone in the military called him captain or Watson, never John. That detail made him come back to reality. He had Sherlock backed against the bookcase, his arm over Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock was pleading with him, his voice was low due to the pressure John was putting on his throat.John quickly released Sherlock, stepping away in horror. Sherlock was gulping in air, clutching his throat. He met John’s eyes. His eyes were full of surprise and a bit of fear. John was horrified. He had never hurt anyone else during his flashbacks. His back hitting the opposite wall and he slid down it, his legs trembling to much for him to stand. He could see how Sherlock straightened up, arranging his face so he looked calm and a bit concerned, the fear gone.
You’re early, he said as he opened the door. John stepped in to a nice apartment full off clutter. Every open surface was full of papers and books. Sherlock’s laptop balanced on the armrest of a sofa. At a small table at the door lay a violin.
What did he do? He said with venom in his voice.
“I’m sorry” Sherlock said with a low voice.
I think you miss me, he said, a faint blush creeping onto his cheeks. John leaned back in his chair, drawing his fingers through his hair.
John called in sick the next day, spending most of the day in his bed. He called his therapeut and got an emergency-meeting in the afternoon. But the next day when he walked into the lecture hall he wasn’t sure that had helped him at all. He started to sweat when Sherlock walked into the hall. He didn’t have any outward signs of John’s attack. Though John, more than anyone, knew that the deepest cuts didn’t show. He sat in the front row as usual. John could feel his eyes following him round as he walked addressing the whole body of students. He could not make himself look at Sherlock. He thought he would break if he looked at him. Was Sherlock angry, scared? Did he pity Sherlock? Saw him as an old, broken soldier? Sherlock expected perfection in himself, he would never be with anyone that was broken like John. John didn’t want Sherlock to want to be with him either. He could not risk hurting Sherlock. He had to unpack his bag to find his phone at the end of the lecture and didn’t realise Sherlock had stayed behind until he spoke.
- Honestly Sherlock, I don’t know. Sherlock went out into the kitchen and sat down at his microscope. John took that as a sign that the conversation was over. He didn’t see from his vantage point if there even was a slide under the lens but he recognized Sherlock’s “leave me alone” pose well enough. He looked down at his book, knowing he would not be able to read more tonight. He went for the door instead.
“Then what?” John took a deep breath and leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest.
- A rare stamp has disappeared from a safe deposit box in the bank of England. Assumed stolen. They want me to find it. John turned off the water and Sherlock’s arm reached in behind the shower curtain with a towel. He was grateful that Sherlock at least let him have that amount of privacy. He knew that all the people that thought  him and Sherlock were a couple would talk even more if they knew how Sherlock would talk to John when he was in the shower. Or how he would come and sit on John’s bed when John was going to sleep because he wasn’t finished talking about something. John knew that both he and Sherlock crossed dozen lines each that marked the bounds between friendship and something more. But he couldn’t be bothered. Sherlock was his best friend and their relationship worked. He dried himself and wrapped the towel around him before exiting the shower.
John’s head swam from all the emotions. He was angry at Sherlock, he wanted to push him out of his office and lock the door. The man was insufferable. Another part of him wanted to lean in and kiss him senseless. Without thought, he stood up and walked round his desk to stand in front of Sherlock who straightened up. He was right about the hight, he was a lot taller than John. But he was lean, to John it looked like he could break him like a twig. He intended to drag Sherlock out of his room. Showing with actions what he was trying to say and Sherlock wouldn’t listen to. He grabbed Sherlock by the arm, harder than he had to and started to pull him towards the door. Instead of following John’s tug at his arm, Sherlock leaned in. He placed a kiss on John’s lips, careful not to touch him in any other way. John’s anger mingled with his desire that flared up at that simple touch. He forgot everything about wanting to get Sherlock out of the office, or Sherlock’s inexperience. He showed Sherlock against the desk, stepping so close that Sherlock had to sit down on the desk as not to fall over. John grabbed Sherlock by the neck, deepening the kiss. This was ruffer than any kiss they shared before. Their teeth scraped against each other as John tried to get even closer, taste even more of Sherlock. He could hear Sherlock moan, his hands on John’s shoulders, hugging tight. John’s hand that wasn’t wrapped up in Sherlock’s hair was trying to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt. He got the two top buttons opened and placed his hand on Sherlock’s naked chest. Sherlock gasped, his hands pushing John away. He came to his senses. Embarrassed and frightened of the strength of his emotions. He was breathing hard.
- I need you to tell me what made you upset the other night. He opened his eyes when John didn’t answer.
You know why, John felt a bit annoyed. It wasn’t like Sherlock hadn’t been present when John attached him. He knew perfectly well why.
The police don’t ask civilians for help, John answered. Sherlock just smiled.
- Out with it. Sherlock startled him so he almost dropped the milk. Some splashed on the countertop.
“You bastard, you fucking twat. You and your fucking cleaver plans. I watched you jump, I watched you die!” For every word in the last sentence he pushed Sherlock harder against the wall. Sherlock didn’t do anything. He had learned long ago that John often showed one emotion with his body and another one with his eyes. His body was all about rage, he was well in Sherlock’s personal space, he didn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes so he couldn’t deduce his true emotions. And still strong despite his weight loss. Sherlock felt something trickle down his back and wondered if one of his wounds had started to bleed. It could just be sweat, the apartment was stuffy. Then John stopped pushing him and just stood there panting. Sherlock tried to meet his gaze but John had his eyes fixed on his hand that was nog splayed over Sherlock’s heart. His heart was beating rather calmly despite the situation. He was confident that John wouldn’t hurt him for real.
“You kept count? John sounded surprised. Sherlock wanted to turn around to look at him but John started pulling out bandages and started to put them on Sherlock’s back so he stayed put. And it was easier to talk when he didn’t have to look at John. It almost felt like all the fantasies he had since he jumped off Bart's. He had talked to John in his head every day.
- They want to make sure there’s nothing on the films that we’re not supposed to see. If someone mixed with the tapes they could be useless to us, he said.  John was quiet. He had learned that is was the best approach when Sherlock was like this. He had tried to watch some TV but Sherlock had told him the end halfway through the movie so he went to bed early. The boxes must have arrived later in the evening; it looked like Sherlock had been reading for a while. There were papers scattered around him in various piles. John made two cups of tea and some toast. He put one cup and a piece of toast next to Sherlock, but the other cup and the rest of the toast on his desk, sat down and faced Sherlock.
You’re going to expel me? He said in a flat voice.
You made me think you wanted to date me, you fooled me into giving you my keycard, you stole from the university, this is a serious matter. I could have you expelled. John left out the bit about Mycroft’s threat. He wanted to make Sherlock understand the seriousness of the matter, he seemed to enjoy himself way too much at the moment. It seemed to work, the smile on Sherlock’s lips faltered.
- Didn’t you see the looks they were giving each other? Sherlock sounded both surprised and disappointed.
“Sure.” He followed John into the kitchen. He stopped in the doorway and waited for John to give him his glas. He didn’t feel like sitting down at the table. He didn’t want a solid object between him and John if he would like to continue with the kissing. And if they sat at a table facing each other, he would have to look at John. He didn’t want to do that saying what he had to say right now. But John seemed to have one of those moments when he could read Sherlock’s mind since he leaned against the wall next to Sherlock and sipped his drink. He was so close that Sherlock could reach out and touch him but Sherlock didn’t have to meet his eyes.
My issues as you put it almost got you strangled, said John between gritted teeth. He didn’t want to have this conversation, he wanted to be alone again.
- Well, that’s not a very helpful answer, he snapped then disappearing into the living room. John stood for a moment looking puzzled at the empty doorway. Then he turned, looking at his failed attempt of tea. There was a teabag swimming in some milk, there was more milk on the countertop, he wasn’t even sure he put the kettle on.  With a big exhale, he put the cup in the sink, the milk in the fridge and went up to his bedroom. Now when he calmed down a bit he could admit that it wasn’t only the fact that Sherlock tried to kiss him (or tried to find out if John wanted Sherlock to kiss him? He wasn’t sure) that made him angry. It was also the fact that he didn’t follow through. That made John angry ‘because it made him scared. What was that about? He didn’t want Sherlock to kiss him. He wasn’t in love with Sherlock. Still, he couldn’t deny that he had felt disappointed when Sherlock had said it was just an act. He couldn’t either deny that Sherlock was an attractive man, John wasn’t blind. Maybe he just got caught up in the moment. Maybe it wasn’t Sherlock he had been attracted to; maybe it was just the moment itself? That thought comforted John. He put his pyjamas on, and then sneaked down to the bathroom. Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, his eyes closed and hands clasp under his chin. John felt quite relieved he didn’t have to speak any more to Sherlock this evening. Back in bed, he tried to finish some more pages in his novel but his thoughts just strayed. He put down his book and had just put out the light when he heard footsteps in the stair. He laid motionless, listening to Sherlock slowly making his way towards John’s room. He seemed to hesitate outside John’s door. He could see Sherlock’s shadow in the crack between the door and the floor. After a few moments, there was a knock on the door then Sherlock popped his head in
Mr Holmes, he said unlocking his door and holding it open for Sherlock. Sherlock put his phone in his pocket and walked in, sitting down as usual.
-What? John said, stunned. He never could shake the feeling that he and Sherlock lived in different realities.
Oh Molly, he said drying his eyes.
“I have wanted a life with you since the beginning, a life of… partnership. Though I know that you want more out of a relationship than I have been able to provide so I have chosen not to speak of my emotions. You have made it clear that you harbor no such emotions towards me or any other man and I didn’t want to embarrass you. But have no doubt of the strength of my feelings for you. I do love you and I do want to spend my life with you.”  He stopped talking and dared to look at John. He had his head against the wall and was facing Sherlock, there were tears in his eyes.
“What I’m saying is that it could have been so easy to just be angry at you. But then you kissed me.”
Okay, see you tomorrow morning at class then Mr Holmes, he said and opened the door for Sherlock. He thought he saw a flash of disappointment in Sherlock’s face. But then he looked as collected as ever when he strode out of John’s office without a backward glance.
“Since maybe three months into our friendship. It would have been sooner if I had been better at detecting feelings.”
No wonder your brother is keen on keeping you busy then, John said after a while silence. Sherlock smiled at that and John’s heart skipped a beat.
“It has been hell. And I can’t… I can’t just forget and jump into whatever this is now. I need time”
If Mr Holmes had a crush on him, then John had to stop his eying on him at once. He wasn’t going to give the poor man hope.
"Of course he did, and what are you going to do about it?"
“I took your pulse, that day. When you… When you jumped.” John seemed to be struggling to get his words out. Sherlock almost wanted him to start yelling again. Something that wasn’t this broken voice a tremble from a sob.
- correct! Now we just leave it to Lestrade to find the evidence.
“I’m not sure we were okay before you died. So I guess yes, I think we will”
When John came home from his morning run he found a rather nervous looking man being ushered from 221B by Sherlock. The man was well dressed in a tailored suit and silk tie. But the suit was wrinkled and the tie has a stain. It looked like he had lived in the clothes for several days. The man himself looked like he hadn’t slept for days. He stepped out on the pavement and turned to face Sherlock who was about to close the door.
"An older sister" he said.
“But I’m alive and you’re alive so we can be in this mess instead.” John smiled feebly.
Because I don’t believe you, Sherlock shouted. He put his hands on John’s desk and leaned forward and spoke in a lower voice.
They're messy and only complicates matters. I’m used to ignoring them.
- They are the victims of this theft. Sherlock nodded in their direction and sat down in a chair opposite. John took the seat next to him. He could feel Sherlock bouncing his leg, his energy hard to contain. Mr Jackson took a seat at the head of the table and nodded to the man that had shown them in. He quickly exited the room and closed the door behind him. That gave a sense of privacy tough there were large glass windows out to the rest of the bank. They were seen but couldn’t be heard.
