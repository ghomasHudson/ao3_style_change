"There we go." He patted Sherlock's shoulder. He at least seemed amused by it all and John hurried back to his station to spread the creamed, smooth mixture onto the bread and apricots. It looked alright. He glanced up, trying to see what others had done. He never got the chance. Sherlock was bent over, peering into his oven. His bum was staring John right in the face and the former soldier stifled a smile as he admired that bubbly bottom under tight black trousers. Two buttons on each cheek sparkled in the fluorescent tent light and he realized after a few long seconds that he was totally staring at Sherlock's butt and that there were
The detective’s face heated and he glanced away.
"It's baking, mate." John shrugged. "In a tent in a field. Logic doesn't play into it but humidity might."
John stared at his bum, nearly drooling. It was like a ripe peach in those trousers and Sherlock glanced at him over his shoulder. He reached down to scratch his hip, practically groping himself.
“Cream?” John asked.
He fought back, pushing further into Sherlock’s mouth as he squeezed his bottom. Sherlock relented almost instantly and John broke the kiss.
"Can you at least wait until I've had a full night's sleep and a meal before you continue this ridiculous lecture?" Sherlock rubbed his temples and closed his eyes, trying to push away the creeping headache.
“He didn’t work there.” Sherlock scoffed.
"M'sorry. I'd much rather stay here. Book me tomorrow? All day long."
At first sight it looked abusive and cruel and to an outsider, bizarre and disturbing. A closer look revealed the truth. John's eyes were warm and concerned. Sherlock, though tear stained and whimpering, had an erection that rivaled his dominant's. He was smiling into the pillow as John touched and scratched his scalp. The restraints on Sherlock's ankles were wide leather bands lined with thick, fuzzy fleece. Bottles of cooling cream waited on the side table for after.
“He was an abusive bastard.”
He shook his head. "A, a little longer."
Sherlock nodded. “Very good, John. I did an experiment once where I measured the decay rate of flesh in water. I had to use dead fetal pigs in the bathtub but the basic principle was the same. Owen’s body is definitely more recently deceased than two months.”
The ropes on his wrists made perfect sense. John wasn’t a
Sherlock took an offered bite of toast, chewing happily. He was warmed by the thought that John would fly into a rage and kill a man to save him. “How many times have you been in it?” He swallowed.
“There we go. Now you’re relaxing.” John pushed in and out and then slid another finger in. Sherlock panted. Sweat tickled under his arms and a he arched up in pleasure, clenching his arse cheeks. He peered over his shoulder, watching John work.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and grabbed his gown—
“Yeah, I,” John smiled in embarrassment and looked down at his glass, “I can’t really stop thinking about him. Maybe it’s the dom in me lonely for a sub—haven’t dommed in ages—but he just seemed a bit lost, or, I don’t know…”
“I wonder how the obsiblue prawns are different from regular ones?” John mused. He flipped the single page menu over. There was nothing on the other side.
“Yes, hello to you to.” Lestrade began, “You’re welcome for bringing you to the crime scene.” He rolled his eyes. “Captain Rose and his crew were heading upstream when he noticed something in the water.”
“He must have failed out of Murder University. I hear the education is to die for.” Lestrade grinned at his own stupid, off-color joke. Sherlock and Molly stared at him, not amused.
"Not in the least."
“So are you.” John squeezed his sub’s hips. “Did you steal my biscuits?”
“Who was that? Lestrade?”
“Fine, fine.” Sherlock rubbed his head and stared out the window, fidgeting and tapping his toes.
“If you’re in pain, tell me.”
“Okay then.” John took a resigned bite of the cake and Mike laughed. Betsy wandered back into the room.
"I'm useful here." She said, a touch defensive. "I'm something of a healer, so I can fix people when they're hurt. Or try to, anyway."
John smiled in a charming way. "Army was slightly less stressful than this."
“Oh, fuck, Sherlock, that’s so fucking good…”
He reached up and grabbed her forearm, anchoring himself to her, and they stood like that for a few moments. Mrs. Hudson's mind flew. On one hand, this John was just a concubine and concubines were as common as cows. However, he must be special indeed to have captured the attention of Prince Sherlock Holmes. An idea came to her that was foolhardy but, ultimately, worth it. She hoped.
Sherlock cradled John’s head on his chest, petting at his hair. “Amazing.”
Sherlock looked down and tugged at the cuffs. He shuffled forward, the chains clinking, and looked at John mournfully. “What is
He awoke to rare late afternoon sunlight shining on the ornately woven purple and cream carpet on his floor. His dry tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and he looked around, craving water. The fire was built up again and a cup of tea, no doubt made and brought by Mrs. Hudson, was steaming on the small table at his bedside. He stretched and sat up before reaching for the gold and white porcelain cup. He sipped carefully and savored the robust flavor of the tea. It was bittered from the addition of willow bark but sweet and creamy with sugar and milk. He let it warm his gums before he swallowed and took another sip.
He clenched his arse cheeks and shivered. His pink bottom was facing the room and anyone who came in would see him there in the corner and know that John had spanked him. He grinned and both hoped and didn’t hope that someone would wander in.
For a horrible moment, Sherlock thought Mycroft was disowning him, cutting him off of the family name all the privileges it provided. "W-what?" He asked.
“At this rate, walking would be faster. Are you waiting for permission?” Sherlock gestured broadly to the street.
Dee hit the top landing and turned the corner. She glanced back at Sherlock and kept running. He pounded up behind her, started to run, and skidded to a halt. A scraggly, lanky man with greasy hair was pointing a gun at his face. Both hands clutched the gun and he was trembling slightly. Another addict. Dee was still running and heading straight for a window illuminated with a brilliant orange and gold sunset that likely had a fire escape on the other side.
"Thank you for coming home so fast." He said quietly. "I'm glad you did."
"Father Christmas doesn't follow the laws of science and physics."
“Sherlock!” John snapped his Captain voice into place and his sub shot up into a sitting position, staring at him with wide eyes.
"Nothing." He muttered. His voice was hoarse. "It's stupid."
John braced his hand on the floor to get up to his feet. He found the bit of wood that had fallen and when he got back into the storage room, he pushed the door closed and fit the wood back in place. The terrifying gravity of what he’d overheard was starting to weigh on him. He could eavesdrop on the King. What sorts of things could he learn? What if he was caught?
Greg and Sally stared at each other, each with a mildly amused expression. Sherlock didn’t have a personal guard anymore. He used to, but once he hit his teenage years he’d become a hell-born nightmare. After running circles around a dozen of Greg’s best soldiers, Mycroft had slammed a gun and sheathed deadly blade into Sherlock’s hands and declared him responsible for himself. Sherlock had thought he’d won until Mycroft shipped him off to a strict Swiss boarding school two months later.
Sherlock shook his head. “It would only take one or two milligrams to knock someone out.” He pulled out his phone and looked up the drug. “It’s typical for an
Their food came then, and Mike tucked into his fish and chips while John cut into his Shepherd’s pie.
“Because if she’s not there, you’re going to break and enter—don’t deny it, Lestrade told me about you. And if Wheeler is there, she’ll likely be in Defense since her sub just died. And I doubt she’s taken any suppressants.”
“I think you need to learn a lesson in keeping your hands to yourself.”
This was becoming the longest entry he’d ever typed and he was barely halfway through. He found that he genuinely
The Broads were mostly a holiday destination covering over 300 square kilometers. Cabins and hotels were scattered among the multiple rivers and marshy land and the police only knew that they were looking for a serial killer, likely in a privately owned cabin. Finding Sherlock in that sprawling marsh would be as easy as finding a tourism office in North Korea. Mycroft was on it though, and for all John knew he had a team of elite divers and and dogs and helicopters and James Bond himself out there looking. When they got out of this alive, John was going to sit with Sherlock on the sofa and watch a Bond film. A fire would be going and they would be drinking tea. Sherlock would be curled up beside him, naked, the collar around his neck as he shouted at everyone on the screen. John would let him conduct disgusting bloody body part experiments in bed if he wanted to and bring whatever dead thing he desired into the flat and he wouldn’t complain at all. It would be amazing and John clung to the idea as tears stung his eyes. Sherlock
"John?!" Sarah blinked when they walked through the front door. "What are you doing here? I thought you were off with your sister?"
John realized.
John turned on his heel and marched to the bedroom. He opened his toy box and extracted the little black velvet jewelry case he’d hidden in there. He opened it, staring at the platinum band set in the dark velvet. Shining, chrome-like silver was offset by a more matte, brushed silver. John quite liked it. It had a tiny bit of flash but was understated and masculine. He pulled his own out of his pocket. The rings were identical. Some doms and subs had differing rings, perhaps a thinner or wider band, or maybe a gemstone or two. John wanted theirs to be the same. Equal. He stood up and slipped his ring into his pocket with shaking fingers. He dropped the box and it tumbled over the bedsheets. He swore and snatched it up.
“No.” John said, coming closer to him, slipping their hands together. “Not normal is someone who doesn’t appreciate a genius detective solving her police case in the blink of an eye. Not normal is an adult who calls another adult names like children on a playground. And there’s nothing wrong with those other things you said.” John squeezed his hand and brought it up to his lips to kiss. “There is nothing wrong with
John highly doubted that. Those people out there looked like they would kill him given half a chance but he stripped out of everything. He did his best to not fidget when she took his height, looked into his mouth and ears and hair. He blushed furiously when she asked him to maneuver his bits around as she visually examined him. He wasn't usually squeamish about his body. He was muscular and had pleased many a man and woman with his well-endowed cock. The self conscious sore spot was his shoulder and the red-white scar tissue that marred it. He didn't like anyone touching it or even seeing it but at this point, eye prints on his shoulder were the least of his problems.
Mycroft pinched the ridge of his nose. “Your doctor said—”
“Have a good day.” John left the flat before he could do or say anything spectacularly stupid. Sherlock watched him go. Something painful lurched in his heart as he watched him leave. Something that didn’t want the doctor to go. “Goodbye Doctor Watson.” He whispered.
"Not you too." He grunted.
"Rub it into my scalp." Sherlock commanded lazily. John did, massaging the stuff into Sherlock's curls. The scent of fresh fruit filled the steaming room. Sherlock's hair was soft and thick and John worked his fingers through the plush strands. He rubbed circles over Sherlock's temples and pressed his finger pads against the back of his skull, rubbing up and down and side to side. He scraped fingernails up to the crown of his head and Sherlock moaned.
John made a twirling motion with his finger and Sherlock turned around again, clasping his hands.
"For now." Mycroft set his cup down. "Go. See Mike about your face. I'll know if you don't."
John thought to himself.
"Not a case." John told her in a low voice. "He's being cagey about it."
“Did I say it was? I don’t think it’s my fault. I think I was ignoring you and you were feeling possessive. I think we’re both to blame.”
“Just us and Jazz.”
“Hold still!”
“Shall we try over there?” Violet pointed towards a path that lead to a clearing.
Oculolinctus — licking eyeballs
“Okay. Do you need anything?”
An hour or so later, once the dishes were cleaned up and they were both dressed (John was dressed. Sherlock was in pajamas and his blue dressing gown), both men were on the sofa. John was reading a paperback and Sherlock was laying on his belly beside him on his phone, using his dom’s lap as a warm foot rest. His website was open in one window and he was scanning through requests. Another open window contained collars and leashes and Sherlock was spending more time here, examining the images of leather and velvet and chain on the screen. Now that John had brought it up, he wanted to go shopping.
"Sire, you're not under a spell." Mike said, trying very hard not to laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What's her name?"
“Wh—really? Why?”
“Some experiment.” John rolled his eyes. “I didn’t ask too many questions.”
“Since I was young. Seven or so.”
Sherlock grinned, feeling naughty and submissive, and patted the skin hard enough to make his bum wobble. He smiled and smacked him a little bit, enjoying himself.
“Can’t make tea in here.”
"Are you to be here for the whole night?"
Jim was all smiles again. "What a happy day for me. I should slice off each of your fingers, one by one, and make you eat them. Then, while you're writhing in agony, I'll slice off the tongues of each of your little group members. You'll be able to hear their screams even from here."
Sherlock pulled off his cock and stared up at him. A string of saliva slopped down his chin. “I find the taste…unpleasant.”
“Of course….” Lestrade glanced dubiously at the solid brown filthy boot.
“Yes, yes.”
"It's tradition." Sherlock said, slipping his hand into John's. "Hang some mistletoe over a doorway or anywhere overhead really and two people kiss under it." He kissed the back of John's hand. "The Druids started it, claiming that drinking essence of mistletoe would make barren creature fertile again."
"Were they together? On and off for fifteen years or so."
The shower stopped running and Sherlock went back to the bedroom. John came out of the room in a striped dressing gown, toweling his hair. “Much better.” He said, glancing his his sub. Sherlock crept up to him and nuzzled the back of his neck.
He nodded.
“Toast?”
It required strategy rather than chance and Sherlock was an excellent strategist. By now, three hours after the merchant sat down, both men had not a small amount of opium and alcohol flowing through their veins. A handsome pile of gold sovereigns and silver groats was stacked on Sherlock's side of the table. The merchant, by contrast, only had a pitiful handful of groats.
“Yes.”
Sherlock was looking at him with a perplexed expression and John was sure he didn’t get the reference until, “are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?”
"Of course it was, it was amazing. It was quite…extraordinary."
“Hello Betsy. I’m calling to apologize to you and Mike for abandoning your dinner.”
“What…?”
played in Sherlock's mind and he felt something inside in chest uncoil and become pliant as he watched the unassuming concubine-prisoner handle his clothes. The loincloth he wore left nothing to the imagination and Sherlock eyed the outline of his big cock and his lovely round bum. He was perfect. Who
The other officer patted his friend's arm in a sort of "forget about him and let's go," gesture. The angry officer shot a glare at John and they moved off. He let out a short breath of relief, glad for his narrow escape. He didn't want to have to have yet another ASBO expunged from his record. It wasn't until they were out of the park that Greg and Sally tumbled out from behind the fountain, laughing their arses off. Sherlock stood up, laughing too but not nearly as hard as Greg and Sally.
“Joh—No. No, not him. I don’t even like John!” Sherlock wailed into the phone.
“No.” Sherlock murmured. “And compared to how you type, five words a minute would be ‘clattering up a storm.’
“No.” He said coldly. “I asked him to be my submissive and he graciously accepted. May I get by?”
"Hmmm." John rubbed his stubbly cheek into Sherlock's neck. "Lovely tradition. Let's hang it all over the palace so I can kiss you everywhere."
“Very.”
“Do you want me to put it on you?” He asked. Sherlock nodded. He bowed his head and John buckled it on. His fingers were trembling and he really hoped the sales girl wouldn’t see.
“Oh, just…something.”
. I was captured by an arsehole, I lost my whole team," his voice broke but he pressed on, "Jim, that bastard, put me in this…this shit hole filled with whores, and I'm not going to let anyone fucking touch me." He sank onto the chest again, hugging his arms around his bare stomach.
"Fascinating." John said. "Why's it hanging above the door?"
John let out a small sigh. He was off work today and before he learned what was logical or not, he was going to fix himself a cup of that really good coffee he'd gotten from the staff Christmas gift thing at work yesterday. Everything was better when he had coffee. He added a couple careful scoops of the expensive grounds to the machine and flipped it on. He glanced at the kitchen table and blinked. There were papers all over the surface. Was Sherlock up all night solving a case? They'd nothing on. He looked closer at the strewn pages and realized there were several pictures of jolly Father Christmas and a reindeer mixed in with pages and pages of calculations.
“Dear Christ, is that an eyeball?” John squinted down at the brown iris staring up at him from a powder blue egg cup.
"Did you win a lot?" John asked.
"It's not the children that bother me, it's this bloody costume!"
“Can I…?”
“If you want to switch again, I could.” Sherlock blurted.
Sherlock made a face at the phone, then exited out of the thread and called their friend.
"Oh, hey." He said.
in his nightmare last night and as John looked at him now, breathing and living in front of him, he wanted so badly for him to stay right here forever and never leave his sight again. He knew he was being maudlin. Nightmares were always a mixed bag in terms of his mood the next day. Sometimes he stayed in bed for hours, other times he needed to get out and get his blood pumping in the form of jogging or lifting weights. Sometimes the dreams would bring out his dynamic and he would need to sub or dom to get his head on right. Generally one or the other would suffice, but he was annoyed to realize that the aftermath of this particular dream made him desire to submit to a dom.
“Why?” John asked, his eyebrow up in confusion.
There was a faint sound of paper rustling. “Read this.” Jim commanded.
“You already spanked me—there has to be something besides the paddle.”
“You can always say no.” John told him quietly. “I enjoy sex. I like making you feel good but if you didn’t want to, we wouldn’t have to.”
The doctor took a deep breath. The suppressants he'd taken last night were wearing off and Sherlock was being so wonderfully obedient. His submissiveness was singing out to John's dominant side and he lifted his chin, feeling strong and in control, albeit tired.
“Yes.” Sherlock muttered. John hovered his hand over Sherlock’s dick, checking the heat. It was definitely warm, but it wouldn’t burn his skin.
?” Mycroft asked. He turned another page in the file, scanning words or images John didn’t know. “You’re a member of some clubs that cater to rather particular tastes…tastes that could be termed dangerous in polite society.” He turned another page. “Goodness, this submissive was either very good or very bad, going by the marks.”
Sherlock was watching him with a curious brow up.
“Sherlock Holmes, that is vile.”
“I’ma fall into subspace if you keep that up.” He murmured.
“I’ll say.” John palmed his crotch.
"That wouldn't be fair to you." John said.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock went to the kitchen and John stalked towards the bedroom. His submissive side was content and humming peacefully and it was easy to set that part of himself aside and let the dominance roar. He got his box and selected a fat black plug, some fleece lined black leather cuffs, a small, breathable ball gag, and a short length of thin sparkly chain. He also grabbed a thin coiled leather rope and the crop and a flannel and brought it all out to the sitting room. He set it on the table and grabbed the lube they kept in there. Sherlock was kneeling by the fire, getting the kindling hot and strong. A glass of water was on the table and John drank it all.
It was an odd thought, one that Sherlock didn’t even know how to process. What did it mean? It was a fact, yes, but did he like that fact? Did he want John around here more often?
“Good boy.” He mumbled. Sherlock was staring down at a spot on his shoulder. “Let me undress you?” John asked.
What the hell was this? John watched his sub carefully. Sherlock was never so argumentative about accepting a punishment. He’d been fine with the paddling at the bedsit, and they had discussed and agreed upon rules. He wondered if there was something going on, or maybe Sherlock was just excited about this case.
It took most of the morning to see everyone and by the time lunch rolled around he was low on supplies and feeling nearly cheerful. He put his bag back by his pallet and went to the bathing rooms to take a thorough cold bath. It wouldn't do to catch something someone else had. His thoughts strayed, as ever, back to Sherlock. It had only been two days but after his regular nighttime meetings with the younger man he found he was missing him fiercely. The kisses had been…well, they had been something. He'd never been kissed like that. If Sherlock demanded they fuck, it wouldn't be the worst thing he ever did. He wouldn't though, would he? He promised John he'd never do anything he didn't want.
“Sherlock!”
Her stomach did a funny sort of flip. Jim had these auctions at odd times. He culled some of his concubines, selling people to his horrible friends so his guards could bring in new ones. Some people, like her, had been in Chilgrave’s herana for years. Others lasted only a few weeks or months or however long it took Jim to decide to hold another auction. There was no obvious rhyme or reason as to who got chosen and sold. It all seemed as random as the stars in the sky. On one hand, being sold at the auction was a way out of this pit. On the other hand, who knew what kind of place you’d end up in.
“Good.” John pressed a kiss to a patch of Sherlock’s neck. “You’re not in pain?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. He was being so forceful and dominant. It was hot as hell…yet he thought about protesting, he really did.
” He pointed at Sherlock’s face. “I don’t like it, I want you off of it.”
“Come with me.” He beckoned with a finger. Sherlock followed him back to the bedroom. “Take your clothes off.” John snipped. “Leave your pants.”
“Good lad. This was very bad, Sherlock. Going through my things will always be a punishable offense. I expect you to hold still and accept your spanking without complaint. Understand?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Jenkins’ observations were unreliable since he’d been drugged. All these things could have been hallucinated. He growled and rolled off the sofa, stomping into the kitchen. He needed the case to digest in his palace for a bit. He wanted to focus on something else, something that was anything else. His microscope held no appeal so he pulled out his violin. He’d played all of one song, sawing badly at the strings, before throwing it aside in annoyance. That wasn’t working either. Reading? Boring. Telly? God no. Journal entry? There was no new data to add. He wanted to bother John but he was at work for…Sherlock looked at his phone. Another hour. He made a face and threw the phone on the table. He stormed into the kitchen and made himself some toast. It tasted like dust in his mouth. Groaning, he flopped to the sitting room floor in a tangled heap. This stupid case was annoying. John wasn’t here and that was annoying. He could hear the telly next door and that was annoying too. He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. Some bullet holes would look nice up there. He couldn’t be arsed to get up and get the gun though, so he lay there in a tragic fit of sulky ennui.
“No.”
"‒Oh, Dr. Watson." Sadie, one of the weekend nurses, came out of exam room four with a bundle of cloth and rubbish. "Sarah said you could pop in and use four quickly if you need to."
“Hey.” He sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at his sub with concern and worry and a sheepish kind of joy, like he couldn’t believe Sherlock was still speaking to him. He looked rough around the edges. He hadn’t shaved and his hair was spiky and messy. His eyes looked dull with exhaustion.
"Sherlock," Seb said, his voice all fake concern smothering a laugh, "what happened to you?"
and his cock was soft and small, not at all interested in this kind of spanking. This was awful. He heard John shift on the bed and he risked a glance over his shoulder. The doctor was facing him, his arms crossed over his chest, and he raised a brow when Sherlock looked over. He whirled and hastily focused back on the wall.
“Not now, John.” Sherlock’s voice was low and breathy. “The
"Who knows with him? I asked on the ship if he felt alright and he told me to sod off."
“Let’s get you un-trussed.” John said. “That shower sounded good.”
“Did you have a good day?” John asked.
Sherlock slipped their hands together and squeezed. “What brought your mind back to domming?”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock said. This wasn’t what he expected at all.
“She didn’t find anything on him.” Sherlock eyed a piece of sausage and John took the hint.
John went. Sherlock followed. John dropped to the center cushion and Sherlock straddled him and their lips crushed in a kiss. John grinned unabashed. This was good. This felt right. He stroked Sherlock’s back, noting immediately that the sub was much more confident that he had been last time they did this. Sherlock cupped the sides of his neck, fighting him for control of the kiss. John snickered to himself.
They got there quickly and John paid the fare. “Go inside.” He told him. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
And finally they kiss!
John said “please” at the same time Sherlock said “no.” She listened to John and kept talking.
“I,” she straightened in the chair and stirred her tea. “I heard you. John was shouting and…was it a paddle?”
and content in an excited sort of way. It was humiliating as hell to admit that John scolding him was a turn-on—which was exactly why the doctor was rambling on in his ‘Captain Watson’ voice about rules and obedience.
“Hands behind you.” John told him.
“I love you too, sweetheart.” John kissed the top of his head. Tonight. He would ask tonight. If they had survived this case they could survive anything together. And when times got tough, well, they had an armada of people on their side to help them through it. Mike, Betsy, Mycroft, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson. Subs and doms, old friends and new. John nodded to himself. Tonight.
The door opened and he whirled around as a tall thin man in a dark three-piece suit strolled in, glancing over a file and not paying a lick of attention to him.
“I didn’t think you’d want me going to Coel’s by myself.” Sherlock said.
from both ends so stay near the pots. Have you eaten today?"

"I'm stealing your hat." Sherlock growled.
John bristled. He remembered Donovan from the circus case. She had called Sherlock ‘freak’ then too and he didn’t like her.
“Do you want to use clamps tonight? I promise they’re better with a partner.” John winked.
“Yes you can.” John said reasonably.
“That’s not what I’m implying, love.” John said.
“Yes, but I believe you were in the middle of something, Doctor.” Sherlock pressed up against John and he grinned, squeezing his arse.
Sherlock licked his lips. “Just…like that?”
“Clasp your hands behind you.” John told him. Sherlock did, locking his fingers over his sacrum and taking a deep breath. “There you go.” John murmured. He slid his own gown off and threw it aside. “Relax into it. Deep breaths, in and out.” He rested his hand on Sherlock’s head, gently tilting it down. The detective sighed, his shoulders slumped and a long satisfied breath escaped his lips. His head tilted a bit further down and John rubbed his scalp. “Hush, now. Settle….settle.”
Discussions are had and John comes to terms with an important part of their relationship.
There was a sound like a door slamming somewhere and Sherlock wondered if it was his brain going into some sort of spasm from the blood loss. “Weak, aren’t you? Your dom will understand.” Logan soothed. “He’ll know that you died to save him.”
“Your wife, Lestrade—she’s dating a P.E. teacher.”
“Surely you know smoking is very bad. Very naughty, Mister Holmes.”
“I swear, John. I wasn’t going to use myself as bait. I didn’t exactly want to get eviscerated.”
Sherlock made a face at the thought of Sebastian.
He took Sherlock’s cock firmly in his hand and jacked it slowly. He rubbed his sub’s balls and slid one finger up his crack.
The three finalists were gathered together.
He finished it off, letting the last few inches dangle over his thoracic spine.
Sherlock moved the skull and sank into the armchair by the fire. He steepled his fingers in front of his mouth as he watched John move around the room. His thighs flexed and bulged and his shoulders were toned with muscles used to hauling nets and hoisting sails. How did a fisherman, the son of an adept healer, end up in Jim's herana? What could he have done to end up a prisoner like he was?
"Leave those." Greg said. He pushed the chair back, scraping along the linoleum, and wiped his mouth. He waved John away.
John took a long, deep breath. “Yeah.” The hardest edge of his anger was carved off under her soft words and the quiet, natural submissiveness about her was bringing his temper down like an anchor tossed overboard. “He’s just maddening sometimes, you know?”
,” John clicked the pen closed and tossed the chart aside. “I think you deserve a treat.”
“I, I’m sorry.”
“Yes.” He said through the screen, concerned. “Can I help you? Are you alright?”
John was assigned the last station on the right side and to his delight, the tall quiet baker with the cheekbones was directly in front of him. John glanced from his shoulders to the dip of his lower back to his round bum and long legs. John drummed his fingers on the countertop and hastily looked away. It wouldn't do him any good to stare. There were cameras everywhere! He'd have to be careful. Instead he looked at the mixer and bowls and the oven with the familiar pull-down-and-slide-under door. Camera people milled about, ready to start, and a few make-up people and production assistants ran around. Sue and Mel were in the far corner, and John thought he saw Mary Berry outside the tent.
“Because of you, Logan is behind bars.”
John took a bite and nodded. Anything to speed along the solving of this dangerous case was fine with him.
"Yes." He said, slipping it back into the envelope. Isabelle and Alexandra Holmes-Smallwood, aged sixteen (Izzy was older by twelve minutes), attended school on the Continent for most of the year. Izzy was a genius like her father and had inherited his sense of diplomacy, economics, and her mother's social graces. She was well on her way to sit on the Britannian throne and Sherlock thanked the stars every day that it was her, not him, doomed to do so. The tedium of being king would drive him to throw himself into the moat. Isabelle would be an excellent queen.
“No, John…” Sherlock tried to lift his arm and failed. He was too weak to move it so he simply pointed at his dom’s leg. John looked down. A short knife handle was poking out of his bloodstained jeans, the blade embedded in his calf.
.” John snapped his fingers and pointed at the floor. Sherlock stared at him, bristling and riled. The part of him that loved his partner was cautiously curious, and the part that was a submissive was
"Y-yes. I mean, you're welcome." Sherlock shoved the eggs back away and they returned to their respective stations, both of them staring resolutely at the floor.
They laid there in silence for a long while. Molly dozed and he idly stroked her shoulder until she shivered and shifted closer to him. “Stay here forever.”
. John raised the crop high and snapped it across Sherlock’s bum cheek. The detective yelped. His cheeks clenched together but he stayed in place even when John laid down another
“No.” Sherlock frowned. “Why?”
“Do me from behind, if you don’t mind.” John said casually. He got on the bed and splayed his knees, resting on his forearms and offering himself up in complete trust. “My submissive side loves it.”
“I’m not proud of that.” John muttered. “He, he was trying to calm me down. The paramedic was threatening a tranquilizer and Greg had to slap me across the face. He said if I didn’t stop acting like a lunatic that he’d cuff me and keep me from seeing you.” He hugged his sub tighter. “I calmed down enough for them to give me a suppressant and I rode in the ambulance.”
John nodded. “Yes, sir.”
"William Sherlock Prescott Holmes, you come to this table and eat this bloody sticky ginger cake right now, or so help me God, I will drag you over here myself."
(See the end of the chapter for
“This paddle, for one.”
Sherlock replayed it from the beginning and watched it through again. “We know Dixon left Whistler’s with his coworkers. We can also see that they split apart at some point.”
“Nothing happened, John! I didn’t want anything to happen—I wasn’t going to cheat on you if that’s what you’re worried about—you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I love you!” Sherlock buried his face in his arms, embarrassed by the burst of sentiment.
“Such a lucky sub.” The smile was obvious in John’s voice. “Your dom soothes you after punishment with lotion in bed.”
He could buy the milk. That would make him happy. He stood up and went to the fridge, opening it. Hm, the container was full. That reminded him, there was an experiment he wanted to do later.
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice tight, “last night—”
“For as long as you want me.” John said.
By this point John was thoroughly tired of baking and he was glad the showstopper wasn't until tomorrow. He had an excellent idea for it and he was already working hard early the next morning when it came time to explain his process to the camera.
Sherlock was quiet, remembering now John slamming Logan around.
"Sherlock was hurt." John said to Sarah. He scraped his hand across his unwashed hair. "In a case. I want to x-ray him." His voice was touched with annoyance and Sherlock knew A Conversation was going to happen in the very near future.
“No, with
“It’s also commonly known at DDT—an insecticide. Defined as ‘moderately poisonous’ to humans by the World Health Organization.”
“Oh.” She blinked. “Sure, thank you.” She handed over the chart and left and John put the stethoscope on.
“Denim?” Sherlock asked.
"True. And I'm lucky to married to someone so nice."
now.” He covered his face. “I’m sorry, I’ll leave—I shouldn’t have—”
“Yes John.”
He made a face. “I’ll call him, thank you.”
“Oh, John.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“How can I get these off?” Sherlock whined. “I hate them!”
John shifted and took a deep breath.  "Your Highness." He said neutrally.
Longest I’ve ever been in it was thirty six hours!”
The stub of a long, dingy opium cigarette dangled between Sherlock's fingers and he put it to his lips. Wiggins, a years-long friend and Barrens denizen, had given it to him. "The finest, direct from Canton" is what he'd said and it seemed he was right. Sherlock had been riding the smooth high for over an hour.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes.”
"No!" Sherlock snarled. "This is what I've come to, John. Examining the finer points of children's tales. I may as well retire now‒there's no coming back from this." He pushed his mug back into John's hand and collapsed into his chair. The book he'd been flipping through fell to the floor. "There's no point in continuing to be a professional detective. I'm finished." He curled up into a pathetic ball and put his face in his hands. John grit his teeth at the melodrama of it all at stared at the ceiling for patience.
“No—!” John stopped him, laughing a little bit. “No—I don’t even know what those last two are.”
“—Ah!” John held up a finger. “Do you want twenty?”
The first day was easy. There was an older woman who simply wanted her feet rubbed for an hour. Another lad, young and clearly uncomfortable with his mother's assignation of a concubine to him, told John to just stand near the window as he went about his business. After fifteen minutes, John politely informed him that should he not wish the company of a concubine, he could dismiss the concubine in question. Back to the herana he went, only to be summoned by a young, pretty woman who had a thing for short men. John didn't want to fuck her, but he did so without complaint when she asked. That's what he was for, after all.
The door opened and Mrs. Hudson poked her head out. “What’s going on out here?” She demanded. Sherlock looked at her, his face pale with shock. John and Lestrade were shouting at each other, both angry and riled. People were crossing the street rather than walk past and sirens were blaring in the distance. Someone must have seen the accident and called the police.
John tilted his head, looking at it. "If you didn't know it was blood, it would actually look festive."
“What the hell does that mean?” John growled.
Sherlock hummed and nodded, pleased at the promise of cake. "I’ll be sure to delete this trip. There’s nothing in Hibern I'd ever want to remember."
John beamed. “Oh God yes.”
“I am a lucky sub.” Sherlock said quietly. “You keep me right, John.”
“Liver?”
They pulled on clothes and headed for the loo. John shaved and Sherlock scrubbed at his teeth, casting sidelong glances at his dom as he lathered his face and scraped the razor over his skin. It was kind of amazing how fast and easy John slotted into his life. If someone had told Sherlock a few weeks ago that he was going to meet a new dom that made him want to get to his knees and eat from his hand he would have broke a rib laughing. The idea of actually eating out of John’s hand though, wasn’t unappealing.
“Yes, you make yourself clear.”
“Doctor Watson.” Sherlock’s voice was firmer. “I will not say it again.”
“Feel alright?” He asked.
"Uh-oh." Jim shifted in his throne, sounding very unconcerned. "This one won't die."
“Beautiful.” He admired his handiwork and kissed Sherlock on the forehead. He reached for the white plastic-y clothesline next and unraveled it. It felt cheap and light in his hands and John made a face at it. He would never choose these ropes for his sub.
“S-sorry, Headmaster Watson.” Sherlock took a deep, shaking breath and John grinned.
"Yes. Problem?" John raised his brows.
A garrison of guards met the carriage in Chilgrave's courtyard. John was hauled out of the carriage and onto the damp cobbles. Three guards, big, burly men, held him tight. They wore the green and white colors of the Hibern flag. John saw his team for the first time since their capture. They were each bound and gagged like him and fortunately appeared unharmed, if not exhausted. They’d walked for miles. He thought of Peggy's body sprawled along the road and closed his eyes. He swallowed the bile burning in his throat and the angry, frightened tears pressing at the backs of his eyes.
"You mean the horse threw you." She raised a brow.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John, thinking. “Deal.”
“I felt threatened because I saw you in a dangerous scenario. So, my Defense was for both of us, I suppose. Mostly you though.”
“What?” Sherlock asked.
"Yep."
“Every day has been a celebration since I met you.” Sherlock said quietly.
“Yeah. I want to take a shower first.”
“Get out, Mycroft!” He wailed. John tucked the blankets down a little further around their cocoon—they were starkers under here and though he was hardly a prude, he didn’t want
"Not at all. My wound was from an accident, and my family weren't miners. What
“Suck me.” He said. Sherlock opened his mouth and happily took John’s length in. He moaned when he felt the leather tug on his cock, pulling it up. Sherlock sucked harder and within moments John was coming in long spurts into his mouth, thrusting in a shallow rhythm.
John paced impatiently on the pavement while Mycroft checked.
“I’ll take the rest of his vitals.” John held out his hand for the chart.
to be information out there about that. He had never really looked into tools or methods that would allow him to better satisfy a lover. He was still exploring his own submission, in a way, and a sort of pleasing warmth filled his chest when he realized that John inspired him to explore these concepts. It wasn’t just about sex and getting off. Being with John was, in a way, calming. The games they played, the crop and the kneeling and the intimate groping were certainly nice and and welcomed, but the simple domestic pleasure of having someone else in his flat was pleasing in a different way. Sherlock would bring the paper in for John and the doctor would make him tea or coffee. John borrowed his card to go to the shops and would then pay cab fare from his own pocket. It was domestic and mundane and all the things he scoffed, but he was quietly realizing that despite the familiarity of it all, it was still highly agreeable. More than he ever would have thought.
"The, the skull helps you think?" John asked.
“I warned you that the box is off limits.” John said, gently tapping his balls. Sherlock shuddered and lifted his bum. “But like a naughty thing, you didn’t listen and now I have to discipline this pretty arse.” John patted his cheeks again. “Lower, please.”
He wanted to shout it from the rooftops. He wanted to plaster it up on all the big screens in Piccadilly. He could have been kidnapped! Where the hell had he gone? John rolled his eyes as Mrs. Hudson called into their flat and knocked.
Sherlock pulled the blindfold off and a pair of warm dark eyes blinked at him. John smiled and kissed him again and Sherlock tugged the knot on the rope, freeing his hands.
Now, an hour later, they were all back in B. Lestrade was in the kitchen on tea duty.
“Oh for God’s sake!” Sherlock snapped, pushing between the two. “My name is Sherlock Holmes and this is my dom, John Watson.”
“You sure he’s coming, mate?” The cabbie asked.
He went out to the sitting room.
“No…no, yes, excellent.” Sherlock stood up and stretched. His spine crackled and he groaned.
Sherlock still looked worried. John let out a small sigh and walked towards the bedroom, one finger crooked in a command to ‘follow’. Sherlock did, eagerly. John was already pulling his box out when he arrived.
“Um, yes?”
"Describe the pain." Mike grabbed paper and his quill.
The door slammed again.
“Ah.” Greg glanced up as Sherlock entered the office. “Back with us? Are you feeling better?”
"What's this now?" Sue popped up behind Sherlock.
“I just wanted answers.” Sherlock said.
“Why?”
John made a face. “Don’t say his name.”
“Ah!” Sherlock kicked his legs out. John knew that telling Sherlock to not be rude was like trying to keep the sun from rising, but it was good to remind him now and then
Logan put the knife down and went to the fire. “You should have said something.” He prodded the cracked, black logs and threw a fresh one on top. The fire roared.
Greg grabbed a week old newspaper and unfolded it. He felt like he was intruding on them, even though this was his place. Sherlock was always so holier-than-thou in front of all the yarders. It was like a different person was kneeling here on the rug, looking up at John like the sun rose and set on him. Greg glanced at John. It appeared the feeling was mutual. If he could find someone that would look at him even half as sweetly as Sherlock was staring at John, he could die happy.
“Sorry.” John said. “He’s been waiting for this for a while.”
The door opened down the corridor and he pressed up against the bars, watching Lestrade amble towards him with a less than impressed expression on his face.
Lestrade regarded the cups with surprise, like he couldn’t believe Sherlock had actually done it.
“No!” He stomped his foot. The chain jingled.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment. “I’ve always known I was a submissive, I suppose. Mycroft was always clearly a dominant. My father was a sub as well, and though I got along with my mother I always felt closer to him. I didn’t really date much until I met Sebastian at Uni. There were messy moments at boarding school. The dominant boys all wanted a piece of me. The other subs hated me for it.” He laughed and John smiled with him. “If they were getting too close though I would just deduce them.” He shrugged. “No one likes that.”
John grinned. “That’s where we disagree.”
Mrs. Hudson won. Sherlock got second. John was fifth. He was a little saddened by that, but reasoned it was better than being last.
"It wasn't until we got on the ship that he got all sour. Watch out, he's being a right bastard."
“For how long?”
“And we’ll find whoever did that.” Greg jumped in and rested his hand on hers on the table. “We will find who did this.”
“Outside.” John snapped. He pointed at the open door and Sherlock trotted out onto the pavement. John turned to Coel, still pressed against the wall. Neither dom said anything and John drew himself up as tall as he could go, staring Coel right in the eye. He blinked and looked away and John smirked.
"You said you'd go." John suppressed an eye roll. Lestrade had invited them to the Yard's annual Christmas party. This year they'd rented out a room in a vaguely upscale pub. John was wearing navy jeans and a red button up. Their coats were draped over his forearm.
Sherlock smiled softly. “Stand up.”
Sorry this update is so late (but this chapter's long and fluffy, so there's that)! RL was very busy these last few days.
“What would you like?” John asked him, waving back. Sherlock slipped their hands together. He would just touch and follow him until John got so tired of him that he tied him up in the corner. That would be excellent.
"Your left shoulder." Sherlock nodded at it. "It's stiff, probably from the cold. Notoriously hard to heat, castles. You probably have better range of motion in the summer months but it doesn't seem to be bothering you. Accustomed to the discomfort of it. You also have a slight limp, though that appears to be recent, given how you absently rub your left leg and grimace at the pain of it."
“Working the case is fine,” John said in a softer tone, not wanting upset him more, “—of course it is, but I want you to be respectful and pleasant to all the personnel involved.”
just wouldn’t do. He strode over to him and grabbed the back of his neck, pulling him into a kiss. A collar. He definitely needed a collar. John shivered at the thought. The detective melted into him and John pulled him closer, stroking over his thigh and bum with his free hand. He squeezed and Sherlock hissed, stepping closer to him.
“Thank you so much for your help.” John said, swiping his card. “It’s perfect.”
“Engaged.”
Sherlock paused and Mycroft grabbed his arm to keep him from reaching more ammunition. "That's enough! You're being a spoiled, rotten brat and I will not stand for it!"
"And you,
“Text me when you know something.” Sherlock strode off the scene, lifting the tape himself.
Mycroft sipped his sweetened tea. He still regretted that remark about the opium. To his knowledge Sherlock hadn’t used since that night after the brawl.
Sherlock went to the wardrobe and knelt down, pulling the box into the light. He rummaged a moment and found a black blindfold and the red rope. He went back to him and took his hand, kissing the back of it. “With me.”
“Yep.” John ran his hand over the skin and Sherlock shivered, both at the mild pain and just the sight of John’s hands on his body. “Beautiful.” John murmured. “How did I get so lucky? Such a gorgeous sub.” John kissed his arm. “An intelligent, genius sub.”
“I convinced him to not arrest John.” Mycroft said, tapping his umbrella on the pavement.
Two guards quickly opened the door, slipped into his cell, and removed his gag and shackles. John badly wanted to rub his face and shoulders but he didn't dare show any discomfort in front his enemy.
John smiled. "Fishermen, actually."
“I may have…” John shifted sheepishly beside him, “punched one of Mycroft’s people too. And maybe shoved a paramedic…they were touching you.”
Sherlock nodded. This was nice. They were both mellow and comfortable again and it was clear John didn’t harbor any bad feelings about last night. Sherlock had wondered if he would get some sort of silent treatment today but that was clearly not the case.
Thank you." He said.
“So?”
"Sherlock." John clung to him. They kissed again, quickly. "That…" He didn't finish and they simply stared at each other for a few more moments. John smiled and looked away. "That was lovely. I…" He put his hand on Sherlock's firm chest. "I've never…become this
“Ah!” He growled out a shout and tightened his hold in Sherlock’s hair, holding him steady as he pumped into his mouth and spurted across his tongue. Sherlock held still as John fucked his mouth with easy, deep thrusts.
"You might be misunderstanding‒poor boy‒but don't you worry." He smiled and his teeth gleamed in the morning light. They pulled out of the forest and headed east to Castle Chilgrave. "Everything will soon be made clear."
“You can go in now, gentlemen. He’s still shaken, so—”
“Y’think I’m a genius?”
"And where, dare I ask, are your winnings?" Mycroft asked. "You're not planning on smoking them too, are you?"
The conversation shifted to John’s work at the clinic and some tedious story about a mother and father who didn’t want to vaccinate their child and Sherlock’s phone alarm blessedly chimed.
“Oh yeah.” John flopped back down beside him. “I was waiting for you so we could both shower the sweat and semen off.”
“I don’t want your money.”
“Experiment…” He muttered. An elaborate glass chemistry apparatus was set up on the table. The skull was beside it, wearing an eye patch for some reason. John made some coffee. The ‘Mad scientist’ version of his sub was back, and gone was the post-case quiet adorable one.
He appreciated the lack of small talk and he read over the pages she handed him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes?”
“Your punishment, Sherlock, is to give me a back massage. After that, I’ll put you in bondage and you will remain in bondage until I decide to release you. Understand?”
Sherlock didn’t get very far, managing a slight bend and twist.
“And Dimmock told you not to.”
"Hardly." She smiled. "I've known for weeks he was leaving. Didn’t know 'til this morning you were going with." She picked a severely wrinkled shirt up off the floor. "Oh! What happened to this? Where’s your valet? That lad, what was his name…”
On the other side of the aisle, Molly sat on a stool and watched. There was something between those two. All day long Sherlock would cast glances back at the army doctor and of course she wasn't going to forget John staring at Sherlock's arse earlier. Now he was eating right off the spoon? It didn't take a genius to see that the boys were interested in each other. Her timer went off and she crouched to check on her pie. A budding baking romance. She smiled, eager to see where it would end up.
"Piss off."
“Who is?” Sherlock watched him walk across the room and go down the steps. He listened. Nothing was interesting enough to make him stand yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock did, and John placed the crop between his lips.
“No you won’t.” Sherlock melted against him like water and kissed the top of his head.
more.” Berwick corrected himself, noting Sherlock’s ire.
Greg turned off the light and tossed the trousers and ruined shirt on his dresser. He picked up the suit coat, found the dead phone in the pocket, and laid the coat on the dresser before going back out to the kitchen. He stifled a yawn and plugged the phone into his own charger by the microwave. He wasn't tired. He looked at his watch. Not even midnight. He made a cup of herbal tea and sat in front of the telly. He jumped through the channels until his thumb was sore and ended up settling on
They didn't have time to say more, as the cameras turned on, the crew disappeared, and the show began. The first step, of course, was the signature bake. John listened to Sue and Mel with a stupid smile on his face as they explained that the first week's theme was pies and tarts.
“S’okay…”
“It’s starting to hurt again.”
Well if that wasn’t love, what was?
Logan held the skin taut just under Sherlock’s ribs and made a long shallow slice.
, and another one from
John blinked at him and his face grew stern.
“I didn’t.” Sherlock insisted. “I took us to
John took a shaky breath and Sherlock hugged him tight, wanting to feel his dom’s body on his. “I’m fine, John. I’ll heal up just fine and everything will be the same again.”
“Owen had a Facebook page. Everyone does now, and of his eight hundred ‘friends’,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “he’s in contact with not only Vincent Coel, but her.” He held the phone out so John could see the image of a pretty blond woman by the name of Ana Olivier.
He shrugged. “Not too tired to shop. Dinner sounds great.”
“So—” John began. He never got the chance to say more.
“Experiment my foot, John Watson.” She muttered, closing the door. “You two aren’t the only ones who have engineered clamps from everyday objects.” She tossed the bag back in the drawer and went back to the telly and her knitting needles, counting out stitches on the powder blue yarn.
Sherlock growled. "Go away." He turned away and put the violin to his shoulder‒
The detective hummed, typing again at his computer.
“Er, I think I’ve seen enough.” Sherlock said.
“I tried to be nice.” John snipped. “A lecture would have sufficed. But you pushed me, Holmes. You pushed me with your attitude and foul habits.”
“Don’t like it?” John snickered. “Me neither, honestly, and you do have something of a sweet tooth. Speaking of sweet, any idea where my Hob Nobs went?”
John looked at him for a moment and then looked away, prowling over to the drawer and grabbing bandages and ointment.
"Beautiful, love…" John stroked his hair again. "Enough?"
“Tall and blonde? Female?”
When the attendant saw John tiptoe gingerly into the room he lifted a brow and ordered three days of medical leave before John could even open his mouth. He laid on his pallet which was near the fire now beside Molly’s, thank Christ. He dozed all day. Molly brought him tea and tinctures and food and put ointment on his sore spots. He kind of loved her for it. By evening he was alone again. He sat up. The fire was banked and glowing. He stood carefully and stretched his back, his spine popping. His arse muscles throbbed and he took a few steps forward, grimacing as his knee cracked and his back protested the movement. He had to move around or he’d turn to stone. He went to the baths and rinsed off the previous night. Molly had doctored him a bit so he was mostly clean. He was glad he wasn’t too tired.
So he put the lotion away and went back to the sitting room where Sherlock was watching his laptop screen intently, his hands steepled under his chin and the USB in the slot on the side of the machine.
“Why should you have told Lestrade?” John asked.
Sherlock’s angry scowl softened and he turned with a swirl of coat and opened the black door, striding inside.
Sherlock was stunned, frozen by Mycroft's announcement.
John snickered. “Up.” He patted his shoulder. “For real this time.”
John left and closed the door. Sherlock counted to five before he jumped off the bed and sat on the carpet, pulling the box out of the corner. Silly John. He might know when the box was touched, but he’d forgotten he was dealing with Sherlock Holmes and not some mere mortal. The box was oak, stained golden, with a darker cherry detailing around the edges. It was pleasing to the eye, yet sturdy and useful. Sherlock lifted the lid on the smooth hinges. A bundle of silk black rope, a few plugs of varying sizes, a few thin books tucked in the side, a red rubber and wood table tennis paddle, a length of leather. He tilted the box and looked underneath the coil of rope and saw at least one leather cuff. He touched a fingertip to the neat coil of white rope with longing. He’d been tied once, a long time ago. Seb had indulged him and the bondage had been peaceful, in a way. Seb hadn’t allowed him to linger in the ropes for very long, as he wanted to get right to the sex, but despite the fleeting memories of the session Sherlock did remember his enjoyment at the constricting yet freeing nature of getting bound up. A sort of paradox.
"Sod this." John said. "I'm going out."
John to live with him. He wasn’t the best judge of this kind of thing.
Sherlock giggled and John grinned. He reached around for his sub’s cock, fisting it and pulling. His hand was slippery with lube and Sherlock grunted and ground his backside against John’s hips and a few moments later he smiled when Sherlock spilled into his hand. They sat like this for a few moments, sticky and damp, until John slipped back and out of his body. Sherlock rolled over to face him and buried his face in his dom’s neck.
"Here," he said kindly. "Finish this before it gets cold and explain to me how it doesn't make sense." John knew by now that the best way to cure Sherlock of his darker moods was to encourage him to talk and them just let him go. Like a wind up toy.
“Hey.” He said.
The next hour was a whirlwind of shooting and re-shooting and pulling individuals aside to get reactions and short interviews. John just hoped his voice didn't shake much and that the editors would be kind and not put anything stupid he said into the final cut of the episode.
“Oh, okay.” John smiled and wiped his sub’s sloppy chin, then dried off his own cock. He tossed the tissue aside and kissed Sherlock on the lips. “Thank you, love.” He bumped their foreheads together. “That was wonderful. Let me get these cuffs…”
“Maybe.” He shrugged, even as he thought
wanted this to work…
"Dammit, John." Sherlock stepped back and rubbed his hand through his damp hair. It reminded him of John's hands in his hair in the bath and he let his hand fall to his side.
John looked apologetic. "I wish I could stay the night."
Sherlock didn’t answer. John began to walk in a slow circle around him. “Is that true?” He asked, stopping behind him.
“Sherlock.” John said.
“I don’t know.” John looked at his watch. “We have three hours until we need to leave for Mike’s.”
Sherlock looked at him with lusty eyes. “Masturbating, sir.”
“—Are you alright?”
He and Sherlock left and John promised himself he'd start reading tonight. He wasn't one of those super-reader people who could read a whole book in a sitting. He needed all the time he could get.
“Yes.” Greg sighed, dumping sugar into the cup.
John scowled at him and Sherlock grinned and finished the rest of his pint.
“Alright?” John asked, amused. He petted his ribs.
“I hope that bitch shaved her cunt. I was picking pubes outta my teeth last night.”
“Fine. Better.”
He was pulling his keys out of his pocket when he noticed the familiar figure sitting at one of the tables outside Speedy’s. Mike Stamford raised a hand and stood up. “Sherlock!” His voice was cheery and Sherlock paused.
is decent, it’s just…all the sitting and….chatting.”
“—John, I’m always rude to them, it’s how we interact.”
to tell him when he could and couldn’t lay on the floor? What did he care? Sherlock dragged himself into the green chair. There. He was upright. More than he had been anyway.
“Mostly. He’s no longer a prime suspect.”
“This room doesn’t look much tidier.” John strode into the room, cup in hand, glancing around at the piled notebooks and papers. Sherlock looked at his damp grey blond hair and the thin Tshirt on his chest. The jeans were low on his hips and a little bit too big. The denim outlined his thighs nicely and Sherlock stared at the bulge between his legs.
“No you didn’t!”
Sherlock did.
“But she wouldseeit there the same way you did.” John pressed.
“John…” Sherlock breathed. Christ, his tone—his body language—John was being such a dom right now. Moreso than Sherlock had ever seen before. His cock jumped in excitement.
“C’mon.” John encouraged. He shifted on the mattress, straightening up and adjusting his grip. “Show me how you get off…”
Sherlock snapped the fingers on both hands.
…Sherlock peered up from his microscope when his phone chimed. John was across the display. His heart fluttered like a little butterfly in his chest and he picked it up, reading the message. Free tonight? He was. There were no cases on. Why did John want to come over? Maybe he wanted to kiss some more. He typed out:
"Don't need mistletoe to kiss me all over this palace." Sherlock grinned and they kissed again, quickly. "What holiday traditions do you have in Hibern?" Sherlock realized he had no idea.
“Yes, John.”
To his surprise, Sherlock nodded frantically.
“Writing l-lines, sir.” Sherlock licked his lips.
“Are you okay?” John asked.
“He seemed really tense.” John mused. “Has he, do you know if he’s subbed at all since breaking up with his dom?”
“-You’re clattering up a storm there, love.” John said from across the desk. “Writing a book?”
“Bare, Holmes. This is to be a memorable punishment since nothing else seems to work.”
King Holmes had been traveling to Hibern often over the last few years and she had struck up a sort of something with Greg Lestrade, the handsome Head of the Royal Guard. He was sweet and kind and a little awkward, stroking the back of his head when he asked her for something in bed and going flushed when he saw her naked. When he wasn’t on duty protecting King Holmes, they spent as much time as possible together. Often they had sex but sometimes they would simply share a meal or go for a walk if the weather was nice.
“Mike.” John showed him the phone.
“Yes, John.”
“Just returning the favor, sweetheart.” John ran fingers through his curls and opened his book.
“What about phone GPS?” John asked before Lestrade could respond. “Can you track his or Sherlock’s phone?”
had nothing to do with anything.
John said something and Sherlock had to stop what he was doing to laugh.
“Yes.” Sherlock said dully.
“Yes.” John growled. He set it on the bedside table and crawled between the sheets, keeping himself between Sherlock and the doorway. Sherlock snuggled up to him, careful of his cuts, resting his head on John’s shoulder.
At that moment, Donovan rounded the corner.
“Okay.”
“Hey, Freak. Told you I’d be by.”
“Good boy. You took that very well.” John patted his back and Sherlock shuddered.
“Oh go ahead.” He handed over a pair of gloves.
“Dull.”
“I’d rather sit.” Sherlock looked up at him, eyes blazing in defiance.
“Yes.” Sherlock sniffed. “Yes.” He stripped and John went to get them both something to drink He was unable to keep the crazy grin off his face. Sherlock said yes! Sherlock said yes!
Sherlock reluctantly pulled his hand up and John grabbed him by the arm, pulling him to his feet. “That’s filthy.” He scolded. “You’re a filthy boy with dirty habits.” John bent him over the desk. He smacked his bum a couple times with his hand and Sherlock moaned.
John stared at him, mouth partially open and boots in his hand forgotten. Sherlock leaped to his feet and kept talking. He came closer to John, walking in a circle around him.
“I don’t know.” Mike said honestly. “It’s a common deer skull. Maybe a bear got it. Or it was shot.”
He stepped back. "Have you pissed blood?"
of hands grabbing onto a body before Logan was ripped off of him. The knife clattered to the floor and John bashed Logan’s face into the table beside him with a loud crunching
Sherlock barked out a laugh. "No! God no! I would be a horrible king!"
"Good." John clenched and opened his left hand, staring down at Sherlock. "Good."
“Do you want me to call him and tell him?” John asked.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft’s voice was absent and he didn’t glance up from the sheaf of papers he was reading. “Are you going to be like this the whole trip?”
“Are you John Watson?” He looked as confused as John felt.
"Sherlock, really, you don't have to. I can just watch telly and eat leftovers…" John rubbed a hand through his hair, even as he felt the pull of obedience and submission.
“Are you?”
"Er, okay…" John nodded slowly.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked.
"Black and yellow stripes." He muttered. He was crouched now, staring at the raw bits in the oven.
Next, Dot went up. She'd been crying but she held her head high. She too was blessed with a clean snap. Her twin, Mot, wasn't so lucky.
“My toy box.”
Sherlock extracted the toy from his mouth and wiped his chin. John crouched in front of him and cupped his nape, pulling him into a rough, welcoming kiss. Sherlock grunted in surprise and melted into him, resting his fingers on John’s cheek, enjoying and returning the affection. Sherlock pulled back after a moment and shoved John to the floor.
“Wait,” John pulled back after a few fevered moments. “Did you solve it?”
“That was gorgeous, love.” He murmured. “You gave me exactly what I needed.” He kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck, making him shiver.
Sherlock laughed. His Rhine was rusty but this he understood. "I agree." He smiled. "His face is indeed very punchable."
He passed the prescription to the nurse and manfully went back to his office, his pride stinging.
“Do you want some tea?” He called.
“How?”
The mood in the room abruptly changed. John opened and closed his fist a few times and his jaw tightened. He didn’t like the bloody mind palace. He understood that it was integral to Sherlock solving cases, but it also meant that he would be lost to the world until
“I’ll not have you brawling outside my building!” She shouted. “This isn’t a bleeding pub! You two are grown men for God’s sake.”
“Yes, well.” Sherlock stood up. “You have things to do, I’m sure.”
contestant and that he would receive more information in the mail soon. He promised to keep an eye on the post, then ended the call and bit his lip. Nerves and delighted excitement danced in his chest. He couldn't believe he'd been picked! Tons of people had turned up for auditions and though the show's crew had adored his crème brulee, he hadn't thought for a moment he'd be chosen, not after he'd deduced the executive producer's secret smoking habit out loud.
“Tell me.”
“Mmm. Yes, but not tonight, if that’s okay.”
"Who fancy each other." She repeated.
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
John had finished with the unpacking and was now waiting off to the side like the servant he was.
“Dammit!”
Sherlock tentatively took John’s hand as they strolled, holding it loosely. Unsure. He sipped his coffee, trying his best to hide his face behind the cup. John squeezed his hand laced their fingers and Sherlock stood up a little straighter as they walked. An adorably handsome, dark haired sub walked by. He looked to be in his mid twenties and his red Tshirt was damp with sweat from the rugby game he’d been playing across the park. He glanced at John and winked as he walked by. John smirked and pulled Sherlock’s hand up to kiss the back of it. That sub had been cute, sure. And if John was single and a few years younger he might have ran after him, flirting and trying to convince him to go on a date. Now though—
"I don't know about that." John said. "Better than Jim, I'd think."
The attendant left John outside the Prince’s guest room. A Britannian guard from Sherrinford palace stood sentry beside the door. She glanced at John as the attendant walked away. John looked at her textured hair, her reddish armor and the blades and pistols tucked away at her hip. No doubt she had a knife or two in her boots as well. She glanced him over, taking in his loincloth and bare chest. She made a small "hm" noise in her throat and faced forward as John raised his hand to knock on the door.
Sherlock nodded and placed clammy hands on John’s hips, just above his iliac crest. He pushed the head of himself inside and slid forward, smiling at the happy noises his dom was making.
“You don’t bloody deserve any!” John ground out.
“The gun, John? Still?”
“Do you have any idea how you got here?” Sherlock asked.
"Thank you, John. I did have a little help though." She gave Sherlock a grin and he rolled his eyes.
lucky—will be the inside of a jail cell.”
“Yes!” Sherlock grabbed his Belstaff. “Come on, John!” He flung the doctor’s jacket at him. “The game is on!”
“Can you wait here for me?”
sub and you kept up this appalling attitude, you’d be walking out of this police station with a stinging bottom and an apologetic tongue. Keep arguing and you still might. Now
“Yeah….” Sherlock cuddled him closer and went quiet. John was sure there was more to that story, but he let it be. “Are you going, I—what about us? Discipline?”
Sherlock had a small bow and quiver of arrows slung across his back in addition to the pistol. He was the only one who did so. These pistols were heavy and he found loading them after each shot to be cumbersome. He preferred the elegance and skill required for the bow and arrow. It was lighter and he could quickly fire one shot after another. He'd first learned to hunt with a bow and arrow and learning to aim and shoot was one royal duty he'd tolerated as a child.
He sat down at the desk. He opened his laptop and began peck-pecking at his blogto document the new case.
"John, I need you to write down every poison you can think of." Sherlock grabbed a piece of parchment and a quill. He shoved aside a stack of books and set the paper down in the cleared space, inviting John to sit. He did so, picking up the quill in ginger fingers. It had been an age since he'd written anything. He got to scribbling, his unpracticed hand finding the letters again. Not that he was all that great with letters anyway. Mum and his uncle had taught him and Harry to read and write. It was a skill few in their small village, Knocksvane, had.
"Take a moment." Sherlock told him. "Rest as long as you need."
The first course of their food came then, some sort of greens with dressing. It was delicious and amazing and John soon forgot about the flirting and instead they both enjoyed their food. John had taken a risk on the obsiblue prawns and Sherlock was right about the truffle butter. Everything was succulent and delicious…until Chef Logan came out again to check on them.
“Did you mean what you said before?” Sherlock asked in a quiet voice.
John still wouldn’t look at him. He’d gone tense and rigid underneath him and his erection had fled. Sherlock wondered if he should get up, if John was feeling pinned and smothered. The light sexiness had vanished, leaving something moody and low creeping over the conversation. Sherlock started to shift to get up—
the concubines for sex.” Sherlock explained. “I’m much too busy. My brain requires constant attention.”
“Ah. A friend?”
That evening, John came to his rooms as requested while Sherlock was in the bath. Sherlock heard the front door to the parlor open and then a curious, "Your Highness? Sherlock?"
Silence.
Greg arrived outside the restaurant ten minutes later in an unmarked police car. A couple other cars pulled up with him and a few plainclothes officers John didn’t recognize jumped out and went inside. Lestrade found John pacing restlessly, looking at his phone.
“I’m always contrary.”
“Stay here.” Sherlock patted the spot in the bed beside him and John got in eagerly.
John yanked his pants down to look at his bum. During the roleplay, he had focused mostly on Sherlock’s thighs but he had given his bum some attention too. God, had that only been this afternoon? It had been such sexy silly fun, light years away from how they both felt now. He hadn’t planned on a punishment this evening. Had he known Sherlock was going to do something so utterly insane and stupid, he would have held off on the roleplay—or at least done something else with it. His sub’s backside looked fine though. His timely application of arnica had made the minimal bruising from that crap flogging all but disappear. His thighs were faintly pink from the ruler. John sighed and pulled the pants back up over his trembling cheeks. He raised his hand and slammed his flat hard palm into his sub’s bottom. Over and over and over he spanked and Sherlock squirmed and clenched over his lap.
So this what he'd meant by 'don't be offended.' Hm, that was proving to be difficult. John wasn’t used to getting brushed off so succinctly. Mike and John talked a little bit about football until Sherlock sighed loudly.
“It was still too long!” John jerked his leg away. He didn’t like people touching it when it was hurting. Sherlock stood up, mildly stung at the rebuke and annoyed that John wasn’t seeing reason. It had just been a dream. A figment. A story. He wanted him to get over it so they could work on the case together, but he knew logically that it wasn’t that simple.
“Good boy. Brace yourself.” John raised the paddle over Sherlock’s bum and landed a smart smack on his left cheek.
Sherlock lifted his head, his eyes bleary. He blinked. “Bedroom?”
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded.
He debated ignoring it but went to answer. A bland servant of the castle was on the other side when he pulled the door open.
John put the empty mug down. With the tea and hot shower and the food, he felt much better.
John then started tugging his own shirt out of his waistband. Sherlock watched, curious, as John stripped off his dark shirt and threw it on the sofa before undoing his jeans and stepping out of them and his black pants. Sherlock looked at John’s body, taking in proportion and size ratios in a mathematical kind of way, glancing from head to toe. His arms were toned nicely and he flicked his gaze over the pink scar tissue gnarled on his left shoulder. John’s belly was flat and only a little bit soft and Sherlock’s gaze went lower, then froze.
Perfect. He jumped out of bed, washed up, and was out of the flat fifteen minutes later on silent feet. He left John to sleep. No point in dragging him out on a case he didn’t like. He was moving in today, and it wouldn’t take long to talk to Molly. He could be back in time to help. John had assured him that he didn’t have many things in his bedsit anymore, as items had slowly migrated over to B over the past several weeks. John assured him that a large cab would do the trick.
"You are no longer allowed to leave Sherrinford's grounds unattended. You will be confined to the palace and the immediate vicinity and if you must leave, you will be accompanied by a chaperone of my choosing." He spoke it like a decree.
He went out into the sitting room regretfully and spread out the fire, reducing it to glowing ashes. He could let himself out and take a cab all the way across the city and go back to his own crappy little bedsit alone…or, he looked at the sofa, he could sleep there. Jeez, had they really made out like that? Like, like men dying of thirst engorging at a river. John grabbed a blanket off the chair and a pillow from the floor and dropped to the sofa. They had, and it had been amazing. He had no doubt in his mind that he wanted to take Sherlock on as a sub to at least
"Molly." John's voice was behind her and he touched her shoulder.
“John?” Sherlock wandered into the bedroom, sans coat and leash. The collar still graced his throat and he had such a wonderful
“How are you?” John wandered into the room with his own half full tea mug. He was in his clothes from yesterday, his shirt wrinkled and untucked, his feet bare on the floor and his hair ruffled and adorably unkempt. He poured more water from the kettle in his mug and drank. Sherlock made a face. That couldn’t taste good—it would be watered down at best. “You can get used to anything in the army.” John answered to his disgusted face, taking another sip.
“Text me when you get there.” John said. “And when you’re leaving.”
“Dunno.” He said. “Didn’t see.” He’d been in the corner of the baths, shaking off a panic attack, though he didn’t tell her that.
