John tries again, this time with a firmer tone.
be disappointed when he shows up.
“You alright?”
Sherlock’s response time is painfully long.
get that warm fuzzy feeling at John’s subsequent praise.
Sherlock will have sudden lapses of inattention. He will look out of the window with a vacant, unreadable expression as though he gets lost in his own thoughts. When disturbed, he will look as though he's been doused in ice water, snapping back to reality with a shock. What his thoughts concern, though, John has no idea. He isn’t sure how to properly classify the look on Sherlock’s face, if it’s longing, confusion, anger, sadness or even all of it at the same time.
So John does the only thing he can think of to convey his understanding. He takes Sherlock’s other hand.
Even the best-laid plans can go awry. Despite thorough preparations through a period of at least half a year, Sherlock finds himself fundamentally unprepared when the big day finally arrives and he has to watch John make Mary Morstan into Mary Watson from the very best position in the front row of the church. It’s vaguely reminiscent of an unforgiving punch to the stomach, knocking the air out of your lungs on repeat for more than an hour.
John holds on to Sherlock just a little bit tighter.
“John?” he asks, carefully. Trying to gauge his state.
to distract themselves from the frightful, boring tedium of their pointless, uninspired existences. He’d hardly given the subject another thought since, apart from its not-too-uncommon appearance during crime investigation.
“Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson, call an ambulance!”
The dam breaks down and a virtual onslaught of pent-up
John’s fairly certain he’s seen more people in the last two hours than he has throughout the preceding 44 years of his life put together. It’s exactly like an action movie with poor visual effects, the people around him bearing a frightening similarity to digitally added extras, each poorly defined and completely indistinguishable from the one next to him until the entire mass of people in the background melts together in your brain and simply registers as “many”. John has been in at least fifteen stores by now and he’s about ready to swear off not only this painstaking shopping day, but the entire Christmas season along with it. Christmas is cancelled.
John fights hard to loosen his jaw.
He briefly contemplates simply not saying anything at all.
But then again. Sherlock’s brain works differently from everyone else’s. This John knows. Who can ever know what’s going on in that brilliant head of his? He’d certainly seemed more than a little surprised to hear that John consider him as his best friend, a fact that John had thought was perfectly obvious. His list of friends isn’t long, half of them are people he has met through Sherlock for Christ’s sake, and the distance between his number one and two is considerable. If Sherlock didn’t get that until John spelled it out for him… well, perhaps Mary’s theory isn’t so far out after all and John vows to let Sherlock know exactly how things stand.
Any conflicting feelings about contacting Mycroft for sympathy and advice evaporate like dew under the sun. It was undoubtedly a mistake. Hang Mycroft’s advice. His lack of sympathy and the unerring precision with which he twists the knife far outweighs whatever coping strategies he can offer. The still-active rational part of Sherlock’s brain can’t help but be impressed at the way his brother manages to both raise a strawman and then mercilessly shoot it down in two sentences flat. Sherlock has never quite managed that scale of manipulation. The emotional part of Sherlock’s brain, on the other hand, adds nothing but pain to the mix and wraps itself around his vocal chords unhelpfully.
John frowns and turns to look at him. “What’s that?”
That night, Sherlock doesn’t sleep. Not for a minute. He’s trying to concentrate, but he can barely hear his own thoughts for that persistent creaking in his head. In hindsight, he probably should have handled the situation better. Been less impulsive, less intrusive, less dramatic, less cocksure. John always resented him being cocksure and Sherlock senses that this evening didn’t go a long way towards changing that. Sherlock knows himself to be bad at analysing a mood and John used to tell him repeatedly that he doesn’t pay enough attention to the effects of his own comments. Still, Sherlock feels confident that this evening’s disaster ranges among those of a certain calibre. Which is about the only thing he feels confident about at the moment.
“No, no, Sherlock…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock holds his gaze for a few seconds, seemingly challenging him to change his mind. Then he looks away again, shrugs, lets his gaze slide back to that imaginary spot in front of him that he’s been observing with keen interest for who knows how long already. His stance could not be conveyed with any more clarity.
“That’s good, sweet thing. That’s very good. The lessons are finally beginning to sink it, wouldn’t you say? The point. Doesn’t matter how many dragons you slay. They may tell you that that’s what matters. They may try to convince themselves that that’s what matters. John, Mycroft, Lestrade, mommy, daddy, all of them.”
“You two can’t do anything simply, can you?” She sighed.
John sighed and scratched the back of his head.
Mike chuckled.
“Daddy! There’s one!” She said excitedly, as a pop and a crackle danced across the sky in a sea of red and green sparks. John smiled.
“You can,” John chuckled, “and I did.”
SH: I’m not.
“Would you mind finding some suitable blankets for Rosie? John’s gone back home to fetch some more clothes for her. I don’t want to put her down in case she falls off something.”
“Oh why is heaven built so far, oh why is earth set so remote? I cannot reach the nearest star, that hangs afloat. I would not care to reach the moon,
“It means that I’m the back-up,” Sherlock countered, following John up the stairs. “Granted it means that there isn’t much expectation of what I can achieve. Mycroft is supposed to be the great one, while I’m supposed to be happy. That’s the younger sibling’s job. That’s why you’re putting yourself through medical school while Harry’s gallivanting off to Ibiza with her latest girlfriend, being happy.”
“But I do know that,” John chuckled, “because you’re a stubborn git and you won’t settle for anything but the best. So, while I know that I want to be a Doctor, that I want to join the army, and that you have no idea what you want to do, I also know that you still have enough time and enough support behind you to work it out. You don’t have to have a set plan mapped out in front of you when you take off your graduation gown. You’re going to achieve great things because you have that uncertainty, you’re picky. I have every confidence that, once you realise what you want to do with your life, you’re going to excel at it.”
“No, it’s fine, I’ll go up to your room in a minute,” he said, somewhat breathlessly. “I could do with a lie-down.”
“Thank you for coming to the zoo with us.”
Sherlock went on.
John looked up at him, unbridled surprise and worry etched into his face.
“Sherlock…” he whispered, realisation sinking in. “You’re not talking about Mary, are you?
(See the end of the chapter for
Panic surged through Harry as John continued to shout.
“Fine,” Sherlock sighed. “Let me get dressed.”
Sherlock chuckled and nodded, turning back around to face him. He was smiling, excitement overwhelming his face with such modest glee that for a brief moment John was scared that his soulmate was a complete psychopath, grinning about serial killers. As it was, Sherlock tugged on his shirt collar to reveal a fine silver line at the base of his neck, just before it greeted the shoulder. Without the context of the Beheader, John would have automatically assumed it was a hair or simply not noticed it at all it was that faint. He certainly wouldn’t have noticed it if he was still seeing grey.
John didn’t like it.

They didn’t go for cake in the end. They bought plenty of sweet foods; chocolate and biscuits and far too many strawberry bon bons – John even treated Sherlock to some rather nice macaroons from Fortnum & Mason’s coveted counter - but Sherlock didn’t receive the cake they had originally planned. He didn’t mind, though. He would have exchanged cake for more time with John any day of the week.
“Consulting detective,” he said.
“Jesus Christ.” John ran a hand through his hair. “Well done, John. You’ve completely fucked it.”
“What the fuck?” A man yelled.
“Sherlock,” he said, ignoring the woman.
“No,” Sherlock snapped, jerking away from him. “John, there was an enormous wolf in here. It was huge. It was the biggest wolf I’ve ever seen.”
“Feels like I am,” Sherlock countered, taking a tentative sip of his own coffee.
“Well, it’s a bunch of places, actually,” he told him, perking up slightly. “Places that Mycroft’s told me you have a bit of a soft spot for. I didn’t know you’d helped that Prince. I got in contact with him and he said we’d be welcome to visit him and stay in his palace...” John was getting carried away. How long had he been keeping this secret? Sherlock smiled to himself. John hadn’t been growing tired of him, or more irritated. He’d been trying to do something for Sherlock. To repay him.

“Who‘s there?” Sherlock tried again, his knuckles turning white. He knew he was back at Baker Street, that much was obvious.
“She could be. You have to start these interests early, John, children are very impressionable.”
“Alright, then. I’ll give you a hand with these boxes, shall I?”
“... What if I don’t want my own bed?” He tried, but immediately regretted it. This was exactly the kind of thing he did to make himself sound like a twit. No wonder John had gotten angry with him. “That was probably the wrong thing to say. Sorry. I shouldn’t have-”
Upon reaching the office, Sherlock found the closed doorway flanked by two armed guards. Sherlock nodded slightly, impressed by the fear surrounding the teenager, and allowing theory after theory to run wild around his mind. God, he thought, eyes raking over the two men, what's this guy done?
"It's the 3rd," the man replied, turning back to face Sherlock, who shrugged.
Something soft and thick collided with Sherlock’s face as the bed dipped awkwardly around him. Sherlock grabbed onto the headboard, his eyes still shut, as he felt as the duvet be dragged up his legs.
“But you just need to leave it on the middle step,” Sherlock sighed. “Otherwise you could become infected. Stop trying to come up here. We’re fine.”
Then, he had received a request for help from a kind British lady living in Florida. Sherlock had flown over and spent a few months unpicking her case. That lady then became his and John’s landlady, but before that Sherlock developed a friends-with-benefits type situation with a used car salesman, who he’d bought a car off when he realised he would probably be in Florida for a while.
“I’ll leave you two to it, then,” he said. “You’re in good hands, Sherlock.”
Quickly, his fingers laced underneath it and pushed up on the pin, bringing it out of the clip and back through the fabric. Once it was off, he slipped it into his pocket and awaited the hammering he'd receive for taking it off. Why should people be warned of his Ability? He wasn't warned about theirs.
“Drop it.”
"Is she in?" He asked, swinging his bag off his shoulder and nodding towards the doorway, rolling on his feet and doing his best to look carefree. Which considering how often his Mum told him off for scowling Sherlock managed to pull off quite well.
“But this calls for celebration.”
Harry frowned.
John stared at him, eyes blown wide.
Sherlock nodded, putting his chopsticks down. “Good, as always,” he said, then: “John, I’m sorry. I should never have read it. It was private, and I –“
"What're you doing?" John muttered, still with his eyes shut and voice so low Sherlock could barely hear. The only reason he'd heard him in the first place was because he'd seen John's lips move slightly. "They'll know I haven't actually been in a fire," John continued, but Sherlock readjusted his grip on him (much to John's dismay), so that John was now facing towards Sherlock's body.
Maybe it was better that way. After all, that’s what the problem had initially been about. That was why they were standing alone in the middle of the park, facing one another at either ends of the path like the setup for a gunfight in a stereotypical cowboy movie. A very bad stereotypical cowboy movie, in which one of the cowboys wouldn’t pull out his gun. He’d let the bullet come to him instead.
How long Sherlock had been coming to the library he couldn't quite remember. All he remembered was that it was a particularly windy Wednesday, and that he had snuck off from Mycroft. Mrs Safely hadn't batted an eyelid as the youngster waltzed in; dripping from head to toe and saturated to the skin with the rain. He made his way over to the radiator, deposited his not-so waterproof coat on top of it; and then made his way over to the main desk.
“It’s a quiff.”
“You’re such an idiot,” John told him, throwing his head back as he laughed at the sky. The thunder grumbled, chortling with him. “Oh, Sherlock. You’re so stupid.”
Sherlock found it endearing.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded. “If we date, and if we are dating, we keep it a secret.”
“Yeah, well, as well as expected,” he said, not looking up. “I just, it was just a job, wasn't it? Same as any other.” He paused, and Jim tilted his head sympathetically. “It's just not what I expected, you know? I mean, I knew that one day I'd leave Afghanistan, but I didn't think I'd be coming back to London to shoot more people. It wasn't really on my--”
Sherlock steeled himself.
Images of Sherlock curled up in John’s bed drifted into his mind and he had to mentally shake himself. The thought of a lazy Sunday morning filled with cuddles, wrapped up in one another’s arms, warm, content, happy.
“Maybe,” John agreed, “but it’s a risk I’m more than willing to take. I’m pretty sure we could handle it, though.”
“That’s Sergeant Rose,” Sherlock said, nodding towards a police officer standing at the farthest end of the street to where they stood.
“I’m not.”

They’d been through too much together to resort to lying now. Neither of them would stoop low enough. Both of them knew what lying would do to the other. Neither of them had a secret too horrendous to not tell one another. Not anymore. There were no more secrets between them; John had been at the receiving end of far too many lies to stomach anymore.
“Yeah, it was fine. Two missed calls off Harry. Mrs Hudson left some soup at the top of the stairs, too.”
“Let’s just see what sort of mood Rosie is in first.”
The colour was blinding. The sky was a deep, periwinkle blue and the trees surrounding the park were a vibrant green. Puddles littering the grey pavement glinted in the sunlight and John could see everything. He smiled, completely in awe of the situation.
“But, there are a few obstacles to overcome first. I’ve told John that we can’t do anything concrete until those obstacles present themselves.”
“I’m sure he’ll appreciate it,” John said, smiling despite his best efforts. “I’ll send him down as soon as he’s better.”
“I’ll die,” John repeated, taking another step backward. “I don’t want to die. I want my teddy and I want mummy and I don’t want to die.”
"Yes," Sherlock nodded, but before John had chance to comply Sherlock had turned them both over, and John was screaming as the water pooled down her back. A short way down the path, an elderly hiking couple exchanged disapproving looks.
“John, you need to snap out of this right now. There's nothing there, take a look for yourself.” Jim grabbed John roughly, and Sherlock quickly scarpered out of the way, tripping over his feet as he rounded the corner and John was dragged to the place where Sherlock been mere seconds before. “See? Nothing.”
Hope you enjoy!
“Do you realise how ridiculous we both are?” He asked.
He kicked the door open with his foot, and John's nostrils flared as Sherlock jostled him around.
John had been told that meeting your soulmate was incomparable to anything. It was supposed to be blinding, all consuming.
John’s shoulders visibly relaxed, and he beamed. He knew that Sherlock’s expression was aimed at the expectations of a new relationship, rather than the concept of a relationship with him.
Because for John, the red paint Harry had been using was identical to that of red blood. It was the same shade of grey. It was, at first glance, the same thickness as blood too.
b)	Ballet!lock
“I know that you attended Bart’s together because it was the only logical place you would have both met, given your links to medicine,” Sherlock said. “Mike offered your full name, indicating that you were so far at the back of his mind that you now warrant the surname. It could be that another John has entered Mike’s life, but given the surprise meeting and the immediate association of your full name it’s more likely a time issue. Mike is unconsciously reminding himself that he knows you.”
"What're you looking for?" She asked, pressing the palms of her hands against the slippery pebbles and rocks in a bid to stable herself. "Experiment or just curious?"
“You’ve never wanted to help me. Never. I’m not going to deny that you have helped me, because of course you have. But really, John. What was I, ever, to you? A reduction on the cost of your rent in a prime London spot? An excuse not to spend anymore time than you had to with your alcoholic sister? Someone who would show you the parts of London that other people rarely get to see? I thought you wanted to see it.
Sherlock considered it for a few moments.
"Well, it looks beautiful," John smiled. "And you look beautiful, wet back and all." At that, Sherlock smiled, wrapping her legs around John's middle. "So stunning," John continued, carefully reaching round and gently pulling Sherlock's hair out of the bun. Sherlock's cheeks burned pink, and she quickly pecked John's lips.
John raised an eyebrow, sceptical.
He stared up at John, and John found himself staring back.
“Helping you with what?” He demanded, earning him an exasperated laugh from John.
“No!” John shouted and ran after her, panicked. He grabbed her hand again. “Grandma said that next time she might not be able to fix him.”
He imagined not feeling so alone when he woke up in the middle of the night with no one to talk to about what was on his mind.
"It's not nice, is it?" She beamed, and Sherlock quickly shook her head. John watched as the water soaked through Sherlock's dungarees; creating a dark patch of blue against the rest of the denim. "Cold, isn't it?" She continued, and Sherlock wriggled around madly. John would have thought she was distressed if she didn't know better.
“Look,” John began. “I'm not a rich man. Never have been, probably never will be. The money I get from the doctor’s is alright, but the debts mostly outweigh them. You listed all of the things you do for me. If it wasn't for you I’d probably been sitting in a council house somewhere, doing God knows what. All I know is that I’d be the most miserable bastard going.”

"I know that you're Sherlock Holmes, that your Ability is Fire, and that you're really good at punching," at that, Sherlock smiled apologetically, but John shook his head and brushed away any sympathies that Sherlock may offer him, not that there were any. "I also know that you're one of the best detectives London has to offer, which why I came to find you."
Harry sighed.
She smiled, scribbling something on a notepad in front of her. "Meaning...?"
“I didn’t punch him,” Sherlock clarified. “That was partner, Doctor Watson. And we’re here to talk to you about another matter though please, don’t run. He’s quite excellent with a gun and I assure you a bullet is far faster than you could ever be.”
John drank in all the colours as he entered the flat, from the white front of the terraced house to the vile orange wallpaper with massive purple flowers scattered across it, which ran up the staircase. Sherlock chuckled.
“Stop talking,” John ordered, voice muffled by Sherlock’s coat. Sherlock nodded into John’s hair, doing his best to free his arms and enclose them around John.
“Ah, just the person I wanted to see.”
Sherlock nodded, doubling up as he coughed into his elbow.
Sherlock grinned.
“I know who you are. You’re that crack ‘ed detective what punched the Super.”
“But I didn’t actually commit-“
“Yes. We were thinking… well, we really love the name Sherlock.”
“Yes. And watching you through the keyhole.”
Hello. This fic is now three chapters instead of two because chapter 2 was becoming a smidge too long. Chapter three will be up on Thursday :)
There was an actual
“This might be the day I ruin it all,” John told Rosie, looking down at her while they waited for the green man to light up. “Not that I can make it any worse. This’ll either be the final nail in the coffin, or it’ll be the beginning of the best life I could ever offer you.”
Sherlock nodded.
John didn’t think Sherlock would turn down the offer to go to the zoo. There were elephants there, and he knew Sherlock liked elephants.
Realising what John had said, Sherlock blinked, stepping away from him and lowering his hand completely. Honestly, he really had to work on how much one topic could throw him off.
, he thought to himself,
“Of course, dear,” she said warmly, smiling up at Sherlock and Rosie.
“And I told you a threat only made you appear more guilty. The police have your name and your address. They’ll find you. They’re not completely stupid, though they do appear it most of the time.”
A few metres away, a squirrel scarpered down from its hiding place higher up in the tree. It stopped as it reached the foot of the trunk, quickly scratching at the side of it’s face as the tail flicked lightly. Its head tilted in the direction of Sherlock, and then towards John, who was silent under the weight of Sherlock’s words. Neither of them noticed the grey spectator, too focused on one another to care. Eventually however, John’s voice box spluttered back into life. The squirrel vanished back up into the tree.
"I left my badge in there." He replied, pointing his index finger at the empty lapel on his chest. He'd removed the badge ages ago, and it was currently sitting comfortably in his pocket, entangled in the white wires of his headphones - rather than on a random surface in the office. But they didn't need to know that.
“You’re cute and so soppy,” he said, and Sherlock glared at him.
John was straight. A fully-fledged heterosexual with all the libido of James Bond and the same talent of attracting the ladies. Mary had been interesting, but the rest of them had been dull and boring and oh so predictable.
Sherlock shook himself mentally, putting thoughts of John’s apparent anthropomorphism to the side, ready to think about a bit later on when he was less tired and less injured.
g)	Soulmate AU
And Sherlock did.
When Sherlock had first started going to the library she had guided him towards the right genre of novels. At that time, all Sherlock had cared for were the books of definitive good and evil. Set villains who not a soul could empathise with, spectacular heroes who had the world rooting for them, and a plethora of cliched plot devices. His favourites now were the ones that involved murders – the more dramatic the better. That didn’t stop him from straying back towards the Enid Blyton section whenever he needed cheering up, though.
"The select few's 'magical' Abilities were mainly owing to the fact that mutations within the cells began to occur within certain genes, causing more supernatural elements to become a natural human trait. Supernatural elements that have since been proved by science. In some cases, anyway.
The club was crowded. Not more crowded than expected for a Friday night, for sure, but still decently packed. The bartender’s eyes flashed with recognition as John slid into the seat in front of him, but he barked out his order before the man could comment on it.
Lestrade’s office door was propped open when John arrived. The detective was sitting with his head in his hands, a crumpled cigarette still smoking in the ashtray.
“Going out, don’t wait up,” the door shut behind him. Sherlock nodded to the empty air and swung himself up from the couch. Some coffee would have to suffice, he decided. A boiling potful later, he thought he felt better.
“Who? Who, Greg?” Rosie stirred as he leaned closer to Lestrade. His mind was spinning, the suspect board flashing in his vision, each face leering at him behind his eyes. He hadn’t felt this adrenaline since… Well, since Culverton Smith.
When he’d found Sherlock on the park bench, he’d been wandering around aimlessly, clutching his walking stick. He’d done nothing with his day except wander, too exhausted to do much else. He had only left the flat that morning to get his fill of what limited fresh air London could off him. Naturally, had had gravitated towards the areas of trees in amongst the terraced houses; the quiet suburbs of university-owned homes which doubled as offices had offered a respite from the chaotic stretch of the Euston road.
John watched the young detective orgasm around his cock, his throat constricting with his cries, causing John’s orgasm to erupt. He spilled down Sherlock’s creamy throat as he experienced rapturous pleasure at the hands of his lover.
John’s many achievements as an Army captain were played as badges on his right chest, and the scarlet red strip running down his pant legs only made him stand out further as a distinguished soldier. His beret was tilted slightly on his head, making the shock of blonde hair peaking through even more breathtaking.
“Absolutely no idea,” John responded, turning to look at Sherlock’s empty chair and feeling a sense of unease settling in the pit of his stomach.
“Lochmage, but, how did you know?” The woman spoke- a soft voice, but firm and unyielding. Utterly captivating, Sherlock observed, but pushed the thought away to make room for her deductive skills. She paced forward, coming to a halt in front of the throne and standing a mere yard away from the woman in question, running her piercing gaze up and down her body.
“Open yourself for me,” John growled, and Sherlock paused in mortification.
Mrs. Hudson seemed to understand, “John is doing this because he believes it is best. You’ve changed him Sherlock, in ways you cannot even imagine. We will be alright, take care of him.”
“Come on John, he’s getting away,” Sherlock cried with a voice of enthusiasm rather than irritation, the trill of the chase already pumping through his veins, and John fought down a smile at the precious detective in order to focus on what he had said.
Sherlock shifted awkwardly where he stood at the crime scene, lightly hopping from foot to foot and using his coat to cover his burgeoning erection. The natural heat of the June day paired alongside the unusually high humidity levels made wearing his thick Belstaff nearly unbearable in the oppressive heat.
Additionally, John’s own reactions to the princess’ beauty would be so difficult to face. She was just so cold, calculating, and
After about a mile, Sherlock viewed an edge of grey in the distance. As he galloped closer, he realized that it was a large stonewall with a rusted iron gate. Just beyond, down a stone pathway a huge castle stood, decorated by gargoyles and dark flying buttresses with sharpened stone decorating the outer walls. The dark grey against the darkened night sky makes the castle seem completely deadened, as if no one had ever resided in the cold building with it uninhabitable atmosphere.
John was going to have a marvelous time drawing out his arousal until Sherlock was utterly quaking and crying with need.
He leaned down, stepping into the panties and pulling them up his smooth, now hairless legs, shivering delightedly at the feeling. Settling them in place, Sherlock gasped as he felt the garment hug his skin and, more imperatively, separate his arse cheeks and rub against his arsehole when he so much as shifted.
“You didn’t ask for permission,” John said in a mock-disappointed tone, but Sherlock’s curls sprung up from the bed as he realized his error.
“Well, I’m off,” Sherlock pronounced after a moment of silence, jumping from his armchair and rushing over to his coat, pulling it on while Mrs. Hudson and John stared at him in surprise.
John picked up the magic mirror, and interrupting Sherlock's musing, told him to speak his father’s name.
John watched as he sheathed his sword and settled down to catch a few hours rest before they continued their journey to the castle.
Oh, it was
In a rush, Sherlock flipped John, pulling down her pajama bottoms and began roughly palming her through her panties, rocking on top of her; John, already on edge from eating Sherlock out and her delicious sounds and reactions, causing John to come with a cry.
Sherlock wished to allow John to feel as wholly and completely known as Sherlock did when John showered him with his affections.
Sherlock thought, feeling heat racing through his heart at the thought.
When the two men entered the large, open room, they both stared around them at the splendor.
Mrs. Hudson smiled and gestured him into the kitchen with a tilt of her top, pouring him a cup of tea and letting him slouch over the table. Sherlock took a sip, reveling in the warmth spreading through his body with just the right amount of sweetness. Bless Mrs. Hudson.
But no matter how hard he tried, he could still picture those cold, almost black eyes from his dream.
“Come here John, let me help,” Sherlock begged, and John was helpless against his wish to learn how to pleasure him. Sherlock sat up, moving John to stand between his legs as he pulled the boxers down, looking at John’s erect manhood for the first him and feeling saliva pooling in his mouth at the size; it was above average, and the girth was thick.
The teapot hopped over, and looked up at Sherlock with a pitying expression, "I know this is a lot to take in right now, but the master isn't entirely what he seems right away. You just need to get to know him-"
“Oh, John
John leaned back, watching Sherlock with a sweet expression that caused Sherlock to internally melt. Still holding the beautiful, and now fitting, flowers, she brought them to her nose to sniff, wanting to catalogue to smell of the flower’s John bought for her.
Unable to walk any further, he leaned against a tree to support his quaking legs. Sherlock panted, throwing his head back and gripping his hair in frustrated arousal, as the sensations around his cock only grew more fervent, wet, and more, more, more. His cockhead was continuing to leak precum steadily into the now chilly air, and he felt both warm from arousal and yet unsettled. He was being pleasured in a forest, by nothing!  Where was John? John, he needs John.
And yet, Sherlock stayed. He came back.
“Yes, John, I’ve been a perfect angel.” He said while rolling his ever-changing eyes, “Solved the case, and all that. Now please,
It wasn’t his fault that Sherlock led him to distraction at every moment of the day; he brooded slightly as he carried the scones to the kitchen in order to get Mrs. Hudson a cup of tea, splashing in a bit of milk before carrying it out to hand to their elderly landlady.
After all, it was Sherlock and John. All they ever needed was one another: Sherlock and his conductor of light. John and his young lover.
Sherlock gazed into his blue eyes, eyes shining ‘trust me’ in their depths, and Sherlock nodded his consent.
John got up from his chair with a wince, his back protesting the movement. He was not as young as he once was, and so much had happened since he moved into Baker Street all those years ago, with his psychosomatic limp and his dwindling energy for life.
Sherlock tried to push the distracting thoughts away, avoiding John's hungry gaze.
,” Sherlock refused to finish his statement, stomping his foot like a child, and John would have none of it.
Which was why John was agitated in the calm silence of the morning.
But John, who refused to be called Joan because fuck societal standards about gendered names, John, who went into the army and was promoted despite her small stature and “lesser” gender status, John, who shot a man dead without a blink of remorse but cried watching
Sherlock watched the shadows carefully as the inhuman creature seemed to think for a moment, “that is, unless you would be willing to take his place.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and with a scowl continued, “Oh please, even a child could solve this case. The rose was taken to distract from the real crime. The men who stole the rose are planning to break into the Bank of England when all of Scotland Yard’s finest were busy looking for a rare, 2 million pound rose.”
Mrs. Hudson strolled into the room with a row of servants who were carrying all sorts of odds and ends: towels, perfumes, combs, jewelry, and heels in a neat succession. Sherlock shuddered at the unwelcome sight. She'd almost forgotten about the impending unpleasantness of the ball.
“I wish it was that simple papa,” Sherlock sighed, “we will have to wait and see what comes with nightfall. Where is Mycroft?”
. Sherlock turned around and came face to face with a candelabra, only this one had animated features and was-
“This is non negotiable Sherlock, I’ve had enough of your reckless jaunts. It was one ordeal when you were a child, but as a woman, your actions are unseemly and put you and your virtue at risk. it’s for your own good,” he had said brusquely, staring down his hooked nose at her where he sat at his desk, looking oh-so-important in his evening formal wear with the regal sash over his chest.
At least for now.
As they passed through the gates and the King's Guard standing watch, John took in her first view of the castle grounds: “Holy-“ John whispered, taking in the majesty and enormity surrounding her.
.” His eyes gleamed with promise.
Opening the box, Sherlock began to reach towards the anal beads with an inquisitive gaze when he heard his phone text alert noise
In the next instant, Lestrade pulled up in a police car with an ambulance trailing him.
'Adorable' John thinks, and then pushes that thought away.
But Michael, well, he was beautiful and young; everything John enjoyed in a man, remembering the homesick, youthful recruits who had been soothed by his expertise, when John had taught them how to pleasure a man, how to offer themselves fully.
Just as John heard the cry out again, he was off, running through the castle and out the doors, galloping on all fours and using his gained muscle mass of the beast to reach Sherlock's side in moments, as he had not strayed too far from the castle walls.
Sherlock thought with a smirk, trailing teasing kisses down John chest until he came to lay between John’s knees. With a smile up at his husband, he spread John’s knees wide, giving himself access to everything between John’s muscular legs.
But that couldn’t be right
John remembered that he forgot to get a condom from the bedroom, and cursing himself for his forgetfulness, made to get up. Sherlock, who even in his somewhat addled state was still a genius, shook his head as John began to move.
Once in the bedroom, John laid Sherlock back on his bed. He leaned down and kissed the rosy cheeks multiple times, feeling Sherlock’s reluctant grin at John’s silliness.
Sherlock always thought it was ridiculous when John spouted poetry to his girlfriends, but now, Sherlock wanted John to call him “sweetheart” and “love” endlessly.
“Do you-that is,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “do you want to read this with me?” When the beast looked on in confusion, Sherlock amended, “I mean, I’ll read it aloud. For you. With you, I mean.”
“Wait, there’s a library here?” Sherlock asked, intrigued.
At John’s question, Sherlock thought back to a few days ago, lying on his back and panting for John’s cock to be filling him rather than the blue vibrator, to be completely at John’s mercy as he told him what to do, filling him up completely....
Mrs. Hudson watched his expression with growing understanding, “you’ve learned to love. So you're letting him go.”
It was going to be a long afternoon.
John raised one eyebrow as Sherlock opened his pouting mouth to respond, and the detective snapped his jaw shut, glaring at John and crossing his arms with a huff.
"Papa, do you have to leave again so soon?" Sherlock asked, sitting at the kitchen table with his beekeeping book and watching sadly as his father repacked the bags that had just been emptied a fortnight before.
But here, in the comfort of his home, with his chest opened for John to see, he is the slightly overgrown teenager in regards to intimacy.
the curly haired man whimpered, his plump lips forming around John’s name in such a way that John felt his chest tightened in complete adoration at this man who loved him.
She helped Sherlock out of his coat, and paced around him, looking for a moment and humming, “can I take your measurements?”
John was looking at him oddly. There was still the usual hunger in his eyes, and Sherlock’s cheeks turned slightly rosy and the remembrance of all the sexual acts they had engaged in since they had been together for the past month, but now there was a sentimentality lingering over his features, something vulnerable in a way that his strong John rarely ever was.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, I’m glad to finally be home,” John said, releasing her with a final squeeze and looked mischievously at Sherlock, beginning to run towards the bed, ignoring Sherlock’s dramatic cries of, “John, don’t you dare!
“That’s right, you had to have your naughty bottom spanked, and next time, I am going to put a cock ring on you and you’ll not come, but I will,” John leaned down to whisper in his ear, “I am going to fuck you with a cock ring on, so hard, and you’ll be moaning and writhing around on my prick, but I won’t let you escape it. Afterwards, you will feel my come leaking out of your pink, puffy rosebud for
“John, I-I’m sorry
John had been unbearably hard when he was spanking Sherlock earlier that day, and with the nipple clamps and dirty talk following, he knew he wouldn’t last long now, his need for Sherlock rising ever higher.
Reaching hand out, he gently drew Sherlock down to lay beside him, looking into his changeable eyes that were smiling back at John.
“I, Sherlock, take you John, to be my lawfully wedded husband,” Sherlock’s voice quavered, and he blinked his eyes rapidly to get his emotions under control, but found he was lost in the light blue eyes glistening back at him.
,” Sherlock answered, his breathing growing more labored by the second, the flush of embarrassment and arousal on his face trailing down to spread over his chest, much to John’s delight. He wanted nothing more than to follow that flush with his tongue, licking and sucking at the creamy skin. Discovering new ways of making Sherlock moan.
Adrenaline was coursing through their veins as they entered 221B, trading kisses and shedding each other’s coats between giggles in unrepentant glee of a case cracked.
Sherlock, however, was sitting completely frozen, his eyes wide and his breathing shallow:and after a few moments, John became concerned.
Before passing through the doorway, he turned to ask one more question.
"I-uh-I'm Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes."
John put the remote control on the table, showing it to Sherlock with an excited grin.
Hello all!
“That is utterly fantastic, thank you so much. Congratulations!” She beamed, and as if sensing their slight discomfort, grabbed her friend’s hand and stumbled away, giggling like schoolgirls all the while.
“Shut up” Sherlock demanded, her command easily dismissed from the blush on her cheeks and the light moans making their way out of her plush mouth.
"I know
“Have dinner with me tonight,” the beast said out of nowhere, and Sherlock looked at him with a bemused expression.
“No talking. If you need something, you will say one of your colors, and we will slow down or stop. Regardless of that, I don’t want you to talk,” John commanded lowly, steel in his tone, and Sherlock bowed his head without conscious thought to look away from John’s hardened gaze, unused to so much ire from John.
Sherlock's mind was spinning in a panic.
She was breathtaking, and John’s eyes ran up and down the delicate body once, twice, before training her eyes back to the princess’ face.
John leaned down to inspect his work, and without warning, slide his saliva coated tongue inside Sherlock, which was rapidly becoming one of his favorite acts. Sherlock absolutely adored it, but he was so embarrassed, he never asked for the filthy act himself; but he craved it, and John delivered. He tasted so sweet, like his honey body wash and a sweet, slightly earthy scent that was purely Sherlock.
Once they arrived at the bedchamber, John opened the door with a flourish, allowing Sherlock to enter.
Sherlock stood awkwardly, unsure of what to do, until John opened his eyes slightly, and nodded him over.
,” startling some of the nearby village people.
“Look at you; a complete mess. Your well spanked arse and your mouth coated in pasta sauce, you just can't help but be
John merely grunted and swept away through the doorway, disappearing without another word.
Sherlock realized.
you’re going to come soon, aren’t you? That’s a love, going to come all over my uniform like a good, beautiful boy,” John remarked, “after this I’m going to have you stand in the corner with your hands on your head, your red bum on display for all to see.”
Lying down, John pulled the thoughtful Sherlock to him and cuddled in, kissing the top of Sherlock’s head and laughing when he felt flecks of glitter settling on his lips.
“Not tonight love, tonight I just want to hold you in my arms and go to sleep. Sweet dreams, Sherlock.” John settled back and squeezed Sherlock tightly, as if to assure himself he was really holding onto the detective, before closing his eyes.
Reaching lube covered fingers down, John made short work of preparing Sherlock, stroking just beneath his prostate and wiggling his fingers inside the hot, pink channel, savoring Sherlock's whimpers for more.
“Are you ready to go, sweetheart?” John asked, and Sherlock’s heart caught in his throat for a moment that his proud man; a soldier, a doctor, a hero, was willing to out himself to the world happily, if a little nervously, with Sherlock in tow.
This was the beginning of something new. Potentially dangerous. Interesting.
“Sherlock, dear, it's time for your bath,” Mrs. Hudson announced, clapping her hands together. She looked around the room for a moment before turning to Sherlock, “Sherlock, why is John stationed outside instead of in here with you?”
John watched in amazement as Sherlock’s eyes began to pool with wetness, the tears of sentiment and pleasure meshing together in harmony and rolling down his hot cheeks.
A whirling genius of a woman- a princess who had spent her life in forced seclusion.
It was going to be a long day.
He sat down on the bed, and buried his face in his hands, feeling utterly hopeless as the tears dripped down.
Sherlock stood up, deftly depositing the teacup- Rosie, his mind supplied- on the floor before he began pacing back and forth.
John shook his head, hanging it in despair. What was he going to do? He needed a battle-plan, but first, he needed advice.
"I am above you," she seemed to say, "and you all should know it."
“I’m afraid I promised Mrs. Hudson that I would ensure you washed your curls, and frankly, Mrs. Hudson is more than a little terrifying,” John admitted with a sheepish grin, imploring Sherlock to be kind, “so, I will be over here if you need anything, princess.”
From what John could see, it was dirty and smudged, “unhappy marriage,” he grumbled to himself, but Sherlock heard and turned to him with a smile.
, John thought sadly with just a hint of annoyance. Molly was the kindest of the household staff and, as such, was in charge of his whereabouts or lack thereof. And now, she was here to give him news he didn’t want, and she was obviously quaking with fear.
“Can you blame me, love? Your arse is endlessly lovely, I could worship it for hours, “ John drawled, pulling Sherlock back into the curve of his arms and holding the lean man tightly, trailing a calloused hand down to grasp lightly at Sherlock’s arse (that, for once, was not stained pink or red) and gave it a small slap, ignoring Sherlock’s indignant “humph.”
“When you’re on your own, you are going to pull for each section to tighten it from behind,” she showed Sherlock on the bench, and he nodded, observing her movements and memorizing them for his own purposes later.
“Enough of those thoughts, now,” John reprimanded lightly, stroking Sherlock’s face and watching him nuzzle into his roughened palm, “it’s just you and me, don’t hide from me love.”
As he began slipping them back on, Sherlock called from the doorway, his eyes glued to his phone screen with a delighted expression, “I’ll be waiting downstairs. Hurry!”
“Sherlock, where are you going?” John asked, and Sherlock turned to answer swiftly.
Sherlock bit his lip and looked at John shyly, still feeling vulnerable from his and John’s swift relationship change from flat mates and friends to lovers in a distinctively kinky physical relationship.
“A flat of six blokes? I can imagine there’s no end of injury,” John chuckled, but Sherlock tilted his head to the side.
e)	Parent!lock
At some point, Sherlock had fallen asleep. He didn’t remember drifting off, nor did he realise he’d been sleeping. He grunted at John in response, his face hidden by the duvet.
4.	“Living a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past. Well, I'm past that, my interests up and my bag's packed.” Losing My Mind, Falling in Reverse
“What?” Sherlock quizzed, interest spiking.
Clearly the stresses of work and Harry weren’t enough to squash John’s appreciation of Sherlock’s humour.
The remaining six men closed in around him. One cracked his knuckles, another leered, and Sherlock hurriedly tried to scramble in between two of the men’s legs, back to the Main Street. A swift kick to the chest sent him back down into the centre of the circle.
Sherlock eyed him closely, surveying him.
“Meaning?”
There came another huff, but the mattress sprung back as the heavy wolf jumped off the bed. Sherlock allowed the wolf a moment before he opened his eyes.
“There's a good boy,” Jim smiled, his voice thick with misplaced warmth. The condescension in his praise made Sherlock want to kick something; Jim pulled John forward, wrapping his arm around his neck and pushing the forlorn man into his torso, so as to act out one of the most false hugs Sherlock had ever been forced to witness.
It hadn’t occurred to him that he’d never seen Sherlock cry when he was in physical pain before.
“Anyone in?” John called up the stairs. “Sherlock? Mrs Hudson?”
He’d been forced to stay in the flat when Sherlock developed a temperature and began coughing.
John hung up and shoved his phone back into his pocket. He was back in his room, Sherlock having vacated it shortly after their stunted conversation and dived straight into the shower.
It was nice to get out of the house, and nicer still to step into that fatherly role he felt he had so mercilessly abandoned after Mary died.
However, he had barely finished the first sentence before he found himself staring at the globe again. This time, there was someone inspecting it.
“No,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock made to stand but was shoved down again.
Sherlock blinked. There were only four pages worth of scribbles, but the revelations they possessed made the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand up. He skimmed through each one, his knees drawn up to his chin with his nose almost flat against the pages, reading impossibly fast, drinking it all in.
“No teeth,” John decided. “And they’re not for me.” He glanced down at Rosie, who beamed back.
“You loved Mary and yes, I did expect you to wait around for me and I was a little bit surprised when the woman you fell in love with turned around and shot me, but you were in love.” Sherlock’s voice quietened as he looked away. “And you do stupid things for the people you love. You forgive them when they shouldn’t be forgiven because there’s still that element of hope which lingers and you yearn for. You forgive them over and over again. You blame yourself for their misfortune.”
Suit clad politicians stood stock still, clutching onto their cardboard coffee cups and forgetting about their own mundane business as they watched the resulting raucous started by the loud teenager. Sherlock (for his part) blinked, and despite the obvious appearance he needed to make; ducked behind one of the large pillars which ultimately blocked him from everyone's view, but more importantly from the growing angrier boy still shouting his name as he was hauled by.
He hoped that now, with his soulmate, he had finally found that peace.
The tail was no longer thumping, and he was no longer wrapped in a blanket of fur.
“It’s not that far in the past, Sherlock,” John corrected him. “It’s recent history.”
"You can breath, you know." Sherlock muttered, and the boy's breath ran across Sherlock's hand as he exhaled.
The man didn’t turn his focus from his graze, and winced as he poked it.
“And he hit the ground and his head collided with that step. And you were on him immediately, checking the bleed and calling for an ambulance. In less than a second you switched from solider to doctor and I, well, I found it amazing.”
Blue.
Despite the cold January air, Green Park was enjoying a day of idle walkers and cyclists, carrying them between Buckingham Palace and the Underground Station.
Sherlock lifted his arm slightly, his finger tips brushed against thick, spiky fur.
So, when John announced that he was potentially interested in a relationship with Sherlock, Sherlock found himself slightly lost for words.
“The bulkiest part. 22nd, if you’re desperate for specifics though it hardly matters.”
From the behind the bookshelf, Sherlock watched the display with interest. Jim, as was apparently his name, had gone back to flipping the pages of his new found book over, after snatching it back from John. Except, Sherlock had all but lost interest in him, and had found it again in John instead.
“I’m always honest with you,” Sherlock replied.
"I dare say it will," he muttered, intrigue still plaguing him as John gulped heavily - the guy certainly knew how to act. "So what's this? Hostage situation?" He continued, and when he felt a distinct shrug from John under his grasp, Sherlock loosened his hold on him slightly.
Had Sherlock known John would walk by? Had Sherlock known about John at all? Was it fate, or was there something more sinister at play?
“You bought Rosie clothes and toys and a book about Marie Curie. Sherlock, she’s barely a year old. She can’t read. She likes cuddly toys and funny faces, she’s not interested in science.”
Sherlock frowned.
“Hm?”
No. No, not grey.
“You only read them to fall asleep.”
, sitting on
“Oi!”
Sergeant Rose turned white. He was surrounded now. John, Sherlock and Lestrade stood directly in front of him, and more officers joining them in an impenetrable circle.
Mrs Hudson sighed, quietly relieved that Sherlock had at registered one of John’s tendencies.
Harry rolled her eyes. “Wouldn’t that be a shame.”
The fact that Sherlock was aware of the technique and wasn’t criticising John for using it told John how much Sherlock needed it.
“If you’re not a threat,” Sherlock called, “get off the bed and lie down by the wardrobe, facing away from me.”
Sherlock turned away, closing his laptop lid and smiling sadly.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded. “And?”
“Would you ever have one?” He asked after a few moments of silence, punctuated only by Rosie's quiet squeaks and gurgles.
Sherlock ignored him and continued.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now, he knew that the trick was Sherlock’s ability to survive. A miracle. A miracle that he would come back. He wasn’t gone forever like John originally believed.
“With all due respect, John, you have no idea what I’m going through.”
“Don’t.”
It was thick fur, almost like that of a wolf, and Sherlock frowned as he curled his fingers around a great clump of it.
A member of John’s family joined the search, and a man said quite plainly: “You don’t think they’re-“
John shook his head. “No.”
He was pleasantly surprised at how the day had turned around.
Except –
Sherlock shook his head.
Sergeant Donovan stood chatting to a curious resident, hiding behind her front gate in her dressing gown, a steaming mug of tea in her hands.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Nothing,” John said, feeling the back of his neck grow hot, “Rosie and I are going to the zoo and I thought you might like to come.”
John tilted his head to the side.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You’re not going to die,” Harry sighed, as John gripped onto her, his arms barely long enough to hug her properly but the intention was there. Harry rocked him gently. “I’m here to look after you, okay? Otherwise I’d have sent you out alone and locked the door behind you.”

For one, his blonde hair was scruffy. It wasn't by any means long, but it stuck out at odd angles in great fluffy spikes. The back of it was flattened from where it had collided with the wall, but Sherlock distinctly noted the way it curled atop the boy's crown, like a tornado of blonde as it fanned out to the rest of his head.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, lifting his head to look at John as he opened the door Mrs Hudson had closed on her way out.
“We can…” Sherlock’s face contorted, as though he was attempting to eat a particularly sour lemon, “date, but I have some rules.”
His hands shook as he read over the board. It had been over a month since the murders, and Sherlock was disgusted with himself. Having done nothing to help John or make his own headway on the case, he had hurt their relationship in ways he could not even fathom. Thinking about the murders made him queasy. He wanted to disappear whenever he was confronted with questions about it. How could he expect himself to solve this now? He had already let so much time pass, lost the attention of his best friend, and could feel himself slowly slipping back into the depths of his worst habits.
“Hello, Mycroft,” he spat dryly into the phone. John had neither the patience nor the time for this today.
His alarm clock buzzed for the third time that morning and he finally slammed a hand on it to make the horrific noise stop.
“Oh, you know. Out and about. Finally got around to visiting the morgue... that was a few days ago, though. Just now I met with Mrs. Hudson for the most scrumptious tea and biscuits. By the way, you should pay her a visit,” he dropped dramatically into his chair and whispered, “Really though, I think she just misses the baby,” John was aghast. This man had so much nerve. He huffed, grabbed Rosie, and stomped down the stairs.
The sun was overhead by the time the detective rose from his bed. Birds were chirping outside and the light streaming through the windows burned his eyes. The outside world did not match how Sherlock felt. His head felt like a stone, and his body only slightly more pliable. Yesterday had been a rough one, and he felt slightly remorseful for how he had treated John. Afterward, he had gone out and thought some more. About what? The obvious. The case was all that concerned him now. But the problem was, he couldn't bring himself to actually work on it. The thoughts simply swirled around his brain, day and night, like the undertow of a river that he couldn't quite catch. Then, he had smoked enough cigarettes to make his head spin and his lungs wheeze, followed by visiting Angelo at the cafe and ordering one too many drinks. It was the closest he could get to the release he needed, or wanted, he supposed, and all it had done was made him feel like shit.
“Stop smiling. It’s too early,” Sherlock mumbled, closing his eye again. “And don’t ever turn my blanket off again.”
"What did Merriweather want?" Sherlock immediately quizzed, John stared at him, to which Sherlock responded with a raised eyebrow prompting him to talk. John sighed.
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock shouted. His voice cracked and he felt a tickle creeping into his throat again. “Go away!”
“Schedules.”
John had never been more scared.
“You're- you’re right…” John spoke quietly, staring at the ground.
“But if you want to get her home that’s okay,” he cut across his own thoughts. John needed to make up for lost time with his daughter, mourn the death of his wife in a healthy way, and not be in charge of babysitting a junkie detective he evidently didn’t like very much.
John couldn’t blame it.
Tucker and Tony dropped Sherlock and Sherlock collapsed. He curled into a ball, protecting his face and stomach from the onslaught.
John huffed out a laugh.
“The normal way?” Sherlock scoffed. “None of this is normal.” He glared at the back of John’s head, not sure whether he was more annoyed at John for not telling him, or at himself for not seeing it.
"Since then, the mutations have been able to flourish, and there's more cause for concern when a child is born with no Abilities."
“Is this suppose to be reassuring?” Sherlock frowned.
“I got shot.”
“Oh well,” the man smiled, and without so much as a glance towards Sherlock, departed back down one of the aisles looking somewhat dishevelled. The shelves remained mighty, forcing Sherlock to alter his theory.
“Nothing can kill him, though it’s not like the world hasn’t tried. See you later.”
A few paces in front of him, John stopped walking just short of a small puddle that had gathered in the dips of the pavement. It's leaf infested contents rippled as the wind skipped across it, seemingly bypassing John altogether and hitting Sherlock full on. It had only just stopped raining, but the air was still heavy and damp; clouded by the petrichor.
He didn’t offer anymore on the topic, but John didn’t need him to. He already knew.
It was more exciting than when she was five and her mum had bought her the most gigantic triple chocolate chip and strawberry ice cream, complete with rainbow sprinkles and two flakes. It was more exhilarating than when she was in year 10 and had thrown the javelin 19 metres during PE. More relaxing than baths; more peaceful than swimming alone in the depths of an empty pool. The happiness she felt in her current moment was better than winning every netball game of the season.
“And you’re the opposite?” John questioned. “You… enjoy murder? And violence? Serial killers and beheadings?”
John’s stomach jolted.
Annoyance at John was the first thing to hit her. She had always liked the doctor and been very tolerant of him, even after he abandoned her when Sherlock ‘died’, and after he had stomped over Sherlock’s naïve and damaged heart. Again. And again. And where was he now? Always jealous of any attention Sherlock received, Mrs Hudson watched as the man always pointed the finger at Sherlock and rarely took the blame for his own actions.
Felt a bit stunted writing this chapter for some reason, though I have no idea why.
Rosie smiled.
Violet's face dropped, and Siger glared at the teacher while offering his wife the only comforts he could muster. Opposite them, Mrs Merriweather sighed heavily, pulling off her spectacles and letting them hang around her neck. She leant forwards, lacing her bony fingers together with a desperately sorry look on her face.
It doesn’t even matter that John doesn’t want him. That he didn’t care and in the end just wanted a happy, boring, ordinary life with his happy, boring, ordinary wife. It doesn’t matter that it was John who made Sherlock desperate enough to start all of this to begin with.
He doesn’t look as though he’s able to reply. But then again, maybe he doesn’t have to. As soon as the words leave John’s mouth, he remembers that, yes, perhaps Sherlock
“What do you want to do? Should I turn on the telly? Make breakfast?”
He pulls away from her, gently but firmly detaching her arms from around him and standing up straight to look into her eyes.
And Sherlock does.
“It’s all fine.”
“Sherlock… what’s happening with me and Mary…”
“I mean it. Sherlock, if I had known…”
“Come on, husband, let’s go.”
“No moral, Sherlock. Just a subjective truth.”
, Sherlock could think of at least seven instances where they could easily have…
“I know it’s early. Really, I’m sorry…”
John’s heart twists to witness it.
“Now, what does my Victorian detective have to say to that?”
Mary nods again. She still doesn’t seem particularly emotionally affected. There’s something off about that, something that keeps nagging John. He just doesn’t have the brainpower to process it right now.
Compromise is the only solution John can currently make his brain come up with, but it isn’t necessarily a good one. What he’s doing right now – looking over Sherlock, telling himself this return to Baker Street is a temporary measure and being engaged in long-winded discussions with Mary over text whenever Sherlock is asleep – that is in itself a kind of compromise and it’s not working.
his chair and that he’s just as much a guest here as she is. An unpleasant feeling briefly twists to life in the pit of John’s stomach and he crushes it forcefully.
When they’re on the couch together, watching crap telly and eating directly from take-out boxes. And Sherlock is lying down, box balanced precariously on his stomach. It looks absolutely preposterous and doesn’t he know it. When their eyes meet and they both laugh, laugh so hard that the box, already dangerously situated as it is, shakes in time with Sherlock’s chest and John takes in his usually heavily guarded face and watches it dissolve into helpless giggles and thinks that this is how it ought to be, how
John isn’t quite sure how to interpret what has just happened. He feels as though he only picked up on half of what their conversation was actually about and he’s uncomfortably aware of having yielded more information than he meant to.
John chuckles as well. “Sounds like the two of you. For my part, I’ve done a vigorous round of Christmas shopping and I’m proud to announce that we’re now all set to go for this whole holiday hullabaloo.” John throws Sherlock a sly smirk. “Unless, of course, someone decides to target our Christmas confectionery ahead of time like last year.”
“End your suffering.”
“I’m sorry you’re… I’m sorry for you.”
“What did she say?”
The exclamation is at the tip of his tongue, but it doesn't come. Instead, Sherlock just stares at him, and Moriarty returns his gaze. That amused smirk deepens.
It comes as a decided surprise that Sherlock takes part in the wedding preparations to the extent that he does. Sherlock Holmes and getting lost in twenty minute discussions about which bakery makes the best marzipan to top off a wedding cake is not a combination that John would ever have come up with on his own. If he is being honest, Sherlock seems to be at least as motivated as he is. And sometimes, John can’t help but notice that it feels a bit as though it’s Mary and Sherlock who are getting married, the two of them discussing napkin colours, bouquet compositions and table arrangements with the greatest care and attention while John struggles to form an informed opinion on four slices of identically tasting white cake. It’s not that he doesn’t care. It’s just that there are limits to how much in detail John wants to go in preparation for a party that’s still several months away. Who can honestly tell the difference between plum and mulberry anyway?
He just has to enjoy it as much as possible while it lasts.
He sits still for a moment. There’s a sudden warmth in his chest that he finds difficult to keep under control. It breaks through the next second in the form of a deep smile, the kind of smile that pulls at his mouth in an uncontrollable wave and crinkles the corners of his eyes in a way he’s always thought made him look old, even back when he was still in his twenties.
He wishes he could be more coherent about all this, but now’s not the time for close examinations of guilt and responsibility leading to long and constipated speeches of apology. Now’s the time to just bloody say what comes to mind because it’s probably the most sincere anyway and emotional sincerity has been sorely lacking from his and Sherlock’s conversations for a very long time.
There’s no one. The realisation hits Sherlock with the force of a small van. Everyone that he cares about is here tonight. Everyone that he considers his friend is here tonight. All three people that he took the fall for are here tonight. Yet not one of them has time for him now. They’re all busy being around less complicated people. Safer bets.
“Bedroom?” he asks.
But never mind. Rosie is delighted by the bright colours of her new ensemble and the cookies, John had assured him, had been more than passable.
She raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. “You can’t give me any indication? None at all? I should just go back to our home and wait until my husband decides to grace me with his presence?”
But does this conversation have to be here? Now?
. It can’t feel wrong with Sherlock, it just can’t.
John takes a deep breath. Tries to steady his voice. “Listen, if you want to pretend that you can handle this on your own because you’re the great Sherlock Holmes who doesn’t need help from the intellectually less gifted, that’s fine by me. Pretend, for all I care. But I’m not walking out that door until I’m absolutely certain, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I won’t come back to find you lying on the floor. Do you understand me?!”
“I do. I can do that sometimes, you know, make deductions.” John smiles disarmingly. “It just only works on people I’m close to.”
Three years can’t be undone. John is married now. He’s devoted to another, to someone whom he loves, whom he has chosen to give himself to for the rest of his life. He can’t just ignore that.
John puts the shopping away before joining him on the sofa. He raises an eyebrow briefly at the black screen in front of him, obviously contemplating what Sherlock has spent all this time on if he hasn’t even turned the telly on. Sherlock thinks it best to leave him to his deductions.
“Yeah? Since when?” he counters.
It’s the quiet. It gnaws away at him already. It has no right to be this quiet. He lives in the middle of London for Christ’s sake, it’s never this quiet. There’s still the traffic outside his window, but it’s distant and constant, like a recording playing in another room. There’s no vibrancy, no unpredictability. Even the occasional honking of a car horn feels devoid of all intention. Empty cars without people. Sherlock assumes there are still people walking by, but he hasn’t the heart to check. What if he’s wrong? Even if he’s not, they remain silent. No voices reach him from the street. The sounds of traffic refuse to intermingle with the typical sounds of London life.
Mycroft stops.
Mary understands, more or less. She knows that talking about how he feels makes John uncomfortable and so she usually avoids the topic. She knows that John still finds it difficult to think about what happened and so she doesn’t try to get information out of him, but rather lets him come to her if he needs to get something off his chest. That’s one of the things about Mary that John has been attracted to from the beginning. She respects his feelings and lets him expose himself to her on his own terms. She understands what he needs. And if she doesn’t understand why, who could blame her? John barely understands these things himself. That took Sherlock Holmes too, apparently.
But Mycroft isn’t manipulated as easily as everyone else. He doesn’t take the bait.
, then maybe John would have considered thanking whatever divine intervention he may or may not have summoned. There’s just no such things as perfect miracles. That’s not the way the world works. John ought to know that by now, indeed he thinks he knows that by now, yet somehow it seems as though that harsh truth must be hammered home over and over again, by divine decree or not. John’s initial relief that Sherlock is alive is still there, but it seems more distant now. Though the immediate, panicked fear of losing Sherlock right then and there on the living room floor in Baker Street has been somewhat abated, thanks be again to that aforementioned deity, it has been replaced with a worry that almost seems even more vicious. Blame be on that same deity if they even exist.
There’s a round, reddened depression on John’s shoulder, the scar of a bullet that nearly took John away before they’d even met. Sherlock realises with a start that he’s never seen it before. He’s always known that it was there (truth be told – he’s sometimes fantasised about it), but it’s another thing entirely to see it in person. He can see the imperfect way in which the area has mended itself back together, the way it pulls slightly on the skin around it. It makes John look even more ferocious. Even more dangerous. Even more tempting.
“Come on, Sherlock. We’re losing you!”
It’s painful to admit it, but John doesn’t have anything else to say. The wish to simply let it all be undone, to pretend this never happened and go back to their easy, uncomplicated companionship flares up again and it takes all of John’s willpower to fight it back down.
understand, but he’s gone now. Because of Sherlock. He let him down. He willed him away, and away he went. Now there is no one to confide in, no one to share with, no one to understand. But it’s a situation Sherlock has brought upon himself, so there’s no point in sitting here wallowing in self-pity. It’s all his own fault. If he’d been a little stronger, a little more determined, a little less of an emotional, shrivelling mess, he could have walked out of this with everything he had worked for. Everything he had gambled his life, his health and his sanity on. But he couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it and he’ll not get a second chance.
“No. It’s not something I know. And it’s not something I always believe. Sometimes he does things that I… I can’t explain. And I can’t excuse. Sometimes he does things that he knows are wrong just to make himself look good. I don’t know how that fits into what I’ve just said. The truth is, I don’t know who he is deep down. I don’t always understand him and when I’m able to predict how he’s going to act in a certain situation… well, that’s a day for the history books to be sure. But I believe in him anyway.”
There’s a peculiar undertone, Sherlock realises, to his voice and to his face. He looks more amused than anything, yes, but there’s something else there as well. Something barely concealed, hiding just beneath the surface. Moriarty has never been particularly efficient at hiding his emotions. But it’s different this time. The emotion barely hidden beneath the surface… that’s usually malice and Sherlock is used to that. Knows how to deal with it, at least to a certain extent.
John doesn’t even have time to wonder why Sherlock would have oil in his drawers before he’s already opened the uppermost. To his surprise and suspicion, he finds a bottle of pharmacy-approved, state-of-the-art lubricant along with a packet of condoms that looks to be of significantly better quality than those John usually uses. He shoots Sherlock a dirty look, but all he gets in response is a shrug and a smirk.
Shit. He can’t say it. He can’t find the words. Sherlock is still looking at him, all innocent confusion, and it’s just making it worse. How does he manage to flip on a dime like that, again and again? Why can’t John pause him, take a moment to actually figure out what he’s thinking? Why must it always be like this?
“You know it’s not real, don’t you, Sherlock? Everything he’s telling you, everything he’s promising you that you can become… it’s not real. It never was.”
They’ve finished eating and are halfway through a contestant’s second attempt at a pavlova before John has mustered the courage to speak. He turns slightly to look at Sherlock, who’s propped up against the armrest on the couch, partly sitting and partly lying with a blanket thrown haphazardly on top.
But this is different. There’s so much meaning in those looks now. Sherlock seems to seek John out with his eyes as soon as he enters the room and refuse to look away when John meets his gaze. He's always looked away before, leaving John with the impression of being observed rather than being sought out for any sort of communication. It's not like that now. Now they’ll just stand there looking at each other without saying anything and yet it feels as though they’re saying everything. Only John isn’t quite sure what it is that they’re saying.
“In the kitchen.”
He looks at the front door, silent and tense, then enters and takes the stairs in five seconds flat with a speed, strength and agility that John wouldn’t have ascribed to him half an hour ago. It’s probably ill-advised and John, as his doctor, ought to put a stop to it, but Sherlock is gone before John has time to properly process what he’s doing.
Mycroft knows exactly what he’s doing, ripping out stitch after stitch with unerring precision. Drags the last syllable out for a painfully long moment. There is nothing accidental about this. But then again, what did Sherlock expect? Expose yourself and this is what happens. With Mycroft, the price for a blunder like this is just swifter and more precise than with anyone else.
“Why shouldn’t I? I’ve just asked, haven’t I?”
They make a sharp turn into a large, open area and there… there is John.
“No, I don’t understand.”
He tries to listen only to his brain, he really does. Despite what Sherlock might think, John isn’t entirely unfamiliar with the concept of suppressing one’s instinctive desires through logical thinking. John just doesn’t go through with it all the way as Sherlock seems to do. He doesn’t turn his desires off. He just… replaces them with more rational, respectable,
What is John thinking? In this moment, what does he think of? Does he think only of the now, of this kiss and this moment? Does he… does he perhaps think of Mary? Of what has just transpired between them and what his decision to kiss Sherlock now means for their relationship? Or does he perhaps think, as Sherlock does, of them? Of what they are now and what they will be from now on. Of how it could ever work, whatever
John feels cold all over. He just stares. Stands there and stares and knows not whether he looks angry or shocked or sad or happy or as though his entire world has collapsed into this single moment.
Everything that John Watson is and everything that he and Sherlock have… Jim Moriarty is the opposite. There is not a single cell in Sherlock’s body that trusts Moriarty, and that, too, feels as natural as breathing. But Sherlock knows him. Knows him perhaps more intimately than he knows John, which makes Sherlock feel like a horrible person every time the thought crosses his mind. But it
Of course, Sherlock can’t tell any of this to John. Words are not exactly his strongest suite and sentiment even less so. As he looks back out at John in the kitchen, watching him frantically moving from the table to the countertop with a half-empty bottle of champagne, he can’t even get himself to convey the general idea with simpler words. “I love you”, “You make me happy”, “I’m grateful to you” or even bloody “Merry Christmas” to signify that he does actually appreciate what John is trying to do here… all of those would at least go some way towards explaining how Sherlock feels. He just can’t. The ability to express these things is just not in him, neither in nature or in nurture. He might pride himself on his lack of sentiment most of the time, but sometimes his inability to properly express what he’s feeling is… not good.
Sherlock hesitates. His answer carries significant weight. He can feel it, even if, predictably, he doesn’t feel as though he fully grasps the meaning.
Sherlock mentally scrolls through his past sentence to identify the offending part of it.
to do, but what you
SPOILERS AHEAD: Do not read this if you have any plans of reading this chapter and haven't done so already. However, for those of you who decided based on the trigger warning at the top to not read this chapter, here's a short summary of what happened: John, who's staying at the hospital, is frustrated and angry that Sherlock isn't getting any better and that the doctors are unable to figure out what's actually wrong with him, seeing as his brain is functioning normally and there doesn't appear to be any reason for his prolonged unconsciousness, which is now moving onto day three. John is conflicted about his feelings for Sherlock and his feelings for Mary, but with Sherlock unconscious, there's just too much else on John's mind for him to properly deal with that confusion, so he instead chooses to redirect it into anger, an emotion he is much more comfortable with and doesn't need to dissect too much.
Sherlock hadn’t even looked at him as he’d replied “You know my methods, John. I am known to be indestructible.” The pompous bastard.
, dancing attendance somewhere in that uncontrollable brain of his? The thought doesn’t bear thinking about and yet John suddenly has to know.
This… this is not fun.
He doesn’t know what he was expecting to return to. Returning to John and Baker Street has been the one thought that Sherlock has used to hold himself up during the last two years, especially during the last couple of weeks in Serbia. Recreating Baker Street in his Mind Palace in as much detail as possible has been a favourite pastime of his while waiting in airports, while trying to sleep on what can only be described as fourth rate mattresses at best and especially while trying to block out the sound and feel of metal pipes hitting his lower abdomen. But returning to Baker Street and to John has been a vague dream until the last couple of days, a hazy future seeming very far away and almost completely out of reach. Trying to predict what he might find upon his return has seemed unimportant until now. Still, Sherlock can feel himself taken aback by the realisation that he has returned to a John and a Baker Street fundamentally different from the ones he left behind. He hadn’t been prepared for everything to have changed so fundamentally as it seems to have done. He had fully expected to find John in Baker Street, making tea and working at the local clinic and making second-rate chicken risotto. Walking into that restaurant and finding John sitting with a complete stranger that he now lives with, drinking wine and obviously having a good time, had unleashed a feeling in Sherlock not unlike being doused in icy meltwater. The whole situation had caught him completely off guard, which is why he had ended up acting on instinct. Crucial mistake. Acting on instinct in social situations isn’t exactly his strong suit and tonight had been no different.
John presses his lips together without meaning to. He’s always hated that particular quirk of his, it’s so easy to spot and so damning an indicator of his thoughts.
It’s an instantaneous response that seems to emerge from the deepest, most personal depths of his being.
No more.
Perhaps he’s deduced where John is going with this. He’s piercing John with his eyes. It has all the intensity of a glare, but he thankfully refrains from placing any actual animosity there. He can tell John means well, then, even if he’s most definitely trying to deter him from pursuing this any further.
it. He’s always embraced being different. It never really felt like he had much of a choice to begin with, but he embraced it nevertheless. He took pride it in, encouraged it, nurtured it, even boasted of it. And he’s always known that John didn’t choose the same. John chose to pretend to be normal. John chose to find ways to be with others by locating places where the different became the normal (the battlefield, the surgery) or, failing that, by squeezing himself into the box ascribed to him until he fit the mould.
The ten minutes or so from Mrs. Hudson calls 999 to the ambulance arrives feel like the longest ten minutes of John’s life. It’s worse than at Bart’s. As much as Sherlock throwing himself from the roof had made John’s world turn upside down, as much as his body hitting the ground had echoed in John’s ears for hours afterwards, as much as his blood slowly filling up the cracks between the tiles had provided fuel for John’s nightmares for years to come… as soon as Sherlock hit the pavement, it had been obvious that nothing more could be done. That it was all too late. And as horrible as that realisation had been, at least it’s better than this. Better than sitting here with Sherlock in his arms, unable to help him in any way no matter how desperately he might need it. Better than knowing that something is fundamentally, horrendously wrong with him and that every second might be vital and
“You had so much potential, Sherlock. So much potential. And here you are. You’ve thrown it all away.”
Sherlock smiles self-depreciatingly, feeling awkward, uncomfortable and horrible about his own timing. “Wasn’t right about you. Wasn’t right about many things that were about you.”
He should just ask her straight out what exactly this is all about. That would be the mature thing to do. But John is honestly too tired and emotionally wrung out to act mature right now and, truth be told, he
Mycroft Holmes reaches forward and places his hand on top of his brother’s.
The minutes pass. John tries to move, tries to push away the branches caging in his body, but nothing happens. Suddenly, there’s the sound of liquid being poured combined with an unmistakable scent of gasoline. The deduction is an easy one indeed, and John once again feels his already elevated heart rate accelerate further.
Then, of course, John has to go and ruin it by opening his mouth.
Sherlock reaches for the cup almost as soon as John has placed it within easy reach and takes a sip, but there’s no response to John’s questions and he drinks the tea in utter silence, eyes looking straight ahead unseeingly. It would be more unnerving if this wasn’t Sherlock, who regularly falls into reverential silence with a noise tolerance at zero. It’s nothing too out of the ordinary, at least not
He can’t see her face.
He's so close now that Sherlock can feel Jim's hot breath caressing his cheek. What he's offering... right in this moment, it feels as though it's everything that Sherlock has ever wanted. Why should he say no? Why should he deny himself?
and yet he was not unfeeling enough to be indifferent. He's been stuck all this time as surely as John.
But John dismisses the thought almost as soon as it appears. Sherlock would never do that, no matter his mood, no matter his feelings, no matter how far he might be pushed. Sherlock made him a vow, made both of them a vow. And if there’s one lesson it caused John so much pain to grasp that he will never forget it, it is that Sherlock cares more about his friends than he cares about himself. That there’s nothing he won’t do for John’s sake, for Mrs. Hudson’s sake, for Greg’s sake… for Mary’s sake. Mary is not just John’s wife. She’s also Sherlock’s friend, and he made that vow as much to her as he did to John.
What Sherlock
John wanted him to be more human. John
? It’s
“From London Business School.”
But that’s what happens in serious relationships, isn’t it? You begin interacting with people as a couple. You meet new people together and your old friends become common friends. A shift in the dynamic of previous friendships should come as no surprise. It’s normal, isn’t it? Healthy even.
For a moment, John hesitates, meaning to leave it at that. But he can do better and one glance at Sherlock reveals that he has to if he’s hoping for a response.
Sherlock hesitates a moment with his answer, which is perhaps a moment too long.
There is no doubt that Sherlock is in desperate need of help
“I wouldn’t be able to do it then. I’ve always tried to keep myself distant, to divorce myself from feelings, from sentiment… I’ve always pretended I could do it and it’s always been a lie. It’s been a lie, John! I wanted it to be true so badly, but I couldn’t do it, I didn’t know how to!”
A part of his brain is screaming at him to keep his bloody mouth shut and not ruin everything. If he speaks now, he can’t take it back. But then, they’re both stuck in this sometimes-perfect-sometimes-unbearable limbo until one of them decides to say something. It might as well be him.
. Sherlock’s lips feel tingly at the thought.
“No, it’s… it’s not just for cases. It started that way, years ago, but nowadays, I… use it to think about other things too. More… personal things. And before you ask, yes, I have replicated the actions of people I know before. Often, in fact. I anticipate the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devise. It’s very… helpful.”
Because Mary was the safe bet. There have been moments in which John has found himself suspecting that Sherlock might not be as entirely removed from emotional attachment as he always says. But there have also been moments, moments upon moments, in which John has found even some of his worst suspicions about Sherlock’s lack of human emotion confirmed with glaring clarity.
Jim smirks happily. Though, strictly speaking,
At that thought, a sharp stab of pain flares up inside of him and he hurries to suppress it. It’s almost a reflex. Analysis: unhelpful emotional response concerning John’s relationships. File number: 3341.
“John asked me to be his best man, how could I say no?”
It makes John feel… not bad, not per se. Conflicted would perhaps be a more fitting word to use. He’s grateful for her support, more than he could ever say. Isn’t it in moments like this, when everything is such utter shit, that people show themselves for who they really are? And Mary has turned out to be more than John could have ever hoped for. That makes him feel good. Thankful, content, perhaps a bit humbled. Confident that he made a good choice when he chose her.
Then Sherlock opens the door. He’s still in his sleepwear, though he’s put the dressing gown back on top. He obviously hasn’t rested much, if at all. He slumps slightly against the doorframe, supporting himself at least partially on the handle. He’s been thinking. It seems that whatever had occupied his mind earlier, he’s reached a conclusion. But it’s more than that. Even partly slumping, dressed in his dressing gown and a pair of pyjama pants, his expression is fierce enough to give pause to John and Mary alike. There’s fire in his eyes, but ice in his voice when he speaks.
Right at the moment, Sherlock and Mary are deep in a discussion that John is fairly certain concerns whether it’s a good idea to keep the same flowers throughout or whether it’s better to choose one composition for the entrance and another for the tables. At the same time, Sherlock looks to be researching wines that go well with salmon on his laptop while Mary is picking out fonts for the wedding invitations. It’s been almost ten minutes since either of them has spoken a word to John. Perhaps they’re counting on him doing whatever it was that they told him to do ten minutes ago.
He’s barely understandable, his speech slurred and his tongue wrapping around the words in unusual ways. But there’s no mistaking the sincerity in his broken apologies.
Finally, John settles on a question. “Have you been dreaming?”
But he hasn’t been brave enough to ask.
It’s tempting. So tempting. So final. Over and done with. Isn’t that the greatest reward Sherlock can hope for at this point? A release from the pain, the heartbreak, the loss, the death… It’s all good.
“Not very pretty, is it?”
“Stop…” Sherlock’s voice is feeble, half-strangled in his throat and forced out through his lips in a gush of air.
He wants to object. He wants to
Sherlock considers for a moment, looking almost comically torn between insisting that John stay and giving in to the temptation of spring pea risotto. Then he nods his agreement and, just like that, John gets up and goes to the kitchen to cook dinner as though this is all perfectly normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. Sherlock comes to join him, lifting himself up to perch on one of the counters like he used to in order to observe John while he cooks. It should be annoying, the way he’ll supervise John’s cooking as though he’s judging the quality without once offering to help, but John honestly just finds it kind of endearing. Sherlock has a very childish side to him that John is more enamoured by than he ought to be, and Sherlock’s habit of watching John’s cooking from the comfort of a countertop is a fine example of that.
John is no longer as numb to input from the outside world as he was this morning just after Sherlock had been admitted when he sat with Mycroft and felt as though the world was happening on the other side of a window. The final proof is the wave of self-recrimination rising up and towering in front of him when Mary closes the door behind her. John feels bad about his behaviour, his thoughts, his confusion. He feels bad that he’s hurting everyone around him because he can’t seem to get his shit together for five minutes. And he feels relief that he’s alone with his thoughts. And he feels guilt about feeling relief.
And Christ if Sherlock isn’t fighting with all he has to find his way back to that room in his Mind Palace. His John Watson room. He needs it. Not since Serbia has he needed that room as badly as he does not. But it’s just like falling asleep. The more you think about it, the harder you try, the more impossible it becomes. Entering his mind palace has been second nature to Sherlock since before he entered primary school. Things that instinctive can’t be explained. Easy enough when you know how it’s done, yet completely impossible to explain to someone who doesn’t. Now that Sherlock doesn’t, it’s just not possible for his mind to consciously think his way through to it. He’s stuck here, locked up all alone and cut off from every source of distraction or comfort.
Then shortly after meeting John, Sherlock had met Jim. Jim, who had completely confirmed everything Sherlock had thought he knew about other people, but simultaneously been able to offer him an alternative, a way of life he’d previously only been able to fantasise about. Those two possible paths had done battle in Sherlock’s head just as vigorously and for just as long as the two people responsible for introducing them had done battle in the real world and it had all come to a conclusion at the same time as the conflict between them reached its peak and progressed to its perhaps inevitable culmination.
But even that doesn’t matter. Because this choice was made before it was ever really a choice.
John used to think of his life as before and after the army. When he had been invalided out of the army, he’d thought that he was done maturing, that the army was the life experience that had made him come fully into himself once and for all. Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers was more John Watson than he had ever been before that time. Being invalided out had felt like being cut off from who he was and who he was meant to be. It had felt like losing himself. Replacing the real John Watson with a half-empty shell of him, limping, unemployed, poor and lonely, with no one to talk to other than a therapist convinced that he suffered from PTSD.
of seeing John happy with someone else, far away from Sherlock. Knowing that he was, after all,
He leaves the shop with a bright smile on his face. It's just begun to snow again.
It’s quiet. The kind of quiet that makes it seem as though the particles have frozen into place, refusing to carry any sound to him. He fancies he can hear his own heartbeat, feel its steady push-pull in his chest. Perhaps that’s a good thing, but its effect on him is unsettling. It feels wrong somehow, as though it’s not really his own heart. It’s a fleshy muscle that isn’t his, push-pulling within a cavity in a chest that isn’t his, sending blood through veins that aren’t his either. An organic mechanic to keep a body alive, but that body is not
It would be maddening if John wasn’t almost too emotionally drained to feel maddened by it. To be maddened by something feels like too much of a complicated emotion to figure out right now. Which brings him back to his anger and his frustration and all his other horrendous coping mechanisms that make him see himself as a horrible person. And on and on the circle goes. But it’s a downward spiral.
“My name’s Sherlock,” John blanched.
“Maybe, but not today. I’ve finally set up a suspect board, and I want to follow up on some things,” Mrs. Hudson sighed and reluctantly handed Rosie back over to John.
“Keep up the good work, and let’s continue to try and make some more headway here,” with that, he left, John’s hand still poised above his paper, pen in hand. With a huff, he followed.
“None. It’s baffling us all. This has to be the work of a professional, or at least someone very experienced. There has to be an explanation,”
“But Sherlock, you haven’t looked at them at all,” Sherlock’s eyes snapped to his with such force that the poor man stepped back, realizing his error.
“I don’t know,” the heaviness in the air seemed to stretch on forever as John watched Sherlock’s mouth purse, relax, and purse again. He arranged his words carefully.
As Sherlock drank the tea he had earlier so bluntly refused from Lestrade, John watched him. Mycroft chided him in his head. He really was quite an emotional child, you know. But, John Watson, caring is not an advantage. John’s eyes didn’t listen and they traced down from his unruly curls to the slide of his mouth on the teacup. God, John thought, I can’t even focus when there are three dismembered people laying just outside a door. His adrenaline was palpably not centered on the matter of importance. Sherlock put the teacup down with a soft clink and assumed his thinking position, index fingers pressed against his lips, thumbs on his chin and palms together. The last thing John noticed before Sally Donovan broke the steady silence was that Sherlock’s eyes were no longer so troubled. John’s shoulders relaxed.
ahhhhhh it's been so long !!! here is chapter 3. writing from john's perspective is so much more fun lollll. i hope everyoone who reads it enjoys it <3 this one is super angsty but chapter 4 hopefully coming soon isn't toooo bad ;)
“That bad, is it?” John noted wearily. Greg barely moved.
“Do you take sugar?”
The tall detective was the first to the door, coat whipping in the cool autumn wind as he rapped on the door, once, twice- John’s hand caught his wrist.
“Sherlock?” the man’s bright eyes glittered. Wait. Not bright. They were a deep brown.
“Um, it was… special. Might take a while. Nothing groundbreaking yet, I can assure you,” John knew Mrs. Hudson could practically smell the lie, but she kept quiet and, wishing him and Sherlock a good evening, tittered her way out of the apartment. He heard her muttering about her evening soothers as she tromped down the stairs. How could one older woman have so much energy? John thought. He could barely get out of bed in the morning and he doubted if he didn’t have Rosie, he probably wouldn’t.
“Thank god,” Sherlock’s silky voice splashed down the hall, the sarcasm seeping through the cracks of John’s bedroom door, “It’s eleven o’clock John, we’re going to be late for Lestrade. Again. And since your body seems to need sustenance every few, pathetic hours, you can stop at the cafe on your way out. I’m getting a taxi. I need to think,” John let out a controlled breath and tried to smile. It still felt more like a grimace, but at least he wouldn’t have to feel like he was falling short of Sherlock’s genius the whole cab ride to Scotland Yard. He didn’t need more of that.
“I watched that man put a bullet in his brain, and unfortunately I cannot say the same for you,” ice filled the room as Holmes roughly pried Anderson’s hands off of the cop and into a pair of heavy handcuffs. Sherlock was shaking with exhilaration.
“Mrs. Hudson, please. She’s getting chubby,” but he couldn’t help but laugh as she tickled the baby’s cheeks.
“So, where are you off to after a night like this?” Will leaned his chin on his hand, long fingers splayed along his soft, flushed cheek. John couldn’t stop staring, not realizing he was still waiting for an answer.
“-You need to learn to trust my huge brain. My pot of knowledge overflows,” Sherlock added some flair to that statement, hands and fingers flying through the air. Lestrade gaped at him.
Sherlock gasped for breath on the cold stone floor. Fluorescent lights switched on with a whir and he found Jim and Eurus staring down at him. The mastermind was grinning, while Eurus was crying. She was in a straight jacket, Moriarty clutching her arm so hard that purple marks had begun to appear on her bicep. As her mouth moved, begging for help, Jim’s voice slithered from it.
“Only for you, Greg,” Sherlock quipped. At least he had learned Lestrade’s name, John thought.
So far, the suspect board had five people: Moriarty, because John couldn’t bring himself to discount him; Eurus, because it had happened once; Sally Donovan, mostly because of his personal vendetta, but John felt there was substantial cause as well; Anderson??? had three question marks after it, for it was the man that had been nagging at Watson’s thoughts but evading him for weeks, and he had been missing for years; and a broad ‘employee’ of Jim Moriarty.
“Like… This,” Will leaned in.
Will pulled him inside his apartment, the door shutting dramatically behind them. Together, they swayed like a boat about to capsize. John couldn’t stop running his hands through Will’s hair, making goosebumps appear on the man’s neck and his flushed lips part.
Sherlock shook as he slowly reached with one hand to untie the jacket and break the chains that held Moriarty to the grimy well-wall. He was powerless. His shirt sleeves slipped as he extended his other arm, speckled white scars glinting in the fluorescent light.
Trapped, he slid to the floor.
Mrs. Hudson was in the kitchen, feeding Rosie and cooing almost more than the baby herself. She turned and smiled when she saw him. Rosie was still happily obsessing over her food.
“The public is freaking out, they don’t know what to do or who to turn to. I thought I would be able to keep this case contained, but the press had other plans. Bloody Donovan talked to them, apparently. Can’t keep anyone in this fucking place in line,”
The state of the office was fit for Sherlock, John thought. The walls were practically dripping with pins and clippings, string and paper with ripped edges. The desk was a mess of documents and letters, folders strewn open half-off of the table, as close to giving up as the man who sat in front of them.
His eyes caught on the most recent bullet point; Lunch date??? What did it mean? His thoughts were interrupted by Mrs. Hudson tittering in the stairwell. Sherlock strode over and flung open the door.
“I would propose a cigarette, but I have the baby with me,” Sherlock began, “I need to know who you had lunch with yesterday,” Greg blanched.
“I’m making a perfectly logical assumption based off the eleven years of experience I have had with you,” Sherlock smirked, seeming to play with the bewildered look on Lestrade’s face, “however, I am prepared to be surprised.”
“Oh, I’m sure Sherlock could find a way to disagree,” John muttered. If Greg heard, he made no comment.
“Would you care to stop and get us some more tea?” she scoffed.
“He’s not still out there. You know that, right?” John uttered, fearing for anything that wasn’t a confirmation.
He could see the way his eyes twitched, the look of madness fresh in his pupils. The way his hair was plastered to his forehead, the sweat falling, following his thinning hairline. The second one muscle in his arm twitched, Sherlock had him.
“No, thank you,” the sparse memories of the night before were piecing themselves together. He felt sick. What had he done?
“Hello, handsome,” the room melted together as John turned his head. He felt a steady hand on his upper arm. Sherlock stared back at him. He rubbed his eyes and opened them again. Definitely not Sherlock. The tall man ran a hand through his thick, dark curls.
The apartment was nice; very white. Everything had its place, yet there was room for lots of trinkets and photos. John liked it.
“March,” he ordered.
“Everything alright?” he asked tentatively. Sherlock, not wanting to waste time and breath responding, simply swept himself past the shorter man, dropping John’s phone into his palm on the way out. He picked up Watson from the kitchen and sat down in his chair with her. she was a bit like his new skull, he mused. Practically mute, and a bit dumb.
Mycroft’s voice was muted, but not unintelligible, on the other end of the line.
“I don’t know what you mean. She’s just plump enough,” they sat in silence as they finished their tea, the sweet air from the bakery drifting up and the music from Sherlock’s violin drifting down.
As any parent would, he had doubts. Was a man like him, with a past like his, fit to be raising a child? He had generally let John take care of most things in the beginning, but had quickly realized how unfair that was. Now, it was like Rosie was his only anchor. She knew what was real. Sherlock didn’t. As his thoughts wandered further and further from discernment, his body betrayed him. Watson was fast asleep against his chest, and soon his head bowed down to join her.
“So...” Watson took out his little notebook, “We’re looking for someone highly trained, knows forensic countermeasures, but doesn’t have access to high quality equipment... Someone obsessed with the police?” With Sherlock?” John mused. Lestrade looked lost. Before he could ask anymore questions, Donovan barged into the office.
The most exasperating part for Sherlock was that he was absolutely sure the answer was obvious. He bit his lip, the anger bubbling up inside him as a drop of blood slid down his chin. he absentmindedly wiped it away. He had really thought he could put the past behind him. Why wouldn’t it stay? Sherlock decided to visit Bart’s. Dead people were the only ones who truly offered no disturbance.
John yawned and stretched, his shirt rising above his waistband, a slap of cold air hitting his stomach. He could hear Rosie gurgling in the next room on the quiet Sunday morning. Almost a year old now, she called John Dada and Sherlock Papa. John smiled and picked her up, bringing her to the kitchen for some food before dropping her off downstairs with Mrs. Hudson.
“Younger sister, in fact,” Sherlock clarified for him.
One of the most important lessons for John Watson of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers to learn was that life goes on. People go to war and die, but life goes on. Some people are murdered and others commit terrible crimes, but life goes on. The people closest to you can tragically and suddenly lose their lives, but life goes on. No matter how hard it was, John just had to keep trying to believe it. Most days, it was still tremendously difficult without her. He could see her in Rosie, the way the light bounced off her blonde curls, the vividness of her big blue eyes when she opened them wide to laugh. But the one thing that bothered John was that it wasn’t like losing Sherlock. Mary was strangely, annoyingly, different.
“No, not at all. That’s not what I meant, John. I meant… I used to be like you. I think I might understand what’s happening to you,”
“Sherlock…” he began, looking up. The detective was patiently waiting, hands clasped behind his back and a feigned look of curiosity splayed across his royally perfect visage, “This man… He was Connie Prince’s brother,” a look of realization flooded John’s face as Sherlock nodded, “...and Martha Powers--she had to be a relative of Carl Powers,”
“The great game was one of the first cases where we encountered Moriarty. Remember, where he threatened to blow people up if Sherlock didn’t solve the cases?” Lestrade looked just as muddled. Even John didn’t consider himself this dense, “Coincidentally, they were also the cases of Carl Powers, Connie Prince, and Alex Woodbridge,” Sherlock nodded, seemingly pleased with this summary of events.
“Come on, Sherly. What’re you so afraid of? You’ve fought me before. But…” his face leered above Sherlock, mouth stinking of chemicals, “What if this time, you didn’t?” His tongue clicked and the lock sprang open, white jacket slipping off with ease, chains falling to the ground with a deafening noise. Then all hell broke loose.
“I love you, Mary,” Rosie shifted in her crib as if she had heard.
“Lovely,” he muttered as he gingerly wiped it onto his shirt, and shifted her to send the email. If he did not receive a reply in two days time, it would be up to Sherlock to uncover the truth.
“Oh, yes, I’m sure,” Mycroft drawled, “I will believe that the minute you can confide in me with confidence the name of the human that has committed this… troublesome crime,” Sherlock felt his mouth was surely boiling.
John had not moved from the spot. Sometimes, Sherlock felt that his compatriot’s intelligence was also regressing. Then again, a little voice said, was his not as well?
“Awww, don’t be scared! Come out and play! Little Sherly is always scared! Don’t be! Come out and play! Come out and play!” the words reverberated around Sherlock’s mind, bouncing off his skull and entering through every available crevice. He tried to scream, but it only made everything louder. As he banged on the door, the spider spun Sherlock into his web, the silky sweet voice bubbling through the chaos.
“Yes,” the liqueur churned in John’s stomach, and he watched the man unbutton his purple shirt.
“What to give you this morning? Let’s see... “ John rummaged through the fridge, attempted to find something edible and not made from human remains, “How about some applesauce, huh? Rosie loves applesauce, doesn’t she?” John handed her the bowl and spoon, which she took to enthusiastically and with a slight squeal. John winced, yawning again as he briefly returned to his bedroom to pick out their clothes for the day. He couldn’t even remember what case they were working on now. It was a new one, John expected. The one he and Sherlock had been working on previously had involved lots of mud and some angry rodents. He was eager to forget about it. His phone dinged in the kitchen.
The cold water helped, although minimally. Unfortunately, raising the water bill would not stop his thoughts. As he finished drying off, Sherlock was careful to avoid his arms. Instead, he stuffed them, wet, into his shirt sleeves. That was a problem for another night.
The baby carrier did not fit Sherlock very well. After ten minutes of the detective deciding whether it looked better over or under his coat, they headed to Scotland Yard. It was late when they arrived, Rosie already having dozed off in the cab, head cradled on Sherlock’s shoulder. As he swung open the doors of Lestrade’s office, he could feel Sally Donovan’s wide eyes behind him. Greg jerked awake at his desk as Sherlock rapped his knuckles against the wood.
A phone rang in the other room. Annoyed, John shouted at Sherlock to pick it up. Rosie babbled to herself as the phone continued to ring. John sighed and picked it up off the sitting room side table. The caller ID blinked up at him.
sorry for like the crazy wait omg. finally  up !!! im trying to punch the next few out but im soooo busy so please bear with me !! :)
“Are you sure?” Will whispered. HIs touch was gentle, and kind. No matter how much he hated it, it was exactly what John wanted. He pulled Will onto him and let his hands explore.
“That man again? He must be truly enrapturing,” John’s breath stopped. He could feel his heart skipping beats as he removed the pillow from his face. He was, indeed, not in his bedroom. The man now perched on the end of the bed, although not without resemblance, was definitely not Sherlock. Oh, fuck. Was the only thought that John’s mind was capable of conjuring.
“John! We’ve got him John. Let’s go, Gil- Greg and the rest of the squad are heading over now. I’ve left Rosie with Mrs. Hudson,” he hardly listened as he heard tired grumbling coming from the back of the apartment. Must’ve
“Greg, please do stop staring at me quite so intently. It must be a strain on your eyes. As I mentioned quite clearly outside, I will go examine the corpses when you tell me what you have deduced already, as little as that might be,” Lestrade’s eyes widened, clearly still shocked that Sherlock would even think to ask his opinion. At least, John hoped, this was because Sherlock was confident it really wasn’t Moriarty or people working for him. He brought his attention back to the room and saw Greg gasping like a fish out of water.
Get Watson downstairs and hurry over.
Sherlock woke to the incessant knocking on his door.
“Donovan is inside, I’ll let her know we’re here and then I’ll take you two back,” Lestrade swiftly shut the door behind him and John could hear his receding footsteps. Meanwhile, Sherlock was looking rather perplexed, examining everything from the paneling on the side of the house to the tiny scratches on the screen door.
“Lunch, Lestrade,” he twitched, “I have an itch that whoever you ate lunch with yesterday is my prime suspect,” the DI’s eyes popped.
“Greg, call for you. It’s time for your lunch meeting,” John’s brow furrowed.
Four shots later, John was feeling comfortably relaxed. John supposed it couldn’t hurt to order another. And after that, one more. Having one too many shots after the day he had had… That couldn’t be a crime, John decided. The clock ticked, blurring. It settled on 11:30.
“I’m going to collect some samples, tell Donovan we’re done here,” and without waiting for an answer, Sherlock began swabbing and picking.
“Most likely,”
“So you really don’t know anything about this case, then?” John asked, not really expecting a response. Maybe he could make himself useful by writing down some observations.
“Oh, here it is. So, we’ve found the murder weapon. Apparently, our bloke is into construction as well,”
John was shaking him. As his eyes fluttered open, a colorful jumper reached over his face to grab a crying Watson, grumbling about all the noise he made while he slept. John stumbled into the kitchen with the baby, cooing all the way. Sherlock set his head back and sighed. His fingers twitched as he rubbed his eyes, cool thumbs pressed to the lids. Two nightmares, he thought. One in life, one in sleep. When would they end?
Tonight, it was the cell. He felt the steel door shut him in with a deafening clang as the room materialized around him. The straight jacket clad figure kneeling on the floor lifted his eyes. Sherlock barely managed to hold back the panic and screams that built up in his chest as the soul-sucking brown eyes locked with his. Endless night against a bright, multi colored dawn. Sherlock couldn’t move.
“Why not,” the man slid gracefully into the seat next to his. Although, John noticed, he had to steady himself with a strong grip on the bar. Great. They were both wasted.
“How can you be sure? There’s no proof that it was him, really,” Greg was, quite honestly, horrified.
“How did you do it? How? He’s still here, just like you were! HOW DID YOU DO IT?” the madman panted, his arms shaking from the effort of fighting the officers. Sherlock walked right up to him, putting his nose as close to Anderson’s as he dared. A drop of sweat pettered to the end of his nose. Sherlock watched it fall, and took a breath. As he spoke, Anderson hung onto his every syllable.
Although their violin-playing hours were calming and deeply loved by his parents, Sherlock could not help but hate Eurus. There was a simple logic to it, he had convinced himself. She had killed his childhood best friend, the person who had mattered to him most in the entire world. Victor. Then, she had tortured and tried to kill him, his brother, and the man that he now cared for more than anyone, John. Sherlock could not bring himself to love someone that had wanted to destroy everything he had ever loved, for his whole life.
“And the last woman--I spoke to her once. Interviewed her about Alex Woodbridge. She was his flatmate,” John furrowed his brow and thought for a moment more, “The great game…” he muttered, remembering the name he had given that particular case on his blog what seemed like all those years ago. Sherlock looked ruffled, still refusing to accept John’s blogging habit. John happened to know he secretly loved it. Lestrade, who felt quite left behind, spoke up.
“Anderson,” Sherlock spit. He had done his best to keep close tabs on all members of Scotland Yard after his ‘death’ and watching Anderson squirm under the supposed knowledge that
“You’ll never solve my little puzzle without my help. Come on Sherlock, pulllll yourself together! We’re the same, remember? I’m a part of you.” Moriarty’s teeth gnashed, “Chaining me up won’t do you any good,” Sherlock whimpered. He wanted out. Any out.
“Stop your stupid alliteration games. I want you to quit calling John to worry about me. Everything is fine.”
“John! Standing there like a statue, you frightened me! Come, have something to eat, or some tea? You must be famished after your day,” John graciously accepted the food, practically shoving it down his gullet. He really hadn’t realized how long it had been since his last meal.
“Greg,”
Rosie was devouring biscuits as if she’d never seen sugar before.
As he reached the doorstep of 221B Baker Street, John stopped. He was so tired of this back and forth, with no real information presenting itself. He knew the killer, he was sure. After all these years, with his only focus being Sherlock and everything about him, John was sure he had to know who it was. As he turned the key in the lock, John welcomed the distraction of returning to Rosie.
The floorboards creaked as Sherlock glanced John peering through the doorway.
“Mrs. Hudson, I’m going out tonight. Do you mind taking Rosie?” the older woman’s face basically glowed.
“You have no idea what’s happening to me,” John could feel himself losing control, “I lost everything in the war when my family fell apart. Then, I lose my best friend for two years, and once I meet the love of my life, he comes back. Now, she’s dead, and I-” his voice cracked, “I don’t know what I’m feeling,” he breathed out, shakily. The coffee wasn’t helping anymore. John can feel Will’s wide mouth stare, the way his body tensed, unprepared for the spew of information.
“I have no idea. On the other hand, these bloody eye bags haven’t been all for nothing,”  he rummaged through the sea of his desk and John leaned forwards. He noticed the DI hadn’t even asked where Sherlock had been the past month. Did he know something?
John has never felt so tantalized. The leads on the case are as cold as Sherlock's attitude towards John, and he can't keep up with Rosie's constant state of exuberance. However, hope is unveiled with the help of Lestrade, and Sherlock comes back briefly. John snaps and makes a life-changing decision, for good or bad. When will he come to terms with who he truly is?
“We’ll get him,” John said, as the door swung open. He was highly attentive to the group of officers at his back, fully armed. He noticed Anderson’s hand behind his back, wrist swinging with nervousness, itching at something that Sherlock couldn’t see.
It had been a month since the mysterious triple murder, and it was still nowhere near solved. After visiting the scene of the crime, the flashbacks, dreams, and anxiety had just gotten worse.
Eventually Sherlock heard John’s footsteps recede down the hallway. The visions flashed again, so violently that his eyelids snapped open. He tried his best to focus on the patterns the raindrops made on the windowpane as he gingerly rose from his bed. A shower would be good, he thought.
Sherlock stumbled over to his chair, the wall in the living room peppered with decade-old holes, covered only partially by the suspect board that John had set up the day before. Gulping down some tea that had appeared in the kitchen, hoping it would ease his head, Sherlock sighed and resigned to the job at hand. There could be nothing worse, he decided, than sitting around waiting for someone else to solve this case. Clearly it was not what he needed, as much as he wanted to avoid the problem at hand.
“So, how many brilliant ideas have you got this time, freak? Quite the puzzle, even for you,” Donovan seemed so sure of herself, undoubtedly thinking Sherlock would be too frightened or baffled to continue on with the case.
“I don’t know what that’s like, you’re right. I didn’t mean to minimize your experiences, John,” Will paused, his easy breaths ruffling the paper napkin in front of him, “Can I ask you something?” John nodded, “Do I remind you of him?”
“Oh, there you are, beloved baby brother.”
He looked up, and the person grunted something in reply. Mrs Safely smiled at him, before gesturing to a set of shelves just a short way off from where Sherlock was sat. The man nodded his thanks, and disappeared off into the maze of shelves. Sherlock sighed and shuffled back down in his seat, allowing the silent beast to claim him once more.
John chuckled and nodded, holding Rosie close.
Sherlock nodded. “I’ll pay,” he said, but made no attempt to move out of bed. “My wallet is in my dressing gown.”
“You can’t know that.”
And John hadn’t stopped smiling since.
Those were the good days. The good conversations. The days where they almost reached a version of normality with which Sherlock could live without complaint.
“Hey, don’t go in there,” Sherlock said, frowning as the wolf turned around with John’s favourite cable-knit jumper in its mouth. “Put that down, it belongs to John.”
Sherlock looked at him. “What?”
“A relationship.”
Since then, she'd managed to worm her way into an office in the Harth Parliament (the main organisation that dealt with all the political aspect of people's Abilities), and there she had stayed for an annoyingly long amount of time. The Holmes family had had to up sticks and move to London, but that really wasn't a hardship on Sherlock's part.
“We’re getting off topic” Sherlock said, his glare settling in again. “What happened? What is the normal way?”
“Where do you think you’re going?” John murmured, his voice as cold as the North Sea crashing against the rocks behind them. “Running away from your problems? Again?”
John hadn’t meant to lose his temper, but as his speech grew and as the storm clouds darkened and lightning and thunder moved closer to the shoreline something within John snapped. Maybe it was the alcohol, his cheek rosy from the whisky he’d been sipping by the fire. And Sherlock, sandwiched between John and the sea, was helpless in the tirade.
John thought about it for a moment, before nodding. "Yes. The only person you ever put in danger is yourself. With a couple of exceptions, and most of the time that exception is me. Besides, they'd have slowed you down. There's no way you'd want them with you." John offered him a small smile. "It's not your fault. Your brother will calm down, and Lestrade just had to look like he was doing something about it."
But today, he was going to make things right. He was going to correct his numerous past mistakes, and he was finally going to stop being so bloody British and lose that god awful trait he had of never voicing his feelings. Anything out of the ordinary was wrong and god, did John crave some normality in his life.
She really was a very happy baby.
“Come and sit on the bed,” John said. “I’ll clean up that graze too, while I’m at it.”
Sherlock shrugged and closed his eyes.
"I've always wanted to burn this place down," he reasoned. John looked at him and grinned, and Sherlock found himself grinning just as brightly back.
“About what, Sherlock?” John asked. “Because last time you said that we needed to talk....”
Why hadn’t Sherlock told him?
John  been up for most of the night. Every time he closed his eyes remnants of Afghanistan exploded across his dreams and the shrapnel tore into his slumber. He’d woken sweaty, shivering, and completely on edge for fear he’d climb out of bed and step on an explosive.
Someone was rubbing sandpaper against his face. Sherlock tried to shove it away but he was so weak he could barely move his arm. He grunted, and the sandpaper stopped.
“A consulting detective…?” He asked, somewhat skeptic.
Sherlock nodded. He wasn’t quite sure what to reply to John’s anecdote; John’s consistent laments about Mary’s death had darkened any of the positive factors of their relationship. The usual husband and wife things had been overshadowed by their extended lives, and it didn’t help that Mary had done a runner to Morocco.
Sherlock was crouching down in the centre of the river channel, bum almost touching the rippling current as rummaged around in the stream, turning over a pebble. Her dark brown hair glistened in the messy bun it was tied up in, and a smug grin settled across John’s face. She'd helped to wash Sherlock’s hair that morning.
The man was standing. Two strong hands gripped John’s arms and tugged him back down to Earth.
“I’ve met serial killers,” Sherlock hummed, “you’re not one of them.” He let go of John’s hand and turned back towards the staircase. John closed the front door.
The days his mother and father died were two very strong contenders. His father had suffered a heart attack while on holiday in Barmouth, and his mother had died in a car crash a few years later. The day he had been shot hadn’t been particularly fantastic, and the day Sherlock had thrown himself off the top of St Bart’s was most certainly a day John didn’t ever want to remember.
He turned over the page, smiling to himself as the library slipped back into silence.
Branches cracked and snapped above them as the wind tore through the trees. John gripped Harry’s hand, eyes focused resolutely on the ground as he splashed through streams in his little yellow wellington boots. It was dark. Very dark. Their only source of light came from the torch Harry held. She pointed it at the ground, helping John navigate the uneven forest floor. Grey clouds had rolled across the sky and blocked the moonlight long ago. John’s legs were beginning to ache.
“John!”
“More?” He asked slowly. John nodded.
John had seen Sherlock cry on three different occasions. Really cry. Not faking it for a case, not when he’d walked into the kitchen while John was cutting onions. But genuine, full blown sobbing.
She sighed quietly to herself as she heard the front door slam. It was almost sickening how often she had to get the hinges and locks fixed whenever John was around.
“Scars? He never told me.”
“And that’s what you’re worried about?” John asked. “Being happy?”
“Maybe?”
“Is that nice?” He asked, as a great furry head was pushed against his hand. “Is that good?” Sherlock chuckled and the beast moved forwards, and suddenly Sherlock realised that the sandpaper he’d felt was actually a tongue. It scratched his face again, and Sherlock chuckled. The thumping was a tail against the duvet.
“You’re moving in too?” He asked, a bit surprised.
"I'm going to have to carry you," he told him. John looked puzzled.
"What?" Sherlock asked, frowning.
“No, actually,” John supplied, smiling guiltily. “The same hotel room. If that’s alright with you?”
Sherlock lent forwards a bit more, gripping onto the thick wooden side of the bookcase. As he did so, his hand slipped on the varnished surface and he stumbled, slamming one foot down with such force that he thought Mrs Safely would come running. He no longer had the shelf for a shield, and was standing only a few metres away from where Jim and John were conversing in full view of the pair of them. The high bookcases mocked his idiocy, and he felt an embarrassed blush rising in his cheeks.
"Kid, get out of here!" One of them yelled, brandishing his arm for Sherlock to follow. "There's a fire!"
“No we don’t. I do look at the cost, Sherlock, and special discount or not you pay way more than me. I’m not stupid. I know that half the time you put the money back into my account.”
“And yet you’re still willing to go on holiday with me,” Sherlock quipped. “I presume we’ll be staying in hotels at some point. Different rooms? Please tell me that at least one of them has a balcony so that I can claim it,” he couldn’t pretend to not be excited. He was going on holiday. With John. He almost felt like joining in with the robins’ cheery tune.
And if John had have gone with him, if Sherlock had simply been better at communication and if he had worked smarter against Moriarty in the first place, John could have been a wonderful accomplice. No one would have questioned John’s return to war after Sherlock’s death. From what Sherlock had gathered from minimal deductions, John had taken a leaf out of Harry’s book and found the whiskey, just as he’d done when Mary had died.
“Okay. I'll send someone to pick you up in an hour or so. Is that alright, babe?” Instead of looking at Jim, John remained staring at the place where Sherlock had been. Jim noticed this, and his short-tempered fuse blew once again. “What the hell are you looking at?” He demanded, squaring up to John. John quickly backed out of his trance, going slightly pale as Jim took a step closer. There was hardly room for breath between them; John’s chest seemed to have stopped rising and falling under his thick jumper as he stared fearfully up at the man; his whole being frozen as Jim set ablaze.
“Tommo, Timmo, make sure we’re not disturbed,” Todd said. The two men standing at Sherlock’s 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock departed. One went to the opening of the alleyway behind Sherlock, the other, to the one in front. The other men shuffled to fill the gap. Todd, the man Sherlock had initially been chasing, now stood directly in front of him.

“Now, I can escort you to A&E or you can come with me to the nearest first aid kit, wherever that may be.”
John stopped, and an irate woman wrapped in fur tutted as she almost collided into the back of him.
Opposite him, John brushed Rosie’s tufty hair with his fingers and fiddled with the velcro of her shoes, which were wonky.
Sherlock blinked, releasing a breathily short laugh before continuing.
Part of him was amused at Sherlock’s attempt at small talk, while sitting in a cramped restaurant eating lunch. A larger part of him was on guard, however. Sherlock rarely asked questions without having a serious motive for wanting to know their answer; he usually just deduced the answer without having to ask the question at all.
“Were you waiting on the other side?” John chuckled.
John nodded, setting his mug down. He leaned against the kitchen counter.

For a brief moment, puzzlement flashed across Sherlock’s face as he considered what John had said, and John watched him with equal confusion.
John supposed he had Sherlock to thank for that.
"Believed to be working for the devil, many women during the medieval period in Europe were hunted, trialled and very often killed under the false accusation of being witches.
He was interrupted by John’s arms wrapping themselves around him, and pulling him into a bone crushing hug.
The wolf looked up at Sherlock, tilted his head to the side, and then trotted from the room. Sherlock stared after it, then quickly checked the rest of his body for anymore serious injuries. A broken leg was one thing.
“Oh, yes, it’s been amazing! And Tord has been amazing, too.” She linked arms with the tall blonde man standing next to her, who beamed.
Sherlock sat bolt upright. Every muscle in his body screamed in protest, but he didn’t care. He needed to find John.
“What is it?” He asked.
“Right…” the voice sounded uncertain. “Any luck on the flatmate front?”
The wolf barked, wagging his tail.
Hi, thank you for reading this far! It means A LOT. And I don’t have the New Animal Crossing Game so genuinely this is all that’s keeping me going at the moment.
“I know.” Sherlock nodded. “But that’s not why I’d like to keep our relationship a secret.” He stood up and made his way to the fireplace.
“Did you feel that?”
Mrs Hudson sighed with all the contention of a woman who was simply bored with an argument, rather than a woman who had simply lost an argument.
"You're lying to me," She immediately cut across. "You started the fire."
Sherlock carelessly ran his fingers over the badge pinned to the lapel of his jacket, feeling every bump and scratch it's somehow managed to sustain over the many years he'd owned it. While most patients only required a normal badge; he was there so often that they didn't bother with giving him a standard stick-on one whenever he had an appointment, instead they gave him a shiny silver one.
Sherlock shook his head. He flopped back into his slouch, exhausted with every breath.
“I didn’t say you were.”
“I forgot to ask,” Jim started talking again, and Sherlock found himself listening intently, coming out of his musings about John’s clothing. “How did it go last night? You went straight to bed, and when I came up you were fast asleep. Was everything alright?”
Sherlock’s hands were stuffed deep into his pockets and his cheeks burned pink from the December cold, reminding John that he was very much alive as a shiver ran through the detective, the wind picking up. Sherlock’s scarf was drawn a little tighter than usual, and John noticed that he’d chosen the thick woollen one which Rosie had gifted him for Christmas.
“Both,” Sherlock replied slowly. “John, I can’t help but think we might kill one another if we tried to stretch our friendship into…” his throat felt strangely restricted “into romance.”
John ignored him.
John pulled a pair of thick woolly gloves from his jacket pocket and pushed them into Sherlock’s hand. The exchange wasn’t witnessed, but Sherlock slipped the gloves on. A second later, Sherlock’s palm was being pushed against John’s and John squeezed Sherlock’s hand gently, barely believing what was happening but he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t have acted if it wasn’t what he needed.
Smiling to himself, John took a tea towel to dry his hands and flicked the kettle on. He then set out four mugs and a plate of custard creams.
Sherlock nodded. “Chinese works,” he said, then quickly in attempt to squash the awkward silence which had infected the room: “how was work?”
“Have what?”
“And we’re not going to run out of toilet paper,” John said. “And I don’t like that you called me obtuse.”
Sherlock often described his brain as a hard-drive. A machine. The component of a robot. John knew that Sherlock wasn’t a machine, though sometimes the reminder was appreciated. To see Sherlock dreaming humanised him slightly. But of course he knew that Sherlock was human. Of course he knew.
It ran wild through the building, barely missing the rich mahogany shelving which stood to attention in sharp lines across the expanse room; stationed in high blockades parallel to the arched windows on either side, filtering through the soft early morning sunlight. Dust particles danced and swam in the air, settling on the books that were more unloved than the rest, waiting for someone to run their finger across the cracked leather spines in search for the subject or story they wanted.
John chuckled. “That’s quite a mouthful,” he said, and was surprised to find that there were tears welling up in his eyes. “But it’s beautiful.”
Slowly, she stood up and picked the tin of biscuits off the kitchen counter - desperate times call for desperate measures – and began her journey upstairs.
Mrs Hudson nodded excitedly.
"You're one to talk," Sherlock grinned, and John smiled happily, wrapping Sherlock's hair bobble around her wrist; pecking the corner of Sherlock's mouth in return.
Black smoke blocked the lights like thick storm clouds cover the sun, and the corridor was cast into an unnerving darkness. The only light source being the orange flames running along the walls and catching onto the artwork displays.
“John’s old therapist,” Sherlock supplied. “We’ve decided it’s best if we see different ones.”
