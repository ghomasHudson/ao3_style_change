Victor's cock twitched at the sight of the beautiful, nude creature kneeling before him. The bite on his hip drew a sharp grunt from him, but he smiled down at Loki as he took dark, silken strands of hair into his rough hand. The touch was oddly gentle for a moment before he tangled his hand more tightly in the god's hair and jerked his face a little closer to Victor's slowly hardening cock. "Is now," he returned, smirking with his usual cocky bravado. It was easy to let himself forget he was planning to fuck a man... creature... that could probably wish him out of existence if he decided to. Then again, Victor never had been adept at considering what might actually kill him.
Hawkeye gave his bow a shake, deploying it and scanning in the direction Logan had pointed tensely. "So, what? You're part bloodhound?"
Loki made no effort to hold back. He let Stark guide things, let him take charge, but didn't stop moving or clutching his muscles around Tony's cock to milk every last shudder of pleasure he could from the mortal. Even if the man got back to his lover, Loki wanted to be sure that the encounter was one that would remain embedded in his mind. Finally he guided one of Stark's hands to his cock and rocked back harder into his each thrust. It felt like it took no time at all before he came hard over the mortal's chest, though the burning of his thigh muscles suggested otherwise. "Your turn." Loki held fast to Stark and managed to flip their positions with surprising grace, leaving Tony on top. "Give me everything you have."
Clint smirked at Darien's flustered response. Coulson had a way of turning up whenever it was most awkward. It was one of the Agent's charms. "Darien's pretty good at the whole coffee thing. I think I'll try him at making sandwiches next." He made a show of looking at Darien's feet. "Might have to get rid of those shoes, first, though."
Steve's jaw clenched at the words, but he couldn't disagree. It felt personal. Someone using Bucky like this, hurting Tony, it felt very, very personal. "So what do we do?"
Steve cleared his throat pointedly and tried not to look too pleased when Tony froze like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar. "The charge nurse said I can take over this afternoon… but not if you keep doing that. Keep that up and she's going to knock you out until your stitches heal. She already cleared it with Fury."
Tony shifted his hips a little against Steve's as the blonde worked his fly open. He cupped Steve's face once more, pulling him into a kiss as his hands wandered lower, gliding down over the man's slender shoulders and arms to rest on his hips. "Good thing I have you to help me with that," he murmured against Steve's lips, his own fingers teasing their way around Steve's waistband, thumbs flicking at the top of the blonde's fly without actually making an effort to unfasten it.
"So will you," Scott countered, kissing his lover again with a smile. This time he felt it. Maybe it was the proud warrior woman leading the mission or the obvious bloodlust in the air, but he didn't think anyone would be getting out of the battle on the other side without a prompt surrender. "You've got an appointment to keep." Scott winked and stepped back to silently release Logan to head out.
Clint started to reflexively deny that he didn't worry about what Nat wanted, then remembered that Phil had spent an inordinate amount of time as a fly on the wall in the inner reaches of his personal life. He thought about it for a second, then smiled faintly. "There may have been, uh... certain situations where I do everything she says, but not when it comes to who I spend time with," he said. He chuckled a little, mischief flickering across his face. "I guess she probably doesn't have that emotion. And if I didn't want to be here, I'd have left," he said, pulling Phil's hand to his lips and then lightly nibbling at the knuckles.
"I do," Victor purred, shivering pleasantly as Loki's nails dragged across his skin, "and I'm alright with that." The hand hooked in Loki's waistband curled over his lean hip, pulling him close so that the feral mutant could grind against him. Deciding to test his luck - and discover any possible limits - Victor lightly nipped the god's throat once more before placing a rough bite on the place where neck and shoulder met.
"I can make sandwiches. And toast. Bacon and eggs," Clint said in his own half-hearted defense. "But you should know that if you feed me, you'll never get rid of me. I'm like a stray cat." He settled at the island bar, watching Clint work for a few moments before offering, "I could help, if you like. Cut veggies or something. I mean, it can't be that different from precisely eviscerating someone, right?" he asked, tone and expression leaving it unclear how serious he was.
"You'd be amazed at the things Agent Coulson can find on the internet," Steve pointed out as he held the door for Logan to climb in. He knew exactly what Logan meant about Tony and the Hulk. He had frankly expected the worst himself, but thankfully Bruce had turned out to be almost as zen as Tony was manic. Together they created an odd sort of harmony. He gave the cabbie the name of the hotel and breathed a sigh of relief when no further interaction was necessary. Sober, Tony could have translated fluently. Drunk, Steve was worried they'd end up getting dropped off at a brothel instead of their hotel. Thankfully when they pulled up, the gleaming exterior was blessedly familiar. The luxury of the place was almost embarrassing, and Steve shrugged as he held the door open for Tony to make sure the playboy didn't end up on his ass instead of his feet. "Like I said, we have plenty of room."
Clint propped his elbow on the back of the couch and his face on his hand as he smiled a little sheepishly. "I... never thought about it at all, really. I mean, we've always been close, but..." He blushed a little. "You... we... mostly have Nat to thank, I guess. Or hate, if I turn out to be a terrible ass," he amended with a grin. "She pushed me toward you. A little because..." He stopped. It seemed like something he shouldn't say, but it was the elephant in the room, and ignoring it wasn't going to help. "I think she feels bad that I'm so hooked on her, and..." He sagged back against the couch, looking suddenly nervous as he pulled his arms in close to himself, his hands on his thighs. "Well, I guess she felt guilty, wanted to make it up. Don't get me wrong; I'm glad she did. Just... sorry. I shouldn't... I shouldn't talk about it. Sorry."
Logan actually look halfway impressed. "And people think metal claws coming outta your hands is weird."
Fitz looked contemplative at that and finally nodded. "Yeah, might have a point. Woe be unto him who angers the man who controls the wifi."
Besides, there was work to do. Putting on the suit felt bizarre. It wasn't just that it didn't quite fit - he wasn't sure if Tony just hadn't ever had the chance to get his new dimensions or if he'd been hopeful that they'd be changing again - it was that he felt wrong wearing it at all. Tony was the one who wore the suit. It didn't matter that the colors were his own or that he'd seen Rhodey in the War Machine armor once or twice. That was different. Steve had no idea how, but it was different.
Tony opened his mouth to tell Steve he'd figure out a way to kill him if the man stopped, but the sight and sensation of Steve slowly swallowing him stopped everything. Instead, a shaky moan was all that escaped, and Tony's hands balled into fists in the comforter. "Steve...." he groaned, closing his eyes and arching his head back as he tried to calm himself. He had to take a few deep breaths to focus. //Don't want this over too soon.// He finally opened his eyes again, looking down to watch Steve's full lips slide over his shaft.
Logan grunted and nodded, digging another pair of beers out of the fridge and giving one to Scott. "Drink faster. You're gonna need it if you're gonna go down that road," he pointed out with a faint smirk. He sighed lightly, mulling Scott's words over. "Well, I feel like SHIELD's a pretty big picture, and there's a curtain over all but a little corner of it, but they do have beer. And at least you know me. Better the asshole you know, right?" he asked, clapping Scott roughly on the shoulder. He couldn't help but notice how solid the man felt under that t-shirt. //Guy's in better shape than I-- WOAH. Woah. Nope. No. He's in rebound mode times two, and you're an asshole. This is not the road we're going down.//
Loki let his head fall back at the sensation. The hint of pain was slight, but enough to make his heart pound faster. Normally he might have insisted on more, but there was something rather lovely about the languid pace they'd set so far. He hated to muddy the waters when he could get a fast, hard, dirty fuck just as well from Creed with no manipulation needed. Better to let the night be something different. "It is pleasant to know that your mouth is good for more than just talking." When Loki looked back down at the man, his usually chilly blue eyes were a darker shade of midnight blue. "We'll have to test that further later."
Bruce cleared his throat. "You may or may not have also dragged in someone who broke Manhattan. And Stark used to make a living off of war. Really, Thor and Steve are about the only two who might have a clean past to stand on. And I don't know that much about Thor," he pointed out with a faint smile. "All things considered, he sort of fits into this collection of misfit toys."
"They've got him on life support," Coulson admitted quietly. "The weapon seems to have affected the serum... they didn't give us many details. They're trying to get him stable so that he can have visitors."
By the time he felt truly warm, the medics had already given him leave to get out of the infirmary. Steve was up at once and dressing as quickly as possible. He couldn't just lay there while Tony was somewhere undergoing god only knew what kind of torture.
"Mmm, the war is rather riveting," Jemma answered in a dry tone before bursting into a smile. "Honestly, I don't think I'll ever really get used to that. I'm not even part of it, and it... well, it's rather jarring. I think I prefer the camaraderie bit." She offered him a shy smile, "That's been rather pleasant." She sipped at her hot chocolate to hide a rising blush. She'd actually been rather popular at the academy, but that didn't change the fact that Jemma inevitably felt uncertain when getting to know anyone knew. In part that came from the comfort of always having Fitz as a counterpart. She didn’t often need anyone else and thus had only had to venture out of her comfort zone when she really wanted to for one reason or another. "I'm glad that you allowed yourself to be persuaded away from... where were you?"
Clint pushed himself up and held onto the side of the bar for a second to stabilize himself. "Yeah, yeah... I should..." He belched quietly, dragged his bow from the bar and started for the hallway. "If you're gonna walk me home, you better get moving," he threw back over his shoulder, though his progress was much more in the side-to-side category and much less forward than he believed it to be. He really didn't expect Phil to walk him back to his room. It wasn't like there was a lot of danger if he passed out in a corner of the building, anyway. Worst case, Fury was the one to find him and yell at him, hangover and all, the next morning.
Coulson smirked at the reference. "That it is." He led the group over. A retinal scan, thumbprint recognition, and a few codes later they were inside. It was marginally warmer, and Coulson shed his coat onto a rack just inside. It was an oddly homey touch in the otherwise sterile building. "Might as well get comfortable. It may take awhile to go through all of this."
In which the team confronts Loki and it goes about as well as you would expect (ie very, very badly).
Scott's eyes fell closed as Logan gripped him. The idea of Logan tying him up and fucking him was a thousand times hotter than it should have been. Or maybe just as hot as it should have been. "Any of those. All of those. I don't remember the question actually, but that's okay. How about you kiss me instead?" Scott didn't wait for an answer, just threw himself into another kiss. Logan honest to god tasted good, and Scott wondered how someone who'd spent time clinically dead could somehow manage to have fresh breath. "More kissing," he mumbled against Logan's lips. "I need my brain to shut up."
Logan had already been released back to SHIELD by the time Victor had gotten word of his capture. It was irritating. A chance to talk to his brother, missed. But something had to be wrong. Logan hadn't sought him out. Even after their encounter at the Statue of Liberty, Logan hadn't seemed a bit interested in finding him, for better or worse. He hadn't seemed any less inclined to want to kill Victor when they'd met. Determined to find out what he could, Victor slipped into the holding block as soon as he'd managed to get away from his debriefers.
"You bet it is, sweetheart," Logan replied, leaning down to nip at her neck as he deftly unfastened her bra with one hand. He gently cupped one firm breast, lightly twisting the nipple between thumb and forefinger. His mouth made it's way up to her ear, licking around the edge of it before lightly tugging on her earlobe. His other hand was sliding down the back of Scott's jeans, groping the man's ass and pulling him closer to both of them. "Though I couldn't personally tell ya if he's as good at eatin' pussy as he is at suckin' cock."
"He's good in a fight, he's strong, and with Summers waiting at the Hub, he's got a reason to go back in one piece. That's a start," Steve allowed before addressing Bruce's main complaint, "and we won't know about the rest until we see him work. The X-Men trusted him with their lives, and from what I read, they weren't disappointed." The way Tony kept fiddling with his new wristbands wasn't lost on Steve, who frowned slightly. He knew it would be like asking water not to be wet to ask Tony to be sure about the things he did before he did them. "It does work, doesn't it?"
"Za Vas!" Natasha clicked her glass against each man's in turn and then smiled at Scott. "For the record - and, Logan, stop me if I'm wrong on this - I don't expect it was a real step down for him. Given that scoop, I take requests. Men? Women?" She smiled at the slightly stunned look on Scott's face and decided to keep the disclosure salacious but not specific. "It's fun showing off sometimes. Not really a threesome. Just fucking with an audience. Luckily Clint has plenty of friends who enjoy watching." Natasha arched an eyebrow in Logan's direction. "How's that?"
"So then we're back to the knife in the neck thing," Darien observed before gesturing for Clint to lead the way. "Let's go." He didn't have any particular fondness for the Agency and less for the way they'd been using him. If he had a shot at better treatment with SHIELD, it seemed worth trying, though Darien's hopes were low given that he was being drawn in with threats of violence. "Is this gonna be one of those creepy things where I'm in the back of a van with a bag over my head? Because unless you're buying me a drink first, I'd rather ride up front."
Steve shuddered at the touch of Tony's fingers. The things the man could do to machines and robots mirrored the things he could do with a man's body pretty accurately. Having that intensity and that focus brought to bear on him never failed to get Steve off. "I want you really badly," he agreed in a husky whisper. Steve glanced over his shoulder and flashed Tony a smile that was far too wicked to belong on any of his old promo posters. "If you're trying to get me to beg, all you have to do is ask nicely."
Clint redoubled his efforts to squirm away from Creed, gritting out a, "No!" between his teeth. "Phil... Phil, don't. Please. Not for me."
"Okay," Clint said, letting himself melt against Phil's form. He tried to keep it out of his head, but there was little to distract him, and the archer finally started to shake with silent sobs, clinging to his handler. After several long minutes, he finally pulled himself together, sniffling quietly. Taking a deep breath, he muttered, "Be right back," thickly and moved to the sink to wash his face off. Feeling vaguely more together if not necessarily better, Clint settled against Coulson, all but adhering himself to the other man once more. "Thank you," he murmured. "For being here. For always being there." Remembering when they'd thought Phil dead, he hesitated. "Well, as much as you could be."
Clint's expression of anger softened at Coulson's confession. He glanced at the hammer again, felt the strange tug. It was with all his might that he put a foot on the artifact and shoved it to the other side of the plane, into a corner under the benches. With the weapon well away from him, he felt like something had let go of him, and he started breathing again. //Didn't realize I was holding my breath,// he thought, then looked back up to Coulson gratefully. "Yeah," he agreed shakily, keeping his voice low. With the hammer well away from him, it was clear just how close he'd gotten to once again losing himself. "You're not the only one who's scared. That thing... I don't think 'evil' begins to cover it."
Logan watched the woman warily, claws already poised for battle. "Yeah. Are you a good alien, or a bad alien?"
"Logan!" Scott jumped up from the couch but refrained from launching himself at the man given that Nick Fury was sitting at the table next to him. "When that weirdo showed up..."
"I can help with that," Steve offered, immediately playful as he slid his hand into Tony's. He felt foolish and juvenile doing it, but the feeling was washed away when he realized how good it was being so easily close to the man. "I like the idea of a real date. I'm sure SHIELD would approve. Image rehab." Steve rolled his eyes to make clear his feeling on that aspect of it, but the idea of going out proudly with Tony on his arm definitely appealed to him. "If the world's going to know we're together, I'd like to know that means more to me than just drunk dancing."
"Hm. Who said it was about you?" Tony countered, a wicked glint in his eye as he continued to trail his fingers along the waistband. He was, frankly, running out of patience himself, and watching Steve worry his lip in anticipation wasn't helping.
Clint opened his mouth to answer, but the nurse interjected, "He's got a couple microfractures in his ribs, so considering the mission you guys weren't on because it's classified, he's in pretty great condition." The man shoved a few painkillers into the archer's hand and said, "Make sure you sleep when you get back to your room." The nurse unceremoniously butterflied a few of the cuts on Clint's face before stalking off to see to other people.
The facts suggested one thing, but Phil had put his life in Clint’s hands enough hands to be willing to take him at his word. "Okay," Phil answered. He felt something tight uncoil inside and actually found himself smiling back. The look of quiet happiness on Clint's face was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen in his life. "In that case, I definitely want you to stay tonight if you want to. We don't have to do anything." He huffed out a laugh and admitted, "I've actually kind of started looking forward to the days when you come and crash on the couch. Waking up and having you here just shuffling around the apartment... I miss it when you're not here. A lot."
Clint gave that a moment's consideration. Then, he agreed, "Me neither." He slugged back the rest of his drink in one go, relishing the slow burn of whiskey down his throat. "Can it be replaced? It would be just like Hydra to attach something that won't come off." Clint saw himself as being realistic about the situation. He very much doubted Bucky Barnes could be saved, one way or another. "I wish I could be more optimistic," he added, setting his empty mug aside. "Right now all I can see is one hell of a liability."
Steve relaxed visibly at the easy summary of everything. "Exactly," he agreed with a sigh. It was a relief to hear that Clint got it almost immediately. "Talking to Logan is nice. He's got a lot of gaps in his memory, but he remembers more of where I came from than anybody else outside a nursing home, and Tony... I guess maybe part of the attraction is how different he is." He shook his head and stared into his coffee for a moment before looking back up at Clint with a hint of a smile. "I don't know where any of it's going, and it's kind of terrifying. Even if this was normal, I... I've never actually dated."
"As you pointed out, I'm not in a position to get what I want," Phil grated out. The guy was getting under his skin. The only power he held in the situation was the ability to not show it, and that faded a little more with every passing second. His nerves were frayed, the adrenaline was wearing off, and no one had come in to tell them that Loki was dead, which meant that Stark probably was. There were a lot of things wrong, and Phil was starting to wonder exactly how many it took before a person would snap. "Are you taking requests now? I'm pretty fond of 'Freebird.'"
Nat's gaze narrowed, but she said nothing. Phil hadn't told anyone a lot about his recovery, and Fury had said even less. "In other words, Fury wasn't bluffing when he said Loki's dangerous."
Scott laughed and nipped at her thigh. "Not likely. But he might be nice enough to share every now and then." He rose and kissed Logan over Natasha's shoulder to share the taste of her with the other man and enjoy the heat of her soft body stretched out between them. His own denim-clad erection ground teasingly against her most sensitive areas and left Scott gasping into Logan's mouth.
"Ships are fueled and pilots are standing by. Stark, Jarvis has it uploaded to the suit. We're prepared to take two teams.” Coulson glanced at Darien, “Have the techs show you the way around comms duty,” before turning his gaze to Steve, “Captain?"
Natasha nodded. "And pissed." She remained close to Clint, lingering and watching him, trying to get a bead on what was going on in his head. Phil wasn't likely to flinch. Clint was, at least around her. Quietly, she asked, "Are you? Well and whole?" Sometimes it was easiest to just ask even if it hurt to know the truth.
"Maybe I can finish up and join you for that last part." A solid workout sounded pretty good. He'd been active, more or less, but that wasn't the same as really working to keep in shape. He missed the challenge and the thrill of pushing himself as hard as humanly possible to get to the edge. "I bet you'd make a pretty good trainer," Scott observed as he threw on his clothes from the night before for the walk back to his own apartment. "I'll text you when I get everything settled." He grabbed Logan's shirt and kissed him soundly. "And I'll miss you in the meantime."
"Unfortunately the court of public opinion remains in session," Coulson observed from the door with a rueful smile. "You're going to have to talk about this and soon." He held out an iPad with several of the more lurid headlines about the incident highlighted.
Logan quirked an amused eyebrow momentarily as Scott stopped at the wall. He wasn't about to complain, though, as Scott halfway mounted him and moaned in a way that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He tangled his hand in Scott's hair and crushed their lips together, his other hand sliding up under Scott's shirt and roaming hungrily over the man's torso. "Not the bed. Close enough," he murmured, voice thick with arousal.
Scott swallowed hard, fingers clutching tight around the glasses for a moment. They'd been torn from his face during the fight. He'd spent a solid week completely blind with his eyes bound roughly whether he was awake or asleep. He shuddered at the memory. "Thanks." He set the glasses down on the nightstand and sighed as he sat gingerly down on the bed. It didn't disappear, and he chose to trust the reality of the moment and lie down. Scott stretched out on his stomach to avoid aggravating his back further. At the last second of consciousness, Scott's eyes fluttered open. "Who sent you? You wouldn't come for me... not for the Professor... who?"
Tony had to bite both lips to keep from laughing out loud; probably a bad idea with abdominal stitches. "C-can't imagine why," he said, though the huge grin on his face said the exact opposite. "I think you got off lucky. I mean, only getting two weeks of teasing. Then again, he might've been afraid you'd actually punch him."
"You wanna talk 'not fair'?" Bruce countered, and nobody would've missed the flash of green in the man's eyes. "How about being stuck wondering when you're going to turn into a walking man-made disaster next?"
"I just woke up," Logan pointed out, pulling Scott close to him. He tugged the man over to the couch, dragging him close and holding him tight, his hands sliding up the back of Scott's shirt to make sure he contacted skin. Stark getting killed was making it hard to want to do anything but take every moment he could get with his lover and hold onto it for dear life. "I think I need... we need to do a lot o' touchin' right now." He didn't care if it was chaste or sensual; Logan just wanted his hands on Scott and vice versa.
Logan stretched and nodded, his neck and back popping in a few places. He followed Scott into the bathroom, giving the other man's ass a slap and enjoying the view on offer when Scott bent to adjust the water. "You look good when you cum," he remarked, leaning against the wall and grinning shamelessly.
Scott smiled and then glanced over to Fury, who was on his own way out of the room. He had no idea how Fury might react since he had no idea what Fury thought about much of anything. He'd more or less hired himself onto the team.
"Not in so many words, but yeah," Clint said, double-checking his weapons for want of something to do.
"That's why I'm in sleep pants, not my suit," Phil agreed. He'd make an appearance in the office at some point, but he wasn't in a hurry. In the meantime, he was categorically opposed to the idea of being overdressed in his own home. "Want breakfast?" Cooking for Clint wasn't all that unusual, but cooking for him after they spent the night curled up in each other's arms was a whole other thing. "I could make omelettes, maybe some bacon?"
Steve stared at her in shock for a moment before nodding. “I will.” He opened the door softly as if afraid even that might disturb the man. Ducking his head in, Steve called, “Tony?” It hit him like a punch to the gut to see him in a hospital bed once again. It hurt to see him in pain, to see him vulnerable, and not to know whether it was okay to rush over and hug him or not. With no idea what to say Steve finally settled on, “How are you feeling?”
"No you haven't," Coulson answered calmly. He felt anything but. Coming so close to Barton being lost to something from Asgard again filled him with the closest thing he'd felt to panic in a long while. "Limited contact with this thing. We get it inside and we get it to the science team. Dr. Banner, you're welcome to accompany it down... but don't touch it. No skin on skin if we can help it from anyone."
Tony froze, apple halfway to his mouth as he looked at the god with definite confusion. Was he hallucinating? Had Loki just referred to a mortal as 'good company'? He looked at the fruit in his hand suspiciously and then put it aside. He thought for a moment, wondering just how to respond. While 'first impulse' was usually his style, the situation seemed way too delicate for something like that. Finally, he decided making sure he wasn't just delirious was a good start. "So, is that my cue to leave, or is that you giving me the closest thing to a compliment I'll ever get from you?" he asked, his tone carefully neutral.
In fact, Tony had almost backed out several times. Every time he tried to convince himself having dinner with Steve was a bad idea, he reminded himself of how open and caring the other man had been. Tony could not disappoint him. So, he showered and cleaned himself up for what felt like the first time in ages. Looking a little more like a billionaire playboy and less like a vagrant hobo, Tony dressed and slipped on one of his favorite rock and roll T-shirts before stepping out. It did not take him long to make his way to Steve's apartment. Tony wished the journey had given him enough time to dismiss an uncharacteristic bout of nerves. He stood in front of Steve's door for a good five minutes, breathing and gathering his composure. Finally he reached out and knocked, clearing his throat at the same time. "I hope dinner's ready," Tony called out, "because there's a drop dead handsome man waiting to eat."
It took half a second to figure out how to arm the weapon, but that thankfully wasn't quite enough for Creed to recover himself. What looked like a ball of dark energy slammed flat into the feral mutant's chest. The recoil alone was enough to make Coulson stagger back.
Clint actually managed a few good laughs at the whole stupid movie. It felt good to just enjoy something so goofy. He even forgot about maintaining proper 'guy space' and sat up properly in his chair. Oblivious to the effect it might have, he sat back in his seat, shoulder-to-shoulder with Phil as the movie wound down. As the lights came up, he grinned at his companion. "Man, I needed that. You notice that one guy that looked like Stark's younger brother? Weird."
He feigned a look of offense and held Clint a little tighter. "I beg to differ. I'm fairly sure that taking the two of you on as assets were the craziest things I ever did. It kind of worked out."
"So, if I hang the briefing on the breakroom fridge, he'll leave me alone?" Logan deadpanned, then quirked a faint smile. "Okay, maybe I'll just tenderize 'im some, then." He sighed. "Y'know, as much as I hate shoppin', I'm gonna need more clothes. Unless you people got some layin' around. And a beer and a steak wouldn't hurt my feelin's, either." He wondered a little at what exactly Steve thought of Tony. Instincts and base emotions and impulses were the things Logan understood best, and it wasn't hard to read the blonde's body language even if Steve himself might not have been entirely aware of how he was acting.
"Agent Coulson." Despite the cool tone, there was a faint uptick at the corners of the woman's mouth that showed she actually was happy to see them. "I'll have you boys tucked in by bedtime."
Clint's first reaction was surprise. "You... would?" he asked, pausing to let Phil catch up the two steps between them and taking the man's hand. His next thoughts were to feel touched and then a little scared. Phil getting a permanent reminder of the archer embedded into his skin was a surprisingly weighty commitment. On the other hand, it was kind of a sexy idea, and Clint couldn't help but feel a little proud of the idea that he'd trumped the Cap as a theoretical tattoo prospect. And it was just theoretical. For the moment. Probably. Clint allowed himself a broad smile that said that he was mostly letting the idea go straight to his head and carried himself a little taller. "If I wasn't sure I'd have to surgically remove Tony to get his attention, I think I'd go brag to Rogers right about now," he teased, bumping his shoulder against Phil's and grinning faintly.
"Mhm," Tony agreed distractedly. Deciding he'd teased them both enough, he fixed wicked dark eyes on Steve's face and, holding firmly to the base of the man's cock, slowly took the head and part of the shaft into his mouth. He let his eyes slowly drift nearly shut, moaning as the taste of his lover filled his mouth.
Logan tensed. "I didn't want to explain it all to Fury. The bastard asks too many questions," he explained. He moved closer to his lover, running a hand through Scott's damp hair and nuzzling his neck. "You need this. You deserve to have something good."
Logan quickly dove into the fray after shedding his jeans, pressing himself against Steve's back. He slid a hand over one powerful thigh before his hand roamed upwards, fingers tracing the outline of Steve's cock as his breath puffed against the man's ear.
"During? There's gonna be a podium, right?" Tony asked with a grin, then pouted when he got "the look" that only Steve could give. "Fine. After. It would've been epic, though."
"You say the sweetest things," Scott chuckled as he slid off of Logan's lap and onto the floor. His lover was hard as a rock, the tip of his cock leaking and leaving a dark patch against his boxers. Slowly Scott eased them off and left Logan's whole body bare to his gaze. He enjoyed the view unreservedly until Logan made a needy sound, and he remembered he'd promised to do something specific. Scott smiled and ran his tongue in long, sure licks over the heated flesh. He felt Logan's cock jump against his tongue but waited until he felt the strain in Logan's thighs under his hands before he finally took the head of the man into his mouth.
The uncomfortable truth hung in the air until Coulson spoke a few orders to a waiting agent. The man looked startled but unlocked a cell for them just the same. Phil gave Natasha's hand a final squeeze as she stepped into the cell. "We'll both be here. I'll keep you in the loop as much as we're able to."
"No. But the mutants do, and I promised that I would offer my assistance. I am a man of my word in my own way," Loki answered with the same cool smile as Stark slowly ate. "My brother is properly subdued for the moment. My- his mother is with Magneto for safe keeping. As soon as I return, he abdicates the throne, and it's mine as it should have been from the beginning." But would it be? Would it hold? Thor's friends would revolt if they hadn't already. Loki let that go for the moment. "The wheels are already in motion. There's little that can be done about any of it now."
Natasha shoved the door open and was taking Logan's pulse a beat later. "You can take the blindfold off." She knew it was a risk, but she suspected it would be fine. If it wasn't, there would be property damage to deal with. As it was, they'd all be knee deep in meetings and paperwork for a month no matter what happened with Steve. After a long, tense moment, Logan's heart began to pump again. She muttered under her breath in Russian and rose in time to see Fitz-Simmons appearing in the door.
Darien tossed his head back and groaned. "Yeah. It could. Especially if a wicked, evil guy was to take me back to his room." He smirked, looking back at Clint. "Meeting done?" It definitely felt like Clint wanted some playtime, but he hated to assume anything. Darien knew with his luck that Clint might just be winding him up to let him down. The guy definitely had enough of a cruel streak to manage it.
Tony smiled faintly. He knew that kind of determination, and he was starting to feel a modicum of respect for Simmons. He wasn't one hundred percent sure that they'd succeed, but he was starting to feel better about their chances. Digging into his work, he started running through the information Fury had released on the Hydra weapons, praying that the man had given them everything he had.
"I'm always brilliant. Even asleep," Tony countered, though he was already standing and offering a hand to Steve to tow them both to the bathroom. "Besides, I've stayed up for days straight to get things done. Pretty sure we could totally have sex all night and I'd be fine in the morning. And you can sleep in the corner in the lab. There's a cot and everything. Bruce has thrown me on it a few times." He paused. "That didn't sound right. I meant I passed out and he put me there. While I was asleep. And nothing else happened." The billionaire smirked. "I'm going to to stop digging now."
Though he wasn't sure that it was a fair comparison, Phil still took the compliment with a grateful smile. "I hope so. As long as you think so..." Beauty was in the eye of the beholder, and if Clint was happy with the view he was getting, that was what mattered. Phil had never been under any illusions that he'd seduce every person he met, and he'd never particularly wanted to try. Being good enough for Clint would be more than enough for him. His cell buzzed, and Phil genuinely considered ignoring it for a few long minutes before he reluctantly fished the thing out. The news sobered him slightly, but he was glad there was no addendum to come in. "Boss man thinks our out of town friend might show up soon." It was easy to convey information casually with someone who knew him - and the situation - so well. "No need to start shift early, though."
Simmons scoffed, "Of course, I'm sure he did, but that... well, it's still something. Maybe he really does need help. Loki, I mean, not Mr. Stark. Maybe he really does need a place to stay." She looked from one man to the other. "It isn't as if we turned Logan away, and his past is certainly, er, colorful."
Clint shivered at the sounds, curled up with his face resting on his arms as his stomach rolled. He wished desperately he could clap his hands over his ears. Hearing Phil whimper in pain while Victor whispered filthy things and moaned was enough to make Clint want to scream. Rage and desperation swirled in him, and he squeezed in tighter around himself as he tried to shut out reality.
"I'm guessing you're not here to give out hugs," Bruce observed, eyeing Loki before giving Jemma a conspiratorial smile.
"About exactly as long as you really need it, and we both know that won't keep me here." Steve wanted to take Loki down for everything the alleged god had done, but he wanted just as badly to remain by Tony's side every step of his recovery. "Doesn't mean we can't make good use of the time we get. If we do this right, you might end up with some fond memories of these injuries."
Slowly Scott nodded and let his gaze stray to Logan instead. "I guess it's kind of like asking someone what they're in for in prison, huh?"
“Probably not,” Steve admitted with a hint of a smile as he settled the pillow back on the bed, “but the tower doesn’t have a gift shop. At least not one I’ve found. Big as this place is... well, let’s just say I might’ve missed it.” Even as a work in progress - only about half of the rooms and other facilities were fully finished - the place was a maze. At times it made Steve miss the tiny, poorly lit apartment he’d occupied in Brooklyn. “Besides, I bring candy and flowers, people are going to think I’m asking you out, not helping you heal.”
"You can't see yourself." Natasha didn't say anything more, though the man's pallor terrified her. They couldn't afford to lose Steve. The team needed him on a lot of levels. "You need to rest."
"So it's just weapons storage in here?" Bobby scanned the area around them and found nothing amiss. The only sounds were their footfalls.
“Yeah. Of course.” Steve tried to sound at ease, but he knew he wasn’t managing well by the look on Tony’s face. “I’ll come back as soon as I can - hopefully to visit you in your room instead of here.” Offering what he hoped was a bright smile, Steve made his way out. He was so distracted that he almost bowled over Natasha, who had apparently been lurking nearby. “Oh! Sorry.”
"Normally I don't like getting messy all that much... this happens to be an exception. YOU happen to be an exception." Steve stood, trying to ignore how absolutely gross he felt. "C'mon, I need a trip through the nearest shower before we can properly collapse into bed, get a little rest and then, if the world hasn't fallen down around our ears, do this all over again before somebody notices we haven't done any work in hours."
Logan made a soft sound of arousal into Scott's mouth, pushing up into the kiss, his lips parting to allow Scott's tongue into his mouth. Logan's hand slid down Scott's back, grabbing the man's ass for a moment before running down over his thigh. Logan's fingers hooked under Scott's knee, but instead of tugging Scott more fully onto his lap, he gently held the leg where it was. Logan loved the teasing as much as more direct stimulation, and his hips shifted upwards lightly to make sure Scott knew that much.
"Do it, Tony," he panted. Steve had often found his image laughable. There were worlds of difference between being a good person and being a blushing virgin. Granted, Tony could still make him blush, but Tony was damn near a professional at it. Which didn't mean Steve couldn't give as good as he got. "You can do whatever you want to me. I'm all yours, baby."
Tony looked up, face still ridden with guilt. "Don't say that. We're going to get you back to..." He stopped himself before he said it: normal. Tony didn't care if Steve stayed as he was or went back to being a super soldier, but it wasn't hard to see that the man was frustrated by the limitations of his former self. Tony squeezed Steve's hand. "Look, don't give up just yet, alright? I'm going to find a way to at least get Bruce to talk about this like grown ups who don't break whole cities and see if there's something we can do. Until then, and also after then, I'm going to spoil the hell out if you," he said with a smirk.
Clint gladly took control, though it was to slow Phil down a little. He was already insanely close to cumming after having sucked the other man off and having seen Phil take him down like he was starving. Not wanting it to be over too soon - though realistically he knew it would be - he bit his lower lip and hoped Phil would accept the slower pace as his hand dropped back to his handler's shoulder. As it was, Clint was practically writhing with every move Phil made, his toes curling in his boots as he fought for control. "Not... Not gonna la... last long..." he managed.
Bruce nodded, then focused on his screen again, swallowing around the lump in his throat. "We should let Steve know about this. When he's up to talking again."
The warmth of Steve's touch was welcoming, putting Tony even further at ease. He felt more like himself around the other man. Tony could not help but wonder if his recovery might have gone more smoothly if he'd simply let Steve take care of him. "Well, I'm your official worrier from now on," he announced, making it clear he would hear no argument. "You've worried enough about me, not it's my turn to return the favor."
"Yeah. Guess so," Logan said, though his voice still sounded tense. "If they get the nerve to actually ask a question, instead o' makin' hints at me, maybe we'll talk." Nevermind that Coulson had been pretty direct. Logan stalked over to the fridge and dug out a beer. He glanced back at Scott, looking suddenly more relaxed, more casual. "Somethin' to drink?"
Clint smiled faintly at the kiss, stealing one in return. "Think I might be now," he decided, then wriggled a little closer to Phil before stealing another kiss from the man's lips. "But you're staying behind me this time. I'm not letting any psychotic weirdos take you. Or me. I'm gonna have the hammer, which means I can keep us both safe." He felt strangely confident in the statement, and he wondered if it was his own belief or the alien artifact's influence.
"It would be a dangerous balance to strike," Coulson agreed in the same bland tone. The truth was that he wouldn't have changed Clint's attitude for the world even if the man could drive him up the wall at times. Stakeouts with Barton were an exercise in slow, painful torture, and yet he had often found himself looking forward to their missions together. They both had problems, but they also worked well together. "That's the downside of always wearing a suit. No one notices how nice you look because you always look fantastic."
"No," Coulson answered, "it isn't. It also isn't wise for Clint to be holding that hammer. We're in what could be nicely described as the middle of a shitstorm right now." He rose. "Everyone who doesn't like being roadkill? OUT."
"Oh, nice." He glanced at the man who'd snapped a pic of them with his cell phone. "Is that Rick from People?" The waiter gave Tony an almost apologetic look until Tony waved a dismissive hand. "Just get him a glass of his own wine 'on the house,' and ask him if his wife's still porking the editor from Vanity Faire."
//Eating them blindfolded, too, I bet.// Logan didn't say it. He figured Scott could use fewer rather than more reminders of their time spent in the detention cells. He wanted to drag Scott back into that kiss and stay in the bed, but Barton's lingering scent was doing nothing for his mood. "Yeah. Maybe some wings and beer?" he suggested. He wasn't sure if Scott would be up to going out for something like that, but it was worth a try.
"How about we survive the world nearly ending, and then we build a blanket fort and don't come out of it for a month or two? I can think of a lot of things we could do locked up and surrounded by nothing but pillows and blankets." A few of them weren't even pornographic, but only a few. Phil let a hand slide up to carefully massage the knots out of Clint's neck and shoulders. "Just do me a favor and stay out of the line of fire. I got the impression the out of towner's not really happy with either one of us."
Natasha smirked at the endearment. "I already texted Clint. I'm sure he and Coulson can split a cab."
Clint sobered a little, watching Phil. "I can't imagine," he said quietly. "It was really brave, what you did. I mean... you had to have known that... that you...." //...didn't stand a chance.// Clint didn't voice the words out loud. It seemed condescending. "Wish I could've killed the bastard for you. I wanted to. Believe me. We all did. Even Tony got mad."
With every second that passed, Darien felt like he'd walked in on something he shouldn't be a part of. "I can... go. You two seem like you need to catch up."
When they reached the door, Steve couldn’t quite resist. He shifted his arm out of Tony’s and cupped the man’s cheek. Even with his stomach doing flips, he mustered the courage and pressed a gentle, easy kiss on Tony’s lips. The small gestured left him smiling. “Sweet dreams, Tony.”
"For the record, you never have to make an excuse." More quietly, Coulson added, "You also don't have to sleep on the couch anymore unless you're really that attached to it. I'd kind of rather have you in the bedroom." He caught the double entendre a second too late but didn't backpedal. The truth was he really did mean it in both ways. Crossing around the bar, Coulson grabbed Clint's stool and turned it so that he could step up and stand directly in front of the man. He leaned in and kissed Clint gently. It was nothing like the breathless embraces they'd exchanged earlier. It was soft, sweet, filled with emotion instead of need.
Coulson could feel himself losing the tenuous control he had and tried to calm down before he said something even stupider than cutting Fury off had been. "This isn't just about me anymore. This is-"
"Well, I guess the emotional maturity's not that far off," Clint muttered under his breath, reaching up to scratch his cheek and making an irritated face when he was forced to raise both hands to do so. He wiggled his wrists a little in an effort to make the things more comfortable and a yellow light flashed, the cuffs emitting a high-pitched warning tone. "Uh..."
"Yeah," Natasha agreed, looking down at the pictures for a second and then closing the window. She'd seen the files before, but thinking of seeing Steve in that state face to face was startling. It was like facing off with the Hulk and trying to remember that somewhere in there, he was still Bruce Banner. She liked things to be what they were. Such monumental shifts were difficult to swallow. "Let's go get food and more coffee in the caf. I want to listen to the chatter, see who's heard." See if she needed to punch anyone in the throat to start the day off.
"I tried. I think Coulson might believe me, but..." But he hadn't exactly jumped at Clint's warning, which made the archer wonder how much credibility he had. //I did get brain-jacked by the craziest person to ever visit the planet...// It could just as easily be attributed to Loki's return combined with losing Nat. "I'll tell them." He gently cupped her face in his hand. "And you're fine. And you're gonna get better."
"I'm just worried they might just drop us," Clint responded, but he nodded, quietly rechecking his equipment. "We'll play your way. If half the stories I've heard are true, you and I aren't going to stand much of a chance if they decide we need to be shuffled off this mortal coil. I guess I could leave the toys in the car, huh?" As if to answer his own question, he put the stuff away and pushed the bag under the seat. He was silent for a moment before cutting his eyes at Coulson through his shades. "You think I'm pretty?" he asked teasingly, oblivious to how loaded a question it was.
Scott sighed at a knock on the door. The training was boring enough without losing his train of thought. "Jesus, Logan, I figured it would be at least- Oh, Agent Coulson. Sorry. Please, come in."
"Yeah. It's kind of... well, it's like he left kids. They just happen to be, like, a lab and a building." Scott shook his head and wondered if that made any sense at all. "You're right, though, I don't see SHIELD giving up a place like this unless they have to." He shifted to keep his extremities from falling asleep and ended up settling more or less back into Logan's lap. "I'm gonna try to start some kind of therapy, talk to somebody. I want to go back into the field eventually, I think. Right now, I'll stick around here. No matter how much I think about something else, it's safe to say I'm not going to get out of the superhero business altogether. Apparently I'm not cut out for telling people no."
Phil laughed and gave the man in his arms a gentle squeeze. "Actually, I already knew that too. My office couch has a Clint-shaped dent in it." He whispered the words, not really wanting to break the spell, and then fell silent. He was content to hold onto Clint and enjoy the music and the day. It was comfortable in a perfect, easy kind of way that Phil realized he'd missed. His scattered relationships had rarely allowed the luxury. The only one that had come close was Audrey, but that had fallen by the wayside after his "death," and when she’d moved on, it was easier to let her go than explain. It was easier with Clint, who had security clearance of his own. They could speak freely, and they knew one another's rhythms after years of practice.
"We've brought the power down on the gun," Simmons exchanged a quick glance with Bruce, "but we don't think it's enough for anyone without enhanced abilities to survive use. Not even with what the nanobots can do. It would be a long shot at best."
Coulson's eyebrows raised. "That... is unexpected." And yet somehow it made sense considering it was Natasha they were talking about. If anyone could manage the feat, it was her. As they made their way back into the main room, he couldn't resist venturing, "You don't... I mean, if you wanted to-" He cut himself off. Clint had made it very clear that he wasn't interested in going home with him. He'd wanted to go home with Natasha. "Nevermind. Let's grab a cab."
"The only question is what the hell kind of signature it might leave. Teleportation isn't exactly standard." Phil looked annoyed at their ability to do so little with the lives of their team potentially on the line. "We don't know what Loki wants them for, and I'd rather get them back before we have a chance to find out."
Steve panted in return, thrusting hard into Tony's willing body. "God, you feel amazing," he murmured before nipping at Tony's earlobe. The way the man moved was intoxicating. Steve actually wondered how he'd kept his hands off of Tony for so long. Probably because he kept talking. Even Tony's snarky, often angry attitude had grown on him with time. Steve honestly had trouble remembering what he'd done for fun without Tony Stark. Steve couldn't help but smile fondly at the utterly debauched picture beneath him when he drew back enough to get a good view. "You look even better."
"Begs the question of why you're still so dressed," Steve countered as he grabbed for Tony's shirt and dragged it off over his head. He pressed a hand briefly over the arc reactor. If he could trust one of Tony's stupid gadgets to keep him alive every day all day, Steve knew he had to trust in the man's other plans too. He let himself be soothed by the idea and sealed the silent promise with a kiss. Steve let himself get back into the moment, and slim fingers dove down to unfasten Tony's fly slowly and deliberately.
Bruce agreed, “He should be back to normal soon. Director Fury still thinks it best that he stay under... protection.” The scientist’s dark eyes told Steve that the orders went deeper than protecting Bucky.
Clint looked up at Phil and tilted his head thoughtfully. "Probably not. You're a pretty mysterious guy. I could learn to like that," he teased, grinning. "Phil Coulson, man of mystery. So sexy and dangerous." He smirked. "I am, however, aware of the fact that I'm the only person you'll let on your office couch with boots on. Because Simmons caught me sleeping there one day and acted like you were going to have Nat take me out."
It was a dream come true - a dream he'd fought very hard not to think about or remember in waking hours. It was dangerous to let himself remember. It was dangerous to let himself think about how much he wanted Clint when there was no way.... but there was, apparently. Clint was right there. Phil knew he hadn't drunk enough to be so far gone. He was drunk on something else, on the sight of Clint on his knees looking sexy as hell and licking his cock. Though one of his hands moved to Clint's hair, Phil didn't force anything. He didn't want to rush or risk doing anything to break the spell that kept them there together in that moment.
Not gonna lie - writing this made me cry a little, so... it's sad. That's what I'm saying. But sweet.
Logan knew it would be more suspicious to argue against that request than to quietly allow it. He glanced warily at Scott. If they were thrown off the team, it was no big deal. But Logan had a feeling that a simple ousting wasn't exactly SHIELD's style.
Pepper smiled at the suggestion. "I think that would be a lovely idea. I can have someone help you get your things if you'd like, Steve?"
Coulson stared back and answered in his most neutral tone, "Agent Barton was compromised the last time Loki came to town. Stay away from his staff. He can use it to twist you into knots, and from what I understand, the concussion it takes to break the hold isn't particularly pleasant."
Loki considered that and finally sighed, walking toward the mirror and forcing himself to look head on at his reflection there. "I haven't felt that since I was a child. Since I seem to be in the habit of being rather blunt with you today," Loki continued, "I don't think I've ever felt that last bit. Love is an elusive thing." In his younger years, he had loved his father, his mother, even his brother only to realize they weren't his. The older Thor got, the less they came together, the less often they spoke, the less Thor confided in him. Loki had withdrawn in kind. Thor's friends loathed him before they ever had reason to, mocked him both behind his back and to his face. "Make yourself comfortable... and don't bother with escape attempts. I think you know better."
Steve smiled as Tony's body went boneless against his. The soldier pressed a gentle kiss on Tony's sweat-damp hair and stroked his back. It felt too good to ruin with talking. Even Tony seemed to sense it. They sat in warm, sweet silence with nothing but the sound of their breath and the wind outside to disturb the moment. Steve wondered if he could talk SHIELD - likely with a little extra help from Coulson to put pressure on - into letting them take a little vacation. Getting Tony off in a tropical location with nothing but beaches and margaritas to worry about would be heaven. "Eventually," he admitted as it became harder and harder not to drift off in the backseat of the car, "we're gonna have to move. And dress. And drive."
Creed managed to touch him in ways that were unnervingly gentle, ways that would have been enticing if the situation had been different. Their captor even saw fit to gently tease him open as opposed to the brutal way he'd taken Phil, managing to draw a few involuntary whimpers and gasps from Clint as he fucked him slowly. Clint kept his eyes fixed on the ceiling, not wanting to associate any of it with his lover, hating the idea that Phil even had to be there for the assault. The archer felt overwhelming relief as Creed finally finished with him, leaving with only a few mocking words for Phil.
Clint laughed. Phil had his sense of humor back already, and it did a lot to make the archer feel better, as well. "And the flour...?"
"You heard him, Hairball." Tony was pretty sure Steve could take care of himself, but that didn't stop the billionaire from wanting to make sure the show he was getting didn't get unpleasantly interrupted because Logan was too far out of touch with humanity to not be a dick. The withering glare he got from the mutant was almost enough to make Tony wish he'd just let the two fight it out.
"The same team he was just willing to gut a member of?" Coulson waved it off before Scott could answer. "Barton has that effect on people. So does Stark for that matter. If we thought either one of you was dangerous, you wouldn't be here. Just remember we're on the same side, and keeping too many secrets tends to make things worse, not better."
Fury looked like he was certain he was slowly going sane in an insane world. "I don't remember walking through any funhouse mirrors this morning. Rogers! Please, say something that makes sense."
Clint smiled grimly, the thought a solid bit of reassurance for himself as well. "That'd definitely make me feel better. Especially if I can use him for target practice a few-" The sound of the cell door opening froze Clint's blood in his veins. He tensed, shoving himself to his feet, looking ready to fight as he put himself instinctively between Victor and Phil.
Clint grabbed his bag from the car and slid out of the seat, not bothering to zip his vest back up. "Oh, I will," he said, a little disappointed he hadn't wrenched more of a reaction from Coulson. He walked casually back to his room without a glance back. Stepping through the door, he tossed the bag to one side, looking around. Someone was there. "Darien?"
Phil squeezed the hand so carefully entwined with his own. "Then it was only to my friends. I'd graduated college before I told my mom. She spent a long time being really angry, but not really with me. With the universe, I guess. Eventually she realized that she wasn't going to have grandchildren whether I dated a man or a woman. She kind of gave up, really, but it made life easier for both of us." He gave Clint a quick smile. "Or did you want the more explicit version?"
Bruce smirked and shook his head at the idea of anyone really trying to contain Tony. The man had even managed to give Coulson the slip once, and Bruce had a feeling that was a task not easily accomplished. "Well, maybe you could at least hold him down for a little while if he gets overtaxed," he decided, leaning back in his seat a little. The further they got from the Fridge, the more comfortable he felt. Hopefully, Loki had left once the source of his interest was gone, hadn't harassed any guards or prisoners.
Clint paused mid-swig, beer bottle in the air, as his eyes drifted to Scott. He slowly lowered the bottle, wondering what in hell Scott would want to ask him. The archer couldn't think of anything inappropriate that didn't involve... //Well, he is hot as hell.// It wasn't hard to figure out what Logan saw in the guy. But Clint was also pretty aware that if Logan did get released, the man would probably not appreciate hearing -  //Woah. Could be something way less weird. Calm down.// "I... uh... sure?" he said uncertainly. "No guarantees on an answer, but you can ask." He offered a faint smile.
Bobby turned his gaze to the building and looked it over. It looked for all the world like a standard bunker. "I'm guessing it's bigger on the inside."
Steve stepped in helpfully, suggesting, "Since I'm not much good here except as a bouncer for Tony - and I think Bruce can cover that for me - maybe we could all go get lunch? I doubt you need cuffs to eat." He glanced at Coulson for confirmation and received a nod. "What do you say, Clint?" He hated seeing a member of his team who had actually done a really good thing for them all being put in cuffs for it. Steve leaned down and kissed Tony softly. "Behave," he whispered, "or you get cuffs too."
Clint twitched irritably at the remark. Maybe it was a little true. Still kind of sucked to be reminded.
Simmons blushed at the sudden scrutiny. "I... I wanted to wish you luck. All of you." She'd originally emerged from her room to check on Captain Rogers, but Jarvis had informed her he was busy, so instead she'd followed the scuttlebutt about the street being demolished out front. "Maybe when you get back from all this," Jemma added with a smile for Bruce alone, "you can tell me about it over that coffee."
Phil nodded slowly. "There's something to be said for that, but the people we take orders from are barely alright with the team we have now. Adding Scott and Logan to the team has been... controversial would be a gentle way to put it. I'm not sure even Director Fury could get us cleared to contact Xavier for anything but information sharing."
"You didn't," Tony replied. He could feel the other man's eyes all over him despite Steve trying his damnedest not to make it obvious. "How about the room down the hall from mine?" Padding along the lush carpeted floors, Tony led his house guest toward the spare bedroom. He kept a firm grip on the towel around his waist and briefly contemplated simply dropping it in order to provoke a reaction out of Steve. "There's a gym downstairs next to the lab," he carried on. "I know how much you like to work those muscles."
Scott looked skeptically at the multi-colored tray, but he didn't say no when Natasha put one of the shot glasses into his hand. He shook his head and took the shot, tossing it back. The overly sweet jello removed any burn from the vodka, and he had to allow, "Not bad, actually."
Bruce took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm again. It was hard enough fending Tony off via text message and even tougher to do it in person. "Right," he agreed, settling back in his chair. Breaking everything wasn't going to help anyone.
Bruce, his pulse rate already through the roof, gave Phil a slow nod. The man was right. Letting go, the scientist flung himself toward Loki as his alter ego took hold. He lunged for the god, swatting him with one broad, green palm into the nearest rack of shelving, sending jars and weapons and other oddities flying.
Scott returned the kiss hungrily despite his aching body. "I think," he managed as he finally caught his breath, "you might not be the only one who's compromised." Being into kinky sex was one thing. Being a masochist was another. What Scott felt was a third option that scared him. It made him wonder how much of anything he felt belonged to him and how much was tainted by Loki.
"Which means him being dead would be the only way for Thor to be the one who wields it," Jemma continued with a soft groan. "Well, that... it explains a lot. And makes things more complicated." She winced. "It also explains... well, of course it drains energy. No one but Clint was supposed to touch it, so it punished anyone else who..." She lifted a hand to rub at her forehead before smiling sadly at Bruce. "We didn't have enough data."
