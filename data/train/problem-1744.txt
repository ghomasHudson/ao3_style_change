John should have known it. He only just had himself to blame, really. It had been as plain as day from the start.
“No, he didn’t, don’t worry. How was your case?” John asked, sitting in his chair and facing Sherlock.
“Sherlock! What a pleasure to see you,” the man exclaimed when he arrived in the flat, John not far behind him.
“Exactly. Who needs to sleep? Sleeping is boring. Such a useless use of a bed.”
Thank you everybody who kudos or comments this fic, it warms my heart and just makes me want to write more.
“And I don't get a say?"
I hope you'll enjoy!
“Oh bloody hell, John, fuck!”
“I do not need warming up to deduce.”
“He’s hiding to his wife the fact that he’s a diabetic. I noticed him throwing the sugar pack for his coffee-”
“Hello,” he said with a smile.
Sherlock sighed, only half kidding. “Alright then.”
“It’s alright,” the latter decided after tasting. Angelo served them both a glass before fishing a lighter in his pocket and lighting the candle at the center of the table.
“Why do people always state the obvious?” the detective muttered to himself.
Sherlock followed John up the stairs, stopped two or three times on his way when John turned around and grabbed his collar to kiss him. Not that Sherlock was complaining. The stairs might not be the most ideal place, the detective reflected, but John and him were finally on the same page, and finally all the acting could stop. He could show John what he meant to him, show John how truly formidable he was, show John he was unlike anyone he ever knew. Plus, in the stairs they were at the same height, which wasn’t bad. Although, Sherlock did love how John was smaller than him, his to protect.

“Easy there, mate,” John breathed against his mouth.

“Cheers.
"Oh Sherlock", she answered while shaking her head, a little smile on her lips. "You are going to meet your new flatmate!"
Once he had prepared himself mentally enough to come home, John installed himself on his bed after confronting his sister, a sigh of relief and exhaustion escaping his lips. He closed his eyes for a moment, letting his thoughts pass from one to another when an idea popped into his mind.
And it wasn’t as if John didn’t show that he liked Sherlock. It was so obvious, even Anderson should have been able to see it. With John defending Sherlock to Donovan and making food and calling him attractive without realizing it. And just the way he looked at Sherlock whenever he thought he wasn’t looking. The fact that he made Sherlock actually cook and doing Star Trek marathons with him. Those were all so obvious signs. Even John couldn’t do them without realizing. It made Sherlock want to tear his hair off. How more could he show John he liked him too?
Sherlock just rolled his eyes.
"So be it then. Follow me," he ordered the the blond.
am here,” Sherlock said, walking past him to inspect the crime scene. John looked at the inspector, waiting for a permission anyway. The man just sighed again and nodded.
“It’s just a rabbit, you simply have too much compassion, which hurts you in the end.”
“And texting me the details didn’t occur on your mind?”
“You usually have a fifteen minutes long answer to that.”
“I really need to find you a case,” John murmured to himself, and started to unpack the groceries.

He was sitting in a chair, turning his back on the door and reading a book.
Dear. That was certainly not pleasant to write. The last thing he needed to spend a nice night was to imagine the genitals of a stranger. How irrelevant was it anyway, imagining something on which you have no information.
“Is he too much?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You avoid looking at me and you barely talk. You also seem annoyed because you keep sniffing, that’s something I’ve remarked you do when you are unpleased. Plus you-”
“I’m just a balding cake eating queen who can’t differentiate Chullo from Icelandic wool sheep with a too personal relationship with my umbrella. Don’t answer, John.”
“But when I do a lab, I have to follow all the protocol or it won’t work."
The man bent and carefully captured John’s lips with his. He stilled for a fraction of second before John kissed him back, grabbing his dark locks.
Sherlock suddenly broke their embrace, pulling away and gasping. John was slightly disappointed, but the sight of Sherlock that desperate, slick with sweat with his locks damp on his forehead and his hard, red cock dripping made him forget it.
John thought.
"Just do what you want."
Sherlock stayed motionless until John was out of sight. Then he let his tense muscles relax, feeling his body sink in the cushions. He brought his hands together under his chin and closed his eyes, letting out a long breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Everything was chaotic in his head, informations passing to fast for him to analyse and bumping against each other. He shook it to clear his mind.
"You were Sherlock's assistant for

"If by
Sherlock moved wordlessly back to the table and sat. He looked down the whole time, avoiding John's gaze, and held his hands out on the tabletop to indicate they should resume the position in which they'd begun the séance.
"John," Sherlock breathed when they parted, and then dropped like a stone to sit cross-legged at John's feet. He scrabbled for his notebook and pen where they'd fallen in the sand and began urgently writing.
"But what if I can't?" Henry's palm played over the back of Lyons' neck. "Will, you…you work with dogs."
"Okay…" Lyons scratched his chin for a moment. "How about this, then? You can practice on me first."
"I'm fine. Come to the Jade Villa."
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he pressed a few keys on his phone. He was still flushed at the hollow of his throat and his hair was a complete disaster thanks to John's rather desperate attentions.
"Magnificent, I'd go so far as to say."
"Everyone looks so relaxed," she sighed, looking around approvingly at the other departing guests. "I wish we could stay longer. Oh, there's Ravi!"
Sholto's smile was faint. "I'm visiting an old friend."
"Ah," Sherlock nodded. "So I can."
The plane was arriving, humming across the water. Sherlock could feel its vibration in his chest. John was walking across the lawn to meet him, and Sherlock could feel a different sort of vibration in his chest from the smile John gave him. The morning light brought out the gold in John's hair, so perhaps daytime had been the better choice after all.
"It's been re-purposed for the evening's entertainment."
"No. That's just you."
difference, and he'd be able to call on additional resources when it was necessary. And Lestrade sighed because the sunlight was bringing out auburn threads in Mycroft's dark hair. And because he'd never felt as horrible as when, after some of the best sex he could remember, after one of the most immediate,

Sherlock's smile curled, slow and smug, as he turned and walked away, writing carefully in his notebook. "Interesting."
that sending him to his certain death?"
Radka Wenceslas flicked a disgusted glance at the row of welcoming sarongs as she strode past them toward three more formally-dressed people waiting on the lawn in front of a tiered circular fountain. The David-haired chiaroscuro who had called to her had to be her host. She didn't know who the little palette knife-painted war pony beside him was, or the watercolor woman, but then they hardly mattered. She was here to see Sherlock Holmes. She was here for business.
"He's hard to love," Molly said wistfully, "our Sherlock."
Henry took a deep breath and reached out his hand. And froze.
Sherlock scowled. "There may have been a…slight miscalculation regarding the inebriation timetable."
Sherlock turned just a little pink at the tips of his ears, clearly pleased with himself. "Here, then." He pushed the notebook over to John.
"Don't even
"I would introduce you to your new friends, of course, but since we're skipping the pleasantries…" Holmes's smile was sharper this time. He gestured so politely as to seem mocking past the fountain toward a path through the tall palms. "This way, Miss Wenceslas. I'll take you to your forger."
"Which brings us back to the question at hand." John licked his lips and raised his eyebrows, questioning. "What do you want? Or…not want? With…me."
Mycroft smiled fondly, and grabbed the foot bar of the baby vehicle to help Gregory lift it up the stairs, pausing only to readjust the door-knocker to the correct position before closing it.
John turned his head with a grimace and chuckled fondly.
Sherlock whined, shuffling and attempting to extract himself from supporting John’s legs.
“Bet you’re glad I couldn’t see that,” he grinned, impishly. “Hope you didn’t weren’t too hard on yourself.”
“Here, you need tissues!” Greg passed the box over to Mycroft, who began dabbing the gory mess off himself.
He pulled away from himself sharply. “Fuck!” he yelled, as he came all over his own face. His back locked out completely, and he was blinded by his own spunk.
"Excuse me, sirs." The woman in the flowered skirt stepped up to the table, having exchanged her torch lighter for a tray bearing a bottle of champagne and two flutes. In typical island fashion, the tray was decorated with bright flowers. "Compliments of Mr. Holmes."
"You already know
"What?"
"Terrific," John said. "Date Number Two?"
John frowned. Andy Galbraith…in a sense, he reminded John of the all fresh-faced boys pouring into Camp Bastion, impossibly young but so determined to believe in something, determined to fight for it. And he reminded John of those same faces the first time they saw one of their mates blown to red meat. His pain was real.
"Yes. That's the question."
"It's very clear in the rules." John nodded down at his blue card. "One or more."
Mycroft ran his thumb over the back of Lestrade's hand. "It is always beneficial to have more than one set of options available."
"Indeed," Mycroft frowned, "I did not make your task terribly difficult."
"Yes!" Archie yelled.
"No."
Sherlock frowned down at his own suit.
"That confirmation, incidentally, really wasn't necessary." Sherlock smirked. "I was actually already impressed by what you can do."
Torchlight would have been more romantic. It was a pity their guest was arriving in the daytime rather than the evening—
"Er."
Sherlock smiled, smug as could be. "Sometimes unlikely partners are the best matched. It's not a difficult calculation when one knows the correct formula."

"Oh. Er. Have you…never…"

Molly looked around. A boy with big eyes and a tumbled mess of dark curls stood beside her bench, regarding her gravely. "Hello," she said back.
"Yes," Sherlock's grin was wicked and shy at the same time. "I felt it."
"Me?" John's voice came out a bit more high pitched than he'd intended.
"Of course."

"My friend thinks you're a magician," John blurted.
"Tell me. What made you fall in love with me?"
And Sherlock took a step back.
"Pastries."
already, apparently.
Sherlock frowned, looking around the empty, quiet lawn.
"Something to drink, perhaps?"
“Oh.”
“He’s… bloody arrogant,” he said, such a little part of the turmoil that was really going on inside his head.
John's face fell when the realization hit him, something turning upside down in the pit of his stomach. "You really didn't know." It wasn't a question.
“If you want to play, shut up.”
Sherlock suddenly started to fart on a regular basis after that incident.
Still, something was off. John texted Sherlock.
Living with Sherlock was… interesting, that was the best word for it. John had already eaten his toasts in the morning next to a man manipulating intestines, but that was at the hospital and the man wasn’t
And then, completely inappropriate and somehow so right, eyes so full of admiration, John said it.
“What? Yes, of course,” the man answered. Did he really let his stress show that much? He thought he had been doing well.
Yes. Getting out of that depressing hole could only do him good. That Sherlock clearly had enough energy to share, at least, if he had no other qualities.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock answered him from his chair. John walked the few meters until he arrived in front of Sherlock and sat on his lap.
By the way, when it's written in italic it's Sherlock who is texting, and when it is written in bold, it's John.
Then suddenly, the sound of a fart.
The two men moved to the center of the bed, John kneeling and Sherlock imitating his move. The blond placed himself behind Sherlock. The loss of his wonderful hands left the John cold and wanting, but it had come as a relief, too. He was getting hard just with Sherlock looking at him, and he wanted this night to last longer than the previous one.
“True, you spend too much time in the flat. Soon you’ll start melting into your chair.”
Anyway, John was one of the only persons Sherlock could stand talking to without rolling his eyes every two seconds, and if he was being honest with himself, the brunet had to admit that it did him good. He… appreciated John. And not just for his mind. Having someone around the flat was pleasant, too.
The man in the suit just turned his back to them and started typing rapidly. That was the pushed button that finally irritated John. They were supposed to be meeting their new flatmate, dammit, and even Mike’s attempt to make the brunet talked resulted with nothing!
“Glad to know the sex is your last resort.”
“I don’t really care, it’s you who want to watch a movie.”
John continued to scroll down, looking for the part about the working conditions. He really had no idea what a consulting detective would do. It said his job was risky. Now maybe the fear and trauma that came along with the blow caused an elective muteness, which would be an easier case to treat. That would be extremely likely if the man was sensible, John pondered as he searched for 4.5.7. The doctor who referenced him had written that this Sherlock was a delicate case. The poor sod. He probably meant a delicate person. It would make sense. John made a mental note to ask if the patient had been settled to meet a therapist so he could get over his injury and its consequences.
. "Another elegant solution. Brilliant, really."
, Mrs. Turner," John said for what felt like the hundredth time. "And poor little old landlady, my arse."
"Oh! No!" Molly shook her had vigorously. "It was me. I mean. Not. It's just, I work in a morgue, you see, and I think he, er…was interested."
John buried a snort of laughter in his hand and cleared his throat.
They had a little table in a private corner of the island's outdoor bar and cafe, although privacy was hardly required—they were the only people there apart from a few discreet staff. A young woman in a flowered skirt was just starting to light the torches lining the open terrace.
"How am I meant to abduct a sailor who can't stop

Lyons' cheeks were flushed. "What do you want me to do?"

Behind them, a burst of raucous laughter came from the wedding party, who had essentially formed a sort of squashed scrum in the narrow aisle. A hovering flight attendant was looking harried, trying to herd everyone back to their seats for the descent.
"Oh. Right. Er," John flipped to his next card. "Now we'll, er…meet the dates! Date Number One, please introduce yourself."
"That

people."
Sherlock made a sound of exasperation and rolled his eyes. "Mr. Lyons is a dog trainer, John."
Sherlock stood in front of him, pulse racing.
Molly flipped her butter knife over, fiddling. "Well…no, but…I know how busy he is."
The reception was apparently to be an all-night affair, judging by the noise still coming from the main grounds. Curious, and feeling like stretching his legs, John left his murder mystery cracked open on the bungalow porch swing and excused himself to Mrs. Turner, who waved him away with a mellow smile.

"A job."
"Lyons…"
John grabbed his medical bag, put his head down against the storm, and ran.
Sherlock glared at the top of Mrs. Hudson's head and drew himself up, re-asserting his presence. "Welcome to Fantasy Island, Mr. Lyons," he said, just a bit on the loud side.
Lestrade put his hand back on the boy's shoulder and smiled. "We're here on holiday," he said brightly.
"Of course I don't know that. How would I know that?"
"Does he know how you feel?"
?" John marveled. "My God, I need to pick your brain. He…he's so…he's just such…"
"Don't be tedious," Sherlock snapped. "Captain Watson, if you're in charge of this aircraft, you are acquainted with the man who arranged this flight."
you can't do it."
"Of course you've changed." John shrugged. "So have I. Everything has changed. Things are
"Oh," Molly breathed. "Oh, no, I'm so sorry…"
"He tried," Sherlock grinned, looking extraordinarily pleased with himself. "Detective Inspector Lestrade wanted to make an arrest. For a very specific case, the murder of Andrew West. But he didn't have the resources. Nor did he have the funds to pay our usual fee for a fantasy. So we made a trade. He told me who killed Soo-Lin Yao. In exchange I led him to my brother, who is in fact neck-deep in the Andrew West affair, although not, sadly, the murderer. Lestrade thought he was, though, and tried to arrest him, which led them into a long discussion resulting in Lestrade's employment by Mycroft. So he will, in fact, solve the Andrew West murder as well as many other cases. Oh, and they also slept together, and as much as the thought repels me, will continue to do so, which means my brother will no longer need to lounge around this island annoying me whenever he starts to feel lonely but refuses to admit he's feeling lonely. And I very likely will have a new, hug-happy brother-in-law at some point in the near future. Mycroft, no doubt under some sort of residual oxytocin influence, has also made an offer of employment to Molly Hooper, who now has
"Of course I noticed," Sherlock sniffed, brow furrowing.
So he was
"John," Sherlock blinked. His brows drew down and he looked down at his desk. "I do like dogs."
"Hm."
"If I still had the chance of a relationship with John Watson," Sholto said calmly. "And now I know that I do not. The request I made of you has been fulfilled. And for that I thank you, Mr. Holmes. Wondering what might have been can be a terrible thing. It is…good to move forward, is it not?"
All the right things. He was taking care of the island. He was taking care of John.
…and maybe he should just
"Sorry, didn't catch that."
"Don't you have security around this place?"
"I'm trying to quit. But there's…something in the air tonight?"
"And that such a man's passenger would be entitled to certain concessions due to the nature and importance of the work your transport facilitates." Sherlock rose from his seat, holding his palm out expectantly. "Need I carry this line of reasoning to its conclusion for you, Captain?"
"—who refuse to wear their seat belts, turn off their phones, or—most importantly—to treat their flight attendants with even the smallest amount of courtesy."
"So that's what I want to do," Lyons looked down into his half-empty beer glass, a rather adorably shy smile playing around his lips. "Open a big shelter, you know? Take in abandoned dogs, strays and what not and train them, socialize them properly. And we can do classes to teach the new owners how to work with them."
"If you," Captain Watson continued, "are acquainted with the man who arranged this flight, then you are most certainly aware that the person he'd entrust this aircraft to would indeed be, as you put it, in charge. And completely capable of managing any unruly passengers—"
"No," Mycroft sniffed disdainfully at the little yellow plane. "I have my own transportation. I simply came for a quick word with Detective Inspector Lestrade before his journey home."
He couldn't lose John.
one another, how wonderful." He shuddered.
Henry looked down at the hand in his and huffed a breathless laugh. His throat felt hot. His jeans felt tight. He thought he could hear waves crashing on the nearby beach. "Will."
"How am I supposed to know how to host a
"Well!" Holmes clapped his hands together. "Now that's settled I'll have someone show you to your quarters, Miss Wenceslas."
"No, I
"Put on your seat belt."
, Detective Inspector," he said wearily. "Please. Enjoy your day with your son. You played well and you won. You've no retribution to fear from me."
The detective started to explain to John how it was possible to deduce from the angle of the wound from where the arrow had been blown. That leaded to a monologue too fast and with too many parts happening exclusively in Sherlock’s head and not making the way to his mouth for his flatmate to follow, so the latter let Sherlock do his work and tried not to let the smugness he felt inside show on his face. And only partly succeeded. Sherlock had shown to everybody he was John’s and John was his. They were in a relationship. John restrained a giggle. Bugger, he had never felt that ridiculous in years. But he found he quite enjoyed the giddiness.
The two men worked together on undressing themselves, their movements hasty and precipitated, not sensual yet sensual at the same time. It was rough and gentle touches, bites and sweet kisses, and Sherlock didn’t know what to anticipate, how to prepare his mind, and it just felt good, so good, to let his mind be free. Another amazing thing John had brought to his life. They just seemed to keep piling up.
That he so did.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!” he said with a wink before closing the door without another word, Mike waving at him.
“What do you mean? I’m just adding the spice, look, it’s written to do so right there.”
“Oh, about a year now. It's not bad. Charming area, Mrs.Hudson can be useful at times, and there’s enough place on the counters to do my experiments.”
“Mike, can I borrow your phone, there’s no signal on mine,” the stranger said without even looking at them. He was sitting at one of the counters, obviously concentrated on something.
Mrs.Hudson made him a unpleased comment about his behaviour again, and he didn’t listen again, waiting for her to leave the room.
“John?” Mike called, placing himself in the former’s field of view and therefore unfocusing his intense stare. “So? the fat man asked with a smile. “What do you think?”
, it was making his dick twitch. He wanted them to be one, and he thought no one except John Watson could ever be such an amazing being that
Feedback is always appreciated. :)
“Bloody… no. No way.”
“Nah, don’t try to pull that one with me, mate. I found the stash of Star Trek dvds.”
Lost in his daze, too concentrated on his task, the detective only realized he was gradually moving toward John’s cock when his face was inches away from it. To see it from so close, observing every little detail of it, the subtle different shades of skin colour, the light hair, the way John’s cock twitched to the left in excitement, how a bead of semen was running down its length, Sherlock couldn’t resist and cocked his head to lick the precome. The taste didn’t surprise him so much. It was slightly more bitter than his own, but then again John drank more coffee. The detective couldn’t remember when but he had read somewhere that some food influenced the taste of sperm. John gasped loudly, screwing his eyes shot and grabbing Sherlock’s curls in his fingers. The sight of John made Sherlock completely forget about his train of thoughts. He looked up at his boyfriend, admiring his arched neck, loving how he felt he had control of the situation. John liked what he did, that was indisputable. With a smirk, he licked John from base to top. He kissed the head and took it in his mouth, sucking experimentally. John’s reaction was highly positive, moaning and jerking his hips. Sherlock fought a gag reflex, keeping John in his mouth, but his discomfort had been evident.
“I love you.”
John laughed. “Yes, I know, that’s why I want to. I want to eat a real meal, not just pasta.”
“Why on Earth would you do that?”
"That's your only option if you want my help, Mycroft."
“I was just warming you up. Everytime we come here you always start deducting  everybody.”
"I really don’t understand the use of the word ‘mate’ in ‘flatmate’. It implies that we appreciate each other, which might not be the case."
The doctor kissed him back, his strong hands grabbing that firm behind of Sherlock’s. The man groaned in his mouth, the vibration going straight to his cock, and he felt Sherlock starting to rub against his thigh frantically, desperately.
The look of confusion and of slight anger on the red haired man was quite amusing if you asked John.
“Fuck, I’m sorry,” the doctor rasped.
He didn’t have time for this. He had a new flatmate to meet today.
This happened to my friend and I had to Sherlock things up.
“Well look again.”
“You recorded a message for every single one of them?”
“You’ve no idea,” his friend answered.
“That imagery was disgusting.”
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter, and I'm sure I'll have even more fun writing the next one! :)
Not just quizzical, though. A couple of times in the last two weeks, the brunet had noticed John looking at him in a way he couldn’t understand. It was a sort of mix of questioning and longing and amusement and regret and nostalgia? Sherlock had no idea what it meant or where it came from, so he didn’t mention it. He needed to work it out first. He didn’t understand- how could the man have such feelings while staring at him since the first day he moved in? It was illogical. Surely Sherlock was missing something, and it was right in front of him. He hated not knowing!
Sherlock had froze, then slowly walked out of the canoe, smiled shyly and bright with joy, and cradled John’s cheeks in his hands, nuzzling his nose then dropping a kiss on his lips.

I hope you'll enjoy the chapter, feedback is always appreciated!
“You know, with you being upside down, this is possibly the one time you don’t look attractive.”
“John. John…”
“Tea,” Sherlock said, an approximation of a thank you.
“Idiot,” said John with a matching beam, and walked to him. “When did you ever fail an experiment?”
“Anyway, I thought we could stay in today,” the man continued.
He watched, his mouthwatering as Sherlock arched his neck, offering that white column of tempting skin as a gift to John's eyes, and wrapped a hand around his cock, pumping firmly, one, two, three times before his belly was covered in white, long strips and he shuddered, collapsing on top of John as his orgasm weared off, still shaking. John followed him over the edge, murmuring words of praise and swears and nonsense as his climax went on and on and on.
“John,” Sherlock said, staring at him in the eyes with an urgency and a plea even though his voice was calm. The doctor nodded, and Sherlock inversed their position, pushing John’s shirt over his head. Straddling his lap, the detective looked down at John’s naked chest, something hot and reverent burning in his eyes. He passed a hand up and down on it, feeling the sparse blond hair tickle his palm. Experimentally, he stroke his thumb on John’s nipple, and the latter let out a contented sigh. Encouraged by the reaction, he pinched it, and John closed his eyes, arching his neck. Sherlock continued to explore, thrilled to see his flatmate react so positively under his ministrations, to see he could make John like that with his hands and not just his words. He drank the sight of him, drank all those little huffs of pleasure coming out of his mouth.
John stared at him and agreed, realizing that he needed to see Sherlock for that moment, too. He needed that bond between them to be complete, more real and more surreal at the same time.
Feedback is still appreciated. ;)
“And I have come to the conclusion that I have a question to ask you.”
“Then take me,” the detective whispered, voice rough from that amazing blow-job, and sucked on John’s tongue.
They ended up watching two movies instead of one, arguing over which captain was the best over the whole serie, and if the new movies were as good as the classic ones. When the credits started rolling, Sherlock turned to John. He looked more relaxed, posture not perfectly straight, his shoulders less tense, something eased in his features. He should take more time for himself, John thought.
He head off to work, head in the clouds all day. He trusted Sherlock not to be doing anything to hurt their relationship. He just hoped he was safe. Trust Sherlock to lie about getting into great danger so John wouldn’t try to talk him out of it, the doctor reasoned.
Sherlock smiled.
After a minute, Sherlock installed himself fully on top of John, his forearms resting on each side of his head as he nipped at John’s lips. The doctor moaned in response, his hands fisting Sherlock’s hair. He had always wondered if it was as soft as it looked, had always dreamed about feeling those dark curls between his fingers. Now he could. He kissed Sherlock back fiercely, rediscovering the surface of his palate, the velvety of his tongue. The detective moaned back, his hips jerking a little against John’s thigh. Undeniably, he had felt John’s erection, obvious and uncomfortably compressed in his trousers. Sherlock separated their mouths with a little gasp, looking into John’s eyes, his pupils dilated, eyes dark passionate, asking for a permission. John nodded vigorously, trying to move so his hips would arrived flush with Sherlock’s. He needed to feel Sherlock, needed him to be exactly where John wanted him.
“You find me attractive?”
John shook his head, amused, before grabbing Sherlock’s hair and pulling him down for a light kiss. He could do that now. He was allowed to kiss Sherlock whenever he wanted.
John slowed his pace, gently removing Sherlock’s hurting hand from his mouth and dropped a light kiss on it, then on the man’s lips.
“Of course not, the doorbell is broken. It was either you or the repairer, because if not I would have recognized the person's steps in the stairway. But would it have been the repairer, I would have heard his tool box as he climbed the stairs.” The brunet turned around in his seat, and cast John an enormous fake smile. “How good to see you!”
“I’m feeling like meat.” The doctor took one of Mrs.Hudson’s cooking magazines lying on the coffee table and flipped through the pages before stopping on one. “Look, that seems appetizing,” he indicated to Sherlock, pointing the picture of red peppers stuffed with ground beef. “Can’t be too complicated, it’s a level two of difficulty.”
know how to measure.
“I’m helping him by showing him he is wrong.”
All except that Sherlock he had texted the night before and that Sherlock he had met that morning. Which apparently happened to be the same person.
“But thank you,” John felt he needed to say outloud. He was sure that it hadn’t been easy for his flatmate.
: I’m overweight and in need of love so I make up for it by playing cupid.
“Stop acting like a child! It’s just insulting now. Don’t you think it’s been bloody enough already?!”
Sherlock just nodded, eyelids closing again, turning his head on the cushion. John pressed a soft kiss on his cheek. As gently as he could, the doctor pulled almost completely out before thrusting in again, augmenting the pace progressively. Changing the angles a few times, he finally hit the right spot, and Sherlock’s eyes opened wide as his whole body arched off the bed, as if he had been electrocuted
. When he could be doing other things. That got to mean something, no?
Thanks for reading, feedback is always appreciated!
“Yeah, sorry, go on,” John said with a slight shake of head, regaining his countenance. Shit. That couldn’t happen again.
No, the reason for which he was taking that walk was to get home as late as he could. It’s not that he didn’t love Harry- she was his sister after all, and he couldn’t help but care for her. It’s just that, as a brother and as a doctor, coming home to see her in such a state was heartbreaking. And to see her and feeling like he was starting to watch a mirror as each day passed was unbearable. He really wanted to help, he did. But it was asking for a compassion and energy he couldn’t even find for himself before he could share.
“Why does everybody care about stupid things?” he asked himself out loud, voice muffled by a pillow.
He had to think about this. And this was a sort of thinking he didn’t like.
John didn’t respond.
“Sherlock, what are you saying again?!” a voice accused from behind John.
“You really never learn,” John said ironically. Sherlock made him an unpleased face, all scrunched. The soldier just laughed.
John frowned even more. Yes, Sherlock was a secretive man, but what could he possibly keep secret from John to go to such extremes? He could have just told John he had something and didn’t want to tell him what, or wait for him to go to work. Why lie?
“Yes. It was Mr.Lebowski. The millionaire”, he specified.  “Fairly easy, I resolved a case extremely similar not long ago, the night of the 18th of december. He’s an idiot for thinking he could pull the same trick.”
"Alright."
The next morning he blocked the man’s number on his phone, trying not to have second thoughts on that decision.
"In which way? Two people are meeting and considering moving their belongings into the same space, happens everyday."

This particular ending of one of my fics makes me emotional. I miss John and Sherlock so much, I've actually written ficlets of them before I even finished this chapter.
John could hear the implied question.
“Aren’t you gonna answer it?” the two men asked each other simultaneously. John’s eyebrows raised until they reached his hairline.
“Yeah,” he whispered. “Bet I could do it too, though. Fancy holding my legs?”
fault I’m so appalling!”
“OK, John. I’ll help you suck yourself off, before your daughter brings those two imbeciles back home. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“This is what you get up to when I’m doing childcare, is it?” he chuckled, raising a dark furry eyebrow.
John cried out, mostly in pleasure, as the head of his penis slipped between his lips. He gave a little grunt of victory.
“Ow! Can I stop now?! It’s horrible…” he whimpered, pathetically. “I’m…sorry I goaded John into sucking his own – ow – cock. And I won’t do it myself anymore!”
Sherlock stripped off his towel and stood watching, fascinated to see his lover so eager to humiliate himself.
It was pitiful really, thought the great detective.
John flopped back onto the bed and raised his legs, preparing for another go.
“I believe it was a popular comic strip in the early 20
“Rubbish. Anyway, it does not contradict the fact that you have stiff hip joints and that your anatomical composition makes the requisite angles and contortions nigh on impossible. You will never be able to suck your own cock, John Watson. Live with it.”
“Got a thumping headache, but I'll live.”
“Mind your manners, lad. Right. Bend over where you are, and give yourself a ruddy good hiding. If you stint on it you’ll get it off me anyway, and I won't go easy.”
The intensity of the pleasure in his cock zapped through him at the same time as the intense pain in his back, sending a very confused set of sensations raging down his nervous system. He was having perhaps the best orgasm of his life, and he was in absolute fucking agony.
He shut his mouth at the menacing glares he received from his suddenly humourless lovers.
“The things we do to ourselves for a little thrill,” whispered the elder Holmes, shaking his head in despair. “Autofellatio. I ask you. The trouble is, he is very talented at it...”
“Spnmsf…,” he mumbled eventually.
“Right,” said Greg, looking fondly down at the pair of sexually adventurous miscreants. “Nap time all round while Rosie’s still asleep. Me and Myc can go in your bed, John. We’ve been up since five! I’ll grab you some painkillers and water. No more silly buggers for a while, eh?”
“Don’t move, Lock, I’m nearly there!” squeaked John, exhaling and pressing forwards by miniscule degrees.
Sherlock sulked mightily.
“Need us to ring for an ambulance, love?” Greg asked with concern.
Sherlock groaned at the sight beneath him. His own prick was rampantly hard and leaking fluid upon John, who barely seemed to notice. Which was actually rather insulting.
Sherlock blushed red and bent over, presenting his unblemished bottom cheeks, muttering to himself that he was a fool and an idiot, and that he should just flounce out of here right now and never come back. But he didn’t. He cringed at the sight he must make – grateful that John could only hear this rather than see it – and raised his right hand high over his arse. He bit his lip and let it fall weakly onto his rounded flesh, hoping to make enough noise to convince Greg that he was doing it properly. Predictably, the strategy failed.
Sherlock sighed, cursing himself for being drawn in, but utterly unable to resist the presentation of data. It was shooting fish in a barrel, really.
“I am not going to spank
“It’s rather incredible how motion soothes these tiny people to sleep, isn’t it? Perhaps I ought to commission an adult-sized one, for Lock’s insomniac nights,” he mused. "I could wheel him round the block."
His cock was throbbing heavily. He could feel it pulsing on his tongue. And Mycie’s finger was pressing just
When John had sufficiently calmed down, and when the shock had worn off a bit, Greg helped him roll carefully over onto his stomach, and placed the ice pack where John indicated. The man who was both patient and doctor panted at the effort, trying to suss out how much difficulty he might be in.
“I'm so sorry! And Mycie, bloody hell, you poor sod. Couldn’t stop myself falling!”
“Shit, you’re having a nosebleed, love!” he said, much too loudly.
“Still in bed, lazy bastards,” said Greg. “Go and get ‘em. I’ll put madam in the cot while the going’s good.” He headed for the small utility room they’d decorated up as the baby bedroom, wheeling the buggy carefully to try and sneak the change of environment past the sleeping occupant.
“Please shut up! Can’t you go and have a row in the other room?” he begged.
“Ah!” His tongue made contact with his weeping crown, and he tasted himself, the illicit tang sending a heady shiver right through him.
“Why do you want to do it as well, then?!” whined Sherlock, stamping his foot. “It’s
John gawped at him, as he always did when he witnessed this lascivious amateur burlesque act. Sherlock's lissom form seemed almost evolutionarily adapted for the task. He was the absolute precise dimensions, with the exact flexibility suitable for the task. His biology was simply fitted for the purpose. Nature had been kind. Though nurture had played its vital role. Years of practice and filthy exercises had given Sherlock Holmes the edge when it came to self-pleasure.
!” he declared slowly, pulling himself up to his full height with deliberate and sincere resentment. “That is a ridiculous suggestion with which I shall never comply!”
“Harder than that, my boy. Wouldn’t hurt a gnat, that.”
Sherlock continued his rationale, calculating exactly how fast he’d need to be to reach the door before Watson.
“Graceful, nothing,” he scoffed. “I’ve seen you pissed. Not very graceful when you’re falling down stairs with no pants on, are you?”
Greg caught the left foot. Or rather, his ear did. The heel whacked him squarely at the side of the head and he fell off the bed with a loud 'oomph!'. He lay stunned for a moment, hearing only a distinct ringing sound which he knew was not coming from somewhere in the room. It was like someone had turned his ears from stereo to mono.
He checked himself for injuries, just in case. But no. He was fine. He’d managed to fall back against the headboard and slide safely onto his bottom just as John succumbed to the laws of physics. John was... John was not OK.
“Keep your head forward, Myc,” said John in a voice thick with pain, entirely unable to stop himself being a battlefield medic. "Don't choke on it. Apply pressure - pinch the soft bit..."
“Also disappointing. I like to split things with scalpels.”
“God, you’re so tight,” John whispered. He hadn’t had any sex in over three months, and he was torn between his body’s needs and going slowly for Sherlock’s sake, for the sake of making the memory of their first night together incredible.
With a grunt, he got up and walked to the bathroom connected to his bedroom, getting in the shower to clean the evidence of his actions.
The detective looked down at him. John made him a questioning face and then Sherlock advanced a step toward his flatmate.
If John blanched he didn’t let his fear colour his voice.
“Oh my god, listen to this: From user - I kid you not - bigcuckenergy: You’re (spelled y-o-u-r of course) really hot (really spelled with one l) how about a threesome.”
John nods, almost imperceptibly, but doesn’t answer.
Janine helps herself to more tea. “Well, who in this house doesn’t stress-bake?”
“I thought I said not to come back here,” one of the Fey’a says in an oddly accented English.
Thank you? I guess? And don’t slag off my gran’s recipe book.
Sherlock kisses him. It’s an instinctive, knee-jerk reaction, his body overriding his mind with a longing for warm-more-closer-now.
The door opens.
@johnwatsonsblog
John turns around and looks at Sherlock, and there’s something in his body language, something contained and cautious, that tells Sherlock this is more than not being able to sleep.
. Secondly, he had a fucking knife, and you
John nods, and just hopes that, between rehearsals, finishing the set, getting the last of the props together, rigging the lights, tech rehearsals, and breaking in a new lead actor, he won’t have time to think of anything not strictly work-related. Like his ex-boyfriend. Who’s suddenly back in town after six years of radio silence.
“Proper tea!”
“She used to eat her salad first, it was always gone when her entree arrived.”
The last thing he remembers before… this, is the local mafia don’s villa. He went in alone, leaving John in an unmarked surveillance van outside, together with two supposedly trustworthy members of the Serbian Intelligence Service.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock finally gets out around the lump in his throat, and it’s the truest thing he’s said all night.
“Well, millions of school children would disagree with you about that, but I can see you’re very busy so we’ll leave you to it.”
“Listen to me,” Donovan spits out, “I don’t know what delusions you’ve concocted in that brain of yours, but I’ll be damned if I’m letting a sixteen-year-old
John seems to snap back to attention, and Sherlock realises that John was watching him, and he wonders what that means.
And one of the chocolate thingies, you know the ones
Sherlock is last. He puts his sticky toffee pudding on the table. He made a batch of caramel-hazelnut ice cream to go with it, and he hopes the judges will get on to the tasting before too much of it melts.
Greg sighs and runs a hand over his face, his exhaustion showing in his eyes. “I was there six years ago, remember?” he says gently.
Sherlock turns around. It’s far, far too early for John to be here, it’s barely light outside. The tent is dark, empty and cold. John is wearing a striped jumper, jeans and an expression that is somewhere between amused and wary.
“We don’t have the budget for bespoke Armani or any of that shit,” Sally grates out through her teeth. “I can’t believe I have to spell this out for you. I thought you were supposed to be so very clever.”
Might I remind you that you texted me? So I might very well turn this question around. -SH
Silence falls. Sherlock fidgets a little in his seat. He was determined not to be the first to speak, but he just has to know.
Silence falls. John is still staring at the door.
John turns back to Sherlock. “Need help?”
“Guess he’s different on telly too. The way he romanticises our childhood. He ever tell you why we spent so much time hanging around gran’s? Not because I wanted to wash dishes and fry Krapfen after school. We didn’t want to go home, that’s why we hid out at gran’s so much.” Harry gestures with her cigarette as she talks, and Sherlock moves a bit back so she won’t accidentally burn him. “Our dad was a drunk. Bet he never told you that.” There’s something vaguely triumphant about her.
“I want to see it,” Sherlock hears himself say as if from far away. “I need to see it.”
The silence is the worst. It’s accumulated silence, layered. Eight months of nothing. No poetry, no song, no laughter, no inconvenient coughing, no rustling of clothes or sweets, no mobile phones disturbing a dramatic death scene.
His body is warm and near, and John grabs his elbows to have something, anything to hold on to.
The blackberries are going off. Fruit pie it is.
“Fond childhood memories?”
-  it was already far too late.
Mr Chatterjee grabs the whisk and starts beating the eggs like the professional he is, while Sherlock introduces the egg yolks into the milk-flour-vanilla base.
After what seems like hours but is probably only a few minutes, John pulls himself together. He rights himself and looks at Sherlock intently, grabbing his shoulders. “Listen to me. Please. You didn’t fail. You didn’t break your vow. You were ready to take a bullet that belonged to my wife, and she
The nice hotel is a necessity for their cover. Sherlock is supposed to be the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch, and they’re not exactly known for slumming it.
Mr Chatterjee is late, but Sherlock doesn’t mind, because he has to finish the last touches on his pies.
He tunes it. Rosin on the bow.
before in such a personal way. And he
Sherlock grins, glad Mrs Hudson can’t see his face. Two weeks to press night. Good. He likes a challenge, and he likes Mrs Hudson. “What’s the part?”
Sherlock has fallen into one of his silent spells again, sitting in front of the blackboard where he’s pinned all the information they’ve accumulated about the gates. He’s added some equations John doesn’t even pretend to begin to understand.
“What’s this, then?” John asks, reaching for the container with the shrimp noodles and gesturing at the wall behind the couch.
John doesn’t look up, but from the way his hand clenches and his jaw tightens, Sherlock knows John noticed him. He stops three steps away and waits.
John snorts, and Jim grins. It makes John deeply uncomfortable, seeing the unabashed fascination in the eyes of the psychopath as he watches Sherlock.
Sherlock spends half the night writing a detailed report for the local police, with audio files, names and dates. He sets the delivery date on the email for three months from now and ensures that the IP address won’t be traceable.
“Great! Thank you so much, Sherlock, you’re a lifesaver! I’m afraid we can’t pay you nearly as much as you’d be used to by now.”
“Yes,” Sherlock mutters against John’s lips, chasing after the kiss, “yes, yes, never, I promise, just kiss me again.”
Sherlock smiles for the reaction shot and gives Jim an exaggeratedly friendly nod, and Jim smiles back, just as fake.
“Are you going to sell these in your new bakery?”
Sherlock picks it up and holds it out to John, handle first. John hesitates, an unreadable expression on his face, then he takes the cane from Sherlock, but doesn’t lean on it, just holds it in his hands, looking at it like it holds the answers to anything. “You snuck out last night,” he finally says, still addressing the cane.
The three judges talk together quietly for a few minutes, then Sally says, “Technically, and from the sheer nerve of it, Sherlock has to take the prize home today. But I have to say, John’s pie was absolutely delicious, and a few others have done really well today, so Star Baker is still wide open for tomorrow.”
Sherlock grins, feeling slightly punch-drunk after that kiss. “Good. Now you have something to think about every time my mother brings up the fact that Tom Hiddleston is still single and she’s heard he’s bi.”
Sherlock’s sponge is in the oven and he’s crushing strawberries for the whipped cream when the hosts approach his workstation. “So, Sherlock, in your opinion: What’s the most important thing about a good roulade?” Mrs Hudson asks, while Mrs Turner checks out his sponge in the oven.
After about ten minutes, he takes his hands out of Sherlock’s hair and walks over to his chair.
“It was so runny, and I thought it would be so nice to do a white chocolate ganache, and it just wouldn’t set,” she gripes.
Sherlock stomps back into the room, apparently highly incensed at the lack of a corpse. “This is so very tedious,” he mutters. “Nothing ever happens in this godforsaken city.”
They infiltrate the kingpin’s ostentatious mansion.
Janine grins. "Oh no, darling. You pay me."
“I’m sure Billy at least will stay loyal.”
John sighs, and he looks at Sherlock with a wistful sadness that makes Sherlock want to take everything back and just forget this conversation ever happened. “Yes, we agreed.”
“So to summarise: You withheld vital information from the Watch and broke into a dead girl’s flat,” Lestrade says, rubbing his hand over his face. They’re sitting in his office and Lestrade and the Sergeant in charge of the case, Donovan, looking at them with matching frowns of disapproval.
The city’s architecture - what they can see of it in the gathering dust - is a mixture of the oddly familiar, stone and wood houses very much of a style with most English villages, and the strangely exotic, large, lofty spires with no doors, squat, cave-like structures seemingly made of living trees, houses that incorporate all sorts of elements.
Sherlock should have researched this. He picked the cafe carefully, right in the middle between Victor’s place of employment and Baker Street. Neutral, new. He should also have googled how you greet an awkward ex.
“You didn’t make one,” Sherlock answers after a moment. “It happens. Rarely, but it happens. It probably won’t happen again.”
Sherlock takes out his phone and looks at it for too long. Then he takes a deep breath and berates himself for the mixture of elation and fear welling up in him.
It’s mostly to stop himself from asking
John shrugs. “It’s not like you did it on purpose.”
John thinks, looking back at Sherlock, and for a moment their eyes lock and John feels his face heat and his pulse pick up, and at the same time he’s petrified, because he’s not remotely prepared to answer that question.
“Your flat is a pigsty, and your chosen profession is silly.”
Their eyes meet and lock and Sherlock has no idea what to say once more. John doesn’t seem to have any idea, either, so they’re staring at each other in silence for a few seconds.
Sherlock just nods.
They move on with palpable regret, but there’s work to be done, and it needs doing if they ever want to go home again.
"Where do you live?" Sherlock asks before he can stop himself.
Sherlock sighs. “I know. Forget I said anything.”
She pats his cheek. “Good night, dear.”
John won’t want to leave. Sherlock won’t want to stay. They’ll fight, and Sherlock will stay, become bored, blame John, and John will come back to London with him, and will miss this, the hospital and being needed for something other than making sure Sherlock stays moderately sane, and John will blame him. They’ll stay together, because neither can bear anything else, but it won’t be joy and fun and adventure, the sheer delight they always took in each other, it will be with the knowledge that somehow after years of making each other into their best selves,  they’ve somehow made each other less than they were.
“So, Sherlock. That was one stunning looking cake.”
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea and shrugs. “Savoury. I might have ever so slightly overseasoned my pie filling.”
Sherlock bristles at that tone. “I have no idea what you're talking about, but would you kindly show us the way to the village, and we'll just go home now.”
Janine rolls her eyes. “It’s mince pies, Sherlock, you’re not curing cancer.”
John grins in return. “For today.”
On Wednesday, just after he gave away the loaves of bread and the souffles to his homeless network and got some first reactions from them, his phone rings.
“Irene,” Molly hisses, turning bright red. “It’s none of our business.”
It takes every ounce of self-restraint for John not to flinch. “If he’s here he might just do it, but you need to ask him yourself. He’s always liked you,” he notes, sidestepping Mrs Hudson’s implied question.
John turns around and is about to say something, but Sherlock just smirks. “I don’t need luck, Jim. So why don’t you just let it
“But that makes no sense. How can a worse bake be the better cake?” Sherlock asks, mostly because he’s trying to hide his disappointment with making a birthday cake for John he didn’t like.
“Why is he wearing that coat indoors?” one of the other boys asks, incredulous. “It's June.”
The young man nods. “I was, I suppose,” he says quietly, looking down at his hands.
“How slightly?” John asks, lips twitching in suppressed amusement.
“Why not?” Sherlock asks, and it’s difficult to tell from his tone if he’s been serious or not.
To his surprise, Sherlock leads him upstairs and through a long gallery of portraits of what he can only assume are Mr. Musgrave’s ancestors.
Lestrade nods and Irene smiles like the cat that got the cream. “Perfect,” she almost purrs.
“Mary’s fiance,” Sherlock says, and his voice sounds odd, rough and unstable.
“Well, good luck.”
The clearing is lit by strategically placed torches. The iron pillars that used to hold the bronze mirrors are bent out of shape from the explosion three years ago, and the mirrors are gone. A tripod supports what John supposes must be the Fey'a crystal that powers the Gate. It’s the size of a human head and shimmers in the torchlight. The stone is attached to a pendulum that swings back and forth constantly without stopping and without any source of energy, which John is pretty sure is impossible. There's writing on the floor, in the flowing Feyara script, and directly above it, the air shimmers and ripples, like it does on a hot day when the sun shines on concrete. A barely visible energy beam from the crystal seems to disappear into the void created by the shimmering, rippling field of air.
Silence falls. Sherlock glares over at the house they’re supposed to be watching, hoping their suspect will show up soon. He’s sick of this car.
“Good idea, and yes please.”
Silence falls. Sherlock turns back to the microscope and changes slides. The pollen they found on the victim’s clothing might be further proof that she was in her brother’s garden shortly before she died.
The judges don’t especially love the design of John’s cake, but they praise the taste.
And with every information they gained telling them returning home was impossible, Sherlock has lost a little drive, a little energy, a little hope.
The second time John Watson fell in love in a theatre, it was concrete, immediate and terrifying, and it ended with him getting his heart broken.
Serbia is a mistake.
Saturday. Press night.
But then he gets a reminder that the world is still burning, he’s just taking a holiday from watching the flames.
Sherlock looks up from his phone, confused. “What?” Then he realises that John thinks the workstation next to him is occupied, and he quickly says, “No, I….”
He’s done setting up when John walks in, carrying his usual duffle bag. He pauses at the entrance, and the tent falls silent as everybody pauses their work to quite openly watch as John walks over to his workstation next to Sherlock’s.
“Wait!”
“I don’t know,” the Fey’a boy says, shaking his head. He sounds genuinely sorry for them. “The Gates are thousands of years old, and we closed them all when too many humans came. You’re a little bit like ants, you know, you take over everything and you chop down the Forest to build homes and make houses. And you lure the Fey’a away from the Forest as well. None of us will open another Gate, ever again. And even if we wanted to, no Fey’a alive today knows how to do it. So we can’t get you home, John Watson, and even if we could, we wouldn’t.”
“He won.”
John is fast asleep in the darkened bedroom. Sherlock slowly undresses and crawls into bed. He fits his body to John’s and starts kissing his neck. “Time to get up,” he mutters against the shell of John’s ear.
he almost says, and bites down on it. Not necessarily because he thinks Mycroft doesn’t already know this, but because saying it hurts too much.
“Ahem.” The nurse from before clears his throat loudly. “Er, I mean, I don’t mind the show, but this is a hospital, gents, so maybe take it outside?”
You could do better, John. Srsly. Hit me up.
“Fine. Got the message. Well, good luck tomorrow.”
“The scientific principle is the same.”
What? -SH
“But it was my choice, Sherlock. Mine,” John says, and he’s not yelling, but the anger in his voice is very loud nonetheless. “You took away my choices, and you lied to me. For weeks, you lied to me.”
“This isn’t good,” John whispers, walking closer to Sherlock and suppressing the urge to grab Sherlock’s hand.
“Oh, yes, I do, that doesn’t mean I don’t have time to tease you about yours. Especially since yours are easier to solve than mine.”
“I don’t have to, you arrogant sod! You’re no copper, nor no magistrate neither, you’ve got no right to accuse me of anything,” Billy says, and it’s clear from his demeanour that he’s neither afraid of them nor in any way prepared to be cooperative.
Sherlock nods and forces his attention back to his bake.
“Can I get a cup of tea?” Mrs Turner asks.
The other contestants start arriving, and by now he recognises them by their tread. Irene’s clicking heels, Janine stepping over the cables. Moriarty, firm and heavy-booted. Neela’s rubber-soled trainers barely make a sound. Mike, heavy tread in soft brown loafers. John, cane an odd counterpoint to his careful steps.
Lestrade nods. “Just about, yes. May I ask how you know that?”
“You want some coffee?” John asks, gesturing at the kitchen. “I made a fresh pot after lunch, so it should still be somewhat liquid.”
Sherlock is quite beyond speech at this point. He just nods against John, sweaty forehead pressed against his shoulder.
Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. “Sherlock,” John snaps. “Stop. Sit. Eat.”
Roll out the pastry carefully, so carefully, the butter melts so quickly, get it into the form and press it tightly. Thin, but not so thin that the pie won’t keep its form. Fillings in, cut the lattice.
“Anything to add?”
"You've watched Sweeney Todd one too many times."
John breaks his own rule one night.
Sherlock holds out the phone. “Call Mrs Hudson.”
The answer came at 2 am.
He clears his throat. “We spent a lot of time together. We were both young and practically lived at the theatre.”
Would it be better if I said ‘Add however many raisins you would like to eat’? How about ‘a handful’? Or do you want me to specify an exact measurement? 6,55 grams of raisins? 56 raisins? 37 and three quarter raisins?
It takes forever to get the last light cues programmed. The actors are rehearsing in costume for the first time, and a few small things happen, as always. Adriana’s blouse is too tight around the wrist to accommodate the tube for the vomit. The tube chafes her, and they need to readjust. A hundred little things that were clear in the rehearsal room need small adjustments for the larger space, the longer walks.
John winces at her obvious pain. He would like to say something comforting, but there really isn’t anything that will make her feel better. Her friend is dead.
The crew has put a canvas roof over the loos today, and Sherlock ducks under the shelter it provides, checking that nobody is watching them as he steps behind the blue plastic portable toilets. The smell is less than pleasant, but that is of minor consideration.
“Didn’t you?” Sherlock interrupts and John winces, because yes, he did.
“Told me what?”
Jim smiles without humour, and there’s something in his eyes that makes the hair on the back of John’s neck prickle. His eyes have the same razor-scalpel intensity as Sherlock’s, but where having Sherlock’s undivided attention is thrilling, there’s something about Jim’s eyes that triggers an almost animalistic instinct to hide from an apex predator.
“Her killer was caught,” John says before Sherlock can.
They finish their stew with John and Mrs Hudson chatting about some of the boys John played football with, most of whom attend their school.
He’s somewhat surprised to see Harry Watson light up a cigarette with slightly shaking hands, cupping the flame of the lighter with her hands against the wind.
Mycroft is following Sherlock’s gaze towards John and smiles at Sherlock knowingly. “And I suppose that was uppermost on your mind when you took the part.”
“Anything else?”
It’s Friday by the time Sherlock has a perfect creme brulee souffle. He didn’t realise it, but he’s sort of neglected his homeless network over the last few weeks, because he’d just let John taste everything. It’s entirely unscientific, of course, but he now finds that having a multitude of opinions isn’t helping him like it used to. It doesn’t help that his homeless network are amateurs. John is very much not, and getting feedback like, “I dunno, that other thing you did the other day was better” isn’t as helpful as, “More lemon zest.”
Victor finally settles on a friendly nod, and a subdued, “Hello, Sherlock,” and Sherlock sits down, relieved.
His back hurts from the latest beating.
“They have the customary four hours to complete their bake. Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
“Sherlock, what do you think?” Mrs Hudson asks, stepping aside to let Sherlock check his biscuits in the oven.
And now that it’s actually happened, he can either hold on to his anger and his grief, or he can let it go, and finally allow himself to be happy that he has his friend back.
Most of all, he’s scared out of his mind, and for the first time since he left London almost a month ago, he feels lonely, and homesick, and wishes his Mum were here. What if he never sees her again? What if she thinks he’s dead? What about Harry? It will devastate them.
“Back?” John asks like he’s not entirely sure whether Sherlock is sane. “Back where? London? Baker Street? After five years, five fucking years, you come here and I’m just supposed to drop everything and come back to London with you?”
Sherlock huffs an annoyed sigh. “Obviously, because this one is better.”
Sherlock cuts and posts the video, together with an announcement video that he’s going to be on The Great British Bake Off, which starts airing on Monday evening.
me any money, I’m asking you to
His therapist is a nice enough woman, but her failure to crack open John’s British reticence and military hatred of expressing emotion is so complete that most of the time they stare at each other in vaguely hostile silence. She tries to get him to talk about his family, his war experience. He won’t even tell her what he had for breakfast.
“So, are you two sleeping together?” Irene asks, bluntly as ever.
Sherlock steps out of his hiding place and leans in the doorway. John has his back to him, and for a moment, Sherlock is tempted to say something, but somehow he doesn’t want to, just wants to have a quiet moment to himself to unabashedly watch John be good at this.
Sherlock hesitates briefly, thinking,
Inside, a Fey’a woman in her mid-twenties with long brown hair and a kind face greets them and leads them into a room with a clean bed and nothing much else in it. The guards deposit Sherlock there and leave with a nod at the woman, who’s obviously the medic.
Sherlock is fond of Molly, and Lestrade, and he unabashedly loves Mrs Hudson, even though he wouldn’t admit it under torture.
John snorts. “No offence, but this much I sort of guessed.”
“Please,” he breathes, beyond shame, beyond embarrassment. “Just… please.”
John moves back and looks at Sherlock, who’s watching him with an unreadable expression, and John hates the wariness in Sherlock’s entire demeanour, the full expectation of rejection. “You kissed me,” he says, quietly, gently.
Sherlock smiles, trying to appear relieved, when in fact he’s more tense than before, because now it’s down to John or Moriarty, and at least Moran is heavily biased towards Moriarty. Molly hugs him again, and he catches John’s eyes over Moriarty’s head, and John gives him a brilliant smile and a thumbs-up, but he looks about as apprehensive and sad as Sherlock feels.
Sherlock Holmes has always thought that love is stupid. It addles the mind; it warps perception. It makes the banal seem profound and the unremarkable exceptional.
“Leave him alone. People love his YouTube channel. He’ll be gold on the actual show.”
So while John moves from one seat to the next while Mary, Lestrade and Anderson program light cues, he thinks about whether Mary is right. If he knew Sherlock still wants him, would he go back?
He has to admit that she’s clever, though, because two seconds ago, he wasn’t going to come to the party, but John’s presence there will practically guarantee his attendance. “Anyway, did he say that he was coming?”
“But why re-open the Gate in the first place?” John wonders. “What are they doing?”
“Devonshire, near Exeter.”
John rubs a hand over his face and sighs. “Sherlock, you have to stop this. How many times are you going to throw your life away for me?” He looks up, and there’s something in his eyes, something deep and dark and real. “I’m not bloody worth it, Sherlock. I was never bloody worth it.”
Sherlock grins. “Yes.”
John curses under his breath. Sherlock. Of course. Couldn’t wait for backup, had to go in there to play the bloody hero.
“If you think you’re calling anything tonight, you’re insane.” He holds out John’s phone. “Call Mrs Hudson and tell her you’re sick.”
Sherlock bites off a curse and barely restrains himself from flinging the phone at the wall.
Walking is better. Re-acclimating himself to the city he loves is better than sitting in his flat, brooding. He used to do this when he couldn’t sleep as a student, sometimes, when he’d needed to get a difficult part into his head, just let his feet take him through the streets of London, the top layers of his mind thinking of the lines, the lower layers keeping track of where he was. The splitting of his attention cleared his mind of clutter, and afterwards he always had it in his head, whatever the part, however difficult.
“I’m not sick.” John scoffs. “It’s just a little head cold.”
“We argued this point in the past, and I for one am always inclined to favour technical perfection over taste, because you can always add more sugar, but making a good Croqueamanche is on an entirely different level,” Moran adds.
“Let’s not get over-excited, I don’t know what they’ll offer yet,” Sherlock cautions, going back to packing up his equipment, mostly to hide how much his hands are shaking.
John lets his gaze wander over the city. “How many do you think are here by now?”
“Seriously?” John asks, but when Sherlock just gives him a look, he grabs a pair of waxed gloves and a pair of tweezers from the workspace. Slowly, gently, he pries her lips apart. Sherlock hands him a small lamp, and John holds it close to her mouth.
Sherlock grins back and hands John the racket and the ball. “You realise a pumpkin doesn’t have the same qualities as a human body, right?” John asks as he positions himself.
“This is getting uncomfortable,” John says after a while, shifting in his seat. Sherlock can tell from his voice that his shoulder and back are starting to hurt from sitting on the floor in an uncomfortable position.
“Yes. I’ll answer.”
Sometimes it’s making Sherlock eat when he’s about to faint. Sometimes it’s getting him to think twice about something before storming into danger half-cocked. Sometimes it’s flushing cocaine down the loo, or ripping off a fifth nicotine patch, or keeping that tenth cup of coffee out of Sherlock’s reach.
He joins his mother and John mid-conversation and politely waits until his mother is done telling John about her renovation projects and her charity work, all the while trying not to stare at John too obviously, all the while knowing that John is trying not to stare too obviously at him.
He knows it will only go downhill from here. He’s given up hope that she’ll ever stop drinking. Three times in rehab, a loving, supportive wife and all the therapy money can buy, and they always end up here, John alone at her bedside, making sure she won’t choke on her own vomit. It’s always the same circle. And she’s never, ever, grateful, or sorry. She won’t be sorry, or grateful, or anything other than defiant and bloody-minded until the day she dies of liver failure, in some hospital, possibly mentally so far gone she won’t even recognize John.
“Tea?” Sherlock asks, holding the door open.
“Really well done,” Donovan adds, “But just for future reference, same note applies to you as to Jim. Nothing wrong with keeping it simple.”
John can’t help but smile in relief. He’ll take ranting, pissed-off Sherlock over semi-conscious white as a sheet Sherlock any day. “Hooper is an odd name for a Fey’a doctor, don’t you think?” he asks conversationally.
Their food arrives, saving him an answer, and John sighs happily. “Oh thank god, food,” he says, then bites into his burger with relish.
“Because I knew he was going to be unbearably smug about it. He was happier when he won the mini-Bake Off than when he won the actual Bake Off.” John grins at Sherlock, soft and fond. He’s shed his jacket and has rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt, and he’s looking just about good enough to eat. Sherlock has to restrain himself from dragging John off somewhere for a shag; there has to be a secret corner around here somewhere, a good snog at least might get some of the antsy energy out of his system.
The fog intensifies, and as it does, the light around them slowly fades, until it’s so dark they can barely see where they’re going.
John just nods and gently puts the dress back into the closet.  “My sister’s a Land Girl. She went as soon as she was eighteen. Anything to get away from home. She was always restless....” he trails off and shakes his head as if to clear it. He’s had to put these feelings, these memories away, in order to survive.
You two are adorable.
And right now Sherlock feels the active absence acutely, like a tiny hole somewhere in his chest cavity, bleeding silence into his body.
. Three weeks at Musgrave mansion, you only got one single letter. Not a correspondence between a caring parent and a child away on his own for the first time. New man, is it? Disapproving son, still hung up on his dead father's memory, tension, she wants to move on, you won't let her,” Sherlock narrows his eyes at John, rattling off deductions at lightning speed, all his attention zeroed in on John, and for the first time, John doesn't feel it as a tingling, rushing-falling-jumping, but as a punch in the gut. “Nobody's waiting for you, so you'd rather stay here, in this small, insular, tiny little boring place where you've finally found a life you could never have at home. So it's easy for you to be all noble and not bargain with the killer, because nobody
John nods. “Yes. Tomorrow.”
But he never brings other people tea, either. And he never ensures that good-looking, charming ex-army doctors have workstations next to him.
Sherlock takes a step towards Moriarty and lowers his voice, not even trying to conceal his anger. He’d like nothing more than to slam his fist into that smirking visage, but he knows there are other ways to hurt. “Try it and see what happens. Final warning. If you so much as mention his name online, I will erase you from the Internet. I will make you want to change your name and move to another country. You think you know what I can do? Believe me, you have no idea.”
“Must be a client,” Sherlock said flatly, not ungluing his eyes from the rubik’s cube he held in his hands, his fingers moving so rapidly that John almost saw them blurry.
“I have been thinking.”
Still, to stay respectful, the doctor kept facing his patient even when his all of his instincts told him to look away. Their eyes met for long seconds, the blue oculars fixing him with something indescribable in them.
“No, I don’t.”
John whispered, “Soon, soon, patience love,” and leaned down to nuzzle the curve at the bottom of Sherlock’s spine, still working him open with his fingers. He pushed on his prostate irregularly, knowing that if any man liked not knowing what was up and variety in bed, it was Sherlock Holmes. The latter was shaking slightly under him, his breathing a little bit laboured. John added another finger when he felt confident enough, feeling Sherlock’s hand fist in the sheets. They continued like this for another few minutes before Sherlock half snapped half pleaded, “John, I can’t handle this anymore, I need you in me, right now!”
"Alright," John sighed. "Is there anything you want to say to me?"
"No," Sherlock answered slowly, as if he was still trying to determine if it was the right answer. "You?"
“Sshh, it’s okay, just lay back. Lay back and let me take care of you like you took care of me.”
Worried, he sent little text messages to the brunet there and then during his shift, hoping for an answer confirming the man was doing well. Which was not something he was used to do, since Sherlock normally texted him constantly.
Pasta ✓
“So you had plenty of free time.”
“Don’t try, Lestrade, your superiors don’t even know that
John swore and started a new message.
Oh, now John understood why Sherlock bitched so much about them.
“Wow, you’re quick to get to work.”
Sherlock grunted and lied down on the couch in a ball, face in the cushions.
"I don't-"
“As soon as possible."
“With you?” she asked, eyebrows raised. Then she looked at John with worry. “He’s not paying you to do weird stuff, is he?”
“Because when we texted that night, you weren’t well. You were not… like you are everyday.”
Not a bad improvement.
?" Sally asked with a voice filled with horror and stupefaction.
“Doing what?” What happened to make John’s attitude switch like that? It has been a pleasant evening, no?
“It’s not
The detective just seemed more lost. “Well of course you did, you formulated a sentence with an interrogative structure. Do you know you are very incoherent sometimes? It’s extremely exhausting to try and keep up.”
"It better be important, I'm with a client."
“Well, it is not normally to be split in half by a scalpel.”
“That lady with the blue coat has spent a lot of time in front of a screen lately. She keeps rubbing at her eyes but she does not have facial symptoms of tiredness. Only her eyes are tired: too much exposition to a screen. But considering the relaxed state of the muscles of her hands she didn’t used a phone or a keyboard, so she must have been watching the telly. She is also wearing earrings of that phone box in that TV show you like, so the chances are high that she watched it a lot lately. She must be like you, addicted to that non-sense ridiculous story. And that man over there, with the ugly hat-”
The man was apparently very concentrated on his phone.
Instead of answering, the blond pressed his fingers against Sherlock’s prostate, making the man keen and writhe under him. John was a doctor. He knew how to find a fucking prostate.
The first crime scene Sherlock had brought along John to. The moment they became who they were. The beggining of them, the duo, Watson and Holmes. Sherlock and John.
He seemed calm when he learned the news, sitting on the examination table. The only thing that could have betrayed his feelings was the slightest tension on the edge of his mouth, but that, the doctor didn’t notice. You’d need to look with the greatest attention, to know the man like the back of your pocket to realize he was affected. In fact, the doctor was more intimidated by the countenance and the sharp, analyzing gaze his patient was projecting. In twenty-three years of practice, he’d never seen anybody react like that to such a serious diagnostic. He’d seen fake indifference when he had to announce the bad news, but it was always due to dignity or for the sake of a loved one or because of something worse than what the patient had been diagnosticated with. But he had never seen anything like this. He couldn’t point out why the man was so unresponsive, such in control. It seemed he had no reason to, like he was simply emotionless. He seemed to completely understand what was happening to him while not understanding at all.
“And you seriously believe I don’t like what I see?” he asked in a soft voice. Sherlock looked down at him, which was what John wanted him to do. He didn’t answer, so John knew Sherlock knew John liked him. He just didn’t understand why.
But then there was no understanding Sherlock’s reflexions and understanding his trains of thoughts about some things was the last thing John wanted, so he just played along, taking the card with a nod and bidding his flatmate goodbye.
I hope you liked the chapter, feedback is always appreciated! :)
John was sitting at the feet of his bed, not believing what had just happened. If he had a chance of anything working out before, it was over now, no matter what Sherlock said. John just… He had found something. Finally found something that brought something to his life. And he was going to lose it all over again. Just like he lost his job, just like his lost his friends in Afghanistan, just like he lost his sister, just like he lost his boyfriend. And Sherlock, he was so different. Fresh air. Adventure. Funnier. Better. Probably the only thing that could help him heal anymore. Even if nothing ever happened between them. And he lost that.
.... He didn’t understand that John
“But you can’t,” Sherlock argued with a vigor and a determination that surprised his flatmate. How could John not understand? It was the recipe. You had to follow it. “You have to follow the recipe to obtain the best result.”
PS: There's only one chapter left!
John let go of the breath he didn’t know he had been holding, the world seeming fuzzy and his mind too. He gripped the banister, needing to ground himself with all the emotions running through him. He looked down at all the sheets in his hand, then up at the door he knew Sherlock was waiting behind. Resembling his courage, he walked the few steps separating the door and himself, and opened it. On the other side was Sherlock, standing straight in the middle of the room, hands clenched together in front of himself. They didn’t move for a second, eyes meeting, then the most illuminated smile brightened Sherlock’s features.
“Mmm," John answered simply. "I’m hungry", he said after thirty seconds of silence. "Do you want to cook dinner with me? Like try a recipe or something?"
Sherlock started to rub, slowly at first, kissing John deeply as they rolled their hips together. John passed his hands under the detective’s shirt, passing his palms on the hot, slim surface of Sherlock’s back. He felt as if Sherlock were the only thing in the world, trapping him against the bed, his weight pressing against him, the maddening roll of his hips on his, his tongue dancing with his. All he could smell was Sherlock, all he could feel was Sherlock, all he could see was Sherlock and all he could taste was Sherlock, and it was
“I wasn’t asking for an explanation, Sherlock,” John cut him with an exasperated tone.
Their pace started to accelerate as their shaky breathing became panting, the two of them gripping what they could and breathing in each other’s mouth instead of kissing, the jerk of their hips now erratic. John bit hard on Sherlock’s lip as he came, moaning long and loud as he clutched at his flatmate’s back.
“My turn,” he told Sherlock hoarsely. He needed to touch him again. Never, ever stop. Couldn’t stop. John had to make Sherlock feel beautiful.
John knew that Sherlock didn't come to bed to sleep. Sherlock almost never slept (except if it was after a rather intense shagging). He knew that Sherlock only lied down with him to be close to John. And the doctor wasn't about to complain; it was marvelous. The brunet’s body was relaxed against his, all that tension he always carried with him gone. He was snoring slightly (even though the man would deny it forever). His hair was a mess, the dark shade such a contrast with the milky white of the pillow. His features were loose, mouth slightly open. He always pressed his cold nose against John’s neck and his feet against John’s calves (and they were bloody big and freezing!), but the blond was never going to complain about that if it meant he had that amazing man snuggled against him. He loved just how much Sherlock wrapped himself around him like an octopus. How Sherlock craved physical contact, how John wanted nothing more in the world than to provide it. He knew how Sherlock had been lonely before he arrived in his life, and he wanted to make up for that in any ay he could. John nuzzled Sherlock’s hair, inhaling that soft smell that he now always identified with the detective. What was his brand of shampoo again? It smelled marvelous. This man was so amazingly brilliant, beautiful and elegant in every way, and John snuggled a little closer, a soft smile of contentment on his lips.

“Gabriel? You think my name is Gabriel? How can you be wrong again?!”
“If he’s bonkers at least he is definitely not boring, which is better than a lot of sane people.”
“I told you, since I’ve been here I’ve barely give a thought to my sister or Mark or-”
It was the best option he had, really.
The boys talk, then they go on a case.
“It’s always nice to get a little challenge.”
Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this chapter! :) I'll post at least one of the ficlets later this week.
Sherlock hummed impatiently to close the subject, fisting his hand in John’s short hair and pressing their mouths together, pulling with his teeth at John’s lips and stroking the inside of his mouth with torrid, slow but firm strokes of his tongue. The kiss went up and down in intensity like a roller coaster, the two men losing themselves in it when after a few minutes, Sherlock suddenly tore his mouth away with a gasp, feverish eyes looking up at John. He called his name with a little, breathy voice, lips glistening from the kiss. John held his gaze for a second before dropping one last light kiss to his bow of a mouth and sitting on his knees, fumbling for the lube.
“JOHN!”
“Yes, I can. The instructions are just advice, I can change some things to adjust to my taste if I like.”
On his way he passed to his bedroom to get some lube as quickly as he could, hoping no one could see him walking around naked through the windows. When he came back to Sherlock’s room, he had to stop in the doorway to appreciate the picture of that long, lean, albater man displayed in the bed like an offering. His black curls were messy from John’s hands in them, framing his face. Jesus, that face, with those eyes, light but somehow dark and full of promises, with that soft, playful smile on those lips, and John couldn’t help but walk toward him and install himself between the detective’s legs. He looked down at Sherlock’s cock, deep red and leaking, a little pool of precome stagnating on his stomach, and the soldier’s mouth watered. Sherlock kept staring at him the entire time, his hand reaching for John’s.
He felt Sherlock freezing in his arms.
: (Fake girl voice) Hi! It’s me- euh Molly, sorry, you can’t know who ‘me’ is, haha. I wear too big earrings and lipstick to seduce homosexual men and have crushes on psychopaths. I also hang out with dead people, how much does that say on my social skills? Haha awkward laugh say hi to Sherlock for me.
“I feel like watching a movie,” the blond said, stretching.
“I think if you lied on your stomach, it’d be easier to acclimate your body to the sensation.”
"It’ll do yourself good to spend time with someone new, not just dead corpses and the grey hair policeman that always rings late at night. Speaking of that, would you mind getting rid of your skull? It’s a bit unsanitary."
“Lestrade,” the brunet greeted to a grey haired man who was currently talking rather fiercely on his mobile. As soon as he saw Sherlock, he told over the line, a little bit fumbling to find the words, “Eh, I’ve got, eh, backup that just arrived, I’ll call you back.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John cracked his eyes open, adjusting to the morning light when he jumped and let escape a small yelp, covering his chest with the cover.
“Why would you need me to come?”
With Mycroft, a Star Trek marathon and revelations.
Later that night, in his bed, John couldn’t help it. He had try not to, had been successful in doing so in the last two weeks. It was the worst idea, considering their already on edge situation. But with Sherlock smiling at him genuinely with warmth in his eyes, making him laugh, he couldn’t help it. His hair, his long legs, his waist in those too tight for his sake shirts, those cheekbones, the color of those eyes… Since the minute John met the brunet he had been fascinated by his eyes. And now with his intelligence and his sense of humor, and his kindness and humanity he showed earlier that night, it was impossible to resist.
I really loved this story and this John and Sherlock, thanks to everybody who left kudos and commented, your feedback means the world to me. :) xx
“You seem distant tonight,” Sherlock observed after dinner, shooting John a confused glance.
Just as he was getting in the taxi, his felt his phone vibrate, notifying a text. Now, that was probably Mycroft bothering him or Lestrade asking a question about the case. Sherlock gave the direction to 221B to the driver before fishing the electronic device out of his pocket. When the picture he had received opened, the detective's eyes widened for a second.
"Oh Jesus." John head bent, passing his hands on his face as he took a deep inspiration. "I'm sorry for anything I-"
“I am not ashamed.”
Enjoy!
John closed his eyes with frustration. “I- I’m so sorry. I haven’t got any condoms, I- fuck. I’m sorry, I didn’t bring any with me when I moved in.”
This was the first erection he had in eight years. He didn’t even thought he would ever have another one.
“At the end of the hallway.”
I'm not really happy with how this chapter came out, but I hope you'll like it anyway!
There was a silence. John didn’t know what to answer, because even as a doctor, he couldn’t identify what trimethylaminuria could possibly be. After a while Sherlock looked up into John’s eyes for a second and said, “I need to think about this.
“Oh. Thank you.” He seemed a bit surprised. He got up and reached for the device. John made sure to open a new text conversation before the other man could see the messages he had received the night before.
This effectively had been proven an interesting experiment for Sherlock, but not for the reasons he thought it would.
Sherlock heard the footsteps before he saw John walking downstairs. He had seen that his flatmate had read his text, but it took him a good five minutes before he actually came down. The detective looked at him, and they both froze for a second, staring in each other’s eyes before John started moving toward the kitchen. Sherlock shot his friend’s back a quizzical look for his bizarre behaviour.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, so quietly the man wasn’t sure if he imagined it or not.
Sherlock seemed on the edge of retorquing, but apparently he changed his mind and started to talk about the samples he would need and how John will have to help him.
Sherlock frowned ever harder, a light blush coloring his cheeks.
John blanched and blushed at the same time. Thankfully, his computer screen half hid it. Like that would fool Sherlock, but better than nothing.
“Nothing. Usually when that happens I come to you and we have sex, but as I said, you were out.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Fine."
The sky was gray that afternoon. The air was chill. Autumn was returning, and everything in the city would lose its colour. All the plants would die and all the birds would fly away. The buildings were tall and imposing, all heteroclites and yet forming a unique and harmonious whole. Sherlock loved it, he loved London. He loved its heartbeat, the pulse of it, its little secrets and dark lurking streets. He took such a pleasure exploring and analysing all the things people did not see, as much in plain sight than in the abandoned alleys. And yet, all John could see standing on that rooftop was the impersonality of the city, its organized structure, neat and predictable and boring. John was watching it from up there, and he was above it all.
“Alright. Are you allowed here?” he asked, turning to the doctor. “You need an authorization from my superiors.”
“He’s with me,” Sherlock intervened.
Curious, and a bit confused because that didn’t sound like Sherlock at all (Sherlock talking about romance?), John looked around. That’s when he noticed another note higher in the stair case. And another. And another, all leading to the room where the crime scene had been.
John was continuing his errand at Tesco, struggling to make everything fit in the basket he was holding and wondering why he hadn’t taken one with wheels. Actually, he was wondering why three years into living with Sherlock, he hadn’t gotten the man to get the groceries just
The the two men stayed silent for an uncomfortable while until the doctor finally started his usual speech so he could regain some composure.
John arched an eyebrow, starting to forget the fact that they were currently having a conversation in his bed, while he was clad in nothing but pants.
, John hadn’t had sex in over three months, and Sherlock was so hot and so tight and so soft and he needed to thrust, it was slightly overwhelming. But instead, he brought Sherlock’s leg around his waist, rubbing his thigh to offer him some comfort.
As the page appeared on the screen, John read the words he had typed what seemed a lifetime ago, which it kind of was. Another life that seemed fuzzy when he tried to remember it, as if nothing were clear, as if nothing made sense then. Everything was so different back then. He couldn’t help but smile while thinking about just how much had changed, step by step, until his life became the wonder it was today.
“I’m still not entirely successful at associating the two of you,” Sherlock said out of the blue a few minutes after.
That is why John was losing his time on the computer, looking for buying new jumpers, writing on his blog and watching a stupid video Mike send to him and things of the sort.
“Sherlock, I felt the vibrations.”
“I don’t just sit around and do nothing. I write my blog and I do all the groceries and I’m looking for a job.”
“I never heard you not to.”
John froze again in shock, opening his eyes. “You do?”
“Fair point.”
But Sherlock froze. The name he had used. You cock… that reminded him of something. Someone had called him like that before, he knew. But who?
“Why do you need my help?”
Sherlock complied and opened his legs, not self-conscious at all about exposing his bare arse to John. The brunet pillowed his head on his arms. “Don’t make it too long, I want you to fuck me as soon as possible.”
If you want more just do it yourself, idiot. You don’t need to wait for me to tell you what to do.
, Sherlock typed as he arrived home.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ready to go meet him?" Mike asked as John opened the door of his sister’s flat. He really had no other places to go, since Mark threw him out after the break up.
“Sherlock, there’s someone for you downstairs,” Mrs.Hudson informed the man, her head poking from the doorframe.
And Sherlock and Mrs.Hudson both denied that they were smoking, but really it was most entertaining to watch them steal cigarettes to each other.
Carefully, they laid back together, John ending up on top of Sherlock. He slided down his body, hands caressing it on the way down. He felt the bump of Sherlock’s nipple under his palms, the silk of his stomach, the tickle of his hair below his navel, the strong muscles of his thighs. John slided his nose across Sherlock’s leg, following the curve of his knee, his calf, until he was at his feet. He looked up at his detective, finding those hypnotizing, incredible eyes staring down at him with wonder and incredulity, his breathing still slightly elaborated.
He rolled over with a grunt.
So the two men started to work in the kitchen, gathering the ingredients on the table, Sherlock classing them in the order they would be used. He then started to chop the vegetables when he noticed John measuring the spice. And clearly he did
"I can't think of anything right now."
And even though he had not seen the light of day in over a fortnight, those hours when he could hear the soft beating of the water falling remained the highlight of his days on the other side of the world. The slinking, forbidden memories of Baker Street flooded back in his mind with the force of a tsunami. The vibrations of his violin as he put notes together forming melodies in his ears. The flavoured breathing in of the steam dancing over his cup of tea. The sound of fingers typing on a keyboard, of the dull knock of nails against the wooden desk as John searched the right words for his blog.
At first he wasn’t really sure how to respond; should he make a really mean comment like he’d naturally do or simply inform the stranger he was texting a wrong number? Finally he decided on a sort of compromise.
keep condoms?” Sherlock asked back, as if there were somewhere else that would be more fit.
The latter jumped, dropping the sauce jar with a curse, then catching it on its way down by reflex. With a relieved sigh, he placed it with the other aliments, the adrenaline of the surprise wearing off. He turned around, wondering if Sherlock was there, when he realized the voice sounded a tad electronic, and that people were staring weirdly at him.
I really enjoyed writing this chapter, I hope you'll like it too! :)
The doctor fished his phone from his pocket.
But then John playfully elbowed his flatmate's flank with a smile, and Sherlock smiled back a bit bashfully.
“Changing the subject." A pause. "You know farting is natural, right? No need to be ashamed.”
“Enough of what? What are you talking about? Please keep a logical link between your sentences.”
Hello!
Thanks for reading, I hope you liked it! Feedback is always appreciated.
Sherlock’s way of bringing up things will never stop making him smile.
“I did an experiment to check which brand is the most resistant. There’s about ten boxes under the kitchen sink.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes again and got out of the flat in a dramatic swirl of coat, making John smile anew with a little shake of his head. He installed himself back at his post in front of the computer, continuing his blog post where he had left it. Just as he was about to type new words, he noticed the corner of the page flashing, alerting him he had a new comment on a post. An old one, actually, the first he wrote after meeting Sherlock. New fan, then. Well, at least he'll have a lot to read before he catches up and has to wait for updates. Curious, John clicked on the link to see what the person had written.
Which had been a perfect answer, Sherlock standards and all.
"Yeah, yeah, just a bit of a hangover."
He had spent the day hidden under a half disintegrated house, escaping from a small legion of Moriarty’s men who had put a price on his head. Before that, he had been held captive for 329 hours in a basement in Pakistan. It had been humid and unduly hot and dark, but for the first time in weeks, Sherlock had found comfort, tied down there. He couldn’t see anything, couldn’t touch anything. But he could hear.
The doctor stretched like a tired, happy cat and closed his eyes. He would just relax five minutes before it was his turn for the shower. Just five minutes…
Mainly snogging.
“We both know I’m going to win anyway.”
John smiled fondly, got up and pressed a kiss on the other man's lips and rearranged his coat collar. "Be careful," he whispered.
Sherlock sat down when John didn’t come out for awhile. He had decided what he was going to say earlier, and with which intonation, but he just wanted John to get there so he could just be done with it already. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to help John, it was that he didn’t know how successful he’d be at it. Better rip off the band-aid quickly in case it hurt.
The man batted his eyelids a few times, then his eyes opened wide, and he looked down at the bedsheets as if they were the most fascinating thing in the world. His cheeks bore an adorable shade of red.
“What do you want to do today?”
“Keep telling yourself that if you think I believe you,” John said, amused.
Some people liked to be dominated, Sherlock knew. He remembered Irene. The detective took that chance, waiting to see if his correspondent would be reactive.
“Yes. I don’t want to hurt you.”
The man just got up and left the room, looking right in front of him with his long black coat swirling dramatically behind him.
Hello everybody!
“Sherlock?” John asked as he walked into the kitchen, hands full of bags.
The man turned to face his flatmate.
Shaking his head to clear his mind, he typed:
John repressed an amused smile at the childish ridiculousness of Sherlock Holmes saying that sentence. “Let’s just settle for chess.”
"Yeah", John answered simply, deciding that letting his friend believe that was better than admitting he spent the night alone drinking cheap vodka Harry had stashed over the house and jerking off to a stranger’s texts. Re-reading those messages that morning, that said-stranger was really rude, he realized. But so had he been so could he blame the guy? He was really harsh and horny when drunk. But still, he didn’t feel ashamed about it. Even if he kind of had talked that Sherlock (what kind of a name is that??!) into it, he hadn’t forced him or anything, and hell, it’s not like he’s ever going to meet him. It had just been good.
Feedback is always appreciated.
"Feeling alright mate?" Mike asked with a worried voice.
“So, as I was saying, since he found out she was cheating on him with an athlete, he’s been concerned about his weight and believes that the knowledge of his diabete might make her go away for good and…”
“How long has it been?” the blond heard himself say.
"But that's impossible," the detective said slowly, looking at John with something indescriptible in his eyes. "He was... And you are..." He made a gesture with his hands, unable to find the right words.
“Come on, mate, don’t be so difficult. It’s going to be fun. You could gather information on cooking or something.”
John let out an amused chuckled. “So what? I like it that way.”
What were the odds of meeting two different men named Sherlock Holmes?
He froze, and a millisecond after, so did Sherlock. After what seemed like an eternity, John untangled himself, looking down at his flatmate with a confused brow.
“Let’s go in,” John murmured, and took Sherlock’s hand in his.
“Yeah, I know, odd name. But odd bloke, too.”
