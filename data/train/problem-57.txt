“Don’t barge in like that!” Mrs Hudson snapped, angry with so many police in her house. “You can’t be here!”
“How did you…know about Afghanistan?” A hint of defiance, a flash of the old John Watson. What in God’s name had happened to him?
. I did, at first, for a long time, but I don’t anymore, and I never should have.” John looked out the window.
“Mmhmm. Right here.” He tapped the right side of his skull, right behind the ear, “Every day, I live on a clock I have no control over.”
“You should come and visit us sometime, we’d love to have you.” Judith smiled, “We rather enjoy having guests. Well, my brother, my flat-mate, and I do. Sherlock could really care less. He kind of hates people.”
“Call me old man again and I’ll teach you a lesson.” He huffed as they moved, small rocking motions to get things properly started, “Dare you.”
“Oh, such lack of respect. You know, I can have you fired for talking to me like that?” Moriarty walked right up to John and looked him up and down. “Huh. Not much to look at, are you?”
“Of course, Holmes. A minute, if you don’t mind?” She looked over her shoulder at him. He shrugged and flounced out of the room, his rather ridiculous Belstaff coat swirling like a cape around him. Every person in the room watched and they all stared at her, dumbfounded.
As soon as her superior officer’s back was turned, Judith turned and headed for her office. She needed to put space between them. She would talk to them, gladly, but…God damn it! Judith heard the two of them talking in quiet voices behind her and resisted the urge to run and never stop until her legs gave out.
He was halfway to the Press Room by the time she caught up. Sally met them there, confused when she saw Judith.
“We’ll try not to.” He smiled and held the door for her, “I’ll get the kiddos back to Baker Street, then. Take care of my sister, Greg, alright?”
“In uni. A bloke named Sebastian Wilkes.” Sherlock sniffled a bit and tried to turn away from John, but he held him still.
“The rules don’t actually say what you think they do, Donovan. But if it makes any difference to you, they’re my informants today.”
“We’ll see about that.” John was going to reserve his judgment until he actually got to meet Sherlock Holmes.
“Always a few trusted partners on the outside you can turn to.” His smile was soft, wistful almost. If she had to put a word to it, wistful was a good one. Judith tugged on the collar of his surcoat and pulled him down until they were a breath apart.
?!” Roben had noticed that gorgeous red cloak Strange wore. Greg was pretty sure it was sentient but didn’t give much thought to an article of clothing that could think for itself. As they approached, he saw the cloak sway a bit and twist. He was sure that if it had been an animal, the thing would have raised its hackles and hissed at them. Well, to be more precise, it wasn’t
“Oh, I thought so! I thought it might be that!” Mrs Hudson just smiled and hugged them both, being careful of the fact that John had been hurt. “You boys just take care of yourself, and each other. I’ll have Baker Street for you when you come home.”
“They got here first and they didn’t mess up anything on the scene.” She said calmly, “I kept an eye on them the whole time, Anderson, so piss off.”
“I’ll show you sorry, Sherlock Holmes. Don’t you ever disrespect me again.” Moriarty yanked his hair painfully and pulled his head back until they looked at each other, “You won’t live to regret it.” And that, right there, those six words, sealed Moriarty’s fate.  He had openly and blatantly threatened Sherlock’s safety. Mycroft couldn’t do anything only so long as Moriarty maintained a certain neutrality. There were certain things he wasn’t allowed to do, and threatening Sherlock with violence was one.
“Of course.  Thank you, sir.” He said carefully. John maintained a calm he did not feel as he M got to his feet and held out one hand. Shaking hands with M, he looked around the office one last time. M walked him out, as was customary, and he paid a quick visit to Q-Branch before leaving MI6.
“Sherlock. His death…it wasn’t an accident. It wasn’t…” John raised his head and looked out the windscreen, drying his face on his sleeve, “He was killed on purpose.”
Once everything was where it belonged, John signed the log-sheet and turned away from the desk. It was quiet as he left the processing-area and as he stepped out onto the street after passing through an even quieter but not quite empty central reception, he looked around for any late-going taxis. He had no idea how he would get home, his watch read just past 10.00. Doing some quick math, he realized that he hadn’t been in Holding even two hours.
“Don’t be, no one else ever was.” Ford just shrugged. Anything else John wanted to say was put on hold when his phone rang.
“Sure I did! Didn’t take long to figure out what the real trick was. She lied to me, and lied to Joseph, too. I just didn’t say anything because I didn’t want her to hurt the kids.” Richard looked at the children, at Judith and John. They stood apart from the sisters and their families, heads together as they talked. It was clear in his posture that John Hughes recognized his sister’s senior rank and respected it, and watching the two together was a bit eerie.
“Clearly.” John just smiled. Kitty had gone from sitting on Sherlock’s lap to occupying his whole upper body practically. She was stretched from waist to shoulder, curled up a bit, just like she did with John after a long absence. “Well, she clearly likes
simple. I’ve seen the spells Judith and John can summon, the things they can do.” He ruffled his hair and chuckled. “Wow.”
“Jesus, you’re nothing like the other inspectors, neither of you.” She huffed, shaking her head. He produced a pack of cigarettes from a pocket and held it out to her. “Are you sure?”
“Y’know, I thought we were lucky this thing wasn’t a dog or a cat, I kind of expected it to hiss at us.” He rubbed the soft fabric between his fingers and smirked as it twitched. “Touchy thing, ain’t it?”
When her grandmother’s assistant saw her coming, there were no words exchanged, just a tilt of Eve Moneypenny’s dark head. Raised voices inside the office indicated a bit of trouble. Judith pushed open the door of the office. There were three people in the office when she entered, and a very heated discussion. She stayed still and observed for a moment, wondering what on earth had Mycroft Holmes and James Bond squaring off like this.
“Oh, it gets worse.” John took a sip of his beer. “I spent three weeks searching thousands of square miles of open desert between Lashkar Gah and Sulgara, crossing the Hindu Kush mountains in the process, and broke into a mountain base
“Anderson.” There was no hesitation, “Sherlock at least is too busy flouncing around London like a posh moron to bother me. Or bother
“Stop that.” Sherlock growled, looking up from his place between John’s legs, “Right this minute, you stop that.”
“Let me just find the … ” Hooper turned and hesitated when she saw John standing behind her, the log in hand.
“It...seemed a reasonable thing to do. I couldn’t...I couldn’t risk someone else doing to you what Moriarty got away with, I...” John trailed off, “Sherlock?”
“Only if I gain back all of the weight I lost in the past three years.” He sighed and dragged the jumper over his head. It was a little loose on his frame, but not awfully. Sherlock looked him up and down and came over, sliding two fingers under the waistband of his trousers with a nonchalance that would have annoyed John any other time. He hummed and gave a quick tug.
“No, James. You know he’s right. Just let it be and get away with a smack on the hand. You could have gotten yourself killed out there.”
Sherlock got his shoulders under John’s knees and settled in for a long bout of teasing and love-making. All he could do was hang on, and he tried his best to stay quiet. John knew he would probably forget his own damn name before sunrise, and that was okay with him. He wanted to forget, he
“She has quite a few targets to choose from.” He mused, not missing how the boys twitched uncomfortably in their seats, trying to remain still and failing a bit miserably. So much for Sherlock’s loudly-proclaimed lack of sexual interest in women. Or in anyone, really. But then again, he amended, Judith Watson had always been the chink in his brother’s armour. Both twins had been, for as long as they had been friends. Even when there had been no recognized blood between them, Judith had been friends with John Hughes. Their mother’s marriage to Richard Hughes had made them recognized family, despite a hidden record that put their names on the same birth-certificate: Judith Hermione Watson and John Hamish Watson.
“Thanks, Greg. I’ll stick around a bit longer, I guess.” Judith sighed and let Greg go. Radioing back to base, she was informed that she was off the clock if she cared to go off-duty, she’d been working for almost twenty-four hours straight by now.
“Damn it! Hello! Anyone home?!” She called out. Lights were on, but she didn’t get the feeling anyone was actually
“I want to watch Rosie grow up and go her own way,” Sherlock spoke softly, but firmly. “I want to grow old with you, John. I want to retire with you, go somewhere quiet and live out the rest of our useful days together.”
Things are heating up and pieces of the serial suicides puzzle are starting to come together. Maybe not the exact picture any of them were expecting, but with the likes of the Watsons and Sherlock Holmes on the case, it's only a matter of time.
“Not every day I’m kidnapped off a busy street, knocked unconscious, and wake up strapped to a bomb-vest.” She muttered, reaching for the wire of a radio ear-piece. A good tug brought it lose and Jim worked on getting her out of the vest, “What were you planning to do?”
“Have your parents get Rosie. Hold onto her for us.” He whispered. Ford nodded and placed a call on his phone.
“You’re just getting that now?” Jim blinked at him, almost disappointed. “Oh, you are a slow one, Mr Holmes.”
“Doubt his name is that understated.” John took the license back and looked at the familiar face. “Never twins. It’s
“Good luck, and be in touch.” The handsome young man he had taken rooms with just smiled a bit shyly and watched John disappear around the corner as he went out and down the stairs. He called out to Mrs Hudson at the bottom of the stairs.
“Those are always the best. What’s she like, this lucky girl of yours?” Magnus guided him through the shop, and he spilled out everything he knew about Judith. Everything she had done for him and for the city of London, never asking for anything in return. From him, all she wanted was a roof over her head, a warm bed, and reliable support. He wanted to give her more than that.
“So, where in his mind is it okay to cheat on his wife with a coworker who doesn’t seem that interested?”
“I will. I know. Don’t worry about me.” She shook her head, “And if you don’t buckle down and ask Doctor Palmer out on a proper date, I’m going to steal her.”
“We’ll do our best, Chief.” Judith looked at Greg and Sally, “But that precludes us getting to him before Moriarty talks him into committing suicide.”
Sherlock finds work, and John joins him on a case. And Sherlock learns something about John, something rather important.
“Oh, Sherlock.” In a flash, he was in his brother’s arms, safe and cared for. “I’m so sorry. Did he threaten you?”
Judith and John split their time between their regular jobs, rebuilding London Sanctum, and spending whatever spare time they had left at Kamar-Taj continuing their education in the mystic arts. She heard from Stephen Strange by emails and phone calls but didn’t see him much. Which was unfortunate, but they were both acceptably busy with their respective careers and lived on completely different continents. And Judith maintained her relationship with Greg. He was her normal in a very bizarre world, and she desperately needed normal.
“You two have made my job hard enough, so shut up!” She snapped at the boys, who fell silent. Brook whimpered, covering his head as if afraid of physical violence.
“Because I married the woman who tried to kill you twice. Tried twice, failed twice, and so help me she’s not getting another chance.” He hugged Sherlock tightly, revelling in the sound of his breathing, the living heartbeat, and closed his eyes.
“Hmm.” She yawned, “I don’t know about you two, but I’m beat to hell. I need a few hours of sleep before the next level of hell splits open.”
leaves that house, if anyone comes to call, I want to know. Names and stats of any visitors, am I clear?”
As soon as Sherlock Holmes saw the ad in the Lost & Found section of the papers advertising for a recovered Belstaff coat of specific tailoring, he knew what had happened to
“I didn’t think I would be, sir.” She cleared her throat and tossed the rag in the direction of a laundry-bin behind her, stepping forward to shake hands with the inspectors. “Judith Watson, gentlemen, a pleasure.”
“Oh, don’t worry, they’re not suffering for money too badly. He gets a pension every month from Mycroft out of the trust-fund until he turns thirty. Part of a deal they made in an attempt to get Sherlock clean.”
“Greg, you know you don’t have to…” John was trying to plead Sherlock’s innocence, but they had their orders. And exceptionally good acting. This hurt Greg, it hurt all of them.
to ask for a lawyer, and he had basically agreed that after this was over, he would go to jail quietly. Not that he had much time left. As Sherlock had already deduced, he was sick, dying.
“Thank you!” she called down, the sound of her boots heavy on the stairs. Greg sighed and stepped out onto the quiet mews street just as a black car pulled up. Without a word, he passed his keys to the woman who rolled down the window.
“What’s wrong?” Mrs Hudson came out of her flat, a little frantic. “Has something happened to Sherlock?”
“Ask for Doctor Stamford when you get there. He knows Jude. He’ll make sure she’s well taken care of.” John said grimly. That was the last she heard of them, the door were shut and they got underway. She dozed off along the way, and didn’t wake up again for several hours.
Sure enough, they didn’t wait five minutes for a call to come through on the radio for a potential domestic disturbance called in by neighbours.
“Grand idea.” John grinned and settled down next to Sherlock. They spent a few minutes watching the trio of Yarders below them arguing over the gods knew what business, enjoying the last of their coffee. All of a sudden, Greg threw his hands out and turned his back on Donovan and Anderson.
“Jesus, Sherlock! For a guy your size, you’re pretty solid.” She rolled her shoulder and got a bit of breathing room.
“This isn’t a business-trip in the strictest sense of the word, Colonel!” Mycroft Holmes didn’t look disgustingly smug, to no one’s surprise, “A bit of pleasure went into planning this visit!”
Sherlock joined her after a while, and John found a stable voice halfway through. It was something they had actually done during their service together, something that kept him calm when things got too hard. By the time he had calmed down, Judith realized it was half-four. She sighed and debated skipping her run this morning. She hadn’t missed a run in months, and after last night, she felt a bit too wired to sleep in. She groaned and untangled herself from the knot of bodies and padded into the loo. Judith finished her morning ablutions and went in search to the running-kit she kept at Baker Street for the nights she stayed over. She kept her clothes up in John’s old room, which had never actually been slept in. She made the climb quietly, skipping over the squeaky risers.
“Explains why he tried to keep me out of the house.” John sighed, “I’m too happy to have you back, Sherlock, I won’t repeat myself.”
“I will.” Sherlock got to his feet and brushed off his hands. “As for these victims, get Branson Vendell to talk. He’ll have all the answers you could want that I don’t have for you.”
“Yes, Major, thank you. That will be all.” The ginger snapped and sent Kendrick scrambling with a muttered apology. Oh, she would be paying for this mess later for certain. Was it too late to turn in for retirement?
“Good.” He nodded and felt a shift in the man in front of him, and moved with him. “Oh, no you don’t. Put down your gun, Mr Lachey, or we’re going to have some serious trouble here.”
“Mine, too.” Sherlock tilted his head with that soft, boyish smile of his and John was struck by how truly young he was. Sixteen years wasn’t a terrible gap, but it showed in the smoothness of Sherlock’s skin, the babyish quality of his facial features. John knew he was old beyond use and had been put out to pasture by not one but two services. It was a bad way to be for a man of action like him. He got bored, and that generally led to him getting into trouble.
“God, you’re gorgeous.” He whispered, a little awestruck at the unusual beauty of Sherlock Holmes. He was certainly not traditionally handsome or beautiful, but in his own extraordinary way. John had dated women who didn’t hold a candle to Sherlock, and men as well.
“I enlisted. He dropped out of school shortly after I left for the Army. John joined me three years later and informed me that Sherlock had pretty much disappeared for a while.”
“To get help. You stay here, sit on the house until either I get back or our back-up arrives!” She was halfway out the door. She put out her own call to Dispatch even as she returned to her car and headed for Marylebone.
“What about the press-conference?” He tilted his head to one side, a little startled by the change of dynamic and sudden close contact.
“Word got to us you’re cleared to fly one of these! Come with me!” The man grinned and tossed off a salute. John wondered who in hell’s name had dug up
“Of course it will matter, you caught his game before anyone else did.” Mycroft looked at her, “It was a brave thing you did tonight, Judith. We taught you well, didn’t we?”
“God, are you sure about that?!” Greg couldn’t get over the fact that John and Judith were literally almost identical, “He looks more like you than the others!”
in my power to make sure you and your family are safe from Beverley Watson for the rest of your lives.”
all?” He chuckled and twirled the stemmed glass between his fingers, “Mike, you’re not trying to set me up on a
“If I was Sherlock Holmes, where would I go?” He muttered to himself as he stood on a street corner in Picadilly Circus. He wasn’t sure why, but something told him to head east. He didn’t know what was waiting for him, but John knew better than to question a hunch like that. He’d spent most of his adult life surviving on such things, after all. So, east he went, away from the lights and chaos of Piccadilly towards ... well, more chaos and more lights, just slightly less of both.
Greg rolled his eyes and looked up to the corner of the office where he knew at least one camera was set up. There were at least two other cameras in this office, he just hadn’t bothered to find them all.
“Doctor. I wish we were meeting on happier terms, but nothing for it, eh?” He glanced over his shoulder at Roben, who stared in shock, “Can’t say I’m sorry for the nasty shock my boss just got a minute ago.”
“I wanted to. I don’t regret a minute of it.” He pulled her into a kiss that had her gone weak in the knees.
“I am grateful of their interference in one matter only, but they can otherwise very unkindly fuck off out of my business.” He snapped. “My brother is enough of a hassle, I do not need the rest of them putting their infuriating noses where they do not belong!”
“I don’t have much use for toys, but that’s not the question you are asking. Yes, I have. As a matter of personal hygiene, I prefer to maintain myself that way.”
“I’m working tonight. Of course.” She handed the boys her card, “Here, call if you ever need a thing, alright? Be safe tonight. I don’t want you two showing up on my roster as the next homicide.”
“Your state of exhaustion will heighten your sense of awareness. I apologize for the disorientation. Brace yourself.” The Ancient One gave only that warning before she struck Judith in the chest. What happened next could only be described as an out-of-body experience in the truest sense of the word.
and I’ll sleep easier.” Richard’s eyes darkened, “Lord knows how I tried to steer her right, but she just didn’t have a care. And after what happened this morning, I don’t feel safe in my own house anymore.”
“The Court leaves me alone for a reason. They know I have no interest in that business, and they don’t force it on me.” John shrugged, shoving his hands into his pockets, “My mum might’ve been a Lycan, but she abandoned me when I was ten. Left me with my sister, who started drinking when she turned sixteen and hasn’t been sober for more than a week since then. And Da was never around, given what he was. I didn’t care, his kind doesn’t stay for good reason.”
“Sherlock,” Greg said, warning Sherlock before he got sense knocked into him. John just raised an eyebrow and looked around. Most of the personnel on the beachhead had either disappeared and retreated to a safe distance, it was just John, Sherlock, Greg, and Anderson right now. And a dead body.
“Oh, look who it is.” Anderson looked past John, who had already turned around at the sound of a familiar voice. “Hello, Sherlock.”
She shook her head and hopped into her car. Originally, she had planned to return it to Kensington, but she had decided to keep her car. It made getting around much easier.
“If you like, we can go up there together. He should be in the lab right now.” Stamford said finally. “He either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night.”
“I’m still learning, but on my own time now.” She took Greg’s hand in her. “Maybe I’ll take you with me next time, you can meet my instructor.”
he was getting arrested. Of course he was. He groaned and stayed absolutely still. Once the man holding him down was sure he was properly restrained, the weight on his back disappeared.
“I told you how this ends. Your death is the only thing that’s gonna call off the killers.” Moriarty wasn’t even looking at him anymore, “I’m certainly not gonna do it.”
Mycroft all made an appearance, along with M and her step-family, Judith wondered who had spread the word that fast. Probably Mycroft, if she had to guess. Well, no matter, she had a family to cheer her on.
“Yes, thank Mr. Holmes for me, will you? I know he said something, or I’d have been out on my arse with nothing to show for it.” Moran smiled and pulled her off the floor, “Get up. Won’t do having the likes of you sitting on the dirty floor.”
“Plenty of people will miss me. Though, I couldn’t say the same for you.” Sherlock gave him a once-over. “Who are you, anyway? One of my brother’s stupid lackeys, no doubt. I
“I was, yes. Your intelligence was correct.” Alexandra’s demeanour softened and she looked at their hands, noting the rings. “But I was welcomed back to the Court ten years ago and my titles and privileges were reinstated.”
“Half-one in the morning.” He smiled and led her inside, “Go upstairs and take a shower, I guarantee you’ll feel better if you do.”
“And another one on the way, it looks like.” Greg raised an eyebrow, “Good breeding-stock in the Hughes family, eh?”
“Well, no. Wouldn’t expect him to.” John smiled and shook hands with Moran, “Civilian life is treating you well, Major.”
“Yes, ma’am.” He came over, well-aware of the curious eyes and whispers of her men watching every move and word. When he was in range, she reached out, caught hold of him by the front of his jacket, and pulled. The shock in his eyes was adorable. “What are you doing?”
After Sherlock had worked wonders with Judith’s hair, they sat up and talked for hours, wandering out to get food at the chow-hall before the soldiers took it all, and returning to continue their conversation. That night was enjoyable, and the two following days were interesting as Judith caught up with a very old friend and actually behaved herself on an inspection.
“Made things interesting for one of The Yard’s medical consultants.” He mused, “Never mind one of their constables.”
“Y-yeah. Of course. Thank you, Mr. Hope.” Greg closed the door once Hope was inside the squad-car and gave orders to the constables. They would take Mr. Hope to Paddington Green Police Station for questioning.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. He broke the rules." His brother’s touch was welcome, comforting, “Find the man who recovered your coat.”
After solving the taxi-cab murders, Judith settles into a routine at The Met in Criminal Investigation Division, reporting to work every morning at eight, and returning home whenever she gets a chance. But she knows the quiet never lasts very long, it's just a question of who, how, and where. She should know better than to ask a question she may not really want to be answered.
“You owe me a few hours of sleep, mate.” Greg grumbled, nicely tanned from his vacation, “It’s only because your sister’s got a scary side to her that I didn’t complain about it too much. Is she like that often?”
“Not really, but…I couldn’t help myself. You’re so…nice.” Donovan loosened her fingers and Judith watched the spedometer needle tremble down as the car slowed. “Oh, good thing we’re in a marked car, yeah?”
“I was thinking about that case last month.” She sighed. As she’d expected him to, Greg stiffened and she felt his grip tighten.
small. Now, thanks to Glamour, he could appear smaller than his given size, as he imagined John could as well. Which really begged the question of how tall John was in his Other Form. He carefully refolded the Hybrid pelt, wondering what the Lycan half had offered John. After wrapping the pelt in the protective coverings, he closed the case and looked for the item he had dropped earlier. It was a small box, a familiar box. Not
to say something, but the complaint didn’t get very far and he settled for a hostile truce. Enough people
“You don’t have the time or resources to look after me all the time, Mycroft, I can take care of myself.”
“I tagged the cab with a tracking-device when I found it in Brixton. The scans tell me where it is in London, anywhere in London.” She glanced at the screen, then at the cab trailing, “That’s him. Don’t say anything to the boys, I don’t want him to get suspicious.”
Lighting from the ambulance, Sherlock took John’s hand in his and looked around. The street was still full of Met cars and uniformed personnel, he spotted Mycroft, Lestrade, and Alexandra standing by the open door of 221B. Going inside, he led John upstairs. But they didn’t do anything more than shower and find clean clothes before going back downstairs. Mrs Hudson was waiting for them, she looked worried and disappointed. But not with them.
Then, in 2009, Judith received new orders. She now had fifteen years of commendable service under her belt and she was eligible for retirement. She wouldn't have made a huge deal out of it if the orders had been handed over by one of her commanding officers, but she knew something was up when, as she returned from a morning patrol, she saw a chopper coming in from the east, in from Kandahar by the looks of it.
“Maybe. Definitely an amateur.” John drummed his fingers against his thigh until Sherlock took his hand to stop him.
Part 1 of 2. Things get underway with the puppy-napping case and John starts piecing the clues together on his own.
“Mutual. More his than mine, to be honest.” It wasn’t so much that John and Harry weren’t on speaking terms anymore, it was
“John.” His first thought was for John Watson. Dear, sweet John Watson, who had stayed at his side through every mad adventure he’d managed to drag up for them, never doubting him for a moment, trusting him to keep them both alive. Trusting Sherlock, London’s most-wanted would-be criminal, to hold a loaded gun to the side of his head and take him hostage.
None of the usual resources useful for keeping track of the residents of 221B Baker Street were able to provide any knowledge of his whereabouts when put under duress, and the line of questioning stopped when Mrs Hudson stood up to Mycroft Holmes and told him “Even if I did know where that boy was, you would be behind the last person I would bother to tell! You go back to minding your own damn business, Mr Holmes, and leave me to mine! I’m of half a mind to use this rolling-pin on you, get out of my house!” And he had quietly acquiesced to the irate landlady. His source at The Met went cold when Greg Lestrade pretty much locked him out of the office and told him to stop coming ‘round. He was too busy with honest work to bother about John’s whereabouts. The Homeless Network closed its ranks as well and Mycroft was left with no leads or resources. God help him if anything befell John Watson, Sherlock would never ever forgive him.
“But you scared the soul out of him.” She sighed and held out one hand to Brook, “I don’t think he’s lying to us about who he is.”
He looked up at the ceiling, listening to the water run upstairs, “Listen, I need to know if any incidents have been called in this morning, what they were, who reported them, and what’s being done about them. Can you do that for me?”
“He’s in charge. Detective Inspector. Smartest man at The Met, and the best. He’s also my brother’s boyfriend.”
do?” John took one cup and gave it to Sherlock. “I’ll trade you the teacup for the cat. She didn’t get you, did she?”
“Stay upright, son, I’ll be right back.” She patted the queasy constable on the shoulder and darted under the line when Donovan was distracted, snagging a bucket, a towel, three flannels, and two bottles of water from the cart. From experience, she knew the bottles cost about a quid each, and made a note to leave equivalent pay on the cart. She wouldn’t be accused of stealing from a hotel like that.
“Mmhm. I want to take one of the boats out to Eustacia Island and get some manoeuvring practice in after the test.”
“Right away, ma’am!” The poor corporal rushed to silence the claxons, white as a sun-bleached sheet. Barrymore might be scary, but Judith could be down-right frightening. After all, she hadn’t reached Lieutenant-Colonel by being nice all the time. Not that she took any great
Three of them said it in unison. Judith and Sherlock weren’t likely to inflict harm on Brook, but that didn’t mean John would play nice.
“Nah.” John shook his head and collected empty plates, “Greg knows I come back here when I need a safe place to stay. Told the boys over there at The Met that if they saw the curtains move, don’t bother until they got called.”
“This isn’t how it happens.” She muttered, kneeling beside her brother to close Sherlock’s eyes, “This isn’t how it ends. Only one of them will die today, and it will
“If she won’t, I will!” Sally took a deep sip of coffee, “Happy to! She basically sold out for spite’s sake because Sherlock told her where to shove it!” Sherlock made a dismissive gesture.
“I thought that was my job.” Sherlock smirked and looked at him, “Anything else I need to know about you?”
“Hell if I know! That’s an Airbus, could be anywhere!” She went to drop off her gear and headed straight to the helipad. Something told her the chopper was in for her. She crouched at the edge of the LZ, ducking the blade-wash. This wasn’t a long visit, this was a touch-and-go. Hmm. She watched field-personnel open the doors of the chopper and two men hopped out.
“Well, as for me I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. There is usually some manner of human body parts involved.” Sherlock studied the concrete between his shoes. John could only imagine what he was looking at. “Would that annoy you?”
“Don’t be sorry, Harry was a terrible brother. Drank and gambled himself into debt and into a divorce, and then drank himself to death.”
“Which is more than I can say for others. My brothers regard them as a nuisance, fuzzy assassins, and Bond and Trevelyan call them little saboteurs.”
By the time they arrived, they had a good half the Yard in tow behind them. It didn’t take long to shut down Baker Street and less time to get inside. With Sally and Greg at her back, she knocked on the door of 221 Baker Street with the handle of her torch.
Two days later, John looked out the window of Baker Street and found the sidewalk crowded with reporters. It was barely past eight in the morning, he noted with a sense of disdain.
“Nothing. Just a patrol passing the house. Standard procedure.” John let the curtain fall back into place and safed his weapon, putting it on the coffee-table, “And even if they saw me, they wouldn’t stop.”
After situating the cats, who were either indifferent or displeased with being left behind, Judith, Greg, and the boys left Baker Street. Judith took Greg, the boys took a cab right behind. As they headed back to Brixton, Greg kept looking in the rearview mirror, tracking the cab that stayed a few car-lengths behind. They were obviously going faster, but Sherlock would have told the driver to keep their car in sight as much as possible.
“Literally?” He grinned at her, “Don’t let me get in your way, Captain. You have an important job to do.”
“A year ago. Sent me home two weeks after it happened.” He shrugged, as if it didn’t bother him, “The transition period was a bit rough, of course.”
“Christ, what a fucking crazy night! Are you two okay?” John hung his jacket before collapsing on the couch as Judith locked the door.
“Oh, just close your eyes, 008.” Q rolled his eyes and folded his arms to wait until John did what he was told. “I’m not going to push you off a building or anything drastic like that. I like you too much.”
He caught sight of the metal band around John’s wrist and raised an eyebrow. That was for the metal hardware the surgeons in France had used to replace the shattered joint. The first replacement, done in Kabul, had infected and the resulting scramble had left the rest of them a bit worried about John’s future. He didn’t seem too concerned now, moving around with the aid of a cane when he needed it, which was far less these days than before. He’d gone off the reservation and disappeared for four months before resurfacing two weeks ago in Central London with no proof of how he’d gotten back or where he had spent the prior four months. There was no trace of him on any flight anywhere, he had just…arrived.
Leaving her quarters, which felt a bit bittersweet, Judith walked along the ranks of bunks and cots in the barracks-tents, knowing she would never have to face the living-conditions of a military base ever again in her life if she found that fitting. Her men gave her a hell of a passing-out ceremony, half the base turned out, and by the time she arrived at the command tents, it was almost surreal. She exchanged salutes with all of her commanders, who were awfully sorry to be losing such a gifted officer, but if anyone deserved it, she certainly made the cut. After all, she’d been in service since her seventeenth birthday and hadn’t ever looked back or questioned or acted out, excepting one or two incidents during inspections, but her service-record was sparkling and she had several commendations and a number of honours to her name. After the impromptu passing-out ceremony, Judith led the way out to the helipad.
“Ta.” John stepped into the sterile white room lined with rows and rows of shelves and wheeled gurneys covered in white sheets. Some were occupied, some weren’t. It was a familiar sight for John, he wasn’t uncomfortable being around so many dead bodies. Death was kind of an integral part of his work, after all. He stood quietly by as Hooper and Holmes bickered, hands behind his back and feet shoulder-width apart.
“Don’t lie to me, Riley. He was here last night, and if he’s left this house without me knowing, I will search every dark corner of this city to find him.” She handed Riley over to Sally and pushed the door open with her foot, looking around, “I have Mr. Brook’s safety in mind which is more than I can ever say for you.” The flat was quiet, it looked empty, but she cleared it and found Brook in the bedroom. As soon as he saw her, registered her uniform, his eyes widened.
“Wonder what the rest of it is. That family, if it’s the one I know, has the most bizarre habits for naming their children. Sherlock was always so bloody defensive about his name.” He shook his head, “Took me ages to learn his full name. Told me his name was William Sherlock Scott Holmes, that was the whole of it. Just in case we ended up having a son.”
“I’m sorry.” The door rattled and the tall fey emerged, eyes hollow and bloodshot. John couldn’t see any visible injury, but he knew the man was shaken. John smiled and guided him to the sinks, carefully washing his face for him.
“Unless you’ve got Werekin blood. I do.” He sighed, head bowed, “My Mum was a Werewolf, Lycan, actually. Shapeshifter. Da was a Cù-Sìth, never knew ‘im growing up, he didn’t stay after I was born.”
her brother’s flat from where they sat, actually. Thinking on it, she moved down and parked out front of the flat. It wouldn’t bother the boys, they were used to her doing it. But her partner was a little confused.
“I said, you’re getting out of here. Bail’s been posted. Come on.” The bailiff unlocked the door as John got unsteadily to his feet. He was far less drunk than he had been when they’d put him in here, but not quite stable on his feet yet. John made his careful way to the door and stepped out. As a matter of policy, they put him in handcuffs before they led him away from the cell. The walk to Processing was quiet, but John didn’t mind that. He just wondered who had found out about this and decided to take pity on him and bail him out of Holding.
“You’re thirty-two years old, Dio, you’ll be thirty-three next June. You’ve been in service to the Army for fifteen years, sixteen on your next birthday, that’s nothing to sniff at.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, spitting out an old nickname, “You’ve shown exemplary bravery and loyalty time and again. I carried those letters from Spencer House myself.”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock just smiled and trailed a hand up John’s arm as he got into position. John took Sherlock’s hand in his as he began to push, keeping track of the minute changes in the younger man’s responses, the way his facial expression and breathing changed, the way his body tensed or relaxed.
“Oh, be nice, Sherlock.” He scolded as Donovan caught sight of them and pointed them out to Greg, who turned in their direction and shaded his eyes. Like two cheerful kids, they waved and John distinctly saw his lips shape the words “What the bloody hell?” when he saw them sitting up there. It wasn’t long before Greg was standing below them, arms folded across his chest as he looked up at them.
have a final count for the puppies that had been stolen: eighty-four puppies, averaging between five and thirteen puppies taken per hit – including three full litters of ten, ten, and twelve each. This was
“Oh, stop it, Locket, you’re being ridiculous.” Moriarty waved off the man’s concern, “I gave it back, didn’t I?”
“Make sure my silly companion finds a way home, will you? I’m afraid he was a bit too stubborn and refused a free ride home with me tonight.”
“Rather good at it, never mind my brother’s injury. We took it easy, yeah, but it felt damn good to lay our grievances to the pavement.” She sighed, “God, we came so
interesting.” He fished something out of his coat pocket. “Something I saw this morning but didn’t think much of it until I realized the discrepancy.” He had taken a receipt for a few hundred pounds of meat, which was a bit odd for a vegetarian restaurant. Something was up, and he was willing to bet there was a direct link between whatever was out on the moors and the orders of meat at The Crossed Keys.
“Oh, it’s Judith Watson! Well, that’s a sight for these sore old eyes!” The kind man was in tears, he knew, even as he threw his arms around Judith and hugged her so tight something in her spine popped.
“Sure.” John honestly didn’t care where they went. Greg did the driving, and they were looking for parking twenty minutes later along Francis Street. Finding an empty spot, Greg took it for himself. John paid for the parking and they went into the pub. It was remarkably busy for a Thursday night, but that made sense.
“Yeah, well, bollocks to the both of ‘em.” John huffed, folding his arms across his chest, “Feel like giving The Yard a bit of a shock, then?”
“Yes, sir.” Anderson backed off, apparently knowing this wasn’t a fight to pick right this minute. John followed Greg to a body that had clearly been in the water for a while, taking the pair of offered nitrile gloves. At first glance, he’d say two weeks in the water. Bloating and decomp was pretty advanced and there were very few recognizable features.
“I’ve got a sponsor. For every life I take, money goes to my kids.” A casual shrug, “The more I kill, the better off they’ll be. You see? It’s nicer than you think.”
“Heard you went out of town for a few hours tonight, after you pulled in Costas.” He murmured as he used her for a pillow. Judith sighed and ran her fingers through his hair.
“I’d be an idiot of the highest degree if I didn’t think you had connections to the Royal Family.” She looked up across the desk at Sherlock, “Am I right?” He didn’t answer, but she saw the flush of colour at his collar. She smirked.
now, is it?” He grinned. Judith rolled her eyes. She squeaked when he went for another kiss, this one harder than the last. They ended up back inside, Judith giggling as the mattress bounced under her weight. They didn’t get very far before the sound of a phone ringing interrupted them.
With business to attend to, he went into the morgue and greeted a subdued, tearful Molly Hooper. He noticed that the sorcerers stayed outside with Sally, and figured that they had already seen the bodies. Molly stood behind two prep-tables, each one with a sealed body-bag tagged for the victims of the standoff. Greg hung back while James Roben approached the tables. He looked at both tables and tapped the left table.
“Ah, but we both know that there are far more opportunities available at Saint Bart’s to those who are … shall we say, sufficiently motivated?”
“I’ve seen too many weird things on the beat for something as simple as the existence of magic to surprise me. But it’s
“Should’ve seen the man’s eyes when I told him what I was looking for, just about committed him for the way he kept smiling.” John had given him a nearly identical ring to the one he had given John, which was both touching and a little worrisome. He and John exchanged rings, just as they had entrusted their pelts and freedoms to each other a moment ago, and Sherlock noticed that they each wore one silver ring on the right hand and the primary band on the left hand with the second silver band flush.
what, but he knew. He sees enough Fey to know what’s what and how to handle an order from one.” Watson smiled. “Why don’t we go inside?”
“You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him, I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him in the labs.” he said; “You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.”
“Mycroft Holmes, what have you done this time?” She muttered, reading over the paperwork. It was everything she needed to go full-time at The Met, but…not as a Special Constable.
Two mugs of tea and fifteen minutes wrapped in blankets in front of a warm fire did the trick to get Judith warmed up properly. Once Stephen was satisfied with her she kicked off the blankets, folding them over the back of the couch and laying the house-coat on top. Standing by the fire-place, she looked out the massive windows of the Sanctum’s penthouse.
Riyah and another of the girls led her through the restaurant and through the side-door that led into the small cluster of dressing-rooms set aside for the girls between sets.
“Alright, I’m sorry.” She sighed, properly humbled, “I had to save John and Sherlock from a military inquiry. That wasn’t my idea of fun.”
knew about the situation. To say the team was startled would be tame. John and Sherlock returned from tracking down Moriarty while Judith was in the ambulance. Moran was with them, she was kind of surprised to see her former commanding officer. She also wondered how much trouble Jim was going to be in because of this. It wasn’t often Judith could make so many people look so worried.
The next bit happened so quickly he was a little surprised by the speed of his sergeant and the twins. It was Sally and Judith who did most of the take-down, and it was glorious. Using Claudia’s momentum against her, the girls caught Claudia by one arm apiece and pinned her to the desk, making short work of putting her in cuffs. Judith had one hand on the back of his wife’s neck in a nape-pinch that would hurt like a bitch if she applied the right pressure.
they would be requiring two bedrooms. He paced the span of the room once, window to wall, and decided to get the blood flowing a bit. Dropping to the floor, John braced himself up, palms flat against the worn grain of the hardwood, smoothed by time and full of tiny imperfections. He did twenty push-ups, twenty sit-ups, and then, feeling quite a bit more energised, decided a shower was in order.
“Ahh! Johnny Boy!” Moriarty turned to John, beaming, “What an unexpectedly pleasant surprise! What on earth are you doing here?”
“Damn it, Sherlock!” Judith groaned and dialled her brother once she was out of the Press Room. It rang out three times before it picked up.
“Not precisely.” Q shrugged as he held the door for John. The Quartermaster went beyond seeing him out of the division and walked with him to the car-park. There, he discovered that Q was hell-bent on spoiling him before he bid Section Six farewell.
“Don’t worry about her. I’ll get her on a few minor charges. Blackmail, slander, libel, defamation of character. A few things.”
“Yep.” Sherlock popped the “p” like he always did and gulped the last of his coffee, “Shall we, then?”
.” He gestured with the memory stick, obtained for them by John Watson, then began to turn in a slow circle while he waited for a response. He had terms for this exchange. The pen-drive for Judith Watson’s safety. Wherever she was, he held the ransom-price in his hand. And he would settle for nothing less than her safe return, in exchange for those plans. If she had been harmed, the deal was off.
“You don’t get to decide who comes on a scene or not, Watson. You’re not even a real cop!” Anderson snarled, “You’re just a wash-out with too much time on your hands and a misguided sense of entitlement!”
“Nah, she’s not even my wife anymore.” Richard handed him a stack of papers, “Divorce contract, signed and sealed and notarized two days ago. Do whatever the hell you want with her.”
“Well, I would say be careful, but that doesn’t seem quite right for a retired Double-Oh.” Sherlock tilted his head a bit. “But do take care of yourself, please.”
“You’ve got fifteen minutes to explain yourself, sir. I haven’t been addressed by military rank since I pulled retirement back in July of last year, except by my men. I see them once every two months.”
“I want to…” Sherlock hesitated. How did he admit that he didn’t want to be alone? That he didn’t want to be separated from John? At all? He had never been close to anyone besides his brother, and strangers generally didn’t appeal to him. Making friends was almost impossible for him, so he generally didn’t bother to try. However, John was…different. Sherlock didn’t know what made him different, but he was hoping they would have time to explore together.
family now. Don’t ever forget that, alright?” Judith did something very daring and closed the little bit of distance between them. “Call or drop by if you need something. New Scotland Yard or the house on Pembroke Mews, and Baker Street for John. Be well, Stephen.”
“At ease, son, we’re not in Afghanistan anymore.” She tilted his head back to get a look at his eyes, “Gereshk, wasn’t it? May of ‘06?”
On the morning of the 30th, Judith woke up with a restlessness in her bones that didn’t go away with a ten-mile run that she dragged Greg out on. It was foggy but there was no real rain. The cold had them running hard and when they got back to the house, disturbing Queenie and Rocket, who had curled up for a snooze, she headed upstairs to take a shower.
“Absolutely.” Sherlock’s voice was soft and deep in his ear, his hands warm and firm on his shoulders, “I believe there’s always a chance to be happy. We just have to take the risk and jump.”
inch of him when Sherlock dropped to his knees without hesitation.  It felt nice to be cared for and tended to like this.
Whatever Jim Moriarty had done to Judith Watson, she was in bad shape. She had lost consciousness during the ride from Camden Sports Center to Saint Bart’s and hadn’t woken up yet. But she didn’t want for visitors, there was almost
“Jesus.” She reached up and pulled the radio earpiece from her ear, breathing heavily as delayed shock began to hit her. That vest was a dummy-vest, she knew that, Jim knew that, but her body had reacted as it would in a real bomb-threat situation. Greg looked at her for a moment, then hurried towards the door. Probably to look for the boys. Judith’s knees buckled and she staggered against the nearest support, the edge of one of the changing cubicles.
“No, we caught it on the broadband.” Her brother noticed the cat and raised an eyebrow, “Who’s your fuzzy friend?”
“Of course. Thank you, Mr. Holmes, that will do.” Sally somehow managed to sound formal despite the look on her face, which was really something. When she turned to Anderson, she was all business, “Anderson.” With a brisk nod, she turned and headed back to the line while John and Sherlock passed by a flustered Anderson to enter the house. Judith shrugged and went inside. The boys stopped at the bottom of the stairs long enough to change into PPE gear, chatting with Greg, who listened to the retelling of their encounter outside with a smug glee.
“You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,” Mike said with an expression John had seen before on Q and Mycroft’s faces as recently as this same week; “perhaps you would not care for him.”
“Oh, I wish.” He rolled his eyes. “You know, there’s a good fucking reason your brother pulled me in.”
stopped the feisty blond soldier from getting things done. A few weeks bed-ridden in May and then it was off to driving his care-teams and therapists batty. If a bullet to the hip couldn’t take down John Hughes, Mycroft wasn’t entirely certain he wanted to know what
“Yes, please.” Sherlock leaned in a bit as John got up on tiptoe and they kissed. Just a quick thing, and it was with great reluctance that they parted. They did have things to do and places to go, after all.
“Made sure he can’t use magic to escape, but I didn’t take his power away, I can’t do that and wouldn't want to if I could.” She looked up at Stephen Strange, who had been her teacher for three months while still a student himself. She hadn’t been a student in a while, and neither had he, but together they had learned a few things. Strange took her back to London, and they walked the quiet streets for a while.
“He would have done the same exact thing I did, with a bit more physical damage to the goons.” Judith shifted her weight forward and tucked one leg under her as the vest was removed and set aside. “How angry is Seb going to be?”
“It’s the fog!” Judith shouted, covering her mouth with her sleeve, “It’s the fog, don’t breathe in! Don’t breathe!”
Once the cats were taken care of, Judith checked her watch for the time, and checked her phone for messages. Nothing important or new. Sighing, she fetched up her keys and dialled a number she hadn’t called in quite a while. It rang a few times and she wondered if she’d caught him away from his station.
If anyone who had known John Watson before 21 November 2011 had seen him the following year, they wouldn’t have recognised him in passing. He spent months in mourning, cutting off contact with just about everyone he had ever been friends with. Phone calls, text messages, and emails went unanswered, house-calls were greeted with blank stares, monosyllabic sentences (when he felt like talking at all), the occasional broken teacup (which he always replaced later either in kind or setting aside the monetary funds to replace it), and eventually, locked doors. The most he ever said to anyone was to Mycroft Holmes, three days before he disappeared. He visited Mycroft in his office at The Diogenes Club, which was as much a surprise to Holmes as it was to anyone else due to the fact that before he showed up at the private club, he hadn’t been seen in a week.
“Good luck to you. Got word a minute ago from Anthea that arrangements have been made at the flat to accommodate our temporary flat-mates.”
.” Jim said in a matter-of-fact tone that annoyed him so much, “That’s the point of this.” They looked over the side and saw that someone had stopped at the benches near the bus stop below them, and several other people were in the vicinity.
Trouble comes to Baker Street, but they're not unprepared. Sherlock may go quietly, but he's not playing by anyone's rules but his own this time.
“Of course! Just a little something sweet to keep you two going strong! Have a lovely day, you two!” Mrs. Hudson went back into the house with a jaunty wave.
As she kicked off her boots and dumped her gear in the Baker Street sitting-room when they got back to Baker Street after dinner, she fired off a text to Greg to let him know she wouldn't be home tonight.
“Please...don’t,” Sherlock whined, reaching for the hand clenching against the back of his neck. “I’m sorry!”
“Well, I’m game for kissing, you’re rather good at that. Then perhaps we’ll see where it goes from there, shall we?”
“Možete nam verovati, znaš.” The blond murmured. Judith was glad their car was empty and the only person in danger was the man sitting between them.
“Met Police, is anyone here?!” She called out warily, listening for any sound that didn’t belong. She heard some rattling by one of the trailers, but it wasn’t unusual for stray animals to get into the sites and take shelter under stacks of equipment. She thought she heard something inside, saw a light, but when she approached, a wary hiss had her stopping in her tracks. Judith froze, focusing her torch on the space beneath the trailer next door. Getting down on her knees, she shone the light there and saw shiny pin-points of light. A shape moved across the beam and she heaved a short sigh of something like relief.
When he reached his ultimate destination in Spanish Town, he thanked the cabbie, asked him to wait, and rushed into the little, nondescript store. A kind old man named Magnus owned the place, and Greg almost cried with relief when he got a look at the wares. “Oh, this is
“Go ahead.” A mark was placed on the list and he ducked the velvet rope. The first thing he did was run upstairs to the first floor, where he stopped by the bar and got drinks. Hennessey for himself, Connemara for John. As soon as he had the drinks, he headed for the balcony where he’d last seen John. From a distance was one thing, up close was…breathtaking. In fact, he stopped dead in his tracks in the doorway and stared. Oh. My god. Sherlock stared for what felt like several minutes, committing every detail of this to memory for the rest of his miserable days. There was something about the way the lights of the club, and the street outside, caught on John’s hair, the lines of his face, reflecting in his eyes like stars in a clear night sky.
“We will. Thank you, Lestrade.” Sherlock tugged on the collar of his coat and looked up at the sky. “If my brother asks, you can tell him.”
“I told you why I don’t go all the way.” She looked over her shoulder, “I like dictating my own hours and it lets me keep eyes on the boys when they need it.”
“I’ve been called worse.” Donovan shrugged, “Thanks for helping out, though. You’re pretty good with a take-down.”
“You have a problem, Inspector.” Sherlock looked up. Between them, they had picked apart the scene, time and cause of death of the victim, and Sherlock had figured out that he had been dumped downstream of where they’d found him and been moved by the currents.
“I’ll let you know if she wakes up.” Sherlock smiled as he waved them off. “Did you guide her back, Stephen?”
Several hours later, after a thoroughly enjoyable evening with a few carefully-chosen friends, Mycroft was happy to offer the Watsons a ride home, wherever they happened to be staying tonight. Sherlock politely turned down the same offer, opting to take a cab back to Baker Street, and Donovan had a squad-car to return. Lestrade had
“I think he wanted me to take a look? Can I go in?” He flashed the woman an insincere smile, and turned to see where Judith had gone off to, “Coming, Doctor Watson?”
to notice things about people, and as Moran knows, a lapse of concentration can spell disaster. Not that such a thing was ever my problem.”
“Well, it’s not four-star, or even two, but I’ve got an extra bed at mine if you need a place to crash for one night.” The silver-haired detective leant against his car, folding his arms against the roof, a charming, inviting smile lighting up his eyes, “If you’re interested?” Judith worried her bottom lip, weighing her options. It wasn’t a question, actually. She folded her arms across her chest and cocked an eyebrow.
“Grand idea.” Judith’s smiled was wired and satisfied. Neither of their phones had rang even once while they were out, which he supposed was a blessing in disguise. He really, really wanted a day off. As they finally got back to the house and Judith was getting the door open, since Greg’s hands were full, her phone rang.
“That explains your unusual eye-colour, at least.” He said quietly, exploring the raised lines of the scar. The angle and location of the wound indicated a precision shot, which pointed to the likelihood of a sniper, which made his survival and return home even more incredible. Sherlock could feel where the gnarled tissue gave way to smoother lines, the careful cuts of a scalpel, where the diseased and scarred tissue had been removed. John caught his hand and Sherlock paused. The Sìth soldier didn’t need to say a word, it was obvious he was as much in want of a hot shower as Sherlock was, and Sherlock was willing to give him anything he could ask for. Anything. Everything. He just...had to ask first.
“Only if you call me Judith. None of this Constable Watson or Colonel Watson, or any of that noise.”
“You’ve been with the Army for almost thirteen years, having forgone traditional university to enlist, which was due to a number of circumstances, eventually deciding to go to medical school in order to have a serviceable talent after you left the military.” Will flicked ash from the end of his cigarette and looked at her, “Have I forgotten anything?”
“It may take one more victim to catch him, but his reign ends here shortly.” Mycroft was dead serious. Judith sipped her tea and knew she would keep her eye out for the cab over the next few days.
“Not much. John had a PTSD nightmare around three that had all of us up. After we got him back to stable, we ran a four-and-a-half mile loop around Regent’s Park.”
“Eh, the lads are used to seeing me like this.” He shrugged and turned, hopping off the retaining wall.
“No worries, Mr Moriarty. Standard to ask.” John shrugged it off, but there was something about this that bothered him. After taking their order for appetizers and entrees, John went to enter it into the computer and tried to convince himself that it was none of his business. While he waited for the order to go through and process, he looked after his other tables and sent notice to the bussers for the tables that had paid and left. One table had stiffed him on the tip, not that he was too surprised, but another table’s gratuity more than made up for it. Quo Vadis didn’t add a service-charge to their bills, so any tips earned went to the servers, and it was basically treated as bonus-pay.
“It makes sense.” John nodded, “All but one of the victims has been male. All within a certain age-range and of varied geo-ethnic groups.”
“It’s fine, Mycroft. I think I can handle your little brother.” He just looked out the window and contemplated his future. John wasn’t sure what he would do with his time, but he suspected he would never be quite bored. Especially if any of the Holmes brothers were involved, which they undoubtedly would be, in some way or other.
“Most of my home-life, but that’s alright.” She made a face, “You were right about knowing everything about a person from a single look. How did you do that?” She took a last draw of her cigarette and tossed it onto the gravel.
“Not on our end, they didn’t.” Hutchison smiled and helped them stand. Sherlock looked for the projectile and found a hole in the wall.
“You’re a handsome boy, yeah? Come along, you, I’m a friend.” The sire got slowly to his feet and approached with typical suspicious body-language. John kept food in his pockets for Sherlock, usually sweeties, but he had a bit of salmon jerky in his pocket and he pulled this out to entice the dogs to befriend him more quickly.
After a few hours, Greg came out and called her down from the tape-line. He was going back to Baker Street to coordinate with the boys and see if Sherlock had recovered the missing evidence.
“Mycroft!” Judith said warningly. “That’s enough, both of you! Maybe I solved the case, but that’s not going to matter!”
“Well, my dear, it’s for your own good this time.” His brother chuckled and carried him to the ambulance, setting him down on the gurney before laying the Belstaff over him. Phase-back to human form was brief but painful and once he was sitting upright, Sherlock pulled his coat around him like a blanket. His head was spinning and his mouth had a disgusting metallic taste.
Before Judith could ask what the hell was going on, the Ancient One tapped her on the forehead and she was falling through time, space, and everything in between. She saw entire universes, whole galaxies, billions of people all over the world, all over
“Be careful, Jude! Let us know when you get home!” Sherlock called as she went down the stairs, shrugging into her coat.
“Thank you so much, Mrs Hudson.” John smiled at the kind woman who, despite not having a drop of magic in her own blood, had never judged or troubled Sherlock for his. And was ready to open her home and her affections to John as well if he sought either of those things. Sherlock kissed Mrs Hudson on the cheek and thanked her for being so understanding, and so supportive.
They snuck upstairs, stepping over the creaky steps to avoid making any undue noise to get Hope’s attention and alert him to anyone else in the aforeto secured flat. The flat-door was locked, of course, but the kitchen entrance was not, and she carefully pushed that door open. The sliding doors that closed the kitchen off from the sitting-room were partly closed and the lights were off, but they were used to operating in less than ideal conditions. Moving in silence, they took up positions to either side of the gap that allowed them a view of the sitting-room. Their radios were silenced, their phones on vibrate. But most importantly, they could see Sherlock and Hope.
“You burned quite a few calories earlier, you need to refuel.” He said as he set into his own breakfast, glancing over the papers. Sherlock grumbled but obeyed, John did not miss how he ate every single thing on his plate. So much for being not hungry. He smiled but said nothing.
As it turned out, John was waiting no more than thirty minutes before he spotted a familiar figure in the crowds. Of course, it
“Y-yeah, I’m fine.” She looked down at him and helped him with the vest, fingers shaking. Once they had unfastened the vest, Greg jumped up and went around behind Judith, starting to pull off the jacket and the bomb vest as one piece. There was something off about this, but adrenaline wouldn't let him think rationally until she was out of that damn bomb-vest.
“I didn’t. I’m not an idiot, Sherlock, you don’t have to treat me like one.” John raised his head, “But I did forgive you.”
“Ma’am.” His brother dropped a deep and proper bow to the exiled  Summer Queen and took his leave quietly. The bodyguards withdrew as well. As the door closed, John finally just…Sherlock wasn’t sure how to classify the sound. It was something deep and gut-wrenching, pulled from some untouched depth of emotion locked away for so long. It almost sounded like a mournful howl.
She hung up on him first and pocketed her phone while she tried to work out a detour that would get her past the huffy forensics specialist who seemed to have a personal grudge against her. More people in The Met
“Oh, this ought to be a good one for the media.” Greg coughed. He didn’t stay long at the hospital, there was plenty of work to do back at The Yard. He took Judith and Sally back to the office, and if
“No, no! It’s…fine.” He exhaled slowly. God, he was gorgeous! John blinked and remembered himself. “You’ve not been here before, I take it?”
They ended up digging a safe from the wreckage, inside which they found a pink mobile-phone that was reminiscent of the phone from The Study in Pink. This led to a chain of clues and victims strung along the city by a clever anonymous bomber, who was playing a deadly game with Sherlock. Judith remembered her encounter with Moran and Moriarty. Oh Jesus, this was the game he’d warned her about!
“Thank you, sir.” She took the coffee and sniffed, “Ooh, mochaccino! I haven’t had a good one of these in ages!”
“Ignore the boys, they mean well. It’s not often I flirt with outsiders, most of my targets wear a uniform.”
“Yeah, it’s alright. Don’t worry about me.” He wondered if his expression gave away the pain and heartbreak he was feeling.
“Thank you, sir.” It was a quiet drive back to Risby, and John got them heading back to London once they got the all-clear from the units on the ground. They got back half an hour before the caravan from Risby, and they took the chance to return to Baker Street, take a shower, and make themselves presentable. Greg came and picked them up, driving them down to Lambeth at the head of the Risby caravan.
“Never leave without it. My reputation stands and most people aren’t stupid enough to take on a veteran anyway, never mind the fallen Doctor Watson.” John wrinkled his nose, “We’ll have to come up with something, Sherlock, now that we’re back in Baker Street. I can’t work as a doctor anymore.”
“Thanks, Johnny Boy, you’re a gem!” Moriarty just wiggled his fingers and dismissed John like a disobedient pet or petulant child. Reminding himself that killing patrons was a surefire way to lose your job and did
*  For anyone who's ever visited a firing-range and fired a gun, especially a rifle, you know EXACTLY what this feels like. It's not exactly a fun experience. For the uninitiated or gun-leery, getting hit with hot brass is very different than being shot, it's what happens when a discharged shell-casing hits someone in the vicinity of the fired weapon. Hot metal touches your skin, either unprotected or otherwise, and you just KNOW you got hit. I've gotten hit by brass once or twice, not very pleasant.
“So, who’s our subdued mister, then?” Greg asked, glancing at the other car for a minute as he flipped his notebook open.
“Oh, god.”Judith snorted, laughing at the absurdity of the whole mess, and leaned forward as she prepared to stand up again. Her legs wouldn't work, and she groaned.
“I’m so sorry, John.” He sighed and leaned against the railing, glass in one hand, cigarette in the other, looking out on the bustling street below. The music thrummed in his bones, in his ears, but it wasn’t as loud as he’d thought it should be.
-creepy, non-coworker boyfriend.” Judith couldn’t help herself. It took a minute for it to hit Donovan who she was talking about, and half that time for the laughter to start. Donovan actually had to pull the car over before they wrecked, which made them a little late to the crime-scene. It was so bad they were late enough to show up after Sherlock Holmes!
this nervous about asking Claudia to marry him and realized that Claudia hadn’t made him as happy. Seeing Judith just…it made him happy. Even in the middle of a gruesome crime scene, she made his heart jump. Seeing her in the office, if it was busy with paper-work or on her way to get somewhere, he loved to watch her. Thinking about her made him smile, made him blush, the idea of being able to go home at awful hours and she would be there, no matter how bad it had been that day, was a relief. She knew his struggles, she endured them right alongside him. And he knew she felt just the same as he did, for all the times he caught her watching him at a scene, or spent time watching
“No. I’m the only one who knows you left London.” John smiled, “I’ll stick around, Sherlock doesn’t need me and I’m not scheduled at the clinic.”
“Hey, it’s me. Yeah, I’m alright. Listen, I just wanted to call and let you know ... ” he paused and looked over his shoulder at something John couldn’t see from here. “No, no, I’m fine. Yes, I promise. I just wanted to let you know I’m going to be home late tonight, so ... don’t wait up for me. No, I know I promised, I’m so sorry, love, but I have a couple of drunks to book in and reports to file before I get to come home. I know I have better things to do, but try telling my bosses that. And no, that was
“John and I think it was, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Sherlock says the same.” She looked around, “I am so sorry about all of this, I really wish I wasn’t…well, I’m not telling you anything you didn’t know already, but…you’re my family. I hate giving bad news like this.” Gerald’s father-in-law, who lived next-door in Unit 31, came over and hugged her tight before ushering her to a seat on the crowded couch.
She swung around towards the source of the sound and saw someone standing behind them. Raising her gun again, she took very careful aim. She didn’t want to kill this one. She knew she’d made the shot, she heard him cry out. But he was gone in a flash.
“It was on your dashboard, you must have left it there. Oh, no, no, Queenie, that’s not good.” He smiled and pocketed her notebook before coming around to lift the cat off of her legs. At some point, the friendly Maine Coon had decided to involve herself. “Don’t do that, darling. You must be gorgeous when you’re all cleaned up right, yeah?”
“I’ll say you did just dandy, Private.” Judith broke open a pill-packet of anti-emetics and put two pills in his hand, “Take those with water and get your breath back. I’ll have a word with your boss about this, alright?”
“Please be careful, Captain. Please come back.” He sighed softly when she let him go, “You need to do that again.”
“Philip Anderson, John Watson. Doctor Watson is my consultant and my informant, Anderson. Be nice to him.”
The group of people presenting for swearing-in was fairly small, and everything from fellow SCs making the move to PC, PCs making the move to other divisions, and others changing ranks entirely. Constables making Sergeant, Sergeants making Inspector, and so on. Judith found a place to sit and kicked her heels under the chair, wondering that she had only been working for The Met for the equivalent of four months and she was getting this boost. She hadn’t asked for it and could see it causing some problems among her peers for apparent outside favouritism.
Two voices were in perfect unison. She sighed and looked at her watch. She had to be at the Swearing Room by noon, it was half eleven.
“Stole this. Probably from somebody back at the Tesco.” The constable held out a wallet to him. He took it and looked through it for an ID of some kind. He found it in the proper slot and paused. The face staring back at him from the driver license was as familiar to him as his own and he swore his heart skipped. No. There was no way. It couldn’t be. Sherlock was
“I need the cameras out of Soho.” She leant over the back of Q’s chair, “And pull all of them, I can’t risk missing this guy because I forgot a camera.”
“One of the most dangerous men in London and absolutely no one you need to worry about.” He rocked on his heels, “I can take care of myself, Inspector, don’t let my looks fool you.”
“Of course, sir.” The driver gave them a smile and closed the door once John was in. It was quiet, but not uncomfortably so. Mycroft was not in the car, but that didn’t mean much. He could be anywhere in London, either at home or at one of his offices. It didn’t matter either way to John and less than that to Sherlock.
“Well, in the interest of keeping my head where it belongs, I’ll stay out of that business.” Stamford looked a bit flabbergasted. “I … uh, don’t suppose you’d be interested in something low-key and boring like research, would you?” Ah,
As she brushed her hands off on her trousers, Judith saw a flicker of motion at the door and looked up to see Sherlock. He poked his head around the doorjamb and when he saw her guarding Roberts, he waved her up. She looked at Roberts. He just looked up at her and offered a shaky salute. She nodded and headed for the room, ignoring Donovan again as she ducked the tape and followed Sherlock into the hotel room. He directed her into the bathroom and she could definitely see why Roberts had lost his nerve.
“I’d go looking at family first, focus on siblings or parents if either is surviving, maybe even grandparents. It might have been a partner, as well.”
He felt Sherlock hook his chin over his shoulder and leaned back a bit. Sherlock stood behind him, arms around him, grounding him to a much happier present and possible future.
“Thank you so much, Doctor Watson!” The Radcliffes were just beside themselves, “How can we ever thank you enough?”
“I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.” He looked down at the radio lying on the dashboard of the car they were leaning against. That radio hadn’t been there a moment ago. A plan started forming in his head, a risky, potentially fatal plan. But he was as good as dead anyway, right, if Moriarty had his way? What difference did it make if it was now, at the hands of The Met, or later?
I feel like I should put it down somewhere that Judith wasn’t looking for a more involved relationship with Sherlock Holmes, and he wasn’t asking her for one. He was simply taking the necessary steps to ensure that someone he cares about quite a lot is removed from a potentially dangerous situation. Not that Judith can’t handle herself in Afghanistan, but Sherlock wanted the absolute certainty that he would never have to see her name in the papers or on the telly, or see it marked in red on the government ledgers. And besides, fifteen years is plenty long to consider stepping into retirement from military service, she’s kind of earned it!
“It’s fine, Mrs Hudson,” John promised as he finished signing the pet agreement and watched Kitty make herself at home on Sherlock’s lap.
“Be careful.” She murmured as a tipsy couple tumbled into the cab, giggling together. A pair of attractive uni students, both male, just enjoying a night on the town. She recognized them from her patrols and kicked her door open.
“Oh, yes.” John chuckled, shoving his hands into his pockets, “I’m rather familiar with your brother.”
needed something done, and worked without complaint. After an entirely uneventful day, Judith went home with Greg, wondering if they would get a call after-hours.
“We’re absolutely sure it’s a serial-killer?” John folded his arms, rocking back on his heels. The three of them were of the opinion that the suicides plaguing the city were actually the work of a serial killer who was either very lucky, or very clever. They had brought this idea before Greg and Sally, but for the sake of keeping the city calm and not promoting blind panic, they hadn’t made the concept public. Judith had been keeping a closer eye on the streets while on patrol, but it wasn’t until tonight, just an hour ago, that she…oh, Christ. Judith looked the body, flashed back to the cab she had seen earlier. Something must have shown on her face, because the boys looked at each other and John took one step towards her before she turned and ran.
“That’s enough to knock a bull flat, you moron!” she hissed, knowing they wouldn’t hear her. Jim laid the goon out for the trouble, and Judith chuckled. She returned to her physical body as Jim entered the supply-closet, coming out of that foggy unconsciousness with a violent, full-body jerk.
“I usually remember faces, and he does look a bit familiar. I doubt he remembers me, though. I’m quite a bit younger than he is.”
“Not today. These are the same people that tore you to shreds three years ago and killed my reputation, I don’t want to come across as “friendly” today.” John flicked a piece of lint from his smock and brushed off the buckle of the stable-belt secured at his waist. For the occasion of showing themselves to the world publicly for the first time in three years, John had found a new, properly fitted and starched Temperate Combat Dress uniform hanging in his closet and suspected he should be grateful Mycroft hadn’t insisted on a dress-uniform. He hadn’t worn a uniform for much since leaving the Army, maybe a couple of cases when they got themselves involved with a military case and it was prudent to blend or on special occasions, but it felt a bit strange just at the moment.
“Don’t go anywhere without it, son.” She kicked her door open and ran around to the back of the Rover, pulling open the boot and pulling out two boxes full of cold-case files for Sherlock.
“Just keeping eyes on Baker Street. Part of an arrangement with the landlady and her tenants. Even when they’re home, if I’m anywhere nearby, I always do a pass-by and if I can, I’ll sit on the flat. More for Mrs. Hudson’s sake.” She knew if they waited long enough, maybe five minutes, Mrs. Hudson would come out with something for them.
, anyway. So, ever the dutiful if not ever so slightly more desperate, husband, John had agreed. He wasn’t stupid, he knew his marriage was on the rocks. But he felt…trapped. It wasn’t Rosie’s fault, she was an angel, the sweetest little girl. It was what John had gotten himself into and turned his back on when he decided it was a good idea to marry Mary Morstan and stay married to her. He had done it to save himself, and Rosie, because he knew that if he left them, Rosie would suffer. And despite having no blood between them whatsoever, John loved the little girl. He knew for a fact, thanks to a friend of his who worked at Bart’s, that the baby wasn’t his. It was a blessing, a relief, actually.
“Oh. Well, I don’t know what we can possibly tell you, but you might as well come in.” She invited them into the house and closed the door behind them, “I’m sorry that Roger and Anita aren’t here.”
“This is my second stop.” She hugged the sweet-natured physician, “It’s good to see you again, Christine. You still need to visit London.”
“Looks like it.” Greg pointed to the body sitting just above the tide-line, “Go take a look, tell me what you think.”
“Yes, we did. And if they try to interrupt us, they’ll be very sorry for the trouble.” John leaned down and kissed Sherlock on the forehead. He knew he wasn’t the lad’s first, but certainly his first in a long while. But he had to admit that Sherlock was certainly one of his best. When Sherlock had relaxed and taken him completely, he gave him time to adjust.
“Thank you, Bryan.” Mycroft dismissed their server and it was quiet between them. But John didn’t feel like talking just at the moment and he knew Mycroft wouldn’t push. What had started out as a rather depressing evening had turned out pretty alright. He could have done without being arrested, but that was all his fault for getting into a brawl in the first place. Although to be fair, he hadn’t done anything except bump into someone else on accident because another patron hadn’t been paying attention.
“I will always intervene for her. All she has to do is ask.” Sherlock looked up the stairs, “Where are we?”
“Only way anything gets done around here.” John looked out the window of the cab, “Greg, we’re going back to Baker Street, call or come for us when you know something.”
“Of course, dear.” She stirred up the flames in the fireplace until a healthy blaze was going to warm the place up a bit.
“Not in practice, not anymore. I was never that interested, but my brother refused to suffer alone, so we went in together.”
“Of course, yes.” A faint waiver, a sharp inhale, “Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.” Sherlock leant in until he could almost see himself reflected in John’s eyes, certainly in his glasses, and smirked.
“Close enough! I just about died when I figured out who he actually was, a bit embarrassing for both of us.” Greg smiled, “But we talked it out civil-like, and we’ve been close friends ever since. I look after Sherlock when he can’t.”
– prepared to do anything; prepared to burn; prepared to do what ordinary people won’t do.” He leaned in, getting into Jim’s personal space in a way he knew would make the other man uncomfortable, “You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.”
“Jennifer Wilson. She’s with Western Mail & South Wales Echo.” Judith caught her breath, “Found her down in Brixton.”
“Don’t let him hurt anyone else.” She murmured, nuzzling under Moran’s collar, “Please don’t let him hurt anyone else.”
“I always do.” He flashed a dashing smile at them and disappeared around the corner at a run. Judith shared an eye-roll with Sally and headed off to manage the top of the street. She called in two of the Constables on-site and spent the rest of the night working the Lauriston Gardens scene.
“Well, that’s very kind of him.” Sherlock just raised an eyebrow as John turned again so they were back to chest.
“Mmm. You’ve a point there. Well, nothing for it! Onward!” It was a blessedly short, uninterrupted jaunt to the black door of 221B Baker Street, and John knocked first, just as he had all those years ago the first time they’d decided to take rooms together in the cluttered little flat that had become home to both of them in ways neither had expected. They had to knock twice before the door opened from inside, just enough to let their long-suffering landlady peek out.
“I’m not asking for mercy. Do whatever you need to.” Hope looked at her steadily. “You have to do your jobs, I won’t stop you.”
“Come along, I’m a friend.” Smelling the jerky, and probably figuring out that John was a dog-lover, the sire came up to him and sniffed.
“Found work for me. Well, us.” He got up, pocketing his phone and went to fetch his coat. “I don’t suppose you’d like to come along, would you?”
Greg caught her on the first-floor landing and dragged her to a halt. She didn’t get a chance to ask him what he was doing, because he went ahead and did it. It was a good thing her back was to the wall, but that didn’t stop her from grabbing the front of his NATO jumper. Subtle touches while out in public and cuddling at home was pretty much the order of the day, but they’d never gone further in kissing than innocent kisses on the cheek or forehead before bed or in the morning. Greg pinned her to the wall with one knee between her legs, and one hand on her shoulder. The other was free to touch.
is how you kiss a bloke.” He said, breath harsh against soft, shapely lips. He dropped back on his heels and smiled at Sherlock. “Now, off you pop!
When Judith Watson disappeared with a few of the dancers, Greg Lestrade knew something was up. She’d said that this wasn’t her first visit to Maroush, and he believed her, but the way she was comfortable with the dancers spoke of some different familiarity. He liked Watson, he really did, more than he probably should He knew if Sherlock ever found out just how much, he would never hear the end of it. It wasn’t like today was the first time they’d met, anyway, so he was allowed a bit of fancy. He wondered if Judith remembered, he certainly did. It had been years ago, they had both been a bit younger then than now, but he had made himself a promise to remember the fiesty medic he had met on a deployment to Canada, and again in Afghanistan. Judith Watson had saved his life in Afghanistan three years ago, he wondered if she remembered that. He had been Army Reserves for most of his career with The Met, at the mercy of the needs of the military, and had left for a two-year stint in the Middle East. That had been their second deployment together, and his last.
two years ago after Serbia, why hadn’t he told anyone else? Why hadn’t he said something at the beginning? Well, that was easy. If he was any sort of agent worth his number, he knew the value of keeping his mouth shut about certain things. So, even under great duress and threat of death, he would never, ever admit to anyone that he knew Sherlock Holmes was alive.
“So much for a boring night.” He murmured, coming up behind the man with a gun pointed at Sherlock Holmes unnoticed by either man.
“Couple thousand miles from here.” She wondered if she could take Greg to visit Kamar-Taj some day. “You believe in magic?”
Greg raised his head and looked at her, even in the dark she could see the tears on his face. Oh, this was bad alright. Judith sighed and knelt between his legs, nudging his knees apart to give her some room, and took his hands in hers.
“Too late!” Sherlock muttered. They all looked to the top of the Hollow where the Hound stalked them, eyes glowing red, teeth bared in a sinister snarl. Judith stood back-to-back with Greg, she did not miss the slight jump when they touched. She reached down and patted him on the hip.
“Where are we going?” She asked, knowing it was fifty-fifty he would actually tell her anything really useful.
“…my hostage.” He said gruffly, taking control again. John gasped. So did the others. Judith, Sally, and Greg shared a puzzled look.
know that someone it didn’t approve of was coming up on their flank. He’d be an idiot in hell if he didn’t think the Watsons hadn’t already seen him. With one hand out as he would approach a stray, frightened dog, Greg came up alongside Strange, running his hand along the fabric of the cloak and smiling as it ruffled and settled calm again, wrapping around his hand for a minute. The damn thing
“Figures.” He just smiled and got in on the passenger’s side. He didn’t have to give Sherlock directions to the house he had shared with Mary.
When Judith heard the sound of gunfire above them, she skidded to a halt and looked up. Grabbing her brother, she pulled him out of the way. They watched, horrified, as both Sherlock
you.” He shrugged and turned around, “Well, I’d better be off. So nice to have had a proper chat.” Running against the clock, Sherlock did something brash. He raised the pistol and took
“And the chances of her jumping into a stranger’s bed are a bit slim anyway.” He sighed, “God help us, Greg, Judith’s run off to Nepal and Sherlock is all moody.”
“Work. Beautiful country, beautiful people when they’re not trying to kill you. And the food is quite good. Just don’t drink the water.”
“Please.” He put his empty cup down and took John’s, turning to the kind Hybrid once his hands were empty. “Stay.”
“Not by a bloody long shot! Try again!” John snorted and rolled his eyes, carefully flicking ash from the end of his cigarette. “You, don’t even think about moving.” This was to Lachey, who grunted and twitched under John’s weight.
“Can I help you, sirs?” She looked out at them suspiciously, and he suspected the house had been staked out by the press for a while. He and Sherlock were no strangers to that.
After The Great Game, Jim Moriarty disappeared and things quieted down in London for a while. But Judith knew the peace couldn't last, so when the London Sanctum was destroyed by rogue Master Kaecilius and his Zealots, she took John and headed for New York. But trouble had come to New York, they found the Sanctum under attack. Daniel Drumm had been killed already by the Zealots, but they weren’t too late to help Stephen Strange defend the Sanctum from the fate of the London Sanctum. When Stephen was wounded, Judith took him to safety and sent John on to Hong Kong to warn Master Wong that Kaecilius and the Zealots were preparing to execute the stolen spell and Hong Kong was next. New York still stood, but having failed to take down one of the three Sanctums, she didn’t think Kaecilius would let Hong Kong stand. She would worry about that later, she had to focus on keeping Stephen alive. For that, she had help from his friend fellow surgeon Christine Palmer.
“No, I let it ring to voicemail.” Sherlock handed John his phone and let him dial into his voicemail to see what Greg had to say.
A few people he encountered on his way exchanged greetings with him, but he had the feeling his impending retirement and dismissal was no secret. So few agents lived long enough to retire that when one of them
“Mr Lachey, if you wouldn’t mind stepping away from my young friend.” He said calmly, that dangerous tone of voice that meant deep trouble. “I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying. I doubt he appreciates your blustering.” Sherlock remembered it from earlier going by the expression on his face, John saw the brief twitch of facial muscles and smirked. Oh, he remembered all right, he’d been the one in trouble the last time John had used that tone of voice.
“That, friend, is Cruella DeVil. She owns a fashion-house in London, a bit of an odd bird.” He ruffled his hair with both hands, “I met her once.”
She sent off a quick reply and looked over her shoulder as Moran and Moriarty debarked from the train behind her. Getting to street-level didn’t take very long and she decided to take Long Lane to West Smithfield. It was the shortest way to get to the hospital from the station, and she was a bit late anyway.
“If you’re talking about Sherlock Holmes, the world is his problem.” Hooper rolled her eyes, “He’s too good at what he does or I wouldn’t keep him around.” John chuckled and studied her carefully.
“He’s scared to death, but he won’t admit it!” She spat, “Whatever he saw out there, whatever thing is out on the moors, he saw it and it scared him! He can’t process it and that
Judith gets a bit more case-work done, and pays a visit to MI-6. She needs resources, they have resources, and she owes the Director a visit anyway. She hasn't seen Q or 007 in a while and figures she can drop by while she's in on business.
?” She shoved and twisted around to find him holding the item in question. “Well, fuck. Where did you find that?”
.” Greg snarled, and Sherlock wasn’t sure if it was coming face-to-face with the man behind the latest string of cases they’d been working on or the fact that he had snatched Judith as his final victim that had them all in such a bad mood.
“Next to you, love, we’re all fools and morons who can’t see the light for having our heads so far up our own arses.” Muffled by the cigarette and the click of the lighter.
“Moran loves Judith, she was one of his best, one of his favorites. No matter if the man responsible for hurting her is his own psychotic boss, no one gets away with putting the Watsons in danger like that.” Sherlock sipped from his own cup, “Your partner’s a rather dangerous woman, Inspector.” Greg snorted. Yeah, he knew that, thanks.
“Just following orders, ma’am.” He grinned weakly as she fished a kit from a pocket, “Remembered what you told me when they shipped me back. “Stay out of trouble and don’t do anything too stupid. Find a foundation that works and build on it.””
“Oh, wait! You’re Judith Watson!” He smiled, “Oh, I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you before! I should have known, you’re the sweet one!” No one who knew more about Judith than her name called her sweet. She could be downright brutal. But the sentiment was not misplaced.
“No, thanks, Johnny. My ride’s here!” Moriarty breezed out of the restaurant. John rushed past him to hold the door of the car, giving Moriarty’s driver a look.
“Answers would be nice, if he wants to give them up.” Greg narrowed his eyes and they watched an unusual and unsettling exchange take place.
“This is Confirmed Bachelor John Watson on the pull, looking for the best potential target to fill an empty, cold bed for a night.” A shrug and another sip of the whiskey, “Like it?”
Judith was aware of spinning as she fell and curled up, making a smaller target. Suddenly, she felt a shift in the air around her and reacted out of pure instinct, putting her hands out. She encountered resistance and pushed through it. Momentum carried her forward and she compensated for it, using all of her extensive training to keep her body upright.
“Your ticket out of this hell.” He folded his hands behind his back, “I’d like you out of here before you get yourself shot.”
“I don’t care if it’s a dummy-vest or not, I don’t want to look at it again.” He pulled her to her feet, “What did they
“Good.” Sherlock disappeared up the stairs, and Judith went back out to the line to wait with Sally. It was quiet outside for a while until Sherlock came tearing out of the house in a rush to get somewhere.
“Well, no offense, but you’ve easily got ten years on me, Captain.” Ahh, there it was! He snickered.
“Well, he’s a Holmes alright,” John said, catching sight of a tall, almost gangly young man inside the room just beyond them, with riotous curly hair and, well, he wasn’t sure what colour his eyes were, he couldn’t tell from here. But even without being in the same room, he knew that this one was definitely a Holmes. And considering how much like Q he looked, this
“You’re looking for Timothy Almond.” Judith spoke up, interrupting the moment, “He goes by the street-name of Timo, usually haunts around the flop-houses in Fulham.”
.” A dismissive gesture at his state of dress and appearance. It was the worst Sherlock had seen John in...well, he wasn’t sure he’d ever seen John this dishevelled.
“Watson.” She smiled, holding out one hand to him, “Lieutenant-Colonel Judith H. Watson. Late of the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers in Afghanistan.” She refrained from mentioning Special Forces. She didn’t fancy scaring him off just yet.
lonely. He tried to remember how long it had been since the last time he’d seen John Watson and just...couldn’t. At least, seen him in a setting where they recognized each other.
“Oh, stop it, you big baby.” Sherlock returned to tending John’s wounds, “But if I’m coughing up hairballs for the next two weeks after this, I hold you responsible.”
intruding, John.” Sherlock waved a lazy hand, flicking water and soap-suds everywhere. “You obviously came with something in mind and I seem to have distracted you.” Those strange lapis eyes fixed on him as Sherlock turned to look at him properly, a slow, lazy turn of his head that looked almost too fluid to be natural. Distracted was putting it mildly! John was more than distracted, and it was mortifying!
After a shower and a nap, she got dressed in comfy clothes and set out for Maroush. Judith walked from the house up to Earls Court Road, where she hailed a taxi to the restaurant. It was half-seven when she got there, and she headed straight for the back area. Riyah and the girls were already there and getting ready, and when Judith showed up, were quick to pull her in.
of people, but their income was being supplemented by the kindness of Mycroft Holmes. It wasn’t much, but more than he thought they deserved. On top of
“I’m looking for my notebook! I know who did this!” She had gotten under the passenger seat and knew she probably looked absolutely ridiculous, “Where
“We’ve got a problem.” She muttered, clearing the remaining stairs and barging through the door. “She left a note, Sherlock! A warning or a message, I haven’t figured it out!”
“Says the girl who pinned my ex-wife to my desk nearly six months ago and helped my sergeant put her in handcuffs.” He said gruffly. Judith bit her lip so she wouldn't laugh.
It was nearly Christmas before they got word that Morstan had been neutralized. They had no leads on the dognapping case, but they
“Oh. No, no, I’m fine. I was just ... trying to wake myself up a bit more.” John tried not to stare, really he did. The main bathroom suite was a full outfit with a double-sink, toilet, free-standing claw-foot bathtub, and separate shower stall. At the moment, the bathtub was occupied, and wakefulness was the least of John’s troubles this morning. Sherlock was sitting in the tub, water just to his chest, a bit of a snug fit because he was so bloody tall, and ... he was wearing a shower cap.
steal the puppies! This is why!” She pulled a drawing from the file and thrust it at them. Displayed was a gorgeous spotted coat.
“On several accounts! Oh, John!” He closed the distance between himself and the brave Sìth soldier. “This is a terrible scar! Quicksilver doesn’t do this to you unless…”
“Bye, Mike.” John looked at his puzzled friend, who had witnessed the whole bizarre experience. “Thanks for everything.”
“Oh, that’s the unlucky constable who gets to follow me around today. Name’s Rick Marcus.” She checked her radio, “Young kid, but smart.”
“My trusted partner on the outside.” She took a deep breath, “You’re not my brother, or his boyfriend, you’re not my fiancé, you’re…something completely different.”
“Yeah.” John huffed, “Apparently it’s against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent.” Not that he seemed terribly sorry for trying. Sherlock snickered. Good old John, standing up for Sherlock’s honour.
“Does he, though?” Greg raised an eyebrow in challenge. John couldn’t imagine they were hiring completely incompetent people, but something told him that Anderson, whoever that was, wasn’t among the best of them.
“We’re good.” Judith watched as Sherlock circled the flat like a wolf circling its den, “I think Richard Brook is exactly who he says he is, and Jim Moriarty’s a fucking madman to put someone at risk like that.”
“Well, I’m no detective, and I’m better at killing people than I am at telling you what actually killed them, but I know a few things.” John looked out the window.
friend, brother, voice of conscience, voice of reason, conductor of light, blogger, crack-shot. John Watson had been so many things, so many important things, at different times as called upon to be.
“You’re not the best at The Met for no reason.” Bond circled her, he always did when they hadn’t seen each other in a bit longer than either would have liked, “If anyone can solve this, it will be you. Why haven’t you applied for a full position yet?”
“Mmhmm. Kind of surprises people when they figure it out that a nobody like Judith Watson knows someone so important.” She chuckled, shaking her head as she blew a stream of smoke, “I am sorry about earlier, though.”
“That’s what you get for working six cases all week and sleeping four hours between them!” John caught her by the arm as she staggered, “Christ, Judith!”
“You haven’t met me, have you? I can charm the socks off anyone I set my sights on, pull anyone I want, but I don’t have friends.” Judith shrugged, “I’m cute and charming until you piss me off, then you’d better run for the hills.”
trip.” Strange grinned, “You’re a good one, Lestrade. Holmes and the Watsons are lucky to have you.”
“Harry and me didn’t get on, never really did,” John said without looking at the young detective next to him. “Clara and Harry split up in 2009 and got a divorce in 2010; and Harry was a drinker.”
It wasn’t long before they were heading for the last known location of Cruella DeVil. Upon reaching the abandoned barn, they got out of the car and watched as DeVil was hauled out of the muck of a pig-pen and hustled into the waiting prisoner-transport van.
“Shh.” John poked him in the ribs, “Wouldn’t have stuck around and risked my neck for you all those times if you weren’t.”
The next morning, they ate breakfast together and parted ways with John and Sherlock, who had a bit of an argument about something that had happened at Baskerville while she had been in New York with Stephen and Christine. Time to put this bit of madness behind them and move on to resuming a
“Computer error, Major.” John had a notebook out and was writing in it, dead calm and very serious about the whole mess, “It’ll all have to go in the report.”
“Oh Christ, I hate that woman.” Judith groaned and leaned her head forward until it bumped into his chest, “Did she leave you
Some careful asking got Sherlock to start talking about cases he’d been solving anonymously and in no time it was just like the old days, when they would work out clues together. Sherlock did all of the talking, John occasionally gave up suggestions that ultimately led to the proper conclusion, and Sherlock praised him for being intelligent. Well,
“Tell me I returned the coat of a Winter Prince and I won’t believe you.” John folded his arms across his chest.
“I know, I know. It’s awful.” He grabbed his laptop and sat down on the couch with Sherlock, browsing news-sites for any information on the case he was calling A Spot of Mystery in his head. There wasn’t much, maybe a couple of second-page spreads, a few ads placed in the wanted columns. They spent the rest of the day working on the dognapping case.
“Yes, I do.” Greg stepped past him, clearly brushing him aside. “Besides, I know you don’t mind Sherlock nearly as much as you used to.”
“Huh? Oh! That!” He strolled past Judith and reached out for the stick, grinning. “The missile plans!” He took the stick from Sherlock’s fingers and held it up, looking at it. Behind him, Judith was murmuring to herself, perhaps trying to keep herself focused, perhaps winding herself up to take action.
“Where’s Mum?” Rosie asked as she latched on to Sherlock, who wasted no time at all picking her up. “She didn’t try to hurt you again, did she?”
“I think I can manage. You’re charming company, my dear constable, perhaps we can be friends of a sort?”
of their two layover stops. She slept through the stop they made in Madrid to refuel, and most of the overseas flight from Madrid to Miami. They watched the sunrise in Miami, and ate breakfast in San Juan, catching a chopper-flight from San Juan to their final destination.
“Our parents have Rosie, they’ve offered to get her out of the house before the cops arrive.” Ford hung up his own phone call, “She knows something isn’t right. She’s asking where you are.”
“I wish I believed you, Hutch. Wish I believed you.” John sighed and covered his face for a minute. A hand on his arm got his attention and he looked up to see Hutchison holding something out to him. It was a photograph. He took it and studied it.
“We will, Mrs Hudson. Thank you for everything.” He smiled and took Sherlock’s hand, heading for the waiting car that would take them...wherever they were going until further notice. His brother’s driver held the door for them and closed it once they were in. Sherlock knew better than to ask where they were going, he would find out soon enough.
public, and we figure out what in black hell’s name we’re going to do about Richard Brook.” Judith took his free hand, the cloak was getting very touchy on the other side. “And you have a new friend.”
“Who’d be a fan of Sherlock ’olmes?” The cabbie leaned across the table, “You’re not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There’s others out there just like you, except you’re just a man...and they’re so much more than that.”
, arrangements were made to continue paying Sherlock’s part of the rent at Baker Street so that John could keep living there if he wanted to.
“A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.” Sherlock retrieved keys from a pocket and got the door open, “I was able to help out.”
“It’s such a common name is all. I know approximately twelve other people named William. I’m not fond of the name.”
As soon as it was only the three of them in their train-car, and they were underway again, she waited for answers. The dark-haired business-man, if that’s what he was, just smiled at her. It was an alarmingly friendly smile, very pleasant and open.
Judith walked into her grandmother’s office with little to no warning that she was coming, but didn’t care. She was one of a small handful of people who could actually get away with showing up unannounced. Her brother and the Holmes boys were the others, aside from Bond, making it a very small, exclusive group who could safely risk their necks to knock on her door outside of appointment times.
“I can only imagine.” He shuddered, remembering his transition back into civilian-life, not made any easier by his wife. Judith and John exchanged a look and an entire conversation took place without a word being said. He was used to it from the Holmes brothers, and had the feeling this was something to take care with.
“Jesus, Watson.” Greg rolled his eyes and peeked around John to Sherlock, who still sat on the wet sand, “What about
“You don’t seem all that bad.” He told her. “In fact, you’re rather…I find you rather honourable. You’re approachable. But then again, ain’t that your job?” An interesting answer, but she
“Yeah. You’ve been a bit out of it, love. You okay?” Greg pulled her onto her back and looked at her, “You zoned a bit.”
“I’m so sorry, John.” Sherlock did a risky thing and hugged John. It seemed the proper thing to do, and it was not a gesture rebuked. John shook and his head dropped to Sherlock’s shoulder. But that wasn’t enough. Adjusting his angle, Sherlock got John settled with his head against his chest and one hand on the back of his mate’s neck and the other arm wrapped around his shoulders. Lestrade stood guard for them, a couple of nearby personnel crept closer but still kept a respectful distance. There was some whispering, concerned looks, and he saw one of the constables take off at a run.
“Nope.” Sherlock just beamed at him as he stepped out of the house, wrapping on his scarf. He had already shrugged into his coat, a new one John had bought for him last Christmas. He still had his Belstaff Milford, the original long wool coat that he had worn absolutely
rarely in public like this, but if there was one thing Sherlock Holmes was good at, it was kissing. It definitely got the message across loud and clear, though, if Anderson’s expression was anything to judge by.
were familiar with the soldier-in-distress signal, but seeing it from Judith was heartbreaking. And there was absolutely
“Shoot the bastard, Sherlock!” Greg hissed behind him, “Or I will!” Jim disappeared from view and the door closed again with a loud bang.
“Mmhm.” Magnus smiled, “She’s not gonna be your first, though, is she?” He had noticed the faded band of pale skin on Greg’s left ring-finger.
“And on your first day back you’ve already solved one grisly murder with intent to solve more in the future.” Lestrade chuckled and put one hand on her shoulder, “Come on, Colonel, let’s get off our feet and take a breather.”
He was fast in the shower, getting dressed in casual khaki slacks and a white short-sleeved button-down. As he buttoned up his shirt, his phone rang. It was a text-message, thankfully. From Sherlock.
“Not usually, not any time I’ve run by here except maybe once.” Greg looked up and down the street, “Why do you ask?”
“My step-family has always been so good to me. And of course the brothers are there for me, I think I owe my retirement to Mycroft. And my grandmother…oh, god, I was supposed to visit her today.”
“Of course, sir, I’ll see him off safely.” John nodded and looked across the car at Moriarty’s driver. “Evening, Moran.”
“I’m a soldier, Greg, unquestioned self-sacrifice is part of my job.” She murmured. “I’m glad no-one saw that.”
“But...it’s not a regular coat.” He was afraid something might have happened to it in the process of cleaning it, not that he wasn’t grateful.
“Stop that, will you?” He grunted as the pinned suspect bucked, trying to throw him, “You’re not going to get very far, y’know.”
A little bit of a sweet interlude for Judith and Greg! I wasn't planning on any of the fluff happening in this chapter any more than Greg planned on, well...you'll see what he's got in store for Judith!
“Perhaps, if you asked, Doctor Stamford would introduce you to their lead pathologist. Charming, gifted young woman, came over from the Medical Examiner’s Office several years ago, quite good at her job.”
“You have as much right to be there as I do, Sherlock.” He reached out and trailed the fingers of one hand along the lapel of Sherlock’s coat, “Not to mention, you’re quite dressed to go out.”
“Is that concern I hear in your voice, Mr Holmes?” She grinned as she broke the seal and pulled out several pages. “Ah, that’s why I didn’t recognise the handwriting, it’s a secretary.” Judith skimmed the letter, probably dictated to a secretary or written by the author on a computer, and raised an eyebrow. She couldn’t dare to show much more emotion than that. Not that the man on the other side of her desk didn’t know every one of her tells and couldn’t read her like an open book.
“You wouldn’t outgrow these alterations even if you gained an extra five pounds past what you weighed in 2011.”
“It might be the only thing that is.” She looked at him, “It’s Sherlock. I need … to save his life.”
“Nope, but she’s definitely going to be my only.” He studied a very simple ring, a band of silver engraved with the Claddagh symbol and simple Celtic knotwork. Judith was a very practical woman, and not at
“After you, Captain.” Sherlock just gave him a soft smile and held out one hand in invitation. John wasted no time tossing aside his towel and kneeling on the mattress of the massive King bed Sherlock had. Plenty of room to spare, that was nice. No danger of falling off the bed during sex or sleep. Sherlock sat up and they sat quietly, studying each other for a moment. John wasn’t ashamed of any of his scars, though he did have quite a few of them from his service with the Army and then with MI6. Sherlock had some scars of his own from who knew what, cases and experiments gone awry if he had to guess, childhood scrapes and scuffles, and a constellation of pinprick scars on his arms were evidence of an old, long-standing addiction. He couldn’t imagine what Sherlock must have been into, but it didn’t matter. That was the past, and the scars were all quite old. There were others, in disturbingly familiar places, and John pressed his thumb to a silvered slash, long since healed, on his wrist. It had been quite deep, almost too deep, and he wondered when it had ever been so unbearable for Sherlock that he was driven to these extremes.
Walking down Davies Street, she lit the way with her torch. When she stopped again, she found herself standing before a house with blue double-doors and no visible house-number at the corner of Berkley Street and Picadilly. But she recognized it. She stepped back and looked up. The top window of the massive building that sat here had an unusual symbol on it, created by the iron frame-work in the glass.
“John.” He spoke the name softly, “John Watson.” Speaking the name conjured memories of fair, sandy hair, tanned skin, eyes that couldn’t quite decide which shade of blue they wanted to be, and the promise of laughter in the lines around his mouth and eyes that carried the weight of great sadness as well. Of a soft tenor etched with accents from places people had forgotten the names of centuries ago. The scent of petrichor and moss, of ancient forests, mingled with the smell of slightly-damp, clean fur and covered by a neutral cologne. The way he had felt
“Are you leaving, Daddy?” She asked sweetly, looking up at him with the prettiest brown eyes. He smiled and hugged her tight.
“Oh, it won’t. He’ll act like it’s a shock, but he really is used to this sort of business.” Sherlock looked up from his phone as Greg emerged from the BMW and got a good look at their situation.
“I might as well be accused of trying to sabotage an inspection in our favour for once.” She shrugged, “All you need to do is ask nicely, Mr Holmes.”
“You called me, Greg, I usually show up when that happens. Kind of habit, yeah?” John held out one hand, “Help me up, mate.”
closely.” She shrugged and zipped up her hi-vis jacket over her SAB vest and fleece. Instead of the typical bowler hat, she wore a black knit-cap that did a better job of keeping her ears warm in the weather they were having.
“Mhm.” Of course, he didn’t believe her, he knew damn well what she thought of inspections, “Well, never mind that, you’ve been behaving yourself this inspection, you won’t hear from me.”
four people, including last night! I could pick this bloke out of any line-up you showed me, for Christ’s sake! I don’t know about anyone
to the hospital. They parked alongside the Smithfield Ambulance Station and abandoned the car, running towards the hospital. Judith could only hope they weren’t too late.
“It’s part of my job, Greg.” Judith’s smile softened and their fingers brushed as she took the water from him. “You’re off today?”
“Thanks. I think?” She followed John and Strange out of the massive room. “Does anyone know where I went?”
“Good night, Johnny Boy! You were stellar as always!” Moriarty smiled tightly, his coat over his arm. John noticed he was carrying two, and one was his companions. John didn’t say anything and simply smiled and went to hold the door for Moriarty.
?” He looked up at the bartender, who just gestured over John’s shoulder. He looked back, scouring the small crowd for anyone who might have thought it was a good idea to buy him a drink. There, at a corner table near the door, was a gentleman in a two-piece suit. Nothing fancy, rather simple, it was clearly not new but it was clean if not slightly rumpled with a white button-down and a rather gaudy tie. He had the air of the academic to him. He was rather heavyset with thinning, short brown hair cut high and short, and green eyes partially concealed behind a pair of thick glasses. Someone he knew? He didn’t look familiar right away, but that didn’t mean much. John shrugged and turned back to the bartender, who nodded. John sighed and finished his current drink before picking up the one a potential stranger had bought for him. For a minute, he studied it, but there weren’t any people who would want to do him harm
“Figured.” She chuckled and sat down next to him, “Guaranteed M knows I’m here, I can take a minute to eat before I see her.” Opening her takeaway box, Judith reviewed a few frames of footage that had loaded, pulling up a camera from across the street of the build-site.
Judith slept very well that night, despite the hour she actually got to bed, and was up at her regular hour. She wasn’t in London, so running was out of the question, but she got up regardless and was just done getting dressed when someone knocked on her door. Going to answer, she found Strange standing outside, fully dressed.
“Wait, wait. Say. That. Again.” Whatever it was, it wasn’t good. It must be family of some sort, but he couldn’t think of anyone she cared enough about that any bad news about them would bother her. She wasn’t on speaking terms with either of her parents, and she was barely on speaking terms with her brother Harry. What had happened?
A week after the final confrontation at The Diogenes Club, John Watson had quite literally disappeared. When questioned, Martha Hudson admitted only to seeing him leave with a rucksack full of clothes early one morning, upon inspection of the flat it was discovered that he had taken cash, his driver's license, and passport but nothing else. Two weeks worth of clothes were gone, as well as one of Sherlock Holmes’s dressing-gowns, a much-worn and beloved blue silk number that had been retired after an accident with sulphuric acid and cow tongues had burned a hole in one sleeve. No one had been hurt in the accident, but the last time the robe had been worn was the night before Sherlock had become one of London’s most wanted potential criminal masterminds. His toiletry kit was intact, which led to the understanding that he would have purchased the necessary items as he needed them.
“Wait a minute here. You’re a CEM too?” CEM (pronounced with a K-sound) was an acronym for “Council Estate Mutt”, which was a derogatory term for the kids who lived in Council Estate housing with their families.
“You never have, 008. You never have.” Q chuckled and stepped back with a tap to the roof, waving as he pulled out of his spot and got underway. It felt bittersweet to be leaving MI6, closing a chapter of his life that had done so much to shape the man he was today, the man he had become.
“Gentlemen, welcome back to Camp Bastion! To what do we owe the pleasure?” She smirked as she exchanged salutes and shook hands with the pair.
“Christ, no!” Hooper shook her head, tucking her hair behind her ear, a nervous gesture. “I’m so sorry about that.”
“Getting away from my brother’s idiot flat-mate.” She smiled as Christine came up the stairs, “I got them out of trouble and he had a funny way of saying thank you.”
“Ah, you’ll be right as rain in a minute, son.” She smiled at him, pushing damp hair out of his eyes, “What’s your name?”
“Of course, sir.” Hutchison smiled and leaned against his car. A couple more cars pulled in and took up point, ready to go when John was. Shaking his head, he took Sherlock’s hand in his and looked at Ford, who
“What are you, if you don’t mind me asking?” He stroked the soft fur, marvelling at the colour, the blend of white, black, and green.
“Don’t try to take the gun!” She whispered, “For all our sakes, Sherlock!” Time restarted and they watched from street-level. They heard the moment Jim Moriarty took his own life, and not three minutes later, John’s phone was lighting up with a call from Sherlock. Judith had her own call to answer from Seb.
“God, I’m sorry, Mycroft. You’re the wrong person to be mad at.” She tapped the envelope on the table and looked at Greg, “I guess you get your wish, in a
“Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas — an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know, he is a decent fellow.”
“I’m not sure, Mrs Hudson. As soon as I know something, I will let you know.” Judith looked at her landlady as she held the door for John. “Do
“Well, something would be nice. It’s considered polite to give someone your name when you meet them. You know mine, probably knew it before you ever set eyes on me, but you have me at a serious disadvantage.” She looked him over, “I’d say James Bond, but you’re a few years too young to be him, and I know him anyway, so no to that. Definitely MI6, though, marked that on you when I set eyes on you in the tent.”
A couple of hours later, while she sat on the bonnet of her truck tossing sweeties to the local children, who clamoured and carried on whenever Judith’s people showed themselves in the village, she felt her phone buzz in her pocket. Reception was next to awful, but it was possible to get messages and phone-calls through closer to the bases. Judith could only think of a few people who would try to reach her by phone rather than the more-reliable radio and rolled her eyes as she fished her phone out of its pocket on her vest. It was a text-message from Sherlock.
“Goodnight.” He waited until the car was out of sight and ran back inside. He charged upstairs and searched for Moriarty’s companion. No sign of him at the table, he couldn’t have gone far. John collected and processed the bill, keeping the tip, bussed the table himself, and went to find Moriarty’s quiet fey companion. He found the man in the gents after some searching, locked in a stall. John had clocked out of his shift and was prepared to leave, he didn’t want to leave the fey alone.
“This is Kamar-Taj, a place of sanctuary and learning. At the moment, you’re almost forty-five hundred miles from London.”
“Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man’s gadget.
“Get yourself together. I want your best game.” The now-familiar voice of the cabbie pulled Sherlock, still fighting out of the haze of the drugs, back to the here-and-now. To the matter at hand. Screwing his eyes up in concentration, Sherlock tried to straighten up. He remembered stopping the cab outside of Angelo’s restaurant when he decided to take a risk, without waiting for John, of being drugged, seeing John, briefly, outside the restaurant, the sound of his name shouted in panic, a tone of voice he’d only heard a few times. He couldn't remember anything else until he’d woken up here, at Baker Street.
“You know we can’t just show up on a Met scene like the old days, Sherlock. Almost no one there knows I’m back, never mind
“It’s alright, little queen. I’ll take care of you and your babies.” She smiled, “Let’s get you out of this place, huh?”
“John! Wake up!” She whispered. Suddenly, Sherlock’s eyes shot open and he grabbed her, rolling. They landed hard on the floor and he held her still, one hand over her mouth.
you scared more than a couple of soldiers into shape with it.” Stamford’s grin was mischievous. “Always called it The Watson Look, knew we’d done real wrong if you turned it on one of us.”
“Right, childhood. You saved him from bullies.” Moran smiled and rubbed his thumb along her cheek, “You’ve always followed me without question, and I swore I would never lead you astray. I never did, I never will.”
A bit of OOCness, but I think I can be forgiven. Yes, I made Strange a bit of a flirt, but I am NOT sorry! If Judith Watson can pull anyone she wants, who's to say Strange can't do likewise?
“I’ve got clear memory, begging your sir’s patience. I’m not an idiot.” She rested her elbows on her knees as the train slowed to a halt at Euston Square, and the car emptied.
you?” The woman finished preparing things for tea, “You’re an odd pair of detectives. Are you really with Scotland Yard?”
, Riley, and the coldest corner of Siberia won’t be the worst place I can think of sending the likes of you. Shut. Your. Mouth.” Riley did just that, her teeth closing with an audible clack. Brook whimpered, John and Sherlock just looked at each other, a bit alarmed, and Sally nodded approvingly. The last time the boys had seen this behaviour from Judith, she had been tearing down Richard Barrymore during the Baskerville base.
“He’ll get through these before Valentine’s Day. Very latest April Fool’s Day.” She closed the boot and headed for the front door. John pulled it open for her and took the top box.
will you tell me where we’re going?” She bugged him over the mic on her headset. It blocked out most of the rotor-noise of the Airbus H145.
“I thought I knew all the kids on our block.” She raised an eyebrow, “Pretty sure I’d remember you, at least.”
“Absolutely. Nice to see you again, Greg.” Hooper smiled as they headed for the door together. “Bye, Doctor Watson!”
them. If Judith hadn’t gotten between Sherlock Holmes and a pack of bullies on her way home from school that one day, an entire lifetime ago for them, it was unlikely they would have met each other any time soon enough to make a difference in each other’s lives. But because he had befriended the loner genius when no one else wanted to be around him, John had been there for Sherlock in some of his darkest times and still hadn’t turned his back on the other boy.
As she filled out the proper boxes, she heard a door open and close again. The house directly to her left as she faced Hope’s cab was empty, and yet…he had just walked out the front door. Hmm.
“Nothing you’re not capable of handling. Treat this like you’re on a covert mission. Remember how you acted, what you did, what you said.” He touched the back of her neck, pressing his index-finger to the hollow of her skull, “Calm your mind, calm your body, this is an operation now. Do not worry about yourself or any of your loved ones.”
Judith smiled as she tapped out that reply. Up at the scene, her brother looked at his phone then at her, his eyes narrow. She waved her phone at him and put a hand on Sally Donovan’s jacket as she came alongside her. Her phone chimed, but she ignored it for a minute.
“Good morning, Detective Inspector.” The man raised his head, aware of Greg’s presence in the room probably before he’d said anything, “I found her hiding in her subconscious mind, that’s all.”
“Brace yourself.” John murmured. A split second later, Rosie reached them and threw an arm around each of them.
“Oh, no, I’m not certain what your exact Other Form is, but I suspect you might be some breed of Cù-Sìth.”
“Well, if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I should prefer having a partner to being alone.”  Stamford looked rather strangely at John over his pint-glass.
“Well, no offence, son, but you can certainly do better than a scarred old war-dog like me. Looks like yours? You could have anyone and anything you wanted.”
“Sorry, I ... didn’t mean to intrude.” He finally stammered, realizing he was openly staring and had been silent for far too long.
She somehow got around Anderson and practically dove into Greg’s office when she got to his door. Throwing her weight against the door, she slammed it shut and contemplated locking it.
“Y’know what?” John reached for his coat, “I’m going to come with you, not because you asked me to, but because someone has to make sure you don’t get yourself arrested for interfering with police or vandalism or something.”
“Come on, you, let’s go face the vultures.” He winked and took Sherlock’s hand as Mrs Hudson opened the door for them. He stepped out first, completely ignoring the small army of reporters with their cameras, phones, and dictatapes. People still
best, actually. Judith Watson, this brat is Jim Moriarty. Good friend of mine, keeps me busy these days.”
“Well, I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but I do know this was a hate crime, probably an intimate one which points to either family or significant other as a suspect.”
Spots opened up on the balcony and Sherlock guided John back out onto the balcony. It got quiet between them, but it was that familiar, pleasant quiet Sherlock had missed so badly it made his chest ache to remember better days. John’s hopeful Romeo slinked off to find an easier target after realizing that John wasn’t quite as interested or available as he might’ve hoped at first. Someone on the balcony lit up a cigarette and Sherlock inhaled deeply. Oh, god, what he wouldn’t give for a cigarette. Letting out a slow breath, he took a sip of his drink and tried to keep his fingers from twitching. But John was observant and knew his habits and vices better than anyone else in London, and gave a soft chuckle as he turned and set his glass down on a handy nearby table.
“You’re an angel, Mrs. H.” She kissed her brother’s landlady on the cheek, “Are the boys home right now?”
. I know ’ow people think.” The cabbie rolled his eyes, “I know ’ow people think I think. I can see it all, like a map in my ’ead.” Sherlock turned his head away, exasperated and fighting down a wave of something very much like panic.
“Let’s see. I was parked on that street for almost three hours, not including the time I was on-scene, so...there's my car.” She spotted her squad-car, “Did a few foot-patrols while I was down there.” She hadn’t seen the cab by the time she finished eating, but Q knew what to do if and when it popped up on the cameras.
“Oh, John.” It was a sad utterance. All that time spent loudly proclaiming, “Not gay!” to all and sundry. But “not gay” didn’t mean “completely straight”, did it? Sherlock frowned and thought of the evidence he’d seen prior to 2011. “Not gay” indeed, but how many times had he and John gone to bed together? John had shown him that just because he was asexual didn’t mean he couldn’t
“Like who?” She hadn’t realized she had put her phone away until she pulled her hand out of her pocket. “Did you make me do that?”
“I think you deserve better, but look at the life you’ve made for yourself. Hell, Judith, you just made retirement as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the bloody British Army, honors to boot! Would I be mistaken to think Richard Hughes and his existing family were more the family you deserved than your own?”
“We’re here to find your puppies and get them back, Mr Radcliffe.” Sherlock appeared in the doorway to the kitchen, “We know who took them.”
“Yeah, home safe. And straight into the fray again.” She chuckled and ruffled his hair, “Get a haircut, Private. Getting a bit shaggy.”
“There’s Greg.” She murmured as they parked behind the BMW. Making sure she had her Browning and her handcuffs, she waited for Sally. They joined Greg, who looked like he hadn’t slept at all since the show-down at Baker Street, and approached the house.
“She didn’t take your badge, didn’t take your job, didn’t take your friends. We’ve still got a roof over our heads.
“Uh, Stamford’s cousin is a photographer and took me along to a fashion-show where some of the pieces out of House of DeVil were being shown. She was…not right in the head. There was something off about her, she was very rude to just about everyone there.”
Her one glimmer of peace was being able to go home after long hours on the streets to the house she shared with Greg and relax for a bit, even if it was a few minutes or a few hours. Her whole lifestyle was going to change now that she was in CID, but it wasn’t a change she saw as being too hard to manage. After all, she was
“No way! The Met needs you! You’re the only one who can handle Holmes and that scoundrel brother of yours!”
“Yep. Had it professionally cleaned and everything.” Indicating a garment bag draped over one arm. “One of my Army lads owns a service in town, did it for free when I explained it to ‘im.”
It was late January that things got a bit more interesting. The city was buzzing with nervous energy and the media was fueling a paranoia regarding a string of incidents The Met had declared serial suicides, there had been three in all since October, but with nothing aside from cause of death to link the victims, they had very little to work with. It was a puzzle that even Sherlock hadn’t been able to put a dent in yet, and it had Judith and her Met associates scratching their heads.
! I was kind of expecting it, but you surprised me. Again.” He sniffled and turned his head, “Why do you stick around, Jude? You’ve got better prospects out there than a washed-up war-dog like me, better places to live than here.”
“I’m just a…you know…” He faltered, hoarse with anger, but those watching thought it was panic. Sherlock knew better and took over smoothly, promptly aiming the pistol at John instead.
“I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone.”
“Hm.” John rolled his eyes. Dinner was enjoyable, he cleared his plate entirely and Mycroft made good on his promise of dessert in exchange for John’s undivided if unwilling attention.
The rest of the conversation only took a few minutes, and he heard only one side of the exchange, mono-syllabic or short answers, unsure if it was anger or something else in her voice and in her expression. When she finally hung up, she looked at her phone as though it had insulted her somehow.
“The man who found and rescued my coat from Moriarty.” He sniffled, thinking of the unassuming veteran who held the key to Sherlock’s freedom and happiness.
“Look, there’s obviously been some kind of mistake,” John said carefully. Barrymore held out his hand for Sherlock’s ID card, which Sherlock gave to him. He looked at the card and then up at Sherlock.
The morning was quiet with a few general stops but nothing major. Her radio to Dispatch was quiet for CID calls, and she checked in with Greg a few times. Everything was pretty quiet up there anyway, so she was good to stay on the streets. He’d let her know if he needed her for something.
“I’ll tell him it’s Timothy Almond they need to question.” She stepped into the apartment, seeing remnants of a house she had played in as a child. She followed the sound of raised voices into the bathroom where she found Sherlock and Anderson going at each other’s throats.
“There’s been an accident, apparently.” Judith came to the table, “I’m supposed to be upset about this?”
“Step out of the house, Miss Riley.” Judith said calmly, waving the woman out, “We’re looking for Richard Brook.”
“Well, that’s normal, sweetheart.” He studied the worn-out young man. “But you don’t like that, do you?”
“This way.” With a mischievous grin, Q led the way towards a mannequin standing on a frame, dressed in street clothes. “Our friend Buster will demonstrate.”
is because someone else is footing the bill! I couldn’t begin to afford London on my own the way the market is right now!”
to forget. The past was an awful gruesome thing and he wanted nothing to do with it for quite a while yet. The future had some promise to it and he would defend that future to his deathbed. He wanted to be with Sherlock, and he would be. Somehow, he would make this his life.
“Well, just … consider it. You never know, you might just find one person willing to live with a retired operative like yourself.”
As they reached the tape-line blocking the room off from the rest of the hallway, a green-faced constable bolted under the tape and dove between them, heading for a nearby bin. Judith intercepted the poor man before he missed the target completely, knocking the lid off the bin with a quick swipe of her left hand. The lid crashed to the floor, and she caught the constable by the shoulders as he staggered, heaving.
“Part of it.” He joined Sherlock on the pavement and looked around. “Oh. Nice part of town, bit expensive up here, isn’t it?”
After a case took a steep turn to the right, Judith found herself standing in James Roben’s office with Greg and Sally. Word had gotten out that Sherlock was a phoney, guilty of every crime he was credited with solving, but they had taken hold of the situation and the three of them were going up before Roben. They had to make it look like it was
The drive from Westminster to Richmond was quiet, and when they reached the cemetery, they only stopped when they reached a particular section of the cemetery itself after a brief stop at the gates to speak with the groundskeepers.
“Sounds like someone else I know.” John had to roll his eyes. If that wasn’t Mycroft Holmes to a fucking T. Or hell, even Q. But, to be fair to the Quartermaster, he was far more open than his elder brother.
“I … accidentally sat on her,” Sherlock said as he sat down gingerly on the grey chair. “I didn’t know she was there, in my defence.”
“You’ve got a reliable routine, Constable.” He flashed her that cheeky grin of his. “Can I give you a ride?”
“I want to raise bees. You’d write our memoirs, you’re better at it than I am for story-telling, and we’d…well, I’d like to have dogs, too.”
“Mother.” He lowered his head, a sign of submission? Or repentance? Watching someone like John Watson kneel to another was almost heartbreaking, Sherlock forced himself to remain still. It was clear life had not been very kind to Alexandra Watson, that she had suffered in the thirty-two years since her exile. But she was stronger for it and while her scars did not define her, they had made her the woman she was now. For a moment, it was quiet in the room, and then she reached out one hand, slowly, as if uncertain of the reception she would receive. Sherlock saw a shudder wrack John’s body as the outstretched hand came to rest upon his bowed head and it took every ounce of self-restraint he had not to go to his mate’s side and comfort him. This was not for him to interrupt.
“Watson?” A dismissive sound, a bored shrug, “Who bothers with the side-kicks? All he did was keep ‘olmes out of trouble. For what thanks?”
Sherlock had to smile. Lestrade knew how to get his attention. And really, he wanted out. Something like a case would be the perfect distraction. And he wanted to introduce John to his brother’s Amarante boyfriend sooner than later. He might as well, since they were likely to be in-laws at some point and it was looking very likely that John would be not only living with him but possibly working with him.
After solving the taxi-cab murders, the last of which John rather cleverly titled A Study in Pink, it was quiet for Judith and her loved ones. Her brother filed the necessary paperwork to change his last name to Watson. Which took a bit less time than usual in part, no doubt, thanks to Mycroft Holmes’ interference. He could be downright annoying, overbearing at the worst of times, but he meant well and really did have their best interests at heart, even if he was a bit misguided. Judith settled into a routine at The Met in Criminal Investigation Division, reporting to work every morning at eight, and returning home whenever she got a chance. Sometimes she didn’t see her bed for two days, other days she was home before midnight.
“Yeah. I guess I was.” She shook her head, “There’s just…something about you. I don’t know what it is. It’s bothering me. Like I shouldn’t be this close to you, that you’re trouble for me and everyone I love.”
“Never said I played fair, lad,” John said, ruffling damp curls as he turned back to the cook-top and finished up breakfast before plating. Setting one down at Sherlock’s place and one at his, he went back for tea.
Running down to the motor-pool, she coded into the coat-room and grabbed her keys, marked the log appropriately, and headed for the Land Rover they’d assigned to her. If it was hers for the foreseeable future or just this one-off patrol was uncertain, but she was definitely looking forward to driving it. The Rovers reminded her of the Jeeps she’d driven in Afghanistan, she was more familiar with their clearance and handling and knew the limits of the cars better than the estate-cars driven by other patrol units. She had a partner today, a regular constable, but he was happy to let her do the driving.
When James Roben walked out onto the street from 221B holding a handkerchief to his bleeding nose, gathered personnel were rather alarmed by the sight of him.
that nickname, and he knew Moriarty knew it. “I’ll bring some water for you as well, then?” He bowed a bit and cast a glance at Moriarty’s very handsome companion.
“No, but most people wouldn't mark a guy like you for someone with that particular skill-set.” She smiled, “But I suppose I shouldn’t be too surprised. After all, you are a man of many talents.”
They had often joked together that the normal married-lifestyle of most of society was not right for them. John needed excitement in his life, something to occupy himself with, just as Sherlock did. And for a whole glorious year and a half, they had found their needs fulfilled in each other. And then, Jim Moriarty had pitted Sherlock against the world and he had come out alive, but far worse for it. It had been almost two years since he had completed his final mission, since he had escaped with his life and sanity intact from Serbia? And in that time, he had not outed himself to anyone he knew. He had not seen his brother, or Molly Hooper, or Mrs Hudson, who still hadn’t let out 221B. He knew his brother was paying the rent, but as far as Mycroft knew, he was paying a dead man’s rent for a flat that would never be lived in again. And he certainly hadn’t outed himself to John Watson.
“Found a pair of my old boots that’ll keep me dry! Thanks, lads!” He waved over his shoulder and headed for a secondary line. They stopped short of the line and climbed onto the retaining wall, looking down on the scene from above.
“Thirty-four, with…how many years of service to the British Army? Fifteen years? You were seventeen when you entered service, weren’t you?”
It didn’t take long to queue up the proper cameras, and she caught Beth Davenport’s departure from Islington in the cab she had seen in Soho. They tracked it’s path through London, and focused on the Soho cameras after Judith’s car appeared at the build-site. An hour after she arrived, the cab pulled up. They watched the driver lead Davenport out of the cab at gunpoint and into the build-site, where they disappeared from view inside the trailers. About fifteen minutes later, Judith appeared on the cameras on a check of the area. It was interesting to watch herself disappear beneath the trailer the cats had been living under.
When he got to Tesco, he parked, locked the car, and headed into the store. He found what he needed in no time and checked out, thanking the girl behind the register and carrying the two bags of ice back to his car. As he put them in the back seat, a shout got his attention and the back of his neck pricked. What was that? Raising his head a bit, John saw a commotion by the doors. A man ten years younger than he and in far better shape was running away, people were shouting after him.
“You two keep an eye on the git, will you? I don’t need babysitting, just make sure he doesn’t do something stupid.”
When they reached the Morgue, they located an empty office, but it wasn’t hard to find Doctor Hooper. She was in the intake area, they found her by following the sound of her voice.
“You would know.” John rolled his eyes and tucked Sherlock’s shirt into his trousers. For once, his friend and partner had not elected for his usual bespoke-tailored suit and dress-shirt. Instead, he wore a well-tailored pair of denims, white dress-shirt, and a black brocade waistcoat, casual yet still classy. Going upstairs, John found shoes and trotted back downstairs to sit on the bottom riser and put them on. Sherlock was standing by the door, waiting for him with their coats. John took the green parka with a raised eyebrow. There was history to this coat, important history. Shrugging, he took it and headed down the stairs. Sherlock was right behind him, focused on his phone in one hand. As he held the door for Sherlock, he looked at his watch. It was barely gone seven. He raised an eyebrow, he seemed to be doing that a lot this morning.
“Oh, thank you, Johnny Boy.” Moriarty grinned at him and gestured at the wine. John nodded and carefully poured two glasses of water before he opened the wine. He made it look easy, but he’d been doing it for long enough it was just something he knew how to do. A bit of magic to ease out a stubborn cork and no one was any the wiser. Pouring a bit of wine into one glass, he passed it to Moriarty, who sniffed it and took a sip. John had the man’s entire order memorized, knew what he ordered, when, and how he liked it prepared. While Moriarty sipped at the wine and decided he liked it, John noticed his silent companion had downed both glasses of water and quietly refilled them.
“Well, it’s a beautiful pelt. Take care of it.” She smoothed the ruffled fur with careful fingers and did the same to his hair, unable to help herself, apparently. “There, all properly settled. You boys get on your way and be safe.”
“Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime.” John wrinkled his nose and leaned his head back to blow a stream of smoke at the ceiling. “Far too much.”
“Oh, there you are, sweetheart.” John tried to smile, but he couldn’t quite manage as he reached down to give the cat sitting by his feet a bit of affection. “Well, at least I’ve still got you, eh?” That got him an inquisitive meow and the calico cross that had kind of adopted him reared up on her back legs, resting her front paws on his thigh as she stretched up to study his face. That led to a lapful of concerned, affectionate cat. John chuckled and scratched her behind the ears as she put her paws up on his chest and rubbed against him, making soft, comforting noises in her throat. John wasn’t quite sure how old she was, guessed she was in her teens, but he knew she’d had a hard life before finding her way to into his. She was blind in one eye, whether from accident or ageing he wasn’t quite certain, and she had been a bit thin and scruffy, but five years of constant companionship, food, and a warm place to sleep had given her a pleasing bulk and her coat was smooth and silky. He just called her Kitty, not really good about naming animals. He had kept thinking she would move on eventually, but she just kept coming back and sticking around, finding her way into the flat through various means, and John had simply adapted.
smile.” Bix looked pointedly over his shoulder. Greg heaved a sigh of relief, checked his watch, and started to run. He hid the box very carefully when he got back to the room and took a shower, taking care not to lose
“But didn’t stay in touch with your brother: that says you had problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you
“ ... but the police don’t go to private detectives.” At least not as often as people might think. If they ever did. Private detectives were a class of their own.
“You’re a fucking idiot, Sherlock Holmes. Take off your coat and strip.” Those had been the first words out of John Watson’s mouth, and they were beautiful. Sherlock had gladly done so and been bundled into dry things and John had dutifully tended to his wounds, pulling a bullet from his right arm and stitching up a few nasty abrasions. That had been the beginning of their international adventures, John proving himself very useful in taking apart Moriarty’s network. Sherlock had apologised for lying to him, for keeping him in the dark about just how much trouble they were really in before The Fall, John had been very forgiving.
Greg was pulled from recall of the past by movement on the stage and the house-band starting up a sweet, haunting tune. Everyone at their table turned to pay attention, and the MC gave an explanation of what they were about to see, informing the curious and enthralled crowd of diners that they had a special guest with them tonight to join the girls for this next set.
“Well, wherever I end up, I’m not leaving you for the woods, love.” He promised later as they lay on his double bed. “Don’t know if I’ll stay here or move elsewhere, but I’ll make sure you come along.” That got an inquisitive purr and he smiled, rubbing her head with his fingertips.
As they came up on 3 Chester Street, she saw lights on in the window, one of the only houses on the row that
Judith confronts Jefferson Hope. It goes about as well as could be hoped for, but ends peacefully. And, Hope wants to talk. If he wants to talk, The Met is more than happy to listen.
things. That does not make you a freak.” John reached out and took Sherlock’s hand in his, threading their fingers together. “You are not a freak, and anyone who calls you that will have me to deal with.”
With Jim Moriarty currently off the roster, things quiet down in London. But it never lasts very long, so when someone launches an attack on the London Sanctum, Judith can honestly say she isn't that surprised. Time to save the world again.
“Yes, actually, and no. Absolutely not.” Sherlock was prepared to blow her off, despite the well-aimed barb.
“Of course I figured it out!” He rolled his eyes at her, “I’m almost insulted you think so very little of me.”
related to the Holmes family by blood, but it sure felt that way sometimes and they might as well be for the sheer ridiculous amount of time he’d
“Ah! I knew it!” Sherlock chuckled and took John’s parka and a shock blanket from one of the paramedics while his mate got up on the gurney beside him. Wrapping the blanket around John’s lower body, his hindquarters primarily, Sherlock draped the coat around him and pulled the hood up to cover his head. Watching him Phase was…interesting. There was a ripple of Glamour and the sound of a body shifting shape and bones settling into different arrangements. But it wasn’t long before John sat beside him in human form once again, wrapped in the shock blanket and his parka. Some adjusting got the blanket tied around his waist so it wouldn’t fall off and bare him to the world, and Sherlock helped him to zip the parka up when his fingers wouldn’t stop shaking once they had both been cleared.
of my problems, and it’s easier to just ignore him.” She got up and brushed off her uniform, “Well, I’ve got a date with the Chief Superintendent. So, if you two will kindly excuse me, I’ll try to make it back down for the press-con.”
“Don’t count on it. You know they don’t get along.” Judith narrowed her eyes as she pulled the keys and got out. Locking the car as a precaution, she headed for the tape-line to join Sally Donovan.
“Oh, Kitty.” John sighed, looking over the railings at the patient old woman, “She hasn’t been a bother, has she, Mrs Hudson? If she has, I am so sorry.”
“I don’t know what you’re into, but you’re coming back with me.” He took her by the hand and pulled her to her feet, “Come on, you.”
“What are you thinking about?” Greg’s voice was soft in her ear and she realised they had moved a bit and wondered how long she’d been lost in her head. He was behind her now, they were both tucked under the covers, and one hand was running up and down along her side. She looked at the clock on the bedside table and blinked.
After a surprisingly restful night’s sleep, John woke at his usual time and lay in bed for a minute longer before deciding he might as well start his day. He knew he had slept well just by the way he felt this morning, despite a few expected aches, and sat on the edge of the mattress, not missing how his feet didn’t quite reach the floor. It wasn’t that the bed was abnormally high, of course, John just happened to be a bit shorter than most men. It had never really bothered him, there were far bigger problems in the world, but he did take issue if someone made a point of bringing up his stature. Now, in his defence, living with someone so much taller than him was not a problem. He didn’t actually care about that, it didn’t
“Don’t regret a minute of it. I got my gun back six months after I left when I swung back through here on a stop-over, Greg had it for me and just gave it back when he came to find me.”
If there was one thing Judith Watson didn’t have much of, it was patience for stuffy government types who didn’t give a damn about the faces behind the numbers on their spreadsheets, let alone the numbers marked in red to note a combat-death or cause-related death. She had seen her share of inspections, and nearly every time she received a warning from her superiors to behave the next time, these people signed their paychecks and controlled their budgets. The last thing any of them wanted was a smart-mouthed medical officer to tell off the wrong government official and get vital funding pulled.
“Of course, we have work to do.” He handed her a slip of paper and left. She looked at what was written on the paper and made a face.
“Never have been, and I love animals. More fond of dogs, but I have no problem with cats.” Oh, did that get her attention. “Oh, don’t look at me like that, Princess. You’re just fine. I like you.” John just chuckled and got comfortable for some unwinding. It was late enough he could go to bed, and part of him really wanted to. So after finishing the current chapter he was on, he marked his place and set the book on the side table. Getting up, he collected his empty cup and retrieved Sherlock’s, taking them back to the kitchen to wash out for tomorrow.
“I have a half-blind cat, she’s no bother though, minds her own business but puts herself quite firmly in mine.” John said, “And I object to unnecessary noise, I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours if I sleep at all, and I despise being idle for too long. I don’t like being bored.”
“Either way, you’re wasted as a cabbie.” Sherlock propped his head up on his hand and looked at the man again. Rubbing his fingers across his chin, he dropped his hand, now strong enough to keep his head up unassisted.
“You ... ” Sherlock sat cross-legged in front of him as he finished that bit of the story. “John Watson, you are the luckiest men in the world. How the hell did you not know you’d been shot!”
