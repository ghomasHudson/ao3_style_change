They go over to have a look at her work as well. Janine has a picture up on her ipad of a young woman with a headscarf, and then her painting is of the same image, but in the brightest possible colours.
Sherlock lets go when he can bear to, and Mycroft turns, and looks at him. He has badly disguised emotion in his eyes.
Eventually Mycroft takes over, his toast half-eaten on his plate. He already seems practiced at it, holding the bottle just right, stopping when she coughs. Sherlock observes him. He has never seen him do this, but at the same time it suits him. As if he was always going to have a child.
John couldn’t look at Mycroft lying there, cut open. John couldn’t look at Sherlock and see the exact moment when Sherlock would realise what was happening, when his heart would break. John could only hear Sherlock’s soft, pained gasp at seeing them start CPR and thought,
Sherlock is on the back row, behind John. Raz with the green nostrils is as well, along with the blonde woman – Sarah something? - Wiggins, and the dagger tattoo one also from Baksheesh tattoo. Next to Molly is Soo Lin with the tea sleeve, then Janine, and lastly the tube one, Howard.
Sherlock seems to have committed himself to loving John, and it is very clear that he is making an effort. But Mycroft can see behind the mask. Sherlock seems pale. His hands tremble, occasionally. He only takes cases when John is there to come along, and often hurries through them.
Sherlock looks at him again as if he’s not sure why he’s saying this. “You’re certain you want to stay home?”
John blinks his eyes open to some faded light. It feels early. He’s cold, he kicked the blanket off at some point during the night. His toes are freezing and his neck has a crick in it.
He did not think that Sherlock would do something stupid, not now that he has John, but it had still been a nagging doubt. Sherlock has always been very verbal about disliking his heats, and the ones that Mycroft has witnessed were violent, and seemed painful. He never wished it on Sherlock to have to go through another one.
insane - not talking. But it’s also exactly what he wants. Not a word. Not a single solitary word, just immediately down to what he came here for.
“You have six hours to create a trash polka tattoo.” Mike looks at all of them. “And your time begins... now!”
Mycroft sinks down on the toilet in the cramped bathroom of Baker Street with a whirl of disbelief - it is too early. The caesarean was scheduled for mid-March. But yet this is undoubtedly occurring.
Selflessly, because Mycroft does know that John is still fully hard. John’s erection is pressed between them. Mycroft turns onto his back, and manoeuvres John on top of him. Mycroft kisses John, opens his legs, and John slides inside of him without much resistance. The feeling is still remarkable. Mycroft allows him to thrust inside of him, saying things like, “God, you’re marvellous, the way that looked…”
Mycroft looks at the message for a long moment. He replies, feeling the exhaustion of the day press on him, “Indeed they are. Good night, John. MH”
The sound of his voice alone is enough to curl over Sherlock’s spine and arouse him even further. “Leave me alone.”
for it, as much – is there a feeling for that, ready to get married? But for all intents and purposes, Sherlock is the love of his life, and John’s sure of that. So it’s not like he’s
Sherlock quickly reviews what he knows of the man, but other than the basic facts, he knows little. He has never had any particular interest in his work – it is too broad, too undefined to be employed as a tattoo. On top of that, this particular image is so common-place that the Google searches display endless merchandise and posters.
“They’re signs for a bonding ceremony, specifically between a beta male and an alpha male. It’s very rare, actually. It says, ‘bond to me,’ or ‘commit to me.’ But I suppose the modern translation would be ‘marry me?’”
As they walk inside, there’s a trail of customers hurrying out. Sherlock goes in first, and he is hit with a wave of
Sherlock still despises Mycroft, sitting there, drinking tea and carefully eating his third biscuit of the evening. Mycroft is still saying the same things, behaving in the same way, his words pressing on old sores between them, referring to shameful, annoying, distant memories. Sherlock still feels young around him, unprepared, never good enough.
After a particularly bad overdose, Mycroft tried to ply him into sobriety with a variety of offers. Money, a job after rehab - the usual. But this time, Sherlock proposed a bet. A year of complete accountability, surprise blood and urine tests, voluntary hair samples, and in return...
But John grins mischievously, taking years off his face, and then disappears between Mycroft’s legs. Mycroft cannot see him over the curve of his stomach, but he can feel John all the more for it. He discerns the trace of John’s lips, a rush of his breath, and the wet heat of John’s mouth as he takes him between his lips.
While he smokes, he can still hear John’s voice reverberate in his mind. Even the scientific details that tend to bore everyone who Sherlock usually attempts to converse with had John nodding. His knowledge of corpses in various states of decomposition was considerable as well - Sherlock particularly relished their discussion on the role of maggots in temperate climates.
Sherlock stays there, not sure why he made John so angry. And a little pleased by John saying ‘boyfriend’, because he hardly ever does.
He doesn’t hear from him for three whole days. And then, at five in the morning, John’s phone buzzes and beeps. John jumps up and wildly struggles to unlock his phone. It’s a text. “Posted the ad. Come around? S.H.”
“Thanks, yeah.” John tries to put Jim’s comment out of his mind. Did Sherlock take it like that, the heart design? If he didn’t want it, he would have said no, though, wouldn’t he?
Oh, John says that he only wants to be the donor, but if it is an open secret - which Mycroft assumes it very much would be - there would be little difference between donor and father here. Especially if the child is at Baker Street as often as Violet is.
It’s a much nicer taxi ride than the one a couple of months ago. Now there’s a sense of expectation, of joy. Sherlock’s tapping his foot up and down.
“Difficult to predict.” Sherlock has given it some thought, naturally. Even when considering all the styles they have been asked to execute previously – old school, cover-up, pin-up, black and grey, illustrative blackwork, trash polka – there is no clear next step. “New school seems plausible.” Janine would be pleased. “Though it might be too close to the trash polka movement. Oriental is also a possibility. I imagine colour will be required regardless of style.”
“Yeah, if it’s healthy...” John smiles at Mycroft, and Sherlock can feel the emotion between them. John wants to hug Mycroft too, it’s clear. Mycroft will probably allow it, but John doesn’t try to, and so they’re standing there, looking at each other.
When her cries are so loud that they fray his nerves, so terrible that he would give everything for just a moment of silence. Just a breath, so he can go on.
“Oh, yes.” Mycroft smiles, and his whole face changes with the memory. “I believe I might have had something to do with that - I tried to play Santa until he was six and he built a trap for me.”
Bright colour and broad brushstrokes, it is emotion turned into paint. Van Gogh’s work holds a delirious edge that lives in all of them.
Molly smiles at Sherlock in clear thanks. Soo Lin nods at Molly happily as well. Raz and Bainbridge are already high-fiving. “Fuck yeah!”
is. He’s never met him, but he’s seen him in the magazines. John’s even checked his website once or twice to look at his work. ‘The Science of Tattooing’ - really, he sounds like a complete prat. One who’s world famous in the business though.
“Oh, yes!” She’s glowing with happiness. “We got an Elvis impersonator and everything. I know it’s a little silly, but, you know, we had fun.” She glances at Sherlock.
He left the hospital as soon as possible. Both because of the discomfort of spending one more minute in that cramped space, and for the memory of it. The bite mark on the back of his neck still feels tender to the touch.
John and Sherlock seem to have settled into their shared domesticity again. Mycroft is not certain whether it is because he sees them with much greater frequency now than he ever did before, but he can often pick up on the mood between them. There is hurt still there, hidden not too deep below the surface. But John, if his comments are anything to go by, seems certain of staying close to Sherlock for life. And Sherlock, for his part, looks at John as if he is an unexpected treasure, something that he never thought he would have sitting across from him again.
It doesn’t help to make him feel better at all. Especially not when he comes home and Sherlock looks him over, and John can tell that he
“The handle matches the shade of purple of your dress, plus the floral design will compliment the dahlias on your hat,” Sherlock says.
Mycroft does. He sits down and considers how much longer he can do this. This will be his fourth round of hormones. The chances of a successful pregnancy are lower and lower on every consecutive try. He regrets now that he did not have a double implantation every time, it would have changed the odds slightly. Not enough, perhaps.
John gets the urge to text him constantly. He’ll think of something funny, and he’ll want to grab his phone, and… he can’t.
Sherlock doesn’t feel anger about that, exactly. It’s something darker than that, and not nearly as simple. Because if there was
Mycroft does not need to ask. He sits down on the sofa next to Sherlock. Violet climbs off Sherlock’s lap and onto his own, where she has less space than usual but it does not bother him yet that she leans against his stomach. And Sherlock carefully moves behind him, puts a hand on his shoulder to steady him as he leans down, then presses his lips to his neck.
Or, ‘Come in here?’ But this is already a good thing - John’s curious where this will go, getting off while talking to Sherlock. Once in a lifetime opportunity here. Plus, he doesn’t have to think of exactly why he’s doing this. So he says, “I suppose I would imagine another person there with me?”
- Sherlock can tell - and it will be easier to talk to him as opposed to watching him endlessly agonise over something that should be entirely clear by now. Yes, John can spend the night. Yes, they can be together without it taking anything away from the wedding. There is no reason for Mycroft to assume that it would.
Never mind the fact that Mycroft has a sexual relationship with John, and that they have a biological child together.
, they were doing so well. They were amazing. For once in his life it worked, he had it all figured out, and now…
Mycroft wants her to at least feel connected to others. To be able to communicate. A certain degree of solitude comes with intelligence, and with being a Holmes as well, Mycroft knows. Sherlock and himself were raised in such loneliness.
“Guess we solved that one.” John smiles for a moment, but the edges seem brittle. Does he want to do this?
“This is a good challenge, isn’t it?” Molly offers, manoeuvring her steps around the worst of the pavement. “I love that painting.”
And then again it is, but in a different way. Mycroft feels cautious not to get too attached to this child, because it could be taken from him at any time. But at the same time he cannot stop himself from planning. From having a future where this baby is with them fixed in his mind.
It’s only when he looks in the mirror afterwards and feels his cheeks, that he realises why. Mycroft puts some lotion on his face and arms and texts John, “I’m afraid I forgot to put sun cream on myself. MH”
Mycroft eats breakfast while Sherlock feeds her. He watches her drink the bottle, and he feels proud, for the minute that she does it. And then she turns her head away and cries, so he tries to push it into her mouth again, but she refuses, and milk drips over her face, and streams down her chin.
John says to Sherlock, “I’m going out. With Mycroft, we’re taking Violet to the park, you want to come?”
“The work is never done, one can only try to stay on top of it.” Mycroft smiles, removes the files, and takes a seat in his chair.
He blinks, and John must see some of his shock, because he says, “Oh, we’re not nearly there yet, don’t look so worried.”
After the mildly-burned dinner they watch some TV. Then John crawls into bed with her, lies beside her, and tries to feel anything at all.
Despite that, Mycroft is careful with his invitations. He does not intend to see John in that way more often than once a week, but his body has other ideas. He only needs to stand near John and smell him to feel his nipples tighten. Even a single touch creates a slight spasm, and then the wetness soaks him.
Mycroft wants to reach out, but then he does not know what to say exactly. What he writes is, “Violet emptied out a whole bucket of water onto the floor from her bath, partially onto my shoes. MH”
Mycroft tries to control it. To suppress it, even, but the thought of John’s touch is the feeling that floods him when he is not paying attention, the lift that gets him out of bed in the morning.
He was not aware of how much he had assumed that he could not do this until this very moment. How much he had thought that his body would betray him after all. That it would be too old to function, worn and no longer useful.
Mycroft does not know how long it takes, surely only a few minutes, but when Sherlock stops and steps back, he feels as if it has been a long, continuous moment of desire.
That is not at all unusual for people from a certain upbringing, of course. And not all of them have the same dislike for intimacy as adults, so Mycroft does not know how far that argument stretches. Mycroft himself did hug Sherlock as a child. Perhaps not enough. When Sherlock was older, it irritated him, and Mycroft stopped.
He repeatedly considers heroin, then dissuades himself. Still, the temptation pulses heavy under his skin.
He did not have any real expectations, but in a small way and for no reason that he can discern now, he had assumed that it would be another girl. Perhaps because this pregnancy does mostly feel the same as it did with Violet. But he had not imagined it in any detail, so it is not as if he is disappointed. Very far from it, in fact.
Sherlock’s body rebels, it throbs and whines like a caged animal. His mind feels shaken, unreal, but he
He finishes it as fast as he can, motions the client over, applies the stencil to his upper arm, and commences the tattoo – he checks – forty-three minutes behind schedule.
“You were meant to draw from life, to show that you can draw. This does not convince me of that,” Irene says scathingly. “Furthermore, it is entirely the wrong shape for a legible tattoo.”
Mycroft accepts it and risks, “Were you successful in spending time with your partner as well?” He is fully aware of what he is admitting to with his phrasing.
Violet starts whining, so they get up and walk some more. They allow her to stick her hands into a fountain and mildly splash them both. They walk close to the ducks. See a squirrel.
Mycroft is again struck by the two of them, and the front of concern they make. How very much they both seem to want to know these things. To be involved, to discuss this, while he himself would prefer to never say anything at all.
He hobbles back into the bright warm lobby and catches a glimpse of Molly, Soo Lin, and Janine, still laughing around the table. They’ve ordered a bottle of wine now. He could join them, if he wanted to. He takes the lift up to his room instead.
Sherlock knows why, of course. Why he didn’t do it in the dark, or get John drunk, or any of it. He’d naively, stupidly, thought that maybe it would be enough that it was John.
But John moves a little. His breath changes, as if he wants to say something. Sherlock quickly says, muffled, “Don’t.”
There’s something that needs doing for the wedding every single day now. Selecting the music, checking the guest list, calling the caterer, making sure the hotel rooms are booked for everyone... It’s a never-ending list of things ‘for the big day’, as Sherlock has started calling it. Which cracks John up every time he does it because it sounds like he got it straight out of a bridal magazine.
Instead, Sherlock takes care of Violet, selflessly. As he has done nearly every single day for the last year now.
Mycroft can see that this is a way for both of them to be assured that they can still do this. It removes the pressure of a phone call or speaking in person, where they would have to discuss more difficult topics. He knows that much, but still it is, unabashedly… distracting.
It makes him feel uneven. It is jarring, to wish for a thing. It opens one up and exposes something uncertain to the light.
Christ. John has never done any welding in his life. Maybe he should have prepared for this and taken a class or two. It’s too late now, though. John eyes the material. He can probably manage to make something? Hopefully.
John gets dressed and gives himself one more glance in the mirror. He looks like shit, really. Except for the glint in his eyes.
Mycroft doesn’t look as if he’s fully listening. John doesn’t doubt that he does hear it, but Mycroft’s eyes follow Violet. He seems to want to take her in. He must have missed her. When Sherlock’s done, John asks, “Are you okay?”
There are two none-too-surprised-looking men walking in. Sherlock looks up at them, quickly scans them, and then nods.
Sherlock stands back while the cameras film his client, and then wraps the tattoo so she can wear her trousers again. Sherlock says his goodbye and leaves towards John’s shop, only to see John still in conversation with his own gushing client.
Violet wiggles to be let go again, not particularly impressed by Mycroft’s long absence. Mycroft lets her. He asks Sherlock, “Has she been all right?”
Sherlock knows that feeling, better than Mycroft will ever know. He puts his violin aside, carefully takes William out off the baby wrap on his back, hands him to Mycroft, and says, convinced, “Then give him everything you do have.
Sherlock waits for another moment, and then there’s the sound of the door falling shut. The thuds as he races down the stairs.
“Now,” Mike continues, “We know it’s been a long day so far, so I’ll ask you to stay seated, and we’ll give you the instructions for tomorrow’s elimination tattoo.”
On the way home, Mycroft impulsively calls the restaurant, and arranges for a bottle to be brought to Sherlock and John’s table when they are dining there next week.
When John leans back again, Sherlock looks over his face. John seems happy, somewhat, but his eyes seem shiny, and he looks away, embarrassed. Then swallows, and looks back at him. “That was… yeah.”
Four clients walk out. As Molly slides off her seat, the plastic wrap on her thigh is briefly visible. All of them are still healing their own tattoos.
John’s not far behind. He lets go and fucks him as hard as he can, sweating, gasping, until his whole body clenches and he comes with a long shudder.
that will force him to think about every unpleasant possibility before hard evidence presents itself. It is simply foolish to attempt to reason with insufficient data and a dangerous path for a man predisposed to coping with addictive substances.
John takes a step forward, marking him continued intent. “Yes, I will, but after I’ve seen to the wound. It looks like it might need stitches.”
John — steadfast and quick John — so dependable; Sherlock can scarcely do without him these days. It’s simply instinct to summon John when something misaligns in his head because he is ever so good at making the world seem right again. He is always on hand when Sherlock needs him, even when he doesn’t request or expect it, and he is always poised and ready for a fight, if need be. It is disappointing, then, when John’s constancy is not reassured by the usual scrape of chair legs and scuttle of feet when Sherlock summons him. The flat is eerily silent behind him and he frowns.
John takes him by the hand and elbow and pulls him up with ease despite his smaller stature. The movement is so quick to Sherlock’s jellified limbs that he sways on his feet. He would have fallen forward onto his hands and knees had John not grasped him heavily by the upper arms and held him on the spot.
Sherlock sighs heavily and considers his options. He could continue to resist and provoke unnecessary worry, or he could allow John to arrive at his own sense of closure for having done something helpful. The latter seems the most mutually beneficial, so Sherlock sits down on the sofa in silent concession. John nods to himself then goes to the kitchen to retrieve the first aid kit from under the sink, and fill a bowl with warm water and a clean cloth. He places them on the coffee table before sitting down besides them.
Sherlock has eaten properly, as far as he could tell by the lack of hunger, but John has inadvertently offered a distraction he knows he will not be able to refuse.
“For God’s sake,” he snarls viciously at his own helplessness, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes, then rips them away and sends his blurred vision towards the ceiling. “John!”
else - fuck him. It doesn’t matter one bit who John is, just that he’s hard and willing to give it to him. But that’s the deal here, and John gets that.
. Mycroft texts from the car, “Said darling children were, through a combination of positive reinforcement and reverse psychology, remarkably well behaved this morning. I am somewhat apprehensive. M”
Mycroft considers John’s question. It’s too soon. They can’t do this quite this often. He knows it is sheer folly. But what he says is, “Yes. M”
They hide behind some shrubbery in the suspect’s back garden to wait for her, and John takes his hand. Sherlock doesn’t like the distraction on a case, but it’s nice enough and he has things to make up for, so he kisses John. John pulls him in.
In fact, while he did not even spare it a faint thought until a couple of weeks ago, now he can feel it occupy his mind. The thought of having a second child.
John takes a bite from his toast, a bit awkward as one arm is holding William who’s on that post-bottle edge of drowsily conking out.
Sherlock looks at Mycroft, and silently begs him to realise. He says, fighting the words, his voice a low rumble, “I can’t
So John steps over him to pull him up. Only Sherlock gives him a purposeful pull, and John falls on top of him instead, laughing breathlessly.
dance at their wedding. Sherlock takes the cane, measures it, and texts Mycroft to ask, “Best London shop to get a cane custom-made? S”
He sits down and orders a beer, chases it with a shot of whisky, and he’s in the middle of that... when he stops.
to see Mycroft. Maybe it’s because they text all the time, but John actually missed him these past few days.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Yes, we’re all aware.” It figures that he would end up raising a second one.
“No? Why the hell not?” John shrugs off his shirt, revealing a white undershirt. “She was into you.”
Out of all the things they got wrong between them in the last so many years, all the pain, helping raise Violet is something that they’ve gotten right, isn’t it? Sherlock is amazing with her. He’s patient and creative, he’s fun and kind, and he adores her. And John loves Sherlock, he’s always going to love him. Sherlock is always going to come first, he knows that.
It’s a question that could be answered in many ways. But Mycroft should take himself out of this equation, he does not belong in it, and he refuses to cause Sherlock any more pain than he already did. “Then you need to discuss that with Sherlock.”
The reply doesn’t come, so after another ten minutes John’s had it with his room and goes downstairs again. Sherlock is looking at his experiment as if nothing happened. In the zone, probably. John says, “Taking a shower.”
Sherlock does care. Probably about as much as it’s possible for him to, John believes that, he does. So he smiles, and says, “You don’t have to. It’s fine. We’re fine.” They’ll go back to how it was, then. Friends.
Sherlock’s home. Sitting on the sofa, his knees pulled up, arms curled around them. It’s clear that he’s miserable, too.
“Serious relationship, less than two months. Beta male, most likely.” Sherlock squints, but no, that’s it. “You’re happy.”
John reaches out and takes his hand, then tangles their fingers. “We did it, yeah? We figured it out.”
They stay in bed, even though they are both mostly dressed. John turns to his side with an arm over Mycroft’s stomach, and they lie close together while John talks about the wedding, Violet, and William. Mycroft answers him while he languishes in the sweet, subtle familiarity of it.
That night, at some undefined hour after feeding and nappies and heavy fatigue, Mycroft holds William.
They start walking, and cross the road. John’s not entirely under Mycroft’s umbrella but about half of him is being saved from the rain by walking next to him anyway. He’s not sure, but he thinks that Mycroft’s doing it on purpose. So is this going to be a ‘thank you’ then? Checking up on how the heat went for Sherlock? Probably both, John thinks.
John comes down to feel the weight of Sherlock on top of him, skin stuck together with sweat, both of them breathing as one. John tilts his face and kisses him - wet, open-mouthed kisses, lazy and desperate at once.
The next day is Sunday, and Mycroft has a leisurely morning of waking up, along with Violet, at seven. Something that is still rather unheard of, even at nearly fifteen months. Violet does not sleep through the night often.
He did it, and his body thinks that he’s still doing it, that he’s still there, claiming Mycroft, only…
John knows that he has to stop looking at this as an either-or thing, because he has both, now. He has Sherlock to go home to and Mara to sleep with, so he should feel like the luckiest damn bloke in the world, right?
“I did. I am perfectly fine.” To prove it, Mycroft stands up, and John is treated to the lovely lines of his shoulders, back, arse and legs. And as Mycroft turns to him, the lush curve of his pregnant stomach and his cock underneath. John can barely believe when looking at him that they had sex last night. He had
When Violet gets a bit louder, her shrill voice disappears into the mass of people talking, so John thinks that helps. They’re not about to get kicked out for having her here at any rate. Angelo brings Violet a packet of crayons and paper along with the menus, and John relaxes into it.
John didn’t really think about what it must look like to Mycroft – Sherlock, Violet, and himself in a bed. Not until he goes back, and carefully settles into the spot where his body heat still lingers.
John makes tea, instead. And toast, and then eats it standing up in the kitchen, both because there is still congealed blood on the table, and because he doesn’t want to be staring at Sherlock when he wakes up. He catches a whiff of formaldehyde, and the smell alone is enough to remind him again - vividly - what happened last night.
“Yes, it’s raining, and there’s thunder, you hear that?” John leaves a pause, and they both stop, stand still, and listen for it.
He had planned it in such detail. He had foreseen the calm, quiet way in which he would say goodbye to the feeling of carrying this child. How he would go through the surgery, more familiar with the procedure now. How he would see his baby for the first time in all privacy. He wanted to wait until he was recovered somewhat and then call Sherlock and John himself to hear the joy in their voices.
John shaves before he sees her, and hums in front of the mirror. John wears clothes he thinks make him look young. Sherlock wants to tell him that he looks much better in a jumper, as himself. Sherlock wants to make him stay home, to keep John in Baker Street and never allow him to leave.
John seems startled, and then laughs. “Wow. Well, I wasn’t expecting that?” He breathes. “Thought you’d be upset, first.”
A hand job is hardly a life changing event. Nor was the fuck the week before - it wasn’t special at all. John imagines people are fucking behind closed doors like that all over London. Endless cluttered flats with kaleidoscope-eyed pale men, looking at him with sharply intelligent gazes, as if they
Then John starts making noises that they can invite them over, if Mycroft is up to it, and no, they can’t. Eventually, Sherlock texts Mycroft, admitting defeat: “Bond more difficult to break than anticipated. Stay away. SH.”
Sherlock instantly worries about that as well. He shares a look with Mycroft. It is a known sign in psychopaths. He saw Violet acting like that today, but he hadn’t even thought of that! What if there is something wrong with her?
There’s a crib next to Mycroft’s bed. Also a row of half-empty bottles on and around his bedside table, a used nappy next to a changing table, a tube of rash cream, two half-finished cups of tea, a book, and his reading glasses peeking from the unmade bed. For Mycroft, it’s an unmentionable mess.
“...Um.” John thought Mike might know the cigarettes weren’t for him, but he hoped it wouldn’t be quite that obvious. “Something like that.”
Mycroft gives Anthea instructions over the phone from his bedroom and then gets dressed, quickly - a car will be at his door soon.
John gets the feeling that there’s an or else in there. “Sure.” As embarrassing as it must be to him, ‘Mycroft nearly fainted on our sofa this morning’ is hardly world news.
They wait in silence for it to be made, but it doesn’t feel awkward. Not after that night in the hospital, or after everything else. They’ve seen each other through way worse, haven’t they? John remembers Sherlock’s funeral. Cursing Mycroft, wanting to hit him. Mycroft’s pale face as he took every single insult thrown his way. Mycroft would have taken the punches as well, John thinks now.
This will be the moment where he will be allowed to tell everyone that he wants John to be his. From that day on, they will be bound together.
Sherlock can feel John’s concern rushing like water over him. He thinks about curling his fingers around John’s sleeve, holding him, just for one exhale. Instead Sherlock makes himself smile. “Of course not.” It sounds hollow to his own ears. “Why would it be?”
“Well, then.” John looks at him with a mischievous expression dancing across his face. He seems so unburdened, like this. As if walking across the threshold allowed him to shed a decade of pain. “Guess we’ll have to wait.”
His reputation of complete invulnerability was diminished by having children. By allowing Sherlock to bond to him, as well. By loving John. With every step Mycroft has taken closer to them, he has made himself appear more human and more approachable. But he can see the strength in those steps as well.
John tests his theory by opening the door and letting Sherlock walk through first, which he does without noticing. By holding a hand to Sherlock’s back as they walk to the table, which earns him a small glance. John draws the line at pulling the chair back for Sherlock, but when they sit, John takes Sherlock’s hand, and holds it, on the table.
There’s a heavy set bloke with pristine black and grey London Underground-themed sleeves who introduces himself as, “Hello, I’m Howard.”
Even Sherlock does not seem annoyed, as such, but still they do not have the sense of happiness that Mycroft had thought they would have.
If this pregnancy continues, there will be things to prepare. Material, practical things. To think of a name, medical appointments, of Violet and how he will manage caring for her when sick, or when he is much heavier. The list of details, whenever Mycroft considers it, is both long and intricate, but also well-planned already. This is not nearly as foreign as preparing for Violet’s arrival was. He has done all of it before, and he has a good idea of what will be needed and what will not be.
He is aware that he will need to go to Baker Street. There are already several texts from John that he has glanced at and then let dissipate in his mind.
“Yeah, he did.” Really, it’s a bit bizarre, isn’t it, asking your brother to have another kid? Then again, none of this has been normal from the moment Sherlock bonded to Mycroft. And the way Mycroft was talking... “I think he’s thinking about it?”
Both of them have been understanding and have tried not to press the issue, but Mycroft thinks that he can see it in them, regardless. Is John regretting doing this with him? Would he rather have had children with the woman he is currently dating - yes, Mycroft has kept a close eye on the CCTV, he knows who it is. She seems rather unappealing to him, but then he has rarely found women attractive.
It is unlikely that Sherlock would have ever bonded to someone else, not with John being a beta, but still it feels as if Mycroft has taken something from him that he never had any right to. A first bond, a giving of self, there is nothing as precious, and it does not belong to him.
“You can look through the florist’s website. Here...” Sherlock opens it on his phone. “What are your thoughts on the Sherwood’s Peach variety?”
He leaves the lube and condoms on the living room table, then very deliberately leans a small notebook along with a pen against the bottle of lube, so it is within the line of sight of anyone who walks in.
Once they all are gathered inside the studio, the production assistants direct them outside again and into two vans.
Sherlock looks stunning in his outfit. It’s a dark blue suit, one John’s never seen before, and it makes him look entirely delicious. As the door locks behind them and they head for the stairs, John says, “Now how on earth did I get
He feels another wave of dizziness and has to spend several minutes practicing very controlled breathing in a meeting in order not to faint. He sips a glass of water, hoping that it is not too obvious that he can hardly see because of the waves of black-and-white spots in front of his eyes. Mycroft still argues his point when called upon. Eloquently, he hopes.
It sounds desperate. A last-ditch effort. John shakes his head. “No, Sherlock.” No, he can’t let him do this. “No. We’re done.”
Whenever Mycroft comes by in the next few days, Sherlock eyes him in detail and considers Mycroft’s weight, health, and his general level of fitness. Mycroft catches him at it. “Sherlock, stop it.”
Sherlock wants to take Violet from Mycroft’s arms now, hold her and tell her that they’ll rage together if that’s what it takes.
Mycroft does very little for the rest of the afternoon. He has not taken time off to be sick for over a month now, so a preoccupation of his mind, while inconvenient, is not the end of the world. He feels that sometimes such a thing is allowed.
Mycroft does not know how to answer that question. Is John claiming that there is no difference in his sexual desire for him?
Sherlock dries off. Shaves, too, with strangely numb hands. He’s never dared to be angry with John before. Not like this. He can already feel it fade, retreat - he needs to adjust to keep John, he needs to…
The bright bathroom light feels overly intrusive when he turns it on. Mycroft avoids looking at his obscenely flushed face, and washes himself thoroughly, then goes back. John takes his turn, and Mycroft waits for him lying on top of the sheets, while his body is slowly cooling down. When John comes back into the bed, he pulls the covers over the both of them, leans over him and gives him a brief kiss. “That was great.”
He is not, and Mycroft is not certain whether John means that he would genuinely wish to come over, or whether it is simply part of what he is imagining.  “What would you like to do, John? M”
Mycroft feels a thread of doubt. Should he tell him? Was it not simply enough to hear it once? He glances around him again and sees nothing but a hired waiter duck into the dining room. “You said that you missed our friendship, that is all.”
Mycroft can feel his body tense, trying to draw more of John inside of him. His face is flushed and his body is throbbing with the sheer insult of what they are truly doing, but he cannot help but desire it. “Please.”
John takes a new set of pyjamas from the wardrobe and walks into the bathroom. He takes his clothes off, then turns the water on, and steps in. It rains down on his shoulders, hot, soothing his tense muscles.
John laughs, and he’s about to answer when Sherlock sends in rapid succession, “Also milk. SH” “Yes, really. SH” “Not a joke, is key ingredient in cauliflower ragout. SH” “...Apparently. SH” “If all else fails, pizza. SH”
Mycroft sleeps alone that night, on various strategically placed pillows, waking often to urinate or to change positions. He feels a faint sense of loneliness.
Sherlock drifts back over to John, so Mycroft checks on William - who is being comforted expertly by the nanny - and takes him to the bathroom for a nappy change.
Sherlock feels some anxiety now. Part of him would want to suggest to John leaving dinner altogether and spending the rest of the evening in bed, exploring one another. Another part of him is deeply wary of this. John is still just as married as he was a couple of days ago. John has an infant daughter at home.
Sherlock eyes him while they walk to the exit. John will need time to work on his stencil tonight. But he also requested to hear the Sicilian Mafia symbol case details later as a reward for his win, so does that mean he wishes for Sherlock to join him in the restaurant again?
The soldier smiles back. He comes in and, as expected, his eyes fall on the notebook immediately. Sherlock tilts his head towards it.
He sinks to his knees, but John catches him and guides him onto the sofa. Sherlock is still coming, spurting into the condom. The man behind him continues to fuck him, hard. It doesn’t take long.
That evening, Mycroft is lying in bed when he feels a shift inside of him, so small he thinks he imagined it. Until it happens again.
John feels the brush of Sherlock’s curls against his fingertips, and his breath sticks in his throat.
John manages to catch the burglar before Sherlock does, jumping onto his back, and Sherlock can feel his heart miss a beat when he sees John like that. John’s fast and rough, knocking the man out with two fast punches.
He can probably make it on his own, but John steps to the tree, leans down somewhat and tangles his fingers. “Come on, I’ll give you a boost.”
Molly Hooper tells him, when they are filing out of the building, “I think it’s so sweet that you did this for them.”
, not using, good, all of that. But Sherlock looks at Mycroft and reads the worry there. Sleepless nights that shouldn’t be there now he’s pregnant, the general state of him, and he knows that’s no longer true.
Mycroft often walks into 221b to see Sherlock reading while holding her, or on his laptop, or playing violin at her, occasionally even napping with her in his bed. Sherlock is always focused on Violet mainly, and Mycroft finds that to be admirable. He does not manage that intensity himself when he takes care of her. Mycroft’s mind is often far away, distracted by work, by how to solve problems, how to plan the day.
John touches his nipples again in return, and Mycroft gasps and spasms - John can feel it on his cock - for a long, hard moment, and then he relaxes again.
“Yes.” Sherlock turns on the bed, then says, “I had to watch, last time. When you got married.” Sherlock takes a breath. “He needed that.”
“I’m fine here.” John accepts it with his habitual calm. “Come on, sit. You too afraid to dirty those posh trousers?”
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, holding his laptop with a book spread out next to him that reads, ‘General Obstetrics in Omega Physiology’. Mycroft immediately feels a rush of annoyance - Sherlock does not need to know anything about that, why would he concern himself with… Mycroft suppresses it. It might be simple curiosity. A need to understand what happened between them.
John only need tend to the wound and yet he submerges the cloth again when he finishes but does not relinquish it to the bowl. Instead he squeezes out the reddening water and lifts it again to Sherlock’s face to clean away the blood that had slipped down his cheek. This is not the detached care of a doctor doing what he must. No, this is much more intimate in intent. The warm caress of the fabric has Sherlock’s eyes sliding shut.
Seeing the hurt in his eyes is like staring directly into a bright light and Sherlock can stand it no longer. He feels his steady fortitude quivering as he races to his feet and moves to the centre of the room.
John takes his hand and leads Sherlock to the dance floor. They fit together instantly. Sherlock puts a hand on John’s shoulder, one to his back, and it feels right. John leads comfortably, and they turn and sway.
The light shifts through the window and fades out. But Sherlock is still lying on the sofa, still pressing the thoughts away.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice sounds low and tense, but loud enough to carry through the church. “We picked this church, St.Barts, because it was a beginning.”
anything. But Sherlock never felt the same. And Father’s living there alone now. Sherlock thinks about it, then sends, “We should go. SH”
Sherlock hesitates. He did post the ad. He invited them here. He could lock the door if need be, but now that the drugs are singing inside of him, he craves sex. More than only the soldier will provide, as well. Sherlock wants all of them. Every single one.
It does not matter much, John is already completely soaked through with damp, dark patches on his jacket. His hair is wet and there are raindrops standing out on his pale face.
“I need condoms - a brand recommended for anal sex - and lubricant to be delivered to my current location.” Sherlock glances toward the door. “Room five hundred and ten.”
Sherlock is reviewing a police file about a Russian hacker - not exactly his area of expertise, but he finds the discrepancies interesting - when Mycroft walks in. John asked him to stay for dinner. And Mycroft has predictably grown a lot more tolerant now that he’s having sex again, because he agreed to it.
Only John kissed Mycroft, and Mycroft must have liked it somewhat, since he kissed him back - if he did not, he would certainly have mentioned it.
But John somehow assumes that his touch is wanted, because he puts one arm over Mycroft’s where he is holding Violet. Then the other to his side, and… holds him. Mycroft can feel the strange pressure of John’s body, and it releases something hot behind his eyes. He closes them, and breathes a shivering breath.
Mycroft looks at the both of them in turn. John, who is looking at him with some trepidation. Sherlock, who has Violet on his lap, and while she is not fully asleep, she is dreamy enough that she is curled to Sherlock’s chest with glassy eyes. Sherlock has a hand on her back, unconsciously soothing her.
He sits on the edge of the bed and holds on to his bedside table, the palms of his hands clammy. He stands with care. The room spins.
Mycroft does so gladly. John smiles against his mouth and moves into his hand. Mycroft kisses John lightly at first, then John just breathes against his lips and groans while his erection leaks in his grip. He is already close to finishing.
Mycroft gamely eats noodles from a cardboard box. John has Violet on his lap, and he is teaching her to use chopsticks while at the same time feeding her bites of assorted vegetables. Sherlock has William in one arm, and he’s one-handedly eating pieces of tofu. Occasionally he feeds one to John, too, which makes Mycroft roll his eyes at him until Sherlock tries to feed him one in retaliation.
Sherlock can’t stop thinking about it the whole afternoon, John with some woman. It feels like ants crawling in his stomach, under his skin. He could go to where John is having dinner, and tell him no. Tell him that the woman is a killer, anything. Of course, as far as Sherlock can tell there’s nothing wrong with her at all except a somewhat disturbing penchant for selfies. She tends to update her Instagram account an average of 3.7 times a day.
John wakes up hard nearly every morning. He can feel it when the water hits him just right in the shower, when his dressing gown rubs against him. At work, too. It’s starting to feel like an especially memorable week at uni when he was sitting next to... well, he forgets her name, only that there was a mini-skirt involved. She allowed him to slowly trace his fingers on the inside of her thigh during a boring lecture, and he fingered her, slow, afterwards being too hard to stand up for long, long minutes.
And why he let him think that the kid was his, because Sherlock never even said it. That he doubted Mary, that he wasn’t sure, that John should look into that. Instead, Sherlock was nothing but supportive, nothing but glad. And then he stayed away, of course, after the wedding, but some part of John had tried very hard to think that it was for the best. That he needed to be a father, now. A husband, for Mary. Be the sort of man who has a wife and a kid on the way. Settled.
It hurts. It’s impossible to live like this. Sherlock thinks of his young self again. The drugs didn’t stop it, but they made it bearable. They made his anger bubble to the surface and glide off him. They made his body feel lean and strong. They didn’t leave him like this - an ache, a walking need.
. Waking up with dried lube and ejaculate over him is never pleasant, so it’s very thoughtful of John. Sherlock cleans his hands, his face, and then his stomach, his cock, and between his legs. The towel comes away with a small streak of blood on it. John looks at it and swallows.
“No, go away.” Sherlock closes the door on her. He is certain that word of his undressed state will find its way back to Mycroft, but he cannot bring himself to care.
John stuffs his cock back into his pants, and then – fuck it, his legs are weak and he just came - sinks down onto the sofa.
Sherlock’s lying on the bed. He glances at him, but doesn’t move, or throw him out. That’s a lot already, John figures.
John tenses, but Sherlock barely notices it as he bites down again. It feels right. Needed. As if John is only complete when he has Sherlock’s teeth right there.
“Cause I wanted a good cuppa, you went outside the hotel to god knows where to get me some. But I’m not allowed to
It is the baby Jesus from the nativity scene. She gives it to him as if she believes it is the thing he most desires, and Mycroft makes certain to praise her. “Why, thank you, Violet.”
John texts Mycroft, “Haven’t been able to wear the suit on a date, I think it’s cursed. Does your tailor do repairs? JW”
John lingers. John kisses between his shoulder blades, then the middle of his back. He scrapes his teeth and sucks the skin there while Mycroft can feel himself twitch. John says, his voice heavier, “Oh, you’re
He can hear John ask Mrs. Hudson to stay downstairs. Sherlock walks into his room, but leaves the door open. John will want to butt in. Sherlock falls down on the bed, and John does appear in the doorway, and asks, “What do you want to do?”
“No, we need to talk about it.” John’s sure of that much at least. “Because if we don’t, I’ll do it again. I’ll sleep with him again. But I am
It is after eight when Mycroft can finally leave the office, and he still takes some work with him for when Violet is asleep.
The words mean much more than that, and Mycroft understands them for what they are. It means that he is welcome in Sherlock’s home, still. That Sherlock has, miraculously, chosen to forgive him this trespass.
Mycroft’s waiting for him by the entrance, shielded by an umbrella. “John. Do you have a moment?” Mycroft nods towards a coffee shop across the road.
Sherlock tries to bond with John again, at night. He just sleepily noses John’s neck, and John groans and says, “Could I? God, it’s been so long, do you mind if I…”
that comes along with it. John settles against him. The movement leaves his neck exposed and right next to Sherlock’s lips.
over Mycroft. All that fucking - it was intense, crazy, and he knew it was just temporary, of course he did. But still John can feel nothing but wanting that to have lasted forever.
It seems as if he’s not about to let go of her any time soon, so John pulls up a chair for Sherlock that he sits himself down on with care not to jostle her. John puts a chair for himself next to him. He’s not nearly as enamoured with her as Sherlock seems to be, so he looks at Mycroft instead. “Did it go okay, then?”
Mycroft looks up, stunned. It feels entirely bizarre to get such high praise from Sherlock. He answers, uncertain but willing to return the compliment to Sherlock as well, “Violet is being raised by all of us.”
Mycroft, in fact, has no idea how it is. He has never attempted to host a social gathering of any kind in his home, and if he did, he would hire a professional service to deal with all the preparation and decoration. But he keeps Violet out of trouble for the next fifteen minutes while Sherlock and John and Mrs. Hudson set up all around him. And when the doorbell rings, Mycroft even does the honours and goes to open the door to Inspector Lestrade and Miss Hooper, Violet on his arm.
They order, and John jokes, “So, you’re good with sharing being married to your work with being married to me, then?”
Dimmock comes by to collect him. They all agree on giving the statements tomorrow, see them off, and then Sherlock and John walk back, taking the same shortcut through the gardens.
“Didn’t even know you two knew each other.” Then again, Mike seems to know everyone there is to know in the business.
Sherlock seems to think this is all seriousness, because as soon as John missteps and laughs, Sherlock puts a hand on his back and says, “Leg, there, now like that... Keep up, Mycroft!”
Sherlock gets into bed behind him. He crawls close to the warm line of John’s body, and it feels unexpectedly comforting. Sherlock smells John’s neck, and John huffs a laugh. He seems happy. John always has with this, with the thought that he wants him, maybe? Sherlock doesn’t know. Sherlock carefully licks John’s neck. He can feel John hold himself still.
“No!” There seems to be something blurring his eyes, pressing on his chest, and burning in his nose, but he breathes through it.
Because that is what it comes down to. Both Sherlock and John suffered through that night along with him and did what they did for him. Or for the promise of his child, but it is hard to see the difference between the two, and it seems naïve to even seek it at this point. Why would they care for some potential future? For some image that Mycroft desires, the idea of this child in his arms?
They walk into the hospital, and Sherlock takes a soft little breath before they reach Mycroft’s room that makes John smile again. He’s
Anthea gives him a smile. Then, as she turns away to continue working, she says, clearly, “Congratulations on your wedding, sir.” She glances back at him.
John doesn’t let go of Sherlock’s hand until they’re safely in the car. It’s one of Mycroft’s black ones, for just the two of them. John asks, “You okay?”
in the same scenario, and blanks. Then laughs a little, and tries to shake the a-bit-too-close-to-home-ness of it. “Well, he would, wouldn’t he? Say that.”
Mycroft had assumed that he would have to try more than once, and then text, but Sherlock answers on the third ring. “Yes?”
Sherlock waits a moment, and John appears. Violet passes him by, crawls onto the sofa, and tells Sherlock, “I did a wee-wee! On the big toilet!”
The doorbell rings right after that, and Sherlock goes to let Molly and Lestrade in. And yes, Molly is carrying a gift wrapped in an alarming shade of pink.
The group is visibly shrinking. Sherlock is relatively certain that he himself will continue to do well in the competition – his talent is superior to most, if not all artists here - but with tattooing, not challenges such as this one.
He kneels on the bed. John pulls Sherlock towards him to lie down. John receives a bump of an elbow and a nose-full of curls, but then he has Sherlock lying down next to him.
The moment the front door closes, Sherlock can feel his knees unlock. His legs give out in an appalling, slow-motion moment and he barely manages to sit down on the bed before the rush of dizziness overtakes him. He hangs his head between his knees and breathes.
When the dim morning light grows brighter, John drags himself out of bed. He showers, and then makes sure he’s downstairs first for once. Sherlock got him coffee, so this time, it’s John’s turn.
Oh. So Sherlock has left him, then? Is that it? John looks at the phone. His finger lingers over the call button. He needs to know.
Sherlock is not to blame for thinking that he can invade his personal space like that, not when they have been doing this for such a long time now. But Mycroft already feels such pressure on his body, such tenseness, he cannot stand another second of scrutiny.
Irene announces, “Today’s challenge has been set by Mike, and it will concern his speciality: old school.”
Then how is he pregnant? Mycroft’s lost four pounds, there are dark shadows under his eyes, he is tired but stable, otherwise he wouldn’t have come here. There’s the smell, again, his body chemistry is announcing it loud and clear. Sherlock’s not sure, but it’s a logical leap, a needed precaution when having a child alone. “You’re on chemical bonding hormones?”
John asks it hopefully, but the truth is that it does. They are closer than they should be. Mycroft has allowed himself too much. So Mycroft says, aware that it is not the answer that John wishes for, “I believe some distance between us will be necessary.”
The time ticks down. John’s done before the cut off, so he takes care to wipe the skin down and clean his workspace before Mike even announces, “Three, two, one… Machines down!”
“All right, why don’t you come down here? Show us how it’s done.” John looks at Violet and asks her, “What do you think, do you want two horses?”
But Sherlock seems properly chastised, because when Mycroft arrives the next day with Violet at five minutes before seven - loaded down with Violet’s bag and three bottles of excellent wine - Sherlock is already downstairs, hastily attaching some greenery to the staircase.
Which was a mistake, because John seems suddenly filled with anger. “Why didn’t you call? Or text? I came home and there was nothing, tried to reach you, nothing! Sherlock, I thought you...” John sucks in a breath. “You can’t do this! You can’t disappear like that.”
John takes Violet to one of the children’s interactive afternoons in the Southbank Centre. She’s allowed to play with puppets, and John takes a pic of that and sends it to Mycroft. At least that’s safe.
Sherlock is still a bit loath to give up on doing the bathing and feeding himself though, because it’s so important that it’s done correctly.
Half an hour later, John still has both William and Violet on his lap. Violet is frequently rubbing her eyes while John reads her
The judges appear in the hangar like a flock of vultures. Once again, they are ready to tell the contestants what they have done wrong in performing a skill that most of them have never even attempted before today. A tattoo artist is a specialist; Sherlock’s precision is in his designs and his eye for detail, not in spraying paint onto a wall like a teenage hoodie.
Sherlock takes the lighter back and lights his own cigarette, shielded from the wind. “According to Volko, this style is a combination of realism and trash. It is about nature and the abstract, technology and humanity, opposites that they are trying to combine into a creative dance.”
But the thing is, he isn’t even enjoying this. John empties his pint and puts it down. He’s thinking about Sherlock at home. He’s sweating. The pub is crowded, loud, overrun by people having a better time than he is. He feels vaguely nauseous.
John seems to be in a great mood, his grins linger and shine on in his eyes even as his mouth relaxes. John reaches out his hand over the table, and Sherlock takes it in his.
Mycroft kisses him deeply once more while he moves his hand and swipes his thumb over the head, and then John is coming, into his grip. “Ah!”
John sits down on the bench. Mycroft sits next to him. It’s directly in the sun, and it is unbearably hot, so he loosens his cuffs and rolls his sleeves up. First one, then the other.
Mycroft focuses on the question and tries to answer it to the best of his ability. “I believe it would depend heavily on his interests.” He thinks through Violet’s toys and what she is most interested in right now, then ages them up. “Books, but only if they are about a topic he would enjoy. A train set, fire engine, anything machinery related. Balls, games, anything with speed to underscore a competitive nature. Something that can be played with outside, can take some force and is not easily destroyed. Marbles, building blocks, or Legos. A remote controlled car, perhaps? Not something that flies, as that is harder to steer and more fragile.”
Mycroft is aware that John would continue this just as eagerly if Mycroft were to keep his remaining clothing on, but he starts on his shirt buttons, trapped between them. Mycroft finishes the row of buttons, opens his shirt, shrugs it off, and then removes his undershirt. He gradually presses his naked body to John’s, and he is considering the feeling of skin against skin - he has missed this - when John asks, “You know what I was thinking?”
John takes a huge sheet of paper and routinely outlines the available space while he thinks about what the hell he’s going to tattoo. There’s no way he can do a full back piece on this bloke in twelve hours. Not old school for sure. Maybe Janine can splash some watercolour on there and call it a back piece, but with old school there’s heavy coverage, deep blacks and colour – to do this right would take at least twenty, if not more hours. John has done back pieces with over forty hours of work in there.
Sherlock spends a lot of time with Mrs. Hudson going over the details, because John’s eyes tend to glaze over when Sherlock gives him too much information in one sitting. And Mycroft claims that he has work to do and ‘Please Sherlock, you cannot come here every single day!’ So Mrs. Hudson it is. She’s not particularly insightful when it comes to planning, but she is very willing to listen and feed him biscuits and tea.
His temperature lowers, but that does not mean anything. He does not need to be taking it anymore, but Mycroft continues to do so at the same time every morning, and the number brushes his mind during the day. During a meeting. In the car, when being driven to an interrogation. Thirty-seven point one. The next day, thirty-six point nine. It does not mean much, but it is the only tangible thing he has.
Sherlock thinks that John will ask why he hasn’t received it, why, but John just nods, and reaches for a piece of toast. He starts spreading butter over it with a knife.
John hurries through the crowd, leaning heavily on his cane. He takes the corridor towards the exit, throws the door open, but Sherlock’s not there, like he assumed. He’s not under the awning, either. Thinking about it, John’s not even sure he saw Sherlock go this way. Did he go backstage instead?
“Hm.” John looks back at his breakfast and keeps on eating. His bathrobe sleeve nearly crosses his plate as he reaches for his tea again.
Old-fashioned father she looked up to, but raised by a weak mother figure - Sherlock adds it to his mental map of Molly Hooper, then focuses on the corpse again. Why are there no edges on the wounds?
Sherlock leans over the soldier, and then wraps his hand around the soldier’s cock again. It rises to his touch. The soldier licks his lips. Sherlock moves his hand, fast, and his gaze turns to pure lust. He leans his head against the door, looks up at him, and simply breathes, showing him the arousal in his face so clearly.
Mrs. Hudson is asked to dance by John next, who claims, “...second dance is with the mother of the bride!” She seems both mildly offended and touched to be referred to as Sherlock’s mother, even if only in jest.
Violet opens her presents. Most are plastic and pink and will be left at Baker Street, Mycroft will not have any of it in his house, but he still thanks them politely.
The throbbing is coming from the right side, not the left, and it feels deep like a migraine. The other is a constant undercurrent of aching pain radiating from his left temple — less easy to distinguish in the wake of the intolerable throbs. His hand ventures experimentally to his forehead and he winces at the sudden stinging sensation emanating from the wet patch he finds there. So rare it is to see his own blood these days that he examines it with detached astonishment as it comes away with his fingers.
“This may sting a little,” John tells him as he wrings excess water from the cloth back into the bowl. Sherlock simply nods and folds his hands in his lap, leaning forward when John gestures for him to do so. It does sting. Quite a lot more than expected when coupled with the headache already over-stimulating his pain receptors. Sherlock inhales sharply and jerks away when John presses the cloth to his temple.
The life they share between these walls is Sherlock’s private refuge away from the chaos of the outside world. There is stillness in their domesticity, in John’s smiling face, in their shared laughter, and in their comfortable silences. It’s his favourite place to think: brainwork flows unobstructed. It’s his favourite place to
“Rather overzealous first aid kit, John. You could tend to an army with all that you’ve got in there.”
Answering the call of John’s concern will shift them from their natural logarithm: John would change his comfortable patterns and so, too, would Sherlock. It is simple cause and effect — inevitable, and some things are better off the way they are. Sherlock has not spent a lifetime developing methods to shut out emotion for no good reason. Even for John, he will not surrender to the pull of it.
He wonders if he fainted and why, because he doesn’t feel particularly exhausted and feels adequately watered and fed. He notes, however, that the oppressive headache that he’s had on and off for weeks was particularly unforgiving this morning. Or was it yesterday? Recently, at least. It’ll come to him when his head isn’t pounding.
He has always been under the impression that Sherlock will share with him as John does with Sherlock. It’s an unspoken agreement that Sherlock imagines plays a part of any intimate domesticity. But it is precisely that: unspoken — assumed — and Sherlock does not hold any credence for assumptions in lieu of concrete agreement. He knows that he does not owe John an explanation.
There’s another sharp sting that has Sherlock opening his eyes wide again and the moment is gone in an instant, as always. He mourns the loss as he watches John dabbing antiseptic around the wound with a fresh cotton ball. When he’s done with that he rummages around in his overstuffed first aid kit. Rolls of bandages, boxes of plasters, and safety pins fall over the edges and onto the table as he finally reaches the bottom and pulls out a box of Steri-Strips.
John presses his fingers carefully over the final strip and examines his work for a moment before sitting back. His expressive face is so awash with worry that it’s almost sickening to look at. It twists strangely in Sherlock’s gut.
Of course John would know: he’s a doctor. The bruising is surely only red beneath the skin at this point but it will begin its cycle through colours by the morning. Sherlock finds he has little desire to think about it, but it will serve as a constant reminder every time he looks in the mirror, or sees the reaction on other people’s faces.
“I’m fine, John, honestly,” Sherlock says. He’s well aware of the reassuring power of touch, especially when it is so rare between them, so places his hand on John’s shoulder. He’s unsurprised when John’s eyes flicker to this new gesture as if not quite believing it true. “You needn’t worry.”
It’s well into the afternoon before John ignores the lingering headache, grabs a bin bag, and starts cleaning up. Some of the wrapping paper has travelled all the way into the bedroom, and the hall. He tries not to groan every time he bends over and his skull throbs.
Sherlock knows that he cannot count on John’s continuing desire. Or friendship. Or willingness to even admit to knowing him. But then that is a truth he accepted when he decided to allow this. Sherlock had expected that John would have a crisis of morality in the middle of their first time. Or right after. That he would turn on him with nothing but his self-hate projected outwards – Sherlock has seen it often enough.
Inspector Lestrade looks between them, still grinning, although he can pick up on Sherlock’s seriousness and sobers. “Then what?”
Sherlock doesn’t see why he should lie about it. “Yes.” It doesn’t say anything about desire. Or love, or anything like that. John must know that.
Especially when the baby was born. John saw them work on it, first a doctor’s finger in the baby’s mouth trying to clear any mucus. Then they used the aspirator, without any results.
John bends his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder, and breathes into his coat. The ground is hard and wet and it’s dirty. Sherlock’s hand isn’t nearly slow enough and sort of hurts, actually, he’s not
children, John and Mary’s. That he would have to love John from afar for the rest of his life, never really having him close. Sherlock had been prepared to do that.
The same for the child he has inside of him - Mycroft instinctively wants to turn away and keep the baby safe.
Mike takes the lead again and says, “The theme of tomorrow’s elimination tattoo will be… trash polka.”
He decides and looks back at the client. “I need to see the area again, then draw up a different stencil that suits the desired body part.”
He does not, instead Sherlock observes carefully as they are instructed on how to use a cotton ribbon to attach a cluster of needles to a stick of bamboo, and how to dip the stick into ink, then poke a design into the uncooperative pig skin.
He sits down with a serious expression and tells him quietly, “Concerning John... I imagine we need to have a discussion.”
But he knows why. Every single person they pass by turns towards them when they realise that this tall man in the coat smells like sex on legs.
Sherlock reaches over and squeezes Mrs. Hudson’s hand, too. She smiles a watery smile. “Love you, my dear.”
After they’ve walked out of the woman’s house and her offer of tea, they hear back from Dr. Barnett. “It’s not numbers at all, it’s a letter-by-letter spelling. It spells S-H-E-R-L-O-C-K H-O-L-M-E-S.”
“She is perfectly fine. Seventy-three, fond of tea and daytime television.” Sherlock glances at her. “She is also, incidentally, my landlady.”
The space is set up well though. They’ve all got their own small shop with a tattooing bench and enough space to move around, so they’re not as packed together as John thought ten artists in one room might be. The downside of that is that he can’t see the artists further down at all. Some are wandering around and having peeks at each other’s tattooing already, but John’s not that bothered. He’ll focus on his own work first.
Mycroft can follow John’s reasoning. He can understand the pain of wanting a child and not being able to have one. But that does not mean that this is a sensible idea in any way, shape, or form. It offers a near-endless chain of complications, of thoughts, considerations, fears and doubts.
Everything else shifts uncontrollably beneath his feet and sometimes he hates that he cannot control it. But the flat is a constant and offers a sense of tranquillity he’s never known before. He steps through the threshold and sheds his carefully constructed armour and, with it, shakes off the stresses of bearing the weight of the world; such vulgar things have no place on this hallowed ground. He’s seen it happen before, when he succumbed to mindless emotion, and it nearly destroyed him every time.
, in fact, and he’s always foolishly thought it resistant to the infection of his own tendencies towards despair.
Yet the way he hunches over rouses the same twist in Sherlock’s stomach and he casts his eyes to the floor in uncommon shame. He draws his lip between his teeth and worries it slowly until a solution comes to him: there is a way to make John feel involved while Sherlock remains comfortably detached.
The world moves so fast from moment to moment, time moving perpetually forward. Sherlock is powerless to the rapid flow of it until John pulls him from the stream and then he’s no longer a passenger. When he’s with John, Sherlock feels suspended in time and space for the briefest moments. They are like a pocket of warmth in the cold, endless expanse and he lounges within them comfortably, seeing everything in a clarity he never thought possible. But they are far too few and are eternally slipping through his fingers as he tries to hold onto them — tries to hold onto John — but he always returns to the stream.
The throbbing fades slowly, as does the vertigo when he starts tentatively turning his head to examine the scene around him and decipher the facts. By the careless way his violin lies face-down beside him, with the bow tossed over to the other side, Sherlock deduces that they must have been dropped during a fall. The sharp, constant pain in his skull is clearly the result of blunt force trauma. The window is closed and locked and there are no foreign objects in his vicinity, so what struck him did not come from outside. He fell, so it is more likely that he bashed his head on something on his way to the floor rather than an object knocking him unconscious. The only surface within the circumference of the site of his landing is the desk to his right. The edge of it is severe enough to have split his skin over the point of impact.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says earnestly as he smoothes the wrinkles from his pyjama shirt and repositions his dressing gown over his shoulders.
Something has struck him — that much is clear. Exactly what, though, is still a mystery. He blinks slowly as he tries to recall the events that led him to be spread out on the carpet, but everything in his mind is slow to reboot. Concussion? Perhaps. But that does little to explain the God awful pangs of pain reaching deep into the right side of his brain.
John does not follow as expected. His arms are moving slowly, fingers rubbing along his jeans to remove the traces of adhesive left on them. His shoulders sag visibly when he’s finished and his head tilts forwards; the posture of a defeated man. Sherlock imagines the expression on his face is devastating and is glad to be well out of its path.
He strains his ears for the slightest bump of feet on the floorboards upstairs but the only response is the sound of distant car horns. He thinks he may be panicking a little with the combination of unpleasant sensations all at once. His heart is thudding in his ears and the rush of blood to his aching head is clouding his judgement. John may not be here but he can still assist by facilitating a sense of order; Sherlock scours his brain for any sliver of information regarding his whereabouts to take him back to a place of calm.
“Tell me what you think happened,” Sherlock says and John meets his eyes suddenly, widening his own in surprise at the demand.
“If you were anyone else, that would be the case,” he sighs, willing John to understand, “Yours is the only second opinion I’d ever value, John.”
“I got the milk! We can have proper tea now,” John’s voice sounds from the hallway, thick with enthusiasm. It’s the tail end of something he must have said before parting and couldn’t wait to exclaim before even making it through the threshold. He couldn’t have been out for long then.
He hates not understanding things — even the littlest things — because he’s too clever to not know. If he doesn’t fill in the blanks it will irritate him like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. It’s clear he’ll need assistance with this and there’s only one person capable of refocusing Sherlock’s lens when the problem is at a distance.
The pounding has lost its novelty as an entirely new level of sensation once it’s been catalogued away for later reference. Cradling his head in his hands offers no reprieve, neither does threading his fingers into his hair and twisting harshly. It’s harder to think with the throbbing greedily hoarding his attention, letting it go for a second only to draw it back again. Slowly he registers the presence of two different pains, not just one, and they become more distinct the more he concentrates.
John is a woefully predictable man despite believing himself capable of spontaneity — although, sometimes he really does manage it, like when he shot the cab driver and made Sherlock take extreme, thrilling notice of him — but for the most part, his routine is rigidly structured. He rarely deviates, even from his little routine proclivities: usually he announces to the living room that he is going out on the off-chance that Sherlock is listening, but he can’t recall hearing his voice. Sherlock always hears him but rarely acknowledges it in favour of begrudging the sharpness of his senses when he desires utter sensory deprivation in order to think clearly. Yet, when he tries to remember any of the day’s events, he comes up empty. He can’t recall even seeing John at all today. It doesn’t make sense; he seeks John out every morning in the same way reptiles seek the sun.
He sits cross-legged on the floor, not trusting his own stability if he were to attempt standing. He doesn’t fancy falling over or emptying his stomach onto the carpet, so he simply waits for normality to return.
The data is much too broad to draw definitive conclusions from and it leaves him frustrated. It is most likely an isolated incident so not worth too much brainwork — it’s not the first time Sherlock has fainted, after all. The pain in the right side of his brain is an unfamiliar kind but it is fleeting, so Sherlock decides to leave it filed away. He knows the dangers of dwelling and allowing dubious ideas to fester and grow unfettered. If another incident occurred and advanced the symptoms, giving him more to work with, he would revisit the issue.
