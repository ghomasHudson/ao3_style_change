“Peanut butter and jelly are my favorite,” Castiel responded.
“I happen to like both equally.” He reached for the soup, taking in a few bites, letting his brother stew for a bit. “The last person I dated was a women, Meg, if you remember.”
Jody looked him up and down. “The moms in the grade will take advantage of the cute, naïve, single father.”
“Fuck,” he whispered. He doesn’t often curse but he’s already running behind and he has to drop Jack off at the summer day camp which is at the YMCA across town from the resource center.
Castiel surveyed the apartment with a smile. Luke had left three days ago for a ski trip with Kelly, and then he was going straight home for Christmas. Kelly said that her parents didn’t mind him coming along, but he knew that Luke would. Besides, he had better plans. They had an entire month off for winter break, and he had almost two weeks before his parents expected him home. Two glorious weeks to himself, and a few days that he could spend alone with Alfie.
“No, Westport actually. When I got out of the service I decided to move here. My brother Gabriel lived here, and there was a veteran’s resource center. When Jack was born, I stayed because the rent was cheap and Anna had moved close by. How about you?”
He waited for a nod.
“Were you a soldier?” Alex questioned.
Castiel saw the women who had fixed his computer carrying a box with children following her. “Go right ahead.” He watched as he ran away and surveyed the yard. “What now?” he asked Sam. The taller man clapped him on the back and led him over to a table where he at least recognized Eileen.
“Can he make those burgers he promised?”
“That’s a bit of an understatement, but I’ll take it,” Ash said, then leaned close to Castiel. “Charlie is a computer genius, can hack anything. I, on the other hand, like to dabble. Statistics, physics…”
“We shouldn’t speak ill of the dead.” Castiel looked at his younger sister and she wrapped her arms around him, knowing she had to be the one to initiate the affection. “How am I supposed to care for a baby? I live in a one-bedroom apartment, the VA has me in therapy twice a week, and I have a dead-end bookkeeper job.”
“Well it doesn’t change the fact that I sincerely appreciate that you are here. I’m just surprised that you said you haven’t been around kids.”
“Truth be told I haven’t been on a date in a while. I don’t remember how you’re supposed to act.”
“You are a saint, Jody,” Castiel said as he walked through her front door.
“I apologize for my rudeness, but you knocked at an inopportune time and I—”
The drive to the veteran’s resource center from his apartment was less than 10 minutes. As he drove, he looked at Jack tucked in his car seat in the back. Life with him was not better, but not worse. It was different. A part of him was thankful for the child. He gave his life purpose and direction. One that he had been sorely lacking when he reentered civilian life.
Castiel does just that. Typically, Jack is a light sleeper. Sleeping was a fight when he was younger. If he was his biological son he would question if insomnia was genetic. However tonight he is out cold. Summer camp combined with a movie marathon and a crash from whatever sugar Gabriel gave him seemed to be the perfect sleeping aid. By the time he gets home, Jack has woken up enough to brush his teeth and put on his pajamas. Castiel tucked him into bed and went to leave.
The year prior he had lived in the dorms, but his mother promised to pay for a nice off campus apartment if he agreed to live with Luke who attended law school at the same university. The two had not gotten along as children and it was even worse as adults. Luke had strings of women that he brought home even though he claimed to be dating Kelly. Not only that but his study habits were lazy, and a few times Castiel had caught him in the act of what had to be cheating. “Did he tell you what this dirt was?”
This was enough of a head start as he added the onions and the ham to the pan. By the time he added the eggs, Dean and Jack were getting out bread for toast. It was so much easier with just a bit more help. By the time he sat down Dean was making Jack bubble with laughter. Castiel looked between the two of them and was hit with a stunning realization. He was falling in love with Dean Winchester.
After Jack goes inside, he walks around the house and finds Deans in coveralls, splattered with small amounts of paint. “Just finishing touches, I’ll be out of your hair soon.”
“Nothing, a lot of Sam’s work friends aren’t too patient with me.”
Castiel goes upstairs with Jack to help him locate his favorite light blue and white striped shirt. He knew he should make the girls pack up their own bags, but instead he folds up their pajamas. He’s surprised that the girls are both sitting at the table, laughing. Dean is in the kitchen frowning.
“I never came to the beach much when I was younger. My dad loved it, could spend hours just talking about nature. My mom and siblings and I thought it was just wet and cold.” Castiel let his body relax, leaning into Dean’s warm side. “It was one of the things I missed the most. I guess spending months in a desert can do that to you.” Castiel turned his body and his face was inches from Dean. He’d never been this close to him. He could see the light freckles dusted across his face and make out the different flecks of green in his eyes. “But I have a feeling we’re not just here for the view.”
“Oh, no, I’m actually volunteering…” He leaned his head back, likely trying to get Jack to let go. “Does he do this with his mother?” Sam asked as he innocently laughed.
Castiel throat tightened. “Of course, they would be. I would never let anyone into my life that wasn’t nice to you.” He opened his arm and Jack gave him a hug. When they pulled away, he decided the topic wasn’t finished. “What would you think if daddy’s special friend was a boy?”
Castiel watched as Dean climbed in his truck and drove away. He stood there for a few seconds before Jack called him over into the backyard, tearing him out of his thoughts.
“If something happens, I want you to take care of him. You would be such a good father Castiel.” She squeezed his hand tightly. “I know it’s a lot to ask, but you were always there for me. Even when you were overseas you still kept in contact. Still listened to me complain about my job and Luke.” She set the phone down and reached for his hand to squeeze. “The only other option is my parents. Maybe they’ll want to meet Jack someday, but Cas…I trust you.” Tears flowed down her cheeks. “Besides if he lived with my parents, he wouldn’t have your dad or Gabriel or Anna looking out for him.”
“I have a favor to ask.”
Castiel had been crouching down, he rose and that’s when he felt his phone vibrate. While he normally would try to keep his phone usage a minimum around Jack, lately he’d at least check it. “One moment, Jack… Hello, Gabriel.”
“You play poker?” Dean questioned.
“Oh, well let’s get to business.” He stepped out of the house and gestured to the roof. “When I bought the house a year ago, they said it should last for a few more years, but I am starting to doubt that.” He stopped and blinked a few times. “Once again, being rude. Castiel Novak, you came highly recommended by your brother.”
“Involved? Please give me the details.”
Dean would be lying if he said that he was disappointed the next time he showed up at Castiel’s house to work on the roof he was gone. He supposed that meant he kept regular hours because he would show up at nine and the shiny Prius would be gone. He supposed it would be for the best. It wasn’t like he could hide anything from Benny, and Garth was surprisingly perceptive.
“No, I can’t miss group meeting again.”
“It’ll be an hour,” Dean responded, and arranged things in a neat order on the counter. He didn’t speak again until Jack has bolted upstairs to retrieve a toy. “Good thing he didn’t seen the buns, they’re made with white flour.” He walked over to wrap Castiel in a hug planting a kiss on his cheek. “These are okay, right? I forgot you’re a health nut.”
“Shut up!” Castiel got to his feet, stalking over to his brother. Luke is a bit taller, but in the past few years Castiel had gained quite a bit of muscle. His brother was not a threat to him, not anymore.
“She was right,” Dean said. “I mean granted my bar for a good father is not that high, but Jack seems happy. And from what I seen you’d give June Cleaver a run for her money as far as parents go.”
Dean didn’t know what to expect, but Castiel got out a sauce pan along with cocoa powder, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt. With practiced patience the man stared at the stove waiting for milk to boil and whisking the ingredients together. “You can change if you want. There is bathroom in my room, first one at the top of stairs. You can also change in the spare room downstairs.”
“I saw it on your face when I said it was nice for dad’s to be involved. Besides, us single parents have a radar.”
He couldn’t really tell Jack the truth yet. Castiel did the best of not hiding it, of keeping a photo with Luke and Kelly with the rest of the photos of his family. He tried to see if he could recognize his brother’s features in Jack, but he was all Kelly. He saw her in Jacks smile and his eyes and his hair.
“I’m not fighting with you, please just leave.”
“Buddy I’m sure—”
“I don’t want to stay somewhere I’m not welcome.”
“Let me help grab the dessert.”
“Babysitting again?” Dean said as the children came to follow him to the window, but he didn’t wait for an answer as he began to examine it.
A few hours later, the kids are darting around the park zoo Castiel and Dean call out to them stay within sight. Well, Dean ends up being the one to call out. He’s much louder and for whatever reason Claire seems to pay more mind to it than Castiel’s voice. He suspects it’s because Dean is naturally louder so it doesn’t come off as angry.
“It was daddy’s idea.”
It turns out that Dean was thrilled to be invited to the zoo. He admitted to Castiel that he didn’t give a damn about the zoo, but was excited to spend the day together even if it involved three children. He hoped that sentiment was still true, because Castiel was worn thin by the time he woke up Saturday morning. Jody was pulling a twelve-hour shift, 5am-5pm so Castiel insisted that the girls spend the night so they didn’t have to coordinate mornings.
He grabbed it as he walks into the house. “Where is everyone?”
“I’ve shown you mine already,” Dean replied with a grin across his face. “Come on, it’s just your brother. What’s the matter?”
“Maybe I worry too much, but
“Hello,” she greeted.
While the children began the walk ahead, Dean put the backpack on. Castiel reached for his hand and then gave him a short, chaste kiss. Not caring who saw. It felt good to have Dean’s rough hand in his own as they walked. In the butterfly exhibit the children were delighted as they looked around the humid room filed with wild vegetation and flittering butterflies in every color of the rainbow.
“I was hoping you came for other reasons.” Castiel laid a hand on his thigh with a smile. “But sure.”
Castiel supposed they were, but not on purpose. He was wearing a button down and slacks. “You are right. How funny.” He held out his hand and looked him over. “I suppose it is time to set out. You have everything.”
“No one would believe you.”
“We are not family.” The words come out slowly, like he can’t believe what Dean had said.
“Live action role play. It’s like acting out the Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. She made Sam and I play once, but you’d have to ask her any questions.” Dean continued to shovel the pasta in his mouth. “This is good. I don’t even like eating vegetables usually.” He paused and turned to Jack. “Forget I said that. Vegetables are great. They’re so good, it’s all rabbits eat.”
“Yeah, it’s just…”
“Jody you apologized enough already. Besides it was an accident, I should have been watching them more closely.”
“Come on. That whole dad vibe you have going on works great for some of the clients. A lot of them have some major unresolved father issues.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said in the doorway.
“Perhaps I want you wearing my clothes,” he whispered, then goes to nip at his ear.
“No rush,” Castiel said, trying to force his voice to sound casual and breezy. “I actually wanted to know if you would want to stay for dinner.”
“Jack.”
“None for me.”
By the time Dean was knocking at his door, the house had descended into chaos. Or at least chaos in Castiel’s book. Jack was in his pajamas, Claire’s hair needed to be done, breakfast needed to be eaten, and lunch was only half-packed.
Dean waited for him to hand him one. The dish towel wasn’t one of the cheap terry cloth ones he had, but one of the thin towels with embroidered flowers on it. “I looked at the pictures upstairs.”
“Please Dean. No secrets from me.” The man closed the distance between them, hand gong to rub his arm. “Why don’t I make tea?”
“Dean…” Castiel said softly. The words that he repeated every day at work die in his mouth. Because Dean was not the soldier that came home from the war zone. He was the son of someone that did. Someone who never should have put that much weight on a small child’s shoulders. Perhaps this is what Sam referenced.
“Dean’s a real softie when he likes someone.”
“Just tell me what you want to know.” Castiel looked at the sandwich and decided to try to eat again.
“Thank you for dinner. It looks delicious,” Jack said as Castiel helped him load his plate.
Castiel wiped a hand over his face. As he stared at the face of the tiny child, he was responsible for. Anna and him stood there for a while until Gabriel found them. To his surprise, Gabriel laid a hand on his shoulders and said nothing. It was then he realized it was another small miracle he didn’t re-enlist. He still didn’t know if he believed in God, but there had to be a reason that this small child was in his life.
“I have a bag full of stuff.”
“Be careful, don’t play too close to the house but stay in sight of the kitchen windows,” he said and then looked to Alex. “Please keep an eye on them.”
When he first meets with clients, they typically speak about goals. He gets to know if they have specific goals or rather just things they need help working on. Fergus is a bit different. He found a job that he seems to be particularly good at, a salesman of some sort. Castiel frequently works with veterans that have just come home, ones that have trouble adjusting. By the end of the session, Castiel nearly had a headache just from listening to him speak and sheer volume of information that he had given him.
“Ooh scary dad voice.” He had a smirk on his face. “And we don’t gossip. Anna is the only one that will tell me anything. Getting information out of you and Michael is like… I can’t think of a comparison, but it’s hard. The only reason I know anything about you is because of Jack.”
Dean texted him the address of Charlie’s apartment and told him not to worry about bringing anything. It felt wrong going empty handed so he made cookies. Even before Dean he baked. Emotions were difficult, but baking was simple mix of science and math. Why should he think of words when he could bring them something that spoke volumes? He made Anna lemon meringue pie whenever she had something to celebrate; Michael was a frequent recipient of his oatmeal raisin cookies when he complained about a difficult work week. For Gabriel he would bring a chocolate cake as a token of appreciation. Now he was showing up with a plate full of snickerdoodles because Jack had requested them for home and making a double batch was the easiest thing to do.
“Enough about me.” Castiel followed her actions, sweeping the crumbs off the desk in his cupped hand. “Any new exciting revelations?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel rolled his eyes as he went to polish off his sandwich.
“He’s gone, isn’t he?” Her eyes were filled with tears as she leaned back against the pillows. “I know his reputation, Cas. I know what your family calls him. He wasn’t perfect but he wanted to be Jack’s father.” A hand went to her mouth to swallow a cry. “That’s what he wanted to tell me tonight.”
“Of course. She was livid, and made Anna put makeup on him for church and pictures the next day.”
“Now?”
“No.”
It took a little less than an hour before Dean showed up, toolbox in hand. He briefly wondered what he'd been doing on his day off with some black smudges on his jeans and arms, but what looked to be a clean work shirt. He would have smiled if he had the presence of mind to realize Dean had cleaned up to come over. “Did you really break a window to see me again?”
As soon as Dean unpacked the groceries, Jack bolted in the house to study the man carefully. “Burgers?”
“No!” Gilda said. “That is so not fair to Castiel and I.” She leaned closer to Castiel. “Dean is a total scam artist when it comes to poker and those two…” She pointed to Charlie and Ash. “Are math geniuses.”
“Next time Charlie invites me out I will take you up on that offer, how about that?”
“The dude Sam wanted me to help asked me to stop by to pick up a check.”
The three children eat quickly, and as soon as every last crumb is consumed, they dart to the play structure. Castiel moves from his spot across from Dean to next to him so he can keep them in sight. “I really do appreciate you coming.”
Jody seemed to drop the subject as he rounded up the three of them and stewarded them towards the bathroom to scrub away the layer of dirt on their hands. By the time he convinced Claire, Alex had set the table and Jody laid out the food.
“The milk attacked!” Claire shouted when she saw Castiel.
The officers took him to the hospital and helped him bypass the nurses that insisted only family could come. Castiel knew that Kelly had no family that would come. She often spoke of her strained relationship with her parents to him. Telling him how disappointed they were that she was still with Luke and how she needed to find a nice man. How she should move closer, get a career more stable than chief of staff to some state senator. Surprisingly she was awake he finally reached her room.“Cas…” Her voice was weak. “Did you see Luke?”
“Don’t be sad Daddy, I’ll see you soon!”
“Nice clothes, neat hair, cologne, and it’s a Saturday night.” She put her hands on her hips. “Why can’t you tell me? I am your favorite sister.”
“No, why on earth would you think that?”
“His name is Dean. He owns his own business as a handyman, that’s how we met. He fixed my roof.”
The moment was cut short by footsteps on the stairs, followed by a: “Daddy.”
“You didn’t know,” Cas said simply as he held his arms out to take the child back. “What are you doing as a volunteer?”
“It wouldn’t be ideal because I know you want to be with them, but I’m more than willing to take all of them myself.”
“Cajun and Creole, Andrea and I are from Louisiana and were mighty disappointed at the food selection nearby.” He slung an arm over his wife’s shoulder.
“Hell yes.” At that Dean put his keys back in the ignition and pulled out back on the road.
“But you won’t be intimidated by her.”
Dean eyes got wide as he shook a finger in his brother’s face. “Are you trying to set me up?” he said accusatorily. “You did the same with Cassie, and then Robin.” He groaned as Eileen’s laugh gave it away. He was even more mad that it had worked.
“Maybe I’m a little sad that the windows broken, but it can easily be fixed and…” He took a deep breath. “Remember how on career day I said I helped other people who were soldiers?”
“How did you guess that?”
“Coming…” he shouted as he shoved his feet into a pair of slippers before answering the door. He should have checked the peep hole because he felt himself freeze as he saw the policeman standing in the dimly lit hallway of his apartment. “Can I help you officers?” He stood up straighter as he met their eyes. Before they said anything Castiel knew the nature of the conversation he was about to have. It was a conversation his own family had dreaded having while he was overseas.
“Sorry to disappoint. I brought sandwiches and soup. Kali’s been on me about eating better.” He pulled out two foil wrapped sandwiches first then two containers of soup and then two wax paper sleeves. “Peanut butter cookies.”
“I know. The glass is single pane, I could probably do it if I had the tools.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Would you care to stay for dinner?”
“I need some water, please excuse me.” He walked up to the first cooler he saw and opened it. It was full of ice and beer. He stared at it probably way too long, fingers itching to grab one. Then he slammed it with probably too much force.
Doing things one handed was not a parental super power he had acquired. As he went to grab sugar for his coffee, Jack reached towards the cookie plate setting off his balance. The only thing keeping him from cursing was the child in his arms that was quickly developing his verbal skills.
The confusion-filled call of his name allowed him to turn his stride into a fast walk until he caught up with Sam. At first, his eyes were scanning his brother's face, trying to process what was confusing him. It wasn’t until he actually looked down in the crater; he understood.
continued from where it left off. The song title was a little weird now, considering what just happened. It made Dean think about things, and he didn't want to think about it. He changed the song, and Bon Jovi's
Before their eyes was a naked man sprawled out on the dirt. The imprints of the feathers they saw previously were all over the ground, and some ash even laid on the man's skin. He was covered in dirt, slight bruising around his arms and back, and bleeding lightly from his nose. Trying to process what they were witnessing, Dean noticed the man's chest was slowly rising and falling.
Heaven was not what it used to be. After God had left, the entire system went into a 'who commands who' basis. Raphael wanted to take lead, but most of the angels had followed Michael. It made sense, per se, as they considered Michael God's favorite and next in command. Raphael's orders always seemed a little selfish, more beneficial to him. Michael's benefitted all of Heaven, which ruled a significant amount of loyalty to him, and Gabriel was nowhere to be found, since he left to earth after God’s departure. Castiel was one of the angels assigned to Michael, with Uriel, Anna, Balthazar, Hannah and Bartholomew. Michael favored these angels, as they always got the job done, no matter how strange the order was.
As if he sensed Sam tuning out, Dean spoke. “How do you feel about you and me going to that pie fest in Minnesota at the end of the month?” He turned to look at his brother, who had a curious expression from the clouds. Sam’s face morphed into an uncommon emotion, then met with Dean’s eyes. It was easy to tell that Sam’s face said you’re kidding, even though he knew Dean was usually serious about these things. “We’ve been stressing too much about recent shit, I just figured we could use a break, y’know?”
The two were currently on an eight-to-nine hour drive to Sioux Falls, to visit Bobby per his request. They got a call about how he had something urgent he needed to tell them, and how it was about their father. It peaked Dean's interest immediately, but Sam was a bit more hesitant. They agreed to go anyway and considered it a 'family reunion.'
It wasn’t exactly the words that struck something in Castiel, but instead it was the way he said it. It was a threat, and he knew it. Without thinking, Castiel spoke. “You’re planning on breaking the seals.” It was supposed to be a mumble, something he kept to himself, but Michael just huffed a smile out.
Sam nodded, carefully stepping over some imprints. He could feel the heat rising from the ground and into his shoes. It was pretty impressive, actually. "Meteorites usually burn up before they get the chance to impact. This actually hit and was big enough to do this. The feathers make it seem like it's our thing." Sam was way ahead of Dean by this point and continued to slide down carefully as the ground slanted further. Once he got close enough, his breath hitched, and suddenly it was hard to swallow the clump in his throat. "Dean."
Thoughts were interrupted by slamming into branches, which softened the impact into the earth. It leveled the surrounding trees near him, black feathers leaving imprints in rocks and soil. Castiel took one last look around him, seeing two lights speed towards the area before closing his eyes and allowing the unconscious world to hold him.
“Hey, you remember when dad left us at Bobby’s for a week without letting him know?” Dean asked, a hint of joy in his voice.
was playing quietly on the radio, as Dean and Sam had been talking about childhood memories. Despite the rough patches they had growing up, there were still moments that they could look back on.
"I hope so." Genuine happiness oozed out with his words. "I love me some pie."
Castiel didn't buy Michael's excuse. There was no reason to release Lucifer this early. They could wait until the world is in ruins by humanity's hand. Instead, the leader of Heaven planned to taint the world. "I believe you're using God's words to validate releasing horror upon Earth." He could feel his throat get tighter from the pressure now building in his chest. "If you will not stop to think about the terrors Lucifer will bring to humanity, then let me fall. I will not partake in the breaking of the seals. That's against God's order. Anna saw it, and I see it too."
━━━━━━
Suddenly, a bright light flashed across the sky that forced Sam's eyes to squint. Dean flinched too, leaning forward to observe before slamming the brakes. The stop was harsh, jolting their bodies forward, but they ignored it to open the doors and step out of the car.
After that, Anna left. Her words broke something in Castiel, who finally noticed how strange Michael’s requests were getting. Uriel and Castiel were assigned to find and kill Anna secretly, which worried Castiel. To kill Anna was entirely different from taking her grace as punishment; it was something Castiel was unsure of carrying out. But when Michael brought him back up to Heaven to assign a new order, things only got worse. “I’ve been told of recent events being played out, Castiel. I’m taking you off the search for Anna and instead having you search for a righteous man.” The Archangel spoke quietly, sitting in the chair that was in the center of the room. “You are not to inform any other angel of this, not even Raphael.”
━━━━━━
Sam smiled, gave a small huff, and nodded. “You want to go to a pie fest to take a break? Dean, there’s so many other things we could do. Things that probably also sell pie.”
"It looks like a feather." Sam commented.
“Yes, Michael.” Castiel spoke carefully, looking over at the Archangel. “Can I ask why you’re wanting to locate a righteous man?”
Castiel remembered what Anna had said, and began to believe that there was a reason beyond what Michael spoke of. Angels were told about the sixty-six seals in case someone attempted to break it. The seals were important to keep closed, as they are what kept Lucifer locked away. His doubts grew, but Castiel quickly pushed them down with a lie of ‘making sure we protect a righteous man from the hands of hell.’ It didn’t seem right, though. Not with what he knew already. Castiel was always known for having too much heart. He followed the one and true order given by God himself; love every single creation of God. When something seemed against that, or even hinted at harming the beautiful creations they were meant to love, he always hesitated. It was why Anna came to him in the first place. “A righteous man shedding blood in hell is the first seal. This is not related, right?” His voice lowered in caution. It was never a smart idea to speak against Michael, but Castiel was having issues. It didn’t seem right.

The warmest, softest, sweetest smile in the world is on Cas’s lips when he steps back. It tugs at Dean’s heart harder than he wants to admit, and he can’t help smiling too. “I fucking

have food are the ones waiting to be filled. His stomach rumbles again, this time almost painfully. There are plates of croissants, piles of bacon and sausages, a bowl of scrambled eggs, and stacks of French toast. Before Castiel has even sat down, Dean is putting a little bit of everything on his plate for him.
That’s toeing the ring and Castiel flares a wing to smack Gabriel in the side. It knocks him back a few steps. “I’m not going to make any decision until we know the final results of the investigation. If they truly believe that there’s something to be worried about, then I’ll take that into consideration.”
Cas snorts a laugh and his shoulders shake under Dean’s arm. “My, what a coincidence.” He ends his sentence with a sigh and seeks out Dean’s other hand so he can hold it. “With the early sunrise and sunset, I won’t be able to come to the park on my work days.”
have experience with having sex and you know what to do. Should you take the male role then?”
Dean has the door halfway open before Sam uses his annoyed little brother tone. “
Before Castiel can complain, Gabriel starts attempting to urge him up the stairs. Castiel drops his voice into a hushed whisper. “This isn’t necessary. I can just go straight to bed on my own.”
“Nope!” Tessa turns her smile on him and jerks a thumb over her shoulder. “You can go ahead and change and punch out. I’ve got everything else covered.”
“Next to nothing, and I still think you’d probably be reacting the same way.” She sighs and gets back to putting away the dishes. “Your poor admirer is going to get their heart broken when they find out you put that lovely crane in the trash.”
Castiel hums in agreement and wiggles down far enough to kiss him. He can taste the cherry latex flavour on Dean’s lips and, surprisingly, it’s actually better than the banana. Maybe next time he
“You, obviously.” The woman shrugs and she crosses her arms. “I feel like you already know all the answers to the questions you want to ask, but feel free to get them off your chest now if you must.”
He refuses to believe that Dean has been flirting with him, but there are certain things about Gabriel’s argument that he has to admit were closer to the truth that he would like. Is Castiel really being too neurotic about this? Should he just suck it up and go? Of course he wants to know more about Dean for his own personal curiosity. The things he wants to know are things he could only get from direct questions or observing Dean in his own home.
Actually, Castiel has even been contemplating making a cup of tea for him as a joke. He had even considered preparing a container full of calming teas so Dean could take it home, but he had discarded that idea almost immediately. Dean said he doesn’t drink tea, so it would just be a waste to give him that. Besides, wouldn’t that be considered a gift and not a joke at that point? It would still be funny, but it would be a gift nonetheless and Castiel isn’t entirely sure whether or not they’ve reached the level of friendship where impromptu gifts are acceptable.

At this point, Dean hasn’t even opened the box to look at the mug. It’s been sitting in there for way too long and, now that the toys are done with, he probably should at least

’ space and Dean does feel a little weird going up there without asking his permission – even if it was because of his job. He’ll just have to save that until later. Maybe he can do it by text message when the party is over and Cas isn’t so busy.
“I don’t doubt that you are.” His smile at her is a little tight. To be quite honest, he has no real desire to play video games, but it’s nice to know that the invitation is there. Although it does warm him to his core to know that Dean now wants to share his interests with him. Perhaps on one of Castiel’s future visits to his house, they can sit at his computer and he can show him some of the game.
“Hopefully she hasn’t been waiting long.” Castiel steps up to the window to peek inside. He hasn’t even had the chance to get a good look before she’s walking out through the front door.
And then again with another message.
Since they don’t own a crock pot, Dean digs around in the cupboards until he finds the biggest pot they have. He dumps a pack of ground beef into it and sets in on the stove to start browning. While he was shopping, he bought exactly what he needs to make beef and barley stew. Barley takes a while to cook properly and it’s the perfect soup for them to have later. He also likes to cook the celery, onions, and carrots for a long time to make them super soft. Hopefully he’ll be done before they get home.
“Don’t worry about it, Cas.” He sighs and reaches over to pat his knee briefly. “She’s just being silly. We’re just going to have to dedicate ourselves to finding her a pretty lady to keep her company as quick as we can so we get a chance to relax and enjoy ourselves.”
“In some version of this world, that might be considered a relief.” He rolls his eyes and gives Gabriel a shove to put some space between them. “That said, thank you for coming downstairs to help. I really do appreciate it.” He’ll have to make a big breakfast in the morning as a proper show of his sincerity.
“I understand.” Cas sighs and his wings droop slightly. When he looks back to him, he’s softened into a smile that’s bordering on a pout. “If we’re going to take things slow, then I guess that means you’re planning on going now, hm?”
“Better than I thought.” Cas continues to pet her tail where it twitches back and forth on the counter. “She hasn’t ventured out from behind the counters. I think she knows that she’s safe from all the feet back here.”
“Yeah, no thanks.” He shakes his head and shoots Sam a flat look. “I’m not going to break my neck trying something you saw on
In the case of the weather, it’s been a pretty warm winter so far. They’ve got snow, but not a lot of it. Sometimes the wind gets pretty cold and requires a scarf, but otherwise most people can get by with a good jacket. Far as the weather report claims, it’s supposed to hold steady for the rest of the year. So hopefully it doesn’t get

thing to do. Now if Castiel wants to maintain his privacy, he’s going to have to get out of his cocoon of comfort and close it himself. Maybe that was Gabriel’s intention in the first place, but it’s still utterly rude. No. Castiel isn’t going to give him the satisfaction. He’s going to stay right where he is, close his eyes, and try to force himself to fall asleep.

Uriel and Bobby look far more refreshed than the others, but they both give their thanks as they come over to the table. Bobby, however, is directing a frown in Dean’s direction and it’s going largely ignored as Dean focuses on passing out the labeled cups. Castiel nods his greeting to everyone as he puts the box of dainties on the table and opens it.
Dean runs a hand through his hair and down the back of his neck. “I’m not going anywhere, Cas.”
Unfortunately Purgatory-Jar's art is still missing. It's our hope to come back and add them to these chapters once she finds the time to do the art. Be sure to keep an eye out in future chapters so you can come back and see it! You can view her other non-GYS (but still totally fucking AMAZING) art on
like it if Dean would say that he was just leaning in for another hug and he just read the situation wrong is all.
That gets him a raised eyebrow and a lopsided smile. “Have I mentioned lately that you’re a
Cas pauses with typing in the order and looks at Dean from over the top of his glasses. “Did you eat half the candy you were supposed to be handing out?”
With a deep breath, Dean closes his eyes and takes a moment to center himself. Today isn’t about underwear. It’s seeing Cas take
If asked, Castiel would never admit to it, but he does sometimes wish that Dean would come in more often. That would mean he’d have to come in outside of his usual work schedule, but that selfish desire is still there. Aside from that one time when he woke up too early and had breakfast here, Dean can’t really come in on nights when he doesn’t work but Castiel does. To do so would likely mess with his sleep schedule and it’s imperative that a firefighter been properly rested.
“You – you’re okay with this, right?” He catches Cas’s hand and squeezes it. “I don’t really know what boundaries you want to set unless you tell me, okay?”
Pleased that he won, Castiel quickly punches in the few coffees on the note. “Is there anything in the display case that you would like to add to your order?” He glances up with an apologetic smile. “Unfortunately we ran out of pie earlier. I tried to save you a slice, but I can’t exactly tell someone they’re not allowed to order it when it’s
Oh, man. This is too good. Dean shouldn’t be as amused about this as he is. He always kinda figured that Cas would be the good boy scout type; the guy who’s prepared for everything. With the glasses, and the vest, and the notepad by the cash register – it just really gives off the vibe that Cas is put together and on top of things. He

please with that.
To make matters worse, Gabriel and Balthazar have also stopped talking with Naomi. They’ve turned in their seats to look at him. It’s like being under a spotlight and Dean is reminded of that time in the middle of his Grade 7 choir recital where puberty hit right in the middle of his solo and his voice cracked

Castiel lifts his glass to check how much is actually left of his drink, and it’s only ice that is slightly tinted blue. “I think I could go for another.” And he would much rather that Dean have
It’s silly, but Dean’s heart does some fun little cartwheels at the sight of the mug. The mug is pretty simple on its own, but it’s the shiny green dragon tied to the handle that’s making Dean’s insides act like he’s twelve again. This isn’t even, like, the first dragon he’s received. It’s not even the second. There’s a small collection of them growing on his desk at home and it makes him feel like a total creeper because Dean
Apparently he’s done talking with the two of them now because his hand is on his earpiece again. “We’re coming in with medical and they’ve got hazmat suits. Try approaching him again in those. IT might be safer if he can’t catch anyone’s scent.”
Castiel groans quietly as he gets to his feet. “We’ll hire more staff when and if we start making enough to afford to pay them. We’re still –” He breaks off with a yawn. “Excuse me. We’re still
. “We are, yes.”
Much to Castiel and Gabriel’s disappointment, the FBI had taken all the earthly possessions from their childhood home and had to look through each and every thing for any tracking spells that might have been placed on them. It’s a good thing they did it, because according to their reports, there were some. Anything with a spell they couldn’t break, they destroyed. Luckily, most everything were things that Castiel and Gabriel didn’t want back anyways.

Dean can do feelings. He can do them just fine. He just can’t do feeling
His eyes catch the edge of the laptop and Castiel brings it back on top of the counter. He’s got more work to do – and that reminds him of something. “May I ask you a question?”
The cat meows when he puts her down around his feet. She slinks after him, keeping low to the ground and sniffing at her new environment. Castiel lets her explore while he tapes one of his posters about a found cat to the front door. For good measure, he tapes another two to both windows on either side of the door. She’s back around his feet again when he gets a few more to bring upstairs to the patio.
That does the trick with piercing whatever calm Dean has been trying to find for the last twenty minutes. He’s on his feet in a heartbeat. “
“His wings were just released.” He taps at his headset as if Dean has somehow forgotten that where he’s getting his constant updates. “They’re not in great shape, but they’re out now, so that’s –” Keith stops talking and his face falls into a wince. “Oh, that’s not good. He just tried to attack Gabriel.”
That question is enough to get Dean to stop leaning towards the door. He turns just enough so he can actually look like at him. The blush has filled his face and he is most
The slide back in is nice and slow; more to savour the feeling than anything else. He pulls out again just as carefully, repeating the motion a few times until he’s sure they’re both comfortable. Castiel watches how their bodies connect and the tense feeling behind his eyes increases. As much as he liked being able to see Dean’s face, he

As soon as the door is shut, Dean wastes zero time in getting his phone out and sending Cas a text.
They make their way back to their booth. Jess and Sam have made a sizeable dent in the nachos, but they both congratulate Dean on his victory and shove the rest of the plate over to their side of the table. Castiel uses his fork to carefully move some jalapenos from one side of the nachos to the other so he can eat them without having to pick them off every time he picks up a chip.
Jo shakes her head and clicks her tongue at him a few times. “Oh, but I did and now you must face my sleep deprived wrath. Tell me about the damn barista girl before you make me pull out the big guns.”
“Not my fault, Winchester.” Charlie jumps in a perfectly timed circle, hitting four pairs in a row. For the brief moment that she’s facing him, she sticks her tongue out and flips him off.

“O-o-okay then. I’m going to go deal with things.” Keith pulls a small black square from his pocket and tosses it next to the granola bar. It takes Castiel a moment to recognize it as a walkie-talkie. “Double click the call button on that if things get – uh –

“What?” Gabriel uses a hand on his elbow to lead him to the table and the waiting plate of bacon and eggs. “This is the first I’ve heard of this, young man. Where are you going and who are you going with?” After a moment’s pause, his chastising tone breaks with a laugh. “Never mind. I bet you’re just going to Dean’s place again, huh?”

As quietly as he can, he sneaks into the bunk room and finds where Charlie is sleeping. She’s got the bed closest to the door while Nick is sleeping in the very back of the room. They’re going to have to do this entirely in whispers not to wake up, but they’ve had plenty of conversations while he’s sleeping so this is old hat to them. No matter what, though, Dean

ago and Dean hasn’t touched them since. He could hardly keep his hands off his wings when he came back Tuesday evening. It was a nice way to keep the both of them relaxed while they hammered out the finer details of their relationship. They decided for both their sakes that they’re going to take things slow. This is a lot of firsts for them both and they need to find their way through it.
aspects to his nerdy life that he won’t reveal just yet – like the LARPing or the weekend video game marathons in his underwear. But this? This is okay.
The many questions come to a dead stop the moment Rowena’s hand lands on his knee. Castiel has to actually fight the urge to snap her wrist on instinct. Instead, he brushes her hand away and draws his knees to his chest so he can tuck the blanket around them too.
Oh God no. He shakes his head sharply, but still refuses to look Gabriel in the eye. “No, I’m not going to do that.” Castiel brings a hand to the crystal around his neck again, squeezing it for comfort.
“For me?” Cas honestly looks surprised. He looks up at Dean and then glances around slightly, as if checking to make sure that there’s no possibility that it could be for someone else. There’s no one else in the café right now, so who else could it be for, huh?

There are two problems that he has with that. For one, Castiel doesn't drink. If he does, it's just one or two drinks and then he's done. Mostly, he doesn't like the taste of alcohol and he has yet to find a particular concoction that he would like to have more than once in a night. And secondly, he has no one to kiss at the end of the countdown. There hasn't ever been anyone that he's wanted to kiss, or even thought about doing.
The sun sets in the late afternoon, before six o’clock. It gives Castiel

“There’s no shame in that.” Cas shakes his head with a smile. “If I didn’t prefer having a paper copy in my hands, I would absolutely get an e-reader for the pure convenience of having one.” His sentence ends muffled in a yawn that he hides behind one hand. “I’m sorry. I’m still not entirely awake yet.”
That includes not admitting that he

, Dean’s mood slowly starts to pitch downwards again. He starts out the window with a melancholy sigh every now and then, though Castiel might be the only one who takes note of it. Sam and Jess are caught up in another conversation again, this time debating the pros and cons of cats versus dogs.
He glances up from adding the shots of espresso to Dean’s drink. “How was your weekend?”
“Thank you, Dean. I look forward to eating this later.” Castiel looks up at him and is almost blinded by Dean’s brightest smile yet. Is he easily pleased by simple things? Because he always has such happy smiles even when they’re talking about something seeming insignificant. But it’s such a nice smile and Castiel can’t deny the strange urge he has to do something to keep that smile going.
It’s the third yawn that makes Gabriel snap. He points a mixing spoon dripping with icing at him. “Cassie, I am putting my foot down. It’s time for you to go upstairs and

. He had lost track of the time after they started dosing him with the potion. By then, it had been a week and a half since he had been taken. God, have they really had him for nearly five weeks? It’s been over a month of this torment, but all Castiel can think about is how upset Gabriel must be.

Despite that, Dean doesn’t back down. “I can and I
For a moment, Dean simply blinks at him. He tilts his head to the side, eyebrows coming together in confusion. “Your
Essentially, Gabriel is doing everything that Castiel should probably be doing. After all, he does have more time to spare. He’s always felt that it’s unfair to Gabriel that he be the one to handle all the paperwork for the café after spending eight hours working on his feet in the kitchen. Especially since all Castiel does during his shifts is some cleaning prior to spending the rest of it reading a book or folding a number of origami pieces.
That doesn’t seem to help matters. Chuck just licks his lips and swallows loudly. “Next you’re going to tell me that you’ve got a younger brother named -”
“Dean –” He starts and stops, unsure of what to say next. Does Castiel even trust himself to actually refuse him like he’s supposed to.
All it takes is one exasperated glare to make Gabriel take the garland off his wings and onto the tree. It’s quick easy work to finish everything else. Castiel knows it used to take them so much longer to do this when their family was whole, but it feels like no time at all before the angel is on the tree and the lights of the apartment have been turned off so they can appreciate the work they’ve done.

If he wasn’t half-way asleep right now, Dean would punch the air. “Any time, Cas.”

, it’s given Castiel a modicum of hope. And it’s buoying his confidence enough to confront Keith about how much he hates being here. Essentially, he needs to learn more about the situation before he loses his mind. Since Gabriel can’t get the information he wants, then Castiel will have to get it himself.
“That sounds good.” Cas leans over to look at Dean’s menu since his is closed and currently underneath his glass. “I think I’ll have that too.”
“Yes, he most certainly is.” Nick gives him a sly smile that Castiel immediately ignores. He turns away before he has to see the up-and-down look he knows he’s going to get. Nick does it every time they see each other and it’s just downright annoying.
Rowena fixes her dress before gesturing at Crowley. He rolls his eyes and sighs. “Oh, fine.
“Thanks, Sammy!” Dean stands up long enough to pull him into a tight hug. This stuff isn’t cheap and Dean knows it must’ve taken at least half of one of Sam’s paychecks to get it. “You’re the best little brother a guy can ask for.” And, just because he’s the big brother, Dean ruffles Sam’s hair up into a hell of a mess.
freezing his ribs; turning his body cold despite the heat of the shower. What if someone outside of his family finds out that he likes Dean? What if they decide to use it against him? A Witch could find out and Dean could end up like Castiel’s mother and – He presses a hand to his mouth to fight against the rising urge to throw up. Gabriel spared him the actual details of his mother’s death and he’s never been morbidly curious enough to look it up, but he still doesn’t want that fate to befall anyone.

The Witches holding his arms back finally let go and Castiel sags onto his hands. His head feels heavy, hanging low as his chest heaves. He can’t get enough air into his lungs. They’re too small – not enough – not – no – no –
There are so many questions in his head and Castiel already knows half the answers. He knows that even if he asks, he still won’t be allowed to contact anyone from back home; not even if they end up having to leave forever. His text messages with Dean last night might very well be the last words that Castiel will ever exchange with him. To contact Dean after they’ve adopted a new life would be to put himself and Gabriel at risk. It might very well expose them and force them to run yet again. It really doesn’t help that Castiel has Dean’s number memorized.
She groans and makes a half hearted attempt at getting away. “How come

want to see Cas naked, someone put him out of his misery because he must have gone insane. The only reason he’s surprised by this is because he honestly wasn’t expecting Cas to be ready for them to see each other naked so shortly after their one month anniversary. He figured it would take him maybe another month at the least.
With the treats out of the way, Castiel takes out the trays and the shelves from the display case and gives everything inside a good scrub down with a sponge and soapy water. He despises having a dirty café. If this is where their food is going to be displayed, then it damn well better be

If Gabriel can hear him, Castiel doesn’t care. He feels too good to care about anything, let alone keeping his voice in check. He has a hand in Dean’s hair and the other on his wrist. It’s a challenge to hold still while when he feels
Dean and Charlie share a look before he starts laughing. He shakes his head and sweeps his chopped bacon into a bowl. “It sure feels like I’ve told her to clean up after herself that many times. Seriously, Cas, she
“Not if I don’t get out there before you!”
“You’ve got a really weak argument here, Cassie.” With a sigh, Gabriel slings an arm around his shoulders and cuffs his chin with his other hand. “Buck up, kiddo. If you’re not into Dean and you just want to stay friends, then tell him. He’ll move on and hook up with someone less cute than you.”
“Thanks, bossman.” Charlie hits start again and then gestures for Dean to get up. “Come with me. We’ve got a concerned citizen downstairs wanting to make a report.” She holds up a finger when he opens his mouth. “Before you ask why you should come too, let’s just say the report is about a place down the street and close to your heart.”
But it takes him longer than Dean expected. He settles on Jenga and has the whole game set up on a table by the time Cas comes back downstairs. It immediately becomes apparently why he took so long. In one hand he has a bowl of popcorn, and in the other he has a wiggling cat. Nike meows until she gets put down and then she’s immediately off to explore. She starts under the tree and ends up on top of a bookshelf, seriously examining the garland there.
“How are you going to be keeping your little project together, hm?”
before they charge at each other. It’s not so much of a scream as it is a roar, but it makes him jump in surprise.

Obviously he’s depressed, but there’s nothing he wants to do about it. He misses the café and their home. Castiel even misses their employees and their repeat customers. With
Gabriel’s party, then he should probably seek out the birthday boy first before finding Cas. Even if he’d much rather find Cas and leave the card he has for Gabriel with him. He was the one who told Dean to bring one anyways, even if he was going to do that anyways. Gabriel was nice enough to sign
Dean doesn’t seem to have the same problem. He’s been snorting softly into his pillow for a while now. Castiel spooned him to sleep before rolling away. While he does love a good cuddle, there is a time limit on how long they can do that before they start sweating and get too hot to keep it up. He’s still on his side and starting at Dean’s back since apparently he just can’t sleep.
While Dean starts up the DVD player and puts in the disc they’ll be watching tonight, Castiel tries that first crunchy bite and promptly adds chips to the rest of his sandwich. It’s ridiculous, but he likes it. The crunch is different from that of the vegetables and the salt and vinegar pop of the chips adds a nice flavour without soaking the bread with vinegar. The marinara sauce they mixed the meatballs in is doing a good job of that on its own.

“That’s good.” Cas nods and gestures for Dean to follow him into the café. “It’s better to have done it in practice than to have been in a situation where you needed to use it.”
“Thanks for what?”
Dean knows the answer the moment he sees Cas’s eyes flash white on the screen. “He’s not going to let anyone near him, is he?” God, what did they do to him to make him so guarded? They’re here to rescue him and Cas is

more dangerous than it used to be, because Dean ends up looking at packs of fancy origami paper for himself if he needs any in the future and that just brings him back to thinking about Cas.
Once his broken story comes to the end, Gabriel doesn’t look nearly as freaked out as Castiel would have expected. At least he does have a narrow eyed suspicious look to him. With a sigh, he gets to his feet and heads to his closet. Castiel can feel his stomach sink when he pulls out his emergency bag. That sensation stops the moment Gabriel drops it on his bed and takes a single book from it. He’s not even remotely as voracious a reader as Castiel is, so it’s a little surprising to see that he keeps a book in that bag in particular.
“Hey, that’s cool. I understand.” That delightful laugh rings again and it brings the smile back to Castiel’s lips. “I’d be happy to help you with the café, Cas.”
A grin spreads across Mom’s lips. She tilts her head and raises her eyebrows. “Well, I didn’t think anything about the new shades and curtains when I saw them, even when I saw them in your

His free hand moves to rest on Cas’s hip, thumb rubbing in gentle circles. “You’re sure about this?”
It’s just over an hour until the end of his shift when he notices a bright set of headlights. There are been false alarms by cars that end up driving past, but these particular headlights turn off outside of Castiel’s field of vision from the counter. He drops everything to run to the door and quickly step outside. Castiel makes it just in time to see the tail end of the fire engine pull into the garage. If it wasn’t for his Creature blood, his eyes likely wouldn’t be strong enough to see that from here.
By some miracle, silence follows him right to the candy aisle. Of course Gabriel can’t hold his tongue for too long. By the time they find the candy canes, he’s reached his breaking point. “Dinner
Oh, thank God. What in the world did he do to have found such an understanding friend?
a Creature on top of that.
He pulls his phone out of his pocket and wiggles it in front of Castiel’s face. “They usually have one of the firefighters or cops come over and make an announcement to the crowd about things. Just watch the news, read my texts, and everything will be okay.”
Since he made way too much for himself, and even too much for Jo and Charlie when they get home, he’s sharing the deliciousness. The sliders are served with a die of

“I did.” Dean wiggles over to press up against the side of his leg. Castiel is currently sitting up in the bed, and it doesn’t leave much room for cuddling. He doesn’t seem to mind, though, and he throws an arm over Castiel’s lap. “How was your night?”
There’s a knock behind him and Dean twists around to see Gabriel with his knuckles still on the door frame. He crosses his arms and leans against it instead. “You want a second viewpoint on that story you’re about to tell there, Cassie? Y’know, from someone who

That’s when Castiel turns to look at him, only to be presented with a slightly flattened origami snail. “It’s a day early, but here. I figured if you didn’t already know, then I’d probably be outed today for this. So, here you go. I Hope you like it.”

Looks like the penny just dropped. Dean tries really hard not to blush, but he does duck his head while he shrugs. “I wasn’t sure if you knew or not. I kinda figured you did, given the whole bit where I was totally caught on camera every single time.”
Those are the kinds of questions he’s going to have to hold on to until Cas is ready to tell him about this. Right now, he’s more interested in reading the section of article that explains

.” The guy gives a little laugh that’s basically a nervous giggle.
While waiting for Dean’s response, Castiel also considers whether or not he should have Gabriel to a check of the street. He could hide charms all over the place. They’ve certainly done that to the café, the apartment, and every residence they’ve had since Gabriel first took up magic. And that was shortly after their parents died, so it’s been roughly ten years of magical precautions. While they might always be paranoid about the unknown, the charms certainly make life easier.
He can’t say exactly
“Well, you’re the one who wanted your wings out.” He shrugs and pushes past Castiel to head into the living room. “Now let’s get cracking. Some of us still have to work at ass o’clock in the morning.”
Their boundaries were left in the dust a long time ago. Specifically that time when Jo was being very sick in the downstairs bathroom while Dean was showering in the upstairs bathroom and
“Dean!” Cas crosses over to his table, not even slightly out of breath. “How long have you been here?”

“And me!” Mom grins. “I figured you wouldn’t mind for this chance. Was I right, or was I right?”
“How is he –
With a sniff, Castiel crosses his arms over his chest protectively and tilts his chin up. “You’re just jealous that I look better than you.”
“Castiel.” He shrugs, but his expression hasn’t changed a bit. “You’re freaking him out with your whole thing about your books and our names. Oh, I’m Gabriel, by the way.”
. He comes to a short stop in front of Keith, eyes locked on the building. “This thrall bullshit makes Cas want to have sex, right?” Dean waits for Keith to nod before he rubs a hand across the back of his neck and forces a nervous laugh. This is going to be hard to put into words. “Okay, so, why don’t we – What if – I mean, I could – We could send
A number of reasons flicker through his mind before Sam responds with a shrugging emoji. It’s immediately followed by;
The only thing that Dean wants to hear from the FBI is that Cas has been found. He wants to hear that they’re bringing him home. Dean wants them to tell Gabe that he doesn’t have to keep flying down to New York to give blood and sit through rituals performed by spell casters a million times stronger than him. Or, at the least, it would be good to hear some positive news on the blood tie. Like, oh maybe, that it was finally fucking
Oh God
With a sigh, he rolls out of bed and drags his heels all the way to Gabriel’s bedroom door. Even though it’s early in the evening, his exhaustion is already starting to kick in. Tomorrow he needs to take

at being safe or anything. Castiel is very familiar with the various things that Gabriel has prepared to keep him safe. Any other brother might find it a bit overbearing, but Castiel doesn’t. He fully appreciates everything Gabriel does to make sure he stays alive.
Dean’s arms are limp around his shoulders, but he maintains his hold through sloppy kisses until Castiel comes. It doesn’t take very long before his hips stutter against Dean’s ass. Gentle hands move through his hair and over his feathers after he sags down to lay on top of him. There’s a sticky mess on Dean’s stomach, but Castiel doesn’t care. Though he probably
With that in mind, Dean stays on his knees. It keeps him above Cas, but neither of them seems to mind. Cas’s wings are spread to give him all the more access to touching them, and ever brush of his fingers is helping him to relax. He just needs to
dinner. And that means he’ll never leave, so he ducks out as quick as he can. Without nowhere else to go and no desire to go home again, Dean heads straight back to the café.
Even then he’s still falling into a kind of daze. Castiel sways in place slightly, eyes slipping closed the longer Dean takes. It
“Oh.” Is it weird that Castiel feels a little disappointed by that? He doesn’t have long to dwell on that particular feeling as his anxiety swells to consume it. “Is he really
“I suspected as much.” Cas turns in his seat slightly to look back at them. “Bow hunting is rather prevalent in Fae culture.”
“I’m telling him everything the first chance I get.” He masks a shrug with shoulder both his duffle bag and Gabriel’s. “This isn’t something I can keep a secret anymore. Not from him. Dean needs to know everything if we’re going to attempt to pursue a relationship together.”
With a quiet chuckle, Cas shakes his head and leans into his side to put his head on Dean’s shoulder. “Your laugh, actually.”
Castiel turns and gestures at Charlie to follow him. “Why don’t you join us?”

An excellent question. Unfortunately, Castiel’s answer to it is rather pathetic. “Maybe.” He shrugs and stops himself as his hands stray to fidget with the edge of the blanket. “I don’t know, but you could try for it and see how far I’m comfortable going?”

She takes it to the table without any prompting. Castiel doesn’t even have the chance to wonder if he’s supposed to go with her. Dean grabs him by the arm and all but drags him over to the stove. He hands him a plate and a pair of tongs. “Start plating spaghetti and salad.” He turns back to the table with a smile. “Anyone want something to drink?”
“Yeah, probably.” He can’t look away; trying hard to figure out what in the hell Cas is getting at with a question like that. There’s something behind it and Dean can only think of one thing to say to check it.  “You wanna come with us?”

The overly pleasant tone catches Dean off guard and he stops short. “O-o-okay… First; you need to switch to decaf.” He starts digging some change out of his pocket. “Second; I’ll take a croissant, please. I’m just popping in to water the plants and leave something upstairs for Cas.”
Rather than answer, Cas just huffs and pulls his own shirt off. He drops in on the floor and Dean drops any thought he had about his own shirtlessness. His mouth goes dry and he swallows thickly. “W-w-what’s going on?”
“Is there anything else you can remember?” Keith’s voice is soft, encouraging even. “Anything at all?”

His brooding is cut short as Dean drizzles some lube across his erection. It’s rather cool and Dean laughs as he spreads the lube with his palm. He strokes Castiel a few times and raises an eyebrow at him. “There, is that better?”

to try for something more. Would Dean be mad if he woke him up at four o’clock in the morning for some sexy fun before he has to go up to the roof? Dean likes to come with him, which means he wouldn’t normally be woken up for another hour. It’s nice that he makes the effort to be there. Castiel really likes taking

Sighing, she leans back in her chair. "I'm going to rework the budget and see if we can't get us some fancy new iMac or something."
With a groan, Castiel opens his book again. He should never have closed it in the first place. “I don’t know what to know, Gabriel.”
“Balthazar; employee extraordinaire.” He does a little curtsy and flares his wings. “I’d just like to add my two cents to this as someone who

And yet, Cas still looks doubtful. He looks down with that little frown and then it clicks. Maybe this isn’t about him being worried that he might hurt Dean. Maybe Cas has changed his mind and decided that he’s not ready for this, even though he’s the one that asked for it. Shit. Is that what’s going on? Dean opens his mouth to ask, but before he can get the words out, Cas closes his eyes and spread his wings wide. His heart skips a beat or two, or maybe even three, as Cas holds Dean’s hips and lifts them off the bed. He holds him still and that’s totally cool with him as long as it means that he fucking
It hasn’t happened in the last dozen or so years since that day, so why would it happen now? And since that’s never happened to him, he shouldn’t put any stock in the fact that Dean dreaming about fire would cause something to happen tonight. Besides, Dean never confirmed that his nightmare was about fire in the first place. Castiel just needs to remember that Dean and the rest of his co-workers are

The tarp crinkles and shifts underneath him as he gets comfortable, ready to wait out the sun. Castiel keeps himself entertained by scrolling through the messages on his phone. There are only two people who text him regularly, and he has no interest in Gabriel’s messages as they’re most business or shopping related. That leaves Dean’s message log to go through, and Castiel is a little on the fence about that. It’s been almost week since they had their conversation and things have been a little – well, things have been

Dean very pointedly doesn’t answer. Instead, he un-pauses the game and goes back to completely kicking her ass at Mario Kart.

“It’s a pretty good one, I’ll give you that!” Dean laughs and his next kiss is longer – filthier. He licks into Castiel’s mouth with a single minded purpose that fills his brain with static. His teeth drag over Castiel’s bottom lip as he pulls away. “I hope you’ll be prepared to pay me back for this when I’m finished work.”
Unfortunately for him, Cas doesn’t look all that confident. “I might not make it worth
Holy shit it is too early for this shit. How in the hell do they have so much attitude for how little they slept last night? Going to that party was a bad idea all around and he should have known better than to go with them – and he should never have let them go either.

"Fine, fine." He gives her shoulders a squeeze before heading to the door. "You want the usual or do you want to go fancy today?"

While Jess is gorgeous and all, Dean really only has eyes for Cas right now. As far as he’s concerned, everything and anything pales in comparison to him. Yeah, sure, Cas might not be dressed in anything special, but it’s still taken Dean’s breath away. He’s wearing his big beige overcoat again, but it’s open and flapping in the breeze as he walks Jess to the car. Dean is openly staring because Cas just – he just looks so

“I know, I know.” Keith holds his hands up in surrender and steps away from the van. “The reports and the way you came running outta there made it sound like you were in a worse thrall than what you seem to be in.”
Their back and forth bickering follows Dean right up onto the roof. By then, Charlie and Jo are in his bedroom by the windows, both of them with a rope tied around their waists. Their ropes are tied around Dean and Sam is the one standing on the ladder, still feeding Dean the lights while he puts them up. The makeshift rope harness was just to shut Sam up so he wouldn’t rat on him to their parents. It didn’t help that Charlie and Jo both ganged up on Dean too about the whole harness thing. Whatever. He did it and now no one can bitch at him about safety anymore.

Keith continues talking around a mouthful of carrots. “Naomi is excellent at public relations and she’s been talking with the customers all day every day. Since we placed her there, she has confirmed on more than one occasion that Witches have entered the café.”

That’s actually a subject Dean is going to broach when he hangs out with Cas tonight. Ellen’s bar-cum-restaurant will be re-opening up later this month and Dean’s been trying to work up the nerves to ask Cas to be his date-but-not-a-date to opening night. Since he’s practically family, Dean already has a booth reserved for four and he’s excited to go. Originally he was going to take Charlie, but it turns out that she’s going to have to work. And he can’t take Jo because she’s basically taking up a side job and she’ll be waiting on the tables.
slipping down the inside of his thigh. He does his best to ignore that and he shushes Cas’s soft sound of disappointment. Cas still grumbles quietly under his breath as Dean stretches out on the bed and pulls him down to lie on top of him.
“Nothing to be ashamed about, Cassie.” Gabriel pats him on the butt before stepping out of hitting range. “We’re all guys here and you don’t have anything that Dean-o hasn’t already seen.”

Whenever Castiel thinks about how much Dean has become a part of his life, it makes his chest go all sorts of gooey. His ribs become a cage for a small sun and it’s such a wonderful feeling. That decides it for him and Castiel closes his laptop to put it aside. He gets out of bed only long enough to remove both his t-shirt and his pajama pants. As soon as they’re on the floor, he’s back in bed and tucked up against Dean’s back.

Well, since Charlie and Meg are currently napping, that means he only needs coffees for Nick, Bobby, and him. But if he didn’t get something to drink for Charlie, she would be totally pissed. They can warm up any drink once she’s awake. Meg specifically said she didn’t want anything because any caffeine had after she wakes up will only keep her up at the end of her shift when she just wants to go home and crash – exactly like everyone else.
With a loud yawn, Castiel wakes. As per his usual habit, he gets to his feet and stretches before taking in his surroundings. His muscles pull to the point of aching (in the best way) as he raises his arms above his head and arches his back until his spine pops. He spreads his wings to shake out the flecks of gravel and dust that still cling to his feathers.

that the Coven might have told someone else about him. The only reason they’re even devoting this much time into the investigation is because both Castiel and Gabriel want to go back home. It wouldn’t have dragged on for two months if the two of them had just agreed to take on new names and be relocated into new lives.
“No, not right now.” He shakes his head and turns away, starting for the door. This is not going to spoil his walk like it did last week. There are only so many good walking nights left before the snow hits the ground and walking becomes slightly less enjoyable. “I’ll get it when I get back.”

Anna was the first angel to show her doubts in Michael’s orders. Before she confronted him, Anna reached out to Castiel in an attempt to spread her thoughts to others. It was a strange moment for him, as their own thoughts weren't something they were created with. It was something they learned overtime. Angels were made to follow, while humans were made with choice.

Strange events followed the Winchesters, and no matter how much they researched, they weren’t given straight answers that they (mainly Dean) believed in. Sam was studying to be a lawyer at Stanford. An influential school that a scholarship granted him access to- but that was cut short when Jessica, his girlfriend of two years, was found dead on the ceiling. Sam had come home from his friend's apartment one night, finding their place empty. It wasn't unusual, so he ended up laying down on the bed. The horror when he opened his eyes had traumatized him, and she burst into flames before he could process anything. A lot of smoke got into his lungs that night, as he struggled to move from the fear that possessed his body. No one believed him when he gave his reports, and for a moment, they considered him a suspect. But when nothing could be concluded, and Sam's alibi checked out, he was free to go. Since the fire destroyed the room, there wasn't any evidence that could even begin to solve it. Her death broke Sam, and they forced him to leave the school to allow himself to heal. Charlie Bradbury, a family friend, allowed Sam to stay with her until he was well enough to stay with his brother and father.
“Be there in a couple hours, Bobby. See you then.” Dean cut in, glancing to his backseat again. “C’mon, let’s go, Sammy.” Getting into the impala again was even weirder, but he had to shake it off. Dean listened as Sam said a few more things, then hung up, opening the door and getting inside. Turning the engine on cut straight through Dean's anxiety, allowing him to release a breath he was holding. After a couple seconds, Led Zeppelin's
Golden beams blinded Castiel longer than he thought, which led to the thought of dying into his head. Perhaps Michael had killed him, and this was what it was like. This didn’t feel like the description of The Empty. If he was actually dead, he should see nothing but black. His eyes flickered shut in an attempt to make the glowing stop. His chest burned more, feeling as if it was almost on fire. Castiel tried to take a step forward, but was immediately met with wind so harsh, it felt like needles were pricking his skin.
played. If there wasn't an unconscious, naked man in the backseat, Dean would turn the volume up and belt this song with Sam. But things were different now. He kept the volume low, and pressed on the gas pedal, moving Baby forward on the road.
“Kinda?”
Castiel thought, bringing his numbing wings closer to his body, as if to protect it.
. Voices in his head got louder and Dean opened his truck without thought to grab two flashlights out.
"Okay."
"You gonna help me carry him back!?" His voice was stern, but Sam just pointed to his phone. Looks like he was already calling Bobby. Dean gave a hefty sigh, then slithered his arms under the stranger’s back and under the knees. At first, balance was pretty difficult, but he found his footing quickly and balanced them out. The man's skin was still pretty hot, but had cooled down since Sam first touched him. It made his hands pretty sweaty, but Dean had a good grip. Carefully, he started making his way back to the road. Mainly feeling around for branches, due to the lack of flashlight, a slow pace had been picked up. Dean glanced down at the stranger's face, processing his appearance. The man had a sharp jawline, with stubble growing. His lips were chapped, almost bleeding, and his hair was extremely tangled. Although, the man's expression caught Dean's attention more. His eyebrows were curved into a worrisome expression, as if he was sad. This made the feeling in Dean's gut change to a bit more urgency. In the softest voice, Dean spoke; "It's okay, man. You're gonna be okay." With all the thoughts racing in his head, he was unaware that the road was right in front of him now.
“Seriously?” His voice was hoarse. Sam moved and turned the song off, much to Dean’s disappointment. That didn’t stop his older brother from turning the song back on again. “You know I hate this song.” He whined.
. So Sam put the handle of his flashlight into his mouth and used his hands to jump down into the crater. Carefully, he poked the man's arm as if to get a reaction out of him. Upon touch, Sam flinched away with a look of pain on his face. He whiffled his hand out in pain. "His skin just burned me." The Winchester's eyes met again in a moment to think, before Dean took off his flannel and tossed it over to his brother. "Good thinking." Dean stood on the edge of the crater to grab the man's arm as Sam pulled him up. With a bit of teamwork, they eventually dragged him out and laid him on the flat ground. His skin was still red with heat, but at least he wasn't lying in a bunch of ash anymore.
“Ah, right. Candyman. Y’know, I forgot what that movie was about. Something with a guy with a hook-hand. Surprised they didn’t call the movie Hook-Man.” It seems Dean forgot the movie had scared him.
began to play. The somewhat loud volume stirred Sam awake with instant distaste.
"What kind of thing burns feathers into the ground?" The scent of campfire grew stronger, and Dean stood back up to keep walking. Now that Sam pointed one out, he noticed an abundance of these burned feathers imprinted into the ground. "Dude.. There's so many." His brother passed him and it became clear how the ground shifted into a slant as they got closer. "This is definitely a part of
It was a hostile last word before Michael stood up and started to walk away. The white walls seemed so flawless before, but now Castiel can see the cracks that fill them. The cracks that Michael allowed to be made. “The one order God gave us was to love and protect all of his creations. I believe by finding a righteous man, I will go against that order. A righteous man does not deserve to go to hell.” The angel stood tall against the Archangel. “I doubt your decisions, Michael. Angels protect, not bring ruin to those we are supposed to love.”
About twenty minutes passed since they started the course for Lathrop’s bar. Led Zeppelin’s
His reaction made Sam chuckle, placing his phone in his pocket and leaning his head back. "Of course it would. Who knows, maybe this place even sells pie. It'll be a little wonderland for you."
An urge to get to the site as quickly as possible washed over Dean, and as soon as Sam got in and closed the door, Baby was already speeding up. The mile markers on the side of the road blinked by while the fallen trees grew closer. There was a silence between the two brothers while the music played quietly. "Hey, stop up here." Sam said, and Dean listened. Pulling over to the side of the road, Baby's engine was quickly killed so the brothers could hop out. The eldest's stomach turned in a twisted feeling that screamed
The room glowed a bright golden white until Michael was the only one standing in the room. His face read many emotions, but regret was not one. The prophecy to kill his brother will happen. He’ll just have to give the task to Uriel- who followed blindly without question.
The sky had become darker; the stars burned brighter, and the clock read 9:08pm. The Winchester's had a long drive ahead of them, and a stranger to take care of now. Their lives were about to change drastically.
Long road-trips like this weren't unusual. With the events that had unfolded in the previous years, driving became a safe-space for the two of them. Despite Dean mainly driving, and Sam usually sleeping, they were both able to escape the past that haunted them. As much as it would let them, anyway. Nights where Sam jolted awake from nightmares, and days where Dean questioned his self-worth happened, but they were always there for each other to help the other through it.
A laugh stifled out from Dean. “Oh, come on, Sammy. You haven’t had those dreams for months now. I think you can let Asia have their moment back.” The pun kept Dean smiling like a child. “Besides, I thought you were passed out.”
“No. You have orders to follow, not question, Castiel. I trust you to this task, and I trust you to come back successful. Understood?”
. It seemed the thought crossed Sam's mind as well, because they were looking at each other with that expression that just read:
Dean chuckled, nodding his head. “Yeah, yeah! Felt bad for us, then we went and saw.. What movie did we see? Sugarman or something?”
"What the hell is that?" Dean questioned, but was ignored by his brother. Instead, Sam just watched. The rock(?) falling from the sky burned up, but not like it was breaking the atmosphere. All in all, it seemed like a super-abnormal event. Shortly, the falling object vanished behind some trees, then impacted. Once it did, the ground shook for miles and the trees were blown down. Now that piqued the interest to check it out via Dean. "C'mon, lets go check that out." Dean said, then patted the top of the Impala before getting in. Sam didn't process the words his brother said and was instead taken back by the leveling. He had seen nothing like it. "Sammy, c'mon!" Hazel eyes glanced down, and Sam sighed.
No matter how many times he watched Alex and Claire, it was hard to juggle all the children. Honestly each bedtime task should be an Olympic sport. Alex did say that she would help but she was only a year and half older than the other two, and Claire would reject any assistance. Somehow, he had them all tucked in to bed by 8:30 after reading to them from a book of children’s short stories. He kissed Jack on the forehead while Claire and Alex gave him a hug. The girls were snuggled into the trundle bed attached to Jack’s bed. He had felt odd about letting them sleep in Jack’s room, but he felt even worse making them sleep downstairs in his office’s daybed.
that had been going on—
He nodded knowingly as they both pulled out their phones to exchange contact information. It looked like he had gotten lucky yet again.
Dean watched as the normally stoic Castiel seemed to break in front of him, pressing a fist to his mouth to hold back a cry. Even after his PTSD episode he was not like this. Distant, shameful, tired, that was what he saw then. Now he looked to nearly be in physical pain. “You don’t need to tell me the rest.”
“Don’t bury it in whipped cream, have roughly the same as the berries and the cake,” Dean said, but then he leaned in close. “The whipped cream is my favorite part too, but I bet your daddy made the shortcake really good.”
“Not to ruin the mood, but it has been some time since I’ve been with a man.”
“Luke had a way of getting into all sorts of trouble. While Jack is one of the best things that has happened to me, how it happened with Kelly was awful. He just stopped speaking with her after she told him she pregnant. To this day I have no idea why she was in the car with him that night.” Castiel reached for the mug again, trying to get any warmth from the mostly cooled hot chocolate.
“Parents get stressed out; it happens.” Dean did not take his eyes off the window as he pulled out a tape measure.
“Oh…” Castiel let out a hearty sigh before he took a sip. “It’s normal to wonder. She was up there. The woman with short brown hair.”
“Only if you want to.” Dean looked at him closely, as if he was taking the opportunity to study him closely as well.
Castiel thought he had to be dreaming. His nightmares had been particularly vivid as of late. “Would I be able to see her?” he asked slowly wiping a hand over his face. Kelly had been dating his brother on and off for the better part six years.  He didn’t know why she was with him tonight; last he heard they had a big fight when she told Luke she was pregnant. Luke was doing the very Luke thing by avoiding her at all costs.
“Daddy is really good at baking,” Jack said. “He made a pie for us too. We had it for dessert last night.”
Castiel ate with vigor. It was grocery shopping day so he and Jack had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. He then thinks at how much Jack would love this, knowing at best he would be having frozen cheese pizza. Anna was vegetarian—which his son would typically have no problem with—but that combined with the fact that microwave popcorn was advanced cooking for her left little option.
