Steve laughed, the startled sound was his first genuine one of the entire evening.
“Ironman!” Steve interrupted with a snap. “We need your help on the bridge. Clint cut the chatter.”
“I’ve a good role model Sir.”
The boy’s shoulders drooped in his hoody. Kid was running around in a fucking red and blue hoody for god’s sake.
In which Peter Parker's life changes forever (again)  Tony and Steve get their bond on and a wild Bucky appears, demanding to know who the hell he thinks he is.
"Bambi. She likes her too. Says she reminds her of you."
"Ah Tony, it is good that you have joined us." Thor said, clapping a meaty hand on Tony's shoulder, thankfully with some restraint (not always a guarantee with Thor) "There are congratulations to be had for our valiant archer and the son of Coul."
“You’re the one who looks terrible Steve,” Natasha pointed out with a poignant stare. “You’re still having visions.”
"My parents died young," Papa explains. "Being an orphan meant I had to grow up fast and make my own way. Obi and I started Stark Industries from nothing, saved every penny we could make to by a shack at the edge of the river and scraps to start building. "
“Hawkeye, status?!” Steve snapped and when there was no answering reply from Clint who was laying still and unresponsive on the floor he fired off, “Widow, get to Hawkeye and assess the damage. Iron Man do you have eyes?!”
Tony frowned, the harsh thoughts and the flood of overwhelming guilt that accompanied them pulling him further and further from the quiet dark until he was blinking his eyes open blearily.
“Whatever we have to do. It’s just a name.”
He read those old files about prides and one thing above all others had stuck out.
“Salvation.” Tony answered, aiming for a gentler tone. “Mrs. Keener. She’s your grandmother, right? I’m guessing Mom got herself in the family way and when Granny got wise to your parents romance she wasn’t too happy. Eventually Granny ships dear old dad up the river and kicks you out to the barn.
"He can have some food can't he?" Tony pleads. He can see by the shadow that passes over Ana's eyes that she's thinking what Tony already knows. Hughard would have a fit to come home and find a negro eating in their kitchen. "We have plenty, and he risked his life to save my journal. Surely that's worth something. A pastry even? Ana makes the best pastries. Unless you're allergic to berries. You're not, are you?" Tony babbles and Ana grins at the boy's dumbfounded expression.
Steve considered his words for a moment and Tony could tell when it dawned on him, the full implications of his bond with Bucky.
Rhodes departed with a chuckle and a friendly enough nod for Steve and a warning not to listen to anything Wilson said, but not before pointing out that he doubted Steve’s own sanity, what with his willingness to go along with Tony’s particular brand of crazy.
"Not if Stark has anything to say about it." A male voice interjects and everything goes quiet. Tony glances curiously around Aunt Antonia's wide shoulders to see a tall man leaning in the doorway watching them.
Of course she doesn't, because Tony is there and Mama is braver than anyone in the whole world, but Tony doesn't want another uncle if he's like this.
Mama gave them a list, because she likes to buy silk directly from Devi because the shops will just mark up the price and Devi always gives them a good deal.
"Yeah, a couple guys at the VA and I had a thing going." Sam laughed, revealing a slight gap between his two front teeth. It gave him kind of a goofy look, but something about him warned Steve he probably took full advantage of how disarming that was.
In the passenger seat Wanda stares at him, intent and knowing.
Bruce coughed again, a real sounding one, and muttered as he shifted uneasily, “Maybe I should leave…”
It was all there in her file of course but subterfuge wasn’t the strong suit of domesticated kats, so if there were any holes in her story he was confident he could sniff it out. Though come to think of it, there wasn’t much scent to speak of coming off the girl. There was enough for him to be able to tell that she was a fel, but she was wearing some sort of scent dampener that made her scent seem very faint. About as noticeable as catching a whiff of someone baking three floors up.
As one of his first and oldest friends Rhodey knows more than just about anybody else what it was like to grow up with Howard Stark for a master, but he doesn’t know the extent of it. Because Tony has never been able to bring himself to fully share it all. It’s a very private pain.
WE HAVE LONG STUDIED THE USES OF VIBRANIUM IN MANIPULATING ENERGY. THERE IS AN ENGINEER HERE WHO RECENTLY DEVELOPED A TECHNOLOGY FOR A NEW FIREARM. IT WAS JUST APROOVED TO GO INTO PRODUCTION. THE SHIELD AND GUN USED BY THE MALE USES THE SAME TECHNOLOGY, ONLY IT IS NOT IN ITS INFANCY. IT WAS MADE BY SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD MUCH TIME FOR TRIAL AND ERROR IN WHICH TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS.
It’s funny. You used the term wild animals. I’ll admit Zoology isn’t what I got my PHD in so forgive me if this seems like an over simplification, but how many turkeys have you met in the wild who knew how to put on a suit. I mean besides General Ross.
There was something niggling at the back of her consciousness, an insistent warning bell ringing long and thin under each breath that had her itching to reach for her communicator and check on her teammates, certain that something somewhere had gone wrong.
Because it wasn't always sleepy cuddles and dopey smiles. Sometimes it was lustful eyes and gripping hands, and "Strap him down Boy. it's not unusual for a kitten like Tony to be anxious their first time, but once you warm him up you'll see how he takes to it".
Jena’s eyes widened in alarm as she pulled Harley closer to her, looking wildly towards Coulson and then towards the door speculatively and Steve could see that she wanted nothing more than to leave; but Harley glared balefully at the she-tom.
Though he knows it means pain, Tony could no more avoid her as he walked through the halls of his mind, than he could avoid himself. She's more a part of him than his blood and bone.
“Doesn’t that depend on what you think right is? We’re the only guard Tony has. Isn’t it right that we help him when we can?”
They knew that if the love between a human and their kat was legitimized it would bring their whole system down like it had for Steve.
“Oh.” Now Harley looked embarrassed as he sought the captain’s eye, posture full of apology. “Sorry Steve.”
In two short years, this will be gone. War will rip apart the country, Rhodey will enlist, Tony's parents will be dead and Tony will be locked behind the walls of a monastery to be forgotten. No one left who cares enough to remember him.
“M-mr. Stark?” she asked, timid and wavering as if her own eyes couldn’t be trusted.
"Yeah well, lucky for me Reverend Wilson saw things differently." The tom replied, and when he didn’t go on Rhodes filled in.
Somebody has to wear the crown. Maybe it will be Clint today.
~*~*~*~
But even as he thought it, the light show going on in their heads chased the thought away. It wasn't something Tony had words for, though he'd try his best later to describe it to Bruce. All those neurons and pathways in the brain, all those billions of cells carrying information across millions of bridges.
“Our protection.” Phil acknowledged a moment later and Clint didn’t look away from the windshield but he felt his heart tug at that. It made him feel secure in the decision he’d made.
It no longer hurt initially using his technopathy and Tony was confident he’d be able to crack the jets shields and download every last thing there was to glean from it and any onboard computing systems before the pain started up. Even the highly-advanced security of the prince’s aircraft wasn’t designed to hold up against something like extremis. Not indefinitely.
Tony makes a dark alien future seem wondrous. He’s fireworks.
team, and Tony wasn’t about to give him up just because of an old bond forged in childhood. Natasha had loved Ivan but she'd still chosen him!
Still, Tony didn't like to see him looking so hangdog or feel the weight of his guilt hanging over them, especially over the ridiculous idea that he'd somehow been a bad friend. Did Bruce have any idea how much Tony enjoyed having him around? What it had been like rattling around in that tower all by himself after losing Clint to finding out he'd never really had Clint to begin with?
“And it just so happens that I have a budding interest in medical science, bad heart.” Tony gave the arc reactor a tap. “Mr. Killian’s pretty eager to sit down with me. I’m headed up to the family lodge but he’s happy to meet me at the Stark Warehouse up there.”
Which is why Breeders came up with mating blocks, where you shackle the fel down on their front in prime mating position. Howard had purchased one after Tony’s third heat had passed with no babies in sight and Ty had bitched to Robert about how Tony wouldn’t take teeth. Which should have been the end of it really, except fifteen-year-old Tony concocted all sorts of unstable potions to jack up his glands and halt his ovaries in their tracks. Because fuck being impregnated against his will. Eventually when even the mating block failed to do the trick Howard learned what Tony had done, and when the doctor reported the significant damage he’d done to his reproductive system and strongly discouraged breeding him he’d finally been forced to give up.
“What happens if uncle Steve’s not in Washington when Hydra launches Project Oversight?” Kate asked quietly.
The helmets the robbers wore didn’t have pointy ears but they didn’t really need to. They were kats, and they’d taken up weapons against humans.
"I didn't know Tony being Queen meant that he called all the shots. I've seen what that kind of leadership does and that's not what this country is about."
“Yeah that’s a part of it. We’ll go with that. Listen kid, you got a name?”
A serving boy was ladling a spicy smelling broth into the bowl at the edge of Tony's plate as a resounding cry took up through the hall. Sure hands. That was kind of funny, considering that Tony's hands weren't at all sure about picking up that little bowl and putting that reddish substance in his body.
Sometimes, when he has been Ivan for too long, when the memories have grown out of the ash in his head like green shoots and he has discovered books, and foods, and songs that feel like old friends whose names he can’t remember, he starts to remember her.
Steve shuddered, but he was breathing easier, grip on Tony not so deathly tight.
Tony had held his reservations about it but after a full day at the shelter they were back in the tower and the Avengers Christmas party was well underway, and was thus far a roaring success. By some miracle, (or maybe just because everyone was just as big a sucker for Harley's big blue eyes as Tony was) everyone that Tony considered family had been able to make it. Even Rhodey had managed to get leave and had brought a friend along (though Tony smelled bullshit on the just friends bit, and not just because Carol had tits).
It was hard not to be jealous as Tony, Bruce and Natasha oriented themselves around the new bond. Steve wasn’t the only one who felt that way either. It was impossible for Clint not to feel somewhat left behind as Natasha connected with others on a level that he couldn’t touch, and found a place in the very thing he’d always wanted and she never had.
They’re bigger but they wish they were small again. They’re in a stale room full of medical equipment and washed out with florescent lights.
"So your uncle got you a cushy gig. Nice. Your father must actually have claimed you."
Rain. Tony decided as he took a slow breath in, letting their scents mingle together on his tongue. They smelled like a fresh rain in spring, when it kicks up dust and pollen just before it pours. Just before everything gets washed clean. Cleansing.
Bruce was not a night owl the way that some residents in the tower were. Not that he couldn't get caught up in his work like the best of them, but part of keeping the Other Guy contained was maintaining a balance: low stress, regular sleep, regular meals. That sort of thing.
Once again, Tony had found himself at a crossroad with limited life expectancy and there were certain ducks he wanted to put in their rows.
“Nyota’s the Queen.” He reminded them all in a small voice, looking to her with hope. “She’s the one who decides.”
“As for your friends, they see you are hurt. I understand why they would resent me.”
“You are Alurio, Tony.” T’Challa answered, frustratingly undeterred by the show of aggression. “In your blood is the blood of the great Queens and the builders of empires. You never belonged among these swine.”
“It hurts.” Natasha confirmed with a smirk but when Steve winced she shook her head slowly. “Not necessarily in a bad way. A surge of endorphins and reproductive hormones is a nice built in Band-Aid. That and some just like it rough.”
“Don't worry so much Banner. I got this. How about Princess Nichols?”
“So those are your terms?” Not Bucky looked right at him, eyes a glacial blue and so suddenly strikingly familiar it sent a chill up Tony’s spine. “All or nothing?”
"And I'm not saying that to put more pressure on you. I'm sorry I lost sight of what's really important to me. I just wanted you to understand the why part."
But they do, they have to. Change is inevitable.
“Don’t press hard, or the whole thing might come loose” the old man warns, guiding his hands gently, and his brow furrows in concentration.
The captain was standing next to the roof edge, staring not up at the stars or even out over their great city.
Steve’s face twisted up in pain and his scent went pungent with grief, and Tony had never wished more that they were bonded so that he could take some of it off of Steve and onto himself but he was forced to settle for good old-fashioned touch.
There were quite a few leashes on display that night. Far more than Steve had expected considering who their guest of honor was. He’d thought that the brass would scramble together to try and hide their sins but in a way this made sense too, that they would all show up in their best clothes to show off their prized possessions. They were making a statement of their own, in response to the one that T’Challa had made earlier that afternoon.
“Tommy’s right.” Billy leaped to his twin’s defense. “We’re not babies. We’ve all been trained same as you and Jamie. We’re as much Avengers as you are.”
Steve had promised to be just on the other side of the glass and Tony had made some joke about using his time better to go and get cheeseburgers, because he was sure to be starving when he came through and Steve had smiled, even though it was hard to find anything really funny.
Spotting it, T’Challa chuckled, shaking his head once more as he muttered, “my mother would yank both our ears if she saw us this way.”
There was a knowing look on Bruce’s face, a sadness that seemed to hang over his shoulders as he gestured with his head towards the door and said with an understanding little half smile, “duty calls.”
"Good for him." Clint growled. "I'm sorry for what those bastards did, but I'm not sorry he took care of you."
He pushed himself harder.
They carve out her heart in front of her (them).
Natasha shouldn't be a lone wolf (for lack of a corresponding feline metaphor) and Bruce shouldn't be as isolated as much as he is, and Cap should definitely stop looking at Tony like he'd failed them all and Steve had expected so much better from him.
“That’s how you knew he was Spiderman. You’ve been watching OSCORP.” Steve realized, and Tony nodded.
The tom didn’t rely solely on the dagger, mainly using it to block the elctro-shocks from Natasha’s bites, the bolts of energy crackling and sparking brilliant white light as they met the energy field of the dagger.
“Why not Princess?” Riri chimed in, eureka in her tone. “It’s right on trend with popular pet names in this decade and you certainly won’t forget to respond to it.”
T’Challa had responded with a photo of himself with an eyebrow raised. Dressed for a night out and holding a cocktail in one hand he looked just like the snobbish peddys (ritch bitch kats with a pedigree) that were so popular on TV. Clint chuckled and thumbed out a reply as outside his windshield New York and the tower was coming back into view.
Only, it was surging again, growing stronger as the voices of his friends grew quieter and the fog thicker.
"Is a fifth required?" The tom asked, all white toothed grin and Tony huffed, letting his tail swat him as he turned back toward the coffee cup he'd abandoned on a counter. He was going to need the caffeine for this.
“Pepper’s got the car waiting and Rhodes went to make sure our exit is clear. Bruce is already waiting in the car to help you back to the tower.”
Tony chuckled sleepily. Fuck it.
Though he attempted to draw him backward Steve stayed firmly planted, refusing to be pulled away from the apparition.
"What's with the grin?" Steve asked and the feint smile on her lips twisted into a smirk.
"And you let him have it." Steve summarized almost tonelessly but there was something in his eyes, something deep and almost stricken, but it was quickly hidden away behind a stony stare.
" Natasha nodded covertly in the tom's direction and Tony bit back the urge to indignantly insist that he had not been licking his lips, he wasn't a complete ingrate, in favor of giving the tom another once over until he spotted whatever it was that Natasha was so caught up on.
Clint hadn't truly been comfortable since the battle for New York and the whole thing with Loki, and Bruce just never was.
As soon as Tony's brain recognized that he was once more standing upon solid ground he collapsed to his knees and hurled as cold shivers seized his body.
The question is why? Why did they go on the attack?
ONLY A LITTLE. WHAT WERE THE THIEVES AFTER?
How do you subdue the strongest mind in the world? You don’t.
“Charlie?” Tony questioned, wondering at the sudden change. Had he misread the situation?
This armor was smaller, sleeker, and closer fitting, which likely allowed for a greater range of motion and was the reason why for the first time that Thor could recall, the portion covering his head included the shape of his ears rather than sticking to the shape of the human head.
That was harder for Tony to put into words and provide proofs for. It was just a feeling he had, having seen them in action. But instinct no matter how valuable was not evidence.
Laura had been nice, as far as kittens went. Tony had only met her one time in passing and had promptly put her out of his mind because he had better things to focus on than Barton's love life. And okay, collared kats made him uncomfortable. So sue him.
It was there, simmering under layers of discontent and growing anger: the bitter beginnings of fight scent.
“Really guys? It’s Cap. What did you think was going to happen?”
Waking himself up is as simple as killing the specter.
The summer villa is home. It’s perched near the top of a great hill so that from the rear they can see the mountains reaching up into the sky, and the front looks out over the farms that bleed down into the city center just before it meets the glittering turquoise sea.
Well there was an easy way to know for sure, and she was standing right next to him.
As much as Tony wanted to thumb his nose at (not)Luke’s advice he wasn’t going to play around with Bruce’s life. He and Natasha had bonded under duress and Tony well remembered the agony of it, and didn’t pretend not to know how close they’d both come to perishing. He still wasn’t completely sure what had tipped the scales towards survival. So Helen was there along with a SHIELD medic because Pepper had insisted and Tony couldn’t deny the need.
There were four trucks coming up the highway towards the farm, heavy with tech. There was a chopper in the air sweeping in from the opposite direction. With the amount of chatter being tossed back and forth over their radios Tony felt himself slide into their frequency more than he consciously tried to tap it.
it was for?” Clint summarized slowly, almost dangerously and Steve blinked silently a moment before narrowing his eyes.
“Gee whiz Cap, you’re so big and strong.” Tony giggled, burring his nose against the jacket of Steve’s tux, dragging in his soothing scent. “You know I dreamed about this sort of thing when I was a kid?”
Silence descended when Tony finished but he was fine with that, and the vein ticking at Fury’s temple.
“That’s important because everything that made you you was gone and you didn’t have any time to miss your friends or to figure anything out. I mean what if America had been taken over by Nazi’s or something while you were asleep? How would you even know you weren’t being used? And you were, right? Because it was really unfair when you think about it. Kind of like they knew you’d say yes so they asked, even though you’d already served your time and probably just needed to go home and rest. So that’s why more and more paradoxes are popping up; because the old you can’t exist anymore but you’re not allowed to rest and find the new you. You’re like, Captain America forever now, all the time, and that’s like huge because according to my math you’re just going to keep losing points and hit the bottom of the - ”
The Alurio divided themselves into territories ruled by feudal dynasties: Prides.
Tony seemed pleased by this, but Thor noticed that the Captain's expression was pained until he turned away.
-Isiah & Antonia-
"Wait."Fury interjected before Tony could get very far. "Before you go, you should know that we've been negotiating with the kingdom of Wakanda."
“Clint. Status.” Cap called over the com, but Clint was a little busy dodging the speedy, incredibly powerful blows, the human lantern was throwing at him, having to rely on every bit of his own speed and flexibility not to take a direct hit. He was pretty sure when the guy drove his fist straight through a wall that he didn’t want those giant paws coming into contact with his body any time soon.
In which there is a brief calm before a small storm. Tony's heat is coming which has shaken up the tower but that's kind of a good thing. Bruce gets sad occasionally (okay a lot) so he recognizes sad in others. And Steve is SAD, but Bruce thinks not all heart pains are incurable. He made a graph.
Stark’s growling voice roared through his head and the pain intensified. Ivan clutched the sides of his skull, digging claws into the flesh attempting to get to the thing causing so much pain and dig it out.
He understood the need for solitude, Bruce. He'd always found the quiet of his own laboratory kind of comforting.
That was okay. Steve was going to enjoy doing the same .
“They have a ship and it has the same cloaking tech their suits do.” Tony announced as he turned around, mind already focused on finding ways to either disable or combat that for the next go around.
Steve’s hands tightened on Tony’s waist and Tony rolled his eyes. Good job calming things down Bruce.
He needed help, he knew that. But unless there was a doctor out there who could raise the dead, Steve didn’t know what anybody could do for him.
"Great." Tony nodded, some of the tension easing from his neck.  He didn’t trust Ross not to try and sabotage things. He was going to try, some way, and Sonia Dyson would love a way to take him down a peg or two hundred. Two hundred confirmed residents so far. Two hundred lives that would depend solely upon him for protection.
Tony couldn't compete with ghosts, and he didn't want to.
"Tony, I'm sorry." Bruce finally said, and there was such a gravity to his tone that Tony couldn't pretend not to understand what Bruce was talking about.
Yes. Natasha's eyes jerked back to a glimmer of light and the shadow of a barn shaped structure in the distance.
Uncle Isiah arches a dark eyebrow and doesn't move either.
"Of course, Sir. And might I say congratulations." The A.I. answered fondly. "It will please you to know that I have good news as well."
But the room solidifies around them and fills with the sounds of outside. The woman at the sink pauses with a dish in hand and lets it clatter to the floor where it shatters. She turns slowly and tilts her head, staring at them both in morbid fascination like someone who has wandered into the room in the middle of a movie where the heroine is being chased by a psychotic killer. She can see them. Tony is sure of it.
“Hang tight.” Cap’s voice said in his ear. “I’m coming to you.”
Anyway, the whole class had just been going along with Mr. Hepburn until Peter had raised his hand and suggested they go to Stark Industries instead. Mr. Hepburn was just afraid of offending Master Norman because he donated so much money to the school so that Peter could go to school there, but everybody knew that Stark Industries built the coolest stuff and nobody could beat them. Not even Master Osborne.
But for the first time, hearing his name said that way, Tony thought of the way that his mother used to say it. They way Jarvis would. Like he was something amazing and cherished. Like Anthony and
“Nobody needs a doctor. Who needs a doctor when we have a perfectly good medi-kat.”
“Oh. You drug all your dates?”
"It's not a big deal Stark," Clint said, rolling his shoulders to release the tension in them and Tony narrowed his eyes and set the wrench in his hand down with a clink.
Even though Sam didn’t look unstable and he didn’t smell it either, Steve knew better than to judge a book by its cover. You didn’t live that kind of life without taking on a few scars.
“Thor and I are at the exits. They can’t walk through walls.” Natasha growled. Tony wasn’t so sure of that. These guys didn’t just have his technology. They had things he’d only yet contemplated in his dreams. Things that were barely scraps in his notes, and a few ideas that hadn’t even made it outside his brain yet as they were still catalogued as near impossible without the right resources. It was like somewhere in the world he had a smarter, flashier, and vibranium rich twin.
Steve's cheeks filled with a soft pink blush and Tony cackled.
“I can’t hear.”
"Incoming."
“Who are you?” the soldier rasps with terror in his eyes but Tony doesn’t lower his guard or his hands. The soldier is an animal cornered but his teeth will still bite and his claws still rake. The woman washing at the sink doesn’t turn. They don’t exist to her.
“Well none of us are born for one thing.” Nyota snapped, fear making it hard for her to think. She had to calm down for everybody’s sake, even though her brain seemed stuck on an endless loop of
"Perhaps you are. That is for you to say.” Yinsen says slowly, cleaning his glasses with the hem of his shirt. “As for me, I think that knowledge is a worthy pursuit, but far more important is what a man does with what he knows."
“Quick, up here!” Barney called, leaping onto a fire escape and they followed. They are scrambling across the rooftops, agile and practiced, but slowed by the burdens they carried. Still, it would be harder for the pigs to follow them this way. They’d pulled off more than one robbery just this same way.
Tony grit his teeth but kept his face smooth. God but he hated how Natasha was right all the time, because that's what this was about of course.
He’d never known Bucky Barnes, but from Steve’s memories of him, Tony thought Barnes might understand what being Pride meant and want that for himself just as badly as Tony did.
His head was clamoring with noise and he cursed under his breath as a wave of dizziness struck him. He'd studied Maya's research enough to know what was coming and that it wasn't going to be pretty. If his body didn't reject the virus outright and kill him, too much adrenaline at any given time could finish the job. He didn't know how long he had before he wasn't able to move.
There was a horrible screeching sound as a pair of glowing hands suddenly punched through the roof of the car. Pepper screamed as they began literally peeling back the metal like it was candy wrapping and Tony's eyes flew to Bruce, curled against the door who looked like he was doing everything in his power to keep from Hulking out but Tony already knew there was no stopping it when the danger was this close.
He has a name and a history that fits like a glove but feels no less bought for the perfect fit. He remembers things like his training, and all the other assets he’s been asked to train who have come and gone after him. Some into a slim folder of success stories, but most to their graves.
Steve’s got water pouring over his face plastering his hair to his head like the worlds saddest puppy, and it should be ridiculous. Anyone else and the emotional awkwardness of this entire situation would have had Tony squirming out of his skin, but Tony might be well and truly fucked because instead his heart just aches and all he wants to do is wrap Steve up in a fluffy towel and never let him go.
Tony breathed deeply and let the days tension drain out of him, sleep rolling over him like tide.
Bruce wanted to ask if Tony was the first fel that Steve had ever watched go into heat, but it felt too nosey. He tapped down on the rise in anxiety by focusing on his breathing as he chose a mug from the cupboard.
"Do you think the military is behind it?"
Tony’s memory might be as perfect as pictures but he is still human. Much of how one recalls things are based on associations, and in his beginning, everything was brilliantly (terrifyingly) new. Existence, like reality, had exploded outward in one catastrophic bang.
That part had been easy. Tony could, thanks to Extremis, literally crack open SHIELD in his sleep if he wanted to- but sadly, going through all of SHIELDS files had provided little information.
“Super soldiers. What else?”
Oh damn. That was right. T’Challa had sliced through the tower security like sliced cheese.
He should probably talk to Steve too, Tony thought absently, let him know that he and Bruce were kissing now. Well they’d always been kissing, and occasionally fucking, but they’d sort of been on hiatus since he and Steve became a capital THING. Would Steve mind if Tony wanted to continue cuddling and kissing Bruce, maybe even sharing the occasional heat again?
Princess nodded slowly, thinking over the words. But because she was sharp, Tony wasn't surprised at all when she asked, "You don't trust General Ross, you wouldn’t sell him weapons. Whose army are we supporting?"
“I vote homo-tom.” Clint piped up, over from the observation area and Steve tossed him a very unimpressed stare as beside him Natasha nodded with a very serious frown of concentration on her face that would have convinced even Tony that she was serious if not for their bond ensured bullshit sensors.
“No you’re not Tony and that is the point.” The other fel snapped, eyes flashing dangerously and Tony swallowed what he'd been about to say.  "Pepper isn't pride. We are. We all agreed to this, but you refuse to try. You'll take every risk in the book but the one that's actually important.”
Peter swallowed, saying nothing. Tony was right. Most people didn’t know that stuff, except for some of the old ladies who had lived on the block forever. Mrs. Krentz still liked to gossip about it sometimes while she knitted on her porch and Peter played with her cats.
Sunday night, Tony got
Stark men are made of Iron.
Thor had been forced to attend more than a few weddings in his adolescence to pay honor to Asgards numerous allies, and thus had witnessed any number of strange traditions, but he enjoyed few of them as he enjoyed the Kǫtrdýr bonding ceremonies.
The brat pack was all present and accounted for. Anya was helping Kate serve the food. Billy was sitting with her brother Teddy like usual and Billy’s twin brother Tommy was zipping around the table, snagging food off the serving dishes before they even made it around the table and generally being a pest. Anya hit him with a spatula and he finally sat down. Billy looked like he hadn’t slept and wasn’t saying much and Teddy kept shooting him these concerned glances.
Jaime shuddered, his orange ears flattening comically at the memory.
It made sense to Clint. Fragile building, a few hundred possible civilian casualties. Confined space. Not the best setting for a Hulk rampage.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good boy Anthony! That’s my smart boy.”
Ross reminds them from time to time that they are an investment in the future and that he expects a return on that investment. They are property and nothing more. The reminders are painful.
"What the hell was that!"
“What?! No. I told you it was a spider. It got loose when he was showing me something in the lab and I got bit. That’s all I can tell you, but it wasn’t his fault. Master Osborne wouldn’t hurt me!”
“A lot hotter up here,” she answered a moment later, sounding slightly winded. “Watch out for the ones that glow.”
This is how the Avengers Pride begins.
Steve startled out of his thoughts at the sound of the unfamiliar voice. He turned, surprised to find the owner of that voice was a dark skinned kat he didn’t know. He was in the company of Rhodes though, so Steve tried to school his expression towards friendly rather than suspicious.
"All that trouble just for a bird?" Clint scoffed and MiKall's furred brow furrowed into a frown.
Inside is a different story. Inside is all smoke and fire and the scent of terrified kats.
There'd never been enough reason to push before, not enough hope of seeing anything good come out of stirring the pot and making his handlers angry with him. But when he was twenty-five Tony had given him a chance, and Bruce had taken it.
"Then we are in agreement. It would be best if you accepted my mother's invitation to the wedding."
He’s also distracted by her and that’s a mistake because the solider’s fist slams against his skull and then a knife is tearing into his gut and his head explodes with pain.
Bruce smiled again, tender and almost shy and Tony couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t stand the thought that he’d hurt Bruce and the others and that Bruce had still trusted him enough to put himself at risk. Just so he wouldn’t wake up alone. Tony reached for his collar, snagging it and pulling him in close, pressing their lips together and shuddering at the warmth that immediately flushed through him.
The net was everywhere so it was pretty easy to find (thankfully) but, oh hey, turns out the world wide interweb is also mind-numbingly loud. Colors and sounds and codes rushed in all at once and Tony’s head felt like it split open. God it hurt. But he tried to think past it, tried to concentrate on just the parts he needed, traversing at lightning speed looking for just the right hub… And suddenly there he was in all his intricate beautiful code.
All those myths he’d heard as a kit, about how perfect everything had been once upon a time when Gata could bond with one another and live out their days in perfect bliss with their Pride were just wishful thinking if not utter bullshit.
Tony rolled his eyes and ignored the question to ask. "Remind me, what are we doing here?"
And then there’s someone else, another mind, and he’s falling into it, or taking it in, and he can’t tell which but it doesn’t matter.
“How does she do it?” Tony mused thoughtfully, ears twitching. “That woman is scary good sometimes.”
“Tony, you’re going into heat.” Steve insisted and at Tony’s shocked jerk he lowered his voice even further, pulling Tony closer by the hand on the small of his back. “Natasha says you’ve been focusing a lot of brain power elsewhere so maybe you didn’t put it together but it’s coming on. I can smell it.”
“Yeah, sorry sometimes that happens. Here’s what I need.” Tony raised a hand and began to tick off on his fingers before that despondent expression and the weight of loss could settle over the boy. “Warm blankets, medical tape, gauze, a laptop, a cell phone, a digital watch, a pneumatic actuator from your bazooka there, a map of town, a mirror, a pair of tweezers and the largest tuna-fish sandwich you can make. Can you get me those without getting into trouble?”
Anyway, once Jena got to the tower and got a chance to see that he was okay things had calmed down. Tony’s offer to pay for the damages at the family home and put the kit and his mother up in a cushy condo at the tower away from her mother had gone a long way towards smoothing things over; and Tony’s legal team had spared a few minutes from the feeding frenzy surrounding Viastone to make elderly Mrs. Keener think twice about doing anything hasty before Tony could talk to Jena about Harley’s future.
“What happened?” he asked, and this time he was the one who waited.
Tony swallowed, skin prickling strangely as T’Challa’s eyes bored into him, completely at a loss for words. It was strange and unexpected to hear the tom baldly admit to what sounded like feeling something real for him and to fear on top of that.
"Tony, what I did was wrong. I know that, but you know what Robert is like. I didn't have a choice."
partners. And Clint's pretty sick of the back burner. The only way he and Tony are going to resolve their issues is if they talk right? Clint would just like the record to show he hates emotional shit as much as Stark does and this is probably going to suck.
“What?”
Ivan pulls them from the flames and won’t say why. He tells them he was watching the rebels before they attacked the village, and they know he must have passed by the academy before and seen them there with their mistress, who taught young girls the art of dance. Ivan saw them dancing once, and asks now if they know the story behind the dance of swans.
"Why do you always gotta make it weird man?" Rhodey groaned. Clint for his part just stuck his tongue out in Tony's direction, but Luke seemed curious about this.
Steve crossed the remaining distance between them and stood just behind Tony’s chair as the fel slowly swiveled to face him, unable to hide the pain this close. His eyes were red, like he might have been crying ealier and Steve growled (at himself of all things) and pulled the slighter man into a hug. Tony was tense in his arms but he allowed it.
"Uh.. Sure?"
Shit.
They shot at him of course, but the armor took their bullets in stride and he didn’t hold back (couldn’t hold back) as he fired back, only satisfied when their trucks lit up and sent gears and metal flying every which way, and he’d sent these masked clowns scattering like the cowardly terrified mice they are.
To understand why he turned away and did what he did next, we will have to go back.
Normally Tony would have told any asshole who tried to tell him what he could or couldn't do in his own lab to fuck off and provided them with a detailed listing of the highest bridges in New York state; but the thing was it didn't feel like Luke was throwing his weight around actually trying to make him quit. He got the feeling that if he really did tell the tom to fuck off that he would.
He flinches, the weight of her disappointment in him falling on his shoulders and it’s too much. She’s his Queen, and through her it’s as if the whole Pride is suddenly looking down on him and shaking their heads; but more than that she is his mother, and he does not like to think he has disappointed her.
“You were caught?” he guessed.
"Sorry. Hugely intimidating, not at all tiny, massive in a perfectly feminine and non derogatory way. Have I mentioned you look fantastic in blue? Is Cap jealous you're wearing his colors?"
The intensity of the flare-ups kind of made him needy and in the thick of it he disliked the feeling of being empty, so the whole dildo thing was Bruce’s way of accommodating him and also nabbing some much-needed shut eye. Didn’t make it any less awkward on the flip side of things.
A polite round of claps, mostly from the staff Steve noticed, followed and Tony waited for it to die down before continuing.
“Are you sure? I thought they stagnated?”
See? You were the stupid fuck who signed your soul away, thinking you were going to be free or some shit. Of course you’re not. You’re still just an animal, only good for tricks or sic'ing some poor sod when master says ‘sic em,  and if you out live your use… well just make sure you never make that mistake.
"I used to hold the monopoly on excessive. I'm losing out to a reality TV star."
Because even now, Clint could still see him like it was yesterday. After months of dancing Clint had finally pushed them over the line into the realm of lovers. It cost him most of his secrets. Nights full of bare confessions with only scant parts omitted for professionalism's sake, because Tony wouldn't open for anything less than 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours'.
The thought of being a dad himself was kind of overwhelming for Steve. He didn't know a lot about kids, and it was completely different from managing troops. Would he even be any good at it?
“Relax,” Tony squeezed his hand. “You can’t frown this sort of thing into submission you know.”
“I want to build a nation.” Tony finally admitted out loud, throat tightening as the images circled above their heads. It had to be if the Gata who lived there were going to truly be granted freedom and keep it. It would not be an uncontested freedom, but Tony was going to give them all the teeth and claw they’d need to maintain it.
Steve knew how that sort of thing made Tony feel, but he didn’t want him to be scared. Neither Steve nor the others would let any harm come to him. He didn’t expect any argument so it came as a shock when Tony stiffened again in his arms and shook his head.
“The mercenaries were enhanced too,” Steve noted. “And so far they’ve only targeted OSCORP. You think Osborn is trying to create more Gata Soldiers, don’t you?”
“The red paint in the grooves is made from the dust of a meteor that struck my country. The mineral is known to conduct elctro-magnetic energy, which I’m sure Dr. Banner will confirm once he is through examining them. They reminded me of you and thought you might appreciate the extra boost when you are blasting your enemies.” T’Challa grinned cheekily as Tony’s eyebrows raised in surprise.
“That’s a good word. Keener, give me a spelling.” Steve prompted and Harley, who was currently polishing off what looked like the last strip of black peppered bacon from the early breakfast Bruce had whipped together for everyone, mumbled through a full mouth.
Tony has heard this story before and normally he listens avidly because he knows this is his legacy and it is very important. One day he will be in charge and it will be up to him to make sure Stark Industries survives.
Tony hummed thoughtfully, pretending to think about it.
Here’s the thing. Peter totally hadn’t applied to Tony Stark’s internship program. Not because it wouldn’t be the most amazing thing to ever happen to him, but because he knew Master Osborne would never allow it. He was nice to Peter but Tony Stark was his biggest competitor and Master Osborn had been talking for years about when Peter was old enough to start working at the lab and take over his father’s job. Master Osborne had been so good to pay for his school and Uncle Ben’s funeral expenses, and the leftover mortgage on their house. How could Peter insult him by asking to go work for Mr. Stark?
"You talking to Rogers or the fish?" Rhodey asked with a laugh as Tony all but yanked the plate away from Steve, who just looked amused by it.
“You knocked Tony up. That’s what’s going on.” Clint snapped and Steve paled. “He trusts me and Bruce to keep it together and not use our teeth, but I guess he didn’t know he was sleeping with a rookie.”
"If there is to be dancing later I must claim the first dance with our Man of Iron." Thor said in that declarative way he had. "I have claimed, as you say, dibbs."
“Trespassers will be shot, it’s on the sign.” The kit shrugged, and this close Tony could see that he was in fact a kit. He might have been able to smell it before even with the wooly hat covering the kids ears if he hadn’t been so distracted by you know, his teammate in medical duress and the potential for supped up super-villains to come barging in any moment. There were no medical supplies but the good news was someone clearly had enough interest in machines that there was enough stuff here that Tony was confident he could jury-rig a low grade repulsor together with his arc-reactor as a power source, but he’d need to fix the reactor first.
Smiling cheerfully Tony swaggered past him on his way toward the door, clapping a hand on Fury's shoulder along the way despite the frankly dangerous nature of his scowl.
It was heartbreaking to see how territorial these kits got over things that other kids took for granted, like new clothes and funny pairs of thick socks. It wasn't that far from what Steve remembered from being a kid growing up in the depression. You learned to guard what you had because you never knew when you'd lose it.
"So we agree then that Tony was the target." He let it go, but not without making sure she knew he didn't approve of her talking like that. Natasha's lips curled around the skin of her apple before she took a bite. Steve sighed. "I don't like it. Why go to that length just to get a reaction?"
time with an idiot who won’t listen.
"Did you have a nice night Sir?"
"You made him mad. Now he'll have it out for me."
The other kits giggled and Tubby’s ears drooped. Tony gave him a consoling pat on the head, then noticed that Stripes was eyeing the prized location on his stomach speculatively. A look from Tony made him think better of it as the older fel nudged the one Tubby had called Tink until she got the hint and climbed aboard.
“And he’s got no idea how to get that thing open?” Steve asked, sounding skeptical. The disk was completely smooth on all sides, the thin circles where its spokes presumably protruded were so seamless they were barely discernable on the edges. There were no buttons screws or hatches to present any clues on how to get it open to examine its inner workings and since it was indeed made with vibranium all attempts to crack it open had failed miserably.
“Do you live out here?” he gaped, putting together the cluttered but well used looking space with the fort and the boy’s sudden appearance from above. Extremis had already been kicking his ass by the time they’d pushed inside, he doubted it had given Natasha an opportunity to properly scope out the place.
“Perhaps you would like a change and I could order a steak for you this morning Sir? Perhaps with a side of salad?”
Using Prince T’Challa as a sounding board just made sense given that he was the only authority on Wakanda’s technology and its people that Tony had. Thus far he had proved himself to be trustworthy and had put a decent amount of faith in Tony that he would honor the bargains they had made and would not use any of his knew knowledge to harm Wakanda. A history changing, and unprecedented alliance was forming right under everyone’s noses and it was happening across the net in what basically amounted to texts. Tony’s life was weird.
Well then why the hell was he always threatening to bench him? Talk about mixed signals.
They kill for one another, die for one another, and prosper together. They’re sacred. They’re home.
"Do you want to know the real reason I stopped making weapons? It's because I realized that people only had one interest in dropping bigger and badder bombs on their neighbor just because they could, and the guys who sell them only care about the profit. Not so much about the hands they’re putting them in. I won’t be a part of that system again. But the world is the world. And we have to give our army what they need to protect our home."
"Negative." Clint's response was breathy and strained. "Got chased into a bit of a tight spot. I could use a pick up myself."
Natasha warned and Tony bit back a smile.
“As you are my host I will do as you do,” he said in a long suffering way, raising his long legs and putting his feet up till they rested side by side with Tony’s. Tony sipped his tea, but the mug didn’t do enough to cover his smug grin. Not that he was even trying to hide it.
“But you guys could still work on it right?” Jaime ventured into the devastated silence.
The wings of the Benu were a vibrant gold stained in streaks redder than blood Tony noted with awe as it opened its wicked looking beak.
T’Challa barked a bright laugh and shook his head, and Tony bit back a smile.
Resolved, Tony let the rage he’d kept contained for hours (days) free, let his thoughts slide away with another deep breath, giving himself permission to feel the thirst for vengeance and not to fear the consequences for his body.
Well, the short version is Clint decided to play hero and fucked the whole job up. He got his ass beat by his own brother and left to take the fall when the suits showed up.
Tony was close to his heat and the closer it got the more obvious the signs became; which for the residents of the tower (Bruce and Clint especially as the only toms he trusted to see him through heat) usually meant dealing with a lot of hormonal behavior.
“You always have to be the victim don’t you Tony?  You can’t even admit to yourself that it might have been real for me, that I wanted the best for both of us; but you decided I just wasn’t good enough for the great Tony Stark. That’s why you went behind my back and made those blockers.”
Belles wasn't the most glamourous club Tony had ever been to in his life, but he liked it better for it's  old brick, cheap Parisian décor and dedication to nostalgia. In his youth he'd been to some kennel joints dripping in diamonds, not a dark corner in sight, but just thinking about them even now left a bad taste in his mouth.
If he wanted this, they’d do it. And he wished he was strong enough to walk away from it. But he wasn't. Not even for her.
Bruce cleared his throat pointedly, nodding toward Harley who was entertaining himself by teasing DUMMY with his hovercraft, the little robot whirling around in circles trying to catch up to it.
"Are there any questions?" Helen prompted and Tony wasn't all that surprised when Steve, who had watched the presentation with intense focus and pursed lips throughout, was the first to speak up.
Nyota yawned and shivered. She tucked her bushy black tail in closer to her body as she curled up tighter in the pilot’s seat for warmth.
Because it’s not real (he) knows that.
He knew that reliving their old memories was the only time when Bucky got to be Bucky. When his days weren’t about the tortures he’d glimpsed in Natasha’s memories. He didn’t care how dangerous it was, he wasn’t going to take that away – not when it could be the key to bringing Bucky back!
“Yes, it is a shame that your father and I cannot trust you to your schooling and must receive endless complaints from your teacher.”
Those who Tony loved who’d demanded to be present for the proceedings were gathered in the waiting room, separated by a thick wall of glass with a view into the operation room.
“But Steve lives and loves by extremes. By the time he realizes it’s time to let go, everything will be broken.”
Natasha touched the small lump where E.T. was secreted away in a pocket of her suit, and smiled to herself.  She settled into her perch to wait. She'd watch for a few days, make certain of their routine, and then she'd infiltrate under the cover of darkness.
“Tony, are you alright? Can you speak?” Steve demands, hands gently cradling Tony as the room comes back into focus and slowly the pressure inside Tony’s skull receded.
“Tony.” That low modulated voice came through the mouthpiece of Catman’s mask (helmet?) in soft but firm demand, accompanied by a low rumbling purr that Tony realized he should find alarming but his senses weren’t in on that bit of intel. He wanted to close his eyes and sink into that sound. All the more reason he should be fighting right?
The kats at the center were
“So, do you really think JOCASTA did it? Do you think this is our earth?”
Peter’s uncle Ben had always said everybody had a responsibility to help others when they could. It was scary sometimes. Like when Uncle Ben and Aunt May had taken him to the Stark Expo for an early birthday present and those robots had attacked. He’d been so scared, and he couldn’t find his aunt and uncle anywhere in the chaos and suddenly he was alone, and that robot had been coming for him.
Matias stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled sharply for quiet.
Well that... that was not where Tony had expected this day to end, he thought as something like a net full of butterflies was let loose in his stomach. Could they really do this? Should they do this?!
In what seemed like a split second the confrontation was over, the black-costumed tom already sprinting to Natasha's aide, unworthy opponent left to crumble behind him.
"It's alright. You're not in that place anymore. You're here with me. With us. We've got you Tasha."
“Thanks for the help asshole.” Tony huffed as he shut the door behind him and Barton just shrugged before throwing the truck into gear and pulling away from the side of the road.
Something about fools rushing in... Appropriate really. Tony felt like a fool. The biggest of fools, staring into the eyes of someone too beautiful to be real, to good to ever be his, and just letting himself slide deeper and deeper, their bodies swaying closer together.
He’d been grateful not to be dead, but he never made any mistake that to SHIELD he was just a tool. A good operative. Useful. He had new masters but the golden rule still applied. Never outlive your use.
Rather dangerously, Tony liked the way T’Challa was looking at him now even more, the tom’s focus intent and heated almost like he was on the edge of fight, only there was no sharp pepper in Tony’s nose, just the beguiling scent notes that came with attraction. Just biology Tony reminded himself. Just a toms way of entreating a fel to come closer. Nothing more to it.
These bonds they made with their beating hearts. They were more precious than any sacred gem to be found in all the realms, and they should be protected and cherished as such. There was no time for that like the Feast of Months that followed the Great Hunt for celebrating with your brethren. Thor had always done so with style and reckless abandonment but always, Loki had been there to watch over him and on his most favorite (and the most legendary) of occasions, to join in.
“Been colder. We used to sit on the roof of our old building, Bucky and I, to look at the stars. Was the only place in the whole building it felt like you could get some privacy.”
“Have you dreamed about him before? This Winter Soldier?” he asked, expecting it when Steve slowly nodded with an air of lingering guilt.
“I’m sorry.” Steve hoped it sounded genuine because he was. But how could he accept how someone she’d loved could have betrayed her that way, put her through something like that?
Instead of trying to reverse the effects of the domestication drugs and create pride capable felines, why not find the perfect man and give him the feline gifts?
Steve had given him his soon to be patented concerned Liberty Hen look and reminded Tony that he wasn’t infallible and that Tony’s comfort and consent should always be the priority when it came to his heats. Rather proving Tony’s whole point, which he’d smirked at but Bruce was in a serious mood and didn’t seem to be feeling what a fine morning it was the same way Tony was. To be fair, he doubted his friend had been treated to an enthusiastic round of morning sex so Tony would give him that. Poor Bruce.
“No crazier than anything else we’ve tried.” Riri shrugged.
“And Steve?”
Which explained why the morning of the twenty-fourth found Tony up at seven in the morning, freshly showered, nursing his third cup of coffee, eyeing Steve Rogers critically as the man in question buckled on a pair of authentic reindeer hide boots, his mouth frowning as his hands examined their gold buckles.
Steve had no idea what he was talking about but judging by Senator Stern’s venomous glare, Tony had likely hacked somebody’s computer again for information he shouldn’t have.
So there they were, both crashing into their biological imperatives for the first time, and the media can say what it wants but here's a pro tip: Tony Stark is a huge nerd who can't handle his own emotions for shit, and sure he's pretty slick and flashy when he wants to be, but if you bought that dog and pony show more the fool you.
“You’re a person Steve.” Tony snapped his fingers excitedly as the metaphorical lightbulb went on. “A tom-person. I like it.”
Unimportant. He had to finish the mission. Ivan tossed the object aside and ran through the door of the shop, drawing his short rifle out of the folds of his jacket. He ignored the shouts of several officers who came running toward him from the south end of the strip, their shoes squeaking and squealing on the polished floor. His eyes searching and finding instead where the fourth armored kat was running with the Walsh girl a floor below, headed toward the second set of escalators. They’d been distracting the most dangerous players on the field to give their teammate time to get away, but Ivan could not let them get away.
"What's it for?" Tony asks, ever curious and Yinsen cocks his head equally curious in return.
“Tony is strong, and our friends in there as well as on other worlds will see to it that he is well taken care of.” Thor was saying. Steve looked up curiously, waiting for him to explain. Thor had gotten back from Asgard late that morning, just when they’d all begun to worry that something might have happened to him. Steve knew he wouldn’t have missed this if he could help it.
“That blade, it’s Wakandain too isn’t it?” Tony asked tersely, and T’Challa looked to him, hesitating a fraction of a moment before he nodded solemnly.
Tony fisted his hands snarling in irritation as he read the message over again.  His first instinct was to think the prince was being condescending and calling him a reckless idiot, but his gut told him differently. T’Challa, even back when he was pretending to be a lowly medical aide, had never met Tony with anything but the frank expectation that he was a capable leader and would act accordingly. He wasn’t always gentle with censure when Tony dipped into the sort of behavior Pepper and Rhodey had always coined childish, but in a lot of ways Tony preferred that to the way his two oldest friends tended to coddle him.
“Tell Tony I’m home. I don’t want to be locked out of the workshop for six hours like last time.”
"That's good to hear." Steve murmured, turning to slide his arms around Tony's waist. They weren't the only ones dancing to the slow trickling music coming from the band. To Steve’s wonder Nakia and Natasha had taken up a dance, and though the other guests were giving them a wide berth they were impossible not to watch. The she-tom and the fel appeared to be trying to out do each other and the intensity of their private little competition was practically electric in the air. Maybe the most striking thing about it was how wild they both looked. Both of them exhibiting grace and power with every movement they made, sweat glistening off of the columns of their throats, no collars or tags in sight and no apologies for it.
Senseless, dirty work that could get people like Peter (whose only crime was that he was that he was undomesticated) killed.  While Steve and Natasha were out there in the field, trying to mitigate the damage and keep the search team honest Tony could focus on doing what he did best, which was stripping the problem down to its basics and solving it.
It had been jarring to see him in the flesh, to almost have Howard standing there, but not be able to pretend even for a moment that he was home again because the physical differences between Tony and his father were unignorably there, in the marks of a woman Steve would never know.
“Was he experimenting on you?” Tony demanded, his scent going sharp with danger in Peter’s nose and he hastily shook his head.
Tony's words were met with gratifying silence and his mouth spread in a victorious grin. One point Stark. Though honestly, if the guy still excepted Tony to assume he was from around here he shouldn't have brought his toys to the party.
Well there you have it Simon. It looks like for at least some lucky kittens, beauty really does tame the beast. After this break we’ll be joined by Dr. Lauren Vassals, author of “So you’re not alone in the universe”. She’s here to weigh in on the hottest topic of the year. Should our knowledge of extra-terrestrials change the federal stance on inter-species relationships? Find out when we come back.
They'd kissed before this, but Tony didn't misunderstand the question. Steve was asking if he could kiss Tony with meaning, with declarations and commitment attached. Once more now with purpose. No more wandering eyes, no more side flirtations. A kiss, like a promise. A promise they'd make to each other.
"No. Make yourself at home. Everybody else does," Tony answered between swallows of his breakfast. "And don't believe half of what this asshole says, unless he was telling you what an amazing person I am and how fantastic I am in bed, then by all means."
Tony woke with a sharp gasp, lunging up in bed, the strange nightmare still holding him in its grip for a heart-pounding moment until a whimper pulled his attention away from his slamming heart and the panic of going from that brilliant wonderful dream to whatever the hell that had been in the end.
“And yet, people find something about watching your husband hump a fifteen-year-old distasteful. Imagine that.” He replied, reaching for his drink. Then he added, like it was an afterthought, “Which I’m sure you do, constantly, what with the company stock in the shit hole and all the public embarrassment.”
Excuse me Dr…. [pause] Trask? I’m not sure what you’ve heard but The Avengers are a voluntary critical response unit.
Tony made a face, whiskers twitching with distaste. And because Steve was an asshole Tony heard his thoughts loud and clear when he smiled, thinking about how
Tony on the other hand is a bit of a train wreck (most days) and this morning was no exception, but if he could go back to just thirty minutes ago - when he’d been choking on his bacon with laughter at the mental image of Liberty Hen, and Steve was getting him back for poking fun with a peculiar but A-Okay form of punishment that involved pinning Tony to the bed and kissing him breathless - he would.
"Barnes again?" He asked gently, but to his surprise Steve shook his head.
Furnace.
“Yeah?” Tony panted as Steve leaned down to kiss and suck at his neck, breath coming hard and hot as he continued to stroke him toward completion.
Tony wrinkled his nose.
Tony, still staring at the tom, abruptly burst out laughing. He must look deranged because T’Challa understandably looked perplexed, even a little uneasy.
There’s a little girl asleep halfway on top of him, her mass of dark ringlets pushing against the boy’s cheek. He doesn’t seem to mind.
At her words Tony's smile went stiff.
He knew he was right when she sagged again, the strength seemingly gone from her, and her skin felt like ice pressed against his. It didn't help that that ominous humming in his  ears had quieted.
that Tony had ever beheld.
It is dark and quiet on the flight deck. Nyota sits alone in the pilot’s chair, the ARK’s eleven other occupants catching what rest they can since they’d successfully tunneled out of Earth designate 1204 after the Builders had detonated it. Whether or not the device had actually done as she’d hoped and brought them back through space and time to their home universe before the incursion destroyed it, had yet to be determined.
“Alright so, we can’t just drop in on them and take them up on the ark. At least not until history plays out and we’re closer to the incursion point,” Riri theorized and Kate snorted, her dark eyebrows arching.
Steve shrugged.
Because Tony understood. He and Peter were alike. He’d just said so!
A/N: This is a companion piece to The Sound of Music it's told in first person because we're going into Tony's cerebral space and it felt fitting. That and I love that style lol. Hopefully you like this piece as much as I enjoyed weaving it together.
Selfish. Stupid. He should have kept them secret. Should never have bragged about the teachers he’d brought in to educate them, the healers who were helping them see themselves as people and not just animals. Should never have painted that tempting red X and begged his enemies to fire at will.
Thor and Steve were nowhere to be found and Tony was still tangled up with Bruce who was blinking dazedly in the darkness trying to make sense of what was happening.
“Dude, like what?” Tommy asked.
When Steve gave him a questioning look Tony just shrugged.
"Thor, you take the lab in Switzerland. As their public face it's not likely they're doing anything illegal there but we can't discount it.  Clint and I will handle the two facilities here in New York. Let's agree that this is a stake out only. You see anything that looks like what we're looking for you find a hole somewhere and call the others in. Understood?"
The Cradle was ready and Bruce and Helen as ready as they’d ever be for the maiden voyage of what amounted to a medically revolutionizing procedure. If it was a success their patented technology would change the shape of the world. Well, correction. Kats can’t own patents (unless they inherit them the way that Tony did) but corporations can and Pepper has tied the Cradle and their nanobot tech up in so much legal red tape it would take three lifetimes to untangle it, so bygones.
Wanda’s lip quirks upward in a hint of a smile. She says nothing about the threat he knows she can read in his thoughts.
Which means there’s this beautiful little girl with spunk, who wakes up grumpy as a poked grizzly bear, who doesn’t belong to Bruce. A little girl whose father is missing for undetermined reasons who prefers to stay in a tower with Tony when her father is gone, and has a name so evident of Tony’s inner nerd he’s at a damn loss as to how to explain it.
Instantly, Tony’s mind flashed to Steve and the way that their bodies cradled one another as they slept, limbs intertwined, but then he remembered that Steve wasn’t coming to bed anytime soon, would likely spend the entire night buried in SHIELD files; and just as quickly something else came to mind. He saw himself getting into bed, and wrapping his arms around T’Challa’s broad chest and seeing what kind of body pillow he’d make.
In the midst of the commotion he saw Ty stalking toward him just as a black shadow darted through the corner of his vision. For a moment he thought it must be another one of his teammates, but nobody on the team moved like that he realized as the black-clad figure clashed with the tom.
The tide was turning. The fight for their lives was brewing and money wasn’t going to be enough to stop it this time. Tony couldn’t afford to prioritize his tangled feelings over doing what was best for the people in his care. He’d promised them more than safety. He’d promised them a future.
“No, but they’re going to change their minds when you offer them something they can’t get anywhere else. Vibranium.”
He worked silently and JARVIS knew him too well to intrude on his thoughts while he stewed on the problem at hand.
As Coulson spoke JARVIS projected images of each of the properties along with the information they’d compiled on the number of employees and other stats.
“Not because women are seen as inferior, but because only a male heir will be able to spawn children with the next Queen of the Panther Pride, that about right?” Tony added and this time T’Challa narrowed his eyes at him suspiciously.
when he is nothing and nobody. His broken body doesn’t understand that. The urge to protect his pride, his
“Didn’t SHIELD brief you on the team? Thor’s not from around here. His mother knows the original cat-woman who probably helped get the Alurio started.”
Tony looked the picture of confidence as he waited for the axe to fall, feeling the kind of calm he usually only felt when he suited up in the armor, the confidence of a predator comfortable in his skin. He might not be a prince and he might not be able to trace his ancestor back further than fucking Howard but this was his territory and he was king in it. Or Queen. Pick your poison. He’d seen already just how dangerous he could be even without his armor, and these days he was only getting more dangerous.
The morning is beautiful so people stop and remark on it. They smell roses. They argue over nothing as if they have all the time in the world and then they laugh like old friends, wasting more time reminiscing. There is music pouring out of the open doors of a café and a man is singing as he sweeps. A woman is rushing to greet her friend with open arms brightly exclaiming and waving, "Buongiorno!"
Steve hadn't spent a great deal of time thinking about having children. Truthfully part of it was because he hadn't been able to picture a dame wanting to hitch her star to a wagon like his, but mostly because he'd been in love with Bucky almost longer than he could remember. That had made things complicated.
There’s a click and then Tony is gone. Steve jerked, like he might throw his ear link but thankfully nothing went flying, even if he did curse vehemently under his breath. Clint could give him a hard time about it but his guts a little too tight and the moment passes.
She'd live only if she was better than her enemy.
“You can’t deny it Stark. Didn’t I tell you I’d make you greater?” Killian leaned down to crow, while Tony struggled beneath the crushing weight on his chest. The guy looked crazed. His clothes were mostly burnt through and his skin looked like a lava lamp, pulsing and glowing dangerously, but he either didn’t notice or didn’t care. Tony hoped he blew sky high.
“Because we were never able to stabilize it. When we began testing on human subjects some of them reacted negatively. There were casualties… the government shut us down. Killian didn’t want to accept that answer, he wanted to keep going. When I refused he fired me.”
Oh good.
“I am rerouting SHIELD backup to you Sir, but for the safety of civilians and other agents, Agent Coulson is unable to issue a no kill order.”
“That complicates things. We have plenty of Alurian scientists in Wakanda but I’m not sure how many will agree to come here. Your country is not safe for them and I will not recklessly endanger my people.”
A/N I recently recovered the hard drive with a bunch of my old works on it and got inspired by rereading my notes on this story. I have no idea if anyone is still reading this but I will let the creative juices do what they do. Enjoy.
He wanted to trust T'Challa, he did, but he wasn't stupid enough to put so much faith in the unproven when innocent gata sitting at home just trying to make the most of their lives were the ones who would pay the price for his misplaced faith.
Maybe reading his thoughts because his barriers were still so shitty or maybe T’Challa had just gotten to know him that well, the tom frowned and reached for the hand Bruce wasn’t currently holding and said, “You still need to rest Tony, and no matter how badly you’ll want your pack close while you heal you must protect your mind and theirs by taking things slowly.”
“Not helpful Clint. Steve and I are adults, and everything we engaged in last night was consensual. Every last bit. You want a play by play?”
A Pride was built around a marriage of many minds yes, but it was not without a center, and if the core was weak, then the body would be weak.
Up ahead a woman emerges from a corridor, her pearl white hair swishing across her bared shoulders, striped ears twitching as her eyes scan the hall.
Nyota mouthed a silent apology and refocused on her work. Watching the news and combing the internet for footage of their parents was pretty much the highlight of everybody’s day around here. She wasn’t sure how healthy it was, especially for the younger kits, but she didn’t have the heart to force them to stop. Besides, studying the current times was important if they wanted even a slim chance of correctly guising what they had to change to save the future and what had to stay the same so that they didn’t Artie Mcfly themselves.
Sure enough, by the time Clint arrived at the jet it was to find Banner and Steve climbing aboard, Natasha already strapping into the pilot’s chair and Tony nowhere in sight. Thor is off world again so his absence was pretty much expected. Some protective instinct in Clint didn’t like that Tony wasn’t there where they can protect him, but he shoves that animal voice in the back of his head down because it was a distraction and he knew as well as anybody that Tony could take care of himself, heat or no heat.
Yep. You heard that right six. They’d tried five other stabilizing formulas and besides making Tony violently ill before the virus could wipe the thing out of his system they’d not gotten any results. It was exhausting, and terrifying, because if they couldn’t stabilize the damn thing then he was no better than a ticking time bomb. One of these days, the virus was going to get the better of him.
“Same story different day Stark. What’s with you man?” Rhodey prodded. “You need to keep your head in the game. Why are you letting that tired old shit get to you?”
“You’re what?! Tony, Natasha doesn’t have time to – ”
Thor's companions had been given rooms near his in the north tower of the citadel, where they could look out over the great city and the plains of Iðavöllr beyond it.
He had fully expected his ownership to be transferred to Stane, because with as much as Tony did behind the scenes for R&D Howard would never trust Rhodey, a military man, not to take advantage no matter how many times the man asked.
His feet were nice and toasty what with a rather contented looking Natasha claiming his legs as the perfect resting post, but Tony's back was getting chilled what with all that glaringly empty spacy behind him.
Her expression didn't change but he saw the way her eyes widened the tiniest fraction and nobody spoke. Tony wondered for a moment what he'd said to get that sort of reaction before it hit him.
Wordlessly he and Bruce crawled closer, lending Clint their aid in warming up her chilled skin, none of them speaking except for Clint who murmured soft soothing things in her ear.
Grandma and Grandpa had loved dad and treated him like a son, no different from uncle Ben. In return the Osbornes had always made sure that the Parkers wanted for nothing. Though the Parkers had insisted on living simple in their little house in Queens, Richard had been given the best tutors and an instant playmate in his half-brother Norman.
“Hey, look at that Bruce,” he said, capturing the tom’s attention and nodding toward Luke. “Turns out we do have a qualified medical professional in residence.”
Tony pinned Peter with a rather serious look and continued, “First things first, you and I need to have a talk about what happened that night at Oscorp. It’s important that the Avengers catch the thieves before they can hurt anyone. You do know why, don’t you Peter?”
Clint's tail brushed Tony's face rather rudely as the tom shimmied past him to reach Natasha, who was curled in the center of the bed in a tiny ball, shivering and hollow eyed in a way that Tony had never seen before.
IT IS NEVER SAFE. AS FOR CONTROL, YOU ARE THE BEST JUDGE OF THE PROGRESS YOU’VE MADE WITH THE PROFESSOR. YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND YOU ARE NOT A CHILD WHO WOULD TAKE THESE RISKS LIGHTLY. ASK WHAT IT IS YOU REALLY MEAN TO ASK.
"They're not the enemy Hughard. Not yet, and we should all be doing our best to ease these tensions instead of poking at the embers or eventually they’ll catch fire.” Mama says and Hughard grunts. And then she says in this weird poignant way, “Besides. You never complained about climbing into bed before."
“I’m sorry, it’s just that…” Tony struggled to get ahold of himself, unable to stop grinning with mirth. “No it really doesn’t, but it definitely should. Thank you.”
“Uh- I told you I was… walking… ” Tony waved the kit to silence and Peter tapered off.
Steve crossed his arms and clenched his teeth harder.
And then because JARVIS knew Tony better than that, he continued, "Armor integrity levels currently reside at sixty percent, however there is a some sort of magnetic interference. I believe it is a result of the hit from the energy beam. You may be in some trouble."
“He’s a good kid.” He stated simply, keeping his pace slow as they meandered in the general direction of the elevator. Jena nodded and silence descended. She was young for a mother of a ten-year-old boy, and showing all the signs of being over tired and over worked. Her clothes probably hadn’t been new in years and hung off her in a way that suggested she’d lost weight since they’d been bought. There were stress lines appearing prematurely on her face and her hair didn’t look like it hadn’t seen anything but a five-dollar cut in years. She couldn’t have looked farther from him, but it was hard for Tony not to imagine his father standing in her shoes making excuses to his friends for Tony’s big mouth.
"He's a genius, and you know I don't say that lightly. He had to be to get this far, and to get snapped up by SHIELD. So the real problem here is personal bias. Despite all logic, the only thing that will make you feel better is if you hear it from some Dr. Round Ears. And while I get that, it's just something you're gonna have to get over."
Some irrational part of him didn’t care that the wires T’Challa was hooking up to Tony served a purpose, only that Tony was in danger, about to be hurt, and that those hands were helping. A nudge here, a gentle stroke there. Those hands were touching what they had no right to touch.
Tony didn’t answer immediately but Steve could feel the way his body was slowly unwinding beneath his hand as the fel leaned into him, melting against his front with a heavy sigh.
And it was just good not to feel like he was the only one who’d taken the bait for once; because when he’d told the team, far from getting the united experience of shock and betrayal that the situation definitely warranted, Tony had received luke-warm shrugs and expectant nods.
“What?! Tony no!”
Tony hated galas. Ever since Howard Stark had shocked the world by leaving his company to his kat, Tony had been thrust center stage and he’d long since accustomed himself to the spotlight, but he still despised the whole thing (necessary evil or not).
I’m sorry have you two met?
Agent Coulson, sitting up in the passenger’s seat turned to glance back at them, eyeing the aide momentarily and then the cup in his hand.
There had been a big hub-bub about a group of mercenaries who'd gotten into some hot water trying to invade a country that previously only a very small list of people had been aware. Tony remembered it so well because it had been the winter before Afghanistan and the footage that had leaked of some of the technology coming out of that jungle was so unbelievable he still hadn't forgiven Pepper for canceling his order for a jet.
She was still standing on the other side of Steve’s bed, looking down on him. Her thoughts indiscernible to the outside observer, but she allowed Tony to feel her sadness, if from a distance.  Even so, the depth of it was sobering and made the food in Tony’s mouth taste like ash.
"Go. Get Stark and leave this place." A rough modulated voice growled from the guy in the cat suit as he tossed something long and thin in Natacha's direction. "I will hold him as long as I can."
“Debar hasn’t tried to contact you since…” Steve began to ask but the sudden shuttering of Tony’s expression made him falter. None of them had heard from Debar or seen his masked alter-ego around town since Tony had discovered his identity. Tony figured the tom had skipped town once he’d realized his cover was about to be blown. Steve hoped it was as simple as that, but in his experience when people put that much effort into an operation it rarely was.
"I'll second that." Bruce murmured with an apologetic smile in Tony's direction to which Clint raised three fingers in silent agreement and Thor slapped the table enough to rattle the fixtures on top and declared loudly, "Well spoken, Miss Potts."
“How did you know that?”
He could actually hear it humming in the center of his chest and was tempted to laugh. Guess there was no escaping the whole heart made of meta and gears thing now.
*ducks* I'm sorry for the cliff hanger. But at least you know you only have to wait a week to figure out how Tony and Natasha got where they are and how they're going to get out of it. Thoughts? Feelings? Predictions? Any guesses as to what happened to Tony and Natasha? I hope you're enjoying the trip into Natasha's head. The decision to make her a secret literature enthusiast came purely from imagining kitty!Natasha snuggled up by a fire with the kits and a giant book.Too cute to resist and I promise we're getting to the fluff and cute part, but you know they all have to come together first and they like to take their time about it.
"I don't know Tony. Leaving your team behind. Jumping out of your suit. I personally think cognitively impaired was generous," she responded out of the side of her mouth and Tony thought he saw Natasha incline her head in an agreement.
"You get her home safe son." he mimicked as Steve pulled him close to his chest. "Do you hear yourself when you talk, Captain Dad? I bet you're gonna keep looking over my shoulder all night, checking up on her."
Almost as if on cue Amory came running into the canteen, his dark hair looking windswept and his fur standing on end.
I am so sorry for how long this has taken. It has been sitting in pieces on my computer. I intended it to be longer and cover the actual confrontation between the Avengers and Bucky's crew but things are super busy right now it would just take me twice as long to get it out there and I was at a good stopping point. Thank you for your patience.
He wanted Harley to go to school with Tink and the other kits, because nobody questioned whether or not they could learn and the necessity of an education. He wanted high walls and thick doors and nothing but blue skies for miles in a place where he could entertain the thought of raising a family without a sick twist of dread and the ash of despair in his mouth.
“That doesn’t explain how Viastone got involved.” Clint pointed out, tone brusque and waspish. Natasha noticed that his claws were starting to show. She could see them beginning to poke painfully into his clenched palms but Clint of course didn’t even flinch. Both of them knew it was better not to alert the enemy you were armed or to waste precious seconds getting there.
"Do whatever you want Feather Brain, if you and Agent want to knock boots and try for kits be my guest. Why bother asking me?"
"Their tests are designed to stop you from ever reaching the gate, and when you do walk through the doors of their classrooms you will be marginalized, ostracized, and unfairly scrutinized. No one will wonder why your scores are lower, your attitude always labeled combatant, and when you are dropped from their programs they will say it was because you never had any business being there in the first place.
It irritates Tony that it's just a
“Because it is and that would be awesome.” Tony replied with a shrug, not quite seeing what her point was.
She looked like she wanted to hit him but the frown was all she had strength for.
Steve noticed the way both responded to T’Challa’s commands without argument, like soldiers on a battlefield falling into line, happy to let a commanding officer tell them what to do, how to survive the next frantic minute and the next with a ritual of orders perfectly executed.
“Just as long as you guys plan on showing up. Hear it’s going to be a rager.”
But that was a mystery to solve for another day. Tony had more than enough on his plate hunting down the mercenaries, finalizing the line of smart prosthetic appendages he was working on as the first production to come out of Stark Resilience as well as organizing a fresh R&D team for the fledgling company that could eagerly as well as legally make the transition over to the island base of operations once the build was finished.
"Somebody explain this idiocy to me. Start talking now!"
“uh-huh” Bruce opened his eyes with a tired yawn, blinking slowly before he focused on Tony who was squirming in the universal signal of bladder related discomfort and chuckled, untangling their limbs. He watched as Tony sat up, removing the dildo with a low hiss of displeasure, ears twitching when he noticed Bruce smiling at him. Bruce didn’t look all that concerned with his irritation.
They'd been sleeping together for under a month, only that night Clint couldn't sleep because he was royally fucked and he knew it. Tony had wandered into the kitchen in those ridiculous sweat pants and that holey tank top with his hair all mussed, and asked him if he'd like a mug of warm cream.
Soon. Soon things would be right.
Tony giggles and rolls his eyes. He knows languages can't dance. They're not physical. But he likes something about the picture it makes anyway.
He wants to be there so badly, but Vankov is prattling on about how Tony needs to study and how if he doesn’t take his education seriously he’s going to be a worthless drain on society, and Tony just starts reciting from the first page, because he already knows this!
"Oh, was she trying to spare me?” he scoffed. His gums itched and he had the strong urge to bare his teeth at them both but he resisted. He didn’t actually want to fight them. Not really. He wanted so much better for them all, but they had to deal with this first and he wasn’t happy about it. Not one bit.
The virus had not only revitalized the damaged and underperforming portions of his body, it had unlocked many of the dark areas that the human brain (Catus or otherwise) did not use in the first place. The effects on the brain had been different with each of the test subjects the virus had been used on, with many developing strange "super powers" across a wide spectrum.
The fact that she could be bonded to him, that they could share every memory and see the strongest parts of each other, and she could still think him so
He wasn't going to run away, Tony determined holding tightly to Steve's back. Not this time. To hell with self-doubt. Pity party over. No more demeaning himself and his relationships. He was fucking Ironman and Captain America never quit. If the two of them couldn't make it work then it wouldn't be for holding back.
He couldn’t fail the mission.
Clint got another case of the hero bug and decided that he couldn't sleep with Tony, even when he was dying from palladium poisoning and his heat had made him forget all his reasons for holding back; because Tony didn't know the truth and Clint couldn't be one more person who used him.
Natasha was struggling, because whatever version of extremis Killian had been dousing himself with he'd obviously saved the best stuff for himself because his skin was glowing and the strength he was displaying was incredible.
TO ME THAT SAYS THEY HAVEN’T TAKEN THE TIME TO PROPERLY STUDY THEIR TARGET BEFORE PUTTING A PLAN INTO ACTION.
“So… to begin, I think if there’s anything important we want to say to each other…” Bruce scratched the scruff on his chin kind of sheepishly and Tony felt a rush of affection for him.
“They’re talking about you and Jamie again” Kate announced without looking up from her tablet screen.
“Steve." She looked at him again. "You should always expect that Tony’s going to be thinking ahead of you. Stark will hold something close to his vest in one hand even when he’s showing you something with the other.”
But Andre continued to smirk, oblivious to the fact that Tony was only paying attention to him at all because he was still negotiating with his mistress and insulting her favorite lap kitty wouldn’t do him any favors.
“The truth is a matter of circumstance, Rogers. It's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I. “Natasha’s answer was dry and her smirk was knowing, like she’d already counted on him rejecting her advice. She probably had, and it was sad to think that even so, she believed the words she was saying.
“You’re not my mother.” Tommy stuck his tongue out at her.
"I was kind of a big fan boy. I was five shut up." Steve chuckled when Tony poked his chest. "The point is you're full of shit."
He efficiently cleaned the burn site with careful dabs of the towel he held. Clint wouldn't have called his grip gentle but it was certainly practiced.
“He’s not fucking real Rogers!” Tony snarled, and maybe it was harsh but sometimes harsh was all there was. He ripped down the barrier between their minds and the others, let Steve feel their pain and terror for a moment before he threw it back up.
“He was already perfect.” A heavily modulated voice growled unexpectedly as a feline scream ripped through the air. Killian straightened and Tony sucked in a breath as the weight on his chest relieved, but Killian wasn’t quick enough to defend himself from the dark shadow that passed over Tony as a familiar costumed (friend?) leapt through the air, wrapped his powerful legs around Killian’s neck and arched backwards, throwing the villain over his shoulders and lashing him smartly with that barbed tail of his for good measure as he fell.
Harley barely slowed down as he darted into the Avengers living room toward the couch where Tony sat, in the middle of snarking through a Star Trek rerun with the rest of the team. Even Coulson had found a minute for a breather, and Clint was curled up contently in the man’s lap. At the sight of the boy and his still timid looking mother following behind him he had the grace to shift a bit so his position was a little bit less intimate.
That little joke had even Tony looking up from his bowl to stare at him (because it had to be a joke). Luke just continued to eat, taking an almost dainty bite as his mouth curved upward in amusement. The spoon clinking softly against the bottom of the bowl seemed twice as loud with everybody’s focus on him.
“What’s with the face? This is not the worst thing you’ve caught me doing.”
MO NIFE RE
“Yeah so, hands to yourself and all, but you can keep them. I’m not in the business of biting off people’s hands.”
Yes he would like another helping of food and of course his fur is naturally that soft.
“Aye, it is a common practice among the royal houses that is true. Though I see now how it can bring much more trouble than it avoids.” Thor answered with a grave tone and Tony knew for sure now that he was thinking of Loki and all that they had suffered and lost between them. After a heavy moment of silence he appeared to put the weight on his shoulders aside and smiled to lighten the mood.
The answer to that question (and many others) is complicated, but the simplified version is it’s all Rhodey’s fault.
"I had it guys," Tony grit out as soon as the petulant tom was out of earshot and he tried not to think of it as pouting when Clint slung his arm over Tony's shoulder and he continued to scowl. "No seriously. Hello. Iron Man. Feral kat. I can handle myself."
It had Tony’s hindbrain lighting up and coming up with all sorts of stupid thoughts like maybe he should make himself small and bare his throat so that he didn’t come off as a threat.
Thor was frowning thoughtfully and seemed to realize the other occupants of the room were staring blankly at him and shrugged.
Or at least that's what should have happened, because he made all the right moves to make that happen; but then he felt a firm grip around his tail and a firmer tug had his creeper seat rolling backward.
“In all those stories our parents told us, do you remember what made things so hard? It wasn’t the war, it was trying to keep the government from taking me. I was the reason dad realized he couldn’t lead the team anymore.”
Bruce, no dull knife, seemed to have guessed where Tony was going and slowly began to shake his head.
“What’s a geriatric citizen?” a kitten with a tattered ear asked shyly, and Tony frowned as a chubby little tom snickered at her until she curled herself in a tiny protective ball.
.” She insisted, clutching her tablet tightly for a moment before she seemed to realize how intense she was being and forced herself to relax with a deep breath.
“I’ve known from the beginning that what Tony saw was a could have been, rather than a picture of what is going to be.” She confessed, and Steve’s eyes widened in surprise as he noted the way her shoulders tensed, the way she began to hold herself too stiffly (as if every effort was focused on keeping still and not curling inward) as she explained, “The little girl you were holding with the red hair, she looks like me. Not just the hair. I knew she was mine the moment I saw her. But it’s not going to happen. Not in this reality.”
“My observations are imprecise with only these images to go off of, but biology is my expertise.” Helen responded with a flicker of a smile. “If I had to guess I would pin them in late adolescence. A male and a female. They’ve been expertly trained but the way they respond to impact suggests their bodies are more used to recreational sport than active combat.”
Jaime, he thought, the faceless children taking shape in his mind, becoming the ones he’d seen in his dreams. Jaime with Steve’s blue eyes and stubborn mouth. Nyota, spunky and quick witted, quick to find mischief, bold and brave like her namesake and full of sarcasm and a thirst for adventure.  She was so much like T’Challa Tony realized sadly, that ache of longing only deepening within his chest.
"You realize that if your calculations are off by even a small margin, you increase the margin for error? The machine itself could cause irreparable damage to your internal organs that neither I nor Helen will be able to save you from." Luke warned softly, not in the same dire fashion Cap was so good at but nevertheless it reminded him too much of Steve and their ongoing argument over Tony's plans to embed his bone structure with BX and flood his system with nanobots. Which really only sounded insane when you said it like that.
“Mr. Stark. Can you stand?” the unfamiliar kat asked in a gentler tone, his dark eyes staring deeply into Tony’s. They were calm and still with an almost discomforting depth to them, that made Tony think of falling into wells or going through portals into vast space.
So what were they doing here really? When all was said and done.
“Trust is essential to a bond Tony. You have so few you can rely on, and so few places to feel safe and I lied my way into your sanctum and into your affection. My reasons for doing so matter little where your heart is concerned but I hope that in explaining my motives, it will help you toward finding your way to trusting me again.”
a teasing thought trickled through his mind. It reminded him of Natasha and he chuckled under his breath shooting her a glance. Her gaze met his knowingly and her lips tilted in a smirk.
That made even less sense. The only two Tony trusted to see him through heat were Bruce and Clint and Tony had noticeably not shared a heat with Clint in a while. Tony ended his confusion a moment later when he squeezed Steve’s hands and looked up at him through the dark fan of his eyelashes.
And I have high hopes for his MCU characterization but I've borrowed a lot from comics here for T'Challa. Did you know that he is ranked number 7 on the list of top minds in Marvel comics? Just two minds below Bruce at number 5 and five below Tony at number 2. I mention this cause I like to brag on my faves, and also it reiterates why Steve's whole 'real doctor' comment is just ... (-_-)  Anyway, I do so hope we get to see the genius side of T'challa in the films but you'll definitely see it at work here.
"Mama they speak Italian!" Tony exclaims with wonder. Only not everyone is. They pass a pair of old men who are yabbering at one another in what might as well be chicken clucks to Tony's ears. It's strange. He knows they aren't speaking German but it's like they're trying. Every now and then a word will sort of make sense, only it's as if they're all babies again garbling the sounds and mashing them together.
The bells in Natasha's hair jingled quietly as she turned to look at him, a single brow lifting just slightly in a micro expression of incredulity that he was becoming used to seeing the more missions they took for SHIELD together.
“Stop!" Tony heard himself snapping, pain shooting up his arms as he slammed his  palms against the table. "Stop pretending like you don't hate this more than I do. Stop acting like you want to be tied to me when you don't!
“You’re right.”
"How did it go?" he asked Clint.
Right now he felt so far from sure, it was like he and surety had never even heard of each other.
Tony clenched the stem of his glass and raised it to his mouth to keep from snapping.
And look, it’s not like Tony has provided any of his friends with anything like regular eating habits to make a study of. Which means Rogers has paid
“Out of your hands Director?” Steve’s scowl called bullshit. Finished with the paper he tossed it aside, letting it land on the table with a loud slap.
Weird. He stamped down on that bit of ridiculousness because this was his home, his ridiculously expensive yogurt, his achy body and his life imploding around him, so he'd damn well eat six tubs of the stuff if he pleased, and he didn't care what some nobody medic thought about it. It wasn't like he had a girlish figure to watch.
"We should head out. I want to make it down to the yard early and see what progress they've made on the torpedo. I won't outfit the new submarine with anything else, not with how well she's sold. I suppose this means Obadiah is right and we'll have to widen our market."
Tony looked to Natasha and she stared back, resigned.
Fels were very territorial preheat, queens especially. The last week had seen Tony stalking about the tower seemingly just to touch everything (and everyone) in his space, driven by the biological urge to leave his scent on all that was his.
With the three of them strapped up to BARF Tony could do his thing without having to worry so much about taking in details of their changing surroundings. When it came to Barnes, the emotions from Steve and Natasha ran too deep to take chances on missing details that could help them find him all the sooner.
“You’re just saying that. We both know it isn’t true.”
“So!” Tommy whined. “Nobody’s a better shot than Kate and I’m so fast, hell I could take out those gunships all by myself. We don’t even need Uncle Steve.”
Hadn't he already seen that? Some part of Steve asked himself. There had been a moment during the battle of New York when Steve had paused on the battlefield, cowl lost, slowly raising his bruised and battered body to survey the senseless destruction and loss of countless lives happening around him when he'd realized they weren't going to win this one. They didn't have a hope against creatures like the Chitauri, and even if he and his shield were right where they were supposed to be - between the innocent and the forces that would consume them – it was not his hope to die on a battlefield with the knowledge that the people he'd tried to protect were doomed.
“The good news is that the degeneration can be successfully stemmed by an outside brain.” Tony swung the focus back around, tapping the side of his head with a falsely bright grin. “We don’t know at this time whether that is something all Gata can do or if it is a trick specific to the Queen brain, and seeing as we’d have to kill someone to collect any more data on it, we’ll just have to wait on that one.”
Sarah Rogers always had time for him, and her door had always been open. So even though Tony kissed Richardsville goodbye fifteen years ago and has a strict no contact policy when it comes to unwelcome blasts from the past, Rhodey brought him the message anyway. All it takes is one phone call and a 'you tell that boy to come on home now' and Tony’s telling Pepper to cancel all his meetings and trying to explain to his fiancé why he needs to gallivant off to Georgia on a dime.
“Yeah, and none of these shots were kill shots.” Clint added to the growing pile of observations. “Steve’s right, the kid’s a sharp shooter but he had multiple chances to kill and he took none of them. That’s gotta be intentional.”
He's fifteen and they've just escaped out the back gate, shirking Tony's lessons and Rhodey's morning chores to go swimming down at the little cove they discovered the summer Tony was eleven, the one that nobody else knows about (probably). And they're going to catch hell when they get back, but it's hot enough to melt the skin off their bones and Tony doesn't care.
“Steve… Steve, stop.”
“I’ve participated in worse bonding exercises.”
She'd just leapt to another rafter to get a better angle when Killian raised his hand and slapped the body on the table, not harshly but solidly, and the body jerked to life with a gasp.
Nyota blinked back the unexpected prick of tears as Jaime's voice filled her head. He was currently stomping around on the outside of the hull, trying to patch up the hole while Matai and T'Cael were helping mend the broken wires and circuitry, closely monitored by Riri.
He knows that she smelled like the forests they’d camped in, warm wood and sweet chamomile laced with the bite of winters cold. He knows her eyes were green and her hair red as a sailor’s sunset; and he knows that she was his last and final warning.
Asgardian's ate like wild hogs and drank their booze like dwarves Tony discovered as the party in the Great Hall went forward full speed ahead. Though Frigga did her best to be a gracious host and keep drawing their Midgardian guests at the high table back into conversation, Tony kept finding himself distracted with the Kǫtrdýr Queen and Steve as it turned out was absolutely rubbish at small talk, especially the high handed sort that was traded at a royal table.
"Phil is my partner. I don't have a master." Clint responded tersely.
He was referring to the way fels smelled stronger closer to heat. They weren’t effected by the pheromones the same way tom’s were, not completely, but even a baseline human’s nose picked up on some of the changes- particularly the enticingly sweet edge.
Luke laughed lowly, shaking his head at him.
"You understood me perfectly Tony, do not pretend otherwise. It is demeaning to both our intelligence and more importantly to the bond you have formed with the Colonel. He doesn't deserve that."
They breathe, together, and the Hulk recedes.
He didn’t see it of course but all three arrows buried themselves in a line down the guy’s chest.
“Speaking of our foreign friends, Prince T’Challa has a proposition for us,” Tony segued with a serious note and they all straightened up silently in wait.
“You know, omnipotent lizard,” Tony was prattling beside her. “Speaks in riddles and tells you just enough to make you fear your imminent doom, but never actually says or does anything that could help you prevent it? Wise dragon.”
The scent of him was dizzying but Tony struggled to stay focused, because it was important that he warn Steve before they started. Steve had to know what might happen. Tony moved his head, kissing the side of Steve’s jaw before leaning back, placing a stilling hand on Steve’s chest to put a temporary halt on things.
he was.
“Awful, at the end.” he interjected softly. “But it was beautiful before that. You’re beautiful and I’m honored that you’d let me know you like this.”
These were people who had never been tamed. Who had been passing down knowledge and fighting techniques for hundreds of years and took pride in their strengths. They weren’t burdened trying to be human. They were happy and comfortable in their difference and stronger for it.
Oh right. Sort of an important detail.
“Harley’s always been so smart, but the only thing that works faster than that head of his is his mouth I’m afraid.” Jena remarked, tucking a strand of her dark hair behind one ear nervously. Tony held back a flinch. He’d heard that sort of thing said often, about himself, and never with fondness.
The first day's movements had no clear pattern or significance, except that when looked at from an aerial view the route reads: Hello Tony.
New plan. Flying underneath the bridge Tony quickly eyed the metal support beams that held the entire structure up. He’d designed this course so he knew the general layout  of all the platforms and function of all the mechanisms that helped to slide them in place. He wasn’t looking to completely wreck the gym or cause the floor to collapse into the one below, but the safest way possible to destabilize it.
Steve swallowed back the lump and steeled himself. First hurdle down. One more to go.
Tony had asked back in Fury’s office why Steve had joined the initiative, and the truth was more selfish than Steve was comfortable with sometimes.
The team was gathered near the elevator, all in their suits except for Steve, who was in army dress (because he got the luxury of dressing however he chose and not as someone's fantasy fetish) and Natasha who had gone with a slinky but elegant evening dress.
Steve nodded, shoulders bracing as he said, “Alright. Lead the way, Tony.”
Not because he honestly felt like Clint was being taken advantage of, or that him wanting to mate with Phil was some sort of rejection of Tony (he knew it wasn't okay, and he can be an adult about this) but because deep in his heart he knew that things weren't quite right.
For now! Yes, okay coming in second was a new and not exactly treasured feeling, but he was no stranger to challenge and honestly, he’d been getting rusty over here anyway with nobody to even come close to giving him competition. They had this in the bag, because his people would have something Wakanda didn’t. They’d have him, and Tony would put his mind and his guts up against anyone.
Concentrating harder, thinking that perhaps his fatigued brain had simply dropped the message (and trying not to think about the ominous silence that had descended around him) Tony tried again.
Maybe it thinks I’m Ironman he’d thought, and it had made him feel bolder. He’d realized that the robots couldn’t see how scared he was behind his mask, or smell him. They didn’t know he was just some weak kit, and not just as brave or strong as Ironman.
“What was that about not being ticklish Stark?” Clint asked, a purr rumbling happily in his throat and Tony rolled his eyes.
That was the moment one of the Avengers jets chose to come speeding overhead and by the time Tony had pulled his eyes away from the incoming jet to glance back at him, the man in the Cat suit was gone like some sort of freaky Houdini.
For a time they sat in silence while the van sped down the highway and the medics saw to their burns and contusions, both of them staring at nothing and keenly aware of their missing teammates.
"He’s up to something." Steve murmured under his breath. Natasha didn't turn toward him but he could tell she heard by the amused slant her mouth took.
A thick voice in heavily accented English fills his head and Tony flinches, hands raising defensively, but there is no visible threat. They’re in a lab now, a dark dingy space without windows full of pale blue light. The soldier knows this place, but he can tell by the way that Tony’s eyes flick about quickly, taking in the strange machinery and the operation bed that the soldier is now strapped to in a millisecond sweep, that he does not.
“We’re ready for takeoff,” Phil ordered Natasha, the last to squeeze aboard and Clint gave him credit for giving the cue to take off before he turns to Banner and says,
“Keep walking Stark.” She finally murmured so lowly that he doubted someone without kat ears would have heard her before her words were whisked away by the wind.
Tony snickered around his spoonful of stew. Luke’s shit eating streak was kind of amusing, he’d give the guy that. And weird tribal customs or not, if he wanted to bring Tony offerings that tasted this good he could court him till it went out of style. Which it had, probably not long after the invasion of Rome.
“Really.” Tony chuckles. “Now why don’t you kiss-”
~*~*~*~
"Mama?" He hedges, his voice high and thin with uncertainty and the two women part, laughing and wiping at their teary eyes.
Ivan knew why.
he thought and Bruce groaned.
Natasha's glower had evened out to something far less readable, that Tony hoped meant less danger. He was somewhat wrong, because a moment later her hand darted out and there was an unholy pinch in his ear that had him jerking up with a yowl, baring his teeth at her.
Clint couldn’t stop thinking about whether or not he had a family somewhere still wondering what had happened to him, if the comic books he'd probably worn thin were going to gather dust in a box somewhere or get thrown away, and if he still believed in heroes now that he was there in a cage.
“Should we go after them?” Peter chirped, and Steve frowned at him but it was Tony he addressed.
“So what’s the big problem then?” she asked, “What have we changed that you think we weren’t supposed to?”
The smile that might have blossomed on Phil's face had disappeared now.
They'll take less pay because they're desperate and they don't have citizenship to protect them. Tony knows Hughard is against employing them on principle (those same principles that will kill him and Tony's mother one day). He says that it pushes tax paying citizens out of work; but Tony knows that equally important to his father is the fact that they are not German and that they are less for that.
Maria is pale and still on the coroner’s slab, beauty diminished by the marks of a violent death and they feel bile surging up in their throat when they see how her swanlike neck has been mangled.
"Surely as your bond grows your inferior nose will pick up the changes. " Her long pink tongue came out to wipe the area around her mouth and then as if they'd never dropped the subject at all she stared right through him and suddenly her voice, fierce and dark, filled his head,
“Definitely Tony Stark approved.”
While he was determined that Resilience would always provide shelter to Gata no matter how infirm, they needed others who were strong enough to carry those who weren’t strong enough to carry themselves. Which meant buying a shit ton of Gata away from their owners and trying to keep the others from realizing too quickly that slowly but surely they were losing their best and brightest.
Steve gasped as Tony pushed the memories into his mind, flashing pictures filled with warmth and color. The two of them on a sandy beach. The sky an impossibly bright blue above them. Steve’s holding a baby girl with red hair and furry white ears in his arms, and she’s clapping and giggling as Tony chases three older kits through the waves lapping at their feet, kicking up sand and water as they go. The oldest boy shrieks joyfully as Tony grabs him, his coltish legs swinging as they twirl around. And then, piercing blue eyes turn toward Steve, peeking out from dark wet bangs as the boy calls,
"Tony,” Steve tried to interject gently. Though he reached for Tony’s arm he was clearly torn between which of them to comfort, and Tony pinned him with a quelling stare.
How happy they’d all helped to make each other, he’d realized as his eyes had strayed to Natasha head resting on Tony’s stomach as she appeared to doze, and Pepper with shoes kicked off using Happy’s thigh as a pillow while the bigger man drooled on Coulson’s shoulder. Coulson didn’t seem to mind, happily stroking Clint’s ears, the tom resting in his lap as he bickered sleepily with Tony.
He was. It was a relief, he could admit. He’d been heavy for so long, but he was feeling lighter and lighter by the moment.
~*~*~
Nyota re-lowered her faceplate and powered up her welding torch. It felt right in her hand.
Was it surreal being at the center of the defining civil rights case of the 20th century? You bet, but Tony would take it all, all the public ridicule and invasion of his privacy, a hundred times over if it meant he could still change things for others.
They never tell Betty but they think she guesses.
As Tony and Bruce struggle to find a solution for extremis he makes some bold plans for the future. The Avengers Pride started with Fury's ideas but Tony's going to make it his own. He never does anything small.
"And only 45 minutes late. Give the guy a medal." Pepper chuckled. "I think you'll like this one. She scored extremely high on the aptitude test and is a student at your Alma Mater."
Beside him on the bed Dr. Banner also stirred, blinking hazily.
He makes a face at the mention of the dour schoolmaster who teaches all the young children of court.
Tony ignored the whispers and stares, reducing some of the brain capacity he was using to sweet talk his way inside The Dagger and reallocating it to the confrontation at hand as T’Challa stopped before him. He was curious he’d admit, to see how the tom thought this whole thing was going to play out. Tony kept silent, simply arching a brow at the tom to signal that it was his move.
He’d opened his mouth to tell the kid once and for all to stay put when he felt the enemy approach. That mechanical hum in the back of his mind that he’d been persistently ignoring had grown steadily louder. Suddenly his brain seemed to catch onto some of the bits and pieces of the digital conversation passing around him until he could access the data as easily as if he we holding his StarkPad.
Steve Rogers, former captain of the football team, local army hero, not to mention Sarah’s only blood child. So Tony was well aware there’s a good chance he was about to see Steve again after fifteen years of purposefully
Tony grinned.
“I want to help him. Whether or not he can tell us anything more about the mercenaries he fought, if he’s in some kind of trouble I want to help.” Tony explained. “I know Norman Osborn. He’s ruthless. He wouldn’t pay for a kit to go to school unless there was something he expected to get out of it.  It doesn’t sit right, leaving a kit at his mercy. Super-powered or not.”
Steve pressed, and Tony would have been irritated if he didn’t know himself. It wasn’t exactly a secret that he liked avoiding emotional shit.
The bridge groaning terribly above his head, Tony eyed his handy worked and judged it ready to give in thirty seconds, tops, and waved jauntily goodbye to T’Challa as he darted out from under the bridge and flew up and over it, only pausing long enough to snag one very pissed off super soldier along the way as he launched himself off the side of the bridge just before the floor gave way.
Hughard inspects him critically and Tony worries because he can feel the tension in his hands, the way they tremble with suppressed rage. He’s sure he’s going to be hit again. Especially when Hughard growls.
"They published a picture of us you know. Pile of nubile young kittens curled up on a blanket with margaritas in hand. Sold out in minutes. Howard was furious." Tony giggled, the taste of sour liqueur and salt lingering in his mouth. He blinked as the warmth of the sun faded, replaced by the low lights of the hallway. Wait why was he in a hallway? Where were Serena and the others?
Tony wanted to help... but he knew there was a possibility that any one of them could prove to be beyond saving. There were some wounds that didn’t heal, some scars that went too deep, and there was no getting a person back after they crossed a certain line within themselves no matter how unfair.
“That’s easy. Find the pictures of those fels he likes to keep in the penthouse his wife doesn’t know about and when his stock crashes, buy it up.”
Tony felt pressure around his hand and looked down, startled by the sensation of Steve squeezing his hand. Poor guy looked green in the gills. Somehow that made something relax inside Tony, after all of the two of them he was the one who knew how to navigate this kind of circus.
“I know only that with the mind much is possible and the Queen’s mind is strongest. But even a Queen has limitations. They must draw their strength through the Pride. The strength of the the Old Ones is nothing compared to the strength of the people.” Nakia turned to look back into the operation room, pity laced through her tone as she finished.
"Tony."
“I’m sure you’ll think of something Mrs. Keppel, but you’ll have to excuse me. Pepper’s yanking my leash again.” Tony stepped back with a wink, grateful to put distance between them.
"I heard you were in the area again and decided to drop in."
He frowned but he couldn’t say that he was at all surprised by that admission. She leaned down to stroke one cheek with her hand and kiss his forehead.
-Jarvis & Ana-
He didn't have the cosmetic differences that set Tony so far apart from everyone else and made it impossible for him to blend in (no furry ears, no tail, or retractable claws) so when you think about it he got the best of both worlds.
(Doesn’t matter how strong you are, when there’s no one to come home to.)
Tony was starting to understand why this girl called to him so strongly. It was same calling to same. They carried the same burdens and it also seemed that it had somehow, or another fallen on both their shoulders to be the fixers. When he looked in her eyes this time around, he saw the iron in her core and it was Tony’s nature to want to shape.
“His pulse is elevating.” T’Challa’s voice was almost lost over the rapid sound of beeping from the heart monitor.
“I don’t know,” he admitted begrudgingly. “Yet. I’ve got JARVIS looking. If there was a security breach we’ll find it.”
Tony’s eyes bugged out and he could feel his hair fluffing in alarm. He was joking right? But he was just standing there looking ridiculously serious about having his hands bit off, Jesus Christ.
There were unshed tears in his eyes, but it was the naked grief in them that helped Tony finally understand why Catman had called it Bond Bleeding. Steve couldn’t have bled more if someone had shot him and held the wound open.
“I said that the suit is potentially a weapon of mass destruction that logically should be prevented from falling into the wrong hands.”
Standing at attention once more, Peter nodded. He did understand.
“What if he were to attack you or the innocents you have moved to that property?”
“Hey Moltres! Nobody likes a sore loser,” Tony jeered, firing at the thing more certain of distracting it then he actually was of damaging it because up close he could see that it’s feathers had a strange scaly sheen which in their line of work usually didn’t mean soft and easily destructible.
“Oh wow…” Banner gasped, brown eyes sweeping across the room to connect with Natasha who suddenly resembled a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
The serious line of T’Challa’s mouth twitched, though it was hard to tell if it was toward amusement or irritation.
The tom’s expression flickered somewhere towards fondness as Tony’s face lit up in an eager grin, fist pumping in victory before he moved to slide back under the machine. But Luke’s hand, suddenly appearing on his shoulder halted him and Tony looked to him questioningly.
"Don't get nasty Romanov, we're all on the same side."
And okay, he and Steve weren't on the best footing, but the whole package was like his kryptonite (a sexy guy who knew what he was about and an even sexier deadly weapon comprised of one of earths most rare elements) so he would have enjoyed watching Rogers kick ass down there if not for the way he just literally ordered one of their teammates to carry him off like a disobedient child (or worse, some helpless damsel) when Tony can see very well that Steve won't make it to Clint in time and he's pretty sure he's the only one who has figured out how to beat these assholes.
Tony didn’t stop Steve’s mouth from coming down over his because he knew what this was and was okay with it.
“Ms. Cook has been looking all over for these guys. Sorry if they bothered you. They were warned these rooms were off limits.”
they made it to bed at night.
“You’re responsible for this, Boy? I told your mother you creatures were nothing but trouble.”
Happy put the car in reverse just as JARVIS called out a warning.
Because they definitely needed to talk about it as a team. That was for damn sure.
From the get go, Tony should have realized that it was bound to happen.  Something good didn't happen in his life without kick back. He hadn’t been lying when he’d told the others that he didn’t trust Tiberius Stone. But the attack on the safe house had put them in the unfortunate position of having to rely on the man’s words if not his intentions, because they had absolutely nothing else to go on and all evidence did in fact point to AIM.
“It really isn’t.” Tony jerked out of the tom’s grasp, heart still clamoring in his chest, skin crawling at the thought of being touched by strangers so close to his heat. Especially a strange bossy tom. He wasn’t used to being bossed around by other kats. Not to sound like an arrogant dick but he was kind of a big deal and most kats were either too star struck or too tamed to be anything but timid when interacting with him.
The second time he was woken by an increasingly loud and conversation so close to his head it could only have been inside it.
When Tony wandered onto the communal floor it was with the thought of grabbing a glass of his favorite cream from the kitchen to take down with him, but he stopped short when he realized he wasn't the only one up.
"Great, then two things. One:stop calling me Anthony, and you can drop the House Stark bit because it makes me feel like you're about to make me Hand of The Queen or something and if that's your intent, no dice. I like my head attached to my neck."
It takes Tony’s brain a moment to catch up to the words, and then even longer to process them. To be fair, it’s extremely hard to think when your super-hot boyfriend has his hand on your dick and is trying to wring an orgasm out of you like his life depends on it – and it’s that, the desperate,
Tony let the black rope of his tail swish languidly behind him, every line in his body perfectly relaxed and tried not to be too smug about the way Ty's golden eyes tracked the movement.
He can tell that she is serious again, thinking on his punishment as she says, “But you must learn caution if you are to lead our people, and your father is wise. It matters little who wears the crown. You are part of this family and thus the responsibility of leadership will come to you. One way or another.”
But for now...
He didn’t blame Tony for his fascination with them. The guards along with Extremis would make sure that he was never defenseless, but having worked with Tony and Helen on the Cradle Steve thought that T’Challa really should have known better than to hand Tony something that would tempt him to keep pushing his limits before Extremis was stable.
Tony blinked slowly and barked a laugh, ignoring Killian entirely, he twisted his neck to stare at Stone.
"Stop that. No touching. My hair was a beautifully styled work of art before you got your mits on it" he grumbled but nobody was taking him seriously. Not even him really. His damn tail was sill tangled in Clint's for god's sake.
But asking a fella to get serious with you was much different than asking a dame and Steve had never been good at the later, so he was at ground zero when it came to the former.
“Why wouldn’t he be calm?” Pietro appeared on his right, a costume headband with a fuzzy pair of cat ears attached. The price tag was still attached. “It’s a simple snatch and grab. We could do this in our sleep.”
There were many things about Midgardians that Thor appreciated. They were small creatures, with lives that lasted the span of a rain drop, but for all that, he’d never met a species who could cram so much passion (and so much misery) in a single lifetime.
Perhaps it was just a consciousness. The little duckling who kept his eyes open while his brothers slept chanting to the witches at his door.
With the machinery nearly completed for the complicated surgery Tony and his crack team of scientist had determined they were as ready to perform the procedure as they'd ever be. If Tony had his way they would have done it already with no one the wiser, because the last thing he wanted was to spend days building up to it making everyone anxious and facing their worried pitying looks.  It was bad enough that legally he couldn't keep Pepper in the dark about it and he had to see the fear in her eyes every morning. He didn't want to magnify that by a half dozen.
It was Ivan who had picked up all her pieces when they carved a heart enflamed with passion from her chest and reminded her not to drink poison, even if the bottle said 'Drink Me' with a face hard to resist and eyes that reflect her own misery.
“He feels how he feels Clint. You could ask him to get over it but it’s not that easy.”
~*~*~
He couldn’t claim ignorance if he tried, what with all of T’Challa’s dire warnings about bond loss and encroaching on another Queen’s territory. Tony had always known sharing Steve with Bucky Barnes was the only way to love Steve that wasn’t going to end in bloodshed. And if he had somehow missed the memo even after all of that, their first attempt at bonding had made it clear that it wasn’t going to be like with Natasha, that the universe wasn’t going to let Tony simply just take Steve Rogers for his own without contending with Bucky – and maybe Tony had known it even before then. Deep down, hadn’t he always suspected that there was a part of Steve that didn’t want to be taken?
“It’s going to be harder than you think Nyota. One wrong move and we could completely fuck everything up.” Jaime had lowered his voice and leaned closer across the table, maybe in hope that the others would be too distracted by the news program to hear.
From what he and Bruce could figure, Tony's brain was sending out new commands, for new processes that his body was struggling to comply with, the way a company might flag under a management change. Simply put Tony's new Extremis wired brain expected too much too quickly and there was no way for the rest of him to keep up.
Tony had been in his head, had touched something inside him, and it had been the first time that insistent voice inside Steve that sad he wanted Bucky, needed Bucky couldn't (shouldn't) live without him, had been forced to recede.
Instead of taking out his mark he’d gone AWOL. They’d been prepared to die together between SHIELD and the KGB hunting them down, but Phil had convinced Fury they were worth more alive than dead; and Clint really got it then, that Coulson meant what he said about standing behind him, making sure he had what he needed to succeeded and evaluating his performance with fairness. He hadn't just been talking shit when he called Clint a person and said that people needed to take care of themselves and be taken care of to be an effective part of a team.
He didn't like when his teammates kept making moves without being upfront with the team, or the thought of the shelter kats being used in a fight they didn’t fully understand.
“You’re right.” His voice was so thin it was near a whisper but when he turned back to the vision of Barnes, jaw clenched tight, and spoke next it was stronger.
But whatever Ross would have liked to have done or said, they didn’t get to find out because before he could even get in spitting distance, one of the she-toms with T’Challa prowled smoothly between them.
To think something as simple as forming a connection with someone (with him) could produce something like that in someone else.
“You mean they taught you what it could be used for, but not
Steve didn’t know much about the inner workings of Gata biology but he’s unique in the fact that he’s had the privilege of knowing two feral Queen Fels in his lifetime. There weren’t words for it. Being close to a Queen was enthralling, addicting even. But Tony specifically…. Tony was like holding a Sparkler in hand under a black velvet sky. He was Iron and fire burning in your palm, warm and so beautiful you could almost forget it was dangerous, only you don’t want to. The danger was part of the enchantment.
"If you think we aren't having words later Hughard Stark you can just-" Tony never finds out what she would have done because a second later he's mashing his face against her soft cheeck and giggling as Papa attacks from the other side.
“What’s your damn point Killian?” Tony seethed flinching as Killian’s finger tapped the rim of the reactor.
"From you Romanov that's almost a compliment." Tony replied as he joined them, his eyes flickering to Clint who was standing beside Agent, the unmissable new addition to his throat going, well, unmissed.
“Don’t be stupid Banner, you know his magics not strong enough for that.”
“Actually, that’s my plan for Thor but we’re going to have company and I’m going to need you to cover Bruce, okay?” When Steve didn’t immediately acknowledge, Tony sighed. “Steve if you’re mad about the call we can talk about it, later, right now I gotta know you have my back.”
The kit is thirteen years old, and he has just flowered. It’s what they call it when kittens start heating every three months. His very first heat had been miserable. Painful and frightening as his body had called for the mate he didn’t have without mercy.
“I won’t argue your classification of renegade, Captain, but you can be sure that they are not from my country.”
Though Bruce was still wary of SHIELD, getting a chance to study the pride effect on feral kats had been one of the major boons to agreeing to join the Avengers.
Finished with his shopping, the kit makes his way back toward the counter and ignores the strange kat watching him intently from atop to counter to ask Mr. Allen to pull a couple of jugs of milk out of the icebox.
“Okay, officially canning this discussion. Let’s just win this thing. Cap I’m going to put you down on the castle bridge.” Tony snapped and Steve, still hanging from Tony’s arms as they sped toward the castle mount grunted.
Tony had kindly explained to Secretary Walsh from the Defense Department that the contract drawn up for the Pride initiative included an independence clause that stipulated that upon successful completion of a Pride bond, the Gata so bonded received conditional independence (provided they maintained a SHIELD designated Handler and continued to fulfil a public service).
The pull of them in his mind was stronger than it ever had been as if their pain had somehow hit a panic button and there are signals flashing in his brain going: URGENT.
“Miss Nichols. This is Sonia Dyson.” Tony introduced the two women with a slight wave of his hand. “Sonia wanted to know who was behind her husband’s unfortunate tumble in the stock market.”
That really didn't sit well with Steve.
He just doesn’t think it will matter when T’Harun is king. That’s all. But he knows better than to say so.
Tony doesn’t handle relationships well. He’s mentioned, that right? There’s no confusion on the fact that he sucks at handling anything past ‘hi, hello and how do you do’, and sometimes he even forgets that part.
Clint didn’t think Tony was going to answer but his ears still strained after a reply, tension coiling tightly in his body as the seconds ticked by.
“I’m sure he would.” Clint assured him with a surprising touch of gentleness, but then again the archer had very good eyes. “I’m shit with relationships but even I know Bruce is right. It’ll be the thought that counts.”
It was dark and shadowy in the hallways, the only light available from the emergency reds that had turned on with the alarm.  Which was still blaring loud enough to almost drown out the sound of gun fire and shouting coming from the floor below. Tony flew toward the commotion, anxious with every scream that floated up through the floor that they'd be too late to prevent someone from dying.
Which were essential for growth and healing in living tissue. Made sense.
He doesn’t remember going at her with teeth and claws and nothing held back. He’ll see it later when it’s splashed all over the news because she dives out a window trying to escape him and the news chopper shines a light on them and catches it all.
"They've opened up talks with Wakanda." Natasha said in monotone and Robert blinked, startled no doubt that a kitten he didn't know and hadn't addressed first would be brave enough to speak to him. Natasha just nodded slightly as if he'd denied her claim and went on.
