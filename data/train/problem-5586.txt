“Yes, yes, I think we will do that. Could you- could you get us in touch with Greenwood hospital?” When the nurse nods, Steve adds. “Tell them it’s Steve Rogers and we’d like to see Doctor Stephen Strange.”
“Can you lift your head for me, bud?” Thomas asks, coming over with a cap to put on Peter’s head. The boy nods and lifts his head up so Thomas can put the cap on. He reaches up to touch it curiously. He wonders why he needs to have something on his head when they are inside and it is not rainy or snowing.
Tony sighs, then meets Steve’s eyes. His first instinct is to argue, but he knows his husband is right.
“Hey, hey, it’s all right.” Steve says in an instant, coming over to Wanda. Peter drops his crayon and looks at his sister with wide eyes. Before he can get upset too, Tony comes in and scoops the boy up into his arms, bringing him to the kitchen. “What’s going on, princess?” Steve asks gently, moving the chair Wanda is sat on so that they can face each other and crouches down in front of her.
“You won’t have nightmares, baby. You’ll nap with me, remember? I’ll keep you safe.” Tony assures, bouncing Wanda in his arm again. When the girl mentions Stephen again, Tony cannot help but laugh softly. “Kitten, we can’t stay awake forever. We need sleep to let the body rest and recharge, otherwise we’ll get grumpy and sad. Do you wanna be grumpy and sad?” Tony asks.
A few days later, Tony finds himself going back and forth between lying down with Peter to comfort him and getting him whatever else he needs. He is so proud of the boy for being so good, but he knows how hard it is. Right now, Tony is getting him a bottle to try calming him down.
“All clean.” Wanda yawns. She leans against Tony and puts her thumb in her mouth, sucking contentedly. “Sleep in Daddy’s bed now?”
“Good, I was worried about that.” Steve says. Wanda tends to act out when she thinks someone she cares about is hurt. “Do you wanna go see your brother, sweetheart? He's hurt, so we have to be very gentle and quiet, okay?”
“But, I help!” Peter tries to argue to Steve, giving Stephen a pleading look.
“You’re a mother hen, babe.” Steve chuckles, patting Tony’s ass teasingly while passing him in the kitchen. “He’s got the sling and he’s careful anyway, isn’t he? Pete’s not one to play rough normally, right?” He argues.
“I do think you spending some time with him would be good.” Tony agrees. “Thank you, Steve. They’re upstairs, by the way. Playing with dolls, last I heard. I think it’s a wedding or a prom or something.”
“Honey, it’s okay that you need one.” Steve says soothingly. “You’re still my big boy. You just need a little help, and that’s okay. You can still be big and a princess, okay? C’mere.” He pulls Peter onto his lap. “I know you don’t always like it, but it’s what’s best for you.”
Peter looks at Tony with a pout, then gives Thomas a stare and decides that he does not want to speak to the nurse and cuddles Pooh instead. The nurse is hardly offended and laughs lightly.
“Okay. I’ll put it on. And...” Steve leans over and kisses Tony briefly to wake him up. “You wanna help me get some dinner for these two? I think someone needs a hug from Daddy too.” He nods at Peter, then sets up Paw Patrol on the TV. He grabs a blanket from off the couch and sets it on the floor in case Peter wants to watch from there. Tony stirs awake at the kiss and blinks a little blearily, but before he can wake properly, he has got Peter at his side demanding kisses.
Tony relaxes visibly at the kiss and sighs a little when they pull back.
“We have diapers here. I’ll have a nurse bring some.” Stephen says. “There’s a single room available, so he won’t have to be around others. I think you need some quiet time with your Daddies, don’t you?” He pats Peter’s head. “I’ll come check up on you in a little while. His room number is B240. And holler if you need anything. And I do mean anything.”
“Wanda's having her nap right now. You can see her when she's done, but she can't run around and play with you until you're better, okay? Let's stick to some quiet games. You two could try to do a puzzle together.” He suggests. “Or you could colour.”
“I know, I know you wanna play. But, you’ve gotta be careful, okay, beautiful? I just don’t want you to get hurt again.” He pats Peter’s arm. “If you play with dolls, you have to keep being a good patient okay?”
Steve tries not to laugh,
“Okay.” Wanda sighs. “Do I have to go see the doctor again? Is Stephen gonna come?” She likes Stephen well enough, but not the procedures she has to go through whenever they end up meeting. She tries to be fast and washes her hands on her own, albeit dripping water everywhere. “If he does, I wanna lie on your lap again, Daddy. It made me feel better.”
“Go night night now?” It is not dark out, so he figures it must be like his nap-time. “And good dreams?” He hopes that when he wakes up he can see his Daddies and sister again. Maybe he will feel all better.
“There we go.” Thomas announces as he gets the clothing off of Peter completely without hurting his arm. “Put this one on him once you’ve changed him then.” The nurse says and gestures to the gown that he put at the bottom of the bed.
“You promise! Play, now!”
“Was that a good story, baby?”
“We’ll have a pyjama day on the sofa and watch movies all day, right?” Tony says, bouncing Wanda in his arms. The girl perks up at that. Watching movies with Daddy all day does sound fun.
Thank you sm for reading!
“Oh, that’s all right, princess. Accidents happen sometimes, even when we don’t mean to. That’s why we call them accidents.” Steve says and helps Wanda up from the chair. The girl rubs her eyes with her fists.
“Maybe together they could.” Steve laughs, then shakes his head. “You’re right though, that might be too much. We’re gonna have to save date night for the future.” He throws a few things into the pot he is cooking in and finally turns the heat down low. “I’m gonna go give them a bath now. Peter, Wanda.” He raises his voice as he goes over to interrupt their watching. “Do you want your baths separate or together? And no arguments.”
“Yeah, they're sleepy, baby.” Steve gives him a kiss on the forehead. “Just like you get sometimes. And Wanda's sick so we have to let her rest. How about I finish putting these away and then you and Papa can read a story together?”
“Oh, Christ, baby girl, of course we do! I love you to the moon and back!” Tony exclaims a little at how absurd Wanda is being. Sure, the girl has her more anxious moments, but she has never questioned their love towards her like this. For a moment, Tony wonders if Wanda’s fever has spiked and is making her delirious, but her forehead does not feel excessively warm against his cheek as he brings her to the bathroom. “You must never think that we don’t love you, Wanda baby, because we love you so much and that’s the truth.” He emphasises and opens the bathroom door. Wanda breaths out a sigh of relief. Daddy sounds serious and like he dies when he comforts her and Peter at night. And he is cuddling her, right? He loves her. He must.
Big chungus chapter sksk
Wanda stiffens and bites her lip. Her first thought is to run away and hide, but she cannot think of a good spot where they would not find her, so instead she bursts into tears.
“Yeah, it’s a bit hard sometimes.” Steve says and guides Wanda to the bathroom. Once there, he begins to undress the girl and puts her leggings, undies and blanket in the bathtub to be rinsed off. “Can you go potty for me, princess?” He asks, pointing to the toilet.
“Daddy, I feel all sick and it hurts. Want it to go away.” Wanda knows that she is whining a little bit and she feels bad, but she does not know how else to express herself. She feels worse than she ever has before. “Hurts all over, Daddy. I got cursed. By a witch.” Of course, with no idea what is actually happening to her, Wanda's next logical thought is that she was cursed, like Maleficent cursed Aurora in Sleeping Beauty. “If I kiss a prince, I think it'll go away.”
“Wanna nap with Daddy and Peter. Daddy, I feel funny. But I’m not laughing.” Steve actually cannot help but laugh at that.
“Yeah, yeah, we know.” Thomas chuckles a little. “But, that’s why we put casts on and it will protect his arm while it heals. I think the doctor will want him to use a sling as well, so then he won’t use the arm as much either.” He explains.
“Oh, thank God.” Tony sighs heavily and sets Wanda down so that she can run over to Steve to greet him. “Wanda’s been super good for Vis and she made a brilliant card for her hurt brother.” Tony adds, smiling at how Wanda squeals when Steve picks her up.
“No diapey, ’m a big boy.” Peter frowns a little when his Papa gets him in a diaper anyway. Peter usually wears padding most of the time, but he sometimes does not like it and argues with his Daddies by whining. At least he has got his Sleeping Beauty pyjamas. “Wan’a got no diapey.” Peter points out, rubbing his bare feet together.
“Daddy, I don't want the thermator.” Wanda mumbles into Steve’s arm. The girl can say a lot of big words, but thermometer is just a little too big, especially with the state she is in. Unable to resist getting to snuggle with her Papa though, Wanda finally moves so she is laying on top of his chest and nuzzles his shoulder. “Daddy, did I get cursed because I was bad and didn't listen? I'm sorry. Can you make it go away?”
“I did.” Wanda perks up. “I was really good and I took them and I only cried a lil’ bit. But, I don’t like them. I don’t like the thermater too.” She shudders a little. “S’ embarrassing. I don’t want it again. Promise no more?”
“Hope he likes it.”
“I can be your knight and your prince, angel.” Steve assures the baby. “So I can keep you safe and help you run the magic kingdom. How does that sound?”
“No! I have to! I gotta go!”
“Honestly, yes. He’s still on the drugs right now. Recovery is always the worst. One of us is gonna have to stay home with him. At least Wanda can go to daycare, but he’s gonna need a lot of help. Poor thing.” Steve shakes his head. “Let’s just hope he’s not in too much pain.”
“I can’t!” Wanda stomps her foot in frustration. Why cannot grownups ever understand?
“I know, but this’ll make you feel better. Come on.” Steve picks her up. “Maybe it’s time for a bath.”
“Hold on, hon.” Stephen agrees with Steve. “You'll have plenty of time to cuddle with your brother soon, but you need to let him rest and you need to be very gentle with him. No playing and running around while he's getting better, okay?” The doctor then turns to his patient with a smile. “Okay, little man. How are you feeling? Can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down?”
“I’m afraid not, honey. Now hold still. Remember, we have to do this if you wanna be able to play with Petey soon. Speaking of, I should probably get him some breakfast.”                                                     Wanda is still squirming and kicking her legs.
“Don’t feel good. Sleep now.”
“Honey, come lay down with Papa bear, hm?” Steve tries to tempt. He can tell that Wanda is a little shaky, even when sitting up, and he would much prefer for the girl to lay down and rest. The only thing worse than a sick Little, is a tired and sick Little. “And Petey’s still asleep. Let’s not disturb him.” Steve adds and pulls Wanda close, trying not to wince out loud at just how warm the girl feels. He would also prefer if Peter remained in his bed till they at least figure out what Wanda has and get some medicine in her. But, Tony and Steve are rarely that lucky.
“I’m afraid we have to check your temperature at least once a day to know if you’re getting better, love. I know it’s no fun, but we have to do it.” Stephen says. As much as he loves Littles and wants to praise and love them all the time, he will not budge on the medical aspects. They just have to be done, even if it upsets a Little. “But, you were so brave for your Daddies. I know cause they told me. You’re being a really good patient, you know. The best I’ve ever had.” The doctor adds, taking a positive turn on the whole conversation in the hopes of Wanda seeing just how brave she is being.
Nodding a little sadly, Tony leans over the bed to cup Peter’s cheeks and kisses his forehead once and then twice.
“Doctor Strange? MRI three is ready.” A nurse informs and Stephen thanks her before turning to Peter.
“Hmm, we should call him tomorrow.” Tony hums in agreement. “But, for now, can I get some alone time with Papa bear?” He purrs, carefully untangling Wanda from his side and rising to come over to Steve’s side of the bed. Steve smirks and kisses Tony, running his hands through his hair. They are close now, hands entwined together.
Wanda gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.
“Papa is staying right here and not going anywhere. We’re going to play and read some stories and cuddle. I’m staying right here with you, sweetheart. I just want you to rest a little bit like Stephen said. Okay?”
“I'm tired, Daddy. Up, please?” Her request is not really just a result of being sleepy, but of wanting to cuddle with him nonstop.
“Where’s your sling, bud?” Steve asks, but Peter just shrugs in response. “Peter, where's your sling?” Steve repeats again, keeping his tone firm, but gentle and kind. “I know that it's not fun to keep it on all the time, bud, but you have to if you want your arm to get better. Can you show Daddy where it is?” He wonders if maybe his little boy was in some kind of discomfort with it on, and if maybe the painkillers will help a little. Either way, he is worried that he just took it off.
She is a big enough girl to do it herself, but Steve and Tony still check whether she did a good enough job cleaning before letting her go. Peter, on the other hand, thinks the toothbrush is meant for chewing and sucking on rather than brushing. Wanda brushes her  teeth as well as she can, then shows her Daddy with a big smile.
“And what day is it today?”
“What’s going on here?” The doctor asks the caregivers calmly.
“Princess!” Princesses make everything better, even when she is crying and hates herself. “I want princess, Papa. Ariel. She’s a mermaid. In the water. Splashing.” She waves her hand to demonstrate. Suddenly she gets an idea. “Papa? Can we swim?” She loves going to the pool with Peter.
“Made a picture so Peter feels betters.” Wanda shows him. She used his favourite colours blue and purple and added lots of sparkles. “And played princess. And saw Frozen. I’m Elsa. Peter’s princess too.”
“You’ve been so good for me, baby!” Tony exclaims a little, a bit baffled over why Wanda thinks she is being bad when she has not been scolded once, not even put in the corner once since getting sick. It has all just been corrections and warnings with a firmer tone of voice. “And of course we’ll love you no matter what, silly girl.” He adds, bouncing his knees as he embraces the girl and kisses her forehead again.
“What you mean, love?” Steve asks, filling the bathtub with some lukewarm water to rinse the clothes and blanket. He glances over at the girl sat on the toilet, swinging her feet back and forth.
“Well, I'm not nearly as tired as I was before. Being around you is just a little bit of a wake up call, you know?”
Peter nods eagerly at the idea of just being lazy all day and watching movies with his sister. The only thing missing to make it the most perfect day ever would be a huge bowl of ice cream, so naturally he demands it.
“No! I’m ready! I’m ready to go play, Daddy. Look.” She trips over her own feet as she rushes to go grab her dress and puts it on halfway and backwards. Tony grumbles something under his breath when Wanda dashes off and goes to follow her. “I’m ready! Let’s go.” Peter goes after his sister, curious to see what is going on and wanting to join in. He is just about to pick out a princess dress like Wanda, but then strong hands grab him under his arms and lift him up.
“Yeah, that’s very true, princess. You’re being so good and talking to me.” Tony praises, bouncing Wanda in one arm. “We left off where the princess had just met the friendly bear in the forest, right?” Tony says, setting Wanda down on the king sized bed finally and climbs in as well.
Steve and Tony try to get the Littles in the bath.
“Yup, this one’s going to sleep in our bed tonight.” Tony says and bounces Wanda in his arms. “Lets get you ready, love.” He says and heads to the bathroom, setting Wanda down to let her brush her teeth.
Steve gives Tony a look that clearly says with all the sarcasm in the world, 'this is going to be fun.' Peter turns his head back and forth while his family debates. He can sense that this is serious stuff and sucks his pacifier more vigorously to sooth the anxiety that is building up in his chest.
“Steve!” Peter turns his head towards the stairs, curious as to what is happening upstairs. He can also hear Wanda coughing, but that she has been doing ever since they all went to the doctor for her. Peter could hardly stay at home alone, so he joined the trip to the doctor’s office, but that did not mean he got any attention from the Daddies.
“You can always call Stephen if you need some advice you know? And I can stay home tomorrow and look after him so you get a break.” Steve suggests when he sees that Tony is stressed and overthinking stuff. He brings his husband into a hug and rubs his back.
“Papa stay.” Peter says again and lifts his hand up to hold onto his Papa’s sweater. “We play?” He asks, putting on the best puppy eyes he has got to finally play with his Papa after playing by himself the day before. Just when Peter thinks Steve is about to nod, Tony calls out from the stairs.
“So fun.” Tony grimaces back at his husband, but quickly turns his attention back to Wanda and places a firm hand on the back of her soft thigh. “Baby, shh, you’re okay, it’s just a thermometer. You’re being so brave for us, such a good Daddies’ girl.” He tries to comfort, but it does not seem to help much as the girl keeps wriggling under him. Wanda arches her back in an attempt to sit up straight. She glances over her shoulder and looks at Tony with a tiny, heartbroken look.
“Pete, show us where your sling is.” Tony chimes in, pointing to the doorway where Peter came from. Peter frowns at his Daddy’s tone and huffs a little before stomping off to point at the living room floor where the sling is.
Steve winks at Tony.
Wanda frowns a little at that, not entirely convinced by her Papa’s argument.
“I under-understand. I hurt, Daddy. I gotta go potty and I feel sick and I don’t want you to get tired of me and I don’t want a spanking ‘cause I hate the doctor.” It all comes out in a rush. “Do you still love me? I love you, I promise!”
“Yeah, I think that sounds like a good idea.” Thomas says, smiling at how Steve’s eyes seem to light up at the mention of his little girl. “Have you told him about the surgery?” The nurse asks, gesturing to Peter with his eyes.
“Baby, no.” Tony says firmly and pulls Wanda aside before she can turn the stove on. “This is a job for Daddy and Papa only, okay? The stove is very hot and you have to be careful, so we’ll handle that.” He explains, but then he sees the frown on the girl’s face. “What’s up, sweetie pie? Tell Daddy what you’re thinking.”
Meanwhile at the reception, Steve waits for the nurse to turn around to face him.
“There will be some pain since it’s surgery, but it can easily be managed with pain relief. He might have to stay overnight tomorrow as well if the doctor thinks that is necessary.” The nurse explains a little quietly. Peter is quite distracted with how Tony is feeding him, but Thomas still keeps his voice down. “As for daycare, you’ll have to see when he feels up for it, but we do recommend that he should be on mostly bedrest for a week following the surgery.”
“Sleepy now. Wanna cuddle. Come on, Daddy.” She is ready to get back to how things are supposed to be with her feeling happy and content and safe.
“Ow! Feels bad. Right here.” He points to where it hurts the most. He hopes that the magic will make it feel better soon. “Kiss better, Stephen?”
Peter closes his eyes, suddenly feeling himself start to grow sleepier and sleepier by the moment. He mumbles out something incomprehensible before his body goes slack and he drifts off completely.
Tony sighs and decides that it is definitely best if he does not put up an argument about it. He instead focuses on comforting Peter.
“Honey, you’re doing great. You’re okay. Just keep still, it’s almost over and then you can have whatever you want.” Steve glances at Tony and then says quietly. “This is gonna be a fun day.”
“Hey, honey...” Tony mumbles and wraps his arms around his baby girl on reflex. He sighs a little and starts to doze again, but then he realises how hot Wanda feels in his arms. Tony nudges his husband awake. “Baby, you have a fever. You feeling icky?” Tony asks, sitting up on the bed to get a proper look at Wanda. When Steve does not immediately wake up, Tony nudges him again.
“You can rest.” Steve reassures her. “We’ll keep an eye on him. Right, Tony?”
“Lets get you some dinner as well.” Steve says, guiding Wanda over to the table as well and to her seats where she is sat across from her brother. That way, Steve and Tony can tend to a Little each and help them during mealtimes. Wanda gets on the chair, but sits on her knees and leans across the table closer to her brother.
“You were so brave, baby bear.”
“Hi, I’m Thomas. You guys must be Peter’s Daddies? Doctor Strange sent me to get you guys all set up here.” He says, extending his hand to shake Tony and Steve’s. He then turns to Peter. “Hi, little one. The doctor tells me that you’ve been super duper brave today.”
After a bit of consideration, Peter nods at his Daddies.
“Stay?” He does not want to be without them, even if there is going to be magic involved. Uncertain of they can come with Peter, both of the Daddies turn to the doctor for an answer. Stephen smiles and pats Peter’s shoulder.
Peter nods at the promise of popsicles. He has been getting a couple a day while he has been recovering from the surgery since he has lost some of his appetite since it. Besides, they are treats so Peter will see how far he can push it and get them daily. At the mention of colouring, Peter suddenly remembers something.
Peter continues to fight for a bit longer and even hits Tony’s chest lightly, but then he settles a little and continues to whimper. He is so exhausted and frustrated that Stephen even adds another drug that will sooth his anxiety. While Tony calms Peter, Steve goes to fix the juice bottle as promised.
Steve shakes his head.
“Yeah, okay.” Tony says, gently swaying Peter in his arms as they head to yet another part of the hospital. But, Stephen leads the way confidently. At this point, Peter is just accepting that things are happening to him, but whines now and then to still let the grown ups know that he is unhappy.
“I think he’ll adore it.” Vis says easily. It is a stunning card after all. It has been a pleasure babysitting Wanda for over a day now, but Vis noticed that he could not do it much longer because Wanda was truly getting impatient with her questions about her family, and her brother in particular. Vis knows that Peter is in surgery as they speak, but he has not told that to Wanda. He will let Steve and Tony do that.
“Night, night, baby. Sweet dreams.” He wishes, craning his neck to place a kiss of her temple and rubs her back to lull her to sleep. To be honest, Tony is feeling sleepy himself and right before he dozes off, he considers asking Steve if he can stay home with Wanda the next day.
The girl nods, still crying, but not as hysterically as before. She thinks of Peter who is hurt and needs her to look after him and how she is such a mess. The worst big sister ever.
“Oh, good.” Wanda seems satisfied with that. “Now you have a prince. And Papa is handsome too.”
“You’ll see soon, buddy.” Stephen chuckles and wheels the bed down the hall till they reach a double door that reads ’staff only’. He then stops and turns to the Daddies. “This is it.”
“Hey, sweetheart, talk to Daddy. What do you mean you don’t feel good?” He asks gently, rubbing at the girl’s back soothingly. Peter perks up a little from where he is sat on his blanket again and looks as the Daddies try to persuade his sister into a bath.
“Okay, one episode of Care Bears while you have your juice, all right?” Tony bargains and brings Wanda back to the sofa where the medication is waiting. “I love you more, to the moon and back. Now, take these, kitten, and then we’ll watch.” He bargains again and picks up one of the three pills. Wanda eyes the pills for a moment, then grabs one of them and puts it in her mouth, doing the same with the other two in the next instant.
“Tony?”
“Was brave...” Peter parrots.
“Hi, Daddy.”
“Then let’s roll.” Stephen says to Thomas and together they open the locks on the bed and start gently wheeling Peter out of the room and to the elevator at the end of the hall.
“You should brush your teeth too, princess.” He says, knowing that the aftertaste of throwing up is the worst there is. Together all three of them head to the bathroom to run Wanda a bath, completely forgetting about Peter downstairs, who is supposed to have a snack and lay down very soon.
“Pups now. Let’s go. Thank you for being a good boy.” Steve carries him back and sets him down in front of the TV so he can watch another episode. “Okay, Wanda. Your turn.”
“Paw woofies.”
Before leaving the little family to it, Thomas informs them that Stephen will be back soon with a treatment plan once he has consulted the ortho on call. While he gets changed, Peter relaxes a little at the familiar routine and at finally having a quiet moment with his Daddies. The gown is pretty cute with puppies on it, but it smells too clean and scratches his skin a bit.
“That's right.” Steve says. “You two will get plenty of chances to play together at daycare once we're in the clear, but for now we want to make sure that you both stay healthy and don't get anyone else sick. Peter, say bye-bye to your sister.” He waves as an example. “You are both gonna have a really nice day, all right? Promise.”
“Hat?"
“Thanks.” Steve smiles, feeling a bit of the heavy weight slipping from his shoulders. Things seem to be finally moving and someone is being helpful, so he returns to Peter and Tony with a smile. “We’re getting outta here.” Steve says to Tony with a groan and chuckle.
“Daddy!”
Peter reaches up for him, sniffling a little bit.
Tony snorts quietly in response and leans down to kiss Steve again. When he pulls back, he has a glint in his eyes.
With a nod, Stephen gives Tony the okay to pick Peter up and cuddle him. Tony immediately takes him into his arms and sways side to side with him, hoping the movement will soothe him.
Peter looks back at Stephen. He knows he is supposed to be a big boy and he cannot stop himself from crying. But, he will go.
“She’s wound up and overtired and a bit delirious.” Stephen tells Tony. “She needs a nap.” Tony nods in agreement and chooses to ignore Wanda’s burning questions for now. Taking the medication and getting some rest is far more important.
“Read now.” Peter requests, and tries to lay back more comfortably to listen.
“Papa where? Papa colour too.” Peter looks at Tony demandingly, wanting an answer and for Steve to show up very soon.
“Wanda, you can turn yourself over or we can do it for you, okay?” Wanda contemplates her options and finally rolls over on her side, but curls up and hides her face.
“Dolls sounds good. Does yours have a name?” Steve smiles and picks one up. “I think this one needs a friend to play with.” He has to admit that Stephen was right. And honestly, Steve himself finds playing with Peter cathartic too. After the stress of the past few days, it feels good to just be there with him and only worry about dolls and stickers and lollipops. “Look, this doll has a doctor coat, just like Stephen.”
“You were such a good boy, sweetheart. So good, Daddy's so proud of you.” Peter hears his Daddy say through the speakers and he calms down a little, but a few tears still escape from his eyes. When he gets wheeled out of the machine and Tony comes into view, Peter finally starts crying properly since seeing his Daddies in the other ER.
“Pre OP meds are kicking in it seems.” Stephen comments to Thomas quietly. The nurse chuckles and nods before pausing by the elevator and pushes the button. Just a few seconds later it arrives and they all get in and ride up to the fourth floor, which is the surgical floor.
“He’s running a bit of a fever too. Nothing to panic about, but keep an eye on it.” The doctor reports to Steve before pulling Peter’s pants back up. “Come on sweetheart, you can sit up, here.” He reaches into his bag and pulls out a lollipop and a sparkly star sticker. “You were such a good boy, and you get a nice little surprise.”
Wanda sniffles and tries to compose herself. She is supposed to be a princess, a little lady. She sits up straight and through her tears she whispers.
Wanda looks around the hospital, eyes wide. After walking in, she gets down on her hands and knees to look under a table in the waiting room, wondering if Peter will be there. Before she can do any real damage however, Tony walks into the lobby and goes to tap her on the shoulder. Wanda turns and throws her arms around him.
Wanda feels anxious. What will happen to Peter without her there to take care of him? She is his big sister. She is supposed to make sure he does not get hurt and she cannot do that if he had to go by himself and she had to stay home. Panicking, she wails.
“Back home with Mama. Just like you’re back home with Papa,” Steve tells him. “You did such a good job reading with me, sweetheart. Thank you for all your help. Now can you tell Daddy how you’re feeling?” He just wants to check in and make sure he is still doing okay. “Do you feel icky like your sister or no?”
“Me get pop.” Peter grins a little, knowing Stephen is generous with the sugar-free lollipops that he gives after exams and procedures.
“What happened, sweetheart?” Tony steadies his voice. “Does it hurt? Did you fall?”
Tony chuckles at how dramatic Wanda is being and takes some comfort in the fact that the girl cannot be seriously ill if she is making jokes about being cursed.
“No.” Wanda protests, knowing at least they are talking about her. “Am not fussy, Papa. Wanna watch with Peter.”
“Please, Daddy? Sleepy. Want water. N’cuddles. And..and...” She is stammering now.
Wanda yelps and squirms, trying to get away from the thermometer. It is so uncomfortable that she almost thinks of it as a punishment. To try and bargain she suggests with a small voice.
“He sure has.” Steve says proudly. “He’s been a very brave little boy, but I think he needs to rest now. I’m definitely glad to see you. Thank you for dropping by, we’d like to settle him in as fast as possible if we’re spending the night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Meanwhile, Tony has been recapping Wanda’s condition to the doctor from the last few days. The three of them are in Wanda’s room and Tony has got the girl on his lap while Stephen listens to the girl’s breathing with his stethoscope.
By the time Wanda joins them, Peter has got another pretty signature by his Daddy on his arm. Even though he is hurting a bit, he feels all right with all the praise he has got.
“You don’t feel good?” Tony asks, putting his hand on Wanda’s forehead and finds it warmer than it was in the morning. He frowns softly and pets the girl’s cheek. “You feel a bit warm, yeah. Sit tight and I’ll be right back.” Tony says and then quickly gets up to fetch the thermometer as well as Wanda’s antibiotics and some ibuprofen.
“Wanna play?”
“Baby girl, you gotta stay home for a while longer, or you’re gonna get sicker.” Tony says, crouching down by the two Littles and puts a hand on Wanda’s hip just to be sure she does not run away. Wanda’s face falls and she tries to squirm away.
“Okay, okay,” Steve chuckles. “Papa’s gonna read the story. Let’s see.” He points to the words as he reads them and holds the book up so Peter can see all the pictures. He speaks softly, slowly, shushing Tony back to sleep when he sees him start to stir.
Tony and Steve try to break the news about the surgery to Peter.
Peter giggles quietly at Steve’s voice as he demonstrates. He copies his Papa and also puts a finger on his lips before glancing over at his sister and Daddy.
“Thermo-meters, baby.” Tony corrects with a chuckle. “And that sounds like a beautiful life. If Peter and you are princesses, what does that make me and Papa? The fools who entertain the two of you while you sit on your thrones?” He suggests, making Wanda giggle and shake her head.
“If you lay across Daddy's lap, maybe it'll help.” Steve offers, knowing that cuddles and touch always make her feel better. “And I'll hold your hand and be with you the whole time. You can have ice cream with your brother after. Come on sweetheart, can you be a good girl for me?” Wanda shakes her head at first, but after a little bit of back and forth, seems too tired to fight back anymore and agrees.
“I’m sure the doctors will give you some tips on how to help Peter once he is discharged. And if you ever need help, then I’m just a phone call away.” He offers with a smile, patting Tony’s shoulder to comfort him.
Wanda cuddles closer to Steve. She hates having her temperature taken, and she wonders if she can lie to get out of it and pretend she is better. Maybe if she says she is better it will actually become real, like a wish coming true. This time she really does force herself to sit up, rubbing her eyes with her fists and calling out to Tony.
“Me too. I was so scared when they told us he hit his head, I...” Steve trails off. “Sorry. I just hate seeing him in pain. But, he’s so little and sometimes I know there’s nothing I can do to stop the hurt.”
“Daddy, am I ever gonna get better? I don't think princesses get sick this long, 'cause they have to run their kingdoms and I can't do that when I'm icky. You have to.” And, Wanda thinks, she should no be giving princess responsibilities to anyone who does not want them.
“Moomin and My!” Peter slurs with the carrot, kicking his legs again. Tony laughs at the little groan that Steve lets out at having to read the same book twice in one day. After getting Wanda dressed in some fresh pyjamas, Tony brings the girl to the dining table where Steve and Peter have already started on dinner. The little boy has already got food all over his face.
“I love you, Papa. Promise you won't tell Vis?” That would be one thing she cannot ever see herself getting past. “Or Peter.” He needs her to be big and take care of him, at least that is what she thinks.
“What about the arm? We didn’t even get to radiology to get x-rays. They just gave him some painkillers and left us.” Tony points out to Stephen.
“Now, how about some pancakes for breakfast?”
“Not… Not really.” Steve admits. “I just told him he’d have to stay a little longer. I just didn’t want to upset him. I don’t know how to tell him. I guess it’s like ripping off a band aid.”
“Duckies.” Peter requests, looking up at Papa hopefully.
While Wanda is gone, Steve gets the blanket and clothes in the washer along with some matching laundry. He starts a cycle just in time for Wanda to return.
“Don't go. I love you. Don't go. Goodnight, Daddy. I mean good afternoon. It's not night night yet. But it will be, 'cause it's dark when I close my eyes.” Tony chuckles softly at Wanda’s fever induced babbling and just pats her back.
“I'll try to keep her occupied, so he doesn't have to see much of her playing.” Steve suggests. “We should try to plan some activities that he can do from home or in bed. I'll go out and buy some new colouring books for him and maybe some new stories to read. I'll ask him what he wants.”
“There’s a brave girl.” Tony coos when Wanda turns onto her side and shushes her gently when he pulls her pyjama bottoms and underwear down to expose her bum. “Now, this is gonna be a bit cold, baby, but it’s okay.” Tony warns and very carefully inserts the thin thermometer into Wanda bottom. Peter turns his head away and scrambles down from the bed. As much as he loves his sister, there is no way he wants to see her in this way.
“Good to see you, Tony.” Vis replies with a smile, but it is a little tight with worry.
“Are you gonna love me even if I’m bad? I wanna be good now but sometimes it’s hard. I feel all upset inside.” Really, she is just wound up from being on bed rest for so long. “But I’m trying really hard. M’sorry I didn’t listen. With the bath. And the thermater.”
“You’re a silly princess, huh? You can play with blocks in just a minute, but I’m sure you’d like to be wearing something first.” He gets him into a new diaper first, then gets his pyjamas on, finally sitting him up. “There you go, sweetie. All ready. Wanna go play now?”
“Duckies it is. We’ll take care of your sister later.” Steve says, deciding to take this one argument at a time. He tells Tony to keep an eye on Wanda, then takes Peter into the bathroom so he can start running water. He undresses him slowly, trying to get him to relax a little bit, then helps him in. “Okay baby, I’m gonna wash your hair now. Close your eyes.”
“It's like a special magic that doctors do.” Steve tells him. “They work really hard and then they make you feel better. They don't have a wand, but they do know how to make owies go away. And they know how to make it so you're not so scared when they help you.”
“Peter…?”
“You’re very welcome. Would you mind getting your boy undressed? We want all the little patients here in gowns. I’ll take care of the t-shirt.” Thomas says, fixing an ID band on Peter’s good hand and then takes out a pair of scissors from his pocket.
“No! You can be the knights and fight the scary dragons. ‘Cause you’re brave.” To her, they are the bravest in the world. When she and Peter are sick and sad and scared, they are always there to make it better. “Can you be my knight, Daddy? There’s scary stuff everywhere. And I can fight too.” She stands up on her seat and waves her arm. “Like that. That’s what I do when someone hurts me. And Peter. Someone...” she suddenly worries again about her brother. “Oh no. Peter. Gotta help him, Daddy.”
Peter nods as he tries to listen closely, but Wanda speaks fast and he has a hard time catching everything. But, he still nods at Steve with a wide grin.
Stephen is not Peter’s Daddy, but being a bit removed from the situation helps him to see what is going on a bit more clearly. The doctor has dealt with tons of sick Littles and everything that comes with them—including attention starved Little siblings.
“Hmm, was so sleepy...” Peter mumbles, his voice slightly slurry due to all the drugs. The oxygen mask also muffles his voice a bit. The boy blinks lazily, but when he spots his sister in Steve’s arms, he grins a little and seems to perk up. “Hiiii...” He says, waving a bit with his good hand. Stephen smiles softly and starts checking Peter’s vitals while the family catch up a little.
“Okay.” Peter nods and suddenly remembers that Pooh is still in his room. He really misses his best friend. At the mention of his name, Thomas pops his head up from where he was sat at the nurses’ station in the recovery room and heads over.
“Peter, do you wanna finish up dinner and rest a little bit? Maybe we can call Wanda and see how she’s doing?” Steve asks, sitting on Peter’s other side while Tony continues to feed him.
Peter accepts the lollipop with a little, tired smile and hands it to his Daddy to unwrap.
The paramedics’ names are Gabby and Stella and Peter shyly introduces himself as well and then points to his arm.
“Well, honey, you’ve got a nasty case of pneumonia. The good news is that your Daddies are taking good care of you and I think you’ll be better soon.” Stephen promises the little girl, patting her shoulder. Wanda looks up at Tony and holds her arms out.
“Yep, and I think she needs a nap. You wanna put her down? I’ll call Stephen.” Steve stands and kisses Wanda on the forehead. “It’s probably your brothers nap-time too.” He knows that Peter has been fussy too, and he silently wonders if he is going to put up a fight about nap time. Not that he could blame his poor baby with how stressful the last few days have been. Wanda stays limp across Tony’s lap.
Peter listens closely to the story, following it with his eyes and runs his fingertips over the pages and the holes in them carefully. Whenever Steve gets to the last sentence on each page, Peter says it with him softly. “Well, guess what happened after that...” He repeats, slurring the words a bit as he tries to keep up with his Papa. When the story comes to an end, Peter climbs onto Steve’s lap to face him.
“Yay! I love dinos.” Thomas grins, taking the mask with the dino pattern. Both the doctor and nurse put the masks on and then wash their hands before putting on gloves. A moment later, one of the double doors open and a scrubs nurse comes out.
“Wan’a took it.” Peter mumbles, but Steve still catches it. He looks over at the little girl who is fiddling with her wand. She is blushing furiously and looks very guilty.
“They put Peter as a low priority at Central hospital. Can you believe that? He’s got a headspace of 3 years, he should be top priority.” Tony rants to Stephen a little, taking out his worry and frustration on the doctor.
“I know.” Steve relaxes a little at the comfort from his husband. “I know we love him and do our best, and that’s all we can do. Sometimes it just feels like it’s not enough. I know that’s not true, I just worry about keeping him safe.”
“Oh man…” Tony stops what he is doing and sighs. “She must've been pretty upset. Maybe it's time to have her go see Stephen. I could set up her appointment on the same day that Peter has his follow up, since he needs to go soon. What do you think? Maybe he'd feel better knowing his sister is getting a checkup too.”
“Yeah, they’re sleepy. And soon you’re gonna be sleepy too, when it’s dark outside. Do you want to take a nap now, baby?” Steve brushes Peter’s hair away from his forehead. “I can put you two in bed.”
“Gi’aff.” He states simply.
“No arm get better.” Peter giggles, reaching up for the bottle his Papa is holding. He does not see what the fuss is about and just wants his juice.
“I promise I’ll play with you soon, baby. Papa just has to go help. Can you hang on for just a minute?” Steve feels awful with Peter looking up at him with those sweet, melt-your-heart eyes. “I won’t be long.” With that, he rushes upstairs to find Tony, mentally promising himself he will play with Peter soon. “What is it, babe?”
Wanda has been struggling with having her brother gone and the fact that she gets to be around Vis is the only thing that has been consoling her a little bit. She got to make a pretty card for her brother at least. On the car ride over to the hospital she stays quiet, holding it in her lap.
“One!” Peter says, holding up one finger, then puts up a second one with a proud glee on his face. “Two! Uh- Three and four!” Peter counts out, lifting a finger to show each number. “Papa got two legs.” The boy points out next, looking up at Steve to be sure he got it right. Steve beams with pride and gives Peter a kiss.
Before leaving, Stephen peaks into Peter’s room, pleased to find a little smile on the boy’s face while he is fast asleep in Steve’s arms. The caregiver seems to be deeply asleep as well. The doctor chuckles softly before making his way out quietly, leaving the family to finally rest in content.
Wanda closes her eyes and whispers.
Thank you sm for reading! Comments are very much appreciated c:
“Peter, Papa says that I’m not cursed but I’m icky and we can watch movies today. Wanna watch Frozen?” Wanda ignores Steve groaning. He has seen Frozen so many times because of the littles that he practically has it memorised. “And we can play princesses. I can be Elsa and you can be…” She thinks it over. “Belle. Or another one. Who do you wanna be?”
“I love you so so much, baby, and I’ll see you as soon as the magic is over, yeah? Be brave for Dada.”
Wanda and Peter want to go to daycare together, like always, but Wanda is still sick and needs to rest at home.
“For now, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get a little middle of the night wake up call.” Steve says, smiling. “We'll have to try to be quiet. I think someone else needs to get to bed too.”
Thank you sm for reading!
Peter is sat by his play mat in the living room, letting his Papa do all the stressing with packing his lunch and everything else he needs for his day at daycare while he plays with his animal figures. When his Papa calls for him, Peter gets up from the floor and pads over like a big boy. He shows the giraffe in his hand proudly.
“I gotta watch him.”
“Hmm, here.” Peter says, gesturing to Pooh’s arm. “We go fix? Go home?” He suggests, looking up at Tony hopefully. He does not quite know what they are waiting for anyway and he is getting quite bored and impatient with laying in the bed. It is not as soft and fluffy as at home and everything smells kinda weird. Almost as if it is too clean.
“Yeah, I’ll go check.” Steve says before heading off to the reception again.
If anyone is freaking out, then it is always the caregivers and not usually the Littles.
“She's about five, but sometimes she acts younger. She's just good at filling her big sister role. We left her with a babysitter for the night, but we'll see if he takes her for another. Maybe we can see if she can video chat with Peter later on too.” He thinks that would definitely cheer Peter up.
“Goodnight, Peter! I love you. I'm gonna sleep now. I hope you have happy dreams.” She yawns at Steve waves back at them and gives Peter a kiss.
“Why Da hurt Wan’a?” He slurs a little with the pacifier still in his mouth. He hates seeing his big sister like this and just wants to play with her already. Steve gets up and goes to pick up Peter, giving him a little kiss on the cheek.
“Let's just...take a deep breath for a second.”
“Can we handle them both being upset though? I mean, Pete knows the drill by now, but we might still be unlucky.” Steve points out. Peter has been to see Stephen for follow ups twice already since the doctor wants to keep a close eye on how his arm is healing. So far, there have been no complications.
Wanda listens carefully and nods. It makes sense, at least a little. Even if she cannot comprehend it all on her own, she knows her Daddy knows everything.
“Hmm! Sleepy beauty.” Peter specifies and holds onto his hooded towel with his little hands. When he gets set down, Peter is quickly distracted by his blocks on the floor and stays there instead of laying down on his bed to let Papa dress him like always. Steve turns around and laughs, shaking his head and picking the baby back up to put him on the bed.
Peter continues to cry for a while until his Daddy’s presence and comfort calms him down. But, he continues sniffling and whimpering for a while longer.
Peter is prepped and put to sleep for surgery
“’Kay...” The boy squirms a little in his diaper before settling down and thinks of something. “Pups, now.”
“But- Maria say no write on friends. Only paper.” Peter explains, frowning at the idea of someone writing on his skin. Maybe this weird place is getting to his Daddies’ heads. When Tony has got Peter on the bed comfortably, there is a knock on the door and a cute male nurse enters with some supplies in hand.
He looks up at Maria for just a moment. “Thank you for staying with him.”
“Stephen told us that he's going to have to have surgery.” Steve says, lowering his voice a little. “I guess I do have some more questions. Is he going to be in pain afterwards? When can he go to daycare again? How long do you think he'll have to be here? It's not that things aren't really nice, but he wants to go home.”
“Da and Wan’a sleepy.” He points out, cuddling up to Steve to hear the story.
“Hmm, is okay.” Peter nods. To be honest, he would not mind a nap as long as he gets to cuddle with Papa and lay on him while he sleeps. He always has the best naps when cuddling with someone. “We go cuddle?” He suggests, pointing to his bed where he left Pooh.
“Yes! Angelica.” Wanda decides, referring to the plush polar bear that she keeps on her bed. “'Cause when I get scared at night and I think bad things when I'm asleep she gives me hugs and makes it better.”
“Hurts, Dada...” Peter wails to Tony. Even with the IV the paramedics set up and all the painkillers, all the moving still causes him pain.
“Super yummy.” Peter reports, smiling a little shyly when Thomas gasps in response.
“Yeah, they know and they are here to help you.” Thomas says and goes around lowering the rails on the bed so that they can lift Peter onto the procedure table. “We all make magic happen here.” He adds in a whisper and a wink to Peter.
Peter relaxes visibly in the warm water, letting his Papa do all the worrying about cleaning him. But, he squirms a little when the loofah runs over a ticklish spot on his body, like his underarms, around his ribs and on his inner thighs. When bath time is over with Papa fetching a towel, Peter stands up carefully and lets his duckies stay in the water. Papa can fix that.
“You’ll see your Daddies soon, buddy.” Stephen comforts while they wheel Peter’s bed up to the padded procedure table. “Hi, everyone. This is Peter.” Stephen introduces for Peter the two other nurses in the room. They are masked and ready as well, but give the boy a friendly smile and wave still. Peter waves back and points to his arm.
“I don't want to. I'm all better, Daddy. I promise.”
Meanwhile, Peter has made his way half through his portion and is now having some of his milk. Tony helps him out by holding the bottle for him.
“Oh, baby.” Tony says worriedly. “Get it all up, brave girl." He says before briefly turning to Steve. “Get a glass of water and call the Doc.”
“Yes, this is just our secret.” Well, he will tell Tony about it once the Littles are out of earshot. “And then we’ll go find your brother. Which design do you want?” He asks, going over to the cupboard where they keep the paddings. Most of it is Peter’s and has light blue and purple galaxy designs. But, they also have a few princess themed ones when Peter wants to wear those and for the times Wanda needs some just-in-case padding too.
“Okay, Daddy. Go see him now.” Wanda nods. Steve motions for Tony to come as they follow Stephen to recovery. The doctor pushes one of the double doors open and lets the family in.
“I think you're the one who needs to worry about being good.”
“Super brave.” Steve adds, leaning over to kiss Peter’s forehead.
“You stay, Papa.” Peter says to be extra sure. Steve gives the boy a kiss and a hug.
“How’re you doing, honey?”
“Okay, sweetheart. I have dinner ready for you, so let's go eat.” Tony says, picking Peter up and placing him on his hip. “Remember to drink your juice too, it'll make the owies go away. How're you feeling right now?”
“You wanna be a princess, baby?” Steve smiles as he towels the boy off. “You can be a princess. Do you want your Elsa pyjamas? We’ve gotta get you dressed before you can watch your show again.” He keeps Peter wrapped in the towel and carries him to his room. “Lie down so Papa can get you changed and then we can go back out, princess.”
While the two Littles converse and giggle, Steve heads over to Tony to whisper in his ear.
“Where Papa?” Peter asks when his Daddy sets him down on the neatly made bed.
“’Sunami!” Peter parrots with a giggle, kicking his legs. He has got a carrot in one hand to munch on from his Papa gave him while he waits for dinner.
“Your Daddies can come with you on the ride upstairs, but then we gotta say bye bye to them for a little while, okay? You’ll see them super soon, I promise.”
“Thanks, Stephen.” Tony says, grateful. “Come on, baby boy. Let’s go.” He sends a quick text to Steve letting him know where to meet them and takes Peter upstairs to the room that he has been given. It is much more quiet and calm here and the Little friendly decor in the private room makes it almost cozy. “Let’s get you changed, huh, baby? That’ll make you feel better.”
“Can you take a bath when this episode is over?” That seems like a good compromise. “I’ll let you finish watching, but no arguments after. Understand?” He makes his voice a little firmer on that last bit. He turns and kisses Wanda's forehead. “And no arguments from you either, little miss. Be a good girl.”
“Want Daddy.”
Steve takes extra care not to get any lavender scented shampoo in Peter’s eyes and hums a quiet song as he works. Steam on the mirror above the sink has slowly started to appear, and the whole room has a soft, hazy feeling mixed in with the distinctness of the day being washed away. Steve does not scrub Peter hard when he washes his body, but goes over his skin with the loofah in light little strokes before washing away all traces of soap.
“Blue.”
“Of course, it was the least I could do. And Wanda’s been great. I’ve been keeping her busy. But, what did the doctors say? Steve said something about a concussion on the phone too.” Vis says worriedly.
“You’re so brave, bud! You’re the best patient by far.” Stephen praises once the boy falls still, which allows the doctor to attach the tubing to the IV. But, Peter is not really listening and is only interested in moping and being sad. At least the pain disappears fairly quickly now that he is getting a steady drip with morphine.
Half an hour passes and suddenly the doorbell rings. Peter perks up on the sofa and debates what to do. He knows that only Daddies are allowed to open the door, but they are too busy with his dumb sister anyway. And maybe the one behind the door is giving out free cookies, so Peter pads to the front door and after some struggling, he manages to unlock it and open it.
“All right. I’ll be on call all night, so just head down the hall to find me or another nurse at the station. Bye, Peter!” The nurse says before heading out. Peter waves at him.
“Hmm.” Peter nods and lifts his good arm to be picked up. “Pwetty hearts. Go now, Dada, giddy up.” He says, patting at his Daddy’s upper arm. Tony scoops him up easily and kisses his cheek.
“Frozen!” Peter parrots and kicks his feet back and forth happily. Seeing his bigger sister always makes him so happy. But, before he can think of which princess he wants to be when playing with Wanda, Tony pops a pacifier in his mouth and sets him down on the bed a bit away from Wanda.
“Yes, you’re being a really brave and big girl.” Tony praises as he pulls down Wanda’s pyjamas and underwear once more. “ And not just yet, but soon.” He chuckles when the girl gets a bit impatient. He then inserts the thermometer carefully and holds it in place while stroking the girl’s hair with his free hand. “You’re being so good for me.”
“Peter, shh, Papa’s on the phone now.” Steve says before speaking to Stephen again. “Half an hour? That’s perfect, thank you so much.” He says before ending the call.
“M’a big girl. Don’t need it.” Wanda has seen grownups take their temperature by mouth and she can do it too, she is sure she can. Well, probably. However, at the promise of ice cream, Wanda perks up a little. Steve bounces Peter up and down a bit before asking Tony.
“Oh, sweetheart!” Steve exclaims. “Of course not. Your arm just has an owie and it’s not gonna work the same for a while, okay? That’s why we’re here though, to make sure you get better. You can have your friends at daycare sign your cast.”
“I will. It’s just scary dreams sometimes. I think everyone has scary dreams, right? Papa told me so. It’s just not scary when you’re there.” She reaches out to touch the book, fingers brushing against the spine. “Chapter four.”
“Our little baby...” Tony says quietly and Steve nods in agreement. “He’ll be okay, he’ll be okay.” Steve comforts.
“All right Peter, let's go. Do you want Papa to carry you to the car or do you want to walk?”
“I know it feels better now, honey, but the doctors know what's best.” Tony explains. “I'm so sorry, baby boy. I know you wanna go home. I promise that Daddy and Papa are gonna be here with you the whole time and you'll be all better before you know it.”
“That’s going to help you, baby boy” Steve promises. “I promise you’re gonna be okay. You don’t have to do anything, just relax and listen to the grownups today, okay? And afterwards we can go get you something new to play with.”
“We’re gonna fix your arm, yeah, and then we’ll put a cast on it. It’s super hard and you can pick which colour you want it to be. What’s your favourite colour?” Peter hardly needs to consider his options before he answers.
“Yeah, that sounds good.” Steve says, leaning over to kiss Tony’s cheek. “How was the little man today by the way? Did you manage?” He asks with a chuckle.
“Thank you for coming, Stephen. You can just head upstairs. Tony’s just about done giving Wanda a bath.” Steve says with a smile before he gives Peter a stern look. “You know you’re absolutely not supposed to open the door by yourself, Peter. Do we need to sit down and have a little talk? That was very naughty.”
“Peter is the best brother, yes.” Tony agrees, setting Wanda down. “We can play after eating breakfast, but before that you should go potty. I don’t want any surprises, okay?” He adds with a chuckle and points to the toilet. Wanda can manage the toilet on her own, but still Tony and Steve stay close in case she needs help washing her hands or something.
“I'm all done. Look. Look.” She tugs on his hand and pulls him towards her. “I'm sparkling.”
Peter frowns a little and considers everything before speaking softly.
“I don’t want to.”
While her Daddy carries her to the bathroom, Wanda leans her head on his shoulder and sighs.
She splashed a little and hums to herself, suddenly lost in her own little world. It is pleasant and bright and full of bubbles. It is all hers.
“So, what’s next?” Tony asks, using his teeth to open the wrapping of the lollipop and then hands it to Peter. He apologises quietly when he accidentally bumps into the boy’s hurt arm.
Wanda finally bursts out with it all.
“Yeah, then we’ll wait.” Steve smiles, taking a fresh wipe for one last clean before helping Wanda step into the princess pull-up. “Hm, what is it, princess?” He asks, patting the girl’s padded bum.
“Maybe one of us should go home. Vis is nice enough, but Wanda might freak.” Tony points out.
“Of course. You just rest your eyes for a bit, sweetheart.” Tony smiles. “Dada and I are knights, remember? We’ll watch over you and your brother.”
“Hey, shhh, it’s all right, baby. Papa and I will always have you, promise. You, me, Papa and little Petey, we’re all family.” Tony shushes Wanda, mouthing another thank you to Stephen who heads to the door to show himself out. “We love you so much, baby girl. Now, you just sleep and I’ll be right here.” He assures quietly, brushing back the girl’s red hair and kisses her forehead to lull her to sleep.
“Good luck.” Tony whispers to his husband with a snicker before turning to the pot. In the living room, Peter has gotten real comfy  on the blanket where he is laying with Pooh. The boy sucks his thumb lazily while watching the animated dogs bounce across the screen. When Steve comes over, Peter glances over at him, but then turns his attention back to the TV quickly. Paw Patrol is much more fun than bath time anyway.
“I forgot. Keep forgetting!” She stamps her foot in frustration. “It’s hard.”
“Hmm. Bottle?”
“Papa says no hopscotch today. I’ll show tomorrow. Look.” Wanda points to the TV screen, which is playing a rerun of Sofia the First. “She’s a princess. Me too. Do you wanna be a princess, Petey? We can pretend.”
“M’gonna...” she suddenly throws herself onto the floor and throws up in a wastebasket, chest heaving. Before Tony can answer Steve besides a simple nod, his attention is drawn back to Wanda who suddenly looks really unwell. For a second, Tony wonders if they pushed the girl too far with the temperature taking. When Wanda scrambles up, Tony goes and follows her on instinct and pulls her hair back when she throws up.
“Love Dada too.” He whispers.
Peter giggles when Wanda offers her hand and kisses it sweetly before clapping his hands, thinking they achieved something great.
“Bad.” Peter parrots in his high chair, kicking his legs again and hitting the table from underneath. “Ah, ah! No kicking. Wanda, sit properly and eat your food.” Tony corrects both Littles, pointing to the portion that Steve has given Wanda on her plate.
“No icky.” He reports back to his Papa with a shake of his head.
Peter nods a little before singing the alphabet. He makes a few mistakes, but is quick to correct them. Stephen nods with a smile. The doctor asks the boy a few more questions about any pain and discomfort and then gets a quick look at the broken arm. At least the Central’s paramedics did a good job with the temporary air cast.
“I don' like being icky.” Wanda mumbles. She likes to take care of people when they are feeling sick, not the other way around. She feels sad suddenly and asks. “Can Peter and me still play together? I said I was gonna show him hopscotch, Papa. I promised. I can be not icky anymore. I'll try really hard.” She is getting a little more antsy now, squirming to try and make herself comfortable, her breath coming in short little pants and her voice sounding more and more like a whimper. “I'll try, Papa. I promise. I'll get better and I won't be icky anymore.”
Wanda has tears in her eyes and looks up at him pleadingly.
“Good thinking.” Tony nods in agreement. “I think he said he wanted apple juice if you want to put that in, too. He also needs a bath before bed, but I’ll take care of that. Peter, come here and get your bottle, honey. It’ll take just a second.”
“I know, I know, but we can’t fall asleep just yet, okay? Try and stay awake for me for a bit longer.” Stephen coaxes and continues to rub at Peter’s cheek to try and keep him more or less alert.
“Just can’t be away from you, Daddy. I have to be with you. And Peter. Can he sleep with us too? I want him to. It’s like a sleepover!” She perks up a little bit. “I saw a sleepover on TV once. It looked fun, but I think I’d cry, cause I only wanna be with Daddies.”
“He’s gonna check you just like Daddy checked your sister, okay?”
“Daddy, no more. Please?”
“I want a real one.”
Peter smiles shyly at that and slips down from his seat to pad over to his Daddy, flopping over his lap and hugs him as much as he can with his cast arm.
Wanda actually has to go potty right then, but does not say anything and just presses her legs together while Tony brushes her hair. She shifts from foot to foot, trying and failing to keep still and humming to herself. She loves it when he brushes her hair. He never tugs hard and always hugs her afterward and it makes her look beautiful.
Peter lets himself be manoeuvred and undressed. He has had a long day at daycare and he usually is pretty tired until after dinner where he gets some more energy to play before bedtime. Before then however, he remains quiet and lets his Papa do what he needs to. He tilts his head back and closes his eyes tight.
“Magic? Where's magic?” He mostly expected to see sparkles, unicorns and knights in shining armour. Maybe some wizards too.
“Come on baby boy, let’s get you ready to go.” Steve calls, rushing to pack everything he needs for the day at work as well as what Peter needs at daycare. Wanda still is not feeling too well, so it will just be Peter at daycare today. “Do you want Papa to help you put your shoes on?”
“Yeah, she went potty right after her bath, but she hasn’t had anything to drink since throwing up.” Tony explains and carefully lifts Wanda up before laying her down on the bed. He pushes the covers aside so that the doctor had access to her, but he does hand over Wanda’s Elsa doll to cuddle with. “You’re being so good for me, darling.” Tony coos to Wanda, brushing her hair back.
“Baby, can you look at Thomas for me so he can talk to you? He’s gonna tell you all about how you’re going to get better here.”
“Let’s take it one thing at a time.” Steve says. “We heard you had an accident, honey.”
