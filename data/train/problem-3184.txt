“It’s called a distraction, bitch…” Sam growled out as Dean twisted around and pushed away. Naomi’s blade sliced across his neck at the release and Dean clasped a hand to his throat and stumbled back, facing Naomi as he fell on his backside. He only had a moment to stare up at her before an Angel blade pierced through her back, the tip glinting with fresh, crimson blood as she screamed, her eyes and mouth alight with her fading grace. Dean screwed his eyes shut, unable to use his hands to shield himself from the dying light of her Grace. As she fell dead to the ground, Aberia was revealed behind her. She threw her blade down in disgust and looked down at Dean. Castiel ran toward him and hit the ground hard on his knees. Blood was pouring out between Dean’s fingers and panic was in his eyes now that he could afford to have them open.
Dean sighed and closed his eyes, feeling the comforting pressure of Cas’ hands on his shoulders. He just needed a moment to think. There had to be a logical response that he could give to talk Cas out of it. Before he could think of anything, however, he felt Cas’ hands move from his shoulders to slide up his neck and pull him forward, their mouths pressing together fiercely. Dean responded equally to Cas’ fevered kiss, unfolding his arms and wrapping them around Cas’ back, his fingertips skating across wing tips as he went. It wasn’t as if he had the willpower to turn him down. Cas may have just been praising his strength, but he wasn’t that damn strong, and it wasn't as if they had had much time alone recently.
The laugh that erupted from Dean made Cas smile in return. “Fair point but we’re not on a case. This is purely recreational. The website said they have a restaurant and a bar on site and the nicer suites have hot tubs. Let’s live a little. We can bring the gear inside in case of a problem...” He pretended to pout and batted his eyelashes at Cas in a teasing way.
“You’re a lying sack of shit,” Dean yelled out as he fought to break free of Sam and Jack’s grip. Mary stepped between them and put a hand on Dean’s chest.
Dean held the phone in one hand while leaning against the tv stand with the other. He hadn’t expected to hear Cas’ voice today and his knees went weak at the sound. “We went on a road trip. Dallas. Where the Hell are you?!” Dean said, his voice rising even as Sam shushed him. It was extremely late but there was absolutely something wrong. Dean could hear it in the pinched tone of Cas’ voice. He was controlling his tone carefully…
Today, though, he found himself lingering in his room. Sam and Dean seemed unusually busy and he didn’t want to find himself in the way, so he pulled one of the lore tomes off his nightstand and flipped to the page he’d stuck the ribbon marker in, and began to read again. It was so much easier to focus on reading when he’d been an Angel. Now his mind constantly tried to wander, and every time he heard footfalls outside his door, he would have to mentally stop and figure out which brother it was. Sam’s were slightly heavier with his added height, while Dean’s always seemed to slow down around his door. He wasn’t sure why. With his new humanity came so much more he noticed about Sam and Dean that he couldn’t explain but didn’t dare ask. That was where Eileen came in. Ever helpful but not always able to enlighten him on the quirks of humanity.
Dean knelt down and began fiddling with the knobs of the hot tub. He read the instructions the hotel had embossed on a plaque and he sighed in disappointment. “It takes a while to heat up.”
“Only now you know there are less than a dozen of us. Even fewer now that the Empty..” Naomi was cut off as Dean stepped shoulder to shoulder with Cas.
Cas buckled and sighed softly as he looked to Dean. “You know we really do need to head home in a day or two. Jack needs me. His power IS returning, and he’ll need guidance.”
“Here, let me grab the door,” Dean said with a new kind of smile as he opened the door with a squeal. Cas chose not to argue and stepped inside as Dean hollered over his shoulder. “We’re BACK!”
Cas scolded him with his eyes for teasing him, communicating without words. “Not until I have my Grace back. You’ll slip and crack your head open and I’m not making that call to your mother. She’s about to have access to our surplus Angel blades.”
“Dean, I HAVE to be strong enough to defend myself and the others if Naomi and the others come here. We don’t know what happened after we left. We don’t know if Naomi maintained control and swayed the others to her side. I have to be strong, and I cannot fight if my body is as broken as it is now.”Cas' voice drew Dean's gaze back up to him. He tried to wipe his visible anxiety at the wings and he sighed in defeat. He would argue if he could, but Cas had a very valid point.
From behind them, the first stirring of doubt was voiced by Debriel. “Castiel…what Naomi said….” He began before Aberia delivered a frightening glare toward his comment, her hair whipping around as her gaze found him.
He looked to Dean, his hands clasped in front of him as he gave him an arrogant, controlled smile. “In our defense, the swelling around the eye was decided to be less critical than the stomach wound that exited out of his back…which is what we have been working on for the last four hours…”
Dean stiffened as if someone had shocked him. “Oh.” His eyes widened and he fidgeted in discomfort, letting his fingers wrap around the headphone cord. His swallowed nervously once and a tiny flush of embarrassment colored his face.
“Humans have to wear too many layers,” Castiel grumbled as he was left in his underwear now as well.
Dean made sure the line hung up properly before tossing it gently back onto the nightstand and leaning back, letting his back press against Cas’ chest. “That was rude,” Dean grumbled as he rested his head against Cas’ shoulder, letting him lay kisses along his outstretched throat.
The girl let out a ragged breath, her bravado fading. “You were very clear, Commander. I apologize for my insolence,” She stammered as she dropped to her knees and bowed her head. Cas holstered his blade and looked down at her. “I also made it clear you were not to remove your armor. Do you know how many Angels I have seen murdered by our own weapons?” Castiel said, his voice becoming calmer as he spoke.
“Got it…” Dean said with an anticipatory tightness in his stomach. He put his foot on the gas and made sure to only go 5 over the speed limit.
Dean gasped as goosebumps raced across his skin. Cas felt like a contained storm beside him. He’d felt it before, but never when he was in such close proximity. “Cas, you okay?” Dean grabbed Cas face softly between his hands and forced eye contact as he ended the kiss. Cas’ eyes swam dark with contained emotion. Anger and lust combined inside him in a confusing assemblage. Dean studied him, his eyes narrowing. He could always read him better than anyone. “Earth to Castiel.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and tried to cross his arms defiantly but the anger went out of him when the movement pulled at one of his wounds. He winced and threw up a calming hand as Jack and Dean both leaned it to help, stopping them in their tracks.
Castiel shifted nervously, a very human gesture he’d picked up in his time on Earth. “Well, no. That was God…Chuck…G… Whatever he wants to be called,” Cas added with a dismissive gesture. “He knew you were in trouble, so he sent me down to assist.”
“I know, Cas. I know…” Dean said as he pressed them together more tightly, his lips whispering softly into Cas’ ear. “But with our time limited, let’s explore that last one a bit more. I’m always angry. Sad…yeah a lot, but with you here, I’m much more interested in that last one.” He nipped lightly at his ear before pressing soft kisses along Cas’ neck line.
Cas nodded and laid down on his right side, patting for Dean to join him. Dean crawled over and stretched out on his right side, spooning into him. Castiel admired the hard lines of his body with his fingertips as he worked to relax him. He marveled that this deadly creature was giving himself to him. His fingers danced at his hips and spread his legs with his knee. He popped the top of the lube and slicked up a finger. He traced a small wet trail down his ass and found the spot he was looking for.
“What’s wrong?” Sam said as he and Dean surveyed the room from their separate locations. Dean had one hand on the light and the other gripping his own pistol that he always tucked under his pillow.
The sun was just beginning its descent when the two opposing sides met. Cas and the others had thought it best to intercept the group before they came any closer to the bunker. It had taken some coordination and Dean was still feeling the aftereffects of Angel travel in his gut but they’d made good time. They’d had only a few minutes to wait before Naomi and her group emerged from the woods, faces stoic. Without a word, the other Angels formed a formation mirroring Cas’ group, with Naomi in the center of it. Cas stood in the center of his own group with Dean behind and to the right. The other humans of their party were flanked by other Angels. The Angels coming toward them were sterile, all greys and white and devoid of anything but focused purpose. In contrast, Castiel and his tan coat and blue tie could be deemed almost exotic. Compile that with the sprinkling of humans into the motley assortment, and there was no mistaking who was on what side once the fighting began, and for that, they could at least be thankful.
“Damn it…” Dean growled out as he pushed out of the chair and tapped on the door. “Cas? Don’t do anything stupid…” He jumped back as he felt something hard plunk against the wood door. “Shit. Cas, just…you’re mad. I get it. I’m an idiot.” There was silence in the room as Dean talked. “Okay, I’ll take your silence as agreeance. I’m sorry…I just…” Dean looked behind him at his eavesdropping family and he groaned. “Don’t make me do this in front of them, Cas…”
“You need leadership. Solid, morally sound leadership,” Castiel added. He wished he had more time to have spent with Dean, but he’d been given more than he’d ever thought he’d have again. The sooner he helped Chuck design more Angels, the sooner he’d be back there. With Dean. With his family.
Cas’ black eye was already turning purple and his split lip was all the puffier with Dean sucking it between his own before letting his teeth tug on the split, making Cas moan out. Dean’s hand was wrapped with Cas’ tie, his fist pressed against the open collar of his shirt as he rutted them together, both rock hard through their pants.
“We’re fixing up one of the cars in the garage for him. He wanted to drive Baby,” Dean said as he leaned on Cas’ shoulder to get a look at the license. Cas could smell the whiskey on his breath and it brought him back to their first kiss in the woods. His eyes met Deans, and his were similar to his own. They both knew this might be the only time they had together for who knew how long…months…years…
“Picked it up from a thrift shop in Phoenix. It’s vintage, just like you old man,” She grinned. “Try it on.”
“Your steak. Hungry?” Castiel’s stomach growled loudly in confirmation and Dean grinned widely. He gave a quick peck to Cas' lips as the microwave beeped and he turned back to it to remove it. “Steak, shower, sleep. We’ll get you all sorted out, okay?”
Cas blinked rapidly and a tear rolled down his cheek, which Dean abruptly put a thumb up to brush away. He swallowed hard and they nodded to one another, the once uncomfortable personal space issue not being one now. Cas’ voice was a soft growl as he nodded. “I hear you, Dean.”
“You should have told me. I can’t…I could never…You should go…” Dean said as he turned to dig clothes out of his duffel bag.
“She has her own motives for everything she does, Jack. I don’t try to understand them,” Castiel added hastily, avoiding making eye contact with Jack as he said it.
“Geez, you have no poker face now. I kind of love it. All I’m saying is, I’ll be gentle…” Dean said with a chuckle and Cas rolled his eyes at him, tempted to call the whole thing off to spite him and his cocky attitude.
Dean waited another long space of time before rubbing his neck nervously. “You gonna share of leave me in suspense?”
Mary frowned, lines forming on her forehead as it creased in concern. “You don’t remember? They did hit you really hard…. We were at the bunker and the wardings failed somehow. Demons came in and took us all away. There were dozens of them. Why didn’t they just kill us?”
“Oh. That was where Naomi removed my tattoo….” Castiel said with some insecurity seeping in. I am sorry. It’s not very nice to look at.” The anger that sparked into Dean’s eyes would have taken a lesser being’s breath away.
“CASTIEL!” Naomi boomed. Her voice screamed in the ears of the humans and the fighting froze. Castiel, having knocked two Angels to the ground, found Naomi. He'd heard Dean's cry over the cacophony of the fight. His eyes were dangerous as he saw her bring her Angel blade up and press it against Dean's exposed throat.
Dean was forced to shield his eyes as the shadow of Cas’ wings enveloped the room, reflected in the bright glow of blue radiating from within him. Chuck repeated the phrase again.
“It’s perfect, Cas…” Dean said softly as he walked in and ran his hand along the comforter, pressing down on the bed to study its softness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As he walked along and read the names, all in long forgotten languages, he stopped abruptly. The door on his right was a name written in clear English, and there was no birth or death date. Only the words C. Shurley on the simple plaque.
Enid, Josiah, and Kirah sat nervously at one end of the War Room table as Castiel entered, flanked by Aberia and Debriel. Dean had not been happy with the decision but Castiel had explained that every move he made from here on out had to be a calculated show of force and flaunting their relationship in front of neutral Angels was not a good plan. Dean had grumbled but nodded his hesitant acceptance. Cas had left his chest bare, displaying the still healing wounds along with the burn on his side from Naomi’s handiwork. Another calculated move that Dean had frowned at. The conversation before they left the bedroom had left him frustrated but accepting that Cas knew what he was doing.
Chuck leaned forward and rose. “Okay. Let’s get moving, then. First, though,’ Chuck snapped his fingers and Dean and Castiel stared, confused. “Oh, sorry, yeah I just took care of that nasty tracking sigil on your back and put your anti-angel tracking tattoo back. You’ll probably find that handy.” Castiel lifted the left side of his shirt up and confirmed what Chuck said as the black Enochian letters peeked out from his exposed skin.
“Hey there, we don’t have a reservation but we're hoping you’ve got something available. Check out would be in, I guess, three days. Not totally sure yet.”
Dean shook his head adamantly, glancing to Cas as he did so. “No. I didn't even know it was possible until Cas told me about what Metatron did to him.”
He truly felt for the remaining Angels and the loss of their wings, and he understood why they hated him so much for it. Though it had never been his intent, he had taken something from them he couldn't give back and they were reminded of it every time they looked at him and the new Angels. He could feel their resentment and their thinly veiled hostility at every turn. However, now the air was thick with the promise of a tipping point. He was relieved in a way. Watching his back at every turn, being constantly on edge, and having no one around him who he could trust, it was exhausting. He’d been impatiently waiting for this day for months now…
“Why, Cas? Heaven has enough Angels to run it…Chuck’s there…. Can’t he train them? What would happen if you just didn’t go back?” Dean leaned forward in his chair, intent.
“What the Hell is going on…” Mary said as she too saw the car move before Dean tumbled out…or may have been shoved out, his hands flying to pull his shirt over his fly as he tugged his clothes to rights to hide the damp spot in his jeans. “Dean! What is going on? We’ve been trying to call you. We were worried sick.”
Castiel came around the corner with a raised eyebrow. “One. I heard the holster Velcro. Two. I never enter where you or Sam are without assuming one of you is armed.”
“Those people aren’t here, Dean. There is no place in Heaven for the likes of that.” Cas gave him a knowing look before Dean nodded his approval, a close mouthed smile forming on his face.
Cas' face fell slightly and a hint of disapproval slid into his voice as he shook his head slowly. “I’ve noticed…I can’t say I don’t agree but isn’t it irresponsible to..”
“So, it’s true that Gingers don’t have souls huh?” Dean said with a smirk as he finished clicking the magical cuffs into place and stepping in front of the demon.
“I wondered how long it would take you to wander this way, my way word son….” Came a familiar voice from the plaid couch.
Dean opened the door to the bunker and tossed his duffel at Jack, who was waiting at the foot of the stairs. “Lucy, I’m home!” Dean crowed out as he made his way down.
“It wasn’t my proudest moment,” Dean said with a shrug as he picked up the empty whiskey glass and fiddled with it to avoid the disapproving glare of the Angel.
Sam shifted uncomfortably. This was far out of their comfort zone. “Who…If Cas is who you want, I support you like I always have. I’m just a little surprised is all…”
“I’ve already fallen, Dean. You just didn’t notice, did you? Treated as an outcast by the other Angels, my wings destroyed, hunted by my Angelic family. Did you think that was normal? I already fell….I fell for you. To save you and your brother. How dare you scold me now. How dare you dismiss me, after everything I have given up for you, Dean Winchester.”
“What the hell are you doing here?!” Dean almost yelled out. He glanced behind Sam to see Aberia, Jack, and Mary with him. “Bring the whole crew, huh?”
Deans’ bones ached as Chuck murmured the ancient language. He felt pressure in his mind, his body, like chains holding him down. So very heavy. Thousands upon thousands of years of knowledge, existence, bloodshed, and battle. he felt Cas...no, he felt Castiel. There was a definitive difference he'd never realized before. He squinted his eyes and watched as the grace formed a blue shimmery stream as it flowed from within Cas. It was beautiful and flowed as a living river. It was strong and bright and…good. Dean could feel the goodness to the point he felt tears pricking at his eyes, and just as bright and dramatic as it had been, it was all but gone. Dean blinked and the room was normal again, except for the stream of light shimmering and hovering near Chuck now. Castiel crumpled to the floor and Dean rushed to throw an arm around him, Chuck all but forgotten in the face of Cas needing help. Dean helped him stumble over to the bed, though he was more dead weight than help. As soon as Dean had Cas on the bed, he turned to see Chuck holding out a small glass bottle that Cas’ grace seemed slightly hesitant to go fully into.
“This world…will be better without you. We…will be better without you,” Naomi said as she raised the blade, this time with the blade itself pointed directly at his heart. As her hand made its way to the target, chaos broke loose. More Angels than could be counted broke ranks and Naomi was knocked away from him, her blade sliding far away from her target. The din of noise was deafening as bodies clashed against one another. Castiel, still handcuffed, had been tossed to the floor by his captors as the others fell upon them. He scooted toward the hall door, being half trampled as he went. His wings dragged behind him uselessly, a dozen or more feet stampeding upon them and ripping out feathers from his wings in their haste. He made it to the door and took in the chaos before him, slumped against the door frame as he pulled himself to standing. There was no making sense of the bodies…but luckily it seemed to be mostly fists, no blades being allowed by anyone except Naomi and a few of her most trusted of late. He blinked blood out of his eyes as it cascaded from a forehead cut that would not stop bleeding. He tried to stand steady, ready to defend himself as he saw Angels heading toward him in the crowd. His vision obscured, he couldn’t make out Aberia and Debriel until they were right upon him. Several other Angels fell behind them, blocking and guarding their backs.
Dean considered continuing to pout, but that wasn’t the attitude to bring into a new year. He sighed and looked toward the door. Castiel was standing sheepishly in the doorway with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders rolled in. He had the sad puppy dog eyes Dean was far too familiar with.
“Oh,” Cas said softly as he continued. He saw every touch, every brush of their hands, every shoulder pat, every lock of their eyes over the many years, from Dean’s point of view. He felt Dean’s heart stutter when he walked through the bunker door, when he’d call his cell phone, when they’d sat side by side in the Impala. This…this was not brotherly love. This…Cas could understand this. Castiel felt this as well.
“Nothing, except the want to do other things I suppose,” Cas said with a soft laugh as Dean’s eyes widened.
“Is…is it gonna be like that every time?” Dean was awash in a mixture of nervousness and anticipation at the prospect.
“There are several bedrooms upstairs in case you decide to have company. There’s never any need for people to house in groups, but many choose it. It truly is whatever makes them happy now. I have procured a spot for Sam and Eileen’s home right across the tree line for when the time comes. Here, this is the main bedroom. There is a master bath off of it, though there won’t be a toilet. No need of course. However, we found people requested bathtubs and showers as it was said to be more than a means of getting clean and seen as a pleasure of sorts, so we added them in.”
Dean let a heavy sigh escape and he ran his hand through his hair. “You’re right. She’s just doing what she’s told. I don’t want either of you to get in trouble because of me, and I know. I trust you, Cas. I’ll be safe. You be safe. Everything will work out eventually. It has to, right?”
?” Cas and Dean both shrugged apologetically and Sam shook his head. “I cannot believe you two assholes. You couldn’t trust
“Dean, I’m sorry but my time is extremely short and unpredictable, and there are things I have to say.” Castiel leaned closely and looked into Dean’s eyes. He nodded slowly and Cas removed his hand. “Dean, the time may come when I can return here. There are events happening that might make it so. I can’t tell you why or even when, but please trust me. I need to know if there is a reason for me to come back here, to you. Am I better off where I am? If so, I will accept that answer but I cannot continue on with the hope of returning to you not knowing…not knowing if I am wanted. If I am better staying in Heaven and serving them, I will do it. I don’t want to be a burden. Do you understand what I am asking you?”
Cas looked over at him, his eyes heavy-lidded as they raked over him. "Oh yes. I would...I would close my eyes and imagine you touching me. You wanting me the way I wanted you."
“Castiel belongs in Heaven. It is his true home, no matter how you all have turned him against us. His celestial essence could be the difference between Heaven continuing to function and the end of it all.  Do you realize what would happen if Heaven fell? We’re talking about billions of souls being unleashed upon this planet you both claim to care so much about. Billions of restless spirits with nowhere to go. Souls that belong to people you care about…Your friends Ellen and Jo Harvell…the Prophet Kevin…your little friend Charlie…Bobby Singer…John Winchester….” Naomi said as she continued to stare at Dean. “Their souls will be doomed to roam the earth as restless, angry spirits. Never allowed to rest, and everyone who dies from then on would meet the same fate, and we all know the damage one angry spirit can do. Imagine millions…”
The demon smiled, eerily flashing bright white teeth. “I’m in good company then. All the demons know you and your brother have lost your souls before. Whoopsie….” The demon hissed out with amusement. “Slippery things, souls, aren’t they? Pretty overrated too. You, boy, yours is looking a little slippery too.” He spoke to Jack, his eyebrow quirking. Jack looked worriedly from Sam to Dean until Dean stepped in front of him, blocking the demon's view of him.
Castiel shook his head forcefully. “No, it’s nothing like that. Nothing like my connection with you either, Jack. I am not their creator. Much more their teacher. I feel the same for them as I used to feel for my flock. There is a comfort to being around those of my own kind…. but nothing like being home, with you.” He looked to the Winchesters as a whole.
Dean shook his head, a smile pulling one side of his mouth up. “No, this only ends one way. You dead, but you get to choose how easy or hard that is.” Dean shrugged calmly as he picked up a bag of rock salt. “Now if you know me, you know….I’m pretty good at this…” Dean growled out as he tossed the bag of salt from hand to hand.
“I love you,” Cas breathed out softly as his lips brushed Dean’s Adam’s apple, making a desperate sound escape his lips he’d never heard before. In response, Dean cupped Cas’ face in his hands, his thumbs gently caressing the corners of his mouth, brushing against the rough stubble as he beckoned his lips open with his tongue, softly asking permission to explore his mouth, which Cas freely gave with a groan of his own. Dean’s thighs straddled Cas’ lap and they rutted against one another as the kiss deepened. Cas’ nails bit softly into the smooth expanse of his back as Dean moved his fingers to twine in his hair, desperate to keep them as close as possible. It was as if a fine layer of metal had kept them apart, an unwanted and unasked for shield, but the sheer power of their skin touching was turning the metal to molten fire against their skin, burning them in the most pleasant of ways, molding them into one creature made of nothing but want.
Dean locked eyes with Cas as he opened them and the relief he felt at the understanding in the Angel’s eyes was palpable. “I love you, Cas. We’re finally on the same page here, you see. No more walls. No more obstacles. No more misunderstandings. You see?”
“I do. Those three were chosen to come to us to send a very clear message. I know the new Angels more than anyone, and those three had the most difficulty with Naomi from the start. The choir took Heaven. Let’s see what they have to say,” Cas said as he struggled to sit up and Dean and Debriel both dove to assist him. The two locked eyes over Cas' shoulder and they shared a moment of understanding between them. They'd follow Cas' lead, but both had their own trepidations.
“The Hell I can’t when you wince away from the slightest contact with me. You don’t do it to Sam. Or mom. Just little old me. Was it the Mark? Or the demon eyes? Or me saying yes to Michael…I know how much you fought for me to say no.  I just didn’t know another way or…”
Dean grunted out in rhythm with Castiel’s movements behind him. “Cas!” Dean yelled as he felt the build up of a prostate orgasm wash over him, making his muscles rigid as the feeling overtook him. Cas’ mouth never stopped moving, as if he could swallow every sound Dean made through his dick.
Dean and the others make it home to find Castiel injured and they discuss the events that happened in Heaven and what that means for them now.
Dean's forehead was creased with concern and the crow's feet around his eyes could not have been more prominent as he frowned. “And you could die…”
Naomi stood in front of the Heaven portal, Castiel by her side. His shoulders were slumped in defeat and he hadn’t spoken one word since they left Dean in the dark. The sun was beginning to rise, leaving a soft glow on the horizon. “For what it’s worth, Castiel, I do acknowledge your sacrifice, though I also know it isn’t for our benefit.”
Dean was only gone a matter of minutes and came back around the corner dressed and ready to go. Though the Angel blade was concealed, Cas could see by the way Dean’s dark green canvas jacket hung heavier on one side that he had it.
Dean let out a husky, relieved laugh. He felt weightless, almost drunk. “Way to make me sound like a ho. Cas. Not to put too much pressure on the situation here but I’ve never been with another man…only you.” Cas’ face gave away his shock. “Well, don’t look so stunned. You might insult me.” Dean kissed his chin, enjoying the soft stubble against his lips. “I wasn’t opposed to the idea...just never found the right one, but there are other ways to...” Dean began as he reached between them and gently cupped their dicks together in his hand. Pressing them together felt overwhelmingly good. He was biblically familiar with his own shaft obviously, but holding Cas in his hand, next to his own, was exciting. His heart raced at the mere thought. When he began to stroke them in unison, he thought Castiel might fall out of the bed. His eyes were swimming and he joined Dean in his task, wrapping his hand around his own.
Castiel leaned in and let Dean’s fingers stroke along the glossy black feathers. His eyes closed in contentment, like a cat. “They healed in Heaven.”
“And we don’t?” Aberia spat back as she walked toward the group. “We gave up everything to help get him here.”
Naomi had been calm and compliant as the time passed, doing nothing to raise alarm with him…which in itself was alarming. She had been downright cordial to him…on the surface. However, Castiel knew Naomi well enough and he could all but taste the disdain in her voice for him. To the younger Angels, however, she put on a good show. He thought all of this as the door to her office closed behind him and he was left seemingly alone with her. Naomi stood and gestured toward the chair, which Castiel politely shook his head to decline. Her shoulders moved in a hint of frustration, a movement that would have flowed into her wing movement…if she’d had wings left to move.
“I’m not asking for your support or your understanding, Sammy. You want to give it, that’s great, but you don’t have to understand. This has been building for a long time but both of us were damn cowards about it, and that’s done.”
“Look time’s relative up there. If I leave now, I may not come back for weeks, months, years. You get the idea. Gotta settle this now. You think this isn’t awkward for me too? Angels aren’t supposed to find the slightest appeal in you humans. I built them that way, yet he keeps proving me wrong, and I’m GOD. Talk about awkward.” Chuck rolled his eyes and continued his texting as if he hadn't spoken at all.
Chuck’s smile was a kind and understanding one. “One thing at a time, Castiel…. but once we get this design right and I can create more Angels, yes. You deserve to be happy after all you have done for me, for Heaven, and for Earth.”
Castiel closed his eyes and his face softened. “I’m sorry, Jack. I just….I don’t want to go but I have to. Please, don’t make it harder than it already is.” The atmosphere in the room was dimmed by the realization and they did not bring it up again, much to Cas’ relief.
“We got your back, Cas,” Sam said as he gave a level gaze to the other Angels, challenge in his tone and his face stoic.
“Speaking of which…”Dean led in as he slid glasses to everyone. He hesitated at Jack, shrugged and slid him one as well. “You’ve earned it kid.” He sat down, kicked the chair out beside him, nodded to Cas, and poured himself whiskey before sliding the bottle to his mom. Castiel sat down in the offered chair and leaned his elbows on the table, leaning like he had not been able to relax in a long time.
“Okay…don’t die,” Dean growled out, his hand already on the door to load the Impala. Sam and Jack were scurrying behind him, throwing every miscellaneous item of theirs in any open bag they had.
He slowed as he saw a soft spark of blue behind Cas’ eyes and he immediately pulled away to leave a chaste kiss on his inner thigh. “Uh uh. If you blow the bulbs again, Sam’s not going to speak to either of us for a week. We promised.”
“Because I said you must!” Naomi boomed with authority. “We need his help, and we will accept it to keep the souls entrusted to our care, safe! Now, everyone go back to their stations!” Castiel watched the other Angels file out slowly, grumbling to themselves as they went.
“Cas, while blunt, wasn’t wrong about what he said about dad, and I will make my own choices. Cas and I…we…” Jody grinned proudly and crossed her arms over her chest as Dean struggled to find the words. He looked to Cas, who nodded encouragingly. Dean looked to him for help.
Naomi sighed dramatically. “Can’t we get past that? There is a much greater picture to deal with now. It’s time…” She said as the Heaven Portal began to glow in the sand box sigils. “It’s time…to go home.” Cas threw one desperate glance around him, knowing he might never be able to walk Earth again. He stared at the sunrise, his face beginning to be illuminated by the orange glow. He took in a breath, knowing there was a chance this was his last moment ever on Earth.
Mary bit her lip softly, hesitating on her words. She knew this conversation would most likely not go well. “Dean, you know, we could use some expert advice…Maybe Castiel would know what the increase in demonic activity is about….”
“True, but Castiel does!” Jack chimed in again, looking at Cas earnestly. Castiel couldn't help but smile in return at his protege, which made Aberia's frown deepen into her soft olive complexion.
Dean stayed waiting until they were completely out of sight. His feet felt cemented to the parking lot and he still had Cas’ keys clenched in one fist. How did this go so sideways? What would he tell Jack and Sam? How could he go back and explain all of this when he didn’t even understand himself? He finally pulled away from the spot he’d been glued to and slid into Cas’ car. He’d just been here...right here…and now…. Dean buckled up and clenched the wheel. He started to shift out of park but stopped and banged both hands against the wheel, cursing. After a few minutes he composed himself and headed back to deliver the news.
Castiel nodded once. “She has gotten sloppy and let her anger get the best of her. She is very dangerous right now.”
Dean side eyed Cas and noted his sour expression. “I mean, I was going to go with Jack and Sam but the no booze rule was kind of a buzz kill. You didn’t spoil anything….” He trailed off.
Jack nodded solemnly. “Sam talked to me about what it was like…to be soulless. I think I understand now why you were so upset with me.”
Dean took one shaky step forward, clearing his throat and almost smiling as Cas took a step back. “Are you scared of me, Cas? You’re running like you are.”
“How did you know…” Aberia said with a raised eyebrow as she kicked the cuffs down another hallway. Cas let Aberia pull his left arm around her shoulders for support as they continued toward the portal.
Castiel’s mouth tightened in a sad smile. He shook his head, speaking to Jack but knowing Dean needed to hear this as well. “I’m sorry, Jack. That was removed by Naomi when I agreed to return, and I had to agree to be warded with a tracking sigil. I truly have no choice without bringing the wrath of Heaven down on you all, and I won’t do that.”
“Yes?” Cas called as he closed the tome with a dull thud as he turned the handle of his unlocked door.
“Adrenaline rush?” Dean said as he kneeled next to the chair. Cas' eyes were wide as he nodded silently. “Just breathe through it. Your heart will stop racing in a minute, when your body realizes your not in danger anymore." Cas gripped Dean’s hand and Dean squeezed back reassuringly.
Chuck crossed his arms and leaned back, the picture of ease and oozing confidence. “Not dealing. Just pointing out what you already know. Jack was half human when he died. Your claim on him, that you used to make your deal with Castiel, isn't valid."
Sam sighed and ignored his barking tone. “I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t understand. I think I do a little more now thanks to Jack.” Dean raised an eyebrow in a gesture to continue.
Debriel was looking on with a mixture of confusion and concern on this face as Castiel argued his case. “Aberia is only staying a couple of weeks, Debriel. I have no intention of her staying on Earth.”
Debriel froze with his hand on the railing of the stairs as he looked down. “You truly would ask us for help, correct?”
Once inside, Mary had her arms crossed and pointed to Dean and Cas. “Sit.” They both came in and sat down heavily on the bed, almost in unison. Cas still had his belt folded in his hands and Mary looked down at it with a frown. “Now explain.” Dean and Cas looked at each other then back to Mary without a word, before Claire piped up from beside Jody. “Well, when two people…”
“Different….” Mary said with a nod as she stared at the door Dean had walked out of. A look of realization came across her face, but Sam missed it.
“Yes, how are we supposed to be forgiving of what he and his humans have done to us?” added Fedrien, a dark-haired female Angel.
Dean rolled his eyes playfully. “Fine. You’re not wrong, and no I don’t wanna talk about it. What’s my bill?” She smiled and wrote up his tab. He got his wallet out of his back pocket, fished out a few bills and tossed them on top of the bill. “Have a good night,” Dean said before gesturing to Mary he was heading to the hotel. She nodded and went back to talking to Bobby, a bright smile on her face. Dean’s eyes narrowed in suspicion before shrugging and heading out the door. The hotel was only a parking lot away from the bar. It was all but abandoned, this being a sparse strip of highway. He made his way slowly across the lot, his hand in his pocket to grab up his hotel key. He crossed the grassy barrier between the parking lots when he froze in place, a familiar voice grabbing his attention.
“Dean, he said someday. It could be years…it’s really not fair of him to dangle that in front of you like that. I really…I really hoped you’d found something else to cheer you up…I mean…It’s great that Cas has the chance to come home, but you can’t hang all your hopes on that…” Sam said with a frown as he shook his head in concern. Jack looked from Sam to Dean, growing tension in his body.
know it doesn’t help. I promise we get through today and you and I can eat Ben and Jerry’s and swap stories about all the things we feel shitty about, but not today, okay?”
“Was it something I said?” The demon purred out as Mary stepped into the circle, a blade flashing in her hand.
Castiel let out a sigh. “Eventually. These Angels are not ready to be cut loose, especially considering their main influence when I leave will be Naomi. I must make my impression upon them before that time comes. The last thing we need is hundreds of Angels like her running around.”
Sam shook his head and tried to put a gentle hand on her arm, but she took a step away. “Because I know them both better than
Unexpectantly, the man-creature collapsed as if he was a puppet whose strings had been cut. Dean’s arms collapsed with the sudden dead weight and the head of the creature rolled to the side. Mary got on her knees and pushed the body off Dean. They both were breathing hard as they looked over at the newly deceased creature. Its eye had already begun to glaze over in death.
“What do you think?” Cas asked as he looked around. The group gave an affirmative through thumbs-up, wolf whistles, and teasing but Dean looked away and studied his own shoes until Cas moved on.
Chuck nodded his head and turned on his stool and jotted down notes on a notepad beside his sketch pad. “These are all great observations. So, what do you think made you different?”
Pamela smiled then and wiggled her eyebrows. “Of course, he has. I’d like to keep him around more with those pretty blue eyes of his.” Dean pretended to smile but a snarl of jealousy reared up in his gut again. Pamela winked at Dean and added, “Hey, like I ever stood a chance, right?”
Cas closed his eyes and Dean watched as his breathing slowed. He watched in rapt fascination as his wings smoothed and settled in rhythm with his calming breaths. When he opened his startling blue eyes, he arched one eyebrow playfully. “That you did. They give our thoughts away. Another reason we prefer to keep them tucked away.”
“Then we,” Aberia gestured to herself and the surrounding Angels, “got to Castiel before he was trampled to death and we all left through the Heaven portal before anyone else was wise to our escape.”
Castiel’s frown deepened. “That’s what I’m afraid of. I’m not that important to anyone. He doesn’t need to risk himself."
Sam looked to Dean again, looking for guidance and finding none. “What do we do? What does that mean?”
That left Castiel and Dean alone in the quiet living room. Dean was tired but there was no way he was going to miss out on what little time they had left till who knew when.
Sam stood in the doorway, his hands tucked in his pockets and his shoulders rolled in, his demeanor nothing if not apologetic. “Can we talk?”
Castiel moved his left hand to rub circles on Dean’s back now. “Well I’ve always found myself to have a vested interest in your ass.”
Dean sighed softly, “I’m going to get you some water, Cas. Coffee will just make it worse.” He padded softly to the kitchen, grabbed a paper cup and filled it with cool tap water. As he handed it to him, he addressed the others. “I’m sorry, but one, you absolutely still would have come. You’d want to help him too, which is expected. He’s family.” Cas sipped quietly and leaned his head back against the chair. “Two. I debated on texting you or calling but how was I going to explain this without a full conversation? I just thought it could wait three days…It’s literally only been a few hours. I was trying to do the right thing here.”
Aberia was about to speak but Debriel put his hand over her mouth, flashed a smile that could barely be seen due to the helmet, and they disappeared. Finally, the only Angel left was Castiel.
“Angel or human, you are mine, Dean Winchester. Body and soul,” Cas said with a teeth-clenched growl as he slid out and back in, hard, making Dean whine. Cas slid his hands up his sides, gripping Dean’s hands in his own and holding them on either side of his head as he continued his thrusts. Dean moved with him, their warm breaths mingling together as their noses brushed.
“If you’d kept your phones charged, we’d all be asleep right now…” Mary said with an eye roll as she leaned against the back of the couch and glanced at the watch on her wrist.
“Pretty sure all of that was blasphemy, Angel,” Dean said with a mirrored smile, his eyelids heavy and content.
“Okay, now let’s move on to offensive moves…” He said to take the attention away from him. An excited murmur ran through the eager young Angels and Castiel willed himself to focus on the task at hand. He wondered if Dean thought of him as often as he did him. Of course, Dean had his family and hunting to distract him. Castiel felt alone even though he was surrounded by a hundred others. He snatched up his Angel blade, ready to show them attack moves. The sooner he got them up to speed, the sooner he could go home and ask Dean for himself.
“What? What will happen?” Dean looked to Aberia and the other Angels for answers as he felt Cas glare at him. Cas then turned his gaze to the other Angels and raised his eyebrow and shook his head in a silent order of silence.
was. The only one didn’t just see a killer, a drunk, a hunter, his father's protege, or a broken man. He saw
“Naomi…I… ”Cas said as he turned to face her. There she stood in her grey pants suit, looking sure of herself, but Naomi’s eyes suddenly tightened as she studied him, her gaze suddenly far too studious.
Cas shrugged and gave Dean a knowing look, his eyebrow raised in question. “With you around? Always.”
Dean cringed to himself and patted his back, “Thousands of Angels…She’s killed one. And is far younger than you. Jack has been through this crisis a lot more recently than you. Let him help her for a few days. We deserve a few moments of peace. Anyway, she was one of the ones that asked you to get the hell out.”
“Not THAT scandalous….Now, key cards?” Castiel asked and Dean swiped up his wallet, passing one to him and confirming his own was tucked away inside before he stuffed in his back pocket. "Should we call home to give Sam and them a heads up."
Nights that Sam wasn’t there, Dean lured him out of his room with the promise of snacks and a movie, using his own loneliness with Sam gone as an excuse to make Cas watch one of his westerns. They’d sit in the Dean Cave, a small wooden table separating the cheap plaid chairs, and their hands would brush as they both reached for popcorn or their beer at the same time…but neither said a word, about anything.
“You need help with the chest piece? Everyone else is suited up and ready to go. We found a few extra Angel blades stashed in the armory. I thought I remembered tucking some of them away after some of our Angel issues before. There were enough for us measly humans to each get one.” Dean laughed softly but Castiel finally turned and his laughter died away. Dean's heart immediately began to race at the seriousness on Cas' face.  “What’s wrong?”
Naomi looked over at him, a bit of pity in her face. He preferred the others' hostility. “You can’t have imagined they would welcome you with open arms, Castiel. Not after what you’ve done.”
“They ARE our equals. They have more than proven themselves in battle. Many more times than you have, and without all of our advantanges” Castiel said as he looked toward their group, his voice a dangerous growl that made the other Angels all drop their eyes, hoping to soften his temper. Castiel knew the need to defend his family was torn by an equally great urge to protect them. His two views were at war with one another as he shook his head, unable to make peace with one or other. He turned his disapproving look to Dean now, who, unlike the Angels, refused to bend to his will. “However, I’ve made my views clear on this Dean…”
“Castiel, if you don’t let us work on those wounds soon….” Aberia said as she rested her chin on her knuckles as she propped her elbow on her knee. She looked between Cas and Dean with obvious bemusement that she was trying very hard to keep to herself.
!” Claire yelled and the crowd froze. “Everyone shut up! One. Mary, no offense but your homophobia is showing. Let’s call it what it
“Yes, Heaven is failing. That’s why I’m here…” Chuck said as he walked hurriedly over to his drawing table. “I need to design more Angels, but better than before obviously. However, I’m running into some issues…” He tapped the eraser end of his pencil on the pad before bringing it between his teeth for a moment.
“Violence sounds like a good option about now…Cas!” Dean growled out as he leaned against the door. “At least let me know you haven’t taken your Grace back and poofed out on me…Shit… Seriously, Cas. Answer me.” Dean’s voice took on a worried tone as he realized that was a possibility.
Castiel looked to Duma and he could see the conflict in her eyes, but he knew she’d do what Naomi wanted in the end because they all feared her. They were sheep without a shepherd and Naomi was the closest they had to leadership. Duma stepped over and removed his coat with the help of the other Angels then two more Angels came and turned him roughly so that his face was against the wall. They stretched his wings out of the way and Naomi again lifted his shirt but this time the pain radiated in waves as she drew out the tracking sigil, much larger than he knew it had to be. His body shook with the effort not to make a sound, but he wouldn’t give her the satisfaction. It seemed to go on forever before Naomi stepped back and the hands holding him released him. He closed his eyes a moment, swallowed hard and turned around. The group was gone. They must have anticipated him lashing out after the deed was done. He saw a tan piece of cloth peeking out from around the corner. Duma had dropped his coat, whether intentionally or not. He picked it up, dusted it off, winced at the pain he was in, and carefully put it back on. He would remember this moment, and he would not be stuck in this place forever. In that, he could assure himself. He would find a way home.
Cas slowly slid his arms into it and fixed the collar and when he looked up, Dean’s eyes were saucers and his tongue flicked out to wet his lips.
“Cas, you never told us some of that.” Sam finally spoke, breaking the heavy air that had filled the room. He looked distraught as he swallowed hard.
Sam smiled bigger and scratched the back of his neck with nervous energy. “Yeah. Uh, tell Dean to not forget the Spring Mix. He may not eat rabbit food but the rest of us do.”
“Those Angels were trying to restart the Apocalypse and destroy the world….”  Castiel said with barely veiled hostility.
“Thank you…you too, listen Dean…” Castiel began, his voice firm and his eyes avoiding his gaze. “I don’t know what’s about to happen…but I can’t run from him, you know that. I actually thought he would listen to the Angels and leave me be…It was stupid of me to believe..”
Castiel dragged open the bunker door. It made an angry screech of protest that made the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck hackle. He felt vulnerable and exposed and realized too late he was weaponless, his usual gear still tucked under his pillow. His eyes widened in alarm as he realized he wasn’t the only one unarmed. Castiel was clearly unarmed and opening the door to an unknown situation.  At least he had Sam and Mom at his back. Dean looked over to Sam and watched as he reassuringly nodded, knowing his brother’s thought process. His eyes went to Mary, who also nodded and had her hand at the small of her back. Jack’s forehead was scrunched in thought as he looked between Dean and Castiel. Dean smiled softly to himself. He’d beg out of that conversation. Sam could handle that.
Sam came in from the Library and raised an eyebrow and a shared look with Jack. “Well, you’re in much better spirits.”
Cas, his shoulders rolled forward menacingly and his eyes tight with anger, raised an eyebrow as he locked eyes her with. “Though I have no more authority in Heaven or over you, I suggest for your sake you take it as such.”
Chuck smiled and went to sit next to Castiel on the couch. “Castiel, I created you but I afraid I cannot take credit for who you have become. You are humble, full of contrition, and always striving to be better than you were. You have fallen down and instead of giving up, you got up and tried harder. You have sacrificed so much for the greater good, and you are still sacrificing. You have given up so much…more than you admit to anyone. But I can see you, Castiel, and no matter what you have done, those things have made you who you are….and I am proud of who you have become. You should be too.”
A minute or so of this went by and Dean softly breathed out, “More.” Castiel slid out and slicked up two fingers and slid them back into his tight heat. His dick was quickly rebounding from the clock blocking phone call and Dean could feel it growing against his thigh. He had to admit the more Cas pumped into him, the better it felt. Soon he was working himself onto his fingers and Cas was breathing huskily in his ear in anticipation. “Cas…you now,” Dean gasped out and he felt his skin flush in embarrassment and nervousness.
“Fair enough,” Castiel said as a true, tooth flashing smile appeared on his face, one Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever actually seen grace his features before. It was carefree and he was almost purring in contentment.
Dean looked up, surprised at his forthcoming attitude. He'd never thought to ask why Castiel had been the one sent to save him. He'd always made the assumption he'd drawn the short straw. Who would want that gig? “Why him? Why was he chosen for it?”
Naomi's face screwed up into a bitter scowl, her eyes narrowing dangerously. “Yes, which just proves there is no justice in this world…after all the Angels you killed…after everything you’ve done…Only a monster such as yourself would stand here and brag about the slaughter of your true family.”
Castiel shook his head, his eyes scanning the cluster of Angels. “I can’t control it, Naomi. I had no clue it would happen by returning to Heaven…”
“No, I mean…” Jack began but Sam’s phone rang at that moment and he held up a finger to silence Jack before he stood up and walked out to take the call.
“It was an accidental oversight. Dean has been distracted with caring for me. I know it seems strange, but going from Angel to human, my senses are overwhelmed…As an Angel I was able to just file away unnecessary sounds, feelings, etc., As a human, it’s more of a learned skill to be able to control my emotions and be able to process things. The air conditioner blowing on my skin, an itch on my arm. None of these were things I dealt with before. I can’t fully help anyone to understand and though I have been through this once before, it does not seem to be making it any easier. Having someone around has helped though.” Cas looked to Dean then, his face radiating gratefulness to the point that those on the couch squirmed in discomfort at the intimacy. Everyone was quiet, letting Cas' body catch up to the current events that they were safe until Jack cleared his throat.
Castiel looked thoughtfully at Aberia and nodded as they walked. His forehead lowered and his eyebrow raised in consideration of her carefully chosen words. “Accepting something that you do not understand is very good growth for you.”
Dean laughed nervously, cussing as the key-card kept blinking red at him. He had repeatedly had to convince Cas…and himself that pulling over on the side of the road was neither safe nor smart. Toward the end he wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince more. Cas kissed his neck, pressing their weight into the door as Dean finally got the key-card to work and they stumbled in. Dean let Cas push him against the door as they came in, letting their weight close it. He groaned softly as their mouths finally found one another. Cas hands felt so hot as he hungrily pushed them under Dean’s shirt.
“Thank you Enid…” Castiel said with genuine feeling as he stood, laying his hands palms down on the table. “How many of the new choir went with her?”
she opened and closed her mouth several times, deciding the best words to choose. “Very well. We have regular training with the choir. Same schedule as before. You’re both dismissed…” with a wave of her hand she dismissed them both from her office. Castiel sighed in obvious relief at the lack of a fight and she studied his back as he left. His wings were sullen, droopy even. She knew spending time on Earth was a bad idea, but it wasn’t like she could argue with God…. even if she wanted to, she wasn’t that stupid. She had not survived as long as she had by making foolish moves. The day would come when she would no longer need Castiel. The new Angels were growing stronger and more disciplined, but she certainly didn’t need him on Earth causing more havoc…What to do…His negative influence on the Angels now could be disastrous in the future. They certainly didn’t need more rogue Angels running around, and though he was a good teacher and strong fighter, at his core he would forever be a renegade. She needed a plan…
Suddenly it was Dean’s turn to deny, his eyes still bleary with the effects of the alcohol. “I don’t know what you mean.”
Castiel slowly scooted back on the pillows to appease the grouchy Angels around him. His heart felt like it could slow down now that he heard Dean’s voice, momentarily assured of his safety or at the very least being alive. “Dean, where are you?”
“And humans go to Heaven…” Chuck smiled back, cooly crossing his arms across his chest and leaning back in the booth.
“Why didn’t they just kill us?” Mary added again, pulling on her chains again, more urgency in her tone now.
“If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my life, when you’ve got a king size bed to fool around on, you use it. Come on, Angel…” Dean stuttered over the last word and his face froze, studying Cas. “Sorry…if that bothers you…I didn’t…”
“That story can’t be true…that’d mean….” Aberia said with a frown as her wings shrunk to her side in a show of insecurity. Suddenly, silence fell across the Coliseum.
,” Dean said with a nervous laugh, his own insecurities bubbling up despite the after-effects of whatever they were experiencing.
“I have no other friends. No social life. No hobbies. Don’t I deserve a drink sometimes?” He stared at Cas’ extended hand a moment before instead reaching for an open bottle on the nightstand. Cas reached out and grabbed his wrist, stopping him. They stared at one another a moment before Cas let go and stepped back.
“These humans are better warriors than you may ever be, and they do it with no special powers or wings. Dean and Sam were both chosen by Heaven as hosts to Archangels. Jack is the child of an Archangel. Mary is one of the best hunters in the world through sheer training and willpower. I do not have time to list all the ways they could best you. Let that be enough. You would do well to show them some respect.” Castiel nodded to Dean and he lowered the blade and stepped to Cas’ side.
“Sammy, the ever-present cock blocker,” Dean growled out as he gently pulled away. Castiel blinked like he’d been in a daze and Dean smiled proudly. “Dude, you are not at all presentable.” He looked him up and down and his clothes were a jumbled mass of wrinkles and his hair was a disheveled mess.
Cas read his first. “Sam and Jack have left the park but are going downtown to watch the small ball drop they are doing. Sounds like they are having a good time,” He said with a smile as he looked at the photo of Jack watching the fireworks that Sam had sent them both.
“It wasn’t your time, Dean…” Cas said with a deepening frown that made him shuffle his feet and look around them at the others watching them. He coughed and Cas turned to look at everyone, who stopped watching and went back to their mingling. “We can talk about that another time, though. I would like to show you some things, if you are willing to come with me.”
Dean let the silence linger longer than he liked as he and Cas looked at each other across the kitchen space. “You know that’s not true,” he said as he averted his eyes and took a loud swallow of the soda.
“Enid, Josiah, Kirah…” Castiel said as he entered, doing his best not to limp or show any signs of the pain his wings were still causing him. He fought to hold them at their natural angle and negate the muscular tremors. It was one thing to have his wounds on display, but he did not want to broadcast the pain he was still in. He truly believed showing his injuries was a strategic move but even he could not bring himself to look like an easy target in front of Angels who might not have his best interests at heart. Cas could feel Dean's eyes on him even now. Yes, he couldn't have him by his side but he gave in to allow him to linger in the background. After all, this was his home they were in, and Cas would always find a way to compromise when it came to Dean.
Dean let out a frustrated sigh as he ran a hand through his short hair. “You're right. It's not your business and this isn’t the place for this, and even if he doesn’t come back, what do you want me to do? Sign up for Tinder? I’m a 40-year-old hunter that’s in love with an Angel. All my friends are dead and I live in an unground bunker with my brother and my sorta-not-son that’s half Angel. You see the line of people ready to sign up for that? Cause I sure don’t. So, yeah, I think I'll wait for Cas. He’s the only one I want anyway, so now that we’ve got that covered, can we go smite a demon or two?” Mary nodded, embarrassed and they went to load up on weapons. Sam raised an eyebrow as Dean stormed over but Mary shook her head.
“Hey, you wanna drive on the way home?” Dean blurted out and seemed almost as surprised as Cas was that he’d said it. They stared at one another as Dean gripped the keys in his fist.
He quietly padded to the bathroom in the other side of the suite, his feet making little sound on the light tan carpet. Cas rolled out of the bed gracefully and pulled off the bed sheets. He could have mojo’d them clean perhaps but he hated wasting grace on such small things. After being without his grace or with low grace for so many years, he’d learned to not use it needlessly. He put them in a heap at the floor of the closet and grabbed up a new set from the dresser he’d spied it earlier when unpacking. He worked to make the bed as he heard the shower come on in the other room. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath as an overwhelming urge to slip into the shower with him came over him. He let a breath out and opened his eyes and forced himself to continue his task, knowing Dean needed recovery time and food. Just as he was pulling the comforter back into place and tossing the pillows back on the bed, his own phone, discarded on his nightstand, began to ring. He picked it up and shook his head at the unknown number, but he hesitated and hit the green phone button to answer. As he held it up to his ear, Dean appeared, smiling and with a towel wrapped around his waist, not yet damp from the shower...He froze as he saw the look on Cas’ face and the one finger held up toward him. Dean studied his face, which had become hard and his eyes tight. As Castiel hung up without saying a word, he cocked his own head in confusion.
“Okay, great, yeah. That’s…okay, let’s get the rest of the list and head out.” Dean stumbled in his hurry to turn around and Cas remained more puzzled. Dean’s flustered mood seemed to die down by the time they were loading the groceries into the trunk, placing the paper sacks over the weapons like it was normal to have machetes and Enochian brass knuckles riding alongside turkey hot dogs and sodas. Dean even seemed in a much better mood on their way to the bakery after they’d stopped for gas. He watched as Dean grabbed up a cassette tape and read the handwritten label before popping it in. They didn’t talk as Dean pulled out and drove toward the bakery, but Dean drummed his hands on the wheel and jiggled his knee to the music, which was normal for him. However, Cas looked at him with further confusion when Dean gave a snorty laugh through his nose as a song came on. “Zeppelin,” Dean murmured as he glanced at Cas.
“The Empty invaded Heaven to retrieve Jack’s Soul..” Castiel spoke up before Naomi could. He spoke without looking toward Dean, afraid to give away more than he was willing to tell.  “The Empty put a claim on his Soul because he was part Angel.”
Cas stood still, frozen in place by a mixture of disappointment and hope, hope that Dean would look his way again, and fear that he would.
“Are both things I have lived without before,” Cas said calmly as he nervously tugged at his tie to straighten it as Chuck watched the two of them silently.
Mary came walking out of the warehouse a few minutes later, blood splattering her canvas jacket. “We’ve got problems….”
Dean and the others fidgeted nervously as Castiel’s voice rose, echoing with the vaulted ceilings. “I do not need an escort, especially not one that is but a child. I am very aware of where the Heaven portal is and it is not as if I could hide if I wanted to, thanks to Naomi’s handiwork. You know what she is and yet you choose to follow her. I truly thought you had more sense than that…” The disappointment in his tone could be felt even by the humans below. They watched Aberia's bravado falter before their very eyes as her shoulders rolled slightly in and her chin dropped ever so slightly.
He’d just let his mind drift, studying the planes of Dean’s sleeping face when a soft knock came at the bedroom door. He’d dismissed the Angels to rest and recharge before healing him so he assumed they were ready to get back at it. However, one look at Debriel’s face said otherwise.
Cas came and leaned shoulder to shoulder with Dean against the counter. “Well, I have noticed you have been drinking far less since we’ve all been back home together…” Castiel stumbled only once on the word home, hoping Dean wouldn’t notice. He did.
“His bunker…” Aberia nodded to Cas as she steadied him with one arm slung around his shoulders and his ruined wing bases. Though he was larger in form than her, she was still an Angel and she did not buckle under his weight. Her face was hard and determined as she strode as quickly as she could. “and we’ve got to get these cuffs off…”
“Will this place really keep us safe from the others?” spoke up a blonde, small boned Angel that had entered reluctantly, feeling the cave-like quality of the building as she entered.
“Hmm. You know, Gabriel liked sweets. Do you think your…siblings and you might be more prone to sweets? Not that I like all that sugary crap, but a mocha or caramel coffee might be up your alley.”
“Well, since this is your first time, why don’t I make you an assortment, so you can find out what you like?” Dean choked behind him and Cas turned around with a questioning look.
The Angel studied the ground a moment, as if suddenly shy, and nodded his head slowly before raising his eyes to meet Deans, the heat between them on Earth apparently still present in Heaven. “None of them are finished. I wanted you to do that. To build them yourself. You can scrap them and start from the ground up if you would like. Whatever would make you happy, Dean. You deserve happiness here.”
Debriel lowered his head and his wings tucked closer to his shoulders. “We apologize, Commander, but our orders were specific.”
“You know, two eyes would be super useful in a fight…” Dean murmured as he cut his eyes toward Castiel.
Dean grumbled as he typed in another text and waved his credit card at Cas, who took it quickly. “My friend also wanted the apple pie.”
Dean swallowed and took the swig of whiskey she slid over the bar top to him, throwing it back before asking, “Is he…Is he here now?”
Dean attempted to stand, and Cas didn’t stop him. He shucked off his pants and underwear in one heap and crawled onto the end of the bed, smiling slyly. He ran his hands along Cas’ muscular thighs and smiled more as Cas parted them for him. His fingers traced gently into the softer flesh of his inner thigh and he ran his hands up to Cas’ knees. He leaned down and kissed his stomach, under the navel, feeling the soft trail of dark hair there brush his lips. Cas pulled his hand away from his dick and lifted his pelvis in silent request and Dean grinned as he looked up at him through his lashes. Cas may have been feeling cocky before, but with Dean between his legs offering him up his favorite thing, he was putty in his hands…and Dean loved it. He licked his lips, making sure Cas’ eyes were locked on him, and he was rewarded by seeing Cas’ breath hitch in his throat as he slid just the tip of his tongue out of his mouth and traced a wet line along his cock.
“You have both gone so far off the rails…” Mary murmured as she clenched her jaw, biting back more hurtful words.
Chuck lifted an eyebrow and one side of his mouth quirked up. “You really are a mouthy one…Wow. I never noticed before…” Chuck said as he circled Castiel. He tapped a pencil to his chin as he walked. “What do you think? Is that Sam and Dean’s influence or your own development of Free Will?”
Dean rolled his eyes and laid his head back against the headrest, giving a lazy grin as he did so, his hand stretching out to find Cas' and squeezing it gently. “Are you expecting a fight?”
Finally, the blinding sensation passed and Dean felt Cas slide his finger out, only to double down on sucking him off. He’d never seen anything more beautiful than Cas looking up at him with one raised eyebrow, satisfaction oozing from his features. As their eyes locked, he moaned as he felt his orgasm building low in his gut. Where the prostate orgasm was a full body experience, this one, the one he knew, started low inside him and built. Cas could sense the change because instead of pulling off like Dean expected him to, to avoid it, Castiel pumped him with his hand, staring transfixed.
Cas was already snapping his chest plate back into place as he entered the room. Dean walked up to him, but Cas kept his back to him and hung his head.
Castiel looked in Dean’s eyes, knowing more than Dean said. “That’s unsurprising considering how often they were hunting together before I left. I’m glad your mother has found happiness in this life again.”
“Sounds good, Sam, then tomorrow we can deal with your witch.” Jody popped Dean on the shoulder with a wink and followed him out the door.
nonplatonic way but I didn’t say anything because when I came back you seemed fine the way we were.”
“Hmm…. Perhaps. The other Angels won’t like that at all since you were the one assisting Metatron. It is probably best for you to continue to avoid interactions with any other Angels than me. I understand your motives behind working with Metatron, though misguided, were not to cause us to Fall. The other Angels are not so understanding….”
“I promise, truly…and Thank you, for everything.” As the door to the bunker closed with a ringing edge of finality, Castiel closed his eyes and sighed as he ran hand through his hair. It was if his own mask had finally been allowed to slip and he sunk into a chair as if his strings had been cut.
Dean let a half smile slip. “Shut up, Cas.” Castiel tilted his head to the side before Dean gripped his tie and pulled him in close. “I’ve been losing my damn mind, you know that? Wondering if you were okay, then you poof here and start talking…and talking…and talking. God, I missed that.” Castiel stiffened when Dean said God but he didn’t notice. Dean’s hands shook when he reached one up to touch his fingertips lightly to Cas’ face, as if he still wasn’t sure he was real. “I took you for granted, took for granted you’d always be around and we’d have time for…. you know, talking all this shit out. You do what you need to come back to me. You hear me? You get the chance to come home, you damn well come home. This…this thing we’ve been dancing around? I think I’m ready to stop dancing. This year has been Hell…and I’d known what Hell feels like. You hear what I’m saying?”
“Again!” Castiel barked out at the formational lines of Angels. They each had an Angel blade in their hand and were practicing blocking techniques. He’d had to temporarily retire his trench coat. The Angels needed to be able to see how he moved his body with each movement he taught them. The older Angels may have seen the coat as a joke, but they didn’t know it’s usefulness. Not only did it hold sentimental value to him, but it camouflaged his movements, which kept the enemy off balance and unable to predict his next move. It also made it much easier to conceal his Angel Blades…but for now it sat folded neatly on the dais. He walked around, his dress shirt untucked for the same reasons. He felt vulnerable but really had no choice. Sam and Dean would have laughed at him teaching fighting techniques in dress pants and a tie, but he had a harder time imagining having the Angels dress in human sparring clothing. He’d seen Dean and Sam spar more times than he could count, and the sleeveless shirts and loose pants helped them move more quickly but were unnecessary for Angels…but Castiel couldn’t help but be distracted by the image.
Dean slid his knee over to Cas' side of the bed and they jostled around for a comfortable leg position. “For how long I’ve wanted to do this, maybe
“Oh, go to Hell, Debriel,” Aberia barked back. Debriel laughed and playfully brushed her with his wings. “Nah, but the Commander’s been I hear. Like to actual Hell and back!” he added with excitement in his tone.
“I saw it in your eyes, Dean, not your mind.” Castiel laid back and peeled off his pants and underwear, leaving him bare now as well. He sat back on his haunches and hesitated. Dean had a satisfied smile as he saw Castiel breathing harder without them even touching.
They stretched out beside one another, only inches between them, and that alone was enough to make Dean feel like electricity was coursing through him. Cas had yet to touch him, as if he was holding back, and so Dean ever so tentatively brought his hand up to place it on his stubbled cheek and was rewarded with a soft, nervous smile. “I don’t know how to be this close to you, Cas.”
Cas felt a hunger he’d never felt and it had nothing to do with food. He’d had sex as a human and as an Angel but what he felt now was sheer, raw, need. This man made him feel such extreme emotions. Him being in charge of him as he transitioned to his human life might be a terrible mistake, but one Cas willing to make.
Dean grunted in pain and ground his teeth together, mustering a laugh through the haze of pain taking him over. “It really bothers you doesn’t it? You’re really hung up on us doing the whoopee. It’s kind of getting creepy at this point, I gotta be honest…” As Naomi glanced down at him, Castiel took another calculated step forward.
She wasn’t wrong, Castiel admitted to himself. He didn’t look forward to eternity missing his friends…his family…but he preferred it to never remembering they existed and the life he had with them. Remembering there was life outside of this sterile, cold place was all that kept him sane some days.
“You know as well as I do that you like the extra butter. No shame in your snack game, Cas. Own it.”
Naomi's hand was gripping visibly tighter to the Angel bade in her hand now and Cas knew the talk would soon transition to fighting. She only had so many words left to spew toward him. “You chose to fraternize with humans over your own kind. Humans! Violent chimps with advanced vocal patterns for Heaven’s sake!  You let the…you let HIM poison you against us. He is the snake that tempted you and took you from us. All you had to do was do as you were told like the rest of us!” Naomi hissed out her words in Dean’s direction, staggering one step forward toward Dean, but Castiel stepped in front of him as he continued to speak.
“Okay…” Dean growled out now, not feeling very at peace in the moment. “Why don’t you show me what you wanted to show me?” He all but pushed Cas out the front door into the sunlight, ignoring the soft peel of laughter Pamela left behind them.
The petite Angel looked like she wanted to argue but she shrugged and hovered her hand over Castiel’s swollen eye. When she laid her hand down, the swelling was all but gone and the cut was a faint red line. She stepped back and Debriel stepped forward.
As they settled on a leg position, Cas hummed in thought. “Hmm. I have to think about how I can top your present. Your birthday
“God has been in the design process for new Angels since he saw the dilemma Heaven was facing. He is away creating more Angels and should return with them in…well, I’m not sure how long it takes…”
“Well I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of that look in your eyes,” Dean said as he felt am involuntary shiver run down his spine.
Dean’s eyes widened. He had really not expected that explanation. Now he felt like an ass…Well, that wasn’t really a new feeling. He stepped closer to him, very much in his personal space now. “Cas…you were staying away from me…to..to
Sam laughed and leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms over his broad chest. “Yes, God forbid there be a dip in ruthless killings and disappearances.”
Dean let his relief flood through him, his head hitting the headrest as his eyes closed for a moment. A small smile found it’s way home on him. “I knew he’d find a way to let me know…So, he can communicate with you?”
Cas' face fell as he considered Dean's hesitance. “Dean…are you not interested in me if I’m not an Angel?” He quirked his head and frown lines formed on his face, concern flashing in his eyes now.
Dean rolled his eyes and stormed off to the bathroom, shutting the door harder than he needed to. Castiel stared at the flaking white painted door and frowned. This was not how he expected the drunken text he’d received to lead to. He should slip out now while Dean was occupied…but he couldn’t do that to him...nor did he want to in a selfish part of himself he kept buried deep. He walked away and opened the curtains to watch the encroaching thunderstorm, lightning flashing in the distance. His mind was everywhere and nowhere. He could feel the lonely feet between himself and Dean, who had apparently decided to take a shower as he heard the old pipes groan to life within the walls. Great. Just great. He had enough self-control issues with him fully clothed but to imagine him mere steps away, naked and…No. He was an Angel and Dean was human. It was their most sacred law…His mind raced with the possibilities. If he let himself feel these feelings deep inside of him that he’d fought for so, so long…would it put Dean and his family in danger? Would the Angels pursue them further or was it only the creation of a Nephilim that made it so forbidden? It wasn’t worth the risk. It truly wasn’t…but he could still feel the heat of Dean’s skin on his hands as if he’d been burned. He could feel his heart beginning to race under his palm, the feel of his tongue on his lips…No, his feelings for Dean were like nothing he’d experienced in his many many years of life. He felt as magnetically drawn to him as the tides to the shore and felt just as helpless to the pull of it. He let his mind wander, remembering every missed opportunity, every stolen glance, every almost moment they had ever had…and he watched the storm outside move closer and closer. Weren’t humans supposed to avoid bathing during lightning storms? Perhaps he should…
Mary took a step back and opened the driver's door, seeing a tan coat and belt slung to the front. “Where…where is the girl?”
“You did what you did to protect Sam, and you’ve already apologized ten times over. You can’t carry that guilt around forever. And it worked out in the end, didn’t it?” Cas spoke softly, and Dean could even note a change in his voice. That gravelly tone was still there, but softer. He was so much softer...so fragile.
Dean closed the door to his room and was only temporarily distracted as Cas dropped the sheet onto the concrete floor. Seeing Castiel so comfortably exposed to him made him feel a deep possessiveness. The scars on the Angel’s body didn’t mar the view but made him feel a deep burning in his gut to get him away from the toxic relationship he had with the other Angels. Castiel looked up from grabbing his pants that had been discarded on the floor and their eyes locked. Dean couldn’t deny he’d been staring but the self-satisfied look on Cas’ face wouldn’t have let him deny it if he wanted to. He crossed his arms over his chest and did a half smile as he shook his head. “Well, that could have gone worse I guess,” He added as he leaned against the bedroom door.
Sam took all of this in, every minute change confirming what Jack had suspected. “Son of a bitch… It is true, isn’t it? You and Cas….”
Dean’s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water for a few seconds while he tried to figure out his response. “Cas…I didn’t…I can’t help they hang on me in the bars.  I didn’t…” Dean stammered out before his face went red and he became the one with crossed arms and an angry glare. “Why the fuck do you care anyway? You stuck your tongue down my throat one damn time last week then ignored me the rest of it. Maybe I
Dean froze, a white t-shirt in hand, and looked momentarily concerned. Perhaps he had read things wrong, and in a matter of seconds his old insecurities rushed in to whisper doubt in his mind. “I mean, yeah, if that’s okay…”
“Well, what can we do while we wait?” Dean turned, hearing the odd inflection in Cas' tone, and narrowed his eyes in immediate suspicion. His tone dripped of false innocence. He caught Cas' eyes staring at him as he leaned over the tub. He didn't feel particularly sexy in his t-shirt and flannel pajama pants but by Cas' expression, you'd have thought he was parading around naked.
“I wouldn’t leave you, Dean,” Cas said as he swallowed hard, his hands shoved in the pockets of his coat, fists clenched again.
“Anything?” Dean asked hopefully to Sam as he leaned back and stretched, making the library chair squeak in protest, as if it too had been sitting too long
“Castiel…” Dean moaned as he turned to the window, seeing the storm outside intensify and the cheap windowpanes rattle again with the nearness of the storm. Cas slid a hand to where the hand-print he’d left years ago had been and he took the righteous man in every way a man could be taken. He had taken him from Hell’s clutches, taken him from Heaven’s plan, and now took him as his own. A last, glorious, blasphemy. A middle finger to Heaven, as Dean would say…
“Oh, I didn’t hurt him,” The Shadow said with a raised eyebrow as he rested his head in his hands and stared at Dean. “I did get this whole thing wrong though, didn’t I?” He said as he waved his hand back and forth between them.
They ate in the car, avoiding the large crowd of people shoved into the too small gas station/diner. Cas chewed thoughtfully on the chili cheese French fries Dean had insisted he order…and then stolen half of.
He’d waste hours arguing with Dean, and it was hard to argue when he knew Dean was right. Going alone was reckless and stupid. He would be glad for the company but taking Dean anywhere near the other Angels was a dangerous situation he would never willing put him in. Which was why he’d chosen to meet her late at night and try to avoid an argument. Well, it was a moot point now.
“Then why did you? It didn’t have to be you, Aberia," Cas said softly as he laid a hand on her shoulder, both their eyes studying the body below them.
“I didn’t know I was a biter either…” He said with a gravelly, deep, laugh as his hand moved to Dean’s pants. He quickly unsnapped the button of his jeans. Dean broke away and leaned back on the bed as Cas grabbed the end of his pants and whipped them off his legs. He threw the pants off the bed and leaned over him on his arms, smiling with all the possessiveness he felt in that moment.
. You gotta get over that, and if you think that way cause of me for some reason…well, I’m sorry. The past couple of years haven’t been my best, I admit. But, we’re okay, right?” Dean glanced over at him as they turned to the next aisle.
“I’ve never been in a hot tub. I’ve actually never even taken a bath. There were only showers at the shelter,” Castiel said matter of factly as he set aside his now empty Styrofoam take out box and took a deep swig of his refilled water bottle.
“Exactly right, Sam,” Castiel said quickly as he raised his head to rejoin the conversation. “So, I was safe from having to fulfill my end of the deal, however, the Shadow made it very clear that when I died as a Angel, my after life would be anything but peaceful. Angels, when they die, go to the Empty. Its simply how it is. However, it is supposed to be sleep. The Shadow wasn’t going to let me sleep...Every moment would be torture. So, my choices were to remain an Angel and be tortured by the Shadow when I die or choose to become human and have the chance to let my actions choose where I go when I die, as humans do.”
“But we’ll have to carry them down the spiral staircase…” Cas began to argue but Dean waved dismissively and loaded down one arm with bags while Cas carried the sweets.
“Oh,  no doubt…but it would have been worth it,” Dean said as he leaned up and brushed a kiss on the edge of Cas’ lips.
Castiel cocked his head to the side, considering Dean for a moment. “That is a very valid point,” and suddenly Dean was being shoved up against one of the bookcases, his hands sliding over the slick spines of the hardcovers. Cas’ tongue was in his mouth, his deft fingers already sliding under Dean’s t-shirt in search of warm skin. It took Dean’s brain a moment to catch up but moments later he was shucking Cas’ trench coat from his shoulders. He slid his hand down the silky expanse of his tie, yanking him closer to him with it as a leash.
That soft sentence was enough to make Dean shake off his own feelings and he spun around, his arms crossed over his chest. “OH, it was only for a second. I know. I was there, remember? Only dead for a second…” Dean grumbled as he stomped out of the room.
Dean was speechless a moment before laughing softly. “Damn that took me off guard. I had a whole argument ready. Well…. good. I’ll leave a note for Sam in case anything happens, and I’ll grab my shoes and my Angel blade.”
Sam shook his head slowly. “No, that doesn’t mean they are…a thing. They just have a really close friendship. They’ve been through a lot together. A lot I've missed.”
Cas ran his hand down the soft flesh of Dean’s stomach and gently stroked his fingers along his legs, his eyes finding a single-minded focus Dean hadn’t seen before. “This was worth waiting for…and I believe answering our earlier question about events repeating to be very important…right now.”
Sam leaned back and crossed his arms, a half smile forming on his face. “I’m not enjoying watching you grovel at all.”
“Dean.” That one word had Dean stupidly stepping further into the wooded area. He heard movement behind him and he whirled to see…. It wasn’t Cas. His heart fell in disappointment and raced with adrenaline at the same time. He was in danger. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up as he laid eyes on her. The woman had scraggly brown hair, hanging below her shoulders. It hung heavily, greasy and unwashed. Her eyes were deep-sunken and full of a rage he could relate to. Her face appeared pinched as if she hadn’t had a good meal in weeks.....Her mouth stretched wide, flashing rows and rows of teeth, a smile that made Dean step back.
“I think you’ve confused charm with arrogance, Commander,” Aberia said with a growl. The laughter from Cas that followed echoed down the bunker halls.
you want." Dean nodded against Cas’ shoulder and sat up, searching the room with his eyes and Cas caught on quickly enough. “There’s no need for any kind of prep... Not here.”
He hadn’t had a moment alone with Cas since everything went down, not with five angels crowded around him at all times. He eventually given it up and gone to his own bedroom last night, hoping that Cas would come to him when the work was done but when he awoke the next morning, it was clear his Angel had not come to him in the night.  He was further disappointed when he found Cas and Aberia talking softly in a corner of the library. It had taken Dean a bit by surprise when Castiel had pulled him aside and asked his permission to let Aberia stay with them a couple of weeks.
Chuck cleared his throat and stood, waving them both to sit down. “Come come now. Everyone have a seat.” Castiel took a hesitant step forward, allow Dean to finally see the other member of the dinner party.
“What a bitch…” Dean growled out as he pulled an extra chair beside the bed, careful to avoid stepping on the part of his wing that was draped across the floor.
Dean rolled his eyes and continued packing for him as he huffed out an exaggerated sigh. “Apparently everyone in the bunker has decided we are insufferable and unbearable with the heart eyes and have requested we leave for a few days and get away for a bit.”
Dean ran his hands through his hair and laughed lightly as he put the tape in with the other hand. “Yeah, I know. Sorry. I’m feeling a little off, I guess.”
Bobby sunk down in his comfy, worn recliner, his body radiating relief. “Oh, thank God. When I saw you here I thought…Wait.. Why ARE you here?” He said with suspicious eyes. “I barely got back in the good graces of the Angels the last time you needed my help.”
Naomi stopped short, letting out an angered breath. “I suppose we will leave this conversation for now…. but we will discuss this further Castiel. Eternity wandering the halls is going to get very lonely pining for a human you’ll never see again…” Naomi said with a raised eyebrow as she spun on her heal and stalked away.
Except he was here…somewhere…and once again not showing himself. The damned dick. Dean’s mind flashed to the last time they’d been together, how the lack of time had stolen any chance for a reply to Cas’ words…and maybe Cas didn’t want to be seen. Maybe he had mistaken Dean’s silence for disapproval. Maybe he thought Dean didn’t want to see him. Damn it. Where was that dorky little Angel? He closed his eyes a moment and thought about wanting to see him and when he opened them, there was a break in the trees lining the lonely highway and a gravel road turning off from it…leading to a tin roofed roadhouse with a few cars parked in front. Dean raised an eyebrow but quirked his mouth in a shrug of “Why not” and turned in, feeling the crunch of gravel under his tires, and watching plumes of dust puff up behind the Impala as he turned in. He put the car in park and took in the sight of it. It was the first building he’d seen since he started driving.
Castiel blinked sleepily, his eyes widening with surprise and grabbed up their phones. “Your assumption is correct.” He worked his way out of the bed, his legs wrapped up in the comforter, and rubbed his eyes.
“Not really true, but I just had to ask, cause you’ve been pretty, you know...standoffish since we got you back.” Dean turned and began to push the cart down the aisle again as Cas followed behind.
Castiel spent his days wandering the halls, visiting with Bobby, and avoiding the other Angels. He’d found the Heavens of their other friends and allies, but he hesitated to bother them. He knew Bobby was awake enough to know he was in Heaven. He knew what happened when people who didn’t know they were dead found out they were. It did not always go well, and he would not bring that pain upon their friends. Cas had even found Dean and Sam’s heavens. He’d laughed to himself at the death dates on the doors. There were very few in all the numbers of heaven that had multiple plaques with multiple death dates on them. His hand slid softly along their names. This feeling in his gut would go away eventually, right? The more time he spent in Heaven, he’d once again become more of the Angel he had been, right?
“Castiel, their futures were already written before you intervened. They’d have fought as Micheal and Lucifer. They’d have burned this world the ground, and Sam and Dean as you know them would have ceased to be. Do you really not understand what you did? Has no one ever explained? You’re breaking with the Angels to help them, it saved the world Castiel. Sam and Dean could not have won without you. Now then, are we going to design Angels or what? The sooner we get this done, the sooner I send you home to the Winchesters.”
“Everything?” Dean said with a smirk. “You have no idea what sacrifice is. Talk to me after you've died...more than once.”
Castiel leaned his head against his pillow and latched onto Mary’s question to avoid further discussion about the previous topic. “Chuck is currently not in Heaven. He’s off doing…whatever it is he does..to create more Angels. It’s quite a long process.  He has been gone since before I returned to Heaven from my last visit, hence why Naomi sent others to retrieve me. She was cool but cordial since then until today, when she requested me to come to her office. I knew then it was a set up. She ordered me to bring Jack to Heaven. I refused, and when she insisted and I again refused, she handcuffed me and they brought me before the new Choir of Angels as a show of force and a lesson in the consequences of disobedience. She made sure to announce to the entire assemblage that I was singlehandedly responsible for the shortage of Angels. Then she proceeded to become quite violent…”
“I’m afraid not. Tanira and Badriel, please hold his arms.” Naomi came forward as the other two stepped forward and grabbed him roughly by the arms. Naomi shoved the trench coat aside and roughly pulled his white dress shirt up before laying a hand on his anti-tracking tattoo. Castiel locked eyes with Naomi and refused to give her the satisfaction of hearing him scream, so he ground his teeth in pain as she burned the tattoo from his skin. He could have fought but he knew if he killed the other Angels he would absolutely be trapped here or killed. He would stay alive for those he'd left behind, and he let Naomi see it in his eyes.
Naomi put a hand to her chest in mock offense. “You wound me, Castiel.  I thought we were past this after all that ugliness with The Empty and Jack. I did tell you we appreciated your sacrifice, even if you didn’t do it for Heaven…” Naomi trailed off as she lifted an eyebrow and acknowledged Dean for the first time. Dean looked over at Cas then, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
He sighed. “I do trust you.” He looked to his family and he swallowed hard and closed his eyes. “And I love you and you damn well know it. Now, please open the door, Cas. I’m sorry for being a stupid idiot.” The three spectators’ eyes were wide at Dean’s heartfelt declaration. They’d known the obvious but hearing him say it so openly was very much not typical Dean behavior.
Castiel’s shoulders rolled in in such a way that Dean could guess that would have tucked his wings closer to him…if they weren’t so damaged. “Dean, I’ve lived without wings for years. I can do it again if necessary.”
Castiel laughed and it took Dean off guard. He wasn’t sure how to feel until Cas put a hand on his thigh and squeezed. “Of course, I’ll move my things into your room, you ass. Now get back to the hotel room. I feel another need arising.” Dean first looked with concern until he saw the look in Cas’ eyes and felt his hand drift over the bulge in his jeans and away from his thigh.
Dean grimaced and sighed as he stood up to get fresh coffee. “It’s true. In general, our lives are pretty miserable. Blood, guts, death, a laugh a minute.”
“No big deal,” Dean mumbled, his own cheeks pinker than Cas would have expected. They both turned away until Dean gasped. “Dude! Mr. List forgot to write down coffee. We were getting low last week. Sam’s got a death wish. You know how I get without my coffee.”
Dean sighed loudly as he fiddled with the knobs of the radio. “Yeah, yeah. Jack said Angel Radio is pretty quiet, but not static…So Yeah, Cas must be okay.”
Castiel tilted his head to the side and lowered his eyes in a small fit of embarrassment. “Dean, I don’t sleep. I have to find something to occupy my time. The internet is quite the educational place.”
Instead, he shook his head and smiled. “Don’t be stupid. It’s 2am. Only people out right now are crooks and monsters. You’re sleep schedule’s gonna be a bitch, but I’m fine. I actually had a thought about how to help your aches and pains….” He shot a look to the hot tub and Castiel followed his eyes and his own widened.
“I don’t have to…?” Dean’s face burned in embarrassment intermingled with wanton need and Cas’ reassuring head shake made him release the shaky breath he’d been holding. He moved his hands to hook Cas’ legs up by the thigh as it drug his head down off the pillow, hesitantly lining himself up with Cas’ entrance. He was hard and ready as he looked down at him. They locked eyes and Cas’ heavy-lidded ones fluttered as Dean sheathed himself inside of him, slowly, wanting to trust what Cas had said but hesitant. He met no resistance, only a tight heat he thought might be the second death of him. Cas, body relaxed and trusting in him, whimpered softly in the back of his throat, a sound that flared a deep possession in him. He felt himself trembling as he looked down at them joined together, Cas' dick pressed between their stomachs.
“I guess with two in the bed, you can watch my back. I should have taken you up on that offer to watch over me when I slept sooner,” Dean said as he yawned and stretched his arms above his head.
3/17/19 Due to computer issues, new chapter will be up Monday or Tuesday. Sorry for the inconvenience guys.
Cas looked over and Dean fondly took a mental image of the wind gently blowing the dark strands of hair off his forehead and the sunrise casting brilliant shades of pink and gold across his features. When Cas looked over and smiled softly, excitement and adventure sparkling in his eyes, Dean felt the first taste of freedom on the wind. “It looks good on you, Cas.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? You made me cum so hard I thought I’d died for a minute…and you know, I kind of, you know….love you too, so there’s that…” Dean grumbled softly as he buried his nose in Castiel’s neck, leaving small kisses against his skin. “Sorry it took me so long to say it back…”
The Angels plan their return to Heaven and Cas and Dean must decide to do with their first tastes of freedom

I'm so sorry for leaving this story hanging for so very long. Life, depression, and an insane work schedule are the only excuses I can give. This chapter isn't long but it was all I had time to edit today. I have the entirety of the story written out with just some editing needed. I promise I will get another chapter out by the end of the week. I never wanted to abandon this work and I've been determined to get back to it. I apologize to you that subscribed to this expecting regular updates. I still love you guys!
Bobby rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Okay, Cas. If you say so. Say, aren’t you gonna to get in trouble for coming here? Shouldn’t you be off doing Angel stuff?”
“Hmmm. Should have known after the pizza man incident you’d be looking into that more,” Dean said with a humored smirk as he ran his hand down Cas’ back. “I can show you my collection some time if you’d like. We could watch it together…”
“Dean, It’s Cas. You know him better than anyone. More so now…okay, no. Not going there,” Sam shuddered and wrinkled his nose. “You’re just gonna have to get through to him like you always have, minus violence or spells. You're the one who can always get through to him. You two speak your own language.”
“He’s…. Cas is the commander?” Dean voiced aloud as everyone together took a greater interest in the black winged Angel who seemed to have a much larger portion of demons than anyone else. Dean had felt a familiarity in the way he moved….but to think that was Cas?
Naomi bristled at that, all but vibrating in outrage. “Shut up! If you won’t shut up, Ill just have to make you…” Naomi growled out and she went to slide the blade across Dean’s neck.
“Cas…” Dean said as he went to put a hand on his right shoulder but Cas turned around too quickly. His face was a mix of emotions. Dean knew him well enough to see anger, sadness, and fear. He understood those too. Castiel’s eyes were wild as he spoke.
“If you like your humans scarred and screwed up,” Dean said with a shake of his head but Cas raised an eyebrow, making a face that made something low tighten inside him.
“Being bored has never been something I’ve been lucky enough to experience. You rest. I’ll be content,” Castiel said softly as he picked up his duffle and began hanging everything in the closet.
Cas’ temper was beginning to fray but he endeavored to control it considering his audience. “Can’t be a winner? She literally drilled holes in my brain to make me toe the line…not just me! Countless others, and where were you during that? Where have you been for all of this?”
“Hey there, good lookin. What can I get for you?” Pamela said as she walked up slowly from behind the bar, her hands tucked in the pocket of her jeans.
“Sometimes people lie to make others look better, even when they don't deserve it. It's not your fault, kid.” Dean huffed out as he stared daggers at the closed bedroom door.
“Sorry, I got distracted for a second…” Dean then moved his hand to Cas’ inner thigh, rubbing gentle circles that made Cas stifle a whine that left Dean squirming just as much. “You really feel it like I do, don’t you? I never…I thought you wouldn’t want it…want this...as much, being an Angel and all.”
Castiel studied her face and followed her logic, finishing her thought. “As opposed to living in Heaven?”
do this…but that was him still thinking like he used to. He’d had to talk himself out of embarrassing himself with Cas so many times when he was alive. So many times he’d almost, wanted to, thought about it, almost said the words…but never let himself go that far for fear of Cas not feeling the same, and fear of what those closest to him might think…but that was behind them. The times of miscommunication and fear were over…so why did Dean feel so
“Not alone you’re not,” Dean said, all but forgetting his family waiting impatiently in the other room. Castiel gave him a look that he was sure many a demon had seen right before they died. He cleared this throat and shoved his hands in his pockets. “What I meant to say was, I’m sure we could all use some breakfast. We could come with you.”
“Oh, you know I never agreed with it, but you and I both knew it was temporary. She always was a bit too much…” Dean raised an eyebrow at his understatement as he lifted the back of Cas’ shirt to confirm the tracking sigil was gone. Castiel looked over his shoulder and Dean nodded as he let his shirt fall back into place. “Now, for the slightly trickier part…” Chuck cracked his knuckles and looked around him. “Now might be a good time to mention I’ve never actually removed Grace before…”
Mary sighed as she laid her towel on the sink vanity and crossed her arms over her flannel. “I still can’t believe that witch had Angel proofing. Damned inconvenient to have such a useful tool like an Angel in your arsenal and not be able to use it.”
Castiel chuckled and Dean felt it vibrate down to his core. He groaned like he’d been punched then felt Cas’ finger sliding into him. The sensation was a relatively new one for him, though he teased himself this way in the shower sometimes when he was alone. He froze, fear creeping in, when Castiel slid his finger tip inside, feeling for that nub, that special place inside of him. Oh…oh there it was. Dean cried out as Castiel flicked across it while continuing to blow him with his surprisingly talented mouth. It wasn’t going to take much to push him over the edge but Castiel was damn well going to do it. His body was alternating thrusting forward into that hot mouth and riding back on the finger that was bringing him white hot pleasure. Shit, how did he even know how to do this?
“Sam, Cas and Dean aren’t in the roo-“ Mary began as she opened the door but Jody and Claire were already there waiting.
“That is a correct statement,” Aberia mumbled as she stumbled back, gasping for breath as another Angel slid a chair under her. She sagged against the back of the chair, her face pale.
Castiel was thankful they’d installed an alarm system that didn’t require a key. Just a fingerprint and a code. To be fair, he’d still had to wipe his bloodied hands on his shirt before it would accept it, but at least he didn’t have to worry about picking a lock. He stumbled down the stairs alone, his wings dragging behind him, too damaged to be put away in the other plane, and his grace too low to even attempt to heal them. He winced as one of the feathers, bent out of shape, snagged on one of the stairs.
Cas raised an eyebrow and walked closer to him, peering into the duffel with concern. “I mean, it wouldn’t be the first time for me, but why?”
“This is all very interesting, but shouldn’t we be focused on healing the commander in case of such circumstances? We’ve all rested. We need to continue…” the small statured angel looked at the humans and gestured for them to leave.
‘I’m sure we’ll all stumble into somewhere soft to sleep when we’re ready,” Donna added as she took a sip from her cup.
“What? You’re driving me crazy. What is it?” Dean said loudly as he dropped his fork on his now empty plate, the clatter sounding thunderous in the silence. Everyone’s eyes were drawn to Dean then. Most had been oblivious to Aberia’s scrutinous stare.
“Well, I had to know you would come. We both know Heaven isn’t your priority, now is it? Some of us still believe in serving our true purpose,” Naomi said with disdain evident in her tone, her hands clasped in front of her.
Dean let out a breath and put an arm behind his head to prop himself up slightly. “That’s not what my dad thought. He thought relationships were distractions. He said we needed to be focused on the work.”
Dean saw his frown and dropped his hands, laughing harder than he had in years. “It fucking is! This is all so goddamn ridiculous. You, with your blue eyes and your hair and you stupid tie and your fucking perfect things you say and this house and sacrificing yourself to save me only for me to get fucking impaled in a vamp fight, and being kind of okay with going because I hoped I’d see your stupid, goddamn OBLIVIOUS face again and after everything, after all of that, I can’t fucking SAY IT!” Cas tilted his head in confusion and Dean stormed over and pressed both his palms to Cas’ face. “You said I didn’t need walls to protect me anymore, right?”
“No…you all have a right to know…” Castiel said as he studied his wounds and looked around the corner. He stopped and turned to the assemblage. “If you leave with me, you may very well not be allowed to return. What Naomi said was true…but everything I did was to protect all the people of Earth…not just the Winchesters. The Angels wanted to start the apocalypse early because they were tired of running Heaven with nothing else to do…It was selfish, short sighted, and they were working in tandem with Hell to make it happen. My Winchesters were pawns in their game…and Dean made me see what they were doing was wrong. I did things I regret…but I did them for the right reasons. The humans…they don’t deserve to suffer because of us. They suffer enough for what they do to each other…Now, I know the way to the portal. None of you need return with me. Heaven is going to need you in the aftermath of this..." Cas made the effort to grasp Debriel's hand in a gesture of thanks and attempted to turn to head away on his own but he stumbled, his ragged wings leaving an obvious trail of blood behind him with every painful step.
Dean pushed away from the door and scooped up the discarded sheet, tossing it haphazardly onto the bed they'd left a wreck from the night before. “The kid seems to be pretty good at deescalating things. It seems to be hard for anyone not to like him,” Dean added with a laugh as he went to his dresser to pull out a soft, heather grey Henley. He pulled it over his head with his back to Cas. After he tugged on the hem to let it sit just so, he leaned against the dresser, glancing in the mirror it held. His fingers bit into the wood as Castiel stared into his reflection. Dean’s eyes flitted away to study the ancient dresser top’s lightly marred surface, the scratches and dents proof of years of use before their arrival. Dean sighed and screwed his eyes shut, willing the words out that he didn't want to say. “Look, we both know you have to leave today. There’s no sense getting yourself in deeper by making Aberia pissed.”
“The commander will be angry you’ve removed your helmet…” spoke the other Angel loud enough for Dean to hear. He was peering around the cream and gold feathers, trying desperately to see the battle.
“Bossy...” Dean said as he licked his lips again before kissing the head of Cas’ cock. He slid the tip into his mouth and slowly worked his way to make it spit slick, holding Cas’ trembling thighs apart with his broad hands and stealing glances up to make sure they weren’t about to be covered in shattered glass. Cas had his fist held up to his lips and was biting down on his knuckle, and Dean felt his own dick jump at the sight, laying swollen and sensitive between his legs, pressed against the mattress. He slowly worked to bottom out, feeling Cas’ cock fill his throat and he breathed slowly through his nose, working through his gag reflex. He heard Cas swear under his breath as he deepthroated him and his brain went fuzzy as it always did when he drug such filthy noises out of his Angel. His Angel, he thought with rabid possession as he slid up and back down quickly before pulling off and nipping at Cas’ thighs. He felt Cas grip his hair tight enough that he gasped out in combined pleasure and pain before Cas pushed him back down, making Dean’s brain fuzz up again as he did as Cas was asking and took him back in his mouth. God, he loved when he got forceful about what felt good to him. It had been a rocky road to that, and Dean still found it so sexy when he could wrestle out of Cas what made him feel good….and this, this was his favorite.
“Dean! Took you long enough!” came the combined voices of Ellen and Jo and Dean was swamped in a hug from Ash as he came from beside him.
Dean smiled but quickly scrubbed his face with his palm and it was gone when he dropped it. “Don’t worry about that. So, did you pick up what she was putting down?”
And Castiel and Dean knew none of it as they lay together, lost only in the freedom of loving one another. Despite them all.
As they headed to the grocery store, Cas glanced at Sam’s neatly written grocery list with curiosity. “This is a very long list. How long is Eileen staying?”
“You really didn’t think the idea of you in bed with me every morning would get to me? That’s the one thing that I’ve been denied and wanted so, very badly for so very long…” Castiel murmured out against the skin of Dean’s collarbone as he pulled the neckline aside before frustratedly pulling it above Dean’s head. He frowned when Dean pulled away, until Dean grabbed him by the waistband and pulled him toward the bedroom, walking backwards.
“The Hell you can’t. A year, Cas!” Dean hissed out. Cas heard Mary and Bobby coming and knew his time would be up sooner than he’d like with nothing to show for it, other than Dean being alive of course. He threw his hand over Dean’s mouth and pushed him against the tree again.
phone began to ring now, but where he’d left it, safely on the passenger seat to avoid awkward butt dials, it was now muffled by Cas’ coat and the sound was lost to the squeak of the leather and Dean’s pleasured groans. “Mm, nhh, faster Angel. Yeah, ohh fuck.” Cas gripped the side of his pants and tugged with his inhuman strength, leaving them around his thighs, giving him more room to move his stroking hand before he move his free hand to take a grip on Dean's asscheek through his underwear.
“We do not want to shed anyone’s blood, except yours. Young ones,” Naomi turned her gaze to the other Angels behind Castiel now. “Please. Do not let him lead you to your deaths as he has done so many others. You can still walk away from this. From him.” She turned her eyes to meet those she spoke to but none of them budged as their faces remained devoid of emotion. Naomi waited a moment, expecting some movement from someone, but seeing none, she huffed and her jaw flexed in irritation. “Fine. Have it your way…” She held her arm up and the Angels around her gripped their angel blades more tightly. The Angels surrounding Castiel followed a similar motion and Cas stepped one step closer to Dean subconsciously.
Sam sat a moment, thinking to himself before bringing up something he knew Dean would not want to discuss. “So, Jack can still hear Angel Radio…do you think his powers are coming back a little or he’s using the soul magic to...”
“A gunshot wound to the stomach never could keep me down for long. I'm just sorry it took all my Grace to heal it for a while,” Cas said softly as he ran his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip before Dean grabbed his wrist and slid his thumb into his warm, wet mouth. Cas laid his head back and watched him through possessive, heavy-lidded eyes as he sucked his thumb like it was a very different part of his anatomy. “If you really want something in your mouth, Dean, I have a much better idea…”
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t wait another breath. I’ve missed you. It’s been so long…. I….If you’ve changed your mind…” Cas began, insecurity finally seeping in as he went to put a bit of distance between them.
“Look, Sam, I get why you’re concerned. It is really open-ended when Cas can come back, but it’s what I’ve got to hold onto right now, and I’m going to take it. Yeah, it might disappoint me in the end. I’m not stupid, but it’s what I’ve got, and I’m willing to take that risk.” The room was silent a moment while Sam truly absorbed Dean’s words.
Dean slid him out of his mouth, gave an apologetic smile and turned toward the night stand that he’d left his phone on. He glanced down at the familiar number. “Jack? Everything okay?” Castiel tensed behind him, waiting for news. He watched Dean’s shoulders relax and without hearing the other end of the conversation he knew everything was okay. He stretched out his legs and leaned back on the pillows behind him, admiring the view of Dean lying on his stomach with the phone cradled to his ear. “Okay, get a piece of paper and I’ll give you all the streaming passwords. Never delete site data unless you know all your passwords….and I’m not gonna ask who was looking at what to delete all the cookies and history. Just not on my laptop, kid.”
He stormed toward the door and Mary followed at his heels, refusing to let him go in alone. She reached for the knob, but Dean reared back and kicked the door in, all subtlety be damned. There was a lone light illuminating the ramshackle cabin. It buzzed in protest as a moth batted against it’s dimming light.  The room was quiet. Mary stood back to back with Dean as they turned in a circle. Suddenly out of the darkness, a humanoid shape swooped in, its pearlescent white teeth shining in the darkness.  It’s mouth unhinged in a twisted smile, revealing rows and rows of teeth.
Dean had passed out an hour ago. He had fought it as long as he could, and Castiel had assured him it would be fine to just go to sleep, but he knew their time was limited. After they’d made love they’d whispered softly into the very early morning hours. Dean’s head rested on Cas’ left arm and Cas’ free arm was thrown over Dean’s side, slowly drifting up and down his back with his fingertips. Castiel could not remember ever being this content and relaxed. It didn’t matter, though. In all too soon a time, he’d have to leave. He stared at Dean’s restful face, enjoying seeing the hard lines of his face fall away in sleep. Cas had thrown the sheet over them both as best he could, but it was bunched up around their waists, tucked and twisted in the jumble of their limbs. He laid there listening to Dean breath, feeling his heart beating steady and sure, until he lost track of time. His mind was all but shut down to everything except the sound of Dean.
“Oh, those are just stories,” she said as she crossed her arms across her metal clad chest clumsily.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, a smile coming to his lips despite the annoyance visible in his eyes. Dean quickly closed the space between them and wrapped him in a hard hug that Cas slowly brought his arms up to reciprocate. Dean could feel the hesitance in his touch and nervousness pooled in his gut again.
one answered?” Jody asked in genuine concern now. “Come on. Let’s see if the car is here. If it’s gone, maybe they-“
Dean shrugged and smiled apologetically. “Oh, uh, mom doesn’t know. About any of it. Cas, or the almost dying part. Anyway, …he said there is something happening in Heaven and he may be able to come home someday…”Dean mumbled toward the end, realizing how open-ended and vague it seemed when he said it out loud.
DeN leaned in a tired, happy smile on his face. “Wasn’t just me, but you’re welcome. You deserve it. Hey, wait. I’ll be right back," and like that Dean was shuffling back to the War Room.
Again, silence filled the car but this time it felt different. Cas had laid his sexuality out for Dean to reject…and he hadn’t. He’d been overwhelmingly accepting…and admitted he was attracted to men too…The atmosphere in the car was interesting as they made their way back to the bunker.
“I understand. I am very glad to see you too, all of you. This has been a wonderful evening. I….I wish I did not have to go back.” Castiel looked around him and he reveled in the familiarity, the family. He couldn’t express how it felt to be able to put his metaphorical and physical armor down and just be himself.
Immediately, Castiel tried to shut down the worry and emotion obviously painted on his face, trying to find the right balance in the moment. He cleared his throat unnecessarily as he braced for Dean's reaction.  “I’m not wearing the chest piece today, Dean. You are.”
“I’m doing my job, like everyone else,” Dean said with a tone that implied he’d repeated this line numerous times.
“You did good, Cas…” Dean said with emotion in his voice as he hit his knuckles on one of the tables and brushed his sleeve across his eyes. Why did he keep almost crying today? “You really did. You and Jack.”
“Try me. You trust me?” Dean's hand brushed Cas' as they say so closely together and Cas glanced down at the sensation.
“That is a weird compliment, but I’ll take it. Okay…so now my entire family knows we did…” Dean gestured between himself and Cas, unable to say the words but knowing he would understand. “Except maybe Jack. Not it on that conversation, by the way.”
“You’re sure it’s a demon?” Mary asked as they spoke outside the warehouse. The towering building with it's cracked and boarded up windows cast an eerie shadow over the group.
Naomi lowered her voice barely above a whisper. “Castiel, you realize if your wings continue to heal, you will be the only Angel left with the ability to fly…. That would make you almost as powerful as me….”
Dean found himself an active participant, moving with every thrust. He surprised himself by moving to deepen the thrusts. He wanted deeper, closer, faster. He’d been unsurprised that he’d enjoyed doing this to Cas. He’d always enjoyed sex, but he’d been unsure if he could do this. It wasn’t some macho thing. He’d simply worried he wouldn’t like it. Oh, how wrong he’d been. There was a small bit of pain along with it, but that apparently wasn’t a problem. His brain swirled with pleasure and pain as Cas was a comforting pressure at his back. He’d never had sex this way. This was far too intimate for one-night stands. This was almost too intimate for him now. Cas could feel every tremor, his racing heart, his deep moans unable to be hidden when his mouth was against his partner’s ear. This felt almost worshipful and he damn well didn’t deserve it. As if Cas could hear him, he held him more tightly against him, changing the movement to longer, smooth strokes and he kissed his sweat dewed neck. Dean hooked his leg behind Cas’, leaving Cas' left hand free to grip his dick. He could feel himself getting closer to his own orgasm and he stroked him to get him there as well. He moaned loudly again when Dean grinded against him with enthusiasm in response.
“I know, Dean. I get it,” Castiel sat down beside him, trying to pretend Chuck wasn’t there. “I’ve never gotten to choose this, and you weren’t there the last time.” Castiel held up his hand as Dean began to argue. “I told you before I understood why you kicked me out, Dean. You do not have to continue to defend it, but I have a right to say that it hurt me. Your family is all that I have should I choose this, and that is terrifying to me after last time. I could choose the Heaven option, spend the rest of eternity training Angels and serving as the head of the Angelic forces, quell demonic uprisings, fight Heavenly battles…I did it for centuries, millenia. But I was never, not once genuinely happy until I met you. Naomi stated many times I never truly did as I was told. I never truly fit in. I never truly belonged there…. but living on Earth as an Angel, I still don’t truly belong. I am not fully committed to any one life, and this could all be taken away from me if another group of Angels takes over and decides that all Angels remaining on Earth must return to Heaven…I would never truly be free. Ever….” Dean sighed and shyly picked up Cas’ hand. Castiel squeezed it and continued. “If I am lucky enough to spend the rest of my days hunting on Earth as a human…that is the most freedom I will ever have had. Think…no more Angel Radio...no one able to track me by my Grace….”
“Now that wasn’t so bad, was it?” She said with a small smile on her face. Castiel could see the satisfaction behind her eyes. She liked to cause pain. “Now I’m afraid the tracking sigil itself will be a bit more uncomfortable. Duma, remove his coat please.”
“You might be right,” Dean said softly before his eyes lit on the stack of presents. “Did you ever look in your journal?” He was already up and grabbing it before Cas could answer in the negative. “I didn’t want to be sappy in front of everyone.”
“I’m sorry I’ve been gone so long, Jack.  I never wanted this….” Cas said soothingly before Jack released him from the hug. “Let me take you all home. You are quite a way form the bunker. My way Is much faster….”
Dean and the others have another interesting hunt and begin to notice a disturbing trend, while Castiel finds a way to reach out.
With Angels back in the picture, the WInchesters find themselves with little to do. Meanwhile, Cas waits for Naomi's next inevitable move.
“The as of yet unfinished basement. It has what I would describe as an obscenely large television, surround sound, a mini bar, a Foosball table and all the streaming networks. You can’t imagine how happy everyone was when we got Netflix.” Dean shook his head at the absurdity of it all and smiled as he navigated the open floor plan to walk into the kitchen.
"Oh no, Dean. My motives are purely selfish," Cas growled out as he leaned down and kissed his stomach, looking up at him with renewed hunger.
“They’re missing?” Jody said immediately as she picked up on Mary’s words, checking herself for her gun even before getting confirmation.
Cas went to take a step forward but Dean laid a steady hand on his shoulder, holding him back without strain. Cas ruffled his feathers and leveled a heavy gaze on the offending Angel. “Then I will add you to the lengthy list of Angels I killed who also refused to take their drama off this planet.”
business. Here, and your receipt. Thank you, and sorry if I put him in a mood. Let him know I really was only joking, not flirting.”
They were surrounded by old oak trees on a small dirt path. The weather was perfect, warm with a soft breeze making the dandelions he saw blow softly. He could hear bird song and the occasional soft buzz of a non-blood sucking insect nearby. He looked around him more and there were what appeared to be fruit trees on his left, heavy with picture perfect apples and pears, and a structure, a house, could be viewed in the gap of tree down the road.
Castiel and Aberia stared one another down for what felt like eternity but was more like twenty seconds, until Jack suddenly walked up the stairs with purpose. Castiel turned his head to speak but Jack stood next to him, shoulder to shoulder, smiling in such a charming way as to stop two Angels from arguing.
Castiel’s face was a mass of conflicted emotion and it made Dean feel as if he had swallowed a stone and it was settled deep in his gut. “I would want nothing more than to spend some alone time with you Dean..”
“Being condemned to Earth, living as neither truly human nor truly Angel, never feeling the freedom to fly when one has touched the stars themselves, my true form confined to this small, limited body, being denied human pleasures while feeling the want of those experiences…tell me, what else would one call such a life, other than Hell?”
“Wait…” Dean looked back at the bar and frowned. “Wait. This is…You made this for me? This is mine?”
“But it’s for science, Cas,” Dean said with a smile as he moved his mouth to his neck. “Got to find all the sensitive spots you’ve been hiding from me when you were an Angel.” Cas exposed his neck to Dean’s soft lips and murmured words in Enochian Dean was fairly sure were swear words. He was prepared to make him say a lot more but as he was kissing along his neck, Castiel yawned into the pillow. Dean froze, feeling only mildly insulted.
Dean forgot what he’d been so flustered about and nodded solemnly. “I will. I mean…this won’t be forever, right?” Dean looked up at Naomi then, panic suddenly in his eyes. “It won’t will it?”
“And if what that one in there said was true, we’re going to be dealing with a lot more of them in the days to come…” Mary added in the back. She cared for Castiel but she knew the moment before was for the boys.
Mary knocked on the hotel room door. Nothing. She knocked again, louder, as her impatience and nervous energy manifested. Speaking through the door, she let her voice carry. “Dean. Castiel. It’s me. I was checking on you since it’s been a minute…” Still nothing. She pressed her ear to the door and silence was her only answer. She hummed in question and picked up her phone. Still no responses from her text message from five minutes ago. “Where the
Dean shook his head, lowering his body onto Cas. “If we do this and you don’t come back home again..”
“I’m an Angel, you idiot. Bullets don’t hurt me,” Naomi said with a smug smile as she wrenched Dean's arm again.
“If Handriel has something to say, she has my permission to say it,” Castiel said as he raised an eyebrow calmly but the other Angels in the room took a step back, sensing the false calm by the set of his wings and the timbre of his voice. The growl all but made the room itself tremble. No one would ever know he agreed with Handriel...in his own way. She saw the humans as weak, and in that she was wrong. However, he was sure Dean at least would be targeted quickly. His mind raced with every possible way this day could go wrong, even as he stood defending his family being here...even while he wanted them nowhere near the battle when it began. Emotions were a complicated matter.
"What's her deal?" Dean turned to ask as they watched her go to Kaia and whisper in her air. Kaia looked over at them and shook her head before Claire leaned over and kissed her cheek and slid a hand around her waist and pulled her to sit down.
“Your face tells me you have a few ideas…but really, is that a good idea right now?" Dean crouched as he watched the water fill the hot tub quickly and he looked back to Cas...who looked positively heartbroken. Dean quickly shut off the water and stood, wrapping him in his arms immediately. "I didn't mean anything by it. I just meant you're already sore and super overstimulated..." Dean murmured softly in his ear as Cas stood somewhat stiffly, his chin dug into his shoulder.
Dean huffed and crossed his arms as he leaned back in the chair he’d pulled to the side of the bed. “Then continue on. I’m not stopping you…”
“Where did Dean and Castiel go?” Mary asked as she came out of the shower donning fresh clothes and scrubbing her damp hair with the hotel towel.
“They’re having all the fun,” sulked Aberia and Dean almost felt sorry for her. She was pouting like a teenager not allowed to go out on Friday night. By this time, the two Angels were so enamored with watching the battle that Sam, Jack, and Mary had wormed their way up to join Dean in watching.
“That is one of the easier questions I can answer. I never fell, not in the same way the rest of the Angels did when Metatron’s spell was enacted. I was essentially human when the Angels fell, so I had no wings to be destroyed. When I received my Grace back, my wings were restored, but damaged beyond use due to Metatron’s mistreatment of my grace for his spell, and the fact that there was so little of it remaining.”
"How am I suddenly the responsible one?" Dean said with an attempt at humor even as he felt his argument running dry in his throat. When Cas mashed their mouths together, messy and desperate, he caved completely. He slid his hands possessively along the curve of Cas' ass and felt a desperation of his own growing. He nipped at his ear and Cas’ knees almost went out from under him. Dean quickly caught him and walked him over to the bed, even as Cas apologized. “Sorry…I’m easily overwhelmed right now…Maybe you’re right that it’s not the best idea…” Cas was breathless, his pupils blown to comical proportions...and all Dean could think in the moment was that he wanted to claim this soft human Cas as his. His only. It was very primitive thinking, but his brain was sharing blood with another part of his anatomy and he couldn't help it. That was his story and he was sticking to it.
Dean laid the menu down on the dresser to his left and toed off his shoes. “Nah, let’s get unpacked first. I’m still good from the snack stop we had when we got gas. Sam dragged my ass out of bed so early, I might just like to watch some tv for a bit….unless you want to go do something? I don’t want you to be bored.”
Dean grinned and felt his face redden. “Almost as much” You sweet talker you…” he wrapped the tie around his fist and pulled Castiel in for a kiss. It was soft and hesitant at first, their lips trying to remember their last stolen moment. Cas rutted up against Dean, his hands sliding up his back, and Dean groaned. “You really do like a good battle, don’t you? Duly noted…” He nipped at Castiel’s neck, which made the Angel dig his nails into the small of Dean’s back and the kiss became one of desperation and urgency. Cas’ hand slid up to cup the base of Dean’s head, his fingers sliding through his hair.
It wasn’t an hour later that Dean, Sam, and Jack were in the Impala, the windows down and wind whistling past them as they hit the highway. Jack sat in Cas’ typical spot in the middle of the backseat, which put a small pang in the pit of Dean’s stomach. He loved Jack, but he felt like they’d just moved on to a different Angel. Of course, he knew that wasn’t true, more so for him than anyone else, but it didn’t feel right.
"We gotta make time for that later," Dean groaned out. "A handy doesn't compare to-ahh, ah," Dean moaned as Cas changed his grip and slipped a finger down to fondle him lower.
“Love you too,” Dean said, his voice shaking only slightly. The intimacy made him shudder and he buried his face in Cas’ shoulder, sighing as Cas ran his hand along his spine. He rolled to the side, bringing him with him as he found his lips. Dean lazily ran his hand along the length of him, smiling as he felt him shudder under his fingertips again. He softly parted Cas’ lips with his, running his tongue along his lower lip, coaxing Cas’ tongue to play with his own. It was definitely different than it was earlier. Cas was softer, more pliable in his hands. His body responded with more earnestness and he felt warmer under his touch. These were not bad things, only observations as he and Cas lazily made out, hands softly roaming across any bare skin they could reach, under shirts, dipping into waist bands. The pace was unhurried, simply enjoying the closeness now. Dean found Castiel to be much more responsive to his touches, which he took full advantage of as he once again nipped Cas’ earlobe between his teeth, making Cas’ groan loudly into his mouth.
Aberia nodded slowly in understanding, her dark hair hiding the confusion and turmoil in her eyes. “Are we just going to leave her here?”
Cas looked down at him, a happiness behind his eyes. No more hiding. “You threw your back out two weeks ago and I had to heal it before you could sit up, Dean. There’s something to be said for a bed.”
“What’s that smell?” Cas said as he put a hand on his side reflexively as he stood behind him. Dean was momentarily distracted as he took in the soft familiarity of such a simple gesture...something they'd been denied for so long...He cleared his throat of emotion as he glanced back at him.
