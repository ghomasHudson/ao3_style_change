“That’s supposed to be my job,” Cas let out something similar to a laugh, but without the amusement. Without the joy, the sound of it sucking all the air out of the room. “Without my grace I’m not much use to you and Sam, am I?”
Something in Dean’s features finally shifted, an outcry of yearning making his anger look trifling in comparison.
They didn’t talk the rest of the way. Dean stared straight at the road and held himself together until they arrived at the nearest store. He parked crookedly in his hurry and got out without a word, scooping the keys up with him. The squeak of the passenger door opening was what finally made Dean stop short, eyes darting up.
It was a thought that wouldn’t leave Dean no matter how much he drank the night before, and by morning he was blurry-eyed and hollow on the inside, the emptiness in his stomach leaving a relentless ache behind.
“Oh don’t lie to the poor bastard,” Lundy said with a throaty laugh. “You couldn’t save him last time, or the time before that. You’ve got quite the history of letting this one die. What’s one more time?”
So be patient with Dean, just as you’re patient with me, and let’s see him get better together. This chapter has some typical canon violence, along with minor descriptions of injuries. Enjoy the chapter!
Cas’s smile was so sudden, so grand and so full that it nearly forced Dean backwards, the shock of it staggering. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen Cas smile like that. No— no he hadn’t. He would have remembered. He would have remembered if it was anything like this. Sweet and honey warm, all the goodness in it reaching his eyes, crinkling his skin.
“You think Cas would mind if I put a little beer in his PB&J?” Dean snorted indignantly. He reached out for his current beer, fingers slipping over cool glass as he playfully tipped the bottle, making a real show of it. “You should have seen the guy try whiskey man— we’re hosting a
Going on with this story, I just want to address that Dean’s relationship with his anger is going to be dealt with as accurately as possible. There’s no doubt in my mind that Cas’s confession helped Dean’s self image, but anger is tricky and it’s not something that just goes away, especially with decades of trauma.
Dean breathed, or at least tried to, but it hurt. Just existing in that moment hurt more than anything.
Castiel pulled the tape back towards himself, brows furrowed. He read the label again, and then once more, lips moving with it, head spinning right along side it, and Dean— much like the first time he’d given Cas his gift, felt ripped apart from his heart entirely, the very thing beating in Cas’s hands as he pulled the cassette free and raised it against the low lamp light.
It used to make him anxious, as if he was nothing more than an animal being stripped bare for the taking. Now, it just made Dean’s head spin, body warming up like a furnace. He wondered if he’d ever get to feel that way again.
From somewhere behind him, Dean could hear the shuffle of Cas’s slides against the building's grimy tiles, struggling to keep up with Dean’s pace. There was something inexplicably shy about the noise, the desperateness of it making Dean eventually soften and slow down, waiting for Cas to catch up.
Dean watched him settle in, heart racing with the way Cas nuzzled his cheek into the pillow, his hair pressed down over his forehead. He wiped the sleep from his face with a heavy palm, grunting at the back of his throat, and finally looked up at Dean.
Not to mention Cas had been acting differently lately. More distant, less willing to talk and put up with Dean’s antics like he was now. Dean tried not to appear too excited to be seeing him like this again, but there was a drum in his chest pounding away and the smile on his face was nearing painful.
He made the mistake of looking at Cas and trying for a smile. It was too much, even for Dean, and his heart all but stopped when he felt a tear slip down his cheek, managing to push past all his bravado, all his bullshit talk of hope and time, and Cas stared at him like he was breaking. Like he was watching Dean shatter apart and suddenly recognizing the man staring back at him; the tremor in Dean’s chin, the glassy green haze of his eyes— all of it.
When Cas was an angel, it was moments like these that freaked Dean out the most. Knowing Cas could sense emotions, feel certain energies, pinpoint
His head was pounding now that the pain medicine had worn off, a belch of nausea circling his gut, but all Dean could focus on was the heat in his arms, the steady beat of a heart pressed right up against his palm. He blinked through murky darkness and stared straight ahead, feeling without seeing.
“What're you grinning at, asshole?" Dean blurted, both defensive and amused, breaking out into a toothy smile before he could help it.
existing in their own realm of conscious thought and open hearts, and Dean didn’t think he’d ever been allowed that before.
Dean’s eyes shot open, mouth gaping awkwardly. There was a painful stretch of silence before Dean asked, “You busy?”
“No, I mean your form is shit and I’d rather not have you crush your own windpipe,” Sam said, already reaching forward and pulling the bar up himself, racking it while Dean frowned petulantly.
He squeezed Cas's hand, willing the other to look at him, but the angel’s eyes remained elsewhere, refusing to turn back to Dean.
Dean wondered briefly if Cas still had his grace. Even just a sliver of it, buried somewhere deep. He wanted to know whether Cas could sense the way his heart broke just looking at him.
Dean stared helplessly, eyes tracing down to the gash in Cas’s wrist where his IV had been torn out. His feet weren’t any better; just another bloody mess of chipped glass and shallow cuts, his knees all torn up from where he’d slid across the ground to get away.
It’s said with sympathy. With a pair of hazel eyes drowned in unwavering guilt, but that didn’t make it better. It didn’t stop Dean’s heart from rising to his throat, burning up his insides.
It was the only thing he could do without actually moving to see for himself, his legs refusing to guide him.
"Cas! What the fuck- get off her!" Dean yelled furiously, hands moving forward to wrap around Cas’s ankles and yank him roughly, but he faltered at the last second and watched a flash of panic spring across Cas’s eyes before a nose bumped softly against his.
Dean wanted to remember none of it. But when they found their seats, all five of them packing themselves into this whiskey-damp booth with fork indentions buried into the leather, Dean somehow found himself with one beer and one beer only.
“What I want is you safe,” Dean said, and he didn’t know any other way to explain it. Dean would give all of this up— the plan and the mission and the past, every second— if it meant knowing Cas would be safe.
“I was just making sure you weren’t gonna give yourself a scar,” Dean teased, sliding his way through the crack in the door. His ears were itching with embarrassment, tempting him to reach up and touch, but the smile Cas gave him was sweet and familiar, warming Dean up the nice way instead.
Sleep came for him soon after that. Dean fought against it restlessly, fading in and out, and when Eileen finally got up for her turn to shower, Dean was just conscious enough to reach a hand out and stop her.
Dean slumped against the wall the moment he was gone, his legs nearly giving out beneath him. It took several minutes for him to hold himself upright again, and he grabbed what he needed from storage as fast as he could and made his way to the library, wiping at his eyes as he went. The last thing he needed was for Sam to know what had happened, but showing up with the ingredients for Cas’s spell with Cas nowhere to be found was damning enough.
Dean felt a tick in his jaw and looked up, meeting Cas’s eyes and finding nothing but hope and adoration, his eyebrows drawn in calming patience. He looked like he was waiting for something, for
“I think I know what you mean,” Cas nodded, thoughtful. “I have no memory of anything before waking up in that park. It’s all just… black. Far away. And even when I try to remember it— it’s not—” Castiel inhaled harshly. “It’s painful,” He said, voice thick and weighted, dragged in from a great distance. “I can make do with not knowing anyone or anything around me. It's not knowing myself that’s proven difficult.”
He couldn’t because Chuck was gone and the world was saved and Dean still couldn’t find a damn reason to be happy.
It had always been there. Dean’s willingness to fight for himself, to accept that what he wanted was something— anything but this. Anything but a road with no ending and a family with no home and a long list of friends whose deaths still burn at the back of his eyelids every time he falls asleep. It’s only now, with his fate up in the air, his story being rewritten, that Dean was finally listening to any of it.
And Dean for the life of him just couldn’t stop staring, his face stuck in this dumbfounded expression of tender eyes and a slackened jaw, emotions tearing right through him, appearing like a flush on his skin.
“Something tells me I can’t trust your judgment on this,” Castiel leaned forward to get a better look at his face in the mirror, unknowingly pressing the front of his shirt into a small puddle at the edge of the counter. Dean watched him with a hidden smile, the size of it doubling when Cas straightened back up with a gasp and frowned when he noticed the damp spot he’d left behind.
Dean scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand, some part of him peeling to the surface, cracking with discomfort. There were a lot of things wrong. One of them being that Cas was in his passenger seat wearing track pants and slides, his jaw shadowed with facial hair, eyes tired and soft. He had his bandages off today, letting his face breathe, and his skin was just starting to get its color back.
“Why are you in here?” Dean asked, and there was no way he’d ever be able to explain it; the tremor in his voice, the pounding in his ears. “You shouldn’t— you can’t— you can’t be in here.”
“Dean?” Cas tensed in the sudden silence. He turned to try and look at Dean, hoping to catch his expression. “Dean, you’re beginning to worry me. What’s—”
“Advances?” Dean repeated incredulously, his heart all but ripping through his chest. He waited for Cas to take his words back, claim he’d misspoken, but nothing came of it. He laughed nervously, frantic, “damn, you’re really not kiddin’ huh?”
“You mentioned it briefly over the phone, but,” Patience rolled the sleeves of her sweater up, features shaping with nerves. “What exactly is wrong with him?”
Dean grinned at her and finally looked down at his phone. His features hardened. He tried not to think about it too much— he just raised the phone to his ear, breathed in, and answered with a sharp, “Yeah?”
“You will,” Dean said, and he hoped against everything that he wasn’t lying to Cas. “And hey— if not? We’ll go, you and me, anywhere you want. How’s that sound?”
Dean feels it, and he hates that he feels it- which I’m sure is an experience that most of us can relate to. In no way does this change how much Dean loves Eileen, and loves Eileen with Sam, I just want to make that clear. Dean will work his way through this.
“Sure do,” Dean smiled. He reached the bottom of the stairs before looking back to find Cas still standing at the top, staring down at Dean anxiously. “Home sweet bunker.”
Sightless and vulnerable, Dean let the drowsiness of the morning keep the impending panic away. He ignored the doubt creeping in at the back of his skull and pressed his nose into the curled hairs at Castiel’s nape, breathing slow, touching softly. It took a few seconds of Dean letting his hand wander for him to realize that Cas didn’t have a shirt on. That somehow, in the whirlwind of last night, he’d missed this crucial detail, and now they were chest to back, Dean’s fingers playing over bare skin.
Dean closed his eyes and dropped his hand, wading through the room in darkness. The last thing he needed was to shine any light on the heat rising to his face.
“That’s the only way we’re used to,” Sam shrugged, holding up his angel blade, and there was just enough of a confident rise in his shoulders for Dean to look at him and soften, his heart settling for a blissful few seconds.
Dean?” His gaze was cold by the time he focused back on Dean. Even when looking at him from upside down Dean could tell how fragile Cas was in that moment, barely hanging on. “I don’t want you to make a joke of my advances.”
“Try and be quick. Humans aren’t meant to reside in the Empty, it’ll be difficult to keep you there. Oh, and also,” His lips pursed, a painful burst of words drawing back behind the tide, but Dean knew. Sam and Dean both did, and when they smiled at Jack, tight-lipped and brewing with unspoken emotion, Jack finally bit out, “Be careful.”
With his voice tethered straight to his heart, all Dean managed to say was, “You have no fucking idea,” and it was a helpless, trembling thing that barely caught wind.
He was staring straight ahead, eyes swiveled forward, but he was acutely aware of Cas’s every move, stomach swimming with helpless interest. He listened as Cas forced the door open with a contented hum and climbed out of the car.
Dean didn’t know how long he was stuck there, waiting for something to happen, dreading the moment it would. But it seemed like a lifetime later when he felt the bed stir beneath him.
“Let me make something clear,” Jack started, surprisingly intent with the way in which he withheld them, his eyes perfectly distinct. “I’m not Chuck. I’ve absorbed his powers, his essence, yes but— there is no replacement for God. There are some things I’ll never be able to replicate, and his power over the Empty is one of them.”
“I’m fine, Sam,” He said, before turning over his shoulder bitterly to add, “don’t you need to answer that?”
“I think you would be more comfortable if you..." Cas muttered shakily, voice trailing off as he placed a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder.
Dean believed it for a while, those following weeks so peaceful it was almost unsettling. There was no dirt beneath nail beds or pitchy hearing from too much shooting practice. Sleep finally felt like something Dean could have rather than steal, and Cas hadn’t had any more episodes since that freak out in the garage.
Dean had just managed to get his jeans off and tossed across the room when he heard Cas grunt from the opposite side of the bed, his arms dropping heavy and useless by his sides.
With a pulse of annoyance rising in his chest, Dean dropped his coffee mug, and the sound of it clattering into the sink forced both of their heads to snap up. Their eyes met, Cas standing much closer than Dean had originally thought, and they stared and stared, long and meaningful, the world hanging in the balance.
It was Cas. All of it— the shaky hands at his chest and the brush of teeth on his bottom lip, breath heavy and uncertain, movements stiff and awkward.
“What do you mean you don’t?” Dean demanded, and Dean could hardly stand it; the joy pressing in from all sides, the blush rushing hot in his face as he watched Cas’s hand shake from laughter, leaving it wobbling helplessly in the air. “You’re giving me full Tony Montana, you know? I mean come on, name a single movie character with a scar who isn’t badass.”
Dean’s throat ripped open with a sob, and exhaustion sent him collapsing onto the floor of the war room, Cas’s body falling with him.
“Oh, you mean the year that we were fighting God? That year?” Dean scoffed, anger rushing in fast and hot. “Gee, sorry Sam. Guess that kinda thing just changes a guy.”
And now it was all coming to some sort of passing, some final moment of time that Dean could feel like a declaration on his tongue, burning against the back of his teeth. It was there, it was among them now, closer than ever without the world crumbling and Cas disappearing and Dean being too afraid to even breathe.
From a distance it’s nothing but a blast of dark color amongst a plain of tan skin. The contrast is jarring and the pain of it’s visible, but only in a way that’s distorted through the breadth of space, the severeness of it too far to grasp. Look a little closer, however, and the brush of color turns into flesh-red and bruise-purple. The torn skin becomes shredded muscle and the shimmer of it catching the light is no longer just from the decay of tissue, but from the small gashes that bleed and dry and scab.
Dean couldn’t revel in the quiet mornings or the healing calluses on his hands anymore. He had to start being realistic about this, what this would all lead to— and Dean
“Practice?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows suggestively enough for even Cas to understand. “We can practice all you want, sweetheart. Cause’ believe me, there are some things you just can’t learn from a movie.”
“I told you,” Castiel gasped, spluttering. “I told you I couldn’t— that it didn’t feel right. That when you’re gone I—” His voice fell away with a breathless cry, and Dean watched in horror as he writhed and curled, his body bending with the same pain that had taken hold of him that day in the garage. Frightened, Cas whispered, “Dean, there’s something wrong with me.”
Chapter Warnings: brief suicidal ideation in reference to the past (nothing heavier than what is already applied in canon), and even MORE mentions of John Winchester's parenting techniques.
And then it was just Dean and Cas, an ocean of distance between them, and Dean lifted his eyes from the floor with harrowing trepidation. He figured Cas might talk first. He was always good at that; speaking through the silence, reaching out for Dean when he knew Dean couldn’t do it himself. But this was different.
"You havin’ a moment? Need me to come back later?" Dean tried uselessly, but he fell silent when his eyes drifted over to catch Cas’s gaze, finding his attention drawn to the light sprinkle of snow drifting down from the sky.
It’s with his heart seconds away from bursting that Dean lifted his other hand, framed Cas’s heated face, and leaned down to kiss him. Clumsy and out of practice no doubt, noses bumping, Cas’s words dying off with this choked off noise that swelled between the heat of their mouths, but somehow Dean couldn’t be bothered to give a damn.
“There won’t be. Not if I can help it, not when you’re waiting for me here,” Castiel wove his arms around Dean’s neck, the pure awkwardness in his movements making Dean bark out a laugh. “I want to be here.”
“Woah, hey! Watch the head, alright? I ain’t a jungle gym,” He laughed, but he adjusted his arms to hold her tighter anyway, hardly even noticing the way the bunker’s lights seemed to glare in his peripheral.
“I can imagine this is odd for you,” Cas said, tearing Dean out of his own head fast enough to have their eyes meeting abruptly. Cas practically withered under Dean, eyes dashing away. “My predicament I mean, seeing as we’re friends.”
It took minutes for Castiel’s naked body to finally register the cold nipping at its rib cage, searing down its sides. But once it did, it was all he could focus on, and getting somewhere warm was the only thing that mattered.
“I’m what?” Cas swallowed, but god there was no way he didn’t know what was happening with how red his face was getting, the color of it hot enough to have Dean waving it off just for Cas’s sake.
And Dean, for all his bullshit bravado, flinched as if he’d just been sucker-punched, eyes widening with instant panic. It was always those kinds of questions that got his insides curling. At this point, Dean had an easier time answering questions about sex or the infamous John Winchester than a simple
“Because you really think you won’t be able to move on from this. From what’s going to happen to me. You don’t realize how strong you are.”
and you two talk like a couple of golden girls,” Dean explained, making Castiel roll his eyes with about as much conviction as Dean remembered him having. Just the sight of it again made Dean ache all over.
Dean’s unwillingness to move on, his refusal to completely grieve in fear that acceptance was the final step in making Cas’s absence stick. But now his denial felt like naivety. His hope felt misguided, simply untrue, and Dean didn’t know if he could survive this. He didn’t know if he wanted to—
Dean tipped her graciously. It was a ridiculous amount that most times would have left Dean anxious out of habit, a lifetime of dwindling money and scrounging for food making even the smallest act of charity feel like suicide, but it was worth it if only for the tearful smile she gave in return.
A million sensations, a thousand emotions erupting all at once. The scratch of Cas's scruff against his nose, the soft brush of his lips and tongue that was almost mind-numbing enough for Dean not to notice the gentle brush of Cas’s thumbs against his cheeks, as though he was trying to memorize every dip and curve and freckle that made up Dean.
Sam slowly drew his hand back from Dean’s shoulder. “What do you mean he doesn’t remember you? It is Cas isn't it?”
"You know, man, you could probably use a haircut." Dean said offhandedly, ignoring Cas’s pout with a cheesing grin.
what place he loved the most, he just didn’t know how to explain that it wasn’t even a place at all.
Dean smiled as Claire and Eileen stepped into an uncertain hug, both a little shy, Claire more so. But his face immediately fell when he noticed a scar etched straight through Claire’s left eyebrow.
Dean didn’t think his mom would scold him for this though. It was all about the little things these days, and he liked to think that someone like Mary would understand. He couldn’t kiss Cas breathless or ask to be held until the world boiled over, but he could smile at Cas over dinner and goad him while they lifted weights. Dean could stare at him from the driver’s seat of the Impala and pat him on the shoulder and watch Cas try to shave like it was the most engrossing thing in the universe— because it
Sam let out a terse sigh, apprehension prickling. He slowly closed his laptop. He knew how this conversation was going to go. When Dean locked himself in his room for days, his only source of company being a six-pack and a pair of headphones, he only ever came out looking for a fight; anything to get his blood pumping with something other than grief.
Sam had managed to refrain himself from speaking up about the pointlessness of it all so far, but when Dean marched into the station fast enough to have the door rearing back and smacking him in the face, Sam couldn’t exactly swallow down his grunt of pain.
“Why are you so fucking hopeless?” Dean asked in an instant rise, slamming his beer onto the table and cursing when it teetered over and spilled.
to look at owning anything under a legal name. Dean could admit that he was ready— past ready to start a life that wasn’t brimming with hellfire. But none of it would matter.
Something shifted in Dean’s chest. Fast and particular. Small but significant. Dangerous, no doubt, but
“This,” He took Cas’s hand again, and guided him until he was cradling Dean’s face, trapping in the man’s heated blush with his palm. “All of it. Everything.”
“To be fair though we did have twelve years, and I’m not exactly crammed full of compelling qualities.”
“I couldn’t have known everything,” Cas said, hopeful, but Dean gave him a pointed look, causing him to deflate a little. “Really? Everything?”
Sam cleared his throat pointedly, half a beat away from kicking Dean in the shin when Dean finally reeled himself back in.
“We keep Cas in the dark for now, let him build up his memories on his own. Forcing anything could hurt him, break him— hell the guy could burst into flames for all we know.”
Cas glared at him, though the heat of it simmered down almost instantly. It turned into a gradual pout, forehead wrinkling, bottom lip jutting outwards. Dean nearly smiled.
A different human. One in particular. Stronger than himself and responsible for a weight in Castiel that had been dragged with him from somewhere else. As to where from, Castiel didn’t know.
A couple of hangers in his closet rattled, along with a magazine that slid clean off the bedside table, but Dean didn’t pay either any mind. His eyes fell to the chair at the corner of his room instead, to the jacket that had been slung across it for days— now laying in a wrinkled heap on the floor, shaken from where Dean had neatly folded it the second he’d been able to breathe and shed the clothing like a second skin after everyone was brought back.
Dean swallowed around the truth once before speaking it. “No, actually. It’s, uh... it’s yours. I gave it to you.”
“It’s impossible, you know? And I get that you think there’s no other side to this. That Cas is gone and you— you might not think there’s much of a point to anything anymore. I’ve been there too, okay? Believe me, I understand—”
Jody was quiet on the other end, the gentle hum of tires against pavement echoing back to Dean from all sides. Then, low and hesitant, as if she was trying not to let Claire herself hear, “
If Eileen felt any sense of sadness watching Castiel glance over at her as if it were the first time, she didn’t show it. Not even the state of Cas’s face seemed to faze her. She stayed smiling even when Cas shook her hand with a light bow, completely oblivious to the knowledge that he’d met Eileen months ago.
Castiel hung up without warning, the rumble of his voice cutting out with a sharpness that made Dean jerk his head back and glare down at his phone. He tossed the damn thing aside onto the seat.
Cas smiled to himself, leaning further back. Dean didn’t miss the way the movement made his hand graze Cas’s shoulder.
It had worked out, in the end. Four years and a missing dad later and Dean was with his brother again. But while Sam had been puking into solo cups and falling in love, those years had found Dean wasting away in back alleys and drive bars and truck stops, hunger pushing his ribs out while his face caved inwards. Scarce food and even scarcer money making the idea of dropping to his knees for some nameless john in a public restroom seem necessary rather than vile.
“Okay, I’m gonna give you one more chance,” Dean stopped him with a raised hand, eyes closing. “And this time, let’s not give a stupid answer.”
and it hurt just to think about. The past, the present, any of it, but Dean knew what it meant and he knew where it led. “That’s how you know they’re family,” He said, nodding. “That’s how you know that you care.”
Their shoulders brushed as they both settled, cloth to cloth, the heat extinguished, and Dean knew what he wanted— he just didn’t know how to ask for it. His moment of need had already passed, and it shouldn’t matter if Dean couldn’t feel Cas’s skin against his anymore. It shouldn’t matter that Cas wasn’t any closer than he was, and his warmth wasn’t a settled weight pressed to Dean’s back and strewn over his waist.
“You are more to us than a meat suit full of angel juice you dick,” Dean snapped. “None of that matters, that’s never been what mattered,” Cas was looking at Dean now, waiting for him to continue, but Dean didn’t. All he said was, “I thought I told you that.”
“I want to remember,” Cas admitted softly, eyes sad, and Dean had sort of always figured that, but somehow it’s different to hear him say it out loud with his lips candy stained and his knuckles still bumping against Dean’s.
“Have a nice day!” Castiel said quickly, snatching the receipt one second and shoving Dean through the sliding front doors the next. He sighed once they were outside, throwing Dean a look. “You don’t think that was a little uncalled for?”
“Look, I’ve been practicing how to enter the subconscious for a while now, but I can’t make any promises that this’ll work,” Patience said. She turned to Cas again, expression unreadable. “Especially with him being an—”
“I didn’t understand it back at the hospital. God, I barely understood it yesterday— but I recognize you. I
It was Cas remembering standing all night under a lonely street lamp and gazing at Dean in a pink hued bar on what they both thought to be his last night on Earth, but the memories were fractured where it mattered and in Cas’s mind Dean wasn’t a part of any of it.
“God, you’re so full of shit,” She pulled away laughing, stray pieces of blonde hair catching against Dean’s stubble.
There was an unusual chill in the bunker that morning when Dean got up, and he padded towards the bathroom with socked feet and jittery hands. He scratched at his jaw as he walked, grunting at the back of his throat when his shitty night’s rest almost made him collide with the wall.
“You don’t believe that,” Sam demanded, breathing hard. “You’re sad and hopeless out of your mind right now, I get that— but you’re wrong. You can’t tell me that you believe there’s nothing more for us now. After everything we’ve been through, everything we’ve
“No, no! That’s not what I meant,” Sam winced as Dean snickered, scowling until his face turned golden warm. “It’s uh, complicated I guess.”
It was pride that swarmed Dean first. That same painless rise in his chest that had always been there, blazing away, glowing brighter in the moments where Dean was reminded that he’d raised the kid in front of him. It used to happen a lot when they were younger, Dean practically bursting with happiness every time Sam would stagger into their shared motel room for the night to show Dean the grade he’d made on a test that day.
There was a breath. Just one, and then they were moving all at once, suit jackets whipping behind them in their rush to stand.
“The son of a bitch is tougher than he looks. He got his memories back after everything that happened with the Leviathans, and he’ll find his way back from this too.”
Emotionless, Dean stood up and walked over to the coffee machine with his head low and his heart hung lower, finding exactly what he’d feared. Cas hadn’t made enough coffee for the both of them. Dean couldn’t even remember the last time that happened.
And finally Dean reached up, hand gripping his tie with determined strength, and even when his heart ignited with fire and the smoke inside him bellowed and burned, threatening to consume him and drown him all over again, he pulled Cas down, and kissed him.
There was a moment of awkward shuffling between them, Cas uncertain which seat to take, Dean nervously shifting, but eventually he decided on taking the spot opposite of Cas rather than beside him. Dean felt his nerves calm immediately, hands shaking.
And looking at Cas now, dressed in a god awful mix of Sam and Dean’s clothes, the oversized flannel he was wearing making him look especially small, Dean still couldn’t bring himself to feel relief that Cas was back. Not completely, not without a million other emotions battling it out for top pick.
The woman plucked a tissue from somewhere behind the counter and handed it over without a word, mouth pinched. Sam took it graciously, bowing his head, but the second he turned around his eyes went wide with embarrassment.
Peeling out of the parking lot was a mess of gravel and darkened mud, wipers screeching as they moved, but Dean couldn’t find it in himself to care. His leaving figure was nothing but a haze of mist and regret that spun with the wind and wished desperately to be blown back home.
“What happened to sticking together?” Cas asked, hurt flashing so prominently in his eyes that for a moment Dean was at a standstill, flushed with uncertainty. “Doing what we can to stave this off? You said… I thought you wanted—”
There was a screech in the distance, the sound of a horn and a scrape of rubber, but Castiel refused to move his eyes away even when his instincts screamed, heart rising to a deafening drum in his chest.
Castiel buried his face into the side of Miracle’s neck and rocked them back and forth for a moment, the silence turning sadder the longer Cas clung to Miracle like an anchor, shoulders rising with heavy breaths that shook through every exhale.
The sudden rattle of Sam’s phone over the table was enough to make Dean raise his head. They both looked over as the phone continued to ring, the flash of Eileen’s name making Dean pull away just as Sam leaned forward.
Dean couldn’t even dampen his reaction, it happened so fast; mouth parting, eyes flashing with phantom pain he felt creep back into him smooth and easy, making itself right at home in the hollow of his chest.
Within seconds of hearing the screams, Sam ran in from the opposite doorway, his gun already drawn. “Dean! What the hell happened?”
“Because I care,” Dean heaved, and there’s a weight that followed. “I care a lot, Cas,” A weight that looked heavy and adoring reflected back in Cas’s eyes, both of them realizing with painstaking clarity that they had somehow managed to piece something of the past back together.
Cas watched with soft eyes as Dean laughed, the act feeling so unfortunately rare yet special because it was all for Cas, because of Cas and his adorable innocence and blue eyes and wild hair. Because Cas had confessed his feelings for Dean through a goddamn
The fall was fast; Jack’s smile turning pained as his eyes sparked, the tremor in his hand returning, but Dean’s heart fell faster. He felt the Earth roar the moment it shattered by his feet.
It didn’t seem to fully hit Cas until he spoke the words aloud, and then he was looking at Dean with a newfound light, a fervor that hadn’t been there before. Happiness rose in his face like beacons of color, his scar stretching to accommodate, and Dean felt his eyes fill with tears.
Dean shook his head. He couldn’t afford to be thinking like that. Not while driving in the opposite direction of the place he suddenly wanted to be.
Sam blinked at him with wide eyes, not expecting Dean’s bluntness. He sat up with a grunt and brushed his hair back with two large hands, trying to hide his sniffling.
“Long time,” Dean pressed harder on the gas, the drowning hum of the engine blaring that much louder. “She was my dad’s.”
“I was right about that too,” Castiel said, blinking up at Dean wondrously. Dean stared back, seeing him as nothing but slivers of blue and grey. “I don’t know how, but when I’m around you, the pain subsides. For brief moments, it becomes bearable. But there’s always a limit. There’s always a cost,” He swallowed hard, struggling for a moment. “Every time the pain comes back to me, it’s worse than before. And I—”
It’s the way he asked it that strung Dean up, made his throat get tight. So certain, so set on his own failures— there wasn’t a speck in Cas that thought Dean was going to have an answer, and as a result of that… Dean didn’t.
Cas stiffened, half from shock and half from annoyance, jaw rolling sharply against a stream of orange light. He didn’t speak again for a few seconds, and Dean didn’t push him. Trying not to stare at Cas’s thighs was difficult enough, the skin slightly more tanned than when he’d left the hospital, every few inches sporting some sort of cut or scab from his road rash that hadn’t quite healed yet.
Dean grabbed the whiskey bottle from the bed and offered it over wordlessly, unable to say anything else. He was more than grateful when Cas took it from him without any trouble, unscrewing the top with slow fingers, the action unfamiliar to him. He swallowed the handful of pills and washed it back with a splurge of whiskey, face tightening with immediate disgust.
And he said it so matter of factly, so swift and thoughtless that Dean was left wading through water without a raft, heat sparking behind his eyes. It made sense, he supposed. This Cas couldn’t remember anything before Dean, couldn’t recall the years before him and his brother pulled him into the whole shitty mess of their lives and claimed he belonged there.
Dean let those words wash over him, vague and distant, muffled with painstaking refusal. He allowed it, but only for a second, and then he was looking at Sam frantically, searching his gaze.
“I’ll behave so long as you keep your promise,” Cas said defiantly. He stood up and followed Dean to the kitchen sink, his voice rising over running water, “If things don’t turn out the way you’ve planned, then that’s the end of it.”
It was there to be picked at with eager eyes, and Jack was taking his time; he was looking at Dean as if he was watered down with an unthinkable weight, softened with guilt, and Dean knew he was the most powerful being in the world, capable of uprooting all of existence and hurdling it towards the sun, but at that moment he looked seconds away from falling to his knees.
“It’s mostly numb now. Not much pain,” Castiel picked at the hospital blanket with his fingernails as he spoke, vacant with his words, not all there. Dean couldn’t tell whether it was the drugs or something else, something more. The thought terrified him. “But the doctor said he’s not sure whether I’ll get feeling back in that part of my face.”
” She said instantly, so sincere that Dean could only stare out at the road for a few moments, throat working slowly.
“Right,” Sam muttered, wistful. He answered the video call with a tap of his thumb, managing to smile just at the sight of her. “Hey, Eileen.”
“Okay,” Sam said without even thinking. Trust was never an issue between them anymore, not like it used to be. “Okay, we’ll… do what we can.”
Castiel fumbled with the headphones looped around his neck, thumbs brushing over the padding on the inside. He reached for the Walkman tossed on the bed, bare legs scratching across soft sheets, and clicked one of the two latches on the side.
Sam watched Dean slowly make his way out of the library with something similar to guilt wracking up his spine, twisting his insides into knots.
Just like that, all the tension in Sam’s body rose to his shoulders. He inhaled sharply, inflating as he went, and Dean lifted a daring eyebrow, his arm still thrown over the top of the front seat.
“Yes, I do,” Dean’s voice was hard, adamant, and in comparison, Cas’s silence was startlingly sweet, his patience adoring. Dean let it wash over him. “Because this whole situation is fucked and here you are trying your best. Always fucking
“I bought these inside the station,” Sam lifted up a pair of sunglasses, offering them over with a stupid grin on his face. “They can help with—”
A quiet look of disagreement passed through Castiel’s face, head tilting to the side. He eyed Dean almost sadly, worry lines creasing around his eyelids, and Dean ached at the sight of it, all of it— every flicker in his expression familiar enough to bring him back to a diner and a feeling and a singeing mark on his arm.
“What is with you?” Sam finally asked once they were on the road, the Impala’s heater running full blast. “Just the other day you were serious about laying low, and now there’s some lighting strikes and you... wanna just take off?”
Dean didn't blame Sam for bringing it up, or even thinking it at all; considering where they had started, things
“My god you’re old,” Claire deadpanned. She tilted her head to the side to give Dean a better look. “It’s just an eyebrow slit. It’s a thing people do now. Well, cool people.”
Patience, who until now had been shocked into a nearby silence, came to Dean’s side as if compelled, her hands buried deep into the pockets of her jacket.
The crack of bone was always the worst part, the rip of distorted movement sending Dean’s gut on a spiral as Sam cried out weakly, gathering himself only moments later.
Dean didn’t deserve her worry. All he’d done since she came back was ignore her, doing his best to avoid looking too closely when Sam and her would hold hands beneath the table at dinner, Cas suddenly feeling too far away every time Dean saw the way Sam would look at her, almost like he was a kid again and this was his first love touching his shoulder as they ate.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it,” Sam brushed off, clearly grossed out. He smiled tightly and moved a hand to Eileen’s back. “Hey, uh, Cas? This is Eileen. She’s—”
Dean lifted his eyes, and Sam’s expression instantly shattered. He set his gun down on the map table and hurried to Dean’s side, his eyes pulled wide with worry.
And then a noise tumbled out from the lump of sheets, this halfway split between a sob and a wail that made Dean’s stomach drop straight to the floor that he bounded across, water flooding his lungs, blood rising in his ears.
“Get the hell out!” Dean shouted hotly, a last resort that sent Cas flinching violently, his back hitting the shelves.
Chapter Warnings: canon-typical alcoholism gets addressed, minor mentions of sexuality repression, and more acknowledgement of a generally shitty John Winchester because this wouldn't be a spn fic without that shit.
Dean took his jacket off the moment he was inside, a sudden swell of excitement making heat crawl down his arms. This was good, things were fine now, and getting drunk would only make it better. Dean would be floating soon, too immobile and loose-limbed to remember the guilt wading in his stomach, and that was all Dean wanted. He wanted to forget he was walking on landmines, waiting for the moment it all came loose— the wrapping and the font and the falseness of it all— and Cas would realize the plan before it could even take place.
Dean glared down at him, his heart leaping ever so slightly when Castiel raised his eyes. He was laying down on one of the infirmary beds in a ratty flannel and faded blue jeans, his hands folded neatly over his stomach, and the smile he gave Dean was something playful and all-knowing, nothing like Dean imagined it to be in this situation.
The snow had already begun to let up, but the wind that carried the specs of white was still cold and unforgiving, burying itself into Cas's hair and pushing it in all directions, the absurdity of it making Dean laugh even more than the look on Cas’s face.
Dean was concerned for about half a second, eyes flitting to the protruding shape of Cas’s ribcage, and then he was too embarrassed to feel much else, heat creeping up the back of his neck.
Patience shook her head, forehead pinching as she clarified, “No, I— I mean it’s gone. It was cut out.”
“Yeah, and he’s old enough to know better,” Dean insisted, glancing back at Cas. He turned to the red-headed boy, smirking indignantly. “Ain’t that right Archie?”
Dean didn't even notice Eileen standing to his right until the sound of glass getting tossed into the trash bin made him look up, eyes wide. She pulled a towel off the counter and began wiping up the puddle of beer on the floor, offering Dean a smile that felt more like a punch to the gut than anything.
“You can’t keep this up, Cas,” Dean said, stretching his fingers across the mug to warm them, needing that small comfort. “This strong and noble bullshit, acting like it’s all already decided and you’re as good as dead. It’s gotta
She gave a short nod, her eyes softening, and crossed the distance between them with quickened steps. Sam’s arms were already open for her when she arrived, and she fell into him gratefully, rising up on her toes to kiss him warmly.
Yes. Yes, he’d done things like that before. Worse even. Bloodier. Cas decided not to bring it up again.
” She explained gently, words soft, and that was the worst part about all of it, really. Just the presence of this side of her made Sam want to collapse onto the thread-bare carpet. “
The trick was to not think about it. Don’t acknowledge it— don’t let it be true out of sheer fucking will or blinding terror— whatever worked faster, and bury it. Dean had quite the experience with burying it.
"Dean, stop!" Cas yelled abruptly, the sudden gruff of his voice after hours of silence making Dean jolt up with a curse, fighting to regain control of the steering wheel.
Cas dove out of the way just as Dean came forward with the demon knife, but the second he got close Lundy’s body bent backwards with an inhuman cry, mouth erupting with black smoke.
“Which is why you’re getting my clothes,” Cas deadpanned, clearly annoyed. Dean cocked his head at him, making Cas turn on his heel in defeat with a quiet, “I’m going.”
” Jody said, and Dean didn’t like the way those words alone were enough to make his chest collapse with added weight.
They both got into the car in a silence much different to the one they had left it in. Warm and pillowy-soft, something undeniably tender freshly opened between them, unfurling ever so gently.
Sam made a puzzled face, head shaking. “I can come with you.” He protested immediately, throwing the blankets back to stand.
“It’s my job to worry about you, man,” Dean shrugged humorlessly, pulling a face. “It’s kinda my thing. Seriously, ask anyone.”
The lights didn’t give him answers. Not a single one, but they did give him something. A memory, a flash of before. The briefest taste of what used to be, and in the last moments before darkness came to swallow him once again, Castiel remembered home.
“Just— scan his pie so we can go, please,” Cas suggested awkwardly. The kid jolted into action, shoveling items into grocery bags as fast as possible. “Thank you. We’re—” Dean gave Castiel a hard look. “
Which is why when Dean heard someone rummaging through the dungeon’s storage lockers late enough at night to raise concern, he hesitated in the hallway once he realized it was Cas. Embarrassment fled him first, eyes flitting around nervously, but then the moment dawned on him, the memory
“You’re the one wearing socks with sandals, man,” Dean said, needing a way out before he started to question everything.
“This isn’t about blame,” Dean demanded. “So, what? I’m like some fucking drug for you? It’s aces now, but one day the pain will be too much for you to take?” Anger flared through him, pumping in his blood. Dean didn’t like being lied to. He didn’t like having the people he loved in danger. But it’s the sadness that overpowered him in the end, a horrifying thought that lashed and spiraled because— “That’s gonna kill you, Cas,” His breath shuttered. “
Sam didn’t buy any of it. He nodded, for Dean’s sake, but Dean could feel Sam’s eyes on him, saddened and helpless, trailing Dean like a storm cloud. The sting of his gaze lingered in Dean’s mind as he led Cas to the infirmary.
about you,” Sam said instead, and Jack raised his head with shining eyes. His chin was quivering, the miserable kind of sorrow residing just behind his features, waiting to burst free, and Sam latched on desperately. “I don't know what you want. I don’t know where you wanna be.”
In theory, it should be easy. Dean should be able to just take the hit and keep pushing. Keep fighting back, keep up the smiles and the cutbacks and the sarcasm. He’s had plenty of practice, hasn’t he? But Dean couldn’t shoulder it any longer, not all at once, and his mask slipped like wet paint, trailing down his face miserably.
“The last thing I want is for you to have to worry about me,” He finally heaved, practically shaking with it, and Dean reeled himself back in, face running hot.
wake up,” Jack told them, his body coming alive as the stakes grew clearer, and Dean swallowed the fresh lurch of fear he felt creep in from all sides.
“Oh, man. That’s a hell of a conversation to have after four beers,” Dean tried, smiling weakly, but Cas didn’t falter.
He wanted to sink into Cas’s voice and pick apart the emotions buried there, to stay in bed and just look at Cas even if that meant lingering on his lips and aching for his hands, wanting him close and whole and forever. He wanted to simply
Even with Dean making a vague gesture towards the side of Castiel’s face, it still took Cas a few seconds to understand. He slumped in his seat once he realized. He forced his eyes down and away, and started picking at the damp wrapper of the whiskey bottle with his thumb. Digging in and smoothing out, again and again, his nail becoming stained with the paper's ink.
Dean didn’t know whether it was just a damning coincidence, or another part of Cas adjusting, but he couldn’t say he was surprised when he took a seat next to Sam in the library and watched Cas do his best to look casual as he got up and left, calling for Miracle on his way down the hall.
“Dean,” Cas sounded breathless, voice caught somewhere at the top of his throat. He looked down at his own hand held in Dean’s, expression hopeful. “Why are we in here?”
But then the burn never stopped, the heat just kept churning, and it hit Dean like a pitch to the throat that these weren’t just Cas’s memories he was remembering in random spiels, it was
“We’ll have to work on your dirty talk but,” Dean paused to breathe, vision growing warm and hazy the longer Cas continued to look at him like that. Familiar and new at the same time, endlessly adoring. “Yeah, yes— that’s… that’s good too.”
The sound of shattering glass rose miles over Sam’s voice, so unexpected that moving wasn’t even first instinct. Sam and Dean looked at each other, eyes stretched wide, fear nailing them to the ground.
The sudden space between them felt insurmountable, Dean practically hanging off the bed in his need to keep a distance now. It was different with Cas being awake. Too real, too capable of leading somewhere Dean wasn’t sure he could take. He curled a fist into the bedding, searching for his side of the blanket back. He already felt colder without Cas, and the desire to have him back was a physical pain that only worsened when Cas turned over to face him fully.
Dean didn’t understand who Jack was supposed to be now. He was their kid, the son of Satan turned good and Castiel’s most precious gift— but Jack’s memory said otherwise. His knowledge held the weight of their creator, their puppeteer, the very thing that had damned them all since the beginning, and that wasn’t something Dean could just ignore.
“Have you talked to Cas? Does he know we’re headed that way?” Sam didn’t even bother lifting his head, his voice carrying straight into the ground.
Sam didn’t even bother looking up from his place on the bench press. His lips were curled and his breath was steady, all of his attention zeroed in on the metal biting his palms and the weight bearing down around him. He pushed the bar up, shoulders steady, and made quick work moving up and down, hardly even breaking a sweat.
When Cas finally found the courage to look up, it was to the sight of Dean smiling down at him, something akin to sunlight dancing in his eyes, pouring from his skin. Dean felt a warmth bloom throughout his ribcage and weave itself around his heart, cradling his lungs in a way that whispered
” He spoke vehemently, suddenly feeling more exhausted than he had in days, everything catching up to him all at once. “Reverse spells, potions. Anything useful Rowena might have had we’ve searched it twice. We’re doing the best we can.”
Dodge City had been their first case with Cas back, and when Dean found himself with Cas in his passenger seat, just his presence overwhelming, his cowboy hat astrew, fuck it if he
“I’ve always had plenty of things to have nightmares about. It’s just never really mattered until now.”
“You’ve got the whole universe in your lap, Jack. All of it. And after this is all over, after we get Cas back and— and Dean along with him, it’s up to you to decide where you want to go,” Jack’s face shifted, confusion sweeping in again, and Sam rippled with quiet laughter, his eyes no longer dry. “I know what it’s like to feel stuck somewhere, alright? Forced to stay when all you wanna do is leave, and I always thought to myself that… that if I had a kid I—” His voice stopped, and his soul split, the past grappling him by the throat. But it had been a while since anything had felt this important, and by the time Sam found his breath again, he was smiling brilliantly. “No matter how I felt, I wouldn’t make them stay. Not if they didn’t want to. Not if they wanted a life of their own, and that’s what I’m doing. I’m giving you what I never had; a choice.”
Cas let out a gurgling burp out of nowhere, eyes bugging out in shock. They both stared at each other with matched disbelief, frozen still until Dean erupted with laughter, the force of it crippling. Cas visibly relaxed at the sight, eyes softening as he watched silently from afar.
Castiel took tentative steps forward, mindful not to startle the animal, but the second he got close he was pounced on and forced to the ground anyway, his careful posture turning into wild flailing.
Castiel’s confusion was obvious then. Upfront and glaring, flashing hazardously through his slitted eyes. He sat up further in bed and moved his leg away from Dean’s hand, jostling his IV in the process.
He wordlessly moved his cards to the middle as well, sensing that their game was over, and Dean tried not to watch the slow glide of Cas’s hands as he moved from one side of the table to the other, inching closer. Dean managed it, barely, but his resolve broke the second he felt their fingers brush, and his eyes snapped up to a curtain of blue.
Cas is still talking, words fading in and out like a radio with bad reception, and his hand rests heavy on Dean's arm, and he says:
He turns up the music. It’s Creedence, and he sings along as hard as he can stand, white-knuckling the wheel.
So it's a slow and gradual thing, and it sucks. He catches himself out constantly, thinking that maybe -
“You don’t have to humor me, Dean,” Cas says, stiffer than a freaking fridge magnet in a freezer. “I know I’m not what you -”
Then he wakes up Sam, who groans and then squints at him in the half-dark of the room. The light of the neon sign outside paints a violet streak across his cheek.
hugging each other tightly and spinning each other around. Cas smells like petrichor and ozone and day-old sweat. The stitching on his coat is rough and reassuring under Dean’s fingers. He never wants to let him go.
He stops at a motel by the interstate and stumbles out the morning after to a bright winter’s day. The sky is blue enough that he has to squint against it; the snow crunches under his boots. With every breath, the cold air knifes down his throat.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world, buddy,” Dean says. Then he leans back a little to look Cas properly in the eye. “Cas,” he says. “Earlier. I said the wrong thing.”
He takes the I-35 up through Illinois and Iowa, barely stopping to take a piss. The burn of the handprint has settled into something gentler, but it still throbs in a telltale heart rhythm. He thinks about Cas, at the end, standing tall and telling Dean that he loved him.
And Dean can’t stand hearing him finish that sentence, can’t stand not having them be on the same page.
He stumbles into the bathroom to splash water on his face and then stands there, hands clutching the edges of the sink, staring blankly at his own reflection.
,” Sam says, with the kind of heavy, long-suffering bitchiness that means he’s gonna get passive aggressive about it.
So. The thought sits in his chest like a tumor metastasizing, like a rusty fishhook, like a birdcage. Hope is a thing with feathers, or however the fuck that saying goes.
He walks for hours, pulled forward, chest sweetly aching and handprint throbbing to the beat of his own heart.
He can't think about it for too long. If he does, he starts needing a drink, starts to feel his jaw lock up. Can't touch it, or he'll slice his fingers open.
He dreams about Cas, which is business as usual. Dreams with Cas used to mean something, and maybe that something was covert fraternization and angel politics, most of the time, but it was
So instead of thinking about it, he joins a pie eating competition. Goes on a series of hunts with Sam that all resolve easy. Drinks beer and sleeps in motels and eats greasy diner food, and it's familiar in a way that's both familiar and deeply fucking depressing if he lets himself think about it. He's forty-one, he's helped defeat God, and he's still doing this shit? Does he even know how to be anything else? Does he have it in him?
It’s just a large, empty space. If it hadn’t been covered in snow in the middle of winter, it’d make a sweet concert space.
Anyway, the point is that while people are still coming back, he can't quite let go of the thought that Cas might, too. Even if he's in the Empty. Even if it's dumb as hell to think that it could ever -
And then he starts to choke, words and letters pushing up against the back of his throat like yesterday's dinner.
After he crosses state lines the final time, rolling on into Minnesota, he stops at a diner for dinner. He gets a burger and fries, and by this point he is so full of whatever thing is pulling him forward it’s hard to stop moving. His ribcage feels like it’s full of bees.
The forest is quiet. The snow muffles all sound but the crunch of his boots, which reverberate like gunshots. Dean makes a quick mental inventory of Minnesota monsters. He’s unprepared for most of them; if any of them show up, or if this is a trap, he’ll be up shit creek. He’d probably deserve it, too, coming here like this.
“What?” Dean asks, as softly as he can, which isn’t much. He’s not good at this. Not with Cas. Not yet, but hopefully - if he dares to hope - hopefully soon.
“Don’t worry your sweet little head about it, Sammy,” Dean says. “Just got a little something to take care of, so I’m heading out.”
Cas gives him an expectant look. His hands are fisting into Dean’s coat. “What did you want to say, Dean?”
The waitress keeps looking at him funny. When he goes to leave, she won’t let him pay. For a second, he thinks she might be interested, but then she gives him a soft, sad look and tells him about how her partner had taken months longer than her to come back, and that she understands what he’s going through, that he shouldn’t give up hope, and then he has to go.
He can fill a silence like nobody’s business, so he launches into a rambling review of the music on the regional radio station, (bland enough to give Wonderbread a run for its money,) the scenery (cold and snowy), and the present company (non-existent; please, Cas, come back to me).
Afterwards, the world knits itself back together slowly, like broken bones healing. People come back to their loved ones, but not all at once, filing in gradually. Dean guesses they've had a long way to go. Wherever the hell they went, when Chuck had punted them out of existence.
