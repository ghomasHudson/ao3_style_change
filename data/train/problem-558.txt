The cat was still trying to climb on John who didn't seem too excited. He was moving it again as he said: "Unfortunately, it's more common than people think. The tetanus is in the soil, people cut themselves on rose bushes, garden forks that sort of thing."
John was in the kitchen cleaning up the tea he spilled due to Sherlock suddenly jumping up out of nowhere.
"So when he said he's concerned about him, he actually is?" you laughed incredulously, mostly out of relief. And John nodded, putting his hand on your back and pushing you to keep walking.
As he disappeared outside, you and John exchanged a quick look and then darted after him, leaving your bags behind. You jumped over a fence and into a secluded sitting area with a view of the water. There was a sole person sitting there - a homeless woman on a bench next to a bunch of plastic bags.
A few moments after John started begrudgingly remaking the tea in the kitchen,  Sherlock jumped up again, remembering something, but didn't seem to move much because as soon as he got up dark spots began to glitter in his vision and he started getting light-headed. He was losing his balance and everything suddenly sounded underwater and cut off, though he didn't pay too much attention to the sound around him due to the fear of falling over. Before he knew what he was doing his hands were trying to find something to steady him on, but it was too late and he could feel his knees giving up under him and the rest of himself surrendering to the force of gravity.
Sherlock looked at you intently. He was infuriating but at the same time, he was good. You wondered if he understood his actions, you wondered if he understood yours. He was so odd but so smart at the same time. He was so clueless and yet so intelligent. He knew all the right things about human nature to consult the police but didn't know enough to fit in. Or maybe he did and he just didn't want to. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock called Lestrade and managed to get all the details about her from him. When you met him he seemed not to ask a lot of questions where Sherlock was involved. All Sherlock did was gave him some basic information and your name and he was okay with everything. Sherlock was weird enough so people didn't ask him a lot of questions but also brilliant enough to get all the answers he wants from them.
Sherlock just hung up his phone and threw it on the coffee table after talking to Lestrade, This time he called him Gavin. John thought about the fact that Sherlock memorized the entire periodic table and still failed to remember the name of the man he's worked with for years, though, with the amount of food, water, and sleep he has, John supposed it's a miracle he can remember his own name.
It didn't seem like you had anything better to do so you turned the laptop on and googled Connie Prince's name.
When he arrived shortly afterward he wasted no time greeting anyone and walked into the room you were in.
When the door shut behind (y/n), John willed himself to look at Sherlock and be honest, because that was the last thing in his mind he thought might help with their conflict. The man was still going through the papers in his search for any Thames-related news to reveal the nature of the photograph they received.
"Oh, should I speak now?" A confused feminine voice came. "Alex, love, it's Professor Cairns. Listen, you were right. You were bloody right. Give us a call when-" some static and the phone stopped.
You got up on your feet and something in the back of your mind decided to keep moving. Your hand wrapped around the front door handle and soon enough the cold outside air whipped in your face. A deep breath did nothing, neither did two.
He came back a few minutes afterward and paused in front of you. "She was trying to steal some equipment, didn't even need to speak with her to tell. Here you go," you caught your bandage and walked over to a trashcan. When you turned away from it you could see him walking back inside his house.
The air grew heavier in the vehicle. "Because I worry about Sherlock." He said, and you couldn't tell if he was joking. "Constantly. You can probably guess why."
Sherlock held his finger up to him and spoke slower this time, piecing it together, "he organizes these things... no one has direct contact."
It was easy to drown in the chaos of your mind when your surroundings were reflecting it. So you just went around and put things in their place. It was easy. And it gave you something to do that didn't really require any thought. It was comforting. After you were satisfied you sat down on the couch and appreciated your work. The text from John came and you exhaled slowly. The hostage was alright and no one was physically hurt. You added John to your contacts and agreed to breakfast the next day. Only after you sent the text you realized you were actually going to join him and Sherlock. You weren't surprised, but more aware than before.
After you left a cab took you to some lab and you reached the conclusion that Sherlock spent about half of his time riding cabs and the other half being infuriatingly vague.
Both of your gazes turned to him around the same time and you wondered what it was like to have everyone interested in you. His hand moved swiftly in a flash of white and he was next to you in seconds. Leaving Lestrade and a curly-haired woman behind that you heard someone call 'Sally'. He and John walked over to the man's wife and you stayed behind to take a quick look at the car. No one seemed to care if you looked despite not being a cop. It didn't look like there was anything serious going in there. Thankfully you couldn't see a body through the window. And you weren't intending to do a full inspection of the interior.
"He got it on her paws?" You asked hoping this meant Sherlock solved the case and the loss of five hours wasn't a death sentence.
You and the guys parted when they left for their house. They had enough time to get there and contact the bomber through Sherlock's blog and John promised he'd update you once the hostage was safe.
"Yes. Solve the case. Could you do it? Could you gather evidence? Could you observe and interview and deduce?"
Once you decided what words to use, your hand trailed on its own with a paintbrush and your mind settled over the matter of Alex Woodbridge. The urge to cry and be miserable hit you at full force but you pushed it away to face the wall and consider its actions.
Idle chatter was coming out of the television behind Sherlock and the few other people in the restaurant.
"What? Has my brother made you go deaf? This case is all yours. John, I have no ill intentions towards you in this, I simply want you to understand. Oh and (y/n), this isn't meant to hurt you either. Consider this another experiment. Bye-bye now." Sherlock exited the cab as it reached the museum and halted John from following.
The most calming thing that could happen was it being a random burglary, you thought sadly. That way you'd know you locked the door and that the criminal behind it didn't care about you.
"And a happy new year," Lestrade added. "Well, I better get my feelers out for this Golem character."
"Eight, ten days," John said and looked at the body without really looking. "The cut was made later, after she died, the bacteria entered her system some other way." He looked at Sherlock and he gave him a proud look.
Sherlock put down his phone with a grunt and walked to the stack of papers. No doubt looking for anything involving the Thames.
"So tell me, are you familiar with the carrot and stick approach?" He asked while brushing off his immaculate suit, trying to look uninterested.
"Me." Sherlock finished and turned with a flourish, leaving Lestrade behind as John and (y/n) followed him. Once they were out of Lestrade's earshot and a good enough distance away from the other cops, Sherlock turned to John and (y/n) and stopped them.
After their conversation earlier in the morning, they split up to get ready. Sherlock was ready first, he wore a black suit jacket and pants with a light blue button-up shirt. He walked into the empty living room and saw the tv wasn't saying anything that mattered he sat down on the couch and stopped listening.  A few moments later, John came into the living room and (y/n) probably replaced him in the shower.
A big woman wearing plaid opened the door and welcomed you in after you introduced yourselves. You shook hands with her and couldn't do more than awkwardly offer sympathy. You worried she'd get suspicious over your nerves or the bags you were carrying for no obvious reason, but she let you in without much talking and you immediately put the bags down and focused all your attention on Alex's room. It was small and disorganized, with a green wall that had several things hanging from it, more for the purpose of having something on your wall than anything else. The sloped ceiling on the right side of the room curved down into a wall with a small rectangular window, next to a bunch of posters about stars. In front of the window was the most noticeable thing about the room. A tall lump covered in a white bed sheet.
"She really was very talented. And she was so dedicated and creative, it's inspiring." You said, despite not knowing her.
Sherlock and him were walking back into their flat. The morning sun filtered through the windows and the air was dense. Every few seconds a flake of dust passed through a sunbeam and became visible.
"Raoul is my rock, I don't think I could've managed without him." He said. "We didn't always see eye to eye but my sister was very dear to me."
Sherlock is the sort of man who doesn't trust easily. The sort of man who sees lies and danger in every corner. He sees formality as unimportant and manners as irrelevant and most of humanity as a burden. But he made an effort. Good intentions aren't always enough, the path to hell is paved with good intentions, but when you act on them they're what separates you from a devious crim dealer and makes you worth loving. "All you need to know is that the earth doesn't revolve around you. You want people to understand you, I get that, with how you are- and I mean that in a good way- it's hard to make connections. But it's very easy to lose the connections you have. You can neglect them or you can over-invest in them and you can do a million things. The most important thing is you strive to get better, that's all we need. That's all John needs from you too. He likes you."
All he could do that night was hope (y/n)'s night on their couch wouldn't lead to a morning like the one he had then.
2/9/2021 update: my gf and I broke up. I'm having a hard time coping, plus school is starting for me again so don't expect very frequent updates. I do intend to finish this work and I hope you're all doing well :)
Sherlock smiled, a smile you couldn’t quite figure out. It was pleased or excited, and it made you feel like what you were about to hear wasn’t pleasant in the least.
A straight engaged couple sits on their couch watching tv at night. The man gets up and leaves. His name is Andrew West. The next time he's seen is on a railway, with his head bashed in. He is an MI6 clerk- was, an MI6 clerk, and he was also in possession of a USB containing vital information regarding missile plans. It wasn't in his possession when he was found.
The night before everything started flashed through his mind when they all agreed she could sleep on the couch.
About two hours later you two followed him as he went back inside the dark and dimly-lit police station and announced his presence by declaring Raoul De Santos was the killer.
"That's good, that's a good deduction yeah." John smiled in a way that reached down into Sherlock's chest and filled his lungs with rocks.
“I think you’re more likely to be the secret agent here,” he didn’t act like some concerned person living next to a building that just blew up.
He had a distinctive uncle look to him and short gray hair. He lead you to a car the color of a raven's feather with all of its doors open. According to the gray-haired Inspector, it was hired the day before by some banker named Ian Monkford who paid in cash and then likely proceeded to have a very bad time in it.
You were standing at the entrance to your house when it occurred to you. What if the bomber was behind it all? What if he was there?
You were still wearing the clothes from the previous day. They didn't do much against the cold but you welcomed it. The itch in your mind returned and you crossed the street with long meaningful strides. The building across the street was still in varying degrees of destruction. It felt real, and you felt unsafe.
The cat was very eager to get on John, who wasn't having any of it. He tried to get it off of him and you took it with an awkward smile. "And to the public, Mr. Prince. She was very dear to all of us." You said.
John scoffed and then thought better of it. It was entirely possible the detective was being honest.
John, in turn, let his head rest against Sherlock's shoulder. Despite his mixed feelings of anger, fear, grief, and more examples than he could count. He looked up at his face and something in Sherlock's eyes was vulnerable then. A glitter of uncertainty shone in them, and relief. He relaxed and John took it as a sign that he could stay. A flower of an unrecognized emotion was blooming in his chest.
He seemed to evaluate whether or not you were worth telling that information to. “No. More of a detective.”
Well, probably because he had post-it notes and a telescope and a Professor Friend and stargazed. He was the one who discovered the painting was fake. He was the one that needed killing. Maybe not because he was nice to his flatmate, but maybe because of his telescope? Maybe because of his Professor Friend?
"Alright! Girls, calm down." John spoke and then looked to (y/n), "Sorry. Not good. Continue, Sherlock."
Sherlock tilted John's chin so their eyes bore into each other with earth-shattering intensity, and for a moment John had completely forgotten everything other than his hammering heartbeat. The pre-existing adrenaline tripled in his bloodstream and surged forward like lightning, threatening to topple John to the ground.
I really want to thank you for reading this and if you leave kudos or even a comment it would make me super happy :)
The rest was a mix of random people, and people whose job it was to help. There were bandages on your arms and head and you were told that you’re gonna be okay. You thought about reaching for your phone but it was too much effort. You were okay just sitting there for a while and people-watching. Among those people, was a man who came down from his house. You only noticed him again when he spoke to you.
"Precisely!" Sherlock pointed to them with his available finger. "Ticket stubs that mean he worked in a museum or gallery. A quick check revealed that the Hickman gallery has reported one of its attendants missing- Alex Woodbridge." As expected, his companions looked back down at the man, (y/n) struggling but pushing through, as if he might suddenly rise back to life since they discovered his name.
Going back in time to the crime scene. With John as Sherlock, what could they do? They could break into the gallery, look for incriminating paperwork, but it would've all been destroyed. They could look for the names of people who ran tests on the painting, but how to prove the tests wrong? How to tell legitimate experts where they got them? How to run more tests?
As you left your heart pounded strongly. A plan was beginning to form in your mind already. You were afraid, naturally. But you were gonna act. You were going to help with this case and take back control from the bomber.
The first event: you were hungry. Not the kind of hunger where you get nauseous and the pain is so strong you can’t move, just a bit hungry.
"That," Sherlock leaned over with a smirk way too big, "was my last act as a detective on this case."
Aside from the three of you the room was blessedly empty. Sherlock worked in silence and you and John had a hushed conversation in the other corner and managed to go a bit deeper than small talk. You felt like you had him to talk to and hang around, and it made you feel a bit better and less like some sort of third wheel. You were glad for the chance to sit down and do something mindless too.
It was about four in the morning when Sherlock has finally cracked his latest case and started explaining it all to John at light speed barely stopping to even breath. John has always been fascinated by how the man could go weeks without food, water or sleep yet still act like a child and run around the flat happily every time he solved a case instead of collapsing on the floor in exhaustion.
With a slow exhale you let your head rest on John's shoulder, who was sitting between you and Sherlock.
Thank you so so so much for reading and I hope you have an amazing rest of your life, because why not? :)
"He killed the old lady because she started to describe him. The first time he put himself on the firing line. Just that once. Usually, he stays above it all. No direct contact."
Once you were done at the crime scene, Sherlock, John, and you got a cab. Getting inside the cab with the three of them reminded you of the previous night. The tired silence in the cab back to Baker Street, the blank looks on your faces, the suffocating sadness.
"So Janus cars was in on it." You realized out loud." A company named after a two-faced god who's related to beginnings and endings. Is it possible that-"
. You couldn't beat yourself up or think of what to do when you were already doing something, anything, to make some sort of change.
Without thinking about it too much, and resolving to speak to the Professor anyway, you continued working on your own masterpiece. It could be a good thing if the forgery wasn't connected to the paint chemistry. Maybe it was simpler. Maybe it was about astronomy and Professor Cairns could be of assistance. Ever since the cab ride, you had been feeling like your heart turned to stone. You were heavy with fear and incredulity. You couldn't do it.
Also, Sherlock didn't notice the woman spying on him and John at the restaurant because he was too focused on John. Read that again and notice how ironic the "I don't let emotions cloud my judgment" line gets.
"The clue's in the name. Janus Cars," said the sobbing voice. You and John exchanged a look and then he and Sherlock did the same but in a subtler way.
Nevertheless, the playful feeling, the hunger in your stomach, and your determined mood caused you to pick a fry from Sherlock's plate, and when he didn't react you took it as a sign that he didn't really mind and allowed yourself to take a few more.
Lestrade Sherlock and John walked into the lab in that order. It screamed white. Walls, cabinets, everything, white and sterile. Colorless except for the bits of chrome in the sink and windows. A sharp scent in the air.
"You have to understand. I love him, that's not why I defend him. I defend him because I-. I love him because he's worth defending. He's an honorable man. That's why he had to be murdered, because he wouldn't betray us."
She had a fond smile on her lips as she remembered him, and you really wished Sherlock were there to do the talking. The room wasn't very interesting apart from the telescope. Alex had a blue night lamp near his bed, next to a small alarm clock. He had a small, dusty mirror on the wall where he must've seen himself every morning, and orange post-it notes he hung on the wall but won't be the one to take off.
Earlier that evening in the middle of all the chaos, Sherlock was being kind. He was gentle and caring, and he kept looking John in the eyes and searching them as John often searched his. John saw some of his own emotions reflected in the detective and he hoped what he saw was real.
"Can't be as simple as it seems otherwise the bomber wouldn't be directing us towards it. Something's wrong." He said and looked at her. Cat scratches on her arm. Clean cut on her hand. Needle marks on her forehead.
No emotions reached the surface of your awareness and you watched everything unfold with a numb expression and ice in your heart. Three pips, a blonde woman, and then John went to change the channel on the small tv and the phone rang. The hostage was blind, and you had twelve hours to save her.
A grin of incredulity stretched out across John's mouth and he scoffed. The only person who remained unreactive was (y/n).
John just rolled his eyes and asked him in a partly sarcastic tone if he could stand, and he wasn't sure if Sherlock meant it or not when he said no, but he was so tired he didn't even care. He partially lifted him up from his shoulders and blatantly dragged his legs - in a way that wasn't even close to comfortable - towards the couch.
"Not much cop this caring lark". He said as he scanned the news websites for relevant information. He said it because it was true. He said it because he cared.
Sherlock watched as the waves crashed down and innocently crawled back into the river. "He's been in the river a long while. The water's destroyed most of the data." Both John and Lestrade looked at him. "But I'll tell you one thing. That lost Vermeer Painting's a fake."
Sherlock seemed much perkier now that John has joined you and the night grew farther away. "Well, obviously I lost that round." Sherlock grabbed the remote and muted the tv. "Although technically I did solve the case".
"The morning after the explosion, Sherlock's brother came into the flat. Sherlock did anything to get him out except physically doing so, but before he left he talked to him about a case he had. Sherlock for some reason refused him, even though he had nothing else to do. That's the reason I told him to take it. But instead, he threw the case at me. The deja vu is hitting me at full force. Basically, I went to Mycroft and told him Sherlock wanted me to gather information for him, and now I'm somehow stuck with it."
"First time we met he guessed where I served and that my sister's an alcoholic from my phone and haircut."
You understood what he meant and nodded solemnly. The bomber, for whatever reason, took away five hours from what they had left to solve the case. And apparently, Sherlock was coming there too and with a camera.
"So you brought us here to look at the stars and enjoy the smell of wet bins?" (y/n) spoke up from behind John, who was behind Sherlock.
A good deal of time passed before you took your eyes off the ceiling and turned off your alarm. The stomachache subsided by then and you decided this was never going to happen again.
Sherlock's voice was low and thoughtful. "Why hasn't he phoned yet? He's got thugs busy taking pictures and sending threats It's not like he's preoccupied. He's broken his pattern, why?" The steady stream of speculation was cut off with a louder "Waterloo Bridge" to the driver.
"He kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. Why? Because he'd recently had a booster jab. HepB probably difficult to tell at that distance. Conclusion? He'd just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Columbia. Mrs. Monkford cashes in the life insurance and splits it with Janus Cars".
Knowing John for a while meant you learned to expect his comments. Not generally revealing any new information but still breaking the silence. "Old block of flats," he said, "he certainly gets about."
"Sad how the things we can't control always get to us." You said. And worried those words could apply to your situation.
"I'm not explaining this very well but I think you get what I'm saying. Theseus beat all his enemies by playing their own game." You exhaled. "I don't even know who our enemy is, I don't know his game I-"
It was like falling off your bed woke you from a dream, because at first, nothing was clicking. And then you caught up. Your brain was a lump of ice. And it hurt, a lot. Your ears were ringing and your whole body was aching. Your face twisted into a frown and waves of pain flashed through your head.
At some point, you shifted and moved to look out the window. It was sprinkling outside and blackness was covering everything like a thick blanket. The occasional lamppost lit up the sidewalk with its orange light and disappeared behind you. You stopped at a red light about ten minutes away from the house and through the window, you saw a medium-sized store with a 24-hour neon sign flashing red and blue and stepped out of the car. You couldn't tell if John was awake or not but Sherlock was looking at you and you assured him you'd be at their house soon. You walked inside and got momentarily blinded by the white lights inside.
"No idea, sorry." The air was thick as honey between you. The furious morning wind turned into a light breeze and made the room suffocating and small.
"My contact at home office gave me the complete records of Raoul's internet purchases." He said looking at you and then turned to Lestrade. "He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months. Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose, so yes."
You leaned in closer and whispered to him, "go, help Sherlock, I'm gonna text my friend Charlie and have her come with me to my place. I don't know what to say or even do but I could use a change of clothes."
As always, let me know what you think through comments and kudos. Always feel free to share criticism (please do), ideas, thoughts, and anything in a comment because they make my day and provide me with a lot of motivation. Also, let me know what you think about the romance. I've been adding a lot of little gestures and phrases to show Sherlock has a special spot in his heart for John and I'd love to know if they're noticeable.
John was fumbling with his hand and rose up from the couch. He gave you a look that said "keep him busy" and walked away saying he needed to make a phone call. You wondered if it had anything to do with the cat scratches on Connie's arm. The cat smelled like bleach or some other form of cleaning material and now John's hand did too. The whole house did.
From (y/n)'s comment, it was clear she did not share his feelings. And her fear hit him like a sack of bricks.
"Moving on after the loss of a loved one can be very tasking." You said and nodded since it felt right.
At the restaurant, John and Sherlock sat down. The icy wind had gotten there too and was making the beige curtains by the window twist and fly up.
You didn't know how to finish that sentence. John didn't know either. You just looked at each other for a bit. You could see how much John wanted from him. But you didn't know if Sherlock could give him what he wanted.
Also if anyone is worried, Jim will be made aware of Sherlock's ''move'' and will absolutely make one of his own as well. Not to mention Mycroft is going to give our reader the good old harm-him-and-you-die-speech in some form or another.
There's a chance you sounded accusing to him, but again, you couldn't be bothered to discover if you had.
This of course had a simple solution, stop the cab you’re on at this Speedy’s place and get a sandwich.
Sherlock grabbed the camera and balanced it just too close to the man's face and very lopsidedly. He took a bunch of blurry pictures and bent to inspect them. The whole thing looked like a cartoon scene with Sherlock taking worse and worse pictures from odd angles and Kenny trying to adjust himself and look like he didn't mind. It went on for a while during which they chatted a bit about Sekhmet and Kenny picked her up and tried to look fond of her. After that Sherlock took more blurry pictures that consisted of John sniffing the cat's paws and then they left the place talking about deadlines as Mr.Prince called something out from behind them.
With one brief look at the driver, who you couldn't see, you entered the car and made sure to sit as far away from the man as you could. He studied you as you reached to put the seat belt on and you tried to return the gesture by keeping your eyes on him despite the car starting to move. Your internal struggle seemed to amuse him, but he didn't seem like he wanted to hurt you and if he wasn't on the bomber's side, you decided it might be good to hear him out. You also had no doubt he could force you into the car if he wanted. Maybe not himself, but he looked like a man who had several thugs at his disposal.
"I see," Sherlock said, in a voice that made it seem like he didn't. Like he was hurt. The guilt in John's heart grew heavier and he ignored it. Silence stretched out between them like a rubber band about to snap.
But you didn’t have anything better to do, the text did spark an interest in you. His character was fascinating, and frankly, you wanted to know what the hell happened that made the building near his house go up in flames and catch you in the process.
John felt the previous emotion slipping away and getting replaced by the icy air around him. He had to act fast, so he grabbed Sherlock's arm from behind him and pulled him close. With both of John's hands gripping Sherlock's sides and their eyes searching each other, Sherlock was silent.
"If he thinks he can he's deluded and that's good for us. And if he's not? we'll still control him. We can coax him out of his shell with a game and we can find a weak link to manipulate in his web of crime. He'll come down like the rest of them."
You woke up with three things the following morning: a jumbled brain full of thoughts, a paralyzing weakness, and a sharp pain in your stomach.
Both he and Sherlock stayed silent. The only true response John could think of involved saying she's right and that just felt like an insult.
Part of you expected him to change. Expected his face to morph into an expression of anger. Part of you was tensed up and ready for him to start threatening you. Ready to force the thoughts about the danger you're in from the bomber away and reinforce the wall of your resolution. But his demeanor stayed the same. "But we haven't even discussed the details. You wouldn't want to miss out on an offer such as this, I assure you."
(Y/n)- random greek myth and general knowledge, creative ideas (very prominent in the next chapter), and also thrifty I guess.
I'm trying to pepper in more and more Johnlock but let me know if you want more or you think it's going too fast.
I didn't mean for it to be this long but it's like 3.7k words. Also, it's not JUST a middle finger. It's got like, a sentence in there. The essential purpose of the note is to get Jim's attention so yeah.
A break to google Vermeer and let the paint dry revealed that Johannes Vermeer, a Baroque (art style using contrast and movement) artist, specialized in domestic scenes of dutch middle-class life, and died leaving his family in debt. People believed that he started most of his paintings with grey and brown paint and then went over them with color, and researchers came up with a list of different paints and materials he used. In theory, this could all be useful. But certainly not to you, and not on your own.
"Well," she laughed, "he always burned the popcorn. Me, I have a gift for it. I always get it perfect but I was really tired one evening so I let him make it. We watched a documentary I didn't really care for and he commented on how the narrator sounded as if he ate burnt popcorn and he just started impersonating him. Westie just made it so funny, he made everything feel light and funny and fun. He liked to do impressions and he always made us laugh. Especially when we'd go out to the pub. One time he spent thirty minutes talking to us as-"
You tried to sit up, which was a good call. You weren’t in very bad shape. Few scrapes and red skin on your arms that thankfully the adrenaline stopped from hurting and a headache.
"I never said I don't. I care about people, some more than others." It was Sherlock's turn to look him in the eye. By then the windows closed and the curtains made the light seem warmer. As he pulled away from his hand he added "I just don't let my emotions cloud my judgment."
It was morning and you were having a cup of tea that was supposed to take the pressure off finding out whether you got the job you interviewed for two days prior or not. It was like your brain was determined to show it wasn’t damaged by the blast and get very nervous about something as trivial as a job interview.
He didn't know what would happen the next morning or if there will be a "next morning" for Sherlock because he would probably wake up in the night afterward but it didn't matter to him.
The look on the fiance's face snuck into John's chest and wrapped around his lungs. "Westie wasn't a traitor! That's a horrible thing to say!"
They burst out through the door giggling and the scent of Sekhmet's paws seemed to have refreshed John.
John still looked at you with uncertainty. "It's alright John, She's a big scary bodybuilder and I don't think he'd do anything serious. What he did was about showing Sherlock what he could do. We already know he's dangerous. Go help him, I'll contact you if anything happens. Until then send me the landlady's phone number."
They all kind of have their thing but this is my first time attempting to insert an oc into a show with an already established cast so I really try to keep things balanced.
With permission from the woman, John lowered the bedsheet nervously to the floor to reveal a shiny black telescope on a metallic mount. The placement of the telescope in front of the window made the light reflect off its smooth surfaces, and the lack of dust on it showed it was very dear to Alex.
Even if the bomber was in charge of the burglary it seemed more logical for him to have hired someone for it. He didn't like getting his hands dirty. He stayed above it all. Probably made him feel superior.
"Laughing at a crime scene all over again," Sherlock said, still smiling and walking in the lead. "Classic."
"I'm sorry. About that picture, that is," Sherlock said inscrutably. "And I'm sorry for how foolishly childish your worldview is."
Lestrade turned over to her in relief and awkwardly waved his hand in a greeting she couldn't return because she had two plastic bags in her hands. "Old painting that was just rediscovered."
"You're right," Sherlock's voice was low as always. He had more to say but stayed silent. You had a lot of thoughts too, but nothing worth saying. You curled your toes deeper into the carpet and watched some birds make their way through the sky.
“If you’re looking for a crime there’s a nervous EMT over there that keeps touching her pocket,” you said and pointed at her, keeping your gaze at him. He stopped looking at his phone. At first, you thought he wouldn’t really care about it, but he thought about it for a bit and probably decided he didn’t have anything better to do so he got up and started walking.
You opened your mouth to speak but the man cut you off. "Oh, you needn't worry about the man who blew up that building. I don't work for him, I just have a proposition. You might want to know that my proposition involves protection from him, however."
You awkwardly hopped the fence again and went back into the cab, where Sherlock was waiting like an impatient mother. "And now the gallery. I hope you've got cash."
It was like it wasn't her moving at all when she moved to a chair, sat down on it, and placed her head in her hands. She moved slowly like a robot and her eyes gazed into the table like a doll's.
Cold seeped into every muscle in your body, your forehead was pounding, and hard numbness settled all around you.
When he finally got to Sherlock's room, John sluggishly tried to put him down on the bed but their height difference and mutual lack of sleep resulted in John falling in the bed with him.
You guessed the smell was coming from the layer of blood spilled all over the driver's seat and around it. It seemed weirdly innocent, just sitting there.
To make sure Sherlock was being enigmatic enough, they also had a conversation outside of the office that was even more all over the place.
“You noticed that ambulance worker was hiding something, you proved that you were a fast thinker with the bandages, and you showed emotional strength so if you could kindly come with us to look at a car-” John cut Sherlock off before he could get any snarkier and finished for him, “he would be very grateful.”
"Well I could go for that cup of tea you said you'd be making almost twenty minutes ago." he said, ignoring his role in the delay, and John muttered something inaudible and finished cleaning.
Sherlock and him moved to look at the car without a second thought. Clearly, it wasn't their first time doing that. Talking to John seemed better than just standing there awkwardly so you walked in his direction.
Sherlock eased up and walked ahead, with John and (y/n) following him. The icy air was a bit less suffocating and John shoved a bit of food in his mouth. The case was going to be solved, the hostage saved and Moriarty caught. That was the thought echoing in the air and in John's head. That was the thought he kept repeating to himself.
The man inclined his head in approval. "You are correct. I am going to be very upfront with you, (y/n) - I have a carrot, of sorts, to offer. My carrot means protection. It's safety, an ally on your side, monthly financial compensation, and very valuable intel. I can keep you safe and I can make you very wealthy. You've already seen a fraction of what I can do, and I can promise you access to way more. If, and only if, you grant me your carrot."
"Oh she was adored," the man continued. "I've seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters and turn them into princesses," He struck you as very old-fashioned and you worried he didn't care about girls beyond their looks.
Despite only being a moment behind, their conversation with the wife ended right around the time you turned around. Sherlock looked very emotional and then his expression melted away and turned completely blank in the time it takes a mirror to shatter, he said a few words and appeared next to you with John at his tail. Was he normally like that?
The woman (not Lucy, not a fiance, just a woman) kept her blonde hair in a lazy clip behind her head. She had pale skin that had seen better days and red eyes. John only allowed himself to pay attention to this in order to make sure she wasn't faking sadness, but he couldn't bring himself to forget his observations afterward. She was dressed comfortably and had an overall sense of sorrow that seeped out of her pores and infected the air. It only grew when John tried to suggest her dead fiance had committed treason.
Thank you so much for the 40 kudos, they mean a lot and motivate me to improve. Also let me know if shorter, more frequent updates sound better to you, cause I don't mind either way :)
“I met her after the blast when I was out and looking for entertainment, It’s a strategic move and a fairly good addition to our ‘squad’”, Sherlock made sure to make a joke out of the word.
At that moment, he decided to stay in the bed with Sherlock, and could already feel a wave of relaxation hit him, making his eyes feel heavier every second and making him completely forget about the tea patiently waiting for him in the kitchen and the fact that he was supposed to go back and bring Sherlock something to eat. He let sleep take over his body and focused on Sherlock for a moment, John's eyes were closed but he could still feel Sherlock's soft brunette curls against his arm.
You listened in mute horror. "No, no, no, no! Tell me nothing about him, nothing." His face went blank.
John offered you to join him in a fake newspaper interview with the brother and despite the lie, you noticed the determination you had to solve the case grew and wanted to see what Kenny Prince had to say for himself.
She didn't ask for any guarantees, just a promise he'd do his best, a promise of justice. Searching for eyes that speak with trust and surety. He froze and looked back at her with emotion as deep and sure as a piano note. A leaf flowing with a river. A salmon swimming upstream.
The last question directed at the man was about whether or not he had change for a cigarette machine. And after he replied that he didn't Sherlock decided it was time to go. You thought about asking him what the name of the company meant before leaving but stayed quiet. In an attempt at comfort you told yourself it was probably a part of their brand.
John knew it meant he solved the case and was already mentally preparing for the lecture he was about to endure...
"Perhaps." An awkward silence settled over them. The waiter came back with John's food a bit later and he started eating quietly. A few minutes passed before Sherlock spoke.
John quickly walked over to him - but not before rolling his eyes- and started muttering something about the importance of food and water, or something about the brain and oxygen, He wasn't really paying attention. After seeing he regained consciousness, John said to him "Bloody hell Sherlock, you need to take care of your body." and had to fight the urge to hit him with his leg.
Most of what he said boiled down to "we'll keep doing what he wants and try not to at the same time". Sherlock was clever, he seemed like he could stand a chance in the game. But there weren't even any set rules.
Your feet stopped you in front of a crosswalk whose light immediately turned red, so you stood there and waited for it to change. You checked your phone for a text from John but it failed to come, leaving you wondering about what transpired between him and Sherlock after you left. Somewhere in the city was another kidnapped person decked with explosives at the nonexistent mercy of a bomber slash general crime dealer. They might be sitting in a park full of children and old men feeding pigeons. Maybe they were in the police station. Maybe they were a cop. Maybe they had children.
“Child’s play. Coffee has clear signs of consumption that you lack. Your shirt was folded up until recently and the stain on it is fresh so the stain came from a drink that isn't coffee and the next best guess is tea. From your behavior, it was obvious you had something important in your back pocket. Your phone is in your hand and you wouldn't trust that pocket with your keys but any self-defense tool has to be easily accessible in times of crisis. I doubt you have the training for a small knife, ergo, pepper spray." Sherlock stopped to take a breath. "Now come on we have things to talk about and a crime scene to get to, I told Lestrade not to let anyone disturb it before I get there but you know how they get, chop-chop.”
A loud silence stretched out between you. Sherlock looked ecstatic. "Like a crime dealer..." you said. "Smart".
It went to the time before (y/n) came to the restaurant, when Sherlock was looking at him instead of the waiter. And to when they talked and Sherlock made himself vulnerable. It was so unlike him John's whole world centered on the detective, and it didn't stop until (y/n) arrived.
His words caught you off guard. There wasn't a camera anywhere when you checked. And did he just guess about the tea?
As Sherlock and John arrived at the cop-infested scene, the smell of salt and decay reached their noses and the already powerful wind got even more aggressive. Their shoes took up more and more layers of mud with each step.
"Of course you aren't." He said, slightly irritated. "Why would the great Sherlock Holmes pay attention to the basic needs of his body? You're human Sherlock, please start acting like one."
Sherlock sat down on a chair and leveled you with a blank expression. You realized you were currently taller than him. "Why not? Why what? Why do you need a reason."
Only Sherlock knew who he was. He knew who John was and who (y/n) was and even who the bomber was, in some twisted way. And Sherlock was no hero. Sherlock didn't waste time caring or crying. Sherlock spent his time being productive. He was trying to stop a criminal in the best way possible. If you're running late for a meeting you don't stop for ice cream or a big round lollipop.
The logic was clear to you, despite the fact that the poor blind woman had to spend those hours terrified. You didn't like it any more than John did but you left them to talk. John wanted to believe in Sherlock, it was clear to see.
"The Greeks had a lot of heroes, one of them was Theseus. What he did boils down to him using his enemies' weapons against them. You throw people off a cliff and into the mouth of your pet monster? he threw you off a cliff. You kill people with trees? he kills you with a tree." The only sound in the kitchen was the occasional car outside.
Number three - don't overthink not getting the job you interviewed for, and maybe get a different one at Mcdonalds.
You woke up first, or at least you didn't see anyone awake when you opened your eyes. The night carried you in and out of sleep and you kept forcing your consciousness down into the waters of slumber to try and gather up energy for the day to come.
Aside from the plaque Mr. Ewart's office didn't have anything memorable in it, but the smell reminded you of the way your house smells when you come back to it after a long vacation. The man looked tan himself, like he was back from one, and he was leaning in his chair as if he were facing the ocean in Hawaii and drinking from a coconut.
You and John exchanged a quiet look again. "Oh, there was a message left for Alex on the landline. Hold on I'll get it for you." A text came up on your phone from Sherlock once she left. It was of a painting hanging on a white wall. A dark blue starry sky hanging over a dark and gloomy city reflected in a river. You wordlessly showed it to John. The Lost Vermeer.
If you have suggestions or requests I would love to read them and until the next chapter, I hope you have an amazing day :)
Just then the front door opened and John climbed inside. "When you said you were going to hang a sign outside, naturally, I didn't think it would have a big colorful middle finger drawn on it!"
Also, breakup update: I went on a run today. I never run, but it was numbing in the best way possible.
John could've sworn Sherlock's hand was shaking then, not with fear, but with hesitation. Uncertainty. He awkwardly placed it on her back and then moved it to her shoulder. He immediately pulled it away when she jumped and slapped the note down on the table with a sharp sound. Sherlock looked at him with something that could've been desperation.
The bomber sent you that picture and broke into your home to hurt him. He didn't see you as you, he saw you as someone connected to Sherlock. A pawn.
After that moment at the restaurant, every lie Sherlock told, every time he insisted on not sharing his thoughts, every time he kept things to himself, and especially the time when he let that poor woman sit and wait in terror as he was getting ahead of the bomber just felt like a slap to the face. He wanted Sherlock to be better and not just for Sherlock's sake, but for his own. It was selfish but there was no point denying it.
It had a deep red carpet big enough to cover almost the entire living room floor and the walls in front of you were olive green. The place was dominated by warm tones blending with the morning sunlight. Two armchairs sat near the fireplace and a cluttered table was up against a wall and covered in books from the many bookshelves around it.
John sat down next to him so that their knees brushed against each other. His eyes were soft and pained as well. He looked well, pure. Passionate and intelligent and easy.
"What?" Lestrade asked, just as Sherlock knew he would, and after Sherlock kept talking cut him off again. "Wait wait wait wait wait, what painting? What are you on about?"
When the woman left again,  John's phone rang. At first, you thought that was from Sherlock too, but John said nothing of it until he finished reading.
"That sounds smart. But I can imagine it's challenging," your attempt at small talk made your insides cringe.
"In the morning when I left, I walked out and well- I was going to text my friend, as I told you, John, but I didn't know what to say and before I could do anything-" You took a deep breath and continued. "I was going to cross the road and the light turned red, at first I thought nothing of it but it wouldn't turn green, and then when I went to another crosswalk it turned red too, and then- well, this man was behind it. This black, shiny car pulled over next to me and this man threatened to make me come inside so I did and he tried to bribe me. He told me to spy on you and that if I did he'd protect me from that crime dealer and pay me. I said no of course."
The plot isn't gonna get all deep and depressed from now on (there will be emotions though), we will move past this and establish the relationship between the reader and everyone further while making her role clearer. And don't think I've forgotten about Mycroft ;)
They entered the cab, in which Sherlock was already waiting, and drove off into the night. When they arrived, it was to a narrow, damp street littered with puddles and, well, litter. Their breath came out in puffs and came in with the distinctive aroma of wet garbage. Sherlock started leading them, but John grabbed his shoulder and gave him a look that meant "we need to talk and I won't take another step until we do".
"Alright my office,'' Lestrade said and started walking, but John stopped Sherlock before he could follow. You knew what bothered him. Sherlock could've informed the bomber about the solution way before that, since he already knew what happened. But he decided getting on with other things was more important.
His text caught you in your house. Since the man was a detective you weren't surprised he got hold of your number.
The drive to baker street was long and you were all drained. Your stomach grumbled but you didn't have any food so there was nothing to do other than wait for the cab to arrive at its fixed destination. You were too exhausted to do anything else. A detached numbness engulfed you as your muscles buzzed with weakness and pulled you down with them.
"And this is connected to the painting, right?" (y/n) said. Sherlock paused for a moment to study her oddly shaken demeanor and didn't bother to look at Lestrade when the inspector spoke.
. John felt guilty before but now he felt like punching the stupid genius-detective. So this is Sherlock's payback? Forcing him through this? Sherlock says that he cares, but then decides to leave just to prove a point? Just to show John his "emotions" aren't enough to solve a murder? And he also whisks (y/n) into it, naturally. From the start, John worried about her joining, not because he didn't like her, but because she was like him. He punched the seat of the cab and then waved an apology at the poor driver.
"He does? He... does." Sherlock was talking to himself more than to you. "Thank you, (y/n) and I'm sorry."
Sherlock started pacing around the corpse. "The killer must've been interrupted, otherwise he would've stripped the corpse completely. There also used to be a badge or insignia on his shirt front that the killer tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognizable. Some kind of institution."
"I can usually cook but last night I barely got a chance to, you know. With everything." You were trying to divert the subject back to the overall threat. You needed a way to fight him and a better grasp of it all. Just the thought of it made your insides squirm.
It was natural, he was worried too, but some part of him constantly pined for the simplicity of battle and when it eventually came, he didn't mourn the peace. When it slipped like sand from his fingers he went on autopilot and fought to get it back.
You arrived at your own house sometime later and crashed into bed, your ears were still ringing and your arms hurt but you fell asleep in seconds.
He could feel Sherlock smiling triumphantly at him as he reluctantly moved him away from the couch and into his bedroom.
A few days after your first meeting with the man, you were on your way to meet Sherlock Holmes again.
"More precisely a Jewish folk story - gigantic man of clay, but also an assassin. Real name: Oscar Dzundza. One of the deadliest in the world. That is his trademark style." Sherlock pointed at the corpse.
"And you can't just-" he paused. Looked down for a bit, and then decided it wasn't worth finishing the sentence. "Is it him then? Moriarty."
You and the boys tackle the case of Connie Prince's suspicious death and you get a personalized message from our beloved bomber.
"I am sorry. I hurt you. I shouldn't have. I wanted you to understand how I feel and that blinded me, so I hurt you and I won't do it again."
He didn't know why he asked her about the night Andrew left. The obvious reason was to get more information, but the way Lucy's eyes shone with the distant memory of her fiance made something in John quiet down.
John refused to look at anyone but the floor. Whatever was in that envelope clearly hurt him. "What do you mean?"
I'm not 100000000000% sure how this is going to continue but I do know that I'm gonna add Johnlock in it and some scenes with the reader and Jim without anyone else.
You were scared, naturally. More scared than confused, or it could’ve been the other way around. Either way, scared and confused. Scared of getting involved, and baffled by the whole situation. You were needed in the man’s house? like to give a testimony? when you talked you thought you made it clear you being there was an accident. You got peckish after a job interview and stopped for a sandwich.
"Why would you do this to me? To us? When I first came here you said you wouldn't force me to join but I chose to join and now you do this? It's a bad thing to do you must know that."
Something in Sherlock's eyes grew softer. Soft like his curls, and his silk shirts, and the way he held his violin. Sherlock let all of his vulnerability show in his eyes, his eyebrows moved ever-so-slightly closer together and he blinked in such a human way it hurt. "Apology accepted, John," his voice was low.
. No wonder he just left the car and told the driver to take me wherever. God, I wanna punch him, I feared for my life."
With his gloves on. Sherlock deftly checked the body for clues. The shirt pocket was missing a patch of some sort. And was made from a very poor fabric, same goes for the trousers. His back was flabby but his legs and feet pointed to a lot of walking as well as sitting around being a part of his routine. His watch's alarm was set for a night shift a long time ago and was never changed, not due to lack of wearing.
"Hey," you took off one of your bandages, "if you're not too grossed out take this, gives you a reason to walk up to her"
"The explosion, which ripped through several floors, killing 12 people, is said to have been caused by a faulty gas main." The male reporter said. The elderly blind woman was murdered but naturally, the culprit did a good job at hiding it.
“I- hold on." He was saying so much the best you could do was try to keep up with him. You didn't even have time to process all that input, it was like he was trying to shove an aquarium in a shampoo bottle. "All that was, well, brilliant. But, How exactly do I come into this?” you asked.
"That is what this is for." The detective threw it in the air and caught it in his other arm, keeping his eyes on her. Instead of reacting, she just looked at him.
John gave you a confused look and you shrugged. When the woman came back inside she was holding the phone and pushed a button.
John wasn't sure what drove her to agree to stay at their place. Despite his detached restlessness he was exhausted from the day and just the ride to the flat gave him enough things to occupy his mind for weeks, so he was just glad they could help her.
Sherlock silently put his hand on yours. "I do, actually, know his game. He's spewing chaos cause he's bored, and probably a sociopath. I think he sees you as his hero, the person he's meant to fight, crush, toy with. He's smart, I guess he's bored of us "ordinary" people." You meant to speak badly of the bomber but it felt like you were insulting yourself as well.
The phone revealed an image of the Thames. Taken somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo. Sherlock announced this to John, who was looking down at his chair.
"If you still need change I have some," John said after putting the notepad he used for notes in his pocket and fishing his wallet out.
The reader is finally joining forces with the boys in the case of Ian Monkford and his bloody rental car. Also, the reader meets John, which is arguably more important.
“Ah, shame. Really could’ve gone for something interesting.” He sounded like he cared even less, but also like it gave him more energy, a bit more emotion showed on his face.
John nodded. They had some basic information and John let it roll around in his head, searching for something with the potential to be more. It wasn't anything new Sherlock found, it was related to something John had in his brain, hovering on the edge of his consciousness. They wouldn't look for the gallery manager and they clearly weren't headed to the gallery. John looked around in an attempt to extract more from his surroundings.
Connie Prince was 54 (despite the tv saying 48). She had a popular makeover show and has been dead for 2 days. According to Raoul de Santos from her staff, she cut her hand on a rusty nail, got tetanus bacteria in her bloodstream, and died.
You watched as his lips parted. You watched as he said hello again. You watched as Lestrade asked him what happened but you knew. She was gone.
He told you what he and Sherlock found at the morgue and you sent him all the relevant information you could find about the woman, her friends, and her family. The more important things were these:
1k words cause I wanted to get something out there. I'm starting to feel kinda insecure over this fic so if anyone has any strong opinions (good or bad) I'd love to hear them.
The man was now walking towards them and sat next to John on the couch that barely had any room left. He seemed to have decided that the conversation needed to go back to the subject of him again. "I don't know what I'm going to do now." You grabbed a notepad out of your pocket and scribbled something about a veil of tears and Connie's talent.
The metal felt cold in your palm and you shoved it in the keyhole. It refused to move. You tried twisting the other way that usually locked the door and it worked. But the door refused to open.
The cause for Dr. Watson's awkwardness was more worrying. The man was teetering on the border between rude and joking. And you weren't going to just let him ignore your feelings, ask some questions, and reduce you to feeling stupid for answering.
The sun filtered through the living room windows at 221 B Baker street and you watched as the dust appeared and disappeared through its beams. Visible and then gone once more, stuck in an endless routine of floating helplessly through the unknown.
John didn't like that. John didn't like a lot of things about Sherlock. He laughed without any humor and got up.
John stood with his fists against the back of his chair and Sherlock registered how the distance between them had grown while they talked. John still had that cold smile on his face as The pink phone chimed two pips.
John tried to fit all of that in his mind. He succeeded, but it wasn't enough. It wasn't nearly enough to solve the case and he was beginning to think that he wasn't enough either. He didn't reveal that to Lucy, who was sitting in front of him, and he conveniently left it out of all the recent chats he's had with himself as well.
Sherlock folded himself carefully from the wall and pulled a gun out of seemingly nowhere. (y/n)'s eyes stayed on it a bit longer than necessary, but she kept herself under control.
"Lestrade will text you the gallery attendant's address. Find out all you can about him." He turned around with his coat swishing behind him. "Best of luck to you!"
He looked Sherlock in the eyes and hesitantly reached his hand closer to where Sherlock's was on the table. When Sherlock's hand stayed put, he placed his on top of it.
"Erm," Sherlock gave him what he hoped to be an encouraging and earnest look and John kept talking. "Looks painful, deep. I suppose it would've bled quite a lot."
Number two - don't let your only role in the game be someone to hurt and manipulate. Or in other words: become a player.
"He's a difficult person so try not to take anything he does seriously. He's a bloody brilliant detective but that's where his good qualities end," John sniffed and seemed to reconsider his good qualities.
You couldn't remember locking the door, but a lot of the time the human brain gets on autopilot to do things it usually does. You might have locked it when you left and some other person got inside, but the evidence seemed to suggest otherwise. You weren't trying to convince yourself it was safe but sitting down made you feel like you already have. This could all be a mind trick you were playing on yourself, or it was a mind trick from the bomber.
"He was a nice guy, Alex. I liked him. He was uh... never much of a one for hoovering." She laughed sadly, and all you could do was try to laugh with her.
“Shame,” you copied. He pulled out his phone in one swift movement and sat next to you. Not because he wanted to, but just out of convenience. You were slightly uncomfortable. He didn’t seem to care about you now that he knew you weren’t some undercover assassin.
When you were finished with painting and everything was dry, you cut up some holes in the fabric and opened up a new roll of tape. It made a loud noise when you pulled some out and wound it through the holes and through the bars on the flat's window. It was a message. A sloppy, handmade, message for the bomber.
John knew him. He's been living with him, been on cases with him. Sherlock was a sociopath and John knew that. Yet he expected so much of him. Expects him to care, be kind, and soft and pathetic and... weak. Maybe not weak but he wanted Sherlock to be an angel or superhero.
Knowing Sherlock like John did meant that he noticed the infinitesimal change as the detective's eyes grew distant. "It's him. It's got to be. He's a crime dealer, he's the one who got the cabbie into crime it's bloody him."
"Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince, It was botulinum toxin." He said to Lestrade and the evening sky was showing through the window behind him. "We've been here before. Carl Powers. Tut-tut." A worried look at John - who was looking rather worried himself- confirmed that botulinum toxin was what killed Carl Powers too.
He invited you to join the Sherlock Holmes Hate Club where you meet every Wednesday and burn curly-haired voodoo dolls while Sherlock messed about with clear chemicals. When you reached the topic of how John had a limp when he and Sherlock first met, Sherlock's phone rang and you laughed at how obnoxious the sound was. That was until your eyes rested on the pink phone case.
John came into the office a few seconds after him. The office was dark and dimly lit, but the weak light inside it was warm and orange. After a brief conversation, Sherlock made a post on his website and immediately got a call on the pink phone. You were sitting on a chair by the desk while everyone else was around the laptop. Tension was written in every corner. In everyone's body language and faces. And in the air around them. Even in Sherlock's hand movement as he picked up the phone and his voice as he talked. He pressed the phone to his ear so the rest of you could only hear his side of the conversation.
The bomber was shaping the world into his own. Blowing up a building and injuring a civilian. Kidnapping a woman to communicate with him. And then using the murder of a young kid to toy with Sherlock. He turned people into pawns and then used the damage he caused to make the game more exciting. When the next call came he wasn’t surprised it was another stolen voice. A display of the bomber’s power.
And shockingly, the childish response was enough to convince John to give up on the couch and instead, carry Sherlock all the way to his bed.
Sherlock looked like a cat, proud and confident. Convinced of his worth. He spoke the whole time with charisma and enthusiasm and then proceeded to banish Lestrade so he could do his job and declare that they're going to get the bomber's attention and let him know the case was solved. He briskly turned to the exit and started walking with his coat waving behind him like a cape.
“Duality. If our bomber brings in people to establish dominance I see no reason why we shouldn’t. (y/n) is fairly clever and could be useful, besides I’m offering her a choice not sticking her in a car rigged to explode,” after a sharp inhale Sherlock continued, “we’re not dealing with an ordinary bomber.”
Sherlock said his reply in one breath. "Precisely. He'd grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle and wouldn't have it taken away from him. The cat doesn't come into this at all but Raoul's internet records do. I hope we can get a cab from here." Sherlock finished and kept walking despite John lingering behind.
After a while of talking back and forth and looking for information Sherlock gave up on the papers and phoned Lestrade, who informed him that on the south bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge, was discovered a dead body.
"I get where you're coming from I truly do," you told John," but I also get where he comes from. God, if I could choose to be like him..."
Your brain felt like a big tornado stuck behind a wall or a monstrous whirlpool stuck behind a dam. You knew your brain was a mess, to say the least, but the full might of it failed to reach your awareness.  It was like all your emotions were trapped behind a glass wall.
The first case was built around a pair of shoes that belonged to a kid whose death was the first Sherlock ever investigated. The kid was apparently killed by the bomber. And now he used the phone to send them a picture of a car which could lead to another case Sherlock had to solve or a hostage would go up in flames and take countless others with him.
When you came back with the sandwich they caught you up and decided to go see the body. There wasn't much debate about whether or not you'll be joining them. They asked you to go to your house and find information about the woman and you agreed without much thought. You only realized you didn't know what you were supposed to do with the information you found after the research and how to organize it when you were standing in front of your front door and looking for your keys.
That was enough for her brother to go inside and leave them alone. She gave him a slightly less sad look and moved to close the door.
"Yeah me too. But drop me off at your house before you kill someone, I'll show you what's in the bags and google Vermeer."
You couldn't tell who hung up. You didn't care either. It was hard, hearing the man talk. Everything got more real then. His image flashed through your brain. Having to carry explosives around with him like parasites. Unable to save himself and forced to depend on an absolute stranger. Where could he have been? It was more public than the previous hostage. A park? Busy street? It couldn't be another car because of the background noise and it couldn't be a bus since a man riding a bus for 8 hours would look suspicious. Unless the bomber was confident Sherlock would solve the case in less than that.
