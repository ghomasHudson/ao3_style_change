John pursed his lips, half for a show and half to stop himself from laughing as the forensic scientist leant forwards with interest, and pointing at the pale stretch of sunlight that Sherlock had been walking towards.
The genius did as told with some loud sniffing and dramatic huffs, "'onestly John, what're you even fussin' about-"
" Greg exclaimed as soon as the judge had left the room, jumping up and dragging his lawyer into a ferocious hug.
Next to him, Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes, "Oh please, John, she wants us to meet her boyfriend, it obvious. How does tomorrow night sound? He could stay for dinner?"
The genius eyed him suspiciously, the dark look somewhat lessened by the puffy eyes and running nose, before reluctantly sitting up and taking the hot drink.
Willa was four months and had figured out how to roll. Unfortunately, she had decided nighttime was the perfect time to practice this skill. Luckily for John he was off the day following the worst of the nights.
John snorted inelegantly but wasn’t surprised. Sherlock never learned to hide his reaction to Captain Watson. “You liked that, did you?”
Sherlock looked up at John. He wanted to say something to calm him down, to reassure him. To remind him that sometimes the littlest details were the ones that solved the case. But he was worried it might set John off even more.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him in the camera but was unwilling to say anything about the blatant lie in front of Willa.
Thank you everyone for all the comments! I literally get so excited when I see the email and then I look at them while writing as encouragement. True story. So thank you.
“Is Sherlock coming?” Willa asked as they walked towards one of the small cafés she enjoyed so much.
"I didn't do this!" Harry shouted before remembering herself and where she was. She took a deep breath and lowered her voice, "this was you, I know it."
The air during the assembly was oppressive even before Doctor Drescher had said a word. The teachers did their best to keep themselves composed but even Doctor Drescher’s eyes were rimmed red, obviously having cried over the news. Willa sat in John’s lap and held Sherlock’s hand in hers, she could read the tension in all of the adults.
Harry looked distraught. “No! But I know how you can be when you think someone is wrong you just don’t give in. You’re so stubborn and-”
John let Willa have a cookie for dessert and treated himself to a glass of wine, a sort of pat on the back for a job well done.
“This man,” Sherlock said turning to look at John, or rather his chin for as close as they were, “he’s being careful with her, or at least more than we’d expect. He’s clearly uncomfortable with the fact that she’s a child.”
He’d gotten the idea on New Year’s Day when Willa asked John for an assortment of farm animals. She’d told him later that they’d had a goldfish once and all she wanted was another pet so when John said no to one she’d ask for a different animal.
Greg was fairly confident in the fact that he was probably the only person on Earth to have ever seen Mycroft Holmes in such a state. This knowledge caused a little bit of warmth to invade the chill that had been residing in Greg's insides since they'd found out that Willa was missing.
Greg got to the gift first and carefully carried it back down the stairs while Mycroft followed with his phone, which had appeared for the first time since he’d gotten to Baker Street, to his ear nearly shouting at whoever was on the other end.
It wasn’t much but Sherlock was thrilled for anything, a tiny scrap of information. Now they just had to go out and find one of his homeless contacts who’d know why the camp from this building had been forced to leave if it was the Yard’s doing.
“Moriarty… the bombs… the security guard...” Greg spat out random words until a look of comprehension crossed Mycroft’s face. “He was found here, right here,” he gestured out towards the banks were dozens of police were milling about.
Molly tamped down on the urge to yell back, “so instead you’d rather them find out that you knew and allowed them to walk around with false hope for how long?”
Their table by the window was open and a candle was already there. Both John and Willa slid into the bench seat so their backs were to the street. Sherlock smiled fondly as he sat, it was a little like the first night he and John had eaten here. With a bit of an addition of course.
Mycroft stood in front of what John assumed was a one way mirror. There was a man on the other side handcuffed to a chair, his nose was broken and his left eye swollen shut. Sherlock stood in a corner his back to the mirror.
Willow dropped her heels back down and tried to scowl at Janine. “I don’t like it,” she said before holding up the ball of her clothing. “What am I supposed to do with these?”
“Why would I take fashion advice from a five-year-old who insists stripes and polka dots are perfectly acceptable together?”
“Here’s her things… probably enough for a week.” John said as he put the bags on the table. “I haven’t checked her bag but please check and see if she has homework.”
Typically, Sherlock and Irene in a room left John feeling uncomfortably aroused because he’d be the first to admit that their displays of wit ridiculously turned him on. Today though, he had no time or patience for them. He had no time to sit back and enjoy the peacocks strutting about fanning their impressive plumage of intelligence.
“Oh is the great Sherlock Holmes ticklish?” John teased letting his head be tilted back so he could look at Sherlock.
Greg shrugged and continued, thumbs pressing firm circles into the base of Mycroft's neck, "it is for me."
“Correct.” Sherlock agreed and then handed her the sealed box of baking soda. They proceeded to discuss what effect it would have on the texture of the cakes.
Sherlock had quietly followed John from Harry’s hospital room. There was something about Harry’s story that bothered him. She hadn’t been lying when she told them what had happened, things had likely gone exactly how she said.
“You wanted to fuck me then.” Sherlock whispered, a touch of disbelief in his voice. He dipped his head back into John’s neck.
“No.” John agreed. “He just thinks Mason takes after Hayley. I honestly thought today after meeting Rosie he might get suspicious but he’s so madly in love with her I don’t think he’ll ever figure it out.”
Greg looked down at the mobile and nodded, at least now he’d have a somewhat valid reason for seeking them out.
Janine, who’d been saying something to him, turned midsentence, “fine, go on. Just pour water in when you’re done, won’t flush otherwise.”
“Just spend Christmas Eve with Willa and I okay? You don’t have to do anything on Christmas day if you don’t want but I promise it won’t be like that.” John explained. Sherlock wondered if he was aware that he was very nearly holding his hand in the middle of a public street.
Sherlock sighed, loudly, but Rosie chose that moment to begin wiggling in her father’s arms. John let her down and they wandered lazily after her as she explored the park. She was still unsteady on her feet and every little slope or change in terrain led to her falling onto her bottom.
Harry wondered what the hell John was talking about ‘things she didn’t need to know’. She was about to argue with him but he was already turning away from her. “We need to tell Greg.” He said to Sherlock, his tone softer with him than it had been with her.
It wasn’t a question but Sherlock nodded anyway. “I’ve interrogated dozens of people, John. Not once have I needed a handler, I knew my limits and never had any desire to step over them…”
She told Sherlock of her hip replacement and to his delight explained the surgery in detail. She asked him about where he’d been and he tried to tell her but kept the details to a minimum, he was never sure exactly which actions had been sanctioned by the government and it wouldn’t do to make Mrs. Hudson an accomplice in an international incident.
John snorted and rolled his eyes at the ceiling while Sherlock’s face very nearly broke into a genuine smile, something he avoided in front of cameras.
“John.” Sherlock said softly. He wasn’t even sure what to say to that, the mental image of what had been done to Willa was too much for him to look at too closely.
“Alright. I’m going.” John said and leaned forward to kiss him once again. Willa skillfully darted away from the kiss he meant to plant on her.
Sherlock followed John into the kitchen. “Would you honestly have shot a man in broad daylight in front of your daughter?”
John seemed just as dismayed by the whole room. Lestrade was lingering a floor below talking to some people, no doubt smoothing feathers and giving them time to look around.
Mycroft took over that job for him, thankfully. “John, this is more than you had ten minutes ago.” He reminded him in a placating tone.
John was surprised to hear his name pulled into it. Willa’s eyes darted up to John and she beamed at him. “Thank you, daddy, this is the best gift
“Out, I have to meet with someone.” Sherlock informed her, he reached out and pushed some the loose hair away from her face.
The food kept sticking in her throat and she wanted to gag. She'd always hated the taste of artificial cherry, so much so she'd thought she hated cherries. She thought that up until last summer when Daddy had taken her to the beach. They'd stayed in a little cottage right by the shore, and one dad Daddy had bought a small basket of cherries. He'd chased her around playfully until she agreed to try one.
Though he didn’t know precisely where they were heading, Sherlock did know that there were only a handful of neighborhoods to choose from. The kinds of areas where no one asked questions or spoke to the police about strange happenings. It was still much too extensive a list to give to John.
“Don’t. Also you don’t even get this paper why are you on here?” Sherlock questioned as he gestured to the screen.
There was a dull thud from behind Sherlock and when he turned he found John kneeling on the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut. John claimed not to be as bright as Sherlock but had almost as quickly reached the same conclusion he had.
“Do you regret going?” Sherlock asked feeling guilty. His ignorance of the press had led to him putting them in a compromising position.
He felt more relaxed for the rest of the evening. John kept grinning and reaching over to squeeze his hand every few minutes.
John groaned. “Every year she insists on a Christmas day photo of Willa and I.” He whispered to Sherlock before setting down the bag of gifts.
He looked around only to discover both Greg and Irene were still there, both watching them. Greg’s face was written over with concern and exhaust, but Irene’s was impossible for John to decipher. His hatred of her flared in his chest.
She crawled into the space he had just vacated. “Good King Wenceslas.” She told him her tongue tripping over a few of the syllables.
That was why she was at work, nearly a month before she was meant to come back from maternity and the day after her niece had gone missing, she felt as though she had something to prove. She’d thought about calling in and staying home cuddling Teddy but it just didn’t sit right with her, the fact that she could choose to stay home with her child while John and Sherlock were without theirs. So she’d come in.
Mycroft had a point and Sherlock hated to admit it. Sherlock himself would never allow strangers near Willa, especially since in the past many of them had turned out to be dangerous. John would never go for photos of murders hanging on the wall anymore. He would need somewhere else before opening business again.
Willa didn’t sit but began fluttering near the edge of the sofa obviously dying for a look at the baby. John exchanged a look with Molly.
As he heard the jogger approach, his backpack bouncing noisily with his stride, Sherlock leaned down and picked Willa up.
Sherlock hummed against his throat. “I don’t know, you say all kinds of things in bed.” His voice was muffled by John’s skin but it sent vibrations down his spine.
Irene smiled placidly at them, Sherlock growled at her while John pulled away from Lestrade and stomped into the kitchen. Sherlock heard the sounds of tea being made violently and he took a breath to calm himself. “Why are you even here, Irene?”
“It’s allergies.” John pronounced after he’d done his check of Willa. “She’s headed towards a sinus infection, hence the headache, but until it gets there I won’t treat for it.”
Originally it had been vandalism and minor shoplifting but as she’d gotten older and found herself in the world of alcohol she’d found herself arrested for more and more things. But still, the most serious offense had been assaulting a police officer as he attempted to secure her a ride home one night after she’d gotten excessively drunk.
“So you cheated because she was boring?” John asked and found himself not surprised. “What? Did she find out so you killed her?”
“Oh, have they? That’s nice.” John called back absently. He paused then and glanced at the calendar. “Wait over Valentine’s Day?”
Once Molly left John considered interrupting them but chose instead to start dinner. Whatever was upsetting Sherlock was probably not anything Willa needed to hear them discuss.
David was too busy taking dozens of photos of his dirt bike to be too upset that he couldn’t ride it yet.
John let out an exasperated sigh and to her left a tea cup slid out of Sherlock’s hands. He fumbled with it, spilling tea all over the rug, but he managed to keep the cup from shattering on the floor.
The girl was hesitant to leave her father but she stepped forward anyway. Obviously still shy of adults she didn’t know and looked to John to assure her she was okay. Despite her initial hesitation as soon as John gave her more encouragement she dutifully walked over to Sherlock, obviously John’s bravery had been inherited.
Willa did not stop talking about Teddy the entire trip home. Though the question John had been bracing himself for did not make an appearance until the middle of dinner.
Aaron and Molly locked eyes. John could see that they both wanted to take him up on his offer but were worried about leaving their son.
Harry, unlike John, had never been able to fall asleep just anywhere. At least sober. Drunk she could, and often did, pass out where she stood waking up several hours later where she'd fallen. Sober, she was relegated to lying on her side looking out as the night passed by her window. The nurses and doctors didn't help either.
“Your brother is gone. Is he dead yet I wonder? Hmm?” John snapped unable to listen to platitudes about Sherlock.
“I was thinking we could go for a walk.” John said as Sherlock opened the refrigerator looking for something to eat.
As he rolled over he saw that Sherlock was hard. John reached out at hand to touch him but then Sherlock slapped it away, hard.
Greg had been called to the scene but it was clear there’d been no foul play. Only a tragic accidental hanging. Greer Fisher had to be taken away and treated for shock.
Greg made mental notes of where Sherlock was pointing so he could direct forensics there. “So someone knocked Harry out and-”
“I worried about the normal things. Like her waking up and being scared even though she knew Molly, of her getting hurt or sick but I also worried Mary would somehow know I wasn’t there and kidnap her.” John continued.
“The point is seeing family every now and then.” John said and poked him. When Sherlock opened his mouth to protest John cut him off. “Seeing them when it’s completely unrelated to working.”
Sherlock looked startled at that but then whatever was going on inside that brilliant brain of his caused the look to soften. “I love her too.”
“Is everything alright?” Sherlock asked, he was watching her in that way that made her feel entirely transparent.
That brought John up short, Sherlock nearly collided with his back. “Not fatally.” He said eventually. “And
John wondered what the chances were that Sherlock would guess what they were up to by Saturday evening. He’d already made all the plans and decently covered his tracks, there were no clues on his mobile or computer, and he doubted Mycroft would spill the news.
“We should clean up before that happens.” Sherlock suggested and began working to untangle himself from John.
With her courage renewed she began speaking again. “I wanted to ask you if you wanted to adopt me, to become my Papa.” She finished quickly.
Sherlock nodded and pulled out a note from his pocket, as he handed it over he felt a piece of paper slide back into his. He stuffed it into his coat.
Sherlock hated the feeling of not knowing, of not being able to tell John definitively that yes, this was to do with Willa.
If it had been forever since he’d had sex, it had been even longer since he’d given head. He focused on the sounds Sherlock made for guidance, pressing his thumbs into the joint at his hips keeping him still. The first time he tried to thrust up into John’s mouth he let out a sharp whine of pain but it didn’t keep him from trying again.
“Alright but you’re going to be a nightmare to get into bed tonight.” His voice was low and he spoke directly into John’s ear.
Sherlock was about to say something when John crooked his finger and expertly found his prostate. Sherlock moaned, hips arching off the mattress. “That is, fuck, cheating.” He managed between gasps.
“No but Reinette is brighter than even you know, all children are. It’s when we teach them that they don’t know anything that they truly don’t.” Mycroft answered.
On Tuesday they’d moved to another room. This one had reception. He managed an entire hour before texting Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t seem to mind though and kept the conversation going, the only major gap between texts was when he went to pick Willa up. Willa then somehow ended up with the phone and spent an hour texting John, refusing to answer when he called.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I will make sure I’m available so you can go spend your days in Cardiff.”
“Now Willa has offered to share her party with Sherlock and since I know we’ll never pin him down to sing separately we’re just going to sing to them both.” John announced loudly and to everyone.
“Despite my best attempts to keep myself detached your exile caused me a great deal of grief and Gregory was there to pick up the pieces.” Mycroft explained tonelessly.
He spent the entirety of the next day thinking. He was close to solving the case and that was good, the sooner he solved it the sooner he could worry about the weekend. It was more difficult than he’d imagined, trying to solve this case and plan for Valentine’s Day at the same time.
They sat quietly for some time, the silence only broken by the sound of John slowly draining his mug. Once he’d finished, John was the one to break the silence. “Mary didn’t know.”
In case you didn't get the joke because I've been informed my humor is not always obvious the 'unspoken inferences' about Lestrade and dolphins is that dolphins are notoriously horny animals, draw from that what you will.
At 9:03 just as he was dressing after his shower his computer began ringing. John smiled when he saw an incoming video call from Sherlock.
He traced his tongue around the base, pressing firmly. John’s fingers twitched in his hair. Sherlock continued to lick and kiss and suck around John’s cock until John was panting rocking unsteadily on his feet. He was muttering Sherlock’s name amid a string of incoherent syllables.
Twenty minutes later Molly appeared, followed by another staff member, carrying folding chairs. John was promptly deposited in the first one that was set out. Sherlock sat next to him. Molly took a seat next to Sherlock and Lestrade next to John. Mycroft didn’t move from the wall.
In August Gregory Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes married in the back gardens of Mycroft’s large home. John hadn’t even been aware they were engaged when Mycroft asked him to stand with him at the altar. Willa was unaware her dress probably cost more than all of her other clothes combined and that during the reception she was running about with the children of some of the most influential people in the world.
Sherlock smirked at John’s reaction and peppered soothing kisses over the spot he’d just scraped. John’s fingers twitched into the muscle of Sherlock’s shoulders.
John was suddenly grateful he’d deleted or edited all the posts involving Mary when he had decided to let Willa read his original blog. He didn’t want any new clients to connect him to her.
“You used to like getting away for training.” Sherlock reminded him though starting to lose interest in the topic.
So after talking himself out of a blind panic Sherlock had begun looking at the message for codes. It certainly wasn’t a skip code and after some examination there didn’t appear to be any hidden meaning behind the words.
Sherlock had, despite having no real grasp of the solar system, seemed to know exactly which telescope he wanted to purchase so John had left him to it and looked for books.
Willa nodded solemnly as she went about setting up her equipment. “Mr. West says it’s important to experiment with things because otherwise we won’t learn how it all works.”
She laughed at him and reached over to pat his hand. “Of course not. It’s not like I can’t just pop upstairs for a visit with her.”
“Is that what you think this is?” Sherlock was more than a little hurt that John seemed to think that he would bore of him so easily. As if Sherlock, hadn’t been in love with him since before he faked his death.
“Look.” John said in an effort to reassure them. “We’ve got nowhere to be for the rest of the day. I’d rather be helpful than sitting around at home.” He grinned then and nodded to his daughter. “Besides at this rate she’ll be hogging him for the rest of the day.”
They played together for the first few songs and everyone was impressed. After breaking away from holiday songs Sherlock shot John a mischievous look. John nodded with a smirk. He broke away from the melody.
Molly and Aaron arrived first at nearly five. Greg was next but he was alone, Willa looked about ready to cry until he reassured her Mycroft would be there before dinner. Mrs. Hudson was next, coming right up from wherever she’d been shopping, gift bag in hand.
“I doubt most children look at their cupcakes, rather just shove them in their faces. Hannah Miller sounds like a braggart.” Sherlock told him.
John chuckled at the mental image of Willa getting red sauce in her hair, at least it wouldn’t look too out of place.
Willa groaned. “Make them? Can’t we buy them? Hannah Miller’s cupcakes were from a bakery and they had sugar flowers on them.”
“Mycroft has nothing.” Sherlock admitted and John’s shoulders immediately dropped and he tilted his head up towards the sky. He was desperately blinking away tears.
Sherlock didn’t want to mention the brother, instead he angled for Lestrade’s heartstrings. “Noah was Willa’s friend.”
The smell of coffee and takeaway Thai food was what eventually woke Mycroft, which was confusing as he knew he hadn’t ordered anything. He blinked awake to find Gregory placing those exact items on his desk, he was taking extra care to not actually put anything on the various papers that were stacked there. Mycroft’s heart stuttered for a moment in his chest, reminded how much he loved the other man.
The only good thing the press had done was to renew public interest in Sherlock as a consulting detective.
John was reluctant to hand it over but he knew he had to. He carefully placed it into the evidence bag that Greg held out taking care in folding in the sleeves so that the rest of the hair didn’t fall out.
“I’ll call you if I change my mind.” Sherlock jumped out the car before Simon could get hold of his hand again. He strolled over to the driver’s side and bent down. “Thanks for a lovely day.”
John shut his eyes. He move closer and raised his head looking him in the eye. “You don’t have to buy me anything.” His lips parted as if he wanted to speak but instead of saying something, he slipped the tip of his tongue out, licking his lower lip while drowning in Sherlock green-blue eyes.
After he finished his lunch, he glanced at his watch. “I have still ten minutes left, but we can go now if you’re in a hurry.”
“People die all the time, smoking or non-smoking,” Sherlock said before he turned around and drew another breath of smoke.
A day later, there was another body found in the basement parking. Greg phoned Sherlock, informed him about it, but he was at the lab and was unable to accompanied him.
He kept on pondering about the boy on his way to the parking area. He got into his car and drove off.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “No, not that. I was wrong to think Greg was the dominant one in your relationship.”
Greg crossed his arms in front of him. “How did you know about the ring? I took it off a month ago.” He examined his ring finger. “If you look closely you can still see the mark, but not from where you’re sitting.”
Greg glanced at the two brothers. “Would you excuse me for a second,” he said, stood up and left the table.
He turned around to look at him. “I’m going nowhere, I promise. Enjoy it.” He turned back and while repositioning himself on the couch, his tiny PT shorts moved up exposing his slender, but well-formed, upper thighs.
“No, he’s a lab analyst with deduction skills,” Greg answered on behalf of Sherlock. “Tell them about the extra clues you found.”
He frowned when he let go. “I am capable to carry heavy things,” he said while following him to the bathroom.
He grabbed his phone out of his coat pocket and dialed Mycroft’s number. “I want to see you. Yes, my flat in two hours.” He rolled his eyes. “No, not now, I’m on my way to Brixton, there’s been another murder… oh, but you ought to know about that.” He dropped the call and shoved the phone back in his pocket.
Sherlock crawled on the padded floor. Sometimes he lay on his back staring without blinking. He talked to himself waving his hands and arms in the air. A day later, he noticed the cameras high up on the wall. After receiving his food, he threw it at the cameras.
He arched a brow when he felt the bulge in John’s trousers growing bigger. “Oh, I can feel you want me.”
Sherlock took out his wallet and opened it. “Where’s the tablets, Whitey. If you run with my money, I’ll hunt you down.”
Simon pulled him up. “Come let me show you how gentle I am,” he whispered before leading him down the corridor to the master bedroom. He made Sherlock sit down on the bed and sat astride him. He started to kiss the side of his neck. “Don’t be scared,” he whispered and continued to kiss his neckline. Simon shut his eyes when he became aware of the growing bulge underneath him. His lips came down on Sherlock’s mouth. Without forcing, he welcomed his tongue inside his mouth.
Out of breath, he fell down on the bench, grabbed his milkshake and took a mouthful. “When did you return?
Tears welled up while a sharp pain gnawing on the inside of his decaying heart. He shut his eyes, allowing the music to drench his soul, masking the hurt. He should’ve died that day. How could he trust anyone again? He would never make the first move again. Neither would he ever allow anyone to touch him again.
Simon grabbed his arm and pulled him back on his lap. “I don’t want someone else, I want you, Sherlock. Don’t you understand? I love you.”
The ringing of his cell phone drew his attention. “Lestrade,” he answered. He smiled. “Hello love. Yes, he just left with a taxi.” He smiled again. “I told you last night your brother is impressive.” His face dulled. “Don’t be silly. Why would I leave you for him?” He glanced at his watch. “I have to go. Will I see you tonight?” He nodded. “I’ll be home at five. Greg smiled once again as he put his phone away while walking back to his office.
Professor Linder nodded. “Oh, yes of course.” He turned back to the blackboard and rolled his eyes. He made a complete fool of himself in front of the students.
As promised, he dropped the musical room’s keys off before eight that morning and rushed to be in time for his first class.
He stopped struggling and sighed. “I can’t do this. I told you, you were going to hate me one of these days.”
He shook his head slowly before he turned to him and drowned in the boy’s green-blue eyes. With difficulty, he removed his gaze and returned it to the front. “You did a great job. Even I couldn’t have done it with that speed.”
Andrew charged forward and caught up with him before he could enter the room. He grabbed him by the arm and flung him to the floor.
John jumped out of the chair, his face red with anger. “You faked your own death and let me mourn for two years believing you were dead,” he yelled.
He took a deep breath when he stepped outside into the cool London night air. Why was he so attracted to this woman? John used to be on his mind all the time, but now… He sighed as he trotted towards the main road.
“It’s Willa. Sit down. I will get you a violin.” She disappeared into a room at the back and returned with a violin case. “I prefer that my students have their own violins, but I do make exceptions.” She gave it to him and started his first lesson by telling him the names of the different parts of the violin. “This may seem like useless information, but it is important. Now stand up.”
Professor Linder passed the music room on his way home, when he noticed the light was still on. He glanced through the window and smiled. He opened the door and gazed at the beautiful man. “Mister Holmes, I didn’t know you played the violin?”
Sherlock smiled faintly. “Holmes, Sherlock Holmes.” He turned away, searched for an open desk and strolled towards it.”
Mike grabbed it from her. He scrolled down the contacts, found Mycroft’s number and dialed it. “Hello, no it’s Mike. He left his phone at the lab. That’s not why I’m calling. Something’s wrong with him. He doesn’t focus on his work and he doesn’t eat. You should see how thin he is.” He ended the call and gave the phone back to Linda. “He will send someone to collect the phone.”
Sherlock didn’t even notice he was gone until he returned with Willa next to him. He stopped playing and glanced at the two of them.
The lector lowered his hand and turned to him. His gasped when he laid eyes on the tall slender student with the ruffled black curly hair. He gaped at him. The man had a pair of cheekbones any women would envy. He looked like a boy with his flawless pale skin. He couldn’t be older than nineteen.
Sherlock put the violin down. “Damn him and damn Jim Moriarty,” he said and flopped next to John on the couch. “I thought she looked familiar when I saw her. She has his eyes, his smile.”
John blinked a few times when he became aware of water running down his legs. His eyes enlarged when he noticed the sink had overflowed. “Oh fuck,” he cried out and shoved the chicken aside to drain the water.
Anderson was already inside, discussing a forensics report with Lestrade. He rolled his eyes when he noticed Sherlock. “Oh god,” he mumbled. “Coming to solve another case, Mister Detective wannabe?”
Sherlock turned to him. “If he is the killer, I will help you with your other cases.” He lowered his arm when a taxi stopped next to him. He opened the door and glanced back at Greg. “Your cases, my time, free of charge. Afternoon, Detective Inspector.”
Sherlock stayed in hospital for another two weeks before his doctor discharged him. He never told anybody what actually happened to him that day, neither did he pressed charges against professor Marks.
He knocked off at five and found Molly in the hospital foyer when he was on his way out. “Thank you for letting me know about the body.” He didn’t wait for a reply and hurried past her.
“No dear, he called Molly to find out if she has any fresh cadavers.” She grimaced while her body shuddered.
John shook his head while waiting for his throbbing heart to calm down. “No, it can’t be,” he muttered.
When John entered the flat, he found Sherlock on his back on the couch with his eyes shut and his hands together in front of his face. He raised a brow before he stepped into the kitchen and put the shopping bag on the table. “I met you brother just now,” he said while emptying the bag. He frowned, let go of everything and walked back to the living room. “Did you hear me? I said I met your brother.”
Simon jumped off the bed. He caught up with him, threw his arms around him and held him tight. “I am not that monster from Liverpool who hurt you.”
Sherlock passed his final year exams successfully. After graduation, he moved into a tiny bachelor flat Mycroft had organized for him. With a biomedical science degree in hand, his brother also found him a position at St. Bartholomew hospital’s laboratory.
The professor held his hands up. “Fine, I won’t. Just calm down.” He gaped at the young man, before he followed him to the door.
Andrew glared at him. He snorted. “You have a brilliant mind. Now you want to throw it away with this gay shit.”
As soon as he took a seat on the couch, a text message came through. He glanced at the screen and smiled, reading the message.
He took place next to his brother again. “Dear Missis Hudson, she said if I ever needed a flat I can call her anytime. Well, I need a bigger flat.”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged. Before he could jump up, the professor fell on top off him, pinning him down. “No,” he cried out.
Mike moved his chair backwards and stood up. “I’m going for lunch, do you want something form the café?”
Sherlock took his coat and scarf off, hung it behind the door before he stepped into the living room and dropped onto his chair.
John grabbed one of the biscuits and dunked it in the tea. “Do you want me to help you solving cases again?”
The newspaper lay on the table next to him as usual. He traced the headline letters with his fingers.
He sighed when he pushed the empty bowl backwards. He didn’t finish his wine, stood up and took the brown paper bag with burger and chips inside. He left enough money on the table and left the diner.
Sherlock stared at his professor until he disappeared. He shut the door, opened the brown paper bag and glanced inside. Not hungry, he ate only a few chips. He put the rest of it with the burger back in the bag.
Sherlock gazed at him and smiled. “You, John Watson, keep me right.” He kissed him on the cheek and stood up.
Sherlock snorted. “Oh, please don’t.” He sighed. “I’m not the person you think I am, Simon. You might hate me if you see me more often.”
He rolled his eyes – so much for a cold shower. He suppressed another sigh while placing his other hand on Sherlock’s head, brushing his fingers through the ruffled black hair, twirling the curls around his fingers.
After deducing professor Linder a few times, he became aware of the professor’s feelings for him and agreed to meet him for coffee. Although his deductions were never wrong, he remained skeptical and chose the university coffee shop for their meeting.
Professor Linder strolled down to the front and checked his watch. He sighed, still another thirty minutes to go. Why was this lecture taking so long today?
He drew his lips in a thin line. “Father asked me to keep it to myself.” Mycroft noticed the surprised look on his face. “Yes, he cheated on Mummy thirty years ago.”
Sherlock held his hands up. “Don’t ask me,” he said while cutting him off mid-sentence. “Neither my brother nor my parents know the story.”
Sherlock was losing sleep of the uppers he popped regularly. He didn’t eat and lost a lot of weight. He sat in front of the computer, staring at the screen, the words swimming in front of his eyes.
He smiled faintly while nodding. “I better get back to my studies.” He held the violin out to her. “Thank you.”
“I better get a move on. This table is getting to soppy for my liking.” He moved his chair backwards and stood up.
Sherlock visited the professor more often at home. Simon found it more and more difficult to keep the promise he made with each visit. Sherlock wakened feelings inside him he never thought existed. The sexual tension building up frustrated him. Each time after a visit, he had to speed back home, to take a cold shower after dropping him at the flat – but not today, not tonight. Sherlock agreed to stay over for the weekend.
“Look at his wedding ring. It’s fitting tight around his finger and the gold is fading, not sparkling like a new ring. He’s married about ten years, maybe longer. If she’s his wife, she had to be fifteen when they got married.”
He smiled, put out the cigarette butt and walked closer. “Sherlock Holmes,” he said and held out his hand.
Sherlock stopped firing and turned around. “I’m bored,” he answered, turned back and fired another shot at the wall.
John stayed with him until five the next morning. He crawled out from under his head and shut the door after he left the room. He returned to his bedroom, dropped down on the bed and fell asleep.
Sherlock jumped up when his phone rang. “No I’m not busy,” he answered. “Be there right away.” He turned to John. “Do you want to go with me to a crime scene?”
He held his breath as he searched for the light switch on the wall. When he found it, he raised the mop and flipped the light on while yelling. “Who are you?” He dropped the mop on the floor and gaped at John wearing his coat.
He gasped aloud when John thrust his erected cock into him, repeatedly, each time harder than before. “Oh my god,” he cried out of enjoyment. “I’ve waited a long time for this.”
“I noticed the chicken in your shopping bag while you were in my car. I figured it was dinner and asked him to buy white wine instead of red.”
He stood up, sat astride John and pushed him backwards. “I love you, John, but I’m not ready for more than what we have.” He fell on top of him and kissed him.
The sun had already set. It was almost dark, but there was still enough light to try and figure out where he was.
Sherlock jumped up as well. “I tried to explain, but you didn’t want to listen. I did it to protect you.”
He kissed his new bride on the cheek, put his hand on her pregnant belly and smiled. “Keep the little guy safe and don’t exhaust yourself while I’m going to check on Sherlock.”
Sherlock regained consciousness. He reached out to his throbbing head and shrieked with pain when he touched the side of his face. He became aware of the cold hard floor underneath him. Where was he? He tried to stand up, stumbled and bumped his head against a wall. “Help,” he called out. Somebody had to come and help him up. He struggled to focus. Unable to familiarize himself with the surroundings he shut his eyes.
The psychiatrist nodded. “Did he ever denied or admitted to your accusation of him being a prostitute?”
He snorted. “What? No Sherly man, I will never run with your money. The tablets are in my pocket.” He took out a sachet with the five small tablets inside and laid it on the palm of his hand. “There, you believe me now?”
Sherlock was in his last year of school when the company his father worked for relocated to Liverpool and they had to move. He wanted to remain in London with his brother, but his parents refused. Little did he know Mycroft was the one behind it.
Sherlock jumped up when the door shut. He took the violin case out of the cupboard, locked his door and rushed over to the music room.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “Thank you for the tea and biscuits, Missis Hudson. Close the door on your way out.”
“I’m old enough to look after myself. I don’t need a babysitter.” Sherlock stormed to his bedroom and slammed the door shut. He fell down on his bed and buried his face in the pillow.
The truck driver hooted when she drove past him. He put the truck in gear and drove off, following them.
He preferred that they slept in John’s bedroom. He loved his manly smell that was all over the room and in his bed. He felt safer there as well.
She accompanied him to the door and remained standing in the doorway, waving him goodbye after he got into a taxi.
After they unloaded the shopping bags, he showed Sherlock his room before taking him for a tour through the house.
Several hours later, Sherlock opened his eyes. “Where am I?” he mumbled. “What are you doing here?” he asked when he noticed Mycroft.
Sherlock took a taxi the next day to meet with Greg at New Scotland Yard. After going through the case files, he took him to the crime scene at an old house in Brooklyn.
Mycroft made a rule to visit his brother on a regular basis to keep an eye on him and to see if he coped. Sherlock stayed drug free and picked up the weight he lost.
Simon walked him to the bed and fell down on it with him. “Calm down. You’re going nowhere.” He didn’t relax his grip.
After explaining to them that the deceased was one of their guests, he accompanied them to the lift and down to the basement parking.
He woke an hour later with a stiff neck and sore back. He had to stay awake until he was finished. If he had only one tablet, it would see him through. He glanced at his watch, jumped up and put on his coat before he left.
John and Mary returned from their honeymoon. They had two weeks of bliss on an island in the South Pacific.
That afternoon, Mycroft visited him after receiving a phone call from the Dean. “You can’t go on like this. You need professional help, Sherlock.”
He stopped breathing for a second when he became aware of a warm hand on top of his. Now he had to look him in the eyes. He didn’t, though. Instead, he lowered his head and stared at the table.
Willa chuckled. “It’s sounds awful I know, but with practice comes precision and with precision you can bring forth beautiful music.” She gazed at the young man in front of her. “Reach out for perfection, Sherlock and one day you too, can touch someone’s soul with your own compositions.”
Minutes after his brother left, his phoned beeped. It was Greg, sending a text message with Missis Hudson’s cell phone number.
After experiencing Sherlock’s intelligent questions during lectures and looking at his previous test scores, professor Marks realized Sherlock had an inquisitive mind that absorbs relevant information like a sponge. With a mind like that, he had bright future ahead of him. He reached out to him to enhance his ability from A-grade student to a cum laude student.
A nightmare woke him at six. It was driving him insane. He should get something to occupy his mind. The violin alone wasn’t sufficient.
“This is John Watson, my new flat mate,” he said after freeing himself from her arms. He turned to John. “Missis Hudson, our landlady.”
Sherlock jumped upright and patted on the seat next to him. “Come watch telly with me. You’ll find it interesting. It’s about quantum physics.”
“Great, I’m picking you up at ten. I’m cooking you lunch. How can we get to know each other if we don’t spend some time alone?”
He smiled at them, put the violin in its case and handed it to Willa. “Thank you. I’ll buy my own the end of the month.”
School closed early. Everybody in his class, except him, went to a bar to celebrate the beginning of their adulthood.
He nodded as he took place against a cupboard. His heart rate increased when Andrew brushed against him while leaning over him to reach for the wine glasses.
Since he took up violin lessons two months ago, he practiced every day. He was a quick learner and could play a piece of music after a month.
He nodded, struggling to find the right words he kept on staring at the man in front of him. He swallowed a dry lump before he took a deep breath. “I’m not ready for a relationship, Simon. I hardly know you. Besides, I’m so busy at the lab I don’t have time to social.” Sherlock rolled his eyes after Simon broke eye contact. What a lame excuse, why didn’t he tell the man he couldn’t be in a physical relationship, not now – maybe never.
At the diner, he stared blindly at the menu. His eyes flickered when the waiter came to take his order. “Oh, sorry, give me a second.” His eyes skimmed over the menu while the waiter stood next to him waiting. “I’ll have the Caesar salad and a glass of white wine, please.”
While Sherlock strolled down the corridor back to his dorm room, the sad howling of violin music drifted towards him. He stood still and listened a while before he walked off in that direction. He found the room the music came from, paused and leaned against the doorway with his arms crossed.
He smiled. “I could never hate you, Mister Holmes. Since that first day you walked into my class room, I couldn’t take my eyes off you.”
Andrew grabbed hold of his crotch, pacing towards him while yelling. “Is this what you came here for? Is this what you want?”
Before examining the area or the body, all of them put on protective clothing, gloves and shoe covers except Sherlock. He took only a pair of gloves and strolled over to the body.
Mycroft took his phone out of his pocket and called an ambulance. He gave them the address. “Please hurry. I don’t know how many of the sleeping tablets he took.”
Sherlock brought the tea into the living room. He placed a cup on the side table next to John before he sat down in the chair opposite him.
On the third day, they locked him up in a soundproof padded room, while keeping an eye on him via a monitor.
After the taxi dropped him off in front of the hospital, he inquired at reception on which floor the morgue was.
When he pulled his legs up, Simon took hold of the elastic band and slipped Sherlock’s shorts off before he got rid of his tracksuit pants.
Sherlock tilted his head backwards when John’s lips covered his mouth. He uttered noises of pleasure. “Oh, I missed kissing,” he whispered when John traced his lips down his neck.
“Listen, I’m not going to hurt you. You don’t have to be scared of me.” Simon sighed. “I, um… I’ll be gentle if you just allow me.” He moved out from under his head and stood up.
He snorted after reciting Sherlock’s last words. “Because that’s cheating, I’m cheating on my wife after only two weeks of marriage.”
“Those toilets are used for male prostitution. Why didn’t you ask me for money?” He shook his head. “Mummy can never find out about this, it will send her to the grave.”
Sherlock retreated to the bathroom. He reached for the mop in the dark. After finding it, he returned to the living room doorway. He narrowed his eyes, trying to focus in the dark. There was someone on the couch.
She smiled. “Thank you, glad you liked it. It’s my own composition. I usually compose this kind of music when I’m sad. Do you play?”
John nodded and started climbing the two flights of stairs until he found the door and pushed it open. He glanced at the slender tall man dressed in a dark suit, with a cigarette between his fingers. His black curly hair ruffled from the wind. He paced closer. “Those things will kill you,” he said and raised a brow when the man didn’t even twitch a finger.
“Yes, he worries about you. He saw on the CCTV monitor in his office you were heading over here. He knows it’s your old dealing place, so he woke me up and asked me to save you from falling for this crap again.”
He strained his eyes to focus. A white blur moved in front of him. The blasting of a ship’s horn nearby echoed in his throbbing head. He was at the harbor.
Simon’s eyes enlarged. He let the legs slipped of his shoulders and get hold of Sherlock’s arms, pinning him onto the bed. “Look at me,” he called out. “Look at my face. It’s Simon. I’m not the one who hurt you before.”
“Biscuits, buttermilk biscuits,” he said and took the packet out of the drawer where he hid it. He wanted to give it to him tonight, but since he upset him with word from his brother, he gave it now instead.
After the second cigarette, he dragged himself through the shower. He put on clean pajamas, flopped onto the couch and called Greg. “I’m fine, stop worrying.” He rolled his eyes. “Mycroft is filling your head with all kinds of rubbish about me. I know you’re gullible because you’re still in love. My god, I thought you were the dominant one. Ha, was I wrong.” Sherlock’s eyes enlarged. “Yes, I’m done. I called because I want a phone number from you.” He shook his head. “No, the case is closed. The file is in the archives.” His face dulled. “No, don’t ask Anderson, no, neither Sally. I’ll get dressed and come over to look for it myself.” A smile formed on his face. “His name is Hudson. A drug cartel case, he got the death penalty. Yes, that’s the one.” Sherlock lit another cigarette before he continued. “I want his wife’s phone number. Thanks.”
After two days, Sherlock’s body craved the amphetamines. His whole body shivered. His head wanted to explode with the throbbing pain in his temples. He yelled at the staff, threw the trays of food on the floor as soon as they left his room. After many attempts reinserting his intravenous feeding to boost him with vitamins, they gave up when he pulled it out again.
He put his glass on the side table before he took place next to Andrew on the edge of the couch and turned to him.
“So tell me, did you make any decisions on the list of labs interested in you?” he asked and moved forward to sit on the edge of the couch as well.
“Sorry, I’m not going with you. The stairs will kill me. Just take them up and go through the door. You’ll find him there smoking.”
“I don’t need friends. I don’t have friends.” He glanced at John and smiled faintly. “I have only one.”
He returned after a few minutes and gazed at Sherlock’s bruised face and swollen lips. He sighed, walked back to the chair and sat down again. “I worry about you, constantly,” he murmured.
Mycroft sent his chauffeur to pick him up at hospital with a message that he would visit him later that evening.
“I know what I said, Molly,” he cried out, cutting her off mid-sentence. He rushed out of the locker room and hurried down to the morgue.
Sally gaped at him before she turned to Greg. “Why did you bring him in? Are we not good enough anymore?”
Sherlock jumped up. “Didn’t you know a lover can be a friend as well?” He snorted. “Oh but of course, you won’t know. You don’t have a lover, brother mine, only a goldfish.”
He drew his lips in a thin line. “That my little brother is a lie and you know it. As soon as the doctor discharges you, you are going to a rehab center.”
He turned around and walked into the kitchen. After placing his hands on the surface of the cupboard, he leaned against it and shut his eyes. He gained Sherlock’s trust and he didn’t want to lose it due to bloody sex. Simon banged his fist on the cupboard. He stormed out of the kitchen, stopped in the living room doorway and glanced at Sherlock. “I’ll be with you in a minute. I’m going to take a shower.”
John rolled his eyes. “Why didn’t you bloody say so in the first place? I’m staying there for nearly two months and you never visit him once. Why don’t you stop by one afternoon? Come and see for yourself how he’s doing.” He bit on his teeth. “Now open this bloody door and let me out.”
Although doctor Müller was not happy that Sherlock refused the tablets he described, he was impressed with his improvement.
Sherlock looked up from the microscope and glanced at his watch. “One o’clock already?” He stood up, stretched his back and took his packet of cigarettes out of his lab coat’s pocket. “I’m on the roof if anyone’s looking for me.”
“What were you doing here?” Sherlock asked for the second time and stood up as well. He walked over to the other side of the bed and took place next to John.
“I sat with you every night while you were having them. Usually I stay awake and leave before five. I don’t know why I dozed off this time.”
He held the brown bag out to him. “I want nothing. I brought you something to eat.” He removed his foot, put the bag on the floor and turned away.
After the waiter brought his food, he stopped him before he could leave. “Could you bring me a burger and large chips as well, takeaway?”
There was no stopping him now. He lowered his shoulders, forced Sherlock’s legs over them and raised his rear end from the bed before he positioned himself on top of him again. “This is what I wanted.” His breathing raced. He kissed him again, not noticing the panic in the man’s eyes underneath him. Simon came upright, took hold of his erection and tried to enter Sherlock. He looked at him. “You have to relax, love. I can’t get it in.”
He gazed at her, eyeing her from head to toe, trying to deduce her, but failed like the time when he met Irene Adler.
Professor Linder frowned at the young man’s dark enlarged eyes. “Are you okay? I was just offering you a free meal, nothing else.”
He shrugged. “I didn’t know she would be on your birthday party. Then again, I didn’t know Irene Adler would also be there.”
After seven days, they released Sherlock out of the padded room and took him back to the psychiatric ward.
John returned from shopping when a black sedan with tinted windows stopped next to him. The chauffeur jumped out and opened the backdoor, ordering him to get it. After he refused, his cell phone rang. When he answered, a voice commanded him to get into the car. The person called him by his name and profession.
. There was probably something about plausible deniability in there somewhere, but he didn't much care for the law. Obviously.
Knocking lightly, he stepped into the room, only to find Lestrade sitting up in bed and taking to one of his officers.
"Yes! Now quieten down or you'll wake him!" John snapped, quickly walking over to usher the man back out of the apartment, "And he won't be able to do any cases for the next few days, so double homicide or not, just tell him you don't have anything at the moment if he asks".
John frowned, staring at the red stain that was slowly emerging from under his suit jacket, coming from... his shoulder?
"Essentially?" Molly questioned, reaching across to take it from him and open it herself, "Why essentially?"
The Inspector didn't bother to correct him, though he did hear the snide remark from Anderson being thrown in, "If he can't even remember one simple name, then why the hell is he being trusted with a kid?"
Sherlock put his dark blue scarf around his neck, put on his coat and flipped the collar up. “You keep touching your right shoulder, sometimes rolling it while pulling a face. The pain is still bugging you. Am I right?”
Sherlock came back with a bucket and chucked the wet cloths and towels inside. When he lifted the bucket, John took it out of his hands.
“Why not, why won’t you tell me what’s haunting you?” Simon took the hand from his faced and drew it against his chest. “Every time we kiss, you push me away as soon as it steams up between us. Don’t you think after six months I need more than just kisses?”
His mother glared at him. “He doesn’t have time to babysit you,” she repeated her eldest son’s words on why Sherlock couldn’t stay with him.
Greg gave him files of other unsolved cases. One after the other he solved them as well. He saved prisoners, wrongfully accused, from death penalty. Sometimes he received incentives from their families as gratitude for his help.
“Stop it,” Sherlock yelled. He hit against Simon’s chest, yelling. “Get off me. I don’t want to.” He yelled again and wriggled, trying to get away. “Get off me.” He kicked, missing Simon’s face with millimeters.
“Can’t you skip a violin lesson just once a month to make time for me? I know you’re still seeing Willa for lessons. Well, actually she told me.”
Sherlock glanced at the professor’s gaping face. He looked back at the board. “Did I make a mistake?”
Sherlock threw his hands in the air. “I should’ve been a girl,” he yelled before marching into the dining room.
Sherlock removed his hand, draping it over his shoulder as he turned sideways to put his head on Simon’s lap.
The man stopped and turned around. He didn’t recognize him at first and frowned, while walking closer.
He nodded at first before becoming aware of what he was doing and shook his head. “No, I’m not busy. Coffee will be nice.”
One of the sisters dragged him into the duty room. “Don’t let matron or one of the doctors catch you.”
“Yes, once again I saved you, little brother. This is the second time in just over a year I’m sitting next to your deathbed. Are you stupid or something?”
John emptied the bucket in the washing machine and turned to him. “You don’t have to do everything yourself, you know. Let a man… me help you with the heavy lifting.”
She continued to show him how to position the violin under his chin and the correct way to stand while playing it.
Andrew grabbed his hand and dragged him into the living room. “Come sit and relax. Forget about classes and uni. Just be yourself.”
“You’re welcome to stop by and listen any time,” she called out when he was halfway down the corridor. “I didn’t catch your name,” she added.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he patted the cell phone against his chin. He had to work tomorrow. He bit his lower lip, searched the lab’s number on his phone and dialed it. “Linda, Sherlock. I’m not coming in tomorrow, will be there on Friday.” He sighed. “Of course I’m fine.” He ended the call and called Mycroft. “No, calling is faster than texting. I want a favor from you.” He shook his head. “Not money. Let them reduce my working hours at Bart’s.” He sighed. “Why do you always have to know everything? I’m going to be a consulting detective. Yes, consulting detective, google it, I’ll be the first one.” He smiled. “Did he tell you I solved the case? Good, now reduce my hours at the lab. I will be there on Fridays only.” His face flushed. “Good god, Mycroft,” he yelled. “This is what I want to do. Yes without pay.” Sherlock arched a brow. “Is Lestrade there? Put him on the phone.” He waited a few seconds, before Greg answered. “Will you talk some sense into your boyfriend’s head,” he said and dropped the call before he could put Mycroft back on the phone.
He snorted and hopped around onto his other side to face the wall. He pulled up his knees to lie in a fetal potion, which he often did when he was upset.
“Stop this bullshit. We’ve had this discussion already. I love you and I don’t want anyone else, but you. When is your day off?”
He returned his gaze to Simon. He did like him. Maybe he should give him a chance. While licking his lower lip and after sucking on it, he noticed a sparkle in Simon’s eyes. He was turning the man on. He let go of his lip immediately and placed the back of his fingers in front of his mouth, distracting him.
Sherlock grimaced, accentuating his words as he announced. “I don’t need friends.” He fell down on his bed, turned his back on the door and pulled his knees up to his chest.
“This meeting is over,” Mycroft said and stood up. He pulled his shoulders back and tapped his umbrella on the floor, glaring at his brother. “There’s one more thing. I didn’t want to tell you, but since you have this attitude.”
Sherlock stood up. He glanced at the board then at the professor next to him. He stood head and shoulders above the man and had to lower his head to look him in the eye. “Do I have…” he pointed to the front.
He scoffed at him. “Well, that’s a few hundred. Did your parents –” John threw his hands in the air and snorted. “Of course, that’s why they weren’t at the funeral.”
Greg jumped up from behind his desk. “Good god what is wrong with you. He’s here to help us. Have some respect for his talent. If it wasn’t for him that bloody gardener would’ve killed again.” He glared at them before he sat down again. “Teamwork people, teamwork.” He rolled his eyes, sighing. “Now, can we get back to work?”
Sherlock chucked the phone on the couch after he read the message and jumped up. He bumped his leg against one of the boxes and grunted. He had to find another flat.
When Sherlock stepped outside, he shut the door and glanced at the woman standing against the wall. He turned around and headed towards the taxi.
“We’re not at uni now. Please, call me Andrew.” He placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and steered him towards the kitchen. “Would you like some wine.”
“Doctor Müller wants to keep you here for another week, maybe longer.” He glanced at his brother before taking a seat next to his bed. “I can help you if you want to make a case against the person who hurt you in Liverpool.”
Sherlock returned three months later. He glanced at the building, then at the green door with the 221B copperplates and smiled. He missed this place, but not as much as he missed John.
Simon thanked him and headed back to the entrance. He found the notice board and next to it the list of room numbers. He searched until he found Sherlock’s number. “First floor, number fifteen,” he whispered. He trotted up the stairs, found his room and paused in front of it. Maybe he should leave the bag in front of the door. No, someone might take it.
After cleaning up the kitchen, he went back to the living room and sat in his favorite chair while listening to the violin music.
Sherlock’s heart started racing. His eyes grew large when he recalled the last time he went home with one of his professors. “I um… can’t. No thanks, I have to study.” He put the violin and the bow in the case and shut it. “I have to go.”
Sherlock still wasn’t sure he hadn’t started hallucinating. “Are you offering to take Willa on Valentine’s Day weekend so I can make it up to my partner that our lead to his psychotic ex is dead?”
Sure enough there was a woman making her way straight towards them, followed closely by no less than five children.
Willa had wanted to know why they were celebrating, though, and John had struggled to put into words what it was. She’d only been two that year but had already connected celebrations with large events. He’d settled on explaining that Christmas for them was a time of celebrating loved ones and focusing on the good in such a literal dark time of year. That they gave gifts to make the people they loved happy.
John had been in bed for over an hour but the constant shifting told Sherlock he wasn’t asleep. John hadn’t slept the night prior either and the night before that had been when Sherlock had spotted Wolanski lingering around Baker street.
“Why aren’t you superintendent?” Lestrade was overqualified for the position and if they’d just hired a new one why wouldn’t they have just promoted him. It also helped that his husband was the British government.
Sherlock wanted to point out that Harry would still have a wife if she had quit drinking. Clara had given her more than one chance even after he’d met John.
Sherlock understood John’s protests now. “Luke… doesn’t know.” It wasn’t a guess. Even if Luke had known his wife had been unfaithful and chose to stay with her and raise the child there was no way he would have continued to be that friendly with John.
The doors opened into a grey cinderblock hall. Anthea led the way once again through the winding halls until coming to stop in front of one of the dozens of unmarked doors. She held open the door for John.
He knew John was fretting over what had happened but Wolanski hadn’t given anything of value up to Sherlock or Mycroft’s men. Just because Wolanski had a heavy criminal past didn’t mean this year was meant to be any different than the prior years where the present had just been left and currier disappeared.
Willa led the way to her classroom at a strange pace halfway between a walk and a skip. She was terribly excited but trying to obey the school rules. John didn’t need to look at Sherlock to know he was analyzing every aspect of the school when they walked in. He did wonder what the other man was seeing and if he approved of John’s choice.
John laughed. It wasn’t a small chuckle but a deep laugh from his stomach and he didn’t stop. As he dropped Sherlock’s wrist to wrap an arm around his middle, he found he missed it. Sherlock was beginning to get concerned after a moment since he didn’t think anything he had said was actually that funny.
“Really.” John insisted. “Tomorrow I’ll find the pictures of you and I right after you were born and show you. You cried in all of them.” He had a photo album in his bedroom of all the photos from Willa’s first four months that didn’t have Mary in them or had been easily cut out.
There was still a few hours until Willa’s bedtime, which Sherlock had promised to call him for, so John mindlessly channel hopped. Once it was clear that wasn’t going to hold his attention for much longer he got up and showered.
Once Sherlock had shut the laptop and settled Willa back into the bed she was yawning. “Do you think daddy will be happy about my room?” She asked
