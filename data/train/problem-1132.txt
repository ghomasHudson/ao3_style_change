During one portion of the flight, Sherlock rattled off deductions about the other passengers and the stewardesses, walking John through his readings.
“The police?” Sherlock took his seat and pulled the door shut, giving an address to the driver before turning to John, wearing that expression of
"People have to have something to do, I suppose. Everyone celebrates differently. Just another holiday. Even you enjoy Christmas some."
“I'd put that phone down if I were you, Mr. Holmes,” he said from the balcony behind John. Sherlock did as he was told, setting it down on a side table. “It's rather entertaining, that I can make you go wherever I want. All the way to Italy, just because I said so.”
The rest of the available ground space was filled with dahlias. Purples, pinks, oranges, even some that were multicolored, with white tips at the end of each petal. Sherlock praised them for what he called their “geometric perfection.” And it was true that they had about them a sort of honeycomb quality if one stared at them for too long.
For those of you who don't know about this book, this fic is based on a novel called The Goldfinch, which I have been constantly preoccupied with for the last nine solid fucking months. I started this fic because of how badly
When Sherlock pulled away, his face was scrutinizing.
It was decided that food was in order. They had thought of restaurants, but it was early in the day, and nothing sounded good. To be honest, Sherlock wasn't all that hungry. But John had gotten on to him about not eating, "Which is clearly an issue given by the state of your kitchen," he had joked.
“I keep you right.”
John was silent, but his clenched jaw slowly relaxed. He took a deep breath, his voice calmer when he spoke.
“Everyone is capable of murder under the right circumstances.”
Sherlock's mother came for him, and after many thanks, she led him out of the house. As the door fell shut behind them, he heard the boy say, “Can I go to sleep for a while?”
“John, why's he dressed like that?”
"Yes. God yes. Just beautiful."
She shouldn't have been in this arena. She was too good for it.
Moriarty looked at the side of John's face, just able to see his expression from his position behind John. He turned to Sherlock, seemingly unfazed by the assault.
Sherlock smiled, a little laugh. “I think it's well known that the only reason this building hasn't burned to the ground, the only reason the money is handled properly, the only reason that the kitchen isn't a toxic wasteland, is you. You keep this fortress from falling apart.”
John sighed and shook his head. At least he had the
“Have you had dreams too?”
“And who the hell are you, exactly?” He looked up at him, pen still hovering over the paper.
"No. How did you know?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Once it was over, Sherlock very bluntly told Mycroft to not call him for a few weeks.
“You left everything where it was.”
The news continued to refer to John as Sherlock Holmes' partner, and while the ambiguity of the word had felt like a taunt after Sherlock's “death,” it didn't anymore.
“Probably. But I'll take what I can get. One day at a time.”
Sherlock didn't answer, gave no response except panicked breathing. He came to a stop at the back door, flinging it open, pulling John inside before letting go of him. He began to tear through the kitchen cabinets. “Medicine.”
“Are you happy? With her I mean? Mary?”
novelist. Otherwise it's a waste of your time.
Sherlock had only stared at him before starting at the bang of a fist on their door.
“Well, you made an impression, I'll give you that!” Mycroft gave her a disapproving look, turning to John.
“Then you can monitor me. Besides, I'm the doctor, not you. You couldn't even manage to take out your own stitches.” Sherlock bristled at the remark, and John smiled, happy to have distracted him for a moment.
The silver-haired man turned to him and held out a hand, “I'm DI Lestrade.”
"John-"
John smiled, a little sadly, and said, “Sometimes the things you say sound like something out of a poem. Regular people don't talk like that.”
Everything was spinning rapidly out of control. How could Sherlock protect the person he cared about when he was being consumed by this man's killings and obsessions? He was a distraction, but not a pleasant one. Sherlock wanted him dead.
“Okay. But you didn't die. You're here again. So now what?” Sherlock always had a plan, always knew what the next step was, accounted for every possible outcome. So what had been on his list on the off chance he survived?
She sat back in her seat some. “John, are you starting to see and hear things that aren't there? Do I need to get you some proper help?”
He was nearly paralyzed whenever he thought about where to go from here. His therapist had plenty of suggestions. But he felt like the therapy was more just a motion he was going through than something that would actually heal him.
“John, you idiot, you are going to get yourself killed.” She stood a few feet in front of him, arms crossed.
“What should we do?”
“Even a madman has
“Their songs are quite pretty, actually.”
But even these thoughts felt like background noise.
"What?"
“No problem at all John. What's wrong?”
“Do people expect returned tributes to be particularly sociable immediately following the Games?”
And when Sherlock fell asleep next to him that night, he wasn't curled up on top of the blankets, facing away and holding himself apart as he had on the train.
"How much did you hear?"
“Lovely, isn't it?”
Finally, all he could do was smile, and say, “I'm afraid we're all out of time for questions.”
“I don't care why.”
But someone rose from the brush, and John could see the edge of a hole in the rock. A false face.
John looked at Sherlock. It was hard not to see him as the injured boy brought to him all those years ago. Now, finally removed from the pomp and circumstance of the Capitol and the brutality of the arena, the reality of this man was so obvious that he wondered how no one else seemed to see it.
He knew he couldn't say it back, knew she would hear the lie. He kissed her so he wouldn't have to say anything at all.
KR: Why is that?
I sat down on my bed, carefully avoiding the exposed springs, and looked at the devastation. I should have gone after him. I could have destroyed him, ruined his life. But I would be lying if I said I hadn't been shaken, that I wasn't bothered by the words spray painted across my room. I was still young, and while I was not the most sensitive of people, it still put a dampener on my day.
He was about to leave when he saw John stand, resting his hand on the tombstone as he'd done many times. But this time he said in a choked voice, "Merry Christmas, Sherlock. I love you." He turned and walked away, back in the direction of Baker Street.
When the front door opened a few days later, John thought at first that it was Harry before he remembered she'd long since passed out in her room upstairs. Her methods of getting through the day were sounding more and more appealing.
“Delayed effects. Systemic effects.”
“About the Games?”
He was stranded in a crowd of people who were pretending to be his audience, when he knew that not a single one of them really understood his methods. They all fawned over the end result and congratulated him on his skills. He became less tactful as the night dragged on, and Mycroft chided him more than once.
John gave a small nod and walked silently with him out into the fading Roman light.
All along that day.
“So I gather.”
“You really should leave while there's still daylight.”
John seemed relieved. Did he have faint memories of the night before that he had just explained away as a dream in his head? Sherlock hoped so. It was for the best in the long run.
“Don't you think it's odd?” He refilled his glass. “Two random people having a joint income, like we essentially do?”
“I'm glad you're not living alone, even if it is just with a friend. I worried about you, when you first came back. That solitude wasn't good for you.”
Sherlock shook his head and stepped aside, waving John in. John stopped a few feet inside, waiting as Sherlock closed the door.
"Oh, you're composing again." He paused and listened to the melody. "It's pretty."
Sherlock stopped, watching the smile spread across the man's face. “Who is he? Which tribute?”
“Then quit.”
“Carl Sandburg.”
I suppose it comes as no surprise that I always rather detested grand romantic gestures. They struck me as unnecessary and contrived, feeble attempts at desperately holding together relationships, most of which should have been allowed to fall apart.
John paused, his glass halfway to his mouth. “You wrote a waltz for us?”
Every shaky step back to Baker Street was laughter and talk and walking so close that their arms brushed against each other's. The pavement was plenty wide; there was no reason to be so close, to be constantly casually bumping into each other. But as if controlled by some new law of physics, Sherlock never seemed to drift more than inches away.
“You can be a real bastard you know? How many men out there require the return of their dead friend for their girlfriend to see their flat?”
“Did it bother you, though? What Mycroft did?”
John laid his own hand over Sherlock's. "You helped with that."
to him, he decided he would keep his thoughts to himself.
“It really was you in Afghanistan.” The pulse grew stronger, more regular. Sherlock winced. He wasn't used to this pounding in his chest. How did humans stand it? “Why are you back?”
Sherlock's face darkened considerably. “I don't have an immunity.”
“Yeah. They loved it.” John took a few bites of his food.
“What?”
It could work, couldn't it? It could at least work better than it had with the girlfriends. They already knew each other's quirks, already knew they could tolerate each other even under the oddest circumstances. Each knew how the other took their tea, who was the lighter sleeper, how they preferred to pass their time. It could work. If he would just

“What is the name of this implausible travesty?”
“John Watson.”
“I do remember. Sitting up with you that night after you nearly got yourself killed.”
John nodded his head, conceding. “Yeah, well, writer or not, you don't seem any more fond of people than me. And sometimes I wish I'd never published anything. It sort of became work instead of fun. Well, instead of a comforting coping mechanism. But someone suggested I send in the manuscript of
John fell silent, turning to look out the large windows at the end of the room. But since Sholto had flooded the place with light, all he saw was a blurry sort of reflection of the room.
“Your relationship history isn't exactly extensive, Sherlock.”
John arched an eyebrow at Sherlock, a blatant
you were.” He didn't say it with any sort of malice or reprimand, but still John felt like a child who's been caught by a parent. Sholto watched him, his face stoic as always, never giving away a single bit of what he was thinking. “You're not arguing with me about that, though I'm sure you've argued with Mary about it often enough, whether you realize it or not.”
“Friend?”
he hadn't met her, she seemed familiar from somewhere.
“Why?”
Sherlock lasted five minutes before he made excuses about his head and left the room.
. But I don't think he
"I don't want to believe it's true, but right now, I don't know what else to believe. Don't tell me you didn't have a moment of doubt when he told you all that on the phone."
"Nice is boring. I do hate these social summons. I see these people often enough. There's no reason to see even more of them." He turned back to his laptop.
When he reached out to it, he did so blindly, and his hand collided with Sherlock's, already on the dog's neck. He didn't know at first whether to freeze where he was or to jerk his hand away, and Sherlock seemed equally stilled.
His face began to twist. "You know, that would certainly explain a lot about you. If you were
Sherlock spoke with an edge in his voice. “How was your date with what's-her-name?”
“About what?”
“No. I don't.”
John stood to the side, looking at the painting from his safe place against an empty section of wall. It was a pretty painting, a dark and lovely cityscape, a collection of stars dotting the night sky, the light reflecting off a body of water in the foreground. John could just make out the signature in the bottom left corner. It had a blurry sort of mystery about it, this painting, like concept art from an old horror movie. It wasn't as big as John had imagined, either, though everyone always assumes great works came in large packages. But this recovered art looked to be about the size of a laptop computer, held up by a terribly simple frame, the only piece of art on its wall. A security guard, a heavyset man with a doughy face, walked calmly around the gallery in an endless loop of the same route, and John wondered just how much a museum security guard could
Later that afternoon, John arrived at the lab, unannounced. As soon as he walked in, Molly walked out, making a quick excuse that John ignored so easily that Sherlock was sure she had something to do with John's presence. The doors fell shut with a slam behind her as she left. Sherlock continued working for as long as he could before the silence became unbearable.
“The talk I've been hearing is that John's a bit of an underdog favorite.” She gave him a nod of approval. “Of course, Jim Moriarty has a large fan base already.”
“What is that device?”
“Well,” John said, scoffing, “I don't know that that last one is really that important in the grand scheme of things. But I suppose it's nice to have a home.” When had his own glass become empty?
“Is that what I've been hearing make all that racket in the trees out here?”
“The day after tomorrow.”
“Dr. Watson, I always take precautions.”
He didn't say so, but the remark relieved him. There was something to be said for always having at least one person you could count on to want your company, someone happy to see you at the end of the day, to share that morning coffee with.
Sherlock picked up the remote, smashing the button and making the screen go dark and silent. He was sick of the news stories, sick of the reporters outside their building asking him questions, sick of the attention he was getting for his supposed heroics back in London.
"She does rather set herself up for it."
“What do you mean?”
“Absolutely not.”
He glared at it, sitting quietly in its pot out of the way of its poisonous neighbors. The great experimental failure. He had never hated something so much as he did that innocent flower. The creation of a blue rose had preoccupied him for so long, and all it had gotten him was a shade of lavender and a single plant that couldn't stand up to his poison. Generation after generation of the purple roses, dead on contact, a final insult to the folly of his experiments.
he understood. And Sherlock was too exhausted to debate whether or not that was a bad thing.
Sherlock didn't say what he wanted to:
. It was a habit he'd never quite broken himself out of. And like every night now, the flat was quiet. No fire, no violin, no simple sounds of people moving through the rooms. The emptiness was almost palpable.
“I know that face, Sherlock.”
. Some past-John who didn't exist anymore.
Mrs. Hudson had come out and spoken to them. John missed nearly every word she said. He and Sherlock sat up on the stairs, John's head clearing a bit. Some of the earlier drinks had worn off. Had they been this close to each other all night?
When John looked at him, he was standing on the other side of the bench, confused and holding his file tucked under his arm.
"Hell, he thought to himself, maybe the inevitable pain will make for some good writing. But he knew damn well it wouldn't. He had used up all his pain-driven writing on
JW: Never. It's never been something I wanted to revisit. Besides, war is a different kind of crime than the ones I'm used to.
But as John had been told growing up, God didn't always give your prayers the answer you wanted.
I suppose this all feels like a Shakespearean chorus introducing the characters in a play. But if there is one thing I have learned, it is that we spend the bulk of our stupid little lives playing parts for other people.
Sherlock stood over the serial killer paralyzed at his feet. It would be so easy to kill him, bypassing all the proper channels of arrest and trial. Lestrade would be happy either way, since he would not know who had kindly rid the world of this monster. Sherlock had faced this dilemma more than once, the knowledge that he had the power to end lives. Most of the time, he wouldn't do it. Instead, he would bind them, or otherwise incapacitate them, and call in Lestrade. The criminal was always confused, and Lestrade was occasionally suspicious, but the criminal would never be believed, and the DI was too grateful to ask questions.
“Of course you don't.” The bottle made a loud clanking noise as John set it down carelessly on the coffee table.
“You haven't touched your food.”
Finally, the reply came. All it said was, “Goodnight, John.”
John stayed in bed for a while after he left, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling. A sense of the surreal crept over him, and he smiled to himself, the happy ache still deep in his chest and the comforting fact that Sherlock would come back, not vanish into death, made him nearly sigh in relief.
* * *
She shrugged. “You can't help who you love. I just hope we can still get along, even though at times we certainly didn't make things easy on each other.” He was blindsided, and every attempt at thinking up a response failed miserably. “Why, what did you think I'd say?”
Sherlock paused, violin in hand. “Perhaps I was mistaken.”
Normally, he would avoid drinking after work, given his sister's history, but there were some days that were so long and so awful that any sane person would reach for a bottle.
They stopped in front of an odd looking tree at the far edge of the estate. It had an appearance similar to a large and strangely mutated aloe plant. From it hung brightly colored fruits, spiky and foreign. And all over it, large, white flowers, their centers filled with yellow stamens.
Late into the night, he repeated his mantra over and over in his head, as if hoping that thinking it enough would make him believe it was true.
JW: I've been at this for years, and I
He couldn't really see her face, but he saw her head move as she looked up. “What's what?”
John did not realize at first what he had done. He had heard the sound every soldier dreads, the sound of incoming projectiles. There had been gunshots and then the whirring of what he could only assume was a bomb. He had thrown himself to the ground, covering his head and bracing for the explosion, and begging it not to come.
"Sherlock, would you stay still, please?" John started at the doctor's voice. It was a woman.
help a little. When asked how his day was, John just shook his head, and the owner seemed to understand the evasion, and unlike his father, did not press further.
” She clamped her eyes shut, her hand falling back to her stomach as she winced.
"It was never supposed to happen this way."
“I thought you were a pompous bastard.”
John didn't make a move to still the silver balls. “What?”
“We're the only ones left, John.”
"I have to know the time frame in which I'll be required to act like a decent human being, don't I?"
I froze for a second, but relinquished.
“No wonder it's a target.”
“Why?”
Mycroft had also “graciously” gotten Sherlock work. Well known for his intellect, Sherlock was ordered to assist the Peacekeepers in their investigations. He felt like a traitor most days, and it did nothing for the general public's opinion of him. But he did his best to deliberately lead them astray when he could manage it. And he couldn't complain that his quality of life was higher than most people's.
“You should have told me.”
“It's 2014.”
John caught him trying to leave the flat later that day and stopped him. “Where are you going?”
The rose retained its color, its vitality.
“Well, I guess I don't understand why you don't save some of them. You know, the ones that are getting overgrown, the ones that are out of control, the ones getting strangled by all the vines. Why don't you actually keep all of them up? Like a botanical garden?”
He promised himself that one day he would pay respect to silent daughters.
“Thought so.”
“Of course he did. Fine, she's – she's fine.” He searched for more to say about her, and came up empty.
“Yes. I'm fine.”
“Yes.”
"Of course you do." John smiled. He had already quit asking
“I believe you just answered your own question.”
“I'm relieved, actually.”
Sherlock smiled, looking off at some people walking past them. “Always glad to amuse.”
“Why?”
When I woke up the first time, I did so in the snow, wearing clothes not meant for freezing weather, and Mycroft was standing over me, showing more emotion than I had ever seen on his face before. He was with paramedics.
,” he said as if it was a massive inconvenience.
KR: If so little matters, then what's the point of writing at all?
And finally, he thought about Sherlock.
“About what?”
“The world is filled with more important things to worry about.” He turned back to the television, grudgingly taking a few bites of his food as Audrey Hepburn descended a staircase in an evening gown. “Thank God balls went out of style too. So much tedious social chatter. I can't imagine what people ever saw in them. Ghastly affairs.”
“What's that?”
“Yoo-hoo.” John stopped when he heard Mrs. Hudson's voice in the doorway. He could feel his face flush.
He looked toward the gun on the desktop.
“Well, do you?”
A few hours later he finally remembered: 221. And something about a shop.
I stood there, breathing heavily with my heart pounding in my ears, for quite a while before I wrenched myself away from the table and practically ran out of the pub. Once outside, I leaned against the bricks of the building, trying in vain to steady myself.
“She found out about Afghanistan, about what happened and who I am. I've had to hire some new people lately because of it. They always find out in the end. Lila called me a monster and quit.” He shrugged one shoulder, the one that felt no creeping paralysis. “I'm trying to hire fewer people. I'd like to do away with it entirely, but that's not really plausible.” John thought it was a massive understatement. Absolutely not plausible for an agoraphobic, disabled, traumatized army veteran. He hated that hiring staff who didn't despise him was even something he had to worry about. Sholto had internalized and normalized his own self-loathing.
“Sherlock,
“I'm not that attractive. But Jeanette isn't that concerned with looks.”
that I am one of them.”
Sherlock had looked over Mrs. Hudson's old violin critically. He spent the rest of the evening giving it a tune-up and coaxing sound from it. When he was mildly satisfied, he started playing in it earnest, and John breathed a sigh of relief.
“What?”
They grabbed their coats and set off down the street. When they reached the store, John insisted that Sherlock actually get enough food to survive on for at least a few days. "I swear, I've seen third world nations with more food in their houses than you."
“You used to date him, didn't you?”
“Yeah, even then. I knew. She was beautiful and smart and a wonderful woman.”
“I know, but let's not shock the unsuspecting public anymore than we have to, okay?”
There was something coming from the mine, smoke, but white like morning fog. The fog began to come from more places, seeping up out of the ground from other unseen mines in a chain reaction. Were they defective?
“The man from my district is still alive too. Mike. I don't think there's many more where both of the people are still alive. I'm glad Sherlock's okay, as far as we know.”
He hated being on stage as soon as he set foot on it. He couldn't see for all the lights, and the noise was deafening. But he put on a smile and shook Lestrade's hand, relaxing a little at his whispered words of, “It'll only be a minute, John. I'll make it easy as I can.” And then he clapped him on the shoulder as he turned back out to the crowd. He sat down in the chair next to John's and waited for the applause to die down.
Smoke and fire weren't always agents of destruction. They had been turned comforting instead.
Now and then, one of the thieving magpies would swoop past them, always drawing a smile from Molly, and later in the day, one from John as well.
"No, just...busy." John was suddenly suspicious. "Why do you ask?" Sherlock never took an interest in other people's personal lives.
Mrs. Hudson had been informed before, so when the two of them arrived home, all was quiet. Sherlock said that she had screamed, but was glad he was back, and that Henry had been especially glad to see him.
By the time the voice called his name, John had reached a point where all he wanted to do was walk in and tell them all to fuck off and leave it at that. But Mycroft, and probably even Irene, would never let him hear the end of it, and logically he knew he couldn't do something that asinine anyway.
John held the gun against the girl's head, and watched as she breathed out a sigh of relief.
“Her name was Jeanette. Don't you remember?”
John was not doing well. It was coming up on the anniversary. It had been nearly a year. But John barely noticed. Every day ran together now, all in shades of grey. Nothing stood out, and nothing much made him happy. He had done only some temp work in clinics. He hadn't had anything resembling a relationship. His dreams were haunted with technicolor replays of the fall. In one version, Sherlock had a great pair of white wings emanating from him as he stood on the roof, and as he said goodbye, they turned to black. When he jumped, they would catch on fire and turn to ash before his eyes, like Icarus in a blue scarf.
And why had neither of them said it, that afternoon? Why hadn't one of them broken the silence, with Sherlock kneeling in front of him and John's hand on his head? Why hadn't they said what both of them knew damn well enough that day? Why did the goddamn
“I still trust you.”
“Sherlock, you have an assignment.”
One weekend when she wanted to see him, he told her he was busy Saturday night, that he was going to an exhibition opening.
“But you didn't kill me, Sherlock.”
“And where will you be in all this?”
Sherlock peered into the microscope in the lab, acutely aware of Lestrade's presence a little ways down the table. He'd been hovering there for ten minutes under the pretense of needing results for a case. Sherlock believed it had a great deal more to do with the fact that Molly Hooper would be returning from her lunch break within the next half-hour.
He gave her a weak smile. “Then I guess I'll have to win so you don't have to find out.” He knew she could hear the lie in his voice, but the words seemed to comfort her all the same.
“Do you see this?” Sherlock held the screen inches from John's face. “I am not the one in danger here, John, you are, and I will
“I still see no point in involving myself with other people. I can play a part in this pageant as always. There is no need to unnecessarily involve myself. Irene Adler spends nearly all of her year in her home in a drugged haze. She only performs when the camera's on her. There is no reason I cannot do the same.”
The cannon sounded.
“There would have been no
“Only if absolutely necessary. The sofa has been enough.”
Three in the morning, and Sherlock was walking around one of his greenhouses after making rounds to check on John. He continued to be baffled at the lack of illness or injury, but was all the same grateful for it.
“Precisely.”
“Yeah, some act.”
John put his head back down. “I wish it was all a hallucination. One big bad dream. Or a real show, like a scripted one where the people don't actually die, their characters just don't come back.”
Sherlock huffed out a sigh. "Fine." He crossed his arms over his chest and stared up at the ceiling.
John had hoped that when morning came, the pack of tributes would leave, but sunrise came and went and they still stayed, talking amongst themselves about the Games, eating leisurely. They knew they were a force to be reckoned with, and it made them indifferent. Why should they leave when they could just kill whoever came along instead?
“And you said
“Anyway, I'm glad you like it. I knew you would.”
“Does anyone really have happy memories of their teenage years?”
Sherlock still stared at the syringe. It looked inviting. The boy snapped in front of his eyes.
“What was all that about, then?”
The next night, when Sherlock showed up on John's doorstep, he didn't even hesitate to let him in.
“What?”
“Fine.”
It only took him a few weeks to find a job outside the city, in a small town tucked neatly into the countryside called Bell Song. It would be quiet, mundane, and peaceful. It was for the best.
"Sherlock? You all right?"
“Jesus.”
John looked away, trying to beat down the anger. He knew it wasn't true. But there was no way to prove it now. The only man who could have proved it was gone.
the one you're in a relationship with. Doesn't that seem a little screwed up to you?”
“Understand what?”
Sherlock stood in front of him, inches between their faces, resting his hand on John's cheek. He looked at him with a soft expression, eyes half-open again. John stared back at him, his laughter fading as he met the blue eyes.
is a prime example of Romanticism, and it includes a madwoman locked away in an old house who escapes in the night and tries to set someone on fire.”
He pushed the door aside. It didn't stay on its hinges anymore. Instead it just had to be propped in the door frame. He left it open, letting in faint slants of late afternoon light.
“Since yesterday.”
JW: I'm always working on
John could barely see the wound for all the dried blood. “I wish this was a clean injury.”
Irene was late to dinner that evening, finally strolling in as she had on the train, with a sort of hazy look in her eyes. John had gone to ask her a question earlier, and walked in on her tying a tourniquet around her arm while holding a syringe between her teeth. She'd looked at him, waiting for him to speak, but he had just turned and walked away. Despite this, she seemed mostly coherent, and as she sat down at the table across from Mycroft, she cast a glance to Sherlock, who had been staring at his plate in silence, and said, “My my, aren't we surly this evening.”
Sherlock hadn't seen Mycroft since the previous year. That was one of the only perks of his brother being a Capitol tool. He never had to see him except when he came in on government business.
After a moment's hesitation, thinking back to Sebastian, I answered, "Girlfriend? No, not really my area."
“No, not that one. But most of them are appropriately detached.”
“I didn't say that.”
Sholto looked tired, but then again, didn't he always?
a game to them, John. I can't say the same for the tributes. For tributes, it's all too real. All of it is too real.”
Sherlock walked to the water's edge, examining the beast. It was bigger than either of them, certainly enormous compared to John, and was covered in thick black fur. Its eyes were red – that wasn't an adrenaline induced exaggeration – and Sherlock took a second to be irritated with the dramatic flair the Capitol felt the need to insert into everything. It had jaws that could easily crush bone, blood around its mouth and snout, from Henry Knight, presumably. And in the center of its skull, a bullet hole. An inch or two either way would have only made it angrier.
One of them was particularly vitriolic. So John stopped the world and twisted his arm behind his back, not enough to dislocate his shoulder, but enough so that when he started the world again, the man cringed at the sudden and unexplained pain.
,” and he didn't even care about the implications or what people might say. Because it was true. He had never loved anyone like this, and his life had suddenly become a case of all this and heaven too.
"You asked me to be nice," he said matter-of-factly. Sherlock paused, picked up his bow. "And although it's unfortunate that the dull nurse won't be able to join you, I'm sure you'll find someone to go with."
Sherlock frowned. “Why wouldn't she? She lived it just as we did.”
“Say what.”
“Astute observation.”
For hours, he prolonged the stillness, nearly in tears thinking of what would happen. The world would slip into motion, but many of the men would slip into stillness.
Sherlock dragged him over to the table with a recklessness of touch that he would have decried only a day before. The purple rose sat in its pot, looking just as beautiful as it did every day, although it appeared to be missing a few petals.
The light began to shift, to change, the familiar effect of clouds crossing the sun, of slowly snuffing it out. But no one made a move to leave, seek shelter in a restaurant or shop nearby. Did anyone even really notice the weather? Did they realize they'd get soaked if they stayed much longer?
Even though his body was gone, Sherlock could almost see an imprint of him like a ghost, still standing by John holding a knife to his neck.
“Oh my god, you're the blogger, the one who's always with him.”
“But you –”
While the reception hall was being converted from dining room to dance floor, Sherlock paced around one of the other rooms in the building. He had done all he could with Janine in regard to her dancing abilities. She wasn't as quick a study as John had been.
“No. It got dull. I could teach myself better than the teachers could. Figured I would save myself the time.”
“It's okay,” Sherlock said quietly, seemingly unfazed by his outburst.
Once, when he woke up out of his twilight state, he found a change of clothes and some food sitting on the nightstand. That was what it took for him to finally realize that his own clothes were still covered in blood. It wasn't clear which of his good samaritans brought these things for him, but he was grateful all the same. They even brought him his phone from Baker Street, wiped clean of his bloody fingerprints, which made him believe that it was all Mycroft's doing, especially since he'd yet to see him during this ordeal.
"I don't know what I'd do, Sherlock!" John sounded more angry than he was. He was just tired and worried. He couldn't expect Sherlock Holmes to understand something like this brand of concern. "And, no, worrying won't change it, but neither will pretending everything is fine."
“I'm not as uninformed as you think I am.”
All day things had been uncomfortable with John. Even the ride to the wedding was tense and awkward. Sherlock hated it, but not as much as he would have hated discussing it. John had avoided eye contact, as he always did when something was bothering him, and even Mrs. Hudson had seemed concerned at the deliberate distance they had kept between each other all day. But they both showed up and did what they were supposed to, for the sake of their friends.
Felix looked between the two of them, and John was painfully aware that he knew what he was
“Good afternoon and happy Hunger Games, everyone! And may the odds be ever in your favor.” With a snap of his wrist, Mycroft started the yearly propaganda film. Sherlock thought this was the worst part of the Reaping, sitting around, pretending to listen to the history that everyone could recite already. It was terribly dull. And then came the few words from the President. Sherlock found himself unnerved by the eyes of Moran staring down at all of them, smiling as amiably as possible for a man who allowed government approved mass murder every year. Then the video shut off and Mycroft began to speak, making Sherlock wish for Moran back.
“Then there's no sense in offering condolences.”
“Well, are you at least a little happy to see me?”
"Not really my area, Sebastian." I never once looked up from the pages as he talked to me.
Sherlock stood to his feet with the same manic manner as always and looked down at John. He grabbed him by the wrist and kissed him.
"And yours is?" Sherlock said nothing, but gave Lestrade his best haughty, condescending look. The detective opened the door and slipped inside, shutting the door behind him, barring the DI from entering. He stood by the door and waited until he heard the footsteps retreating.
John sighed. “Fine. But you're not going out into London on your own.”
He sighed. He had slept fitfully the night before, and while he hadn't noticed any pain in his leg while escaping the museum, he certainly noticed after the fact, the same old pain creeping up on him with a vengeance. A cruel joke, he thought, since his cane was part of the gallery rubble. He chided himself for not buying a new one from the pharmacy that night, but these practical thoughts kept being pushed from his head by the ring. He would have to deal with it at some point. It wasn't like the painting. He had been given clear instructions on what to do with the ring to an extent.
He paused before he spoke, saying quietly, “Of course.”
. John didn't know
He only smiled, offering no more information.
“I never saw the point in crime fiction. There are plenty of real crimes to read about.”
John frowned, confused. He set his book down, his hand reflexively moving to the side of his face, an expression of concentration that he often assumed when Sherlock wasn't making any sense.
John set the phone down on the table for a minute, holding his head in his hands. He wasn't sure for a while that he could ever lay eyes on the phone again after seeing all that, but he eventually picked it up again and went through the calendar (blank, Sherlock never cared about keeping appointments, after all), and finally, the notes section. John hadn't really expected to find anything there. Sherlock was always the type of person to either remember on his own or scribble it in that little notebook he carried everywhere. But there was one note, which John opened. When he saw the line of text, he reread it at least ten times before he gave in to the tears that he'd been fighting all evening. He sat the phone down, stood, and turned his back. He couldn't look at it any more tonight.
Initially he thought his ears were playing tricks on him, somehow modulating someone else's voice, turning it into the voice he wanted to hear. But no, there he was, standing in the back behind all the seated audience members, the same cocky smile on his face that had so infuriated John the night they met.
“John, I was appalled when I heard. Mary had seemed like such a nice young lady. To think that she –” She shook her head, eyes clamped shut for a second in disbelief. “You think you know a person. Makes you wonder how anybody trusts anyone these days. The news was in a frenzy. You should have seen it. But I suppose you were preoccupied.” It occurred to John that at some point soon he would need to make a statement to the public to finally put them completely at ease, tell them Sherlock would be fine and make a full recovery. The news stations would likely say the same, but he was sure the public would want to hear it from him directly, and as tired as he was, he felt he owed them that much. “Everyone's been by,” she said. “The flat is filled with food and flowers, get-well-soon cards and the like. Everybody has been so kind.” There was a certain weight to being loved by so many people, and John felt overwhelmed by it, having spent so much of his life flying under everyone's radar. He'd expected to have a lot to say when he finally came home, but sitting eating breakfast in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen, he found he had no idea what to say to anyone. “John?”
Sherlock did not stop when night fell.
.” It came out as a terrible gurgling sound, blood distorting his speech. “Run!” John and Sherlock seemed rooted to their places, locked on Henry. He looked up at them once more, his skin growing darker by the second as he bled. “Run!” The word came out strangled, and a crashing came from the brush behind him. John and Sherlock's heads jerked up at the sound, and with one look to each other, they turned away from Henry Knight and ran.
Christmas night, after everyone had gone home and Mrs. Hudson had retired to her own rooms downstairs, Sherlock went directly to his laptop, working like a man possessed on something that he had likely spent the entire evening thinking about. He had never been skilled at relaxed social gatherings, not when he had something on his mind.
“No. And I'm no professor or anything, but it always sounded to me more like someone trying to convince
Better than nothing.
say that jumping off buildings was a terribly unsafe practice, and the more I thought it over –”
“All right.”
"Yes, that franchise you love so much despite its multiple glaring scientific and technological inaccuracies. You haven't had time to see it since we've had so many cases the last couple of months. The card is loaded, naturally. I assumed you would be taking the dull nurse to dinner beforehand. That's what people do, isn't it? Of course, it appears I should have paid closer attention to your current standing with her. Perhaps the doctor instead? You still talk to her, don't you?" Sherlock walked off to the living room and picked up his violin, but he didn't start playing. He just stared out the window, like his mind had been momentarily derailed by a new train of thought.
“That is not what is bothering you.”
Sherlock's eyes lit up when he saw the labs. He strode among the different benches, hands clasped behind his back.
KR: Do you think you'll go back to what you're truly best known for? Fictionalized versions of crimes that interest you? You've covered so many over the years, the Fritzl case, the Canadian Schoolgirl Killer, the West Memphis Three, and of course last year's bestseller based on Genie the so-called “feral child.” Isn't it tempting to go back to that? To all the cases?

"Have you slept any? Eaten anything?"
When he finally found the address on Baker Street, he was convinced he was in the wrong place, as the address led to what appeared to be a sandwich shop, closed and locked up, dark inside. He stared at it from the pavement, feeling like it was watching him somehow, the dark stillness behind the plate glass making him uneasy. He almost turned and walked away, but he finally noticed the residential door tucked to the side of the shop, a gold “221B” gleaming from the dark wood.
“Everyone thinks you've lost it. You haven't seen anyone or spoken to anyone. It's not good.”
John never needed the cane anymore, and his hand never shook. The longer he stayed in Baker Street, the fewer nightmares he had. Yes, Sherlock could be impossible and obsessive, but John was more content when he was around him.
"No. But you can't keep living without your heart, can you?"
John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I'm sorry.”
I felt my back slammed against the bricks of the alley wall, hands running over me, grabbing my wrists. There were lips tracing my jaw, feverish kisses planted all over my neck and face.
The crowd around them broke out into “Auld Lang Syne,” cheers of “Happy New Year,” confetti falling over the room. Some of it fell in Sherlock's hair like snow, and it looked so ridiculous on him, an absurd contrast to the sincere and nearly upset look on his face. John couldn't keep from laughing.
Sherlock tried to aim, to get a clear shot, but Moriarty kept moving just enough. The risk was too high. There was no way he could risk shooting John.
.” Unbelievable. They were willing to send him to die the least they could do was pay attention. His patience wore thinner.
John shook his head and walked back to his bedroom, picking his phone up off the bedside table and dialing a number.
“Of course you did. So what are you? A literature professor?”
KR: Do you ever find, even in books based on existing cases, do you find yourself inserting people you know into the stories? Fictionalized versions of people just like fictionalized versions of crimes?
you will die.
He stopped his train of thought. It was senseless to worry about the long term, wasn't it?
When the moon was already high in the sky, he heard the noises below him. He craned his neck to see over the edge, and immediately jerked his head back out of sight. He clamped a hand over his mouth, trying to muffle his own breathing. Below him, a pack of tributes had come in from the direction opposite the mines. He couldn't hear them all that well from so high up, but they talked amongst themselves for quite a while, and then he realized they had set up camp for the night. After nearly an hour, John had enough courage to try and look over the ledge again, and sure enough, one tribute stood watch over his sleeping comrades down in the hollow. John sat back, cursing to himself under his breath as he added another layer of medication onto his shoulder. Of all the places in these goddamn woods, they had had to choose this one. He only prayed they didn't find him. It felt like a cruel cosmic joke, to escape death once that day and to have it resting below him that night.
Sherlock was quiet through most of these early hours in their trip, acting as if he thought himself a mere background character in John's pilgrimage. He seemed to know that many of the ghosts John was putting to rest involved him, and had likely wondered if John really wanted him there at all. But Rome was tied permanently to Sherlock Holmes, and John refused to let dark memories cloud it for the rest of their lives.
“I could say the same about you.”
Kitty Riley [
spoke highly of him.”
He ignored it.
"Excellent deduction. Although technically, your preposition is somewhat incorrect."
“Do you believe you have any relevant information that would help lead them to the bomber?”
"John had for so long believed that meeting Sherlock had saved his own life that he had never considered that the reverse might have been true as well."
, someone who existed only to give the reader some sort of emotional closure. Mycroft said dedications humanized writers, made them feel more accessible to the public. But Sherlock had never liked that philosophy. And he had never liked being accessible. “They tend to lack sincerity or exist only for factual purposes. For instance, Ella getting a dedication since she was the reason the book was published in the first place. You can quantify her worth. Or the people who dedicate things to their parents out of some sense of familial obligation.”
They looked toward the falls, stepping a little closer as Sherlock looked over. John stared at the very few feet of space there had been between himself and a similar fate. Sherlock gave his arm a squeeze in an attempt at being reassuring.
“Is there anything I can do to help?”
So many of his interactions with Sherlock looked differently colored in retrospect, changed in meaning by all that had happened in Rome. For a while he let himself be haunted by one such interaction, when Sherlock had shown up in his doorway unexpectedly, catching him seemingly staring into space, lost in thought. His appearance had startled him, and Sherlock was, as always, hyperaware of these reactions, but instead of dissecting it like he often did, he let it lie.
"Something like that." Sherlock pulled an envelope out of his jacket and held it out. "Something small, but I am rather new to this gift thing." John stared quizzically at the envelope, part of him wondering if it were some twisted new experiment, primed to explode when he opened it. But he reached out and took it all the same.
“Just a student I knew.” John stopped walking, his face suddenly shifting from mild curiosity to total disbelief. Sherlock was forced to stop and face him. “What?”
"Eventually, Sherlock would have to find a way to leave him, to let himself be struck down by whatever the Capitol had waiting in the woods.  John had to go home.  Couldn't he see that?"
“Wrong.”
She hung up.
“When I head at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd
“It's a fake. Mycroft has already tracked down the forger she used. No sense in making a scene over a fake, is there? No sense in dealing with that publicity nightmare when the painting they already believed to be destroyed is actually a fake.”
Sherlock scoffed at the adjective, but he smiled to himself since John couldn't see him do it. "It's structurally sound." He'd been playing the piece in his head for hours, and was pleased to hear that it sounded precisely as he had intended it to.
“John Watson,” he said, a proud father at a son's graduation.
His room felt empty, not alive as their living room had.
My desire to not reveal myself is what eventually caused me to make an idiotic decision of epic proportions.
John was staring down at the tabletop, fiddling aimlessly with the silverware, when Sherlock said, “Why the dull education major?”
“Yes.”
“That's another thing. My name is John. No one calls people by their last names like that anymore.”
Finally, Sherlock was able to laugh. “I will certainly attempt it.”
It was one thing when John operated under the belief that no one could place him at the Hickman that night. But the very thought of a single man out there possibly holding the key to his hypothetical arrest was staggering.
John picked up the bottle of whiskey. “To replace it from last time.” He glanced over at Felix, “I'm afraid I went through a great deal of alcohol the last time I was here.” Sholto grinned to himself, picked up a few glasses from the side table, and brought them over, sitting in neutral territory between the two of them.
“The way you do these things. It's amazing,” John said with a little laugh, shaking his head.
“Thank you. For everything.”
Sherlock's eyes became animalistic then, violent and enraged. He took one step toward them – Moriarty standing calmly at the end of the sofa – and the red spots of sniper sights bloomed across his chest in a dizzying spray.
John waited for the punchline, the horrible twist that would group this man with all the other people who had passed through this house, but it never came.
“You assume I'm going to take the room?”
John smiled at the few lines of text. The start of something, minus the frankly unnecessary preambles. No tentative approaches, no casual chit chat, no meaningless empty words.
Mike looked past John at Sherlock, who was having visible troubling resisting the microscope. “What exactly makes you think he'd be delusional?”
John watched Sherlock expectantly, waiting for him to name the poet. Sherlock cursed the boy for speaking – even though a certain amount of him sympathized – but there was no way he could tell John the author. No way he could literarily out himself like that.
Sherlock stopped, setting his drink down on the side table by John's chair. He waved him over. John took a few hesitant steps toward him, and Sherlock took the bottle and his glass from his hands and set them down. He reached out and grabbed John's hand, pulling him to the center of the room, positioning his hand on his waist. “You have to learn the man's part.” He took John's other hand and held it out to the side. John was too stunned to stop him. “Now whenever you step forward, she'll step back, and vice versa. Look down for now and follow.” Sherlock stepped back, and John did as he said, stepping forward with him. “It's very simple, I assure you, even for someone with such limited coordination as yourself.” Sherlock walked him through the steps slowly, then faster, occasionally correcting him. “Now, look at me. You can't very well be staring at your feet when you're with Mary.” John stumbled a few times, but slowly got the hang of it. He started losing some of the tension in his posture the more comfortable he grew with the motions.
Sherlock looked around the room. It was someone's home, but this room had been set up as a makeshift clinic. There were little hints of what passed for medicine all over: syringes, cloths, various plants, and occasional vials or bottles of highly coveted medication. Sherlock was laid out on a hard wooden table, no doubt one that was originally intended for dining.
“Perhaps he's just an art enthusiast,” Sherlock said, the glib edge to his voice drawing disapproving looks from both John and Mycroft.
John expected him to begin looking up local papers to see what sort of murders were being investigated, anything of interest, but instead, he just turned it off entirely, something he had never intentionally done in all the time John had known him.
“You think I'm an emotionally bankrupt junkie?”
“He doesn't want to kill anyone.”
“What?”
“How's John?”
I couldn't kill Mike.”
“John, this is Detective Inspector Lestrade and Sergeant Sally Donovan. Dr. John Watson, my assistant.” The two officers nodded at him in greeting. Did Sherlock realize who they were? Had he even paid that much attention to the news about the Hickman?
When he caught up with her at the end of the hall, planning on introducing himself, she turned to him and said, “Hello.” And as soon as she spoke, he recognized her and came to a dead stop.
“A detail. Coming?” John followed. They stepped out into the cold night, an abrupt but not unpleasant shock. “I play the violin. I hope that won't be a problem.”
The man looked up, his hand still braced against the wall. He smiled at John the way a hungry dog looks at meat.
The judges stood above him on a platform, talking amongst themselves. One of them saw him and paused for a few seconds to say he had ten minutes before turning back to his partner in conversation. He might as well have not been in the room. They wouldn't quit talking.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.” He tried to ignore his brother. He'd been down on Earth much more than usual lately, and Sherlock was beginning to think it was just to annoy him.
Neither of them had ever been in Athens, never had a reason to be, and while John could manage some intellectual interest even as tired as he was, Sherlock seemed to not care at all that the Acropolis itself could be seen from their balcony. But then again, why
“I like him.”
Sherlock smiled back, the movements so effortless on his part, even drunk.
Three days later, I came back to our room to find his things gone and mine in a state of disarray. Most of my belongings had been destroyed. The books had been shredded, the pillows and mattress cut open, even the desk chair broken. And spray painted on any surface available, every possible slur and curse that he and his friends could come up with.
After nearly two weeks of this, Mrs. Hudson cut off her own train of thought to say, “Oh! Before I forget! I was wondering where you're living, since you said you only recently came home?”
John laughed a little, smiling at Sherlock. “Well thank god now I won't look like a complete moron at least.”
“Welcome, tributes. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor.”
Sherlock gave the smallest, slowest shake of his head. “No. It's her own fault. No matter the reason. Besides, it wouldn't be the first time I got shot, and it won't be the last.”
John froze, incapable of speech for what felt like the longest time. “How do you know that? I wasn't in any of the papers, and none of the police have come to talk to me about it and I haven't given any interviews. No one even knows I was there, there's no record of me.” He stopped himself, realizing how much he sounded like a guilty criminal trying to defend himself against a heinous accusation.
John craned his neck around, catching one last glimpse of the house before it fell out of sight.
“Now and then one stumbles upon a human being worthy of such a comparison. Not often. But sometimes.”
“Why risk me choosing the right ones, and you having to kill yourself? Why leave your life up to chance?”
“What did you want me to do, Mary? I wasn't going to send in a sad alcoholic like Harry. I stand a better chance than she does.”
No one else had ever used the word "lucky" in speaking about Sherlock. It sounded strange even to himself. He was still getting used to being called something other than "freak."
He had a paperback copy of the book in his coat pocket even then, and flipped through it absently in the cab home. It was more convenient than lugging around the hardback, but he hated the front cover of this copy. It was of an empty room with beige walls. Even looking at it made him feel claustrophobic.
“Sherlock. He's alive.”
Mycroft reached a pinstriped arm out and picked up the sketch. “This is quite good. They won't be able to tell that your heart isn't in it, though I can.”
John crossed the room, shutting the open bedroom door, knowing that the last thing he needed was her wandering leading her in there, which would be instant incrimination. Besides, as far as she knew that was just his bedroom, since she was unaware that he spent most of his years upstairs. She didn't seen to notice this move of his, still taking in the living room as she was.
John scoffed. “They've proven time and again that they can do whatever they want.”
Stupid,
And the more John thought about it, the less likely he found it that, if faced with the opportunity, he would be able to kill him.
When he came to, his hands were cuffed behind him and his legs and torso tied to the chair he was seated in. His head ached, and the cuffs were digging into the skin of his wrists. There was a man in front of him in a tailored suit, grinning maliciously. As the fog cleared from John's brain, he recognized the man from Bart's.
It just seemed to be taking a lot longer than he'd expected.
What a scene it must have been to him, John thought. Walk inside your home and finding someone held at gunpoint by an ex. In a different world, John might have found the whole thing comical, but all he could do with Mary glancing at Sherlock was wish that Sherlock had never come home to this at all.
“Nothing.”
Things began to blur. John began losing any sense of time or place. Instead everything was one long single moment, all smashed together by a human memory that couldn't keep up. In a way, it felt unreal, like such a thing could never happen to them. But John remembered that it was unreal that he had ever even met Sherlock Holmes in the first place.
He grabbed the entire page in one fist, and in a fit of disdain with himself, he crushed it, throwing it across the room.
John was still trying to sort it out, having gone through the remainder of the conversation on autopilot when The Man said, “The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!” And he left with a great flourish of his coat.
"Some idea about not spoiling the holiday spirit?"
“Sorry?”
For a while he felt frozen in a distant forgotten era, watching numbly as Sherlock picked up some of the pages in his uncovered hands, shuffling them with delicacy as Mycroft spoke, the familiar words exploding in John's brain like gunshots.
“Oh,” John said, realizing.
“Sorry?”
“But what about this man knowing who you are?”
Sherlock stayed there a minute, leaning against the shelves, enjoying the momentary silence in his head. What had the agent thought of that remark? Was she clueless, preoccupied with her own work? Or was it so glaringly obvious to her that she was likely giving John hell for it right now? Either way, he enjoyed this, this feeling of not being Sherlock Holmes the Recluse Poet, and instead just being Sherlock Holmes. Strip away all the awards, all the accolades, all the heckling regarding his professional future, and this was what was left. And it seemed almost inviting.
“For what I'm about to tell you.”
He took his first tentative step toward the exit, trying to make the room quit spinning, reaching out for handholds and finding nothing more than what appeared to be a section of caved in ceiling. Two steps later and John found a person in his way, a dark-skinned man lying on the floor, a piece of the ceiling jutting out of one of his legs. The other leg, however, was missing almost entirely, blown off above the knee, flesh and bone exposed and charred. It was such a horrible warlike image that John forced a few deep breaths – which stung,
“Thank goodness they have.”

"Still have good taste where milk is concerned."
“I haven't been able to go back to any of the museums since,” she said, laughing a little. “I suppose that's not surprising.”
“A bit macabre, aren't they?”
The doors at the end of the room whooshed open and the escort from the Capitol, who Sherlock had called Mycroft, strode in, umbrella still hooked over his arm.
Glass rained down on them as the lights shattered. Some of them yelped or screamed. They were thrown into half darkness, in partial silhouette from the one intact light in the very back. They stood in the shadows, finally quiet. Some of them stared at him, mouths hanging open. He was sure they thought he was terribly rude, no doubt an insult to their Capitol manners. But he gave no apologies, and he laid the gun back on the table, and left the room without another word.
“I wish Mycroft and I didn't speak sometimes,” he said, a small smile on his lips, a joking attitude.
“Sentiment is a weakness, John. Surely you know that by now.”
“Yes. Although I suppose that particular line is no longer accurate. Now come on, you have a waltz waiting for you.”
Sherlock watched Moriarty's body fall backwards, splashing as it hit the water, and then disappearing from view as it was pushed over the falls by the current.
“None taken. That's what I wanted to do too.”
“It doesn't?”
The sadness he'd been able to handle – mostly. But he'd had no idea how to deal with the anger that had slowly risen in him more and more with every passing week, the cold rage that made him want to scream at the world. He wanted to hit someone, anyone would do, even a stranger who just pushed past him on the street. There had to be
“Since always.”
John stared at the ground. He couldn't bring himself to say “you're welcome.” Not under these circumstances.
John pushed his way through the crowd to get his coat from his table across the room. He broke through the wall of people and stopped at his chair for a moment, picking up his coat and feeling overwhelmed.
“Who?” Sholto frowned, and John could see him running through a mental list of every human being John had ever mentioned in conversation with him.
How could such a well known man be so unknowable?
“As you all know, this is our 75
He ran his fingers over a piece of clay that had been formed into a hand. That was the only thing he'd been able to get right in this format. He had good hands, ones that Sherlock was sure could strangle just as easily as they could caress. Somewhere along the line, he realized this beautiful contradiction ran through all of The Man. Of course Sherlock's audience would have to be capable of being both brutal and gentle. A warrior heart, a healer soul. It was this facet of personality that made him understand part of the history The Man never told him. Even in his dreams, he never spoke of what had darkened him. But now Sherlock knew. His warrior heart had seen its war, and his healer's soul had done everything in its power to mend its victims.
He was about halfway through his drink, the world already dark outside the windows, when he heard the familiar footsteps on the stairs, and he cursed to himself that his peace was so soon shattered.
She hugged him tight again and whispered, “Be careful, John.”
“Seriously?”
When Sherlock stopped, he was breathing heavily, looking at all the evidence of his touch. He stared hard at John, almost accusing.
John smirked. “I hate to break it to you, Sherlock, but that's illegal now.”
“So what skill did you decide to show them?” John asked. They sat out in the hall, waiting to be called in for their evaluations, the metal of the bench cold beneath them. Irene had given them plenty of advice, explaining how it would go, and despite John being confident in his abilities, he still felt like nothing would be enough to really help any.
He walked up to the Capitol escort, a prim and pompous looking man who asked for his name, and he replied quietly, and was then taken off to the side to wait for the second name to be called.
.” Her smiled broadened as she looked down at him, smug and malicious.
“I'm John Watson. I just moved here. I was just dropping by to meet...”
"Only if you'll do the same for me."
"Jim Moriarty. Perhaps you've heard of me."
“What's so special about him?”
“I don't know. I didn't exactly plan for any of this.”
“Was it the same as whatever happened to that group of three tributes? Or do you remember them at all? You weren't far from them. I found them just before I found you.”
The logic did nothing to temper the shock. “Yeah, thanks for letting me know.”
“Yeah, everything's fine.”
They were nearly out of the store when Sherlock caught sight of a blue scarf, and before he could open his mouth, John said, “Fine, fine,” and let him get it as well. John had to admit it suited him.
Sherlock looked up at him, grey eyes mostly obscured by dark pupils. "It's a rare occasion that I improve a situation as opposed to ruining it."
"Inadequate data." John furrowed his brow as much as was possible through the bandages, a little confused. And then he felt a hand on the unharmed side of his face. "Touch or feeling?"
“There was more curse words involved.”
“Irene doesn't quite understand either.”
“You're not the one who's had to sit through it.”
It was always her place, never his.
He'd never been one to watch the Games much when he was home. But he knew many people who watched religiously, even though the death and bloodshed always made them cringe and cry, always made them feel sick. If they were on screen now, piped into everyone's homes, were the people watching touched with a sense of safety and privacy too, just as they were touched by fear when they watched people die?
