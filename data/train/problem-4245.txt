"You like me?" he asked stunned. Does Dean Winchester actually
Castiel only then realized Dean's rock-hard cock was poking his ass. Biting a moan, he slipped off Dean who was stunned and dizzy, looking at him with an adoring look. Dean's bow legs were spread the best way possible, his heavy cock bobbing so fucking big.
"What was that?"
Dean relaxed more on the bench, today the park was packed, it was Saturday and obviously, parents had the day off and brought their kids to play and spend some time with them. He did the same today, he literally hasn't seen his baby boy all week as the shifts were insanely busy.
Grabbing his bag and car keys, Dean takes Ben's hand and they leave the apartment.
Cas smiled sadly when he tapped the white snowy head of the snowman he made. He had just completed decorating it, carrots, sticks and some old ratty hat and scarf...and stuff.
“Uh…you’re just really beautiful…” Dean blurted, flushing. Castiel’s heart stopped for a second.
Dean stopped for a second and then pulled Cas even closer, licking into his mouth. Cas tightened his grip on Dean's hips.
"Man, I love this song." He said wrapping a hand around Cas' waist, the blue-eyed man squeaked as he placed his hands on Dean's shoulders.
"D-Dean you texte-"
"I...uh-nothing..."
"We both know that's not true..." Dean dropped his voice low and leaned in kissing Cas' cheek.
Which Castiel didn't understand. They were people, like them,
They didn't even make it to the apartment before Dean pushed him against the door and leaned in. Castiel gasped in the best way possible, traveling his hands on Dean's hips.
Castiel froze, his lips part open from the surprise, eyebrows furrowing in confusion.
“I’m going to get Gabriel, I promise… He’ll be safe, you’ll be safe, once and for all.” He said caressing the back of Castiel’s head, his voice hard and promising.
Somehow everything made sense.
Castiel grins softly, he doesn’t know why Dean is surprised. The night he left, Castiel slipped those three words as he begged Dean to stay.
"Fuck you!" he said a bit noisily causing some group of college girls to turn from their booth.
“So, you jump to the next person you see…” Castiel teased, biting his lip when he felt Dean nuzzling the nape of his neck.
He could feel the depressing vibe of the hospital and his anxiety increased even more.
The thing was though, that his location was quite far from the road and the town. Few people knew his cabin. His grandfather build it after the WW2. The property was private.
“Go on a date with me…” Dean said confidently, his eyes sparkling with hope.
He couldn't believe how attached he already became with the wild animal.
Castiel smiled and nodded softly. "That's the plan."
He felt a tap on his shoulders, turning, Cas was surprised to see Dean smiling at him with a hopeful expression.
Some chicks already eyed him hungrily and Dean smirked, yeah, alright he may get laid tonight—forget about a certain
“We had a phone call earlier, anonymously…Well, obviously we all know who that could be. The omegas have Castiel’s little brother—don’t know how the hell they found him…”
in love was still here.
“Gawd, Cas, are you a badass hunter now?” Charlie appeared, wrapping her arms behind him, lifting him up happily. He laughed as Dean rolled his eyes at them, he could see his wolf was worried, but they had time, Castiel would persuade him, after all, he shot a big number of bastards today.
And Dean’s sobs and appreciating moans made him leak wet.
Castiel’s breath hitched, Dean was so close and did he just said he wanted to ask him
Do I look like Dean?” Michael hissed angrily, already putting on his boxers and his shirt. Castiel winced, his heart dropping.
Dean's smile shifted uncertainly. "Actually yes, is it okay? The food here's amazing..."
“I don’t know what you’re talking about…” he growls avoiding Lisa’s judging eyes.
Unwillingly, Dean gritted his teeth, his vision red and his blood boiling inside his veins, he stood slowly, fists tightening.
"You and Ben are so much alike," he suddenly blurts. His face flushes,
And apparently, someone else has already noticed that he's not.
Ben and Claire had huge smiles on.
Time heals.
was what wanted to roll off his tongue.
Castiel missed those touches, he missed Dean. No one was able to make him pant like a horn dog with their sexual abilities, basically Dean was a sex god.
..." Dean's strong arms wrapped around his waist tightly as his own leaking dick rubbed against the older man's stomach.
Yeah..
, oh, boy
“Me too, angel…” Dean said and then glued their lips into a sloppy kiss with too much spit and biting.
“I can turn myself into a wolf,” Dean answered Cas’ silent question.
Castiel opened his eyes, it was dark and his mouth was sour and dry. The blue-eyed star tried to gulp but it was too hard, it felt like he vomited at least twenty times. Adjusting his blurry eyes to the room he was in, Castiel's heart almost dropped when he noticed the hospital room with the nursery equipment and the beeping EKG next to him, his arm stitched intravenously.
Months had passed but he couldn't forget the cold touch of Dean, how he had ripped apart his shirt when they sat in one of the private booths and sank his teeth in Castiel's neck. The world suddenly stopped.
, not only likes him back but came out for him cause he found Castiel
for a second.
, almost. If you scratch the fact that they're dead and sometimes feral.
Charlie steps quickly close, running her hands onto Dean’s shoulders looking confused and panicked. Dean doesn’t blame her, she never seen him like this before.
“Sounds amazing…”
, in a not platonic way!”
Dean groaned grabbing Cas' head with the other hand and running his fingers on the dark locks.
"Daddy! Can I play with Claire and Hazel?" he clutched his dad's arm and bounced erratically as Claire did with him.
“I—uh sorry…” he blurted and grabbed a beer, he winced a fake smile, it was definitely a fake one, he knew his best friend better than anyone, even himself.
Dean nodded still puzzled.
They chuckled together and then Castiel sighed having an urge to tell him his own story. Dean still looked at him deeply and his fingers intertwined with his.
He didn't give a fuck about that small village, it didn't affect him anyhow. Also, the Barbarians?
Like the wolf understood him, he growled softly, paws twitching.
Dean's group plus Rowena and Noah cheered for him all except Cas who looked nervous and concerned, Sam was with Benny and Charlie now laughing hard with tears in their eyes and he also thinks he heard Ellen exclaiming:
Dean pulled away a bit and looked Cas' pretty face, "I
Dean was breathing softly, at least he looked peaceful.
Castiel's heart pounded in his chest. "I almost believed it you know..." he admitted.
"I promise to be your faithful husband. I promise to love you when the sun shines, when the rain falls, in sickness, and in health. When you look at this ring, think of me and remember that I love you
Castiel smiled, a warm feeling blooming into his chest.
"Let's go."
Cas: 32
Starting the engine, Castiel pulled back slowly, even though there were no cars around him to hit accidentally.
, himself made Dean feel, what a desperate mess he was underneath him.
“Fuck, baby…” Dean groaned, leaning back on the bed, one hand to support his weight and the other to hold Castiel’s head gently.
Cas’ brother was nowhere in sight, Dean couldn’t even feel his heartbeat or smell his scent. It was only him and 2 of those sons of bitches.
what Cas is doing and with who. He really
Cas was acting weird, he didn’t meet Dean’s eyes not even once.
Three.
And then Castiel closes his lips around Dean’s cock.
"What are you?"
Dean growled, placing the phone down, and Castiel guessed the anonymous caller dropped the line.
When they all got out, Sam, Bobby, and Benny walked fast, and he was left behind like a lost puppy. He couldn’t let the other hunters see that he didn’t belong. Castiel followed in determining step so he could be right next to Benny. The hunters turned to them; eyes suspicious as well as his friends were. A woman with a pixie cut, wearing a plaid shirt and a green jacket stepped confidently in front of Sam and Bobby, she was probably the leader or the head of their hunter group.
“He’s already gone, isn’t he?”
Sherrif of area 203 came to his table and asked him to follow him. Castiel was hard and scared at the same time, yet for some reason, even though Dean looked scary with his cold green eyes and pale skin, Castiel felt safe. That vampire was a wet walking dream. Tall with broad shoulders and bow legs, don't even let him start about the faded freckles that probably were golden when Dean was human.
But Heath Ledger was better.
Worst 3 months of his damn life.
And the funny thing is, Castiel does not afraid or finds it weird at all. He is a simple Christian,
Dean has so many demons inside him, he’s damaged, he could never have a good thing with anyone.
“It’s fine, red, I missed you too!”
No one was joining anyway, but for some reason, he had to rush and start preparing the food. As far as the routine went, there wasn't much else to do out here.
Dean felt stiff against him and pulled away in a second, stepping a good inch between them. Cas felt cold and unsafety surrender him,
Castiel only prayed that what happened yesterday won’t happen today.
teenagers
“Don’t you dare look at me like that…” he accused, and Sam looked like a confused puppy.
"Bye Dean," Chris waves at him before they get inside the elevator, Cas avoiding his eyes and pressing the button to the ground floor.
for all that time we were apart…” Dean said huskily biting his bottom lip hard.
Dean saw him speak with Sam, he was frowning hard, with a pale face, his hands were trembling as he was pointing what Dean thought was the dead body of the security guard.
Parting his lips and closing his eyes, Castiel waits when Dean's gonna fed on him, sink his sharp fangs in his pulsing vein on the neck. Make him hopefully
Castiel felt the creature’s presence near him, he could smell the blood of its previous pray.
For an unbelievable reason, Cas doesn't get pulled off from the road or has any police vehicles chasing him for speeding the hell out to come here in a few minutes.
After they called their kids who groaned when they announced to them that they're leaving Castiel bent down at Hazel's side, putting himself level with Ben's and Claire's. "Hey, want to help me clip this on?" The kids held Hazel's collar loop steady while Castiel hooked the leash loop on, then he got up and smiled at Dean who returned the soft grin.
Castiel believed in God,
“Cas?”
Falling on his back into the soft mattress Cas almost whined from the loss of Dean's heated skin and body. The other man grabbed his pants and took out a condom, ripping off the plastic packaging. Cas smirked and spread his legs wider palming himself lazily.
Cas is sitting on his couch trying to ignore his heart aching and the image of someone's green eyes and freckled cheeks out of his damn mind.
, it wasn’t supposed to be like this. They were gonna get married. Dean was about to propose when everything went downhill.
Castiel wants to freaking cry,
He only had veggies and creamy sauces, and then potatoes.
, came to enjoy him and paid to see a show. He will give them a show.
"Oh, are you sure? It looked like you wanted to ask me something...sorry about Lisa, that chick always jumps." Dean chuckled softly, eyes searching Castiel.
towel wrapped around his waist.
“Cas, hey man…” Sam immediately got up and Castiel smiled affectionately at him, Dean’s younger brother was even taller now as he hugged Cas in a bear hug.
Before he could pass the booth, driving slowly Castiel glanced the empty space confused, a shiver suddenly ran down his spine.
The green-eyed barbarian opened his eyes once again in this damn nightmare, this time he wasn't in that underground cell. Dean looked around at what seemed to be a large Egyptian court. It was structured of high walls which were topped with towers that were decorated with a rich cornice. A weird aura and energy were circled around this space.
-- days of his life. In a few moments, Castiel Novak will be Castiel Winchester.
“I’ll explain, let’s go find the others…” Dean laced their fingers once again as they started walking towards a big door, Castiel could hear voices, so he guessed the whole pack was there.
“Yes.” He grinned.
Castiel sighed, rolling his eyes in annoyance he dropped the pencil. Grabbing his phone which was next to him, the blue-eyed man stood up from his desk and walked towards his CD player to mute it and focus on the caller.
Dean gave him a velvety chuckle before pressing his lips against Cas', the blue-eyed boy almost slipped a muffled moan. Dean pressed against him and tightened his grip on his waist pulling Castiel even closer.
“But obviously you don’t care a-about me, you just need a h-hole to fuck…P-please stop…just stop.” Cas angrily wipes his tears.
"I'd love to Dean, I really wanna meet your family...then maybe...you could come and live with me in Toronto...we can visit them any time you want."
"Dean relax, it's just Cas..." Sam grins looking at his nervous brother, Dean takes a deep breath and stares at his family and friends who had gathered for one of the most important--
“Cas,” he mumbled between kisses.
Dean was excited to go to the park, his cheeks burned as he was more excited than Ben,
“Shh…it’s alright man…”
Giving him a last hungry kiss which left Castiel to hunt for more, the green-eyed man took his keys out of his pocket and started to unlock the apartment's door. Only a few seconds passed before he and Dean were fighting to undress.
Yeah, everything's
Oh, God.
"Yes of course..."He flicked his eyes on Dean, he was smiling softly at him, eyes crinkled at the corners. "Thank you," Castiel added. "Thank you for taking me out."
Dean wasn't feeling the same.
Charlie tightened the grip around his hand comfortably, “I know...”
Castiel saw stars when the green-eyed man hit his spot.
The crop top that says
he smelled incredible. The green-eyed man felt his dick react to the closeness and blushed when he saw Sam smirking at him.
Sam's eyes widen identically as his own, it was almost comical if Dean's heart wouldn't beat like it was ready to break out of his chest.
He shook his head trying to remove that horrible thought of his head and focus on the road, he was 5 minutes away.
Castiel moaned and understood immediately.
Cas felt hope blossoming in his chest and then his eyes fell on Sam who was in a panic mode as well as he gestured with his head tilt for Cas to do something.
Dean returned the chuckle kissing his cheek. "We, are..."
-" he heard Dean say as he turned around and started walking fast. He needed to get the hell away from the cafeteria. He blurted a 'sorry for bothering you' and was gone.
, until he met Cas.
“Anyways, we should probably go!” Charlie smirked at Dean, and oh God, he understood it all. The sneaky little bit—.
Cas couldn't look away from his lips.
“Tell Winchester to be in the closest crossroad in one hour or the blonde boy is dead.”
wolf?"
“You knew?”
Castiel turns around, his eyes trailing to the half-close door in room 404, then he turns and meets Bobby’s eyes.
"Bed.
” he fell on his knees wrapping his arms around the large animal that was his boyfriend, Dean growled happily, nuzzling Castiel’s neck. The blue-eyed man smiled burring his face in the soft gold fur.
The older man looked at him puzzled and then chuckled darkly when Castiel took his position and pushed him into the bed, he didn't lose time to drag Dean's jeans and boxer briefs in a smooth pull.
"How did you know something was bothering me?" he muttered, clearly speaking only to himself.
, little heartthrob.
The blue-eyed man gasped,
He glanced to his left where Ben and Claire stood giving him toothy smiles. He bend down so he would be their height, they were already grown so much, both of them being now 8 years-old, Ben dressed in a white mini suit and Claire with a long white flower dress. They looked adorable and he couldn't believe they were his and Cas' kids.
Seconds later, what felt like an eternity, the wolfs seemed to communicate silently. If Castiel wasn’t in this position he’ll be fascinated. He loved animals and found it interesting to observe them.
Castiel bit his lips, cause the Barbar was now clean from the battle paint and his beard and short waves were wet and smooth. Looking handsome and so, so
Dean would have been dead too, but when Castiel led his eyes on him, he changed his mind. Those bulky biceps and that handsome face made him change his mind.
"Let me hear you sing!"
"Come here," he said softly.
“We need to leave, there’s a dead body over there…” Castiel suddenly remembered Tomas. He shivered.
Before Cas could lick a long strap on the balls, Dean grabbed him by the shoulders and pressed his lips on Cas', the blue-eyed man immediately kissed back wrapping his arms around Dean's neck.
He can't believe both brothers went into hell...
Minutes later, after Castiel was a whimpering mess Dean finally took mercy on him and slicked his cock with a condom and lube.
“Please, I didn’t do anything wrong…” Castiel cried whispering, tears suddenly coming down his eyes. He didn’t even notice them.
Dean saw with the corner of his eye (the little that he could move) more men like the one in front of him with the same soulless eyes.
Castiel groaned, he could not just sit here and do nothing. His mind played every negative possible scenario that could happen. The blue-eyed man’s heart like all night long started once again beating in supernatural beat. Nerves and terror shivered all over his body.
“I was always a wolf, Winchesters have it in their blood for generations. In the sixteenth year of our life we start formation, meaning we’re ready for our first transformation to a quadrupedal animal.”
Cas shuts his eyes, the tears started falling nonstop as the phone rang two more times.
, he was so done with Dean for sneaking out to go after the omegas by himself.
The last time he saw him, Dean was acting possessive towards him, kissing him and letting Castiel think he didn't want anything from him but his body, for him to have it and nobody else. The blue-eyed man brushed it off as an alpha male behavior, something about being a damn chaser.
, Dean
Dean lifted once again his gaze towards his best friend, almost hopeful.
— and waits.
Carmen glares and steps closer to him, when she is quite close to him Cas gulps nervously,
“Need you now…” he says between kisses.
Everyone was sitting now, and he realized it was time, Sam took his place beside him and Gabriel was on his right where Cas could join soon.
Castiel didn't hate vampires. He actually visited some of their clubs, not here though,
Dean was gazing at him almost all night, licking his lips—and okay, maybe he was eye-fucking him, Cas blushed like a 14-year-old teen.
"Hello, Balthazar..." He grabbed his phone from the bed.
Castiel took a deep breath, sinking into the pillows and his husband's warmth. "Dean. What on earth would I do without you?"
God, how Castiel’s life went from 0 to 100 in 2 days. At least this is better than working with Michael—okay, maybe he’s exaggerating, but the point is, this anticipation is fucking killing him.
Dean started with.
She smirked knowingly, winking at him as she wrapped her arms around his neck swaying seductively at the music.
Dean smiled warmly and made some space for Cas to sit.
“You’re cute…” Castiel smiled feeling no more threatened.
Cas checked around, maybe he felt better and tried to ran and find his packmates? There's no way he got inside the cabin, it was closed.
Especially when Winchester is on the team. Dean Winchester, captain of the Gryffindor’s quidditch team and one of the most popular students in Hogwarts, being from a pure-blood bloodline and having kept the legacy of his own father and grandfather of being the best player in school over decades.
"Nevertheless," he paused for a second, meeting Dean's green orbs, "You may be one of the deadliest men alive, but to me, you are a useless animal..."
“Sorry, I gotta go…” he didn’t care what she would say, he just got out of the kitchen as fast as he could, eyes searching for Cas.
“Dean I—”
The thing was Castiel did not wanted anyone so much in his 2 years of college, he hated the fact that Dean wasn’t single, and he hated more the fact that he was trying to seduce a taken person.
Carmen smirked, an evil glint in her eyes.
Cas' face falls hearing the slur this woman used, he never heard her say that, but he is not surprised, Carmen is a straight hetero bitch.
The thing was Cas wasn't Cas without risky decisions, even though they might destroy him. Also, he couldn't help but not to bunder under Dean's gorgeous and puppy-like gaze.
Dean even though has some cuts on his cheekbone and a large bruise on his temple, with messy hair and pale skin contrasting his freckles and dark eyelashes,
He nodded smiling and slid into the sheets next to Dean who immediately pulled him into his chest and kissed him on the nose. Cas melted into him and closed his eyes breathing Dean's heady sweaty skin.
Placing himself between Castiel's legs, Dean started biting and nipping at his neck which had Castiel moaning loudly and wrapping his arms around his neck. He rocked his cock with Dean's own and he could come at any second.
Castiel’s probably still dizzy to imagine this, what Madam Pomfrey
“Dean stop…” Cas puts his arms in his stern to push him away.
Cas’ eyes widen at the confession and before he can answer to him, Dean closes the gap between them, pressing his lips into Cas’ plump ones.
He stroked the Barbar's thick veiny length slowly.
And he wanted Dean, Dean is his toy now. And with those other Barbarians in the way made the situation more unfinished. So he'll end it now.
“Stop teasing…” Dean choked breathlessly.
Time to ask out Dean Winchester.
His heart broke again but Cas didn't let it take him down. He'll help the poor animal. And if it's going to die, at least it would be in a warm place with someone who'll pet them and care for them even if it's only a couple of hours.
"Yeah, got a work call in half an hour, but hey, hope to see you guys tomorrow..." Dean almost looked hopeful.
Castiel opened his mouth to speak again, but Dean flickered with a supernatural speed once again that Castiel's eyes couldn't properly process, and he found himself pressed fully against the back of his Smart, Dean's nose buried in his crook of the neck.
Nobody likes her apparently.
"Yes, you mentioned it." he answered playfully as well, grinning when he felt Dean chuckling.
Dean's cock rammed against Cas' prostate with every thrust, and it wasn't long before he was coming inside him. The green-eyed man's hips stuttered and he braced his feet against the floor pressing deep into Cas.
Red probably took him upstairs.
"Oops..."
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, “What’s wrong?”
For some reason, Cas believed him, however, this whole situation was weird and really confusional, did he seriously thought Cas was that dumb? The freakiest thing was that Dean claimed to be the wolf.
Dean turned himself around as Castiel couldn't manhandle the two-his-size man.
"You know I do..." he moaned when Dean climbed up on the bed, crawling over him, with a hungry smile.
His heart was about to explode as he tried to start the fucking engine
“Jeez, Cas calm down, I can feel your aura, and believe me it makes me depressed…Dean is gonna be alright, he’s the strongest wolf. And your brother is safe, our Alpha is going to get him.”
"Yours..." Dean murmured against his lips.
! His consciousness screamed.
Undressing was chaotic, confused mess of hands and mouths and buttons and zippers. It was a great sensation, having Cas under him this way. His cock strained up when Cas' grasping fingers hooked in the band of his underwear and peeled it off.
“Don’t lie to me…”
Dean's heart was beating in a
The wolfs were now throwing themselves on his car, making it shake hard. The Alpha lied down, a pool of blood around it as it breathed heavily.
He was sick, this can’t be happening.
Castiel pricked up his arm and opened his palm, small white sparks like lightning jerked from his fingers. Energy rushing all over his body, dark magic running through his veins.
Cas called him all the time like that.
“See you, try not to give anybody else false hope like you did to me.”
Castiel pulled back with a loud pop, his chest was already heaving, Dean looked so hot as his bottom lip was shiny and pink where he'd been biting it.
“No.”
“I wanted to ask you out for a very long time…” the captain admitted kneeling, so he was in the same height as Castiel, hands resting on his mattress.
Cas closed the distance between them, wrapping his around Dean's neck pulling him in for a kiss. Dean groaned shocked but didn't stay like that for long. His arms wrapped around the dark-haired man's waist pulling him impossibly close.
He hadn't gone far when he saw something at the base of a tree.
Cas started kissing Dean's thighs loving the hairs that tickled his tongue and continued until he was nose deep in Dean's clothed bulge. The sounds that came out of Dean made him almost go insane. Fuck,
“Cas, you’re so hot…uh…f-fuck.” Dean reached Castiel’s cock and started stroking it fast as his thrusts.
"What?!"
“Thanks, Cas…see you in a bit.” He hangs up with shaky fingers and shoves his phone in his pocket.
"Baby, I'm close-"
"Who the hell are you?"
Before he could react, the wolf was in front of him. Dread flushed over Castiel’s body, but the creature was on its back, shielding him.
Dean thrust in once again, as Castiel's hole clenched around his cock, milking out every last drop of cum.
Dean feeling so much better, jumped from the bed, tossing his cover sheet away, he finally felt his energy and strength stronger as it was before, his head no more dizzy and no more bone-melting impression.
"Yep."
His heart was about to explode, his voice shaking with fear still whispering the prayer.
him more.
The worst thing was that Dean was driving to Castiel’s place, he was coming to talk to Castiel, that’s what Sam said to him on the phone.
Hope u enjoyed this fluffy with a bit angst finale.
Before one of those mutts got close enough to him growl-smirking with ugly yellow rotten teeth, one of the others turned fast enough his ugly snout moved to scent, ears perking up.
“Move, move ya
Cas closed his eyes; it takes him at least a minute to find the courage to speak with his voice steady.
“Of course, I’m
"I bet he loves you very much..."
"That's the plan,
"Yeah but-"
"How this gonna work Dean?"
"How was that?" Dean asked, kissing his way up Cas' chest. The soft scratch of his beard was almost divine on the blue-eyed man's oversensitive skin. His already rock-hard cock leaked against his stomach, throbbing desperately with every moment he wasn't being touched.
Castiel’s social anxiety went in full red.
Dean nodded and tightened his grip on his hand.
Jody gave him a smirk, but it wasn’t dark, just playful, then after some silence, Sam cleared his throat.
Castiel's heart dropped.
Putting his now cold hands in his pockets, Castiel continued walking, passing the nightclub and the hungry stares from the vamps that followed every move of his with their cold eyes.
Dean pulled off and Castiel almost whined from the loss of the warm mouth, after giving a last peck on his lips, the Alpha started to unbutton Cas’ blue dress shirt.
Too bad someone else doesn't get affected by his charming smirk. Someone, really pretty, with the bluest eyes alive, those oceans of blue sapphires, those skies of--
He came unexpectedly.
"You fucking. Faggots!" she screamed like a maniac, Dean tightened his grip on Cas as he winced, hurt flushing on his face, all around were heard shocked gasps and whispers.
They stayed in the Roadhouse for still thirty minutes before Dean took the bill and came back with a smirk, "Wanna come to mine to hang out? Ben's with his grandma, so the place is all ours..."
Cas felt Dean's hot lips on his jawline as they walked towards the fireplace, which burned warm heat. Without a lot of motions and without Dean getting tired of having Cas in his arms, he took the woolen cover-up of the small couch next to the heating area and threw it on the floor.
He whined, it was so fucking good, no wonder everybody in the campus said Dean was sex on legs.
baby, you can't even imagine how beautiful and perfect you are..." Dean murmured thrusting painfully slow,
They stand there, in each other's arms for what it feels like an eternity, and Castiel thinks not even eternity is enough. Both of them clinging onto each other. Dean lightly stroking his hair and Castiel breathing in the green-eyed man's neck, the warm flesh making feel like he's home.
"Come here,"
Castiel was pushed behind a girl, her fruity scent and short cheerleader skirt made his face fall.
. Castiel starts praying panicky as he climbs to the back seat.
Castiel snorted but his dick twitched in interest.
! I lost my phone at the airport on my way here! I came from the US here to surprise him!"
"Alright let's go buddy."
Cas grinned affectionately and then glanced at Claire. "Claire, what do we say?"
how could he do this to Castiel? he was on tour goddamnit! His biggest album was no.1 in 70+ countries and his worldwide tour is one of the best selling tours in history.
After realizing Dean's probably alone he took a seat next to him and offered another apology.
and as Britney said, his loneliness was killing him.
Castiel’s eyes widened, with the corner of his eyes he could see Gabe and Char smirking at each other, obviously realizing Castiel is shocked that his crush is here too.
you! You went alone, to hunt those blood poisoned bastards! Without any
Cas has avoided him the past month, ignoring his phone calls and answering his texts coldly. He was dying to talk to him like he used to, but it was safer not to remind himself how his best friend never will be more.
Dean gritted his teeth even more.
He crosses the hallway in a quick step and then his eyes fell to the people outside Dean’s room. His breath hitches when Castiel recognizes Benny, Dean’s best friend.
Sam frowned sighing, he nodded understandingly, the younger wolf made a motion to follow him, Castiel immediately did, following Sam like a lost puppy.
"Yes, Dean?" Castiel mumbles into his neck.
He was so
Lust was wrapped all over his body, blood running through his cock as he felt it fattening inside his short tunic.
Cas let out a shaky sigh, his knees weakening as he fell on the floor. Hugging his legs, the blue-eyed man leaned his head back to the wall, then his phone started to ring.
Rushing inside, he needed to found his first aid kit, some water, food...what wolves ate, expect raw meat? He didn't have any raw meat.
The blue-eyed himself didn't take long to undress his suit jacket and dress shirt. Dean already crawled over him, kissing his stomach and then traveling slowly towards his stern, his collarbone, and then his jawline. Cas gasped moaning into the heated kisses, running his fingers in Dean's sandy hair.
His heart was about to explode but only looking at the most beautiful man in the world calmed him down a bit, he was afraid Dean would be pissed and start throwing curses at him but he just stood there stunned, his eyes glossy from the overwhelm.
Leaning his palm to the tomb doors, the demonic runes identify his dark energy and open up in a slow dragging. Sliding inside with his silk long robe around his bronze nude body, Castiel grins devilishly as his eyes fall on the Barbar.
That was the last thing Castiel heard before he blacked out.
, no one's watching him, even though earlier 3 ladies flirted shamelessly with him, oh the disappointed shocked look they gave him when he said he was gay.
Dean bit his tongue.
..." he answers quietly and cowardly, feeling Cas' look watching his every move.
Dean thrust in, not stopping until he bottomed out. Castiel's muscle swallowing him whole as he clenched around the thick girth.
… Castiel’s shocked expression turns into concern when he sees the big bloody bruise on Dean’s ribcage.
"W-What?"
The blue-eyed man's heart dropped for the millionth time tonight,
"Dean, your wound..." Cas whispered breathlessly remembering the bullet wound.
"I don't want him,
..." Dean growled, his lips inches away from Castiel's.
He hears Sam take a shaky breath, imaging the younger lad nodding without realizing he’s on the phone.
“Cas…” he shouts, voice breaking.
Benny was next to him, the grey wolf protectively having Cas’ back as he carefully ripped those bastards without drawing a drop of poisonous blood.
, its alright babe…” Dean assured him, kissing his knuckles.
, he was done with work, Castiel was dreaming about sleep. Also, he couldn't wait to smoke some weed to relax faster.
So, it hurt, and Cas hated the reason, hated that he was jealous of her, that the love of his life was going to wake up with her every day.
"Anyway, we have to go. You don't mind we take the elevator, right?
“She left…”
Dean throws the bottle right at the wall in front of him, pieces of glass shutter everywhere. His heart clenches in an odd way,
God bless his 160 dollar ‘Acqua Di Parma’ cologne.
"You'll never have to find out." Dean's kiss was warm on his temple.
“Where’s Sam?”
Castiel's sarcasm encircles his frustration at Dean and the lawyer feels worse than before.
Cas pushes him harder, and Dean stumbles stepping back, still dizzy from their make out. Confused he reaches for the dark-haired man’s hands, needing his touch.
Dean moaned and lifted his head up so Cas could have more access to his neck, fingers still massaging Cas' scalp, the other wrapped inside the blue-eyed man's henley tightly on his exposed and warm waist.
“No,” Sam’s eyes flashed with gold light but only for a second before coming back to their natural hazel green, “but is our only hope to get Dean and Gabe out of this mess…”
Cas carefully stepped even closer, the pile of fur didn't move. It wasn't breathing. the blue-eyed man rounded the tree and gasped.
"Dad! Dad! Can we play with Hazel?" his daughter clutched his arm and bounced excitedly, the other boy which Claire played in the last hour was looking at him with big dark eyes too.
His consciousness started screaming on the back of his mind. Castiel's heart clenched. Dean’s here to check if he were okay, everyone could do that. Well, except Luke Vaught from Slytherin, that lad was
Dean swallows.
Dean smiles again pulling Cas into a bear hug, Cas almost melts into Dean as his eyes water again, his best friend tights his arms around him humming happily.
Charlie and Benny, Dean's closest friends never said anything about him being drunk every day since then, Castiel still couldn't believe Sam was so late to tell him this situation.
Castiel needed Dean, even if he was a snack target,
The king got up in a sexy elegant way, walking slowly and coming closer to Dean's way, he then only noticed he was unchained and only wore a satin short tunic around his hips. At close, the king was even more breathtaking, his dark hair was short and fell down on his forehead, small rocks of sapphire graced his ears and his broad shoulders were glistering.
, Castiel avoided once again that burning stare.
When the engine started, the Alpha almost passed out, the poison probably mixed with his blood making his healing process way harder and slower.
Before Castiel could say anything else, Dean leans in, eyes locked on his, their bodies pressed incredibly close. He feels lips on his neck, hot sinful lips kissing the skin right above his Adam’s apple.
." Dean said and led Castiel into a small bedroom with a queen-sized bed. Dean then grabbed his face with both hands and drew him in for a filthy kiss full of promise, his still boxer-clothed cock rocking against his own.
"You burned one of my villages...
And then it hit Castiel.
Cas was concerned.
Cas' lips parted from the surprise, he thought Dean left, but obviously, he did
He took a shaky breath, his heart melting watching Dean’s best friends and his uncle here.
Ben so he could provide him everything he needed. But it wouldn't bring the hours he didn't spend with his son. At least they were together all day at Weekends.
After a few minutes of Dean fucking him with his thick fingers, opening him up and sucking at the same time his nipples and collarbone Cas felt greedy and needed Dean's cock ASAP. He already felt his hole slick and loose, ready for Dean's cock.
Castiel wasn't surprised when the Barbar pressed their lips together for a filthy kiss. Wrapping his arms around the larger man's broad shoulders, the young emperor melts onto him. Smirking between their kisses, Castiel wraps his legs around Dean's waist too.
Missouri the priestess, took place in the middle and Dean knew that Cas was close.
It felt quite familiar but so new at the same time. Castiel tingling his fingers in Dean's short spikes as the green-eyed man starts walking them into his bedroom.
Castiel flushed him a bright soft smile.
Looking at himself in the small mirror of his bathroom, he tried to fix his messy hair but he remembered that Dean told him that he looked amazing like that so he just left it as it is. He also hadn't shaved and his pants were still missing.
Apparently, that was what Dean needed to hear before pulling his tank top over his head in a smooth motion. Castiel's eyes darkened when they fell onto Dean's toned chest, the flaming pentacle tattoo contrasting darkly in the green-eyed man's pale and freckled skin.
Both of them hissed a bit but it wasn't long before Castiel climbed up onto Dean's lap, settling his knees on either side of his waist and then wrapping them around it. He draped his arms over his husband's shoulders and drew him into another kiss, heated this time.
Cas was dressed up like…Harley Quinn,
"I'm Castiel, by the way...Since now I'm your new master. You're mine forever Dean of Winchester," he announced with a proud seductive grin, his hands still on Dean.
"Dean?" Castiel was still, his voice barely a whisper.
, boy..." Cas' heart clenched for making the animal hurt so much, but he finally got it out, it could catch an infection, also the bullet is so damn heavy...and very
His consciousness tells him.
Dean turned to her, eyes dark, “I don’t care. They have an innocent person. As an Alpha, is my job to keep innocent people safe.”
Castiel flinched scared when another loud growl came out from the big wolf, the black one once again cried submitting to the Dominant.
you…” His voice breaks.
“That’s why you left that night?” Cas asked silently, ignoring his other questions.
There was nothing there to help him or the other wolf. He could drive the hell away from here, but he couldn’t leave the animal,
Dean was immediately behind him, Castiel almost forgot the green-eyed man could feel his emotion auras.
When he left, Castiel felt a big part of his heart empty. He already had loneliness issues but the night they separated, was the last drop, his depression came back.
“We had an Alpha, Asmodeus. We were a big pack, but the problem was that asshole was biting innocent people, he wanted to make the whole town into wolfs, he thought he’s a king. My mom…” Dean’s throat suddenly tightened.
He smiles softly, pressing even closer to Dean. Yep, he could so much get used to this.
After Dean, Bobby and Benny ran through the woods, cause obviously if they’ll turn in their human form, they’ll be naked, Sam was the only clever one to undress before turning for the battle.
Seconds later they were gone, and it was just him and Dean, not even madam Pomfrey. Castiel blushed cause Dean still looked at him with those sparkly green-gold eyes.
"You know the deal," Dean said huskily.
—it was kinda dark with the lamp above him trembling.
Sammy burst into silent laughs, and Dean wanted to slap his stupid floppy hair. Then he watched Benny and Charlie entering the conversation of Cas and that sonovabitch Noah.
There's the silence, there's Cas' last chance..
"Sorry," Dean said but didn't really sound sorry at all.
Castiel crawled into his bed, his heart clenching from the pain and need.
He lifted himself and started to run back to his car, his legs felt like jelly and his knees were ready to fail him.
"Hello Dean, I was wonderi-"
If this will be repeated again tomorrow, he has to grab a lunch and a dinner from the restaurant across his Company.
Sam and Bobby got out from the truck quickly and Cas stumbled to get up as he glanced at the strangers—well Bobby, he knew Sam, those dorks were basically
“So, where were we?” Anna purred next to his ear and Dean almost flinched from the cringe.
"Fuck, Cas...
Suddenly the door opens, stream floats outside the bathroom. Cas gasped when a naked, wet man walks out.
He didn't know what he did to deserve Cas, the most caring, kind, funny, and gorgeous man in this whole damn universe. Dean's heart was beating extremely fast from the excitement and the sight in front of him. Cas will be his,
Castiel turned his attention back to the green-eyed man.
his conscience told him.
Dean looked even more gorgeous closer, those shoulders were even broader. Cas gulped, his social skills leaving him as they hide somewhere he'll be not able to find.
"That's the plan." Castiel's fingers furrowed gently through his hair, tugging softly at the strands then smoothing them down under his palm. Before Dean could even close his eyes at the soft gesture, the king's eyes flicked down to the needy bulge in his tunic.
"He's the devil..."
Castiel loved that, how
"Date
"You're fucking
Same here.
, Castiel a not important cook from Austin. A boring and awkward person who everybody thinks is weird.
“Hey,
Dean's finger felt amazing, he couldn't wait for his cock.
Dean smiled softly and climbed into the bed, into Castiel's arms, burying his face in his neck and wrapping his arms around him tightly. Castiel relaxed instantly at Dean's solid weight, and comforting scent he so much loved.
"What do you mean?!"
The dark-haired man whimpered and let his legs fall back to the floor as he felt come leak out of his abused hole. Dean growled possessively leaning and starting to bite and nip kisses all over Cas' neck, when he had enough, their lips meet.
in a human body.
“I was planning to get laid tonight and not think about your beautiful ass in these shorts.” Dean said hoarsely, his hands getting lower in Cas’ ass.
So, there were two versions here. 1) Dean hadn’t come out yet, and 2) he was bi and didn’t feel the connection with
"A-Are you sure?" Sam asks.
“I only have eyes for you angel…” the Alpha said quietly, kissing his temple as he tightened his grip around the accountant.
Castiel and Dean dressed up quickly, the accountant was still shaking, and his face was pale, his eyes blurry. Dean gave him his own clothes, some jeans and a black tee with a blued plaid, they were a bit big but comfy.
he hissed, pressing down again as his whole body tensed impossibly tight and then released. Castiel shot a seemingly endless stream of come between their bodies, making them once again groan and moan in unison.
“Cas, hey buddy.” Sam ignores Dean and envelops the shorter man into a bear hug—
“I’m gonna get him, I promise…”
...ready boy?"
"I'm gonna fuck you so good..." Dean said and pushed inside Cas' heat.
"Where's Dean?" one of them asked quite civilized at what he did not expect. The man was young, could be the same age as him,
A dull pain throbs in his chest, digging his palms into the dent of his eyes, trying to stop the sobs.
"Alright, I say that's enough depression, everything is fine now. Let's dig in!" Dean said striking him again with one of those beautiful smiles. He then hesitantly took Castiel's hand and kissed his knuckles.
that may be a little false as Ben was bouncing with his toy car at the door of their small apartment for almost ten minutes.
The redhead wolf didn’t answer, her eyes fell on the ground, that’s all Castiel needed to know
“It’s not my child…” Dean blurts suddenly, green eyes sparkling in the dark room.
Nuzzling on his neck Cas gave him a whimper, "You smell so good..."
Cas giggled, "You little shit better feel the same tomorrow or I'm killing myself and then you..."
"Would you like to grab a coffee in the morning?" Dean whispered in his hair.
"You gonna do fine old man..." Claire said as she buried herself inside the Winchesters' arms hugging him too. Dean then chuckled even more, his nervousness leaving his body. He gave kisses at both of his kids' heads and got up.
Dean Winchester was always in his mind.
“You’re so fucking perfect…” Dean rasps before pulling him onto his chest. He places Castiel on his lap and presses his mouth on his.
Dean winced when a slap of cold water hit him on the face, it was icy cold and made his shivering skin even more biting.
He grabbed his cock stroking it a little for relief but then he felt Dean’s lubed finger inside of him.
"Uh- me t-too-"
Castiel's heart dropped once again with more panic,
Castiel made a mess in his hair with his fingers so it would look like sex hair and fixed his favorite yellow bee T-shirt, his black ripped jeans hugged his ass amazingly.
The blue-eyed man couldn't understand, everything was a sensational blur in his mind, he felt his cock harden as Dean pressed his own massive erection against him.
“Kiss me…” Castiel pulled Dean’s face away from his crook.
Dean gives them a last nod, before turning away to walk towards the back exit.
Dean as well was in whimpering chaos.
When his family was alive, they always cooked old family recipes, spend days climbing and exploring the woods, sometimes his father and Anna were the whole day in the kitchen, perfecting the recipes their grandmother did back then.
It didn't take long before he pressed his cock on Dean's chest harder and started grinding in fast motions,
He needed the Alpha so much, he missed Dean and
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
He suddenly felt frustrated and angry. Not with Lisa but himself. He left Dean and erased him from his mind for all this to happen.
Dean was now
Dean sucked into Cas' lips,
“Cas, calm down, Benny, me and Bobby will go after him soon, we have a plan. A shitty one, but it’s our only hope…”
When they finally made it to the bunker, strong arms wrapped immediately around him, Dean buried his face in Castiel’s neck holding him tight.
Charlie’s features soften as she frowns. Damn it, why does Dean have to cry? Can't he be a normal man and not cry? He thanks the gods that no ones’ here except Charlie.
Castiel's smile was wicked, eyes the literal Egyptian blue. Dean then couldn't move, it was like he was a statue,
The song continued but Dean already shoved the mic to some chick who was telling him something flirty, his group was applauding him and whistling praises with jokes and laughs, but Cas was quiet and still shocked.
In a few seconds, he is in his wolf form, running through the woods.
Castiel's cock was trapped between Dean's stomach, leaking pre-cum, the Barbar shoved his face into his neck as he walked towards the large mattress with the bluest silk sheets. Wet droplets slipping all over their bodies.
Obviously, he was into Castiel, they talked, and he flirted so hard with the dirty blonde stud, seeing him blush and lose his words when Castiel complimented him—always when his girlfriend was not looking, he had some dignity for
He took Dean’s hand which was wrapped around him, bringing his knuckles to his lips and kissing them softly before placing his own hand on top of them.
The blue-eyed man wiped hardly his tears with the back of his hand and walked towards Dean.
Then out of nowhere, just a few minutes before he was about to enjoy his night, perform in front of Manchester, his whole world collapsed. Castiel tried to reach Dean but the bastard didn't return his calls.
Replaying his name in his mind was a torment so Castiel took a deep breath.
But Dean, that son of a bitch, with those gold-green eyes and that fucking smile, started acting like a boyfriend to Castiel, buying him drinks on the bar he worked and always having his arm around his shoulders, pulling him close when they were out with their squad.
"Mmm, yeah, beg for it, baby." Castiel rolled his hips, moaning lightly and clenching down on Dean's cock which was stretching him so good,
Cas I missed you so much…” Dean said between wet kisses.
Yet, he knows he ain't crazy.
The accountant gripped the gun he had tighter, his heart beating in a supernatural beat
"I was twenty-eight and Ben almost 12 weeks old when Lisa left him on my doorstep, at the beginning I didn't want to do anything about it, the idea of having a kid was not in my plans. But she just left him there and disappeared like she didn't care. It only took one look at him, and I was in love and wanted him, wanted to protect him and love him with all my heart. I knew he was mine but my brother still insisted to take a test. It was 100% correct." Dean sighed, and Castiel reached out and took his hand.
Castiel snorted and tightened his arms around Dean's hips leaning on his bare shoulder, it smelled sun-screen and Dean's pure musk,
"Yeah, that's it my love..." Castiel praised before bending down again and licking Dean's mouth.
“I’m going to get him,
"Sam?"
With his hand on Dean's face, Cas leaned and pressed his lips to Dean's, he couldn't help it anymore, the desire was too strong. The blue-eyed man never imagined this adulation towards someone. Especially, someone, he knew for a couple of minutes.
Castiel knew he scared the hell out of Dean, and that was the last thing he wanted. But that fucking false text broke his heart, yet the only thing he regrets is how stupidly and dangerously he dealt with it. He hoped whoever did him dirty had been at least arrested.
In the same sentence? You think I'm not gonna notice that?" Cas frowned perking his eyebrow.
The tall man had sandy hair and a matching beard, his eyes were the greenest he ever saw, his toned chest and thick biceps were wet and tanned. Cas trailed his eyes down and blushed immediately.
"You scared me to death..." Dean choked tightening his hands on Castiel's.
His heart always skipping when he saw those eyes, anger and possession feelings when Cas was hanging out with other guys, and goddamnit every time when Dean needed someone to talk to, he always called
His prayer crushed down when he felt Dean getting up, his warm skin leaving Castiel’s body. Dean sat on the bed and took out the condom full of his come, tight it into a knot and threw it to the trash basket next to Castiel’s nightstand.
“Where are we, Sam?” Castiel asked as he couldn’t see quite well in the dark room across him.
“Hey, babe…” Dean smiled weakly, looking at Cas like he used back when they were dating.
Dean sped jerking his cock and he couldn’t help it, he snapped his hips forward and broke, spilling thick come all over his chest and even his chin. It didn't take long before Dean groaned choking and burying his face in Cas' neck, panting hard as his hips spasm, emptying his orgasm in the condom.
but Dean was different. He was kind, charming and so, so handsome. He came as a bi a few months ago, though Cas hadn't seen him with a boy,
“I want to come too!” Castiel blurted immediately, he needed to help some way, he knew it was hilarious for him to play a hero, 3 days earlier he ate ice cream with Alfie watching Gilmore Girls.
"You are beautiful Cas, I can't believe you're  finally mine..."
He can’t help himself but always think about all these things after Dean finishes their night.
"If you're not sure what to order, I have a few favorites," he added a couple of seconds later.
Dean shook his head and smiled at the sexy guy, damn it's been long since he found a handsome-looking man, usually he enjoyed chicks, and very rarely men, as the most were not so attractive to him, but this one.
The last few weeks were quite loud, tourists from every corner of the States came to Austin, especially after the new Vampire Club--
“Baby...mmm.” he feels Dean’s hand on the back of his neck pushing him even closer to him, seconds later his lips were on his jaw, and then cheek and then chin, he kissed him everywhere making Castiel giggle.
"It's alright boy...I'm Cas, by the way." he huffed a chuckle, is he for real? introducing himself to a wild animal?
“I-I uh…”
“You must be starving…” he said heading down to the kitchen.
He shook his head and Lisa frowned as she pulled away from his chest to look at him in the eyes. Dean blinked confused and then smiled awkwardly at her.
After Cas placed the turkey in a bowl along with a bowl of water in front of the wolf, he smeared some tepid water on the wolf's dry, cracked nose, and when he opened his mouth and lolled his tongue out, Cas poured a little on there too. The wolf lapped once, then again, and then almost the whole bowl of water was empty.
When she left they leaned in close again, and Castiel longed to reach out and touch Dean. The green-eyed man's warmth was nice and the blue-eyed man felt a connection between them.
Cas just stared at him, tilting his head a bit, confusion was obviously an understatement.
Castiel saw fucking
"Dean..." he whispered,  all the warmth and affection he felt for the wolf was spilling over onto Dean so easily.
Ben's eyes lit up,
Castiel gasped when Dean quickened his pace on his cock and his thrusts, his fingers tightening on the blue-eyed man's, slamming into him, Castiel couldn't keep it more, he shot an ostensibly endless stream of come between their chests.
The hazel-eyed wolf took out some keys in his pocket, Castiel watched curiously as Sam unlocked the door in quick easy moves. The chain fell with a heavy thud.
He stayed calm trying to take small gentle breaths, he couldn’t afford a panic attack right now.
It's karaoke night tonight at the Roadhouse and some people had already sung but now, they played old hits and Britney's...
The people he most loves are in danger; It’s the worst feeling ever.
shows amazingly his toned flat stomach and Dean has breathing problems now.
He laced their fingers together, making Castiel relax a little, the tension falling off from his shoulders.
Before he could follow him, Charlie’s voice stops him.
Cas just frowned even more, he looked cute as hell.
"Hmm...c-close," Dean hummed, making his ass vibrate in the best way possible.
"Hey, Cas," Dean noticed him and beamed widely, gifting him a boyish grin, "Join me?"
Cas... I waited for you so long..."Dean growled deep in his throat and met again Cas for a searing kiss.
“Damn, bossy.” Dean chuckled between their kisses as he worked his jeans button, unzipping the zipper.
Dean's phone started ringing, Cas sighed in disappointment when the green-eyed man lifted his finger to give him a second before disappearing into the crowd.
When Dean didn't respond, the blue-eyed beauty continued, his voice steady and deep.
Castiel pulled away a little and finally faced Dean, he had a huge soft grin on his beautiful face, before the blue-eyed man could admire even more his features, Dean pressed their lips together.
"Hello, it's Castiel, right?" The man with the most gorgeous eyes asked
“If things get messy, call the hunters…” Dean’s jaw was tight, this was their last solution, even though the local hunters hated them, they hated the mutant omegas more.
"Come in, I guess..." he trails sarcastically.
He just prays the end will be happy.
“Okay, I get it. You could at least be more discreet.” Lisa sighs and pulls back from him rolling her eyes.
Dean huffs a chuckle but it doesn't reach his eyes, his green orbs suddenly are distant. Castiel feels his heart stop for a bit, he hoped he didn't put Dean in an uncomfortable situation.
“I never stopped…”
"I love you too, assbutt, I can't believe you did all this..." Cas chuckled softly as he started buttoning Dean's shirt up. Dean then blissfully buried his face in Cas' shoulder holding him tight.
His grits his teeth once again when his eyes catch the couple leaning close ready to kiss. His face red and his veins pulsing with anger.
"Yes, nobody touches you but me..."
Castiel meant
Castiel told him about him working at this Law Firm, here in Lawrence and his eyes sparkled as he mentioned his brother who worked there too. Generally, their conversation was nice and so easy, Castiel gave everything to not read too much into it.
“I didn’t save him for this shit…” he said wrapping his arm around Castiel’s waist, he and Charlie laughed.
s-so much..." Castiel froze for a second, his stomach dropping.
When Sam pulled away, he gave Castiel a pat and got out the room.
I’m going to make you feel so good, fuck you
The blue-eyed man smiled, and Dean gave him a soft smile right back as they started walking behind the girls, everything’s gonna be fine, it’s just a party anyway.
“That night…”
“Later…”
, what if he’s already—” he choked.
"Dean, you're drunk..."
. The green-eyed man acted like a jealous boyfriend.
He might be still fully in love with Dean and miss the shit out of him, but he finally started to move on...
..yeah that's it.
, when she hung out with his squad and brought that beefcake with her introducing him as her boyfriend Castiel could not take his eyes off him.
He closes his eyes for a second and then parks his car in his company’s garage, waving at Tomas, the security guard.
He ran out Castiel’s apartment pushing him to the ground painfully hard when Castiel tried to stop him seeking explanations.
"It's not fair." it's the only thing Cas says, his expression so sentimental. Dean almost looked away.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, looking at him from the bottom to the top, his expression stunned too.
Dean winced, his eyes glassy with emotions. Closing his green eyes shut, the taller man growled like an animal, and before Castiel knew it, Dean punched the wall.
Dean forced a smirk and winked at her, making her blush, she though, was brave and ran softly her fingers on his purple unzipped jacket.
Sam’s voice is quiet and nervous on the other line as he waits for Castiel to answer—and God he can feel the hurt in his shaky breaths, he imagines Sam’s happy and soft face being sad and devastated with watery hazel eyes.
, Cas. That feels amazing," Dean whined, hips twitching and jerking, barely held back.
Castiel froze when those eyes suddenly turned a golden-green shade, the red ring disappearing, fading away. There was something really familiar in those eyes, something he couldn’t explain.
Dean swore when Castiel stretched his lips around the head of Dean's cock and sucked. His hand landed in Castiel's hair, but it didn't guide or pull or urge, it just sat, a steadying weight against his head.
The green-eyed man choked on his drink just in time as Sam sat next to him at the bar. His younger brother had a bright smile on his face, Dean frowned, why the fuck he's happy about?
But he only looked at Dean.
, his head hurt like hell,
"I-I just didn't want to bother you, I know he hurt you but Cas, he freaking loves you, can't shut up about you..."
He missed the taste of Dean so much, he sucked eagerly the bottom lip, making the Alpha speed his strokes on Castiel’s cock.
Cas avoided looking at him, blue eyes focusing on his bed like it was the most interesting thing ever.
“Uh…”
No. No. No. No, don't do that. You love Carmen.
Sam rolled his eyes, while he smirked at the girls earning blushes and giggles.
After some more minutes, Dean breaks the comfortable silence.
"Wow..."
Dean chuckled and patted her blonde hair "You're welcome sweetcheeks."
"Hello Dean." he greeted when Dean's eyes snapped up, and he broke into an eager smile.
"Don't act like you care." his best friend rolled his eyes.
Dean was coming
Before he could turn around and grab his car keys, Cas heard a noise coming from the bathroom. He froze
“You’re clearly can’t get over him…” he mumbled shoving his phone into his pockets.
Dean inhales a shaky breath.
The taller man's jaw is clenched as he continued, "I might made you believe that I didn't care, but I do, and it fucking hurts...I never felt like this before,
Dean growled as his eyes fell on the ugly mutant bastards in front of him, as they said, they were on time. The closest crossroad was half an hour-long, he ran exactly at the right speed to be 3 minutes earlier.
Castiel's mouth watered when his eyes fell on Dean's thick flesh. Trying to contain himself, he quickly undoes his own jeans and boxers and stumbles swiftly into Dean's waiting arms.
Then his chin was on top of Dean’s head, Cas tightened his grip around him bring him closer, melting into him.
Before he could fill another glass of expensive whiskey, the door knocks. Puzzled Dean frozes, it's past midnight, and he doesn't expect anyone.
Groaning a breathless moan at the touch, Castiel palmed Dean's half-hard uncut cock. The young king was very satisfied,
This place was also super gorgeous and he felt a freedom he didn't feel in LA, maybe it was that they were on another land, and didn't have every damn paparazzi or gossip site surrounding them.
And god, that stupid costume.
He may or may not had a nice wet dream about blue eyes and plush pink lips last night,
The blue-eyed man whined, this man fucked him so good pressing deep inside Cas with every thrust.
"I wanted to keep you
"You..."
And Dean was so in love with him, it hurt.
Dean was about to say something, Cas waited, starting to feel more relaxed, he gave him his adorable smile—that's what Balth was telling him anyways—Dean seemed like an amazing person.
Suddenly his heart
“I’m here sweetheart…” tears start rolling into his cheeks as Dean stares at him with a surprised frown drawn in his face.
Cas..." Dean growled between the licks.
See you next week with the final part.
Then it hit Cas. The poor animal ran away with all of its courage, to not be a foot rag. It had escaped for its life.
Dean nodded with a tight jaw.
"Thanks, Jo," Dean smiled at the waitress and she saluted him leaving them alone. Dean gestured towards the beer.
The blue-eyed man looked stunned,
Every time he kissed Michael, he imagined Dean’s lips. Every time Michael fucked him or made love with him, Cas felt Dean’s body on top of him, whispering sweet nothings.
blasted on the speakers and Dean felt adventurous as he eyed Cas who eyed him back now looking concerned.
“You did too…” Dean whispered.
Dean rubbed his cock head in Castiel's hole and they both swore in sync as Dean finally pushed past the ring of muscle and slide his way, inch by inch, into Cas' eager heat.
Bobby and Ellen proudly smiling at them and then...Mary and John Winchester.
Dean is a
Not that he and Cas minded, he suggested for them to get married in the roadhouse, and Cas had chuckled lovingly and said that he'll marry Dean anywhere. He knew it was true but still, he wanted to be something
"Mmm...
Thanks for reading, kudos and comments are appreciated! <3 (btw sorry for any grammar errors)
Dean can help himself but lean closer to the blue-eyed man, their noses almost touching. He can feel Cas’ body stiffen and breath hitching immediately.
Castiel grinned as he remembered his original plan, cooking for Dean and go to a nice picnic.
Seconds later he heard a loud sigh, Castiel turned around and gasped dreadfully as blood started pooling even more from the bigger creature.
Castiel was not ready to lose anyone
As he walked and stepped out the alley Castiel glanced towards the crowd of people/ Vampires outside Vamprator. The music was still blasting loudly and was heard for two blocks ahead of the club. Tilting his head he noticed a couple of two women making out next to the dumpster. It was a redhead woman who Castiel had seen before but couldn't remember where, she looked quite familiar. Before he could get a good look but also trying to be discreet however he could, the redhead stopped abruptly and hissed, sharp fangs appeared, and with a quick move, she sank them at the blonde girl's neck.
“Some drunk asshole ran over you, it was his fault, not yours…”
"Sam, I swear to
Damn,
Come on
“Of course we love each other, we’re fucking best friends!” he growled harshly, he now understood this couple costume joke.
Bobby was his mentor and he started his career as a lawyer with his help as the man he called father paid his tuition fees at Law Shcool.
The wolf was tired, Castiel gasped in dread when the other smaller wolf bitted, sinking its teeth on the Alpha’s leg.
“Cas, buddy calm down!” Sam blocked Castiel’s way as he wanted to go after his idiot of a boyfriend. He’ll probably cause more problems if he went alone, they could find him and rip him apart, Dean will kill him if that happens.
“Your point!” Dean mumbled already annoyed about all this. He was supposed to be drinking.
Castiel felt his heart melting, the hoping sensation he had earlier was now replaced with pure assurance.
"Why are you doing this?" He gritted angrily, his blood boiling, how dare she threatening him like that? Dean would never believe her.
filler chapter, sorry for not updating, I hope you enjoy this sexy and fluffy chapter though!
"I l-love you Cas, I
He crawled to lean by the stoned wall, melting at it as the strong pain in his head was getting more and more unpleasant. Sighing he closed his eyes, whoever captured him and/or his men, wanted something with him/them. Maybe a vengeance plan or a sacrifice ritual.  Here in Egyp, the folk was doing shit like that all the time.
" He shouts discordantly and people start cheering him, then he looks at Cas who was now a tomato.
"Why not? We haven't had sex in a cave before."
Dean’s cock was throbbing inside of him, his hands gripping him hard on the hips as he fucked Castiel harder, pulling out until the head of his cock caught onto the rim, and then pushing in, repeating that over and over again.
"We should head out too," Castiel said. Claire whined and started hitting Castiel softly on his hip,
So long story short,
Adjusting his eye vision, he growled frustrated when he realized he was chained up on his hands and legs, making it very difficult for him to move. The dark dudgeon was slightly lighting by a weak torch somewhere in the background. It was quiet, no guard outside the cell door.
Castiel’s heart melted, he gave Dean a small smile.
A moment later, the guests all stood up and clapped happily, this time Mary and John joined them and Cas felt so beautifully, his heart full with gratefulness and bliss. It was amazing how everybody accepted them and supported them.
"I love you, Castiel
…Alfie, he’s probably starving.
"I love you Dean, I would have done anything for you and Sam..."
Sam stopped at a chain locked the door, it was small, almost like a closet room or a storage room.
Then he heard the voice, he tried so much to hate. The voice of the person who got him in this situation,
His green eyes were dead, yet so alive, and made a gorgeous contrast at his pale skin. Dean was standing in front of him looking scary and gorgeous as a sin. Wearing a dark red--
Blushing, Castiel pulled away from the green-eyed man and stood up in fast moves, feeling cold envelop him as Dean's warm press of skin is already away.
"Good, now let's go, I'm starving..." the green-eyed man gestured him to get in the passenger's seat.
Kissing once again his hair, Castiel, feels Dean drift into sleep, as his breathing starts getting slow.
Dean is not
it might be the time and the day, Monday at 9 am had hardly any hustle and bustle.
"I was actually very nervous, I thought you were straight..." the green-eyed man replied, sounding honestly surprised and playful.
Dean gave him a deep look, like he was memorizing Castiel’s face. “I’m sorry…” he said softly, “Madam Pomfrey said that your back will be good in a few hours.”
"Dean, I need you..."
Dean though, didn’t even know who he was. Castiel was a quiet kid, smart and all but an invisible ghost—
Dean was about to blurt how he missed his blue-eyed angel and how broken he was without him, when he heard with his supernatural hearing Sam’s car.
Seconds later the door closed, and Dean was gone. Leaving Castiel once again
, Cas felt he could die if Dean didn't touch him anymore.
"I got you,
"Dean, these are incredible..."
They stay in comfortable silence, Dean rubbing his palm softly looking at him with adoring eyes and Castiel can’t help but blush, he knew Dean 3 years and he never failed to make him feel like a
, he was a mighty warrior, he had physical strength and mind mastery,
Dean was inside the huge golden bathtub, relaxing with thick biceps resting on the rim of it. Checking the bench where rich food of fruits, savory meets, and cheese sprawled being now messy and half-eaten.
"D-Dean your l-lip..." Castiel muffled concerned even though he couldn't stop himself from kissing Dean and tasting the metallic taste of blood.
However, he did his job
Dean reached out to fiddle with the mess of hair he had, "I feel what you feel...Our bond is fresh, we're emotionally connected, If anything happens to you--"
"Me too,
Dean sucked and licked until Cas was sloppy and loose then pressed his tongue past the rim, dipping it in as far as it could go. Cas made an unholy noise and broke Dean's hold.
Dean, his best friend for almost 15 years, the man he is in love with for almost 15 years is now getting married to a woman he knows only a year.
Glancing one last time the happiest looking snowman into his sad empty porch, the blue-eyed man headed inside towards his small cabin and walked over to the tiny kitchen.
"Cas?" Dean whispers still not believing it. His best friend could just walk in with the copy keys he gave him 3 years ago.
xx Al
“Sorry, man.” He grimaces a tight smile at Balthazar who looks at him pissed.
"What you want baby?"
"I'm really sorry," blue eyes said once again frowning.
Castiel gave him a small peck at the corner of his lips. Dean unwillingly almost chased the blue-eyed man's mouth.
"You were dying..." Dean said softly.
“Hey, where’s Gabriel and my brother?” Dean asked him.
They were in Charlie’s and Dot’s dorm, Cas was in theirs getting ready himself, Dot helping him too, apparently, the girls wanted to be a surprise, Cas’ probably Wonder Woman, he loved the movie so much he talked about it 2 months.
But Castiel, little Castiel would be pining forever for the biggest loss of his damn life.
“Cassy!” Castiel heard an excited high-pitched voice behind him.
The blue-eyed man braced himself and put it all on the line. "I wanna be with you Dean, you make me happy, please don't take it away from me... Do you want me?"
“Can we trust them?” Benny asked suspiciously glancing at Sam in the front seat, Sam looked at him, his jaw was tight. Bobby’s eyes were shining next to him in rage, the clear gold of the beta energy show.
"D-Dean-"
Dean froze for a second,
he felt so full, and
kudos and comments are always appreciated!
He was gonna kill her too, she wasn't supposed to do that.
When your daddy owns the company it doesn’t matter though.
completely unconsciously and since then they have been best friends.
Dean gave him a gorgeous smirk and got up, it only took seconds and Dean pulled his slacks quickly, his black briefs were stretched around his erect cock which was now so big that peeked out of the waistband. Cas' mouth watered.
Dean internally punched himself, this man had captured him and tortured him
Castiel lays on his stomach pushing his ass in the air for Dean. He heard the green-eyed man growl and seconds later his jeans and boxers were thrown somewhere in the room in supernatural speed.
"Be my boyfriend...be mine."
Nodding Castiel took one more breath, his heart almost ripping from his ribcage as the first introduction of the first track of the tracklist started to play, the band was already killing it.
Gasps and whispers were heard all around the hall, however, Cas ignored every single one as he started walking towards the aisle to stand in the middle.
When they fell on Dean's huge bed, Cas on top of him their lips met once again, he runs his hands all over Cas' gorgeous tan body, he settles on his perky ass, palming the flesh, having Cas moan in his mouth.
Before Cas could run for his life, humiliation flushing all over his face, he felt a strong hand grabbing his wrist and turning him around.
The thing that hurt the most however was a week before he left on tour Dean took him on a date and told him how much he loved him, how proud he was, and how he'll miss him. They talked very little on the phone as Cas was busy with rehearsals, and Dean was about to start filming for a new major picture motion but he knew they were okay.
He nodded wiping his tears quickly as he passed Bobby to greet Benny and Charlie.
“What’s wrong?” Dean gives him a surprised glance, eyes wide and breath coming out hard.
“I thought if I left you, you would be safe…”
Dean returned the small smile.
Dean got up, and their eyes met.
Castiel’s heart fell watching Dean stare at him with those puppy eyes and sad pout. He blamed himself for falling into Lisa’s trap.
Dean smirked and winked again, he bend down and then lied to the cool sand, legs spreading, one arm behind his head. Castiel whimpered when his husband wrapped a hand around him and stroked slowly and lazily.
His mouth fell open when he saw the sight in front of him clearly.
“Really?” Castiel could not believe it.
Or, he left cause he's afraid and feels betrayed by humankind. Cas couldn't blame the poor animal,
The loud crowd made his heart ache even more and his nervousness hit red, they were 20.000+ people out there, and Cas was drugged with so many Xanaxes and 3 energy drinks that made everything blurry. He could pass out any moment.
He could throw his diner? That would be a distraction?
"Take me to bed."
"Not when I'm done with you..."
The man opened the cell, Dean watched him carefully, he could use a quick move and take the weapon this son of a bitch had secured on his belt. But his damn hands and legs were chained, he would work with useless hands but his feet were a high need for this.
“Maybe…”
He hoped the Barbar was big
And Castiel? All he did was to ruin the one thing that made him feel happy and loved.
like he meant everything to him.
All this feels like it’s his fault. If his stupid ass didn’t leave Dean, they could work out this mess with the kid. So many nights of insomnia and tears could be saved if he wasn’t a fucking son of a bitch.
in this world." Castiel said, his vow making Dean fill with affection and excitement, his soon-to-be husband was wonderful. The blue-eyed man tightened his grip in his hand, eyes looking like oceans.
Plus, he's quite the celebrity here in Egypt,
You’re in love…
His best friend started babbling about some drama and the way he spent yesterday. Cas swallowed the lump in his throat as he tried to sound normal and not like a choked stuttery mess.
Dean grabs his jacket from the chair it was hanging and slides it into his shoulder.
Not the image he expected for a CEO.
Holding each other tight, they continued fucking, hot and slow, Castiel riding the hot thick flesh moaning hard into Dean's open mouth who started stroking his own cock fast and messy. He wouldn't last long, especially while Dean jacked him so sloppily amazing.
Castiel chuckled, his cheeks warming and his heart melting at how dorky and passionate Dean's words for his car are. He looked adorable, and he reminded him so much of his son, Ben.
"You come here often?" Castiel took the beer gratefully and sipped some, "This place is nice," he comments then, still looking around.
Castiel frowned, his beautiful sharp features looking hard in the dark trembling light.
Spreading the green-eyed man's legs, he settled between them and then traced his index finger on Dean's warm and toned stomach before stopping on his big bulge. Castiel's mouth watered and he heard Dean groaning and his breath hitching at every little touch.
Feeling Dean's large palms cupping his ass, he moans and then whispers:
"Cas," Dean whimpered, and that's all Castiel needed to hear.
“Hey, what happened with the beer—”
time. You gonna stay right
Cas chuckled, "You better take me where everything began..."
why they looked
“Sam and Jess are waiting for us…” like Charlie knew what he was thinking she grabbed her girlfriend and started walking a couple of steps forward, him and Cas being left out in the back.
Evidently, Dean's team located the phone and froze it so the person didn't hack it, or used it to pretend he was him.
, I'll give you a blowie-" Cas shushed him flustered bringing his fingers to Dean's lips, he blushed for the 100th time tonight but smiled softly and leaned towards him, giving him a small peck on the cheek. Suddenly they were alone and the crowd was minding it's own business now, their friends heading to the bar too.
Castiel heard some voices from the speaker, a loud distant sob making its way into his ear and then Sam's annoyed curses. The blue-eyed man froze when he heard Sam exclaiming frustrated a '
Castiel suddenly felt hurt,
, he loved him so much, no one will
When Dean recognized that deep and so familiar voice he stopped and pulled away from Anna.
Spraying some cologne his sister Anna had brought him for his birthday, he fixed his dark shirt and went to his drawer to search for some jeans. Grabbing a dark blue pair, he puts them on, and then he slipped in his good leather boots.
Castiel was stunned, those dark shiny red rings were breathtaking—but Dean’s natural green was so much prettier.
After pushing two and then three slick fingers, Cas was a whimpering mess, he tugged Dean into a kiss, cupping the back of his head, then dropped his fingers to his neck, scratching the short hairs.
A strange feeling was pulling him to get closer to the wolf.
"I'm Dean, Charlie told me a lot about you..."
A wave of relief flooded on his spine, there goes that…
“I-I love you…” Castiel whispered before taking Dean’s hand, kissing the rough knuckles and lying his head down to his side, closing his eyes and hearing his soft breathing and the monitor’s beeping.
Cas sucked in a breath, bringing his hand to run along the edge of Dean's back.
Warm lips pressed on his shutting him off. Shock and a beautiful sensation encircled his whole body as arms were wrapping around his waist pulling him close. Cas' body relaxed immediately and melted on Dean. Grabbing his collar Cas kissed him back.
No, his not capable. Dean Winchester cannot feel anything.
He’ll probably be calling Kevin, Benny, and Charlie to help him erase the footage and take care of the body and Cas’ car.
"You said you love burgers, Ellen makes the best..."
Sam is in the chair next to the bed, he removes his palms off his face to look at Castiel, his hair falling messy in his eyes, that are red and tired.
The trap was, their teeth were poisonous, a bite inside his clean Alpha flesh will weaken him so much he’ll pass out in minutes.
Castiel
So, Castiel should end things, for his own sake. Dean can find somebody else, he sure as hell could with a face like his and God, don’t even let Castiel start about how magical and heavenly this son of bitch is in
He heard Dean chuckling.
, his eyes blissful and sparkling in the low light of the room.
“Dean…” Sam touched gently his shoulder; his brother’s voice filled with worry. Dean knew what the younger wolf was thinking.
Dean actually kissed him?
day when a drunk bastard came from nowhere and hit them.
It's not like he was invisible.
Dean yells, words coming slurred. They both flinch.
“What are they?”
He won’t lose him again
his jaw clenched and he was still stark naked for
Cas could feel his whole body shaking as he stared at Dean's back, he seemed tense and nervous, Carmen, on the other hand, was smiling and looked like a pageant queen, behind her, her bridesmaids were wearing gowns shaped like a pastry.
Dean shifted and took hold of Cas' face with both hands, "I was hoping to bring you home with me, you could meet my brother and stepdad, my friends too! But obviously, you can't just leave your home, your life... and I understand if you--"
He quickly takes Dean’s boots out off his feet and then pushes himself closer between Dean’s legs, he takes off the belt and then with quick motions undoes his zipper.
"How dare you, all this time you didn't care, but now you act like you do, even behind my back... You thought I didn't realize what was going on?" Cas exclaims, his deep voice full with emotion.
“That’s Jack, Dean found him 3 months ago, his parents are dead, Asmodeus killed them,” Charlie said bitterly, her eyes following his own.
Letting out a foggy breath, the blue-eyed man decided to head inside the cabin. Maybe the wolf isn't far away, he could catch him with his truck and take proper care of the wounded animal.
"Damn baby, you smell so much lust...
’ he hissed, showing his sharp teeth.
“You’re unbelievable!” she stated glaring at him.
He left Castiel to go and played it off like he didn't care at all, even though he's in love with him since that night 7 years ago when he met him and it fucking kills him, THE Castiel, the snarky and clever cute secretary (or what Cas likes to remind him to call his position
It was a few gentle drives forward before Cas'body opened fully to welcome him in, but when Dean felt those muscles relax around him, he set a pace that had them both moaning and gasping.
Dean was solid and warm against Cas' chest. His arms held him tightly, wrapped around his waist, one hand spread over his lower back.
..." Dean took Cas' bottom tips of his henley and lifted it to expose gorgeous tan skin. Cas copied him starting to unbutton every button in a quick movement. When his hands were on Dean's belt, he realized the way his dick was rock hard.
Castiel grabbed some cotton towels from his king-sized bed and then walked again towards Dean's wet calm body.
The wolf didn't respond.
Dean also was extremely handsome with forest green eyes and beautiful gold freckles all over his face, broad shoulders, and a charming smile that made every girl and guy have heart-eyes.
Before they could even touch their lips together, Cas' phone started ringing. Even being in the middle of the woods, the signal was good, which made Cas' friends call him daily.
Castiel froze, his books falling to the ground. He cursed a small '
"Maybe, but I'm dead serious, if I see you on my wedding tomorrow, you'll regret it."
…” Dean said, voice soft and hoarse, Castiel felt the tears burning his eyes.
This was the thing Castiel wanted the most. Having Dean.
"Come on, let's get you cleaned up..." he said quietly avoiding Dean's intense stare.
, I didn't text him
It was Sammy's turn to frown, he made that bitch face he always did at Dean and leaned closer to him.
Castiel almost collapsed, he took a shaky breath and nodded, he stood strong and took place on the lift that would elevate him to one of the biggest stage arenas of the UK.
Cas rushed like a psycho to his dresser to grab his phone.
Then it hits Castiel, his phone! Maybe Gabe left him a message, his little brother always updates him for his visits. The only problem is he wasn’t supposed to be in Kansas at least until the next weekend.
"Hello, Barbar..." he heard a voice behind him, the sound of it was deep and rich. Turning around Dean's eyes fell on top of a young man. The long aisle was decorated in a deep blue and gold carpet, clay vessels with hieroglyphics, and designs in bronze and sun colors were displayed on each side of the throne. The fire that got out of them was bright and it viewed almost colorful.
Castiel felt that this was the end, little more and he'll die.
He had met a handsome and very sexy vampire, Dean Winchester, also the owner of the club 'Vamprator'. He was dreamy yet cold and scary. Always sitting on his large throne and having women and men around him, feeding on them or having them dance sensually for him. Castiel jerked off a lot at the thought of Dean bending him and fucking him brutally as he drank his blood at the same time.
"Wow...t-this i-is wonderful!" he exclaims faking once again a happy smile.
Castiel felt hot tears streaming down his cheeks as Carmen said her own vows.
. Everything’s going to be
Castiel looked at Dean with wide eyes.
“Charlie you fucking little shi—”
Cas choked with his own split, heart blasting inside his chest, how the hell does she know that? He starts to shake a bit.
His heartbeat quickened, was someone inside the cabin?
. He stretches groaning even more, (it feels like his head will explode), and gets up from his tear-wet pillow, Cas sniffs as he remembered how he emptied everything with alcohol he had to forget about those green eyes.
He loves the red-head so much for doing that.
And God, his voice?
Regretting coming here from Rome, Dean spat some swears hating this position, being captured and helpless. He Dean of the Winchester leader of the Franks, barbarian, and one of the most dangerous men in the world was dying from a headache and was unknowingly somewhere the sun didn't even shine.
...make me wanna feel things, I can't stand it when you're not with me...For the past one and half months,
Cas blushed, he probably sounded like a pervert. Dean, then smiled, it was a gorgeous smile and a soft one at the same time.
The sigh was too erotic. Maybe Castiel found his forever sex toy.
Ignoring the hammering pain in his haid Cas takes off his dirty, alcohol smelly clothes and wears what he finds in front of him, after brushing fastly his teeth and slipping into his shoes, Cas rushes to the door, grabbing his trenchcoat he runs like a crazy person that escaped from the asylum.
to see you..."
But Dean only stared at Cas who was now looking adorable as ever with his wide blue eyes and parted lips, his cheeks still red as hell.
with Dean Winchester, he made him feel like nobody else.
“Benny, we have a problem…” Dean says seriously, eyes traveling to Castiel.
“What?”
, yet messy.
xx Al.
Suddenly Castiel saw the face he so much loved, his handsome features now hard as he bend down to Castiel, his big palms hugging his face.
Then he
God, he missed him so much, but so many questions.
"I love you so much...Have I told you that already?" Dean's voice was soft and playful as he ran his fingers through his hair.
"Make love to me..."
"Hey, Cas?" he started, his heart was beating faster than before and his palms got sweaty but he ignored it.
time he and Dean went for diner dates.
Sam, brought Bobby on purpose. He was so pranking him later.
"Hello, Manchester! Thank you for having me!" he shouted through his mic with a fake excited smile, Castiel was emotionally dead tonight. But people,
"Daddy, you make the best sandwiches in the whole world!" Ben exclaimed happily grinning with a mouthful. Dean's heart melted and he wiped with his thumb Ben's messy mouth.
Dean sighed and finally looked at his secretary, "What?"
Poor Sam, the teenager sounded scared, Dean is the only one he has, and being like this is an understatement. The blue-eyed man shut his eyes, Sammy needed help, he couldn't leave him like that...
"Oh god." Dean's hands came up to spread across Castiel's face. "Of course I do, you son of a bitch!"
Cas froze, his lips curling into a gorgeous small smile, he moved closer to Dean placing his other hand on the Alpha’s thigh.
Mr. Winchester was staring, his eyes were dark and lustful. His sandy hair looking like gold in the roof lights, as well as his thick beard, making him look dreamy and so,
Dean chuckled, as both of them started walking beside each other towards the elevator, "He sounds like a dick."
Dean rested his forehead against Cas'. Their noses pressed together, his lips brushed Cas' as he spoke. "you're so perfect,
Castiel mumbled feeling the Alphas hot mouth.
Breath
Healing can come faster than it supposed to. Life worked in strange ways.
Dean’s eyes were on his in a moment, he looked concerned, Castiel assured him he was fine nodding his head.
Seconds later Dean sat on the bed, fully dressed, his eyes met once again those blue orbs he so much missed. Cas had dark shadows under his eyes and looked thinner than the Alpha remembered.
After a tense moment where Cas wasn't sure if the wolf was going to try and stand or not, he finally slumped back down on the rags with a plaintive whine, sounding far too much like a dog. Cas stroked it lovingly once, pleased that it didn't react, then peeled his fur aside to examine the wound.
Glancing away Castiel decided to look away and give privacy to the couple.
Here's the second part, hope you liked it! Part 3 coming next week.
He couldn’t be jealous, Anna was his cousin for fucks sake!
“Like what you see?” he asked getting into a flirty player mood as he rested his hands on her hips.
Okay,
Castiel swore he, himself growled, grabbing Dean’s face and guiding his lips to Dean’s. Pressing their mouths together in a hungry passionate kiss.
Charlie got closer to him, pulling him to sit on Dean’s bed next to her. Castiel felt his eyes water, but once again he didn’t leave the tears to fall.
A black wolf was now standing outside his car, growling hungrily, teeth sharp, its gold eyes almost black. Castiel was about to
Dean's hands clenched on his cheeks as he worked his mouth down Dean's cock, slicking his skin with his wet tongue. Castiel rocked back and forth, taking another inch with every swallow until his nose touched Dean's balls, his cock stretching his throat.
It was the second time. With Michael.
The world spun, and Castiel let out a huff when his hands traveled on Dean's chest.
His mind screaming
“Dean…”
“But you—”
Charlie sighed, still looking at him with pity, it was like she knew something. Castiel’s eyes widened.
OMG, finally finished it! Sorry  it took almost a month to upload, I was on vacation and the internet connection was shit where I was. Here's the last chapter, the happy ending ma boys deserve. Hope you enjoy.
When the door slammed, Castiel winced once again, poor Mike, he always cared about him, tried his best and was a safe choice. But the blue-eyed man didn’t feel a thing. It was too forced.
"Oh shit, baby, you feel so damn good but if you don't stop I'm gonna come," Dean said in a rough whisper.
“What about the body? Sam, there are cameras everywhere, they have Dean turning to human…”
, you probably think I'm boring..." Castiel flushed as he remembered he said exactly the same things when they were in the park.
, Dean's silky grey shirt was stretching around his toned chest and broad shoulders, Cas gulped.
grade, that soft smile and that head tilt every time he didn’t understand a pop reference.
"How are you handsome?" Dean asked, his arm still around his shoulders, his smile shifting into a cheeky smirk.
"Castiel do me a favor and get Ms. Barnes on the phone please..." he said only glancing at him for a second before walking inside his office. It took everything not to snap on Cas as he probably was texting that sonovabitch he went out yesterday.
"You're mine
"Look, D-Dean, are you lost? Do you need help to get to town?"
The blue-eyed man started to set a rhythm, bobbing down, sucking hard, then sliding back up again until his nose was buried in Dean's golden brown curls.
"Dean...I don't know how to start, because I'm afraid it might be the end of our good relationship or, if I'm lucky, it could be the realization of my dreams, which is for you to love me as
Castiel gulped, his heart falling into his stomach. Charlie, who was next to him probably felt his panicky mood—
Blaming everyone expect himself is low even for him. This mess is
He missed Dean’s touch, his lips, generally the existence of Dean freaking Winchester.
The creature opens the door, hissing and growling angrily, its nails long scratching his leather seats.
help!” Bobby was furious as he and Sam grabbed him from the shoulders to carry him to the truck.
Charlie gave him a sympathetic look when they heard the voicemail on speaker, the accountant blamed himself for not checking his phone earlier.
Cas sighed and pushed the painful memories in the back of his mind.
Words couldn't describe how happy and blissful he felt, the man he loved was going to be his,
He broke up with Dean, that night was the worst night of his life because of a fucking lie and a grown-up woman who wanted to involve one of the best humans alive to a baby scam?
Cas left with him as he was also one of the reasons that convinced Dean to exit. Both not being colleagues anymore they broke their rule and slept together, it was one of the best nights in Dean's life.
Dean felt anger boiling inside his body, not anger at Charlie but at himself who was so obvious with his feelings. That’s why Cas was awkward around him, maybe he noticed.
He was so frustrated, how everything went downhill in just 24 hours? He was supposed to be in his apartment doing nothing, and then go to work on Monday—which now that he thinks of doesn’t really matter, he hated the place.
"Everything for you baby..." Dean licked his lips and then crushed his lips with a dirty kiss which had Cas seeing stars.
.." Dean moans.
The green-eyed lawyer gave him a last long closed-mouthed kiss, so heated it felt like holy fire before pushing his best friend on the other side of the bed and taking the lead on top, crawling all over his body, they hiss as Cas' and his cock brushes together.
After throwing the paper wrap of his gluten-free bagel, Dean fixed his tie and entered the Law firm.
Castiel blinked at him, his heart dropping for the 100th time tonight.
They can be different kinds of wolfs. The black one was human initially though.
Dean stopped in his trucks; broad shoulders stiff as he slightly turned his head to the side.
If something happens, Castiel will never forgive himself.
while I figure out what the hell is going on..."
“What are you doing? —
“Let’s just go home…”
"A fucking bitch, that's what he is!"
beat, he woke up and felt like shit. It was supposed to be one of the best days of his life. It didn't feel like that at all. He was literally sick from the nerves.
“Hey guys!” he heard Dot behind him, Dean turned to greet them, but before he could do so, his breath hitched.
…” Dean groaned from pain as he hit the cold leather seats, Bobby rolled his eyes, throwing the fallen trench coat to him to cover his junk.
Dean got up and pulled him with him, Castiel squicked but then giggled when Dean grabbed his hand and started running towards the blue sea water. Their toes almost burning at the hot sand.
Cas almost gasped,
Castiel laughed feeling his panicky mode disappearing a bit. He hugged Benny as the other man patted his back softly. Wait, if he’s here that means—.
Grinding himself at the same time as he stroked Dean's cock, Castiel felt generous and nuzzled his nose into Dean's bearded cheek, kissing soft pecks,
.” He said grinning stunned. Sam snorted trying to hide a smile. Castiel blinked for a few seconds, eyebrows furrowing into a frown.
But it was a risk he was willing on taking, Cas was a father too, so he could understand him more. And wouldn't decline--expect if he didn't want to go out with Dean for other reasons than him being a dad--so Dean felt brave.
he just had the nerve to introduce his older brother to Castiel, and then it was
“Room 404, he just got out the ER, he’s stable.” The nurse confirms and gives him a small polite smile.
His dreams with Dean.
Dean laced their fingers tightly, his voice muffled in Castiel’s neck.
Castiel’s face pales and his heart drops as he hears the stranger's voice.
!" the blue-eyed man parted his legs more, when he teased a lubed finger on his balls. Dean smiled softly and gave him a peck, he then chuckled when Cas wrapped his arms and legs around his body pulling him impossibly closer.
, which, he and Mick visited quite a lot as a guilty pleasure. The blue-eyed cook wasn't proud of himself but wasn't ashamed, vampires were quite the adventure but he wasn't obsessed with them like the fang groupies.
“Maybe…Did it work?” Castiel said breathlessly, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck as he grinded slowly his crotch to his.
child.
Castiel ignored it, too busy and focused on his drawing. If it's important they'll call.
“How the bloody hell that even happened?” Gabe exclaimed. “Weren’t they supposed to be hitting the players?”
When the wild animal drifted into a more heavy sleep, He covered him with the woolen blanket, Cas checked on the wolf throughout the day, sitting nearby with his tea and offering him water and food whenever his eyes blinked open.
The beautiful green-eyed creature radiated a calm aura and Castiel felt the urge to offer a hand to sniff to the wolf. Realizing it’s not a dog he jerked his arm off.
“Me too.”
. He doesn’t care how he and Balthazar keep laughing and groping each other.
"It's me...the wolf..." Dean admitted like it was so logical.
Dean freezes and pulls a bit from his lips.
“Like I already told you, I ended it…” he kissed Castiel’s shoulder blade.
Anna and Gabe were
“I got you Cas…”
Castiel froze, heart stopping for a second. All his happy vibe from earlier dying right away. He feels his throat drying incredibly quickly.
Castiel wiped a tear with his thumb and continued to look at Dean. He opened his mouth, lips slightly trembling.
Castiel let out a sigh burying his face into his palms. Here goes nothing,
After spreading out a stack of rags and an old woolen blanket, he eased the whimpering wolf off his arms and onto the warm nest, managing to flip it over on its other side so his injury was visible.
"Please, Dean...I need you inside of me...
“No! I just can feel that he’s left the bunker, his scent isn’t here…”
They stumble into Castiel’s own room at the frat house, hungrily kissing, mouths licking at each other, tongues dancing together.
"Like what you see Cas?" Dean asked grinning smugly. Castiel rolled his eyes and pulled his blue t-shirt in quick moves. Not as sexy as Dean but
..." Cas tugged gently his fingers at Dean's hair. Dean thrust his fingers in a few more times, and looked satisfied, he crawled up over Cas' body and claimed his mouth in a filthy kiss.
. His conciseness shouts to him.
Castiel will count to that.
The green-eyed man knew he looked like a chick magnet with Ben but damn, he hadn't got laid in a long time, someway it didn't really bother him, he wanted to focus on his boy and his job, so it appeared really not important at the moment, but thinking about it now, he really missed physical contact.
Throwing his jacket on the leather couch, Dean unbuttons the first buttons of his white shirt and unwraps his tie. He should probably take a shower, then jerk off and finally doze off trying not to think about his best friend of 7 years.
Dean stops in his tracks, his eyes widening in shock as he takes Cas in. The taller man was in a dirty pair of jeans and a tank top. His handsome face was pale, freckles contrasting in his usually tanned skin.
This though was not normal. Wolves weren’t this large and definitely hadn’t glowed red or golden eyes.
Castiel felt his heart flush, tears threatening to fall, he’s Dean’s mate…
“You fucking love Cas, he fucking loves you!”
“Holy shit.” He moaned and heard Dean breathing heavily, hand coming to fist Castiel’s dark hair.
Okay,
he couldn’t hold them anymore, they’re at least 15 poisonous ugly mutts.
Seconds later it was on top of him, throwing itself to him, Castiel grabbed the neck, pushing it away from his face with all his strength as the animal tried to rip him apart with its sharp teeth.
“Please take me to a room and fuck me…with this costume on.” Cas said breathlessly pressing his erection to Dean’s and the green-eyed man thought he was in heaven.
Castiel wanted to throw it, but he just couldn't move.
Castiel almost purred at the praise.
He knows Dean didn’t agree, he said it wouldn’t affect their future and their relationship but Castiel couldn’t do it, he just couldn’t…
“What plan?”
. Even though it hurt, no one could make him feel like the green-eyed lad. He tried to move on, date after their fuck sessions ended, he needed to take his mind off Dean.
Why he suddenly felt rage and jealousy towards Cas? Why looking at him with someone else made his blood boil? What is wrong with him?
Checking himself for any traces of fight or bloody scars, he found nothing on his bare chest, not even his bronze chain that he had since he was a kid, gifted by his mother. His Tribe's oily green color rune tattoos were still painted on his rough skin, his bulky figure unharmed. Evidently, he was missing his weapons (obviously) and his wolf skin overcoat, leaving him with just only wool kilt garments and his leather boots.
So, the problem was, he and Dean weren’t a couple, as much as Castiel
Dean untangles their laced fingers and once again and tries to sit up on the bed, wincing once again from the pain.
He slipped from the couch and crawled towards Dean's bow legs, Dean's eyes were so dark and lustful following every move Castiel made. When he was kneeling in front of the green-eyed man he licked his lips and dared to glance at Dean who was suddenly breathing harder.
again.
“Please…Do you want to be
He groaned as he threw his laptop bag on the sofa. Alfie suddenly showed up from his bedroom meowing happily, sliding into his human’s legs purring.
Trying not to be scared so the wolf won’t smell it, Castiel smiled to the animal, forcing himself not to grimace. After all, he started to feel kind of safe.
The blue-eyed man tilts his head to the side confusingly and some red decorates his cheeks as his eyes widen.
“That night…” Dean started; throat tight with emotion, “You didn’t do anything wrong; don’t you ever blame yourself—I—I’m sorry for making you believe that…”
Jack, noticed that they were looking at him and waved sheepishly, his cheeks red.
"Be a good girl," he calls to the empty(well except his dog) apartment even though he's pretty sure Hazel is still asleep, Castiel took her on a long walk to tire her and not to have to take her out later.
"Dean, you are the culmination of a dream come true...I can't believe I'm standing here about to start a wonderful life together with my best friend...
After he and Alfie ate, Castiel took his clothes off and threw them into his laundry basket. Feeling sweaty and dirty he stepped on the shower and closed his eyes slightly as the hot water fell on him.
Sam:26
you remembered about your little brother..."
“Hey, Dean-o,”
.." Castiel leaned closer, his hand sliding a little lower once again.
Sometimes he couldn't help but look at Dean and steal some glances when they went out with their mutual friends (he avoided going out with the couple alone.)
He hopes Sam and those hunters come fast, they may be dumb, but they’ll know if Dean procrastinates them.
. Think that Dean is happy with Lisa who seemed nice and is very pretty, and flexible, oh, and a cheerleader.
"Fuck..." Dean managed to gasp.
"Why did glamour me? Why did you make me forget you..." his voice broke, everybody left him.
The Alpha stopped abruptly when a very familiar scent circled his nose, the aura of his mate catching him off guard. The wolf turned his snout to the side, red shining eyes falling on no one, but his mate.
"I'm sorry, man, I-I uh--nevermind...sorry for making you--"
"Yeah, sure." He started to panic, he didn't dance, he might have fooled around with Balth at some stupid pop songs at parties but he didn't know how to dance to the songs that played here.
Dean froze a bit,
Dean panted softly as he moved them a little close to his nightstand, Castiel hummed softly into the older man's nape, lips dragging slowly on the heated skin.
Someone already had that dessert last night.
Dean’s heart
"Do you love me?"
Castiel looked the come stains in his stomach and sighed dramatically, he could join Dean in the shower, but he knows they won’t do the
“No, no,
breathed and pulled Cas impossibly closer. He buried his face in the blue-eyed man's hair and breathed in deeply.
"Whatever, he looked busy anyway..." Cas said, trying to hide his disappointed look as he faked a smile.
" Dean closed his eyes as he imagined Cas and only Cas. Putting his hand on his chest he started dancing.
Castiel sipped a bit vodka, gaze still at Dean as the brunet girl wrapped her arms around him and playfully rolled her hips seductively on him.
"Good..." Dean growled, "you're
“Cas I—”
“He took everything so calmly; I can’t believe how cool he is with all this.”
Dean collapsed, sweaty and come-covered on Cas' side still panting hard. Cas was breathless too. They stayed for some minutes looking at the ceiling. Cas suddenly felt his cheeks burn, Dean probably wanted to sleep or relax. Castiel was probably another one-night stand.
Cas placed softly and hesitantly his palms on Dean's stern, afraid Dean will suddenly pull away, but when he felt Dean's hands leaving his waist and closing on his own, the blue-eyed man licked into his mouth sweetly, trying to contain a soft moan.
Seconds later he’s on the car, starting the engine and pulling into the road, revving fast in the dark streets of Lawrence. He can feel his phone vibrating with texts, it makes him anxious and ready to lose control and scream, the cold sweat on his hands make him grab the steering wheel harder.
Castiel gives Benny and Charlie a last glance before he knocks the half-closed door quietly, his heart threatening to rip off his chest.
—with the sharp teeth and gold eyes, growling angrily at him. It was deformed and blood was running all over its chin.
Images of blue eyes, chapped lips, and messy dark hair circle into his mind.
, for Cas he'll do anything.
Edit by me, follow me on tumblr @blackwingsofcas
The shittiest thing was that he convinced himself that it'll be okay, he'll forget about
now. You better forget him, like forget the living life you someday had.
Gabriel will be thrilled to see the tall lad again.
"Yeah, yours..."
The man's eyes fluttered open for a tense second before he looked insulted. "I'm not nuts, Cas..."
“Okay, almost done…” Charlie said as she applied one more layer of white makeup paint on his chest, Dean sighed with relief, he’s sitting there for almost 2 hours, he was so regretting choosing to be Joker for Halloween.
“I have a lot to explain… and I will, please call Sammy…” Dean choked from pain, those sons of bitches bite him good, even though he would heal fast enough, he needed to go to the bunker for some painkillers.
he needed Dean so much.
When they went down, Dean’s make-up was already itching and when he tried to touch his face Charlie hit him, glaring daggers at him.
Grabbing the mic Dean starts singing blurry, losing some words, and trying to stay upright.
Dean growled and pushed Cas onto the leather couch which was just a few feet away from the door. Seconds passed and Dean was already half-naked, Cas licked his lips at the toned and tanned chest in front of him, Dean had a flaming pentacle tattoo on his left pec. It looked so sexy. It was amazing how Dean with suit looked like an elegant gorgeous CEO but without it like an Arlekin book cover of a sexy lumberjack love story.
." Dean choked without shame.
Cas gave all his courage to avoid Dean and Carmen, something about a month ago it was easier as they had preparations for the wedding, it hurt, so much to be a witness to all of this nightmare and fake his happiness for his best friend when on the inside he wanted to yell at him and tell him what a big mistake he did.
“I swear if they hurt you, I’ll—" Benny growled as his mind probably showed him images of those bastards. Poor guy was right to be angry, their kind killed his loved one.
Castiel’s dick reacts immediately.
“What about Lisa?” Castiel asked uncertainly, suddenly remembering about her.
part 2 is here!!! If you loved this fluffy smut, you know the deal.
Cas then gulped, as his eyes trailed down to Dean’s naked toned stomach.
As he ignored the still uncovered down region of the green-eyed man.
They were at church for literal
"Dean! Cherrypie!"
Castiel gulped.
The blue-eyed man stills when he sees the anonymous caller ID. No one has ever called him anonymously, his heart starting beat a bit faster.
"Fuck..." Dean growled as he licked stripes between his ass cheeks, Castiel hummed happily continuing sucking Dean's cock hard, hollowing his cheeks and leaking the length from the top to the bottom.
“I can’t believe you held a gun, you’re like a virgin in danger…guess you already lost it today.” His brother didn’t look shocked at all and Castiel couldn’t believe how quickly he accepted everything. The blue-eyed man rolled his eyes, before closing the car door.
, his consciousness screamed at him painfully.
He tried to ignore his lower half which was quite liberated from any undergarments except the satin tunic. He felt bare and weak without his weapons and animal overcoats. He almost looked like a...
He silently thanked his mother, shutting his eyes, Castiel didn’t feel his body. Everything hurt and—oh god,
Dean was stunned, but quickly shook his head and tried to focus his anger on that son of a bitch.
“They’ll give him back if I met them…”
He really should grab something to defend himself--he indeed had his grandfather's hunting rifle--i
“I got you baby…”
"Awesome, tell him, his uncle misses him, I'll try to visit as soon as possible, anyway, how are you? How's the auto shop?"
The much taller lad melted into Cas tiredly. The older man patted his back comfortingly before pulling away, hand still on Sam's shoulder.
"H-Hello Dean." He blurted, cheeks suddenly warming and his whole world stopping. Dean looked even hotter now, and god so, so handsome. Soft freckles dusting on his cheeks and those plush cupid bow lips.
"Are you afraid?" Dean asked thoughtfully, and Castiel could tell Dean's puzzled but poker glance was searching his soul.
Castiel smiled at him as he saw the young wolf holding a book,
Cas stumbles down to the empty chair behind him, tears threaten to roll down his eyes.
Cas gulped.
Dean continued.
“Okay, so I dressed you guys like Harley and Joker…right?” the redhead asked.
Dean cringed at his own thoughts and sipped more beer.
, approaching the green-eyed man, Castiel traced the towel slowly onto Dean's chest, wiping the droplets from his toned pecs, which were covered in his Tribe's tattoos.
The green-eyed wolf he so much loved was now running towards the half-destroyed Toyota his little brother was.
Cas and Dean smiled the wildest at each other and Castiel grabbed Dean by the collar of his suit and pulled him incredibly close. Pressing their grinning lips they hummed happily, Dean sliding his hands in Castiel's waist to pull him even closer as possible. The kiss was soft and hungry and the most gorgeous. Dean's stomach was filled with the whole damn zoo. It felt like the first time.
Cas smiled sleepily, "I'd love to..."
Before he could search his blue-eyed angel—best friend! Charlie punched his shoulder.
Actually, it was all
"A little bit sweetheart..."
He said to himself.
Stop being
He and Dean had still so much to discuss but for now, Cas didn't feel alone, didn't felt like he'll ever be, the flutter in his chest confirmed that he
“How can I help you?”
Shaking his head, Castiel took a deep breath, he needed to think Sam, the younger man was practically family, like Dean was, even though they fucked, he cared for both of them like his people.
he shouted.
Castiel gave him a knowing look, almost playful, Dean raised his eyebrows confused and then it hit him, the Alpha rolled his eyes.
, he had some one night stands here and there but nothing more, all the guys wanted him for a quick fuck, well except one who was a little obsessed with him,
He got out slowly, careful not to make any sudden moves. Castiel was shaking, but the adrenaline was screaming to him to move closer.
Before she could throw them the fat candlestick she grabbed from the altar, a woman and a man who Cas understood were her parents, took the item, and pushed her away from the couple as she continued screaming slurs and curses all over the church.
So, he already had a crush on Cas, although the lad could be--or was probably straight and didn't look for a relationship, Dean himself was a ladies man but hot damn the dark-haired man awakened his 10% bisexuality which now equaled to 70% and it was all of Cas' fault.
Those green emerald eyes are looking at him back. He suppresses a sob as he lifts Dean’s hand and kisses knuckles, relieved and happy to hear that hot husky voice.
Don't forget to comment and give some kudos, (Well, If you want! hehe ^.^)
"Sam, what wrong?" he asked immediately, panic shivering all through his body.
“I took a DNA test, a fucking zero percent!” Dean’s hand suddenly was holding his chin, lifting his face up.
?" Dean's voice broke as his eyes filled with tears.
“She was clearly flirting with you, I got irritated,” Castiel admitted nuzzling more into Dean’s chest, the memory of that woman being thirsty for Dean still made him feel jealousy.
Cas' rim throbbed brutally with the length of Dean, rock hard and thick.
He felt Cas being behind him, his aura changed immediately from soft to awkward and sheepishness. Dean tilted his head so he could see Cas.  The smaller man looked red and then the Alpha remembered his dick was out, he was naked as hell.
"Well, I grew up here and I can say you gonna love the place, you and your wife will definitely fit in, people here are nice," Dean gave him a side smirk.
Before he knew, he felt Dean’s tongue on the nape of his neck, licking and sucking, whispering his name and how good he is. Dean wrapped his strong arms around his chest and seconds later he was coming.
“Yeah, but you can go!” Castiel raised his voice, his eyes swelled with tears, even then they didn’t roll down his eyes.
Moving once again closer, he finally noticed, that the wolf has been shot in the ribs, blood trailing over the white snow, turning it into pink.
, don’t you dare think like that…” Dean stopped them in the middle of the hallway. The Alpha grabbed his face by each side pulling him into his broad chest.
"Forever
Before he could say something, Claire and Ben hopped up and down and whined, "Can we play with Hazel?"
Dean hates himself and the way he feels.
But in the end, everything will be alright,
Castiel gulped but relaxed immediately when the other girl started moaning and pulling the redhead vampire more into her.
"You okay sweetheart?"
“Ah, f-fuck…” Castiel’s hands scramble desperately over Dean’s chest, pulling the tank top off his body.
"I heard you work—"
, but something odd was going on in this damn kingdom. Also, his men were still missing.
“I think you do. We all have eyes sweetie, you didn’t even listen to a word I told you, your eyes were glued to him and only him all night.”
"Well... yeah?" Dean's confidence was visibly flagging and horror was rippling through him in hot waves.
“Mmhmhm…” Dean mumbles between kisses, God, he missed the taste of him so badly, Dean's lips were dry but still so amazing ,the way he sucks his bottom lip and fuck—
Dean kissed him on the lips this time, furrowing one hand up through Cas' thick, dark hair and the other on his hip.
Dean turned and met hazel worried eyes. Sam was standing frozen; his frown was deep as he stared at his older brother. He had his backpack around his shoulders.
"Mmm..
Carmen was smiling tightly as she entered his apartment—without him inviting her. Castiel winced when she bypassed him hitting his shoulder.
"...you may
He literally groans touching Dean’s toned chest.
“Calm down,” he mouthed.
"Be careful Ben!"
, the way he rode Dean, the way the blue-eyed man sucked his cock...and don't even let him start about Cas' ass, his gorgeous pink tight hole who he ate like a champ.
"Stay..."
Dean sighed and smiled finishing wrapping some sandwiches, took some extra for Cas and Claire, and also two beers and two apple juices.
So that was it? Their last night?
. This was supposed to get his mind off his beautiful blue-eyed best friend.
Castiel was at a loss of words, Dean’s eyes were pleading.
"What the hell is wrong with him?" Dean demanded, his voice shaky.
“Uh, what happened?” he asked quietly, cheeks burning. Dean sat on the bed and threw another gorgeous smile at Castiel. He blushed harder.
Castiel’s eyes rolled from the pleasure.
the emperor nodded satisfied looking at Dean,
Then he
Hey, go out with me? Ew, he sounds like a player.
There was a long silence, he looked everywhere but the tall lad in front of him. Charlie hit his leg; he was about to protest when he realized Dean was looking at him.
Castiel wrapped a hand around the cock and sucked even faster and stroke what didn't fit, his spit running all over the angry red cock,
“You’re a wolf?” Castiel asks as he pulls away, shocked expression curling into his surprised face.
"You're
“I’m here, a-always.” He smiles teary at the old pet name, taking Dean’s hand with both arms kissing everywhere.
almost every person Dean introduced him when they were still dating is a freaking werewolf.
Castiel knew Dean was a good actor, he did have a Golden Globe, but did he really acted all those 3 years they were together as a married couple? And the 5 before when they were Hollywood's, young famous sweethearts?
!" he growled whining. Dean's cock hit him so well.
I was worth saving..." Dean took a deep breath in then turned his bright green eyes on him.
“Dot texted me, Cas is ready, and Sam and Jess will meet us at the party.” She said glancing her phone screen. Dean just nodded; he was so curious to see Cas. They haven’t seen or talked today at all; Dot got him in the morning to go pick their costume made costumes.
— Castiel got into his blue Toyota Prius exhausted and pissed, dropping his laptop bag and the cold take out dinner on the passenger’s seat, closing the car door after.
a male version.
"You bet..."
‘Let the boy go, you have me…” Dean spoke through his mind, he was getting impatient, as well these bastards, they already circled Dean, looking at him like a piece of pie.
A couple of seconds later Cas lifted his eyes and met Dean's handsome face, he was frowning but his eyes were soft.
Every bite was delicious, and their conversation was completely derailed by Castiel failing to hold back hums of pleasure with each new bite. As they ate, Dean made some jokes and told him stories about how once he had got so drunk he sang karaoke.
It happens in an instant, one moment he’s sitting there glaring at them, the other is when he stomps towards them.
Ellen sighed defeated and Bobby mumbled an angry
He was painfully attractive. Castiel's throat went dry.
Noticing him, some of them gripped the hard metal and growled at him. They acted like feral animals. That's exactly what he expected.
"I have a lot of enemies Cas, when we were together, Gordon, the vampire who almost killed you, wanted revenge, I killed him. But I needed to present to the Vampire Authority, It's a criminal offense to kill your own kind. I was punished... And I will do it again for you..."
" he whispered into Dean's ear, then rocked up and bounced down on the green-eyed man's cock again, setting a punishing pace.
Suddenly everything stops. He lifts his eyes to finally look at his blue-eyed angel. Cas' lips are parted from the surprise and his eyes looked glassier than ever.
Then Dean was a corporate attorney, he took Cas as his assistant(secretary) even though he wanted to fuck and worship the hell out of him, but the blue-eyed man made it perfectly clear that he didn't blend work with pleasure. Dean had to choose, have Cas for one night or have him every day working for him and being a spectacular secretary cause he sure was a damn spectacular secretary.
Dean immediately thrust his tongue into Cas’ mouth, he was so freaking happy and a bit confused but didn’t want to stop the kiss, he growled when Cas pushed him against the window and pulled him closer, Dean tightened his arms around his best friend’s waist.
Jo suddenly stepped forward.” It’s a trap, you can’t go!” she exclaimed.
Castiel took all the courage he had and unlocked the car door.
Dean's eyes widened when he heard the music of the 'Coming Bride' through the church's speakers.
, D-Dean..." Cas breathed out, his eyes drifting closed as the green-eyed man found his hole.
“I missed you little guy!” she pulled away, setting him to the ground, her hands still on his shoulders.
"I'm very sorry..." his eyes were wide as he looked at Dean, then his lips parted as he checked Dean from the bottom to the top, realizing he's starring too long, the dark-haired guy turned his attention to the dog.
"Oh, and Dean?" Cas started before leaving completely out of the office, he leaned towards the glass door, his cute frown still drawn in his features.
Dean’s expression softened, “I knew from the moment I laid my eyes on you…You’re my everything Cas…I can’t live without you.”
"Fuck,
"Wanna go somewhere private?" Cas asked then seductively, feeling adventurous, lips brushing Dean's ear, he felt the blonde man gripping his waist tighter. He really needed to feel those lips on his.
Dean shifted and got up quick enough for Castiel to not notice it.
"I love you,
Cas' heart melted at Dean's protectiveness, hope and love filled his chest as he gulped one last time... This was it,
With a last kiss, Dean's pulling away from him, the sudden warm sensation left him cold and he almost frowned.
The garage was exactly underground the company and private. Only employees were allowed.
"It'll heal, Cas..." Dean whispered sensually.
Generally, the place wasn't packed but it wasn't empty either, it was early though, especially for a bar, it will crowd later at what he could guess.
you know I'll give you what you need, babe," the blonde man assured him.
"So, Cas, tell me more about yourself..." Castiel snorted, taking a sip of his beer. It was cool and sweet it made him feel a little lightheaded.
, he wanted to say but he continued through his story. "I lived miserable almost all my life, they made me marry Amelia so I could have a perfect family as they did. She was a good person, but sex with her was so hard, I couldn't do this, not sure how Claire came out...But it happened, and she was the only thing that mattered. I said to myself that if I'll have Claire, everything will be okay..."Castiel struggles to go on, his stomach twisting in knots.
Dean left before he got more into the twisted strategies of Crowly. After all, he still had dignity and justice was a holy subject to Dean.
Dean felt humiliation run through his body.
"You love me, right?"
The wolf looked more relaxed almost instantly, his breathing settling out and his eyes shut. Cas sat on the stool and watched the wolf sleep.
They both smiled at each other softly before kissing again, this time slower. The applause and cheers once again erupted like crazy. Both best friends, now
Seconds later he feels Alfie curl on his legs and then Castiel is fast asleep.
Well, he thought, the trap couldn’t be more obvious, those stupid bitches are so dumb, the animal in their once wolf is now poisoned so they don’t have any human senses to control or even the to clear their mind.
“No.”
"I love you guys so much..." Cas said looking at them, bliss in his crystal eyes, he kissed Ben's cheek lovingly, then Claire's, and finally his lips met Dean's.
The blue-eyed man leaned in until his voice was the only thing that mattered. "You're going to be begging me to last when I start with you..."
The mutant omegas hiss in approval looking almost like they are smirking with yellow rotten teeth.
The last three months were hell, emotionally, and physically.
"Yet, there some things you don't know about me..." Cas softly cupped Dean's beardy cheek.
Cas reached up, brushing his fingers through Dean's sandy hair, then stopped at the back of his head to hold him close while their tongues danced and tangled, Dean opened his mouth, accepting Cas' curious tongue with so much hunger, he growled like an animal.
Either way, it was too late now. Dean will never forgive him if he misses the wedding, especially when he promised he'll be by Dean's side on the altar with Sam.
"That’s lovely," Castiel hummed and then darted forward and licked across Dean's panting mouth, which he closed immediately to kiss the king, Castiel then bent down and bit his earlobe.
Castiel was about to speak but seconds or not even seconds--
“In a
Dean feels his eyes water, he feels
anymore.
"Look at me, Cas..."
"You brought me here...Well, technically down the porch, but I felt like doing a quick shower...needed it."
“Hey, I left you some hot water if you want to take a shower.” Dean winked, smiling unbothered at Castiel.
, splitting him open.
Taking off his cell from the back pocket of his jeans Castiel chokes out a hiccup when he sees the caller.
, he looked adorable.
for not making you mine long ago..." The green-eyed man whispered pressing his lips on his temple.
Castiel gulped hypnotized.
Dean checked around before pulling Castiel to the hallway, the place was in a good mood, everybody celebrating, beers in hand, Dean’s pack knew it wasn’t over but for now, everything was alright.
"Mmm...please..." he choked as he was loving the sensation, Castiel pecked Dean's jaw hungrily while Dean continued his massage on his balls, it didn't take long before those fingers grazed on his hole.
Castiel moaned as Dean started fucking him faster and harder, hitting his prostate incredibly good.
He would have hated If the same would happen to him.
Castiel’s 32 years old for fuck's sake! And he’ll never say a proper goodbye to his siblings.
“Can you get me a beer?” he asked and leaned close to Dean so he can hear him.
Cas stared stunned and then dropped his eyes to the floor. "I-uh...Do you mean... a date?"
After some hunters put the mutt bodies in a bunch, the set it on fire, Castiel felt a satisfaction, those creatures are down, they will never hurt anyone now.
He starts to lazily make out with Anna, she moans here and there, Dean doesn’t feel anything though. He just hopes she doesn’t read anything wrong about this.
“Good, now go to the car with Dean and Bobby, they’ll keep you safe in the bunker.”
He didn’t deserve this. He was just hurting himself more, and Dean isn't the one to blame. He cleared to Castiel that this was just casual sex, no feelings involved. Castiel was just a booty call to Dean,
Is he really gone?
-- that opened across his brother's bar a few months ago. At least it was good for business, they never had so many clients before. The Club was a big factor as it didn't serve human food.
Every time he saw Dean, a 4
Cas blushed as he looked around, everybody was happy and clapping, only some people looked pissed and confused and Cas understood they were on the bride's side. Their friends were shouting and screaming blessings, Sam wiping his eyes from tears of joy that rolled, he had a huge smile on his face, Even the preacher was clapping happily.
If he saw Dean again later he could just say he wanted to ask him something about chemistry, the class they both shared.
“Cas,
Castiel melts even more onto Dean, he felt like the green-eyed bartender was fully determined to make him
was apparently all Castiel could manage to let out as he almost moaned when Dean ran his fingers on his hips.
It didn't take long before Dean cleaned him up and crawled inside the covers with him, arms wrapping around his waist as Castiel nuzzled into the older man's neck.
Cas is across him, wearing jeans and a dark grey henley. His specs missing, his eyes glassy and dark.
"Nervous dad?" Claire asked and his heart melted, Claire has been so difficult to call him dad, she didn't like the idea of him replacing her mother or Cas having to share them both. Yet, she left it behind it as Dean grew in her.
“Dean is incredible…” he admitted.
"Come on Barbar,
She took a step forward, "Have a good day."
"Oh, look who's finally listening!" Balthazar rolled his eyes as he turned in Cas' direction. The blue-eyed man heard his best friend chuckling.
Dean felt his neck loosen up, like his bones were melting and before he could let his head fell back Cas got a hold on him and brought him closer to him into his chest.
“It’s okay, you don’t have to…” he whispered.
“Where’s your room?”
How Dean was there and then here in
"Me too, Dean..
“Hey brotha,” Benny gave him a small nod.
But everything is fucked up, Castiel wants to scream, to cry a fucking river.
"Shudup..."Tracing his fingers onto Dean's stomach, Castiel realizes this is the first time they are cuddling and something warm and pleasant blossoms into his chest.
, Cas and his date had to leave the hell out of his damn mind and thinking point or this day will go to trash and he'll snap to the wrong person.
“Is there something on my face?”
"Dean I-I love you--"
if Benny’s a wolf, like Dean, and Sam… That mean’s every other friend Castiel has meet of Dean is—
