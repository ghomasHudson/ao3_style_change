“You're welcome,” Sherlock smiled, so tenderly that John's heart melted within him.
"You do that by yourself."
"I'm sorry," John chuckled, running a hand over his face before clasping it back around his cup.
His voice sounded even deeper when it resonated through his body, and the sensation was soothing. Just as much as Sherlock's words. John gave a loud sigh, hand leaving his face to rest on Sherlock's coat lapel, stroking it slightly with his thumb. "I know... Thank you..."
As he opened his eyes to meet Sherlock's, John had the pleasant surprise to see that Sherlock still had them closed. He smiled again.
“I take it that we could both use some self-love.”
Honey bee, honey bee
here, standing here, in
John followed his gaze and realised that he was still holding the bags from his errands. “Oh, um… Y-yeah, if you don't mind.”
“Oooh yes.”
That day, then, after a couple of hours spent running between the post office, the laundrette, Sherlock's own dry-cleaner (Posh Boy didn't want just
"Oh. Right." John blushed, feeling a bit stupid, but not quite fully rid of his doubts yet. He stared at the light-brown liquid in his mug. "You
For quite some time again, both lay gazing at each other in content silence, John tracing invisible lines on Sherlock's resting arm and kissing his face, here and there, until Sherlock brought them back to reality.
"Right! Yes, sorry." John pursed his lips, then remembered one last detail and hooked a thumb over his shoulder. "There's a loo down the hall, by the way. So you won't have to climb up and down if nature calls."
"Are you writing about it?"
to treat you like shit?... To beat you up?... To make you suffer?...”
John paused in the middle of putting on his jacket, the same smile curving on his lips in response as he resumed. "Good to know." He beamed at him, tugging at his sleeves and adjusting his collar, then gestured at the door with a tilt of his head. "Ready?"
after that. It was over.
John bit his lips hard to stop the tears from falling down, feeling like dying inside as he stared up into Sherlock's face and croaked the answer. "You."
"Mmm hmm, I noticed."
For a while, John lost track of time and became blissfully oblivious to the world around him – helped in that by the alcohol flowing through his system. But soon, a ring at the door made him snap back into reality.
John flashed a devilish smile. “Yes?...”
“Not a chance.”
A fuzzy and happy feeling in his heart, John licked his way up to Sherlock's jaw and captured his gaping lips to resume their kiss where they had left it, making it rougher and bitey this time around. The hand in his hair tensed and soon Sherlock responded in kind, his quickening breath mingling with John's in messy unison.
Glancing up, John hummed a playful “Mmm?...” and paused to run the flat of his tongue along one side of Sherlock's shaft, then over the dripping slit. That last move sent a violent jolt down Sherlock's spine who clutched John's hand before gripping the sheets into his fist instead, his legs jerking dangerously.
Pinching all the pollen from the cauliflowers
Honey bee, honey bee
The hoarse and panting call sent a jolt down John's spine. “Yes?...”
man — the way he deserved: thoroughly, reverently, voluptuously. Even if for John, this meant waiting some more.
Having made sure he didn't overlook anything, John trotted his way back downstairs, a blanket thrown over his shoulder and a pillow tucked under his arm.
“Come here,” he gestured with his chin to the empty space next to him.
Resting his hands on his hips in jaded disbelief, he stared back down at the opened bottle, his brain empty and blank, and eventually reached for it along with his glass to bring them both to the living room. With a muffled grunt, he sat down in the middle of the couch, turned on the TV to a random channel, and poured himself another round before leaning back.
, after what he'd done? How…
Swishing his choice of beverage around the glass, he took the time to sniff it and taste it, multiple times, until the 'ding' of the microwave brought his mind back to his dinner. Shooting an uninterested glance at it, he drank another gulp and, pouting in satisfaction, went to get his food. When he finally sat down, he turned on the radio to make up for the deafening silence in the room and began to eat, only half-listening to the evening news.
"For the same reason as you: because I didn't think you felt the way I did."
"You started it!"
The two men beamed at each other and Sherlock pouted in satisfaction, grabbing their cups to put them in the microwave. With a smile, John drew the chair at the end of the table and sat down.
Tugging at the small curls above his collar he pulled away slightly, face still close to his, nose brushing against his cheek for yet another moment before he moved back for good. As he did, his eyes locked with Sherlock's and both just smiled, dissolving into silent giggles like two inexperienced sweethearts discovering love and intimacy.
"You sure?"
Before Sherlock could answer, John pushed his bulging crotch into him and quickened the pace of his fist, letting out a grunt as Sherlock's hips arched against him.
That last thought made him snort at his own expense. What a jerk... He'd hate to have himself as a neighbour. Always grumpy, never happy... Well, in social settings that is. He never liked those. Not really. Greeting people as if he was glad to see them, wearing a fake smile all night, asking about what's-his-name's family when he couldn't care less, sitting through the telling of X's last vacation in Bermuda or Y's inescapable small talk about the weather... God, what a pain in the arse. It was so
“I hurt you, Sherlock. Bad. And I don't just mean…” He paused and gulped the aching lump in his throat as the scene in the morgue flashed again before his eyes. “I blamed you when it wasn't your fault. I pushed you away when you just wanted to help. I let you go through hell, and I was ready to leave you there. I'm…”
John closed his eyes and threw his head backwards, face contorted in desperation.
“I… still failed you,” he murmured.
John walked up to him, hands on his hips. "You sure you'll be alright?"
', is that it?" John asked, his voice hushed so he wouldn't wake Rosie up.
"Y–yes, it... it is."
"Yeah, yeah. She was just tired."
“I still can surprise you, then. Good to know.”
Their grinning eyes locking one last time, Sherlock reached for his own jacket and both set off.
Lifting his head a bit, he grabbed onto the tail of Sherlock's Belstaff and nestled his nose into the crook of his scarfed neck, his glass-holding hand finding its way up to Sherlock's hip. God, he smelled so nice... Was it perfume? Or the faint remnant of his after-shave? He couldn't tell. But he liked it. It was heady, exhilarating... just like him. With a smile, he buried his nose deeper in the cashmere of Sherlock's scarf and pressed himself closer.
Flirting with the butterfly strong upon the wing
He loved being kissed. Anywhere. And God was his body kissable. Everywhere John's lips would go, they'd find smooth, delicate flesh. He smelled wonderfully nice too; a subtle mix of soap, lotion, Cologne and natural scent that made John lose any sense of reality when he began to explore every inch of him. He could spend hours just brushing his mouth over him, breathing him in, touching, kissing, licking, biting… He wouldn't get tired of it. And he knew he never would.
"Oh, so we're doing
"Good night, John."
In a quiet sob, he lowered his head and covered his grimacing face with a trembling hand, while the other loosened its grip on the glass. How did it all come to this? How could he
Stroking his lover's cheekbones with his thumbs, John placed another kiss on his lips, then on his nose, then at the corner of his mouth, until Sherlock's lids fluttered up.
John looked at him for a moment, a fond expression on his face. “I don't,” he said gently. “But it's one of them. The soldier, the doctor... and the man who hates himself so much that he needed to take it out on someone else to avoid lashing out on himself, more than usual.”
“And?”
look — that intense stare from his striking mint green eyes, with that almost imperceptible wry smile — and John would melt.
"Thank you."
“You always surprise me.”
"Come on, we have a killer to catch," he said, giving a little pat on Sherlock's neck before grabbing his jacket off the nearest chair.
John sighed. "Well... War's not pretty. It's just... pain and suffering. Fear. Death. Not a favourable environment for relationships. Not romantic ones, anyway."
letter...
With the one of his hands that had been idle so far, John reached inside Sherlock's half-pulled-down underwear and started fondling with the delicate skin of his lower parts, squeezing and cupping them in his palm while he continued to suck, gentle and soft, with his cheeks hollowed.
"Oh for Christ's–"
“I don't know what's sexier,” he remarked while Sherlock continued to sort out the groceries, “You in lingerie or you doing domestic chores.”
Bees are all right when alive, you see
God, he tasted good. And he
Sherlock didn't move right away, and it was only when John reached his side that he straightened up with a sharp intake of breath. "Yes! Yes, I'm… fine," he answered, quickly wiping a trail of tears off his cheek.
It was all he could manage, all he could think of. And it was already too much to handle. With a gasp of air, he gave one last ruffle to Sherlock's curls and slowly let go of him, hands sliding down his large shoulders. When they faced again, Sherlock was the first to lock eyes with him, and the pure emotion that John read in them filled him with warmth. Sniffing back his own, he let out a wobbly chuckle and patted him on the neck, staring and smiling at his beautiful face. Sherlock smiled back, and both remained standing there in the quiet of the flat, disturbed only by the sound of increasing traffic outside.
Bz if you like
John felt his stomach flutter. "I... didn't mean to hinder your abilities."
"Weren't you?" Sherlock teased in a higher-pitched voice, his smirk perfectly audible.
The mist in his pale eyes was as dense as it was a few moments earlier, but a gleam of longing anticipation was now piercing through it.
"No, no. It was... mean, inconsiderate, and absolutely uncalled-for. I... was being a dick. For a change..."
He rubbed his back and nape to try and soothe him, like he would with Rosie. Because that's how it felt, having Sherlock in his arms like this. And he loved it.
A nice obedient busy busy bee
"The rhyme. '
John could hear in Sherlock's voice that he felt just as uneasy as he did, and knowing why broke his heart even further. How could he have done this to him? He was never going to be comfortable around him after that. He was never going to be
John mused.
Rosie's cries were getting louder above John's head, and every outburst was like a stab in the gut. She probably had woken up terrified upon hearing him shout; a thought that made John's burning eyes shed the tears which had been building up for a while. Wrenched with guilt, he exhaled a long and painful breath, wiped his cheeks, glanced down at his wounded hand again and, with another sigh, headed for the kitchen.
"I'm sorry..." he whispered, feeling worse than ever.
John looked up at him again, then at his bandaged palm. "Oh, um..." He had almost forgotten about it. "Fine, it's... just a minor cut. Nothing to worry about," he said with a flashed smile, his gaze flicking down almost as quickly.
"Nope, not at all," John smirked.
"God, you're a terrible learner..."
Sherlock's eyes went wide at his comment. It took John a few seconds to understand what was wrong, and when he did, he couldn't help but giggle.
And God, did Sherlock love him too. It was all there — in the dissipating mist of his pale green eyes, the wrinkles at their corners, the dimples in his cheeks, the softness of his features. Here was Sherlock Holmes, the World's Greatest Detective, and the most beautiful, big-hearted, loveful human being he had ever known.
John took a deep breath and let it go slowly. "I wanted to. I tried to be. But truth is – I never was. And I never could have been. Our marriage was over before it even started, really. And we struggled ever since. At least I did."
“Hello again…” John purred.
"Of course."
Sherlock's lips parted in distress at his last words. “I… didn't realise you were…”
The audacity he had demonstrated in the beginning was starting to fade, and it showed. He sounded croaky, taut; like he always did when he was trying to keep control of himself. But John knew it wouldn't take long for him to lose his grip. Not with him in charge.
"Did you really think I would believe any of that?" John continued, calm. "After she shot you,
Like the first time, Sherlock didn't manage to finish the sentence; but unlike the first time, John wasn't in the mood to play anymore — he wanted it over as much as Sherlock.
Flying all around the wild hedgerows
to take care of his clothes) and the nearest convenience store for refilling, John came home.
With his palm still under the flow, John opened the lower cupboard next to him and grabbed a clean tea towel from the folded pile. He waited another while for the bleeding to slow down a bit, then pulled his hand back from the water and applied the towel to the wound, turning off the tap.
I'd like to be a busy busy bee
Squeezing his eyes shut, he grasped Sherlock's nape curls and pulled him closer, swallowing the lump that had reappeared in his throat. “I promise you…” he whispered, “I will never hurt you again. Never again. And this is my own vow, to you.”
John nodded and smiled, admiring the picture before him: Sherlock Holmes, the Great Detective, holding a baby in his arms,
"Would you like me to stay tonight?" Sherlock offered. "To look after Rosie in case she wakes up again, while you rest?"
Once again, John couldn't remain unfazed and cracked a laugh into Sherlock's shoulder, hearing him respond in kind. "You sod," he joked, and Sherlock giggled some more.
A hint of the same smile appeared on Sherlock's lips. "You," he said, looking him in the eye.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand and both fell silent, their fingers playing with each other in a shy and absent-minded dance while they watched them, musing on that last conversation.
"Here you go!" he said, handing them over to Sherlock who was standing next to the couch.
, John smirked for himself. After all, it had been her specialty, her bargaining chip, as she used to brag about. Probably still was. But she didn't get that chance.
"What about now?..." Sherlock ventured, breaking the short silence that had fallen over the kitchen again, and by doing so cutting John's contemplation short.
“I love you,” he whispered, caressing Sherlock's lush mouth with his.
“For what I did to you.”
"Thank you, John."
That day, a Thursday in early June, was an errand day. John was the one in charge, of course. Sherlock didn't have time for it. Well, he
Before him, at the very same window he had seen him earlier, Sherlock was standing. Naked. Except for a piece of lingerie. White lace lingerie. Barely covering up his hip and… John swallowed… crotch. He was leaning from side-on with his left hand against the wall, thin fingers spread on the wallpaper, his other arm casually hanging next to him, his right leg held back so one could admire the inside of the thigh opposite — and what was between them.
A lopsided smile curved John's lips despite himself. What on earth was this song? He didn't even know Sherlock could sing, and very well at that! He was playing along the lyrics perfectly, altering his voice when needed, and John could only imagine the look of pure fascination on Rosie's little round face.
With a sniff, he took a good sip of his wine and let his gaze wander around the kitchen, then across the living room, where his eyes fell on the coffee table and the laptop sitting on it with its screen down.
Letting out another sigh, he grabbed the last of the ready-cooked dishes – some roasted chicken with pasta and seasonal vegetables – closed the fridge's door and headed for the microwave. While his dinner heated up, he stopped by the wine rack and, without much hesitation, took out a bottle of white that he brought back to the table where the corkscrew was already waiting, picking up a glass from the dish drainer on his way. His gestures swift and self-assured, he opened the bottle and poured himself a generous measure, watching as the golden liquid gurgled out.
anything? How could he even
John smiled. “Come here,” he murmured, holding out both his hands to Sherlock. His foggy eyes fixed on him, Sherlock obeyed and placed his hands into John's, who squeezed them with a tender look. “Let's go.”
“I'll help you.”
Following it like a lighthouse in the storm, John peered through the haze and let out an aborted curse at the sight of Sherlock's heavy-lidded eyes, flushed cheeks and dishevelled curls, squeezing the last drops of ecstasy from his throbbing cock.
Bz bz bz bz
“Don't be. Why would you be?”
His initial surprise and bumbling attempts to string two words together had made way to an unabashed desire and husky tone, and he could feel the blood pumping through his veins and cock just by thinking about what he was going to do to him.
"N–no, I did," John shifted in his seat, "I did forgive you. But maybe... not in every way." He stroked the back of Sherlock's hand, trying to figure out how to best explain it. "I think I forgave you as a friend, but… not... as a lover. Well, a
In the dim light of the room, John gazed at the features of his ridiculously gorgeous face, the dark and luscious curls surrounding it like the finely-crafted frame of a painting, the tender glow in his pale green eyes, the soft stretch of his generous lips, his oh-so kissable lips... Before he knew it, he was reaching for them; and before he could stop, he was pressing his mouth to Sherlock's. He lingered just enough to feel how firm and plump it was, and how warm too – just the way he had imagined it to be – and then pulled away.
“We should, yeah…” John conceded, reaching inside Sherlock's underwear to set his hardening cock free instead.
“Come here, silly!” John laughed, skirting around the table to pull him into a hug. “It's my turn,” he joked, and he could hear Sherlock's lips curling up as he wrapped his arms around him.
The impromptu gesture made Sherlock squirm and he sucked in a fluttering breath, his hands looking for the rim of the sink. “Oh you bast—” he let out in a sigh, keeping the full offense away from his posh mouth.
Honey bee, honey bee
Bzzzz Bzzzz
dating history now?"
On the lookout, he squinted at the other end of the room and checked his watch: it was 20:30.
"OK."
John stared at him. “You still really mean that?”
Sherlock sniffed and nodded, a bit more self-assured now. "We do."
"If you need anything, feel free to wake me up, OK?"
Sherlock raised his mug to his lips and sipped a long mouthful of tea, silence settling on the kitchen. His own lips pursed in embarrassment, John glanced at him. It only took their gazes to meet for both of them to crack up.
John nodded and stepped closer, looking around. "Well, that's about it, I think..." He smiled and stopped in front of Sherlock who smiled at him in turn. "So... Good night, then?"
"I guess not." He paused in his typing. "Yoga, though?"
Sherlock kept mum, absorbing every word.
Oh what a glorious thing to be
“John…” Sherlock continued, speaking ever so quietly. “You were grieving. You were angry, and—”
Before he could take a closer look at the exquisite display, the lean and bare figure vanished out of sight. John followed it to the kitchen and stopped on the threshold, watching his beloved unpack the shopping bags.
"Major Sholto?" Sherlock continued hesitantly.
Their bodies were touching now; and God was Sherlock's hot. He could feel the warmth of his skin oozing out of his open collar, without even touching it. A flush of heat overwhelming his own body, John pulled him into a deeper kiss, blood pumping through his veins as he dared the slightest hint of a tongue. Sherlock's fingers tightened up on his waist, but it didn't take long for him to answer back, the slick and keen touch sending a jolt down John's spine who couldn't help but moan.
"John..." Sherlock began. He sounded pained. "Let me help you... You know I'll do anything for you. Anything. Just tell me."
John smiled at Sherlock who had kept his eyes closed. Gosh, what a gorgeous profile. Nose, cheekbones, lips, jaw… everything was so damn perfect. He could look at him for hours, and kiss every inch of his face for at least as long.
"Yes."
"Good night..."
A heavy pounding in his chest (and a growing throbbing in his pants), John remained still while Sherlock stood back up to his full height and, with a last teasing look, headed for the kitchen. As he did, John couldn't help his eyes from slipping down Sherlock's large and finely-toned back to… his arse. Left virtually naked by the lace disappearing between his ravishing buttocks.

“Definitely.”

was making his cock twitch in a painful way.
Sherlock stared at him with big, round eyes and opened his mouth several times, no sound coming out of it.
, he rejoiced some more as he watched Sherlock squirm and writhe in pleasure under him, chin tilted to the ceiling.
"Of course not."
“Mmm… Well, let's start with you lying down then, shall we? And that's an order this time.”
"Something serious?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just... It's been a rough week."
The attention he showed when he was holding her shone through again as he bent over the cot to place her into it, his large hands seeming even bigger wrapped around her tiny, chubby body. He didn't let go until she was lying safe on the mattress, and when he finally did, John caught him resting gentle fingers on her stomach – a gesture that made his heart melt... and ache. What had he done...
“N-no, please, stop this. You didn't.”
“John…”
. If he didn't know better, he would have thought himself back in Afghanistan, on those nights when he'd stop a fight between two drunken comrades in arms. Except
“You took your time.”
"No?"
“Don't worry, I can mana—” he began, and then froze.
"What makes you think I can't give you that?" Sherlock repeated, calm.
“More than successful…” John panted back, before his foggy mind caught up. “Wait— experiment?...”
The words felt like a stab in the gut. And by the way Sherlock tilted his chin up as he took them in, John knew they had the same effect on him. His chest in a vice, John licked his lips again and stepped forward, staring at the table between them.
“Yes, I know, it's against the rules of British etiquette. But we'll make up for it tonight with the height of Britishness on DVD.”
, he frowned. But then, what wasn't with Sherlock?
“Listen, um… there's… something I…”
Honey bee, honey bee
Sherlock nodded. "I thought you were..."
"John..."
John couldn't bear to hold his gaze and watch the inevitable pity take over it. Because what else could he feel for him? After everything he had witnessed tonight? The drinking, the tears, the outbursts, the distress... He
“Everything.”
"Good old Mike," Sherlock smiled in turn.
"What?... You're agreeing with this, aren't you?"
“I'm sorry,” he butted in, waiting a few seconds before looking up to meet Sherlock's questioning gaze and worried expression.
"I know," he repeated, twirling the mug between his palms. "Is that why you told me she'd saved your life? That night you escaped from the hospital to expose her and accepted to...
"I'm not so sure about that."
John grinned inside.
"It will, trust me. And even if it doesn't… You're not just a brain, you know? You're much more than that."
“You look… absolutely gorgeous…” he whispered against Sherlock's skin, feeling it shiver under his lips. “Utterly… painfully…” He drew out the pause, slipping his busy hand down the front of Sherlock's lingerie to cup his groin through the lace. “… gorgeous…”
John looked him in the eye and licked his lower lip in a more than suggestive way. “Oh yeah.”
"Is it that much of a surprise?"
“So…” John said at last, his lips pressed to Sherlock's shoulder. “Bathroom?”
John closed his eyes once more, a sharp tingle running down his body. He could feel the curves of Sherlock's buttocks around his groin as distinctly as he would without clothes, and the mere thought of
Being just as busy as a bee can be
"Well…" John began, slowly breaking away to look him in the eye. "For starters, you are a very kind-hearted man; always ready to help those in need, whatever it takes. You're a patient little brother, and God knows how Mycroft can be annoying…"
John chuckled again and shook his head indulgently, staring at the ridiculous man sitting next to him. God, he loved him. He loved him so damn much.
John gave him a gentle squeeze and curled his fingers back around his mug, grinning at the memory of that unforgettable 29
Sherlock nodded and lowered his eyes again, observing John's thumb as it brushed across his knuckles. "You never really forgave me for playing dead, did you?" he said, more as a fact than a question, his voice coming out like a hoarse whisper.
"Mmm hmm."
“Yeah, definitely.”
John was in no better shape. His little teasing game was getting him just as worked up as Sherlock, and the throbbing sensation in his boxers was becoming particularly uncomfortable, to say the least. But he enjoyed himself too much to stop. He wanted Sherlock to lose all the control he had left. He wanted to drive him near the edge, make him beg for more. And oh boy, was he gonna beg.
To his dismay — but as expected, really — no one was waiting for him in the hall when he finally managed to open the door, despite his hands full with bags.
It wouldn't take long for him to come, John knew it. And he also knew that if he chose to speed up, Sherlock wouldn't be able to contain himself one more minute. But he would not choose to do that; not this time. This time was special. And he wanted to make the most of it; honour this wonderful and gorgeous man —

"You're hopeless."
sensitive. He always had been, but experience didn't make him less responsive to any of John's attentions, quite the opposite. And today wasn't an exception.
"I'll be fine, don't worry."
"I really wanted you to be happy."
“I've forgiven you, John,” he said softly.
, John thought with gleeful pride.
"This," Sherlock gestured at the microscope, "all of this, solving cases, I…" He paused, his voice suddenly hoarse and raw. "I feel… diminished. I feel like my brain power is decreasing. I can't think, I can't… connect the dots. And it scares me…"
He gave a trembling sigh and ran a hand on his face, resting the other on his hip. A monster, that's what he was.

John's chin dropped further. That was precisely what he didn't want to do. All he wanted in this very moment was to disappear off the face of the Earth, for good. But he couldn't run away from himself any longer. He had to take the responsibilities for his actions.
A tense silence fell over the room, but John couldn't hear it. His ears were ringing, buzzing with nagging voices – his own.
"You're right, you're right. I'm... I'm sorry, I... I didn't want to... make you..."
"No," he let out at last, a lump rising in his throat. He did not dare raise his eyes and kept them fixed on the carpeted floor, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Scoffing at his own words, he continued to walk back and forth for a while, clammy fingers drumming on the edges of his glass, until everything he'd just said echoed in his head – and crept in his heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
John felt his heart sink. "No, you're obviously not. What's wrong?"
The two men remained looking at one another for some time, fingers playing with fingers, smiles answering smiles, bodies moving closer and mouths reaching for skin. No words; only looks and touches… and them. Just them. Against the rest of the world.
himself to hope... until what he read in the detective's eyes removed any doubt. Breathless, John looked into his face one more time and, letting the tears free, seized it to pull him into a kiss.
Sherlock's eyebrows came back down and furrowed in thought for a fleeting moment, his whole face suddenly lighting up as the answer to John's riddle popped into his mind.
“What are you thinking about?” Sherlock beamed, drawing John out of his mind.
"Alright. So..."
Biting at Sherlock's shoulder again to distract his body from its urges, John tightened the grip of his unemployed hand on Sherlock's hip and focused on the twist and turns of his moving wrist, not leaving any part of his lover's length untouched.
The words crushed what was left of John's heart, and he closed his eyes before they could well up. "You can't help me."
John knew him inside out — what he liked, what he didn't like, what turned him into a whimpering mess, what made him uncomfortable, where he loved to be touched, where he didn't want John to linger, how he preferred to be handled, when he preferred to be handled…
But maybe I wouldn't be a bee
“Ooooh…”
This time, he didn't need to guess the expression on his face – Sherlock's arm tightening around him was enough of an answer. His chest filled with warmth, John nudged his head at Sherlock's, pulling him even closer.
him again after that – which he doubted very much.
share a bath with her, though..."
A gentle smile welcomed his comment. "You already did."
It didn't take deduction skills for John to tell that Sherlock was already losing his mind. His cock was throbbing; hot blood pumping through it and making it deliciously warm against John's tongue; and its turgid head was leaking with each stroke. Every time John bobbed up and wrapped his mouth around Sherlock's crown, a deep and hoarse sound would come from his lover's lips, adding to the moans pouring out of him – and to John's frustrated excitement.
“… the bedroom…”
“You're doing well, soldier,” he smirked when he reached his angelic face, craning his neck down to kiss him.
John skipped a breath, his body flaring up.
John felt the world crashing down around him. "N–no, please d—" His voice trailed off and he shook his head with a grimace, fists clenched in pain and anger. "Why, WHY do I have to ruin EVERYTHING!?" he roared, throwing his glass to the floor where it shattered at his feet.
The warm welcome of Sherlock's lips made him shiver, and he had to hold himself back from sobbing against them. His hands were trembling, his breath shaky as he pulled away only to press another kiss to Sherlock's mouth, his heart bursting when he felt Sherlock kiss him back, the ghost of thin fingers on his hips.
“Tea?” Sherlock asked, still giggling from his own recollection of the events as he stood up from his chair.
"What?..."
Sherlock blushed. "N–no, that's not... I– I just..." His eyes went from John's face to John's hand laid over his to John's face again, before dropping down with a touché expression. "Thank you," he said in a low voice, his gratitude palpable.
"What if it doesn't?..." Sherlock croaked, the sound muffled in John's shirt.
Honey bee, honey bee
The teasing command made Sherlock tremble and give a long, flustered sigh. “Yes, captain,” he whispered back, offering John the rawest and most lustful look as he faced him again.
. Strong, and yet so exquisitely fine. And these dark curls swirling uncontrollably above his pale skin… Jesus. John sighed with envy, licking his lips, and gave Sherlock's neck another quick look. The daylight was declining, and the raking sunbeams highlighted the little freckles he loved to kiss and connect with his fingertips.
Despite his call, John sealed his lips tighter around him and kept on sucking, teasing the rim of his head in quick side rubs until the awaited first surge of warm, salty cum shot against the roof of his mouth, Sherlock's climatic grunt echoing simultaneously around the room. Before he could have a taste of a second one, John pulled away and watched as Sherlock unloaded onto his own chest, cock twitching with every spurt, his offered throat giving a few final groans while his entire frame spasmed in rhythm, highlighting every contracted muscle in his stomach, arms, thighs…
As he reached the limit between skin and lace, John hooked his fingers around the elastic band and pulled it down to set Sherlock's artwork-made-flesh completely free, planting further kisses until there was no more length to cover.
"It's alright."
John closed his eyes at the sound, landing more kisses on his lover's skin to try and ignore the burning heat settling in his loins. “To?...”
Sherlock gave him a faint, misty smile and John couldn't help but crack an overwhelmed laugh in answer, pulling him into a hug.
“From miles away, yeah… But then you're not in a condition to think, are you?...” John quipped while his loosely closed fist started to bob up and down.
Sherlock shook his head quickly. "N–no, I... I mean..."
Sherlock smirked at John's enthusiasm. “You won't see anything new this time, you know.”
“… to believe that it's the only image I have of you now.”
Obeying his new-found yoga professor's directives, he rested his hands on his knees and cleared his throat, taking a deep breath. After five seconds, he opened one eye to peek at Sherlock.
He was beginning to feel sleepy from the wine – a bit giddy too – and the heat of Sherlock's body didn't help. How long had they been standing there? One minute? More? He didn't have the slightest idea. And he didn't care, really. He felt good, relaxed,
“Jesus, Sh…”
"We shouldn't because of Mary?..."
he thought once more, wondering how he would ever be able to look him in the eye again after that; if he would even
John chuckled at his confused face and gave him a tender smile. "What happened to the Great Detective's observation skills, uh?"
It was a sweet, languorous kiss; not an urgent or needy one. Despite the fire raging inside him, John wanted to make Sherlock feel safe, to make him feel loved more than just desired, even though he was. Oh God, he was.
He had somehow completely forgotten about it.
A naughty smile crossed Sherlock's face. “Yes, sir,” he complied, sitting on the edge of the bed and laying back across the rumpled bedding, his mint green eyes resolutely locked on John.
"It wasn't supposed to be."
were over.
John smiled and placed a few wet kisses on his back, right hand sliding from Sherlock's hip to his arse, stroking it gently but firmly. “I was waiting for the right opportunity,” he said, running a finger up his crack along the lace.
John felt cautious fingers touch his shoulder and he forced himself to open his eyes.
“I suppose so, yeah,” John chuckled, his gaze following Sherlock's every movement with increasing lust.
But he didn't want to rush it, still. He didn't want to give in, not now, not yet. He wanted to make it last, to make Sherlock come undone bit by bit, entirely, unapologetically. And oh boy, was he going to.
“God, Sherl…”
“Do you want me to make you another cup?”
"Can I ask you a question?" John spoke after a while.
John looked up from the invisible spot he was staring at and fixed his gaze on Sherlock, cracking a smile full of affection for this ridiculous and wonderful man.
"At what? A dysfunctional marriage?" John laughed without heart. "If it weren't for Rosie, we would have separated a long time ago. Hell, if you hadn't disappeared for two years, none of this would have happened."
"No." Sherlock looked at him and shook his head again, smiling despite himself. "What part of 'Girlfriends are not my area' did you not understand that first night?"
He couldn't even begin to describe how grateful he was to have him by his side right now. He could have left, called it quits, especially after the way John had treated him since he'd arrived. But he didn't. He stayed, for him. How could he put up with him, John didn't know. All he knew was that he felt incredibly lucky. And he wasn't ready to let go of that feeling yet.
John choke back another sob, shaking his head. "No, it's really not. I'm– I'm not–" He didn't even know where that sentence was supposed to go, but he didn't try to fill in the blanks. He felt lost, and ashamed. He'd never wanted Sherlock to see him like this. He was never meant to
The sound had something soothing about it. Whether it be iced whiskey after a long day, fresh soda on a heated afternoon, or hot tea on a cold winter evening, it always was synonymous with comfort and enjoyment. Granted, he preferred his drink harder and darker, but he appreciated them all; as long as they achieved the desired effect. Tonight, he wanted to relax. And wine was the perfect remedy for that.
, John marvelled. And with that thought he kissed him again, on the lips this time, a tingling shiver running down his body as Sherlock's mouth responded in kind. Exchanged smiles, shared looks, and John went for another, and another, until he wasn't playing coy anymore. Pecks turned into more daring kisses, each one hotter and deeper than the last, and soon gasps and moans were filling the room, John hanging onto Sherlock's jacket lapels while Sherlock cradled his face with trembling hands.
Bz if you like
Holding him down by the waist, John carried on and kissed his way down Sherlock's length, inch by inch, appreciating the soft and hardly veiny texture under his lips.
"Good, good."
“Nah, it's fine. Just put them in the microwave, it'll do the trick.”
But don't sting me
Reaching the sink, he turned on the cold water tap and put his hand under the stream, grimacing as it washed the blood from his wound. The cut wasn't deep, which was sort of a relief. There was no shard of glass that he could see or feel, nor any nerve damage. But he was good for a week of pain, antiseptics and discomfort. Great.
With a last round of laughter, John slowly broke their embrace and let go of Sherlock's coat, his grin meeting his friend's. God, he was so beautiful when he smiled. The way his whole face lightened up and his eyes crinkled at the edges... It made him look ten years younger, if not more. Such a lovely sight. The loveliest John had ever seen, really.
Sherlock's call seemed to come from far away, drowned in the noise of John's inner turmoil. He could barely see his tall silhouette approaching out of the corner of his eye.
A healthy grown up busy busy bee
“It happens,” Sherlock smiled.
They hadn't talked again about what happened. About what John did. To him. In that morgue. And the more time passed, the more his guilt grew. He knew he couldn't let that slide. But he was afraid to bring it up. Afraid of seeing the pain on Sherlock's face again, or worse: fear.
He gulped the rest of his wine and started pacing the farthest side of the room, shaking his head. His chest was burning with anger.
It took Sherlock a few seconds to absorb every word John had said – along with every strong emotion they had aroused in him – but once he did, it was gratitude that settled on his face. "Thank you," he let out softly, looking more beautiful than ever.
"Because... you can't give me what I want."
As he stopped by the door to unbolt it, he wondered if there was a polite way to tell someone to bugger off. Probably not, but he could try his best to make it clear without sounding like an utter prick. If there was any chance he wasn't considered one already.
"Yeah."
"How is your hand?..." Sherlock asked, breaking the ice for them.
His reply had come out a bit more drily than intended, and John didn't need to see Sherlock's face as he let him inside to know that he had made him uneasy, and anxious. He could tell his brain was working around questions, gathering data and trying to come up with answers.
"Of course I do."
It had been a week since John, Mrs Hudson, Molly and Lestrade began to take turns to stay with Sherlock during his rehab, and he was doing a lot better. His left eye was still bloodshot – though almost back to normal – and his body still weak from drug abuse and ill-nourishment, but he looked healthier and… yes, somehow happier than he had in days. Which made John's heart beam as much as it was making it burn.

"Are you alright?..."
At this, a shadow crossed Sherlock's face and he winced a little.
But don't sting me
"What makes you think I can't give you that?"
"New hobby?" he asked after a while, eyes fixed upon the screen.
Building up the honeycomb just like tripe

“John, look at me…”
“Oooh yes.”
Sherlock was getting rock-solid now. John could sense every pulsation of hot blood under his curled fingers, and a faint moistness gathering on his skin. And fuck was it arousing. His breathing was getting heavier too, more and more laboured as John sped up and pulled, and soon only deep sounds were coming out of his outstretched throat.
God, did John love him.
An hour could have passed and he wouldn't have noticed. He was feeling good; good and safe. It hadn't always been like that; especially when pain and frustration were the only sentiments that being close to Sherlock would arouse in him. But things had changed now. He didn't have to hide anymore. He didn't have to pretend to be someone he was not. He could be himself, and finally at one with his feelings. And the sense of forbidden love and desire that Sherlock once embodied belonged to the past. He was his sanctuary now. A new hope. A promise for the future.
John didn't even take a look at it when he got home. In fact, he had ignored it completely for the past three days. He didn't want to know where she was. And he didn't want to bother to find out. She could be near, hundreds of miles away or on another continent... it didn't matter. She obviously knew what she was doing. She always did. And whatever he had to say never came under consideration. Hence her letter. That
The whole situation felt surreal; not exactly back to where it was before, but not exactly anywhere yet either. They had found their spark again, that bond and complicity they had always shared and which had made them who they were back in the days. But there was something more now. Something not quite defined, but something serenely evident.
"You're welcome."
flat, this… nearly sacred place,
"Would you like something to drink or...?" he asked, avoiding eye contact.
"What?..."
"Ready."
“I want everything you want.”
“Nothing, I… I'm just happy.”
"Why?"
His comment was welcomed by an imperceptible shrug from Sherlock's delicate and round shoulders. "Helps me think."
A fond smile on his face, John came out of hiding and rested his shoulder against the door frame, arms crossed, watching as Sherlock paced the room once more.
Oh what a glorious thing to be
"From a communication standpoint, yes," Sherlock said with a little smile, trying to lighten things up. John scoffed and Sherlock took another sip. "What about you?" he asked after a while, his eyes fixed ahead on the table.
Sherlock cast a sheepish glance at him, the corner of his mouth lifting very briefly in the same fashion. “I'm sorry.”
"God..." John broke off the kiss and rested his head against Sherlock's shoulder, hands clenched at his jacket and neck. "For all these years, I thought..." he gasped, unable to finish.
"Oh, well done!... I wasn't throwing you a line, you know?"
“Kind of. I suspected that it would make a strong impression on you… but I had not anticipated the full extent of it.”
“J–John… P–please… We really should… go to…”

His voice trailed off and he had to close his eyes to keep the tears away. Everything he had just said sounded so meaningless and hollow compared to the pain he had caused. How was he even allowed to
"Is it clear now?"
But when bees die, you really should see 'em
"And you kissed her."
Whiling away the passing hours
“I vowed to protect—”
The combined attentions were quick to whip Sherlock up into a frenzy of whimpers, causing his hips to buck harder. “J–John!…” he cried out, his baritone dying out in heavy gasps.
“Obviously,” Sherlock remarked, and with a shared look, made the pair of them giggle.
"Good night, John."
A hand on his guilty mouth, he ran off to the other side of the room, eyes darting around the place in utter panic. Why did he do this? What had gotten into him? What was Sherlock going to
"I really don't deserve you..." he muttered into Sherlock's scarf after a while, more as a statement than anything else. He could almost hear Sherlock's brow furrow at his words.
Brushing the curve of his lower lip with a thumb, John gazed at him with all the adoration in the world, pushing back a lock of dark hair on his pale forehead before kissing him again.
"Would you like another cup of tea?" Sherlock offered eventually.
Bz if you like
When he was finally done with the groceries (and his discreet staring), John took off his jacket and stepped into the living room to hang it on the coat rack, clearing his throat as he turned to Sherlock… who remained imperturbable. With a little sigh, John skirted around him and sat at the table in front of his laptop. He opened the bookmark to his blog, logged in, and started typing.
"Where's Rosie?"
“It was… unforgivable. It
"Well, that's better!" he exclaimed as he reappeared in the living room.
Sherlock's mouth stretched against his. “Am I?”
The kitchen went silent all of a sudden, and that's when John realised that Rosie had stopped crying. For a second, he feared that something had happened to her. But then he remembered that Sherlock was with her. God, Sherlock... The image of his shaken face after John had kissed him flashed into John's mind, and his stomach churned.
John's chest tightened. “Yeah, well, you shouldn't have,” he croaked, a single tear slipping down his cheek which he quickly wiped with the tip of his fingers, looking away for a bit. When he peeked back at Sherlock, he saw that his jaw had dropped slightly.
"And I'll try my best to help you."
Honey bee, honey bee
Pinned on a card in a mucky museum
As he made his way down Sherlock's chest, John felt a hand rush to his hair, its fingertips clinging to the shorter strands at his nape. He smiled. He was getting close to a sensitive area; one that sealed the beginning of the end for Sherlock, every single time.
agree. After that last case Sherlock had asked John to assist him with; a series of poisoning attempts in the West End theatre district. He remembered now. Shit.
"And neither did you," he added, glancing across at Sherlock's almost full mug.
"Just curious."
They fell into silence for a while, both of them contemplating what the other had said, until Sherlock spoke again, his tone calm and reflective.
"Don't worry," Sherlock said quickly, "I'll– I'll take care of her. Just... treat that wound, okay?... I'll be right back. Alright?..."
Oh what a glorious thing to be
“Right, yes!” he exclaimed, getting his hands off Sherlock and stepping back. “Sorry, I… completely forgot about that,” he snorted in amusement.
“Really?!”
John cracked a laugh and leaned against Sherlock's shoulder, turning his head to bury his nose and soft giggles into the luscious curls. Sherlock couldn't help but smile and soon joined him, his deep voice vibrating against John's lips.
John frowned. "Do what?"
, John told himself, shaking his head.
Sherlock hadn't moved one bit since John's return, and John was starting to think that he'd lost himself deep down his Mind Palace… which required new clothes and bare feet now, for some reason. His respiration was slow and calm, so much that John sometimes wondered if he was breathing at all. But what stroke him the most was how soft he looked. There was something… ethereal about him and the way the light was playing with his lean figure. The warm sunrays of the late summer afternoon gave his dark curls a gentle halo and his pale skin a velvet-like look.
His answer had almost come as a whisper, and John felt his heart sink. “Sherlock, you are… God, I don't even know where to start…” He paused and rested his fists on the table, leaning in to catch Sherlock's attention. “You're a great man, Sherlock. More than that: you're a good one. You're human, kind… definitely an oddball and sometimes a bit of an arse, but…” he chuckled, managing a smile, “… as I told you before, and more than once: you are the best and the wisest man I've ever known. And
Whoopee! Oh death, where is thy sting?
A playful smile was floating on his lips, and even though he wouldn't look at him, John knew what he was thinking:
John beamed and gazed into the glistening veil that had taken over Sherlock's pale green eyes. He had listened to him in absolute and immobile silence, hanging on his every word, absorbing them with the most care, and the emotion they had stirred was now written all over his face.
Sherlock's stomach shook and rumbled against John as a low chuckle rose from his throat. John's smile widened.
The smile that the detective had been showing until now faded away, his brows furrowing in confusion. "We... agreed last week to meet at your place tonight, to check on Mary?... Don't you remember?..."
Cluedo), or spend their free evenings at home watching crap telly. And the feeling was wonderful.
Sherlock gazed at him through bliss-heavy lids with a hint of the same smile. “I love you too…”
His jeans getting tighter by the second, John stepped across the room and watched as Sherlock made his way to the cupboards above the sink, the muscles in his back rippling in motion as he lifted his arms to put a pair of tins away.
He gave a bitter chuckle and bit his lower lip.
, he thought.
Sherlock's voice had paused in the middle and trailed off on the last words, and it took John a quick glance at him to see that he was staring at the coffee table – and the almost empty bottle of wine on it. He gritted his teeth.
"Well... as ever..." Sherlock panted, "... you see but you do not observe..."
His eyes fixed on John, he stopped right in front of him and reached for the bags, taking them from John's hands. John shivered at the touch and stared back into Sherlock's face, achingly close to his own as the detective towered over him, his rosy lips within reach.
It wasn't long in coming, and it came as expected.
Checking the few lines he'd just written, he pouted and glanced at Sherlock once again, turning on his seat.
"Close your eyes and concentrate."
“Yes? What is it?” Sherlock asked, his voice so soft and attentive that it made John's stomach turn a bit more. He cleared his throat and took a deep breath to gather his courage.
At this, Sherlock's jaw dropped slightly, and his eyes did that blinking thing John was so very fond of. "Do you… really think that?..." he asked, almost in a gasp.
But don't sting me

: desire, fulfilment, love... There was some timorousness among them too, and regret – the regret not to have showed him sooner, to have caused him pain.
Keeping him warm between his lips, John loosened the hand gripping at his wrist to intertwine it with his own and began to suck gently, first at the swollen head, then a couple of inches farther down, working him with his full tongue in slow rubbing or swirling motions, eyes half-closed to savour the musky flavour of his skin.
"I hope you'll be comfortable… Never tried sleeping on it."
His voice had come out in a faint whisper; the only sound he was capable of right now. He couldn't tear his gaze off the see-through lace work that wrapped up Sherlock's pretty little package; a pretty little package that he was burning to cup and rub and—

"I'm sorry, I... I completely forgot," he said, looking back up at Sherlock whose expression had changed from bewilderment to concern.

"You're a splendid violinist, an incredibly funny gent when you set your mind to it, a tough but fair movie critic… and a pretty good cook, as it turns out!..." he chuckled. "But above all: you're the best friend one could ever have, a wonderful parent for Rosie, and… the greatest companion I could hope for to go through this new journey with."
He paused and licked his lips, eyes fixed on the kitchen floor he'd just stepped onto. His heart was racing and he was beginning to feel sick.
John nodded, elated. “Bathroom.”
A few silent seconds passed, John's slow fingers on the keyboard being the only sound one could hear in the room.
"Sure."
"Alright! This time, we're all set to g—"
"Yeah, sorry, but I think I'm allowed a drink or two. Or three or four,
“Christ…” John laughed, shaking his head at the incredible story Sherlock had just told him. It was an old case of his, a gruesome but ridiculously stupid murder he helped solve back in his younger days. John had heard many stories from his first years as a consulting detective – though he hadn't invented the job at the time – and that one was by far his favourite now. Along with the 'Jellyfish' case, maybe.
"And... after the war? You never thought about... contacting him again?"
"But that's the point, isn't it?" John carried on, driven by the exhilarating freedom to finally speak up. "None of this would have happened. We wouldn't be here, talking about all this. Yeah, we could have gone about it way earlier, sure. But we didn't know. And maybe we needed this. Maybe... we needed to hit the lowest point to rise up higher, I don't know. All I know is that... even though I regret the time we wasted – and the pain – in the end, we are the choices that we make. And this..." he placed his hand over Sherlock's once more, holding it tight, "this... is mine. Today."
“That much of a mess?” John laughed bitterly. “Oh yeah.”
“God…”
Bz if you like
"John!..." Sherlock cried with a disapproving tone, which melted into a high-pitched laugh as John slid onto him and nuzzled at his ticklish neck, their glee filling up the room for the rest of the day.
“John…” Sherlock called again, this time in a more desperate and needy way, his hips giving an involuntary thrust against John's face.
“J–John… I'm— I'm com— John!...”
"Thank you," he whispered, brushing the wool of the Belstaff with the tip of his fingers.
Breathing hot against Sherlock's back, John pressed himself closer and began to stroke in long, hard motions, fingers playing with the outline of Sherlock's ball sack and still-flaccid prick under the fabric. He could feel it clench every time he would come across its head, Sherlock's breath growing thicker with every rub.
Honey bee, honey bee
“Thought I'd lost you somewhere,” John continued, tip of his nose brushing against Sherlock's.
Wrapping the last bit of bandage around his wrist, he cast a glance over the mess he'd made in the room. The floor and carpet were scattered with broken glass, and a few bloodstains marked the spot where he had stood motionless after his angry outburst.
John stared at him for a moment, then gave a sad sniff. "We've been complete idiots, haven't we?"
“Hello…” Sherlock muttered in answer, his voice the lowest of baritones.
Visiting the picnics, quite a little tease
"About Irene Adler..."
“Good.” He turned on his side and leaned up on an elbow. “I love you for who you are, always have and always will. You know that too, right?”
Sherlock blinked painfully at the name. "Maybe... we should wait... until things are resolved..."
His gaze locked on Sherlock's face, John brought his mouth to the head of Sherlock's cock and started kissing it, one peck after the other, his lips pressing ever so slightly to the curves of the exposed crown and the sensitive skin retracted underneath, just enough to make it clench — and see Sherlock's chin tilt all the way back in obvious enjoyment.
“Sherl... What are you…”
“John—”
"And if you hadn't? Met me? Would you have tried to... see him again? Once his assignment was over? To... pick up where you left off?"

threatened to shoot you again?"
“I know.”
The word escaped him like a punch to the gut and he slammed his eyes shut, mouth wide open, jerking pleasure out of him in frantic strokes and with resounding moans as he sprayed Sherlock's stomach in turn.
"If it's no bother, yes."
I'd like to be a busy busy bee
John had just entered the kitchen with both arms full of groceries when an unusual sight caught his eye — Sherlock, sitting on the living room carpet with his legs crossed, palms facing up and resting on his knees, eyelids down. The typical yoga posture. Not only that: he was wearing an outfit that John had never seen before — a grey tank top and matching loose trousers.
Both men gazed at each other for another while, enjoying the simplicity and intimacy of the moment, until John took it on himself to break the silence.
He felt Sherlock's fingers squeeze his shoulder in response. "It's okay..."
"Thank you," he breathed to his ear, a thin trail of tears trickling down his cheeks as he closed his eyes. The arms around him squeezed tighter, and with a contented sigh he let it all go, abandoning himself to the peace of the moment and the warmth of Sherlock's embrace.
Sherlock's throat moved up and down. "I... I think I should leave..."
Swinging the door open, he was just about to mumble an annoyed "Yes?" when the sight of a familiar dark-coated figure cut him short and made his eyes go wide.
"Please don't."
“Not at all.”
"Ta," John said as Sherlock put a steaming mug of tea on the table in front of him, then sat on the next chair with his own, his large hands wrapping around the ceramic and almost making it disappear from view.

Fingers tangled in his curly hair, John gave him another long, slow kiss and drifted towards his neck again, sliding down his chest and stomach all through to his navel where he met with his favourite toy.
Honey bee, honey bee
"I'll... put her back to bed," Sherlock continued in a murmur, waiting for John to gesture a yes before heading for Rosie's crib.
Keeping a low profile, he climbed up the last steps and sneaked through the hallway to the open door of Rosie's nursery, just in time to catch Sherlock making
– God, he could admire it for nights on end. Admittedly, he hadn't had much experience with men's bodies. James Sholto was the only man he ever had a relationship with, and a short one at that, so male intimacy was still new to him. Or at least, not as familiar as intimacy with women. It was no surprise, then, that Sherlock had left such an impression. He had fallen head over heels with him immediately — and outright. His brain, his heart, his body… he adored every tiny part of him. Everything that made him who he was.
"Well, I am. So I'll be for two."
“To what?”
, to lecture me about substance abuse, thank you very much."
"Thank you."
An indulgent smile on his lips, he staggered up the last flight of stairs and stopped by the main door — the one that overlooked the living room — juggling with his bags to turn the handle and push it open.
For a moment, it seemed as if they had gone back in time, when everything was simple – when they would chortle like kids on crime scenes, play board games on rainy Sundays (just
, John thought, despite his lack of appetite. Rubbing his neck, he dragged himself to the fridge and opened it.
John frowned and looked down at the two cups which had been waiting on the table, full and ready, for the past ten minutes – which incidentally had seemed like an hour.
“Well…” Sherlock panted, the ghost of a smirk at the corner of his mouth, “I believe we can safely say that… this was a successful experiment…”
"Please, say something."
“God, John…”
"Well…" John got to his feet and slowly moved to Sherlock's side, fingers brushing against his curly hair before sitting down next to him with a small grunt. "… there's a first time for everything."
A short and jerky laugh escaped the detective's lips. “Inspector John Watson… Scotland Yard's… finest sleuth…”
It took John a handful of seconds to realise that Sherlock had spoken, and when the words fell into place, a rush of adrenaline flowed through him. He didn't hear that right. He couldn't have.
But don't sting me
John beamed back at him. “You. Us.”
The sensation of Sherlock's mouth squeezing against his made him shudder anew, even more so when it opened to his and began to work up and down, following John's lead. His senses tingling, John grabbed Sherlock's lapel to pull him closer, his other hand losing its way into the smooth curls. As he did, Sherlock stepped into him and took hold of his waist, thumbs stroking his ribs through the fabric of his shirt.
"Why did it end?"
sounds as part of the song. With a grin, John craned his head around the frame and shot a glance inside.
“Mmm, suspected as much.”
They stood gazing and grinning at each other for a few beats, then John closed the distance between them, cupping Sherlock's nape to plant a kiss on the corner of his lips. He lingered there with his eyes shut, savouring the warm and soft feeling of Sherlock's mouth that he had longed to recapture since he first got a taste of it, the renewed touch short enough to make his heart flutter, but long enough to revive the fire inside him.
A healthy grown up busy busy bee
Sherlock had taken off his coat and was holding Rosie in his arms, rocking her in rhythm with his back to the door. The moonlight seeping through the curtains gave his lean figure an ethereal glow, the bouncy locks of his hair a deep blue in the semi-darkness. As he moved around the room – and on to the next verse of the song – John got a glimpse of Rosie. She was on her way back to sleep, eyes half-closed, her heavy lids flying open every now and then to keep listening to Sherlock. She really liked that song. And its singer.
John felt his heart sink. "What?... Kiss?..."
"Fine. Once and for all: I was never in love with her, she was never in love with me, it was just a game, we played, she lost. End of story."
“Lie down,” he whispered to his ear, nibbling at his earlobe.
“FUCK!...”
Sherlock's grin turned into a gentle smile and he gave a long, almost solemn nod. "You're welcome."
Flying round the garden sweetest ever seen
"No, no. I know what you're going to say and I don't need you,
John eyed the piece of lingerie once more, feeling a twitch in his pants as he imagined his palm and fingers against that lovely bulge. “I— Yes, a lot…” he breathed out, running an eager tongue over his drying lips.
“I will,” Sherlock cut in. “I do. I do want you to.”
Stinging all the cows upon the parson's nose
Sherlock stared at him in indulgent disbelief. "Seriously?"
But his
John gave a quiet laugh and stepped back out of the nursery into the hallway, followed by Sherlock who pulled the door behind him. John glanced up from his shoes at him, sharing another chuckle, then averted his eyes. The cheerfulness of the previous minute had shifted into an awkward silence, and John suddenly felt very uncomfortable. He knew they would have to talk about what had happened earlier, and the very idea petrified him.
