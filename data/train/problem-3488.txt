Slowly, Cas says, “I think so. They were both recent arrivals. Alone and friendless. No one would have missed them for a while.” The words hit a little too close to home, sending an unpleasant shiver down his spine.
They come to rest side by side, and Dean reaches out, running the backs of his fingers along Cas' lightly stubbled cheek.
“Jimmy, be careful out there! Don’t touch anything,” Cas calls over his shoulder. Turning back to Dean, he says, “He has an amazing capacity for endangering himself. What six-year-old has broken a leg twice?”
After an hour has passed, or maybe ten minutes, Dean sits down and takes out his phone. He doesn’t realize whose number he’s dialed until a gruff, sleepy voice sounds in his ear.
Dean nods, that fierce, determined glint in his eyes again, and gets up, pulling Castiel along to the bedroom. Castiel never bothered to put his clothes back on, so there’s nothing to do but pull down Dean’s boxer briefs before they fall into bed together.
A moment ago, Dean was sweating, but now, he abruptly goes cold, a numbness like frostbite starting at his center and spreading outwards. Next to him, Cas doesn’t move an inch. “When time is up, what?”
Cas’ lips twitch in the smallest possible approximation of a smile. “Of course, Dean.”
“Hey, Cas?”
? ‘Sam’s wife stands on the porch steps, watching as her husband plays happily with little Dean.’”
is interested in. He should make sure they communicate clearly about each other’s expectations before anything else happens. Instead, he says, “I am. Interested.”
Dean’s mouth opens, closes, opens again. Cas
Meg chuckles darkly at that. “You’re alright, Clarence,” she calls over her shoulder as she starts walking away, presumably back to the kitchen.
As a last-ditch effort, Dean decided to invite Cas over to his place one night for drinks. But after the aborted kiss, things turned awkward fast, and they settled back into their respective corners. If anything, Cas dialed up the sarcasm and general mockery of the show's scripts and production values. Sniping at each other became their default setting.
“Yup. I’d asked you to come by. I’d read your first book, and I was a big fan. I really loved how it was a story with a hero and a heroine who were best friends and went on adventures together, but there was never any romance between them. It was unusual, you know? Different. When I figured out you were local, I got in touch with Balthazar and asked if you’d be willing to do a signing.”
Castiel arches a single eyebrow at him, and Dean chuckles. “Sorry,” he mumbles around another bite of burger, not sounding sorry at all. “Guess it was
Sam’s hand lands on Dean’s arm, clamping tight with obvious excitement. “Hang on. You’re saying that someone could go after him. Maybe bring him back?”
On the anniversary of his and Claire’s arrival in Lebanon, Castiel wakes to two children jumping on him.
“Fine,” Cas says, putting in a supreme effort to keep the corners of his mouth from curving up.
But even as Cas comes and goes, one thing remains. It begins small and precious, unfurling in the quiet spaces of the night where no one can see. With time, it grows steadily, until every one of my gleaming metal fixtures aches with it. I hold it close and examine it. It feels like our love for Sam, and yet it doesn’t. It feels fearful and hopeful all at the same time.
The song ends then, and Dean thinks about putting on something else, maybe something a bit slower that they could dance to. But then Cas looks up at him with those gorgeous eyes of his and asks, “Kiss me again?” and all thoughts of leaving the couch fly right out of Dean’s head.
Castiel wipes his palm on his pants to get rid of the coating of flour before he shakes Dean's hand. He might be annoyed, but he’s not
“It certainly is.”
When the spots are gone, Dean realizes that the BMW’s roof is badly dented, but it’s come to a stop right side up. Good. That should make it easier to get out.
Dean opens the door almost at once, surprise written on his face. “Cas, what…”
, Dean. We’re just friends.”
“Yeah yeah,” Dean grumbles, pretending to be annoyed even as he still feels like smiling. He hides his expression by ducking his head and focusing on bagging the burgers he’s assembled.
There’s a shadow in the corner, watching. Waiting.
Dean’s refusal to believe his brother is really back starts to crumble when he follows Cas into yet another storage room, only to find Sam at a desk, poring over a pile of leather-bound books.
“It’s definitely an experience,” Cas says, returning the grin.
Not that Dean would, of course. He’s leaving in three days, and he needs
No, that’s no good. He’s surrounded by uniforms, and he’s got about ten different IDs in his wallet that say he is, in fact, Dean Winchester. So he nods.
“We wouldn’t miss it,” Castiel says, lifting his hand in an awkward wave. Dean returns it, a small smile on his face.
Gabriel shrugs, unconcerned. “Fine. You ever change your mind, you know where to find me.”
Castiel’s face pulls into a pained grimace. “I can’t. I’m sorry, Gabriel. I can’t even promise I’ll pay you back.”
a thought Dean’s pretty sure he’s never had about anyone’s hair, ever, including his own.
Dean forces himself to breathe. Nice and slow. Keep it together. Don’t get angry.
Dean widens his grin until it hurts. “Just visiting a friend for a couple days.”
“Well, so, here’s the tricky part.” Charlie lowers her voice further, until she’s almost whispering into the receiver. “I shouldn’t be telling you this. In fact, if my boss figures out I called you, I’d probably lose my job.”
Pretty soon, Dean became Bobby and Crowley’s go-to driver. He doesn’t like to talk about it, in case he jinxes his lucky streak, but in two years of doing this, he’s never been caught yet.
Dean crosses the room to sit next to him without a thought.
With an uncanny sense of déjà vu, Dean locks the front door behind him and once again feels a little awkward when he sees Cas standing about six feet away, still in his coat.
Luckily, Gabe is better at those, because he pulls Cas down into the space between the coupe and the car next to it, out of sight of the newcomers. The attendant is frozen, still holding the fuel nozzle. The poker players have shot out of their seats, hands in the air.
It was around the time they figured out Croatoan was going to devastate everything around them, and they couldn’t stop it. At that point, it seemed stupid to cling to his old hang-ups about being with guys openly, especially with a guy like Cas, who wouldn’t be fooled by any of the walls he was used to putting up before he let anyone into his bed.
The bubbles explode, one by one, in agonizing slow motion, when Dean raises his free hand to Castiel’s hip, stroking a gentle finger across the jut of bone there.
“I’m fine, Cas, but…” Silence for a beat or two, then Dean’s voice again, sounding even shakier than before. “It’s Meg, Cas. She…”
“And I was clean,” Other Cas mumbles, almost like he’s embarrassed. “No withdrawal either.”
“I thought—” he begins.
“Uh... hey, Cas.”
“God, Dean, I’m close, I—” Cas grits out, voice impossibly deeper than Dean’s ever heard it, and then he feels the warm wetness of come spill onto his hand and chest. It should be off-putting, but it only makes him move harder, faster, down into the tunnel of Cas’ hand, until, with a shout, he spills between them.
, Castiel thinks, and as he does, Dean’s expression brightens briefly, one side of his mouth quirking up.
“Don’t.” Sam’s tone of voice brooks no argument, and Dean wonders distantly whether it’s the one he uses in the courtroom. If so, it’s probably damn effective. “You made sure I got to grow up and have a good life. If there’s anything I can do to help you keep yours, I’m doing it.”
“Heya, Cas!” Charlie calls as she strolls back to the cash register from where she was helping a customer find something in the non-fiction section. “Are we gonna see you at trivia night tonight? You owe me a rematch, you know.”
She found it one day, while she was out window-shopping in Easterbridge — just blowing down the sidewalk in a plain white envelope. The envelope carried no address, the only indication of its intended recipient being a blocky scrawl of three letters: “CAS”.
Cas tilts his head and frowns at the painting, like he’s not entirely sure what he’s seeing, and Dean almost regrets making him come along to this. Almost, but not quite. He could really use a friendly face right now.
“That makes no fucking sense, Cas.”
Dean was really, really going to avoid messing with Cas today, but it’s just too damn tempting.
“Will you
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Don’t know why Sam bothers putting out a newspaper, honestly.”
Somehow, between kisses, they coat each other’s hands with lube. It should feel awkward and messy: something they need to get through before the good part starts. But it’s almost worshipful, the way Cas cradles Dean’s hand, the way he touches their fingers together, trading body heat and soft, slippery liquid.
“You know she did. Well? Which one do I pick?”
Castiel can’t help it; he snorts. “A player.”
Charlie says, sounding confident.
Dean’s head shoots up with the unexpectedness of that statement, and he immediately regrets it. “What for?” he manages to grit out past the pounding in his head.
More than anything, Dean wants to see that tension melt out of Cas, so he reaches out for Cas’ hand where it’s curled into a fist atop his thigh. “Me too, Cas. And I… I don’t have that much experience with guys either, so we’re in the same boat here.”
“Thanks, Benny. Sorry,” he says, a little flustered, as he shovels the patties onto the plate set aside for them.
“Dean,” Cas gasps, breaths coming fast and shallow against Dean’s mouth, his jaw, his ear. “Can I—“
Dean shakes his head and waves a hand at Castiel, a silent request for the bottle. Castiel slides it over. “One of the first hunts I ever worked with my dad, we were cleaning out a vamp nest. Was supposed to be an easy job, and all I had to do was stay with the victim who was still alive, while Dad killed the stragglers.” Dean takes a drink, and he sounds a little steadier when he says, “Turns out there was one that got past him. Dad gave me a machete, just in case, but I froze. Just watched as that vamp walked right out the back door.”
So, sure, Dean’s weapons are a strategic asset, but they’re not exactly dignified.
Swaying and dithering, the couple mills around the narrow aisles for a few more minutes, then heads back into the night without buying anything.
Cas’ eyes blaze, but he doesn’t look angry or disappointed. He looks determined; like he’s about to go into battle. “Yes, you can, and I’m going to prove it to you.”
The guard’s voice is shaking. His eyes and gun are fixed on Dean and Cas where they’re squatting on the floor. He hasn’t spotted Sam.
“The fuckin’ nerve of that—” Bobby starts, but Dean doesn’t let him finish. He stalks back to the office, trying his best to have his face composed by the time he opens the door.
Uneasy again, and also in need of caffeine, Castiel heads to the inn to begin that day’s shift at the front desk. He spends some time hanging out with Meg in the kitchen, and Mildred keeps him company for a while too, but he can barely bring himself to focus on the conversations. When Balthazar comes in to take over for Castiel, his usually distracting banter is no more than background noise to Castiel’s growing anxiety.
Dean’s face lights up at the question, and he launches into a clearly well-worn speech about his brother’s small-town law practice, his wife Eileen, and the two young children Dean got to see one time when he had a touring engagement in the area.
“That’s different,” Dean says, eyes narrowing. “That was just the two of us, and I was trying to make you laugh.”
Cas runs his fingers through his hair in a futile attempt at getting it to lie flat. “We’ll wait here for you if you like. Do you need a ride home?”
“We expected you to stick with Crowley and stay out of trouble. By the time Nick was going to become a real issue, we figured we’d have the investigation all wrapped up.” She leans back in her chair and gives Dean an assessing look. “What we didn’t expect was for you to upset the apple cart by working a job for Nick. Especially as a favor to someone who, as far as I could tell, you’d never had contact with before.”
“Yeah, if they can ever stop fighting,” Dean says, bumping his shoulder against Cas’.
Before he can adjust the temperature of the water to a comfortable level, Dean takes hold of his hips and reverses their positions, crowding Castiel up against the tile wall, hands roaming up and down his bare chest. Castiel pushes off the wall just far enough to shrug his shirt the rest of the way off.
“Yeah, sure, man. Whatever you need. I’ll give her a call to let her know you guys are coming. She takes walk-ins, so it shouldn’t be a problem.” The sound of a pen scratching against paper. “You want me to come too?”
“Oh. You want me to put some ice in for you?” Gabriel asks, already half off the couch again to do just that.
Garth gets up, and he and Dean both step forward to shake hands. “A pleasure,” Ketch says, warmly. He seems to be British as well, and even Dean knows enough to recognize his accent as a much more sophisticated one than Mick’s.
Cas snorts, shaking his head in amused disbelief as he starts walking back to the house. Dean opens the trunk and pulls out a flask. Without knowing exactly why, he picks up another and puts it in the inside pocket of his suit jacket.
“Hey, jerk.”
His first thought is that he’s somehow landed himself in jail, because the place is small and plain, and there are no windows.
And yet, he doesn’t have a single memory of his own husband.
Mildred casts a somewhat wistful glance at Castiel. “He’ll leave us soon enough for greener pastures. He won’t want to be manning my modest little front desk forever. Not with a degree in accounting.”
A perimeter has been set up at a distance of about two hundred feet and the road is closed to traffic in both directions, barricades manned by LAPD officers. Dean’s nerves ratchet up at the sight, but there’s no way he can leave. Not until he knows.
Yet, there’s a definite chill in the air as he makes the trek from the Brain’s office to the BAMF Café. Once again, Cas is extremely grateful for his coat.
Missouri nods, breathing in the fragrant steam from her mug with a rapturous expression. “You make good coffee.”
“God. It
“Oh, stop dragging Sam into this. He’s not the one sulking.”
“Not to be a stick-in-the-mud,” Cas says, completely ignoring Dean’s immediate snort, “but what does that have to do with the show?”
Dean tries to pedal and get the bike back on track, but right as Castiel draws level with him, it starts to tip over. Lightning-quick, Castiel darts forward and wraps his arms around Dean’s middle to steady him, but Dean is so startled by this that he lets go of the handlebars. Castiel has just enough time to regret his choices before the two of them go down together, tangled up with the bike. His breath is knocked out of him as he hits the ground.
Cas winces in acknowledgement of Gabe’s point. “Fine. Tomorrow, we’ll start paying down each of those accounts.”
They’ve reached the stretch now where the grade looks manageable. Dean tries to picture himself back on the movie set, strapped into his racing belt and containment seat, the assistant director lowering his arm to give him the go-ahead.
hot chocolate.”
“That’s fucking ridiculous.” He shuffles through the pages, looking for something. “And what about
As Castiel’s anger grows, so does his recklessness. “He came here as a result of an old woman’s malice. He’s not yours to keep.” He steps forward, squaring his shoulders. He’s perfectly aware that he’ll come off worse in a fight, but this is no time for self-preservation.
When Gordon was sentenced to life in prison, Missouri was grateful she had never told him about the child.
Cas is so close that Dean can track the last little flash of hesitation as it travels across his face and dissipates, forgotten in the press of warm, soft lips and the slide of long, graceful fingers across the back of Dean’s neck.
Eileen looks uncertainly at the group assembled in her dining room, probably trying to decide whether she should offer a round of drinks or get in her car and never stop driving.
Foreboding heavy in his stomach, Dean inches the Impala down Silver Lake Boulevard. Even from a distance, he can see that Singer’s Custom Kings is ablaze, flames infecting the darkness above with angry red.
Cas shakes his head, soft eyes still fixed on the view. “Let’s just drive.”
Dean elbows him, looking delighted. “Nice one, Cas.”
“Well, Dean-o, I guess I should be thanking you,” Meg says suddenly, voice tight with forced cheer. “You know, for taking care of my boys.”
“Good morning, dear. I trust you’ll forgive the early interruption,” she says briskly. “I have good news and bad news.”
Dean’s voice is beautiful — deep, soft and heavy with feeling. Castiel vaguely recognizes the tune as an Ella Fitzgerald song, but he has a hard time believing that he would enjoy any other rendition as much as this one.
Dean explains the details of his plan, and they spend a few hours talking over the possibilities. By the time they finish, it’s almost eleven, and when Charlie ignores several pointed yawns from Dean, he grabs her bag and starts pushing her gently in the direction of the front door.
“Thanks, bitch,” Dean says and clears his throat, trying to disguise the slight quaver in his voice.
picked, for myself. And I want you to be my person for the rest of our lives if… if you’ll have me.”
The clock on the oven panel turns from eleven fifty-nine to midnight, and Castiel falls forward as his arms wrap around an empty space.
James still had his old cell phone number. Missouri called it that day, frantic, begging her son not to leave the house.
“So do that,” Gabriel says, stabbing Castiel’s chest with his finger. Somewhat resentfully, Castiel rubs at the sore spot. People seem to enjoy prodding at him today.
“Missed you so much,” Dean hears himself whisper over the white noise in his ears. “Missed feeling you like this.”
“Well, that’s not suspicious at all,” Dean whispers, clutching his water guns tighter. They feel even more flimsy than before.
“Man,” Dean says, stretching happily in his folding chair next to the craft table. “Aren’t you glad they didn’t want us to play ourselves? With decent actors, this show might actually work.”
“Ehh.” Donatello wags his head dubiously. “Too small to be truly useful.” He turns to Dean. “And you?”
“I still might not,” Castiel reminds him, wiggling his empty tumbler at Gabriel in a silent request for more. Gabriel obliges, refreshing both their drinks. This time, he adds ice to Castiel’s.
Hesitantly, he begins to speak.
Thankfully, Cas answers Dean’s fumbling with a reassuring smile. “It’s fine, Dean.”
They lie like that for a minute before Cas clears his throat. “Last night. Was… that OK?”
Dean breathes a sigh of relief.
how few movies you’ve seen.” Charlie rolls her eyes so emphatically, she almost drops her popcorn bag. “Anyway,” she says, clutching her treasure more tightly and leaning forward to look at Dean, “When I found out, I told him he was coming along to see one of the finest achievements in filmmaking ever, and that was that.”
The next afternoon, as Dean rings up a customer, her face swims and distorts in front of him, until all he can see is gaping blackness where her eyes ought to be. He manages to hold it together, but just barely.
Jimmy looks up at Castiel, considering, then gives a sharp nod of approval. “Good. I like him.”
,” he says again, with feeling, drawing up his knees so as to occupy as little space as possible on the bed.
Except that night, he wakes up coughing, like he’s gotten something stuck in his throat, and he can’t stop thinking that he might have swallowed the damn fly after all.
“I was,” Other Sam says, reaching up to push some of his hair behind his ear. It’s the same nervous tic Dean’s seen on his own Sam a thousand times. “But when I woke up here, Lucifer was just... gone.”
“Guess so,” Dean shrugs. Downplaying his own accomplishments, especially around Sam, is a habit he’s too old to shed now. “Maybe if I get promoted, I’ll join you and Eileen in that sweet suburban life.”
“What’s up with the size of this thing? Don’t these people get hungry?” Dean frowns unhappily at the tiny pastry cage on his plate. It’s filled with the barest whisper of lox and a dab of horseradish. “Even at the place in DC where I used to work, we served bigger portions than
“It’s interesting, you know?” Charlie muses, tossing the chip bag into the trash bin behind the store counter with unerring precision. “Sam had me doing all this research into that Sergei guy. Found some awfully interesting things when I tried to pick up his trail on the dark web.”
“If this is too nosy, stop me, but…” Dean clears his throat.
Back during the 2008 Olympics, Dean used to see that place on TV all the time, and he’s pretty sure it was where they held the swim competitions. He and Cas spent most of a month glued to Olympics coverage that summer, watching everything from synchronized swimming to volleyball.
“Flattery won’t help you improve, Winchester,” Donatello says, as usual refusing to engage with Dean’s deflection strategies. It’s one of the things Dean actually kind of likes about the guy, even if he can be fucking scary when his goat’s up. “You know I like your work. Wouldn’t have hired you if I didn’t. But you want to know why there’s red all over this piece of paper?” He holds it up to show Dean what he already knows.
As they walk from the dorm to the indoor arena that’s serving as the venue for the ball, Castiel is still distracted, to the point where Max asks if everything’s okay. Castiel nods and silently resolves to do better for the rest of the night.
He means to say,
Dean admitted that could be true, but deep down, he doesn’t think it is. In fact, he’d bet almost anything that Cas remembers him too, and that the two of them never would’ve lost touch if Dad hadn’t fucked it all up when Dean was sixteen.
A helpless, half-hysterical laugh bubbles up Dean’s throat. “That’s actually the first thing you ever said to me.”
“Let me phrase it this way,” Mildred says, eyes narrowing. “I want you to come inside with me, because there’s something I’d like to show you. Something I think might belong to you. If I’m wrong, I’ll give you an item of your choice from my inventory, completely free of charge.”
A world-weary sigh sounds over the line. “Castiel, if this is all a tantrum about last night—”
And yet, he kisses Cas, because how could he not? Cas is
“Silenzio, Bruno!” Cas and Amara answer in unison, and Dean likes the way Cas’ eyes light up when he laughs.
Less than a minute later, Cas pulls up next to Dean. He gets out of the car, and there’s a soft, happy shine to his eyes. “Dean,” he says. “This place is beautiful.”
?” Cas demands, his voice all irresistible anger and steely command. Any other time, a pleasant shiver would be running up Dean’s spine. “I am quite literally two seconds away from hitting that call button.”
By the time Dean gets to the end of the access road that leads to his house and parks in the gravel lot, his dick has finally calmed down. (His heart, not so much.) He darts out of the car and makes a beeline for the outdoor switch that turns on the fairy lights all around his yard. He flips it and the lights come on, bathing the dark house in a warm, gentle glow.
shit?
“It feels good, too,” Castiel says quietly, trying not to disturb the kids, who have both nodded off in the backseat. “I’m glad Claire and I are staying in town.”
As Castiel walks, he pulls his phone out of his back pocket. Blinking to clear the blurriness from his vision, he scrolls through his contacts. He presses ‘enter’ and puts the phone to his ear, waiting for Anna’s voice to come down the line.
“I love you, Cas,” he says, the shape of his own mouth foreign around the words.
When she gets to the part about getting jumped by the shifter — carefully leaving out that she was three shots of whiskey deep — John hums in the way that means he knows there’s more to the story.
Charlie’s eyes light up with what can only be called excitement. “God, that explains so much.”
“But naturally, in due course,” Donatello says, with the air of someone delivering the winning argument, “they split up. And it was an unmitigated disaster for the town.”
Luckily, he has ways of distracting himself from Naomi’s looming visit. There’s Claire, of course, and Castiel’s first parent-teacher night at Lebanon Elementary, which goes exceedingly well. Claire's teacher, Bess, describes her as a student who is boisterous, but tremendously intelligent and with a very active imagination. The conversation leaves Castiel glad that he didn’t force Claire to stay at Edlund, with its regimented routines and shortage of opportunities for active play.
“I can handle myself a hell of a lot better than either of you two,” Jo says easily. With a pointed grin at Dean, she adds, “Especially you, pretty boy.”
In a few minutes, when Dean comes down the stairs, Castiel will tell him he loves him, and Dean will say it back and kiss his forehead. They’ll eat their breakfast together, and Dean will complain that Castiel didn’t use enough pepper, and they’ll intertwine their feet under the table.
A tall, skinny man with a big grin to match Dean’s shuffles up to Castiel’s other side. “This is the third time the statue’s turned up someplace around town. Donatello keeps getting rid of it, and it keeps showing up again,” he says. “It’s quite the mystery.” The man holds out his hand to shake. “Garth’s the name. Are you new in town?”
don’t like
“Fair, and completely pointless,” Garth says and, well, he isn’t wrong, but Castiel is not about to admit that out loud. Not when Dean is practically lit up with glee at the front of the room, thoroughly enjoying the commotion.
“I found us a hunt.” Sam lowers the laptop hesitantly back onto the outline of Russia. “A series of drownings in Jackson, Wyoming. None of the victims were anywhere near water at the time.” Sam shrugs, the corners of his lips pulling up in a half-hearted attempt at a smile. “If this is our life now, we might as well do something with it.”
“Hair of the dog,” Castiel mumbles into his forearm.
Frowning, Cas looks up from tucking a pair of socks into a corner of the yellow suitcase; the one Dean told him to get when they went shopping together a couple of weeks ago. Because nobody else has a yellow suitcase, and Dean’s seen enough movies to know that it’s a bad idea to accidentally pick up somebody else’s suitcase at baggage claim. You might just get stuck with clothes that don’t fit, but you could also end up with heroin or evidence of an international spy plot.
The smell of disinfectant and despair trails after him as he follows the signs to the ICU. The nurse at reception directs him to the nearest waiting room, where she says someone will be with him shortly. It becomes clear pretty damn quickly that Dean’s definition of “shortly” is very different from hers.
He feels Cas’ eyes on him all the way to the kitchen and back. Once he’s set down both their tumblers on the coffee table, he settles a little closer to Cas on the couch than before. Still not close enough to touch, but close enough that he can almost feel the heat radiating off him.
Something jagged opens in Castiel’s chest, stealing his breath, but he forces it down for now. “I still don’t understand. Last night, we were fine. What happened?”
Dean’s head snaps up and he locks eyes with Sam, who looks as wrong-footed as Dean feels. Jo is alive?
Dean watches the road in front of him narrow to two lanes, winding up into the hills as they approach the edge of the forest. There’s a gravel shoulder here, but no metal barrier. The downhill grade to their right is steep, but there’s a stretch just ahead where it evens out.
Castiel continued to work at the Gas-n-Sip. Every once in a while, he questioned Meg about her source of income, her occasional injuries, or the gun he found in her nightstand. But she never relented, and he reminded himself that, on his Gas-n-Sip wages alone, they would have to choose between diapers for Jimmy and three square meals.
Something slots into place inside Castiel when Dean sighs against his lips and grips him by the hips to pull him closer. Castiel's worry, his doubt and the ever-present ache of feeling broken — all of it grows dimmer, until the only thing that matters is the warmth of Dean’s hand, bleeding through Castiel’s shirt, and the taste of his mouth — half marinara sauce, half ineffable taste of home and comfort.
“Sure, why not. Never was much of a fan of curses anyway,” he muses. “I like to come by my souls honestly.” He smiles with all the wickedness of the infernal creature he is. “What’s my line?”
Claire giggled, and Castiel kissed her cheek. At that point, however, his phone buzzed with an incoming email related to an important project deadline.
“I think I kinda like not knowing. And I’m happy to go wherever.”
A haze of red splatters one side of the Camry’s windshield.
“Well, fuck,” Dean mumbles, not exactly enjoying the idea of having to look through every single one of them until they find the one that belonged to Amy Richards.
With a small, involuntary exhale, Dean leans forward.
When they finally break apart, Dean puts a hand on each of Sam’s shoulders and meets his brother’s bloodshot eyes.
Mick’s hand is cool in Dean’s palm, and Dean bites his tongue to keep from commenting on the weirdness of the “live-in” part. He was pretty sure the idea of “live-in” employees died with the 19th century. Then again, rich people are weird.
Dean sighs. “Garth? Undo my knots, will ya?”
They’re just settling down to enjoy tonight’s movie of choice —
Most of the threads cover pretty inane stuff —
As Castiel tiptoes away from Claire’s bedroom, he thinks of everything he’ll never even know he missed, and it’s suddenly hard to breathe.
Fear and anger swirl in Dean’s gut, fighting for the upper hand. Anger wins out, steadying his voice. “Who the fuck are you? What have you done with my brother?”
He never meant for his and Claire’s lives to turn out this way. When Amelia was alive, they lived in a small, cheerful house in the suburbs. It was as far from Novak ostentatiousness as it was possible to get, but that was a big part of the appeal. Castiel was already working at Novak Industries by that time, and being able to retreat to a different, kinder environment at the end of the day felt like a breath of fresh air.
He shakes his head, trying to clear it.
When the call disconnects, Dean’s eyes refocus on the open duffel that sits on the mildew-stained bedspread next to him. He hasn’t counted the mess of bills inside, but at a guess, the amount is in the tens of thousands. Maybe hundreds. Either way, it’s probably worth more than the entire motel where Dean finds himself: a seedy by-the-hour place on the edge of the city.
“I wanted to. I didn’t think you’d believe me. And maybe I thought you were better off not knowing.”
Dean shakes his head in defeat and, determined to get out of this conversation, looks at the view outside the tall arch window next to their table.
A young woman with wavy blonde hair sitting straight across the circle from Dean speaks up, arms crossed over her chest. “Everybody knows relationships are a lot less likely to last if you’re not soulmates.”
The crowd descends into chaos with staggering speed, people screaming and flailing and jostling each other to find an exit not barred by a guy in uniform. Cas feels Gabe’s elbow nudge him. “The fire stairs! C’mon.”
“I can see that.” Dean huffs a small chuckle before his eyes flick away from the screen, down to his feet. “Cas, why did you fly over there?”
Dean squirms, and Castiel could swear his cheeks have turned a little pink, but he mutters, “It’s no big deal. Shit’s pretty simple once you get the basics down. I don’t need a stupid textbook making it complicated as all hell.”
“Not too busy,” Castiel says, his cheeks actually starting to hurt with the force of his grin. He probably looks like a teenager talking to his crush, but he is so far past caring. “Do you want to help me buy a new car later?”
The door opens and Betty sweeps in, flinging herself dramatically onto his couch.
Something cold wraps around Castiel’s heart. “What?”
Castiel isn’t sure where he expected this conversation to go, but that certainly wasn’t it. “A little, I suppose. I know that they had something of a strained relationship, related in part to, uh…”
“You will,” Gabriel says, seamlessly picking up the thread of their conversation.
The only light in the room is a small bedside lamp, but it’s definitely enough for a good view, and Dean very much appreciates that fact as he takes in the sight before him. Cas’ skin is a little more tanned than Dean’s, and his midsection is a little slimmer. His limbs are lean but muscular, with strong thighs that suggest a running habit. His cock is thick and blood-flushed, curving slightly upwards. Dean licks his lips at the sight and realizes he can’t wait another second to get his hands on it.
His eyes dart to Dean’s, shy in a way Dean hasn’t really seen Cas before.
“Rumors? What rumors?” Cas asks sharply, sitting up.
Dean says, holding up a pedantic finger.
Dean flicks the switch, and the ceiling lamp flares to life. Grumbling, Cas flops face-first onto his pillow to shield his eyes. Dean chuckles, and Cas, more annoyed than ever, squints sideways at him. “Can I help you?”
“No, but—”
After they performed the spell, Billie assured them it had worked, but now they were seeing the proof with their own eyes.
Cas worries at his bottom lip with his teeth. “He didn’t cast a reflection in my mirror.”
The line rings once, twice, three times. After six rings, the machine picks up, and a gruff voice sounds in Dean’s ear.
Castiel nods, relieved. “Start over.” He takes another step closer, until they’re pressed together, skin to skin. Dean’s erection has flagged a little while they were talking, and so has Castiel’s own, but the air is warm and steamy around them and Dean is beautiful. Somehow, Castiel doesn’t think it will take much to get the mood back.
“I could probably try to strip the old clunker for parts at least,” Bobby says, squinting doubtfully at the Continental where it’s still sitting on the bed of the tow truck, in the yard of his garage. “But you ran her down pretty good. Might be best just to take her to the scrap yard.”
Dean looks at him as though he’s grown a second head. “Why sing in the shower or draw on your brother with permanent marker while he’s asleep? Because it’s fun!”
Something snags at Dean’s memory. “Like the names and locations of Crowley’s… hypothetical employees?”
There’s an audible intake of breath; an interesting reaction, considering Cas doesn’t technically need to breathe. “Was that the time you said you couldn’t finish your slice because you were feeling ill, and then you wouldn’t even let me try to diagnose you?”
Missouri gives Dean a flat look, like she’s starting to seriously doubt his mental capacity. “I don’t know what you mean by that, but if your question is, do I think Gordon Walker was possessed by a demon before his death, the answer is yes.”
“I’ve already met Charlie.”
“Hello, Dean. How was work?”
“My hope is that when the demon realizes you’ve protected yourself, it will lose interest in using you as a vessel,” Missouri says as she carefully places her supplies back in the gym bag.
The next morning is Saturday, and the weather is nice, so Claire and Castiel decide to walk to the diner for breakfast.
“How, Sam? You’re a public defender. You have tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. You’re not any more credit-worthy than I am.”
“So I had lunch with Sam, and I kinda… told him what’s going on with you.”
As Castiel uses the empty paper bag to wrap up what’s left of the ciabatta loaf for Aunt Amara, he thinks that maybe having a
Slowly, glancing back and forth between Dean and Cas, Sam crouches down and lowers his Taurus. Dean’s jaw slackens a little when Sam kicks the gun to Cas, unprompted, but he snaps it shut with an audible click. Lucifer doesn’t need guns. He can pulverize them both with a snap of his fingers.
“You wanted a paycheck. There’s a paycheck in Urbana,” Gabe says evenly as he approaches the attendant’s desk.
“Dean? Dean!”
Shit. Boyle is the next cross street. Dean can feel two pairs of eyes on him from the back seat, hear the loud, tense breathing. He switches off the car’s headlights and pulls up to the right-hand curb, close behind an eighteen-wheeler parked for the night.
Castiel’s brain grinds to a screeching halt. “The grace of… you’re saying angels are real?”
“I think we could make that happen,” Dean whispers, punctuating his words with a teasing brush of lips along Cas’ jawline. “First, though, can we have sex?”
He stabs his finger at the paper, emphatically.
he left. “You guys were still pretty new, but in spite of all the bad shit going down at the time, you seemed… happy. Don’t know that I’d ever seen you smile as much as you did around him.”
Impossibly, Gabe’s grin widens. “I think I’ll stop by yours instead,” he says, and scrambles up the ladder. Cas follows right on his brother’s heels, hoping to minimize his chances of further embarrassment in front of Dean. He’s barely reached his bunk and folded himself awkwardly near the bottom of the bed when the curtains open yet again and a woman with bobbed red hair looks in. “Evening, gents!” she whisper-shouts. “Having a party? Can I join?”
He watches as the little typing bubble appears, disappears, reappears. In the end, all he gets is a little smiley-face emoji. Dean smiles back at it, then starts Baby’s engine.
Castiel runs a hand through his daughter’s nest of blonde hair, the only part of her head that’s currently visible. “Okay, but…” He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for the next part of this conversation. “Grandma Naomi… should we invite her to come see us again soon?”
Fuck. Well, if the guy didn’t know his name before, he certainly does now.
Cas smiles, ruffling Jimmy’s hair as he walks. “Dean does have a very cool car. But it would be boring if everyone had the same car, don’t you think?”
“Cas?” There’s an edge of panic in Dean’s voice; his breath is coming heavy, as though he’s been running.
“Oh, it’s fine.” Claire manages to sound nonchalant while clinging to Castiel with all fours, like a sloth to a tree branch. “You guys can totally come back for another sleepover. Right, Dad?”
Castiel lets himself be manhandled back into his coat — when did he take that off? — and after a moment, he vaguely realizes that Mildred and Meg are there. They’re talking to Balthazar and hugging Castiel, but it’s all white noise.
The other Sam tries to reassure them as much as possible, offering the use of a car or two, some credit cards and a set of fake IDs. He gives them contact information for hunters across the country — people who would take them in for a while, no questions asked.
“As guaranteed by the First Amendment!” Castiel chimes in.
Sam looks up, and the bitchface he aims at Dean is another nail in the coffin of the “Lucifer is screwing with us” theory.
Dean leans forward and brushes his lips against Castiel’s; a feather-light, fleeting touch. “I always want pie, Cas,” he whispers into the negligible space between them, his breath puffing gently against Castiel’s cheek. “I’ll eat cake, sure, but I’ll always want to come back to… pie, in the end.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, settling for a stiff wave. “Writer’s block?”
In answer, Bobby slumps into the chair next to Dean’s and produces a small clamshell container from his ratty backpack. Bobby opens it to reveal a reasonably fresh-looking, chocolate-flavored cake donut. “Got ya this off the craft table before the vultures descended. Might eat it myself now.”
Somewhat resentfully, Dean rubs his stomach where it connected with Sam’s unnaturally pointy elbow. “Fuck, you startled me.”
“Yeah.”
Soon enough, it’s time to head to the inn. Naomi refuses to ride in Castiel’s truck, and her Mercedes is a two-seater, which leaves walking as the only reasonable option. Luckily, the weather is sunny and pleasant, but it does little to calm Castiel’s nerves, or to thaw the icy silence that descends every time Claire runs ahead of them on the sidewalk.
“So here’s the thing. Lucifer might be gone, but I still feel like I can hear him in my head almost all the time, you know? He was with me for years. You don’t just walk away from that.”
“Ready!” Claire shouts, and Castiel can see her flashing a delighted grin in the rearview mirror.
“Well, when you put it like that…”
Rowena looks pained, but folds her hands on the table and waits in silence until Cas comes back with a glass of ice water. She sips daintily at it a few times before she sets it back down. Condensation pearls down the side in a cold echo of the sweat soaking through the back of Dean’s shirt.
(Of course, if he wanted to go somewhere with a bar that’s bigger than a shoebox, or where half the patrons aren’t wearing hunting camos… well, that’s a different story. Dean’s got many fond memories of piling into his Baby after midnight with four other people to drive to the Waffle House in Delaware that’s open until three a.m.)
Hoping he isn’t seriously misreading what Cas is asking for, Dean says, “Sure, Cas. You can crash with me. Plenty of room at my house. Don’t even worry about it.”
Dean’s eyes fix on his, pleading, and Castiel is irresistibly reminded of that first night he remembers, when Dean begged to be let into his own home. “Promise me you’ll stop trying. Promise me you’ll sell the store to someone else and go live your life somewhere. Be happy.”
At the top of the steps, on the homey porch, stands a tall, well-groomed man with dark hair and blue eyes, hands clasped solemnly, waiting for them. His suit has the impeccable fit of something tailor-made, and the overall impression is of a more put-together (read: less attractive) version of Cas.
I soon realize that Cas is not like Sam, or Dad. He’s faith, and joy, and hope. When he leaves, as he often does, he’s desolation, and loneliness, and yearning.
“They celebrated Jack’s birthday?” Castiel croaks, the lines of his forehead settling into a furrow of confusion. “But I… it wasn’t… it’s not for another few months. I
. We used to live with her and I used to see her all the time and now I never see her and I wish she was here and—”  At this point, Claire starts sobbing again, and Castiel feels very much like joining her.
Castiel plants a soft kiss on Dean’s lips. “Do you even have to ask?”
Dean slows down as he turns left onto Broadway. If there’s helicopters in the mix, he can’t draw attention by going above the speed limit.
When he pulls out of the kiss and opens his eyes, he’s face to face with heated, hooded blue. Dean smiles and slides down Cas’ chest, leaving a trail of kisses and lingering touches as he goes.
His eyes catch on a head of dark blond hair, too familiar to be mistaken, even bent low as it is to whisper into the ear of a petite girl with lively eyes and long, wavy hair flowing down her shoulders. The girl’s lips are curled up in a wry smile as she leans in just a little, mostly keeping her distance but clearly willing to listen to what Dean has to say.
“Evening, hon,” she says as Dean walks up to her, pulling him into a back-thumping hug. “Haven’t seen you in so long, I thought you’d gone and died in a ditch.”
Garth looks back and forth between them, still smiling. “So how do y’all know each other?” he asks cheerily, in an obvious effort to break the tension.
“Dean.” The word emerges as a strangled croak. Castiel clears his throat, tries again. “Dean!”
“They sell fries in a waffle cone, Cas. Fries. In a
Dean pulls a face at her, but the effect is somewhat lost because his head is encased in his bald latex stunt mask. A few days ago, he spotted it in the back of his trunk, and an idea came to him. The car can’t be traced to him or Bobby, but he’s still paranoid about being spotted at the wheel. The mask is just another layer of insurance.
In the awkward pause that follows, Dean feels Cas tensing up next to him. He can actually sense the moment Cas makes up his mind to speak.
“I expected to be pressed into some foreign campaign,” he continues, “or perhaps offered a position as weapons instructor to no-doubt spoiled princelings. Imagine my surprise, then, when the contents of the letter revealed a request to accompany Prince Dean—”
“Do you?” Missouri frowns at him, considering. “Because what I’m telling you is that a demon knows no mercy or remorse. Pleading with it will do you no good. And once you’re possessed, you will have no control over your actions. If the demon is so inclined, it can make you kill yourself, as it did Gordon. Or, perhaps worse, it could make you hurt or kill your loved ones.”
“Piacere,” Castiel repeats, slowly, before he takes another bite of his bread. “It means ‘nice to meet you.’”
, Castiel types, and he’s surprised to find that he means it.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean pants. “Never figured you for a dirty talker.”
“Well,” Sam starts, then stops again. Dean waits, not-so-patiently. “Look, last time we talked, you mentioned your friend from way back when, Cas? And you said you wanted to find him.”
"Not sure I'm feeling that optimistic about her chances, or ours," Dean growls as he levers himself off the floor with a groan. Cas tries to cup one of his elbows for support, but Dean shakes him off. He's shown enough weakness for one night. "The shifter's killed at least two people already, and I doubt she'll come quietly if we track her down."
Dean turns to Castiel, surprise plain on his face. “You… you still wanna do that? Even after—”
With a groan, Dean goes to the kitchen to down a glass of water and some Tylenol. That good effort turns out to be wasted because he throws up all the water almost right away, but he takes a shower after and fries some bacon to soak up the remaining alcohol in his system. After that and a cup of coffee, he feels almost human.
Dean shrugs and drapes himself over the seat again, one leg up, putting the inside of his thigh on display just a little. “I sing, and I play the ukulele.”
But now, staring at Cas’ text so hard his eyes are starting to hurt, he wonders if Cas and Jimmy will even want to spend time with him like that anymore.
Dean ignores him. “Please. I know he’s a grumpy, arrogant bastard, but I was kinda hoping he could be
Once Sam finally got done shouting, everyone involved was so drunk and exhausted, they just fell into bed. In Sam’s case, the bed in his own guestroom. In Cas and Dean’s case, Cas’ sorry fucking excuse for a sleeping arrangement, barely two steps up from a camp bed.
Donatello frowns down at Sam and covers the podium’s microphone while he mutters something that Castiel can’t make out.
“Terrified,” Dean says quietly, and holds on tighter.
Attached is a picture of Charlie’s sculpture, standing in the center of the town square. It’s rather taller than usual, supported as it is by a plinth — whose sides are decorated with what looks suspiciously like bar graphs on poster board.
“Yeah. Shouldn’t have told Charlie
Even after an hour spent in darkness, sleep proves elusive, so eventually, Castiel gives it up for a lost cause and turns on the lamp next to the couch. He picks up the photo album and flips through it, studying his own face in the pictures. Most of them show him smiling a little awkwardly, like you do in posed pictures. But every time he’s pictured with Dean, he looks absolutely ecstatic, almost surprised at being allowed to share Dean’s space.
With a screech of rubber on concrete, Dean turns onto Sixth. The sound of sirens has the two thugs in the backseat glancing over their shoulders and cursing a blue streak, but Dean can’t worry about that now. He just has to get where he’s going.
“You know what you have to do, right?” Meg says. “You have to ask this M person to meet up.”
Bobby comes home from the hospital eventually, and Dean spends a good bit of his time helping him up and down stairs and in and out of his wheelchair. (Never to the bathroom, though. Dean learns his lesson about that after a single, extremely salty argument.)
What he needs is a second opinion. Unfortunately, his options are limited. Mom’s out of the question. She can barely manage to send an email, let alone give advice on navigating an online friendship. Sam is out too. He’d probably just tut at Dean for being gullible and then treat him to a lecture on catfishing.
The memory comes roaring back, however, when he wakes to find himself inside a real-life snow globe. Heavy white flakes are swirling outside his bedroom window, obscuring the view of the trees even in Castiel’s own yard. A pristine blanket of white covers every surface, including the road, which appears utterly undisturbed by such modern conveniences as snow plows.
“How long are you staying, Cas?” Jess asks, then pauses. “Is it alright if I call you Cas?”
Dean’s hand lands on his arm. “Oh no you don’t, Cas. You’re an official resident of Lebanon now. Gotta do your civic duty.”
The memory of Dean’s smile follows him all the way back to the office.
call him back later. “Whatcha want?” he mumbles in the vague direction of the speaker.
“I’m still not entirely sure why you asked me to come along,” Cas says as he slams the Impala’s passenger door. “You said yourself that you didn’t want me to ‘steal your scoop.’”
After they got the camp started, Cas tried for a while to keep Dean interested in being together. But Dean found that he couldn’t be with Cas that way anymore, not with all the formerly soft pieces of him shattered and slicing at the inside of his chest.
As they approach the square, it occurs to Castiel that they haven’t met anyone else at all on their walk. Even the square itself is completely devoid of people. It’s the morning after Thanksgiving, so some of the residents might be out of town to look for Black Friday deals at the nearest mall, but this is… unusual. There’s no one strolling along to say hello to them, and all the shops are closed, even though the clock on the church tower shows that it’s almost ten.
Dean steps forward, ignoring Garth’s shushing hand motion. “He took Cas. We need to get him back. Garth thinks you know how to do that.”
“Yes,” Cas says absently, still looking at the doorway. “I thought I saw…” He shakes his head. “Never mind. Just my imagination. Let’s go.”
He tries to tell himself that Dean’s absence has nothing to do with their relationship, and certainly isn’t any kind of reaction to their first time being intimate.
Castiel gapes at her. Apparently mistaking his surprise for an objection, Mildred adds, “Mind, I couldn’t pay you as much as I’m sure you made before, if you were able to afford that nice, shiny car outside. But as I said, it needn’t be a permanent situation. You’re free to look for other jobs in your off hours. Deal?”
“Maybe,” Dean concedes, pressing down against the scar on Cas’ palm. “But when I said ‘forever,’ I meant it. I never wanted to lose you from my life, and I was never really happy while you were gone. I know we’ve only just met each other again, and there’s things we don’t know about each other yet, but I
Buoyed by his conversations with Sam and Mom, Dean keeps it together and spends his days cooking alongside Benny just like he always does, the two of them bantering and bickering all the while.
where I can study, but she likes it, so I guess it’s okay. You’re supposed to go along with stuff that makes other people happy,” she adds, with the air of irresistible authority that only small children can muster.
And yeah, Dean might be here to talk about his feelings, but that doesn’t mean he’s up for discussing his love life — or lack of one — with a stranger. “Kind of a personal question, don’t you think? We met like five minutes ago.”
There’s a small tingle of anticipation under Castiel’s skin. No matter how many times he wakes up next to Dean, he never gets tired of seeing him first thing in the morning: sleep-rumpled, soft and affectionate.
Helplessly aroused, Dean lets his head fall forward against Cas’ shoulder and pushes closer, rutting against the back of Cas' jeans. Cas opens his mouth on a gasp of encouragement and guides Dean’s hand back down to his cock. Dean moans into the side of Cas’ neck when he feels the tip, wet and silky.
Cas looks blindsided. “Are they… are you being charged with something?”
He raises his glass and takes a cautious sip. There’s a sharpness to it that makes him shudder, and it’s weirdly dry on his tongue for something that’s supposed to be a drink. Still, he swallows it down, and as soon as he does, an easy warmth settles into his limbs, making them loose. His face feels a little hot, but not in a bad way.
“Hi,” Dean says, grinning despite the fact that they’re still in the basement of an undead menace who wants to drink their blood. The sheer relief of seeing Cas alive and apparently unharmed makes him want to be reckless, to lean in and kiss Cas until they’re both dizzy. Before he can put that excellent plan into action, Cas blinks again, and his earlier confusion is replaced by alarm. “Dean, it’s a trap. Ketch is—”
find you.”
Dr. Vallens turns to address the newcomer. “Castiel. You agree with Dean’s assessment?”
“I believe there was something we were about to do...?” he says, trailing his free hand up Dean’s side.
Garth shakes his head despondently. “Well, Donna took her food truck to a different town, and Doug was that broken up about it, he refused to make pizza ever again.”
morons.”
“I just meant… I don’t know. I’ve never seen you around the grocery store before, I guess.”
, about Dean’s other life. And considering how his relationship with Meg ended, he’s not going to take the news especially well, is he?
Dean waits, the receiver pressed to his ear, until a female voice sounds from the other end, faint and tinny. “Josie? It’s Dean.” He takes a deep breath, then says, “Listen, I just… wanted you to know that, the offer you made me? I just got a better one.” He makes sure to meet Cas’ eyes when he adds, “So I won’t be taking you up on yours.”
For some reason, Castiel is amused by the question, and cackles, which seems to encourage Dean to squeeze his shoulders. “Phi—Philo—Phils—” he tries. “Fuck it.” He waves a vague hand down the other side of Franklin Avenue. “Over there somewhere.”
Dean swallows his bite of meatloaf. Instead of spearing another one with his fork, he glares across the table at Cas. “I
?” Cas hovers over him, all righteous fury. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Castiel pushes in faster, shaking his head as he feels pressure building at the back of his eyes. “No, Dean… don’t. Don’t say that.”
Basically, he’s
Dean rolls his eyes fondly at his boyfriend.
Dean shrugs and sniffs, but doesn’t answer, watching almost warily as Castiel approaches and leans past him to close the door. Tentatively, Castiel reaches for Dean’s hand and takes the keys he’s holding, setting them aside. Then, he threads their fingers together.
Dean rubs at his dry, tired eyes and lets out a bone-deep sigh, mostly to buy time. Maybe if he reads through the description again, he’ll remember that this is a terrible idea and a waste of money.
Dean’s not sure how long they lie in bed together, trying to ignore the steady progress of sunlight through the room that marks the passage of time. Eventually, with a groan at the tacky mess between them, Cas sits up and runs a hand through his hair. “It’s almost time for me to pick up Jimmy from school.”
“Dean, I may not—” Castiel wets his lips nervously. “I may not remember you. Us. But I can tell that you’re a good person, and I feel… I feel drawn to you.”
“No.” Dean shakes his head firmly, like he can improve their odds through sheer force of will. “We
Cas cups his face, wiping at the tear tracks with a gentle, tentative thumb. “I thought you’d never ask.”
Dean watches for another moment as Cas heads for the laundry room, shoulders hunched over the unwieldy basket, worn jeans too big for his lean frame.
Heartsick, Castiel turns and follows him.
Castiel nods. He knows this about Dean’s childhood, though Dean doesn’t like to talk about it much. Still, with tempting images of undiscovered food and unfamiliar sights dancing across the screen in front of him, he can’t help asking, “But… don’t you want to travel
Dean ducks his head, looking down at his lap. “Thanks, Cas. You know, and, uh. Thanks for what you said earlier too. I… you know, my Dad was...” He breaks off with a frustrated huff. “It just means a lot when someone thinks I’m doing a good job with my kid, you know?”
As the attendant removes the fuel nozzle from the gas pump and inserts it into the coupe’s tank, the sound of screeching tires draws everyone’s attention to the open garage gate.
Castiel glares back and forth between them both. “Meg. Apologize for casting aspersions on Dean’s mashed potatoes,” he says, in a tone he hopes brooks no argument. It seems to work on Claire about eighty percent of the time. When Meg still looks mutinous, he adds, “Apologize, or I’m never inviting you to another movie night at my house.”
At a distance is very much where Cas wishes to be at the moment. His brain is great at useless facts, but not so great at dealing with stressful situations.
“Cas, if… if this is a joke, please stop?” Dean tries, tentative. Cas isn’t really the kind of person who plays jokes, especially a cruel one like this, but Dean is willing to grasp at straws at this point.
“You mean your crush,” Meg says shrewdly, her smile razor-sharp. “Well, I don’t think you need to worry on that account. He definitely likes you back, Cas. That’s what Charlie told me, and her intel on this stuff is usually solid.”
“Fine.” Castiel rises from his chair, setting it wobbling across the floor. “Fine.”
, idiot. Do it.
After that brief scare, they had a great time, jumping in the waves and building surreal, misshapen sandcastles all afternoon. A passing tourist offered to take their picture, capturing the three of them wet, exhausted, slightly sunburned and covered in sand, but beaming with joy.
Dean squares his shoulders a little, the action almost unconscious. “I’ll be fine. I can take care of myself.”
Thrilled with the pilot, the streaming service offered a contract to produce a full season. It took a little negotiating, but Dean and Cas’ new superiors eventually agreed to bring on Garth as director of photography and Donatello as a “creative consultant.” (A job that, as far as Dean can tell, mostly entails watching the shoots with a gimlet eye and grumbling under his breath at “all the inaccuracies.”)
Even when he manages to keep thoughts of Cas at bay, his mind keeps wandering back to the encounter with the old woman. What was it she said?
A finger prods at Castiel’s arm to underline the exasperation on Balthazar’s face. “I told you, Cassie,
“No.” Dean’s hands ball into fists at his sides, head shaking back and forth. “No. I was… confused or something. Or it’s some kind of stupid phase. Just one of those college things. I’ll… I’ll go back to normal when I get out of here.”
Cas nods his acknowledgement and closes the door. He doesn’t turn his back on Dean and he doesn’t lock the door behind them, but it’s a start.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean kisses him on his way out the door, which turns out to be a pretty effective way to stop the cursing.
He passes Castiel his drink and sits down opposite him on the couch. “So. Planning to tell me why you need ten thousand dollars?”
The kind, funny, handsome boy Castiel knew is staring back at him as a man whom Castiel couldn’t have made more beautiful if he’d drawn him personally.
Dean catches sight of Cas’ expression out of the corner of his eye. There’s something there… fear?
He knows he shouldn’t, but he can’t resist the compulsion to pull up his conversation history with M, to analyze the wording of his invitation for at least the tenth time since he sent it.
When Cas looks back at him, his eyes are wide and soft with relief. On reflex, Dean steps forward and folds his arms around Cas’ shoulders, holding him tight. For just a moment, Cas stiffens. Then, he brings up his arms to wrap around Dean’s waist and melts into the touch.
Dean wants to come back with a snappy retort, but decides to forgive his brother when he gets handed a beer straight from the fridge.
With a roll of his eyes and a blush, Sam leans in and pecks her on the lips. Castiel’s eyes wander back to Dean, who's watching his brother with a small smile on his face. In the immediate aftermath of Dean’s return, some mixture of adrenaline, happiness and relief apparently prompted Sam to drive directly to Eileen’s apartment and confess his feelings for her. Or, as Dean puts it, Sam “finally got his head out of his ass and realized he better lock her down before she figures out she’s too damn good for him.”
Castiel raises his hand, wanting to reach out to Dean, but halfway there, he thinks better of it. He’s not sure how welcome his touch would be. “But… you didn’t
In fact, restless in civilian life, John moved them around more than ever, chasing one temporary job after another. Finally, when Dean was twelve and his little brother Sam was eight, John’s old friend Bobby let him know about job openings at the Port of Baltimore. That was how they came to live here.
Benny’s amused rumble snaps Dean back to awareness, and the smell of the patties he’s been grilling hits him. They’re not burned yet, but they’ve definitely cooked longer than they’re supposed to.
to take the money, right? Surely, if you explain what happened and you return it, he… he won’t hurt you.” He meant to be reassuring, but his voice rises a little at the end, in question.
Dean’s not sure how he didn’t notice this before, but Cas looks like he shaved this morning. He still has a bit of five o’clock shadow, but it’s nothing like the long, shaggy stubble Dean’s gotten used to seeing on his face.
He traipses back to the ladder just as the curtain around Gabe’s bunk moves. Gabe’s head pokes out, one hand pulling sleepily at his face. “Baby bro?” His eyes fall on the bottle in Cas’ hand, then move to the undoubtedly guilty look on his face. “What’re you doing with my stash there, Cassie?”
“Gabe.” Cas is a little proud of how steady he sounds as he nudges his brother and points at the front row. “The police are raiding the place.”
waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“Scout’s honor,” Gabe says, holding up his right hand in a two-fingered salute.
Dean lets out a laugh, then quickly stifles it, remembering they’re not supposed to draw any attention to themselves. “Close enough. Sit on her lap.”
“He tried.” The words emerge as a croak, and Dean clears his throat. “To help, I mean. I pushed him away. Things fell apart for us pretty quickly, after… after I found out what you did. He started popping pills and smoking weed, and he wasn’t really anything like he used to be anymore.” He drains the rest of his beer. Watching the last few dregs of foam swirl around the bottom of his bottle, he mumbles, “Was my fault he got that way.”
Still, Cas tugs at the waistband until Dean’s cock jumps free, making Dean gasp and give another insistent pull on Cas’ hair.
“Please write to me?” Dean asks, and Castiel stares down at the paper, which contains an address at Camp Darby, and a small heart drawn right below it. Castiel doesn’t move for a long time, but eventually, he nods.
Dean swallows down the traitorous prickling at the back of his eyes. He needs to keep reminding himself this is all some kind of weird fever dream. Maybe he finally got turned, and this is what it’s like being a croat. His brain’s mostly shut off, but it’s generating this weird hallucination of everything he’s ever wanted so he doesn’t have to watch himself tearing other people to shreds.
Alarmed, Cas thumbs through his phone, determined to call Dean back and figure out what in the world is going on. He never gets the chance, because at that moment, a frantic bellowing comes up the outside stairwell.
“I love you too, Cas. So much.”
Dean really, really wants to argue anyway, but he doesn’t think his voice would cooperate, so he settles for staring at Cas, drinking him in while he still can. He’s stunning like this, with fire in his eyes.
Momentarily distracted, Dean gets up to see what he was sitting on. There’s a small piece of paper, folded once down the middle, and next to it a small purple bag, tied with a crimson ribbon. A sweet, flowery scent emanates from it. It's familiar, something he remembers Sam and Rowena using in spells before.
Sam chuckles softly. “Most of it. The rest was Mom.”
Half reluctant to leave the solid warmth of Cas’ arms around his neck, half stupid with excitement, Dean walks across the room to his bed, past the desk where he sent the first message to Cas just a few weeks ago. So much has happened in so little time that Dean’s a little dizzy with it.
Claire cocks her head at him, her expression incredulous. “Daddy, I can’t read yet.”
It could be that the picture from his bedside table is still on Castiel’s mind — himself, Amelia and Claire, sun-drenched and happy on the beach. Or it could be that he’s instinctively drawn to a place where he made good memories with his daughter.
Sam looks Cas up and down, taking in his unwashed hair, the long stubble always just on the verge of turning into an untidy beard, the ratty linen shirt.
But what on earth was he thinking? He can’t be himself. “Himself” is the guy who can’t make anyone stay in his life.
Castiel knows his line and delivers it seamlessly. “I said, ‘Where’s the deluxe version?’”
Dean rises too, but freezes when Missouri’s hand shoots out from her armchair to grab the sleeve of Cas’ coat. She looks up at Cas, her expression almost pleading. “I know you don’t believe a word I’m saying, either one of you. But I saw… I saw
Dean looks around the room, trying to remember where the camera ended up. He spots a glint in the far corner and walks toward it. It’s a crushed lens. The rest of the camera is scattered in jagged pieces across the floor. Like someone ripped it apart with their bare hands and then stepped on it for good measure. “Looks like Ketch took care of that,” he says, bitterly.
Dean clamps down on a sigh of relief. That was easier than expected. He didn’t even have to make promises about other jobs.
Really, the dish doesn’t need fussing over, and Naomi seems to realize this, if her occasional annoyed glances at Castiel from inside Claire’s bedroom are anything to go by.
“It’s my job to look at the big picture, Dean. And the big picture is that when people like Crowley are off the street, everyone’s safer.” Mills’ voice almost sounds pleading, like she wants Dean to understand. Dean’s not sure why she would bother. “What we were missing to get to Crowley was that final piece — the smoking gun, like they call it in the old movies. Meg’s death gave us that.”
“Oh.” Dean closes the door behind him. “In that case, mind if I turn on the light?”
“Not necess—” Dean starts, only for Zachariah to cut him off again.
He tries to poke and prod at bits of his memory, parts of his life where Dean ought to be. He remembers every corner of Dean’s bookstore, but when he tries to picture Dean in it, he comes up short. He remembers moving into this apartment, getting help from Sam and Charlie. Dean isn’t there. He tries to picture himself at City Hall in a blue tux, but there’s nothing. Not even a wisp.
James was often scared for her. When he grew up, that fear turned to anger and resentment; a conviction that his mother had imposed an especially elaborate delusion on him. He left her house the day he turned eighteen, calling her a fraud.
“Yes,” Cas agrees. “Oh.”
Between his shifts at the Gas-n-Sip and at the diner, he barely gets to see his son most days. Jimmy probably spends more time with Missouri, the elderly neighbor who watches him after school, than he does with his own father.
Next, he sends a text to Betty, smiling at her response. Then, he heads for the kitchen, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt as the last details of his plan take shape in his head.
“Me too,” Castiel says, nodding frantically even as he ducks down to capture Dean’s mouth again, fisting one hand in his hair and another in his t-shirt, wanting to be as close as possible.
The road curves to the left just ahead, and Dean has an excellent view of a tractor trailer traveling downhill. For now, there’s no other cars behind it.
Dean frowns at him, confused. “Why the hell not?”
“You’re Cas Novak?” Dean looks up, eyes widening. “I’ve read some of your features. You’ve got a great eye for detail. That piece about Blaze Starr was amazing. I wish they let me write stuff like that at the Star.”
There are few things Castiel can rely on.
Eventually, they make it to the top of the ridge.
Cas looks immeasurably relieved as he sets down the bag on the counter.
He found that place about two years ago, on the far western edge of Tybee Island. Even though Tybee is generally a pricey spot, the small, one-bedroom cottage surrounded by woods and marshland was enough of a fixer-upper that Dean was able to afford the down-payment and mortgage on it.
The warm water beating down on them is bliss, but it’s nothing compared to feeling the shift of Dean’s muscles underneath this skin, hearing the small moans and panting breaths escaping from Dean’s mouth as he keeps rolling his hips, crowding Castiel up against the tile.
Dean mumbles something and stalks off, and Castiel exchanges a quick glance with Charlie, one that he hopes conveys
Sergei takes the suitcase from Castiel with barely concealed eagerness. He thumbs through each bundle of cash several times before he’s satisfied. “Fine. And the IDs?”
Excitement and confusion battle it out inside Dean’s chest. This has to be good news, right? This has to mean they found Cas. But wouldn’t they just email him if that was the case? So maybe it’s
When sounds start up from the kitchen, Dean seriously considers hiding in the bedroom for the rest of the day, but what good would it do? Cas works from home, and Dean’s got to go and man the store.
Hands shaking a little, Dean takes hold of the knife and carves a small, spidery D onto the heel of Cas’ palm, right below his thumb. Cas hisses as blood wells up and covers the shape of the letter. Dean’s a little worried that he messed it up, but if he did, it’s too late anyway.
“It’s really very easy," Castiel says. "You ride the bike down this hill, steer around the buckets without hitting any of them, and then you go up the ramp, along the top of the wall and down the other ramp to the finish line. We’ll use your fancy watch to time the whole thing. Fastest time wins.”
“Hey, Cas! Lookin’ good!”
Castiel shrugs and pulls a grimace, hoping it’ll distract from the slight blush he can feel heating his face. “I have a boyfriend.”
Castiel gapes at her, feeling cold despite the lingering heat of the day. “Mother, I’m bisexual. I didn't 'get over that' when I married a woman.”
Then even those last remnants are gone, crumbling to dust on the third step.
“Cas? Thank God. Had me worried there.” A beat of hesitation. “Is he…?”
“Finally,” Castiel says. “I couldn’t even get my car out of the driveway this morning.”
“Fuck.” Dean’s breath comes in short, sharp bursts, but his muscles have loosened, and Castiel pushes the tip of his finger inside Dean’s opening. Dean exhales a heavy gust of air, and Castiel pulls off him, meeting his eyes. “OK?”
Dean chances a glance over at Sam, whose expression is carefully blank — in the way Dean knows from experience means he got his feelings hurt.
Nothing, however, has been as troubling as Dean’s reaction when Rowena made the outrageous claim that Dean’s soul is bound for Hell in as little as four days’ time. Castiel expected Dean to argue, to get angry and deny everything.
picks fights when we’re supposed to work together.”
Behind her, a man in one of the porch chairs sits up a little straighter. Dean catches his eye for the briefest moment. He’s burly, broad-shouldered and wearing a newsboy cap. The stranger frowns up at Dean, considering, but Dean has no time to process that reaction, because Charlie still has a firm grip on his sleeve. Unless he wants to break his neck going down the porch stairs, he’ll have to start paying attention to where he’s going.
When his tears finally dry up, he gulps down an entire glass of water, changes into a new shirt and heads out to the parking lot, where his beloved old Continental waits to take him into the city.
Around the same time, Cas stops wearing his trench coat and suit jacket inside the bunker. Dean doesn’t say anything about it. Not until the day he spots Cas in a t-shirt and sweatpants.
“I’m sorry I haven’t been in touch more,” Castiel says quietly.
Dean stares down at his phone in disbelief. Cas is coming. He’s so busy processing the news that the voice calling his name is close to shouting by the time he notices.
“You’re one of them,” Dean says, flatly. “Nick’s people.”
If our visitor managed to observe Spats and his companions as he passed, he wouldn’t be the only one. In the shadows thrown by the department store across the street, two other men wait.
Cas raises an eyebrow at her. “Nerd in training?”
“When were you going to tell me?” Cas’ voice is low, but crackling with hurt and rage.
Dean gapes at Bobby, open-mouthed. He almost doesn’t hear Crowley when he counters with “Thirty-five. One year for the arrangement, and Dean is barred from working getaways for anyone else for another five.”
conversation has him off his game.
“I would never,” Gabe exclaims, hand splayed on his chest in mock affront. “We owe two months’ back rent, our check at the laundry bounced, and we’re on the hook for fifty bucks at the delicatessen. How can you be so selfish, Cassie? The
He pauses, waiting for Dean to agree, probably, or just say anything at all. When Dean doesn’t, Sam’s frame visibly tightens, like he’s bracing himself.
She doesn’t finish the thought, but Castiel doesn’t need her to. “He felt that I was trying to hide our relationship. He wanted to meet you and father, but I was afraid to introduce him. There were other issues, but that was certainly the main sticking point between us.”
The little cottage where Cas and Amara live sits right at the top of a hill that looks out over the water. It has walls of rough stone, a few of the roof shingles are missing, and it looks like the next good breeze might knock it over. Actually, it kind of reminds Dean of the hideouts of highway robbers or smugglers in the mystery books he likes to read.
At Cas’ words, the spell breaks and the real world rushes back. Dean nods, blinking, and moves away, feeling every inch of distance between them. But before he even makes it all the way out of Cas’ space, Cas catches him with a hand around his wrist.
