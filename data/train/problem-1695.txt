Behind him, John chuckles, and then presses a light kiss to the spot below Sherlock’s left ear that always makes him giggle and twitch.  “We’ll make it tighter once I have everything in place, I promise.  But right now, I’ve just got to make sure I get the spacing right, okay?”
John doesn’t cut off his air supply for any notable length of time.  He simply oscillates between light pressure and tight squeezes, eyes bright and hungry as Sherlock struggles and flails.  All too soon, it’s too much; the fight goes out of Sherlock, and he submits entirely, muscles going lax and eyes fluttering shut, moaning helplessly against the come-soaked panties in his mouth.
“I can either fuck you with this until you come, just like I’m doing now.” Sherlock whimpers.  What John’s doing to him feels
“God, yes.”  John leans further back in his chair and begins to stroke himself.  His movements are light, clearly just teasing himself to full hardness, and Sherlock can’t help but lick his lips as he watches John work himself over, already imagining the pleasure John will impart upon him with his
“What do you want with her?” Sherlock interrupts. “The game is up.  GreySphere has been exposed.  The evidence is on a secure MI5 server.  They’ll have all they need to take your organisation down with or without Irene’s testimony.”
nice sweetheart, that was impressive, indeed…” John sounds sincerely pleased with Sherlock’s quick reaction, and his praise is like a salve on Sherlock’s jangling nerves.  “Now, tonight is really all about
pressed against his turgid cock, the masculinity of his phallus encased in the delicate silk a beautiful, glorious juxtaposition that leaves Sherlock trembling in its wake.  John seems utterly transfixed as well; he appears torn as to whether he wants to stare down at the divine image of the panties, or up to where Sherlock is falling completely, irrevocably apart.  He laps greedily against the silk before bringing up his hand to plunge it into Sherlock’s trousers and fondle his balls.
Simms crosses his heart with faux solemnity.  “Scout’s honour.  Go grab your ball and chain and let’s get out of here.”
Sherlock lowers his volume, but is tone is still urgent and excited.  “That… that vibrating wand thing that you used on me following the Hassan case!  Afterwards we decided that it was too intense to use again in a session, but you said we could experiment with it outside of one!”
“Come on, John, wash up.  You need to eat real food before you sleep tonight; those biscuits won’t hold you over.  We can make it to China Palace before they close if we leave right now.”
Greg nods.  “You see, that’s just the thing.  His partner died three months ago.  Car accident.  No one in his life had any idea he was seeing someone else.”
He finds it with ease, and proceeds to stroke the furled opening with the dry pads of his fingers, teasing at him without penetrating him.  Sherlock moans.
“Now, before we head in, I will remind you that we have a mandatory leash law in enforcement.  Have you brought one for your Sub, or would you like one to be provided?”
John rolls his eyes and shakes his head, but he grabs Sherlock’s hand on his way out the door, and together, they make their way downstairs.
Sherlock’s response is barely a whisper from where he’s knelt, face inches away from John’s throbbing erection.  “Oh, yes,
“Gah!  Gah!  Nnnnngh, YES, John…”  The sensation is overwhelming.  Sherlock feels he may go off at any second.
He plunders Sherlock’s mouth eagerly, swallowing his moans and sighs as his fingers skitter from nipple to nipple, carressing and pinching the pebbled buds while his other hand twists and tugs at Sherlock’s shorn locks.  Beneath him, Sherlock is vibrating with overstimulation, his lips open and receptive as he surrenders his body to John’s overtures.
“I’ve been personally instructed by the man in question to inform you, should you inquire, that he’s quite safe, and that his whereabouts will be revealed to you in due time.”
as they move against one another, acclimating to the new arrangement but no less enthusiastic than they’d been moments before.
John massages all of his limbs after the bindings are gone, checking his blood flow, stretching his joints, bringing his body back to earth.  Sherlock nearly melts into the rug he feels so good, letting his eyes flutter shut as John works him over.
So John takes Rosie through her bedtime routine (resoundingly refusing to be hurt when she asks for Sherlock no fewer than six times during her bedtime story; John
“Shhh, Sherlock, yeah, that’s it, come for me, come on, you’re so close, fuck, so close…” John mutters obscenely in Sherlock’s ear, hoping desperately that it’ll drown out Rosie’s babble. He moves his hand as fast as he can, jerking Sherlock furiously.
“Mmm, I’m glad.  God, you look so amazing.  Your waist, Christ almighty, so gorgeous…”  John’s hands meander to close around the narrowest point of the corset.  “You want me to fuck you now?”
Sherlock doesn’t even have to pause to consider it.  “Neutral.  I still very much enjoy being ignored mid-session, but it seems your proximity doesn’t impact me much one way or the other.  Just as long as you’re not paying attention to me, my response level is the same.”
The words spill from Sherlock’s lips like a prayer, and he leans forward and picks up his fork.  His cock is already beginning to swell; finally,
the creases are falling in weird places so it’s puffing up awkwardly and it’s making him looking gawky and stupid.
but decides to let it slide) “--so I change course.  It’s… it’s a balancing act.  I just keep sort of a running roster of activities in my head so I can switch things up on the fly if need be.”
But this new position has forced his pert arse to tip up, offering John an even better view of the two perfect round orbs he’s currently penetrating that hot, delicious place in between.
so far beyond what I thought my transport could be capable of.  The corporeal pleasure I experience when you’re dominating me and the intimacy that comes from it has helped me feel more at peace with myself than I ever have before.”
would be setting the boundaries of the interaction.  Regardless of the reason, John amiably settles into one of the plush leather chairs, anticipating a fair bit of downtime before Mycroft deigned to grace them with his presence.
How much blood has he lost?  A lot.  Too much.  His vision is dimming.  That’s not good.  He wants to move, but he can’t; it’s as if all the strength has left his body, and he’s being held down by invisible hands, pinning him to the sandy, godforsaken earth.
When John speaks again, his voice has dropped lower, gruffer, his tone more commanding, and Sherlock can feel his body responding instantaneously.
“Oh, sod off, you.” John hit him with the pillow again, but they were both laughing that time, and John could feel himself softening with affection.
Ten minutes later, Sherlock emerged from the bathroom in a cloud of steam.  He was completely nude save for John’s dog tags, and his cock was already at half-mast.  His eyes widened as he took in the scene before him.
Sherlock should perhaps be embarrassed at being caught out, but like most things with John, he doesn’t mind.  “Can it be both?”
When John approaches the stoop of 221B and notes that the door knocker has been straightened, it takes all of his willpower not to simply turn around, sit down, and bury his face in his hands.
Sherlock whimpers, and a visible tremble works its way up his spine.  John takes a few tentative steps forward.
The pattern he wants to do tonight is one he’s been ogling for ages.  The first time he’d watched Madame La Roux demonstrate it, he’d had to pause the video no fewer than four times to jerk off, each time bookmarking it and then returning to it an hour later only to yield the same results.  However, the techniques involved were advanced - far more so than anything John’s attempted up until that point.  But tonight, he wants to put Sherlock entirely under his control, and restraining him head to toe ought to do just the trick.
He’s already fairly loose; between fingering himself and John rimming him, three fingers barely feel like a stretch, and before too long, John adds more lube and slips in a fourth.  Sherlock gasps, and his fingers clench against the linen of the sheets.
charm to get the attention off me and my wreck of a life for a hot second.”  She pops the door handle and shoves it open with her weathered combat boot.

”  Sherlock dissolves into another fit of giggles, and John’s secretly thrilled he hasn’t taken offense.
“Very good, love.  Again.”  Over and over, John makes Sherlock repeat the process, each time working his way further down the corset, until finally, he’s securing the lowest loop of rope tightly in place.  Sherlock feels perfectly, overwhelmingly incapacitated.
Sherlock hums.  The tears are subsiding, and he’s starting to feel warm and floaty again.  “Mmm.  Thank you, John.”
know we’re involved, word around the water cooler is that they’ve got a pool going about which of us is the
John sighed and buried his face in his hands, rubbing his eyes in exasperation.  “Christ, I know.  I know we shouldn’t have started.  We were both just so…
They start kissing again as Sherlock scissors his fingers, the sounds catching in John’s throat horny and desperate and beautiful.  Sherlock begins to piston his fingers more earnestly, marveling at the way he can feel John’s passage unclenching around him to make way for the intrusion.  John’s legs twitch and spasm as they splay open wider, and Sherlock begins to rut more frantically against John’s hip.
Mycroft strides into the room with his typical aura of disengaged nonchalance.  He’s carrying a snifter of brandy, though it looks untouched.  He rakes his gaze over Sherlock and John in turn, then pinches the bridge of his nose and takes a wholly theatrical swig of his drink.
The sounds Sherlock makes when he’s being fucked properly would surprise no one:  They’re a delightful array of throaty growls and pained grunts and deep, sultry moans that are entirely in character for Sherlock’s trademark baritone voice, and John adores each and every noise Sherlock utters when he’s being taken hard and fast.
“Twenty days.  So not worth it.”  Sherlock peers over at him and noticed that the lines on John’s forehead have grown pronounced.  Perhaps he shouldn’t have mentioned--
John gives him an appraising glance from where he’s kneeling between his legs, then reaches down and makes quick work of the garter clasps, releasing the tops of the stockings.  Then he tucks his fingers into the waistline of the panties, and meets Sherlock’s eyes once more.
“Mmm.  A rather interesting thought, isn’t it?  The two of us like a pair of mirrors, reflecting impressions back at one another, unable to ever reveal what’s hidden behind them.”
it is to be watching a fire while John works on him.  Something about the hypnotic way the flames dance seems to mirror the trance John puts him under in moments like these, and he loses himself entirely, the world a distant buzz, vague and unconcerning.  There is nothing but this, him and John, together, making beauty.
He’s not quite sure what gets him to the turning point.  It may be the way John starts to spread his fingers inside Sherlock’s channel, stretching him wider, intensifying the burn of the penetration from behind.  Or maybe it’s the way John’s body clamps down in ripples around Sherlock’s turgid length each and every time he hammers against his prostate.  Or maybe it’s the way John’s eyes look, gazing up at Sherlock, so full of trust and love that Sherlock will never, ever find the words to tell this man what he means to him.
Sherlock tosses the mobile onto the nightstand and collapses back onto the bed, breathing as though he’s just run a marathon.  He’s so dizzyingly aroused by John’s demand that for a moment, he’s quite unsure whether he’ll have the wherewithal to follow through.
told John about it, because he knew John worried enough about Sherlock’s reaction to his scars already, and Sherlock
Sherlock’s lips part and his eyes widen and he grunts at the sensation.  Then the corners of his lips turn up into a mischievous smile: the cat who finally got the cream.  John grins salaciously back down at him, and Sherlock lets out a little laugh, and John laughs too, but then he hits an angle that makes them both gasp and groan and before he knows it, he’s pummeling into Sherlock with all the gusto he can muster while beneath him, Sherlock arches and swears and spreads his legs as far as he can to let John sink ever deeper inside.
Sherlock swallows hard.  John can see his Adam’s apple bobbing against the pale column of his throat, and he can feel his own throat tighten in response.
John leans forward and kisses him, his tongue pressing forward to lap into Sherlock’s eager mouth, and Sherlock can’t hold back the whimper that escapes from his lips.  He breaks away, panting, his cock twitching traitorously between his legs.  John follows his eyeline and raises his eyebrows.
John blinks his eyes open and peers up at him quizzically.  “You alright?”  Sherlock normally didn’t react to alarms one way or the other; if he was going through a sleepless phase, he’d wake up hours before an alarm was necessary, and if was going through a sleep binge, no amount of racket could stir him.  Startling awake at the innocent chirruping sound emitting from John’s mobile was rather uncharacteristic indeed.
The backs of Sherlock’s thighs collide with the table, eliciting a gasp from Sherlock and a rather precarious-sounding rattle from something perched there, but John can’t be arsed to take stock of the situation.  He continues surging forward between Sherlock’s spread legs, hands flying down to grip the backs of Sherlock’s thighs to give them a tug--
Concluding that there was little else he was willing to let stand between himself and fresh bagels, he throws open the bedroom door and strides purposefully into the kitchen.
Ever so cautiously, he proceeds to suck and lave at Sherlock’s twitching erection, wetting the fabric of the panties gradually with his efforts as his left hand continues to massage Sherlock’s tightening sac.  Sherlock just moans and grips his hair harder, surrendering completely to John’s advances.
“Fuck, that’s gorgeous.”  He looks over to see John circling him like a predator.  He’s lightly palming himself through his trousers; Sherlock can tell he’s nearly fully erect again.  He hopes this means John will fuck him soon.  “God, that’s lovely.”  He takes a deep breath and seems to center himself.  “Okay.  Next, I’m going to put your right leg in a bind.  You’ll still be able to hold yourself up with your left.  Is that alright?”
John heaves an exasperated sigh.  “One more chance.  One more chance to be good for me.  Now keep your hands where they are and
She nods her head vaguely towards the group.  “Celebratory dinner for the last day of the conference.  I’m headed home tomorrow.”
John--” Sherlock’s spine curls and his abs tremble as he arches a bit.  His free hand comes up to pluck his own nipples, which are peaked and flushed in the cool air of the room.  The hand on his cock begins to move faster.  For a moment, his eyes flicker back to the screen where, fortunately, Jude and the blonde (Candice?  Kendall?) and now having a frolic in the snow-covered gardens.
Thanks to John’s fastidious devotion to negotiation, Sherlock has only ever tapped out during a session twice, in all the time they’ve spent
“I want… God, John, I want to sit on your enormous prick; take it all in one slide, just the way I like it, so that it hurts, it hurts so much, filling me up until I think I might split in two.   And then I want to ride you until I feel I’m going to burst, until my arse is so sore I can’t carry on, and I’m begging to take your come.”
It’s a shabby but bright studio flat, with light, exposed wooden beams propping up the ancient roof and a layer of chalk-pale paint peeling from the walls.  The wall facing the street is comprised of an impressive bank of casement windows, and a skylight casts a dazzling patch of sun across the worn oak floorboards.  There’s a small bed in one corner covered in a tattered quilt, a ratty overstuffed armchair beside a bricked-over fireplace, and a bank of cupboards lining the back wall.  There’s a tiny table and two mismatched wooden chairs, an electric kettle, a toaster, and a hotplate.  All in all, a cozy-- if tiny-- fully-functional flat.
But today, there can be no room for error.  No flagrant displays of intellectual superiority.  No authority-undermining acts of rebellion.
“OHHHH!  John, I’m-- you’re going to make me-- oh, God, I can’t, I can’t, I’m going to-- I’m coming!  I’m coming! -- OH!”
“S-S-Sherlock…”  At that moment Ines grinds down on him with renewed fervor, and he can feel his eyes roll back in his head.  The next thing he knows, he can feel Sherlock’s fingers carding gently through his hair.
Sherlock grabs the pillow out from beneath his head and tries to swat John with it, but John’s too quick.  He’s already standing, pulling on his pajama bottoms and rooting around for his shirt.
“That was lovely, sweetheart, well done.”  Sherlock lifts his head and gives John a muzzy smile, the kind he only gets when they’re doing things like this, and it makes John’s heart swell inside his chest.
“Good.”  John’s voice is soft, and his fingers comb gently through Sherlock’s curls.  “You feeling alright?  You were pretty far under there at the end.”
It’s after the conclusion of one such session.  Sherlock is lying on the hotel bed, feeling a bit clammy and still aching from his denied release, taking deep breaths and focusing on John’s voice as he gently talks him down.
“Easy now, just a little at a time, we don’t want you to choke, love.”  John’s stroking his hair while Sherlock drinks.  It’s heavenly.
John reaches up to brush away an errant tear from Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock leans into the sensation as if by instinct.
John grabs the pillow and gives Sherlock a hearty whack with it.  “Seriously, Sherlock, get up.  I think we’ve scandalised people enough today without being caught
She pursed her lips and turned to meet his eye, her gaze steady and unwavering.  “I know that.  But… sexuality isn’t binary, is it?  It’s not just black or white, one thing or the other.  You can be one thing, with a little something else mixed in.  Isn’t that what Kinsey was getting at, after all, when he came up with his scale?”
Eventually the tension eases from Sherlock’s fingers and John feels him begin to gently card his fingers through his hair, encouraging him.  John smiles (well, as much as he can with a mouth full of cock) and gets to work.
flustered as he cards his fingers through his hair self-consciously.  Christ, he’s good-looking when he’s flirting.
know well he’d never thought to ask for something like this, out of the fear of appearing disrespectful or opportunistic.
“Shower it is, then.”  With that, John rises (a bit unsteadily) to his feet, then offers Sherlock a hand, which he gladly accepts.
“Yes, it did, but the ends don’t always justify the means.  You’re a recovering addict, Sherlock.  And you refuse professional help, and while I understand there are a lot of factors in your past that make you averse to that, I can’t be your therapist.  I’m your partner.  If I’m tying you up, I want it to be because it turns us both on, not to keep you from sticking a needle in your arm.”
Seb grabs his bookbag from where he’d left it leaning against the desk.  “I gotta run.  I told Drew I’d meet him before dinner.”
John indulges him for a long time, giving him the most decadent rimming of his life.  All thoughts of his own enjoyment fly out the window as he focuses on Sherlock’s reaction to the thought of Aaron doing this to him.  It’s so erotic, John can barely think.
He still goes through the motions of his day, but it’s like being on autopilot.  He’ll be vaguely aware that he’s engaging Sherlock in conversation, or putting Rosie through her bedtime routine, but it all feels hazy and surreal.
John grins to himself.  He knows damn well Sherlock’s taken him in this position countless times (and in a dazzling variety of infinitely more challenging positions and to much more intense degrees of roughness), so these newfound complaints he’s vocalising appear to be part of whatever fantasy they’re weaving together.
John’s hand stills and he detaches his mouth from Sherlock’s blisteringly sensitive flesh.  He props himself up on his forearm and brushes the hair away from Sherlock’s face with the fingers not currently buried to the hilt inside him.
(he takes the opportunity to dramatically clench his fingers in the chestnut-brown crown adorning his head), “you won’t make eye contact with me.  You’re sitting as far away from me as possible.  And when we were leaving the courtroom, you didn’t even want to be
He relinquishes his teeth’s grip on Sherlock’s shoulder with a measured degree of reluctance, pulling back to lap gently at bite mark.  This is a somewhat new part of their ritual when they Unwind, but he’d noticed when he and Sherlock had had an extended session recently just how much Sherlock enjoyed being bitten when he was at the receiving end of one of John’s orgasms.  John himself found the sensation unobjectionable; it was heady and undeniably primal, and he can’t help but grin down at the red mark blossoming around the location of the bite.  His cock gives an appreciative twitch of approval.
“Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! Ah!”  Sherlock throws his head back as John pistons into him, the sounds he’s making punched up out of his willing body completely outside of his control.  “AH! John! Ah! Ah! AH!”
Sherlock makes himself sit down and breathe.  He tries to remember some of the tactics that Anthony, the trauma counsellor they’d been seeing together, had taught Sherlock for times that his separation anxiety kicks in.
John snaps back to reality feeling flushed and a bit breathless.  Before him, the judge is adjourning the court for the day, and everyone around him is rising to their feet.
“Do you think he’s ready, darling?”  He throws an almost infuriatingly casual glance over at Sherlock, as though he’s discussing the weather.
“But his partner here didn’t believe that the car accident was an accident.  Kept claiming he’d been
John doesn’t even hesitate before tossing the large plug back in the drawer and grabbing the tube of lube from where he’d discarded it beside the pillow.
“I’ll just take your coats, then.  As a reminder, while we don’t forbid the use of electronic devices here at Splay, we do prohibit photography or recording of any kind.  If you’re suspected of violating this policy, your phone will be confiscated by our security services until the sensitive materials have been deleted.  This policy was detailed in the contract you signed upon check-in.  Any questions?”
Sherlock grits his teeth and attempts to consider this harsh reality despite the heady sensations driving his current actions.  Finally he conjures a response.
But before it can get too far, John relents, relinquishing control back to Sherlock as John resettles into the mattress with a contented chuckle.
John laughs and gives his arsecheek a playful swat, which makes the plug shift deliciously inside of him.  “Good.”
“Okay, love.  Can you reach behind yourself and spread your cheeks for me?”  Sherlock complies, grimacing as he does so.  He feels obscenely filthy.
“It wasn’t a suicide pill, and he didn’t hand it to me; that’s what made it a puzzle. I’d chosen correctly, and was therefore in no danger. Please, John, at least try to remember things correctly.”
So Moriarty had obviously seen Sherlock cringe. Even if he were in the room, there was no way his eyes were that good (Sherlock had been awake several minutes, and his eyes still hadn’t been able to pick out more than a line of less-dark blackness roughly two meters in front of him, doubtless the strip under the door to this room). Moriarty must have a camera trained on him, then, and one with night-vision capabilities. Good to know, don’t delete.
“No point,” interjected Anthea without looking up. “That ambulance wasn’t hired by any hospital in London. The corporation that hired it out has it down as being used by St. Bartholomew’s, but they don’t know anything about it.” The executive assistant was still typing away on her phone. “Relevant information is on Dr. Watson’s laptop.
“No.”  John stopped her. “I’ll call.” He was shaking, but determined as he silenced the pager and typed the number on his cell phone. John would be haunted, but he could deal with that later. There were more important things to think of at the moment.
At that, Anderson bit his nearly nonexistent lower lip and stormed off, leaving a wet trail of saline solution in his wake. As soon as the nurse rounded the corner, violin music started to flow from the open door he’d left behind.
The text message was all it took to lodge a stone firmly back in the pit of John’s stomach. It read:
Finally, the date of Sherlock's surgery arrives. Sherlock has all the info he needs, and all he has to do is get it to Mycroft, but this won't be possible until after his surgery. But considering how shady this place is, if Sherlock and John just let things happen chances are Sherlock will be re-booked in and kept there against his will even if no one finds out he's trying to expose the place. So, they have a plan. John is going to do the surgery, and with some bait-and-switch he's going to stash Sherlock in a closet before he can be readmitted. That way, he'll have some time to recover before he and John sneak out. His disappearance will be noted, but it's not like anyone will be in much of a hurry to admit they lost a human being.
Then, he leaned down and kissed the brow of his consulting detective. And perhaps it was John’s imagination, but he was sure that Sherlock’s fingers pressed down just a bit harder.
Sherlock smiled enigmatically. John thought to himself that he’d never seen someone quite so proficient at looking mysterious when Sherlock replied, “I highly doubt it will be quite that uninteresting, John, though you have the general point down.”
But Anderson wasn’t showing signs of giving in. “Exploding saline bag. The third exploding saline bag this week. Something has to be done about him!”
“In your position as his doctor, you will be privy to certain medical records. I would like you to relay these records to me. Nothing delicate, of course.”
John couldn’t have said how long they stayed like that, Sherlock softly shaking and John whispering completely true endearments. The doctor was dimly aware that his knees were still hurting, but he honestly couldn’t bring himself to care at the moment. Knees were never bruised in nobler circumstances.
“Take you, for example,” Sherlock continued. “Every time you mention the job I’m on, you look around for cameras and speak in a stage whisper. Now, imagine you were watching yourself on those cameras you don’t see. You would see a man acting very suspiciously. While if you were watching me, you wouldn’t see any behaviors out of place.”
"My real skin, not this fucking simulacrum," Sherlock's teeth flashed as he spoke, triggering unpleasant recollections of Baskerville. As well as this, John was off-put by Sherlock's use of foul language. Sherlock hardly ever swore. He felt cursing was base; profanity only being good for catch-all expressions, a crutch for morons suffering from a limited vocabulary.
John slowed down the pace. They both needed a break. He explored at a more leisurely tempo, touching on Sherlock's sensitive areas. After hours, and days, long years, his hands paused, cupping the swell of Sherlock's chest. Thumbs took over, targeting petite areolae. A rush of sharp ecstasy pulsed through Sherlock's groin, centering on the length of his cock. Swamped with lust, fingers met thumbs and squeezed, gently tugging on the tips. The detective's hips instinctively thrust up, bumping into John's sweaty stomach.
Maybe it should unsettle him.  Somehow, it doesn’t-- perhaps it just compounds Sherlock’s endless mystique, even after all these years; the thought makes him smile a little fondly despite his current attitude towards the man.
John smiles dotingly down at him.  “You’ve been so good for me so far tonight, sweetheart.  Are you ready for me to push you a little further?”
John internally smirks.  Externally, he uses his most placating Dom voice.  “That’s how it should be, love.  Since this is the first time we’re doing this, I’m starting out with the candle pretty high up.  I’ll lower it each time, so it’ll get hotter as we go, and that’ll give you a chance to tap out if it gets too uncomfortable.  Make sense?”
he’d be bloody perfect about dealing with something like this.  It makes Sherlock want to roll his eyes, just how infuriatingly
“That’s it, there we go.  Just going to let a little bit out, make you more comfortable, okay?  Shhh.  Shhh.  Just let me.  Just let me.”  With that, John begins to massage the oversensitized bundle of nerves buried deep inside him, with expert precision and
“Thank you, sweetheart.”  Then there’s an uncomfortable pinching sensation, followed by a dull throb of pressure, but it’s over as soon as it started, and Sherlock is open and exposed for John.  He shudders as the cool air of the bedroom comes into contact with that most intimate place.
Sherlock feels frozen in place, pinned down by John’s words, his lips, the heat in his eyes-- Sherlock’s
Which brought them here, to Sunday, which they’d been taking a decadently leisurely place.  They’d slept in, gone out and gotten dumplings, taken a walk in the park, then returned home, where Sherlock had been playing his violin and John was updating his blog.  John had just been about to announce he was going to go have a long, hot bath (his knees were ridiculously achy; he was seriously re-thinking whether the two-hour sex marathon on the sitting room floor had been worth it) when Sherlock unceremoniously announced that he was--
It doesn’t matter.  He steps into the shower and the effect is instantaneous; it’s as though the incessant flames licking the insides of his veins have been magically extinguished.  He reaches for the soap-- not his usual body wash, no, but the special sandalwood soap that’s usually reserved for after their sessions, when John is washing him clean.  The smell is so soothing to him, so intrinsically linked to memories of
Sherlock takes a quick assessment of his transport, and clears his throat.  “Um, yes.  Yes, for now, but I think… I think that’s all I can handle tonight.”
John gives a reluctant sigh.  “It’s unfortunate, sweetheart, it really is.  We were having such a nice time, but you had to go and misbehave.  How many do you think you owe me, ruining a moment like that one?”
Eventually, John steps away.  Sherlock can’t see him; he’s standing off somewhere around to the side, clearly admiring his handiwork.  Sherlock takes the opportunity to try and raise his torso even a fraction of an inch off the table, but it’s absolutely no use; he’s in the centre of a spider’s web.  He doesn’t stand a chance.
Sherlock nods, not trusting himself not to choke on his own desperation.  John resumes binding him, and Sherlock watches in rapt fascination as the corset takes shape, encasing the lower half of his torso entirely before cinching in at the waist.
Watson has ever had.  And it’s with that reassurance that he can lie here and bask in post-coital bliss, ready for whatever the day may bring.
was going on?  John’s brain is struggling to process the scene playing out before him, because none of it is making any sort of sense whatsoever, but Sherlock remains undeterred.  He simply dips his head and suckles the tip of John’s rapidly-swelling member into his mouth, before letting out a pornographic moan, his eyes flitting upward to meet John’s own.
“Good.”  John unfastens his fly and pulls out his prick, then maneuvers to stand in front of Sherlock’s kneeling form.  “Hands behind your back.  Suck me.  Don’t touch my balls; shaft only.”
Sherlock’s eyes fly open wide as John rides him, reaching forward to brace against the armrest of the sofa to give himself better purchase to grind against Sherlock’s prone form.
“Shhhh, shhhh sweetheart, just let it happen, shhhh…”  John runs his hands over Sherlock’s flanks in soothing circles, attempting to gentle him.
Normally now would be the time he’d give them a pause; he’d leave Sherlock tied up and debauched to recover while John waited for his own refractory period to be over.
John grins at the title.  Sherlock has picked up on what John’s in the mood for, then… Christ, he’s so clever.  So clever and brilliant and perfect.  It makes John very happy.
“All good.”  John sounds unforgivably cheerful as he swings his legs off the bed and stands up.  Sherlock turns his head just in time to see John rolling off the condom and striding towards the bathroom.
“Fuck, I can’t wait.”  Jude sounds almost infuriatingly casual, but he doesn’t cease the gentle tugs on Sherlock’s mane as he continues to work him over.
John howls and arches, his hands flying to tangle into Sherlock’s hair.  Sherlock moans deeply and begins to bob, swirling his tongue in that particular way that makes John’s brain go blank.
“You’re welcome, love.  Now stay there.”  John turns and makes his way to the bathroom to retrieve the medical shears from under the sink (he always makes sure to have them on-hand when they’re playing with bondage, in case he needs to cut the ropes in an emergency).  He’s not concerned about Sherlock running away anymore; usually once he’d been taken, he grew endearingly complacent.
John comes with a strangled shout, silencing himself midway to crush his lips against Sherlock’s, plunging his tongue into his mouth as he releases his seed deep inside him, claiming him completely.
meaning, so he took a video, and sent it to me at work.  I wasn’t sure whether I was more proud of Rosie for making the climb, or of Sherlock, for realising the emotional value of something like that.  It was… it was really amazing.”
“Alright, now let’s see.  It’s been a few days since you’ve taken proper care of your transport, so that’s what we’ll do next.”  John keeps his tone light and appeasing; he knows Sherlock dislikes this part of their sessions, but he’s hoping that providing him with the challenge of keeping his hands in place will be enough.
“Oh, fuck!  Oh, yeah!  Oh!  Sherlock, YES!  YES!”  John fucks Sherlock through his orgasm, stimulating him as thoroughly as possible so as to prolong his pleasure to the fullest extent.  Beneath him, Sherlock screams and wails as his cock emits its generous load, spurned from the relentless assault of his prostate within.
That I’m somehow wrong for you, different, an extreme outlier in your data set, a deviation from your standard.  And I acknowledge, statistically, that I
kind, strong and dark and just bitter enough.  And the dough-- not sweet, a little savory, with just a hint of spice…
and Sherlock is arching and calling out his name as John slicks up one finger and guides it to his entrance.  Then John lowers his head to take the tip of Sherlock’s cock between his lips, and in one simultaneous slide he presses his finger into Sherlock as he swallows his cock fully down his throat.
“Oh!  Yeah, of course, fine, it’s all fine…”  John takes a mental note about Sherlock’s expressed preference in this situation; no vibrations prior to extreme penetration.  Done.
forcibly stilling him in order to chase the string pleasure being wrung out of him by Sherlock’s enraptured body.
John quirks an eyebrow.  “Are you ready to be bred tonight?  I don’t know about you, but I’m suddenly feeling
“If I promise to tell you all the sordid details of every sexual deduction I’ve ever made about you as soon as we’re done, will you please
“Oh--gah!  Jesus… okay, Sherlock?  I need to come.  Are you close?  Do you want to try and come first?”
John had never really been bothered by Sherlock’s inability to talk dirty before, but now that he’s getting a taste of it, he finds he’s oddly
John isn’t able to maintain an erection during anal penetration.  That fact continues to boggle Sherlock’s mind, but he’s been resoundingly assured (by both John and the Internet at large) that this is an incredibly common reaction that has no bearing on the receiving partner’s enjoyment of the act.  So slowly but surely, Sherlock is learning to disassociate arousal from erection, and trust John to know what he wants.
Wizkid saw Sherlock look back at him as well, and quickly move his hand in front of him, arranging his fingers.
Lestrade forcefully bit his lip to stop himself from yelling through the phone about the chain of evidence and police property...
"Mycroft?..." He asked out loud. Though he already knew the answer. Mycroft Holmes was not the kind of man one easily forgot after meeting him.. And Lestrade had met him, many times, over the last five years...
. Teenager. A young clone of the father. Student at boarding school, dumb as he is violent. New clothes, age appropriate. Dirt and grass stains already, Shoes scuffed. Obvious Bully who is definitely abusive to Son #2. Selfish also feels entitled. Doesn't care about what he has, just cares that he has it. Goes along with and believes everything his parents say and do. Agrees with it, even. Father's right hand? Weapons of choice; fists and cohorts. Bullies hunt in packs... Weaknesses; belongings, weight, blind faith...
He had taught himself how to bottle it up and calm it down a long time ago, but every now and then it would leak out. He would spread his hate and disgust like fire. But he would always gain back his control. In the end, he would always win against it. Still, his wife and everyone else would use that as an excuse to show just how "bad" he was getting, or how dangerous he had become...
"NUMBER 13, PRIVET DRIVE!" The officer yelled over the engines and (now) squealing tires. "THE HOUSE OF ARABELLA FIGG!"
Only getting rid of those pathetic fools did... Strangling Vossler, beating the living daylights out of Piers... And Figg! What he had done to Figg! Oh, that was his crowning moment... That was a true work of art. It made the rage go away and lifted all that filth and dirt of his past off his shoulders.
He wouldn't let him and John in the house, or go visit any of the previous crime scenes! He wouldn't even let him take
"Of that, I have no dought," Lestrade said, as he quickly hung up his phone. The two screamers from the back seat were both saying how they refused to go anywhere near Sherlock and were pretty much listing off every one of his faults.
for his potions books, Etc. No one would know that they were magic books unless they actually opened them and read them. It was part of a deal he made with his Aunt and Uncle after he came home first year, so he could do his homework during the summer. Otherwise, they were going to lock his books away. He was glad for it now.
"Got to hurry, Got to hurry, got to hurry!" Harry said to him. He struggled to figure out where to even begin.
Your website explained more of the principles and uses of deductive reasoning than any other I have managed to come across. It gives a better idea of how helpful deduction could be, IF used actively. I do have a few questions though, which is why I am writing. I hope you don't mind.
"The second scene was a bloody mess." Started one of the two only female officers, as she got ready for roll call. "Blood was all over the place. Kid's face and head all bashed up. Something out of a nightmare, almost. It was obvious he put up a hell of a fight. But it was no use... The perp took his time letting the kid die, too. More than half of the blood on-scene was dry by the time we got there, but the kid's body was still a bit warm. Must have laid there, bleeding out since midnight. The Docs set his TOD at 4. No weapons or weird bruises here, just the injuries from the beating he took. Hands and feet only."
Now, Piers and that pathetic woman Figg where dead as well, also by his hand, and more and more of his rage and anger was gone... And he felt
"I think you know very well that you have," Lestrade said, the commanding bark he was known for coming back into his voice. He was NOT going allow himself to be intimidated by Sherlock's older brother... He was NOT! "Now, what do you want?"
"I asked for it. While you were arguing behind closed doors, I chatted with the officers that were at the scenes." Sherlock somehow managed to look even more insulted.
Luckily there was Miss. Figg down the street, and the teachers at school. While he didn't get to ask them all the time, the times he did ask they were more than happy to answer him. He learned quite a lot, but it always lead to him wanting to know more.
I was surfing through the Internet encyclopedia of philosophy, when I caught a look at a tab called 'Deductive Reasoning.' (right next to inductive, go figure...) I read the page, and found myself interested. I ran a web search to find out more. After finding a few colorless and useless pages, I managed to stumble upon your site.
The phone nearly slips out of John’s fingers as he blinks at the driver uncomprehendingly.  “...Lindy?”
It’s an insult.  It’s an insult and a challenge and something feral and ugly rears its head deep inside him, and for the first time ever, he is wildly,
“Shit, the pastries!” Sherlock whirls around and throws open the oven, which billows out a frankly alarming amount of smoke.  He scrambles for the oven mitt and yanks the tray out, but the poor puffs are burnt beyond repair.  Uttering a frustrated groan, he deposits the lot of them atop the stove before opening the kitchen window and attempting to disperse some of the smoke.
“Me either, I certainly didn’t peg him as a lifer, and yet.” He gives a perplexed shrug.  “Johnson’s living in Bristol-- he’s got a couple of kids now, too.  Simms and Demir are both in London, I think.  Oh!  I ran into Wilson a couple of months back at Heathrow.”
Despite himself, Sherlock snorts out a laugh, which prompts John to start giggling, and for a moment they just stand there like a pair of loons, laughing at the ceiling and imagining all the infinite possibilities therein.
but John doesn’t mind, here in this moment.  Right now, while they’re trying this new experiment, it doesn’t feel like they’re Dom and Sub, they just feel like John and Sherlock, and John doesn’t feel compelled to push the point.
Sherlock nods gratefully.  Having John’s tags in his mouth gives him something to focus on besides what’s happening to his transport, which is often helpful when they reach this point in a session, as Sherlock’s body grows sensitive from overuse.
Sherlock splays out luxuriously, relinquishing his hold on John and sinking into the sheets with a relieved sigh.  His cock feels hot and he can tell it’s tenting his panties obscenely; John’s gaze seems riveted to it as Sherlock spreads his legs wantonly, leaving no uncertainty about his desires.  John hovers above him, taking in the spectacle, and Sherlock preens under his gaze.
Sherlock swallows and closes his eyes.  John knows from their past conversations about double penetration that he hates being examined after such rough use, but John had been adamant that it was necessary.
If Sherlock were acting sultry and romantic, John would take him out to Angelo’s.  He’d hold Sherlock’s hand and run his foot seductively up and down Sherlock’s calf under the table as they locked eyes in the flickering candlelight.  Then they’d get handsy in the cab on the ride home, then John would guide Sherlock upstairs to the bedroom and make love to him for hours, until Sherlock was a soft, sated puddle of contentment.
He didn’t look over at John, but he could tell John was giving him one of those insufferably wary, sad looks he got when he’s worried something will trigger Sherlock.  It’s dangerously close to
And they hold each other and giggle and giggle until the giggles turn to sighs, imagining all the weekend would have in store for them both.
John interrupts, rising to his feet and whisking the tea tray off the table, plucking the still half-full cup from Irene’s hand with altogether more finality than necessary-- “really need to find someplace else to stay.  We appreciate the intel, but we have a family, and we prefer not to centre a target firmly over our domestic abode,
“Okay.”  With that, John tossed the picture aside and wiped his hand on his trouser leg.  Then he sat forward and reached down to run his fingers through the streaks of come lining Sherlock’s face and brought them to his lips as an offering.
John takes a resolute step towards him.  “Mainly the part where you’re putting your hands on my partner.”  It’s an outright challenge, and John hardly expects Aaron to back down.  But what he
It takes Sherlock a few minutes to feel like he’s not about to burst into flames.  He keeps his eyes squeezed shut as John works him over, terrified that if he looks down to where his own cock is hanging heavy and leaking between his legs, he won’t be able to hold back.  John hasn’t given him permission to come, and while he hadn’t explicitly forbid it, Sherlock knows John likes to be in control of his pleasure in moments like this.
Sherlock blinks uncomprehendingly.  He can’t think about anything besides what’s happening inside his arse.  He doesn’t respond.
“Nonsense, John, look here.”  Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and pulled up a video with disconcerting ease--he must have had the damn thing bookmarked.  “Of course, a lot of the people in porn are just doing it for the cameras, but there are some who sincerely enjoy it.  You can see with this one, not only is he able to regain his erection following the initial penetration, but he’s actually able to ejaculate
“That’s correct.  Very astute observation, sweetheart.”  John can see that despite himself, Sherlock shivers beneath John’s praise.  “Now we’re going to practice a very important skill.  Do you have any idea what that skill might be?”
John’s face transforms into a knowing smirk.  “Good.  Get freshened up, and I’ll see you back in the hall?  We ought to give Greg our congratulations.”
anger.  It’s a Pavlovian response to a deliberate stimuli, planned and executed within set boundaries.  This was fine.
“The headquarters of a pharmaceutical company.  They want to pay me to come up and run some experiments for them.”
His balls feel tight and he’s hot all over and he’s wanking himself as fast as he can, but it’s still not quite enough.  Desperate, he heaves himself up onto his hands and knees, spreading his legs wide before returning his hand to his rock-hard cock, lowering his torso and imagining…
“She’s fine.  She just got another promotion at work so I’ve been doing the lion’s share of the childrearing, which may explain why I needed to get out of town for a bit.”
Would he come up behind John’s chair and pull him to his feet, then push him forward to fuck Sherlock’s face?  Would Sherlock look up just in time to see Aaron wrapping his strong arms around John’s torso and pressing against him from behind, burying his lips at the crook of John’s neck before licking down to his scarred shoulder?
Sherlock cocks his head.  “I was thinking it might be nice to lie across your lap.  I could thrust against your thigh that way; your thighs always feel nicer than the bedsheets.”
“It was consensual, John.  I wanted it rough, you were doing what I wanted you to.  And you stopped when I told you to.”
“I’m going to start touching you now.  If it’s too much, just say stop.  If you can’t speak, snap twice.  If you need to take a break, that’s fine; we can always try something else for a bit and then pick up where we left off.  One snap for yes.”
wasn’t it just?  That despite the time, all it takes is for him to slip into bed and curl up behind John and murmur into the whiskey-salt crook of his neck,
“You alright, love?”  Sherlock realises that John’s frozen in place; he clearly wasn’t sure whether Sherlock’s exclamation had been one of pleasure or trepidation.
“Good.”  John ties the scarf around his eyes, and John can immediately see Sherlock’s body relaxing; sensory deprivation seemed to do him good at this point in the session.
that John would know it anywhere.  He remembers it from long ago, after the Fall, those sad, aching days when he’d wrap himself in Sherlock’s dressing gown and lie in his bed and miss him so much that the world cracked and crumbled leaving behind nothing but grey.
John closes his eyes and allows himself to imagine that the lube inside Sherlock is a mess of an entirely different kind.  God, what if Aaron had
He’s so lost in the work that he nearly jumps out of his skin when Sherlock suddenly slaps his laptop shut and springs to his feet.  “We should get dressed.  I’ll lay out your clothes on the bed.”
“Oh.  Um, yes, it was… good.”  Great.  Now he sounds like an imbecile, too.  He frantically scrambles to think of anything worth saying, but nothing comes out.
His erection forces its way prominently to the forefront of his consciousness.  He can feel himself engorged and throbbing, swinging heavily between his own thighs with every slap of John’s hand.  He adjusts the angle of his hips just a bit so that his cock brushes up against John’s calf.  It feels good.
Sherlock turned to look at John, gazing placidly over his shoulder.  His face was blank, like a mask, devoid of any glimmer of intimacy.  John shuddered.  “That word you used.  Don’t use it with me ever again.”
That’s not good.  That’s bad.  John calls him that when he’s bad because Sherlock doesn’t like that name.  But Sherlock likes it when John uses it because he likes being bad for John sometimes even when he wants to be good for John most of the time, and that doesn’t make sense, but it does, somehow, that he wants to be bad and good and it’s all okay because John says,
Sherlock whites out.  He knows he’s coming, that much is clear; he can feel the ribbons of hot liquid landing on his abdomen and chest, he can feel his cock twitching and pulsing with each surging emission, he can hear John’s tender words of encouragement talking him through it.  But it’s all a thin, delicate tether to reality, as the neurons in his brain are set ablaze and then fizzle to smoldering dust, his transport a mere vehicle for his ecstasy.  And then everything fades in to a quiet, serene oblivion.
seeing as Mycroft’s never had a friend in his life, but he has always had a penchant for identifying future authority figures and making himself absolutely
“So let’s talk about the issue at hand: boredom.  As we all know, during a scene, your Sub’s attention should be
He doesn’t remember starting to drift, but he knows it happens because he loses track of time entirely.  At one point he’s fairly certain he hears a faint murmur of voices from the sitting room, but he can’t be arsed to care about the context of any of it; he simply stretches out his limbs, starfishing luxuriously, delighting in the way the come on his stomach feels tight and cool as it congeals.  He arches his back and gasps as the plug shifts inside him.  He curls his toes and sighs and nuzzles back into the pillows and drifts and drifts and drifts, waiting for John’s return.
John’s eyes rake over Sherlock’s kneeling form, his expression unreadable, as if considering his options.  Sherlock trembles in anticipation until the moment John cocks his head, gives a barely-visible nod, and makes his way over to stand before him.  Sherlock has to bite back the whine threatening to escape the back of his throat.
There’s no pain-- perhaps a fleeting sting, no more than a flicker of shock at the sensation of impact, but nothing that registers as “hurt” anywhere in Sherlock’s dopamine-addled brain.  Instead, there’s a glorious, urgent
“The day that Sherlock jumped, Moriarty had three snipers.  One on me.  One on Mrs. Hudson.  And one on you…”
John helps him to his feet extremely slowly.  Sherlock’s legs and knees are predictably sore from kneeling for so long, so John makes sure to take his time with each transition as he helps Sherlock to stand before guiding him gently down the hall.  Then he strips off his own clothes, flicks on the taps, and helps Sherlock climb under the spray.
“Already in bed with a hot cuppa in one hand and her rosary in the other.  Doubt she’ll need anything else tonight.”
The grin on John’s face dissolves instantly, transforming into a worried frown.  “Sherlock?  You alright?”
“Kneel.”  Sherlock drops fast, and John strides up to him and reaches forward, wrenching his mouth open with his fingers before stuffing the first of the leather belts inside.  He secures it quickly behind Sherlock’s head, and Sherlock moans against his gag.  His cock is flushed and erect between his legs, and John smirks down at him, delighting in his reaction to rough use.
The next time he blinks his eyes open, it’s to the flushed, delighted face of John pressing kisses against Sherlock’s sweat-soaked cheeks and forehead.
They’re slow to get their bearings after that.  Eventually, John pulls out and checks Sherlock over.  Everything is in order, but then John insists on taking a few more pictures (seeing as how Sherlock had taken an additional two loads since the last photos were taken, and John declares the improvement is substantial), so Sherlock indulges him, spreading his legs as praise pours from John’s lips, punctuated only by the snaps of the shutter.
There’s a resounding silence from the kitchen, the water having abruptly shut off midway through Sherlock’s sentence.  Sherlock listens intently to his own heartbeat thrumming in his eardrums and prepares to stand his ground.
“How so? Let’s start with the fact that most of the people we work with don’t even know we’re romantically or physically involved, let alone legally bound and raising a child.  And for those who
By the time all the songs are sung and the whiskey is drained and cheeks are kissed and sentiments exchanged, Sherlock feels dead on his feet.  John closes the door behind Mrs. H with a relieved sigh (she was always the last to leave any gathering, and John had finally made some thinly-veiled excuse about the two of them needing to pack for the countryside before she finally allowed him to help her to her feet and escort her to the stairs; Sherlock had long since abandoned social niceties and retreated back into the kitchen to wrap up an experiment John had implored him not to leave festering in their impending absence).  John makes his way into the kitchen and plants an affectionate kiss on Sherlock’s cheek.
And then John dips his head and firmly sucks Sherlock’s left nipple into his mouth and bites down on the peaked tip.
“Oh, Christ, sweetheart, look at you.  So hard for me.  I’ll give you a choice now; If you’d like, you can get yourself off now while I watch, but I’m not going to touch you.  But if you can be patient, I’ll make you come on my cock while I fuck you.  Which would you like?”
It many ways, John’s made him a member of his own family again, after so many years on the outside.  It’s yet another debt he does not know how to repay.
Sherlock wipes the spit from his lips, but he keeps his eyes resolutely shut.  “I liked… I liked how hot it was.  He was so hard, John, he felt like velvet steel in my mouth.”  John almost giggles at Sherlock’s erotic turn of phrase, but manages to hold back.  “And the way he looked at me…
It’s a rather unerotic fumble of pajamas and sheets and blankets and pants, but soon enough John’s pulling the covers back up over them, enveloping them in a warm, intimate cocoon.  Sherlock presses his nude body against the length of John’s side and leans forward to nibble his earlobe.  Their giggles quickly turn to moans.
It’s not uncomfortable, not really-- John had more than adequately prepped him.  But he knows what’s about to happen, and even so, he can’t decide which is more terrible: the weight and width of the object in his arse, or the dread of what it’s about to do to him.
The press of his lips is chaste and innocent, and it takes Sherlock rather by surprise.  He’d assumed that tonight John would be all heat and harsh demands, spurned on by days of frustration surrounded by his infuriating family.  But instead, he is careful, reverent, kind…  His lips move against Sherlock’s gently, tender in his ministrations as his tongue presses lightly forward, imploring Sherlock for entrance.  Sherlock grants it without thinking.
John scoops up Rosie from her crib and carries her up the stairs.  She’s sleep-sated and muzzy, but she curls into his arms the moment John lowers her to the bed.  He lays down beside her, and for a few precious hours, he sleeps.
“Mmmmmm.”  John moans deviously against the peaked bud in his mouth, and Sherlock’s heels dig into the mattress as his legs splay outwards and his fingers tangle into the soft fabric of the duvet.
Sherlock preferred seclusion.  He’d stay in their cottage and read or write or take a hot bath or sometimes just
Sherlock gasps and writhes, his thighs clenching together automatically in defense, coming precariously close to putting John in a headlock.
“Nnngh, okay.  Alright.  Gonna… gonna finish inside you, hold on…”  John leans forward to take hold of Sherlock firmly by the shoulders, pinning his body in place.  Sherlock extends his arms to brace himself against the footboard before lowering his head once more.
He’s just allowed himself to absently wonder if John’s about to come like this when suddenly, John’s weight evaporates from his chest as he deftly maneuvers off of Sherlock’s bound form and takes his place at the side of the bed once more.
John’s fingers return to Sherlock’s hair, combing through his locks with a reverent grace that feels sweet and steadying.  “Are you ready for some sleep?”
And then John’s jerking his shaft mercilessly in sharp, quick strokes, flicking his thumb over the head each time
“Oh, God, yes.”  Sherlock tips his head back and bares his throat, and John’s spent cock gives a resolute twitch at the sight.
Sherlock understands what John is asking: Sherlock enjoys painful sex, but neither of them are into outright pain play, so John trusts Sherlock to discern what falls into which category for himself.  “Yes, John.”
“Oh.”  Sherlock blinks again, that adorable crease that appears between his eyebrows when he’s perplexed emerging and bringing a grin to John’s face.
It’s not instantaneous, as John had thought it would be.  Sherlock twitches and moans for a few more minutes, eyes wild and desperate as they lock with John’s.  It’s clear that if he were able to use any of his usual tricks (dropping down onto his elbows to change the angle of penetration, oscillating his hips to control the rhythm of the pressure against his prostate, perhaps even tugging his own balls or pressing against his perineum to increase the intensity of the sensations), he’d have gone off in seconds flat.  But as it stands, Sherlock is completely immobilized by John’s commands, and he’s helpless to do anything besides hold still, and wait.
been messing about during that grappling session, and he’s fairly certain he’s going to have some bruises of his own tomorrow.  He makes his way to the closet and pulls out a belt and a scarf before returning to Sherlock’s bedside.
But then John’s mouth disappears, and the vibrations stop, the pressure of the plug evaporating instantly.
at her.  She’s extremely pretty, young and fair-faced, with delicate features and deep brown eyes that, now that he’s actually
He lifts his hips obediently, and John pulls the panties down to his calves.  Then John shuffles forward, lifting Sherlock’s legs until his ankles are perched on John’s shoulders, the panties stretched between them.  John reaches down to line up his cock and presses inside, folding Sherlock nearly in half as he braces himself against the headboard.
John feels rather like one of those cartoonish record-scratch sound effects has gone off in his head.  He’s fairly certain he’s misheard.  “...I’m sorry?”
John’s mobile rings at a little after noon.  He’s honestly shocked he had it on him when he’d stormed out of the flat that morning-- usually when he flew off the handle like that, he’d find himself several miles away from Baker Street without a coat, keys, wallet, or phone, shivering and disorientated and still seething with white-hot rage.
No judgement.  “Alright.”  Then John is fastening the strip of silk across his eyes, and everything in the world disappears save for one John Watson.
He works him over thoroughly, occasionally pausing to add more lube (first to two digits, then to three). Each time he pauses he suckles Sherlock’s balls into his mouth one at a time, lapping against them while above him, Sherlock rocks and trembles on the table.  By the time he’s twisting three fingers into the indescribably tight heat of his body, Sherlock has been reduced to panting moans that nearly sound like sobs.
On the screen, Madame La Roux tosses the piece of paper aside and looks directly into the camera.  Her posture is open and relaxed, and John feels himself completely at ease with her.  She flips her long cascade of shining hair casually back over her shoulders and takes a deep breath, her bosom rising and falling in a most tantalising manner, but she seems entirely oblivious to the sensuality oozing from her being; when she speaks, her response is earnest and direct and nearly businesslike.
Sherlock’s eyes roll back in his head, and then he feels the unmistakable sensation of John’s release blooming inside of him.
He purses his lips and mulls it over.  “I… I suppose that would be alright.  If a case came up, Lestrade would probably reach out to you if he couldn’t get ahold of me, then you would let me know… right?”
A smile tugs at the corners of John’s lips as he lowers the candle once more.  He finds the edge of yet another of Sherlock’s deeper scars, and tips the hot wax along the length of it, tracing the raised tissue at a slow, measured pace.
until Sherlock’s whole being expanded to encompass all of John Watson’s myriad of desires.  With John, Sherlock never ceased to amaze even himself.
bureaucratic nightmare, and all Sherlock wanted was to go back to the flat, let John fuck his brains out, and then get some well-earned sleep.  But instead he’s subjected to
Sherlock gives an anguished cry, more animal than human, back arching enticingly as he struggles to alleviate the strain on both his throat and his follicles.  John doubles down on his efforts, twisting his hair and pulling his head to the side, tightening the belt enough that while it won’t cut off Sherlock’s air flow entirely, it will still keep him from struggling further.
“I know.”  Sherlock’s voice still sounds small and uncertain.  It’s so unlike him, John’s almost afraid.  “It was childish and foolhardy, but I just had this… this fantasy, of coming back to London, to you, and everything would go back to the way it was.”  He laughs wetly and brushes at the tears, shaking his head in self-deprecation.  “After Mycroft extracted me from Serbia and got me cleaned up, I told him to take me back to you on Baker Street.  When he told me you weren’t there, I… I wasn’t expecting that.  And then I went to find you, and you were in that restaurant in Marylebone, and you looked so handsome even with that stupid mustache, I felt like I couldn’t breathe.  But the moment I approached your table, I saw… I saw what you were there to do, to propose to someone, someone
“Oh… oh… oh… Sher… nnnngh, down, like this, shhh…” Seb presses Sherlock’s pelvis to the bed, and Sherlock cries out as his turgid cock comes into contact with the mattress.  No sooner has he acclimated to the sensation than Seb’s hands are slamming into the mattress on either side of Sherlock’s head, and he begins rutting against Sherlock’s arse with an animalistic intensity the likes of which Sherlock has never experienced before.
He shakes himself out of it before he can slide down that slippery slope.  His parents were just being
John’s thinking about all the beautiful, depraved things Sherlock lets him do to him, and Sherlock will glow and glow and glow so bright he may never stop.
He’s suspended here for a small eternity.  Because that’s what it is; a thousand lifetimes in the blink of an eye, an odyssey in a single breath.
“Augh!”  Sherlock’s orgasm hits him so hard and fast he cries out in surprise.  Victor’s head snaps to the side to watch him, and it’s with Victor’s eyes on him that Sherlock endures the longest, most intense orgasm of his life to date.
muddle together into a potent chemical cocktail, Sherlock’s response to which can range anywhere from hysterical sobbing to uncontrollable laughter.  John’s learned to roll with it, and Sherlock’s relieved to note there’s very little that can take John Watson by surprise during their post-coital routine anymore.  He simply holds Sherlock until he’s composed himself, running his fingers gently through Sherlock’s hair and making doting, amused humming sounds.
“...What?”  Sherlock feels suddenly, startlingly himself, and the bewilderment is evident in his voice.  He immediately wishes he could take the word back; it hadn’t been very respectful.
“WHY NOT?”  Sherlock can feel the indignation clawing up the back of his throat, threatening to choke him.
Well, damn.  Seems Sherlock was rather fond of the idea as well.  John mentally commends himself for his read on the situation, then lowers the lighter to ignite the wick.
So Sherlock volunteers to feed Rosie her dinner, read her some books, then get her ready for bed and put her down.  She’s in a shockingly complacent mood today, and the whole process takes Sherlock under 90 minutes-- he calculates he still has at least 20 before the risotto is done.
Sherlock can’t do anything but hold on for dear life, squeezing his thighs around John’s waist and squeezing the last few droplets from his spent cock.
Using every ounce of strength he can muster, he lifts his head and opens his eyes.  He licks his lips and swallows.  His mouth is dry and tastes like vomit.  He shudders.
John’s cock isn’t hitting his prostate directly, not quite, but it’s a deep and unrelenting pressure against his sweet spot that makes him feel agonisingly aroused without tipping him over the edge.  He can feel his own cocked trapped between John’s abdomen and his own, slick with precome as it twitches helplessly against John’s flexing abs.
John shrugs.  “I just didn’t know if it would be… enough.”  Sherlock narrows his eyes appraisingly.  “Like… if you’d be disappointed that I wasn’t… full-blown gay.”
But he can’t let himself get distracted.  In three strides, he’s back behind Sherlock, who arches and preens, eager for John’s attention.
“OH!  John, yes!”  Sherlock’s hands grab the sheets and twist, his shoulders flexing as John begins to ride him, pinning him helplessly to the mattress with the force of his thrusts.
“Shit.”  Aaron turns his attention back to his phone.  “Did you hear that?  Time is short.  Reddick’s got the team on the move to GreySphere HQ, but can you meet us at the bolthole to move the source?  I’ll text you the address… Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  See you there.”  He hangs up and tosses his phone on the nightstand, then strips off his t-shirt and sweatpants and rummages through his wardrobe, procuring a pair of denims and a sweater, hopping a bit awkwardly as he tugs them on.  Sherlock diplomatically averts his eyes.
with John.  Nothing else -- not lust, not alcohol, not drugs -- has ever made him feel this way before.  It’s a sense of peace that is utterly incomparable, and he basks in its reassuring glow.
Sherlock screams.  He cries and he wails and he kicks and thrashes, but none of it is any use; his Transport is completely immobilized, and John Watson is hellbent on having his way with his arse.
So it takes him rather by surprise when Sherlock all but throws him off, turns himself over, and attempts to scramble towards the edge of the bed.  John manages to catch him by the ankle and haul him backwards, but it’s not enough.  Sherlock flails weakly as John mounts him from behind, crying out loudly at the initial penetration.
They both pick up crayons and join Rosie in her colouring while they eat, Rosie babbling excitedly as they exchange pointed glances over the table, marveling at how quickly her vocabulary is expanding.  It’s astounding, really, and Sherlock finds himself completely caught up in the perfection of this moment, just their happy little family having a lovely lazy morning.
I know I already posted a warning about this, but just a friendly reminder to please read/heed the tags.  As most of you know, one of my biggest priorities is always promoting healthy power exchange practices and safe/sane/consensual behavior.  However, this chapter does not adhere to those standards; there are unsafe BDSM practices described in detail, and while it’s in no way intended to glorify this behaviour, the repercussions won’t be fully dealt with until later on in this piece.  Please know that they will be addressed, and if you’re concerned about reading this particular chapter, I’ve included a summary at the end in case you’d like to skip it and move on to the next.
spreads his legs for Sherlock.  He does, any time Sherlock asks, and he even offers it sometimes apropos of nothing (though Sherlock doesn’t usually take him up on the offer).  It’s just that Sherlock’s legs spread so
to think about it, but when he attempts to recall anything that’s happened since John left, he draws a blank.  “I… I don’t know.”  He hopes this doesn’t make John disappointed.
“Ahhh, I see what’s happened here.  Now that I’ve claimed you, put my come in you, got you back under my control, now you’re being all sweet and good for me, aren’t you?”
John steps forward and crouches down to be at eye level with Sherlock.  Sherlock lets out a pitiful whine, willing himself to stay focused while being taken so voraciously from behind.
Sherlock clambers to his feet rather more quickly than he ought to, and lets out a surprised yelp as the large plug shifts inside him.  He’d previously been curled into a semi-fetal position on his side, which he’d quickly discovered was the best way to take as much pressure off the plug as possible.  But now he’s on his feet, and the ache inside him is
delighted at the prospect of reclaiming his beloved firearm, practically skips out the door.  Sherlock gives Aaron a grateful wink before following in his wake.
“Um, yeah, sure, no worries…” Sherlock’s still clearly angry.  Great.  John takes a deep breath and tries to get his head on straight, but before he can say anything else, Sherlock has already disappeared out the door and down the stairwell.
Sherlock moans at the thought.  He loved the vibrating plug, it was probably his favourite toy in their arsenal, but he feels strangely wrung-out from his recent orgasm, and the thought of putting pressure against his prostate at the moment feels ill-advised.
John elbows his way over to the bar, doing his best not to feel like a geriatric grouch as he maneuvers through the sea of corporeal gyrations.  He grabs the bartop like a life raft, delighted to note that there’s an open stool not two feet to his left, which he gratefully collapses into.  Christ, this had been a stupid decision.
John arrives back home with Rosie looking a bit weary (he usually does after interacting with his mother; she’s a subtle but stern homophobe, and Sherlock knows it takes a lot out of John to be in her presence for any extended period of time), but he’s also brought ingredients for spring pea risotto, which he knows is Sherlock’s favourite.
He wants to bend him over the railing of the balcony and fuck him until he’s crying and screaming and begging for mercy, exposed for all the world to watch while John meticulously takes him apart, shattering his fucking aloof, untouchable facade.  He wants to hold him down and rip him apart until he’s incapable of speaking any word except John’s name, a plea and a benediction all in one.
“Mmm, lovely.  You look so pretty when you get hard just for me, you know that?”  John’s gaze is quickly morphing from
John crouches down and wraps his arms around Sherlock, doing his best to suss out exactly what was going on here.  “I love you too, sweetheart.  Are these happy tears, then?”  Sometimes following particularly intense sessions, Sherlock would become overwhelmed with emotion, having let his defenses be utterly obliterated in the process of submitting to John.  John had learned over the years that this could result in any number of seemingly inappropriate responses, from hysterical laughter to uncontrollable tears.
too provocatively at crime scenes when he knew John would be tempted to catch an eyeful, playing his violin with that sultry flourish that so often drove John to his knees to fellate him voraciously, sauntering about the flat in those feather-light t-shirts and low-slung pyjama bottoms that rendered John incapable of coherent thought…
Note that in this chapter Sherlock is abstaining from alcohol as part of his sobriety, while you may recall that in more recent years, he does imbibe socially.  I imagine that when Sherlock was in rehab in the mid-2000s, he was instructed in the Narcotics Anonymous version of sobriety, which prohibits the use of all substances including alcohol.  However, research on addiction & treatment over the past decade and a half have really changed the way people approach various forms of addiction and sobriety, and I imagine that Sherlock has found that alcohol is not triggering to his particular type of addictive personality.
“I have some scars on my back from an old injury.  They’ve been acting up a bit recently.  That’s all.”  It was the truth, after all.  Nothing to hide.
“And you do!  I mean, Christ, John, I thought last night was going pretty swimmingly up until you threw up everywhere.  You got off, I got off, we were both riding the high--”
John doesn’t want to be presumptuous, but really, Sherlock’s not leaving much room for interpretation here.  He clears his throat and shifts uncomfortably, depositing his tea on the end table.  “Do you… need my help with something?”
Victor presses the blunt head of his cock against Javier’s hole, and for a moment, Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat, his heart hammering in his chest.  Then Victor flexes his hips, and slips all the way inside.
Sherlock closes his eyes.  He hates it when John’s disappointed.  “Yes.”  He can feel tears welling up behind his eyelids.
sending Sherlock sprawling bodily onto the floor with such force it knocked the breath out of him.  He wailed and writhed in protest, legs splayed awkwardly to the sides as his feet scrabbled against the rug in an attempt to gain purchase, but to no avail.  John pounced forward and impaled him once more, gripping him forcefully by the shoulders and holding him down so hard his fingernails felt as if they would pierce Sherlock’s flesh.  Sherlock screamed at the fresh invasion and reared up on his forearms, resisting John’s force with all his might.
John rolls his eyes and delivers a lighthearted slap to Sherlock’s arse before resuming slicking up his own cock.  “You’re awfully cheeky for someone who’s rather at my mercy at the moment.”
“Were you honestly walking to town in this weather with just a jacket on?  Are you mad?”  Almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth, she’s shaking her head.  “Actually, forget I said that, I sound like my mum.”  She puts the car into gear and pulls back out onto the roadway.
He leans in as close as possible, gripping Sherlock firmly by the back of his neck, pulling him down so that John can speak directly into his ear.  “We’re leaving this instant.  You’ve been
“Oh, God.  Oh, God.”  Sherlock’s voice is barely a whisper as John begins to piston into his channel.  His knuckles are bone-white as his fingers clutch helplessly against the rough stone of the building.
All the other deductions he’d made about the room and his manner of restraint in it were correct, of course, but it never hurt to check one’s work. Curious, he glanced down at the handcuffs about his ankles. The second cuff of each set was attached to a leg of the metal folding chair on which he was seated, but they were fixed not only around the leg, but also about the metal bar that fixed one leg to the other. So tipping the chair wouldn’t guarantee escape. Mental note: adjust preliminary escape plans for new information.
Sherlock’s anesthesia should have worn off over twelve hours ago, but he still had not shown signs of regaining consciousness. Preliminary blood tests hadn’t shown any chemical to account for it, so brain scans had been ordered to verify that the consulting detective’s mind was indeed functioning. These had (to John’s unutterable relief) shown that Sherlock was, quite simply, asleep.  When faced with stimulation the wave patterns became characteristic of a wakeful person (or, as wakeful as could be expected on that quantity of pain medication), but still no exterior response. Everyone was puzzled, but it was agreed that no more be done until it was humane to tone down the pain meds. That would be a few days later, minimum.
“Yes, you average about twelve words per minute. Half the speed of the average prepubescent, but that has little bearing on our current investigation.”
For the first time in their interaction, Wilkes looked vaguely uncomfortable. “Well, most of them are subcontracted. Though almost all of them are thrilled to work here, the pay is better than overseas. And we do good work, our drugs help to save—”
So, he waited. That was boring, but the detective entertained himself by observing things about the room. There was nothing new to observe, of course, but that made it slightly more challenging.
“No one spends that long contemplating an empty box, and there are a finite number of things you would try to hide. Considering your military service, a gun wasn’t much of a leap.” Sherlock still had his eyes closed, the world apparently too boring to bear at the moment.
Sherlock gave John a look that could kill. Well, he still couldn’t open his eyes, so the effects were somewhat lessened, but it was still a look that could do some serious damage.
Sherlock twitched his head back toward the doctor, to which John responded, “Yes, I’ll tell you, but no real names. And you can’t go deducing the names either.” John lifted Sherlock off the seat and settled him against the side of the bathtub, before continuing, “Or, at least when you do, don’t go trying to contact them for verification or anything.”
Fine, then. No need for that particular family chat after my escape. Mycroft had a tendency to use such situations to attempt to guilt Sherlock into doing things, like taking boring cases for the government or attending family dinners.
John shook his head, unsure of how to respond. He settled on, “If we’re going to be spending four months together, you might as well call me John.”
“Well yes, except that this someone is almost definitely Moriarty, and that this is an attempt to run you ragged as well.” She nodded her head towards John’s pager. “Expect to be called in to deal with emergencies presently.”
More often than not the expression in question could be termed “annoyed.” Occasionally it moved into “slightly panicked,” but when that happened John would speak to him, would hold him, and things would be alright again. “Shhh,” he said, softly. “I know. But everything is going to be fine, I promise. I’ve got you.” Then, he would put Sherlock’s fingers over his pulse, and the detective would calm down.
It seemed that standard entrance procedure of an IP consisted of a minor medical procedure in which a thin plastic sac covered in tubing was inserted into the abdominal cavity, with a protrusion in the tubing inserted directly in to the patient’s circulatory system. The sac already contained the immature form of the drug to be produced, and hormones and nutrients (as well as chemicals ingested and/or injected for the purpose) diffused from the patient’s bloodstream converted this substance over time to the mature form. By the time this was accomplished, the sac’s external tubing, as well as its first layer of preservative coating, would have disintegrated away leaving the remaining vessel free-floating in the abdominal cavity. Without its preservative covering, the sac is recognized by the body as an irritant, causing the body to attempt to expel it. This eases removal surgery, the significantly more invasive procedure by which the sac of mature drug is removed. This product is the reason for Biopharm Limited’s existence; people pay thousands for just a few centiliters.
John settled his detective on the toilet seat, pyjama bottoms around his ankles. He was saved the trouble of wondering what to do next when Sherlock overbalanced and nearly fell forward, saved only by one of John’s hands. Which is how John ended up on his knees in front of the toilet, supporting his friend and pretending he was somewhere else while Sherlock was almost certainly doing the same.
Lestrade had gone home a few hours ago, promising to be back in the morning. Mrs. Hudson and Anthea, too, were both asleep, the former in her flat and the latter on John’s couch.
“The body has different ways of dealing with danger. One of them is to ignore it, leaving the mind free to face whatever situation until the danger has passed. Then, it hits you with everything it had been holding back whether it makes sense in the new context or not. Well, when someone hugs you, they’re doing their best to prove to you that you’re safe now, and promising that they’ll keep you that way.”
Now Moriarty’s lips were brushing Sherlock’s ear, and the hiss of madness was in his voice. “None of the useless wastes of life even thinking about Sherlock Holmes, whose mind could destroy them in an instant. No respect for what you are, what we are. You will see that they are useless, and you will join me as I take control.”
If John had thought Baker Street had been a war room before, it was a regular army base now. After only a few hours’ sleep, Mrs. Hudson was again on her computer downstairs, video files on the screen and city maps beside her as she cross-referenced CCTV footage. At least half of the cameras had blacked out seconds after Sherlock was loaded into the hijacked ambulance, but the remaining footage was good for confirming where Sherlock wasn’t. Detective Inspector Lestrade had settled himself at 221B’s kitchen table, listening in on a police scanner and calling in personal favors with his cell phone. After a lifetime on the force, there were a lot of favors to call in. Anthea was still on the couch, typing furiously and silently. One could almost think she was utterly uninvolved with their endeavor, except for the e-mails full of extremely pertinent information that kept appearing on John’s laptop. John, for his part, had taken up the table’s entire surface, covering it with notes, images, and anything else he could think of that pertained to Moriarty as he tried to turn their points of data into a cohesive narrative.
After Anderson finished his production of storming out in a huff, Lestrade turned to John. “Her help is worth it, right?” He indicated the vapid-looking young woman, who was still favoring ninety percent of her attention on the device beneath her thumbs.
And that was how the first-responders found them as they cleared the rubble away, letting the sun shine in to 221 for the first time in quite a while.

Harry received his Hogwarts letter. Then a wand, owl, and robes. He was then let lose in a magical book store all on his eleventh birthday. He was in heaven. Hagrid was happy with how well he was accepting magic into his life. He answered as many questions as he could. But what made Harry's birthday unforgettable was when he returned to Number 4.
He didn't even realize that he was choking the man to death until he was already dead... Until his body had hit the floor. The anger and hate had blinded him to what he was doing until it was far too late to take it back. He left the scene of the murder right after he had come back down to earth. He left the body on the ground, grabbed what he had used to choke the man, and went straight home... It wasn't until later that he realized that he had felt better than he had in years.
"Yes you do." John said, sounding a bit annoyed. "Whenever someone doesn't do what you what, or give you something, OR work fast enough for your liking, you attack them... Not just insult, attack."
"Really? Good for him... Everyone needs a break from London every now and again." Lestrade replied, with no small amount of sarcasm. Sherlock could look after himself, and besides, he had John with him now. Lestrade may not approve of many of Sherlock's people, The drugs dealers and street boys he paid to keep an eye and ear out for him; But John he liked. John was good for him.
And he was upset that he recently realized that his Uncle was cheating on his Aunt, more than likely with a woman from work...
It was hard for Harry to get anywhere the first few years. Whenever he would ask Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia about how things worked, they would always yell at him. "Don't ask questions!" or "They just do!"
It had been years and years since he had felt like this. Scratch that, possibly his entire life. His childhood was pathetic, to say the least, through no fault of his own. His teenage years were no better. His adult life had been livable... At least up until recently. His smirk fell as his face darkened with his thoughts.
As long as he kept his cool, all plugged-in devices and appliances should work as intended. The moment he'd let slip, lights would flash and glass would burst... Magic unleashed. And currently, he was pretty bloody upset.
Lestrade just growled in his own throat. Dimmock turned in his seat and snapped back at them, Hoping to shame them into silence.
