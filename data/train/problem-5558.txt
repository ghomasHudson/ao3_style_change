Phil looped an arm around Clint and turned off the lamp with his other hand. He knew Clint would tell him tomorrow. As long as Tony was physically okay, they could deal with his ever-lacking emotional health after some sleep. They all needed rest.
Tony rolled his eyes. He made a few hand motions that made a large holographic screen show up and a keyboard at his hands.
Steve was saying gently, quickly stripping him of the armor. JARVIS must have warned them, because someone was already returning with a replacement reactor. When Steve pulled out the old one, it was smoking, and Tony could smell the acrid smell of damaged wiring coming from him.
Tony reminded him. Steve didn’t have a chance to respond before the greetings and small talk of the night began.
Happy said with false cheer when Steve opened the car door. Happy of course brought one of the vans because he thinks of everything. Tony was pretty sure only he could hear the worry and relief laced through Happy’s voice.
he tried to keep it light, let Tony know it was okay if he didn’t want to, but toe the line so the man didn’t think he was being mocked.
he snapped as he sat down at the opposite side of the bar from the rest of them. He snatched the second pot of coffee and began drinking straight from the pot. The others just stared at him. Then he seemed to pause and remember something, so he lowered the pot from his mouth.
he screamed, pointing at Strange angrily. Strange went flying backwards, his head hitting the wall. Everyone sprang into action immediately.
She heard the man continue, and enough dirt must be on top of her by now that it covered the box completely, for she no longer heard the dirt hitting.  There was no holding back the instinctual panic that overtook her. Her lungs burned for air but the air around her was useless.
Tony pulled the man into a hug. That was news to him. He didn’t need to be told the underlying statement there. Steve remembered every horrific memory perfectly, too. Tony couldn’t imagine remembering every liberated holocaust camp Steve must’ve seen. He stood and held his hand out to Steve. It was time to get on their way. Steve didn’t need any more reminiscing right now, and Tony had work to do.
Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible.
Steve thought he had been prepared as he approached the woman, but when her hood and masked pulled back to reveal Natasha, he realized he hadn’t been. She was gasping in pain, and he could see the newly forming fangs from where he stood in front of her.
Natasha stood, pulling a folder from under the couch cushion, which was decidedly not weird for her. She kept things in random places.
Tony was beginning to think October was actually cursed for him. He didn’t believe in things like curses and magic (more like he ignored their existence until Strange was shoving them in his face) but this was just getting to be insane. Something spectacularly bad had happened in Tony’s like every October for the past… 20 years!? Maybe he had personally insulted the spirit of Halloween or something.
Clint tensed when Stephen touched his head and he had to actively relax. They met eyes and Clint nodded in response to the questioning look there.
While Steve agreed that they should always do what they could to make sure Peter didn’t succumb to toxic masculinity, it didn’t have to be right now.
Peter’s voice wobbled, but his tears didn’t spill over. None of the houses in sight looked familiar, and Peter couldn’t remember what street they had started on anymore. He should have never listened to Wade.
The quotes from the Digger (the serial killer) are from Edgar Allen Poe stories. The Digger is actually an existing character in the Marvel 616 universe, I didn't make him up. He had an interesting little debut in
Steve said. He followed Tony as the shorter man took off at a jog towards the cave. He probably was anxious to rest, Steve realized. It was easy to forget that not everyone had supersoldier stamina, and Tony was walking with a lot of extra weight and probably hadn’t slept much lately. Maybe tomorrow he’d be able to convince Tony to let him carry the suit, though he doubted Tony would acquiesce.
Natasha had been helping him learn to sneak better. He was already naturally light on his feet, plus he had the advantage of being light, but no one was better suited to sneaking than Black widow. Tony liked to think he had gotten pretty good. The tent made no sound as he exited, and he carefully avoided every leaf or twig as he approached the tree Clint was in. He looked up, studying his best chance, calculating lengths from one branch to another compared to his arm’s reach, as well as which branches could most likely hold his weight. Plan mapped out, he silently began the climb up the tree behind Clint’s. The archer wasn’t even scanning in the direction of the tent since they assumed that’s not where Bigfoot would be.
They entered through the front door, hands up, trying to keep the cops calm. Luckily, no one had taken a bullet yet, but the air in the bank was full of fear. The huddled six civilians were all crying and a couple were hyperventilating.
Tony stared at her in awe. This woman was a new breed of doctor he hadn’t dealt with before. Not even at SHIELD medical. He threw his hands up in a surrender.
Steve didn’t meet Tony’s eyes as he joined Tony sitting on the edge of the bed. When Tony wrapped his arms around the bigger man, the crying softened to some occasional sniffles.
Tony enjoyed eating with the team. He hadn’t realized he missed their family dinners. Clint and Thor were always up to hilarious antics. Tony gorged himself on the delicious food, though it didn’t take much. His stomach probably shrank again, which meant he had been accidentally starving himself again. Whoops. He watched Natasha throw soap foam all over Bruce while they did the dishes, enjoying the pure domestic joy he never thought he would get in life. How had Tony tricked these wonderful people into living with him? He didn’t deserve their love.
he asked like some sphinx in a story. He dodged the wrench Tony threw at him as he continued his loud cackling and left the lab. Tony’s thirst for revenge was completely rekindled. He was going to start planning for next year right now.
Thor said over the comms just before walking into the north entrance with Phil and a med team flanking him. Phil’s face was ghostly as he saw Clint, and Natasha thanked any gods there may be that he hadn’t been here for the horrifying screams. They backed away as the med team took over, knocking Clint out in order to keep him still so they could do what they needed to stabilize him on the way to SHIELD medical.
he began, taking a deep breath. He did already feel a little more grounded in reality. Emotional shock could be a bitch.
Even the small part of Tony that had believed the threat had expected whatever it was to begin subtly. No one was prepared for the loud snap of his right forearm and accompanying scream. He looked down at the arm where bone had broken the skin and there was blood and his arm should not bend that way and he had to turn away swallowing down a wave of nausea. Everyone had jumped up and was watching him intensely.
The vampire was predictably unconvinced. Just the idea of two bags of his blood filling at once made Tony feel a little nauseated. It had to be psychological, he hadn’t lost enough yet to feel anything.
As he drew closer to the crates of his back up smaller reactors, he noticed that both lids were torn off and left on the ground beside them. He hurried his steps. If the reactors had been stolen, they were all in a world of trouble.
he ground out at the others. Hulk had to fight himself for a moment, turning back into Bruce to fit through the slowly shrinking portal. With him through, all that was left was him and Strange. They were both balancing against each other at this point.
There's some moments that could have been smutty, and allude to sex, but I didn't write any here. There just isn't time for it in these short chappys when I'm writing a new one every day.
So what better time to try it out than October? It was the most stressful month of his year because he had so much to do. This could ease his life tremendously if he didn’t need to sleep. He was going to actually get everything done by their deadlines this year!
He remained standing, leaning against the wall despite the intense desire to fall into a heap on the ground. He coughed up blood, but as soon as he had his breath back he looked at the Mandarin straight on.
The Avengers shared a look as they all stifled a laugh. Peter attempting to comfort the god of thunder because he thought Thor needed it was one of the cutest things in the world. Steve looked down when he felt his shirt being tugged.
He had found a range of only a few days where the steady increase of incidents had started. The likelihood of incident was exponentially increasing and it had started sometime about four weeks ago. After he narrowed down the data to sift through his brain had done the thing. He frowned, annoyed at all of it.
Steve admonished, but his voice was amused, not angry. It was a habit Tony had tried and failed to break many times. Tony laughed and waved it off.
If it sounded like Tony was desperately questioning God instead of asking JARVIS why Strange was there, well that would be because he wasn’t even sure which he was doing.
Tony tapped the end call button with absolutely no guilt. He was in a bout of insomnia anyway, so he wouldn’t be sleeping, and he never got to go on long drives anymore. What was the point of having his amazing car collection if he didn’t get to drive them? A night alone on empty highways was peaceful.
He shrugged. Explaining out loud did make him feel better. It was surprising. Right, talking was better than drinking and avoidance. JARVIS told him that all the time, not that Tony ever listened.
Mr. Doll seemed to be satisfied with the number of injuries for a while, occasionally digging around in the wound again. Once, Tony had stopped breathing altogether for a whole minute, twitching with the effort to take in air, but unable to and clutching at his chest. Steve had had a moment of terror thinking that might be their final moment. Tony had held his gaze, eyes wide with terror as they all heard the monitors screeching their alerts. When he finally gasped and arched up off the bed suddenly, Steve had nearly fainted with relief.
There is injection of drugs in this, it's not an addiction situation, but be wary of your own triggers.
He felt a wave of desire course through him when the supersoldier stepped out. Steve was wearing a royal blue shirt with baby blue pin stripes, and a gold tie. The blue brought out his eyes beautifully, and Tony was surprised to admit the gold tie looked good. Gold fabric tended to look tacky in Tony’s opinion.
Tony ran through the other avengers in his head, deciding which one was least likely to rat him out. Bruce was too much of a goody two-shoe. Coulson would probably go directly to Steve if not Dr. Stein and Fury. Thor wasn’t in the tower right now, and Tony was fairly sure Thor didn’t know what sneaking was. Natasha would probably just beat him up for being an idiot. That left Clint.
He couldn’t have been gone more than twenty minutes. It was a short walk to the apothecary, and the woman always let him in late. They had become friends over the years. So when Frank rounded the corner, the blazing fire that had engulfed his home made no sense. The fire hadn’t been anything more than embers when he left.
Steve felt sick. Tony had to continue to endure this agony for hours. Steve returned the hospital room where the center of his universe was squirming in bed. Tony watched him sit down beside the bed, dried trails of salt on his cheeks where he had been crying. Steve didn’t know what to do. How could he help? He wished fervently that he could switch places with the genius.
Strange made a circular motion in the air with one hand, the other stretched out in front of the circling hand, aiming the magic similarly to the armor’s repulsors. A glowing blue circle formed in front of him, with black swirling within it. It grew until it was about the size of the elevator door.
Tony was pushing away from a work table to face the blond as he entered the lab. The table had a large silver case on it with a keypad lock. Steve idly wondered what Tony felt needed locked up in the safety of his own lab, that already had ample security, but Tony’s predatory smile was distracting. He stood, gesturing for Steve to come to him. Steve’s feet moved of their own accord while he focused on the beautiful man in front of him.
Tony snapped a photo of the nonsensical chart painted on one of the walls. He turned back to face his friend again.
It was the word alone that had been echoing through his head all day, making his chest ache. He was no use like this, though. He had to turn off his feelings, a skill he was rusty at, since he hadn’t really needed it since WWII. He took a deep breath, allowed one last fleeting thought of worry and guilt, then let it all go and became the soldier Tony and his team needed. That’s what Steve was good at, transforming into whatever was needed.
Strange stood, easily taking over the focus of the room. His appearance blurred and shifted into his usual clothing, and Clint couldn’t help but think he was just showing off.
Clint said gently, slipping his hand into Phil’s and leaning on the wall beside him. Phil looked at him carefully, searching his face.
The jet came to a nearly silent landing, and they all filed out quickly. The door made a soft hiss behind them, sounding loud compared to their quiet feet. Natasha began giving orders for where she wanted people positioned while Thor swung his hammer in circles, gaining momentum for takeoff. The electricity in the crisp night air was palpable and Clint could smell the dough from the pizza place down the street.
He assumed she must be convinced, because she deftly replaced the ship’s broken parts and pulled out a wire with an adaptor the reactor could plug into. She stared at it in her hand.
The rest of Tony’s obvious scars were ones Clint knew about, things that had happened since the Avengers Initiative began.There were other smaller ones, but they might as well be invisible next to the chest piece. Clint realized he had been staring, and looked up to see Tony watching him nervously.
Tony gulped involuntarily. Anyone else and he’d be his usual self goddamnit. He took a shaky breath.
Peter finished big, raising his fists in a victorious stance. Tony stood in shock behind him while the rest of his family erupted into applause.
They leaned in for another, longer kiss, and Clint’s monitor didn’t do anything annoying, why can’t Tony have nice kisses? Not that Clint was all that better, because when Phil moved to separate them, he tried to follow, only to be painfully reminded of the wound. He let out a long groan.
He looked at all of them, and each of them relaxed, but not completely. This kind of life made all of them on edge at all times.
Steve said as he pulled off Tony’s jacket and his shirt, gently folding them and setting them aside.
There was no time, JARVIS closed the suit and launched after the scarecrow figure. Scarecrow hesitated, clearly surprised that anything was approaching him at all, but he dodged the suit just in time. This guy was getting faster and stronger by the minute, and JARVIS could only conclude that he somehow fed on the fear around him.
It seemed like ages had passed when the burning stopped spreading up his legs. Tony focused on the pain, because that at least meant his nerves were intact. He stared at the Mandarin’s hands, waiting for the next attack patiently. What the Mandarin didn’t realize was that although this would haunt Tony’s nightmares for years to come and give him unwanted flashbacks, in this moment Tony could handle any of it. He could turn off parts of his mind so that it wasn’t all so overwhelming. That was how Tony never gave in to torture.
Stephen Strange was standing in the common room waiting for the team to assemble three hours later. His hands were clasped behind his back. Clint was pretty sure the man was glowing, but that could also be his eyes playing tricks. He needed sleep.
Clint started defensively. That mission hadn’t gone according to plan, but they had followed all protocols and there was no way they could’ve known they would be ambushed by the Hand while trying to take out the Ten Rings leader.
he broke off into a cry as the skin on his feet started to boil. The Mandarin laughed maniacally and slowly baked Tony’s legs, following him as he squirmed. As Tony tried to fall out of the chair to get away, a white light started glowing along with the red coming from the Mandarin’s hand, making Tony somehow heavier and pinning him to the chair.
Steve noticed the lack of details and the time delay between Tony going to bed and JARVIS’ notification, but he wasn’t about to question JARVIS. He was probably just doing what Tony wanted, because Tony obviously didn’t want to see or talk to Steve. He tried not to let that sting, but it did.
Tony waited a solid ten seconds to see if Steve had more. When he didn't continue, it was time to set this nonsense to rest.
He put the book down, and Tony tilted his head to see the title. Huh. Tony would not have expected Steve to be reading
Tony caught the demon off guard with  the repulsor blast that hit his face. 19%. It didn’t seem to do too much damage, but it did break his concentration enough for Strange to escape the spell, gasping for air. Nightmare tumbled in the air a moment before righting himself, now glaring at Tony. Tony had no idea how the armor would hold up to magic. Luckily he didn’t have to find out, because Strange shouted a very foreign sounding word, and a projected rope tied the demon up tight, and he struggled against the bounds to no avail.
Tony shouted again, stepping away from the crates and slowly continuing his circle around the main reactor.
Pepper had said that he couldn’t protect Tony from everything, and she was right. But that didn’t help his guilt. Tony knew how the team deals with injuries and illness; the member takes medical leave until either they feel better or the team deems them needed too badly. That’s how it worked for everyone, they had all agreed on it after the Chitauri invasion. But Tony consistently risked it all unnecessarily. This guilt wasn’t about just this one time.
Yes, I used that old character Mr. Doll that died back in the 70s. Because I'm that person, so deal with it.
Two years later, no one was thinking about the Digger. He was old news, and New York city was never short on new crime to report on. So when the man escaped from prison, nobody thought that maybe Jessica, Matt, and Foggy should be the first people to know. The serial killer did blame them for being put behind bars, especially Jessica. Instead, they found out on the news with everyone else. Jessica was at a bar and saw it on the tiny TV. Luke was helping a friend move by doing all the heavy lifting, so Jessica had taken the opportunity for a solo night. Being engaged was great and all, but she needed some time alone sometimes.
Tony looked at him petulantly for a moment, contemplating continuing his list of ways to sabotage Loki anyway. Steve just raised an eyebrow at the man, knowing what he was probably thinking. Tony huffed, giving up.
Thor boomed, holding out a mug towards Steve in the manner of giving a toast. Steve smiled tiredly at him. Sometimes, Thor liked to deliberately be over the top with his language, and they all knew it. He could blend in just fine when he wanted, but the shakespearean vibe was part of his charm.
It was a good enough plan. She had the security of a bunker. Her own apartment would be a terrible idea. She and Luke had agreed that they didn’t need any intense locks considering how hard they were to hurt. Plus they were too poor for good security, but their life was fine for them.
stamped over his face in red ink. He was wearing a robe that was somehow billowing around him as if he were in a windstorm, but he was obviously in a closed room. He had a hand raised above his head and rings on every finger, an eerie glow emanating from them. It reminded him all too much of Loki’s scepter and Dr. Strange’s magic. He hated magic.
Steve was rooted to the spot. There was no mistaking that voice. Vlad Dracula was using his friend as a puppet.
Mr. Doll, Nathan Dolly, was run over by a semi-truck the next week. No one would ever know the connection between the events.
Tony may have his flaws and vices, but most of them were the fault of the people around him who should have taught him better. Of course he bore some responsibility, but he is a genuinely good man. Tony had had to learn how to deal with the hardships of life all by himself at too young an age, save for his butler Jarvis. No wonder he named his AI after Jarvis. That was the closest he got to a parental figure, and that was so little because Jarvis had too many other duties to attend to. Tony’s unhappiness with life, his alcoholism, his awful childhood; the causes always eventually could be traced back to Steve. Steve couldn’t blame him for being so harsh when they first met; not after he realized all of that.
he was in less pain now, and he wondered if it had an anesthetic in it as well. Any movement in his torso and weight on his leg still cause sharp pain from the embedded bullets, but small victories.
Steve took a deep breath. Then he let it out slowly. They could discuss this without screaming. He was determined. They were adults.
So I thought of Gazing Nightshade, who admittedly is a fairly new character from X-Men Blue I think, and her name was not even in ao3s character list yet, but she's got such a cool design. Also the required black eyes. He power is basically making you feel lots of angst lol.
his voice monotone. This was a stupid contest, he shouldn’t be this upset about it. Stupid Tony Stark being oversensitive when he loses a stupid game because his plans are stupid. And the world called him a genius? Boy, had he fooled everyone. He was never going to get revenge on Clint.
He quickly swept away the extraneous tables he had created leaving the mess a little less cluttered.
The hair on the back of everyone’s necks raised with the energy in the room. Clint looked around for any sign of tech causing the change, but his sharp gaze caught nothing. This was most likely not a con. There was a moment of unnatural stillness and quiet before the crystal ball in the center filled with a milky white swirl that slowly morphed into a face.  The face was pale and gaunt, and it seemed familiar, but Clint couldn’t place it. The odd warping of its dimensions by the globe and the fact that there was no body attached made it take longer for him to recognize. That was his mother.
he trailed off. Steve knew what he meant anyway. Someone was going to get killed if this kept up. All it took was the right slip up in the field, and the team could be dropping like flies.
His head ached. Tony wasn’t sure what they drugged him with, but he hoped it wasn’t too dangerous. Pepper knew better than to take coffee from another employee before giving it to him. She knew any food items had to come through high security clearance personnel before it could be handed to Tony. It was only a logical policy to have given his history with assassination attempts as well as… yep, you guessed it, kidnappings!
Clint and Natasha suddenly turned on each other. Natasha was accusing Clint of being controlled by Loki again, and Clint was talking about Russian sleeper agents. Steve rolled over to stand in front of the civilians and guarding them from bullets with a trash can, as though that would do them any good.
Slamming the man onto the same nearby table where he hat set the tray, Steve sent several glasses flying off the table or rolling and smashing loudly on the ground. A woman somewhere screamed.
Steve began. They were all standing in the gym wearing vests Steve had brought. Tony rolled his eyes.
They walked along a stone path. It was agreed that flying would make finding their way to Castle Nightmare harder, since the sky was chaotic, but the paths each led there if you followed them on foot. Tony scanned the environment as they walked. The sky, if one could call it that, was a yellowish-orange with random blobs of black rolling through it. Paths of rock criss-crossed through it, seemingly at random, but were all suspended in the air, and Tony could find no actual ground far below. The colours just went on forever in every direction. Flying gargoyle like creatures flew by in small groups, but ignored them. Boulders with glowing purple stones on the outside would zoom by like meteorites, narrowly missing collision with the path, or Steve once.
The figure looked up, her hoodie falling back to reveal a teenage girl, probably of some mix of asian descent, with her hair in high pigtails. She made no move towards the car, but watched him from afar. Her head tilted slightly. Tony guessed, in fairness, it probably wasn’t in a teenage girl’s best interest to get into strange men’s cars without a little hesitation. He wondered if she had a cell phone, and why she hadn’t called for help, though they were on a country road in the middle of nowhere. Non-Stark phones probably didn’t have signal out here.
Bruce knelt at Strange’s side, checking for a pulse, and Steve rolled the armor over, finding the latch for the face plate with muscle memory.
Tony could see why the email had made it past his security department. Everything was worded in such a way that there was no outright ‘I’ll get you’ or ‘you’re gonna die’ kind of message. The subject and message both were polite.
he snapped. Tony watched him leave with a perverse satisfaction. At least he always succeeded at pushing people who wanted to help away. It was his best talent.
Bruce cursed himself inwardly for assuming someone had already explained the situation. Of course they hadn’t, Tony had only been home for one night, and that night had consisted of him getting drunk alone in the lab.
He gestured for Tony to take a seat in it, even though Tony was sure the dick knew he wouldn’t be able to get himself into it. Tony thought it best to humor him, so he attempted to stand, using the chair for support, but as he stretched out to reach the chair, his ribs were having none of it and he fell back with a hiss. The Mandarin laughed gleefully and grabbed Tony by the neck, slamming him into the chair. He kept his hand around Tony’s throat longer than necessary, smiling darkly as Tony feebly scratched at his hands, desperate for air. Tony was shocked at how strong the man was on top of everything else; why had he had other people doing his dirty work? He could have killed Tony himself a long time ago.
Happy had picked Tony up from the hospital or SHIELD medical too many times to not know about Tony’s illogical need for a greasy cheeseburger after an injury. Unfortunately, Captain stick-up-his-butt always had to ruin the fun.
Tears streamed down his face. Tony’s seizure was slowing until he was mostly still, his limbs twitching every few seconds.
Tony had tried to warn Hawkeye, he saw the opening Clint had left but his shouted warning was too late. He scanned the battlefield, and Tony was the closest to his fallen friend. He landed beside Clint fighting off three bots that were closing in. Iron Man knelt down, pulling Clint’s shaky hands away from the wound to inspect it. He couldn’t do much with enemies still everywhere, so he scooped the man up and took off for the nearest empty rooftop. The man was already too pale.
Steve had watched the silent exchange. It was hard to tell what went on between the two of them sometimes, though not as impossible as it had been between Clea and Strange for a while. The Avengers didn’t see much of Clea after their divorce, though, and Strange had mentioned something about her not needing him anymore while drunk at last year’s Christmas party. He hoped whatever conversation had passed between the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange was good news for Tony. The struggling brunette looked like his strength was beginning to wane. Steve leaned forward and brushed the sweaty locks out of Tony’s eyes. Tony looked away from Wanda then, and shared a small smile with Steve.
Tony squeezed his hand painfully with the sudden show of pain. Steve couldn’t help the distressed sob that escaped him. Tony was comforting him when Tony was the one suffering. Steve brushed the sweat soaked hair away from Tony’s forehead.
Bruce never stopped walking towards him as he spoke, but Tony kept their distance, circling the table.
Steve didn’t know what set off his alarm bells, but he was sure enough of himself to be okay with making a scene. He snatched the tray from the man’s hands and placed it on a nearby table. People close by started watching the strange exchange. Steve then grabbed the man’s arm and twisted it painfully behind his back.
the questions spilled out of his mouth, the words barely making it out in full before the next word came tumbling out. Steve had had the questions running circles in his head all night after all.
The red ring was on his left index finger, Tony finally caught this time. It looked like four capsules that blasted out heat, and Tony saw the orange light in his periphery before he realized in horror that his shirt was on fire. His legs were pinned to the chair, and his arms felt like they were 50 pounds each. He struggled to try and get the flaming clothing off, but not only were his arms heavy but the sleeves were caught on the chains. Pieces of his shirt started falling to the ground in flaming tatters, allowing Tony to escape the hellish heat. At this point every movement made his nerve endings scream and his skin feel like it would crack open, especially on his back. As he had been slouching forward trying to get the shirt off, the flaming fabric hadn’t been touching the front of his torso directly.
The medics were quick to take over, examining Tony as they loaded the stretcher into the helicopter. Steve didn’t want to leave Tony’s side, but there was definitely no room for him on the small chopper. He watched them take off before turning to find which SHIELD agent would drive him to the hospital. Tony would be fine. Tony was getting help, he’d be fine. There just wasn’t another option.
Steve returned with a light sheen of sweat. Natasha noticed he always seemed to run harder October mornings. He also exercised more in general. Her theory was that Steve needed to let off extra steam and distract himself more constantly to ward off feeling lonely while Tony was squirreled away in his lab. The supersoldier usually had unfettered access to Tony’s domain and spent hours just watching the genius work or sketching him, but not in October. Tony had forbid him because his ‘ass was too distracting.’
He ducked just in time at Clint’s warning, and the boulder flew over his head. There had been no air movement or noise to warn him, so his reflexes were useless.
Phil draped his tie over an open drawer beside their bed, quietly changing out of his suit so he could relax around the tower.
At Natasha’s count they all crashed in at once, and the men took a few moments to get a handle on the fact that they were being attacked. The Avengers took advantage of this. Hulk knocked everyone away from the corner of guns, his fists sending men flying into tables and walls where a lot of them didn’t get back up. Steve took out several men with the first throw of his shield, catching it just in time to deflect a bullet and knock out two men who had made the mistake of getting close to him. Natasha took down everyone along the east balcony in a manner of minutes before the north side guys noticed she was there. Murdock was having a similarly easy time with the upper lever flock.
JARVIS spoke loudly. Tony startled away from the precipice of sleep, and fell gracelessly into a heap on the floor. He groaned.
he moved so quickly that Tony wasn’t sure what happened. He blinked one moment, and the next the vampire had his throat and Tony was fighting to breathe.
Scarecrow-AKA Ebenezer Laughton- has been a repeat villain for multiple Avengers for a long time, but he didn't actually have any powers until he received them from Firm in
After they had left, Clint let Phil rub his shoulders for another minute or so before shrugging him off.
It was a good point. Tony looked at Steve’s gorgeous, sad eyes. He had made Steve sad, again. Hurting Steve was never his intention for anything.
Dracula with Hulk’s power was a worst nightmare. When the man dropped Steve and began screaming in pain, Tony nearly fainted with relief. He was a very understanding man, but dating a vampire Steve might’ve been too much, even for him. Though maybe he could get into blood play… He shook away the thought.
I think blood moons are pretty, and this was a nice little excuse to write a fluffy one-shot. I think I was actually successful at writing fluff for once! I usually get so angsty by accident. Let me know what you think!
he shouted over his shoulder. It was that time of year again. The Avengers all knew by now that seeing Tony at all was a rare occurrence in October. The man practically worked non-stop for a month straight.
Tony broke the silence. He was too scared to look at Steve. He didn’t think he could handle the disappointment and betrayal bound to be there.
she said quietly. She couldn’t keep a hint of sadness out of her tone. Something was obviously eating at the man, fueling the erratic behaviour. The problem was he never talked to any of them about his thoughts.
He pitched forward suddenly, hand automatically grasping at his chest with the sudden tightness and sharp pain, but he breathed through it, and it slowly lessened.
he trailed off, looking a little more grim. Steve waited to hear the rest but Strange must have decided not to say whatever it was. Steve sighed in relief as he felt warmth slowly wash over him from head to toe and he could finally stop shivering.
Clint said, throwing another paper airplane at Loki’s head. Loki let it phase through him, not even sparing the archer a glance.
By the time the castle was in view, Tony was a little over 50% power remaining. The reactor did not seem to be charging; just his luck.
Steve and Natasha were learning a lot. Neither of them had ever noticed that they used their hearing so much to avoid attacks. Both were dodging far less than usual, and it only validated to Steve that this was a good idea. Natasha caught his eye when Steve smiled proudly to himself. ‘Happy with yourself?’ she mouthed, one eyebrow quirked.
The two officers were trained well. They handled most situations calmly, only firing their weapons as a last resort. Officers Johnny and Hal shared a look, both agreeing that they had no choice when the short brunette tumbled out of the metal suit. That light on his chest looked like an explosive device, and the man would not stand down no matter how many times they asked. The two guns fired simultaneously, and the world seemed to slow down when the assailant froze, eyes wide before crumpling to the ground.
she asked quietly. Steve couldn’t hear her or anything, the wind carrying away voices that weren’t shouts long before they traveled across the small gaps between people, but he could read her lips well enough. They stared at each other for a moment before Steve nodded, and allowed her to pull him inside. The others must have already gone to medical, for they were nowhere to be seen, but Natasha settled onto a wall beside Steve in a back hallway. She waited patiently for Steve to break the silence.
Tony pulled the stupidly grinning Steve off his knees and into a kiss. The audience went wild and their host was saying something about happy couples and a commercial break, but all the two men cared about was each other. Tony swore he could feel Steve’s heartbeat thrumming through him. Steve smiled against his lips, trying to pull back, but Tony clutched the man’s jacket tight. Steve would not escape him that easily.
Natasha finished her martini. The team was sitting around the room in various positions and levels of drunkenness as they listened to the explanation of ‘Boaire,’ a playground game in Russia. After movie night ended, which was the new iteration of
Tony felt no change, but was slowly aware that he was back home. He groaned, looking down at the reactor. It was no longer flickering, and he was slowly catching his breath.
Tony turned to see Steve enter the room, swaying enough that Steve thought he’d fall off. Tony scowled when he saw who it was.
Steve loved the lopsided smile Tony had, his real smile. How could anyone really expect him to keep quiet when people harassed the man? Tony was a hero and Steve’s best friend. They might even be bordering on something more, with the flirtatious dance they’d been doing around each other lately. Steve thought he’d probably like that. He would be a great boyfriend for Tony. He’d shower him with all the love and adoration the man deserved.
The effect wasn’t immediate. Tony had figured at first that he had made the right choice to be nice, because the stranger stood with his help and placed a hand on his shoulder in a friendly-seeming gesture. The man’s smile was creepy because of the width of it, but Tony had met aliens before. Maybe this species would think Tony’s small mouth was creepy.
Tony felt tears streaming down his face but couldn’t grasp where he was. His head hurt so much, and his mind seemed to be in a fog. He tried to chase a thought down, something about not saying something, when he went back under.
Jane said softly. Her lips were stained with blood but Thor didn't care anymore. He bent over and kissed her gently.
he murmured, head down. He had almost certainly ruined the party, and had definitely embarrassed Tony in front of the business world.
They came upon a small clearing that seemed as good a spot as any and wordlessly agreed to set up camp. That finished, Clint’s stomach decided it was the perfect time to rumble.
Every breath hurt. It was surreal to just let a wound bleed freely, but he had noticed the way his hand had done nothing to lessen the leakage. The only plus side was that the stabbing pain definitely distracted him from the pain of his broken bones. The pain increased immeasurably for a moment, and Tony distantly knew those were his screams, but all he could focus on was the feeling that someone was twisting and digging a finger around in his side, but there was no one there. When the sensation finally disappeared, his chest was heaving as he tried to breathe normally again. Little by little, he was able to slow his gasps.
Peter bit his lip, a slight blush colouring his cheeks, and Wade wished he didn’t have those goggles on. He wanted to look his best friend in the eyes to see what he was thinking. Without explaining himself, Peter suddenly whipped out his phone and turned it off.
There it was, a flash of guilt and pain across Steve’s face, gone in a split second. Clint was trained to see micro-expressions like that, or he probably wouldn’t have caught it.
Exactly 48 hours after the first email, the second one arrived. The string of nonsense making up the sending email was different, but JARVIS picked it out because of the similar tone and the signature ‘A Citizen in Need.’ If JARVIS had eyes, he’d roll them. Clearly this person was in so much need, that’s why they were asking for $2M with the technology to hide their IP address instead of panhandling on the streets. Everyone knew Tony Stark was a philanthropist, that his money helped plenty of actual citizens in need through the Maria Stark Foundation, but this guy chose to threaten his master for money instead.
The possible medium/mutant’s accent was something neither Phil nor Clint could place. It didn’t sound put-on, in fact, it sounded like she was trying to hide it, so it was most likely real. That alone piqued the SHIELD agents’ interests because there were very few places in the world where they wouldn’t recognize the accent. As she took a seat, the lights in the room dimmed, and Clint glanced around to see that Zelma was at the switch.
he asked. He considered it a small victory that he didn’t sound frightened. This man emanated power in a way similar to Dr. Strange, only he wasn’t on Tony’s side; it was terrifying.
Steve said loudly over the bustle, and Dr. Nicholson looked at him sharply. A shock with the defibrillator brought Tony back to a normal rhythm, and Dr. Nicholson ordered him sedated for the time being.
Thor started swinging his hammer to gain momentum, staring the cowardly magician down. The magician smiled and he couldn't wait to wipe the grin off that face but a voice stopped him.
The house looked like an average middle-income family house on the outskirts of New York. There were two stories, a small porch with narrow stairs framed by two white pillars, and a white and faded sky blue paint job that was flaking. It was technically a duplex, attached to the address next door. Watching Strange climb the small steps before them, Clint was hit with how bizarre the man looked in normal clothing. He realized he’s never seen the sorcerer without his cloak or the Eye of Agamotto hanging from his neck, though that was probably still there, just tucked under the sweater. It was an odd reminder that Stephen Strange had lived a whole life before becoming a sorcerer.
Steve still hadn’t said anything, and Tony knew that was always a bad sign. He was usually the first busybody in these conversations going on and on about how Tony needed to take care of himself.
Natasha asked. This was either the work of someone with cloaking capabilities, someone who could shrink like Ant-Man, or magic. The first two should be detected by JARVIS. The last would mean they should call Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch immediately.
Steve clenched his fists until his nails were digging into his palms. Tony already had a bad heart, what if it was too damaged now? Tony would never be okay with taking it easy for the rest of his life. Being Iron Man was too important to him. Despite Steve’s best efforts, Tony refused to believe he had any value in the world beyond being a hero. He conveniently ignores his stunning intellect and overflowing generosity that makes the world a better place.
There wasn’t enough time to break down. There was barely enough time to plan, and they didn’t even have an idea for a plan. It was too much.
Tony handed Steve one of the sticky pieces of baklava, and grabbed one for himself. They were sticky but had a flaky crust of some sort that surrounded the… honey? That’s what it smelled like. Tony was watching him expectantly, he realized, waiting for Steve to try it. Steve took a small bite, and an involuntary sound of pleasure came from him.
Tony held out his hand, and Strange took it. The truce handshake was something Steve had forced them to do a while back, but it stuck when they got into these spats. While the two often acted like they disliked each other, they did have a mutual respect for the other’s expertise. Plus Tony liked the man when they weren’t talking magic. They got along fine, then.
Bruce was scrawling things down silently for a few moments. Bruce stood and grabbed a few water bottles from the fridge before turning to look at Steve seriously.
The ride to the hospital was quiet, but not awkward. Steve and Phil were unfortunately used to this. Dating the two team members who got injured the most was an emotionally taxing lifestyle. Neither of them were sure they could continue of they didn’t have each other to lean on.
Exiting the gym, he decided he should probably come up with a strategy. Tony had wasted the first precious fifteen seconds of their head start, and despite the fact that this whole thing was stupid, he did hate losing. And when a game had only one winner, there was a high chance of losing. Knowing Bruce, and his walking speed, he’d probably be on this floor for a while. Tony’s best bet was to get to the farthest floor possible.
He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve’s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian’s voice. The orchestral part didn’t move much, so it made more sense to set one’s movements to the woman’s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve’s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn’t matter. They’d get over it when the regular modern music returned.
Schmidt reasoned. If Dracula could consider himself a fan of anything, it was reason. He was a scientist.
Schmidt flinched, but to his credit, he didn’t back away. An angry Dracula was a scary sight. The Red Skull needed to change tactics, make this worth it for the vampire count.
Tony said quietly. J knew to call in the others for a code green. Hulk could do a lot of damage quickly, and the suit was often not enough to subdue him. He raised his right hand, shooting a weak repulsor directly at Hulk’s face. The more Iron Man could piss him off, the easier it’d be to lure him away from the valuable evidence they had collected.
No one had warned Loki not to try anything in October, apparently. Tony spent every October in a month-long manic episode working non-stop. The genius did not react well to distractions from his work. Steve thought it was a bit much. Tony was probably exaggerating when he explained how many new inventions the board demanded of him every November.
Whatever the sorcerer did, it worked, because Nightmare screamed out in pain, and the lock on the cage housing the children disappeared.
Tony was still out cold, which was good. Steve wasn’t ready to talk to him yet. He didn’t know what he would say to him. At least he knew he had time to think of something. He wasn’t even angry, which surprised him. He wished Tony would have said he was feeling sick like he promised, but it was getting old. Steve just felt guilty, and tired and dead inside. The more he went over the events of yesterday in his head, the more confident he grew in the fact that the entire thing was his fault.
Steve asked, pulling Tony into his arms. Tony didn’t respond, but nodded into his husband’s chest. Steve let him cry for a little longer.
he murmured. There was no more need for talk, though, because Tony was devouring his mouth hungrily, and Steve was pulling their shirts off quickly. God, he loved this man.
Thor happened to be there too, talking animatedly about some Netflix show to Phil. For the agent’s part, he was just nodding everytime Thor raised his voice in excitement, an amused expression on his face. Clint and Nat were sprawled out on a mat, too tired to continue sparring. None of them bought Bruce’s story until he had Jarvis show them the list himself. It was hard to wrap their heads around. Thor was the most unwilling to accept the idea.
The small circles Steve was tracing between his shoulder blades helped. He waited until his shuddering breaths that came with silent crying returned to a more level cycle.
Everyone fell into easy conversation. No one delved into anything that could be remotely heavy or upsetting, and Tony felt particularly coddled as the day went on. The fog of being drugged slowly lifted, and Clint’s morphine was clearly wearing off. The archer grew less talkative and resorted to listening, wincing every time he laughed. Tony could think of nothing more forced than the interactions that took place when one was stuck inside a hospital. Being in jail was probably similarly fake, but Tony, luckily, wouldn’t know.
Tony heard the lab open, but had no interest in lifting his head off his work table to see the intruder.
the genius growled. The flex cage had apparently attacked a lamp. A lamp that was somehow attached to faux feet covered in purple socks. How the fuck had the man seen through his plan? Or avoided the spiders? Even though Clint clearly set off the trap on purpose with the lamp, the spiders should still have frightened him. Where was the birdbrain anyway?
he reached down and tickled Tony, startling him. Tony squawked, nearly falling off the seat, but Steve caught him, chuckling. Bastard.
The tinny voice of Iron Man held no hint of mercy. Ebenezer Laughton felt his own fear take over, making it much harder to control the pheromones around him and keep the room in its panic.
It was so quiet in the hallway, since it was just past 3:30 in the morning. Steve took a steadying breath and opened the doors. His eyes landed on Tony immediately, looking haggard and exhausted in bed. There were IVs sticking out of his left hand and one in the same arm. The oxygen tube was hooked in his nose and his breathing was steady. Steve found himself matching Tony’s breathing as he sat in the chair on Tony’s right. He looked so small and fragile.
Norman Osborn had become a consistent thorn in Tony’s side ever since SI’s departure from weapons development. While Hammer had always fancied himself Tony’s rival in weapons, Tony knew he had been no real competition. Osborn, in contrast, was actually competent and Oscorp had been unrivaled in chemical engineering until SI diversified. Between Reed Richards and Osborn, Tony had to actually try to continue SI’s success.
Coulson said drily. He caught the stapler Fury threw at him without even looking, having been through this conversation too many times before. Fury was well aware of Phil’s opinions on forced employment, but Phil wasn’t going to let a single instance slide past without reminding him.
Tony looked like it pained him to do so, but he also looked grateful when he saw that Clint was taking this seriously.
Steve placed a hand on his husband’s shoulder and gave a tight squeeze. It grounded Tony, reminded him that he wasn’t alone in his anxiety. It also had the added side effect of shutting him up.
Tony stepped up behind him, hands fluttering around, not knowing what to do. He decided on rubbing circles in Steve’s back as he dry heaved a couple of times. Wiping his mouth with some toilet paper, he stood up and grabbed his toothbrush out of the shower.
Mephisto grinned maliciously, shaking the Captain’s hand. He was going to get either Doom or Stark out of this, and best case scenario, he’d get Captain America too, for betraying an official deal. It was truly a win-win for him.
Clint said, striding in with Thor right behind. Steve was pale and sweating, taking deep, shuddering breaths.
were just representations of coding, which Tony had proceeded to rattle off as a string of letters and numbers that Steve had no hope of understanding. JARVIS had even acted against Tony’s orders on rare occasions when he believed he knew better (which he often did). If he truly had no feelings, he wouldn’t be able to go against orders. Steve was no expert on artificial intelligences by all means, but he decided to believe that JARVIS had grown beyond his coding. He thinks Tony believed it too, but he’d never admit it.
I know Peter and Wade were not childhood friends, but in this universe they are. I don't care, it's too cute not to let it be. I love kid fics with the two of them. Warnings for vague mentions of possible abuse, but nothing more graphic than that. Let me know what you think!
His mind blanked and his eyes closed. He could feel the presence of Strange in his head, but nothing more specific than that. It was over as quickly as it started and he shook his head to clear the feeling.
She considered crushing the devices, but decided she’d rather sit through the pain of listening to the creep than be left completely alone down here. The voice was disturbingly comforting when you were alone in the dark underground. Like the Digger was somehow accompanying her to her death. The story was also comfortingly familiar… Was this Poe? Jessica sighed, holding her panic at bay by willpower alone. Maybe a miracle would happen.
He dropped off another couple goons by Agent (his name is Agent, not Phil, just Agent, he was standing by that). He circled around in the air again, taking stock of the situation. Each of the avengers was knocking several people unconscious at a time, then leaving them for the seemingly endless stream of SHIELD agents to cuff and detain. There were finally only a couple dozen left, and Hawkeye was quickly knocking them down with Tony’s knockout arrows with Bruce’s formula in them that just puts them to sleep.
Steve looked down at the tablet, powering it on. He hoped this would give him some answers. It powered up and had a small circle in the middle that said
he admitted happily. JARVIS lowered the lights again, and the two men held each other until they fell asleep.
Tony had been standing at the end of a hall, a knife in his chest, blood oozing out of the wound. He said,
She looked up at him with tears hanging from the outer corners of her eyes. She took a breath to say something, but she shuddered one last time as the breath left her. She was gone.
Unfortunately, Steve was not ready to sleep. He was still too wound up to relax. Why didn’t Tony ever feel comfortable enough to talk to Steve when he was obviously upset? Steve tried so hard to be there for Tony without being pushy. He just wanted Tony to stop shouldering all of his pain and locking it away behind false smiles and sarcasm. Maybe if he got some of it off his chest and talked to someone, it wouldn’t have been so hard to quit drinking. He had definitely learned that approach from his father.
They rushed into the emergency department, immediately spotting Coulson in the lobby beckoning to them. They followed him without hesitation, and he led them to waiting room on the third floor.
She murmured. Behind her, Bruce was already sprinting for the stairs. It was pretty safe to assume he was headed to the ‘Hulk-proof’ training bunk Tony had designed.
Steve squeezed back. There was so much he wanted to say, but Tony still looked exhausted, and his eyes were already drifting shut again. Tony was alive, and Steve couldn’t do anything about the damage to Tony’s heart right now. They would figure it out together. Tony always came back stronger. Stark men are made of iron.
As Clint sat next to Abram in the car, his hands tied behind his back, Natasha had already informed Fury of the situation and agents were en route to pick up the family. Natasha texted JARVIS, telling him that Raza was responsible for the poisoning. He agreed to immediately start searching the web and databases for any signs of the Ten Rings nearby.
Steve felt the dopey smile on his face. Tony was so cute, whether he was making calculations at a mile a minute or completely out of it.
Tony murmured. He was practically purring while Steve played with his hair. He could allow himself a little more time in Steve’s arms before he got back to work. With all the time he was saving by not sleeping, Tony was actually ahead of schedule with his work for once in his life.
One of Tony’s jets was parked outside the western edge of the forest. Grabbing their packs, Tony and Clint began their hike to find a good campsite near coordinates JARVIS gave them where they were most likely to encounter Bigfoot.
I'm embarrassed to admit that I spent far too long looking at all the magical artifacts in the Marvel universe and deciding what I wanted to use for this prompt. I knew I wanted Enchantress to make an appearance, but the possibilities seemed endless. The Amulets of Damballah are, in fact a thing, but I tweaked them a bit for my purposes. Their first appearance was in 1973 in
Bruce waved his greetings, heading straight for the tea. The group sat in companionable silence while Steve made his feast. Bruce liked to read the newspaper in the mornings. Tony kept trying to explain that a physical paper was a waste and called printing presses obsolete, but Bruce liked the feel of it. He could control the pace with which he absorbed the news instead of feel overwhelmed by the fast talking reporters on TV. Plus he liked the crosswords.
Steve leaned forward intently, biting his lip. He looked as though he might lose it and shake Tony awake any minute. That's when tears started streaming down Tony’s face.
Strange looked apologetic, and Steve felt kind of bad for him. The man very rarely needed help; had earned his title as Sorcerer Supreme without question, so this could be very uncomfortably humbling.
Phil came home from a long day on the helicarrier and greeted Clint by shoving the piece of paper in his face saying,
The blond pulled Tony into his arms, capturing his mouth. He kissed him until he drew another helpless groan from the shorter man, and pulled away. Tony stood on his tip toes in an unconscious effort to follow. Steve’s smile was full of false innocence, but the evil glint was in his eyes.
to read Curse first, but it's more fun that way. As promised, any of these chapters can be read as one shots, and some of them are not even compatible with each other as one timeline, but this one is a continuation.
This year, it was time for Tony’s revenge. He was going to make Clint have nightmares with his prank. Everyone but Thor was on his side this time, or at least they claimed to be. It was common for one of the other Avengers to double-cross the pranksters in the October games. To make sure he wasn’t screwed over by a last minute double cross, Tony had told them all one plan, but had a different plan going on his own as backup. He’d be lying if he said he put any faith at all in the plan that included the others. Trusting Natasha or Phil to work against Clint would be stupid of him, although Phil always claimed to be staying out of it.
Tony said sarcastically. He was sweating profusely now, and considered taking off his shirt, but they would be at the helicarrier any minute.
Tony let his boyfriend help him up but dodged the pity hug. He didn’t feel like getting Steve’s comfort right now.
Steve wasted no time ripping the chains off the cuffs around Tony’s extremities. He scooped up the dying man and sprinted back the way they came. Dracula’s minions screeched in surprise and tried to attack them, swooping down in every hallway, but Steve just jumped out of the way each time and kept running. By the time he reached the jet, he had a whole horde behind him to be caught in the UV rays shooting out of the doorway to the jet. He’s glad he had thought to turn those on at the last moment, just in case.
Peter had had enough. He sat up while Tony ranted, watching his face carefully. This was how Tony got when he wanted to hide his pain or anxiety. Everything quickly became an affront to his being, and it usually quickly spiraled into self-deprecation until someone stopped him.
Tony made a swiping motion through the air, and all of the interactive holograms disappeared. Tony walked over to stand face to face to Steve. BUT YOU BEST BE READY FOR REAL DEAF EXPERIENCE, he signed. NO TECH HELP UNLESS EMERGENCY. Tony looked far too smug, probably thinking about Steve’s finger-spelling earlier. Only Tony would somehow take a good idea and make it a personal challenge. Steve scowled after him as he left for his lab.
Everyone just looked at him so he sat back a little but whatever he was thinking still had him antsy.
Steve commented happily. Tony was nestled into his lap sideways, one arm around Steve’s neck and shoulder to hold him upright. Movie night was easily Steve’s favourite night of the week.
Whatever the girl had done to him with her black eyes, he remembered all of it. Tony felt the pain of it wash over him again, the shock of snapping away from the trance gone. Regular, saltwater tears mixed with the dried blood on his face.
Tony just nodded, since he obviously couldn’t speak with a tube down his throat. Steve pressed the button and held Tony’s good hand, waiting impatiently. He hoped tony could get extubated so he could speak. He also hoped Tony had enough pain medication.
By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone’s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.
Natasha started making herself some eggs, a quick glance at the three men telling her all that she needed, along with what she gathered from Tony’s bad mood this morning. Tony relapsed last night, Steve blames himself, Clint was there, and Phil’s trying to clean up the mess. She said nothing, deciding to listen instead.
Tony was actually blushing a little. He very rarely blushed. His olive italian complexion made it harder to show than Steve’s pale irish white, but he also didn’t have much shame anyway.
The inconspicuous grey honda rolled quietly through the neighborhood. It was a far cry from the sleek black cars SHIELD used or the limos and sports cars of Tony’s collection.
It was two hours into their hike that Steve began to notice Tony’s discomfort. He kept adjusting the weight of his sack, grimacing when nothing seemed to help.
They all watched the video in tense silence. Bruce gripped the table through the wave of green that rippled through him. The dent in the table was not the first, but Steve was grateful that Bruce was still in control. Steve certainly wouldn’t be if he had the Hulk inside of him. He barely felt in control now.
Tony turned back to find Strange raising an eyebrow at him with a slight smirk. If the man wasn’t so irksome when he was smug, Tony would be relieved to see a little of his usual personality shine through this exhaustion and panic he seemed to be in tonight.
He inhaled sharply. Underneath the photo it said that this man was the leader of the still powerful Ten Rings, and that he had a bounty placed for Tony Stark to be brought to him alive to
Natasha had seen the whole thing go down, but wasn’t close enough to stop it. Whatever Clint had been hit with was not a normal bullet, and Clint looked flat out crazed.
Steve needed to get to the bottom of this now. If Dracula was involved, this could get serious quickly. He had always been grateful not to be on the vampires’ bad side, even if he wasn’t quite on their good side (if they had one).
Steve looked around the room, letting himself wake up fully, but there wasn’t much to see so his eyes wandered back to Tony. He really was lucky Dr. Stein was so accommodating. Steve had forgotten about hospital rules of immediate family only; Tony didn’t even have any. As soon as Dr. Stein had said it, the idea had been growing in his mind: why wasn’t he Tony’s husband? It’s not as if he was afraid of the commitment. He definitely loved Tony, and had already decided to stay with him until one of them died. So what were they waiting on?
It had been nearly a decade since the last time he used the doll. His life was comfortable, he didn’t need to. The money was running out, though, and in retrospect he maybe should’ve invested some of it, but now it was too late. He could pull out the old costume and doll for one last mission, then he would invest it properly this time and swear off hurting people for good. The only logical target was the richest man in the world, of course. Tony Stark.
Clint flew the Avenjet while the rest of them rode in tense silence. The Avengers were not used to feeling so powerless. Tony held a bowl in his lap, and he had a sickly grey tint to him. Every so often they could hear him hiss in pain, but he was staying abnormally quiet overall.
Tony couldn’t help the wince at his old nickname, but thankfully no one seemed to notice. Steve looked scolded, and Tony mussed his hair on the way back to his seat to hopefully cheer the man up.
she exclaimed. It was the first Tony heard her voice, and it sounded less humanoid than he had expected. The closest he could probably get to describing it was that it sounded like a few differently pitched voices speaking in unison. There was emotional inflection, which bode well for his hypothesis that she was an android and not a robot, unless she was just programmed to seem emotional like is LMDs (Life Model Decoy).
I'm sorry Tony, I just love hurting you. I threw in some Tiberius because he's one of my favourite Tony enemies. The whole close friend gone sour deal is just a good trope. Warning for being bound and feelings of hopelessness.
Tony’s breathing stuttered when Dracula pulled the arc reactor out of the socket. The panic that came with anyone touching the thing that kept him alive was far more powerful than the hypnotism. Dracula met his panicked gaze sharply, and Tony felt some of the panic subside. It seemed a strangely courteous thing to do; it’s not as though Tony could fight back. Maybe Dracula wasn’t completely evil. Villains came in varying levels of cruelty. It felt like an electric shock ran through him when the pin was stuck in. It was hard to explain how he knew, but Tony knew that the nanobots were all deactivated. He felt somehow dulled, like he had been constantly thrumming like a machine, and now he had been powered down. He hadn’t noticed that he could feel the nanotech until the feeling was gone.
He should be home by now, unless Fury was holding him prisoner again under the guise of paperwork. Tony was pretty sure Fury did it just to prove his power.
Steve had no choice but to follow. He wanted to argue, wanted to comfort Tony and magically wish away the symptoms, but Tony was right. There were two options. Either this was the worst of it and Tony would get better, or it was going to get worse and the city was their only hope. He watched Tony carefully, for any sign of stumbling. Tony didn’t let them stop for a meal, so Steve ate the rest of his bar while Tony merely drank some river water.
Steve and Phil shared amused expressions across the room. It was nice to see Tony unwinding, though why he was on the floor was a mystery. The brunette propped himself up on his elbows, waiting expectantly for Steve’s input.
His voice was quiet but echoed through the silent gym. He dropped to his knees, a sob ripping through him.
Tony couldn’t decide which was worse, the thirst or sitting in his own waste. The smell was nauseating but he knew if he allowed himself to vomit he’d only die faster. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing, even though no one was here to see it. Unlike his usual kidnappings, there wasn’t even a camera in the room to indicate that he was being watched. He was thoroughly alone.
the AI prodded him. Right, he was here for a reason. Tony got distracted by Steve’s secret interest in particle physics.
Clint met him halfway and hugged him, allowing Phil to rub his shoulders for a second. He needed Phil so much right now but here wasn't the time or place.
Steve asked incredulously. It would’ve been adorable how naive the man was if Tony had had enough coffee for this. In lieu of answering, he just raised an eyebrow at the blond with a smirk.
JARVIS tried to speak reason, but Tony’s pupils were blown wide and he showed no indication of hearing JARVIS.
This wasn’t their thing, Tony and Clint didn’t talk feelings, they goofed around and teased each other. Everyone on the team had had at least one of their ‘Tony Talks’ as they had been deemed, everyone except Clint. Clint heard about them only in hearsay, but a Tony Talk was apparently always eye-opening for both parties. Tony kept things close to his chest for the most part, Clint did too, so whenever a Tony Talk did happen, whether it was because the two people got really drunk, or because a duo mission got unexpectedly serious and adrenaline pushed truths out of the closet, it was a big deal.
He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers’ PR agent had set up the interview on
With that he strode out, leaving everyone in awkward silence. They rarely worked with Stephen Strange. He and Tony didn’t get along, everyone was at least a little creeped out by him, and he always had an air of having bigger fish to fry. Except this time; he seemed to have a personal vendetta against the Mandarin and the rings of power. Plus, as much as he and Tony didn’t get along, they deeply respected each other. Bruce had a suspicion that Dr. Strange wouldn’t be such a loner if he didn’t have to; that he was always off saving the whole universe but no one knew.
from the archer. Tony sighed. Time for plan B. He tapped the small icon on his phone that would activate the spiders. This had to work, it was full proof!
Somehow a relaxing swim in the stream turned into another contest. Tony decided that they should race. When that ended predictably (hadn’t they just talked about Tony’s lack of lung capacity?) Tony suggested they see who can catch a fish with their bare hands first. Clint almost felt bad when he won that too, the way Tony slumped in defeat for a moment, but it was quickly shrugged off. Overall they had a good time.
The darkness occluding Clint's vision lifted like a cloud of smoke. He whipped his head around, taking in the new situation. The Mandarin was out cold on the floor but Strange and Tony weren't there anymore. He could only hope that that meant Strange had got Tony to Medical. He turned to see Natasha brushing away a tear, but he'd never mention it to her unless he wanted his fingers broken.
Steve acquiesced. Natasha had already left the room to make cocoa. The woman refused to let any of them know what made hers taste so special, claiming it was a Russian family secret. Only Bruce was ever allowed in the room and that was only to help her top them with whipped cream.
Clint grinned. Phil always saw through him. ‘I’m more excited to see Tony’s idea for comms. Could be useful for covert missions. But yeah, I may be enjoying their awkwardness just a bit,’ Clint admitted. Hearing people often thought they could imagine life in silence, but they were usually pretty far off. There was just things one never thought about when they didn’t have to. Like he was fairly certain Thor was probably going to sleep well into the day, because the god had probably not thought about his alarm not working. Thor was always a deep sleeper, and depended on the loud blaring to get him up at a reasonable hour.
Yinsen’s face blurred into Agent’s, pulling him out of the flashback. Tony could feel his heart pounding and his hands were trembling. When he looked down and saw that he was still clutching the air as if he needed to hold the car battery he slowly lowered his hands to his sides. Everyone’s eyes were on him and the papers from the folder were scattered everywhere. He didn’t even have the energy to be embarrassed.
Tony had jumped backwards, just out of reach of the stranger. Whatever the man had done, he was clearly more healed than he had been a moment prior. If draining energy from tech helped him heal faster, Tony couldn’t quite blame the man for using up the arc reactors, especially with how injured he must’ve been when he appeared there. The question remained as to whether this man had come on purpose, or even knew where he was. It was very possible that he had merely teleported to the best spot for sources of energy.
she asked brightly, checking his vitals and pulling out his chart. Tony just glared at her and she chuckled.
The red chaos magic flowed from her hands into Tony, and Steve could see her sweating from the effort. Her eyes glowed red and her mouth was parted as she lifted a few inches off the ground. Tony’s monitors flatlined, but Steve could see that Tony wasn’t dead. He was more frozen. It reminded Steve of one of Tony’s stasis fields, but red and magic. Steve couldn’t escape the knowledge that even if Wanda kept him like this until Strange broke the spell, Tony would still be in this state when she let go. Could the doctors even save him? Strange finished whatever he had been chanting, which Steve hadn’t even noticed he was chanting, and looked at Wanda.
They danced to a song Steve didn’t recognize, but it hardly mattered. He only had eyes for Tony and followed the man’s lead. Tony had been taught to dance when he was three and it more than made up for Steve’s two left feet. Tony finished his drink so he could use two hands again, placing it on the passing waiter’s tray. He frowned at Steve’s untouched drink before snatching it, draining it, and also placing it on said waiter’s tray. The waiter scowled before he walked away. Had that been the same one as before?
Bruce examined his friend’s form quickly. Tony wasn’t really getting in any consistent air between the full body twitches that left him breathless. He held Tony as still as he could while he wrenched the damaged reactor out.
In the beginning of the search, there even was a mistress. Jessica had followed the man’s credit card transactions to a motel room, where the woman was still staying. Unfortunately, she had no idea where the man had gone.
Steve put the mirror back and their eyes met. He wondered when the last time Tony had looked in a mirror was. The brunette looked genuinely surprised at his haggard appearance.
Tony turned to give his lover a long look before he continued making his way back to his next project.
Steve’s hands were shaking as he finished turning the lock on his personal safe. He had known it was a good idea to have an extra reactor hidden separate from all of Tony’s backups, just in case something like this happened. Tony was too cocky about his own security. Keeping all of the backups in one place was asking for trouble. The glowing reactor looked like the Holy Grail to him just then. He was back at Tony’s side on the helipad in no time. The medics were loading him onto the chopper. Bruce had already removed the useless dead reactor, and the gaping hole in Tony’s chest was even more terrifying than the dark reactor. His lips were blue and his skin chalky white. Steve slammed the new one in, probably harder than necessary, twisting it just right for it to lock in place.
Bruce took a steadying breath. Peter’s hand in his gave him the strength to go on. He could do this.
Steve took it in stride. Tony had been practicing with him for months, so he’d be prepared for far worse questions than this.
They cried together in silence until they could produce no more tears. Bruce’s exhaustion eventually got the better of him and he fell into an uneasy sleep, upright in the visitors’ chair. Steve spent the night watching Tony breathe. His chest moved up and down at a constant pace because of the machine. Up and down, up and down. Steve found himself lost in memories of Tony laughing and good dates they’ve had when Julie came in to check on him. He was grateful that she didn’t try to make small talk, she just quietly went about her job and left. The intrusion had broken his reverie though.
he asked, not meeting anyone’s eyes. He’d at least pretend he had some dignity. Pepper held out a glass of water she had already filled while Dr. Stein was talking to Tony. Pep always thought of everything. Tony drained it with a satisfied sigh.
Faking arachnophobia? Clint hadn’t been trying to hide his reactions to spiders, he had been pretending to hide a fake reaction. He screamed and reacted even when alone just to be sure. It was the most intense double-bluff Tony had ever seen.
Tony whined, doing his best to give Steve puppy dog eyes. Steve could see Tony’s mouth twitch, though, giving away that he was trying not to laugh.
Steve looked around, seeing the SHIELD swarm gathering Ten Rings Men in cuffs and doing whatever SHIELD swarms do to clean up their messes, until he saw Bruce walking towards him pulling on a t-shirt, and Daredevil beside him. Everyone else was okay at least. Fuck. Tony was gone with the Mandarin, the one thing they had been trying to avoid. How the hell are they going to find him? What kind of horrors does the Mandarin want to do to him? He’s been harboring this grudge for years. Steve suddenly felt sick. He stepped outside and vomited at the thought of Tony being tortured. He leaned against the wall and breathed in the cold air, trying to calm down.
Steve agreed. They remained like that, in companionable silence, for hours. Hospital staff came in and out, checking on monitors and changing dressing, but the two visitors were left alone. Phil was glad the others hadn’t come today, and he made a mental note to text Natasha later that they should wait until the injured were awake before visiting. Something told him that Steve would also appreciate having less people around.
she shouted behind her, not looking away from Thor, who was normally so cheerful and relaxed here. He didn’t even look at her, he just started walking forward towards the direction Jane’s voice was coming from.
and that got a giggle from Peter. Peter’s giggle always made Wade’s stomach feel weird. He didn’t really know why but it wasn’t completely unpleasant.
Tony scrunched up his face in irritation. It was a testament to how uncomfortable he must be that he didn’t fight it. Tony would normally run himself into the ground before letting people help him; it drove Steve insane.
Coulson had written and nodded as Tony spoke. Now he was underlining things from a different page and making
he stared at his feet so he wouldn’t have to see hurt Steve. Hurt Steve was just painful to look at.
he said in a monotone. Steve knew that tone. Bruce was very upset with Tony, but making sure he was calm enough to not Hulk out.
Clint didn't really want to say it out loud. He felt stupid. The others seemed like they had dealt with some real shit and here he had been in a fucking cloud of darkness he could have stepped out of. He sighed.
Tony could hear his breath going more and more ragged, and the pain just kept getting worse, he didn’t know how he was going to get out of this one. He was able to hit the latch to lift the faceplate, but it was a struggle. As he got weaker he allowed himself to slowly sit, then lie down, the metal joints of the suit creaking and scraping as he moved with no power. He looked over as Clint fell, but there was nothing he could do and his vision was starting to go black around the edges. He kept pushing it away, focusing on breathing and the pain just to keep himself conscious. When the smoke and cape came in a swirl around him, he saw the Mandarin and was too tired to feel fear. Maybe Steve could save him. But when he felt his body jerked away from the scene with the Mandarin gripping his arm, the world feeling like it disappeared for a split second then came crashing back in another, it made his stomach twist. He
Tony flew over the remaining distance, dodging the few minions who took to the air or jumped at him. 30%.
Tony was the only one that knew. Bruce didn’t open up much, and had only shared small snippets with Tony in the strange twilight hours of long nights together in the lab. They came when the two were heavily sleep deprived, and usually after Tony had revealed something painful about his own childhood. Tony was deeply honoured to be in Bruce’s trust, but he still didn’t feel like he knew as much about Bruce as Bruce did about him.
Steve felt warmth spread through his chest and he kissed the top of Tony’s head. Tony was hardly ever the one to initiate an ‘I love you.’ Steve had just accepted the emotional constipation and wariness of affection as part of being with Tony long ago. If he had to explain it, Steve would guess it’s what came from having cold, distant parents and a string of trusted loved ones betraying you.
Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn’t complaining, but he knew it wasn’t true.
Murdock spoke loudly and clearly. Jessica described the night. The jury audibly gasped when she talked about the screams of Mr. Marcus through the coffin lid. Murdock nodded, pacing back and forth thoughtfully as though this weren’t the thousandth time he’s heard her testimony. Court could be such a rehearsed play.
Tony said as he collapsed into a chair, pulling up schematics for some of the new improvements to Clint’s bows.
Clint asked. Tony crossed his arms with a smirk, knowing Clint wasn’t going to pass up the chance to embarrass Tony with a bet.
That only seemed to encourage her, and suddenly everything grew worse. Tony screamed, or tried to, but his voice was barely there anymore.
Tony doodled in the dust while Steve slept. He wished he had something to work on here. If it took longer than tomorrow to make it to civilization, he might just lose it. Tony was trying to push away the constant anxiety that he should be working, since of course it couldn’t be helped, but it was hard. Steve was probably the only thing that was keeping him grounded. The man was making an obvious effort to make Tony laugh whenever possible. Tony could appreciate the gesture, but he did really need to get home.
he whispered. There, he had said it. That should explain it all, right? What more needed explaining? He had to save enough people before he died or die trying.
The elevator moved quickly, and Tony stepped off just as JARVIS told the team that the zombie was officially on the move. It’s probably best not to use the elevator again after this, because if he did happen to get caught in the elevator with Bruce on the other side when the door opened, it would be very difficult to escape. That was a good strategy for later, though, if he did end up on the zombie’s side.
Natasha said matter-of-factly, motioning for them to follow her. They walked over to where Steve was in a literal block of ice. The rest of them seem to have been dealing with mind tricks but Steve was physically attacked.
his voice dry. Right, the man didn’t have a weapon. Steve handed him the handgun strapped to his leg. He had the shield anyway, and rarely used guns.
Tony stopped in surprise as Steve turned his head gently, a hand gripping his chin. Steve kissed him deeply, probably to keep him quiet.
Clint finally said. Dr. Nicholson was doing a more thorough examination, and she held up a finger to quiet them while she listened to different spots on Tony’s chest with the stethoscope.
he suggested suddenly. It wasn’t trick-or-treating, but at least Tony would get to dress up. Peter would love it too, and he could just guess at how thrilled Thor would be to participate in another Midgardian holiday.
he rasped. Steve needed to lose that panicky look he had. Tony was starting to think Steve would have a heart attack in his thirties of he kept up this level of stress every time Tony got hurt.
The Avengers were stranger than any of the otherworldly adventures he went on, Stephen Strange decided.
He turned, and seeing Tony, his heart sank. His lover was on his knees and his faceplate lifted. It looked like Tony couldn’t breathe, his mouth gaping and his expression pained. He clutched at his chest as he fell to the ground. Steve didn’t even register that he was running until he was next to Tony, shaking him and yelling.
His shit-eating grin was begging for a smack. Peter giggled gleefully, enjoying their little collaboration.
Tony pried his eyelids open, heart monitor beeping beside him. He had never felt this weak in his life, and his chest ached. Little snippets of what had happened came to him slowly, and not in order. Steve just watched the man figure out everything, expressions of confusion, fear, anger, realization, flitting across his face clearly. When he finally turned his head to look at the blond, he seemed pretty lucid. He was so thankful that Steve looked fine and not like a vampire.
Morgana waved a hand, and Tony was now being forced into an upright starfish position, each limb chained to some invisible force and being pulled taut. It was not a comfortable way to be held up against gravity, and his shoulders already ached.
Tony scrunched up his nose, never able to deny that voice. Steve knew it, too, and really, Tony should be glad that the man didn’t abuse the power.
Here's sort of the calm before the storm. We're about to get into the real action of the fic soon, and I can't wait to hear people's thoughts on the upcoming chapters! Writing a large team fighting together is a lot of fun but I don't know if everything actually makes sense. Here's to a calm chapter!
Steve thought JARVIS sounded anxious and angry. The stirrings of anger were beginning in the back of Steve’s mind, but they were easily drowned out by panic. Tony was still breathing and his pulse was fast and uneven.
The real plan, as Tony was calling it in his head, was much more complicated. Tony had started planning it in April. It hinged entirely on how observant Clint was. Tony knew the man was acutely aware of even the most useless details of his everyday life the same way Natasha and Phil were. He figured it must be a habit one picks up at SHIELD. So back six months ago, Tony began making sure the tower was only stocked with the same toothpaste brand every time. If someone went shopping on their own and bought the wrong brand, Tony replaced it with the correct one.
she yelled into the chaos. The previous mix of yells, screams, crashes, laughter, and pounding music of Tony’s Halloween party was replaced by a deafening silence.  Wanda dropped the hands that she had been digging into her eyes and looked around the room. Everyone gaped at her, words caught in their throat.
Steve was hit with the stench first. Tony had clearly been forced to sit in his own excretions, and the man’s gaze was unfocused. He lurched forward, wasting no time slamming the shield over the lock and cutting the ropes binding Tony. Tony groaned and it might have been an attempt at saying Steve, and Steve caught him as he fell sideways off the chair.
He tried to meet Tony’s eyes. They were half-lidded and completely glazed over. This close, Steve could see the way his chest stuttered. Tony blinked hard, before looking at Steve confused and out of it.
Steve was reading from a window seat, snuggled under a blue fuzzy blanket and next to an Iron Man plushie. Tony smiled, warmth spreading through his chest at the sight. He really had the best boyfriend ever. It almost felt wrong to interrupt the serene scene.
If any of you can actually find the lyrics written out, please let me know because it is shockingly hard to find, but the song is beautiful and what I can make out of the lyrics is wonderful. I may be in love with the idea of Steve loving Marian Anderson.
He felt himself speak the words, but there was still no sound. His own words appeared before him in a different font, and it was so perfect. This had so many applications in the field!
he pushed through and gave them no choice but to part down the middle so he could reach the elevator.
Only Steve could so easily make Tony feel guilty. Usually Tony only felt guilty for the mass murder from his days as a weapons dealer type thing.
He yelled, bounding back towards Tony. Tony tried to take off, but his repulsors only sputtered. The Hulk grasped Iron Man’s torso in his right fist, squeezing slowly.
Steve wasn’t ignorant to the fact that the heat was blasting in the car, no doubt Tony had told Happy to turn up the heat. Tony always thought of all the small details for people’s comfort and never wanted thanks. Steve wanted all the reporters and congressmen that thought Tony was an asshole to see this side of his lover.
Bruce’s only mistake was that he exhaled too loudly. Tony jumped out of his chair in the knick of time, darting away towards the other end of the table.
Steve dialed 911. Tony was shaking his head, murmuring something about being fine, but the man was clearly not ok.
Clint started, voice careful and eyes watching for minute facial expressions in Steve before he could mask them.
Steve asked nervously. Tony realized he hadn't actually answered yet because he'd been too busy planning.
he rasped, looking at the ceiling. He turned his head, eyes catching on Phil’s immediately. He made grabby hands until Phil complied, leaning in for a quick kiss and sitting on the bed’s edge.
This must be what being hypnotized felt like. Tony could hear the vampires words in tandem with his own voice in his head. It was as though Dracula’s instructions were his own thoughts, and he
The only respite was when Morgana would get bored of one spell and move onto another. At some point burning turned into crushing pain, which would eventually morph into the stabbing pain of invisible knives through him in all directions. Tony had no idea the woman hated him so much. Or perhaps she just needed someone to torture, and he was a convenient pastime for her. It was weird to think about how this much pain could come out of just one angry enemy, one bored sorceress looking for an outlet.
he heard Jane's voice from behind the Mandarin somewhere. He stepped to the side to see where she was and she was tied to a chair. Everything else immediately became less important, because there was red seeping through the rope at her abdomen.
he felt the blush creep across his face when Steve started laughing. Steve had a nice laugh. Tony should really try to make Steve laugh more.
Clint gaped in a mixture of awe and horror as Tony reached up his shirt and pulled out the arc reactor. Tony’s face only showed a small twitch that indicated Tony feeling a thing. Tony took the wire that connected the reactor to the electromagnet, and touched it to the uncovered metal of his phone’s lithium ion battery. The resulting sparks were numerous, and hotter than what someone can get with banging rocks together or twirling sticks by hand. Despite the dampness, the kindling burst into flame, and the fire continued to burn steadily after that. Tony yanked his hands back, only catching a few sparks on his skin.
He hung up. The fact that JARVIS knew Tony would be at the hospital without Steve even saying he was hurt told Steve far more than any explanation could’ve. Whatever Tony had been doing to himself, it was dangerous enough that JARVIS was only allowed to tell someone if Tony’s life was at stake. This wasn’t the first time Tony had kept similar secrets. He clenched his fists. The mixture of helplessness, terror, and cold anger was nauseating.
Tony went to sit up, hissing when he moved his left arm. Clint let him use his shoulder to grip with the uninjured arm and helped the man sit up.
Strange was such a strange man, Steve decided, no pun intended. He nodded and followed the sorcerer when Strange twirled around in a flourish, his cape billowing, walking off at a brisk pace.
he had the gall to be sarcastic and raise an unimpressed eyebrow at Clint. He was so tempted to punch the man in the nose and honestly? He’d probably do it if Steve wouldn’t kill him for it.
Steve couldn’t see that he really had a choice here. He shared a look with the rest of the team, but was only met with regretful shrugs.
Bruce stood in front of them all, fidgeting a little. Bruce didn’t talk about his childhood. Ever. They all had vague ideas about his history, but even Natasha hadn’t read about it in his SHIELD file. She normally valued knowing people over their privacy, but Bruce was so private and meek, it just felt wrong to pry. The scientist pulled his glasses off, wiped them with his shirt, put them back on. He glanced between Steve and Tony a few times before locking eyes with Tony.
He liked to believe that Tony wouldn’t do anything stupid, but he did have a track record. Steve just hoped Tony would turn to him before turning to the bottle. Then again, apparently Steve was not a good enough lover to begin with, or Tony would be happier and wouldn’t want to be alone right now. Steve went at the bag again, focusing on the pounding sound of his fists rather than his shortcomings with Tony.
Tony heard the Mandarin’s voice behind him. He arched his back in a scream as something was peeled away, his vision going white for a moment from the pain. The piece of melted fabric and skin fell to his lap as the Mandarin dropped it over his head. Tony felt sick at the sight, and suddenly very dizzy. His vision started to go black as the room spun round but he was jerked back up with a slap to the face.
Tony groaned. He was openly vocal about how much he hated asking for magic users for help, it was an affront to his being. Science should always be able to reveal the answers. He sighed, opening his eyes again. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this tired without collapsing for at least an hour.
Natasha and Clint traded a look, communicating several plans and consequences in only a few seconds. Clint nodded.
As each of the avengers filed in, Tony made them sit with a point and a glare until Thor arrived last and sat on the ground.
That should satisfy Steve, Tony was proud of it. That security protocol had taken him several trial runs to work out blind spots.
the detective said sarcastically. Honestly, she didn’t deserve the attitude she got from the city’s officials, really. It was never her fault the police couldn’t do their jobs, nor was the increase in powered crime that she ended up tangled in her fault. She just seem to draw trouble.
Tony finds out who's after him. The gang deal with Tony's relapse. Let's hope everyone can remain calm? Also the chapter with a little bit of Phlint feels because I love them.
They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.
Steve began laughing, like there was a joke Strange had missed. At the man’s obvious confusion, Steve only laughed harder.
He quickly wet a washcloth from the bathroom and laid it on Steve’s forehead. He sighed deeply and pulled Tony down next to him.
Tony swallowed the lump in his throat. If his memory served correctly, Symkaria was just northeast of Latveria, and a close ally to the country. Doctor Doom had sworn to protect the slightly smaller nation, and Avengers or SHIELD would certainly be considered enemy aircraft, shot down on sight.
His voice was barely audible even within the couple of inches they were apart. He was counting on Steve’s super soldier hearing. Steve stirred, luckily not waking Tony.
he started. Jessica wasn’t answering his calls, and Trish never heard from her, and she could be dead. The police would never find him in time to save Jessica if the Digger had her. His MO was to bury his victims the same night. It was more difficult to keep live victims from calling attention or escaping than it was to just be rid of them before the morning light.
The door on the other side of the room opened. Tony watched the man approaching him warily. He could recognize that face anywhere, had grown up with the guy even. They had lost contact a long time ago. Tony hadn’t had a clue where Tiberius Stone had disappeared to after his old man had gone bankrupt. There had been rumours about the man buying out small companies abroad, amassing resources, but Tony hadn’t paid them much attention. He had assumed Ty wanted nothing to do with him anymore.
the sorcerer began. That got Tony’s attention. He looked up at Dr. Strange, raising his eyebrows in a show of surprise.
The trial was very straight forward. Jessica had witnessed the attempted murder, and the rest of the cases had plenty of fingerprints to place him with the body. The only reason they were there at all was because The Digger was going for an insanity plea, but Murdock wasn’t having any of it. Without Jessica’s witness testimony, there may have been a chance of reasonable doubt because Krupp worked at the cemetery and his fingerprints could just be on the tools others used. Circumstantial evidence, it was called. It had taken weeks of exhuming and using some sort of underground sonar to find all of the bodies, as they were hidden amongst the graves that actually belonged there. She had to admit that hiding bodies in a cemetery was a good plan.
He shouted. The Hulk stilled, but did not yet turn to face the tiny man in the metal suit. He took another step towards the building where something seemed to be calling to him, opting to ignore the voice of the tin man.
Natasha sometimes tried to imagine what the relationship was like between a scientist and a god. The idea just seemed so alien. The two seemed to both be obsessed with other worlds or realms, so she supposed that could be what they shared most. But can a human really understand a centuries old warrior-king?
Tony put on his best puppy dog face, hoping Steve could find some understanding in the steel resolve.
Tony felt like he had walked into some sort of trap. That there was a wrong answer here. Maybe he should work around the question rather than answering directly.
he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.
It was definitely along the lines of what they were all thinking, but Peter had the bluntness of a child on his side.
‘Enjoying the Cap’s little experiment?’ Phil asked wryly. He knew Clint probably found this all immensely amusing.
he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.
Thor was actually pouting. Clint would have never believed that his life would be like this. He saw a god pouting almost daily. A god. If you had told him this as a kid, he would’ve laughed and told you that a con has to be believable.
Nobody really liked it when Steve’s voice deadened like that, but they understood the necessity. They could all hear the change after this much time on a team with him. Dr. Strange cleared his throat.
She gave him a pointed look. Steve looked at Tony and back at her, his hesitation clear in his face. She pointed to the clock,
He took a shower and settled into bed to wait for Phil. Phil should’ve gotten home before him, he was probably stuck doing all the paperwork HR should’ve been doing for Dr. Stein and Julie’s new files. Fury liked to torture him that way. Only Phil would put up with Fury’s shit to the extent that he does.
Loki’s frown deepened. Steve looked like he was about to retort, but Loki caught him with a glare first, giving a subtle shake of his head.
Everyone shrugged. Normally JARVIS would’ve answered, but Tony had probably forbidden him from using text to speak to them. Speak of the devil, Tony entered the room ignoring all of them. He went straight to the coffee pot, drained it, then started another. While it was brewing, he turned to face the abnormally crowded kitchen.
Clint gripped Steve’s thighs, grounding him a little, stopping that feeling that he was falling away. Phil knelt beside Steve, one hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing.
The Palais Garnier Opera House was haunted. A Punishing Phantom lurked in its hidden depths, and disappeared anyone he considered guilty. This could be stagehands abusing dancers, patrons who beat their wives, once even a conductor who had driven one too many harried musicians to suicide. The phantom of the opera left little notes with his verdicts on each victim with a hand drawn symbol in blood. It resembled an angry human skull with no bottom jaw and four elongated prongs in place of teeth. When the Opera House finally shut down, the symbol of the phantom was sometimes spray painted on the boarded up windows by local teens, always daring each other to go into the
Tony decided, lying in a cave, reeling from the latest round of torture. He thought about his mother. He contemplated the lessons he had learned the few times Maria dragged him to mass. The Bible had mentioned something about ‘the sins of the father’ or something. Not that Tony believed in God; he was a man of science. Not even he tried to deny the usefulness of religion in teaching ethics and morality, though.
Steve was going to stop second guessing himself. Every time he got that nagging feeling it turned out to be something. He found Tony sitting at a bar stool, a bottle of whiskey in his hand. It was half empty, and Steve really hoped it hadn’t started off full.
He started brushing his teeth vigorously, and kept looking at Tony’s doubtful face. He spit then smiled weakly at Tony.
Tony leaned forward so Clint could see him better around the light fixture on the wall between them.
Steve whispered in his ear and kissed Tony’s neck, biting just a little. Tony hissed but otherwise continued what he was doing.
I totally believe Jessica would be a little star-struck to meet the big name heroes the first time. You may not believe me, but just remember that Jessica and Luke very rarely get into any of the big business with the cape-crew. They just like their happy marriage and adorable baby in Hell's Kitchen.
There were so many questions running through Tony’s head, but he knew he was probably going to fall asleep again soon. Apparently having an alien suck out your body’s energy really took it out of you.
The mysterious sorceress appeared and kidnapped Tony on an average day, during an average team breakfast. There was no warning, and almost no time to react. Thor had really hoped he wouldn't have to be the one to reveal Tony's secret past with Morgan le Fay, but everyone's shocked and confused looks gave him little option.
The bullet had come from the man holding the odd gun pointed at Tony, Clint thought as he dropped to his knees. It didn’t make sense because the gun was still facing Tony. Clint’s thoughts moved like molasses as he finally noticed the other gun pointing at him from underneath the larger gun. It was also strange, but in a different way. He couldn’t think anymore, it was too hard. All he saw was white, and who’s that screaming?
Tony felt something swell inside, and he suddenly felt less sad and anxious. If he could be enough for someone like Steve Rogers, maybe that was good enough. Maybe he could just do his best. He’d have to think on it some more, but for tonight, this was enough.
She gave him a small smile, trying to soften the harsh tone to her words. It was hardly the genius’ fault she had a headache.
Steve couldn’t sleep. He had this nagging feeling that he hadn’t done enough for Tony. He closed his eyes, trying to ignore the feeling. Tony was okay, he needed some space. Steve should let it alone. It wouldn’t hurt just to check on him.
and why was Tony not invited? That would have been a great time. Tony knew every word to those songs.
Steve heard the cursing over the comms first, but had no way of seeing what was going on in that much detail. He was about to ask Tony to report when he saw Hawkeye hit the ground and heard the screaming start. Clint was screaming and writhing on the ground, his scream so desperate and harsh; Steve had to rip the comm out before he ruined his eardrum. None of this was making any sense, this should have been fairly easy.
Tony groaned as he stretched in bed. When had he gone to bed last night? Did he fall asleep in the lab again? He hoped Steve had a pot of coffee for him, because he was going to need it. He reached for Steve, not yet opening his eyes, and Steve caught his hand, warm and strong; always there.
Steve didn’t look happy, but he didn’t start yelling either. Tony kind of wished he would, so they could just get it over with. Instead, the supersoldier just stood and walked away.
Tony asked, ignoring the rude things Bruce had just said and opting to deal with the part that made no sense.
noises. Everyone watched silently, fidgeting, except for Clint and Natasha of course. They don’t fidget.
I have WAY too much fun making vague references to the days when Thor was also Dr. Donald Blake. Anyone ever want to talk golden age comics with me, just let me know. I love that shit.
Clint saw Phil’s shoes from down the hall, neatly placed just inside the doorway. When he walked in, Phil looked up from the same book Clint had left sitting on the bed.
She couldn’t make out any useful features, besides the slight hunch to his shoulders. The kidnapper never faced the camera. Great, now the police had to be involved. Jessica hoped the client would still pay her.
she said when she was done searching his face to see that he was alright. She kissed him on the forehead and walked away. Every time Steve thought he had her figured out, she did something he never expected, like that. He numbly followed her to the jet and buckled in.
he murmured. This went on for another painfully long minute before he stopped and let out a long sigh.
Clint sighed. He started lathering up a soapy washcloth and washing Phil’s back while Phil shampooed Clint’s hair.
She chewed on her pen thoughtfully. It was probably a bad habit to have in the medical field, especially at a hospital or SHIELD medical, her newest job.
Tony started gently. Even if the man couldn’t understand him, he might be able to glean general intent from tone.
Tony watched the diagram as the red dot moved around, indicating where JARVIS was ‘seeing’ the signature in the basement.
He went to sit up then hissed as it sent a sharp pain though his clavicle, leaving behind a dull ache. Letting his head fall back down he closed his eyes again. He was so tired.
She went about her work, carefully placing Tony back in the supine position with practiced hands. Thor watched curiously over her shoulder, and when she finished, they met face to face. To her credit, she didn’t startle.
When Tony came to, it was to the sound of card shuffling. His eyelids felt like they were glued shut, and he had to raise his hands to wipe away the crust. The room was thankfully dim, only about half of the lights on. Other than the familiar ache of sleeping too long, he felt generally alright, just tired. What was the last thing he remembered? Oh!
Tony was lying on top of him restfully after the sex. Steve smiled as he played with Tony’s hair and thought about the couch beneath them. It was getting a little lumpy. Maybe he should buy a new one for Christmas. That seemed like a good gift for Tony. The billionaire would never think to replace it himself. They both slept on this old thing often enough, and Steve didn’t want Tony to get a sore back.
Clint called from the couch. That seemed to remind Tony of their debate. He pushed off Phil, flirtation forgotten, and jumped onto the couch, sticking his socks in Clint’s face. The squawk he let it out was totally worth the ensuing wrestling match that ended up with Tony pinned on the ground.
Clint closed his eyes and counted to ten. How Steve dealt with this all the time was a mystery for the ages. He walked back and silently helped the smaller man up, to lean on him. Tony kept his mouth shut, limping back to camp, where Clint unceremoniously dropped him outside the tent. The fire was still slightly burning embers, so he scooted over, shivering. Clint watched him curl up, one arm cradled awkwardly to his chest, the other wrapped around his knees, and his injured ankle gingerly placed on the ground while he just stared into the glowing embers with a thousand-yard-stare.
There was a mad glint to the man’s eyes. The guard holding him began dragging him away so they could question him in private. Pepper was approaching from the other direction with medics on either side of her.
Tony responded quietly. He was proud of the way the bitterness stayed out of his voice. He merely sounded bored. In truth it had hurt when he suddenly couldn’t get a hold of his friend. Nobody likes to be ghosted.
He left Tony’s field of vision for a moment, and it sounded like he rolled over a table and turned on some machinery. Norman’s face returned above him.
Tony stood, staggering over to the couch where he flopped down, bottle still in hand. He felt uncomfortable having Steve say such things and it made it a little easier if he didn’t have to look at the blond. Not sure himself why people showing they care makes him so uncomfortable, he didn’t voice it. Instead, he decided to actually admit to Steve that he was onto something. It was something he know he’d regret sober, but drunk Tony was more open.
Everyone watched the Scarlet Witch leave in a flurry of tears. Tony felt a wave of guilt for pressuring her to come earlier. He had just wanted them all to have fun, and she had seemed so stressed lately, he thought it would cheer her up. It apparently had the opposite effect.
Steve fought the urge to throw the phone at a wall. They may as well be able to get updates. He typed back a quick thanks to JARVIS for the update.
Tony mocked in return. He screamed as Norman smashed the mallet into his other knee. A wave of nausea washed over him with the pulsing pain that remained. His legs were thoroughly destroyed at this point.
Peter and Wade let out a collective sigh of relief. They were going to get chewed out enough as it is, they didn’t need a lecture from J too.
In response, Peter extricated himself from his parents’ laps and sat next to Bruce, locking their hands together. Peter gave him an encouraging smile. Bruce kept the tiny hand in his and his eyes on Peter’s through the whole story. It was so intimate, and Steve’s heart swelled. His family was so perfect.
Bruce yawned. Phil noticed that as he cleaned his glasses he was very carefully meeting no one’s eyes. He was understandably wary about whatever this situation was that he had walked into.
Jessica confirmed. She ended the call and looked around again. It was only one more block. There were some things she’d want from the apartment if she was going to Trish’s (mainly her own liquor, Trish’s choices were atrocious) then she’d call her.
He moaned, then suddenly turned away to vomit on the forest floor. Tony put his hand out to steady himself against a tree. His whole upper body was achy, he felt hot and sweaty, his head hurt, and he was kind of dizzy. He hadn’t wanted to say anything, because they couldn’t slow their pace if they wanted to reach the city tonight.
Tony’s pained cry was louder than was safe considering there might still be enemies searching the woods. He bit down into his lip in order to quiet the others, tasting blood, but successfully quieting to muffled groans. Jenny was placing her left hand on each open wound and it felt like she was shooting some sort of liquid into them that quickly expanded and dried into a solid that stopped where it hit any flesh. Tony flexed his arm, and was impressed that the seal was water-tight.
domain. It was humiliating. He was the lord of all vampires and he had to work with humans to get rid of humans. When the war ended, the two allies parted ways, knowing the truce was finished.
Bruce said quietly before he shut the door, since Steve had already forgotten her presence. She didn’t seem offended; she was probably used to it.
she met Peter’s gaze seriously. He nodded for her to go on. Peter was a smart kid, raised by a genius, but he was only eight. Natasha barely understood her own childhood.
His voice had taken on a nostalgic tone, as if his mind was really back then. Only Phil thinks about all the tiny details like this.
Steve asked. He glanced around the room. Phil wasn’t home, and Bruce was in his lab already. It was probably for the best, because Hulk would not help the already confusing situation.
Steve kicked down the door to the dungeon where Tony was being held. SHIELD had officially forbade the team from entering Symkaria, calling it a potential catalyst for war with Latveria. Unofficially, however, Fury had given them the go ahead. He knew the team would’ve gone anyway, so he used his connections to warn the proper authorities that they’d need to play diplomatic charades to work around the fiasco.
I got a little carried away with this one, so it's the longest chapter by far. That plus starting a new job is why I've fallen a little behind, so I'm sorry about the late update! Hope y'all are still enjoying this, I'm loving writing it.
So he always had the armour now, didn’t even have to think about it. Granted, it meant that if Ultron ever did manage to make his way back from Strange’s tech-suppressing dimension, it’d be even easier to take over his body. Plus he’d be far more thoroughly fucked. But it was fine, you win some, you lose some right? Tony was trusting Dr. Strange with his life more and more than he’d ever have liked to anyway, and vice versa.
The other guests looked appalled, but didn’t argue, filing out of the house. So much for their cover.
Steve played the drive several more times. He didn’t have a choice in whether or not to tell the others. He had watched the video in the tower; if he didn’t tell anyone, JARVIS definitely would. No, everyone was about to know when he called them to the meeting. He did, however, have a choice on how to handle this. If he ordered the Avengers to stand down and let him go alone, they would argue, but they would ultimately follow his orders. They trusted him like that. Tony trusted him. He paused the video as Tony was being strangled, eyes wide and staring into the camera. Steve saw the fear clearly, but also a hard, stubborn look that was purely Tony.
Phil Coulson had never seen two grown men this into a debate about Bigfoot. That's right, Bigfoot. He watched from his perch in the corner of the room while Tony and Clint argued back and forth about the existence of the furry beast. They were both drunk, and somewhere between giggly and screaming. Phil wasn't sure he even needed to watch movies anymore when he had entertainment like this right at home.
I enjoy writing Pepper in this fic. She's gonna be a big part of the prequel on how Tony and Steve got together, and I always feel like she's tearing her hair out at these two, exasperatedly saying "Boys!" She's like Hermione if Tony and Steve were Harry and Ron in goblet of fire.
When she returned, she was being followed by a slightly darker skinned girl in a gold head wrap. Given how tight it was to the head and that there was no hair poking out underneath, Clint guessed she was probably bald or had a mohawk. In his periphery, Strange reacted to her visibly, though subtle enough that most lay people probably wouldn’t notice. It was just a slight tensing of his shoulders, something that would’ve been hidden if the man were wearing his cloak, and Clint wondered if it was a tell Strange had all the time. Maybe he could come play poker at the tower sometime.
he finished awkwardly. And there they were. His big, brown, puppy-dog eyes. Wanda agreed with Steve that while everyone thought he was the one who had mastered looking like a puppy when he wanted something, it was really Tony who’s big eyes and wobbly lip could get him anything. The man was just adorable.
he popped the ‘p.’ They were probably almost finished, and Bruce’s movements were getting more agitated by the minute. Tony watched him from the corner of his eye and noticed the way Bruce’s steps were halting and his hands were making stilted twitches as he picked up another metallic tool. He wanted to call him out on it, but sometimes just pointing out Bruce’s agitated states could push him over the edge. He had to keep the semblance of calm.
Tony slid slightly down the wall into metal shackles that were waiting in the air for him, leaning heavily against the wall as his feet hit the ground and the shackles clicked shut with a cold finality. His wrists and ankles were chained to the walls with thick chains; it was probably a bit overkill considering he couldn’t do much without the suit anyways.
he sobbed. His heart squeezed painfully again, and maybe the universe would have mercy and just smite him.
Bruce looked at each of them quickly, not willing to look Steve in the eyes, he hated those puppy dog eyes. Steve disagreed but everyone else knew he had puppy dog eyes.
He kept reiterating that he was not there to hurt the man as he got close enough to touch him. The last thing he wanted was for the injured man to wake up and hurt himself in a panic trying to defend himself.
but here's where the TW about alcoholism and depression come into play. If reading other people dealing with a relapse or addiction issues is triggering, please skip this chapter. Be safe, kiddos!
Tony was being shaken, and god, everything hurt, and his heart was racing faster than he ever thought was possible.
he managed. She handed it to him and he turned it on. The comms would connect to the Avengers immediately. That was the best he could do, there was no way he was making it anyway. His heart was taking longer pauses between the flopping sensation of skipped beats.
Everyone gave a terse check, ready to get this over with. Other than Clint and Natasha, nobody was used to missions like this. They were much more comfortable fighting giant monsters in the open than sneaking around in the dark. The sooner they were done with this the better. Plus Tony didn’t like the sound of this alien tech or whatever it was, not if the Mandarin was involved. They could be magic. Magic is the worst.
Tony didn’t even notice Thor, too busy sprinting to his boyfriend’s side. Thor waited patiently off to the side, until Tony was on his knees trying to wake Steve. Natasha and Clint were too far away to stop the god.
Steve smiled up at him a little apologetically but Tony just finished ripping off his shirt, crushing their lips together all the while. He groaned as Steve slipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth, and ripped Steve’s shirt open, a couple buttons coming off in the rush. Steve sighed and pushed Tony back, giving him that disappointed mother look he somehow pulled off while still looking like a national hero.
He had to lure the Other Guy out of here. Bruce would be so upset with himself of the Hulk destroyed all their evidence.
Tony looked at the calculations in front of him. Ideally, the reactor should be able to recharge fast enough to make up for the extra power usage, but Strange did say things may not work normally here.
Phil came into the kitchen to find his partner smiling to himself around a cup of coffee. Phil hugged the archer, letting Clint tip some of his coffee into Phil’s mouth. He watched Clint carefully, trying to read what the man was thinking about, before he snagged a kiss and pulled away. He began making their usual breakfast. Clint and Phil had found their preferred combination of breakfast foods years ago while stuck in a safehouse together for months, and the two had an unspoken agreement to alternate days making breakfast. Natasha said that the breakfast thing was when they started officially dating, though Clint hadn’t confessed his feelings until three months after that mission.
he held Steve’s hand to his chest, making sure Steve could feel Phil’s chest rise and fall. Slowly Steve’s color returned and he opened his fists, though he felt blood trickle from where his nails had gone in too far.
he tried, immediately regretting the attempt at humor. He just wasn’t good with this stuff. Really, no one was good at a conversation like this. How could you be? He squeezed Steve’s hand.
He ran out into the hall, shouting for help. Several staff came running over and he wasn’t sure what to say. Some of them could see inside, and they had been monitoring Tony’s vitals from the nurses’ station, but this was beyond their depth. Tony was clearly still alive, but his body seemed on pause.
Jane’s exasperated voice came from the back of the lab, behind a giant pile of books. Thor had reached the table before Darcy could explain though, and he flung all of the books to the side with one hand. They clattered to the ground loudly in a giant mess, and Jane yelped in surprise. When she realized who it was, her expression turned to irritation.
Luckily, he must not be bulletproof. She fell to her knees, gasping and retching. After she finished coughing enough to feel in control, she brought herself to her feet again. There were already officers there helping a shaken Mr. Marcus out of the hole. She gave her statement, and turned down the medics. She’d be fine, though her voice would be fucked up for a few days. Driving home, tired, she called each of the women in Mr. Marcus’ life.
Tony gets kidnapped by an old friend. Why did people have to hold grudges for so damn long? And couldn't they just wait until November? Was that too much to ask?
Tony didn’t have the chance to prepare himself before all he heard were his own screams. The pain was everywhere, no apparent source or focal point because fucking
he pulled out his government ID with his other hand while Zelma tentatively shook his outstretched hand. She stared at the ID for a moment before looking back at the stranger with wide eyes. Phil dropped her hand, gesturing for her to sit down again. She looked conflicted, but after a calm nod from Heather, she slumped back into a chair.
Phil’s voice was soothing and perfectly calm. Only Clint could hear the worry underlying Phil’s tone. Steve tried to follow the directions, managing to hold the air for 3 seconds and not completely blow it all out at once.
Steve could hear the asshole’s laughter from the other side of the portal as it shut behind them. Loki had been up to mischief as usual, but when Iron Man ended the battle too quickly for his liking, he got angry.
This also references a couple Iron Man 616 events that involve Doom. Where these would fit into the timeline of this group of Avengers meeting each other is a complete mystery, so don't overthink it. They're just one-shots.
Everyone was still watching him like he had grown a second head. He squirmed uncomfortably in Steve’s lap.
The Avengers were having an average breakfast when she appeared. Tony was staring ahead, not really awake, while he sipped his coffee, with Thor across from him. A woman with long dark hair and green eyes appeared silently behind the god, a faint purple aura around her. Clint noticed her first, but she only had eyes for Tony.
It should have been angry but they could all hear the fondness. Despite their increase in fights recently, Tony and Steve were still sickeningly smitten with each other since last October.
It started out as an alliance. Vlad Dracula had fought alongside Captain America as tentative allies when HYDRA took over Transylvania. The nazi organization took over
The silence was deafening and sudden after the blasting metal from a moment ago. Tony looked around in confusion.
Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet.
Mr. Doll had no super-powers. He had no suits of armour, no genius IQ, he wasn’t even particularly strong, agile or attractive. Mr. Doll was a normal human with normal ambitions and desires. He blamed the job market for his lapses in ethics. How was he to compete for wealth in this country against attractive geniuses and people who came from wealthy families and had all the right connections? He tried the whole work hard and save money method, but after multiple occasions of being let go from companies that were downsizing, despite his loyal, hard work, it was hard to keep at it.
he spat. Tony wasn’t trying to sound so angry, but it helped mask the urge to cry instead. He felt like a little kid again.
The castle reminded Steve of Dracula’s, all cold and dimly lit. Not that there were any sources of light around, but physics didn’t seem to apply here anyway. Natasha and Steve easily took out the patrol gargoyles they happened upon in the hallway, so they hoped Nightmare still didn’t know they were here.
It started out as an alliance. Vlad Dracula had fought alongside Captain America as tentative allies when HYDRA took over Transylvania. The nazi organization took over
Your friends explained what cannibalism is. I resent your calling me a cannibal, she said matter-of-factly.
The room was full of nods in generic agreement, except for Tony, who was scanning the room to see everyone’s nodding.
He wasn’t really expecting a response, already turning his thoughts to other topics while he drained another glass. The silence that settled into the room made him look up, confused. Everyone was staring at him.
he singsonged. It was so at odds with the mood of the room, that it broke the tension. Steve could feel them all shift, changing focus and allowing the stifling emotions to dissipate.
He would say, gesturing at all of Tony with a look of disgust on his face. God, Tony was pathetic. He still let his dead father ruin things and effect his reactions to silly pranks after all these years.
Clint didn’t know what to think of this reaction. Steve sounded so emotionless, but he could see something simmering underneath. It wasn’t anger, at least not at Tony, and there was worry mixed in there. But the fact that he wasn’t the open book he normally was terrified Clint. Steve was hiding something from them. Clint filed that information away for later.
They decided to stick with the same schedule for watch that night. Tony was confident that this was the night. Bigfoot was gonna show. Clint nestled into another tree with his night-vision goggles on, bow on his back. He scanned the forest, seeing the occasional fox and hearing some coyotes in the distance. The wind chill was worse up in the trees, so he hugged his arms around himself to keep warm. It seemed a little unbelievable if he let himself think to hard about the fact that he was sitting in a tree in California in the middle of the night all because Thor had asked about the ‘Midgardian Bigfoot’ he had heard about on the ‘internets.’
Tony made a shooing motion, already bored with this. The vague threats with no name were always so boring, plus they never ended up getting past security. He pulled out his tablet and the newest specs for Natasha’s stinger upgrades were up, so he started working on those.
It turned out that Norman wanted Tony to tell him how to replicate his particle accelerator to create badassium. The patent company didn’t allow him to call the new element powering the reactor that, but Tony had the best lawyers. He hadn’t given up.
the voice begged. Who was that? It sounded weird. Like lots of voices. Tony thought of the Delightful Children from Down the Lane. He should maybe watch less cartoons. The person was shaking him harder.
With the suit off, he couldn’t see what happened, but he heard one last yell from Strange, and his arm get tugged forward until he was laying face first on the ground, still trapped in the frozen suit. He hoped it was the ground of the tower, and not the castle.
an ally. Norman was ruthless and had apparently, lost it. So here Tony was, contemplating the possibility of an October curse, strapped to a metal table with Osborn menacing above him. He had no idea where this room was in the world, but he doubted it was on Oscorp premises or he’d have been rescued by now. Norman had taken him right in front of the Avengers.
Steve collapsed into the nearest chair, trembling again. A heart attack? He thought those were something old people had. Was this related to his illness earlier? He held his face in his hands, unable to look at any of them. He startled up when he heard the door open and a doctor walked out to them.
The Sorcerer looked the picture of innocence, but Clint could see the cruel glee dancing in his eyes. Tony and Strange may act like they were so different, but Clint knew the truth. They were basically the same person, and they both equally loved to fuck with him.
Clint started following him and they made their way to the conference room in companionable silence. When they walked in, Bruce and Natasha were sitting at one end of the long table talking quietly and Fury was at the other end writing things and tapping away at his phone.
In general, the tower was quieter than usual, subdued. A lot had happened recently, and everyone was handling it in their own way.
Thor said sadly, a terribly bittersweet smile playing across his lips. He could feel Jane's life slipping away and he wasn't going to be able to save her. Why had the Mandarin taken her too? Just to get at him?
he stopped short. Tony was on his knees, shaky breaths in between heaving sobs wracking his small frame. The smears and streams down his face were of blood, and the man was clearly not present. Steve waved a hand in front of Tony’s face, but he didn’t even blink. Steve knelt down beside him, terrified and unsure what to do. The car was gone, someone must’ve taken it after they left him like this, but what did they do!? Tony’s pained gasp urged Steve through the fear, and he put a hand on the man’s shoulder. He shook it violently, screaming at Tony to please wake up. It took several minutes before the man blinked hard, and seemed to suddenly become aware of his surroundings.
Peter stood in front of Tony, mimicking the man’s body language. He cleared his throat. Tony was thrilled to see where this was going.
Tony woke slowly. He didn’t want to open his eyes. The soft pillows and warmth of his blanket were so enticing. A smile played at his lips as he reached over, eyes still closed, to feel for Steve.
Steve kissed him, which conveniently gave him the excuse to be right at Tony’s eye level as he said,
Tony slumped in defeat, accepting that they were going to talk about this. Bruce never fell for his distraction tactics unless he was just humoring Tony.
His tone stopped Tony short. Bruce was his best friend; he never meant to make Bruce sound so hurt and bone-tired.
When they walked into the waiting area, Bruce looked up in surprise. He hadn’t been sitting here that long had he?
sorry I haven't touched this in years. It still exists though, and inspiration struck, so I figured I should finish it, even if no one is still reading.
he said sarcastically. There was no malice behind it, and he placed a kiss on Steve’s nose to make it obvious.
There had been a big battle with AIM yesterday morning, followed immediately by an attack on the west coast by Hydra. They had all come home exhausted.
The corner of her lips twitched into a near smile, the false memories bittersweet. She sometimes wish they were real, because they were much nicer than her reality.
Clint wrenched the knife out what he had taken to calling the doombots’ neck and it twitched on the ground uselessly. There weren’t many vulnerable openings on these things. He supposed they weren’t actually doombots, that’s what Doctor Doom called his look-alike bots, and there were much less humanoid, but the team was just calling any bots Doom showed up with doombots at this point. Tony and Clint had been coming up with names for each type for a while, but it was only fun for the first ten times.
her lips were quivering as she talked, and she looked so pale. But Thor could also see the determination in her eyes to make him save others before her.
Steve looked back and forth between the smug bastard and his love, ignoring the awkward silence that had descended on the party while the drama unfolded. Tony was right, he didn’t know what had gotten into him. He stood, pushing the waiter towards one of the guards, who caught the stumbling man easily and pinned his arms behind his back.
Things were looking good for her until Krupp suddenly smirked back. He shouldn’t look that confident in the face of her strength. He lurched forward. She wasn’t fast enough to avoid the hand that now gripped her throat. Krupp lifted her in the air, and she kicked him uselessly. She pried at his fingers, gasping for breath, but Krupp was stronger than her.
Tony shuddered at the thought of having Strange in his head, but it was better than possibly having the Mandarin in there.
Before he knew it he was flat on his back in a small Iron Man-shaped crater in the asphalt. His HUD display was fizzling in and out. He let out a low groan.
Tony grinned, intertwining his fingers with Steve. Being an Avenger was a wild ride, and often dangerous, but sometimes, it was just fun.
he assured her. Natasha wasn’t sure when she had become so entangled in this family; she never imagined she’d love a child like she loved Peter Stark-Rogers. Having children had never been in her own plans, but she would give anything for this kid’s happiness.
The Avengers wait for Tony to wake up. Pepper is so tired of Steve and Tony's shit. Poor Pepper, Rhodes and JARVIS, the Tony crew that aren't even there during battles to protect him. Nobody even calls them until something's wrong. Loving Tony can be very tiring.
Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve’s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat.
I couldn't resist the excuse to talk about Clint's deafness, which I still wish was in the MCU, I'll admit. I tried to mimic the grammar rules of ASL when they use it here, but I'll admit my ASL is limited to only what I need for talking to my autistic brother. I apologize for any inaccuracies or mis-portrayals, and I make ZERO claim to understanding the deaf community or what deafness is like. I try to do justice, and if I offended anyone, please let me know.
he told his anxiety, now was hardly a good time for a panic attack. There was a civilian in need right in front of him.
Thor said from behind her. She turned and moved to let him step into the group semi circle they had formed.
he ground out. Looked like the wound in his side was the biggest blood loss, and there were thankfully only two others. One clean through and through shot in his right bicep, which was impressive because that meant two separate layers of the armour hadn’t even slowed down the bullet. The other wound was in his left calf.
Steve asked quietly. Bruce looked up, but it was clear that Steve’s question hadn’t made sense to him.
The relief was short lived. With the intermittent shocks no longer distracting him, Tony could now focus on the feeling of the shrapnel moving towards his heart and the pain spreading from his wound.
Peter stared at Wade for a moment in silence. He wished he could control his blush whenever Wade complimented him, it was so embarrassing.
The night had been uneventful and boring as hell. Clint nearly fell asleep on his branch a couple times purely out of boredom. Tony reported a similar experience, but was still confident in his endeavor to prove the existence to Clint. Plus, the weekend was going to be a success for him either way.
Tony had to fight the urge to look away. It was hard to meet the haunted look in Steve’s eyes. He had to admit, he had never felt so close to death before. The ache in his chest made sense now if he had been resuscitated that many times. There was no good way to respond to a revelation like that. Nothing could convey all the feelings warring in his chest.
And he was begging. He searched the Hulk’s eyes and he could see the conflict warring in them. Whatever had set Bruce off, he was clearly in less control than usual and Tony suspected it was somehow similar to Loki’s staff all those years ago.
Steve let go of Tony’s shoulders, glancing around. A spent syringe lie on the metal tray a few feet away. He shoved it in his pocket before moving back to Tony’s side. He hoped it wasn’t poison. Tony had screwed his eyes shut and was whimpering brokenly between shallow gasps. Steve left the tool inside the genius, knowing it was helping staunch the blood flow, and scooped up Tony bridal style. The smaller man looked so fragile, clutching to Steve’s shirt with trembling hands. Steve was a lifeline.
In his excitement, Tony climbed down faster than he should’ve. He didn’t slip, he was a graceful athlete thank you very much, but the nice exercise burn had turned into a throbbing ache in his one arm, and he was sweating by the time he reached Steve.
Strange was explaining to Bruce and Natasha as Phil walked up. Clint was over talking to a few of the other agents.
As Vision flew beside the jet towards Transylvania, already intangible just in case Dracula was watching, Steve talked to him through the calms.
Strange said simply. Tony couldn’t decide if he respected the bluntness or wished the man would’ve tried to soften the blow. It was probably best he knew the gravity of this, he supposed.
he managed. It was so quiet that Steve only made it out with his enhanced hearing. He wished he could say more, apologize for being stupid and reckless. The sharp pain in his chest was getting unbearable now, and the pain became his focal point. It was all that was left that defined him. He had always known the shrapnel in his heart would kill him one day, but he had kind of hoped it’d come with more warning.
The night was already out of his control. Steve shot Tony a glare. They would talk about this later. Just because Tony had no semblance of a sleep schedule did not mean that Peter should inherit the bad habit.
Phil and Steve let out the same long-suffering sigh. Tony had to say, getting hurt with someone else was more fun than alone. Wait, no, that sounded terrible in his head. It’s not that he likes someone else getting hurt, but it was less lonely. Whatever. His brain was not functioning properly. Actually, why had no one brought him coffee yet?
and that wasn’t Bruce’s voice, that was the Hulk’s voice. Tony turned back to his friend, the suit emerging from beneath his skin. He was just in time to see Bruce’s torn shirt fall off, the rest of his clothing already on the ground except his superflex shorts Tony had designed himself. One could only be faced with Hulk’s penis a few times before they took matters into their own hands.
he begged. He had not been prepared to fight a sentient machine, or possibly remote controlled. His powers were only useful against people.
Now that he was here, what was he supposed to do? It would probably take ages for Bruce to find him here, he had chosen the floor at random. Tony jumped into a chair in one of the rooms, rolling it over towards the windows so he could look at the view. Maybe he should come up with some more stuff to fill these floors so he had an excuse to visit them. The view was very different here than up in the penthouse. He obviously couldn’t see as much of New York, but he could make out the details of the street a little better. Plus the way the sunlight shone through between the gaps between buildings was kind of nice. Maybe Steve would like an art studio. That’d be a good use.
Stephen's face was right there and he was saying something but Tony couldn't make it out over the roaring sound in his ears and his lungs were burning. He tried desperately to breathe again and his vision went black.
Tony was already over this. He was not excited for whatever this shithead magician coward who was torturing him without showing their face had in store for him next. His lightheadedness was getting worse. Tony had calmed enough to open his eyes and watch Wanda and Strange. They shared another meaningful look. Wanda stepped backwards towards the corner of the room. Apparently, they decided Strange would be handling this for now.
He attempted to hide his grimace of pain as Steve lifted him into the car like he was a child. His legs weren’t broken for Pete’s sake. Judging by Steve’s brow furrowing, he wasn’t very successful.
The wound in Tony’s side was bleeding fast, but he couldn’t pay any attention to putting pressure on it when at random, the damaged reactor with a bullet wedged in it was sparking, sending painful shocks through him. He arched painfully as his body seized through another shock. His hands were shaking too violently to be of any use as he tried to get the reactor out.
Tony made a movement that might have been a one armed shrug, but it was hard to tell. Clint thought he caught a mumbled ‘yeah, whatever’ but his hearing aids could only do so much.
Peter watched his dads argue, looking back and forth between them. This is exactly why he hadn’t wanted to ask. A perfectly nice family picnic had become a small feud. He laid back with a sigh, staring up at the blood moon. Tuning them out was getting easier. Peter loved them so much, all of the avengers family, but boy could they turn the smallest disagreement into the largest fight. He supposed it probably had to do with living in a constant battle-ready state. Maybe he should stark taking notes on them all. The Psychology of Superheroes. It could be a thesis in grad school or something. Even though the plan was still chemistry. Tony had multiple PhDs, why not him?
The problem was that lately she had been opening up. It was easy to control oneself when you remained mostly isolated and only showed your surface emotions. Other than with Pietro, Wanda had successfully remained emotionally distant from the world for the last several years. That was until Vision. He had wormed his way into her heart when she wasn’t looking, and now she felt volatile. She had never known love like this, and with it her walls came crumbling down all together. Suddenly she was an open book around all of the Avengers, laughing and crying with the smallest provocation. Vision had convinced her to let down her guard a little, that she could feel without destroying, but she had no practice with happy mediums.
Steve asked in wonder as they headed out for the limo, already assaulted by paparazzi. The security detail for the Avengers was being handled by SHIELD and SI together given the amount of super-powered enemies they had all acquired over the years. Tony had the bracelets to call the suit if needed, Steve had the shield waiting at the gala in a closet, Clint had his foldable bow with arrows stored next to Steve’s shield, Thor was always able to call Mjolnir, and Phil and Natasha were strapped with handguns and knives.
Vampires were superior. They were stronger, faster, lived longer, and could learn far more than humans if only because of there prolonged lifespans. The top of the food chain was a vampire, and he ruled them all. Why would he ever want to return to the sad state of a mortal man, too caught up and puny conflicts and violence to recognize the overall pointlessness of his murders and impailings. No, if he allowed Tony Stark to live with this vampire cure knowledge, he’d be failing in his duty to his entire race.
I know this is late, but I finished it at like 2AM promptly passed out. Original sin was such a tricky prompt to me, because it didn't really seem to fit the Halloween theme at all. And trust me, I already know that what I wrote about is not actually original sin, I went to Catholic school. But I figure Tony probably doesn't know his church teachings anyways.
They got dinner and decided Clint would take the first shift of the night, since Tony’s body was more worn out from their archery lessons. Clint decided to talk Tony into something more relaxing tomorrow.
He squeezed again, and this would be Tony’s last sight. His best friend killing him and he had no one to blame. He tried to inhale, but was choking on his own blood. The last thing he saw before his vision darkened was lightning strike the Hulk.
So Tony Stark started his life anew. He began to think of himself as having a before and after version. This was the after-Afghanistan version. He was now Tony 2.0. New Tony made it his life’s mission to pay for his sins and the sins of his father, and he had a lot to pay for. That was what the other Avengers didn’t seem to grasp when they would berate him for neglecting himself.
That was just completely unfair. Clint liked old things to decorate his room. Lots of people liked antiques. Granted, he did pick the stranger looking objects typically, but only because it reminded him of his carnie days in a good way.
Phil's fingers closed around Clint's and they slowly made their way towards the chaos surrounding capsicle and the Mandarin.
I know, it's very late. I'm so sorry. Life got busier because I just started a new job at a comic book shop.
If that didn’t sound like a hurt child, Clint isn’t the greatest marksman in the world (and he most certainly is).
Iron man was still standing but the reactor was dim and flickering. Clint might very well be dead soon if not already and Tony was going to die if the reactor failed and he couldn’t take this. He made it to his boyfriend’s side in time to watch the armour land flat on it’s back. Steve couldn’t see Tony’s expression when he lifted the faceplate, his tears leaving everything blurry. The reactor finally went dark and Tony arched his back, gasping.
The sorcerer looked like he might be losing. It was hard to tell, because some of the attacks seemed to be mental or invisible, and some of them were energy beams. What he could tell was that Strange’s reactions were getting slower, and his screams weaker.
Steve was shaking a little, and he felt Phil push him down into a chair. The room cleared out, and he couldn’t tear his gaze away from Tony, his own heart still racing. They had just been fine and having a good time a few moments ago.
Clint watched the glass shattered, and noticed what was happening immediately. Waving his hands around wildly until everyone was looking at him, he addressed the room. ROOM SILENT, CORRECT? He signed, mouthing ‘Am I right in assuming you all hear silence?’ Clint had opted out of his hearing aids for the day, so he hadn’t noticed the unnatural quiet. When everyone looked so concerned and lacked a reaction to the shattered glass, he thought about Wanda’s shout. She must’ve mistakenly cast a spell on everyone there. Chaos magic had been known to do stranger. When everyone nodded in response he continued. W-A-N-D-A CAST SPELL US ACCIDENT, he gestured from the elevator to the group of people. ‘Wanda cast a spell on us. Presumably, by accident.’
Steve placed the tablet on the bedside table and looked around the room. At some point Pepper and Rhodey had shown up while Steve was engrossed in the conversation with JARVIS. Julie knocked and walked in again, introducing herself before washing her hands. Clint watched her with sharp eyes, Natasha watched in that way that looked like she wasn’t, and Thor visibly made himself more menacing with his stance. When Julie turned around from the sink she balked.
Steve wasn’t sure how long they sat there in silence. All emotions had left him behind in the dust, and his empty shell just felt cold. Eventually, they went home to the tower, and Natasha showered him and put him to bed. Steve didn’t help or fight it, just let the spy push him through the motions. He nodded without looking at here when she told him she’d wake him for visiting hours in the morning. Darkness swallowed him.
He jumped up and threw on some sweatpants. If Tony was asking for him and not Steve, this couldn’t be good.
he mumbled, and Clint’s heart broke. After all this time together, Tony still felt inadequate for Steve. It didn’t matter to him that he was Steve’s world and that Steve would love him no matter what. Tony still hated himself. Clint could understand; he still felt he didn’t deserve Phil, and at least Phil wasn’t an American icon.
Decades later, Dracula had new enemies and plans, and if Anthony Edward Stark and Steven Rogers had to die for those plans, so be it.
The family of four stepped out, the two children arguing while the parents looked too tired to care. As soon as they were far enough down the street, Natasha and Clint strolled out of their hiding spot, headed for the deli. As they walked in, Natasha said something about
Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve’s mother had followed the woman’s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance.
The rascal even made it as far as the hallway before Steve caught up to him, scooping up the squealing bundle.
Steve said quickly. Tony squeezed his eyes shut against the dizziness and wave of nausea. He focused solely on his breathing until it passed. The coolness of the sheets felt amazing. Steve started to tuck him under the blanket, but Tony kicked it all off.
It rose to a near shout. Tony flinched instinctively, not used to Steve’s actually angry voice in the close quarters of the small kitchen. Steve lowered his voice again, annoyed that he had made Tony flinch.
See what I did there? Strange? I find myself way too funny. Anyway, rescue mission, thank goodness. Poor Tony can only handle so much. I love hurting him I'm terrible.
Tony decided maybe more questions would distract him, although he was sure it would be prolonging the inevitable.
Tony said. Steve leaned in and they kissed gently. They would have plenty of time for passionate kisses.  The rest of their lives, in fact.
He searched Clint’s face for a sign that the man had understood what he said. Clint’s eyes were glassy, but he nodded firmly. He knew what Tony meant. The scream would haunt them all.
Staring after him for a few moments, Steve grew cold. Right, clothes. He pulled his clothes on slowly, thinking about everything. This felt too weird, like it wasn’t real. Tony was cheerful and had free time. Was this a dream? The sound of Tony elbowing the machine beside him startled Steve out of his reverie.
Tony was a disaster. Steve slid into the chair beside the bed and took in the sight. He was covered in bandages nearly everywhere except his head. He had a breathing tube and multiple IVs, one of which was giving him blood. There was also a tube sticking out of his right rib cage. Steve idly wondered how much blood Tony had lost. His legs were both broken, his left forearm was broken, and Steve could only assume every one of his fingers on his left hand given the way the cast extended all the way down. Steve heard his own choked gasp before he noticed the tears streaming down his cheeks. Why? Why did he have to love someone with so many powerful enemies?
Strange was unruffled by the outburst. He supposed he wouldn’t care about the details in Tony’s shoes.
JARVIS sounded pitying. Tony picked up the lamp that was wrapped in his stupid invention, a rubbery self adhesive that sought heat so it’d curve around bodies to get to their body-heat, the ‘flex cage’ he had been so proud of only moments ago. He hurled the lamp across the room, where it shattered against the wall. He had been so certain of his revenge this year! Then he had been taken down by an air horn. What kind of a genius couldn’t out plan Clint Barton?
JARVIS lit a path past the main elevator to a back one, and through the hallway on the opposite side of the floor from the gym to Tony and Steve’s room. When they got into the room, Clint sat Tony on the bed and stripped him. Tony just stared ahead unseeing, having completely turned in on himself. Clint hoped he wasn’t just in their beating himself up for more things that almost certainly weren’t his fault. Unfortunately, Clint knew him; he probably was.
Tony hadn’t been back here since the last time when he had to fight off a demonic faux Howard in order to escape. Morgana had her own hideouts, he knew, so why were they here? He really did not have the tools or energy to deal with Mephisto himself, if he could even pray to lay a scratch on Morgana.
The three SHIELD agents could tell from Tony’s glances that he was embarrassed to have anyone but Steve see him like this, so they motioned for Thor to follow and left. Tony let out a moan as soon as they were gone, grateful for the privacy to vocalize the pain. He’d rather Steve didn’t have to see this, either, but he also needed Steve for his sanity. Strange disappeared in a sudden implosion of the air around the space he had been occupying, and Wanda was the only one who didn’t jump at the large CRACK.
Tony whined, squirming under his touch. Tony managed to grab a hold of the back of Steve’s neck, tugging him up to kiss him roughly. As Tony bit down lightly on Steve’s lower lip, Tony undid Steve’s belt then shoved off the clothes with his feet. He was not having any more of this delay.
His nausea subsided as they walked, but the rest of Tony’s symptoms only got worse. He felt weak and shaky. It was fortunate that Steve could easily carry his shield and the suit, because there’s no way Tony would be able to carry anything like this. It took enough effort just to keep placing one foot in front of the other. Tony had survived much worse than spiders. He could do this.
Steve closed his eyes and held his breath for a second. He said a quick prayer that all of this would go well, opened his eyes, making the sign of the cross.
Jane asked in a worry laced voice. She reached up and tucked some of his golden hair behind his ear, searching his eyes for answers. There was so much fear and sadness there, and not the aching far away sadness she was used to with Thor, but a raw sadness; a fresh wound.
Alexi stepped out from behind the Mandarin, and Natasha didn’t even blink. How many times would her husband’s face be used against her? She knew what had to be done and she’d do it again and again; she didn’t know why they thought this would do anything to weaken her. She took him down at the knees and was ready to snap his neck when he spoke.
he answered without missing a beat. Steve’s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they’d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fiancé. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he’d like to see Howard’s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.
That was… actually genius. Maybe they should let Clint do the planning more often. Steve had been so caught up in the impossibility to sneak into Castle Dracula, that he forgot to consider technology as a way past the supernatural. Tony would be ecstatic at the thought of tech winning against vampires yet again.
He scooped Tony up like a child. He was so light, probably because he almost never ate. It said a lot about Tony’s mental state that he didn’t complain about being treated like a baby. He just buried his face into Clint’s stomach, murmuring apologies.
he drawled. They both knew that Natasha was a great spy, but Clint could pull off a con like nobody’s business. The older man laid down beside the archer on the bed, and they turned to face each other.
Jessica woke up in the dark. She tried to sit up and promptly hit her head. She looked around in the pitch black, feeling the small box she was in.
the Mandarin’s deep voice echoed as he sauntered towards them. He looked at each of them, an arrogant smile plastered across his face until his gaze landed on Dr. Strange, wiping the smug look off in an instant.
Mr. Doll must’ve decided he was getting impatient, or perhaps got frustrated. Instead of another broken bone, Tony suddenly doubled over with a pained scream that he cut off with a sharp intake of air through grit teeth. His left side felt like a sword had gone through him. Steve gently pushed him back into his position laying on the bed, and gasped. Tony didn’t have to look to know why as he felt the warmth of blood seeping out of the new wound.
Also I finally figured out how I like to make Tony's override codes so that they can mean things, and hid a little joke so if you figure it out, let me know :)
Pure hurt/comfort with semi-graphic torture. Torturing Tony is a favourite pastime of mine, so this prompt I had to restrain myself from drawing it out forever. I promise it's only out of my vast love for Tony. Yes, it does suck to be loved by me. There's comfort in the end and a pinch of fluff with Steve. Love can mitigate any pain.
The Hulk bounded for the Mandarin, roaring with anger that his best friend was hurt. He felt the crunch beneath his left fist as he was nearing his foe and he turned around in confusion. There on the floor was Tony, crushed beneath the weight of the Hulk. That didn’t make any sense; Tony had been up on the wall. Suddenly he was Bruce again as his shaking hands touched Tony’s face. It was real; there was no illusion. Bruce felt for a pulse but there was none, Tony’s body was lifeless. He had been breathing when they arrived, Bruce was sure of it. Bruce’s mind stuttered to a halt; what had he done? It had finally happened. He had killed his best friend.
he greeted, wiggling in across from him in the nook. His legs had to go between Steve’s and the window, which required a little twisting and flexibility, but Steve just watched him, laughing.
Tony rolled his eyes. Nothing dangerous could be down there. What would it even be living off of anyway? It had not left since appearing, according to JARVIS, and there was nothing down there as a water or food source.
She watched with open interest as Tony had the suit reform around him, but left the faceplate up. Better safe than sorry, plus it would probably help keep him on his feet.
Bruce let out a soft hmm, not looking at his friend anymore. He muttered under his breath, but Tony couldn’t make it out.
She held out her hand expectantly until they each placed a five dollar bill in her hand. Her grin was reminiscent of Clint’s in childhood when they had a good scam going and he was going to be able to treat himself with the income. She was already barely paying attention to them, counting the number of bills in her hands.
Steve startled awake as the nurse came in. He smiled at him as she checked Tony’s vitals and IVs, adjusting their drip rate.
A man nearby asked. Tony leaned over to whisper in Steve’s ear that it was Ian Gerund, a reporter for
Tony and Clint have a yearly competition in October to see who can get the other to scream first. They called their schemes pranks, but Steve thought they bordered on cruel torture sometimes. If only the two would put this much energy into plans against enemies. Sure, Tony was a sore loser after losing the last three years, but it was really Clint's fault for being such a sore winner, okay? Tony was out for blood this year. Revenge for his losing streak would be oh so sweet.
Tony was so thankful that the cave was facing the rising sun so he could fully appreciate the blush that coloured Steve’s cheeks.
They laid there for a few more moments, just content in each others’ company. When Tony sat up, Steve had to stop himself from whimpering. He wanted the genius to stay there, but he knew there was work to be done. Tony seemed to read his mind, because he turned to give Steve a long, deep kiss that left them both slightly breathless.
he tried, before grabbing his throat in frustration. Tony jerked in surprise when he saw Thor’s sudden movement in his periphery. The god threw a glass at the ground, where it shattered at Tony’s feet. Only, there was no sound to the shatter. It at least verified that something more than Tony’s voice being gone was going on. Had Tony suddenly gone deaf?
They snuggled into the couch again, Peter forcing his dads to lean on each other to hold his tiny hands in the middle. He balanced himself on one leg from each of them. Without speaking, he pointed at Thor.
Loki mocked. When Tony made no indication that he’d return the banter, the god lifted his scepter threateningly.
nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn’t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn’t handle Steve being with a man. That was all.  The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.
