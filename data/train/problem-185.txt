“It is a pleasure to meet you, although I could wish it were under less stressful circumstances,” she says in a deep voice. Her accent marks her as being from York; the quality of her clothes speaks of both wealth and frequent trips to Paris as well as London; the shape of her fingers beneath her gloves and the stoop of her shoulders suggests long hours spent with books and writing; and her title is unusual to almost the point of impossibility. A Dame in her own right, but Queen Victoria does not knight women except under the most unusual circumstances – or at least not as far as I am aware. But I have ample evidence that there is much I was unaware of until the last half-year. “Thank you for coming, Dame Patience,” I say, not bothering to hide my keen interest. “I was unaware that Her Majesty had invested any women into the knightly orders. To which order do you belong?”
It was spring when our affair, such as it was, came to an end. Very little else changed. We remained friends who shared rooms, and I still accompanied him on cases whenever I could. I thought that was what he wanted. I thought that was all I could have. I was content to keep what I had.
Watson’s eyelids drift closed. His mouth moves, and then he drinks at last. I see this throat swallow several times before he sags more heavily into my supporting arms. He did not consume very much, but we need less blood than myth and superstition suggest. I have to believe it is enough.
I have long been aware that Watson is modest by nature and prone to downplaying his own sterling qualities. It has led him to overlooking some of his natural advantages in the past, but I have rarely if ever heard him utter such nonsense as he speaks now.  “It would be as accurate to say that if you weren’t so extraordinarily gifted in resisting blood thirst, you wouldn’t have been with Ancaster at all,” I point out. “Which is to say you are theorizing ahead of the facts, and without investigating all of the possibilities. It’s entirely possible neither aspect of your nature is necessarily at the root of what happened to you.”
I feel it when pain smashes through John Watson like a tidal bore, dragging him under, drowning his mind and body both. He shouts, one arm swinging out wildly and smashing his assailant into the wall even as he crumples, collapsing next to the boy he just saved.
me with my own mesmeric abilities.
It wasn’t easy. I was still deep in grief for Mary and Arthur. In a very real way I was still mourning the loss of Holmes as well, both his imagined death and the reality of his actions. To learn that he had been alive all that time and had let me believe otherwise was a terrible blow. It was not the first time he had deceived me about his well-being, but it was by far and away the worst, not just in magnitude, but because he should have known better. He knew how badly his prior deceptions had wounded me, and he’d done it again regardless.  My mood and my health both suffered in reaction to the shock. I suffered from more than one bout of black moods.  I never knew when simmering cauldron of sorrow and anger that perpetually lived in my chest would turn into a bottomless pool, pulling me under. I recovered slowly, changed once again and uncertain about everything.

Lestrade huffs but looks pleased. “Still, I’d like to know how he died. Can Doctor Watson have a look - ” The inspector stops, chagrin mixed with faint concern marring his features. “My apologies. I’m so used to your working together, I forgot he wasn’t with us. I suppose he must have had a patient who needed his attention. I can’t imagine what else would have delayed him so.”
Free at last, I lose no time hailing a cab and sending him in Watson’s direction. I can
Watson is there before him, blocking his way, putting his body between the criminal and the innocent. It is both entirely characteristic of him, and entirely logical, for he can withstand what the child cannot –
Even if he were nearby, I could not read his thoughts unless he allowed it. He has learned enough to shield himself, as I learned before him. At this distance we cannot speak mind to mind unless we both concentrate on that and nothing else. When we do that, it appears that we have fallen into a trance or a doze, depending on whether we leave our eyes open. It is not a distraction I can afford with a raid about to start and with Lestrade nearby.  Even if I were safely at Baker Street, I would hesitate to attempt it, for fear that I might distract Watson at a critical juncture. For he is in danger, I am nearly certain of it.
So we will leave London and start life again somewhere else, somewhere in the countryside. I do not know what that life will bring, except that it will be full of changes. Holmes and I will navigate them together.  I can only hope we will be as ultimately fortunate in our future circumstances as we have been in our renewed life together.
By the time the Ancasters have reached the end of the street, it is over. Every person who had a hand in their abduction is unconscious except for the ringleader.  He tells me
Her tests are like nothing Watson does as a doctor. If anything, they are closer to what I do in chemistry.  Her bag contains many vials of reagents, as she calls them, along with glass jars, a candle in a holder, and a stack of precisely-cut cotton squares. She uses a pair of long-handled forceps to pick up each square and lightly swab it against Watson’s skin – sometimes his hands, sometimes his forehead, and sometimes his lips as she asks him to breathe on it – before placing each sample in its own jar and adding a few drops from one of the reagents to it before quickly sealing it.
In the grim, grief-shrouded days of that autumn and winter, I sometimes wished they had failed as I had failed. I knew it was neither logical nor kind, but my heart knew little of either state in that terrible time. But I have survived many things, and I survived this too. With the help of friends, I slowly recovered. I started to rebuild what I could of my shattered life.
die, Doctor. Your heart stopped, your lungs ceased. You were dead, however briefly. You revived, and how and why this sometimes occurs is still not something we can explain. Some who have done so have said, then or later, that they had some great task or purpose still unfinished, but it is by no means universal - ”
I free Ancaster and his son and send them to safety after removing every memory of ever having been here. They will come to themselves once safely at home, with false memories of cleverly escaping their kidnappers when a violent altercation broke out between the two men who tried to abduct them.  They will have no recollection of Watson having been caught up in their adventure at all.
“Perhaps they needed someone to believe he was alive – or at least obscure the fact that he was no longer among the living,” I suggest.
A blackmailer came perilously close to uncovering our dearest secret.
To my surprise, Watson blushes furiously. “Even if that is so, Dame Patience, you are still a woman, and it would hardly be appropriate for you to - ”
A surprising result is discussed, as are potential ramifications.
He is not nearby. It only takes the faintest brushing of my mind against his to know that he is some distance away, and that something is very wrong. He is on high alert. There is danger.
It is not even a meal, just a blight best removed from London.
“Natural aptitudes play a part,” Mycroft murmurs with a knowing glance in my direction. “As do natural aversions. My brother delights in disguise, in interrogation, and in misdirection. Making others believe that they see something other than what is real is a natural extension for him, as is getting others to answer his questions. You, on the other hand, have a reputation for honesty and directness. Small wonder, then, that compelling others to believe untruths does not come easily to you. I suggest you start with an aspect that more closely aligns with your training and personality. Perhaps the sleep compulsion; it is much the same as using poppy syrup to assist a patient into slumber, without the risk of dangerous side effects.”
Ordinary or not, it cannot be doing Watson any good lodged in his shoulder. I pull on a glove to shield my skin in case there is some kind of enchantment (for lack of any better word) or poison.  I rip away the clothes around the wound, the better to see what damage there is and avoid making it worse when I remove the blade.
name him Sherlock, for his brother himself had never really cared for his Christian name.
I cut him off with a gentle finger to his lips. “Then let us walk to the street and hail a cab. Questions can wait until after we reach Baker Street.” I want Watson safe behind walls and wards as soon as possible. I do not know what caused his pain and collapse, or whether it might happen again. Questions are important, answers are even more important, but nothing is as important as Watson’s safety.
He courted me, not in any standard sense, but in his own unique manner. For he had changed, too. The man he had been would have demanded my presence, expected it with a cool confidence if not regarded it as a certainty. The man he was after his return respected my losses, recognized and acknowledged his part in them, and regretted both that and his loss of me – the loss of the relationship we had shared, the loss of trust. He hoped for better, he wanted to repair our friendship at the very least, but he also knew that his wanting alone could not make it so. His efforts – and there were many – were necessary but could not be sufficient in and of themselves.
“I beg your pardon?” Watson’s confused question echoes my own failure to understand the correlation.
swept out in an attempt to overpower his. It was not something I had intended at all; it simply happened, part of the process and beyond my control. As it happened, Watson’s will was a match for my own. If it hadn’t been…
The seasons flew by, as seasons will, particularly with a young child. He changed every day. Yet seasons can be cruel. Death is a constant foe for a doctor, wily and often inevitable; a change that we all must face. The autumn of 1893 saw me laid low by an influenza I had been fighting in many of my patients. Out of an abundance of caution, Mary and I agreed that it would be best if she took Arthur and went to stay with friends until I was well again and the risk of contagion was past.

Mycroft does come, and fairly quickly, which I expected. I did not expect him to come with another. He ushers her to a chair before easing his bulk down onto the settee. He knows it will hold him, which is not at all guaranteed of the basket-chairs.
The knife sinks into Watson’s shoulder.
For all Watson’s extraordinary restraint when it comes to blood, and his rapid mastery of other aspects of his altered being, he has lagged in one area: mesmerism. He cannot influence other minds yet, not as I and other so-called vampires can.
She monitors the jars closely, consulting a pocketwatch-sized object frequently as she does so. A casual observer might think it was a pocketwatch, but I see enough of the face to discern multiple dials and tiny levers on the sides of the case. Whatever the device is, it is not simply for timekeeping. I watch closely as her gaze moves between the jars, the device, and Watson, but her expression gives nothing away until one of the squares in a jar turns a vivid, iridescent blue, like an exotic butterfly’s wing. At that, her eyebrows shoot up, and she sits back in her chair with a huff.
He will come.
Dame Patience turns to face him at once, her expression contrite. “It is I who should beg your pardon, Doctor. I should not have spoken in such an obscure manner, and I should have finished all the tests before stating any results.  If you will give me another five minutes, I will finish my analysis.”
Lestrade frowns at me. “I thought Doctor Watson was going to join us?”
I will not be reckless now, not if it might put Watson at risk. I direct the cabbie to stop a scant block or two from where I can sense Watson is. We are less than half a mile from where I left him with Lestrade’s constables. This is not a bad part of London, nor is it particularly well-off; it is a busy place where people live and work and go about their lives largely unaware of what happens in the riverside warehouses and tenements and other unhealthy corners of their city.  I pay the cabbie and walk towards a shop window.  Once there, I pause beside it long enough to pull out my cigarette case. At least that’s what it would look like to any observer. I use these actions to mask the moment I reach out with my mind.
My Watson is in agony.  Fury explodes through my mind, burning out nearly all else.
I nod, ever so slightly, and touch one finger to the side of my jaw. He returns my nod and pulls out his watch.
I lean back against the alley wall and keep my eyes focused on the dilapidated building that holds our quarry. I know I look intent, but in truth my eyes see very little. My focus turns elsewhere, inwards and outwards both, along the bond between myself and Watson.
“Excuse me, but what does ‘twiceborn’ mean, and what exactly does it explain?” Watson’s voice and demeanor are as polite as he nearly always is, but I can sense the confused tension underlying his manners.
“I am sorry to raise such tragic memories.” There is sympathy in her voice along with a tone that suggests she understands something about living through a horrible situation. “And it might not have been then. It could have been an accident or an episode when you were a child, or at any other time of your life. But the twiceborn who died of wounds are often unusually sensitive or even vulnerable at the site of the original fatal injuries.” She shrugs. “So if that was the cause of your first death, it might explain why you were so severely affected today. Moreover, it almost certainly explains why you are alive at all to be so affected.”
It is impossible. The changes to us both make such wounds trivial. I have been shot since my transformation, stabbed with knives and swords, and every time it’s been a minor sensation, nothing more than a sharp pang that passes in a moment. And yet…
(See the end of the chapter for
But not entirely. We grew wiser, our love grew stronger and richer, but we also grew older. Age crept up on us like thieves, stealing tiny fractions of our strength, our resilience, one day at a time. My leg and shoulder grew more painful. Holmes, too, had his own aches, and no longer found it such a trivial matter to go weeks with little rest. Winter nights spent in the rain and sleet, summer days spent sweltering in London’s stench, grew less appealing even for the most interesting cases. But we still loved the life we had, as we loved each other. The autumn of our lives was approaching, but we were happy to remain in late summer, still hale enough, still quick and clever and fast enough, to continue as we had been.
“Such as being infected with vampirism,” Watson says slowly.
His eyes are open, but there is no recognition in them, no sense, and he does not respond to my hand or my voice. His mind is unreachable, pain forming an impenetrable shield to any thought. He is pale and clammy. A large knife juts out from Watson’s shoulder, driven in halfway from the force of the blow. It would be a grave wound before his change, but he and I have both been ‘injured’ far more severely since the transformation that made us what we are, and we both recovered swiftly enough. If he were still human, I would say he is in shock. I don’t know if we can suffer shock now, although what I recall of the backlash of killing Moran could be construed as such.
“As certain as I can be without access to my lab and without far more elaborate tests, but really, the field test is nearly foolproof as long as it’s done correctly.” Unspoken, but clearly understood, was her confidence that she had indeed done the test correctly. “It’s not something I would commonly check for, but the reaction to the prior wound suggested it was worth ruling out as a possibility. I admit I did not expect to have it confirmed.”
Horror turns my blood to ice. When I bit Watson to save his life, shared my blood with his, my will
“As am I, and I believe I might have one further bit of advice to offer,” Dame Patience adds. “While your shoulder, or at least the site of your wounding, will always remain a point of some vulnerability to you, it does not have to remain an unprotected one.  There are ways of armoring such points, both physically and otherwise.”
A bludgeon left Holmes bedridden with blurred vision and terrible headaches for days and shook the both of us into uncharacteristically reckless actions.
“It’s possible, or perhaps they meant to use his body to implicate someone else in his death. A final swindle for a swindler.  It’d be like Loper to use one of his men so.”
“Twiceborn,” she says with a strange tone of wonder in her voice. “Well, that explains…it explains quite a lot, actually.”
It was in autumn, well before I ever met Mary, that Holmes and I became lovers of a sort. But Holmes’ interest in our physical relations was never strong, and our interactions infrequent. Outside of those relations he treated me much as he had ever done; certainly not as a lover, and sometimes not even as a fellow thinking creature with desires of his own.
There is some blood, but not volumes of it.  We do not bleed as copiously as we did before our change unless we will it so. The red stains Watson’s skin, making his raised scars stand out that much more in contrast. I freeze. I know those scars better than the alleys near Baker Street. They map the terrible damage done by the Jezail bullet that ended his Army career and indirectly brought him into my life. By sheerest chance the knife has pierced the exact spot where the bullet shattered Watson’s shoulder all those years ago.
It was not perfect. No relationship ever is. We loved each other, but that did not make us immune to hurting each other through miscommunication, accident, or even habit.  We learned from our mistakes and kept changing, largely for the better.
Was Watson’s love for me real, or simply a reflection of my own feelings brought to life by the very contagion that had preserved his existence?
A bullet left me bloodied and gave Holmes incontrovertible evidence of what my loss might do to him.
“Of his own volition, never,” Mycroft agrees at once. “But the virus knows no such restraint. It is a known fact that almost no first infection attempts made by a vampire are successful. The victims do not survive. Even vampires decades into their own infections succeed in infecting others considerably less than half the time, and often those survivors are little more than mindless puppets. Their original personalities are lost, replaced by mere reflections of their infector’s will. They
Slowly, step by step, gesture by gesture, with trial and error, I not only found my way back to myself, but to Holmes, and then we found our way to each other. It would be inaccurate to say that we renewed our affair, for the relationship between us was nothing like what it had been before. It couldn’t be, for I was a different man than I had been then. Holmes, too, had changed.  Some of our changes meant that we able to be better to each other, more for each other.  We had both learned valuable lessons of pain and endurance, kindness and giving. I had learned more about how to love, and be loved, from Mary and Arthur. Holmes had not had such direct lessons, but he has always been a ferociously quick study of any subject that interested him.
The most logical explanation is that the knife itself is to blame. It looks ordinary enough, but I know appearances can be deceptive. My heightened senses detect nothing amiss about it; no trace of a curse or the influence of any unusual – I refuse to call them unearthly or magical – creatures such as we have come to know and hunt. It is, as far as I can tell, plain steel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see. And what of your injury today? Was it your leg, where you were injured before your change?”
Watson is late.
We were not seeking change, but change came all the same.
I hadn’t wanted a slave. I’d wanted my friend. I wanted my friend, but even more, I wanted him as my beloved, my partner. My Watson. My John.
Watson’s mental voice is full of concern, but also a trace of ironic awareness that he should need to minister to me thusly, given my previous statements about being a rational thinking machine.
And then one winter brought Mary, and everything changed. Not all at once, but she was the catalyst that set many things in motion, as a ripple on the water becomes a wave. I began re-establishing my medical career in earnest. Mary and I both saved whatever we could with an eye to marrying and starting a household. And Holmes – Holmes helped every way that he could, proving himself the true friend I always knew he was, even if he did not always show it in surface aspects. In the year and half between Mary accepting my proposal, and finally having enough resources to purchase a practice with living space, marry, and start my wedded life, Holmes was never anything less than supportive, even though he openly admitted he would miss my companionship. I of course assured him that I would remain his friend, and his companion on cases when I could, but we both knew things would not be the same.
Lestrade reacts to my teasing much as I expect him to. In times past he would have bristled or found insult, but we’ve known each other long enough for him to hear both the humor and the offer of assistance if he truly needs it in my words. He waves me off with a rueful smile. “True enough, Mr Holmes. Give my best to Doctor Watson.”
We were very happy for a time. Yet Holmes’ loss changed me, grieved me, in ways that even the joy of Mary’s love and the arrival of our son could not touch. I had loved Holmes, and I had failed him, and I could not forget.
“So my being twiceborn, as you call it, helped me survive the initial infection,” Watson says aloud on the heels of his mental communication with me, drawing attention to him and giving me a few precious moments of privacy to regain my composure. “Does it also explain why I fail to mesmerize others?”
“Holmes would
Wry amusement enlivens her face, erasing some fine lines and deepening others. “The only order in which women are regularly invested as well as men, of course: The Order of the Pelican and Pearl. Which you will not have heard of, almost certainly, but there are many things not commonly known that exist nonetheless. Your own condition is one of those things, as you know. I am something of an expert on some of these unusual conditions, yours in particular, although I do not share the affliction.”
I slip past the guard at the door and race unnoticed up the stairs. There are many closed doors in the dingy hallway, but I know which one stands between me and Watson. If I strike it with my full strength, it will fly into pieces and be difficult to explain even with my mesmeric powers to help confuse the issue. I restrain myself and use a fraction of my strength to send it flying open with a crash.
He senses me, and I receive a faint set of impressions through our bond. Love is at the root of it, as it miraculously always is, but beyond that determination, and patience, and a strong sense of purpose, both his and mine. There is also concern, but lack of urgency for himself, his situation, whatever it might be.
Watson tilts his head, considering. “Not really. I was a fairly good storyteller before my change, and I could usually talk someone around. It’s something we were trained in during medical school, and again in the Army. I’m no better or worse at it now than I was then.”
The distance is not too great, and I hear his response almost instantly.
What had I done?
Much to my surprise, it’s Mycroft who answers. “Doctor Watson only survived being shot by Moriarty’s henchman because you infected him, Sherlock. But you shouldn’t have been able to do it.” He rests his large head on one massive hand, staring at me steadily in both speculation and reassurance. “You’re extraordinarily gifted for being such a young vampire, with excellent control. Some of that is undoubtedly due to your strength of will, and some of it is likely because Moran’s infection line is known to be a very strong one that produces powerful results. But there are no known cases of anyone as new to their state as you are successfully infecting another, not in all the years of records I have seen. It usually takes at least a decade before a vampire can do so, and it’s very rare that a first attempt succeeds. Yet somehow Doctor Watson was changed, and thereby saved,
Not knowing what kept Watson from my side is a growing torment, and now that Lestrade and his men are safe and the gang apprehended, there is nothing to keep me here.  “I suspect you are right, Lestrade. I expect I’ll find a telegram waiting for me at Baker Street giving me the details, if not Watson himself. Have your police surgeon look at Clemens, and if you want a second opinion, send word. I’m sure he’d be happy to oblige. I bid you a good evening.” I turn to go.
did not wind up enslaved to you. It has been quite the mystery.”
We are still nearly half a mile from home when I feel Watson stir.
I knew all this without asking, but his confirmation calms and reassures me all the same. I will go to him as soon as I’m certain Watson is truly all right.
And so autumn saw the advent, and later the christening, of Arthur Holmes Watson. Arthur for Mary’s father, Holmes for my friend, two beloved and much-missed men. Our lives changed completely once again with all the adjustments that come with a child.
Dame Patience’s gaze sharpens.  “I see. That might be something I can test, to help rule out a few things.”
He frowns, no less confused. “I think so, but - ”
Spring arrived, and with it the most unimaginable renewal and astounding change of all.  Holmes returned, resurrecting himself from his alleged death in order to bring the last of the major members of Moriarty’s organization to justice. He resumed life at Baker Street as if he had never left it. And from the very first, he campaigned to have me join him there.
CW: John has a brief panic attack at the start of the chapter. Skip down to "After an interlude of silent sunny looks,  Sherlock dropped his hand then John dropped his" to avoid it.
John's head was spinning. "Why!? It's the middle of the night."
Thanks so much to everyone for reading and commenting and kudo'ing and passing links along. It is life'sblood and I owe you all so much gratitude. Every heart and heartfelt deep dive gladly welcomed!!!
"Yes?"
Looking into the middle distance, Sherlock began again. "You have a history of traumatic dreams, John. And the training to harm others when they wake you should you be surprised." He looked over at John intercepting the beginnings of a massive glare that he'd expected. He headed this off. "I know for certain you would never harm your child, and you surely must have worked something out with Mary. But..I want to know if I may help if Watson wakes in the night. And I don't want to surprise you."
A knock at the door. How long? "Sherlock? I know you're in there."
John snorted. He said to Rosie, "You're my witness that he said that." She giggled.
Will do so. Keep safe.
"Oh, it's got a certain ring to it. An old world appeal."
"Your gun is in the safe we moved last weekend, correct? Or is it with Lestrade? I know you are in the process of getting a license.  But what I really want to know is, can I enter your room at night and tend to Watson, or will I be risking my life? Or endangering hers?"
John came back to himself and found he was sitting in his chair across from Sherlock in his. Rosie still drank from the bottle, peacefully in her chair. Sherlock had that serious look on his face he'd had earlier.
Precisely the issue.
"Hudders has Rosie. So she was in on this, huh?" John spoke hazily, preoccupied. "Did she tell you--" Sherlock took the last of the biscuit with his teeth gently from John's hand. Calloused fingers darted out, clasping John's wrist. John lost all sense of what his next word would have been as Sherlock's tongue licked sugar from John's thumb and forefinger. John forgot how to breath as the sensitive pad of his middle finger was briefly engulfed by Sherlock's glossy lips and massaged by his tongue.
John stood facing the direction of Sherlock’s room.
) and wrinkled faces (
Silence settled. Broken only by the occasional snap of coals in the fire and the continual mutter of the flame.
Mrs. Hudson shook her head.
"Not lying!"
Martha checked the cupboards to see if she had the fixings for Rosie's favorite home-made ginger apricot scones. Plenty of flour, butter and apricots, but no ginger. She brewed a quick cup of coffee and thought about which shop was likely to carry enough of the candied rhizome at a reasonable rate. She settled on making a visit to the nearby natural foods shop. Not her first choice. It was just a hair too self-improvement obsessed for her to truly feel comfortable, but they always carried both Sherlock's favorite body powder and John's go-to nappie rash cream for Rosie. Add in the mint, coriander, green apple cold-pressed juice she'd become addicted to, and the four birds killed with this one stone made it worth braving the invariable lecture on longevity diets and negativity purge retreats. She was happy with her current level of negativity, thank you very much.
His sleeping brain tried to calm his racing nerves and parentally charged limbic system, til he heard the haunting sound of a violin. The tension slipped from his body, and a smile curled his lips. The whisper sweet sound of those strings had eased him from nightmares more times than he could count and they were inextricably linked with a sense of peace and being cared for, to John. Then he recognized the song itself, and he scrambled out of bed.
Tonight John had shoved Sherlock's legs aside. Thrust a bowl of buttered popcorn in the man's lap, and pulled up one of his favorite Christmas films, despite the volley of complaints, gesticulation and restless foot tapping these actions provoked.
“It’s been a year.”
To give some space to John, she pulled the bottle out of the heating water and tested the temperature on her wrist. "So, did he have a case for you? You'd think it would come from the former client."
“We know who in the family plays music. We know whom I’ve seen read music.” Sherlock made three columns on the page, placing these categories at the top of two and adding a third 'Reads Music.' They took some time and added the names Watson had arrived at in the appropriate column, matching those who appeared twice and leaving gaps for those who did not re-occur. The third column remained blank
"Bath first, then kisses, I take it."
"Dear God," was all John could say.
John breathed out with some effort, "Yes. Please." He straightened in the detective's hold and asked a thready question. "Tonight?"
The great detective sat back, his bare feet on the bright, cheery, flower-print blanket. His assignment was to protect their basket of food from incursion by ant or curious pooch. However, he was quite aware that he had been strategically benched.
Sherlock could take no more. He took John's face in his hands and kissed him until John responded. It was a tender connection, the presence of Watson between them keeping them physically apart and their movements calm. Sherlock kissed and kissed, licking gently, then nibbling sweetly on John's lips and chin until John's breathing was easier and the look in his eyes lost the desolation that had invaded them.
"Sherlock, what's going on?"
Sherlock didn't smile, but his eyes looked amused. "The circuit seems to be quite short between your mouth and that little brain of yours."
Mycroft would have seen his brother's grief in a heartbeat. Sherlock was spared the burden seeing that knowledge reflected in his brother's eye would have been to him. Sufficient to let the assembled host believe he was angry to be inconvenienced by the loss of a helper and dab hand at tea. The real depth of the loss was his to bear privately. Alone would do quite well in this instance. To help protect against the disaster his choice to let go of his defenses had wrought in his heart. He would come to forget what John's presence had once meant. In time. He was certain.
“Yes. He corrected

Not my intention, John. Honeymoon is of course the polite term. And it will begin soon. As you said, there must be some limits. Unfortunate timing about the pregnancy. Mary will be cautious about alcohol intake I am sure. But better to know than to have regrets later. - SH

The song that Sherlock plays is called Win Ya Galub (Weep My Heart), a traditional Iraqi folk song which has been a major popular hit. For more performances of compositions and traditional music from Iraq, Iran, Istanbul and beyond, see these playlists:  (begins with Win Ya Galub)
"Night, Sherlock."
Sherlock roused himself and tossed up a lazy smile. "Oh, I was part of a quite in depth, multi-party discussion of the difference between romantic and sexual attraction. And platonic companionship. In addition to a plethora of orientation and gender identity spectrums, most of which I was quite conversant with already." He chuckled. "Truth be told, I believe this talk might have been begun for my--and your--benefit." He rolled his eyes. "A bit of a lecture. Or the usual 'figure it out already' talk we've gotten so many times."
The man scoffed then squeezed Sherlock's hand where it lay entangled with his fingers. "I've had plenty. But I'm fine."
Rosie was peering closely at the first reference sheet. Her small shoulders were tense. She mouthed words silently to herself. The man beside her watched patiently, his forehead starting to furrow in worried lines.
“No, but they play so..”
She continued on, addressing Sherlock. "Should we make blocks for the rest?" She picked one up, touching the whole pause symbol hanging upside down next to a tiny blue bat on the second topmost line of the staff. "I'm not sure I'd use them though." She hunted through the blocks searching for favorites. The plum colored C-note with a cardinal nesting near it; the deep green whole note with a sleepy viper curled up on a rock below.
"And the lesson is?"
The comment landed. John said, "Of course. As much as I've presumed to already know your answer, I've spent far too much time misleading you and others with mine."
The music began in earnest and settled into a soothing melody.
John's voice dropped and he continued glancing out the window as he spoke, as though he thought somehow, some way Sherlock could hear them. Or somehow deduce the content of their words from this distance and through the spider's weave of lace curtains. "I'm planning a bit of a surprise for Sherlock's birthday. And I wonder if you might be able to take Rosie then, as well."
and I apprec that. really do. you are the most aggravating friend a man could have, and you've endangred my life as many tmes as saved.  srry fingres getting crmped
Sherlock brought his face close to John's. "Very confident weren't we?" His hand moved, beginning long slow strokes.
In response to his daughter’s words, Sherlock’s mouth moved slightly in what his husband would have called an indulgent manner. But his eye took on a light that would have betrayed quite a different meaning to his closest confidant. That certain glimmer only the hunt lent this unique soul.
"Will you play with me?" Mr Shadid asks.
A small smile lit Sherlock’s face. His eyes closed and he breathed deep. She saw him eye the lounge, then shake his head as sorrow staked her claim once more. He turned and entered his own room.
Every sign pointed to him correctly understanding John's feelings now. It had been a month since he had the flash that stilled him, quivering with the effort to not throw himself into the other man's arms.
But the worst part was that John believed every word. He had full confidence that they would continue on as before. That nothing indeed had been changed by a few heartfelt words, some rings and names exchanged. But John of course was in the dark. He had no idea how Sherlock's heart was breaking. And this was just exactly as the detective wished. Any moment he'd observed inquisitiveness or doubt from John, he'd redoubled his efforts to convince him. Falling into the role of Best Man, of conveyor, of instigator for the wedded bliss as he could. The ultimate disguise. John was always taken in so easily by them. This time was no different. It was utterly different, of course. The end of times.
"What, we could have been making bank all this time?"
"Shhhh... love, it's fine." John stepped inside closing the door behind him. He came close to the bed. Sherlock could now see a faint glow in one of his hands. The baby monitor.
"May I?" Sherlock gestured to the violin case, still sitting by. John nodded but his brow wrinkled slightly as he tried to comfort his daughter.
“Make Nanna right.”
She waited for him to nod and then she continued. "Do this. You both deserve it. And do not worry about me letting the cat out of the bag. I've got my tricks where Sherlock is involved."
As if summoned, the detective threw open the front door. "John! The car--" He took in their positions and John's state and his ire became protective. "Mrs Hudson, what have you done to John?"
Sherlock reached out. He covered one of John's hands where they sat locked to his tea mug. "Do you trust me, John?"
He filled his mug with coffee and skimmed the paper for traces of some shrouded malfeasance or wrongdoing he could uncover. But his thoughts kept drifting. He watched the rain drip forlornly off leaves of a sprawling maple as his gaze was tugged back yet again to the direction of John's house. Tantalizingly close, the brief distance mocked him.
Sherlock chuckled, secretly relieved. "Now where was I?"
"So was I wrong?" She sighed, looking down.
"Alright?"
Will discuss more at safe haven. - SH
Harry didn't have anyone to teach you. You were so happy to help me that you learned, too." She picked up a block. "Did your mother sing to you, Dada?"
“You know it’s beyond what John can remedy.”
Mrs. Hudson gave a very practical ghostly huff.
“All right. I’ve heard Dada sing, so he's in the 'plays' column." Sherlock added him. Rosie went on, "I've never seen him read music. So he may read, but we can’t tell can we? He may sing by ear. Or he may read, like
Sherlock enfolded his beloved friend in his arms and sighed deeply. He turned, still holding John, and laid down the bow next to his violin. He chuckled.
He scoffs. "I'm just thinking of the child, John. And as for caring for her at night, it's simply logical. As you noted, my needs for sleep are minimal. I'm confident that I could provide some distraction and feeding. It would surely improve your efficiency during the day. Both for caring for her, and for assisting me in the Work."
Straightening up and wiping his eyes, he said, “I could swear I can hear you telling me I’m being a right git.”
"Rosie is with Mrs Hudson. Happy New Year, John."
“You’re going?”
Mr Shadid kneels down, until he is at eye level with the child. "It sounds to me like you fought to learn the violin. It found you at the church, but then you chose it. It speaks to you." Will nods. "Then don't let one afternoon's mistakes--and I mean my mistakes, Will, not yours--steal that love away from you. A teacher's responsibility is to help a student be able to learn. I'm sure we can do that together. And then you will have this," he gestures to Will's instrument, "forever. For as long as you like. It will be yours no matter what else is taken away."
With a slight narrowing of the eyes and minute raise of an eyebrow, Sherlock inquired if John was faring better now. A nod from John in response released the tension and the detective's fond, satisfied look returned.
“How?”
"But I haven't even been to the playground yet! And Papa and I have study plans.."
I think I stepped on your feet twenty times.
"Why?"
Rousing himself, John pulled on pajamas and his own soft, worn robe.  He as often as not wore one of Sherlock’s delightful silky ones. In an unguarded moment Sherlock had confessed that the swish of the too-long silk against John’s ankles was an incredible turn on. But John loved his old flannel robe, too. As much for its well-loved, cozy comfort as its tattered unkempt appearance. It riled his ever so posh detective into making passive aggressive suggestions about burning the robe and making John visit Harrod's with him. Tugging the belt tight, John reflected that he won out either way. Whether egging his detective into fashion frustration or eliciting sidelong glances at his ankles, the joy of teasing the brilliant, aggravating, soul-consuming, covertly kind man who now shared his life was never-ending.
Sherlock blushed in surprise, and pleasure. His thoughts spun but gained no traction. Feeling the need for some space, he eyed the bottle narrowly and glanced back at John, assessing. "Exactly how much have you had?"
Yup. She would never last under interrogation. She gave you up.
“You set?”
"Come Watson," Sherlock said quietly to the fussing child as they went down the stairs together. "I need your help tonight."
Martha took a hold of John's shoulder and shook him gently. "John Hamish Watson. I will not have it. You've made your plan and I tell you it's a good one. It's the right one. I have not stood by for these years watching you waste away for loss of him, then get him back and still throw your life away with both hands by marrying
"Will you be out all day, then?"
Not sure that concerns me any more. - SH
John had fielded enough questions out of the blue both from his detective and now his daughter--whose apprenticeship had seemed to start shortly after birth--that he took this query in stride.
The detective, unmoving, shed that cloak of disdain he'd donned. The inner aspect of disguise which had served him so long. Both for investigation and in keeping distance from others. Until the virtue of holding the world at arms length imploded, with the appearance of one soldier/doctor in his life. He saw his own shift reflected in John's eyes and reveled in the relief that acknowledging his own vulnerability brought with it. He felt buoyant. He also suddenly felt the feet like miles between himself and John.
. She knew some German, and they could make themselves understood to each other after a fashion. He seemed to be picking up Romanian quickly.
"Oh, nothing. It's," John flushed. "If you wanted to tell me about your sexual orientation, I'm sure you would."
John shook his head as he stripped the table of dishes and began putting their food together for the day.
Some time later found John clutching the leg of the couch with one hand and clenching a fistful of Sherlock's night black curls with the other. His litany of ecstasy and appreciation rose in volume as Sherlock brought him closer to release. Hating the necessity, Sherlock eased his tempo and shifted his hand to apply attentive pressure where his mouth had just been.
bloody can't if you're not here. what the hell Sherlock. you are my best man get back here.
Torn between relief and irritation at being disturbed mid-wallow, Sherlock barked, "What is it Lestrade?"
Still, it wouldn't hurt. And the man seems invested. Her son is so solitary in his ways. Encouraging a person of talent inclined to mentor him seems prudent. But good luck to this teacher in finding a way to convince Will to pick up the violin if he indeed was finished with it. If he is lacking the focus her older son seems so plenteously graced with, her younger son is endowed even more richly with a pugnacious temperament.
John reached out and plucked at Sherlock's lapel. He rested his hand on Sherlock's chest, pulling the fabric firmly. Wordlessly asking the man to look at him. He felt calm. He felt hopeful.
John's hand darted out to grasp one of Sherlock's and squeezed tight.  Sherlock looked up to see John nod and say, "Yes. Same. For me."
"Yes, John do keep up." That was the Sherlock John knew. "You're absolutely exhausted. You look terrible."
“Goodness. I will remember one of these days. Chief Inspector Lestrade. That I can recall. Let us test your inferences, Bee. Whom have you seen read music?”
Mrs. Hudson pulled her head back outside the doorway. She stood there, holding the handle. Oddly, no one tried it again for a very long time.
“First off, we discussed it already. How do we know if someone can read music? You have used two ways of determining. What are they?”
. And see this fascinating article about research on the relationship between ragas and emotions:
"No, thankfully. But curiously all parties scarpered, even the person he tried to help. Sherlock's friend was left with the items they had dropped. He was baffled and came to us for help in finding the rightful owner. Such a conscience. The items were a hat--which Sherlock was all over, he loves a challenge for his deductions even more these days--and of all things, a great big fresh goose. An expensive cruelty-free grown one, all wrapped up in white butcher paper, like the old days. I'm sure we'll find it was from some posh farm where the birds have a better pedigree than you or me, or maybe it's from some goose club that's part of a game bird hunting subscription service."
Lestrade stood slouched against the wall, a self-satisfied smile on his face and the glass necks of his homebrew peeking out from a bag on his arm. "No, not that kind of news." Sherlock huffed in frustration, making to close the door, but Greg wedged it open with his foot. "Trust me you'll want to hear this."
"Only you."
He didn’t respond to the pressure of her phantom touch. But when she moved away, she saw his hand twitch, and a frown creep back onto his face. A heaviness invaded his shoulders. She moved back and clasped his hand in hers again, and saw the signs of stress recede.
The instrument sat on the table, artless and worn in its untransfigured state of stillness. The earth dark wood of the sides transitioned to a stormy black on top and bottom. Sherlock's near-healed hand shook slightly as he reached to pick it up. It was a key to bring him one step closer to home. It also was home in a fundamental way.
"John, you can take a nap if you want. I've got her."
"Watson approved."
“Of course,” John said quietly but firmly. Rosie shifted, and he began running his hand down her back in slow, reassuring strokes.
He was drifting into a limbo state between consciousness and dreams when he heard the door open. John stood framed in the light from the street. His hair a halo, his face a blank dark space.
His gut churned with distress and guilt. Turning over onto his belly, he covered his head with a pillow, willing the image of John's luminous smile dissolving into confusion and regret to disappear.
John rolled his eyes. "Also no distracting me with insults."
“Let’s not debate this Watson. You said that Molly read music because she played the guitar. So by that logic, Uncle Geoffrey would as well.”
She stepped up behind him. Lay both of her ethereal hands on his shoulders. Like a benediction. Like a mother with a child held in the arms of sorrow.
“Little Bee, very good reflection. But within your question there are some assumptions you may benefit from letting us examine. Let’s think about this. Who else can read music?”
"John don't be tiresome. Time for that later. I'm drawing you a bath."
"Victor?"
Martha looked at him with a greedily delighted look on her face. "John, you can't be telling me that the great Sherlock Holmes is going on a wild goose chase?"
Sherlock looked up and caught John's eye. "You and me both."
"Hasn't he been getting private instruction then?"
John's eyes narrowed. "When you were dead, you mean. When I thought you were dead."
"Not speaking from experience at all, are we?" They shared wry smiles. John turned his hand in Sherlock's loose hold and entwined their fingers together, squeezing. "But you have a plan?" He received nod in response. "I'll follow your lead then."
Special thanks and gratitude to
It was New Year's Eve. John was returning from the shops bearing the toilet roll and milk he'd practically been shoved out into the snow to retrieve. Luckily he had found one place still open. Still time to go before midnight.
The pair recovered the kite and set up for another run. Sherlock noted with approval that they were taking his glancing advice to aim northeast and take advantage of the winds' velocity as it skimmed across the small nearby lake. They had plenty of room. The field was theirs alone. Sadly, the fact they were the only people trying for the blue today spoke pessimistically of their chances.
"John," he said quietly, "I've no objection to your pleasurable exclamations, but you may wish to monitor your volume. Mrs Hudson is sure to be awake until we retrieve Watson."
Rosie shifted in her sleep. Her eyes blinked. She looked over at Mrs. Hudson.
"I thought I was doing what you wanted me to do. To protect our friendship. I never once thought of asking for what I really wanted."
Despite the lost sleep, and his own grumpiness when it happened, John treasured the times he did share in that midnight circle with Rosie and Sherlock. He wasn't quite sure he was welcome, truly, but his heart drank deep those nights even if his body complained.
John gasped and half-collapsed on Sherlock's chest. "Ahh-- I guess, I was thinking of it more as hopeful." He gulped a breath and Sherlock changed his grip, "Positive thinking..."
"That's not what I said--"
Kite flying had been one of John's great joys as a child. Unfortunately, the pressures involved with getting the kite aloft brought out the bossiness in both Sherlock and young Watson. So each took their own part of the process. John and Rosie to get it into the sky, then each of the three taking turns holding the string and keeping each other company as moved. Sherlock took great pride in being ground crew to help Watson take the kite out of the air safely. He was constitutionally unable not to brag at least once about his clean record in avoidance of encountering what John called, 'kite eating trees.' It suited them all just fine.
Sherlock said, "One of them talked about being attracted to different qualities of people. For their body, their minds. And I realized what I'd been feeling for certain individuals."
He went on, "What they were triggering were things that can feel quite like love. Just as can cocaine."
It was cozy on the couch. When Sherlock wasn't hogging it. Telly nights were a moment John got to take up his duly allotted space.
Sherlock's eyes went wide in concern. Then, seeing John was unhurt, a glint of humor entered.
"Really, John, no time to muck about and bury the lede. Mrs Hudson, we've stumbled upon the whereabouts of the recently stolen Blue Carbuncle, a rare diamond of repute and ill omen. It belongs to the Countess of Morcar and for some godforsaken reason turned up in the giblets of an upmarket holiday fowl."
Sherlock smiled back at John. Then he reached out and put out his hand to Rosie as well, just touching a lock of her amber hair.  He ran the tip of his middle finger across her brow. As though feeling finest silk, or searching for a secret message.
“As I said, a dare, John.”
Sherlock reached out and drew his John to him. Their mutual sighs agreement enough.
He'd brought his conclusions to Lestrade just as Donovan bore up a massive amount of Sichuan delivery, meant to carry the unit through a second shift all of them had been politely bullied into. They tucked in as Sherlock gave his report. Sherlock ignored the food in favor of a cup of coffee. He had entirely too much fun upending Anderson's grossly stereotypical assumptions about the undergraduates being the source of the outbreak, revealing dramatically that it was the wealthy elite Sherlock found had literally glad-handed a city sector into peril.
"There is research that has shown that exposure to musical traditions can assist in the assimilation of knowledge. If you'll allow me to play to Watson, she can take in a tremendous amount of information before she's even conscious of it. The rhythms of music, melodies, the sensation of the notes even..."
soldiers were exchanging fire with two groups of Taliban combatants. Another figure was bent over the fourth. Watson focused his attention on them and started plotting a course he could follow to reach their location. He absently fingered his pack to confirm that it was undamaged. His mind flinched from memories of searching for needed fluids only to find them leaking uselessly to the desert floor.
"John?"
She looked him full in the face. "Just letting him know what I'll do, to you both, if you let anything happen to dear Rosie's caregivers. You're supposed to be taking safe cases and this diamond has a curse on it for goodness sake."
Signs are promising. We're cautiously optimistic that the goal is in sight.
He adjusted his sunglasses as he slid down in one of the low folding chairs they'd brought. He was settled in amongst the extra clothes, food hamper, and their stack of books: John's omnipresent novel, the monographs currently obsessing Sherlock, and the pile Watson had insisted they bring along despite all her active plans for the day. Bottom-most was a large volume with hand drawn mountains and runes gracing the cover. They were reading the Hobbit out loud as a family, though Rosie was reading ahead as well.
Sherlock nodded towards his partner. "If you do choose to, you should ask your Dada. He's the expert here."
FUCKINH ELL you do not get to talk about my honeymoon like we're bloody dogging on the beach.
Sherlock's grumbling subsided to rolled eyes by the time John McClane left the airplane. He shoved his cold toes beneath John's thigh. John glared at him but anchoring his feet seemed to calm Sherlock's fidgety energy, so he didn't object.
Waking by the time they returned to 221B, Watson was hungry for milk and attention. The child burbled and chattered happily to the two adoring men from her seat on John's lap by the fire.
Sherlock walked up the steps and dared to hope for a glimpse of home.
But here he was, a few weeks after their first case together had been solved. The word 'Moriarty' still buzzing low in Sherlock's brain. And the gravity of what he had actually invited into the quiet solitude he'd so carefully crafted was sinking in. Sherlock lay, unsleeping in his bed. He watched the darkness deepen in anticipation of the day's usual cycle into dawn.
. I’ve never seen him play.”
“And what about the class compared to practicing on your own?” Will’s whole body changes. The guards he had relaxed jump back into place. He looks at Mr Shadid with suspicion and pain.
“Love you too, little flower.”
“What did I ‘sume, Papa?”
"No indeed. But in the end neither did they." Sherlock shifted now, to lean back against John's chair and his leg equally. His hand came up to encircle John's knee from below. It all felt strangely natural.
"Why aren't we using musical notation?" A chitter of laughter runs through the room. A couple of the older students whisper to each other, looking in his direction. Will doggedly continues, "Or a metronome?"
"I would die for you, for any of them. But I realized that I wanted to live for you."
"I don't make my living from my lungs, John.  You're no help to me in the Work if you're hunched over in pain all the time. You're not able to perform surgery anymore, I wouldn't think you would want to ruin the rest of your medical career out of neglect."
"It's bloody expensive, we're not letting that go flat." John was going on about the champagne for some reason.
There was, apparently, no guidebook whatsoever provided on haunting. The last thing she wanted was for her presence to cause the unintentional gaslighting of the child.
John struggled to come back from the grip of the hormones flooding his system. "So you didn't ask Mrs Hudson to take her for the whole night then?"
"What? Oh!" John had begun undressing. He interrupted himself to place the monitor on the table by Sherlock's bed.
Now he just had to make it through this one more song and his duty would be done. It had been the first thing his heart had leapt to when he'd witnessed their engagement. He had written countless songs for John during their acquaintance. Songs about John that John had never heard, or had heard never knowing they were about and for him. But this would be that step beyond. Something for the new chapter of life John was now beginning.
. It seemed to calm the girl from the worst strop.
John relaxed in his chair by the fire.
John looked askance and picked up one of the biscuits. "What and leave you to be a wanker all on your own? Wouldn't dream of abandoning a mate like that. Mmm..." The first bite was heavenly. The complex pungent flavor at odds with the delicate graceful appearance of the treat. John nodded appreciatively. "The taste works better with the whiskey than I'd have guessed."
They were well on their way back to Baker Street by the time the call for evening prayer did ring out at the Mosque, but John had to admit that his daughter had been right. He carried their now-empty basket, and other bags.
"You rarely even say 'she,' of late. Always, Watson."
Nuzzling into his lover, John said, “That explains it, then. Between peers and parents and tempers high because of the stings, the last thing anybody needed was to be outed in the middle of that mess.”
"All right then."
She breathed words in his ear, his head still bent low. The corner of his mouth curled up, as if a happy memory diluted for a moment the sadness that poured through him.
"Yes." The anger in his eyes diminished. The love grew. "Your John," he said faintly.
above and below together. Derived from notation created by Guido of Arrezo, a Tuscan monk, circa 1025 CE. [
“Rosie?” John’s voice came up the stairs.
Sherlock bit his lip ruefully, quite distracting John. "I suppose you're correct."
"I am sorry. I was uncertain. No, rather I was certain at the time. I was simply wrong."
She shook her ghostly head and rolled her ethereal eyes. Then, without wasting any time on thought or worry, she stepped close to Sherlock’s bed and knocked his lamp off the nightstand. Turning round, she swept books off a nearby shelf. She set his framed set of specimens to swinging, but caught herself before they toppled off the wall and she kept them from tipping precipitously onto the bed.
Once it was gone, Sherlock bent to unbutton the sky blue shirt that had been revealed. It was one of Sherlock's favorites, the color matching John's eye color nicely. Then he realized what he was assuming and looked up at him. "Is this alright?" Those blue eyes were dark and intent. Irises large, face laden with heat.
Thank god for Sherlock.
She decided some kind of extreme action needed to be taken.
Sherlock took a breath and dived in. "Your sleep. Dreams. Watson. I want to know. To ask if."
The tension slips back into the small frame. He had forgotten it was over. "You should give it to someone in your class then."
John -
Mary came into sight. A circle of guests had formed and expectant eyes were on them. A final look between the partners. Sherlock gave him a wink. Then John was stepping out into the center of the circle, taking Mary's hands in his own, and Sherlock began to
“I love them, too. Always did, always will.”
“I am living proof that they were wrong.” A raised eyebrow, from Sherlock. John went on, “Because I do. Love you. I want to be with you.” Now a small smile. “And one year is not too long for a relationship to be healthy. For someone to treat you right. It’s not nearly enough. Not at all.” The smile expanded. Light eyes half-lidded fondly. John’s determination grew. “And I don’t care if it’s your brother, or your subconscious, or a parade of your exes from here to Northumberland, saying this shite, but they have got to come through me. And I’m just not having it.” Sherlock tried to hide a shy glow. “Someone has got to be the first person to be good to you longer than that, and it sure isn’t going to be anyone else if I have anything to say about it.”  Sherlock laughed aloud, and John peppered kisses across his face, intermingling praise with each, “You are mine. And beautiful. Brilliant. Caring. Incredibly sexy…”
"Oh?"
"Yes. She had baffled me. I'd never been tempted by a woman before but she drew me. After considering it in this light, it was quite clear that I was experiencing the challenge, well, sexually. But indirectly."
"He thought you sent him away," Greg said, then sipped his tea, grimacing at the bitterness. "No sugar?" He rose to add his own, leaving Sherlock to slump down on a chair, wondering if he was brave enough to face hope after all.
“But not Molly, and not Lestrade?”
John nodded into Sherlock's chest. Then he jostled to a position where he could see, as he realized the gravity of what was being shared. Sherlock stared towards the Christmas tree they'd not had the heart yet to take down. Lights twinkling reflected in the window's glass.
"Oh, my god. He thinks I've been ignoring him, all this time..." Sherlock leapt to his feet, crossing the living room lightning fast to pick up his phone where it sat abandoned next to a half-full beaker and black feathers haphazardly set on the coffee table. He pulled up the messaging app, but then his fingers lingered over the screen, unsure of what to say or how to communicate all he'd been thinking in this long, anxious, too-empty week. He walked back to the table and sat down across from Lestrade, defeated by his own uncertainty.
Far too early, he'd woken beside his baby girl in the emptied shell of the flat he'd shared with Mary. Each step he'd taken since then felt like he was walking through the bottom of a well. Between harsh dreams, his daughter's chaotic schedule upended by the loss of one caregiver and the child's own constantly evolving needs, he couldn't remember the last time he'd slept sound.
She was looking right at Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock's hand moved away, and he turned his shoulders to lay on his back again. Staring up at the ceiling. "What were you saying, John?"
"Of course, my dear," Martha said. Then she reached up and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "Finally."
What, no hello? Off on your solo adventures for months and that's all we get?
How do you learn to trust when trust has been repeatedly abused and then shattered? Understanding his reasons for his choices (and he did have them, and some of them were very good ones) was insufficient medicine. Understanding that he, too, had suffered, and suffered badly, aroused my sympathy but did not assuage my wounds.
I grip his shoulders, both to help support him and out of sheer relief.  “Watson. Can you walk?”
It was spring when I met Sherlock Holmes, and began, all unknowing, the most profound changes of my life. Life with Holmes has certainly changed me.  It has not been without its share of pain, though I would not now trade my life with him for a more conventional one.
. Watson’s swiftly-conveyed information included that he is bound to a chair, but ropes cannot hold him when he truly exerts his strength. Not that it is necessary in this case; I’m certain he’s already worked his ropes loose. I taught him how to do that long before either of us had ever heard the names Moriarty or Moran, much less knew of the blood-borne disease that has irrevocably changed us both.
"What does this add to your other investigation, Watson?"
Watson had acquired a taste for improvisational styles. It suited Sherlock to follow this predilection. He was fast finding that the solid, defined lines of logic he'd clung to for so long were inadequate to the changeable nature of life. Answering to the truth of each moment was a new strength which he sought.
"High praise." John nestled deeper in his arms.
Lasho pressed him to keep playing his violin for another song. The band played a crowd favorite danceable number which Sherlock followed along with fairly easily. He relinquished the instrument after that, but when the band finished their final set for the night, it was a unanimous decision to bring "Wilhelm" along to Tawni's house. They were planning to drink and play for many hours more. A vodka-pinked Sherlock in the wee hours found himself tempted to forget Moriarty. Forget London. Forget..
"Yes, though not him alone."
Is everyone I love safe?
Will hands it back. "You should give this to someone else."
"Thank you, Bee. I'd hope not," he said in the same tone of voice.
"I've waited so long to do this."
"That song."
Sherlock thanked the lead violinist, Lasho, later for joining in with the other violin. It had been nearly two years since Sherlock had played, and he was still rebounding from his extended captivity. He acquitted himself admirably, but the support mattered. It felt so freeing to be part of the music.
His thoughts were hijacked by visceral impressions of touching John. Silver gold threads cool against his fingertips, then feathered between his fingers as he'd pulled John's face close for yet another New Year's kiss. The warmth of John's arm around him, and the beat of that beloved heart beneath his palm. John's lips...  With an effort he dragged his attention back to what the doctor was saying.
The night breeze murmured through the leaves. The blurry rumble of the cove was broken by the occasional slap of a wave against the shore. John and Sherlock were the last to remain on the beach. Finally they stilled their laughter with eyes bright, full of one another, and thoughts full of joys yet to come.
"I can get it." John's eyes darted to the detective, to the candles and champagne, to the ruby dark whiskey and fire crackling beyond. The violin at hand. "I just need a moment." His breaths quickened. He stepped into the kitchen. Put the bag down and gazed blankly at the counter before him. He snapped back to awareness and put the milk into the fridge. Its twin stared out innocently.
They had never, ever, admitted their feelings for one another. After approximately one million hints, parables and blunt recommendations, John had still held true to that godawful engagement, married the woman who would try to kill Sherlock, again.
"Mrs Hudson, I wonder if I may speak with you."
"Just let me get one punch in, Sherlock."
Sherlock was playing his violin.
The whole world looked different from inside John's arms. It looked a lot like home.
Then his hand was free and he gasped for air, falling back against his seat, mind reeling.
“See? Genius,” said John. “Shall we make a list for Mycroft to tell him how wrong he was, starting with that item?”
"You mean she might want to be a man?"
Hm. There were some quite old dusty sheets that could be put on John's bed. That window faces the back lot. Perhaps it would do to switch the automatic light in the garden out for something a bit stronger. Maybe go back to that hair-trigger sensor they used to have.
"John, of course you did. And I was honored. I truthfully meant it when I didn't even understand that I was your best friend until that time. I had no idea what kind of claim you would tolerate."
Yes. - SH
Sherlock stroked John’s cheek, but he said, “You don’t know that.”
Martha's eyebrows raised in astonishment, "Urgent. For a goose?"
"What about, John?" He was answered by a shrug.
Mr Shadid frowns slightly but points to Will. "Yes?"
She resumed her thoughts, "What else do I know? I know that Dada is caring, and thoughtful. He tries to help people however he can, at the hospital, volunteering and also taking cases with you, Papa. I know he's brave and strong," she gave a secret smile to Sherlock, "and not afraid of trying something new."
John tucked Rosie up against himself. Unconsciously taking comfort in her warmth. "And?" he said, as Sherlock did not continue.
"I could just tell-" John's mouth was stoppered by two small hands. He smiled.
Getting through the latest winter had been a trial. Despite John's expert care and the tender attentions of all in 221B, the recovery from her fall on the icy sidewalk had dragged on and on. Everyone, especially Rosie, had spent much more time in the ground floor apartment than usual, to keep her company.
John remained silent. Shocked.
"What on earth possessed you to do that?"
"May we talk about something?"
“To slumberland?”
John was still chuckling as he put one arm around Sherlock. Beneath his hip, the blanket slid deeper into the sand. Splayed at an awkward angle across the plaid, his bare foot stuck into the cool layers. The familiar feel was colored by memories and the flavor of nightmare that haunted him still. But in this moment, no hint of the past tugged his awareness away. The solidity of the man beside him and a year on in this new life anchored him.
Christmas Eve had been perfect. So perfect Martha poked at the memory as she moved through her daily breathing and stretching exercises, just to be sure she hadn't dreamed it. Little Rosie looking like an angel in her gold and silver dress.  A crackling fire lit as the first snow of the season started to fall. The scents of chocolate and orange and cinnamon making everyone drool a bit. And much appreciation that the toothsome treats awaiting them were courtesy of kitchen 221A. Stealing John's chair for a comfortable seat by the hearth. Listening to Sherlock play 'O Holy Night,' always one of her favorite moments of the season. Rosie's laughter threading the hearts of the household together with joy. And most surprising, the delight of witnessing her adoptive tenants' burgeoning flirtation unfurl before her eyes.
"Why on earth should he have to compete? If he loves it, surely that's reason enough?"
Sherlock tensed, waiting. Not returning John's gaze. He nodded slightly though.
"Not. I mean we have to stop, and it's bloody torture knowing this has to end. Oh God, John!"
John stepped forward with a sad smile. He offered the girl to his companion. Sherlock automatically put out his hands and found himself with a warm armful of sleepy blonde-headed child.
"Well, I suppose I'm also very positive about that idea. Perhaps we can still take her up on it?" He did not relent.
They sat up together. Sherlock rolled up his sleeves. John touched the scars. His lover's fingers gentle, as Sherlock had been with his chest. The left arm was more liberally dotted. Each blemish another ground zero in Sherlock's struggles. John leaned over and pressed his lips to the tender skin. His kiss a promise.
He'd been home not long himself. New Scotland Yard was all too pleased to have their consultant shift to volunteer duty. After an oddly satisfying morning of helping repack a newly arrived shipment of face masks destined for uniformed constabulary around the city (enlivened of course by some judicious advice for making the distribution plan 28 per cent more efficient) Lestrade had called him away to help them work with the area first responders. They were trying to pinpoint where a sudden uptick of infections could be traced back to. Sherlock had spent the afternoon and evening making calls to universities, restaurants and finally, indulged in some off-book hacking into hotel reservation information that staff had been reluctant to part with, citing "privacy."
You underestimate me as always.
“Yes, but that may help us here. Let’s return to our earlier question, with this information at hand. Who can we add to your list of those whom we have seen read music?
A word was dredged from John. "No." He shook his head and turned to face his friend. He was still racing to catch up with himself, but he knew he'd regret losing this ground if he retreated. "No, Sherlock. It's perfect. It's beautiful." John took a step closer to him. Near enough now to touch, he reached out and ran a soft finger down the edge of Sherlock's arm. He whispered, "It's perfect. I'm sorry."
This. This was real. And he was losing his shite.
"It is not my fault. Your neckline is criminal."
Arabic Maquamat - an improvisational style of composition working from the basis of a series of scales or maqam. Further discussion can be found here:
Will's mother, Violet, knows that something disturbed her child about the class he attended. Though the account from Sigur seems innocent enough. Will of course put his foot in his mouth with the other students, but she suspects his skin was going to thicken fast given his propensity for such miscalculations. She really does wish he would just listen to her and her husband about being circumspect with feelings of contempt. Mycroft is so good at it, she couldn't understand why her youngest had to blurt out whatever he was thinking. Blending was a talent he does not have, apparently. Not yet anyway.
he knows about the kidnapping, their operations, who they have worked with, and the various crimes they are responsible for. There is no indication of a greater plot in their crimes, or any hint of Moriarty. That they succeeded as far as they did was due to luck and mischance. They never should have been able to touch Watson. I change the leader’s memory so that he only remembers a battle with his fellow criminals and send the man into unconsciousness with a single well-placed blow. I am finally free to rush to Watson’s side.
I let the unconscious man’s arm fall to the ground and gather my beloved more closely into my arms. I still cannot reach his mind, but I no longer sense such terrible pain in him. I stand, lifting him with ease, and bear him away from this place, back towards Baker Street.
Mary and I married in autumn, but that following spring saw no promise of new life. We both grieved, but as a doctor, I knew that many an early pregnancy failed to thrive, and that it was not her fault. Nor was it a sign that we could not have children, just that this one, who had scarcely even started to make its presence felt, was not to be. I made sure she knew this, and the private loss – for I told no one, and if she spoke of it to anyone, I never knew it – wrought its own painful alchemy and brought us even closer.
Watson smiles faintly. “I remember the woman from a medical lecture on the dangers of tight-lacing.” The smile vanishes. “Are you saying that all these people actually did die and somehow came back to life? Are you saying that
The shock of their loss sent me into a full relapse. For days my life was despaired of, but my neighbor Doctor Spenser, my old friend Doctor Anstruther, the specialist Mycroft sent, and the regiment of skilled nurses they brought in their wake, all combined forces and refused to let me die.
I can both see and sense the moment Mycroft’s words resonate with Watson. His whole demeanor brightens as he considers the possibilities. “I had not thought of that, but I can see the application, and you’re right that it presents far fewer ethical dilemmas. And while I am not gifted in disguise, I am considered a fairly good storyteller. Perhaps if I think of things in that light, I might make more progress. Thank you. Thank you both.”
“We’ve got them all,” Lestrade tells me with satisfied good cheer when I rejoin him. “And most of them will live to hang. I don’t understand why they kept Clemens’ dead body with them, though. From the looks of him, he’s been dead some days now.”
Yet a seed of doubt remains. I know myself entirely too well to think that it will lie dormant. It will take root and grow if I do not find a way to eliminate it. But how?
“No, but it is an interesting place to start,” Dame Patience says calmly.  “Please, Doctor Watson. Could you tell me about your change, what you perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, and then allow me to examine you? I assure you I am in my own way as sworn to medicine, and to do no harm, as you are yourself.”
I cannot stop the snarl that escapes me, but I am as careful and gentle as possible as I remove the knife. The wound it leaves is bright red and bleeding for only a few moments before it closes over, already starting to heal. That is a good sign.  It is normal for us as we are now. But Watson does not immediately wake from his stupor, and that is a bad sign indeed. It suggests that it was either not the knife, or the knife already delivered the poison or whatever it is that continues to hold power over him. I carefully pocket the knife for later examination, if needed.
Now we must move forward, for Baker Street will no longer be our home. We could undoubtedly buy it from Mrs Hudson’s heirs, but she was as much a part of our home as the walls, and the surest ally and buttress towards our safety as we could ever have wished for. She knew about us, and approved, and made sure our secrets remained ours. She treated us as beloved sons. I thought of her as a second mother, and Holmes, whose own mother had died young, treasured her all the more. She was an essential part of our home, a fundamental part, and neither Holmes nor I feel we can remain here without her.
"What? Sounds serious." He sat down on his chair again. Cozied his feet up to the glowing embers of the coals in the fireplace.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "If you didn't mind finding another partner when I died from boredom." He winced. "I'm sorry, John. I'll remember not to make those jokes some day."
Puzzled midnight blue eyes tipped up to meet somber sea green.
"Ah, ha. Of course. And I'm sure my co-workers at the clinic would never complain."
"It was just to celebrate the moment, John, no need for us to get soused out of pecuniary guilt." Sherlock was happy to keep drinking, they had no where to go. But John seemed to be in high spirits and spoiling for some kind of battle, so he was pleased to oblige him.
"Of course! That sounds lovely. Are you taking him out for dinner? She can be a handful at a restaurant. Perhaps we can have drinks together after so I can toast him as well? Or were you thinking about combining it with the celebration for Rosie's birthday. Though I know he likes to keep it small."
"John, I'd like to teach Watson to play the violin."
The morning it happened, she woke easily. A warm feeling spread through her chest. Her breathing had been more labored of late. Her creaks and aches made the prospect of waking less and less tempting in the face of the sweet embrace of sleep.
Watson seemed to enjoy Arabic maqamat
Sherlock mumbled something.
Don't land the helicopter in my landlady's goat yard. The neighbors may talk. - SH
The instrument retrieved, Sherlock left the bow aside. He plucked quietly at the strings. Rosie's eyes focused on him and her body calmed. John's forehead smoothed out.
The full melody played out, a second violin was retrieved and the learning sequence was begun again, this time with the exchange going the other direction. Other members of the band started repopulating the table where they sat. The background roar dulled and dimmed as the line to the bar receded and most of the bar's clientele retook their seats. Sherlock abruptly cut short a note when he realized that only a low murmur now divided them from the attention of the room.  His companion played on a bit, finishing a line he had mastered and asked Sherlock a question in Romanian. With his assenting nod, the Romani musician turned to speak with his fellow band members.
He reached the porch. Those eyes opened and Sherlock was anchored by John's gaze.
The hours dwindling, Sherlock wondered if he should let it go for the night. Then he heard a sound from above. Closing his flatmate's laptop, he left open the page on urban apiaries he'd been browsing.  Quietly walking up the stairs he paused at the entrance to the Watsons' room, the door ajar as was their custom. A slice of warmer darkness crossed the floor intersecting with John's bed. Rosie's voice shuddered out from the deeper shadow. Sherlock lingered a moment, his eyes adjusting. He saw the curve of John's shoulder. The angle of his chin. A suggestion of softness where lay the silver gold of the sleeping man's hair.
Violet doesn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. Will is doing fine with the piano, and she understands the demands of mastering an instrument. She had had some pretentions to the flute as a young girl, but mathematics had become her whole life soon enough.
) of those surrounding him he saw one universal truth. The weight of the economic miracle of Romania passing them by was lighter on each person's shoulders as they raptly watched the band play.
Hardly likely. - SH
"It was..I was with Victor when I started."
John kissed Sherlock lightly, then said, “Because I can see how much it hurt you.” Sherlock sighed. “And made you believe that no one would want to be with you.”
His focus sharpened. Mind, heart and senses aligned.
“Yes, dear.”
Sherlock shifted to lean on his side against the rail and look over at John beside him. The chill loss of his warmth sent a shiver through the doctor. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and said, “Yes, but not necessarily expected. I think not everyone’s orientations have as yet been disclosed.”
Sherlock spoke. "The first case we had together, John. It was exhilarating." They exchanged intimate smiles. "There have been too many since that left you broken and bruised."
Sherlock seemed to start breathing again. John felt the man's lanky length relax in every fiber. Sherlock's hips twisted, and then his whole body turned to face John. Feet slotted in place around John's knee. He felt cool fingers tentatively touch his hair. Pet lightly. A warmth he'd felt the evening before rekindled. John breathed deep and moved his hand back to Sherlock's hip.
She smiled to herself. Her sister's hints that she should feed some hungers not sated by bread and soup had grown less subtle as he recovered. He had looked like a whipped dog at first: ashen, unkempt, broken. But the blush of health revealed star bright eyes and lean, lanky strength, and her own thoughts had inched in that direction. Until she saw a look in those eyes she’d seen in her own mirror. When her beloved Grigore had taken his final turn. She could bind his wounds, but this was not a free heart that she could help heal.
A small miracle has transpired in the flat. Boxes were neatly piled. Several which had been full of John's books were unpacked, his reference volumes and pulpy paperbacks finding their way back to familiar resting places. Rosie's toy box took up a new position of honor, centrally located in the living room. Sleek filing cabinets with lockable drawers stood near the window, home now to masses of case files and research. And, true wonder of wonders, a child-proof screen had been secured to the hearth. Fireplace implements hung from newly set hooks so far out of child reach they were nearly beyond John's.
“What? What is it? Are you done with your morning lessons?” John wandered out of the kitchen. He had traded his comfy robe for a blue apron emblazoned in white with 'Kiss the Cook.' He leaned against the door frame looking over at them. He smiled at the small serious amber head close to the taller head crowned with inky black curls. “Breakfast is nearly ready.”
, I want to snap, but I will not appear anything but calm and focused on the case. I shrug. “I had thought so, but he is not present, and we cannot hold off the raid on his behalf.” True, very true, and yet gall and wormwood, bitter medicine. Believing me essentially cold and indifferent even to those few I call friends, always more focused on cases than people, has always been necessary armor, but even more so now.
“Sherlock told me that you experienced an unusual episode, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft says as soon as he is seated. “He is concerned for your health, as am I. I have taken the liberty of asking a colleague of mine to lend her expertise to the matter. Please forgive any presumption on my part; I only did so out of the best intentions.” He gestures to the middle-aged woman, who nods politely, her dark eyes sharp and bright. “Sherlock, Doctor Watson, please let me introduce you to Dame Patience Hansen, a researcher whose expertise may prove pertinent to your problem. Dame Patience, my brother Sherlock Holmes, and his friend Doctor John Watson.”
“I would be grateful for anything you could suggest that might help,” Watson says at once. “I have no desire to experience such a thing ever again.”
I smile, somewhat impressed. “Careful, Lestrade. That almost smacked of imagination.”
Dame Patience brightens, and she and Watson quickly fall into a consultation of sorts, full of suggestions and resources. I listen with only half an ear. My gaze fixes on Mycroft, and as always, he senses my attention. His placid gaze meets mine with just a trace of a question in their depths.
I tried that experiment once. I was happy, and I certainly can never regret my Mary. I loved her with all my heart. And in loving her, I not only realized I loved Holmes, but that he might have loved me too, despite the tepid nature of our affair even at its height.
She carried our child safely. I utterly failed to save Holmes.
Dame Patience turns to my friend, who looks rather uncomfortable at the attention. “I have not been…afflicted very long,” he says. “It seems likely it is my own inexperience, and my resulting deficiencies when it comes to being what we are, that caused the problem.”
“Thank you, I did notice you have a superb setup,” Dame Patience acknowledges before shaking her head. “But your burner would supply too much heat.”
