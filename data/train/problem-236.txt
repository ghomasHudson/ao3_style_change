There was one other conclusion he had drawn in his first year at Newberry. He was absolutely in love with his best friend, Sherlock Holmes.
“John, I’m sorry,” she said. “I just don’t think that there is a point in prolonging our relationship when neither of us are able to devote 100% to this.”
The barista smiled at the two boys when they walked in. They’d become night-regulars in the past two weeks. The coffee shop had the convenience of only being five minutes away from the school.
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, peeled back all those layers of that innocent blue-eyed boy who teachers always adored, the boy who obediently did his work and was polite to everyone, the boy who could’ve never imagined chasing after a violent psychopath at three in the morning.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’ve already tried that. Apparently I’m not old enough. I just look up articles on the cases and I call in anonymous tips. I’m never wrong.”
“I have been a professor at Newberry for ten years now, and I still have yet to come across a student who seems to have as much potential and enthusiasm for doctoring as you. I’ll put in a good word for you. I hope to see you as a student next year at Newberry Academy.”
“So, school ends next week.” Mr. Brooke started, opening the folder and laying out several sheets of paper. “These are your grades from this year.”
Sherlock smirked, a little half smirk that sent frissons down John’s spine. “You aren’t telling me that you actually mind this?”
His mother smiled. “You’ll get in Johnny. You’re just like your father, you know way too much about medical rubbish.”
John was nervous. He’d been at Angelo’s for ten minutes now, wringing his hands and checking his phone every 20 seconds.
John’s head snapped up and tried to glare at Sherlock, but his amusement was barely contained in those blue eyes. “Don’t you dare. Let’s go, you git.”
“Radial artery, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, ulnar artery, medial to which is the ulnar nerve, and flexor carpi ulnaris.”
Sherlock shook his head. “No, this narrows the field considerably. The killer was intelligent enough to realize his mistake in the first place, and then he had enough medical knowledge to know that bruising can still appear post-mortem. Think about it John, this is not the work of a common criminal.”
John watched as his class disbursed and headed off to their rooms, and then Irene left with Kate after pinching his arm and whispering good luck After gathering his nerve, he went over to Sherlock, who was still enraptured in conversation with Victor. Sherlock though quieted the instant he saw John coming over, and there was an awkward pause before Victor patted Sherlock’s arm and walked away too.
Mycroft didn’t reply for a moment. He finally said, “this won’t be the last time you hear from me John, I’ll be in touch,” and hung up abruptly.
John looked at Molly and sighed. “Sorry,” he said, “I can’t help it. It’s driving me crazy, the two of them.”
What really set John’s teeth on edge was the disgusting reaction from the people who thought of themselves as the greatest gift to ever grace the earth.
If only his brain were rational, instead it unhelpfully supplied John with hundreds of images of Sherlock looking ethereal playing the violin, of Sherlock laughing at something John said offhandedly, of him genuinely smiling when John called him amazing.
John remembers that one so clearly. It was late at night, like most of their cases (adventures), and somehow they’d ended up at the beach. It was a stunning night, and the Thames was quiet, waves rocking gently against the shores. They actually had figured out who the killer was, and after Sherlock made the call to Scotland Yard, they were content to just stay on the lakeside for a bit. They were so far away from the center of London that John could actually see the stars, and he had grabbed Sherlock’s arm excitedly, pointing up to the Big Dipper. There was so much. So much that could have, that didn’t, happen that night, and John remembers stolen glances and the shine of Sherlock’s eyes in the moonlight, brushes of fingertips and soft smiles.
John shook his hand. “Nice to meet you. Thank you so much for letting us go in. I know it’s not really allowed.”
Sherlock bit down on his lip as if trying to stop laughing. John could still see mirth lighting his eyes.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied quickly, but John could see the relief spread across his features. Sherlock shifted ever so slightly and looked at John, and then suddenly they were so close. John could see the individual lashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheek, and he could hear Sherlock’s shallow breathing. Sherlock’s pupils were blown wide, and John felt it, the magnetic pull of Sherlock that John could never resist.
Yelping from both the shock and pain of the stone digging into his chest, he stumbled and fell on his arse.
Lunch was an opportunity for him to unload his problems on his friends. While they weren’t as close to Sherlock as they were to John, they could offer some insight. Unfortunately, Sherlock decided that he would work on his experiment in the chem lab in the evening instead of during lunch like he usually did.
Sherlock, as expected, rolled his eyes. “There are more landmarks in France then just the Eiffel Tower and Louvre in Paris.
John did too. There were restrictions on what they could do on the weekdays, but on the weekends the possibilities were endless. It wasn’t just working on the latest case Sherlock found fascinating; their shared love for London led to ridiculous, amazing adventures across the city.
Irene turned to him, raising her eyebrows. “Well, maybe you two will resolve your issues in a more… enlightened way,” she said, winking at John. John laughed and shook his head, knowing that was about to be the last thing that could happen.
3. The time of death can be calculated by various means. One is rigor mortis, Latin for 'the stiffness of death'. Another indication is livor mortis or lividity. What does this term refer to?
It had become a cycle. Something would happen between Sherlock and John, John would think everything was changing, procked panic, and then nothing would happen.
Wait. That meant he’d be sharing a bed with Sherlock. That was somehow his greatest nightmare and dream in one. John nodded, and Mr. Verdue seemed relieved that he wasn’t about to have a fit, and after handing the two room keys to John, he walked away to another student.
The worst part wasn’t the relentless gossip about Sherlock, or the glances every time they walked through the hallways. He could stand that. If they wanted to stare, fine.
She wiggled her eyebrows, tapping a perfectly manicured nail to her chin. (really, John wondered, how did she have the time to do her nails when they were all stuck at the boarding school?) “Well,” she said slyly, “the two lovebirds getting back together in a hotel room? Not a bad visual.”
“No,” Sherlock insisted, almost desperate, and to John it was like a knife through his stomach. Did Sherlock hate him that much? “I can’t go on this trip unless I have a different roommate.”
Once, out of boredom and reluctant fascination with the boy, John tried making a list of all the topics he knew of and Sherlock’s level of expertise at it.
They stayed up until well-past curfew talking and it seemed that John was constantly stuck between being utterly gobsmacked with Sherlock’s brilliance, or breaking out in bouts of laughter at his dry humor.
“I think it is. Sherlock’s always been… unsociable. Now all he talks about is you,” Mycroft replied calmly. “I want to know why that is.”
Finally he got bored of ignoring Sherlock’s stare and re-reading the same page that was shown on his laptop.
He turned back to Sherlock, who was still curled into a ball and scrolling on the laptop. His face was illuminated by the soft glow from the screen. John had an inexplicable urge to smile.
“We’re worried about you,” Molly said, after a moment of hesitance. “Greg, Mike and I, even Irene, though she doesn’t want to admit it.”
Of course. If he had to walk into a stone arrow and then proceed to fall on his face, it would be in front of the violinist.
John knew it was an impossible task, staying away from Sherlock Holmes. Even if they didn’t share a room, Sherlock was a magnet, and John was hopelessly pulled to him. Falling in love with his mad roommate who has the emotional capacity of a two year old with the knowledge of two encyclopedias should’ve been insane. But it doesn’t feel strange. That’s the worst part. It felt so natural, and John was terrified that one day he’d just slip up and lean in to kiss Sherlock, effectively ruining the connection they had. Their friendship wasn’t perfect, far from it, and John knows clearly just what makes it so messed up, but he wouldn’t change it.
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, peeled back all those layers of that innocent blue-eyed boy who teachers always adored, the boy who obediently did his work and was polite to everyone, the boy who could’ve never imagined chasing after a violent psychopath at three in the morning.
“Right,” John said quietly. He was acting like a complete fool. No wonder Sherlock was avoiding him. God, what happened to them? What happened to the late night conversations in their dorm, the thrill of their cases? And their kiss. The barely-there kiss between them that still haunts John whenever Mary kisses him.
“Not, not that I’ve noticed what color your eyes are.” John cringed. He should really stop talking now.
Then something shifted on her face. “But I’ve heard he is notorious for being difficult. Not a people person at all.”
The rest of the holidays dragged on, and by the time New Years Eve came, John was longing to hear Sherlock’s voice again. It was just before midnight, and John knew Sherlock was still up, he always was, so John was about to call him to talk about anything at all when he got a text message.
birthday was in a week, and John was racking his brain trying to think of a gift. Reserving the school’s main lounge and throwing a small party with some friends was out of the question, as Sherlock would cringe if John mentioned some sort of birthday celebration.
He sat up and looked over, expecting to see Sherlock in bed as well. Instead he appeared to be standing and staring off into space. His lamp was still on.
Sherlock’s electric blue gaze locked with his, and in that moment John knew that Sherlock could read everything in his mind.
John knew that his grades had been sinking over the year, going from a perfect 5.0 GPA to a 3. He also knew that his mom didn’t want to pressure him and never bothered him about it, assuming that he was stressed in a competitive environment like Newberry. The more he thought about it, the more guilty he felt. Truth is, he’d just been so busy with Sherlock that he didn’t feel the motivation to work so hard in his classes anymore. John suspected that the only reason he still had a 3.0 was because he had a genius of a roommate.
Sherlock beckoned for John to come closer, and John squinted, trying to read the impossible handwriting. “What’s most interesting,” Sherlock continued, “is that at the time there were hundreds of letters sent to the police and newspapers with people claiming they were Jack the Ripper, but this ‘From Hell’ letter came with a macabre souvenir for the police that convinced them it wasn’t a hoax, half of a kidney.”
“Well, the branches of major peripheral nerves are usually muscular, cutaneous or mucosal, articular, vascular, and terminal. Muscular branches are the most important: section of even a small muscular branch results in complete paralysis of all muscle fibers supplied by that branch and may be seriously disabling. The importance of sensory loss varies, but such loss is most disabling in the hand, head, and face. Peripheral nerves vary in their course and distribution, but not as much as blood vessels do. Adjacent nerves may communicate with each other. Such communications sometimes account for residual sensation or movement after damage to a nerve above the level of a communication.”
Irene, who’d been standing next to him and witnessed the whole spectacle, including the idiot and Victor flirting in the corner, nudged John.
One of the things that made Newberry remarkable and different from most high schools was that everyone in the school had at least one form of artistic talent, some physical strength and high intellectual/academic abilities.
They spent the next couple hours talking about school and Mr. Verdue’s strangely shiny head, musing if he put oil on it every morning, and John was laughing so hard tears were rolling down his face. He was happier, and somehow the prospect of facing Sherlock later became less terrifying surrounded by his friends, knowing that there was something he could fall back on. Plus, the inevitability of the talk with Sherlock had somehow lifted a weight off John’s shoulder, as he accepted that he will do everything he could to win back Sherlock, praying that it’d be enough.
It takes much longer than John would have liked to get Sherlock in bed and under the covers. But once he’s there, he looks infinitely relieved.
"Please," John chokes out, his next words coming out in barely a whisper, "I just really need to have you here right now."
It’s not sexual. Just intimate. John takes stock of his own body and is pleasantly surprised to find that he’s not aroused, although his skin tingles with warmth and affection.
“You’ve met him. How many friends do you imagine he has? I’m the closest thing to a friend Sherlock is capable of having.”
John watches as the junkie wobbles forward a few more feet, following closely behind. He digs around in his pockets for his keys, keeping a careful eye on the man in front of him.
Icy eyes streaked with green and gold hold John’s gaze, looking desperate yet determined. The moment lasts for hours, it lasts for seconds.
He blindly searches for his phone with one hand, catching it and pulling it up to his face. The screen is too bright and he has to squint to see what it says:
John looks at Sherlock for a moment, at his tired face and shaking body. He feels protective, and tries not to examine why.
The footsteps grow louder, stopping at his side. John screws his eyes shut and wishes the person to go away.
Sherlock pulls away slightly to look at John. John loosens his grip but keeps his arms around him. They gaze at each other in the dimness.
John’s feet move automatically, carrying him towards his bedsit without thought, letting his mind run amok as it wishes.
John laughs again, dissolving into giggles as he slides into the seat across from Sherlock, entangling their legs under the table.
The bell above the door rings as John leaves, waving a hand goodbye to Mike as he walks in the opposite direction towards his dorm.
Is he eating? God, John hopes he’s eating. There isn’t much in the kitchen, but surely there’s more than what was on the streets.
“I knew you wouldn’t intentionally hurt me.” Sherlock stirs his soup, the noodles catching on his chopsticks. “I saw your caring nature and thought it’d be safer here for the time being.”
I allowed!” Sherlock explodes, finally turning and stopping an arm’s width away from John. “I am human! I make mistakes! As you
These are more of a grey, flat and muted. Blonde hair frames her face as she lights up in unexpected joy.
John pulls out his phone and sends a text to Sherlock. For some reason, he might not be able to hear John’s yells, and John will use every available avenue he has to
John’s gaze flickers to meet Sherlock’s before lowering to where he has Sherlock’s hand in his loose grasp, gently massaging the muscles.
"Just!" John says a bit too loudly for the quiet of the hall. "Because it's a bit too hard to do this sitting down," he finally breathes, his voice cracking.
He finds Sherlock with a pillow behind his back and head, creating a cradle for his body, and the duvet pulled up to his shoulders. His eyes open into slits as John approaches the bed.
There’s nowhere he wants to be other than here, with Sherlock, lazy mornings and late nights. Till the end of his days, he will always be Sherlock’s.
"What do you want Lucy?" John asked through clenched teeth. She'd said nasty things about Sherlock before, and John wasn't sure if he could handle it today. He took a deep breath before standing up and locking eyes with her.
John tipped his head up and kissed Sherlock soft and shakily. They kissed until John was steady and firm. When they finally parted, John looked Sherlock in the eyes and whispered,"Thank you." Sherlock just smiled.
Thinking about it, he assumed that maybe if he actually had a connection with anyone at this pathetic school it might be different. It was very hard for Sherlock to make any acquaintances let alone a single friend. After all, he's discovered people don't like feeling dumb, and as a 15 year old Junior Sherlock had made plenty of them feel stupid.
Eyebrows furrowed and nose scrunched, John asked "What do people usually say?" Sherlock had to hold in his laughter at the absurdity of the question. After all, John had just witnessed the usual. He turned his torso back to John and smiled.
"Linda listen to me!" He huffed. She jumped a little and put down the phone. She slowly turned around and looked at him with wide eyes. "I have no headache or dizziness or nausea, my memory is fine, my pupils aren't dilated, and my vision isn't blurry!" Sherlock stomped his foot and crossed his arms. "Did you even go to medical school Linda?"
"I love her and I love you. Thank you for tonight." John said softly as they walked out to his car. He opened Sherlock's door for him, and then got in on the driver's side. The drive to Sherlock’s house was quiet and comfortable. Both boys were very tired yet content.
"What are you doing in here? You can't be in here, faggot." A deep voice spat. Sherlock looked up as he grabbed a handful of paper towel and dried his hands. It was Anderson, one of the guys on the rugby team that like to pick on Sherlock. However, Anderson usually stuck to things like knocking away his books or slamming his locker shut. He'd never spoken to him, so it took Sherlock by surprise and he was stuck just staring at Anderson.
John smooths out his jersey and takes a deep breath. He heads back into the locker room and stands next to Coach. The rest of the boys form a circle as usual, but they're all glaring at John. Anderson has his arms crossed and a smirk on his lips. John wants to wipe it right off his face, but he chooses to just ignore him. John is supposed to give his big motivational speech right now, but he's worried nothing will be good enough. He takes a deep breath and decides to wing it.
"You just need to be observant." Sherlock shrugged and said no more. He'd explain but didn't want to scare John away. Sherlock sat back in his chair to get a better look of John's back muscles under his white t-shirt. John smirked and shook his head, because he was indeed being very observant; of Sherlock.
In the nurse's room staring at his black and blue face and all of the cuts, Sherlock reminded himself it was worth it. Being with John and being himself was worth it. Carefully he took the pills the nurse had given him and he swallowed them with a gulp of water.
"How the hell did you get up there without the ladder?" They spoke in unison, both chuckling a bit. Sherlock walked back down the steps and through the lights control room. His footsteps were the only sound as he walked out to the middle of the gym a few feet away from John.
He walked into the middle of the gym and looked around. Sherlock stayed silent, but studied John's movements. Eyes trialing over his toned body with ease. Sherlock was never able to admire John without feeling embarrassed or fearing John might catch him. From up here, Sherlock could commit every part of John to his permanent memory. John is so amazing and handsome, Sherlock just hoped John loved every part of himself as much as Sherlock did.
Meanwhile, in Sherlock's first class of the day everyone was talking, pointing, and staring at him. It made him feel extremely uncomfortable, and he couldn't think. There was to much going on. Although he was happy finally being with John and John having the courage to come out, he hated having so mamy eyes and voices directed at him. He took deep breaths trying to calm down his mind so he could think properly. He wished they'd all stop.
John felt his chest swell with pride. "Sherlock has a 4.9 gpa. He's bloody brilliant, of course he knows what it means. It means," John chuckled and smiled wide. Adrenaline flooded through his body. He was about to come out, and people were recording it. But he didn't care, he was tired of hiding. "He's mine...and I'm his."
"And there is no way in hell we're helping you chop off the only piece of manhood you have left." Their mother spat at Harriet. The two angry bigots turned and stormed off towards the doors. John looked at his boyfriend who had just stood up to his parents, and he smiled.
The way John's lips felt, so soft and plump. His hands feeling so big and strong, one tangled in Sherlock's hair delicately and the other on the small of his back. Feeling the beating of John's heart as it sped up and slowed down.
John smiled again. He wondered what Sherlock's family was like, and hoped they were better than his family. "Thank you."
“John.” Sherlock finally mumbles and slowly opens his eyes to the blinding light. John carefully lifts up his head and looks at Sherlock.
His parents grab their things angrily, but stop and turn back to John before they leave. "You can forget about us helping you at all with medical school." John's father poked John hard in the chest.
The bell rang and Sherlock and John reluctantly parted. John headed straight to class, and so did Sherlock. But Sherlock knew he was going to have to do the one thing he had been so scared of, use the bathroom. He pushed the door open quickly and rushed to the urinal. He had had to go for hours. The bathroom was empty while he relieved himself, but the door swung open as he was washing his hands.
." John whispered before kissing him again. John doesn't want to stop touching him or kissing him, but suddenly there's a knock on the door.
Lucy didn't like that. Her face twisted up in disgust. "B-but you're n-not gay! W-we dated." She was so confused. John rolled his eyes.
"Sherlock, I'd like that a lot. Thank you." John smiled. Harriet verbally awed and pulled Sherlock in for a tight hug.
Suddenly, everyone's phones began to go off, Sherlock's included. The room went quiet as everyone checked their phones. It was a video of John and Lucy Crawford. Sherlock pressed play and watched it carefully, deducing the situation. John looked happy, almost at ease, as he came out. It made Sherlock blush and his heart swell. His boyfriend was so amazing. His boyfriend was defending him and being himself and Sherlock was suddenly slipping even further for John Watson.
"Sherlock! Did you take my Democracy in Action book?" An annoyed voice sounded from the other side of the door. John's heart jumped and he tried to pull away. He had seen movies and he did not want to be chased by an angry father. Sherlock just wrapped his legs tighter around John's hips, because it wasn't his father. It was his older brother Mycroft who's always ruining things for him. Sherlock was not going to let him scare off John. "Sherlock! I need my book." There was another knock and then the door knob was turning. John looked at Sherlock with wide eyes.
When he turns the corner into the main seating area, John spots Sherlock is sitting in a red leather booth, smiling like he thinks he’s oh so clever.
There's still walking. Still distant crying. Still talking. But now the wind-like sound of the inside of a car and short breaths.
He makes sure to rub his affection into every millimeter of skin before moving up to Sherlock’s arm.
That night, John drowns himself in enough alcohol to forget every moment of his meaningless existence.
Sherlock starts again, softer. “I am human. I have emotions, I have feelings. I…I don’t know how to handle them and I need
In the end, he justifies to himself, it was just a nightmare. Nothing serious. Nothing he can’t leave Sherlock alone over.
Sherlock’s senses are a mess. He’ll demand a certain food and then not eat it because it “doesn’t taste how it should,” which often ends with him stealing John’s food. He had demanded John purchase a new shampoo because he didn’t like the smell of it, claiming it was “too bright.”
John stutters. “I-I don’t know, it’s a war zone! I would imagine they’d give me at least a handgun to protect myself. And I would if I need to.”
Sherlock's eyes are closed, his face raised like a flower toward the sun. John looks his fill, and can't help but notice the minute changes from a week ago.
John stays hovering over him, hands balanced on Sherlock’s shoulder blades, thinking it not appropriate to sit in this position.
The junkie had pulled up the edge of John’s duvet sometime in the middle of the night, too exhausted to move his body underneath the sheets. He’s laying on his side facing away from the door, curled into a loose ball.
John doesn't even try to make it to his classes that day. He spends the day in his bedsit lying on the couch because he can't stand the idea of lying in the bed he and Sherlock had shared the night before.
He wraps his arms around Sherlock for a moment and squeezes, giving him comfort in any way he can. Sherlock sighs, but John can’t tell if its from relief or frustration.
And every time, every single time, he has a childish hope that Sherlock has decided to come back. That he'll open the door and see Sherlock on the sofa, complaining about the lack of a telly, that John should've been back hours ago, and what were they having for dinner?
John reluctantly attends his morning classes, leaving the bedsit just barely able to resist giving Sherlock a goodbye kiss to his sleeping face. He’s unable to not think about Sherlock every second that he’s in class, and then at work, and back on campus for his make-up test.
They don't say anything as they stand there, using each other's weight to stay upright. It doesn't matter that strangers are still walking by. John wants comfort and he isn't going to allow outward appearances dictate whether or not he receives it now.
John’s lock screen is only visible for a brief moment before a second call, unknown, phones him again.
Pushing the door open fully, he finds Sherlock sitting on the floor leaning against the tub, his arms wrapped tightly around himself, holding closed the dressing gown. His wet hair drips onto his face and neck, dampening the neckline of the gown.
"You lost an entire future," Sherlock says while he brings John closer to himself. "But that doesn't mean that the future you do have is any less."
“Yes, I can,” Sherlock sighs, letting his head fall back onto the pillow. “That stain, there,” he gestures vaguely with his hand to a stain on the hem of John’s white polo. “It’s coffee, going by the strength of it, black. I know you received that stain at the end of your shift because the surrounding area is still damp from where you tried to clean it with water when you got off the clock—no other time to try and clean it, a lunch break too short and you’re too busy during your shift. Going by the freshness of the stain, I can deduce that you got it between two and two-and-a-half hours ago, which means you got off work during that time. It wouldn’t have taken you that long to get from your work to here, even including you using the longest setting available at the laundromat that’s on the way here. Hence, you’re late.”
Collapsing onto him, their chests move against each other with labored breaths. More kisses are readily accepted on both sides.
After an agonizing hour that was probably only minutes, Sherlock’s head flies up and towards John, his curls bouncing.
John steps back inside, closes the door, and slides down the door until he’s sitting. He lets the tears come.
He takes it slow. Sweet and sensual. Sherlock pants underneath him, accepting the tender touches and affection he’s receiving.
The phone is still pressed to his ear; the sounds of Sherlock talking to a cabbie are barely distinguishable.
“Er,” John starts. “Obviously not good, but not as bad as I feared. Your pupils are reacting more evenly now, and the lump on your head tells me that there’s no skull fracture. I wish you’d let me get you a CT scan but…You need fluids and rest,” he finishes.
The sky starts to lightly weep, rain pattering down onto the pavement and washing away the vomit. The stranger starts to shiver.
His phone pings, and John reads that he is to come in late that evening and do a make-up lab, which is supposed to be infinitely more difficult than a written test.
Sherlock seems to collapse in on himself, his shoulders hunching even further, his head hanging. He feels the sudden urge to just lay down and stay there. He drops to his knees instead, exhausted.
“...Cadavers…,” John hears Sherlock whisper, finishing his aborted sentence as John stands and runs some water from the faucet into a glass. On his way back, he snatches a box of tissues from the side table and hands them to Sherlock.
"What is it?" John bites back, distantly aware that his reaction is unprecedented and unfair, but doesn't stop to apologise or feel sorry.
Sherlock wordlessly puts down the sleeve of crackers and, achingly slowly, pushes himself up to standing. John instantly moves across the room to help him hobble across to the bathroom, but he finds that his help is being only used as a crutch and not as a necessity.
“Nnnnnngg.” The man seems to only be able to speak in monosyllables, now, apparently trusting John enough now to not intentionally harm him.
As John gets everything ready, Sherlock lowers the toilet lid and sits, leaning against the water tank. John is hyper-aware of Sherlock watching him, and tries to will down the flush threatening to rise up to his skin.
The shirt is too short on Sherlock, showing a tiny sliver of stomach—too concave, needs to eat more—and the sleeves too tight. It can’t be comfortable for him.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” The light turns green, and John barely registers the change. He moves forward automatically, his mind focused on the words Sherlock is saying.
Unknown number. The phone continues to vibrate in John’s hand while he considers answering, but it goes to voicemail before he can decide.
John had just sat down to eat his cereal when hears rustling coming from the bedroom. At first, he thinks Sherlock is waking up, but then he hears whimpers and grunts.
“Hm?” John jerks upright. He's supposed to be manning the register, but no one has come into the café even fleetingly for the past hour.
Before he can change his mind, John sits at the edge of the bed and wraps his arms around Sherlock, resting his forehead against the jut of Sherlock’s shoulder. Not squeezing, just offering the comfort of his touch.
“Oh?” Sherlock ordered udon soup but he’s picking around the vegetables, only eating something other than broth and noodles when John glares at him.
After a few moments, he stills. His knees are bent in weakness and his hands are holding bunches of John’s shirt, his breathing ragged and loud in the silent night.
“I’m testing your memory. It’s important when assessing a concussion.” John stops. “...Are you saying you didn’t know who the Prime Minister was even before last night?”
He bends back Sherlock’s index finger until he meets the slightest resistance, stretching the tendons, then releasing it. He repeats the process with the others, noting how the tremors haven’t eased.
John rubs the man’s back as he waits for him to finish vomiting. It’s mostly bile, pale yellow and acrid smelling. The man spits one final time and John asks, “We good?”
The stranger pouts and seethes, but allows John to clean the wound on his bottom lip. It’s full and too pretty of a mouth to fit for a man, but the softness of it makes up for the harshness of his other features—the sharp cheekbones, the gaunt face. John can’t help but think that if he lost the facial hair and were in top health, he would look lavishly posh.
The sheer depth of the man’s voice is startling. It sounds much lower than what John heard last night, no doubt pitched higher in fear then. John almost forgets to answer.
They blunder and bumble through the kitchen and down the hall, almost deciding to stop and go right there on the floor.
“No, it’s fine.” John waves a hand, putting the plastic bag of Sherlock’s clothes in one of the lockers. “I didn’t get much sleep last night.”
After a few moments of silence John thinks that he has fallen back asleep, but then he says, “Sherlock.”
There’s no telly, but John desperately wishes he had enough money for one so the awkward silence could be broken. The sound of John eating is obnoxiously loud in the quiet.
“I know, but if you’ve made these decisions,” John gestures to the mangled, vulnerable insides of Sherlock’s elbows hidden beneath his hoodie, “then I’m not taking any risks with assuming you know how to take care of yourself.”
Every time he had checked on Sherlock in the night, he had been awake and irritable, desperately wanting to sleep but unable. A pang went through John’s chest every time he saw those tired, red eyes.
A few days later, John finally agrees to meet up with Bill, the incessant comments on his blog becoming too regular to politely ignore.
John takes Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth, sucking lightly. Sherlock moans, his hands moving up John’s back and pulling him closer.
Meanwhile John was pacing back and forth in the boy's bathroom. He was too nervous to go into the hallway. What if Sherlock said yes and was wearing his jersey? Everyone would know he was bisexual. What if he was kicked off the rugby team? He took a deep breath and rubbed his temples to try and calm down and think rationally. It didn't help, for his mind went to an even worse place; what if Sherlock said no? What if, after everything, Sherlock decided he didn't like John and didn't want to be with him?
"Anderson." Sherlock whispered. John dropped his hands and took steps back. He clenched his hands into fists and began to pace. "John, stop." John stopped pacing and frowned up at Sherlock. Slowly he walked back over and tucked Sherlock's hair behind his ears. "I'm fine. It wasn't about me and you. Its about him and what he couldn't do."
And of course, the way John tasted. A nice minty taste that made the whole kiss seem so fresh. Sherlock wondered briefly if John minded the taste of green tea.
Sherlock threw his books into his locker at random. He usually kept everything scattered in a giant mess. Yet, he could find anything and everything he needed when he needed it; just like his brain. He stuffed his bag into the bottom of his locker and slammed the door shut. Eyes glanced around searching for that friendly smile and toned body.
"Sherlock!" John gasped and rushed over to the bed. He placed one hand on Sherlock's waist and used the other to run his fingers through his hair. Sherlock moved his arm and sat up to look John in the eye. John lightly traced over Sherlock's bruised face. "Who did this to you?" He asked with clenched teeth. Sherlock hesitated for a moment, but he knew Anderson might try to hurt John too.
Sherlock and John continued to sit together at lunch the rest of the week. They shared lingering touches and lots of suggestive eye contact, but hadn't kissed again. Even when they had a minute alone both boys were too nervous to initiate another kiss.
"My family knows." Sherlock gave a slight shrug, but kept his cheek firm against John's pounding chest. "Are you out?" He asked nervously. John tensed up, and Sherlock immediately backtracked. "Hey its ok," pulling his head up to look at John, "You can come out whenever you're ready."
"I would let you stay with me for the night, but I didn't give Charles a heads up." Harriet looked at her brother sadly. She felt sincerely bad. "Just know that I love you, and that mom and dad will come around slowly. I mean they were considering paying for my surgery, and just a year ago they kicked me out. It's progress, slowly but surely." She smiled softly and hugged and kissed her brother.
"Hmmm..." Sherlock smirked and leaned back in his seat with his arms crossed. Harriet taps her long purple nails on the table in anticipation. "The lady by the door, with the white hair is disheveled because she is waiting for a ride that is very late. She's a democrat. She lives with 3 cats and 1 dog. She has no kids. She's recently divorced." Sherlock raddles off multiple little details about the woman's life, while John and Harriet watch in awe. Sherlock feels so loved in this moment. He finally stops with a sharp breath and turns back to look at both John and Harriet.
"A-Alright then." Linda glanced down at her clipboard and back up at Sherlock before leaving the room. Sherlock sighed and laid back down on the bed. He put his arm over his eyes and took deep breaths. This is not how things were supposed to go. Sherlock's ears were still ringing, so he didn't hear the rapid footsteps.
"John." She said loudly. All eyes turned to her and the room went quiet again. John raised one eyebrow and glanced at her sideways. She had her arms crossed and face screwed up in anger. She had absolutely no right to be angry. She was John's ex-girlfriend and she cheated on him.
Carefully, Sherlock tucked the note back into its envelope and into his backpack along with his shirt. He never wanted to lose that note. He felt his cheeks grow hotter with every step towards the door. Everyone would know the second they looked at him, that John wanted him and he wanted John. He was worried what people would think, yet too happy to care. So with his head high he headed to his first class of the day.
Both boys had sweating palms and adrenaline coursing through them. John had gone the ninety percent to Sherlock and poured his heart out, now it was his turn. Sherlock shuffled forward and now their chests were firm against each other. They looked at each other for a moment, and then Sherlock spoke. "John Watson, you have no idea how long I have wanted you to say those words." Sherlock breathed happily before leaning in to kiss John.
"Of course not." John furrowed his eyebrows, "I feel so relieved. It's going to be kinda rough for a little while, but its nothing I'd undo." John pecked Sherlock's cheek and ran his fingers through his hair. Sherlock nodded with a little smile and sigh of relief. John felt something deep in the pit of his stomach. "I want you to be with me tonight when...I come out to my parents." Sherlock felt the same feeling in the pit of his stomach. He sat up and looked at John.
After a few minutes, John kissed Sherlock's forehead and then picked up his duffel bag. "Are you ready to go?" Sherlock smiled and nodded. John carried his bag in one hand, and held Sherlock's delicately in his other hand as they walked to the car.
Anderson took big angry strides towards him and smashed his back into the wall. Sherlock didn't know what to do. He'd never been hit like this before. Small stuff he could handle, but getting the wind knocked out of him scared him. Sherlock had seen the way Anderson looks at John. He'd seen the way he tenses when his girlfriend Macy touches him. He quickly glanced up and down Anderson. Here he was with eyes flickering to Sherlock's lips. Sherlock spat in his face.
The way John smelt, his aftershave something nice and outdoorsy. Sherlock nevemr really enjoyed the outdoors, but it suited John. The smell of his leather varsity jacket.
"Sherlock, I don't care what anyone says about you or to you. I'd like to think that in these past few weeks I've learned the real you. No one else here knows you like I do." John took a deep breath and another step forward. They were only a tiny step away now. Chests almost touching. "The real you is so absolutely beautiful and brilliant. I-I completely and utterly love the real you with my entire being, Sherlock."
I know it seems like I fell into a black hole, but I'm getting my shit together. Lol lots of updates to come soon!
He was becoming hyperaware of all the looks and sounds. Feet moving faster he quickly burst through the gym door. Panting from nerves Sherlock closed his eyes and counted back from 10 until his breathing was steady. He climbed up to his spot and finally looked at the jersey. Bold white numbers across the back read 24. Sherlock knew nothing about rugby, but he knew that was John's number. He also knew that John had never given his jersey to anyone.
"I know the code to the control room and there's a set of stairs that lead up there." He shrugged as his face flushed again. He gave a soft shrug and looked away. John smiled at him never taking his eyes away from Sherlock.
When John walked into the classroom it went almost silent. It was like his bubble of confidence and determination burst. He ducked his head and sat in his desk. Most people began to whisper, but some just stared. Someone came rushing over and John knew who it was without even looking; Lucy Crawford. He could tell by the annoying click of her heels on the floor.
They paid for their dinner and began to get their things together. "I-I really don't want to go home." John mumbled and ran his fingers through his hair. Harriet frowned and hugged her brother.
John's phone begins to sound loudly and Sherlock is pulled back to reality. Its a call from his mother. John gets up and paces while it rings. He naws on his lip and wonders what she's heard. He wanted her to hear it from him...but was he too late? He took a deep breath and answered the phone. "Hello?" Sherlock is sitting up now and he's anxiously analyzing John's every move.
. Now if you'll excuse me I'm getting ready for bed." Sherlock said this all with a tone John had never heard before. He was being a bratty little brother and John thought it was adorable.
With new determination, both boys headed into the diner. Sherlock followed John's lead. This was John's family and he wanted to respect that; he was not at all nervous.
Sherlock pulled his coat tighter around his bony body and searched for somewhere in the bleachers to sit. He picks an empty spot at the top in the far right. He sits far away from everyone else and waits eagerly.
He dried off his hands and face and walked   of the bathroom with his head held high and his shoulders back; confident and determined. But there was still anxiety bubbling in his stomach as he headed to his first class. His bright white 24 shining on his back. And he wondered if Sherlock was wearing the same number.
“If that’s really what you want…I’ll leave him alone.” Sherlock smiled up at him. “But…if I’m ever around and anyone touches you or says anything…I can’t promise I’ll leave them alone.” John said sincerely. Sherlock thought for a minute before he stuck out his hand.
"W-well, they're parts of me too." Sherlock swallowed. John laughed low and huskily into his ear. Then he brushed his lips against Sherlock’s cheek and neck so very lightly it made Sherlock shiver once again. He let out a content sigh and slid his hands up John's hips and stopped at his waist. They rested their foreheads together and just stood together for a few minutes. They'd been through so much in the last 24 hours, and they just needed to be close. Their bodies were tired, but the way they touched each other seemed to shock them awake.
"Why do you let her do that to you?" He asked. Sherlock brought his hands up to massage his scalp and fix his hair. Eyes peaked up from underneath his dark lashes. Then he recognized the boy sitting next to him. John Watson, the captain of the Rugby team. He was completely gorgeous from head to toe, inside and out, and Sherlock definitely knew it. However, he never imagined John would talk to a freak like himself.
His father stood up suddenly and pounded his fists on the table. "You're not gay!" He yelled and reached over the table. He cocked his arm back and slapped John hard across his face. Sherlock gasped and pulled John back away from his father. The sound seemed to stop everyone. The entire restraunt was watching them now. "I didn't raise two faggots!" John looked as if he had been slapped again. He was biting his lips and staring blankly at his father. Sherlock clenched his teeth and his fists.
"You're truly amazing, Sherlock Holmes." He took a step closer to Sherlock and placed his hand gently onto his shoulder. With a comforting tone he spoke, "Are you alright?" Sherlock was never alright when he was around John.
He furrowed his eyebrows and stood up. What had Lucy said? Sherlock leaned against the railing and it squeaked loudly. John's head snapped up and he locked eyes with Sherlock from across the gym. Sherlock blushed and tilted his head down, letting his mess of curls fall in his eyes.
Sherlock blushed and looked at his hands. Yet there was a wide smile on his lips. "N-No...I really," he took a deep breath before looking up at John, "really liked it." His cheeks grew hotter, but a all embarrassment was gone when John stepped closer again. Their chests touched again and John's hands enclosed around Sherlock's.
One leg was loosely tangled inbetween John's. The other had been bent, because with his foot planted firmly on something solid, Sherlock was able to feel more grounded. His head and stomach still swam, but this way he could stop the world around him from spinning too.
With his fingers on his temples Sherlock went through the lessons he had been taught so far today. He had found it was the best way to keep everything together and not lose any part of the lesson. Suddenly warm clammy hands wrapped around his wrists and yanked his fingers from his temples harshly. Sherlock grimaced and looked up. It was Sally Donovan, a senior, who constantly felt the need to hurl insults at Sherlock.
John took Sherlock's hand and intertwined their shaking fingers. Harriet smiled even wider. His parents, however, furrowed their eyebrows in confusion. Then, as John and Sherlock approached the table, their faces turned to a mix of anger and disgust.
"And you're right about one more thing. You didn't raise two faggots. You raised two beautiful and unique children. John is the kindest person I've ever met, and I've heard so many great things about Harriet. They're both such strong kids, especially if they've had to deal with you!" Sherlock huffed and crossed his arms defiantly.
"Oh c'mon, Donovan. Just because you're failing pre-calc doesn't mean you get to take it out on Sherlock." A manly voice from behind Sherlock spoke up. Sally scoffed and let go of his hair.
"Mom! Dad!" John shouted at his parents as they reached the doors. They both stopped and turned back with smirks; thinking they'd won. John flipped off his parents before grabbing Sherlock and kissing him passionately. Harriet laughed and began to clap, and then other people in the diner began to clap. The boys continued to kiss until they heard the diner doors slam shut. "I love you, Sherlock Holmes." John whispered once they'd pulled away.
He puts his hand out, and so does Coach, and slowly the rest of the team. John finally begins to feel like everything is falling into place.
But all thoughts were quickly abandoned when the rough pads of Johns fingers slid under the edge of his shirt, brushing against his hip bones. Sherlock shivered and pulled away with his lips parted and breath coming out in soft pants. John immediately took hus hands of and took a step back. "I-I'm sorry  Sherlock." John sighed and stepped back again.
"You two are literally so cute." Harriet giggled and leaned her elbows on the table. Both boy blushed and looked down. "But what do you mean that he can analyze people?" Harriet wiggles her eybrows and leans her elbows on the table. She looked very intrigued. Both boys laugh and look around the diner.
"Holy fucking shit. You were not kidding." She laughed again. Both boys let out deep breaths. "I thought maybe John had told you all of that stuff, but John has no Idea how long I've been on E. I'm blown away." She blinked softly and looked between both boys before giggling to herself again. Then,  they were all laughing,  and it make no sense why. They were laughing so hard it hurt their stomachs. All of the hysterical laughing must have come from how tired they all were, and how crazy their day had been.
Everyone stared at him once they'd finished the video. It was like they were expecting something. Sherlock felt like he needed to say something, but for a minute he just sat there. He stared back at everyone with a clenched jaw as he tried to figure out what to say. Sally Donovan shot out of her desk and placed her hands on her hips. She opened her mouth to speak and the words just flew right out of Sherlock's mouth.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock mumbled and brushed his fingers through John's hair softly. He dropped his legs from around John's hips and kissed the top of his head. John pulled away and cradled Sherlock's face gently.
"Come to my game this Friday night?" John asked and rubbed his thumb against Sherlock's wrist and the backs of his hand. Sherlock made up his mind fairly easily, yet he furrowed his eyebrows and pretended to mull it over. "I'd just be nice to know you're watching." John looked calm and collected, but his heart was racing.
"You just need to be observant." John smirked and pecked Sherlock's cheek quickly. It was quiet for a while as they ate, but it was comfortable. The diner was slowly clearing out as they prepared to close up for the night. The waiter took their plates and Harriet finally spoke again.
John leaned in close so his cheek was pressed against Sherlock's. "I guess I should probably sleep with you then...so you have the chance to explain to them before they know I'm here." John whispered softly into Sherlock's ear, then pulled back and winked at him. Sherlock flushed, yet nodded slightly. John chuckled again. "Don't worry, I can sleep on your floor."
"You're right! He's not gay! He's bisexual! He loves people for who they are as people and not what's in their pants!" Sherlock yelled and stomped his foot. He was not about to just stand there and let John's father bully his children. John's parents stood silently; unsure of what to say. They'd clearly never been stood up to before.
“I just…I-I want you to promise you won’t…hurt Anderson.” John pulls away with his brow furrowed. Sherlock feels nervous and instantly regrets saying anything. “I just…I don’t want to stoop that low…He’s not worth it.” Sherlock looks away feeling ashamed. John reaches over and tilts his face back. He kisses him again with a little more passion, but still gentle.
"I-I'm not...fine whatever. What do you know anyway." Donovan stomped away with the rest of her little clique. Sherlock looked down at his fingers. There was a high pitched squeal as the red seat next to him was pulled out. Suddenly, the boy was sitting right next to him.
Everyone stood still waiting to see what would happen. Nobody moved except one tiny waiter. Sherlock noticed his name tag said Matt. Matt walked over and turned to John's parents. "I think it's best if you two leave." They opened their mouths to protest, are quickly cut off by Matt. "Now." He pointed to the door.
Sherlock's room is quite messy, just like his brain and his locker. However, his room is not piled high with dirty clothes or cluttered with trash and dirty dishes. Sherlock's room is piled high with stacks of textbooks on various topics: Cognitive Psychology, Social and Behavioral Research, Astrobiology, Mortuary Science, Sexuality Studies, etc. There are multiple violins and bows, as well as sheet music. John loved the environment and the feeling that washed over him as he stepped into Sherlock’s bedroom.
"He loves you," Sherlock whispered softly, "and he hates himself for it." John's heart sank at the realization, and Sherlock immediately wished he hadn't said anything. He stepped up to John and caressed his cheek; gently brushing his thumb along his cheekbone and top lip. John took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. The whole day had been such a mess. It felt as if they only truly had each other.
"Thankfully, there's no serious injury. However, we need to call your parents so they know to watch for signs of a concussion." Nurse Linda rubbed Sherlock's shoulder affectionately. With a weak smile she picked up the phone on her desk. Sherlock rolled his eyes and slid off the bed to stand on the ground.
"Mom! Dad!" John's voice came out low and deep, and almost as a growl. All eyes snapped to John. Despite John's height, the way he was standing and talking made him look extremely intimidating. "Sherlock is my boyfriend, because I love him and he loves me. Nothing more." John glared sharply at his parents.
Sherlock smiled softly and moved his food around with his fork. "Yeah it is nice I'll only have to deal with 2 years of it..." He mumbled and looked up to John. "But once you graduate...I'll have no one." Sherlock sighed and sat back in his chair. Harriet looked at Sherlock with kind, loving eyes. "Honestly, John is the only one who's bothered to even talk to me. My neighbor Molly is a good friend, but she's in college. So we don't get to spend much time together." Sherlock shrugged. Harriet frownes slightly and looked at John who was frowning too.
It was over almost as quickly as it had begun. Anderson had hit him again and again. Blood was rushing to the surface while Sherlock heard nothing but ringing. He knew what had happened, but he felt like he hadn't been there. He can picture the mirror shattering, but couldn't hear it or feel it. He can feel it all, but in his head it didn't seem real. It seemed like it happened to someone else.
"Mycroft." Sherlock snapped angrily. The door knob was let go. John instantly felt at ease. He let out a breath and leaned back into Sherlock. Sherlock smiled, but he was still annoyed with his brother. "Its in the kitchen. Surely a
"Do not apologize. You did nothing wrong, babe." They kissed again, but this time it was the type of kiss they'd never forget; sweet and passionate. With wet, red lips, they pulled away and just held each other. A tiny yawn came from Sherlock, even though he tried to hide it. "Lets lay down, yeah?" John asked softly. Sherlock looked up at him with tired and droopy eyes full of love, and he nodded silently. John stepped back and began undressing. Sherlock slid off of his desk and smiled at John's muscular body.
Perfectly white teeth nibbled on beautiful pink lips. "You mind if I eat lunch here tomorrow?" John asked. Sherlock felt his heart flutter and couldn't help but grin.
." Sherlock blushed as he looked John up and down. John chuckled lightly and kicked off his shoes. When both boys were in their boxers, Sherlock pulled back his comforter and John turned off the lights. They climbed into Sherlock's bed and turned to face each other.
After John came out to his parents in the diner, the last thing he wanted to do was go home. With Sherlock and Harriet by his side he could stand up to his parents, but without them…he wasn’t sure he could handle it. So, he stalled for as long as he could in the diner.
John opened the passenger door and Sherlock blushed as he slipped into the seat. As John walked around his car to the driver's side, Sherlock reached over and unlocked John's door. With a smile on his lips, John started his car and began to drive to the little diner his family loved. He drove with just his left hand on the wheel. His right hand dangled on console. His heart was beginning to pound the closer he got to the diner. He reached over and laced his fingers with Sherlock. "John." Sherlock spoke up.
"You!" John's mother pointed accusingly at Harriet. Her finger trembled with anger. "Did you put him up to this so we'd pay for that ridiculous surgery?" His mother was drawing attention and lots of people had stopped to watch. Harriet's face fell at the harsh accusation and the painful reminder that she "wasn't a real woman". John looked at his sister who had tears in her eyes. He looked at Sherlock who was standing loyally by his side. He couldn't stand still anymore.
“Thanks,” John managed. Finally recovered enough to say something. “How did you know which room I was going to?”
John grinned wider, bear-tackling Sherlock into a hug anyways. Sherlock stiffened for a moment, and then seemed to relax slightly. He awkwardly patted John’s back. They rarely hugged. Sherlock wasn’t much for displays of affections, and John tried to memorize every detail of what it felt like to hug him.
His heart started pounding. It felt heavy, John thought hopefully as he weighed the envelope in his hand.
They stepped into the small coffee shop, Angelo’s. It was empty except for a exhausted looking woman typing rapidly on her Mac in a booth.
When John wasn’t reading medical books, or obsessing over Newberry’s offered classes and clubs, he had a girlfriend.
He smirked. “I am far more intelligent then the Neanderthals at the station. I’ve already cracked over thirty police cases.”
“I’m telling you,” Sherlock repeated, clenching his jaw. “All the evidence you need is in that house. If you’ll just listen to me—“
John took a deep breath, unclenched his fists, and wondered for the hundredth time how they got into Newberry.
But it wasn’t all this that made Sherlock easily the most complex and fascinating person on earth to John, but rather the startling number of contrasts that was within the boy.
John flushed, looking down. Since when did it become so hard to talk to Sherlock? “Um. No. I just haven’t seen you in a while so..” John trailed off.
Stunned silence had fallen over the room, and Sherlock was still staring at him. It was the first time John had ever seen him truly speechless.
John went and studied frantically in the library for the rest of the period, feeling that if he let himself have even a moment of rest, the ache in his heart would spread and poison his entire body.
John plopped down at their lunch table, getting away from all the muttering. Sherlock went to the library to find something on the
John raised his hand, staring somewhat nervously at the rich mahogany oak door. He knocked on the door, looking at the shiny golden plaque with dread rolling through his stomach.
And then, holding hands. Yes, John’s hand got sweaty and slightly cramped but he wasn’t going to let go until he had to. He could hear his heart pounding wildly the entire hour.
4. Lord Louis Mountbatten, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was blown to pieces in 1979 when an IRA bomb exploded on his yacht. How did police link the murderer, Thomas McMahon, to the crime scene?
9. If you know what to look for, you can tell a male from a female skull. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
“I know,” John said, not trusting his voice for say anything else. Two ridiculous, inadequate words for everything that was racing through him.
He panted and tried to catch his breath, whilst watching Sherlock rattle off to the police on the phone. After what seemed like an eternity of explaining what case it was, who the killer is, and the victim, Sherlock finally got to the location.
Okay, so here's my headcannon for Sherlock when I started writing this story. I imagined that the present day Sherlock was hardened during his high school and university years, teased relentlessly by his classmates for being the 'freak', as demonstrated by Sebastian's words during TBB. This is partly why he became so emotionally detached. So in this AU, Sherlock was already slightly distant from his primary school years where he learned that he was different, but because he met John Watson twenty or so years before he was supposed to, John was able to get to know and become friends with a Sherlock that was slightly friendlier and less cold. This is why Sherlock's actions and words in these chapters are lighter than what he might normally say in BBC's production.
“Yes, well, I was defending your virtue,” John half-heartedly joked. Anger lingered from what Sebastian said. Punching him was incredibly satisfying, but not enough.
He didn’t know how it even happened, but they were prodding each other repeatedly and then their fingers were tangling and then their pinkies hooked together. And John’s heart was pounding so loudly he thought the whole class could hear it, and it was absolutely ridiculous but Sherlock was so close to him and his hand was large and warm.
“Then it’s only logical that we be partners. I’ve made it a personal interest to study past criminal cases. Between my vast knowledge of well, everything” John arched a skeptical eyebrow at that, “and your obsession with becoming a doctor, we would easily have the best project in this class.”
Sherlock nodded. “These are call cold cases. They seemed pretty simple, I figure it would take us a couple hours to crack them. We can move on to the project from there.”
“And they’re both dreadfully normal. I can’t stand staying at home for more than a couple days.” Sherlock finished.
The bus rolled to a slow stop in front of a hotel, and John notes that It’s one of the chains he sees across Europe. The bus was subdued; most people were still sleeping. He glances over at Greg, who had his mouth tipped half open and head lolled onto Molly’s shoulder, and then he catches Molly’s eyes, who give him a small smile before gently shaking Greg awake.
Sherlock finally looked at John and his eyes were wide with fear. “How is it fine?” Sherlock hissed. John was reminded of a feral dog snapping when people got too close. “You’ve made it abundantly clear that you’re not gay.”
He started going back to his original passion of becoming a doctor, studying the books that he meant to read during the school year. Now, without Sherlock by his side, John begun to find it impossible and ridiculous that he could have ever abandoned his studies completely.
John took a bite of his lasagna and let out a moan. It was heavenly, the mozzarella practically melted on his tongue. He looked up and saw Sherlock twirling strands of linguine onto his fork and staring at John with amusement.
When John went to lunch that day, he didn’t see Sherlock. Assuming he was in the library or laboratory again, John went and sat next to his other friends.
John sighed and poked at his food, keeping a humorous smile on his face. Oh what he wouldn’t do for it all to be true.
Sherlock nodded and they walked in stilted silence towards the elevator “So, um, how are your classes?” John asked, trying to make conversation and feeling all the words he wanted to say clog up in his throat.
He felt a warm blossom of fondness at Sherlock’s words, and he resisted the urge to touch those soft-looking curls.
“He doesn’t think of me in that way, and even if he did, I won’t jeopardize our friendship for some half-lived romance that’ll probably end with one of us hating each other,” John said, looking down at the grass.
However, that didn’t stop it from having its social boundaries and shortcomings. It was the way a student chose to act that placed them in social groups.
“We saw each other over the summer,” John reminded her, pecking her lips but not embracing her. “You came to my match two weeks ago remember?”
John found it difficult to keep the scowl on his face when Sherlock was absolutely gasping with laugher. It was contagious.
Sherlock wasn’t short the last time John saw him, far from it. But he also wasn’t impossibly lean and tall either.
They came to the front of the room, and upon seeing the room number, they exchanged a look. The bright plaque on the oak door, sure enough, was 221.
Sherlock scooted closer to him, their bodies almost bumping together. John sighed, and leaned his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, still looking at the grass.
After rugby practice, John was tired, sweaty and not in the mood for any shit. So when he saw Anderson and Dimmock making their way over to him, it was all John could to not just sock the grins off their faces.
I know that there doesn't seem to be much of a point to this story, and this chapter was messy in its composition. I do have a plan for it, but apologies for not being able to put it together right now. I promise this will get better if you keep reading.
I'm sorry I haven't posted in like two months, I've just been so busy. Hopefully this chapter makes up for it, and I promise that soon the boys will be on their way to making up. The 'sharing a hotel room' trope never gets old *wink.*
Sherlock looked amused, even as the giggles wore off. “You didn’t wake up even after I called your name five times. I decided it was time for more drastic measures.” He smirked as he continued, “You’re lucky I didn’t resort to mouth to mouth resuscitation.”
“Yes,” John said finally. “I do.” Before Sherlock could say anything else John continued, “I know that you hate me, and that you’re with Victor, but. I do. I have for a long time.”
John had a half-hatched plan for Sherlock’s present, but he had no idea how he was going to be able to carry it out. He’d briefly considered calling Mycroft; he’d heard a lot about Sherlock’s incredibly influential brother fresh out of Uni while Sherlock grumbled about his “fat head” and how he was always butting into his business. He didn’t even have Mycroft’s number, and even if he did, Sherlock would undoubtedly go into a week long sulk and wouldn’t enjoy his present at all.
John rolled his eyes, “wouldn’t put it past you,” he smiled widely at Sherlock, feeling a bubble of happiness in his chest.
But it wasn’t the beauty or intellectual standards of the school that kept popping up in his dreams.
Irene snorted, leaning forward. “Come on, you guys practically spend every waking second together.” She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. “And maybe some non-waking seconds.”
“You two must be Sherlock and John, Greg’s friends. I’m Detective Inspector William Lestrade,” he said, extending his hand.
Last night, after they’d snuck back into their dorm room at 3 am, he collapsed on the bed and neglected his homework.
He figured that Sherlock was joking. John laughed along, mainly so that he could see Sherlock grin again.
They were racing down an alley, and John’s heart was pounding in his chest. With each thud of his feet slamming against the dirty pavement, he felt that he was soaring higher and higher. He turned towards Sherlock, who was sprinting next to him, and grinned so wide he thought it might split his face.
Not to mention dangerous. After he exclaimed to Sherlock that they were fifteen and far too young to chase after criminals in the dead of the night, he was met with an eye roll.
Greg and Mike were in rugby as well, so he said that Sherlock would finally be coming to this match.
John was a coward. Plain and simple. He’d always criticized Sherlock for not expressing himself, for bottling up his emotions and coming across as cold. But he’d been blind to the fire in Sherlock’s eyes when they kissed, the way his voice cracked when he asked John why they couldn’t be together. There was passion and anger and brilliance pouring out of him every second, begging to be noticed. John just couldn’t see it past the boy he’d painted over Sherlock.
Just as John had almost cleared his thoughts enough so that he could go back to his book, his phone rang. It was Sherlock.
Sherlock stopped in front of an black, inconspicuous looking umbrella that had a lethal blade sticking out from its bottom. Sherlock stared for a moment and then laughed, turning to John and his eyes shining with amusement. John was confused and cocked his head, the
Her name was Anna. Big green eyes with long blonde hair. John liked everything about her, she was kind, funny, smart, and she always supported him. They’d been dating for two years now.
5. In 1835, Henry Goddard was asked to investigate a burglary in Southampton, England. The butler said a shot had been fired as he struggled with the burglars. Goddard retrieved the bullet and disproved the butler’s version of events by using which technique?
John couldn’t help but imagine what it would be like to be in Newberry, to belong to an school that prestigious.
“Hey Sherlock,” John mumbled, head buried between his knees. He didn’t want Sherlock to see him like this, but then again, it was too late anyways. He could never keep anything from Sherlock, and he knew that it wouldn’t take long for Sherlock to find him.
John had been considering something, but he wasn’t sure. He decided to run it past Sherlock first, but he had already guessed what his response would probably be.
John looked up and saw Irene. He forced down his tidal wave of emotions and smiled at her. “I’m waiting for my mom to get here.”
John mentally added that to the list of things Sherlock likes and dislikes, and realized that the lists only consisted of three things. There was so much John didn’t know about his best friend.
It was no secret that she had a huge crush on Sherlock, it was something that everyone knew, but never mentioned.
John had given up trying to make a list of Sherlock’s attributes, but he had drawn the conclusion that he would never stop following Sherlock through dark alleys at 3 am, or crowded school halls.
Something brightened in her eyes. “Of course. He’s practically famous in this school. He only started officially attending this year, but he’s been sort of recruited for orchestra here for three years already.”
If fifteen years later someone asked John exactly what happened on that day, he wouldn’t be able to tell them a thing about the movie they watched. He wouldn’t be able to remember the classroom, who the teacher was, or any of his other classmates in that room with him. Classmates who he had once called his closest friends.
When they finally pulled away for air, John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s and exhaled slowly.
“When she married my father and had Mycroft and I, she gave up on her studies so he could raise us. If she hadn’t stopped, I’m sure she could’ve won the Nobel prize for physics.”
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, tore all those walls down and revealed a boy who now itched at the prospect of breaking boundaries no matter the consequences. A boy who now wanted to never stop running, never stop following the mad man, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock blinked, looking almost surprised, before getting that twinkle in his eyes and John knew that the some of the ice between them had melted.
Sherlock pursued his lips and shook his head. “Gross naked eye and photographic assessment is not always accurate. Yellowing or browning of bruises can take weeks to appear. I did an experiment.”
She waited a moment, scrutinizing his overly exuberant smile. “You look sad when you think no one sees you.”
John made his way over and sat down, trying to not look at his counselor directly. His coal black eyes always made John feel like he was being stripped down to his skeleton.
Oh. Sherlock had on an oversized sweater that sloped over his shoulders, and ridiculously tight shorts. How could someone look so vulnerable and yet so mind-meltingly hot at the same time. After gaping for a solid minute, John cleared his throat and looked away.
Sherlock grinned. “Usually. The one I chose for our project was a bit more difficult. I wasn’t planning on having to use the archives for it, but you saw how useless those news articles were.” He shrugged and went back to skimming the report.
While it was still true that they’d only met just that morning, it suddenly didn’t seem so ridiculous to think that he could get lost in the entity that was Sherlock Holmes.
“My brother, Mycroft,” Sherlock started to explain once his fits of laughter had calmed enough. “That pompous arsehole started having a love affair with black umbrellas five years ago, and I’ve been making fun of him ever since. He would love this.”
A strange look came into Sherlock’s eyes, and there was a tension laden pause before he replied quietly that he hadn’t tried any cases since the last one he and John went on together.
“Oh please, don’t be coy,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “We both know you don’t really want to have anything to do with me.”
Sherlock read the mildly panicked expression on his face. “I didn’t want to wake you. I already went down to the breakfast hall and brought back some food.” He gestured to the table. “It’s over there. I didn’t know what you liked, so I got a bit of everything.”
Sherlock shook his head, “No,” he said, a hint of laughter in his voice, “he’s straight as a pole, and I talked his ear off about you all the time.”
Sherlock’s eyes were piercing and his gaze never wavered as he looked at John; his face was kept carefully neutral. Several seconds later, the corner of his mouth twitched and a slow smile spread out over his face.
John stepped forward. “Don’t you dare. I tried,” John could feel his voice about to break, “so hard to stay with you.”
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, tore all those walls down and revealed a boy who now itched at the prospect of breaking boundaries no matter the consequences. A boy who now wanted to never stop running, never stop following the mad man, Sherlock Holmes.
John thought he could still feel the lingering warmth from their hug, and suddenly he felt an overwhelming urge to chase after that black car. He wouldn’t be seeing Sherlock for two months and John didn’t want to let go of him for even a second.
He figured he wouldn’t be much help now anyways, Sherlock seemed to be doing fine. After John checked the time and saw it was almost midnight, he decided they were going to need some caffeine if they were going to pull another all-nighter.
John glared at him. “We are breaking curfew, sneaking out of campus, and breaking about fifty different laws right now. All for a school project?!”
“Sorry sweetheart,” John said, catching her hands and stroking them. “I want to do this properly. Not a quick shag on my dorm bed.”
Mr. Wallace cleared his throat. “Please turn them in at the end of class; I’ll be reviewing them later and I’ll plan your classwork this week based on them.”
John stood outside the classroom, waiting for Sherlock to pack up. They had a free period next anyways, and John figured he could talk to Sherlock then. John fidgeted for a good five minutes before he saw Sherlock come out of the class, and then his heart sank. Victor and Sherlock were together and Victor seemed to be laughing at something Sherlock said. Victor was leaning against Sherlock and smiling widely with his stupid white teeth and tousled hair and did he really have to stand so close to him?
Sherlock half the time would sit at this table, and the other half would go to do research or something alike. Sometimes he dragged John along.
John sat up straighter. “It doesn’t matter. I’m not going to stop being friends with Sherlock and nothing you can say will change that.
The strangest thing was, during the summer, John’s life almost went back to normal. Of course he still thought about his mad roommate far more than what’s healthy, but John felt that maybe things were sliding back to what they were before Sherlock.
"Ok." Sherlock leaned into John's chest and yawned lightly. John wrapped his arms loosely around Sherlock. They laid like that until they drifted off to sleep.
Sherlock blushed and licked his lips. "I find it fascinating, yet some parts are highly disgusting." Sherlock shrugged lightly and leaned further back on his desk. John was looking at him in such a way that his stomach began to flip flop. He wanted John to look at him like that forever.
There was a taller woman in the back of the diner with long blonde curls, Sherlock picked her out as Harriet. Across from her sat an older man and woman, obviously John's parents. When Harriet spotted John and Sherlock she grinned wide, showing off some beautiful white teeth, and began to wave. John's parents turned around to see their son with another boy.
"Just look at the keypad. The four most used are 6204 and then its just a matter of probability and lucky guesses." Sherlock shifted a bit. John just smiled wider.
"Hey," John opened his eyes and Sherlock gently turned John's head towards him. "I'm right here, and no matter what, you have me." Sherlock leaned his forehead against John's.
He turned the water on to cold and cupped the cold water in his hands. Gently he patted the cold water on his face. Leaning over the sink he panted breathlessly and watched the water go down the drain. Hiding in here would do no good, he knew that. Slowly he shut off the water and stared at his reflection.
"What are you trying to do here, John?" His father asked harshly through clenched teeth. John, Sherlock, and Harriet all froze. It was silent. "Huh?" His father asked again, but louder this time. John didn't know what to do or say. His heart was thumping loudly in his ears. There was a lump in his throat and a knot in his stomach. "Is this to punish us for what we said about being a doctor?" His father snapped even louder than before. A few people turned to stare.
"She said some harsh things I would never ever even think about saying." He rubbed his thumb across the back of Sherlock's hand.
Then, John took a big step back and his face changed. Lucy's eyes went wide, she obviously said something John didn't like and was surprised by his reaction. He clenched his jaw and furrowed eyebrows. With a deep inhale through his nose he said something slow and harsh through clenched teeth. Sherlock had never seen John be angry or rude to anyone. However, he did find it pretty sexy the way John's muscles tensed and how strong he looked. Lucy scoffed and turned to make direct eye contact with Sherlock. She glared right at him then turned back to John who looked furious.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand and rubbed his knuckles with his thumb. John took a deep breath, but his voice came out almost inaudible. "N-No." His father scoffed amd crossed his arms.
"You're supposed to have both hands on the wheel." Sherlock squeezed John's hand gently. He could tell John was getting nervous. John just chuckled lightly.
would be able to go to my room and return it from where he took it." Mycroft retorted in a dull voice from behind the door. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I also hear
Sherlock leaned against his desk and bit his lip. He felt slightly embarrassed as he watched John check out his room, but the way John smiled at everything made Sherlock feel ok about the state of his room. John chuckled and picked up one textbook that was sitting on top of Sherlock's dresser. "The Complexities of the Male Anatomy?" John asked softly. He smirked and waved it at Sherlock.
“Alright. Nice compromise.” Sherlock smiled as they shook hands. A vivid image from Sherlock's health book comes to mind. The chapter is Developing and Maintaining Healthy Relationships with a bright blue heading "Effective Compromising." Sherlock puts a mental check next to it.
Sherlock is laying on the bed in the nurse’s office with his arm over his eyes and John’s head in his lap. He’s gently carding his fingers through the soft blonde hair. The room is quiet, and John feels comfortable, but Sherlock’s brain continues to run wild with countless possibilities of future interactions with Anderson. He’s worried about John’s safety, not his own.
John hangs up and hangs his head. Sherlock slips down and onto to floor. He walks over to John timidly and wrappes his arms around John's torso. John lets his shoulders sloop as Sherlock rests his head inbetween his shoulder blades. "We can do whatever you'd like, John." He whispers soothingly. John smiles slightly. He knew Sherlock would be supportive, but John just couldn't decide what to do.
"I...Sherlock, I'm sorry I...hurt you." Anderson admitted softly. While John and Sherlock both stood shocked, Anderson turned on his heel and walked away.
Sherlock moved his hands up and pushed off John's varsity jacket. John shook out his arms and it fell to the floor, and then lifted Sherlock onto the desk and slid inbetween his legs. Sherlock put his hands back on John's waist and wrapped his legs around John's hips. Slowly, John moved his hands, giving Sherlock time to stop him if he wanted. He slid his hands under Sherlock's shirt. A soft squeak came from the back of his throat, but Sherlock didn't stop John. Sherlock's body is toned, and his skin is soft. John wants to touch more of him. Cautiously, he began to lift off his shirt. They seperated and swiftly removed Sherlock's shirt. John leaned back and bit his lips as he admired Sherlock's bare chest. "Don't ever let anyone tell you you're not
Eyes wide, mouth open, and cheeks a dark crimson color, Sherlock quickly grabbed the rugby jersey that was hung to the front of his locker and scurried towards the gym. The people in the hall erupted in whispers and more gasps. "No way that was meant for...him" a few girls scoffed.
When they got to Sherlock's house it was almost midnight, and the house was dark and quiet. Sherlock intertwined his fingers with John's as they walked into the house. Sherlock slipped off his shoes, but stopped John from taking his off. "It'd be best if I got the chance to explain the situation to them before they knew you were here." Sherlock bit his lip with a mischievous glint in his eye. John smiled and chuckled softly. Sherlock was not as innocent as he seemed.
hurt Harriet's feelings, but John was worried Sherlock might pick up on something Harriet didn't want him to.
A blushing Sherlock took the back of her hand and kissed it gently. "Nice to meet you Harriet, I've heard so much about you."
John smiled a little and kissed Sherlock's forehead. Rubbing his hands up and down his arms he rested their foreheads together. "You're brilliant, Sherlock Holmes.
"Sherlock." John whispered as he brushed some of his curls out of his eyes. Sherlock moved closer and looked up at John. He hummed softly as a response. "You know you...didn't have to do any of this tonight. Right?" This was a question that had been nagging John since they'd stopped kissing. He didn't want to push Sherlock or make him uncomfortable.
Sherlock and John went through their day with eyes on them at all times. It was extremely tiring for both of them. They couldn't think clearly with all of the attention. So, when lunch came around they both felt relief flood their bodies. They could have 45 minutes without all of the stares and whispers.
"Will be coming to your game tonight, and we're going to dinner afterwards." John let's out a breath and relaxes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, yet smiled wide. It was so extremely cheesy, but he didn't care. He slipped of his button up shirt and put on John's jersey at once. It was thin, breathable and a bit big. Sherlock was lean and toned, but he didn't have John's wide shoulders or his muscles.
Both boys stood in surprise and confusion fot a few minutes. Neither of them knew what to say. John finally broke the tension. "Do you think he meant it?"
"Yeah. We were wondering if you'd bring along your special someone? We're all dying to me her." His mother giggles and he feels the sliver of hope vanishing. He clears his throat and eyes Sherlock nervously. He isn't ashamed of who he is, or of Sherlock. This should be easy, but its so hard. He doesn't know what to do.  "John?"
"You heard John. If anyone has a fucking problem with that, they better say it to my face." Sherlock stood up. For once he wasn't letting people push him around. John made him stronger and he wanted to be strong for John. Sally tensed up, looked around, and then slowly sat back down. Sherlock paused and waited a second longer. Everyone stared quietly, and so he sat back down.
All his life he'd been told to "man up" by coaches and his parents. John's always trying to please everyone; being captain of the rugby team and an honors student. He's never really done anything for himself. He wanted this. He wanted to come out, with or without Sherlock. Who he loves won't change how smart he is or how good of a rugby player he is. But denying who he loves would only cause more pain, stress, and self-consciousness. John decided then and there that no matter what happened, this was who he was and he wasn't going to hide it anymore.
A small frown fell on his face when he saw Lucy Crawford leaning against John's locker. They were talking to each other and although Sherlock couldn't hear the conversation, he could definitely read them. John's body was pivoted away from her, a sign of him not being fully engaged in the conversation. Yet, John was smiling and nodding along. Lucy was drawing out certain syllables. She was constantly shifting towards him. John remained facing away and his body was rigid. He was not very comfortable with her getting closer to him.
When John finished changing he grabbed his duffel bag, and hurried out of the locker room. He could still feel Anderson's eyes on him, and new he was following him out. John pushed open the door and spotted Sherlock almost instantly. They locked eyes and both boys let out a soft sigh of relief. They rushed to each other and John dropped his duffel so he could pick up Sherlock. Sherlock was caught completely off gaurd when his feet left the ground, and let out a tiny squeal that made John's heart beat faster. They locked lips and put all of their nerves and adrenaline from the day into the passionate kiss. John spun them as they kissed, and when he finally put Sherlock down and they broke their kiss, he noticed Anderson watching them from multiple feet away.
