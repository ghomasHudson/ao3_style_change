"What the hell…?" Anderson blinked in surprise.
"NO!"
“Sherlock, I want you to stop smoking that. It isn’t safe. There’s a reason it’s looked down upon to engage in such habits,” John tried to take the pipe away gently but Sherlock turned away, flailing his arms more dramatically than usual.
She turned his ankle and he gave no reaction. She pressed on the left side of his foot and he appeared bored. She turned her attention to the right half, and Sherlock gave a hiss of pain.
“Calm down, John! It is opium. Quite popular amongst British and Chinese culture these days.” He inhaled a long drag from the pipe, blowing it out slowly and smoothly as if he were specifically trying to grate on John’s nerves.
"Come dance with me, then," John leaned in closer. Mycroft tried not to laugh at how uncomfortable his brother seemed at the prospect of joining the mass of sweaty bodies at various stages of drunkenness.
“Oh, I just needed to get out of the house,” John sighed.
“I’m the owner of the house. My name is Irene Adler.”
"Irene's lover was killed because of Charles Augustus Magnussen. That means that Irene has information that could bring Magnussen down, freeing plenty of people," Sherlock gave him a level gaze. Mycroft glowered.
“The victim is-” Lestrade started.
“Oh, various different people- typically suspects, some murderers, a few thieves, and some unsuspecting bystanders here and there. Whatever was necessary for the work…” Sherlock only glanced in John’s direction, but the gaze was fond. However, the soldier knew what it meant when Sherlock appeared so casual in front of a person; John was on alert.
"Now, are you okay?" John turned to Sherlock. "He didn't get off any other shots after I was on the ground, did he? I would hate to know I went through all that trouble to protect you, just to have you injured, too-"
And it was definitely worth it, cursing in from of the minister years later, when John got to end his vows with, "Truly, Sherlock, you were never acting. You ARE an arse, but that's okay, because you're my arse, and as long as that's true, I can deal with the severed heads and the violin at 3AM, and the assorted criminals in the livingroom. And honestly, I would choose a wild life with you, knowing I'm going to have to save my arse, than a quiet life any day."
"I still want to see it."
"It's not like he's your husband," Anderson rolled his eyes.
He sipped the cheap wine that was the only stuff available, watching the crowd carefully, absorbing nearly all the information his younger brother would, but rather than voice it, he filed it away. He used his information as concealed weaponry. He hid his ability away, whereas Sherlock broadcasted his brilliance for the world. There was very little Mycroft didn't know about these people anyway. He had done background checks on everyone at various points.
“It’s Lestrade, leave it,” Sherlock held him closer.
John has trust issues, and Mycroft cares...but doesn't want anyone to know.
The police force had seen Holmes in a variety of moods, but never had they seen him so frayed because of a person.
“What are you doing?” John asked.
"I don't. How about, you kiss me again, and later we can laugh at those stupid expressions on Anderson's and Donovan's faces," John leaned towards his best friend, now his- well, he didn't know.
“Wake up!” Sherlock yelled, panicking. It hadn’t been this bad in a long time. Finally, Sherlock tried to pin John down so he could try to reason with him when he wasn’t fighting imagined enemies.
John looked up at Sherlock, his deep blue eyes both angry and disbelieving, but there was a heat in there that had nothing to do with being upset.
“But why would they go for drugs? Sherlock!” John snapped. He held eye contact with him, reading what he could in those caribbean eyes.
“I’m about eighty years old, Sherlock. Apparently people like us don’t age. We don’t die because we heal. I suppose we just are,” John explained.  Sherlock looked up at him with wide eyes.
"He’s been so lonely, dear. Up at all times of the night with that violin. Not to mention, getting those drugs busts..."
"Would love to," Greg grinned, taking the offered appendage.
“Put on clothes before you go downstairs.” John shook his head, taking the stairs down to the door two at a time. He pulled it open, and sure enough, there was Lestrade.
“No, I miss plenty. It just happens that, whereas crime scenes and chemistry labs and mortuaries are Sherlock’s area, people are mine. That’s why we work so well together. Besides, after one spends so long in the company of Sherlock Holmes, one picks up on certain things.”
Sherlock was babbling. Sherlock never babbled, and it unnerved John Watson to the core.
"No drugs," Sherlock interrupted her.
“You’re naked.”
"Yes."
“I’ll be in touch,” he said. “John, please get the door for Ms. Adler.”
"Oh for Christ's sake!" Sherlock snapped. "It was not a milk man! It was a delivery man!"
"This is a sight to see," Greg grinned as he looked over the Holmes boys.
This gave Sherlock pause. “Who are you, soldier?”
She glared up. "You don't know him like you think you do; I've read the blog, I bet you just 'deleted' the information about my brother you didn't find important, which I bet would be the majority."
"Be careful."
“Jesus,” John’s breath left him in a puff of air. “Yes, God yes.”
"I swear to God I'm going to shoot somebody," John growled. Sherlock looked down, and Mycroft shifted his gaze to the tense body on the bed. "I had a wonderful night of not sleeping, and I desired to have a wonderful morning of catching up on said lost sleep, and it is being ruined by this sibling argument shit. We are going to move it out of this bedroom, and we are going to wait to discuss it until I have some bloody caffeine in my system, or someone is going to end up with a bullet in them."
"Al…alright," she gulped.
“Mmm, I made a bad impression. I have go down and let him in, try to repair my reputation. I’m usually much nicer than that.” John stood, throwing on a pair of pajama bottoms.
"Sherlock, I need time out with friends," John huffed.
Sherlock felt entirely blindsided. How could he have been so unaware? He had never been so unobservant that he missed so much going on around him, especially not something so important.
Now, she sat on the couch, and Sherlock paced in front of her.
"No shit, Sherlock," John rolled his eyes.
“Are you trying to say thank you?” John grinned.
“She can’t know,” John insisted. “No one can. Technically, I wasn’t supposed to say anything.”
“John,” Sherlock murmured. “John, it’s just a dream. You can wake up.”
There were years of aliases and traveling and scientific experiments. There were fights and laughter and silence and conversations with just a look and drunken nights of loud bonding. They were close, occasionally checking in with Harriet and Mycroft. But their main concerns were each other. Best friends, family, there were many labels that fit parts of what they were to each other, but at the end of the day, they didn’t need a label.
“The only person I know of is my sister, well, and you now.” John sat across from him.
John had been back two weeks when Sherlock took a case with NSY. They took a cab to the crime scene, and Sally was waiting by the police tape.
"I thought my brother was the only man you were attracted to, Doctor Watson!" Mycroft called out, masking his desperation by pompousness.
At that time, John had delved into medicine. Although he had been a soldier for the first century of his life, his passion was in helping people. It was something that endeared him to Sherlock. John had a very dual-natured personality. Both a killer and a healer, personable while also despising the average population, caring and ruthless, patient with a violent temper; he could also be quite clever but also had a tendency to be a bit idiotic or blind when it came to the mysteries Sherlock so adored. He was a brilliant conductor of light.

"I suppose I'm grateful for that," Mycroft watched as Greg danced with Molly. Mycroft danced, sure, but not unless the situation called for it. He wasn't gifted with his brother's grace.
"Leave us!" Sherlock commanded. They scampered out pretty easily.
John stood in the middle of the kitchen, watching Sherlock go about his business with an experiment.
“What do you mean?”
“Oh,” she ignored their little spat. “I was just saying that Sherlock doesn’t seem the type to do well being alone. I think 221B was meant for more than one person...Now, will you still need the two bedrooms?”
"You prefer to text," Lestrade eyed him curiously. "Who is Captain Watson?"
Maybe, the faces of Lestrade and Donovan were worth it when they barged in the next morning, worried (Lestrade was anyway) that Sherlock hadn't responded to a text late at night like he normally would. Maybe, seeing the slight blush on the Detective's cheeks was worth snogging him a good one when he was unprepared. And maybe banishing the police force so they could move to a proper bed ("After all, we've lived together for over a year, and we've slept together; would it really be so bad if we
"Fine, back away from the Irene Adler case," Mycroft looked down his nose at his brother.
“Are you serious?” Lestrade scoffed.
just how much he liked this little gift from Sherlock to himself.
“Do you honestly think Scotland Yard is the first people he worked with?” John cocked an eyebrow. “Sherlock’s been taking cases for the government for years. He has to be bored enough, or the cases have to be interesting enough… But it DOES happen.”
"You have a husband? Who would marry you?" Sally scoffed.
Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, but he made eye contact with the wounded doctor. Instead of verbally responding, he sat beside him, taking his friend, suddenly overcome with gratitude that the man was okay.
"We're pretty sure he broke part of his foot. As his doctor, normally I'd handle him (really, asking anyone else to is just inhumane), but I'm in no shape to treat him at the moment," John motioned to his torn clothes and exhausted features.
"Sherlock!" John raised his voice, using that force of command he got from so many years of climbing different military ranks. Sherlock turned around while the police group got silent. "Care to introduce me to your stalkers?"
“I know,” John said. His hand traveled to the back of Sherlock’s head, massaging. The detective let his head fall forward, surrendering himself to the caring touch. He didn’t mean to rest his forehead against John’s, but he did. Still, he was surprised when John’s lips touched his.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx
“You really mean that,” Sherlock noted. “You really are that good.”
evil, clever man. If anyone ever touches your cock again, and it is not me, I will abuse every bit of power I wield to make them suffer for the rest of their pathetic lives."
Greg narrowed his eyes at both Holmes. He and John looked at each other, a plan forming in their eyes. Although the brothers could tell when the mischief bloomed in their gazes, they weren't quite sure what to expect next. They just knew it wasn't likely to be good. Unfortunately, their weaknesses were literally working against them.
I'm sure the thought has crossed many a mind that it was horribly
He looked tired. The bags under his eyes were more prominent and the lines deeper. Still, Sherlock found that the steady handsomeness that lasted throughout every evolution of the social definition of beauty was still there. The deep blue eyes were still sharp. They found him through the crowd.
“I am not a dom, therefore John is not my assistant,” Sherlock’s gaze got hard. “He’s my partner.”
"Not now, Sherlock," John sighed.
Sherlock looked over the left-handed divorcee, taking in the marijuana use and nicotine addiction, along with the presence of two- three cats, and decided he was wholly unworthy of his attention.
“Weren’t we?” John asked. “Excluding the more intimate acts, nothing has changed. I love you the same way as I did yesterday; there’s just a new aspect to it. You should have told me.”
"More stupid than usual?" Sherlock smirked as he got closer to the doctor's tempting lips.
Sherlock's bellow attracted the attention of several officers nearby.
“That’s a bit concerning,” John’s eyebrows drew together. “So, if this guy is as bad as you say, why are we getting involved?”
"I'm not the hero," he insisted, "that's him."
“-that Magnussen has something on my brother and on those working around him? Yes, I am. So I am not only doing this because it is interesting, I am also helping out my brother and the British Government.”
John sighed; before he could respond with anything more serious, Dr. White came back in.
"Sherlock, you need to calm down," he tried to say in a soothing voice.
“How long is so long?” Lestrade asked.
“I mean it, Sherlock. What is it?” John was worried, and so he was becoming angry. Unfortunately, he knew it to be a fact that, despite what he might say about Mycroft, often Sherlock’s greatest enemy was himself.
“And yet it is your leg that is affected. Are you going to claim it is a punishment from your God?” he sneered.
"Yes, more than usual," John chuckled.
“Dr. Watson, is it?” she asked.
"We'll get you splinted, and recommend a foot and ankle specialist. As for pain, the pills I'm looking at are-"
“Of course!” She smiled. “It’s so nice that Sherlock has someone. After all, he’s been so lonely, dear. Up at all times of the night with that violin. Not to mention, getting those drugs busts every so often-”
Lestrade looked confused. “Then why did you?”
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
"Only an idiot jumps in front of a speeding bullet to save a friend," Sherlock snapped when he deemed that John was indeed going to live.
Sherlock didn’t bother getting more opium after that, instead hunting John’s trail all the way to France. He watched him for awhile at a distance, afraid of being rejected if John really didn’t want to see him again. John had started off doing more doctor work, his French rusty but still useable, and he even seemed to be making friends. Sherlock wasn’t too surprised; John was a friendly person, nice and supportive. But he had hoped that maybe he was missing Sherlock as much as he was missing John.
"I never got it fixed; it still has the hole from where I got shot," John cleared his throat like he did when situations got emotional or awkward.
"Because, I love you, you idiot, and I couldn't stand to lose you, not again," John grabbed a handful of dark curls, ignoring the pain it caused. "Want to tell me why you jumped off the roof?"
Sherlock whipped around to back her into place with just a look, along with Anderson who had snickered.
“I am not a peacock,” Sherlock growled.
“No, you’re fine. Come on in,” John smiled. Lestrade followed him in, going up to the living room. “Care for a cuppa?”
Sherlock's voice rang through the whole of the hospital floor. Lestrade turned to see him harassing the nurse behind the desk.
"I never said you were," Mycroft said quietly.
"Dammit to hell, Anderson, shut up!" Lestrade yelled, secretly thinking just how happy he was for the couple.
“I suppose,” Sherlock tried to hide his smile in response.
"John," Sherlock stopped just before their mouths touched; his breath fanned out across John's face. "Why did you jump in from of the bullet?"
He and Lestrade touched their glasses together before continuing on with the match on the television.
Recognition dawned in her eyes.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
~xxxxx~
Greg looked up at Mycroft, worried and smug.
Sherlock frowned as he saw John run a hand over his face; his doctor stretched out on the bed in the immediate care room and closed his eyes.
While Sherlock practiced walking up and down the hallway at her insistence ("It's a requirement."), Dr. White stood next to John.
“What I need your help with, Mr. Holmes, is finding someone. I need you to find someone, and then tell me how to get rid of him. See, I collect insurance in my job. Bits of information here and there that ensure that I get protection when I need it. Unfortunately, a client of mine gave me some information on someone that didn’t want to be vulnerable. And then he sent out a hit to get my attention. He wanted to be sure I got the message, so he killed my lover. Now, I’m angry. And I am looking for help.” Irene had a hard set to her face that proved she was no longer playing her dominatrix game. Instead, she was a warrior like out of some Amazonian tribe. It was interesting.
"Are you serious- you actual give a damn about him, don't you?" Donovan's eyes grew wide.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh, John…”
"Back off of Magnussen. Or else consider yourself going against me."
Sherlock watched her closely. Her blue-green eyes were sharp, taking in his reaction. His face was carefully blank, though.
"And you would be?"
John and Sherlock disappeared, hiding out until the Inquisition faded into the background. During this time, they came to learn who the other was, what made them tick. John was grateful for his extra decades he had to develop patience, because hiding out with a man who became bored during tense situations could be very trying.  Sherlock was intrigued with the other man though, and although he came across as rude and inconsiderate, he was taking in every fact he could about his new acquaintance.
“Well thank God I’m not normal.”
"Don't be too hard on him, Anderson. The Freak has finally found love," Donovan smirked. Sherlock glared. Anger at the pair of them was easier to face than the anger with himself or the Russian Assassin he would happily tear apart bone by bone, ligament by ligament, until he begged for mercy.
“John Watson. And who are you?”
“‘s not the drugs that I’m tryin’ to give you,” Sherlock mumbled, stumbling and falling before he could reach his seat. “‘s the feeling, John. Euphoria.”
“Mrs. Hudson, this is Dr. John Watson,” Sherlock introduced the two. He had asked that she have him and a guest over for dinner, and of course she agreed.
"It's not that difficult to figure out if you have a small amount of brain cells and any knowledge of you," John stated. "Contrary to popular belief, I'm not the biggest idiot in the world."
they choose to use their brain cells?" Sherlock hissed as Greg very clearly... "Tell him to stop groping my boyfriend! That part of him is only for me!"
"Unless you're family, I can't let you in. I'm sorry."
"No, I don't!"
“I’m certainly not letting you suffer here for eternity,” John looked appalled that anyone would consider him capable of such an atrocity.
John's breathing patterns had increased, indicating he was awake. It wasn't surprising, as he was only recently home from Afghanistan, and he was sleeping in a stressful environment constantly there, always on alert. The slightest of noises could wake him up anymore, so a voice was as good as an alarm.
"You're not going to distract me, John. What happened?" Sherlock said, voice low. His tone was much more caring than he used with anyone else.
“The one he does, in fact, have sex with,” John smirked. “And quite good sex, if I do say so myself.”
The door knob turned, and John stood quickly enough that he saw black for a moment.
"Is all not well in paradise?" Mycroft asked.
“I’m a dominatrix,” she said smoothly. Sherlock, who had dealt with a case in a sex club a year back, smiled.
"Why?"
"Then I suppose I should warn you: John's only with you for your scarf," Mycroft and Sherlock both shifted their attention to the doctor, who was having what appeared to be a wonderful time, spinning one of the female officers, whose husband was off to the side, having given his approval, around the floor.
"Well, actually, I get a bit-"
Approx. 1750 AD
The first night was awkward. They hadn't engaged in any intimate activity, and they weren't going to just plan it, so saying good night was a bit difficult.
"Excuse me, sir, but I'm going to have to ask you to sit and wait out here with the rest of Dr. Watson's friends," the largest doctor spoke up.
"I'm Mycroft Holmes," he growled, eyes like lasers on every pointed of contact between the two men on the dance floor. "Since when does music need such vulgar dancing in order to enjoy it?!"
“No need for that; I knew what I was doing,” Sherlock sniffed. He looked down at his best friend and found he was much too comfortable to consider moving. “This isn’t the first time you’ve come back from war. At least you don’t have the limp like after the Crusades and the French Revolution.”
Lestrade managed to get Sherlock over to the couch.
“Your fault there too, genius,” John poked Sherlock’s arm. “Not everyone lives checking their desks for explosives hidden by their flat mate’s enemies.”
The doctor smiled. "Why didn't you just answer her?"
Sherlock pulled back, eyes a bit wide. His lips were slightly red from the activity they had been participants in, and his chest was rising more quickly than usual.
John had tears running down his face.
John smiled. “Obviously.” He looked at the group of people. “May we go now?”
"Hey!"
the British Government, you imbecile," Sherlock growled. "Forget this!"
“Because you actually respect Sherlock’s abilities,” John said. “When I first met him, people tormented him for his gifts...I got him out of that situation and it took years for me to convince him he was special, that he was worth so much more than they said. And it took so long, but he got it eventually. He still has some issues with it sometimes, and I try to avoid anything or anyone that makes him feel that way. It’s why I was so upset with Donovan. I had never met her before, and already she thought I, a man she had never met, was so much better than him. You all haven’t seen him the way I have. He can be a total dick, but he is also one of the kindest, most soft-hearted individuals I have ever had the good fortune of meeting...I mean, he actually tried to talk to me about what was wrong today, and I just blew him off. So who’s really the dick?” John put his head in his hands. Lestrade reached out to touch his shoulder.
Thanks to everyone for leaving kudos! That and comments are always welcome. Gets the creative juices flowing...
His face was relaxed, but his pupils were moving furiously under the closed lids, obviously far into the stages of a REM cycle.
, in Mycroft's mind.
"Somehow I find that hard to believe."
It was in the late 1800s that Sherlock followed his interest in crime. He started solving mysteries here and there, wherever they went really. He never gave his real name, as the last thing he needed was to be remembered in history books. That would limit his future endeavors and complicate matters. Besides, it would make John cross.
"Really?" her eyes brightened.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
"Did you honestly follow me?" Sherlock scoffed.
In the taxi ride home, Sherlock turned to John.
"I'll protect Sherlock," John interrupted. The brothers looked over to see the soldier in his beige jumper. His hair was a mess, and there were dark circles under his eyes. "It's my job, and I've done a fairly decent job of it over the years. I assure you I can continue to do it."
"Sherlock," John said, sounding as if he were doing the same thing on the other end of the phone. "What are you doing?"
“Yeah, we- SHERLOCK, DAMMIT I SAID CLOTHES!” John yelled, smacking his forehead.
"Let me rephrase: what are you doing involved with Irene Adler?" Mycroft demanded.
"I love you too," Sherlock said, touching their foreheads together briefly. "If you need anything, I'm here."
“I think we all can be dicks, but you can make it better you know?” He said gently. “What is the matter, anyway?”
“Hello, I told you to put on clothes,” John murmured.
“Both. How-”
John settled back, happy, content.
“No, Mrs. Hudson, he didn’t die!” Sherlock huffed. “He got a medical discharge after being shot.”
"We don't need your meddling, Mycroft!" Sherlock yelled. "Now talk about what you came to talk about, then leave."
“What in the hell are you laughing at?” Lestrade asked, eyes wide, still thinking about John’s story.
"Does he need help? I am able to acquire-"
"No, he doesn't get free time."
Donovan's eyes nearly bugged out of her head, as she tried to catch flies with her mouth.
“I would have figured a way out long before then,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Well, it’s nice to meet you Master Holmes.”
“Is this okay?” he asked Sherlock quietly.
John jumped, sitting up quickly, even though he was half-awake, when the door opened again. Apparently Sherlock hadn't pissed anyone off too much because there were no tears or angry-looking nurses.
"I doubted there would ever be a person who would willingly subject themselves to an extended amount of time in your presence."
"If you still want to see me in uniform, you'll get her out of here," he whispered huskily in his ear.
Sherlock Holmes was one of these few cases. He was born somewhere in the 1200s. He always had a strong intellect, which caused him to question everything. In a time of theocracy, this was something quite negative. When the Inquisition happened, Sherlock was one of the first people to be put on the torture table. When it was found they couldn’t kill him, that he would heal from everything they did, they saw him as a demon and found more painful ways to try and destroy him. At the end of each session they tried, they would lock Sherlock in a cell for the night and leave him with a guard.
“Ish…” Sherlock said. John gave him a weak smile. Sherlock tilted his head to the side, considering.
“What of it?”
Sherlock grabbed John by the front of his red shirt.
“Oh, don’t you dare! That was precious!”
Mycroft's voice cut through Sherlock's slumber. He opened his eyes, taking in the top of John's head from where it was resting on his chest, and turned to see his brother giving him a stern look from his doorway.
Sherlock refused to glance her way, much less give up the appendage.
"Well," the doctor cleared her throat, "let's have a look at that foot, shall we?"
John remembered that night when he discovered the continued life of Irene Adler. She was as flirtatious as before. Sherlock was about to run off to find the arsonist, when Irene went to kiss him. Sherlock appeared frozen, but John pulled him back, stepping between The Woman and Sherlock.
“I,” Sherlock said, hands continuing their activity; he leaned forward, lips brushing John’s ear. “am massaging my very tense war hero.” He pressed a firm kiss to the space under his ear. John bit his lip, repressing any reactions. “John, don’t hide yourself from me.”
“You aren’t happy. You’re high, and there is a very large difference,” John insisted.
"Then I'll see you in about a week. Take care of that double homicide for me." Sherlock's smile grew wide and he could practically feel John's on the other end of the line.
Anderson nearly joked.
"Got roped into this, did you?" Sherlock made a face as he sipped his own wine.
Translations:
“No, you’re evil. You’re leaving me here alone after you got  me hot and bothered. You are supposed to take care of things like that. You’re my husband. Isn’t that in your job description?” Sherlock complained, arm thrown above his head dramatically.
…would you care to join me for a dance?" John held out his hand.
"John." Sherlock closed his eyes, savoring his voice. He hadn't heard from him in months, and the truth was that he missed his best friend terribly. His voice was something that he had become attached to in the 800 years they had been together. He closed his eyes to revel in it.
At least, that happened until a certain consulting detective burst through the door, intent on taking in everything that had happened to him.
"Oh, I'm his flat-mate, colleague, doctor, friend…handler, the majority of the time. Dr. John Watson," he held out his hand for her to shake. She took it for what was a bit long for professionalism.
John’s eyes were wide and shining. “Oh god, I’m sorry.”
“That’s...that’s interesting,” John smiled. His face became serious gradually. “Sherlock, are you ready to go?”
“Well, let me enlighten you,” she said, leaning forward intently. “I have a job, and my job is important to me. Unfortunately, it isn’t one the police would look fondly on. And considering that my job is very likely the reason my girlfriend was killed, I decided to go to the person I knew had no moral qualms.”
"He is in ICU right now. Only family is allowed in to see him," he explained.
“Not with you half-naked and straddling me. Go on, humour me.”
"Gregory, as fond as I am of you, I am not as fond of your co-workers," he tipped his head back distastefully, motioning to them
"This is as much for you as it is for me," Sherlock rolled his eyes. Mycroft scoffed.
"Do you read the papers?" he asked wearily. She nodded. He pointed to Sherlock and said, "Hatman."
“If Sally heard about this…” Lestrade trailed off.
“Are you calling yourself a peahen?” Sherlock scoffed. Before John could answer, Sherlock had him out of his chair and pressed to the wall, his back to Sherlock. The detective laid his form flat against his husband’s. He moved his hips, rubbing his erection across John’s rear end. “And as far as mates...I’m quite sure I have secured one.”
on John's hips.
“My, my, Mr. Holmes, you and I are more alike than it initially appeared,” Irene said, standing. “I kept Kate as my assistant as well.”
Sherlock was behind his chair, tilting John’s head forward. John let him, and he was rewarded accordingly. Sherlock’s hands were rubbing in circles, knuckles alternately kneading the knots in his muscles.
“Just like in Venice,” John noted. “You know, when I was supposed to have an office, and you slowly crept in there with your stuff until it turned into your own private laboratory. And I still couldn’t use the kitchen for food!”
“It’s so nice to meet one of Sherlock’s friends!” Mrs. Hudson grinned. “Come in, please, come in.”
The sharp-eyed detective turned on Lestrade.
"My doctor. My friend. My John. I found him first. Get your own."
"Don't be; he just stays for the cake."
“Lestrade, could we reschedule this little get-together?” John asked, looking over at him with a tight smile. The Detective Inspector, relieved to get out of the tense situation, nodded and ducked out quickly. “Sherlock, why didn’t you talk to me about this before?”
"I have one weakness in this world," Mycroft hissed. "And Magnussen managed to find it. I refuse to let him manipulate it."
John kissed Sherlock fiercely then, as he realized that, as bad as weaknesses are, they're bearable if shared.
“Bored,” Sherlock muttered.
John managed to drift off, despite Sherlock's incessant yelling at the damned picture box. When he woke up, Sherlock's long, lean form was wrapped around him, both of them covered in a blanket from Sherlock's bed. He was warm from the shared body heat, and the man's dark curls were tickling his nose. He tried to move slightly, his arm being asleep after being tucked under the taller man for god-knows how long, but Sherlock mumbled something unintelligible before tightening his grip on the doctor. It was truly an adorable sight, the way Sherlock was precariously wrapped up in his dressing gown and as clingy as a puppy.
After the fall, and after Sherlock's return, John was never quite the same. Sure, he still went with Sherlock on his adventures, and he loved them as much as he had before, but he had come to figure out that he had a major weakness.
“John, stop it!” Sherlock giggled, then immediately went silent as he fought the noises coming out of his mouth.
The three men turned around to see the woman that had walked in. She was beautiful, with dark brown hair and alabaster skin. She wore a black coat over a tasteful white dress. Every piece of jewelry was classy and tasteful. Her lips, painted red, were twisted unhappily, but her eyes took in the body without flinching away.
“I make a point of not trying something that has not been identified to me. Now, what is it you are inhaling?” John resisted the urge to take the potentially dangerous thing out of his friends grasp.
"His boyfriend? Lestrade is your boyfriend?" Sally asked.
"Thank you," John's voice warmed. "Well, looks like I'm coming home. What do you say, do you have any need for a broken army doctor while you fight serial killers and clean up London's streets?"
He was cut off by Sherlock's lips pressed firmly to his own.
"Shut up, Sherlock."
“BORED!” Sherlock yelled, then laughed. “Oh God, John, I was so bored. But look at how far civilization has come. In my time, this was thought to be a product of the devil! They would have tortured me again for it, you know. But then, they already saw me as the devil.”
"Okay, well, let's get you in for some x-rays as soon as possible," the doctor said gently and she stood back up. She walked out of the room with a slight smile on her face.
"Well, I was investigating a double homicide. However, a soldier just came to tell me you had been shot. So now I am seeing just what the hell you are doing getting injured while Scotland Yard stares on," he gave the team a look. Most had the good sense to look somewhat ashamed and attempt to not pay attention.
Lestrade was surprised by the honesty of his answer.
“They felt I was withholding evidence,” Sherlock waved his hand flippantly.
"John is my only friend," Sherlock shrugged. "It would be considered rational to want to keep him alive. Or perhaps YOU are the high-functioning sociopath."
John dozed off while Sherlock was gone. He didn't have the energy to hope the detective would mind his manners and just not speak at all to the poor women out there (no men had been seen). It had been too long since he had gotten the chance to rest. He wasn't a machine; he couldn't work on zero sleep and still list off a hundred digits of pi and say the Magna Carta by memory.
“I heard you were a virgin,” she said.
"Because I do."
"Well, good ol' boy, we want to thank you for helping to solve the case," Lestrade entered the room, trying desperately to ignore the tense atmosphere.
"Care to enlighten me as to what you're doing?"
together?") was the best decision either man had ever made.
Lestrade, Anderson, and Donovan all sat in the hospital waiting room. Although sixty-six percent of the present party wasn't big fans of the good doctor, and even lesser fans of his best friend, they knew John better than the rest of the force and were the designated hospital visitors.
“I do. I just figured things didn’t work out, dear,” she gave him a understanding expression, patting his hand. Sherlock got an exasperated look on his face.
"Excuse me, are you John Watson's husband?"
“You saying mutual orgasms,” John smirked.
“No, you hear it,” Sherlock said. “You typically respond by telling me to stop showing off.”
"I do not have the maturity of a five year old!"
“John!” Sherlock lifted his head to look at him. “You were screaming and then you wouldn’t wake up when I kept my distance and I had to stop it.”
“Well, it would have been, if someone had not so rudely interrupted,” Sherlock yawned, walking over to John. He rested his chin on the blonde’s head, closing his eyes and just resting there.
"I didn't get nicknamed Three Continents Watson for having a limited mind, Mycroft," John grinned devilishly. "After all, I was in the army for over a decade. There weren't always women around."
Lestrade chuckled. “Well thank you for not allowing that to happen.”
“You aren’t amusing!” Sherlock glared.
“Sherlock, you’re bleeding,” John said, concerned. “I hit you, didn’t I?”
“Now how did that case go from this week?” John asked.
“I notice I am not on that list. I suppose it’s because you never flirt with me,” John pretended to grumble, setting the biscuits Mrs. Hudson had sent up on the table before walking back in the room.
“And you’re curious,” John said, leaning back up against the counter. Lestrade looked at him, eyes a bit wide. “Oh, don’t worry, I don’t blame you. But it’s true, you wanted to see what kind of man would marry someone like Sherlock, and how different a genius like him must be in private.”
John cocked his eyebrow as he took out a knife. Sherlock tensed, but paused when John instead pressed it to his own hand. A deep red line appeared, but as Sherlock watched, it healed. Just like his did when they strapped him to the table.
“I think that statement was a bit redundant,” John teased, trying to lighten the mood.
"I'm gonna go to bed," he announced. Sherlock made a low humming noise. "Sherlock, did you even hear me?"
"I think both people on a team deserve awards," she shrugged. "You didn't answer the question."
John ignored the glare he received.
“Good morning, Sherlock,” Lestrade tried to hide his grin behind his hand.
“Who am I looking for?” Sherlock asked.
There was a gleam in Sherlock's eyes. John rolled his eyes, that cute little smile appearing.
"I'm sorry, sir. Now please, I really don't want to have you thrown out of here, but I'll do it. Sit, please," the doctor said again. Harry disappeared into John's room with a glare.
“He’s in the bedroom,” John said. “He was quite content to leave you on the doorstep.”
"But…you aren't
"I'm sorry to inform you, sir, but Captain Watson was shot while on duty," he said with a grave face. Sherlock paled, despite knowing this was not the first time either of them had been severely injured.
Having an infinite number of days made everyday life seem a lot more boring than knowing any day could be your last. Although many people strived to achieve immortality, there were a few who were actually born with it. No scientific explanation could be found, and by the time there were machines advanced enough to really do any research on it, the subjects who had been around for centuries had lost interest in the answer. They existed, and it was enough.
"Hello," came the voice of someone obviously just woken up.
"Who are you?" Anderson scoffed.
They walked quickly to each other. They locked eyes, just taking in the changes in the other's appearance for a minute before they found their foreheads touching. They both took a deep breath in as they took comfort in each other's presence. It meant being safe and secure after so long.
“So what’s going on?” Greg asked.
Lestrade was different. He was useful for access to crime scenes, yes, but he could also be clever himself at times. It was refreshing to see a capable detective besides himself. Sally Donovan was more intelligent than Anderson, but she could stand to make smarter decisions, especially relating to Anderson.
“Drugs? You want to give me drugs as a gift of friendship?” John scoffed. “I have spent hundreds of years in your presence, and I honestly cannot believe you right now.”
"Yes, John, good night," Sherlock snapped. John rolled his eyes. Some things never change. He turned away, sighing as he went. "John?"
“I...I am not used to these emotional interactions. Am I doing it wrong?” Sherlock asked. “Because you’re apologizing, but I’m the one feeling bad.”
Sherlock, whose mind had been solely focused on the puzzle at hand, snapped to attention.
"Consciously- about three minutes; subconsciously- likely since you didn't tell me to piss off," he admitted. "How long have you been willing to accept such…physical display of emotion?"
Mrs. Hudson giggled and clapped her hands together. “Oh, I love this. Young love is always such a whirlwind, isn’t it? But it does sound like you’ve known each other quite awhile.”
The silence remained in the waiting room until Harry walked out, early in the morning hours, to let them know John was stable and was being moved into a normal room, that they could meet him down there.
“Fifth or Sixth Crusade?” Sherlock asked. The man looked at him in shock.
Dr. White got the signatures she needed, splinted the foot, and got Sherlock set up with a pair of crutches.
"We had to see who you would marry! It's not as if you've shown any great interest in the average population," Lestrade smirked, the group all trying to look over John. Sherlock stepped in front of him so as to shield them from their judgmental eyes.
"My brilliance sets me apart from others; the skull just made me seem incapable of human interaction."
"Good," Sherlock responded with a grin. "If I weren't your arse, I would be so bored. And we all know what happens when I get bored."
That was the last intelligible conversation to be had for awhile.
"My older brother
“Then it runs in family groups, like physical traits,” Sherlock nodded. “My brother is like us as well.”
“We aren’t moving too quickly?” he asked the dark-haired man as Sherlock reached over to turn on the lamp so he could look down at John.
It didn't stop him from jumping in front of the bullet the second the man's finger flexed over the trigger.
"Greg, since our boyfriends are being so…
"I don't know. It just made you different." John rolled his eyes.
“None I was so invested in,” John said. “And no, you’re not doing it wrong.” John hugged him. Sherlock dropped the sheet so as to make it easier to hug him back.
~xxx~
“John,we have known each other since the thirteenth century. We have killed for one another and been injured for one another. We are legally married. So do I think deciding to engage in physical pleasure, and probably experiencing mutual orgasms with one another in the twenty-first century, is moving too quickly? No, I can’t say I do.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Baby Jesus?" Sherlock's nose scrunched.
“Normal people don’t put their bare arses on the table where we eat,” John said, refusing to giggle like he wanted to.
“John,” he said loudly. His friend only thrashed harder, whimpering. “John, they’re just nightmares. You need to wake up.”
"Doubtful," he said.
Ego autem confidebat. Amavi te, et promissa, et ego autem confidebat: I trusted you. I loved you, and you promised, and I trusted you
"I'm here to take you for your x-rays, Mr. Holmes," the technician said as she walked around him to wheel him out of the room.
Sherlock looked down at him through dark ashes, smiling a dangerous smile. “Well,” he said seductively, “is it working?”
“I hated those women. They didn’t deserve you.” Sherlock huffed.
"Why is it that it's
Sherlock went over to where John had put his clothes on and now leaned his head up against the wardrobe's door. He placed a hand on John's shoulder, pulling back when John tensed.
John did as he asked, looking curiously at Sherlock all the while.
John was thrashing in his bed, there were pillows on the floor, and the lamp was knocked to the side, staying on the table only because of its short chord. Sherlock fixed that first, before pausing by the side of the bed.
“Opium is a drug, Sherlock,” John sighed. “A mind-altering drug. Why would you, with such a bloody brilliant mind, want to smoke opium?”
"Mycroft, we'll meet you in the livingroom," Sherlock said, meeting his brother's eye. He knew it was obvious he was as confused at his husband's behaviour as his brother was. Mycroft nodded, walking out of the room and closing the door behind him.
“And I worry every time,” Sherlock glared. “I accepted long ago that there is a part of you that is a soldier and craves that life every few years, but that in no way makes our time apart easier on me or my nerves.”
She turned to John. "Can he not talk or understand me?"
“I’m good, thanks,” Lestrade said, watching as he put the kettle on. “So, is Sherlock here?”
Now, John remembered what it felt like to be shot. The horrid pain, and burning, and numbing coldness of shock that was more terrifying than the wound itself. He had been a soldier. He knew what weapons were capable of.
John knelt next to the chair, putting the pressure on his good leg.
"Alright, no pain medication," Dr. White gave in.
"He's an arse," she had insisted. "Who the hell does he think he is, waltzing in here and telling me who I am, what I've done, what I've been through, and telling me to go back to rehab?"
The guard turned around, and Sherlock was quick to take in the details. He was shorter than Sherlock, though most men at that time were. The guard had deep blue eyes, and he was a soldier that had obviously seen battle rather than just some of the rabble who volunteered to avoid really fighting.
Sherlock opted to give him a look rather than point out the obviousness of the question. “More than you could possibly imagine. It’s good not to worry about him anymore.”
"Admittedly smart as well," Mycroft tried not to cringe as John pulled Greg closer, rubbing on him in a way that seemed possessive, too damn possessive of something that
"No, no we really don't."
“If there is, I’ll take being high. Being happy is overrated if it doesn’t feel like this,” Sherlock said. “Seriously, John, I am doing you a favor. Me trying to share this with you is the biggest gift I can give you in this friendship.”
“A sword impaling your left shoulder tends to be,” The soldier nodded.
“We keep in touch. And I suppose I should tell you...The man she has been in contact with, the man who targeted her, he’s the Napoleon of blackmail,” Sherlock sat in his chair, looking concerned but excited.
“Fine, then I am an idiot. But I would be a bigger idiot if I stayed.” John went to his room, packed up his luggage, and hopped into a buggy, telling the driver to go to the bank, then he just rode on.
Mycroft stood with the posture of a person used to being the most powerful person in the room. He normally was, and that included now. He had agreed to go to this office Christmas party at his boyfriend's insistence. Surely, it wasn't the most Greg could have asked for, and Mycroft had Anthea push around his schedule so he could attend the little event. After all, he never took Greg to any of his work functions for fear that his relationship with the Detective Inspector would be used against him, not as a teasing aspect, but fearing they would genuinely threaten Greg's health and well-being to receive Mycroft's compliance. Mycroft was not prepared to make the choice between Greg and The Work, his heart and his brain, quite yet. He doubted he ever would be, and was thusly avoiding situations that may cause the necessity at all costs.
"Listen to yourself," John laughed at his best friend. The dark-haired detective gave his best glare and fell silent. He sat his chin on his fist, his elbow balanced on the arm rest. John thought of this as his Brooding Pose.
"Yes."
He and Mycroft locked eyes and came to the same conclusion, nodding briefly at one another, before storming up to the men grinding on each other on the dance floor.
"It'll be your welcome home present."
John snuggled up close.
Sherlock was captivated by the authority in John's voice, and his position on top of Sherlock allowed the doctor to be aware of just how interested his tone of voice made his husband.
“I don’t have a god,” The soldier said. “And if there is one, I would not follow one who insists men kill other men and children and rape women all for land they both find religious value in.”
“I didn’t realize he got around so much,” Lestrade said.
"Mmm, don't ask stupid questions," Sherlock hummed without an edge as he shifted his neck down, making his chin touch his chest as his doctor continued his ministrations.
"She gets to be here after she's been drinking- this alcoholic she-devil who doesn't give two shits about him- but I can't be let in? I live with him!" Sherlock was effectively livid.
"It's green."
(See the end of the chapter for
“John,” she smiled. “I am Martha Hudson. I’m the landlady here.”
"Who wants to spend ten minutes with the freak?" Sally muttered. Lestrade turned around to call her off, when John piped up.
By the 2010s, Sherlock went by his birth name once again, and John decided to go off and join the Army. He hadn't been active as soldier in some time and he missed the disciplined life style. Although Sherlock wouldn't admit it, he was a bit hurt by the development. But then, John was used to a life of action and their life had been relatively peaceful for the past decade. Sherlock kept his mouth shut while John went off, sent to Afghanistan, and told himself worrying was ridiculous. He was going to be fine. He always was, after all.
John handed her a cloth napkin from the table. “I understand, Debbie, please don’t cry.” He patted her hand gently. “We’ll do everything we can to get you some answers.” He smiled at her sympathetically.
John shoved his mobile into his pocket, he should have known. When he turned back around, the girl had gone. John let out a deep sigh, then hurried to finish his shopping. He had quite a few bags by the time he was done, and decided to take a cab home to Baker Street.
At John's silence, Mike slid into the seat opposite. "John? Mate? Is there anything I can do?" Mike was a good friend, they had been in medical training together before John joined the army. When John returned, injured and alone, Mike had helped him find work, and pulled him along to pub trivia nights and to watch football matches on the telly with his friends. Anything to get John out of the depressing bedsit where he suffered alone. John was grateful for Mike's jolly nature, and his concern put a half-smile on John's face.
That had to have been one of the longest work days ever. Their breakup was a popular topic of discussion, every time he came out of the exam room to drop off a file at the front desk the resulting silence was deafening. He tried to escape for a few minutes in the afternoon, only to be cornered by Mike at the café around the corner.
The look on Sherlock's face was at first blank and uncomprehending. Then his eyes seemed to take in every detail of the man and his car, and his nose scrunched up in a cute little wrinkle. "I'll thank you not to smoke while we're in your car, Bill, as I'm trying to quit. Successfully, so far. It's the drinking that keeps costing you your employment though, isn't it? I'm sure you wouldn't bite, this entrepreneurial enterprise is your last chance at keeping your family intact, you wouldn't do anything to jeopardize that. Your wife threatened to leave you and take the kids after your last boss let you go. The flexibility of working for yourself and the fear of losing your family seems to be working out, though, so you could tell her to be cautiously optimistic. My friend and I prefer to sit together, despite your feelings on Miss Daisy, whoever that may be." Sherlock sat back and pulled his mobile out of his pocket, considering the interaction over.
CHAPTER 3
Bring paper towels and bin bags - SH
John gave Sherlock a fond look. “Well, you’re holding up better than most, I’d reckon. You look like a model in that suit.” John smiled at the blush that his comment elicited on the detective’s angular cheeks. “I’m a lucky man, being picked up by a such a glamorous gentleman.”
I see you arrived safely,  brother. - MH
CHAPTER 5
"Your haircut and posture, as well as the neat appearance of your clothing all suggest a military background. RAMC is a logical deduction based on the fact that you are a doctor, which I had already confirmed. You were injured in the line of duty and sent home…your limp provides the evidence, I'm afraid. As well as the discomfort evident in your upper body and left hand…I'm going to say shot on the left side, possibly shoulder? Am I right so far?" Sherlock craved validation, and he was finding this exercise oddly satisfying.
"Amazing. That was amazing." John looked at Sherlock with a half-smile.
“Who’s Kath?” John asked, raising his eyebrows in interest.
"Did you do this? Did you decorate the flat for the holidays?" John turned in a circle, trying to take in all the changes. There were white fairy lights strung around the mirror and both windows, along with strands of fir garland. The skull looked quite jolly in a Santa hat, and there was a wreath of fir branches and colorful bows adorning the bull on the wall. He thought he even saw some mistletoe hanging in the doorway between the sitting room and the kitchen. The horrible stench from earlier had aired out (still noticeable, but not as overpowering) and there was a definite hint of...was that cinnamon?...in the air. He faced Sherlock again, and was touched at the almost childlike shyness in his eyes.
“I ordered most gifts online this year, however I think I’d like to do something more personal for Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock said. John nodded, “She does put up with a lot from both of us...mostly you.” he chuckled. “How well do you know her? I know she enjoys baking and watching afternoon telly, that’s about it”. John felt a little guilty, Mrs. Hudson was amazing and he should make an effort to spend more time with her. New Years’ resolution, he thought.
"Excuse me?"
By the end of John’s disclosure, Dad’s eyes were wet with unshed tears. “That’s wonderful, John. Wonderful news.” Dad wiped at his eyes, sitting back in his chair. “Just, please...please be gentle with him?” Dad shook his head, rubbing at the back of his neck. “He’s a lot like me, you see. He may appear to be tough...but his heart...John, his heart is…” Dad hesitated.
Mummy Holmes had the same height, otherworldly eyes and high cheekbones as her son, but that’s where the similarities ended. She had round, rosy cheeks and a soft, huggable body, which was currently wrapped in a festive holiday apron.
“Well, I waited until the next day. When I still hadn’t heard from him or been able to get in touch, I thought maybe I should call the police. You know how, on TV, they always say that you have to wait 24 hours before someone can be reported missing?” She raised her eyes to meet John’s, a small tear forming and running slowly down her cheek. “I’m at a loss, I just don’t know where he could be!” She let out a short, hiccupping sob.
"You need to keep your voice down, unless you fancy meeting the security detail at Miami International." John spoke in his best bedside manner, trying to calm Sherlocks' nerves. "Why don't you do your deducing thing and tell me about myself?" John felt that he was a pretty reserved guy, and he was interested to see how much Sherlock could read from him in such a short time.
-You selfish bastard! You are such a fucking machine, John. I hope you get some help, you clearly need it.
John woke up alone this morning, no sign that the detective had even been in the bed. Sherlock had left him a note on the sitting room desk, along with a key card for the room. The detective would text him where to meet up later, John’s belongings should be delivered soon, and he was to order room service and take advantage of hotel amenities as much as possible, to “stick Mycroft with the bill”. John had smirked, then promptly ordered himself blueberry pancakes.
John smiled brightly at his friend. "That sounds better than slogging about on my own, and you can help me choose gifts for your Mum and Dad! I never know what to give anyone." John settled back in his chair and closed his eyes, his feet kicked out to take advantage of the heat from the fireplace.
"Are you joking? It's brilliant! I can't believe you did all this while I was napping right here!" John was shocked with his flatmates' actions, for once in a good way. "Would you be up for going out to eat tonight? Maybe we could get in a bit of gift shopping as well." John turned towards the stairs, ready to head up to his room. “I’ll just take a quick shower, yeah? Then we can head out.” He stopped and smiled over his shoulder at his friend. “This is really great, Sherlock. Really. Thanks.” He took the stairs two at a time, more energetic than he had been when he first came home.
“I didn’t rent this, John - I bought it. Well, Mycroft bought it, he just doesn’t know it yet.” Sherlock smirked as he eased out to join the traffic on Biscayne Boulevard.
"Would you be able to reach that package of Ryvita for me? Of course the only one left is pushed all the way back, and I need a step stool on a good day." The girl smiled, apologetic and charming.
John looked up at Sherlock’s profile. He’s opening up to me, I can’t mess this up - please don’t let me mess this up, he thought. “We seem to be dancing around the edges of a... change... in our relationship,” John stumbled a bit finding his words. “But I need to know, Sherlock, Do you have...I mean, umm...Do you have...romantic feelings...for me?” John asked in that low, serious tone of voice he used when he was being, well, serious.
Sherlock stopped walking, turning to face John in the glow of the village Christmas tree. He took a few moments to answer, studying John’s upturned face, which was so familiar to him. Data from the experiments points to John responding positively to this declaration...so why am I so scared? Courage, Holmes.
"No, John. It's fine. It's all fine." Sherlock gave him a small half-smile. "It was no trouble. Were you able to rest a bit?" Not long ago, Sherlock had been counting the minutes (extremely impatiently) until he could get off this uncomfortable flight. Now he found himself regretting that his time with John was coming to an end.
The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States had invited John, along with his colleague and friend, Mike Stamford, to present a joint paper at their annual conference. This year the conference was being held in Miami, Florida, and John had known as soon as Mary saw the brochure that she would push for them to go. He couldn't blame her, the fall weather was as chilly and gray as ever. A bit of sun and sand would go a long way to restoring their moods heading into the holiday season.
“Jesus, Sherlock. Not only does your Mum think we slept together, she probably thinks I wet the bed because of my nightmares!” John buried his head under the remaining pillows in embarrassment as understanding finally dawned on Sherlock’s face.
Suddenly the plane went into a nose dive, the oxygen masks dropping from the ceiling. People were screaming…there was an explosion from somewhere behind him. John felt his entire body clench in preparation for impact, momentarily forgetting that he would sustain less injuries if he could stay relaxed.
“I know, John.” Sherlock answered eventually, squeezing John and nuzzling his hair. “I had deduced as much, you see.” He smirked down at his blogger. “Now, how do you suggest we release this puppy on the household?”
Sorry, mate, I’ve got plans with Sherlock...
John shook his head in disbelief. “Wouldn’t it have made more sense to rent? What are you gonna do with this when you go back to London?” John fastened his seatbelt as Sherlock began to weave quickly in between the lines of cars.
“Now, I’m afraid, I’ll need a bit more background, Mum. What has this Kath done to you?” John tried valiantly to compose himself. It was actually Dad who answered, though.
“Merry Christmas, John.” Sherlock whispered. He felt rather than saw John’s answering smile.
"Here we are, sir. Excuse me ma'am, this gentleman will be sitting in the middle seat for the remainder of the flight. Would you mind standing so that he can get by? Thank you so much." The older lady in the aisle seat grumbled a bit under her breath, but stood so that the man could be seated next to John. The attendant leaned down in an attempt to keep the conversation private. "Now, we won't be having any more trouble out of you, will we, Mr. Holmes? Good. I really don't want to have to report you to security when we land. Please just try and keep quiet for the remainder of our flight." The flight attendant stood up, pulling the bottom of her jacket to straighten it. She smiled tightly at John, then turned and headed back to Business Class.
"How in the world...never mind. Yes, also correct." John rubbed his hand through the short, sandy strands on his head.
"Piss off." Sherlock answered him, his face carefully blank.
5:53 PM
"Yeah? What's up?"
John was speechless. He set the invitation down, stood up from his chair, and wrapped his arms around his friend in a tight hug. Sherlock was surprised at the contact, and just stood there for a moment before cautiously patting John's back with his hands. John finally pulled back, but his hands remained on Sherlock's arms in a tight grip.
John smiled as he tucked his mobile in his pocket. He grabbed his wallet and his sunglasses, then pulled on his trainers and headed out.
-Ask Mrs. Hudson to make you some. I'm stopping at Tesco's, what do we need?
Mummy reappeared, gently pulling Daddy Holmes along by the hand. He was a handsome gentleman - lean and lanky with keen eyes and an abundant shock of white hair. He was dressed in a thick cardigan and worn trousers, his feet sporting brown suede reindeer slippers, complete with antlers.
On my way now, why?
“Milk, no sugar.” Sherlock replied quickly, earning a knowing glance from both Mummy and Dad.
CHAPTER 1
-What can I say or do to change this John? You aren't really moving out are you??
“No, I didn’t.” She replied in a defensive tone. “And when I got home, it was obvious he hadn’t been there since Saturday at least, that’s when the maid comes in. Timmy has always been messy, and there were no dishes, the bed was made, no clothes on the floor.” She twisted her hands in her lap. “I tried calling him, then some of his friends. No one had seen him all weekend.” She dropped her gaze to her hands, again twisting her rings around her thin finger.
John quickly hopped out and took the front seat while Sherlock sulked in the back. He smiled apologetically at Bill. Showing the driver his phone, they had a short discussion about their destination. The next ten minutes passed in an awkward silence.
"Look. We're both exhausted. I know the idea of getting on a flight is making you nervous, but just think how wonderful it will be tomorrow night, drinking frozen cocktails on a warm beach? You don't have to present the paper until Tuesday, and Mike is counting on you. Can't you just take a Xanax and sleep on the flight?" Mary turned her back to him, her cheeks turning pink from the steam.
When it appeared there were no gifts left to unwrap, Sherlock stood up. “If you would excuse me, I believe I left a few gifts upstairs.” He tripped over a pile of wrapping paper and ribbon, catching himself and recovering his balance gracefully.
"Excellent suggestion, John. This is my first visit to Miami, I am willing to cede control to you in choosing our destination." Sherlock held the room door open and ushered John out into the hallway.
Have you been playing with the puppy this whole time?
Someone was grabbing at his arm, shaking his bad shoulder. He tried to shake them off, getting annoyed. "John!" a voice cried out. He tried to twist around in his seat to see what was happening. Again, "John!" the voice called. His stomach dropped out of his body, and the feeling of falling was overwhelming. This was it, he braced himself…
John was relieved when they pulled into the circular drive in front of the Thompson Miami Beach Hotel. He settled the charge with Bill and hopped out into the humid evening. John held the rear door open for Sherlock, who slid out gracefully, joining him on the tiled driveway. The sulk was still evident in the pout of Sherlock’s lips. John had the sudden urge to lean forward and kiss that pout away - it took everything in him to hold back. Instead, he took the detective's hand in his and led him up the steps into the lobby, studiously ignoring Sherlock's jolt of surprise.
John moved to follow him, catching a healthy glimpse of a very firm, rounded backside before Sherlock disappeared into the bathroom and shut the door. Now John was tired, hungry, frustrated and...god help him...aroused. “Sherlock! You didn’t let your parents know we would be late?” John raised his fist, banging on the door that separated the men.
"Sherlock?" John was leaning towards him, looking concerned. "You okay?"
Then let's hope you won't continue to behave like one. - MH
“Oh, I do wish Myc had been able to join us. I was holding out hope that he might just pop in, unexpectedly.” Mummy sounded quite disappointed.
I’ll meet you Monday morning at the hotel, we can go over the presentation. What’s our time slot again?
“He asked me how long I’d be gone, and I told him it would only be a few days. I was planning to be back for a charity luncheon my friend Nora was hosting that Wednesday.” She began tapping her foot, which clattered loudly on the tiled floor. “He didn’t even kiss me goodbye, just sort of patted my arm before going back in the house.” She rubbed both palms on the arms of her chair before taking another sip of tea.
“That’s perfect, John. We make the perfect team.” The detective leaned over, kissing his doctor soundly. “Merry Christmas, John”.
Snow had just begun to fall. Sherlock reached up, running his thumb over John’s cheek, collecting snowflakes. “I love you, John.” As he had hoped, he saw the love and desire he felt for this wonderful man mirrored in John’s eyes, in the curve of his lips. “I must confess to you that my understanding of romance and relationships is limited at best...but what I know is how you make me feel complete when we are together. How I feel empty when we are apart. I...John, I…” Sherlock stopped speaking, because John had lifted his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders and was pulling him close.
Sherlock glanced sideways at John, taking in his posture and expression. "You are handling your fear admirably, Dr. Watson." John's eyes flew open, he turned to Sherlock in surprise.
Sherlock followed the driver out of the airport - straight into hell. At least, this must be what hell feels like, he thought. This humidity is going to wreak havoc on my hair. As he settled into the backseat of the car,  he took a last look at the teeming arrivals terminal. He scanned his eyes over the lines waiting for a taxi, hoping to catch a glimpse of sandy blonde hair. It was too dark and crowded to make out individuals, even if they did possess the brightest blue eyes and warmest smile that Sherlock had ever encountered.
The morning was filled with thoughtful gifts being unwrapped and appreciated. Mummy laughed out loud when she lifted her new pie dish from the box. “Oh, boys...that is ridiculous! I love it!” She exclaimed.
John took his hand lightly. “Why would I mind? It means you’ve been thinking of me.” He whispered softly, leaning in and brushing Sherlock’s cheek with his lips. He enjoyed watching Sherlock’s face go from a light flush to a bright crimson. Mummy and Dad were observing them fondly, holding hands themselves.
Sherlock nodded his encouragement. “Technically, you are correct. But it’s a gift for both of us, actually.” Sherlock smiled at John’s raised eyebrows. “It’s a case, John!” he said, gleefully.
He raised his eyes to meet hers. "You've been so distant. I need more than this, John. I hate to tell you like this." She hesitates, looks away.  Hugging her arms about herself again, she looks up almost defensively. "I've been seeing someone else, John. I didn't know how to tell you…"
Dad grasped it, the two men shaking hands in understanding. “Merry Christmas, John.”
“Thank you, sir. Cheers!” John accepted the drink and took a seat on the sofa facing the fireplace. He took a grateful sip of the honeyed liquid. “Oooh, that is good.” He relaxed back against the cushions.
CHAPTER 4
“There’s no way we’re wrapping him, Sherlock. Don’t even think about it!” John looked at the puppy sceptically. “How do you propose getting him home?” Shopping with Sherlock had been a trial, and John was tired. Sherlock decided to forgive him for being a bit grumpy.
“Only if you promise not to drug me with it” joked John, giggling at Sherlock’s offended expression. “No thanks, but maybe later...I’m still stuffed from those sausages, it feels good to walk around”. He leaned a bit into Sherlock’s side. “Now, who do you still need to shop for? I’ve sent a voucher to Harry, but I don’t have any idea what to do for Mrs. Hudson, or your parents”.  John looked up at the sky as they walked, enjoying the way the lights glimmered. “What about Mycroft?” John asked. “Will he be gracing us with his presence?” John swerved to avoid a group of running children, and found himself grabbing Sherlock’s arm to steady himself. The wool of Sherlock’s long coat felt damp from the chilly mist in the air.
“Umm. John.” Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, considering the most effective method to address John’s discomfort. He put his hands in his pockets, then leaned in...bending forward just a bit...to capture John’s lips with his own. He remained pressed to John’s face for a few moments, analyzing the kiss and John’s reaction. This is drier than expected. John smells nice. He isn’t doing anything. Why isn’t he doing anything?
“Hmm. Quite.” Sherlock agreed.
-On my way home, roof collapsed at the clinic. Why?
“Ah, the feud with...what’s her name...Kath? Finally over, then?” Sherlock asked with an impertinent grin.
“Sure, to be continued.” John felt deflated. Working up the courage to be open about feelings takes a lot out of a man, he thought. “I’m asking to see baby photos, Sherlock. Don’t think I won’t!” John giggled at the horror-stricken look on Sherlock’s face.
“Well now, I was leaving to visit my Mama, she lives up in Charleston” she drawled. “Timmy never wants to go, he always has ‘work to do’ which he thinks I don’t know is code for playing golf with his friends.” She sat back from the table, crossing her legs as she sipped her tea. “I didn’t even bother asking him, you know, because he would have said no anyway.”
The sweetness of the gesture made John’s heart skip a beat. John leaned to the side, pressing his shoulder to Sherlock’s. “Thanks...thank you, Sherlock.” John cleared his throat. Now is as good a time as any, he thought. “So listen...Sherlock…”, John began.
Debbie had, by this time, recovered the use of her voice. “It’s my girlfriend, you complete and utter ass!” She screamed at him. John was unsurprised to see her pick up her glass and toss her unfinished tea in Sherlock’s face. “Get out of here, or I’m calling the actual police on grounds of harassment!” She was shaking with indignation.
John turned from the shelf of tinned soups he was perusing to find an attractive girl trying to get his attention. He smiled at her questioningly, "Yes?"
John's reaction to Sherlock dissecting his break-up was interrupted by the Fasten Seatbelt sign flashing to life above his head. A crackly voice over the loudspeaker announced, "Cabin crew, please be seated."
“Our Sherlock...he’s always been headstrong. Maybe a bit quieter in some ways...and in other ways…” Dad hesitated, searching for words. “I guess what I’m getting at is that... Katy and I can see how much you mean to our son.” Dad picked up his drink and took a long swallow. “We’re so happy you’ve found each other...you seem good for each other. But…”
John’s anxiety at meeting Sherlock’s family was forgotten for the moment, but he wasn’t exactly comfortable having this conversation on their doorstep.
Sherlock reached across John to grab a gingerbread cookie. “A busybody from the village, John. My mother’s arch nemesis, if you will.” John’s mouth dropped open, unsure how to respond.
Sherlock was right...as usual, thought John. The tiny pup slept quietly all the way back to the cottage. If the Holmes parents thought it strange that Sherlock wore his coat upstairs, they decided to ignore it.
Bloody hell, how was he supposed to relax? He was on a plane about to crash in the middle of the Atlantic ocean for god's sake!
John reached up (having to really stretch, himself), and pulled the box down for the stranger. He handed it to her with a friendly smile. "Here you go."
“I did, John, I thought that’s what people did when they care about each other.” Sherlock stepped away and tilted his head. “Was I wrong to do that?” he asked.
John. Hurry. This smell will not go undetected. - SH
"Jesus, John. Now? You want to start this now?" Mary set her mug down forcefully, tea sloshing out onto the counter. She stared at the small puddle for a moment before grabbing a towel to wipe it up with. A deep breath through her nose, exhaling in a rush. "Well, shit." She sighed, pulling out the chair opposite, and collapsed into it. "You need to talk to someone, John. Someone who can help you. I… I thought that I might be enough, that what we had together would be enough. But you're suffering, …John, look at me please."
John grabs the orange poolside towel from the sun lounge, aggressively drying himself before spreading it out on the chair. He feels pleasantly worked out, if still a bit tired. They had returned to Sherlock’s suite sometime around 3 AM, both stripping down to pants and collapsing into bed - too tired to do anything but sleep.
Seeing as it was late on Christmas Eve, the shop selection for suitable gifts was minimal. After some spirited bickering and a few silent sulks, Sherlock and John finally agreed on a gift for Dad. Inside the final shop, there was a basket by the door with a sign stating “Free to a Good Home”. Sherlock reached into the basket, gently lifting out a tiny black puppy.
Mummy settled into the front seat next to Dad. “But what have you been up to? Dad and I have been waiting here for almost an hour.”
The staircase turned on a landing halfway up, eventually ending at a wide hallway, doors on either side. Sherlock turned to the right and walked to the end. “This door at the end is the washroom we’ll be sharing, John. I usually take the room here at the back, I like the view.” Sherlock pushed open the door to reveal a cozy room with a sloped ceiling. It had a dormer window and window seat piled high with cushions. The walls were a pleasant shade of sage green, which complemented the nature theme of artwork on the walls. The bed took up most of the space, looking crisp and inviting covered with a puffy white duvet and pillows. One whole wall was built in bookcases, filled to bursting with all kinds of titles.
Sherlock set his glass down, leaning forward a bit. “Thank you, Debbie, you may call me Mr. Holmes, and this is my colleague, Dr. John Watson.” His long hand gestured vaguely in John’s direction. “We’re actually here on behalf of Martha Hudson. We believe you may have information that will benefit her case, as well as that of your missing husband.” He took another sip of tea, clearly savoring the overly sweet beverage. “Would you tell us about the last time you saw or spoke to your husband?” he asked.
Mummy turned to Sherlock with a scolding expression. “Daddy’s been beside himself, wondering if you were actually coming, Sherlock. Shame on you.” Sherlock arranged his facial features to look properly chagrined. He took her free hand, giving it a squeeze. “My apologies, Mummy. We had a case, it was unavoidable.”
"Sherlock! I'm glad you found something to do, but please tell me why couldn't you have opened a window in here? This smell is obnoxious!" John stalked over to the window and pushed it open with a bit more force than strictly necessary.
John waited for Mike’s reply, feeling guilty for ditching his friend.
“Sherlock! What are you up to, standing out here?” Mummy pulled him into a hug. Releasing him, she turned her attention to John. “And you must be Sherlock’s John! Welcome, welcome...come inside! It’s too cold to be dawdling on the steps...come in, come in.” She shooed them both through the door.
John’s mouth dropped open in surprise.
He took a moment to appreciate the sight of John spread across his bed, his sweater pulled up to reveal a tempting strip of skin. It was regrettable that their first night as a couple had been spent wrangling his father’s Christmas gift, rather than each other.
John sucked in a breath, and his knuckles turning white as he tightened his grip on his thighs.
Sherlock calmly wiped the tea from his face with his napkin, then stood. “Girlfriend! Ugh, there’s always something.” He shook his head, clearly frustrated. “Come along, John. Work to do.” He walked towards the parking area.
She knew that one would get under my skin, he thought. She's probably gone for drinks with some of the girls from the clinic.
John pulled his mobile from his pocket, thumbing through to his email. “Right. Yes, actually, my friend responded...hold on.” John took a moment to read Bill’s response and send him a quick thanks. “So we’ll need to get in touch with a guy he knows near here...should be able to come up with something, for the right price.” John rubbed his hand down his thigh. “Umm, about that…”
Sherlock eyed John over the top of his mug. "Actually, we have other plans." Sherlock turned, carrying his mug back to the sitting room. He set his tea on the mantel, then retrieved an envelope from underneath the skull. He held it tightly for a moment, then thrust it in John's direction.
His knuckles turned white as he gripped the armrest. The plane was shaking and making horrible screeching sounds. He had never been this scared in his life, the panic around him was palpable. John Watson was struggling to maintain a calm façade, as a doctor he needed to be able to assist the flight crew if he could. He reminded himself that this was hardly the worst situation he had ever been in. As a Captain in the RAMC, he had faced much worse.
"Don't be ridiculous, John" Sherlock scoffed. "You are my family. Of course I want you there."
Mary rolled over and swung her legs off the opposite side of the bed. "I'm going to pretend you didn't just say that. I need a shower. Make us a cuppa?" her frustration with being awake so early was apparent, and she clearly didn't want to address the convention issue without her morning brew. John watched her blond curls disappear around the door to the loo. He roused himself up from the floor with the sound of the shower starting.
Where are you??
John sighed, hunching his shoulders uncomfortably. "Sorry, Mary. I don't know why it's been so bad, I guess this trip is bothering me more than I thought. I really think I should bow out of this conference, Mike can handle the presentation without me. I haven't been on a plane since the crash outside of Kandahar, you know that." John rubbed his eyes roughly, then slumped forward, wrapping his arms around his bent knees. "I know you've been looking forward to a holiday, but I really would rather give it a miss. Maybe you could go without me?" He questioned.
John took a bite of a spinach and feta croqueta, chewing thoughtfully. He swallowed, feeling Sherlock's gaze locked on his throat. Their eyes met and John felt the burning spark of attraction jump so clearly between them that it may as well have jumped out of the non-existent fire and landed on his skin. He swallowed again, and tried to rein in his errant thoughts. Focus! He mentally slapped himself, and made a valiant effort to hold up his end of their conversation.
"Look, we don't have to have a party, it was just a thought," said John. "I just haven't got any plans yet, myself." He walked back towards the kitchen, it was past time for a nice cup of tea.
John's smirk turned into a full blown grin. Sherlock was exasperating at times, but this childish side of him was really quite amusing.

“Not at all, John, don’t you worry yourself!” Mummy said briskly but sympathetically. “Now, let’s get down to the kitchen for some breakfast, why don’t we?” Mummy began to step into the room, then seemed to think better of it. “And Sherlock, bring down any laundry you might have, alright? I’ll throw a load in and have it back to you this afternoon.” She turned to leave. “See you both downstairs!”
Sherlock smirked. "I'm not in the habit of taking a holiday - one would need "proper" employment for it to qualify as a holiday." He put a disdainful emphasis on the word holiday, as if anyone who needed a holiday should be ashamed of themselves.
John settled back in his seat, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re a brilliant madman, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll take your word for it.” John looked out the window, trying to keep track of the turns. “So...where are we going?” he asked.
“Mrs. Ayers, I want to thank you for your honesty.” Her mouth snapped shut, her cheeks started to redden in outrage. Sherlock continued. “Not out loud, of course, but in your body language.” Sherlock stood and began circling the table as he shared his deductions with his captive audience.
Just then, the door swung open, spilling out sunlight and a perfectly put together detective. Sherlock was dressed in his dark grey suit pants and a pale blue Oxford shirt, with the top button left undone and the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His curls had been tamed and he actually appeared well rested for once. “Morning, Mrs. Hudson!” He called as he swept through the kitchen. “Ah, John! I’m glad you’re up. We have much to do today. Have you eaten?” Sherlock picked up the paper from the desk and promptly collapsed into his chair. Mrs. Hudson followed him into the room, “Oh my! The decorations look wonderful!” she exclaimed. “So festive!”
“Oh, just go! Get out of here!” Debbie collapsed in her chair in a huff. “You’re the ones who’ll need luck!”
He was in love with John Watson.
“Well, it’s flat, about the size of that envelope you had delivered from Mycroft...oh no, is this a gift from Mycroft?!” John pulled a face. He undid the paper, pulling out a thick manila folder.
John hunched over the table, cradling his mug between his hands. The warmth was starting to become too much, feeling almost like his fingers were burning. He closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath, holding it for a moment, before slowly letting it escape. He was so exhausted, not just from lack of sleep. "Why is this so hard, Mary? Why does it all feel so hard?" He clenched his hands on the table, his frustration clear.
Donovan wasn't about to let it go, though.
how weak John Watson came to the Holmes man, but you see, John has this problem- he sees, yes, but he does not
"I did. Barely. But I managed it before the sniper got me."
“Wow,” Lestrade said, eyes wide.
"Goodbye, John." He hung up the phone, still grinning. He looked up to see Lestrade staring at him. "Don't you have a murder to investigate?"
“I am not precious! I am a genius who is quite capable of controlling my body’s resp-EEEE! JOHN!”
"Hello," the doctor stepped into the room. She was young, in her late twenties, with brown hair pulled back and an easy smile on her face. "How are we?"
"I would disagree."
The screaming always disconcerted Sherlock.
"Where is he? Where is John?"
"Apparently, these are our
It was a young blonde woman. She was on the ground, bullet hole in the center of the forehead.
“Try it, John,” he held it out.
"Murderous milk man," John winked.
"You evil, clever man," Mycroft shook his head, planted his lips to Greg's firmly. "
“Imagine that over and over again, only you don’t know these men. And they can be young, or old, innocent or guilty, but you don’t know. You just shoot. And then add in the men on your own side that you can’t save, despite being a doctor, and their only hope, and there’s just no way for you to, and the look in their eyes when they realize what’s going to happen to them...And this isn’t the first war I’ve been in. It’s horrible. And every time I sleep I see it over and over and over again. It’s like I’m back there…” John stopped, looking shocked, before he started laughing.
Translations for the Latin are in the notes at the end. If it's not perfect, I'm sorry! I really don't speak the language.
"Is the great, cold, Sherlock Holmes actually in love?" she asked.
“Ahh,” Greg said. “Is Sherlock in a fit?”
“That shouldn’t have sounded sexy,” John shook his head.
"John is hardly the average population!" Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“John,” Sherlock chuckled. “I’ve said it before.”
“Not a dom...no,” she shook her head, “I’ve got a feeling you could be though. Hands and callouses like that? You’re familiar with riding crops. You’ve certainly got the muscle tone that says you don’t hold back with them either. My bet is that you just aren’t using them properly.”
He walked back over, giving the man he adored a proper kiss.
The pause was fairly heavy.
John reacted by lashing out at him. He planted a few good punches while Sherlock worked on getting his legs pinned by his. His arms were harder, but he eventually got a good point of leverage. Sherlock had to focus on putting his weight on key pressure areas to keep John from moving.
“The cleaning lady found the body, says that her employer is out of town on business,” Lestrade explained.
