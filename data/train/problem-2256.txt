“Yes. He claimed to have found the proof confirming that the Mona Lisa portrait has indeed been partly based on another portrait. The one of Leonardo’s favourite apprentice, rumoured to have been his lover as well.”
To his great surprise and relief, he found himself telling her everything, from their first “meeting” at the Honeybee to the text he has sent earlier.
Once more unto the breach, then, he thought.
"Next time."
“You have questions,” he whispered.
He fought the impulse of screaming that yes, of course, why would he leave behind the man whose company he cherished and desired above everyone’s else?
Back instinctively arched against Sherlock’s hand stroking him along his spine, fingers grazing his jeans’ waistband – how he wanted that hand to go lower,
No, wait, his mind screamed at him. Think about it for a minute – that’s not logical! Why would they wait so long before getting in touch with him?
A memory, clad in Sherlock's voice, stirred through his mind.
Sherlock smiled without any restraint. He must look like a bloody fool, but right now he didn’t care.
Taking up the gauntlet every time it was thrown into his face.
“I’m sure I would know soon enough everything which matters about you. At least if you accept.”
And even more important – someone appreciating what he saw.
Slipping in the crack of his arse, teasing him with their bold stroke.
John’s blush didn’t abate afterwards for five minutes.
At least if I don’t fall asleep, she thought with a yawn.
I can hear your voice in my ear, smell your warm breath on my skin. Feel the imprint of your hand on the nape of my neck.
John sat down on the one of the garden’s benches, completely dazed. Dave’s explanation has left him mouth open, his throat suddenly dry. It couldn’t be true. Sherlock didn’t care about feelings. He wouldn’t do… something like that.
“Absolutely sure, Mrs Hudson,” he hastened to interrupt her. “I’m afraid you’re stuck here for the next two weeks. And that’s a minimum, mind you.”
There’s a line between being cautious and cruel, after all. Besides, which kind of person could say this to someone whose pet has just died? What a load of bullshit.
He suddenly stopped.
Sherlock felt a mirthless smile blooming on his lips as he looked in the small camera lens half-hidden in the box’s compact body.
He felt his muscles tightening around Sherlock’s cock.
Why has he done that?
Arousal.
“When what?” John asked, looking at him, a soft concern shining in his eyes.
As the last sobs tore out from his chest, as the humiliating memories of what has happened today at
“Yes, Sherlock. Yes.”
TW - Homophobic behaviour and slurs.
She was quite as tall as him and the way she carefully pronounced the words suggested it has been some time since she has had the opportunity to speak English. However, it was obvious she has received a sound education abroad – she might have got into Oxford. It would explain the connection between her and Mycroft, at any rate.
Thoughts which were brought to a crashing halt when he glanced up at John, who was obviously waiting for him while fiddling around with something in his pocket.
Nobody seemed to pay attention to the detective.
She couldn’t help feeling a surge of vindictive satisfaction.
And before he could utter a single word, she turned on her heel, snatching her handbag in the process, swaggered to the office’s door and opened it with a bang.
A study in frustration... but not for long :)
She clenched her fists, struggling to keep her dwindling self-control.
He muffled the little voice in his mind, which sounded a lot like Harry’s, trying to turn him into a doubting Thomas about everything Sherlock has told him and he simply let himself falling under the spell of this night.
“But after all, neither am I.”
“Right. Thanks, anyway.”
“And when I finally look my fill, I will order you to lie on your front. I will put myself between your legs, my hands will stroke your ass. I will spread you open and I will rim you until you’re crying and begging for release.”
“But I can’t stay like this!” she wailed. “I’m not some cripple who need to be helped every time she wants to do something!”
Acting rashly was not really his strong suit but in this case, Sherlock found he couldn’t resist. He replied to “John”
Sherlock kept one of John’s hands in his, refusing to let it go, and was rewarded with a bright smile. It felt wonderful to finally be allowed all these little gestures, displays of affection he wasn’t even aware he has longed to do.
“Sprained ankle?” A light she knew very well suddenly shone in his eyes. “Now
Who knew John de la fontaine's fables could be used to seduce someone?
Time to bite the bullet.
talk to you…”
Already incensed by her curt dismissal, John saw red. He leaped to his feet, ready to give a piece of his mind, when he heard right behind him “Is there a problem here?”
It couldn’t stop his heart from pounding in his chest as he tried to control himself, from his regular pace to the bored, indifferent expression on his face. For the hundredth time since Lestrade has spoken to him about his suspicion, John wondered if he was being watched over.
He laboriously typed [
Goodness. The very idea of doing this with Sherlock…
Proposing a date.
“Of course not. It’s a dream.”
John’s self-control definitely lost.
He didn’t dare voicing the question buzzing in his mind –
She has plastered a smile on her face – she had to keep up appearances after all – but inside she was fuming.
He saw the moment it all clicked into place.
However, he had no time to rekindle the fragile flame of hope. If the young stranger he has encountered in the garden could be trusted, if Lestrade’s gut feeling was correct, then Sherlock was in danger.
Sherlock frowned.
He has come here as a last resort, desperately hoping for some sign, some clue that Sherlock was indeed alive.
You knew then that joy and happiness might wait a very long time to find you, bursting into bloom when you least expected it.
“Thanks. Seriously, John, what’s the problem?”
“In that case,” he replied, pulling a slight booklet out of his pocket, “how come he isn’t mentioned in the document here?”
male in front of him.
Dejected, Joan turned her head away.
His phone suddenly let out a few thrills, bringing John back to reality. He has set the alarm on six pm to give himself the necessary time to get ready.
Her lover rolled her eyes, turned to her.
the silent treatment.
Molly frowned, aware that the speed-dating séance which has looked so fun earlier did little to arouse her interest now. She glanced at the few stragglers, who hastened to find their place again around their tables, hoping to find Irene, when she heard behind her
A good question, he mused. Who was he, really? A few answers popped in his mind.
“Fuck me!”
John’s left hand was stroking his ribs through his shirt, slowly dropping lower.
“You don’t understand.”
“Has anyone told you, Sherlock Holmes, you’re a dangerous man?”
He stood there, panting for breath, a single thought running through his head.
“Okay, you bastards, I got them… but don’t get used to it!”
“Why didn’t you tell me? Was it so hard to dial my number and let me know where you were?”
“Anything, Sherlock, please…”
Sherlock was grinning like the great prat he was, enjoying without a doubt his discomfiture. John decided that he was going to retaliate as soon as possible. After all, all was fair in love and war.
John suddenly snapped back to reality, blinking at Sherlock who was standing in front of him, hands on his hips, an irritated expression on his face.
Weeks have passed and I’m still waiting for you. For your step in the stairs, for your smile, for your voice saying…
Not her. Not her Sherlock.
– that, in his situation, any other guy – or woman for that matter – would have reacted differently. They wouldn’t have followed Sherlock, they wouldn’t even have set foot inside the building. They would have recoiled in front of this madman covered in blood, hiding their feelings with more or less discretion before fleeing, blocking his number afterwards on their phone and forgetting this whole disaster of a date.
“You’re going, then?” Sherlock asked in his best “I really don’t care” voice.
“You’re sure you don’t want to try your luck with the looker over there?” Lestrade whispered in his ear, giving John a nudge for the third time since he has entered the pub.
He was proud of what he has achieved in two months’ time.
spot for a lovely, completely handsome, devastatingly gorgeous individual working for the British government…”
For sole answer, Sherlock lightly swatted him on his arse.
Ladies and gentlemen - welcome Irene, Cockcblocker extraordinaire! :-)
“… restructured the truth a little bit. Nothing major, mind you.”
It was completely absurd and crazy, he should have been panicking instead of laughing his head off with the sister he has just seen again after years but it felt much too good to stop right now. It seemed to John that months of silence, years of agonizing over what he was, what he wanted were crumbling to dust just before his eyes.
The very idea of his friend declaring his love to him was completely ridiculous. Even more so by offering him flowers.
Sherlock didn’t waste time, cupping John’s arse in his hands, squeezing his flesh, kissing and licking with a fervour which fuelled even more John’s arousal.
He stared at it, open-mouthed, before feeling his lips quirking up in a dopy grin.
“Maybe.”
Mycroft sighed. He had no other choice but to look elsewhere – but where exactly? One thing was sure – he would never stop looking for Sherlock.
“What?”
John was already opening his mouth to ask Sherlock to help him, not willing to be left behind, but Sherlock beat him to it, leaning down and lending him a hand.
The meaty, filthy sounds echoed in the room, punctuated by John’s whimpers.
He took a step forward.
She developed a hopeless crush on Sherlock, admiring his rude boldness and cherishing the few moments when he dropped his guard, revealing his hesitations and his uneasiness around others. She never let drop anything about her feelings, but it must have been obvious, especially for Sherlock’s and Irene’s sharp gazes.
Getting away from John and the temptation he represented.
No, Sherlock mused, in order to find a clue, he had to turn away from all knowledge related to Da Vinci and to look elsewhere.
You were hurt.
Let me, Joan thought, before tilting up her head, capturing first Sherlock’s upper lip between her own, then releasing her and doing the same to the lower lip.
Small Trigger warning here : fatshaming.
“It helps me clearing my head, you know. I find it quite relaxing, to be honest. And the team of volunteers, they’re such lovely people, always ready to help you when you get a question or a problem!”
The DI has spluttered indignantly something about insulting behavior while John has tried to hide his laugh by coughing in his fist.
He was looking for a thrilling life, full of mysteries to be solved, a life where his cleverness and his quick-fire deductions would be more than tolerated – they would be encouraged.
One hour later, Lestrade and his team have come and gone with plastic bags full of evidence, some ruffled feathers – especially among Hot in Love’s officials – have been smoothed and Irene has gained a splitting headache. The police’s intervention has put a definitive damper on the
It was enough for Joan to climax with an inarticulate cry.
Before stopping altogether.
*** "You could have waited a bit, you know"
Let us not forget the past and let us prepare our future.
“John, you make me…” Sherlock groaned into his skin.
That’s how it must have ended.
Sherlock felt more than he saw John turning slightly his head in his direction, as if he was striving to offer his help to Sherlock but didn’t know how to do it.
It wasn’t long before she fell under his spell. To his credit, he never gave her any false hope. Even when he was trying to manipulate her – and he generally succeeded – it was done with a kind of boyish charm, something so unlike other men’s attempts at bedding her when she agreed on a date. No wonder then, she thought, she couldn’t stop mooning over him when he was around.
“Come inside, you gorgeous thing.”
And on a lighter note, the case I describe in this chapter is based on this article - http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/mona-lisa-smile-based-on-his-gay-lover-claims-leonardo-da-vinci-art-historian-a6993951.html
He didn’t miss the startled look in Mycroft’s eyes or the light flush spreading across on his cheekbones. However, it didn’t last. Mycroft’s whole face hardened and his voice grew progressively colder as he replied in the tone he undoubtedly intended when he had the misfortune of coming across persons as cheeky and foolish as Greg at this moment.
“What…?”
“John. John Watson.”
John’s gaze widened further if such a thing was possible and Sherlock hesitated. Maybe it hasn’t been such a great idea to take the plunge in such a grandiloquent way. He should have started small, taking baby steps and…
Mycroft Holmes might be conservative, appreciating old and even absurd traditions as for example the absolute silence required within the walls of the Diogenes’ Club, but he wasn’t a fool and grooming Anthea as his successor was nothing but a most logical action undertaken among a thousand other ones, all contributing to the achievement of an exemplary and successful career.
Lost in the powerful orgasm roaring through his whole body, he barely heard Sherlock groaning his release.
Which one would you like? I'm all ears!
She bit her lower lip, betraying her nervousness, before going on.
disappointed, John…”
completely unacceptable. Put your hands on me and don’t let go, understood?”
When Sherlock slammed the flat’s door with his foot, John was nearly begging.
Especially when they concerned people suffering at the hands of others for being “different” – whatever the fuck that meant.
“And you’re still overdressed.”
There, all done. Time to turn back to his blog – not that he was very inspired, but Ella has said to…
He found out his hands were balled into fists at his sides, as if he could physically punch his goddamned curiosity. A voice looking furiously like Harry’s suddenly echoed in his head.
Molly’s smile, when it bloomed on her lips, was radiant.
Except for the last time, during which he has apparently caught Sherlock off guard, in a rare moment when all his defences were down.
“What... Oh shit.”
Completely humiliated, she took a step backwards.
We? John thought, a bit horrified.
Let them call him freak or any adjective their average minds might come up with.
He swiftly chased away this depressing thought.
“Yeah,” he replied in an overly cheery voice. “Yeah, of course. I’m...” he repeated before the idea struck him. “Hang on a sec. How did you know my address?”
Here we go, he thought when John abruptly stopped, looking up and gaping at him. Sherlock ignored the little voice in his mind stating that it was not a bad look on the former soldier and straightened his shoulders.
Right, then. Time to bring out the big guns.
she asked him, her words dripping with irony.
“What changed your mind, then?” Mycroft softly asked. “If it has indeed changed…”
“And don’t think I’ve forgotten you’ve left me that day to my own devices, an easy prey for
At least, he thought, when he was safely ensconced in the privacy of his office.
He swallowed hard. Gosh. He had the feeling that voice would soon appear in some of his fantasies.
Should he try to remain silent and carry on repressing his feelings?
He knew this display was only for the benefit of Mister Curls – or whatever his name was – but it didn’t stop John from getting even more annoyed.
“Need more data”, he muttered before sitting in his armchair and picking up his laptop.
mattered – was their connection right from the beginning, this link none of them wanted to shake off, which grew deeper and deeper until…
As always.
“Or you could lie down on my bed, flat on your front, and I would rim you until you beg me for your release…”
“Four weeks.”
“What…”
Her Dad and her Papa as well.
, Joan chose the latter.
But one look at Irene’s unruffled face made him relent. For her, detective business has always been a game – who was the cleverest of them both, who will find out first the culprit’s true motives, who will deduce the fastest?
He has nearly jumped when his old man has put his hand on his shoulder – a gesture John has always considered as warm support but has suddenly seemed to be a stifling weight at that moment.
But it didn’t sound right, John mused, as he remembered the expectation clearly written on Sherlock’s face just before he has leant in, nearly kissing John in public and not caring a whit about it. A shiver ran down his spine as he carefully put the box on Mrs Dubusson’s desk before coming closer to his friend, padding carefully as if he didn’t want to spook him.
Dave snorted in his drink, shaking his head at the blonde woman with the pixie cut, leaning up against the counter.
I know, I’m being unfair to you and me, writing such a thing. However, it still rings true to some extent, doesn’t it? Regardless of the circumstances which forced our hands and everything we had to endure through our relationship, we both revealed ourselves to be destructive to each other.
I guess I’ve never told you that (among many, many other things) but the memory of the circumstances under which I’ve first encountered Mike, for instance, does not remain with me.
"He needed to touch him.
Why has he come here, again?
Greg looked away, dejected. How could he have misread to such an extent all the signs, he truly didn’t know, but he had to face the facts – far from turning this lovely illusion on, it was feeling repelled by what he was saying.
“… and so he replied…”
“Sherlock, look at me!”
“It depends.”
In return, I hurt your feelings whenever I could. Seducing women, marrying Mary, loudly claiming “I’m not gay!” and pretending not to notice your silence afterwards.
“I thought that… I want to…”
Seeing John’s puzzled face, she rolled her eyes.
He was expecting his friend to smile back at him before putting some distance again between them. What happened next caught him wholly unawares.
Her companion raised her head. Irene felt her pulse racing when she saw Molly’s heated gaze.
There was a sudden lull in Kelly’s monologue when she took a sip of water, excusing herself with a little smile. John took advantage to discreetly observe Mike, seated next to him at the end of their row. His friend wasn’t faring very well in front of a redhead, who wasn’t even looking at him. Mike was obviously feeling ill at ease, talking a mile a minute in a vain attempt to overcome his own nervousness.
He shrugged before saying “My gut feeling tells me that they have found out who was behind the attacks in Eastern Europe. And they intend to make them pay.”
John who, despite your return, carried on with the wedding plans.
Sylvia only answered with a raised eyebrow before asking John
If you haven't read it yet, give it a try :)
“Don’t let an old thing like me hold you back, you lovebirds!” Angelo gushed loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear, ignoring once again Sherlock’s mortified face. “The night is young!”
What was it about him which captivated him so?
“Not up for a bit of public sex, doctor?” Sherlock teased, biting down gently on John’s earlobe.
“Right! And if you want to talk to that woman, Mike, you should just…”
Time to take the plunge, Greg thought. Unlike John, who was relentlessly pining for his flatmate, he was rather fond of the maxim “Nothing ventured, nothing gained”. True, it wasn’t always successful and he got his share of rebuffs over the years, but if he persisted playing by Mycroft’s rules, he would never reach his goal.
Calling himself a bloody moron, John opened the message.
Sherlock shrugged, letting out an instinctive hiss of pain before smothering it.
Sherlock, who never seemed to care about the insults – “You stuck up bitch!” – or the derisive jeers – “Someone’s got her period this week!” – her attitude provoked.
So much for thinking he was different.
“Of course. I’m Greg’s best man after all. Unlike you, I know how to keep my promise.”
Angry feelings running in her veins, all directed at her.
But life could offer second chances.
John grinned.
John scrambled down the wall, wishing he could delete as easily the kiss which never happened.
He already had several in mind – or rather he had questions.
He has heard a voice… A deep voice, which has whispered in his ear…
He shot what he hoped was his typical Wanna-have-a-good-time-now? smile at Mycroft but considering how his face abruptly shut down, his attempt didn’t turn out to be very successful.
Greg gave a great sigh at the other end of the line.
It meant that a final clue was waiting for him in Mrs Hudson’s mailbox.
Of course he has been jealous. Watching Dimmock smiling at Sherlock, jesting with him has made him grit his teeth while Lestrade was waiting for some witness to come over. And seeing Sherlock reply in kind, gazing at the DI in a way which suggested Dimmock hasn’t been yet considered as an utter idiot has been a very bitter icing on an already indigestible cake.
“Look at me,” he whispered – an order that Sherlock obeyed without any protest, blinking surprised eyes at John.
This time, Sherlock’s screech was so loud John couldn’t help but burst out laughing.
“Which thing?”
She didn’t let herself think of what she was doing.
“So this harasser… You know his face or his name?”
A pat on his shoulder brought him back to reality.
”, he instinctively replied, emphasizing the last word.
“John, we… mmmf!”
“We’re in France, in some little town called Amboise. Are you satisfied now, Mister Doubting Thomas?”
That’s when things had started to go pear-shaped.
I don’t know anymore.
For one heart-wrenching moment, Sherlock thought the
But he needed this, he realized. He needed the closure on what has been one of the most brilliant, craziest chapters of his life.
Sherlock was looking at him, lips parted, pupils dilated. John smothered a groan at that sight.
“Angelo was right at least on one count,” he whispered.
“Assuming you’re telling the truth, why do you need my help, then? (It was Greg’s turn to sound amused.) Unless you absolutely want my idea as regards the holiday souvenirs to bring me back and offer me next time we see each other, hum?”
Whatever the interloper and his friends wanted to achieve, it has the opposite effect – Sherlock startled, his cheeks reddening in a way John would have found completely endearing in other circumstances. For the moment he softly released Sherlock’s coat before taking a step back and glaring uselessly at the drunken group, which was already going away.
To no avail.
“The box” was an accurate description for Serge’s poisoned gift to his sister. A heavy, black safe, Sherlock mused, touching its smooth outline with the utmost care. On the front side lay a small black screen and below it, a numeric keypad. Sherlock leant in to observe it and a red light immediately came to life, attracting his attention as well as John’s.
It was completely intoxicating. John groaned with arousal. It was difficult to see in the half-light of the cab, but it seemed to him that Sherlock’s pupils were dilating further.
She leaned in to whisper “I’ll take a pic and send it to Mycroft.”
“You don’t have to romance me, you know.”
He only heard a whimper before Sherlock raised his head, a dejected expression written all over his face. Despite his self-confidence and his very conviction that Sherlock wasn’t regretting their near kiss, John swallowed hard.
"You're insufferable," John muttered under his breath, his whole expression denying these words.
“I swear, if you’re going to leave me like this…”
"There he was – demobbed soldier, patientless doctor.
But at that moment, he truly didn’t care.
“No one’s business but my own.”
Until Sherlock moved closer to him. He was leaving a small distance between them – no doubt he didn’t wish to incur any comment from their driver. But it didn’t deter him from enjoying the darkness inside the vehicle to do something else – like reaching out and lightly stroking John’s back.
He was tempted to phone Harry – who else could have fooled him so easily? – before remembering she attended a conference in Edinburgh this weekend. He hesitated. Besides, he thought, his sister has always favoured the direct approach, whether she was negotiating with a client or looking for someone to get laid. If she was indeed pulling his leg, passing herself off as this “SH”, she would already have revealed herself.
And the case comes to an end...
He hastened to sit down in the nearest chair, refusing to listen to the little voice whispering in his ear he better take flight before he completely humiliated himself.
And then he has remembered how his companion hasn’t hesitated to jump on the suspect’s back, pushing him to the ground.
She read the answer on his face, before he tried to hide it.
Joan groaned.
But before he could think of something to say, Sherlock dropped his gaze, staring absentmindedly at his paper serviette he was currently tearing into shreds.
Molly has indeed remained at her side, listening to her explanations when she told what happened to
If his army doctor still believed he could fool him in such an obvious manner, he got another thing coming.
“Johnny. I am fat not blind. I knew when we were still students, okay? That’s old news, mate.”
He smothered groan, not even attempting to get his mind out of the gutter as far as Will was concerned.
She didn’t even bother restraining herself from smiling goofily at this and John felt a prickle of jealousy faced with his sister’s obvious happiness.
He put both hands on Sherlock’s backside, stroking the firm globes before squeezing them. And before Sherlock could say “Cheater” again, he started.
He remains frozen to the spot, half-standing, the cooling water licking his calves. In his mind, disbelief is warring against kindling hope.
Greg couldn’t resist him anymore.
He stopped, a truly frightening idea coming up in his mind.
“But where are we going?”
She flushed at this memory before turning her head to the left.
“John?”
“Ahum.”
It wasn’t worth the unavoidable heartbreak.
“Just Greg will be enough, thanks.”
And when has Sherlock ever be distracted so much from her work that she nearly jeopardized a police operation? Never.
“I really hope you’re not talking about Sherlock right now…”
“For a genius, you sure could be a right idiot! Of course not!”
Sherlock tossed her head back, a soft moan escaping her mouth.
“And you’re an idiot,” he went on, the affection in his voice soothing the sting of his words.
“Greg, I…”
John groaned.
Deep denial, according to Ella, resisting everything – Mycroft’s terse condolences, Mrs Hudson’s tears, even the pitying glances Lestrade threw my way.
Well, it was no use crying over spilled milk. Especially since she has already informed DI Lestrade of the suspect’s escape. The police won’t take long to come over there and rummage among the suspect’s personal belongings.
Mycroft could already see in his mind’s eye how it would unfold afterwards.
“You will… Oh God… Sher…”
That the mere word of “friendship” was not enough – would never be enough for what we had.
He smothered a groan. It wasn’t the right time to let his imagination run wild. They were here for a case and…
Fortunately for the treacherous heat creeping up his spine and into his pants, the wanton thoughts were brought to a swift end when Mycroft looked up at him, giving him a potent glare.
He has made a right fool of himself.
And a great deal of affection.
“Oh please, I’m sure he has already deleted the whole scene. As for myself… “
Sleep eluded you more often and you didn’t even notice it, lost as you were in your own turmoil, resolving in the dead of the night to break free from the grasp John seemed to have on your heart before falling all over again come morning.
John wasn’t really surprised by this. From what he knew about Da Vinci – which was very little, by the way – he could see how a young Sherlock could become enraptured by the Renaissance genius.
Why has his heartbeat suddenly quickened when hearing this name? John wondered. His name didn’t matter, he told himself. His cleverness, his looks, his willingness to help others in time of need… John shook his head minutely, closing his eyes, refusing to acknowledge how these facts were branding on his memory.
A tremulous smile, followed by “I swear, I’ve got a whole speech prepared but… I don’t think I can…”
“Yes, you silly man. It’s all true,” he softly said, planting a gentle kiss on his lover’s cheek. “Now what do you say, hum? Should we be husband and... husband?”
What I look like, John thought, but he didn’t say it aloud. Was it a date? Or was SH as lonely as he appeared to be, looking for comradeship and nothing else? After all, sharing a meal, even with a stranger, didn’t commit him to anything. God knows he could use a new friend.
Two months.
“I have something way better than this.”
“What… You’re kidding!”
Joan flashed her a coy smile.
John finally broke the silence, saying in a husky voice “If I tell you I’m hungry and not for food, do you…?”
Making new acquaintances.
Playing with her hot pink, heart-shaped invitation card, Irene whispered “It could have been worse, mind you.”
Of course, the day after, Sherlock has loudly denied having ever accepted such a ludicrous offer. Unfortunately for him – and John – Greg has thought of everything.
“What?”
It seemed that Hussein’s pride in the Community Garden was not only justified, it was also shared by every member that the two men bumped into during their walk. People were quietly tending to their plots or the common gardens, focused on the plants in their hands, handling them with care; A little further, two men were pruning a lush rose bush, the easy banter between them bringing about a bittersweet ache in John’s heart. But this feeling quickly passed away, the overall friendliness of the garden’s volunteers showing in every smile, every “Hello” aimed at Hussein, who in return introduced John to everyone. After weeks of scarce social interaction, John felt a bit overwhelmed by all this attention – without speaking of all the new names to keep in mind – but he did his best for Mrs Hudson’s sake. At the end of the visit, while chatting with some members of Hussein’s team over a cup of tea, he realized he has been effortlessly drawn into these ordinary people’s lives, with their complaints over noisy neighbours or proudly presenting photos of their children.
Relentless desire was buzzing through his whole body, but John found the necessary strength to rein it in as he picked another beloved fantasy of his.
This inability to get the other woman, to be able to know in advance how she was going to respond was grating on Irene’s nerves. It was maddening.
Million pounds question, that one. He absentmindedly drew invisible circles with the tip of his left forefinger on the wooden counter. Two months and Sherlock’s clear gaze still haunted him. Creeping into his mind when John least expected it, dancing in front of his gaze when he was revising for his exams and – worst of all – imposing itself whenever John was being chatted up at Bart’s, a silent, all too clear reminder that he has business unfinished with Mister Curls. It drove him to distraction, leaving him silent and lost in thoughts even when he was with his friends, attracting their attention “What’s up, Johnny?” “Don’t tell me you’re brooding again!”
– man just said?
“That’s… good. Fine. I’m…happy for him,” he blurted out, his daring deflating now that he knew Mister Curls was “doing fine on his own”.
But something in her, some kind of protective, basic instinct towards her friend didn’t want to drop this issue. It was pushing her to remain here, waiting for Sherlock’s reappearance, instead of going upstairs and trying to fall asleep.
It didn’t happen very often – in fact he could count on one hand the number of times this particular feeling occurred – but Sherlock could admit he was bemused by the short man walking alongside him.
on the other side of the Loire river, standing tall and proud above the water and lit up with all kinds of Christmassy ornaments.
“You asked me to kiss you,” he repeated.
His budding excitement and arousal swiftly disappeared, being replaced with embarrassment and growing anguish.
Of course.
“Tell me just one thing – has he looked at you just one time? Has he dared to meet your gaze? Has he given any sign at all that your attention was welcome?”
He finally let the tears streaming down his face, cleansing him of every time he didn’t allow himself to express his grief. Every time someone (“
And he couldn’t say he was feeling very chagrined about it.
idiot.”
“Don’t you get your knickers in a twist!” she said with a pout. “Can’t you take a joke?”
Walking back up Baker Street, he came to the only logical conclusion – the “gift”, if he can describe it like this, was intended for him. Someone has slipped it inside the mailbox, perfectly aware of the fact that sooner or later, John will find it.
He cleared his throat.
It makes John want – want to come closer to his friend, reducing the distance between them until it was fading into non-existence; want to put a supporting hand on Sherlock’s back whenever he was retreating within oneself, growing tired of the outside world and his sometimes very limited capacity for tolerance and acceptance; want to tell him “You’re not alone, I’m here with you, we’re in this together.”
How Harry has held his hand tight in hers, silently asking for his support, for him to come forward and to say “Me too” as she was stuttering along in front of their parents, their stares focused on both of them.
Feeling a bit stronger in his resolve, John opened his eyes again. He has obviously missed the rest of the discussion between Poshy and Ross, since both men were parting on a reluctant nod before Mycroft walked out of the
The soft question took him unawares. Hesitancy was warring with hope in Sherlock's eyes.
He hasn’t believed his ears. Until this moment he hasn’t known that silence could be so cruel. So cold. He hasn’t known that parents, people who were supposed to support their children no matter who they loved, could act in such a way, sweeping Harry’s words under the rug, issuing such a curt dismissal that his sister remained frozen on the spot, anguish shining in her gaze before she abruptly turned on her heel and fled.
They drank in silence, a comfortable comradeship which gave John the opportunity to have a closer look at his friend.
“What are you doing?” he asked as he saw Sherlock going past the Clos Lucé’s doors and striding along the wall enclosing the old house and its garden. “Aren’t they waiting for us?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s why,” Greg spoke a bit louder, “I’m going to handle this whole mess…”
“John is… I’ve never seen him so devastated. He put on his façade of brave soldier, but everyone can see how much he is hurting. You…”
“Let me speak, okay? I need to tell you this, God knows it might be my only chance to do this…”
Mycroft was still seated on his worn-out sofa, looking completely out of his depth and adorably concerned at the same time. Sherlock’s brother peered at him with a slight frown, before a light flush spread across his pale skin. He looked away.
Friends taking advantage of her when she was at university – “Thanks for the notes, Mol, you’re a peach!” before forgetting her when they were going out.
It was quickly becoming a real challenge, especially when his diabolical tease of a date was growing bolder in his exploration, lightly squeezing the top of his buttocks before stroking John’s ribs, the sensitive flesh of his belly.
“Good evening, brother mine.”
At five pm, the flat was spotless, the clothes for tonight carefully chosen and laid on the bed and John was getting more and more nervous. He has been half-heartedly checking earlier the job ads on the computer when he suddenly thought that maybe Sherlock was to be found on the social networks. His heart has leapt at this idea – maybe he wouldn’t go to a blind date, after all. One hour later, he hasn’t found any pic – and certainly no trace of Sherlock on Facebook. No, what John has discovered was
“Okay, then. And what are you doing here, exactly? Because somehow I don’t think you’re here just for the fun of it…”
He has barely set foot in the flat he has seen for the first time a little earlier that Sherlock embraced him from behind, pulling him against his chest and planting a series of hard, little kisses on any part of John’s face he could reach – his cheek, his brow, his jaw, the corner of his lips.
his reflection seemed to ask him.
Molly struggled to reconcile the ghastly sight before her eyes with her personal memories of Sherlock – the brilliant, confident man striding in her lab like it belonged to him, making himself at home.
She ignored Sherlock’s ironic sound and resumed.
A mobile phone prefix.
He dropped the phone on the sofa before rushing to the bathroom.
Suddenly the hips below his fingers were not round and soft anymore, turning to hard, skinny ridges.
He guiltily glanced at John, whispering “I miss him.”
She couldn’t endure it any longer. She wanted her fingers, her tongue inside her right now.
“If that was a case, why didn’t you involve me then? I was… waiting for…”
“Sorry to disturb you but could you please lend me a hand? The box is quite heavy and with this little one…” she said, giving a kiss to the child in her arms, clutching her blouse with all the strength of a koala.
Attracting raised eyebrows, distrustful glances, hurtful words.
“Sally…”
To his slight surprise, Sherlock immediately answered.
He wants to say so many more words, all the words who have piled up in his mind since he witnessed the fall, but his mouth, his tongue can only utter this “You’re dead” over and over.
“You’re right, Sherlock,” he answered, taking care that his voice sounded as flippant as possible. “I give up. You win.”
Good old Greg, always ready for a visit at his favourite pub – as well as trying to nudge John back into the dating game, hoping without a doubt to live vicariously through him, since he and his latest girlfriend were back together.
“Easy, doctor,” he whispered against John’s heated skin. “I’m afraid I can’t do without your expert skills tonight…”
“I wanted to test your CCTV network’s efficiency, brother mine,” Sherlock drawled. “And let me say that I found it severely lacking.”
“Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock went on, punctuating each word with a delicate kiss on every part of John’s face he could reach. “65 years old. Baker extraordinaire, Aston Martin driver and like a second mother to me.”
The same goes for Mary. And for every person whose presence I’ve enjoyed in my life.
That he was just a coward, not even brave enough to sign his text?
"I'm... I'm sorry."
John closed his eyes.
She beamed.
“Sounds splendid,” John answered.
Mycroft visibly shivered, Greg smirked before clearing his throat and asking
Together, Joan thought, drowning in a wave of pleasure. They were together.
Sherlock immediately took advantage of this move, leaning forward and pickpocketing John’s phone without any difficulty.
Mycroft didn’t dare imagining his little brother’s reaction if he has caught him like this, enduring a sleepless night while (not so) patiently waiting for Gregory to wake up.
As he did every Friday night, after having attended his classes at Bart’s.
But this feeling was nothing compared to the sizzling hot rush spreading across his whole body when Anthea added, with a perfectly sweet smile
And if he correctly judged the looks Sherlock was currently garnering with his way of dancing, he wasn’t the only one to think so. John gnashed his teeth, resisting the temptation to snarl at anyone coming closer to his date.
“Definitely not,” John agreed before kissing him sweetly. “Come on, you menace. We have a room waiting for us.”
If someone tried to leave another gift for him, John couldn’t miss him – or her.
The only question was – how to let him know John was definitely interested in keeping in touch with him?
She rushed towards Joan, who was left speechless by this angry outburst, until she could put her hands on her shoulders.
“Why? Why did you keep me in the dark? I never said “no” when you needed help, even when your sister was involved! You know how much I love…”
The slam of the front door interrupted her thoughts. Joan sat up, pricking up her ears.
Sherlock Holmes was being ignored by all, except for one person faithfully dogging his steps.
“Get over here, John, and give me a leg up!”
There she was two minutes later – nursing a gin and tonic and wondering absent-mindedly in which state Irene would find his associate.
“It’s okay, old thing,” Sherlock replied with a reassuring smile. “We’ll find him.”
“You know,” John hesitatingly broke the silence, “this reminds me of the
Raspy breaths.
Fortunately Sherlock has been there, dashing after their man. Molly has helped her standing up before taking care of the young woman, who was already suffering from the first effects of the drug.
“What are you tal… Mmmmmf!”
Gosh. He has barely talked to the man and there he was, swooning over him.
And he couldn’t hope to seduce anyone by acting so rashly.
A fact he has forgotten over the past few months.
“I was looking for Sherlock but he seemed unreachable.”
Someone who was trying to find his own way, doing his best to ignore the social conventions, turning a deaf ear whenever Mummy or Mycroft started harping on about children, job, partners.
Greg didn’t intend to grant him this satisfaction. He leaned back against his chair, taking the time to cross his legs. During a fleeting moment, he toyed with the idea of replying “If you’re not interested in a chat, how about a quick shag over your desk, then?” but his intent was to bring Mycroft out of his armour, not to antagonize him.
This morning after – even if they’ve done nothing else than kissing – was already shaping up as the best he has ever known.
“You know what you have to do.”
Sudden warmth flowed through John’s veins. Acting intuitively, he ran to the building’s corner – just in time to see a man crossing the road at full speed, Sherlock hot on his heels. The consulting detective turned in his head in his direction.
You’re precious to me, Sherlock. Everything we had and that we still have deserves to be cherished and nurtured. To be remembered with fondness and to be talked about, a smile on our lips.
He had never seen the 221b looking so neat and tidy. Everything was in its place – cups in the drawer, telly remote put on the coffee table, next to yesterday’s newspaper, carefully folded.
This voice. It was the voice she has so often dreamt of, fantasized about when she was in her bed, fondling her breasts before stroking herself just there.
She was about to reach for him and drag him along with her, whether he wanted it or not, when she heard behind her
His vast network of spies and other useful contacts returned empty-handed. Even the most unsavoury and cunning characters that Mycroft, in his desperation, had to get in touch with had nothing but lies for him.
“You make me crazy…” John growled against his neck before opening his mouth and biting it gently.
“What? Is that all? No more taunts? Have you already exhausted every threat your boring little mind might have come up with? I’m
“Come with me,” Sherlock whispered to John and he automatically obeyed, following him till a quieter alley. The London night atmosphere was growing around them, roaring with colour and life, but here, in this narrow path, where they could only see a sliver of sky above their heads, they seemed to have entered a quiet, peaceful bubble. Something intangible, which nevertheless managed to soothe John’s frayed nerves.
Of course she was in love with her. How could she resist?
With an inarticulate cry he flung away the little bouquet, as memories of being taken hostage by Moriarty – being reduced to nothing but a pawn in the cat-and-mouse game Moriarty was playing with Sherlock – came back to him.
“Because all his victims were short, busty and blonde. They looked like you.”
The sound of a delicately clearing throat made him jump. Sherlock opened his eyes – since when have they been closed? – and found himself face to face with John’s startled gaze. Barely an inch remained between them.
John gaped at him, his mouth opening without any sound coming out of it.
How stupid has he been, to have ignored this handsome, clever man just for the sake of his own prejudices and fears! Now, as Sherlock was clearly taking his courage in both hands to speak to him, he could only hope it wasn’t too late for the shining, entrancing possibility his desire was painting just before his eyes.
He didn’t know either why John has replied “I’m sorry, mate. He’s truly a bastard.”
“I can make an educated guess,” Sherlock retorted, playfully nudging John’s nose with his. “But I’m afraid it’s not going you to help you with this,” he said, his gaze directed at John’s erection currently tenting his pants.
“You’ve never heard of… No, never mind, don’t answer that”, John replied with a little smile before launching into a short explanation of the bestselling novel’s plot.
“You were saying, Sir?”
) has stopped him from “making a scene”, as his Mum would have said.
Or, at the most, useful weapons to understand what motivated perfectly ordinary people to kill, lie, cheat and do other such disagreeable things.
“You’re such a tease.”
“Feeling maudlin, Sir?” Anthea asked, casting a puzzled look in his direction. “Should I see on Twitter which latest idiocy our beloved friend Trump posted today and read it to you?”
You followed the white rabbit in his lair and you almost fell down headfirst in the pit.
Maybe a short nap in the sofa was in order before he resumed his drinking night. Greg was about to put his glass on the coffee table – when has this one started to move, really? – and to lie down when he heard sharp knocks at the flat’s door.
Mycroft shook his head, ruthlessly chasing away this particular remembrance as well as any stupid, idiotic, completely imbecile hope Greg’s foolish words might have aroused.
Sherlock let out a dark chuckle before pulling back just enough to meet John’s completely dazed gaze. Himself looked a right mess – swollen lips, wet with saliva, red cheeks, blown pupils in his clear eyes.
Mrs Dubusson’s office accurately mirrored her owner’s tastes and habits. It managed to look cosy and tightly organised at the same time.
“Yeah…”
And you let him in.
“Mind if I keep you company?”
Sherlock kissed him. Mouth warm and pliant against his, lips tasting, a hint of a tongue before letting him go.
“Tell me!”
I do love when the characters are thrown for a loop ^^
The madman you’re about to share a bed with.
However, as he peered at her, she kept a perfectly bland face, a benign smile on her lips.
Only to get a new addiction while he was still recovering from his last bout in rehab.
“Typical”, John grumbled under his breath before lifting the suitcase and following the madman.
him if I got the chance.”
“Hush.” The young man leaned forward. “It’s a trick, John. Just a magic trick.”
That night, his father joined him in his room, seating on his bed and staring at John for such a long time the teenager he was then got convinced his father somehow knew what he has failed to do alongside Harry.
A few seconds later, John found himself lying down on the blanket. Looming over him, Sherlock stared at him, his curly hair a complete mess.
“It’s okay, John. I knew you didn’t mean anything by
Mycroft was nervy, something must have thrown him for a loop and Greg couldn’t resist prodding him a little bit.
"What are you thinking?"
When.
He glanced up at the clock and swore when he discovered it was nearly half eight.
“He looks just like you when you got out of the bathroom this morning!” she has replied, howling with laughter afterwards. Greg has remained frozen on the spot, staring at the statuette’s lumpy, unattractive shape – his round thighs, his potbelly, his stunted stature…
She stopped, suddenly afraid of being too forward. Was Sherlock even thinking…
Life for John would have been very dire indeed, if Sherlock hasn’t unexpectedly channelled his anger at having been fooled by the DI into vigorous bouts of angry sex.
"Everything all right, gents?" she asked.
John groaned.
“Forget it,” he muttered.
The coward’s choice, that’s what she was saying. Anger surged through him, fuelled by his inability to refute her accusation. He clenched his fists. Harry glanced briefly down at his hands – a look of fear flashed across her face. An expression that John wasn’t expecting to find on her sister’s features and which left him totally puzzled. Nausea rolled in his gut when he realized that Harry must have seen the same reaction over and over in people standing in front of her; Noticing her, her laugh, her haircut, the way she spoke, anything really which told them that she wasn’t one of them.
“It’s fine that you love my voice. I love yours too. Or the fact that you love every second spent with me. I do love it too. In fact, I… I love you, John.”
The Machine.
“I’m perfectly aware of that,” he snapped, calling himself a bloody fool for not having recognised sooner this fruit.
He didn’t have time to finish that sentence.
He didn’t think about it too long – he hastened to hit the corresponding numbers on the numeric keypad. The screen lit up as he entered the code, bloody figures casting a red glow on the black box.
John gritted his teeth.
“Are you all right?”
Did you think it was the end? That you would come back like a triumphant Odysseus, who, after having killed every intruder who has set foot in his territory, found back happiness and warmth with his faithful Penelope?
And without waiting for an answer, John tossed the stranger’s hood back.
“Sherlock…”
He must look like a madman, talking to himself, heart already racing furiously in his chest but he didn’t care. His computer was apparently in a good mood today and a little while after John found himself typing “Sherlock Holmes” in the Google bar with trembling fingers.
Something he has dearly wished he could bring up in other circumstances – like, for instance, after Sherlock’s speech, when the dance floor would be full and that he would have successfully coaxed his lover into slow dancing with him.
“It’s fine that you love my voice. I love yours too. Or the fact that you love every second spent with me. I do love it too. In fact, I… I love you, John.”
What did they mean though? Which kind of clue did they intend to give?
Has he really jumped?
An epilogue (of sorts).
They were panting in each other’s mouth, taking the time to watch the other.
“And when I considered you’ve cried and begged enough… Oh… I will pull my zipper down and pull my cock out. I will be as hard as I am now. You will raise your hips, begging me to fuck you…”
Amboise has to offer, especially in this season.”
The one where this AU is definitely flirting with canon.
His hands cradling him, protecting him.
John looked up at him so quickly Sherlock heard the audible snap in his neck. He looked completely thunderstruck.
And he has done it in public.
“Mister Curls over there. He got some company.”
There was a sudden shuffle of footsteps on the other side of the door against which John was leaning and during a brief moment, he hoped that his mad genius of a lover would finally come to his senses and open the locked door.
he has seen – in Mister Curls’ gaze?
Such marvellous words.
When they drew up, gasping for breath, John was so close he could have wept. But Sherlock seemed to have other plans.
Behind the lenses of his spectacles Mike was staring at him with a worried frown on his face.
The kind you certainly never learned in a dancing class, for sure.
Easier to understand.
“Let me help you,” she whispered, her fingers already unbuttoning Sherlock’s blouse.
Sherlock didn’t know.
“You didn’t…”
“I don’t mean to imply I consider women as consolation prize! It’s just that… I never got the chance to explore… Oh God, I’m making a hash of it, am I?”
“But… You didn’t even try it on!”
He forced himself to calm down before resuming his task.
He still remembered Mycroft’s shell-shocked silence when he has discovered his younger brother’s nighttime activities. He hasn’t been able to hide his disgust and contempt quite successfully, either.
John has never loved him more than right now.
“But why? Girls like pink, don’t they?”
It sounded so familiar you could almost believe nothing has changed, nothing has been lost.
“She wanted to make a… mock of me… or whatever I don’t care now. The point is…”
- shadow. He stifled a groan. Now wasn’t the time for his mind to remind him what he was physically looking for in a partner. Or that he liked his men to be taller than him (which wasn’t really difficult, if he was honest with himself).
He turned on his heel and ran away.
“What? Can’t you see I’m busy right now?”
She shook her head. The lure of the bottle of wine, still half-open in the fridge, was tempting but Joan needed to keep a clear head. Besides, she didn’t feel like falling into the same trap as her brother Harry, using alcohol as an emotional crutch.
“I’ll disabuse you of this notion as soon as you put Rosie to bed…”
It’s strange, you know, because I don’t usually remember the first time I met someone.
His mind, a formidable weapon still being honed thanks to his endless curiosity, wasn’t getting muddled up by feelings which were as inconvenient as they were relentless.
A slight shadow appeared on the lawn, getting taller as the person drew nearer.
It was ecstasy as he had never known before.
She felt her friend taking a deep breath before letting out a great sigh. She got free and walked away so suddenly Joan couldn’t help but feeling bereft.
“Sure of what?” he asked before a sudden thought tumbled in his mind. He groaned.
organizing committee, but it was always more fun to hear it from her.
“Is your wife still trying to…”
“Another day maybe. There’s only so much stupidity I can stomach in one day and I’m afraid the discussion this afternoon with our Russian counterparts was the latest straw.”
He frowned. Better not be Donovan or whoever the fuck thought it was all right to disturb him. He briefly toyed with the idea of lying low, but at this moment there was a second flurry of knocks at his door. Whoever that was seemed to be absolutely determined to break in on his drinking night.
“I should have said it when we were alone in our flat, after I told you how much I… I appreciate you.”
At this moment his attention was caught by some point over John’s shoulder. Sherlock raised his head and went livid when he saw Irene walking to him with a thunderous look on her face.
Sitting in his armchair in front of the fire, John knew he couldn’t go on like this. He was already becoming mad, nearly drowning in his bloody bath because he couldn’t stop dreaming, couldn’t stop living in the past.
“Great to know that from now on, Lestrade is your new partner. Is she going to be your new flatmate as well?”
That should teach him.
Time for a second attempt. He waited for the train’s next stop – “Notting Hill Gate. Please mind the gap” – before repeating in a more pleading tone “Sher…”
The man seated next to him didn’t answer. Since they have boarded the Tube, Sherlock has lapsed into a sullen silence and showed no sign of coming out of his sulk. John sighed. He really couldn’t blame his friend – he would have done the same in his stead.
as the French say – piteously, horribly pining for the man who shared his life in all important matters except for one.
John didn’t even try to repress the long shiver running through him. He had nothing more to hide after all. He has totally surrendered himself to Sherlock’s touch.
John heard Mycroft’s sharp intake of breath but his voice remained level as he replied
But the worst was yet to come.
“Don’t worry, you’re not the only one!” Hussein replied. “Of course, right now, it’s only at the planning stage, but we hope that the town council will support us…”
“Don’t worry. At the very worst he might get caught with his pants down.”
“Which kind of favour?”
He let the young man slip out of his grasp, rushing after his one decisive asset. To his amazement, the stranger didn’t try to steal it from him. Instead he stood up, waiting for John to get his hand on the gun again before saying “I’ll give you one more clue, then. He said it might be necessary.”
“Let’s go then,” he replied before striding away, resolving to pickpocket John’s phone at the earliest opportunity.
“She’s the author of several legislative projects directed against "propaganda of homosexuality" including the infamous Russian LGBT propaganda law,” he resumed, observing closely John.
You did your best not to blush under his attention.
“Sherlock’s website.”
Who knew that this unusual mix was enough to make him want to fall down on his knees and offer comfort and affection to the one man who boldly professed he didn’t need it and – even worse – despised it entirely?
“Of course,” Anthea smoothly retorted, an amused gleam in her dark eyes. “One thing for sure, you won’t be working on your modesty, then.”
Feel that Sherlock is alive and – above all –
“I did.”
“When that art historian claimed that the Mona Lisa portrait was based on Da Vinci’s male lover,” Sherlock interrupted her, ignoring John’s not so discreet splutter of surprise beside him. “I remember reading your brother’s answer to his allegations in a newspaper. It was vitriolic, to say the least.”
It was a bloody torture. And she couldn’t stop herself resenting Sherlock for this.
A small smile bloomed on Molly’s face.
“You’re infuriating, you know that?”
Mind-blowing.
After a few seconds, John looked away and his voice was strained when he broke the silence between them.
John automatically complied, not without asking
Sherlock draped himself over his back, adding another finger in his massage.
“That’s not funny!” he protested before he felt himself laughing in turn.
I beat you up.
were whispering in your ear."
] before sending it to the stranger.
The man frowned, as if he hadn’t been truly aware of his appearance until now.
He quickly glanced at her and startled when Harry’s gaze met his. Eyes of a lighter blue than his, looking at him in an inscrutable way.
“You’re definitely the best.”
“I was wondering… Would you be so kind as to help me once again?”
“I know,” Greg whispered, his gaze focused on Mycroft. “I didn’t forget. Nor have I forgotten what I’ve offered you then.”
He dimly perceived the surrounding noises – doors of the nearby flats closing and opening, snatches of conversations, cars honking and people crying out in the streets – but for once, they didn’t manage to disturb him. For once his mind was at peace, deep waters shining under the sun, shyly peeking through clouds. He knew it wouldn’t stay like this, that his relentless curiosity and the overwhelming need to
No matter how sad, how desperate even he has been.
She hasn’t felt such anger since she has joined the army, ready to tear to pieces anyone standing in her way.
He pulled back, observing with growing pleasure the rising flush in Mycroft’s cheeks and the slight gasp he involuntarily gave. He fought the temptation to walk round the sofa and to kneel in front of the gorgeous man who was seated there, letting his hands stroking softly these long legs through the trousers’ fabric and…
The worst being maybe that he had no true desire to let Sherlock out of his sight.
They stared at each other in silence during long seconds before Sherlock answered.
He tugged a little the waistcoat.
“I wasn’t doing…”
Mrs Dubusson shot him a slight smile, the corners of her mouth quivering a little bit. Behind the tightly controlled mask she has put on, he could sense a powerful emotion welling up in her.
Two words that Joan has almost never heard in her friend’s mouth.
He remained motionless for a while, taking deep breaths, the only noise troubling the deep silence of his flat.
“John! John!”
“And to think I almost lost you doing so.”
as Wikipedia names it, before describing quite thoroughly the tree and its many properties. Mrs Hudson wasn’t wrong when she said that the seed was toxic – in fact, nearly everything in the yew tree was poisonous. No wonder then that it was closely associated with death.
Molly hesitated. When she was a teenager, her mum used to say “You wear your heart on your sleeve, darling, it’ll bring you nothing but trouble!” She was right as usual, Molly has discovered, one bitter experience after the next.
John.
, the
Not his fault either Greg has pounced on that perfect opportunity like a cat on a mouse.
He found himself caught in a darkened grey gaze, bright with lust and fear and a thousand other emotions.
“Yeah. My girlfriend.”
He didn’t have to wait long for Greg to answer.
And every time I don’t turn you down, every time I smile when I’m reminded of a case we investigated together, your eyes shine just a little bit brighter.
In short – a fool.
But now, they didn’t have the power to hurt him anymore. To make him feel guilty.
But it was all worth it, Mycroft instantly deduced, as he saw his brother’s dazzling smile and the shiny, silver new ring on his finger.
During these first months, he eagerly followed the trail left by his brother through Belgium, France, Austria and then Eastern Europe.
“I don’t care about your orders. Not anymore. You have to hear this, whether it is Greg openly weeping at your funeral or Mrs Hudson’s sprained ankle because she fell down the stairs, going up to your flat!”
Everyone always assumed that John has been lured into Sherlock’s world with the thrilling cases and the breath-taking moments when they gave chase to a suspect.
Meanwhile, back in London...
“I would have kicked you in the shin if you have done so.”
Sherlock let out a disbelieving snort, but didn’t insist. Of course, there has been no clue in Serge’s letter to his sister as to hint at which combination will open the box. The whole thing was doomed from the start – they could try any combination and be none the wiser when the deadline will be reached. It wasn’t so much a trap than a way for Serge to beat once again his sister at a game whose rules he was the only one to know.
“Greg, do you seriously believe lying to…?”
Was he really the only one who truly appreciated Sherlock’s company for what is was?
“Oh, shut up, you fucker,” he mumbled, giving him the finger before stumbling along in his way to the kitchen.
Because there was a thin line between wishing to protect someone and intruding on her privacy, removing her free will out of the equation under the pretext of keeping her safe.
Checkmate. He couldn’t think of anything to reply. Without any doubt because Sherlock was right. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed Martha and Harold toning it down their bickering and glancing at them curiously.
The tightest pants he could find, translucent shirt which was so thin one could see his nipples through it, half-open on sweaty pale skin.
“The last one is Russian,” Sherlock answered, savouring each word rolling on his tongue. “It’s the Mizulina firm, named after the father of Mikhail Mizulin. You may have heard of his wife a few years ago – Yelena Mizulina.”
"He would never forget his life with Sherlock, but maybe, as time went by, he could let it fade into the background."
And likely to recognize her and Sherlock at any moment, blowing their cover.
“He made you feel…” she repeated but John could sense the question behind it.
John smothered a groan. He got the feeling the choice has already been made for him.
If the price to pay for what he has always wanted was loneliness and even rejection by Sally and others, it was okay, Sherlock mused. He could bear it.
Sherlock suddenly pulled back and in one swift move, let himself drop in the garden.
As if it would matter.
Dear readers,
“Yes, you did.”
“And what’s the name of your lovely friend, Miss Holmes?”
“… I love taking part in your work. For God’s sake, Sherlock, I even killed a man for you!”
“You look good enough to eat.”
John mumbled “Thanks” before ducking his head and avoiding the all too perceiving eyes of the bartender.
“You really don’t have to apologize,” John whispered, suddenly choked by emotion. He couldn’t help but recognize in Hussein’s voice, vibrant with enthusiasm, the same unadulterated passion which has shone in Sherlock’s eyes until his fall.
Mycroft’s frown grew into a scowl.
He shrugged. It didn’t really matter, did it?
was on her lips, but she choked it back.
“Get a grip, Irene! What would be the point?”
Sherlock – “Will” – cleared his throat.
Among the vast nest of roots stood a little board, with a large “073” written on it. Right, John thought, Hussein’s numbering system to easily identify the plots in the garden and…
“Of course! Why would you be here otherwise?”
A very familiar voice that he hasn’t heard for a very long time.
Of course, it was an illusion! He wasn’t a DI for nothing, after all.
“It could wait until you’ve finished,” Greg offered, emptying his glass of orange juice in one gulp.
Pupils dilated, Sherlock replied in a soft voice “Show me your breasts. You have no idea how much I have fantasized about them.”
He was going to close the mailbox when he discerned, at the bottom of the box, a small object. He grasped it carefully. It was a small handmade car, carved into a dark, rough bark. Red berries glued in place made up the four wheels. It was really ingenious, he thought, turning it round in his palm, he wondered who…
Gosh. He should never have allowed Mike to convince him to take part in this… dating game.
He smothered this impulse somehow, licking his lips instead and looking away.
“Piss off!” he mumbled under his breath.
And he really was. Here, with her – at least for the moment.
“Even if you considered me as rude and impolite?” John couldn’t help but teasing him.
Time to change his tactics.
Sherlock tried to keep it cool, remembering John’s eyes darkening just before he has literally begged Sherlock for a kiss.
Coming from a man who was way shorter than Sherlock, it was quite ironic to be called like this. However, Sherlock didn’t remark on it. He would rather die than admit it, but Ross, with his weathered face and kind gaze, reminded him a bit of his own father.
“I thought I wasn’t to utter his name again?”
Sherlock quickly lost her smile and turned serious again. She lets her eyes travel over Joan’s face.
* "I'm sorry to disturb you but Maëlys can't stop crying. She's asking for you."
John tried to sigh as discreetly as he could and glanced at the timer set on each table. Still three minutes to go.
“I told you to sort yourself out, kiddo…”
John and his friends weren’t here anymore, Sherlock knew it. He simply observed these strangers, feeling more and more disconnected from them. A wall seemed to have been built between him and any other form of life, and it didn’t matter how much Sherlock was reaching out, trying to fit somehow in this crowd, trying to find a place where he could belong, he remained alone. Being kept isolated from this life, this canvas which obstinately rejected his advances.
Hope you'll enjoy it :)
“Sherlock, wait!”
“Yeah?”
“Come here,” Sherlock growled, her hands on Joan’s hips. Careful not to crush her lover, Joan slowly obeyed. But at the first stroke of Sherlock’s tongue against her clit, she cried out.
“You got your jollies from all this, yeah,” Greg has finished, hiding his flushed face in his pint.
Worried.
, Mycroft answered to his own mind, absentmindedly padding along to the kitchen and pouring himself a glass of water. He drank it right away, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat.
Hussein suddenly stopped, rubbing his hands in a nervous gesture.
Here he was on his own. Nobody knew where he was. Would someone even care if he got into trouble? He could count on the fingers of one hand the number of persons who might indeed give a damn about him.
“And to think you always complained of the price of my books…”
Sherlock swallowed hard, watching the rising grief in his eyes.
[With you, it’s never “enough”. SH]
He was coming, thick spurts staining his shirt, Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock himself was frantic, his desperate cries muffled against John’s sweaty, abused neck, rubbing himself shamelessly against John.
He clenched his hands into fists. No doubt it would be very hard to do so. In fact, in comparison with this, his recovery time after he has been shot in Afghanistan and demobbed afterwards would look like a walk in the park.
John regained enough self-control to muster a smile.
“Or both of them,” Sherlock mumbled under his breath, still examining Serge’s letter. It made no doubt that the man was mentally deranged, as the rest of this letter proved it.
“My help?” she repeated. “Which kind of help do you need now?”
During a fleeting moment, John’s blue gaze came to mind but Sherlock relentlessly crushed this memory until it crumbled into ashes.
He didn’t expect his lover to give a happy sigh before crawling towards him.
He leaned in to whisper in the suspect’s ear.
It was a clear night and John enjoyed it, walking back to 221b after having said goodbye to Greg. However, what the DI has confided it in his care made him feel ill at ease. To his shame he found himself jumping at shadows, his imagination playing havoc with his nerves. He berated himself for being so easily freaked out – it didn’t bode well for the nightmares which still haunted him at night. Nevertheless he gave a sigh of relief when he closed behind him his flat’s door. His gaze immediately focused on the wooden car he has found in the mailbox and left on the coffee table after Mrs Hudson’s departure.
“It’s… I don’t…” he babbled to his utter humiliation.
“Yeah. Would you like a demonstration?”
“You could be Mycroft’s best man at their wedding!”
He was like a dragon with his treasure, carefully hoarding the precious little nuggets he was being granted thanks to him living alongside Sherlock – how he liked his tea, the roll of his eyes when John insisted they watched the “Pointless” show, the flex of his toes and the hum of appreciation he gave when he finally agreed to break his fast after a 10-minute negotiation.
How he has whined about it, not realizing how important it was for his sister – “Seriously, Harry, we went through it a thousand times! Give me a break!”
Fortunately for his nerves, Hussein didn’t dwell on that, suggesting instead “How about I show you over the place? And then we’ll have a cup of tea in our little hut!”
“Don’t you understand?” Sherlock replied, his words ringing with sincerity. “Now is the start of our life together. I don’t care if you’re not going to last more than 30 seconds if I do that…”
Instead he has come onto the one man who could make him vanish without a trace.
He’s alive.
“What do you mean, there’s only one room left?” John asked with what he hoped was a winning smile, although he doubted it could somehow change the whole situation, which was quickly looking more and more like an impending disaster.
The soft whisper, contrasting with the unrestrained desire he could hear in Sherlock’s voice, elicited a whine from John’s mouth.
Without any remorse, he unfolded it.
“Come along, John!” he cried out, starting to run along the wall.
Without a care for Sherlock’s personal space, her companion came between them both, his hand outstretched.
The effect was immediate.
To his horror, Sherlock felt a hearty flush spreading across his face. He cleared his throat, trying to rally his faltering faculties.
“Wow. I didn’t know you considered me as so shallow…”
John found himself with a heavy, red-faced and very satisfied consulting detective in his lap.
A full flush was creeping across his face and John couldn’t meet Ross’ gaze as he awkwardly stammered out
Mycroft shrugged.
He looked at her with a puzzled expression.
It was the next logical step in the harasser’s escalating pattern. He has started by upsetting the women in
And if he wasn’t already feeling irritated at Sherlock’s attitude, Joan thought, the flow of rash words, each of them intended to demonstrate the fact that yes, she could read him like an open book, would surely deflate what was left of his ego.
She looked up, leaning on Sherlock’s shoulder.
No such luck, yet. It seemed that John has definitely lost his not so secret admirer. And this loss was starting to bother him immensely.
Frustrated, he stared at the last message.
Being held like this is heaven, he thought, before closing his eyes and falling asleep.
Hope you all enjoyed the story - and special thanks to my dear PatPrecieux! I really hope you like this :)
“I promise you, John,” Sherlock fervently replied. “I swear I’m…”
. It’s French. I don’t know why I hoped you would remember this time…”
But this time, he wouldn’t give in.
It was perfect.
“In your bed, I hope.”
“Oh! Sorry, I was lost in…Never mind. How can I help you, gentlemen?” Will asked, looking at Mike before his gaze flicked over John, who bit the inside of his cheek to avoid saying the first (and completely unsuitable, at least in public) answer which came to his mind.
John’s protest died in his throat when he felt Sherlock’s hand under his chin, tilting his face up. He took his mouth in an open-mouthed, toe-curling kiss. Tongues stroking each other, in a filthy, feverish dance of passion and lust.
Joan drew back a little, shivering with delight when she felt Sherlock helping her removing the shirt. Letting it fall to the ground.
Irritated frustration was gnawing at her.
Was it a gift from one of the children attending the community garden, too shy to give it personally? (but he didn’t really get the chance yet to spend time with them, so why would they give him a gift? It didn’t make sense.)
[Please. SH]
“On what I get in return, of course…”
Or clenched fists.
He heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath behind him and couldn’t help but looking over his shoulder and give him a saucy grin.
“Oh, fuck off, Greg!” Sally answered, glaring daggers first at the other sergeant, then at Sherlock. “I know you’re the Freak’s number one fan…”
He was brought back to reality by John’s worried voice, allowing himself the pleasure to gaze down at this man. Sherlock always had a fondness for blue eyes and combined with his nice, regular features, it was no wonder he has been drawn to him.
Sherlock was doing his best to put on an unconcerned front, but John wasn’t fooled in the least.
Sherlock frowned before reaching out, catching John’s belt loops in his long fingers and pulling him gently against him.
“I’ll see you later.”
I promise it'll get better very soon!
Whatever he has hoped – or dreaded – to find on his date’s face it wasn’t this amused, affectionate look solely directed at him.
He shook his head, determined to not be distracted by mushy thoughts.
“Nah, he’s just totally unpredictable, to say the least. And emotionally constipated to boot.”
As he scrolled down, the “Contact” link suddenly popped up off the page and he hastened to click on it… only to become mesmerized by the photo appearing on the screen.
Shit, John thought.
“I thought I had seen you earlier but surely you wouldn’t be caught dead in such a place and… Oh!”
Trigger warning - in this chapter a rape case is discussed. It isn't detailed or anything but I prefer warning you.
“Sherlock?”
Greg could have crowed with delight right now.
He groaned.
A man having lost his dearest friend."
“You’re a bossy one, aren’t you?”
“My name doesn’t really matter, you know.”
John stood up as well, peering doubtfully at his friend.
“You told me ‘later’… You… you flirted with me!”
“Hey, wait…”
Gosh, he hasn’t felt so awkward since he has been in his first year at university.
That softness was a dangerous thing.
“What the fuck are you talking about?”
participants.
The other woman’s eyes went round, surprise flitting in her gaze.
Let me forget you.
“You can be anyone you want, Rosie,” Papa whispered in her ear when watching the film. “Anything your little heart desires.”
Greg has heartily laughed, elbowing John good-naturedly in the ribs, before becoming serious again.
“I could fuck you like this, you know…”
Cherished. Treasured.
“A shame, that,” Greg cut him off, taking care of looking at him in the eye. “Because if you have listened to my last chat with John, you would have learned something which might have interested you…”
If the copper was going to act defensively, asking him in his “Don’t talk nonsense to me” voice – Mycroft was loath to admit it, but he always got a bit hard whenever he got the opportunity to hear Gregory barking commands – what he was doing here, fine then. He would get up, put on his best Iceman mask and go back to his flat, where he could privately nurse his wounded hope.
Receiving pleasure and giving it in spades.
“Breaking news – #CopperKiller arrested! Our reporter awaiting @NewScotlandYard official report. According to some sources, help of @ContactSH has been invaluable.”
Not expecting such enthusiasm, John let out a small yelp of surprise.
He was still debating whether to switch off the phone or to reply with a heartfelt “FUCK OFF” when a new message appeared on the screen.
“Neither was mine until… Well.”
Her hand on the door’s handle, she remained motionless, eyes closed. Fighting the urge to rush into their flat and to kick the intruder between his legs until his balls were nothing else than a mere souvenir.
“Send whom up?” he directly asked, his tiredness and annoyance at Anthea’s order without asking first for his approval colouring his voice.
“Simply because I’m telling you the truth. It won’t work with Shirley or whatever her name is…”
“You’re in luck, then,” Anthea replied with an amused quirk of her full lips. “One little signature at the bottom of this one… Very well done, Sir, I’ve always admired the way you finish signing with such a flourish, it really suits the “minor position in the government” character, you know…”
Joan tuned her out. She dodged Sherlock’s outstretched hand in a vain attempt to keep her at arm’s length. She wrapped instead delicate fingers around Sherlock’s arm, dragging her gently along until the other woman had no other choice but to sit down.
“I should hope so! What can you ever say to him? ‘Look John, I’m still alive, it’s all fine!”
John was so far gone he didn’t understand what was going on until he heard his lover tell him in a rough voice “You have five seconds to find yourself something to hold onto, John. And whatever you do, don’t let it go.”
Greg stared at him in amazement.
Or at least, you used to think so.
He watched the man who was certainly Sherlock, as he hasn’t bothered to introduce himself – and John was considered the rude one! – disappearing inside the house.
They won’t know what hit them!
Blue eyes wide open, not letting you go.
’s participants. Of course, it would be like open season for him, she thought with resentment.
“So I assume you’ve adopted your husband’s name?”
She quickly patted his hand.
“John.”
He barely heard and felt Sherlock pulling his zipper down, gasping when Sherlock’s hand finally found his prize.
“Wait a minute!” she cried “How am I supposed to…”
She shook his head, her fingers unconsciously checking that no stray lock of hair has escaped from her hijab, before replying “I just wanted to know if you were still interested in the next workshop on Sunday with the Elfrida society?”
Instead he forced himself to stay put and to wait for Mycroft’s answer.
Sherlock sighed, sat up at the end of the bed and, for once, forgot the etiquette he had painstakingly learned when he was a child – he let himself fall down against the soft coverlet.
“So… What do I do, now?”
“What? No! I mean the other one… Mycroft!”
I could just imagine your reaction if I said that aloud in your presence – waving your arms like a madman while ranting at me about the many inadequacies of the human nature.
** "I'll come up soon, I need to fetch the box for these gentlemen"
This part is more plotty than porny, I'm afraid, but rest assured I'll make it up to you later :)
Lost in his thoughts, a small smile on his lips, John didn’t hear at first the screams coming from inside the building.
His anger disappeared, leaving only in its wake an intense weariness.
With a more careful maintenance, he mused, this flat might turn out to be really fine. Appropriately located, with enough space for a grown man to…
“Are you serious?” Molly broke off. “Because if it’s a joke…”
Besides, the last texts were… sweet. Curious. Silly stuff which made his lips twitch and his fingers itch to type a reply.
voice.
John couldn’t help but wince.
“You…”
“Infinitely so.”
Sherlock’s thoughts crashed to a halt. What has this –
Despite her being breathless, she laughed. A hysterical sound, which was hurting her even though she couldn’t resist its lure.
John felt himself instinctively leaning in, he couldn’t resist, he was going to…
He can’t breathe. He can’t think. Surely he must be hallucinating the whole thing, there’s no other explanation.
John could imagine him shrugging, a resigned expression on his face.
“Really? That’s impressive. I’ve no idea that a project like yours could be so successful…”
He couldn’t stop himself. Revealing every bit, every information about John, who was staring open-mouthed at him.
John tried to ignore the little voice in his mind whispering that he would have caved in sooner or later to SH’s alluring messages.
He has barely set foot in his cramped little flat that John was already opening his laptop, addressing a fervent prayer to whatever deity was keen on listening to him right now.
He suddenly stopped when John popped up the little velvet box just before his nose.
“Sherlock…”
. John examined him for a few moments before walking to the bar, behind which Ross was once more standing. He glanced up at John, his smile not being as friendly as usual.
“It’s okay, really”, John said, already feeling a bit foolish.
“I told myself that if I didn’t have any luck with the men in there, I could always enjoy the bar and the dance floor. Seemed like a nice place to see if I could try my hand at chatting up women.”
“But I couldn’t care about all this.”
Startled, John turned around. Dave, who has jumped at the chance at retiring early after thirty-five years spent working for the British railway, as he has explained to John at length weeks ago, kindly smiled at him before limping closer to him.
He instinctively reacted, grasping the stiff material in his fingers and yanking it towards him. He only wanted to make Sherlock look at him, but he hasn’t counted on his own strength or on his date’s lapse of concentration. John found himself standing on tiptoe, nearly nose to nose with Sherlock, his laughter dying in his throat.
“John!”
He was lucky. So lucky.
“My birth name is Sylvain Palmeri. I was born as a male. Be assured that I wouldn’t bore you with all the little details of my personal story if they didn’t concern the reason for which you’re here. Three years ago, I decided to start my physical transition. I spoke about it quite freely with my family and friends. They already knew that I was transgender and they supported me in “going all the way”, as they said. Except for one person – my brother, Serge.”
He drew back just enough to lick John’s slick, swollen lips with teasing touches. He leaned in a bit more, nipping the soft skin of his neck, smothering a groan when John moaned and tilted his head up to leave him better access.
“Keep your gratitude for my ever-meddling brother,” he automatically retorted. “I’m only here because he’s paying the whole trip.”
A sharp sound echoing in his heart, as he mourned his stillborn hope of being able to acknowledge his true self, of leaving the closet.
online chat rooms. Then he has hacked their accounts on the website and threatened them if they dared to complain.
Wasn’t it a stellar record?
“Of course! Never been better!”
In spite of his increasing annoyance at his bastard of a best friend, John had to admit the DI has played it perfectly. No doubt his soon-to-be husband has briefed him beforehand.
Oh god. He was a complete mess. He glanced up hopelessly at the bartender who was remaining silent, an eyebrow raised. His expression was stern, but not totally devoid of sympathy. He finally sighed.
“Do you really think I was going on a date with this guy?”
“No, no, no! I can’t talk to you right now!” Sherlock cut him off, his voice booming indignantly in the receiver. Mycroft immediately took the phone away from his ear, pulling a wry face. He knew that his brother’s manners were not quite up to the mark, but to reply in such a way…
Of course it backfired when John’s gaze lingered on his mouth.
John doesn’t let him finish. He turns round, straddling his friend – his lover, his mind whispers – and finally gives free rein to every one of his instincts regarding Sherlock.
“Very well, Mister Holmes. As I was saying, I’m sure you’re a very busy man, so I’ll be brief. This pub is my territory and I don’t allow anyone to harass my clients, whether they’re family or not.”
“Irene, stop that!”
“We’ll talk later,” he growls before leaning on his knees.
Their kiss has been one of the most wonderful things Sherlock has ever experienced in his life, something which felt right and natural, but obviously it hasn’t been the same for John.
You faithfully observed this.
The feeling of being finally naked, his intimacy exposed to Sherlock’s gaze… It should have been frightening. John has never been totally at ease with his former lovers, preferring to take the lead and taking them apart in an attempt to preserve himself. And he has always succeeded in doing so. Why was it so different with Sherlock?
John refused to cower however.
“Now is the time for one of
“Auto-ignition safes,” Sherlock absentmindedly answered. “If you attempt to break into it, what’s inside will immediately be destroyed.”
He hoped for John’s sake they would be allowed to tell all about it on the blog afterwards.
Mycroft snorted at this, being naturally reminded of the laughter Anthea and him had shared over Trump’s latest tweet.
Great, now he was babbling. He fought the temptation to roll his eyes at his own stupidity and focused on his companion. He didn’t dare looking at John – no need after all, he could quite well deduce what his silence meant.
He cleared his throat.
He wanted them to go back to his flat, to close the door and…
You’ve learned not to be greedy. To enjoy life’s little gifts – or not so little, as far as John was concerned.
Really, Sherlock, did you ever realise I loved everything about you? Even when you were rude to grieving parents, even when you snarled a terse reply to me (“
In retrospect, I should have known.
“Mycroft, I swear to you, if anything happens between… between…”
He let out a loud laugh, remembering those first days of divorced/once again bachelor life, when he has been determined to enjoy one night stands while keeping an absolute freedom.
John only nodded, looking completely dazed.
“You’re dead.”
He carefully ignored the counter arguments his treacherous heart was coming out with and washed his glass before putting it again in the cupboard.
To think that he has been so terribly afraid he has only listened to the voice in his head “Don’t watch them, they don’t matter” while such a man has been staring at him all along…
John bit his lip, hesitant about whether coming clean to Sherlock and betraying Greg’s confidence or remaining silent, at the risk of Sherlock misunderstanding his last text and taking offence at something which wasn’t meant for him…
Joan swallowed heavily, torn between raging arousal and the need to reassure Sherlock, who certainly wasn’t used to this kind of intimacy.
His cheeks were burning. Oh, if Mycroft could see him right now… Sherlock gritted his teeth.
Moriarty has used him to get to Sherlock, to try to make him bend to his will.
“No. You won’t succeed in intimidating me. Not this time.”
“Oh no… Let me guess, you called Mycroft, gloated over what happened in his office and generally irritated the shit out of him, is that right?”
She flicked the switch on, gasping when the bruise on Sherlock’s right cheekbone was revealed to its full extent.
Somehow it made things even worse. Everybody has been involved – except her.
“Yes Sherlock?”
John’s blood ran suddenly cold.
At least till John’s so-called friends arrived here.
“You spoke to her?” he asked without thinking, his question echoing in the silent flat. He immediately winced right afterwards, cursing his impulsiveness. Harry must have seen it on his face because she gave a dry chuckle.
He felt all his guards, all the masks he would more or less willingly put on dropping at his feet. He was opening up, laying himself bare to this man’s gaze.
The sole reply he received was a disbelieving snort.
“Okay, Mister Will or Sherlock, whatever your name is… You asked me to follow you here and I did. Now I believe I’m ready to hear what you have to say.”
“God, Irene. Would you drop it?”
“Calm down, Molly,” she said in a soothing voice. “I guarantee you have done nothing wrong.”
“Good for him, then. Don’t see why it mattered.”
“Outch!”
“Dance with me, John.”
Meriem gave him a light swat with a towel.
He let out a humourless chuckle.
He got up, pulled back a little before turning and walking away.
His first meeting with Sherlock.
John smothered a snort, thinking of the Mrs Hudson’s joke about his old Browning. Now wasn’t really the time to say it aloud, even in jest.
Harry, who has pulled back a little in surprise, cut him off with a mocking snort.
Of course, it hasn't been easy. They both had to endure jeers and homophobic slurs. John lost his so-called friends and was bullied for a brief time at university until the authorities decided to listen to him and took his case seriously. Sherlock learned how to be civil to John's relatives - not always an easy task, considering what he has already deduced in their regard concerning how they've treated his partner before.
He has just finished typing “Nothing ever happens to me” – the only sentence he could think of and wasn’t it a depressing thought? – when his mobile chimed. John frowned. He wasn’t yet quite used to Harry’s gift – or hand-me-down, more likely.
– alone, walking to Angelo’s where Sherlock has suggested to grab a bite. He had no idea what to say. Or rather how to say it.
“I have gathered,” Mycroft drily retorted. “But what for? Getting a leg over at the end of the day?”
Good lord, what has he done?
It took John several seconds to understand. When he finally did, he didn't even try to stop the big, goofy smile creasing his lips.
“He called you?” he asked, heart in his throat.
“You’re a tough bitch, darling…”
John licked his lips.
And cultivating fruit and vegetables here in the middle of London? He considered it quite a feat – or a bloody miracle!
Will was standing back to the bar, examining the persons taking part with an intensity that John would have found disconcerting if he hadn’t felt so jealous of it.
“Don’t be,” the DI retorted. “At least I know where I stand right now. Pining from afar has never been my style, after all.”
You are warned.
Once they returned in the main room, the other woman has scanned the crowd with an inquisitive look, frowning when she noticed Sherlock and the fair-haired man with him weren’t there.
“Next time then.”
He lowered his head as a single word – “No” – was dancing before his eyes.
Ice Man.
Gasping for air, baring his neck to Sherlock, who shamelessly took advantage of it, rubbing his stubble against John’s sensitive neck before sucking on it mercilessly.
“I would rather you say mine,” Sherlock whispered. “In the loudest voice you can muster.”
Exactly what he was hoping for.
A loud thump behind the closed door brought him back to the present reality – which was turning out to be very complicated indeed, if Sherlock persisted in refusing to hear him out.
With trembling fingers she pulled her phone from her bag and typed as quickly as she could.
“Beautiful,” he whispered.
He glanced at Sherlock’s closed-off face.
pirate!)
The chances of that happening were slim to none and both of them knew it. Without ever turning round, thanks to a mirror judiciously hung up on the wall, Mycroft saw in Mr Smith’s hunched shoulders and weak reply – “Of course, Sir” - the confirmation that he was perfectly aware that he has displeased his employer.
It was to be expected, after all, when a young woman was working for a middle-aged, die hard bachelor such as himself. Such were the ways of this sexist, heteronormative society, when one couldn’t see a single woman in company with a man without imagining a sexual relationship blooming between them, Mycroft thought with a resigned sigh.
A bip cut him off. Greg has ended the call.
He slightly turned his head on the right.
John heard Greg’s hitch in his breath over the phone before he asked in a voice which has managed to lose in a second all its previous warmth.
“Oh, please. It would be very unfair of me to deprive the other players of this particular laurel wreath,” Mycroft retorted, deadpan.
There it was, the same hesitancy John felt earlier reappearing in SH’s voice.
“I’m so glad we finally see eye to eye,” he forced himself to reply.
Yew or
“I read your last texts and I couldn’t not reply to you.”
Sherlock found himself at a loss – how has it turned so awkward so fast between them? He swallowed hard, his mouth turning dry and he made a conscious effort to open his mouth, his words forcing their way out.
“As if I could,” he whispered.
He has intended it as a playful question, something they could both use to carry on flirting and getting into each other’s pants. But Sherlock didn’t look like he has got the memo. Instead, he was considering John with a serious look.
“Enough”, Sherlock growled. “Stop it!”
Easier to love as well.
Truth was, he has forgotten that anyone could see him as someone to be relied upon. Especially after the incident with Nurse Idiot, three weeks ago.
“Already winded, John? May I recommend some exercise from now on? It’ll be easy, even for a former…”
Mrs Hudson frowned, examining it.
in those clear eyes (Were they blue? Green? Something else?).
“Shhhh….”
He knew that no one wanted to see a love story, as beautiful as it might be, between two men, whether on the screen or in reality. Homosexual relationships were secret stories, cloaked in fleeting shadows. They were not talking about love and affection, but base lust and physical relief – hands, cocks, lips, arses. It was nothing else than that, John was convinced of it.
“Oh.” John remained silent during a few seconds. Sherlock glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. His companion seemed deep in thought, his fingers absently stroking his chin. He had nice hands, Sherlock noticed, a strong and steady grip.
This time, he was truly infuriated.
“John, John! Gav… I mean Grant… Oh fuck, what’s your name again? Oh, never mind then! That man over there has asked me to make a speeeeeech!”
Hope you all enjoy this last chapter!
Sherlock rolled his eyes before cutting off the drunk DI.
“If I’m a consulting detective – the only one in the world, for your information – you can be whatever you want to be.”
“Don’t tell me you brought me here to make small talk!”
Hell, didn’t he ask John, when they first met, to come with him because he needed his medical expertise?
She could hear faint squishing sounds. The only lamp in the room cast her light on her lover, revealing her milky white skin and the wet traces on the inside of her thighs.
Sherlock waited for two extremely long minutes, their footsteps echoing on the walls around them, before stopping and staring at John.
John stopped when the subdued light of his torch shone down on one of the garden’s main alleys.
A fact of which he was perfectly aware, considering his parting words to her
“Hush.”
He suddenly imagined Mister Calendar over there lying down on his bed, squirming and moaning while John was sucking him off.
“Sherlock, I was only away for half an hour at the most that day. When I came back, you already were two sheets to the wind.”
“Of course we don’t.”
A faint smile bloomed on John’s lips.
“Oh please,” Sherlock instinctively retorted. “He has already been through much worse as far as I’m concerned. I should tell you the night when…”
“Bring the box.”
A man was killed, two others were left for dead and Sherlock seemed to have disappeared into thin air.
"Are you?"
“Let me get this straight, so to speak – You were thinking I was living with Sherlock and going with him when he had a case simply because… ?”
He was beyond hope, he thought, seating down at a cosy table for two.
“Yes, love?”
mad bastard,” his lover answered.
Into battle, he thought before going out of his flat.
She had no idea why Sherlock was so convinced she stood a chance with her, should Irene ever ask her out.
“Fine!” Sherlock cried out. “Leave me here on my own, then! You’d better go now, you wouldn’t like to be late for
You don’t know anymore.
“Like what?”
“If you care so deeply about the persons you just mentioned… Don’t breathe a word about it to anyone.”
He finally took advantage of a crossroads, near the garden’s gate, to tackle the stranger, rolling with him on the ground.
Or rather – how they managed not to fall in the stairs while they attacked each other in a frenzy of filthy kisses, wet sounds echoing in the stairwell, and gropes which turned from sensual to downright pornographic. Besides his iron biceps, Sherlock must have magic fingers – it was the only explanation John’s lust-addled brain has found for the fact that his companion succeeded in unzipping his jeans and half-unbuttoning his shirt while carrying him upstairs.
“I don’t like blondes.”
good-looking.”
“Of course, I’m going to miss your company. Would have been nice to see you at your best, all dressed up. I might even have been tempted by some… quality time in a closet or elsewhere.”
Sherlock immediately released him, hands raised, before stepping back.
“Oh you mean this?” he asked, pointing out the harpoon. “Don’t mind it, it’s an experiment.”
“Now, if you would excuse me, I have other pressing matters to attend…”
John stared at the room’s entrance, wondering whether or not he wanted to follow Sherlock.
So, they wanted to see him? Very well. They would see him indeed – but on his own turf.
Could she tell? Has her supposed gaydar pinged suddenly in John’s presence, warning her that her coward of a little brother, after having repeatedly ignored Sherlock’s gaze on him, has finally decided to get in touch with him?
It was a good thing, Sherlock mused, that he didn’t need any words to know what was going on in John’s mind. Opening his mouth and letting the words he has long kept for himself finally tumbling out has never felt so easy.
Molly, who fell in love with the worst persons – all male – ever yet still believed in happy endings.
She paid no attention to his protest, her vivid gaze focused on him.
“Mmmm?”
“None of this, I’m afraid.”
How has he never realized how truly beautiful the man was?
He has barely closed the room’s door behind him when he heard footsteps coming closer.
“Let’s come in my office,” she invited them inside.
She was only a few feet away from him and getting closer when Sherlock raised his head and spotted her. In other circumstances Irene would have found his dismayed look, quickly replaced by a smile as fake as her own, very amusing but now it only enraged her further.
He panicked. Fear got its claws into him, and before he could think about it, he found himself shaking his head.
He couldn’t believe his ears.
He has never come harder in his life.
“Yeah, right,” John softly said before clearing his throat and pasting on a smile. “Lead the way, then!”
“Of course, genius.”
[Forward my messages to 7880 804545. SH]
And he couldn’t do this, couldn’t be like her, he was safe, he loved girls as well!
“I don’t normally reply to texts from strangers. I don’t know why I made an exception for you. But I’m glad I did.”
Should he wait? Should he go? Has he been a fool to believe Sherlock, to let him go so far under his skin John wasn’t even sure he could remove everything that has occurred between them?
He put his hand on his holster in a vain attempt to shrug off the loneliness creeping over him.
“Bayswater station. Please mind the gap” echoed in the whole carriage.
He was truly stuck, John acknowledged with a wry grin, as he followed Sherlock in Amboise’s streets, ignoring completely the tourists milling around in the picturesque alleys.
Sherlock remained silent, head bent over the kettle.
It seemed that the smile and the teasing voice had the desired effect, as Mycroft blinked at him, before giving a slight nod.
And now for our second participant... *grin*
Before she could answer however, Sherlock broke in
Molly looked at her dubiously.
“Hush. My turn to speak. You’ve been honest with me, I’ll gladly do the same if you don’t mind,” he softly said, a teasing smile quirking up his lips.
And John… John was bitterness and sweetness at the same time, a hand on your knee, a “Anyone but him”, a monster roaring in pain, a life-saving hand when you’ve lost all hope.
Sherlock’s hand against her cheek was so warm. It would be so easy to forget all this and take comfort from this simple touch. But Joan knew it wouldn’t dissipate all the doubts and misunderstandings which seemed to brew between them.
“I didn’t think you could turn out to be even more attractive than I thought, but obviously I was wrong,” John said with a roguish smile.
But that’s not the point of this letter, is it?
They remained motionless, gazing into each other’s eyes, a silent exchange taking place between them.
“A common trait in the Holmes family, I believe.”
Sherlock’s mouth went dry, his mind suddenly invaded by images which were very difficult to banish and forget.
It was on the tip of his tongue to volley back something hurtful, something insulting at this man who was judging him without knowing him, lashing out at him in anger and fear. But the words got stuck in his throat and all he could say was
She fought to keep her face impassive, even when Sherlock gave a loud sigh, clearly betraying his surrender.
He hasn’t intended it to sound so flirty. But Greg couldn’t question the fact that seeing Mycroft’s gaze darkening in front of him was a most
“How do you know me?”
John nodded, not trusting his voice. He fidgeted, looking around without seeing anything, while Ross poured out the cheap beer. It wasn’t yet rush hour at the pub and apart from some regular customers minding their own business or watching the telly, he was quite alone at the bar.
“When you kissed me in there… I felt like it was Christmas and my birthday all in one, you know. But then I realized I haven’t talked to you. I haven’t told you what I wanted from you. And getting physical right from the start, taking the other’s feelings for granted and believing he has the same intents as you? Not a mistake I’m willing to make. Not with you.”
And then she saw her. Chestnut hair piled into a high bun, a light make-up which set off her deep brown eyes and a black trouser suit which made her ass perfectly mouth-watering – Molly Hooper was stunning.
“I assume they managed to open this so called cryptex?”
And he felt his mouth go dry when he met the former soldier’s dark, heated gaze.
As he was threading his way among the trees and other shrubs, trying not to trample plants which could easily be damaged, he felt a trickle of sweat running the length of his spine. Of course during his military career as well as when he went out with Sherlock, he has taken part in many stakeouts, hoping that someone – or something – would finally break off the never-ending wait.
“Come on,” Mycroft whispered, leaning in until his lips were grazing Greg’s cheek, “Let me tell you all about it…”
He has tried to be as gentle as possible with this awful reminder, but it didn’t stop Mycroft from flushing crimson. He looked down at his hands folded in his lap.
was playing constantly in John’s mind, fuelling with every word his overwhelming desire, making him forget every trace of caution or restraint.
— Didn’t we finally agree on using “Gregory” and “Mycroft” the last time we met?
“No!” John cried out “It wasn’t… I mean…”
A single word which broke the spell.
When he was waiting for John to give his final statement to the DI, he has wondered why this ordinary-looking man, with his patched-up old leather jacket, a blue jumper that Sherlock’s dad would not have disowned, grey-blond hair which didn’t seem to know the benefit of conditioner, has succeeded where all the others – including some of the most seductive men Sherlock had ever the pleasure to meet – have failed.
“Wait, you mean…”
“You got this so wrong…” he muttered, hands clenched.
That’s not a word Sherlock often used, especially as far as John was concerned. Sherlock could show his regard and affection in many ways, but for him to say out loud such a thing… John was completely amazed.
He felt sweat beading on his brow suddenly. Why was she… observing him like this? Could she tell that… ?
“What?” Harry asked before joining him and looking over his shoulder.
“Seriously?” Harry cut him off with a chortle. “Are you even listening to yourself, Johnny? We’re not ten anymore. Believe it or not, “trying to get back at you” as you said is not on my list of priorities!”
That voice should be forbidden.
He grinned.
Sherlock reached down, cupping John’s arse in his palms and smiling when he felt his companion returning the favour.
“Wait.”
WARNING FOLKS!
A moan escaped Sherlock’s lips, barely audible in the club’s noisy atmosphere.
“What are you…?”
“Oh okay. If you want to know, I decided to stop playing coy with his Pompousness. I’ve put my cards on the table and tell him exactly what I was thinking of him. And what I would like to do
[Had a row with a chip-and-pin machine. Ruddy nuisances, aren’t they? SH]
John couldn’t help but smile at this scene. They were reminding him of Sherlock and him – at least when his friend wasn’t doing his best to impersonate Mister-Warning-I’ll-bite-you-if-you-come-closer.
“I see your manners haven’t improved. Or is that special treatment only intended for me?”
“Don’t follow him. Can’t you see he’s a freak, a madman? He doesn’t care one whit about you!”
“I’m glad to be here, with you.”
“Quite right! Emma has told me a lot about you…”
“Yeah… Sorry, I’m not usually so clumsy!”
It wasn’t time anymore to dwell on the past and lament his friend’s death.
“That’s rich, coming from someone who claimed that ‘girlfriends are not his area!’”
He clenched the edge of the washbasin in his hands.
Two hours later, he got a complete phone number. The forget-me-nots, which have been sown in large clumps all over the garden, have given him quite the headache, but fortunately for his nerves, the red camellia and the bluebells were easier, each of them having been planted in specific locations.
“You better pray being put under lock and key. Otherwise, I’ll find you and make you regret ever thinking of assaulting women.”
Lips parted, soft wonder written on his features, as if he couldn’t believe that they were still holding hands.
“Detective Inspector! I insist…”
Gosh. If John has thought Sherlock’s current onslaught on his senses has been devastating, it was nothing though compared to this.
“Sorry, Greg, not in the mood for chasing skirt tonight. What’s up at the Yard?”
Silence fell across them before Greg broke it with a chortle.
“But unlike you, John, I’m able to multitask,” Sherlock retorted, his voice sending a very unwelcome right now tendril of heat curling up in John’s groin.
“And that’s the whole problem, isn’t it?” he whispered to himself.
“You’re so much like him…”
“Fuck off, Harry.”
John has remained frozen for a second or two, blinking at his flatmate who has so casually uttered this word.
“They didn’t stop him from hitting you!” she retorted.
But how could he not when the object of his curiosity revealed himself to be so fascinating?
“Oh, that’s rich coming from you!”
“It was,” Sherlock replied. “I was asking if you trust me.”
Unable to bear any longer Sherlock's focus, John averted his gaze, looking down at the filth under his shoes. Gosh. What a place to come out and declare his feelings to this man! He suddenly felt angry with himself - he should have done more, should have taken him to dinner, in a posh, nice place, some restaurant with soft lights and hushed conversations.
“Oh my God,” Sherlock nearly screeched, “don’t say “Mycroft” and “sex” in the same sentence ever again!”
He was interrupted by “Would you like to get dinner?”
John proposing to Mary.
He waited during a few seconds, his ears pricking up at the slightest sound, but to no avail.
He wondered how to bring up the question before deciding to take the bull by the horns, so to speak.
“They’re as perfect as you are,” Sherlock whispered in her ear before lowering her head and kissing the other breast. She opened her mouth, tonguing the areola until it was wet with saliva.
The stranger clicked his tongue in annoyance. Then, with a swiftness that John didn’t expect, he knocked the gun out of John’s hand.
For sole answer, her lover pulled her forward until Joan’s legs were caging her head.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
John looked up at his date contritely.
, he became instantly aware of the gazes turned in his direction. He didn’t dare looking at the little group he knew was at the counter – not yet, anyway. He waved at Ross, wiping off a glass behind the bar and who always got a friendly smile for him.
But he didn’t have time to add anything else as he heard the DI mumbling
A victorious glint gleamed in Mycroft’s clear gaze as he added
Sherlock’s voice becomes raspier, his fingers slowly stroking John’s.
Greg refused to be intimidated though.
“Oooh, you’ve got a nasty temper, doctor Watson…”
Should he give himself away and risk losing everything – the Baker Street flat, the thrilling chases around London and first and foremost, the very companionship which has saved his life?
“I never thought I would see the day when…”
She switched her phone off. Let her have the last word – even if it was rather petty of her.
He shook his head.
John frowned. He supposed Mycroft could have pulled this trick on him… but why? After Sherlock’s death, he hasn’t heard of Mycroft anymore and anyway this kind of cryptic message – if it was really one – wasn’t like him.
Someone somewhere was laughing at him for sure.
And the sudden possessiveness in his voice warmed up John enough that he had to smother a besotted smile.
Greg gave a great sigh and crossed his arms, looking at the other crossly.
It was only when he heard a deep breath followed by a mumbled “Outch” that he realized it was too late to flee.
“You’re a right prat, you know. I really hope you haven’t made a mess even worse than what it already was…”
“Actually, you are. And consider yourself lucky you didn’t break your neck falling down these stairs.”
She saw Sherlock grinding his teeth, his jaw set in an angry line. A shadow of his old self, a sight which gave her enough strength to stop laughing and say “I warn you, Sherlock Holmes. If you ever hurt again John, Greg or Mrs Hudson, there’ll be hell to pay.”
It was a low blow, really, but what else could he do?
“You want to know why I left you out?” she nearly growled these words.
“Oh… God…”
It was…
In truth, she was seething.
So, the Russian crisis seemed to have been brought to an efficient end, Mycroft thought, trying not to look like he was a little bit frightened by Anthea’s mischievous smile and missing it by a mile, if his assistant’s cat-got-the-cream expression was anything to go by.
It was said with a hint of challenge, something which pleased Sherlock enough to make him retort
as best man…”
Dave shrugged.
Sherlock didn’t waste any time unclasping her bra, revealing her small, perfectly round boobs. Joan removed with ease the sports bra she was wearing. Her breasts were heavier, fuller, her large pink nipples getting hard and pointed up.
Too late.
Joan gave a loud sigh. It became so difficult to sort herself out. Sometimes she was tempted to forget every caution, to kneel at Sherlock’s feet when she was sitting in the sofa and to whisper in her ear
Irene didn’t answer. It was on the tip of her tongue to ask Molly if she had met any man interesting enough to deserve a second glance, although she had no right to know.
Greg.
“You mean, the single-bed one?”
An understatement, John has thought, but he wasn’t willing to wax poetic about Sherlock, Greg might end up having a stroke.
From frantic and unsure, the kiss turned firmer and more sensual.
– mother hen.
“I’m too old for this…”
“I learned from the best,” he retorted, giving her a conniving wink. “So, do you agree? Shall we shake hands on it?”
Sherlock’s shout rendered him speechless. Which left him unfortunately perfectly able to hear Martha’s gasp or the teenagers tittering at his friend’s outburst. But Sherlock ignored them all. He once again turned round in his seat, his gaze holding John prisoner.
Muse is having a lot of fun tormenting these two idiots and I clearly can't resist her...
Reading this rendered John motionless, mouth agape with incredulity.
Her fingers threaded into her pubic hair, dropping lower. Joan felt her mouth go dry. Sherlock opened her legs a little, just enough so Joan could see her fingers slipping in her sex.
The mirthless laugh which followed confirmed what he already suspected. John stopped walking, unsure as how to behave. What has happened between these two?
He shook his head and his pain was so clear to see Sherlock found in himself the necessary strength to try to soothe him.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
A warm puff on his naked, wet skin. John shivers.
... Don't kill me, please?
“Not before you give me answers!”
She shook her head. This time, she wouldn’t give Sherlock the opportunity to derail their discussion. She would stay focused.
Gosh, he really was pathetic, mooning over someone when he didn’t even know his name…
“Sex!” Greg cried out in a louder voice than intended.
Tongue dancing against Sherlock’s, exploring the sweetness of this mouth he has so often dreamed of, teeth pulling delicately Sherlock’s lower lip, John tried to pour in this kiss everything he has ever felt for the crazy guy he was holding so strongly in his arms.
He is suddenly wrapped up in a warm embrace. Strong arms tighten their grip round him.
That Mycroft
Another hallucination, then.
Hearing once again Greg’s soft, heated voice, each of his words ringing true and engraving itself on Mycroft’s heart.
His unexpected friend, the flatmate who was always there, nudging him into eating, taking care of him.
The blow hit him as surely as this bullet all these years ago in Afghanistan.
He sagged a little further into his plastic seat. Fortunately for him, who didn’t like the crowded, cramped places since Afghanistan and Sherlock’s mood, there were only a few people besides them in the carriage – a group of teenagers obviously playing truant and an old couple bickering over who was going to prepare what for supper.
Disconcerted by his reaction, Molly went back a few steps. Faced with this man, his unwillingness to understand, whether real or fake, how his behaviour has deeply hurt those who loved him, she found herself recoiling in disgust.
Her Daddy’s voice sounds a bit strained. Maybe he has caught a cold? If she was still talking to him, Rosie would tell him to go to Mrs Hudson - she has cough drops.
“John… What are you…?”
“Well, with a bit of luck, we might both now enjoy a free evening! The last one before New Year’s Eve in fact.” She turned to him, a teasing smile creasing her lips. “So, what should be tonight’s programme, Sir? Perfecting your already flawless Korean for next month’s official visit? Taking part in a chess online tournament?”
, you sitting at the bar, ignoring me while your

’s walls.
“I warn you, that shower is a real disaster, barely any pressure in it and how dare they saying that it is a comfortable hotel, I… John?”
If anyone has made the mistake to think he was easy prey, he would make them pay dearly for it.
“I read your letter.”
“Sherlock?” John repeated, who seemed completely lost.
She started walking away, nearly missing in her haste his whispered “Thank you”.
Doubt briefly flared in his mind – what if Sherlock didn’t like what he saw? What if John definitely lost his ability to trust others at the same time he was shot in Afghanistan?
His heart rate increased and he rolled his eyes straight away. Somebody sends him a text and there he was, behaving like a giddy schoolboy with a crush! If Harry could see him right now, she would have laughed her head off – as always, the epitome of tact.
The first time he has killed for him.
Has he become, without knowing it, the subject of one of Mycroft’s operations?
“Successful?” he repeated. “Do you mean he would have found…?”
She took a deep breath.
“Don’t be so crass. And I should be lucky if John wants to speak to me again after the stunt you’ve pulled!”
“And getting an addiction to sugar in the process?” Sherlock drily commented. “Thanks but no thanks!”
“As you wish,” Sherlock replied before doing his best to make John go crazy with lust.
“Let’s indeed,” she replied before seating in her chair.
Strong fingers gently gripping her chin left her speechless. She looked up. Sherlock’s blue-green gaze held her prisoner. There was no trace of amusement in her voice when she asked
“Oh… Oh… Harder, please!”
“I come back because you asked me to. Because I couldn’t read your letter without calling myself a fool and a bloody idiot. I have been so selfish, leaving you behind, letting you believe that…”
[For once in his life, Mycroft was right – caring is not an advantage. SH]
He reflexively clenched his fists.
What if half the team at NSY barely seemed to tolerate his presence, even with Lestrade’s help?
John stared wide-eyed at the number.
A deliciously devilish idea.
Looking up, Joan saw that bright smile disappear in a flash and annoyance briefly shining in Sherlock’s gaze.
Raised voices startled them both. A boisterous group, dressed to the nines, was quickly approaching.
“He no longer wants to remain anonymous, an unknown “shadow behind his computer screen” like he said in one of his lasts messages… He intends to be in the front row when it comes to experience his victims’ fear and anguish,” Sherlock concluded with a disgusted frown.
John shook his head. No. No. He couldn’t believe. This way lay madness and everlasting shame. He didn’t want to end up like Harry, did he?
Yeah, right.
Ross winked at him.
A wave of absolute horror washed over the detective as he finally understood who has been called “a bastard”.
“What now?”
“It would certainly appear like he did, yes. (Mrs Dubusson glanced at John and took pity on him.) In his letter, my brother said that after my declaration concerning the probability of the Mona Lisa’s hypothesis, he has made an investigation on his own, which was ultimately successful.”
“Hush. I never have had a foolish idea, something that you as my associate should know full well.”
He breathed in sharply when he felt this featherlike touch.
Molly shook her head, giving a light laugh.
He switched off the computer and rushed to the bathroom, ignoring the way his heart was jumping into triple time.
And you smell like him too, he thought, biting his tongue not to say it aloud.
An empty threat if she ever heard one, but she already felt better saying it.
’s sight, padding along to the tiny bathroom. The crude light made him blink and he cringed with embarrassment from his reflection in the mirror.
, Harry’s voice echoed in his mind.
He couldn't wait.
She shrugged.
He swallowed hard, not daring to look away from Sherlock's gaze.
John was sure he was grinning like an utter fool but couldn’t bring himself to care. Instead he stroked these strong, utterly delectable thighs.
She could admit he was right.
“And you, John. You’ve been a great help.” Mrs Hudson added with a faint smile.
She smothered a grin behind her list. Looking at people hitting on Sherlock who, for all his earlier experience, didn’t know how to deal with amorous advances, especially when he would like to reciprocate them, never ceased to be funny.
He nudged the door of the 221b open, wondering how he could get his hand on another mobile without arousing suspicion of the criminals who might keep an eye on him, when a small packet on the kitchen table attracted his attention. He moved closer. A handwritten message was lying upon it.
A small gesture with such wonderful consequences, he found out after John raised his head in surrender, baring his neck to Sherlock’s avid mouth.
“I’m shocked, Irene. I would have thought stalking and getting our harasser arrested would be exciting enough for you.”
“Even so. I knew I wouldn’t get an apology.”
No, Sherlock would stay as she always was in front of a potential client – aloof and attentive at the same time, her green gaze unwaveringly fixed on the man in front of her.
Cherry on this particular cake – the kohl on his eyelids, mascara highlighting his clear gaze, without forgetting the glitter on his cheekbones… and a bit elsewhere, really.
The illusion’s face was flushed, it has closed its eyes as if it couldn’t bear the sight of Greg and he fell his stomach giving a sickening lurch.
“What are they used for?” John asked, rubbing his hands.
Noticing the woman’s hand on him.
Sherlock swore loudly before complying. John wrapped a hand around his cock, jerking it, keeping pace with Sherlock’s harder thrusts. His heart is beating a furious tempo in his chest, the pleasure is flooding his body and he’s close, so close…
The “two missed calls” notification on the mobile screen seemed to laugh at him.
“Go ahead.”
Sherlock falters before resuming “Will you stay?”
lower than that! – John fisted both hands in Sherlock’s coat, pulling him down until this damned luscious mouth of Sherlock was within his reach and managed to completely lose himself in the heated, hungry, bruising kiss which ensued.
The silence between them, tinged with remorse and forgiveness, turned sensual, becoming more and more sexually charged – at least for Joan.
“Don’t know if we’ll make it,” Sherlock panted in his ear.
“Molly’s here,” she said between clenched teeth. “I hope for your sake that’s not your idea of a joke…”
Sherlock's gaze flicked all over him. John wondered what he was seeing. Deducing.
“Right.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
She knew that the longer she was standing here, under Sherlock’s ever attentive gaze, the more she was giving herself away. No doubt her flatmate could read in the angry line of her jaw, her refusal to meet her eyes all the feelings she has stubbornly ignored until now.
They were all idiots, John smugly thought, swiftly walking round them in order to better follow Sherlock. The best, most fascinating thing those people would ever had the good fortune to glimpse was striding along them, his ever-changing gaze currently focused on his mobile.
“Sorry, didn’t realize you were miles away! (He pointed John’s empty glass out.) Just wanted to know if you were up for another round…”
– before ordering him to open these damn long legs of his and finally – finally! – slipping inside…
Mister Curls. That was still nice. Sherlock has been called worse, that’s for sure. He smiled to himself while glancing outside. At this hour, night has already fallen and passers-by were but mere shadows, fleetingly going past the
Harry didn’t belong – she never has.
He has been right – it was fascinating.
“No guarantees here, mate. One thing for sure – you won’t know until you ask.”
And now to plan the next story... Another romcom mineseries or a kind of superhero romance?
Irene’s fingers hovered over the keyboard.
“Yeah?” he croaked.
Time to jump off the proverbial bridge.
At the same time, he reached down and cupped John’s arse in his hands.
“I would believe it when I know where both of you are,” Greg retorted in a tone tinged with disbelief.
He may mean it as an affectionate comeback, a sentence worthy of some melodramatic finale, when the comrades-in-arms get reunited at last. But John can only hear the raw desperation of his voice. The unintended cruelty hiding in that question hits him like a ton of bricks and John finds himself suddenly stripped of every mask, every façade he could ever hope to put on. He lets out a broken sob. His legs give way, he stumbles against the rim of the bathtub. He barely feels the sharp pain in his kneecap, his mind, his heart struggling with the sudden grief and incomprehension.
“Caring is not an advantage,” Mycroft has whispered in your ear, one day. He has just come back from the uni, you were still a child. At this time, you didn’t know the exact circumstances, you merely deduced your brother’s feelings have been grievously hurt.
Sherlock didn’t reply. John could just imagine him at that moment, looking intently at the door between them.
“I’m still here”, Joan whispered, her lips brushing against Sherlock’s skin.
Now, John thought, before I lost my courage again.
Greg huffed a soft laugh before becoming serious again.
She let out a soft “Oh!” before grasping it gently between her fingers. John blanched when he saw it was one of the berries having been glued before to the wooden little car he still got in his pocket. It must have come unstuck when he was walking home, he thought.
“Find yourself another fool to give your bloody message, then. I quit.”
Right now.
He straightened up, slowly walking to John until they were nearly touching. John swallowed with an audible gulp, getting himself lost in the pale gaze focused on him. Sherlock’s behaviour seemed to promise casual intimacy, bordering on seduction, but it was belied by the inquisitive look in his eyes.
“But I want to,” Sherlock blurted, making up his mind on the spot. He took a deep breath before carrying on. “I should tell you the night when Lestrade had to arrest me while I was dressed up as… Well, you can say as a woman.”
Ah. Nudged by his friend, Former Soldier – “John” according to the badge pinned on his leather jacket – has finally decided to make a move on Sherlock. Irene fought the temptation to roll her eyes.
He feels his whole face flushing with embarrassment.
He saw Sherlock’s pink lips moving, feeling rather than hearing his low “Oh yes”.
“I bet you can still recite it, can you?”
A never-ending universe of breathless laughter, fond grumbling –
Mycroft rolled his eyes, amused despite himself by the cheekiness of his much-needed assistant and, in all likelihood, his successor. At least, he was doing his best to ensure it would be the case. At this level of power in the great pyramidal structure of her Majesty’s government, no position was easily gained or kept, but it was even more difficult when you were a woman of Indian descent like Anthea.
If it is, it’s working, he thought.
As if he could answer!
“Come on, Greg interrupted him, trying to get up without looking like he weighed a thousand tons (as he was feeling right now), “that’s no way to address the man you’ve kissed last night, is it?”
The slight sound of another person breathing.
He looked up and down the street but no black, posh car was in sight. Not that he expected one, in truth.
She broke off, finding Sherlock much closer than expected. Barely a few inches between them both.
J.H.W.
Meanwhile they were running out of time – and they were no closer to getting the harasser arrested. They haven’t yet succeeded in identifying him! This reality left a bitter taste in Irene’s mouth.
he mentally admonished himself, rubbing his tired eyes and giving a sigh.
“What?”
You lean in, brushing the tip of your nose against his warm skin, inhaling his smell, his warmth.
“John!”
You all know what it means!
He could do this. He was a survivor – he has proven it to himself enough times to know it to be true.
A sharp intake of breath on the other side told John Sherlock has stopped pacing round his room and was waiting for him to carry on.
He was safe here. Studying medicine, making sure his dream came true, getting a tight little group of mates. They weren’t the nicest of the lot, but John didn’t really care. What mattered was he never got to drink alone like some loser.
The Copper Killer case – such a ridiculous nickname, really! – was but the first of his many successes. Sherlock could almost taste on his tongue, hear the echo of his flourishing future in the wind whistling in his ear and tousling his hair.
Molly’s cheeks turned red but she didn’t look away.
“Mrs Hudson?”
He blindly obeyed, his mind addled by such a surge of lust he has never known before. Luckily for him, he only had to take a few steps forward to find the nearest wall. He leant against it, laying his head on his forearm while his right hand found his cock.
She knows he’s trying to make her feel guilty. It won’t work.
John could still hear the door slamming behind her.
He was already lifting the laden tray when Ross interjected.
“Your not-so-secret admirer is back, John…”
“Sherlock?”
His heart was pounding in his chest and despite the slightly cold weather, he felt himself working up a sweat.
For the umpteenth time, he wondered why, if people were so easily offended at his deductions, they didn’t pay more attention to all the clues they left lying around.
Unable to resist any longer, Sherlock ventured to look at John.
Here, he was himself.
Neatly tied with a piece of blue string, the bouquet also included a “Get Well Soon!” card. John noticed it hasn’t been put together by a florist – that much was obvious, with the lack of plastic wrapping. The flowers have been chosen and assembled with care, but it was still amateur work.
“Don’t worry though. I’m sure he only wants to ask you a few questions about Sherlock’s whereabouts that you so stubbornly refused to tell me about.”
John closed his eyes. What was he supposed to do? With trembling fingers, he opened the second text.
All amused thoughts fled Irene’s mind when she heard the laugh.
He couldn’t let himself be spooked by such a silly little thing, could he?
“John…”
“Okay, I did but… I didn’t mean to hurt you. And stop manipulating me with your puppy dog eyes, it won’t work this time!”
John didn’t know how they made it to the flat.
“Are you finished daydreaming now? It might have escaped your attention that we have reached our goal,” he said, waving his hand at a lit board hung on the wall and telling everyone who might be looking at it that yes, the Clos Lucé was waiting for them behind the nearby doors.
Long ago, it would have been a cause of crippling anxiety and fear.
