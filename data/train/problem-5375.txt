Steve was pushed back against the wall between Bruce's and Natasha's suites. Around Clint, he could see that Lara was rushing to open the door. That was all he needed to use as much force as he safely could to push Clint to the ground and pull his hands behind his back. By the time he had Clint pinned, Natasha's door had opened, and Lara had let out an overjoyed shriek.
he was just so happy to see Steve. Nothing could burst his bubble, not when he was high on just being near another person.
Clint did not finish that sentence before he was grabbed roughly by the shoulders and forced down, becoming pinned down to the cement floor. Clint looked behind him to see Bruce kneeling over him.
"Good to see you again, Fury," he said as he approached the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. "How are things in the land of make-believe?" Fury ignored Tony's sarcastic comment.
Before he left, though, he did run into Betty one last time and they chatted for a bit until she had to leave to get on her flight back to Virginia. During their conversation, Betty asked if she could have Lara's number. Apparently, she thought it might be weird for her to get invited to a stranger's wedding, so she figured that they should talk and get to know each other beforehand. Bruce saw no problem with that and sent Lara's contact information to Betty over text. Shortly after that, they parted with Betty catching her flight back home and Bruce going back to the Tower.
"Of course," Natasha said. "We'll take this conversation up to our rooms." Hill nodded in agreement to that and the group started heading for the stairs.
"The consensus of several internet sources is that it is a sedative." Rhodey held back the urge to groan.
"Of course not, Brother Daniel," he said. "Everyone knows you're the profit; the only one who can lead us to ascension."
"I have to run, but I'm sure my friend Nick here would be more than happy to assist with the logistics and strategy of this whole thing." With that, he thrust the phone into Fury's hands and squeezed through the small crowd that had gathered. Hill was quick to chase after him.
"No," she said. "I don't think he would have stayed on this floor. There aren't any public areas and he can't get to any of the rooms. If he was here, we would have found him already." Steve frowned. That meant Tony could be anywhere.
Which, it was. Instead of Tony, a tall, bald, black man with an eyepatch over his left eye stepped into the room. The door shut behind him and he started to approach Steve.
"It's just the prototype," Tony said. "I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now. That's what he's getting at."
"So what?" Steve asked. "You're saying that you didn't recommend him and reject him at the same time?"
Happy 101st birthday to Captain Steven Grant Rogers and Happy Fourth of July to all my fellow Americans!
"Goodnight, Tony." The room was once again plunged into pitch blackness as Pepper turned off the lights and left.
Tony and Clint have been rushed to the hospital and placed under quarantine after Clint accidentally opened a letter containing a fine white powder. Meanwhile, Bruce has been working with an old friend to try to uncover what the powder could have possibly been.
Tony stood there a moment, taking in everything that he just learned. Although he did feel legitimately concerned about Carol's mental state, Natasha did say that she didn't think Carol had bad intentions and he was willing to trust that at least. Resolving to that, Tony gathered up his food and went out to the lounge as well.
"Hey, how are you doing?" Lara jolted like she had just received an electric shock. Her hand let go of the ball and Lucky pounced on it. The ball ended up bouncing away from him, so the dog set off on a wild chase for it across the kitchen. Lara did not notice, though, as she was too busy taking in her surroundings and remembering what she was doing.
"So," Peggy said. "Do you feel like telling me why you ran out of the party?" Tony still said nothing. "It's fine if you don't. We can just sit here all night, saying nothing. I don't mind."
"Meeting him was mind-boggling," Tony said. "I mean, I couldn't imagine someone coming back from the dead as he did, especially after being missing for so long. I heard stories about him when I was a kid. It was just too surreal."
"I gave you a choice between this and sending Lara to nursing school," Tony pointed out. "You're the one who wouldn't go with the easier choice." If Pepper was regretting that, she was not showing it.
"Midnight last night, maybe sooner?" Tony's brow creased as he tried to remember. "Steve said that I was burning up after I puked last night, but I can't remember when that was."
Turning the light off before opening the door, Tony stepped back out into the bedroom. Slowly and carefully, he slipped himself back under Steve's arm, careful not to wake him. Once he worked himself back into the position he was in before, Tony shut his eyes and pressed his forehead up against Steve's shoulder.
"That's exactly what I'm offering you," he said. "My name is Vasyl Knežević and I would like to employ your services, Miss Oswin." He held out his hand for her to shake.
"I'm not saying that," Rhodey said. "I'm just saying think about it rationally and talk to Pepper before you do anything rash."
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I hope it was worth the wait! This chapter was kind of long, so I'm going to keep the author's note short! Please review and comment if you liked this chapter and be sure to follow this story in order to keep up to date!
Tony paused. He honestly couldn't think of anything negative to say about him. Sure, he had heard Howard talk up the guy for years and sure, as a kid Tony might have resented Steve for that, but now? After meeting him, Tony couldn't think of anything bad to say about the guy. Okay, he could think of some superficial things. Steve's teeth were a little too perfect and he didn't like kale, but things like that hardly mattered.
"You don't have to keep walking on eggshells," he said. "I've… Well, I don't think I've entirely come to terms with all of it necessarily, but I'm accepting of the fact that the stuff I've done; that the Other Guy has done… It isn't going to go away or magically get better. I can talk about it now."
"You're Dr. Banner, right?" Carol asked. "I'm sorry, I just want to be sure I've got everyone's names right here."
"I understand what you're saying, Commander," Natasha said. "But with all due respect, we're not the only ones who have handled the situation wrong." Hill tilted her head.
He knew he shouldn't be thinking that way, but it's not like he could help it. This was a dire situation and if there was one thing Clint knew about dire situations, it was that they rarely turned out the way that you wanted them to. As tough as it was, Clint managed to push those thoughts aside as he buried his face in the (very cheaply made) pillow. Seeing as he was going to be trapped there with his troubled mind for a while, it seemed that the only way he was going to be able to escape was by getting some sleep.
"And her address?" The minute the words came out of Nina's mouth, the agent's eyes went wide with horror. Nina knew what the next words out of Duran's mouth were going to be, but it didn't make them any less devastating.
At some point, the staff had noticed a pattern in the way the more obtrusive askers were dressed and began to question anyone in line for the microphone wearing all-white clothing. Quite a few were found to be suspicious and extracted from the line before they could ask their question. That didn't stop them from causing a ruckus as they were being led out, though. However, there were still a few who seemed to be dressed normally – wearing a few different colors and not just all white – that came up and asked a few bizarre questions, most of which revolving around the Battle of New York and why they put a stop to it. They declined to answer every time they managed to slip through, though. After all, what else did they expect them to say? Lives were at stake, of course, they were going to put a stop to it. Hopefully, all the normal people in the room realized that.
"That explains it," the doctor said. "It didn't even hit his system. He just threw it right back up."
As he and Steve got in the elevator, Tony couldn't help but wonder what the hell happened. Obviously, the Avengers had been attacked. That was enough to warrant the police and media presence, but Tony had a feeling something else was going on; something bad. He just hoped he hadn't left Pepper in a bad position as he hit the button for the forty-fourth floor.
"You sure?" he asked. "Because I can give you a blowie or a hand job faster than the time it would take for you to shower." Tony snorted.
was supposed to be their savior, not them. So as soon as he could, Adoniram did and said anything he could to vilify the Avengers.
"Of course they are," Tony assured. "I was directly involved, which brings me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?"
"What I don't understand is why we're still even bothering to talk about this at all. I mean, there is no point. Miss Romanave or whatever her name is will just leak it back to S.H.I.E.L.D. as soon as this meeting is over. So, why even bother?"
Tony could see her point, too. Difficulty or an outright inability to remember key events could be a sign of some serious mental issues. However, once again, none of them knew Carol and Tony wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Call him stupid for wanting that – he certainly thought so – but he did. There was something he needed to know, though.
"Why not?" Clint knew he had to tread carefully here. He couldn't just say "because I'm married and the only person, I really want to sleep with is my wife." Although that was the absolute truth, that would end up compromising himself and his family, and while he may trust the Avengers with his own life, outside of Natasha he wasn't sure if he could trust them with Laura's, or with Cooper's and Lila's. Plus, they were in a hospital being monitored by CCTV. It wasn't exactly a secure location. He needed to be careful about exactly what he said and how he said it. He settled on vagueness as his best option.
!" He pointed at the person in question. "He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did." Then, he turned his attention back to Fury's command post, covering one eye. He quickly realized that the setup probably wasn't entirely accessible for a man with only one eye. "How does Fury even see these?"
Sleep pattern disturbance; concentration difficulties; fatigue; racing thoughts; impulsivity; an increase in risk taking behavior; a decreased need for sleep; excessive energy; increased irritability; excessive worry; all of which were things Tony knew as soon as they were said aloud that he had to say yes to. There were other things he honestly debated the answers to. After all, he knew he spent a lot of time having dirty thoughts about Steve, but he honestly didn't know if that was a symptom or if it was just because he desperately wanted to have sex with his new boyfriend. In the end he said yes, simply just to have his bases covered. He could ask the doctor about it later.
"Okay," Steve said as he let the matter drop. "Do you have any mouthwash or toothpaste or anything like that here?"
"I know," Tony said. "And I will fight it if they try something, but still, it's nice to get the warning, even if it isn't surprising…" Rhodey nodded, fully knowing that there were people at Stark Industries who had wanted Tony gone from the moment Howard Stark was officially declared dead. They would use any means they thought possible to try to get him out of the position of CEO and would not hesitate to use his sexuality against him, no matter how illegal or immoral it was. Rhodey truly felt for him on that.
"Right," Happy said. "Of course." He then pushed the driver's seat up so Steve and Tony could get in the back. Tony managed to do so without any help and Steve followed closely behind him. Once they were in, Happy pushed the seat back into its correct position and got in himself.
Slowly, Steve stood up and surveyed the scene. Tony and Thor seemed to be unharmed and were getting to their feet as well. Neither of them made a move towards each other, which was a good sign. Still, just to be clear, Steve directed his gaze at both men.
"It's too late!" he called out. "She can't stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe."
Carol promptly hung up the phone and spun on her heel. Spotting one of the pamphlets lying discarded on the floor just a few feet away, she scooped it up before rushing out of the store. The clerk shouted something at her as she left, but she didn't pay him any mind. Instead, the focused on the neatly printed address on the pamphlet's front cover.
"Why don't you just give up already?" Tony asked. "You have to know that you're significantly outmatched here."
"Finesse my ass," Carol shook her head and got back to the main topic. "So, you haven't been monitoring Stark at all. You have no idea if he's sought mental health help to deal with what happened?"
"Shits and giggles," Lara pointed out. "Higher ratings, perceived revenge, distractions from their own mistakes – all reasons that people have disparaged you in the past."
Right away, Smith was taking saliva and blood samples. Tony didn't resist or ask questions; just let her do her job. She grilled him on how he was feeling, and Tony answered honestly without any hesitation. He felt a little nauseous but was otherwise fine. He couldn't help but notice the look of relief that slowly washed over Smith's face as he told her that. It easily unnerved him.
"I won't go anywhere," he said. "I'll stay right here with you and Happy. I promise." Rhodey started to smile again.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Like in TV and movies and all that crap. The thing that the person lies down on while they talk to the therapist…"
Loki spotted Thor about to turn the corner. He smirked. This never stopped being funny. Before Thor could turn to investigate the cell, Loki set up an illusion of himself to look like he had just broken. He had already been out for quite several minutes. The only thing he had left to do was take Thor out of the picture. Luckily, the simple illusion did the trick. Thor charged forward at the Loki that was stepping out of the cell, passing right through him and landing on his face. The real Loki hit the button to shut the door. Meanwhile, he sent a second illusion to stand in front of the door to the cell.
Steve tried with all his might to get his eyes open; to get a word out, but it was useless. The man continued to speak.
"What he's got," Tony said as he crossed the room and stepped in front of another monitor. "Is an Acme dynamite kit. It's going to blow up in his face, and I'm going to be there when it does."
Eventually, the person onscreen moved to sit down on the bed, tossing his jacket to the side. For a moment, the person glanced up towards the vent, allowing their entire face to be seen. In that moment, all of Rhodey's worst suspicions had been confirmed. The person on-screen was, in fact, his best friend, Tony Stark. The sight made Rhodey's blood run cold and within seconds, he was dialing Tony's home phone number.
"Oh, don't worry," he said. "We will." Lara made another noise of mock-disgust before turning and walking out of the room, leaving Tony and Steve alone to stare lovingly into each other's eyes.
"Right." The way Stark dragged out the word made it clear that he still was not convinced. "So, this was just some elaborate mix-up and you really left a glowing review singing my praises and recommending me for the Avengers. Is that it?"
"What do you want me to do?" He expected Tony to sigh in annoyance, but he was pleasantly surprised when instead, he just got right down to business.
He was going back to a place he hoped he'd never see again. The rest of Manhattan was sinking behind him as he went up, up, up. The portal was coming closer, Chitauri soldiers continuing to pour out of it from the depths of space. The nuke on his back was a heavy weight, one that pressed down on him hard. He had less than a dozen seconds before it exploded. He needed to get it through the portal.
Lara sat patiently by the front security desk. As soon as she arrived, she was informed that Cabe was attending to another matter and she would have to wait. She understood. Cabe was a busy woman and the Peoples Unity Church's nonsense wasn't making her life any easier. Lara didn't mind the wait, though she was texting Tony and Pepper to let them know she had taken her detour and to find out the game plan for the day. If she was going to be covering for Tony again, she was going to be in a crunch for time, but she wasn't leaving until she talked to Cabe. After all, she wasn't going to put her personal safety ahead of anything else.
"Of course, it's deliberate sabotage," Tony said. "Why else would someone disparage me or the company like that?"
So, in Steve's mind, this was just a friend (He only met Tony once, should he consider him a friend?) taking another friend on a nice night out. Nothing else. Even if he did feel
"No," Clint said. "I'm not wasting my time just ho have someone parrot back everything I already know. Besides, I don't think May would like me talking to her ex."
"Yup," he said. "Because now we have to think up a rational explanation for all of this." As Tony gestured to the disaster that was the conference room, Lara let out a disappointed groan.
"Wait, Peoples Unity Church…?" Lara questioned. "Tony isn't that the same group that gathers in front of the tower."
As they began to attack the city, he could hear the people around him scream and Margot grasp tightly to his arm. Adoniram himself, though, was smiling. This was exactly what he needed. He turned around to face his followers, who once again were crowding the lookout along with a few other shocked bystanders. Gently, he pried Margot's hand off his arm, allowing him to stand with his arms out in a sort of crucifix-like position.
To say that the board had not been quite thrilled with Tony's newest undertaking would be an understatement. They had initially been angry about it because they had to find out about it the same way as everyone else – by watching the Battle of New York unfold on live TV. None of them appreciated that, but it was not like Tony had any way of giving them a heads up. He was too busy fighting sky-whales and almost dying, but in the board's opinion that was no excuse.
At that point, Bergeron seemingly gave up. He said nothing as he got up from his chair and exited the interrogation room. A few seconds later, the door to the observation room opened and Bergeron walked in. Duran made no attempt to hide the triumphant smirk that was appearing on her face.
"None." Lara started rubbing her temples. "We're essentially stuck in limbo until Tony sobers up, and provided that he doesn't go through withdrawals."
Clint didn't know if he fell asleep or not. All he knew was darkness. He did, however, feel a sudden burst of anxiety, the kind that usually accompanied a nightmare. The strange thing was, that even if he was asleep, he wasn't dreaming, so the sudden burst of anxiety was unexplained. That was, until Clint started thinking more deeply about it.
"All of that!" Knežević flailed his arms around to demonstrate what he was talking about. "Breaking into Stark Industries in front of a whole bunch of security guards and cameras without anyone even noticing! There must be a trick to it! Is there a trick to it? There must be a trick to it! I promise I won't tell anyone." Oswin let out an amused giggle.
"Thanks," Clint said. Natasha looked up for a moment before going back to removing the restraints around his wrists. "Natasha… How many agents did I…"
The video was barely a minute long and was timed stamped for early in the morning two days before. Although one would expect surveillance footage to be grayscale and grainy, thanks to the miracle of JARVIS and Stark technology, the video was in perfect quality and full screaming color.
He hadn't seen any of the others since Romanoff left him. That would be all well and good as he was certain that Romanoff had turned them all against him by this point, but Steve was still with them. He liked Steve. He missed Steve. He wanted to kiss Steve. So, he had no choice but to try and find them. The only problem with that was that he couldn't remember where their table was, and people kept coming up to him to talk. Also, the fact that he kept pouring more alcohol down his throat probably didn't help.
"Romanoff," the woman responded. "Natasha Romanoff." Steve tried not to give any hint that he recognized the name, though he did feel the incessant need to question her as to why she gave Tony such a scathing character profile.
Tony certainly did have a few words to say to the showrunner once the interview was over. Normally, that would be a job for his assistant, but Pepper had decided to retain her position as CEO of Stark Industries, "Natalie Rushman" discreetly made her exit in the days following the disaster that was Stark Expo, and Tony had yet to appoint someone new to the position. Regardless, the showrunner was extremely apologetic for the way the interview had gone, but the damage had been done and now Tony was going to be left to figure out the fall out of that. He just hoped that none of the press continued the wannabe big shot's crusade at the groundbreaking ceremony that was to take place that afternoon. If he could get through that part of the day, he wouldn't be "home free", but he would have one of the more stressful parts of the day done and over with and he couldn't wait for it.
"I'm not implying it," he said. "I'm stating it. Yes, I'm a member of the Peoples Unity Church. What's the problem with that?"
"Give me one second…" Oswin picked up her cell phone and tapped the screen a few times. After she did that, the laptop started making a sound and Oswin clicked something on the screen. She turned the device around and put it in Knežević's lap. "All set."
"Ow!" She rubbed the back of her blonde head as she got up off the ground. She shut her laptop as she glared at Tony. "What the hell? That hurt!"
He was mindful enough not to shout that aloud. He didn't want to wake Steve after all, but he couldn't help but want to celebrate. It was only for half a second, but the woman on the video glanced up at the camera, giving it a full view of her face. This was exactly the break he needed! Now all he needed to do was put a name to the face.
For the rest of the day, every time Tony had a spare moment, he was watching the video. By five PM, he had to have watched it so many times that a normal person would have probably gone insane. He had watched it during lunch breaks, in between meetings, and during meetings (don't tell Pepper.) Even now, when he was supposed to be doing other work, he was instead watching the video. It didn't occur to him that this might be radically obsessive – even for a distraction – until the sound of a stack of papers slamming against the glass top of his desk startled him out of it.
"Listen, I don't know where you got that idea psychiatry, but that's not how we're going to be doing things here." Dr. Cranston's voice was firm, yet still somehow gentle. "When I say that this is a safe space, I mean it. We don't talk about what you don't want to talk about. That would be detrimental to your recovery process. You're in charge here, and what you don't feel comfortable talking about, we won't talk about. Although, I would appreciate it if you told me now whether or not you have a desire to kill women for their skin." Alright, that got Tony to smile for a moment.
"Read the menu." Knežević gestured to the blackboard behind him that had the drink options listed (beer, light beer, brown tap water) and – in bright neon pink no less – the capitalized statement of
"My name is Steve Rogers. You know me better as Captain America." The crowd started cheering and clapping. Tony noticed that Steve's cheeks turned a little pink and the corners of his lips rose up. "A detail about myself… I really like Earl Grey tea." Much like Clint, he shrugged as if he wasn't sure what else to say. The crowd made another noise of amusement before all eyes were on Tony.
"Pretty bad," Steve said. "I put a cold cloth on his forehead, but that hasn't seemed like it's done much to help."
"Unfortunately, yes," Dr. Smith said grimly. "We have to limit their contact with other people until we know for sure that they're not contagious."
"Sir," the AI said. "Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line." Tony rolled his eyes. Of course S.H.I.E.L.D. would call now of all times.
Natasha had watched Clint carefully throughout the meeting. To his credit, he seemed to be doing good. His complexion was still a relatively healthy color and simple conversation did not wind him. He even seemed steady on his feet on the way down. It made Nat think for a bit that maybe she was worrying too much. Then the meeting ended, and it became apparent that she had been right to be concerned.
"My what?" That one seemed strange, but it was the future, so it could be a completely normal question.
"We've been robbed." The entire world seemed to freeze around Tony for a brief second as he took in those words.
"I'm glad to hear you think so," Cranston said before turning and heading over to her desk. "Well, seeing as it's been almost an hour and I'm sure you want to be on standby in case this was something more than an earthquake, maybe we should work out when our next appointment is going to be so I can let you go."
Steve's heart stuttered at the slight note of despair that rang through Tony's voice at the end of that last sentence. It did not go unnoticed by the other Avengers, either.
"Don't worry," Natasha said. "It's nothing you can't fix." Natasha walked past Tony, turning on a light that was attached to the gauntlets on her wrist. He and Steve followed her as she stepped inside the house. "Wow must have been some party."
"Oh, that?" she said rather nonchalantly. "That probably has to do with that gay sex tape from 1995. He doesn't like having it brought up in any way, shape or form. Probably saw that himself and asked Fury to redact it. Anyway, I'll bring this right back to you, okay?" She then left the room, leaving Steve in an almost paralyzed state of shock.
"I knew it!" he exclaimed across the landline connection. "I just knew it! I knew that guy was trouble right from the start! I told Tony that he should stay away from him, but did he listen to me? No!"
"Agreed," Conroy said. "But it seems that irrationality is an unavoidable curse in the world of upper-management – no offense."
Natasha slipped her boots back on and gathered up her book and coat. Clint stood up, straightening out his jacket and pocketing his phone. For a few moments, nothing happened as the calls – mostly for Stark but Nat could hear a few "Hulks" and "Captain Americas" thrown in there – swelled outside. Then the front doors of the hotel opened, and Stark stepped through, blowing a kiss to his adoring public and waving as he left the cameras' view. Beside him was a blonde woman who was wearing what appeared to be a federally-issued windbreaker (Department of Homeland Security, Nat noted from the insignia) and a t-shirt that advertised the band the Veronicas. Steve was quick to follow his boyfriend and Col. Rhodes and Dr. Banner followed behind them. A bald black man and a brunette white woman pulled up the rear. Nat noticed that the brunette paused to scan the crowd before shutting the doors.
"Yeah," Natasha said. "But you also smeared sex jelly on the walls and tore the room apart. What else were they supposed to think? How were they supposed to know that this was even a joke?"
"It's not the State of the Union or the whole PR mess that we're in," she said. "I'm just hesitant to put Tony on a plane when he's in the state that he's in, especially one with a bar."
to make that idea a reality went beyond the bounds of human astonishment. However, did make an effort to emphasize that he was still working on the basic levels of coding and it would probably be years before he'd even be close to having an alpha version to test out. That seemed to quell the concerns of the other Avengers – at least for now – but the possibilities were practically buzzing through Bruce's mind. He was planning on pulling Tony aside as soon as the meeting ended to continue discussing the possibilities, but as soon as he stepped out of the meeting room and into the kitchen, his attention was taken by someone else.
"It's not your fault," Rhodey said. "You couldn't have noticed. That jackass was keeping your focus on him, and he completely avoided looking at the camera to keep himself from being exposed. He did this to hurt you. You couldn't have known."
At the last second, Steve lifted his head to the sky and what he saw… Well, it was nothing short of a damn miracle. Just as the portal was about to snap shut, the figure of a man clearly came tumbling out of it and once the sunlight caught a gleam on the red-and-gold paint job, there was no denying who it was.
"No, no…" Lara's voice quivered uncomfortably. "But I almost wish it was." Given her clear discomfort, Bruce decided not to question that further, except to ask…
. He couldn't know for sure and those thoughts spun around in his head, churning up fear and anxiety from the deepest, darkest parts of his mind – parts he only learned existed recently. It was disorienting and the longer it went on, the more lost he felt.
"I do want to know, though," Lara said. "Should I try apologizing when he gets back or would it be better to wait until tomorrow when he's – hopefully – better?"
"Tell them the truth," Tony said. "I'm only sneaking out to save the hassle of having to check out and check back in again." Conroy opened her mouth to speak again, but Tony cut her off. "And before you ask, if the dictators of any third-world countries die, celebrate as much as you like, just don't leave that spot."
"It's fine," Tony said as he sat up a bit more in the bed. "Thank you for coming." He wrapped his arms around his best friend, who gave him a solid pat on the back.
"I know I shouldn't complain about my first day," she said. "But that was basically a witch-hunt on steroids. Seriously, I've seen nuclear deals made more peacefully than that."
"Agent Margret Carter is just fine," he said. "She's in an assisted living facility in London. She's safe." Steve seemingly deflated a little bit as that concern left his mind.
"Good," Steve said. "Now tell me what's going on in that genius mind of yours." The corners of Tony's lips raised upwards for a second before getting down to business.
"No." Bruce shook his head. "There are other factors to consider as well. For example, I have no idea if I got Dr. Erskine's original formula exactly right. Betty and I tried to decode his notes as best we could, but it used deep levels of encryption. We're talking ciphers on top of ciphers. Not even the best code breakers back in the day could figure it out. It's very much possible that there's something in there we missed."
"Stark and his assistant knew for sure," Freeman said. "It came out when I told them and the other three Avengers that I called the RCMP."
"But he's alive?" Natasha really wished she didn't have to phrase that as a question. Fortunately, Coulson went for the merciful response.
They took the express elevator directly up to the penthouse. The foyer and the hallways were unsurprisingly empty. Stark and Banner were likely working, and Steve was probably doing whatever he did when he wasn't making out with Stark. It wasn't like they had been expecting a whole parade for their homecoming and they were fine with that. Clint needed to rest, anyway. He didn't need too much excitement. Natasha pushed Clint through the hallways and along with Happy, boarded the local elevator. She hit the button for the second floor and waited patiently for the doors to open again.
"Captain," she said. "None of this is going to mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal." They both directed their gazes to the sky above. Despite Thor's attempts to curtail the number of Chitauri getting through and wreaking havoc on the streets, there was still a huge number getting by him and onto the streets below. Natasha could tell that Steve knew she was right.
"Yeah, about that," Tony said. "I think you might have scared him earlier when you questioned him about our involvement." Pepper gave him a look that said, "what do you mean?" "I think he's scared that you're going to out him."
"We from Gaza," the man said in heavily accented English. "Palestine. This normal." Tony made sure to give them an extra big tip after that.
Steve just wanted to get an update on the search for the Tesseract, nothing more, nothing less. Go in, ask Tony one question, and get out before the other man became annoyed by his mere presence once again, or vice versa. However, when he approached the door to the lab and saw through the window that Tony was poking Bruce with a metal stick, Steve couldn't let that go by without saying something.
"Calm down," Freeman said. "We all did great today. Sure we had a few bumps…" Tony scoffed at that and for the first time in the past two days, Freeman looked something other than calmly optimistic. "…But it's nothing to upset ourselves about. Tomorrow will be better."
that, but he was willing to give Tony the benefit of the doubt. "Even so, mixing substances like that was unbelievably reckless and stupid, even for you." Tony shrugged.
By this point, Lara wasn't sure what time it was. She knew that the sun had set some time ago, but other than that she was clueless. After she had cleared Pepper's schedule, task after task had been passed down to her. It wasn't Pepper or her assistant's fault. They were getting bogged down with work, too. That kind of happens when the owner and public face of your company is suddenly hospitalized while your main headquarters is closed off to the public for decontamination purposes. As a result, Lara hadn't gotten a break in hours and technically it wasn't even a real break. She had talked to Bruce on the phone for five minutes and then went right back to work. She was just
"The Loki stuff," she said. "Coulson, anything else… If any of it's bothering you, you know you can talk about it, right?"
The only good thing about it was that despite bringing up every one of his very public failings from the time he took over Stark Industries to the aforementioned incident at the Expo just two months prior, the woman somehow neglected to bring up his '95 sex tape. Out of all the mistakes he made in his past, he never wanted to relive that one again.
"'We're either going to stop this or we'll die trying,'" Tony said. "That's what was going through my head for the most part and at certain points where it looked like the later was what was going to happen."
After their first meeting and disastrous first date (which was ultimately his own fault for pushing everything else in his life to the side to chase after a hot guy fifty years his senior) Tony and Steve had kept in contact via phone calls and later text messaging once Steve had learned to use a cell phone. (A 2007 Blackberry, but an actual working cell phone nonetheless.) Tony would admit he felt attracted to Steve the moment he saw him, but once he started talking to him, Tony found that he liked him. He
Hours later, Loki awoke again. This time, however, he knew he was anything but alone. He heard footsteps in the distance. They were soft,as if whoever or whatever was approaching him either didn't weigh anything or had adapted to the surface of the asteroid and learned to move across it with flawless ease. Loki didn't dare move and kept his eyes shut, hoping that if he pretended to be dead, whoever it was would leave him be and move on. He wasn't so fortunate.
"You see that red lever?" Steve looked to his right and spotted it a few feet away. He'd have to navigate a few more broken platforms, but once again it'd be easy enough to get over there. "It will slow down the rotors long enough for me to get out. Stand by it. Wait for my word." Steve nodded and jumped across the first platform.
"No," he said. "Don't do that. You do not get to worry about me and take care of me without me doing the same for you. That's not fair."
Why is it that every time I listen to Pray for the Wicked all I can think is "Wow, this song totally fits Tony!"
"Oh, wow!" Her eyes were wide, and her mouth hung open. Tony waited patiently for her to decide which question to ask first. "This is the thing that keeps you alive, right?" Good choice. Much better than the usual "does it hurt?"
Carol and Fury looked at each other, confirming that they had both heard the same thing. Fury turned towards the door.
"How?" It was Clint's turn to regret asking a question. Stark hesitated a moment before he started forcing the words out of himself.
"What are we doing?" Tony's eyes narrowed and his posture became tense. He gripped the armrests of the chair for dear life. Lara made eye contact with him and within an instant, she was hurriedly whispering something into Freeman's ear. Everhart, meanwhile, played dumb.
"I have some in the middle drawer of my dresser," Tony said. "Just go down the hall and it should be the last door on the left, right before the emergency stairs." Bruce nodded and gave a quick "thank you" before disappearing down the hall. Tony turned back to Steve, who looked at him with a bit of concern.
Avengers Tower still hadn't been cleared by the CDC yet. Last time they called Pepper, they told her that they would likely be finished inspecting and decontaminating everything by the next morning, but Lara honestly doubted they'd even come close to meeting that deadline. In the meantime, they'd been kicked out of the coffee shop and had to rent a conference room from a nearby hotel, which was what hindered Lara's plan. It wasn't their space and she could easily lose the money if she tried, so she was going to have to wait.
The conversation ended there as once again, the scene sprung to life with action and sound. All that proceeded it was a call of Tony's name – his
The elevator ride up was particularly quiet. The only time anyone tried to speak up was Carol, who thought it pertinent to point out that it would be a lot faster if she could just fly them up to the penthouse. Neither Natasha nor Steve were amused by that remark and Carol just pressed her lips together and shrugged into the back of the elevator awkwardly.
Stark, meanwhile, was looking at her with narrowed eyes, as if he were trying to figure something out. Jessica realized that he probably recognized her. Two years prior, she had posed as a Homeland Security Agent in order to investigate a robbery at Stark Industries for Hydra. It had been the final mission she had to complete in order to get her powers back. She didn't interact much with the man himself – just one informal meeting in a hallway – but apparently, she must have somehow left an impression as the gears were slowly clicking behind his eyes.
"Even so, I'd like to do a blood test just to be sure," Rawls said. "I'm also going to order a full platelet count and tests for the most common autoimmune disorders; lupus, pernicious anemia, scleroderma… I really wouldn't worry about the HIV test, though. If you came back clean a month ago and you haven't been engaging in risky behavior since then, you're probably going to come back clean again. Do you have any questions?"
"I would have informed you when Salinas was ready for you," Freeman defended. Tony caught the roll of Romanoff's eyes.
Steve directed his attention back to Tony, who had taken his bleary gaze away from Steve and back to the doctor who was treating him. Oh, this was going to be good.
"Uh, yeah, hi," Banner said as he walked over and took the offered hand. "They told me you would be coming."
Remember kids, don't mess with the deep web. The best-case scenario as to how it ends is that Homeland Security shows up to haul you off to Gitmo. THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO!
Lara was sitting on the couch in Clint's suite with the still-to-be-named puppy. She had set her cell phone down on the coffee table and for the past few minutes it had been ringing off the hook. She hadn't bothered to look at it, preferring to give her full attention to the puppy. However, she wasn't fooling herself. Glancing over at the phone's screen, she could see that the caller was coming up as "No Caller ID" which made her hesitant to answer. It wasn't until the song started up again for the sixth time that she finally gave in, picked up the phone, and answered it.
"I already know that," she said. "And I wasn't going to ask about that until I clarified a few other things."
Tony did as she commanded as she ran a few more tests. With each one, the doctor seemed to grow even more confused.
"Please," she said. "I'd rather try to pierce my septum with a thumb tack." Tony winced at the mental image of that.
"Shit!" Tony pulled his hands away. Knežević started running back down the beach. Tony flipped his hands to look at them. Both the repulsors and the metal surrounding them started to turn to clear stone.
Despite the revolutionary discovery, there was some cause for concern. In a few models of the Tesseract's energy projection capabilities, it was shown that it was possible for another energy spike from the cube to not only level the building, but also any other structure in a twenty-mile radius. Thankfully, they were in the middle of one of the most deserted locations on Earth. Civilian casualties were only a minor concern. Still, there was too much risk involved to the lives of the non-necessary personnel, so after contacting the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Clint's handler, Agent Phil Coulson, ordered an evacuation of all personnel not directly responsible for security or research purposes. It was the safest call. Clint just hoped they would all be able to make it out in time.
However, she had somehow managed it and the sun was shining brightly in the sky, indicating that a new day had dawned quite some time ago. Carol forced herself to her feet, stumbling slightly as she hadn't realized how cramped her legs were from resting against the cold, hard ground. She dusted her clothes off and did her best to straighten her hair out. It probably didn't do much to help her appearance, but she still had to try. She needed to look presentable if her cover was going to be believable. Although, it did quickly occur to her that she was going to need more than a simple brush-down to achieve that.
"You're having an allergic reaction?" Jessica shook her head. It took a second for exactly what she meant to click in Carol's head. "You absorbed it through your skin." Jess nodded. "Shit."
Once in, Rhodey used a payphone to call Happy. He updated the other man on what had happened and as soon as he said the words "taken to the hospital" Happy was declaring that he was on his way there, despite the fact that he didn't give Rhodey a chance to tell him
"Just keep me posted." Tony flew down the corridor parallel to the giant snake-turtle-sky-whale. His eyes ran up and down the length of the creature's body, searching for any opening he could spot. "JARVIS, find me a soft spot." As he gave out that order, part of the sky-whale's body collided with the top of a building. The creature seemed unharmed, but the building certainly wasn't. Yup, this wasn't going to be easy.
"J'aurais dû t'avorter," Lara said without missing a beat. Tony sucked in a sharp breath through his teeth. Howard might have been a terrible parent, but at least he never said that to him. At least, not outright. Barton, however, seemed to be confused.
"I don't think that sounds right." The "depressive personality" part she had no qualms with. (Again, she was on anti-depressants.) However, she didn't think she had a problem asserting herself. In fact, she had the exact opposite problem given that she hit people that hadn't even hurt her. She didn't want to explain that to a stranger, but that wouldn't stop Carl from pressing.
"Still, trust me," Tony said. "I'll be alright." It took a moment, but slowly, Steve nodded. "I'll see you in a few hours."
Tony would be the exception, but to be honest, most of Steve's worries stemmed from him. Everything from his sexuality and mental health to his recent actions and alcoholism worried Steve, but somehow, it was worth it. Being with Tony… Falling for someone who made him feel as good as he did was worth it. Even if he didn't feel a hundred-percent happy at the time, the bits that Tony gave him meant everything. That was why he wanted to help him so bad. He wanted to be able to give back every bit of happiness that Tony gave him. He wanted him to feel happy, safe, and well…
"It's just…" Tony said. "You know it's alright to say you're not comfortable. I know we just met a few days ago and things are kind of changing fast, but… I like you. I haven't really had a chance to get to know you, but what I've seen so far, I like, and I don't want to pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with. I just need to hear you say the words."
That is when it clicked with him. He was not as upset with Pepper as he was with Romanoff for sharing the video. Everyone else he could forgive for watching the video. Steve, Clint, Bruce, and Lara needed to in order to find him and Pepper and Happy were just concerned for him. He could even forgive Pepper for filing the lawsuit. She wanted people to be held accountable for what happened to him and he could understand that.
Clint froze. His eyes went straight to the door. For privacy purposes, Clint had gone into his en suite bathroom to make the call. That way, there was less of a chance that someone would walk in on him. (Though, to be honest, the only person that he would think would barge into his room without knocking was Natasha and she already knew about Laura and the kids. Still, it was better to be safe than sorry.) Also, he didn't want Laura to see the puppy before he got a chance to tell her about him and he thought it would be easier to lock the puppy out of the bathroom than it would be to trap him in there, but the dog was proving him wrong. He could hear him using his one front paw to scratch at the door, crying as if he were mortally wounded. Clint set the laptop on the ground and went to open the door.
"Follow us down a few floors then report back to your designated duty station," Fury told the agent. "Understood?"
"And lit up," Steve added. "I really wish I had something to draw this with." Tony raised his eyebrows.
"Oh please," Lara said. "Compton's not as bad as Dr. Dre advertises it to be. I never had a problem when I lived there."
"Are you sure?" The question came out as more of a demand. "You've already taken the first step. Why not go all the way?"
The sound of the payphone beeping jarred Carol out of her thoughts. She fed another quarter into the machine while keeping an eye on the scene playing out in front of her. The two robed men tried to leave their pamphlets on the counter, but the clerk wasn't having it. He tossed the pamphlets back into the men's faces, shouting at them to leave the store and to take their propaganda with them. The men complied with the former, but not the latter. They made a hasty exit, not even attempting to pick up the pamphlets strewn all over the floor. With an aggravated sigh, the clerk went ahead and did it himself.
"Steve," she said. "Baby stay right here. I'm gonna find someone to take us to the hospital, alright?"
"We can't be sure that Subarian was telling the truth," Hill admitted. "If the virus is still active, though, I'd rate her chances as better than most."
The doctor turned and punched a number into a keypad, causing the double doors to swing open. Inside, the room was divided straight down the middle by a large sheet of vinyl. Each side contained two hospital beds and machines of various purposes. The walls were the same shade of pure white as the hallway, but their retinas were spared the agony of having florescent light bouncing off it. Instead, blacklights shined down from the ceiling and tinged everything a dark shade of blue. Clint frowned as he looked around.
Tony shut his eyes as Steve's arms wrapped around him. He felt him press a kiss to the side of his head, and Tony buried his face in the juncture between Steve's neck and shoulder. He took a deep breath in and savored the moment. Steve wasn't going to hold him like this forever or ever again. He needed to cherish it.
"Tony…" He turned to look at Happy and saw that despite his friend's warning tone, he had a genuine look of concern on his face. A glance back at Pepper showed that look mirrored on her face, perhaps doubly so. Tony found himself in sudden need of another deep breath.
In retaliation, Beta put her hand against the wall. Carol was unsure what she was doing in the low light, but then the woman charged at her. Carol managed to jump out of the way, causing Beta's fist to collide with the wall. The loud slam of concrete hitting concrete gave a pretty clear indication of what she could do; she could turn her fists into any material she touched.
Not liking where this was headed, Steve swallowed hard against the sinking feeling that was consuming his stomach. Despite his hesitance, he looked Rhodes right in the eyes and said, "alright, tell me what happened."
"I thought you said no one was infected." Natasha stopped dead in her tracks just before the door. She didn't give Sharpton the satisfaction of turning around to face her. Instead, she remained facing the door, which allowed anger to cross her face freely.
He leaned back against the headboard and shut his eyes; his only focus was on breathing. He reminded himself that he and Steve were safe and so was everyone else. (Well, with the possible exceptions of Barton and Romanoff.) No invasions were happening, and the world was going to spin on as normal.
"Possibly," Adoniram said. "Do you have anything else to report as far as the Avengers are concerned?"
"And you're doing a marvelous job with that," he said. "The humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret. I mean to rule them, as why should I not?"
Also, I feel the TV show has also encouraged people to try to stage an intervention without the help of a licensed psychologist or counselor, especially since there's this warning on the Wikipedia page for interventions; "Sometimes direct interventions involve physical force [...] to capture or confine the targeted person. In such cases, the intervention may be illegal because it deprives the person of liberty without due process of law." I think we all can agree without even looking it up that's not happening at a professional intervention.
"No, I haven't," Knežević asserted. "Everyone else has. That's why I need to do this. If I can create this formula…" He pulled a series of neatly folded papers out of his pants pocket. "…Then hopefully I can sell it and have the funds to get back on my feet."
"I can't see how anyone could do it on their own," she said. "I mean, that lab surely has some top-notch equipment, but could they really manufacture something of that level?"
That was not surprising given that it was New York and the last time a building in New York had been struck by a large, rapidly moving flying object, a national tragedy had occurred. Despite that, Tony could already feel the aggravation in his blood.
"To ascension and beyond," Margot repeated. She pulled his hand closer to her mouth and kissed the palm when a knock was heard at the door.
"Alright," she said. "I'll admit that I didn't like that she did nothing to stop you when you threw that crazy party…" Tony winced slightly at the memory. "…But outside of that she didn't do that bad of a job."
"God, what did I say about screwing?" Steve immediately pulled back, face flushed red. Tony couldn't help the rise of the corners of his lips. That was until Lara hit him in the face with the t-shirt Steve had discarded during the night. "Come on, get up."
Steve held out his hand and Tony took it. He helped Tony get out of the car and once he was out, slung Tony's arm back over his shoulder. Happy gave them an odd look up and down.
Bruce took a step forward, stuck his hands into the glove holes, and peered down the lenses. Once again, he saw the same white grains that he had already spent most of his time staring at. Nothing immediately stuck out to him.
"And last time she used her position to spy on me," Tony said. "So, I think I have a right to be a bit wary of her."
"Next to nothing. They just asked me if I agreed with a bunch of vague statements and told me I was depressed. I walked out of there before they could sell me anything." She sighed. "That wasn't as fun as I was expecting, but at least I didn't get told anything that I was afraid of hearing."
"Yup," Clint said. "Powdered, processed, and ready to kill." As he was speaking, Clint felt some of the powder fly into his mouth. Thinking fast, he ran over to the sink and started trying to spit it up as best he could. "
"I gave him Valium." Her voice was very clear and direct. "I had to. He was showing signs of severe anxiety and I needed to calm him down as fast as possible. Besides, he could probably do with the nap given that he told me he's probably only gotten ten hours of sleep this week at the bare minimum." Steve could barely control the shocked look on his face, though he did keep his mouth from falling open in astonishment.
"It's lovely to meet you as well," Tony said in a way that sounded less than sincere. It was clear that Hill had caught on to the slight as she shook his hand.
"Yes, ma'am," she said. "We have no reason to believe the letter's claims are false. Likely, the powder is a cross of genetically modified Ebola and the H5N1 virus."
"Steve, you can't," Natasha's voice was firm as she spoke. "There's nothing you can do to help him. Even if we weren't stuck in here, there wouldn't be much you could do."
Despite that, Lara found herself struggling with the problem as well. Every time she ran the numbers in her head, she came to what seemed like a correct answer, however, she couldn't help but feel like it was slightly off for some reason. She mulled over it before giving it up with a slight shrug.
"Do after lunch," Tony said. "Like, one or so. If Barton and Romanoff haven't joined us by then, we can give them a quick rundown later."
"Yeah," she said. "True, but… I do not know. Something about it just bothers me. I mean, before he was desperate to get into contact with me. Now, he does not even show up at the hearing. That just does not make sense to me. You'd think he'd take the opportunity when it was presented to him, right?"
Gently, Tony felt a hand come to rest on his shoulder. He looked up to see Pepper giving him a soft, slightly said look.
She raked her fingers though her damp blonde hair as she bit her lip and tried to figure out how to proceed. She knew there wasn't one in the guest bathroom and she found it doubtful that there'd be one anywhere in the guest room give that the penthouse was mostly occupied by men who likely rarely considered such things. To be sure, however, she had to check.
"It actually does help a bit. Thank you." Laura laughed again. Clint smiled as he thought of the best way to transition into the topic of the dog. "Listen, there's something I wanted to talk to you about…"
"Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony," Steve said as he began to make his way over to the other man.
Opening the box up, Adoniram found it to fill with black foam. There was a cylindrical indentation in the foam, clearly meant to be holding something breakable. Laying across the indentation was a card. Picking it up, Adoniram brought it close to his face so he could read it.
Once he was behind his car, Rhodey spiked the tape down on the ground as hard as he could. The plastic casing cracked a bit, but otherwise it was relatively undamaged. Rhodey gave an angry and dismissive snort, resolving that it would not stay that way for long. He marched over to the driver's side of the car, hopped in the front seat, and turned the key in the ignition. He did not even give the car a chance to warm up before he threw it in reverse and slammed on the gas pedal.
Tony felt Steve run his hand up and down his arm comfortingly. Meanwhile, Lara slid into the seat across the aisle from them.
The shattered glass that littered the balcony cut into Loki's skin as he got to his feet, or at least, tried to. An inhuman roar and the blur of green that knocked him through the window, straight into the penthouse sort of made that process a bit difficult. Hitting the rear wall with a hard slam and a painful groan Loki's eyes narrowed with fury as he faced off against the giant green beast that had dared to assault him.
doctors, but your blood is going to the CDC. That's a different animal entirely; not as much to worry about."
BTW, that dream Lara had is actually one I had... I wasn't sure where or how else to bring it up... Should I be concerned that I dreamed that? Like, do I need to get off Hydroxine or something? Help! O_O
Steve swallowed his bite of egg and did not look up from his plate before saying, "mandatory team meeting after breakfast."
"What?!" The exclamation flew right out of Freeman's mouth. "What the… Does this… You're the ones who sent the virus to the Avengers?" His eyes darted between Salinas and Adoniram. Salinas was completely unphased.
The elevator ride up to the penthouse was uncomfortable to say the least. Lara was leaning against the far wall, eyes squeezed shut; Pepper had a hand pressed to the bandage on her cheek, gently rubbing it as if the action would alleviate the pain; and Tony… Well, Tony was just trying not to let his dread about the next day eat him alive.
"No," Rhodes said. "He faced away from the camera the entire time. The only reason I knew it was him was because I was with Tony that weekend. The only people who know are Happy, Pepper, and now you."
Stepping out of the women's room, Lara wasn't expecting anyone to be waiting for her. Certain she knew who it was and not bothering to look at them, Lara thrust the dress she had been wearing into their arms and started to walk away.
"I know," he said. "But I've made my way through public appearances while extremely ill before. It'll be a walk in the park."
"Yeah, he's looking real lively there." Tony heard someone scoff at his sarcastic remark and a tablet was thrust into his hands. On the screen was a series of medical readings that were coming from the man who was supposedly Rogers.
"Do you know what it's like to be unmade?" It only took eye contact with Natasha for Clint to remind himself who he was talking to.
"Look," Rhodey said. "I agree that Pepper probably should have talked to you before going forward with this, but you have to admit that the hotel needs to be held accountable for their actions."
Tony did exactly that, sitting down on one of the leather couches. Pepper added that she just needed to finish replying to an e-mail and she would be right with him. Tony did not mind. It gave him more time to figure out what he was doing.
"Let's blow this popsicle stand." Fury plopped a cap down on her head. Carol pulled it off and turned it around, revealing that the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo was embolized across it. "Still doing the logo thing?"
"Good morning, Mr. Stark," she said cordially despite the look in her eyes being anything but cordial. He could easily guess that she was seething behind that surgical mask. "Did you enjoy your little night on the town? I hope you did because it's the last one you're going to have for a while."
"I most certainly do Mr. Stark." Steve turned around to face Carol, a confused expression on his face. Glancing over at Natasha, Tony could see that her face held nothing but suspicion.
"I'd say enough with the foreplay, slick. What are you selling?" Lara smirked at the aghast expression that crossed Carl's face. "What? You're clearly running a scam here. Just tell me what it is you want me to buy and I'll be on my merry way."
She followed Freeman to the dining hall. She knew it would be hard to keep him from recognizing her. The best she could do was slide into a seat and pretend to be perusing the cocktail menu. She'd like to be more covert, but she could make do. She'd done more with less.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said. "See you in a minute." The video feed back to Pepper cut out and the mechanisms to take apart the Iron Man suit came to life around Tony. Slowly, he stepped off the platform and the machinery began to take apart his armor bit by bit.
"I'm only going to tell you this once, Vasyl!" She stopped in front of him with hands on her hips and fury in her eyes. "Leave now or I'm calling the police! I went easy on you before, but this is a step too far!"
Tony Stark did not date people, but he did have a few that he regularly hooked up with. Tiberius Stone was one of them. He was some executive from another company that Rhodey did not even bother to learn the name of. All he knew was that he did not like the guy or the way he seemingly treated Tony like he was his property. However, that did not stop Tony from seeing him off-and-on for the past year. In fact, the only thing that did was some argument Tony was not willing to go into the details of. Rhodey did not pry further because he was only glad that the guy was out of Tony's life for good. At least, that is what he thought until he saw him appear on the tape. Then, he started to realize that Tony might not be out of the woods yet.
"Well, I just wanted to introduce myself," Salinas said. "I don't want to take up much of your time. Besides, I'm certain we'll have plenty of time to get to know each other in the coming months, especially when you join the cause." Immediately, Romanoff frowned, and her eyes narrowed.
"Alright, that does sound weird," Tony said. "But to give her the benefit of the doubt, I had my heart shredded to pieces by a bomb in Afghanistan, Steve became a medical guinea pig to save the country, Bruce had an 'oopsie' while playing with nuclear radiation, Thor is a God who has a fucked-up family, and you and Clint…" Realization dawned on Tony's face then. "Actually, I don't know how you and Clint became the super bad asses you are today."
We're now officially halfway through the year! That means we're only six months away from the blood bath that 2020 is sure to be! Crap...
Lara watched the screen as the first officers walked through the lobby's doors with guns drawn. She bit her lip and watched uncomfortably as they walked into what was sure to be their certain doom. Even though she had warned the 911 operator of the seriousness of the situation, there had clearly been a breakdown in communications somewhere because as far as she could tell, none of the officers were wearing tactical gear or even a single trace of Kevlar. They were very unprepared to fall into the trap that had been set up for them.
"Waylon," she said. "I'm declaring a code blue situation effective immediately. Are you aware of the procedure?"
"He's showing signs of waking up," Hill supplied. Tony stared at the man on the other side of the glass. He was as still as a statue and looked as perfectly serene as he did when Tony first arrived.
Clint probably jinxed them all with that remark. As soon as he finished saying that, a massive energy burst came from the Tesseract, opening some sort of portal and causing a blinding flash of bright blue light to consume the room. When it faded, a figure was standing crouched on another platform that had been set up for testing purposes. A few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents carrying heavy machine guns approached the figure cautiously as it slowly looked up and gave a venomous smile. It was very clearly a man; one without good intentions. The man stood up and took stock of the room. At this point, Fury spoke up.
"My drinking got to the point where my best friend stopped speaking to me," she said. "I don't blame her. She had a young impressionable daughter and I wasn't being a good influence. At that point, I had literally nothing to stop me from drinking and I let it get out of hand. Then there was a situation. It's a very long story, but essentially bad guys were on the moon doing something evil and I tried to stop them while horribly intoxicated. I failed, obviously. That should have been my wake-up call, but it wasn't."
"So, what happened?" Maria asked. "They said on the news that a Stark prototype went haywire and ended up crashing into Avengers Tower, but I know better than to believe that. That exhaust trail just looked way too familiar." Carol sighed, expecting nothing less from her best friend.
The light of morning had started brightening the gray sky when Steve woke up. The first thing he did was turn over to make sure that Tony was still in the bed with him. To Steve's relief, Tony was still there and snoring softly; peacefully asleep. Thankful, Steve got closer to Tony and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. He heard Tony softly mumble the word "sure," before snuggling closer and seemingly falling back to sleep. Steve stroked his hair gently and listened to Tony's calm, even breathing.
Walking towards the doorway to the stairwell, the Commander was quick to notice Agent Romanoff standing in their way. This couldn't be good.
"We're the Department of Homeland Security. We tend to get all hot and bothered when potential terrorist threats come up." Well, that made sense.
Getting to the end of the street, Jessica set Tony down to lean against the snowbank. Pulling her cell phone out of the hidden pocket in her pants, Jess hit the speed-dial number for Fury.
Happy first day of October, and a very happy birthday to Brie Larson! I hope she's enjoying it with the people she cares about.
Yeah, please ignore any issues regarding time-zones in the next couple of chapters. I don't have a good understanding of how they work and the public education system failed me. Thanks, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.
Tony wanted to smash his head through the nearest windshield. How had he gotten here? What on Earth did he do wrong? For the life of him, he couldn't figure it out. He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to throw something and watch it smash into a million pieces. Most of all, he wanted Steve. God, why did he run away from Steve?
"Well, that's what you get for being an ass." Natasha then left the room, returning the finger that she was almost certain Clint was giving behind her.
"Okay," she said. "You can stay in here until the nurse comes back with that spare set of scrubs. After that, you're going to have to move to one of the waiting rooms. Understand?"
"No," Clint said. "No, they won't. They'll be devastated and hurt that you didn't tell them something so serious while you were still alive."
Tony had to think about it for a moment. Although the idea of facing a group of people he was sure hated him was on principal unappealing, Steve's proposal did ease a lot of his hesitation. If things got bad, they'd leave. That assurance and show of support were touching. To add to that, a set of words came back to his mind.
"So, are you finally going to tell me who got infected, or are you just going to waste my time like everyone else?" Natasha remained silent. Sharpton sighed. "You know, I don't know what you people are waiting for. I've already confessed, so if you just tell me if anyone's been infected…"
"It's all that we have here that I think you want," he said. "If you don't like it, the exit's that way."
"Uh, JARVIS says he's ten feet in front of us and two-hundred fifty feet up." Thor and Steve exchanged puzzled glances before turning to look up at the cliffside behind them. Clear as day, Loki sat atop the cliff and even gave them a little wave. Steve's jaw dropped in disbelief.
was a Christmas movie. Apparently, Lara had a thing against watching Christmas movies between New Years and Thanksgiving (
Since he didn't want to push Steve into talking about anything he didn't want to talk about yet, Tony waited for him to speak up and change the subject himself. So, they ended up eating in silence for a good while.
Tony stopped talking when he heard what sounded like a weak whimper come from the other man. He stood to get a better look at Steve's face. His eyelids twitched at a rapid pace before coming apart to reveal the clear blue irises hidden beneath. Tony grinned.
Although, right now there really wasn't much he could do. In order to examine the letter thoroughly, he would have to take it out of the protective casing it was in and in order to do that safely, he would have to irradiate it. The hold up was that he couldn't irradiate the letter without permission from the CDC, so as a result, he was stuck in a
"It's not something you all need to know about," he said. "I didn't even need to know about it. I just overheard my mother talking about it with my Aunt Anne."
Natasha let go of Sharpton and took a step back. Sharpton started hysterically panting, fat tears rolling down her face. Nat only waited for her to compose herself enough to be able to put together a coherent sentence before questioning her further.
"Sit down," she said as she did so herself. "Make yourself comfortable." Tony just raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"
"I think," Adoniram said. "That we have found the perfect guinea pigs for their next experiment." Salinas slowly started reflecting Adoniram's smile, the meaning of his words clicking in his mind.
Several minutes and a few wrong turns later, Natasha felt she had a decent handle on the controls. She was making her way up Park, slowly ascending towards the top of Stark Tower when a blast whooshed by her head. Natasha turned to get a glance at the bogie on her tail.
"Whatever," Lara said. "That's not what I meant. Can you cut off the power to the elevator without messing up the building's whole set-up?"
"Awe, that's a shame," Steve said. "Good thing I still owe you one." Tony's face lit up with interest, much to everyone else at the table's chagrin.
"Yeah, I figured." Tony rubbed at his forehead. "So, what is it that S.H.I.E.L.D. needs me to consult on at this ungodly hour?"
All at once the rhythm stopped. The stark silence drilled into her ears. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up. Something wasn't right here.
Within a few minutes, he heard two voices approaching from down the hall. He recognized them as Stark's and his assistants. He couldn't hear what they were saying until they walked into the room.
"I still don't see how that can devolve into this sort of catastrophic mess," she said. "I mean, I get it. I have days when I am loaded down with paperwork, too, but this? Come on." Tony sighed.
"No," Tony said. "You still haven't said anything to convince me, so I think it's still justified." Natasha sighed.
"Hello," he heard the man on the other end of the line say. Steve could feel his chest clench. He wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing.
Ripping the chute open with a force he didn't even know he possessed, Tony launched into another round of projectile vomiting. His eyes squeezed shut, and he was sure he was about to die. He heard people talking but couldn't make out what they were saying over his gagging. The only thing that he knew for sure was that the hand that started rubbing gentle circles across his back was Steve's. That provided some level of comfort.
"Good." Tony could feel himself becoming more and more relaxed. "What about the armor? Is it still fully functional?"
"My apologies, Sir," JARVIS said. "But there seems to be a matter with your health that requires your urgent attention."
"Of course not," Dante said with a voice full of pure disgust. "I would never follow a false profit."
"Have you been talking to anyone else?" Tony frowned and remained silent. "I'll take that as a no." Tony scoffed.
"Why don't you lean back?" he asked. "Try to relax?" Reluctantly, Tony set the clipboard down on his lap and did as he was asked. Admittedly, the seat was quite comfortable. It was real, dark brown leather and whatever it was stuffed with was soft beyond compare. It would be hard
"But I'd have to…" Lara stopped mid-complaint and shook her head. "Whatever never mind. Is there anything else you need?"
"They've been protesting in the lobby since just after the press conference," Cabe said. "They've been sitting out there and have been refusing to move." Tony let out a sigh of exasperation.
They took one of the SUVs rather than any of the sedans or sports cars Tony owned. It was far less conspicuous and could fit all five of them relatively comfortably. (Relatively in that Tony had to take the middle seat if he wanted to sit next to Steve, but honestly in his opinion it was a fair trade.) It took all of ten minutes to get there, but to Tony it felt like they essentially teleported. All he could remember was getting in the car, feeling squished, then getting out of the car with practically no time passing in between. It was rather alarming.
"What do you mean you 'don't know?'" Natasha asked. "You just let Stark fly off to who-knows-where to do God-knows-what. Did he even say where he was going?"
even existed. Thus, the minion that had labeled himself "Hawkeye" had assured his master they wouldn't be found. Despite the assurances, Loki remained on edge. He had pairs of the soldier-minions patrolling the corridors every few minutes under strict instructions to kill anyone unfamiliar on-sight. He couldn't have anyone disrupting the construction of the machine. If he didn't have that completed and the invasion of Earth taking place on time, well, he didn't want to imagine what would happen to him.
Honestly, couldn't explain because she was only just realizing how badly she messed up. She had forgotten that as far as the United States government was concerned, Carol Danvers was dead. She never bothered to get the declaration of her death reversed. It never really mattered because she was rarely on Earth. Well, now it mattered.
"You did it," she congratulated. "I'm so proud." Tony felt a little twinge in his heart, thinking of all the times Pepper had to clean up after his drunken antics over the years and how long she'd probably been waiting for him to take this step. He knew nothing he could say or do could instantly make up for it, but he hoped that the hug could be a start.
"Thank you," he said. "I appreciate it." Lara cracked a smile, which sent another jolt through his body.
"Alright, look," Clint said. "I don't want to cause any trouble. I haven't seen Stark and this has nothing to do with what's happening." The demon threw itself against the door and started scratching again. "Oh, come on!" Clint bumped his foot against the door and the scratching stopped, but it was followed by a distressed whine. "Shut up, you're fine!"
"Seriously?" Tony questioned. "Why don't you go and say that to the buzzards outside?" Rhodey frowned and knelt so he could be more eye-level with him. Tony refused to look at him, causing Rhodey to let out a sigh.
"Alright, fine," he said. "I admit it. I'm not okay, but I'm also not going to keel over at any second, so you can just relax." Natasha's posture only got more rigid.
Salinas then opened the door and walked out, leaving Adoniram alone in his study once again. He took a deep breath in and out. The playing field had just changed radically. However, he had been prepared for this, so it didn't come as a total surprise. He needed a moment to process all the changes and events. God, old age was making him weary.
"I don't know for sure," Natasha said. "But in my opinion, Fury left the fake report in there so that way whoever planted it wouldn't be tipped off."
"Romanoff's jumpy," the voice he could now guess was Tony's said. "I should have expected that. Besides, you almost stabbed Bruce in the eye when you first met him. You're not one to talk."
"I wish I could say I came to give you a warm welcome back," Romanoff said. "But I'm afraid we have more urgent matters to discuss."
They had him on a few different drugs to ensure that he was at least semi-comfortable, but there was nothing they could do to stop the vomiting. After all, his body needed to purge itself of the toxins and unfortunately, puking was the best way of doing that.
"Of course not," he said. "Unless Tony tells me to go, I'm not going anywhere." Rhodes' smile widened.
"That still doesn't make it the right thing to do," Tony pointed out. "The right thing for me. Please, Steve, just tell me what you really think."
"Tiberius Stone. Where is he?" Steve was not sure how, but Rhodes somehow managed to look completely surprised and unsurprised at the same time.
If it wasn't already clear, most postal services use beta radiation to irradiate the mail. It was strong enough to get through paper but wasn't too strong and didn't hold as large of a risk of harming someone as gamma radiation did. (To note, the concern of wide-spread cases of Hodgkin's Lymphoma was more of a concern with gamma radiation than a wide-spread Hulk outbreak. Remember, it wasn't gamma exposure alone that created the Hulk.) The aluminum lining could provide a case for the powder being active. When the moisture strip was added to the mix, it didn't create a pretty picture.
"Good morning, St… What are you wearing?" Steve looked down and realized he was still wearing his suit from the night before.
"How did you find out?" Tony tried to snort like he had just heard a funny joke, but his nose was starting to run, so it just came out sounding pathetic.
One, I struggle with depression and August is usually the worst month for me because of the extreme heat which makes me miserable and...
"It's fine then," she said. "I know plenty of people who have bad reactions to that sort of thing – Tony being at the top of that list – so believe me, you're fine. You didn't even hurt me." Lara could feel tears pricking at her eyes, so she directed her gaze back down.
"It's too late," he said, taking both Lara and Tony by surprise. "You guys woke me up before you could even prank me. You were going to prank me, right?"
"I know," he said. "You, Pepper, and Happy have been dealing with this for years and if anyone knows what this is like, it's you guys, but the thing is… I feel like I'm doing more to hurt him rather than help him." Rhodes raised an eyebrow.
"Nothing too concerning," Wylie said. "Just a general feeling of delirium; not being sure of where you are and what's happening around you.

"Uh… Sleep, eat, shower… The basic stuff you need to do for survival?" Lara gave him a look of disbelief.
"And I'll expect you'll be duly disappointed when your boss educates you on how a matter of national security takes prescience over a silly squabble over jurisdiction." Bergeron was glad she couldn't see him roll his eyes over the phone.
"Yeah, well not this time." Tony turned back to the cops again, who was still in the parking lot, sitting on their hands. He let out a sigh of exasperation. "Seriously? You know I could really use some help down here!" One of the cops shouted something unintelligible. "What?" The cop shouted again, but Tony's attention was pulled away by the sound of feet kicking up sand and bare skin slamming against metal.
"…We have no confirmation of any deaths at this point, but police are asking people to stay out of the area."
"You have to be alive to have a life," Tony pointed out. Lara glared at him as she forced herself to sit up.
Looking down in horror, Knežević saw that in the rush of emotion he had grabbed Audrey's hand. He let it go, but it was too late. The stone was already crawling up her arm. He grabbed Stephanie to pull her back, but that proved to be another fatal error. When he grabbed her, he didn't realize that she was wearing a spaghetti-strap tank top and his palm encountered her bare skin.
"Mr. Stark!" Tony looked up from where he was messing with his IV tube and gave a sort of half-dazed smile.
"Excellent," Lucy said in an overly cheerful voice. "If you'll just follow me into our offices, we'll get you settled in and started in a jiffy." Lucy gestured to a (thankfully) well-lit storefront about five yards diagonal from them. Lara nodded and started to get up, but Bruce put a hand on her shoulder to stop her.
"Of course, I heard about it," he said. "Why else do you think I hauled ass down here?" Steve did not have an answer for that, but luckily for him Rhodes didn't wait to find out. "Is everyone okay? They're saying on the news it was a missile." Steve nodded assuredly.
"I can't help but wonder if your emotional state stems from a lack of fulfillment. Tell me, Mr. Stark, do you feel satisfied with where you are in life?"
I am just a villain vying for attention from a boy, a boy who can't decide and here's the reason why...
"So, if they asked you to steal information from the company, it'd be safe to assume that you would do it, right?"
"You're okay?" he said, scanning his eyes up and down Tony's body to be sure he hadn't missed any injuries.
"Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner!" Pepper rolled her eyes at the remark, but quickly shifted to a more reassuring expression.
"Alright, fair enough," he relented. "But at least let me exit out of the thing I was doing properly."
"Yeah," Stark said. "Besides, I'd hate to see how the Other Guy would react to being locked in a sterile, five-by-nine box."
"Yes, you do," she said. "You're coughing like that and you have a heart condition. That can't be safe or healthy or…"
Once they were down the stairs, Pepper approached them. Before he could say anything, Tony found himself pulled into a hug. Although it was warm and friendly, Tony couldn't quite relax into it, still somewhat worried. Pepper moved her head so she could speak right into his ear.
"I think someone tampered with the report that I made on Stark," she said. "I just need to see it for myself." She flipped open the file and began to search through the numerous forms and information sheets S.H.I.E.L.D. had on the billionaire-turned-superhero.
"I'm good, thanks." Salinas nodded before taking off down the hall again. Tony turned his gaze to the ceiling.
"…And this brings us to our last exhibit," Viv's voice said, capturing both men's attentions before Tony could respond. "Celebrating one of America's greatest heroes!"
"Please tell me it hasn't destroyed anything yet." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. He could already feel the headache coming on.
The news had given some helpful insight as to the scene they'd be walking into. Although none of the news media could tell what was going on inside of the building, they were able to confirm that the police had everything from East 53rd Street to East 34th street blocked off and Park Avenue was almost completely shut down. Good thing the New York Police Department was taking his warnings seriously. He couldn't imagine how bad the loss of life would be if they didn't start getting people out now. As he got closer to the building, he heard JARVIS' voice speak up once again.
"Oh," she said, rushing to stand up and get to the door. She moved so fast that she almost tripped over herself. "Je suis vraiment désolé! I am so sorry! I'm stupid! I didn't mean to…"
"I was just worried that what happened a few months ago was happening again," she explained. "If it was, I wanted to be here for it."
"No ma'am," Natasha said. "Stark is responsible for his own behavior. We as his teammates and employee are responsible for not responding correctly to his behavior and not keeping a close enough eye on him when we knew he was intoxicated. I'm just curious as to why S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't intervened when they knew this could be an issue for a while, and especially when they were directly involved in an incident that traumatized him and quite probably made his mental health worse."
"Tell you what, Agent," Tony said. "I'll only give the files over if I can talk to Fury myself. I'm not just going to hand over the information my father purposefully safe-guarded without knowing what it's going to be used for.
The only thing that Steve had asked to be added to the room was more blankets. Even though they had told him that his body temperature was back to where it was supposed to be, he still constantly felt cold and was practically shivering at times. Nonetheless, the agents complied and got him as many blankets as they could find. Currently, Steve was wearing the warmest-looking set of sweats that S.H.I.E.L.D. had provided to him and had at least six sets of blankets piled on top of him. He still felt cold.
The automatic thought that popped into Clint's head was 'you did that to yourself,' but he quickly stamped it out. If something like that happened to him, he'd get tired of people telling him that it was his fault very quickly. So, he forced himself to stay quiet.
"I'm not just talking about you, Clint. We're all recovering from something in some shape or form." Natasha looked down, nodding her head.
"Well, that was my mistake," she said. Tony heard her chair screech back as he assumed, she stood up. "I'm going to get my clothes from my desk and take a shower far away from here, so feel free to fornicate all you like." A smirk broke out across Tony's face.
"No," he said. "You're not fine. You're very clearly not fine. You need to sit down and collect yourself."
"Yeah," Steve agreed. "Now more than ever." He pressed a kiss to Tony's temple. "Is there anything you need from me right now?"
I hope I haven't confused anyone with this. I really am sorry for not planning better. To be honest, I was hoping to have this story finished by this point, but things don't always go as you hope. That should be the title of my autobiography...
"You feel attracted to both?" Tony nodded. He kept waiting for Peggy to pull her hand away, but she never did. Instead, he just heard her take a deep breath and say, "well, isn't this a sense of déjà vu." Tony slowly pried his eyes open, turned, and looked at her. Her eyes were filled with nothing but kindness and understanding. "Do you want me to take Sharon from you? She looks like she's going to be fussy there in a moment."
Steve laid across the living room couch, an arm draped over his face; trying desperately to fall asleep. He got only an hour at most after Tony tucked him in that morning. He wished he could say that he did not know why he felt that way or what triggered it, but that would be a straight up lie. He was concerned for Tony, which obviously was not unusual, but what truly sparked it was the question Tony asked him as he drifted off to sleep.
Nina allowed Oswin to gently push her by the shoulders back into the house. Together, they navigated their way into the living room and stopped in front of the small, tan loveseat. Oswin motioned for Nina to sit down and she did as she was told.
, Steve," she said. "I've already lost half of my family. If I lose the other half…" Natasha swallowed hard. "I won't take that. Not at all."
"You know what, save it," Tony said. "We don't have time for bullshit excuses. Once we figure this out, we can go our separate ways. ¿Comprende?"
"That would do it," the doctor said. "Luckily, the condition is highly treatable. All we'd have to do is a bone marrow transplant and a couple of blood transfusions and you should be all set."
"Oh," Tony sighed with disappointment. Carol sucked in the corner of her mouth and pulled her hand back.
"Just ignore them," he said. "Salinas and the Church both. We don't have beef with them and as far as we know, they don't have beef with us. We don't even know what they want in the first place. It could be completely unrelated." Tony brought his glass to his lips again but was met with confusion when he found it to be devoid of any liquid.
"That's Gabrielle Giffords," Tony explained. "She was a Congresswoman. Someone tried to kill her last year. I think she was shot." Steve's eyes went wide for a moment, but quickly relaxed into a look of sympathy as he turned to look at Giffords. If he wanted to say something, he couldn't, as the President began to speak.
"Tough shit," Fury said. "You've got a lot of people worried sick about you. It's time to get you back to where you belong." Tony couldn't help but laugh.
Oswin clung to Nina's stone form as she sobbed. She had followed Agent Duran out the door and chased after Knežević after the agent's attempt to shoot him had failed. She followed him for a good three or four blocks before she inevitably lost him. At that point, she had returned to Nina's side. She was too late.
"I sort of get that," he said. "When I did, I don't want to know it's coming. It'd be much easier that way."
"That's alright," she assured. "Take your time. You don't need to wolf it down all at once." Carol pulled the bag of pretzels open. "Do you want any pretzels? They might help your stomach."
The music that could be heard coming out of the plane's speakers. Thankfully, it wasn't one of the louder songs on Tony's playlist, but it was still very different from what Steve was used to hearing. It seemed to be entirely composed of guitars and drums and sort of an overall unusual sound to it. Eventually, Steve had to ask.
When the sky started to lighten up, Natasha's phone buzzed. She picked it up, texted a reply, and within a few minutes, it buzzed again. It continued like that the rest of the way into the city. Steve didn't ask who she was texting, but he did hope that whoever it was, she was talking about what just happened because she needed to talk about it with somebody.
Loki could feel an ice ball forming in the pit of his stomach. Fear was creeping into every cell in his body.
"Good to know," Dr. Wayne said. "And you'll be glad to know that you're both in safe hands. We have nothing but the best people trying to narrow down exactly what's happening here."
"That was only a taste of what lies in wait for you should you try resisting again," the masculine-sounding creature said. "Submit or you shall know true pain." Loki tried to put whatever he could into his expression to show that he understood. The creature then continued to drag him to wherever it was he was being taken.
Across his waist, Tony could feel a band digging into his skin despite the soft padding that was supposed to keep it from hurting, holding him down to the bed. Every time he tried to adjust his position, he found himself unable to do so, which sucked because he was cold and all he wanted to do was draw his legs and the blankets closer to him for warmth. That wasn't the only thing that was restrained. His wrists were pinned to either side of the bed and it felt like his hands had been balled up into fists and surrounded by pillows. His legs were still free, though, and he could move his head to either side. They also must have given him a sedative, because his head felt groggy and he was relatively calm about the fact that he was currently tied down to a bed. (He'd had some bad experiences with that sort of thing.)
"Don't be," Clint said. "I'm fine. We haven't started going on missions yet, so there's nothing to be worried about."
"Yes." The confirmation was all the permission the two of them needed to enter the room. When they walked in, Stark was sitting up and rubbing his eyes. "Why is the sun so loud?" He looked around. "Where's Steve? I thought he was coming."
"Yeah?" Steve was being a little hesitant about digging into his burger, even though he had seemed eager for one moment earlier.
I hope everyone enjoyed this chapter! This definitely was a little brutal on everyone, Tony especially. Things aren't looking good for him now, are they?
"And if someone 'wanders off'" Lara said, making a point to use air quotes. "Again, standard procedure is to call the police. Hell, in some cases skipping the police and going straight to the FBI would probably be the better decision."
"That's right," Everhart said. "He and your father were friends." Tony could feel his whole body tensing up.
"Captain Rogers," he heard a woman's voice call out as he passed by. Turning around he saw a woman wearing a medical staff's uniform standing in the entrance to an adjacent hallway. "I was sent to get you. Mr. Stark has been asking for you." Steve's heart leaped.
He didn't know what happened when Loki touched the scepter to his heart, but whatever it was it felt amazing. With just that one touch he felt as though he gained all the knowledge in the universe at once, and all that knowledge was telling him that he must serve Loki, so that's what he did. He only thought of serving Loki, and if his thoughts began to stray from that purpose or doing what Loki asked of him, he would relive that whole nightmare scenario all over again. He'd run to the house, see it blow up, know that Laura and the kids were gone, find Nat, and then… Then it'd be Budapest all over again. Then he'd be set on the right path and continue to do as he was told; no questions and no resistance.
"It's a possibility," Bergeron said. "We have no solid evidence to confirm or deny it, though. My staff is going through the CCTV footage and interviewing all Stark Industries employees on the premises."
"That was the CDC," she said. "Tony's blood test came back clean along with Steve's and Romanoff's."
Steve looked from Tony, back to the redheaded woman in front of them. Even though she was shorter than the both, she had sort of a natural air of intimidation airing from her, indicating that she was tougher and stronger than she looked. The black uniform and the insignia patches on her sleeves indicated that she was an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., which caused Steve to look down at the tracker bracelet confused. He hadn't pressed the button, so why had S.H.I.E.L.D. shown up? He spun it around on his wrist, trying to figure out if he could have jostled the little metallic band in some way that would have caused the tracker to be activated.
"Yeah, but now I can't lock it!" Tony said. "You'd think that'd be important to someone whose house just got broken into."
"No," Lara said. "They don't have shields. The work for an agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. or are at least wearing their uniforms. They do have handguns and rifles, though."
Yes, Steve was attracted to Tony, but this whole thing had gotten out of hand incredibly fast, so much so to the point where Steve was starting to wonder if Tony was attracted to him, too. Not only was the idea preposterous, it was also dangerous. Although it was incredibly unlikely that the attraction was mutual… Hell, if anyone found out that Steve liked boys and had an interest in Tony, they'd probably have Tony locked up in the asylum for fear that he was like that as well. Steve wasn't afraid of anyone finding out about him. As stated before, taking a bullet to the brain was preferable to him over spending a lifetime in an asylum, but if Tony was going to face that fate because of him… The awful feelings that stirred up made Steve glad he wasn't thinking about that. He'd rather have pointless musings about red than think about that possibility.
"That doesn't bother me," Bruce said. "As long as she's happy, I'm happy for her." Lara broke into a smile. "What?"
The feeling of a rush of bee stings up his limbs broke Steve out of that train of thought. It was the same feeling one would get if they sat on their knees for a long time and then stood up. Steve tried to move his limbs to ease some of the pain, but that proved to be futile. His arms and legs were weighed down by something heavy and warm.
"Let me just give everyone a head's up." Steve got up off the bed and started walking towards the door.
"So, what do you think?" Clint asked Natasha as they stepped off the elevator. From the way her mouth was set, he knew he wasn't going to like what she was about to say.
It hit the ground, but everyone was fine. No one was hurt, everyone made a nice, calm, orderly exit and I was like 'seriously? This can't be real.' I mean, if a plane really fell out of the sky like that, wouldn't everyone be killed or at least gravely injured upon impact? I'm not wrong here, am I?"
After opening a letter filled with white powder, Clint has contracted a very serious and potentially deadly illness.  Now, it's up to Steve and Natasha to bring the people responsible to justice.
"It can't be fixed!" Subarian said. "There is no cure for Ebola or H5N1! That's common knowledge! I don't know what you were expecting!"
"Because I did a really good job in school and Miss Riley wrote on my report card that I'm a delight to have in class." Clint raised his eyebrows.
"Call it, Captain." Steve resisted the urge to smile as he felt a little flutter run through his heart. It was nothing unpleasant, he was just grateful that for the first time in days he and Tony were working together and on the same page. Even if they failed here, if they died, at least they wouldn't die angry with each other. That was a small comfort as Steve put his leadership cap on and got down to formulating a plan.
The sharp, shocking pain radiated through Carol's skull and down the rest of her body. As this was happening, Beta dealt multiple blows to her face. Carol could taste blood at the back of her throat and knew that wasn't a good sign. Despite all the pain, though, she wasn't thrown off from generating energy like she had been the first time. In fact, the energy seemed to spread through her body faster, and within moments the heat was too much for Beta to take. She pulled her legs off Carol's arms, something she immediately took advantage of by grabbing her by the waist and reversing their positions, so Beta was forced to the ground.
Since the Avengers' quarters were on the second level of the penthouse, it was a relatively short ride for three out of four of them. Clint, Natasha, and Bruce got off the elevator as soon as it made its first stop, while Steve remained on board to continue his ride up to the fourth level, which served as his and Tony's apartment. Nat headed straight to her door – the one closest to the elevator – with Clint on her heels.
With that, he turned back and continued leading Carol down the hall, feeling a few pairs of eyes staring at their backs. Holding the foyer door open for her, Tony could see Clint, Natasha, and Rhodey all exchange concerned looks. That would have made him nervous if he didn't lock eyes with Steve and saw nothing but besotted trust in the other man's eyes. Tony gave him a smile that he hoped conveyed all of the emotions that were fluttering around in his heart before stepping through the door. Then it was down to business again.
"I know," he said. "And I'm glad. …Grateful, really. …More than grateful, I…" Tony locked eyes with Steve and by doing that, he must have seen all the nervous hesitation he was holding deep down inside. He moved to take Steve's hand, rubbing his thumb across the back of it much like Steve had done to his hand earlier. "I know this is scary for you." Steve snorted at the understatement.
"Self-defense?" Dante questioned. "Is that what you're going to tell the cops? You're going to tell them that I was beating on you and you hit me?"
The worst part was it wasn't over. Carol could feel it in her bones. Loki was only a precursor. The rest of the Black Order was bound to come back, and this time there would be no mercy. That was why she rushed to Avengers Tower. That's what she thought was happening. However, it turned out to be a false alarm, and while she should probably be angry about that, Carol was just relieved it wasn't time for round two. They were all safe.
"Trust me," Subarian said. "It is! It speeds up the rate at which the disease matures and deteriorates inside the body, making it so the person is only infected for twenty-four hours until the bug dies."
"Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?" Fury asked. At the same time, one of the scientists announced that the energy levels were starting to spike again. Clint watched as everyone rushed to their respective screens.
"Just come out when you're ready to talk. I'll be waiting." Steve tilted his head back and squeezed his eyes shut. All he could do was wonder what in God's name was he supposed to do next.
Well, that wasn't completely disturbing. To be honest, the biggest thing here is that I hope no one's still pissed at me for the last chapter or pissed that I didn't immediately follow up on what happened the last chapter. Sorry, for some reason my brain wouldn't let me change the plan. This HAD to be chapter sixteen for reasons I don't fully understand myself and I'm the person writing it. Anyways, don't be shy. Leave a comment or a review if you liked this chapter!
"Hundreds of millions of dollars…" Oswin drifted off for a second, imagining everything that she'd be able to do with that kind of money. However, she couldn't let herself get carried away. Forcing herself to come back to reality, she said: "and if this ends up failing?"
"Yes, ma'am," Steve said with a nod before turning to head out into the hallway. Bruce and Clint followed suit, but Natasha continued to look at Carol suspiciously for a moment before finally taking steps to join the others.
"Well, my guest and I surely appreciate it." Viv then turned her gaze on Steve and suddenly the flirty smile was back.
"That's probably because he was already poisoned when he drank the water." Carol turned around to see Dr. Smith walking into the room. She held a grey device with a black screen that projected green and red digital lettering. "I did a tox-screen. No traces of
"That all could be true," she said. "But even if it is, I think you should look at this as an opportunity."
"I still don't see a point," Thor said. "Why construct such a vessel when you can easily get a bird to take you where you need to go."
"Mr. Stark," he heard an exasperated woman's voice say. "We've run every test we're capable of performing here. All of them came back normal for a man of your height and weight, and scans showed that none of the shrapnel around your heart has moved. You're perfectly fine. There's nothing wrong."
Steve wondered briefly what that was about but decided to just brush it off for now. Instead, he followed Wylie to the office and listened as the other man explained how to make a call. Apparently, now you had to dial the number yourself instead of waiting for the operator to connect the call. Also, for some reason you had to dial the number nine first before dialing the rest of the number to get the call out of the building. Other than that, it didn't sound as complicated as he was expecting. He thanked the agent for his assistance and waited for the other man to step out of the room to sit down and make the call.
There are many things we aren't meant to overhear as children. Sometimes, it's just a little tidbit of information that isn't too consequential when it really comes down to it. Less often, it's something that completely traumatizes them for life. However, unfortunately for Steve, it was the latter of the two.
After that, I'm going to be taking another break from posting. I don't know how long it's going to last because it depends on how long it takes me to hit a certain story point. Once I hit that story point, I'm going to pause writing this fic to work on a little extension of it. Basically, there's a story point that I originally planned to be in this story (it's in my outline and everything) but the more I've written this story the more I've realized that it doesn't really jive with the rest of it - partially for content reasons, partially for pacing reasons - but I think it's kind of important to not only Steve and Tony's relationship but also gives some insight into Tony and Rhodey's friendship. (You heard it here, folks! Rhodey's actually going to cooperate with me for this! It's a Thanksgiving Miracle!)
On the other side of the vinyl sheet, Tony could hear a door opening and could only guess it was the doctors and nurses that were monitoring them rushing in. He climbed out of bed and laid flat on the cold laminate floor to try to peer under the sheet. No dice. A black rubber strip covered the gap between the floor and the sheet, leaving Tony unable to see anything. Annoyed, he slammed his palm against the ground and stood up. Brushing the dust off his hospital gown, he heard the other door open behind him.
Loki smiled. He wanted to say it. He wanted to throw it right in Thor's face. No one controlled him. Not Odin, not Thor, not even
"Uh," Lara said. "The last movie I saw advertised as staring them was back in 2010." She shrugged. "I don't pay attention, though, so they might have been in something since then."
"Still, that wasn't a good thing to have to go through." She brushed the back of her hand against the back of his in a comforting gesture.
"I'm fine," Tony assured while wincing slightly at the dark reference. "I have a little bit of a cold, but I'll live. Just need to take a shower before I have to catch my flight."
"I mean, I didn't even know that you were going to be here until Commander Hill brought me here." A look of astonishment crossed Bruce's face.
The only acronym Tony understood in there was 911, and he guessed ST stood for Stark Tower. He was just about to hit the call button on the phone when suddenly Lara followed up with another text.
Reaching the couch, Tony and Steve sat down with hands still clasped together. Lara, Bruce, Clint, and Natasha all exchanged looks. Through some form of unspoken communication, they decided that Nat would speak first.
"Natasha?" he said. Whatever he was playing at, she didn't want to find out. She hit him hard across the temple, causing him to collapse to the floor, unconscious.
"It was before I even called to tell you he was missing." Freeman brought his hands up to the top of his bald head.
About fifteen minutes into the movie, Bruce and Pepper returned. The burn on Pepper's face ended up being a minor second-degree burn, but thankfully it didn't appear to Bruce like the cut needed stitches. Instead, Pepper could get away with a bit of burn ointment and some pain killers. However, she had to leave the burn uncovered so it could heal properly, which left her feeling a little self-conscious. Everyone was quick to assure her that it wasn't that bad – which it wasn't, all things considered – which came to her relief.
"I still don't get how this Skype thing works," Knežević said. "You're going to be on a phone, I'm going to be on a computer… How can a phone call a computer? Also, you said I'd be able to see everything, but I don't see how that's going to work."
Lying back down, Tony ran his fingers over the fabric of the comforter. It was a metallic, silky material in a blue a few shades lighter than the wall. Slowly, Lara's words came back to him about how he had been depriving himself of comfort. He wasn't going to lie, that stung and almost made him retreat into the kitchen for that bottle of Jack Daniels he kept in the cabinet under the sink. However, now he had enough clarity to know that it only stung because it was true. He denied himself comfort; from Steve; from his friends; from his surroundings; from everything. Everything except the bottom of a bottle, and while he wasn't wholly sober yet, he could see at least a bit of what he'd been missing out. Rolling onto his side, Tony wrapped his arms around one of the pillows and allowed himself to relax, taking deep, calm breaths in and out.
"I'll give you five minutes," she said. "After that, you are going back to the hospital and Captain Rogers is returning to S.H.I.E.L.D. Is that clear?"
The board could not wait for that process to finish, though. They wanted answers ASAP. Tony could not blame them. Well, at least partially. He was not known to be the most patient person when he wanted answers. He did hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. after they would not tell him what they wanted with the Tesseract, after all. However, instead of having the ingenuity of finding the answers themselves, the board members would rather pester Tony about it for all eternity, which was just a joy.
Steering her mind away from such dour thoughts, Natasha tossed the magazine back at Clint and nudged him with her foot. He playfully smacked her on the leg, which caused her to respond with further attacks by her feet. Very loudly, the concierge cleared his throat and gave the two of them a stern look. Nat let out a chuckle while Clint pushed her feet out of his lap. She couldn't help but think that what she said to Loki all those months couldn't ring any truer than it was now. Love was for children and she and Clint got on like toddlers at best.
"We ended up finding this little guy, though." Clint scratched behind the puppy's ear. "So, it wasn't all that bad." Hill gave Clint a strange look before turning to Natasha.
." Steve realized she was right as Natasha leveled her suspicious glare at Carol, who for the most part seemed unphased. "Were you here when the tower was struck?"
"I'm sorry," was all he could think to say. Lara didn't flinch, but she didn't move her gaze away from the fixed point in front of her.
"What?" Tony struggled to find the right person to make eye contact with. "You can't? I think I live here or something?"
" Jessica squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath before she took off sprinting down the street. Already, she could feel a headache coming on.
"They cost about twenty-five bucks." Everyone looked at Lara. "I saw the little label card. I didn't drink any of it. Otherwise, we'd be having an entirely different conversation right now at the nearest hospital."
He started with the closest person he could find, the judge who had sentenced him to twelve years in prison. He was able to find him listed in the white pages and he lived only a few blocks from Lorraine. Breaking into the man's house, he found the honorable judge asleep in his bed with his wife. Careful not to do anything to awaken them as he approached the bed, Knežević grabbed ahold of both of their arms. They both let out sharp cries of shock and horror at the sudden contact and the intrusion, but before long they were completely silent, their skin and inner linings of their bodies now turned to stone. Knežević didn't even stay long enough to watch them suffocate to death. He was already on to the next one.
"Okay." With one last kiss, the two of them pulled back. Steve spared a glance at their food, which had since gone cold.
"Like I said before," Tony said. "I only got two minutes in before you sent the doctor in to interrupt us. Plus, you people probably gave him more valium than he needed, so he's completely out of it right now. I wouldn't be surprised if he's forgotten that I even spoke to him by now."
Whether they knew it or not, taking their congregation indoors meant giving up their right to freely gather and express their religious views. If they wanted to hold a public event, they needed a permit from the city and permission from the property owner to gather there. The People's Unity Church had neither. The first time they got thrown out, the Church claimed that they couldn't legally gather. However, they kept coming back, so they couldn't exactly use that as an excuse anymore and in a way, getting thrown out of Avengers Tower worked in their favor.
"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny." He was quick to add a "no offense, Doc," once he realized that Bruce was still in the room.
Vasyl Knežević and instead of interrogating me further you should be looking for him! He's been touching people and turning them to stone! I've seen it happen with my own eyes! Please! You have to do something to stop him!"
"So," he said. "You're Steve Rogers… Or, supposedly you are. I wouldn't put it past S.H.I.E.L.D. to lie to me. They have in the past and I'm sure they will again, but that's a spy agency for you. I should have expected that. I must admit; this whole scenario goes well beyond reasonable belief. I mean, come on, a person surviving sixty-five years frozen in ice? Even if he is a genetically-altered super-soldier, that just doesn't happen. That shouldn't be possible. Maybe I just need to change my definition of possible. God, I remember my dad and Aunt Peggy telling stories about you…"
"Oh," Carol said trying to stifle a laugh. "Lucky for you, I can remember this." Tony gave her a questioning look, but Carol acted like she didn't see it. "Uh, it was hard," she said, pulling herself together more seriously. "I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't. I mean, as tough of a choice as it was to make, it was even harder to stick with it." Tony nodded in understanding.
Recovering quickly, Natasha was able to dodge the next few punches Clint threw at her and spun around to land a kick directly to his hip. Clint fell back while Natasha used the opportunity to slip under the metal grating of the catwalk and spring back up behind him, managing to get another good kick in.
"Sure, they can." Tony knew what he was saying was bull, but Pepper clearly needed a little bit of hope now. "Aluminum and oxygen can form corundum crystals such as rubies and sapphires."
Given the large media presence, Tony instructed the S.H.I.E.L.D. driver to pull into the parking garage underneath the Tower, rather than dropping them off out front. They passed dozens of flashing lights and reporters with microphones screamed at them as they ran at the car, but once they were past the security gate, there was no longer anyone on their tail. Both Steve and Tony thanked the S.H.I.E.L.D. driver as they got out of the car, and Tony felt a little guilty that he couldn't tip the guy or even at least reimburse him for the fee he was going to have to pay to leave the parking garage. However, it couldn't compare to the guilt he was feeling for leaving his cellphone on the charger in his room.
The doctors had determined that Clint was healthy enough to be released from their care. He had been taken off the ventilator Wednesday evening and he'd been breathing on his own since then. His vitals had been steadily improving and were to the point where they felt that he was healthy enough to be out on his own and that he was no danger to the public at large (as far as contamination concerns went.) However, there were some restrictions applied.
"Yeah," Bruce said. "I hadn't planned on that. She found me and I just pulled her into that whole mess." Bruce ran a hand through his hair. "I put her in such a bad position. She even tried to sell her mother's necklace to get us enough money to get to New York. I got it back for her, but still…" Bruce lifted his head up, allowing Lara to see the glimmer of sadness in his eyes. "It's just best that I'm not around her. She's safer and better off that way." Lara frowned.
"Nope," Lucy assured. "The personality test is one-hundred percent completely free through and through. Our process is based on pure sociological research. You'll find it's not like the scams you see on the internet."
There is an old Latin proverb that says, "revenge is a confession of pain." For Knežević, it was more than just a confession; it was a declaration of sheer agony. Everything and everyone was to blame for the deaths of his daughters. If he never got laid off, he wouldn't have been working with dangerous chemicals in the first place. If his busybody neighbors didn't call the police and tell them they thought he was dealing drugs, then DSS never would have taken the girls away and he never would have gone to jail. If Lorraine hadn't kept his kids from him, he wouldn't have sunk to such desperate measures to try to get them back. If he hadn't met Oswin, then he wouldn't have gone so far as to steal chemicals from freaking Iron Man.
Turning his head to the left, he looked over towards the horizon. Short line of distance. Given this and the dirt that covered the rocky landscape, Loki concluded he was on an asteroid, which in his mind, didn't make sense. Asteroids didn't have breathable air or a strong center of gravity. That was the first sign to Loki that something wasn't right here.
…" Lara glared sharply at Tony as she let out the fake laugh. "What he means to say is we've had a rough day with the press."
Tony trailed his tongue down to Steve's jawline, where he started to leave tiny kisses as he made his way south. He paused for a moment to pay special attention to a part of Steve's neck that he knew made him moan when nibbled and was rewarded in kind. Continuing to travel downwards, Tony left a trail of kisses, nibbles, and hot breath that lead right down to the hem of Steve's underwear.
"Good news," Lara said once everyone had piled into the limousine, dressed and looking pretty for the cameras. "Your first interview is going to be pre-taped, not live."
"We view the surveillance footage," Natasha said. "If we see corroborating evidence, then we say something."
"Well, fuck you, asshole." Surprisingly, Clint found himself laughing. It didn't last long because he started coughing again, but for a moment he felt something akin to happiness.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I'm fine. Just a little sick to my stomach. I'm good." Tony tried to wave off Steve's concern, but that only caused Steve to frown and his eyebrows to knit together. Hesitantly, as not to startle Tony, Steve reached out and pressed the back of his hand to Tony's forehead.
Feeling the weight of a pair of eyes on him, Tony glanced to his right and saw Pepper staring at him, her gaze full of concern. Tony shut his eyes and tried to stifle the amount of air rushing out of his nose.
Sometime later, Loki awoke again. Everything ached, and he was taking that as a good sign. After all, if he could feel pain in all his limbs, then he wasn't paralyzed. Slowly peeling open his eyes, he saw nothing above him other than the white stucco of the ceiling. He tried to turn over but found it difficult as he was seemingly embedded into the ground. Seeing no other way to get out, Loki slowly and painfully hoisted himself up out of the hole. When he finally did, his body almost gave out on him again. However, he fought to stay conscious and came out of that battle victorious. After a few minutes rest Loki started pulling himself forwards, up the small staircase that lay just a few feet from him. That's when he finally took notice of their presence.
"Like what?" Lara went sharply white. That's when Bruce realized he crossed a line. He opened his mouth to apologize, but at that point, the elevator finally chimed, and the doors opened. Lara briskly walked out, and Bruce followed her, careful to keep a comfortable distance.
"I want to help you, Tony," he said. "I really do. I just don't know how. A soft look came across Tony's face as he flipped his hand around to clasp Steve's.
"Tony," he said as he shook Tony's shoulder. "Tony, wake up." Tony's eyes fluttered open and a soft smile appeared on his face.
"Hilarious," Duran said dryly. "If that's all you got, I think I'll take my search over to ATF. I'm sure Agent Ness will be ten times easier to deal with than you."
"We have ten minutes." Steve reflected Tony's smirk and moved so he was straddling his hips and leaning over him.
"Well, you're on the same team now," Pepper said. "You've saved the world together. That has to account for something."
The walk to the end of the street was arduous. It would have only taken a few minutes walking at a normal pace, but having to support an uncoordinated, poisoned man slowed Jessica down considerably. They almost hit a snag when the bus that brought the workers to Salinas' started coming up the road. Luckily, Jess was a fast thinker and Stark had a pair of blankets wrapped around him. She pulled one of the blankets off Stark and wrapped it around herself like a cloak, obscuring her face and the polo top. She told Stark to keep his head down and thankfully she didn't have to say it twice. She guided him as close to the edge of the road as she could without pushing him into a snowbank. The bus slowed down considerably as it passed and for a moment it made Jess worried. However, it seemed that the bus just did that to try to pass them without hitting them. Once it was around them, it didn't stop and continued to its destination. Jess let out a breath of relief.
"Then what is your goal?" Tony asked. "Because I don't understand why S.H.I.E.L.D. would suddenly need information from the project that created Captain America. What are you playing at?" At that point, Fury relented.
"I needed to know that there was hope," he said. "That I could get better; be better." Slowly, Natasha nodded in understanding.
"I've also been texting Pepper to keep her appraised of the situation," Lara said. "And she agrees with me on that. If we do it as they do it on the TV show, Tony's just going to cut us all out of his life and likely self-destruct soon after."
"And I imagine we'll be adding Irukandji Jellyfish to the list," Dr. Smith remarked. "There's no anti-venom for this. The most I can do is give you a shot of morphine and put you on oxygen, but you're going to have to ride this out until it leaves your system."
"He'll be fine," she assured. "He just needs to rest. In fact, I think his symptoms will go away if he just gets some sleep. The only problem is that he doesn't believe me when I say that there's nothing physically wrong with him."
Breathing heavily – mostly from the shock and anxiety of the whole situation – Lara stuck the electronic key Tony had given her into the designated slot and waited for the elevator to lurch upwards. It was only then that she allowed herself to walk over to the far wall and collapse.
Tony then bolted down the nearest stairwell. He had to hurry. Every second passed was a second wasted and lives were truly on the line.
The limo started to slow down and the flashes of cameras started to seep through the tinted windows. Lara's mouth became a hard line.
"Like I'm about to crash hard," he admitted. "Tell Barton and Banner no screwing around. I need to get to the car now." Romanoff nodded and took a step to the side to pass the message on. Tony turned to tell Steve the same thing and saw something that made him smile.
"Are you worried that they are going to be insensitive about you seeking help?" Dr. Cranston asked. "Because I assure you, there's nothing wrong with seeking help if you need it."
"All in favor, say 'aye.'" Natasha's instructions were followed by a chorus of ayes from her, Steve, and Bruce.
Even though Tony had resolved to be more honest with Pepper, he was having a tremendous amount of difficulty following through with that resolution. From the moment he could speak in complete sentences, Tony was expected to be a certain way; be a good boy and say the right things to the right people at the right times. Lying was second nature to him, particularly telling lies about himself. He could never admit he was in any pain or show any sign of weakness. Once you have that instinct embedded in you, it was all but impossible to remove.
Glancing over at his other side, he saw that Steve had taken his hand again. Although, he had pulled their hands out of clear view, Tony couldn't help but feel a tiny flutter in his chest at the display of affection. Steve had never done so much publicly before. It made Tony proud, especially since it stayed like that until the speech was over.
After accidentally poisoning Tony Stark, Jessica has called her friend Carol for help. Can they manage to save his life?
"I'll see you later." She then turned and went to escort Coulson back to the elevator. "Make sure you save some of that champagne for me." That caused Tony's lips to quirk upwards for a second, but not much longer than that. He opened his phone up to the messenger app. He'd been busy all day trying to get the tower up and running. He hadn't had time to check his messages after he texted Steve during brunch. When he finally got a look at his unread messages, though, he was met with heartbreak.
"Well, duh." Clint tapped the side of his head in a sort of "I should have known that," gesture. Laura laughed. "I love you, babe."
. He wanted to see his friends again; Bucky, Peggy, Howard… He wanted to see his mom again, which was weird. He hadn't thought about her in a long time but now for some reason, he couldn't stop thinking of her. Grief probably had something to do with it. He couldn't have what he wished for, though, and he knew that. Instead, he had to figure out what was the best decision to make given the available, terrible options. Not an easy task, especially when you're holding up an elevator that someone else might need to use.
"Five or six weeks," she said. "I hadn't even suspected anything yet." She looked down and Bruce maneuvered his pizzas to put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
Tony couldn't help but be pessimistic about dealing with the press. Although yes, he was an amazing showman who could have every single person in a room eating out of the palm of his hand, he had numerous public scandals that had left their scars. The worst one was the sex tape that outed him as bisexual. Not only was he not ready to come out publicly at the time, but he also wasn't even fully out of the closet with those closest to him. The only people who had known were Peggy (the only person he had willingly told), Rhodey (who found out after the sock incident), and obviously the men he slept with. The media had drug him through the mud so hard back then that he could still taste dirt in his mouth. Many of his personal and professional relationships had been damaged by it and any time someone had so much as tried to mention it, Tony wanted to throw up. He understood how much power the media held and how easily it could ruin your life.
With a flick of her hand, Carol sent the hologram away and went back to removing Stark's shirt. She figured she shouldn't be violating his privacy and could ask him about it when he was awake and coherent. Besides, it was a much more urgent matter to his health that she gets the wet clothes off him now. Otherwise, the rest of his body might end up looking like his toes.
"'Nothing's wrong?' What is that for an explanation? Why weren't you on the plane? Where are you? Are you okay?"
Given that this was an ultra-long chapter (made by stitching the remains of two smaller chapters together) I'm not going to put too much in the way of this authors note. If you like, please favorite, follow, review, comment, and/or subscribe.
"Son of a bitch!" Rhodey wanted to say so much worse, preferably while punching Stone in the face repeatedly. He deserved that in the very least, especially with what he knew was about to happen.
His heart was beating normally (or what substitutes for normal when you have a cluster of shrapnel embedded in your chest), he was breathing fine, and as far as he could tell he had no critical, life-threatening injuries. All that Tony had JARVIS reassure him of at least five times since he set foot back in the tower, but it only served to scare him even more. Why? Because if nothing was wrong with him, why did it feel like everything was wrong with him?
After running the foil through the mass spectrometer, Betty took a swab off the lipstick stain and ran it through. While she was doing that, Bruce turned his attention to the computer and began to research New Horizons Labs. As the letter claimed, it was, in fact, a subsidiary of the Roxxon Corporation and unsurprisingly, they were in Newark, New Jersey. However, there were a few surprising things that Bruce did discover. Namely, that the lab in question didn't deal with infectious diseases. New Horizons Labs largely dealt with over-the-counter pharmaceutical products and cosmetics.
Truth be told, Tony really wanted to believe that this was Steve Rogers, but there was this niggling feeling in the back of his mind that just wouldn't go away; the sense that something else was at play. Maybe not directly having to do with Steve, but S.H.I.E.L.D. had something else up their sleeves. Of that, Tony had no doubts.
Once they finished their conversation, Lara set to work confirming check-in times and interviews. Although they were flying over on Saturday at nine AM, Tony wanted to give themselves time to settle in and discuss their PR strategy. He also wanted to give Barton and Romanoff time to rest before they had to face the press. Although he had no idea where they were coming from, Tony told her that there was a strong possibility that they were crossing multiple time zones and likely to be jetlagged, so she planned accordingly. Plus, she also got the feeling that Tony wanted to put off dealing with the press for as long as possible, which was fine with Lara. It wasn't her funeral.
"There was a fire emergency a few blocks over," Agent Duran explained. "It's been contained, but residents aren't going to be allowed back in until tomorrow. Safety concerns and all."
"They threw Tony out," he said as he turned to look at Clint. There was nothing but sympathy in the other man's eyes.
"It's another ten-digit Stark lock," she observed. "I'll try that code again and see if that works." Knežević watched as she set the phone down again and the screen went black. He heard her enter the code a few times and curse when it didn't work. "I don't think that code works with this door. Sorry."
Loki looked on in awe. The chaos, the destruction… This was all his doing. Soon, Midgard would be his and from there, onto Asgard. His victory was within the mile. He could already see it. Absolutely nothing could stop him now.
Currently, she was heading back up to Tony's room to let him know that she had gotten off the phone with Col. Rhodes, who was being held up in Kuwait now but was going to visit him as soon as he was back on U.S. soil. She felt bad for the guy, but at least his visit would cheer Tony up. That's what she told herself as she tried to suppress a yawn. She also needed to be heading out. It was a long day and tomorrow was promising to be even longer. She wished she could stay a bit longer, but her eyes were growing heavier with each passing second. Pepper knew if she didn't get on the road now, she'd be liable to pass out behind the wheel and start a forty-two-car pile-up.
He also could see the person who had captured him before coming up on the faded peripheral of his vision. He reached down and grabbed Loki by the hair again, pulling hard.
"When I went under," he said as he walked. "The world was at war. I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost." Steve kept his gaze on his hands. Otherwise, he would have shot Fury a nasty glare. In that second, he was grateful Tony was kind enough to lay the truth on him right away. Otherwise, S.H.I.E.L.D. probably would have sheltered him from that, too.
"Just making sure everything is taken care of so my fella can get some restful sleep." Tony broke out in a huge grin.
"I must disagree," the taller man said. "Soul is one of the six creative forces behind the universe. It fuels all life. Since you are alive, you must have a soul." The clerk stood there with his mouth open as he tried to find the words to say.
"Yeah." Steve looked down. A small, barely noticeable chip on the edge of the table suddenly became very interesting. "I have since I was a little kid."
"Regardless," Stark said. "The point is probably mute anyway. If we're dying, Steve and Romanoff will probably know before we do. The way these people handle information, we'll be the last to know." Clint shrugged.
"Do whatever you want with them." He then stepped into the hallway, only to come to a halt once again.
Remember kids, sneaking out of the hospital is perfectly fine, especially when your immune system is compromised and you can barely stand on your own two feet!
Tony turned to look behind him while Steve stood up. Sure enough, Commander Hill was striding down the hallway, just as purposeful as ever. It was a safe bet that she was coming from the quarantine area. Tony started to stand as well, anxiety building in the pit of his stomach. He tried to determine by the way Hill carried herself whether the news was good or bad. However, it was useless. Hill was as stoic and calm as ever, with not a single feature betraying that image. She remained non-pulsed, even as she made eye contact with the two of them.
Either way, the ultimate outcome was that Tony had to go to the board meeting, forced or not. He did not put up a fight when Romanoff came to collect him (which came as a surprise to her) and took his usual spot next to Pepper once he made it to the meeting room. Romanoff sat to his right with a laptop open in front of her, fingers poised to start typing away. Likely she was taking notes for Lara so she would know what was going on when she came back. Lara always seemed to like to have detailed notes. Tony never really understood why.
The bags were carried off to an SUV waiting nearby. It wasn't the car they were going to be taking. That car drove by an SI employee and was meant to bring their luggage to the tower. The car they would be using was a Honda Odyssey. Tony couldn't remember his reasoning for buying it. Most likely, he purchased it on some impulse and forgot about it. However, it was a good thing that he did. It allowed all of them to move through the city without drawing the same amount of attention that a limo would (and did while they were in D.C.)
"So, this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?" Steve asked as the man who had introduced himself as Agent Phil Coulson came over. He had already read the files back at his apartment and had them memorized front-to-back. He still couldn't believe some of what he read through. Norse Gods? A man and a monster inhabiting the same body? The fact that they still had that faulty character report in Tony's file? All these things were somewhat beyond comprehension for Steve, but he couldn't say that he was honestly surprised by them. After all, he did just come from the 1940s where red-faced Nazis built magic guns that instantly vaporized people. Try explaining that to someone with a straight face and expect to be taken seriously.
"Uh," Betty said as she raised her hand in an awkward wave. "Hi, Bruce." Bruce gave her a slightly nervous, slightly shy smile.
"Hit me," she said, pushing her glass forward. Stark nodded and complied, filling his own glass as well. Natasha threw hers back hard and fast, giving her indigestion pains in her chest. She put a hand over her sternum as she looked Stark right in the eyes. "How do I get you to believe me?" she asked. "Please, just tell me. The team needs you to forgive me. I need you to forgive me So please, just tell me how to earn that.
Steve followed him to the bathroom but could only watch from the door as there wasn't much space. When he finished, though, Steve did help him by handing him some napkins to wipe off his face. Tony got up from the floor and did his best to rinse his mouth out using water from the sink. He heard once that if your mouth tasted like vomit, it would just make you throw up again. The best thing to do to keep that from happening was to brush your teeth, but Tony didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste on him, and the closest thing to mouthwash available on the plane was peppermint schnapps, and he wouldn't be allowed to use that. He'd have to make do with just straight water.
After being taken to the Hub, Bruce was led down to a lab and he immediately set to work. Betty wasn't there yet, but he knew it was a long way to New York from Virginia, so it was safe to assume she was still on her way. That was fine. It gave him time to think and get some work done.
Clint nodded before getting back under the covers and lying back down. Natasha patted his shoulder before getting up to leave the room, a genuine smile still on her face.
"Okay." Lara pinched the bridge of her nose. Maybe calling 911 wasn't as productive as she originally thought.
"Make it so," Adoniram said, clapping his hands over one of Salinas'. "Now, I must urge you to take your place for the service. We are going to begin soon."
Rubbing his eyes and looking away for a second, Adoniram was able to confirm that what he saw was real. He glanced over at Margot to see that whatever it was had caught her attention, too. Although it was hard to tell from this perspective, Adoniram was able to make out that the light was coming from the newly-constructed Stark Tower or some other building within that vicinity. At first, he thought it might be some sort of freaky, holographic light show set up by Tony Stark to celebrate the building's completion, that was until a massive hole opened in the sky and creatures on hoverbikes started descending from the sky. Although he had never seen them himself, he instantly recognized them from his many sessions with the shard over the years. These were the Chitauri; actual aliens from outer space.
"As optimistic as I'd like to be," Tony said. "It's still probably best for her to stay far away from the city until she at least has the wheels in motion to get legal protection from him."
It ended up being more than a moment because at first none of the questions were directed at him. He was pretty sure Romanoff, Steve, and Bruce got the first few questions, but he lost track after that. It wasn't until he heard someone say that they had a question for all of them that he perked up and started paying attention. Standing at the microphone, he saw a little girl – probably no more than eight or nine years old – wearing a silver helmet and carrying a toy version of an awfully familiar hammer. Her question was simple, consisting of only two words.
Well, that is an exaggeration. He got maybe one and a half to two hours of groggy, dreamless sleep, but obviously, the quality of it was not that good, so he might as well have not slept at all. On the upside, though, that meant that he did not have any nightmares. So, there was something good that came out of the ordeal.
"Uh, yeah," Bruce said. "I mean, not overly good. We talked at the start, but we haven't really… We've mostly just worked." To his surprise, he could hear Lara laughing on the other end of the line. "What's so funny?"
When they finally pulled up to the building, they found that the entire Maplewood Police Department had come out to greet them. There were even people in bathrobes and pajamas, looking as though they had teleported straight from bed to the station. Luckily – as far as Natasha could tell – no members of the media had gathered. So, at least that was a relief.
"It doesn't prevent you from becoming a carrier," Smith pointed out. "I'm sorry Captain Rogers, but for your safety and the safety of everyone else, I'm going to have to ask you and Agent Romanoff to remain quarantined here."
) However, he had to tone down his reaction for the cameras. He's got to keep the boyfriend in the closet, after all.
"I got a nuke coming in," Tony said. "It's gonna blow in less than a minute." He'd just passed over the Brooklyn Bridge, flying over the mouth of the East River when he finally spotted the missile. Without hesitation, he took off after it. "And I know just where to put it." He quickly managed to match the pace of the missile and flew up underneath it and grabbed a tight hold of it.
"Ah," she sighed as if she had been forced to run uphill with a boulder in her hands. Knežević could hear something large and metal being placed on the ground. "I just got the door to open."
"I don't know what to tell you, then," she said. "I told JARVIS to protect the file because I knew it was the safest thing possible to do."
"Dante didn't show up to court," Lara said. "That's how I was able to get everything approved so easily; no one was there to challenge the accusations."
"Oh, really?" A wry grin came across Steve's face. "And how exactly do you plan on doing that?" Tony smirked.
"I'm fine," Clint tried to dismiss, but Natasha did not look like she bought that even a single bit.
Once the letter was irradiated, both Bruce and Betty set about testing for everything they could think of. Obviously, they tested the powder for H5N1 and Ebola along with every other known disease. While they waited for their own results to come back or the CDC to get back to them with their results, they began to test the components of the letter.
Pepper did just that. Though, it clearly was taking longer than anyone would have liked. (You know, because it's Vista.) In the same amount of time, Tony had JARVIS locate the file Cabe had put on the flash drive and had him play it back on his phone. There was no audio, so no one was alerted to the fact that he already had the video up and playing, and Tony didn't go out of his way to tell them. Hey, that's what they get for forgetting the obvious.
"Your nose is stuffed up so much, it sounds like Tweety Bird," Stark said. "It's a pretty obvious tell."
"Everyone, to say the least," Rhodey said. "In fact, I was hoping you could enlighten me on that." Tony sucked in a breath.
"No thank you," she said. "I think I've tortured my stomach enough for today." Stark shrugged and took the last sip for himself before glancing at his watch.
"I'm serious," Tony said. "I mean, I know it isn't exactly the Palace of Versailles in here up here, but there are plenty of furnished rooms and fully-stocked kitchen downstairs. It's still not like we're suffering here.
"Yeah," he said. "I texted him earlier and we talked about all the stuff that happened in the last few days and he asked if I wanted him to be there on Saturday – you know, for moral support. I said yes, so he's coming over and he's going to stay the night."
With a sigh, Hill did as she said and walked into the building. Bruce followed her and Lara pulled up the rear, shutting the door behind her. The space they were in was tight as it led up to a flight of stairs, which probably led up to a set of apartments. Vaguely, Lara wondered if this was breaking and entering, though she swiftly shrugged the thought off. They were with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. If someone wanted to throw a trespassing charge at them, Hill could easily make it go away with a flash of her badge. Besides, they had bigger things to worry about. Taking a small step forward, she looked Hill directly in the eyes.
However, he knew that with this new villain, something had to be done about them. That's why he had taken an interest in Freeman. His position in Stark Industries put him close to a lot of big players, notably Tony Stark himself. If he could discover a weakness or flaw that Stark or the Avengers had, then maybe they could exploit it.
"Uff," Steve groaned as their bodies collided. He had to take a step back to regain balance. "You might want to take it easy there. I'm not as young as I used to be."
"What were you trying to ask me last night?" That question had preempted any sort of morning greeting as he woke up and caused Tony to furrow his brow.
Steve laid down but didn't get under the covers or touch Tony, which made him frown. Again, he felt like he was waiting for an explosion. He knew the words were coming, and he just wanted to have them out there.
Getting the message, Clint swallowed and instead said "that's a good decision you made, Tony. I think I can say we're all proud of you for it."
"No," Lara said. "At least, not directly. I need some comfort food first. I'm going to find some ice cream." Bruce raised an eyebrow at that.
"Okay." Oswin began typing her search into the engine. "Chemical labs near Lennox, CA." The page instantly changed and displayed results on screen. She quickly skimmed the list before reading it aloud. "There's West Manufacturing in Athens, Neilson-Edelman Corporation in Compton, Stark Industries in Hawthorne…"
Oswin awoke to the bright glare of the sun shining on her face. She could have sworn she closed the blinds the night before. Sitting up, her head began to thump, and she let out an audible groan.
"I'm sorry," Steve said. "Isn't everything?" If Thor didn't speak up, Tony would have let out all his building rage against Steve right then and there.
"In his corporate office with Lara," Steve said. "They're trying to come up with a good explanation as to what happened." Rhodes snorted.
"You don't have the Tesseract yet," Loki pointed out. The Other hissed and jumped in front of Loki, coming to stop in a position that looked odd, but would probably allow the Other to kill him easier if he was in front of him and not just a psychic projection. Loki maintained a calm assuring expression. "I do not threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command you are but words." Loki felt a bit of smug satisfaction. He had been wanting to say something along those lines for quite some time. It didn't last, though.
"My mom was a nurse," Steve explained. "And I also got sick a lot as a kid. I know it's dangerous to let a fever get up that high."
That's what he was doing when he touched the shard. He had Marx show him all the information that was archived on different poisons and diseases. Most of it was alien, however there were some information on Terran poisons. Apparently, most humanoid creatures were vulnerable to nerve agents such as Sarin and VX. They had different names depending on what part of the galaxy you were in, but they still had the same composition and were just as deadly. The only way a person could be exposed to the gasses and still survive without permanent damage was if the person was enhanced and they were only exposed for a short amount of time, which Adoniram had found interesting.
"Do you really think I'm going to do that?" he said. "Hell no. I spent the last decade in jail and I swore to myself I wouldn't die there. I swore that I'd make it back to Audrey and Stephanie…" He tried to take another swig from the bottle but found that it was empty. He threw it out into the ocean in anger and it sank rather than float back up to the surface. "Nah, man. I'm not going back to jail, and you can't make me."
Welcome back! I hope everyone remembers the story so far, and if you don't... Go back and read it yourselves! This is a free story on the Internet! I don't need to recap everything for you! Stop being lazy!
"His body temperature is low," she reported. "Brain activity is a little high, but not too far from being normal… Heartbeat is somewhat irregular but he's nowhere close to dead." Jessica let out a breath of relief and pulled her fingers away from Stark's neck.
"'Learned the truth?'" Lara questioned. "Oh, don't tell me you found Christ in jail. Praise be to Jesus!"
The second time Tony woke up, he felt something cold pressed against the back of his neck. He turned to see Steve leaning over him and pulling his hand away.
"The only thing I have to say for myself is that I feel like I'm about to have a stress-induced heart attack."
"Yeah, sure," Tony exchanged a look with Pepper, who stepped out of the way, so Steve could get by. "Have a seat." He gestured to the chair that Steve had previously occupied. Steve made his way over there and sat down. Pepper, meanwhile, went to the other side of Tony's bed and sat down in the other available chair.
Alright, now that we're done with our little detour, it's back to the main story! I appreciate everyone sticking with me as we take this little side route! Next chapter will focus more on Tony and Carol, so get exited!
"Pepper, I'm fine," Tony said. "And I promise I've learned my lesson. The second I'm not feeling fine, I'll tell you."
"Of course." She waved it off like it was nothing. "Easy as pie! Why? Are you offering me a job or something?"
"I can see that," the concierge said. "Now where is that search warrant?" Natasha sighed and slipped her badge into her back pocket.
"I'm in the middle of an interrogation," Natasha said. "This moron is giving me everything." It was apparent that the boss understood that remark as his eyes went wide.
"Okay." Tony slowly sat up and once he was able to get to his feet, Steve slung an arm around his shoulders to support him. He gave the doctor one last quick "thank you" before leading Tony out the door and down the hall.
Tony stayed in the bathroom for a long time after he finished throwing up because he was afraid that if he left, round four would sneak upon him. Steve stayed nearby, ready to jump in and help Tony if he showed any signs of distress. Eventually, Romanoff came over with a plastic bowl she found somewhere. It wasn't that big and could hold maybe one round of vomiting, but hopefully, that's all they would need it to do until Tony could make it to the bathroom. She handed it to Steve, who gave it to Tony, who took it with a dry, scratchy "thank you." They then proceeded back to their seats, where Tony had been sitting ever since.
"He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin, just to break through the Coulomb barrier," Bruce pointed out, saving Tony from continuing down that road any further.
Before she could finish knocking, Clint came to the door. He was all smiles as he stepped out and was quick to shut the door for behind him.
Tony's eyes went wide and his face paled. He wasn't wearing his jacket. Sweat started forming on his brow and he kept patting his abdomen as if doing so would magically summon his jacket. That didn't happen and real panic started creeping up in Tony's chest. He left his wallet in his jacket pocket along with his cellphone and his key to the hotel room. He tried to remember when he took it off but couldn't. If he left it at that party…
"Your mother's birthday." A fond smile came over Betty's face as she flipped her hand around to look at the ring herself.
"We don't normally do private tours this late at night," Viv said. "So, all of our eateries and the lowest level is closed. Our apologies for the inconvenience."
Tony felt Steve grab him and try to force him to the ground. In the distance, he could hear something that sounded like an explosion. Then there was another one, much closer. He could feel the heat from the blast and he and Steve were even thrown a few feet themselves. Glass broke. Alarms blared. Smoke filled the air. What on Earth just happened? As soon as the shaking stopped, Tony sat up, his eyes immediately locking on to Steve's.
Tony had been surprised. Freeman had made his allegiances clear the night before. He was going to have to discuss Freeman's continued employment at Stark Industries with Pepper once he was better, along with – and he hated the thought of this, but it was apparent it needed to be done – going through human resources training with the upper levels of management. Specifically, one employee, but everyone else was probably due for a brush up as well, and he didn't exactly want to single her out.
"Not safe for work." Tony gave her a disbelieving look. "It's also personal. I don't want to talk about it, just like you don't want to talk about what's bothering you."
"This." Lara pressed a button on the elevator's control panel and within seconds a high-pitched noise filled the space. Steve covered his ears and squeezed his eyes shut. This was one of those times where he hated his enhanced hearing.
"You've barely touched your soup," Steve pointed out. "And I haven't seen you eat much at all this weekend."
"Oh yeah," Bruce remarked with a sour look on his face. "Something tells me this isn't going to be anything like
"Are you sure you want me to sleep with you?" Steve would have flushed at the phrasing if he hadn't ascertained to himself that they were speaking on purely platonic terms.
" The words were shouted over Fair's and echoed in the silence that followed. Instantly, Pepper and Romanoff's eyes were on him and everyone in Malibu had their eyes glued to the screen in shock. The only expression that differed was Fair's fearful one. Tony loosened his tie a bit and let out a huff of air before continuing. "No. I will not be answering any of your questions, Mr. Fair and that's because I don't want to. They do not deserve a response. Not after you spent this whole meeting undermining me, Miss Potts, and Miss Romanoff."
Steve helped Tony off the plane. For once, Tony helped him out a bit by keeping his eyes open and watching where he was going. As they stepped out onto the stairs, Tony caught sight of Pepper and Happy getting out of the car to meet them. A bit of a Mona Lisa smile formed on Tony's mouth. As glad as he was to see them, Tony couldn't help but worry about how they would react to him knowing his actions over the past few days.
his partners – men and women. In addition to that, he got tested as often as he could, and followed every recommendation expert could give on preventing the transmission of the disease. In short, he was careful and to imply otherwise was simply ludicrous. However, the truth was that no one should expect the media to be anything but ludicrous. So really, it should not have been a surprise.
