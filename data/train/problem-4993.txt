Cas was startled when the door opened, and Castiel screamed, shutting his eyes and turning his head away from the door, only to feel familiar warm hands turn his head.
Castiel asked while waiting for Charlie to show up. Dean looked at Cas and smiled.
"Yeah, that would be shitty, huh?" Dean said, nudging Cas' arm before whistling and taking the lead again. Sam nearly glared at his brother before he dropped back to walk with Cas.
. Tan had had a suspicion they had a closet case on their hands and now it seemed confirmed. Together, they flocked Castiel, hugging him, shaking his hand, and cooing over him. Tan thought to himself that Cas’ wardrobe could use a makeover too, but at least he wore that suit well. The blue tie really brought out his eyes.
"Guys! He's waking up! Turn down the lights. I'm going to go get him." Dean hissed, causing Sam and Charlie to frantically finish up. Dean sighed at them, then went back to his and Cas' room. He walked in and saw Cas lying on his back with his hands folded over his abdomen, looking at the ceiling.
"That 'Great Intelligence' is a dick."
"Cas! You ok?! Cas! I'm coming in!" Dean yelled as he came in. He took in the sight if the angel crouched over the toilet, puking his guts out, hot tears threatening to fall.
"Damn, babies are freaking expensive." Dean mused as he walked outside to put the large bags and boxes in the trunk. Sam laughed.
"Tell us why you are here, demon." Castiel sneered.
Thank you!” Jonathan blew her a kiss and flounced off.
"I love you, Cas. You're going to do great. I know it." Dean said, placing a chaste kiss on Castiel's forehead and getting up. "What do you guys want for dinner? Burgers?"
Castiel flung himself into the shower and turned it on as high and as cold as it would go, sitting in the bathtub and sobbing into his hands, hearing a pounding on the door, which not only frightened him, but made him angry. Why had Noah hurt him like that? He had seemed so nice, so kind, and yet something had happened that had made the human want to harm Cas. He didn't understand it.
The first stop was Babies R Us, so Sam could get a gift for the kids. He managed to find a reasonably priced crib and got two. They also found clothes, bottles, formula, diapers and a few other things that the teenage worker who helped them said were 'must haves'.
"Hey, Charlie...what?...Great, we are almost home...Yeah, will you stay in the garage until we get there?...Because! Its a surprise party! If Cas sees you, everyone know you'll spill the beans...Okay, see you then...Bye" Sam hung up and looked at the clock. "We've been gone for an hour and half. How long do you think it'll take to set up the library for the party?"
"Okay. What's up with you and Cas?" Sam asked, raising an eyebrow. Dean sighed and put his head in his hands.
"Ooh, that's a good song, but not my favorite. It's a tie between Zepplin's "Ramble On" and "Traveling Riverside Blues". Either one would have worked." Dean shrugged.
"Ummm…I guess I will have your cheapest, please." He decided. She nodded in agreement and got the bottle. With a sharp twist, the cap came off and landed in the trash behind the bar. She set it on the counter and smiled at him.
"I just said I was worried, because the last time I was this happy, Naomi took me and tortured me for a little less than a year." Dean spat at Sam.
“It sounds like a story out of a movie.” Tan beat Karamo to the punch, and he smiled at them both. “We’ve heard a few things from Dean, but what about you, Cas? Can we learn more about you?” Tan inquired. Cas frowned, but he looked at Dean, then back at the group.
Dean hummed along to the tune as he made himself some toast and poured a glass of OJ. He sat down with his peanut butter toast and juice and nibbled on it, grabbing his itinerary to read over. He didn't like having plans for events like this, since they always changed in the moment, but they were essential to the way some people worked. People like Cas, he was beginning to realize. Castiel couldn't go a day without knowing exactly what was happening at ever single hour of the day. Dean didn't mind most of the time. Dean looked down at the itinerary and noticed that he would be doing a panel with Castiel tomorrow morning, then a meet and greet on Sunday. That's not too bad, though he did notice that there was no signing.
Castiel covered his mouth as he realized that Dean was dying in the story, and his eyes went wide. "What?! No, no Dean can't just die! It was just a misunderstanding! They belong together!" He cried out. "Who the fuck wrote this shit!" He shouted at the screen, and finally, he found out that it all ended with him saving Dean. "Oh my god, we lived! And we ended up together!" Castiel grinned. "Okay, I got waay more into that than I should have." Castiel admitted, his cheeks turning slightly red.
"Dean!" Castiel gasped as he sat up, straddling Dean's hips. Dean's face melted from confusion into a look of concern as he put his hand on Castiel's stomach. Beneath his hand, something...fluttered, as though there were literal butterflies in Dean's stomach. Both could feel it and they looked at one another in shock.
"Well, Marion, I am looking for the baby shower aisle. My...wife is having a shower for our babies, and well, she is sick right now, so my brother and I are here to shop." Dean said politely. She blushed, at both of them.
Suddenly, Cas' mind was filled with doubt and extreme fear.
"You said so yourself, he's out of town. Nothing to stop you pretty boy." He suggested, trying to wink at him. Castiel looked down the bar for June and waved her down.
TMI. But seriously, this is great! When can I come over?" She bubbled into the phone. Sam arranged for Charlie to visit the next day. Sam told Dean that Charlie was coming and he immediately perked up. The kid was like the little sister he never had. Well, unless you count the occasional appearance of 'Samantha', the chick flick Sam.
by Def Leopard." Castiel said, a questioning sound at the end of the statement.
"Can I have another?" Castiel asked, grabbing the second shot and downing that one too. The burn of the harsh liquor was welcome, as he had been finding out much he really deserved some pain like that. And when it came in something like a liquid that hurt, but not enough to make him stop, he welcomed it.
Dean got up and went to the pantry to get the Oreos. On the way, he heard the buzzer for the door. The cookies in hand, he answered the door to find Charlie. She wore a Lord of the Rings shirt with her bright hair spilling down the front. She lit up when she saw Dean and squealed. She crushed him in a hug, smiling incredibly wide.
Wasn't there supposed to be a specific time when they did a signing in front of the panel hall? Dean looked over the plan again, still not seeing it. Dean texted Cas saying "
"Ding ding ding." Castiel said, though it wasn't as excited as he was a few minutes ago. "Before you try to make this deep and meaningful and...whatever, let's just skip that and go on to yours. I say it's...lizards." Castiel shrugged.
Dean got up from the couch and ran to his and Cas' room. Inside was Cas, looking down at his waist where his pants were. Dean ran up to him and grabbed his hands.
"Yes, I do actually. Two sisters and three brothers. Two brothers are twins. Gabriel and Lucifer, then there is Michael, my oldest brother, and my two little sisters, Anna and Ella. Well, our parents named her Raphael, but it was weird, so she goes by Ella now." Castiel explained, and Dean punched his fist up into the air.
"Call it father's intuition, bitch." Dean replied, smiling widely. Sam returned the grin.
One night, when Dean and Sam were scheduled to come home, Dean called.
"Thanks, Cas. I...uh, sorry?" Sam tried. Dean laughed and clapped his brother on the shoulder.
A picture of the burly man from Dean's last video appeared on the side of the screen with Benny's address and phone number.
Dean laughed weakly, and Cas could feel him nod.
your hair?! And it still looks like
"I didn't tell Dean, so I won't tell you, Sam. I want it to be a surprise. Though, once you are done with painting this room, I want to be in here alone." Castiel requested politely. Sam as Dean exchanged a look, then shrugged simultaneously.
Very much.
At that moment, Dean came bursting through the door with a huge grin on his face.
Cas listened idly to the chatter of the other two men in front of him as they spoke of various monsters a hunt could be if they ended up going to Minnesota for it. As of that moment, they decided it could be a rougarou, a ghoul, or a Leviathan, which made Castiel's nose crinkle.
was rolling its beginning credits and Dean was walking over to the couch with a large bowl of popcorn.
Castiel turned sharply to look at Dean where he sat, ignoring the slight protest from his distended stomach. Sam had already left the room to call Charlie, so it was just the pair of them. Cas' eyes had their angelic fury that scared Dean still.
"Hello boys." It purred.
“Thank you,” Castiel said at last. “That… actually means a lot to hear. Sincerely, thank you.” He smiled warmly, eyes crinkling at the corners, and Tan smiled back.
"So tomorrow is the big day. You excited?" Castiel asked, looking over at Dean. Dean rolled onto his side to face Castiel.
"Dean, you silenced the bond? Why did you do that? Is something wrong, beloved?" Castiel asked. The fake Dean shook his head.
"Remember, I'm doing this for the celebration of three million followers, so if I end up dead from embarrassment, I'll blame number three million. Okay, so from what I've heard, our ship name is..."Destiel". Huh. How come I'm not in it more? He gets a whole four letters and I only get two? Why can't it be like...DeanCas or something? Or...maybe Deanstiel." The man's green eyes crinkled in amusement at his own joke. "Oh god, I'm already too deep into this."
Castiel watched as Dean clicked on the first work in the archive, and he laughed immediately, shutting his bright eyes to just laugh at the fact that not only was the author's name hilarious, but the fact that the first line was him being angry.
"Castiel, this is mostly about you. And I just hope you believe me." Crowley looked Cas in the eye and sighed. "Naomi knows."
Benny. That dickhead. Thinking about him made Dean sick to his stomach. Or was that last night's pizza? He didn't quite know. Dean stretched and noticed his suitcase was still mostly unpacked. Riiight. They were leaving for LA that evening for VidCon, even if it wasn't actually in LA. Dean wasn't a huge fan of California, but it was a good time of year for it. It was warm and there weren't too many people at the moment. Dean did wish that Sam had been able to come down to see him, but he had to work on stuff up in Northern California. Dean didn't mind too much.
"No, he is most likely unconscious. He is not dead, because I would feel his soul. But we need to find him. NOW." Cas said with authority that shook the room. Sam nodded.
On the way back to the bunker, Sam got a call from Charlie.
"So, I think we are up against a woman in white, because a-Cas? Dean? Are you guys okay?" Sam asked, putting down the book and jogging over to the pair.
"How do you feel right now?" Sam asked cautiously.
"Hi guys!" Charlie said. She squeezed Dean in an embrace, then did the same to Sam. Charlie crossed her arms and looked at Dean. "Why didn't you tell me you were having twins? That is something the god-queen needs to know!" She cried. Dean and Sam shushed her.
"Well, then pick a song I know! I wanna win." Dean said, and he looked at Castiel for the next question, which was
"I don't normally ask much of you guys, but could you please make this man's life a living Hell? Please, he deserves every second of it, and I don't care if the cops come after me for sending you out on him, but I don't want Dean to go un-avenged. He deserves happiness, even if it's after all this happened to him." Castiel sighed, and he rubbed his eyes heavily, his anger draining out of him.
But of course, there were problems; they were the Winchesters, there were bound to be problems. Castiel could no longer use many of his angelic powers, so Sam and Dean had to leave him alone in the bunker when they found a relatively close hunt. Cas knew that monsters wouldn't stop attacking just because he was pregnant, but it didn't mean he was happy with the outcome. The bond was kept strong though between Dean and Cas. Sometimes Dean would send a hello from Sam too, mostly to brighten his angel's mood. But however strong the bond was, it could never make up for the lack of touch between them. It left Castiel feeling very lonely, waiting for his hunter to come home.
"Sam, Dean and I just talked...and would you be opposed to a baby shower for me?" Cas asked with intrigued eyes. Sam stopped from laughing from earlier and thought for a second.
But none of them expected what happened next.
They planned on not having a reception, but Cas and Charlie begged otherwise, so they ended up in one of the hotel rooms. The pushed all of the furniture to the side of the room and got some food and Sam's iPod for music. Dean had managed to put some good music on there, besides the crap he listened to. Sam set up the speaker he got from the hotel for Dean and Cas' first dance. They went to the center of the room and got into position. Then, a violin began to play. Dean looked at the stereo with confusion, then he realized what the song was. A smile grew on their faces as they swayed to the music. Dean started to sing softly, even though there weren't any on this version.
"I...I'm sorry. I was just mad because you were hiding something from me. You said you were mad at Sam, but I know you were not. Why did you lie?" Castiel asked, looking up at Dean. Dean furrowed his eyebrows.
They paid the appropriate people and got in line to board the plane. Dean looked at Castiel with a look of desperation. "Please make sure we stay together? I don't think I could do this alone." Dean said in a small voice, and Castiel just smiled.
"Just lay back and enjoy this, Cas. I know you will." A calloused hand touched the inside of Castiel's thigh, then his other thigh, pulling them apart so Cas was spread out beneath the vile man. Something hot and thick pressed against his virginal opening, nothing to ease it's way at all.
"Whatever you need, babe." Dean told him.
Dean thought for a moment before going alone. The door was still closed, so Dean knocked at it gently. Immediately, the door opened and Cas stood there with a wide grin and paint splattered hands and clothes. He closed the door behind him and looked down at his feet.
"That's hard! I don't listen to that much music besides classical!" Castiel whined, but he nonetheless wrote something down.
"Hello Dean." She said. "I am here about Castiel and the...thing he is carrying." Her face twisted into a scowl when she said the word 'thing'. Dean ran over to her and pinned her against the wall.
Wow, Sam, really formal, don't ya think?" Dean laughed a little. "Okay, I don't think this is going anywhere too fast, so lets skip a little, shall we?"
" Dean looked at the camera with disbelief. "Seriously?! What the fuck is this?! Are you trying to make me the bad guy here? Because I so do not appreciate that!" Dean stared rapturously at the screen as he scrolled down even further. "
"Who would you need permission from? Isn't it my soul?" Dean scoffed. Castiel nodded.
It was beginning to get towards the end of June, which meant it drew closer to month ten. Castiel wasn't worried, he knew that the babies would come when they were ready to detach themselves from his Grace. Dean, however, was constantly worried. Whenever Cas winced from a slight pain or kick, Dean was either on his feet immediately or running into the room.
"What the fuck!? How is that even
“So, Dean, you said Cas is your best friend, how did you two meet?” Karamo asked, resting his chin on his hand. Dean glanced at Castiel, then back at the Five.
Dean was lying in a chair, mostly limp, but still screaming. He had a drill through his eye, blood streaming down his face mimicking tears in their patterns. Naomi looked up and scowled.
"Nice Sammy." Dean commented. "You pissed my angel off. He is
. Dean pleaded.
"You want the same thing, or something stronger?" Noah inquired immediately, and Castiel, who had suddenly felt a wave of dizziness hit him, just nodded again. When the dizzy spell cleared, he still noticed how out of focus things were getting, but after some thought, things went back to normal and he didn't feel that anymore.
Castiel stopped and doubled over in pain, clutching his stomach and and gritting his teeth.
"No apology is necessary. But, I have a question." Castiel said, turning to face the brothers at the end of the table.
Cas asked with concern, looking into Dean's green eyes with conviction.
"Tomorrow, I am going to need a few hours with the bond closed so you do not peek at the nursery while I am working on it." Castiel said as he swallowed his last bite of pizza. Dean nodded and stood up to take the paper plates to the trash.
Dean sent a wave of arousal at Castiel who simply glared at Dean with angelic fury.
Sam shrugged and he turned and walked away, and Dean turned back to the screen. "Don't mind him, he's just being a little shit. Alright, where was I?" He scanned the page, then he nodded. "There.
TRIGGER WARNING: Attempted sexual assault in this chapter
It was originally Dean's idea. Of course, Castiel had said nothing against it, since he didn't often say anything about anything any more, but nonetheless, Team Free Will ended up in a bar in the middle of Lebanon, near enough to the bunker that they could walk in case of getting too drunk, which none of them expected.
"Oh, oh my. I am so...so sorry! I...I don't know what just happened Charlie. Please forgive me!" Cas blubbered, tears pricking at his eyes. Charlie furrowed her brow, then began laughing hysterically.
"Don't say its your fault, babe. Its his fault for being a douche and a predator. I'm just happy you and the kids are okay. Speaking of which..." Dean threw aside the comforter and lifted Castiel's shirt to show his stomach to the cool air. "We are very excited for you two. I love you Mary Elizabeth Winchester." He kissed one side of Cas' belly. "I love you Bobby John Winchester." He kissed the other side. He smiled and kissed Cas again on the lips. "I love you Castiel Winchester." Cas smiled contently and let waves of happiness wash through both their minds, tinting the bond a glowing orange. Cas pulled his shirt back down and laid on Dean's broad chest.
"Sam, what happened? What's wrong?" Cas asked frantically. "Did you find out where Dean is?"
"Her name is Bridget. She's my hand maiden in Moondoor. Sorry, Dean. I needed a new one after you left." Charlie explained. Dean mocked a pout and Cas looked at Dean.
"S-So that's h-how you see me?" He gasped out between heaving laughs. "A-As angry?" He finally was able to calm down, and he realized he missed some of the video. "Shit, hang on." He rewinded it, so that he could see it again, and he watched as Dean read the story aloud. "But he has a point, why is Sam in this? He's literally just in this to convince Dean to make a move. If he was really in this, then he would talk to us both. Sam is a good man, and he wouldn't just throw Dean into the fray." Castiel said, his brow furrowing as the video continued. "And he would not be a cockblock. Plus, I don't understand what he is cockblocking. This story doesn't have any sex in it."
"A surprise baby shower? How does that work? But, yeah. I think that'd be good. When did Charlie say that she was coming?" Dean asked.
"Kinda formal, but okay." He repeated the line as Castiel placed his hands on Dean's shoulders, Dean automatically followed suit. Castiel started murmuring words in Enochian as his eyes blazed an electric blue.
"My name is Cas...Cas, just Cas." He decided not to say the rest of his name, because the Winchesters always used different names when they spoke to people.
"What?" He asked plainly.
"I got it. I am going to fly us to a personal Heaven first, then we can travel to the prison from there, once I get my strength back that is." Castiel explained. "Are you ready?" Sam gripped the angel sword tighter in his hand and nodded.
"Aww. Children are wonderful. I have three of my own, all grown now though. I have a few grandchildren as well. I suggest you get this package of cookies. The mothers-to-be almost always get hungry. Also..." She puttered up and down the aisle, pointing out good things to get, and before long both Winchesters had full arms and baskets. After they left with a small wave to Marion, Dean wanted to get Cas a cake.
"Cas, what happened? Are you okay now?" Dean said as he sat beside Castiel, allowing him to snuggle into his side again, much like an oversized cat would.
He walked alone, holding only a bouquet of white lilies and red roses. He wore a white tuxedo with a red dress shirt, and a gold tie matching Dean's. His corsage was a pink rose that stood out against the solid material. Cas's usually messy hair was styled neatly, combed back and lightly gelled. He was the most beautiful thing Dean had ever seen, walking down the aisle, smiling incredibly wide with his gorgeous blue eyes brimming with tears. The wedding march seemed to take far too long, but Castiel eventually made it to the pulpit and gripped Dean's hands tightly after handing off the flowers to Charlie. The pastor looked between them, nodded for everyone to sit then began.
"Are their wings going to actually be this colors?" Dean wondered out loud.
"Yes, but it is cut off. I will see if I can try and break through. Give me a minute." Castiel stood with difficulty and closed his eyes. He journeyed into his own mind, searching for the spot he knew so well. The forest green spot gave off waves of apology, most likely what Dean last sent before he was forced to cut the bond. Castiel went to the spot and put an imaginary hand on it. Through it, all he felt was white. A painfully blank white. He unfurled his wings in their shared mind and flew straight into the spot. It gave little, but Castiel managed to get through to his hunter's broken mind. He now knew why the bond was tainted with white. It was a white hot pain. One that Dean could hardly comprehend himself, and yet it was normal for his brain now. Castiel knew he was not observed as he broke into his mate's mind, so he made himself known as the drill was removed from Dean's eye.
"So, we would get angel married?" Dean asked, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he pulled Castiel towards him, sliding his hands around his waist. "Because that sounds wonderful." Castiel pulled away violently and turned to glare at the hunter with anger in his eyes, which made them shine with blue light.
"Glad you approve." Dean scoffed, and Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, the blue becoming just slits, but he said nothing more. "Okay, so what's the last question?"
Of course the comments on that message were insane, going from crazed Destiel shippers, to theorists, to even haters. Castiel smiled and told himself to thank Dean later, after this whole mess was sorted out. Castiel typed out a general thank you message with a few gifs attached and posted it. He decided to scroll through Tumblr for a bit, at least until he couldn't hear Dean shouting anymore. He also made sure all his identification and tickets were together and put with his wallet so he could grab them all at once before leaving.
"How did you like the pres-woah. Dean?" Sam said, seeing Dean with the bow still placed precariously on his head and over his mouth. Sam spat out the beer he had just taken a sip of and fell to the ground, clutching his sides in laughter. Charlie came out of the kitchen with the cake box at that moment, and she hurried across the room and put it down and joined Sam on the ground, gasping for air. Dean looked annoyed, but didn't remove the bow. It was Cas' day today.
. Dean went over to his chair and kneeled down in front of him. He took the muscle in his hand and began to rub the sore leg. Castiel sighed in relief, filling Dean's mind with gratitude. Dean gently sent a nod back and a genuine smile before helping the angel to his feet.
I was inspired for this chapter by watching AmazingPhil and Tyler Oakley.
"You see, I get to do this because he is my husband." Dean stated, wrapping one arm around Cas' waist, and the other over his abdomen. Dean felt a little confusion coming from Castiel, then a burst of happiness hit him like a big fluffy comet. A curl of golden possession wrapped itself against Dean's mind and glowed with assertion.
“I’ll see what I can do,” the producer sighed, shaking her head. “But for now, just focus on
"Dean! Are you-" Castiel sighed in relief upon seeing him. Dean was tied up in a chair with green eyes wide at him. Dean tried to tell Cas something, but was cut off by a knife jabbing through Castiel's stomach. It hurt, but it was no angel blade, so it would not kill him. The woman that stabbed him watched with glee as he fell to the ground, temporarily weakened by the wound. She flipped her blonde curls back to Dean, who had screamed again after seeing Castiel and their baby get stabbed.
"Yeah, better than White Castle?" He joked as Castiel nodded furiously. After the burger, Castiel was back in the pantry, scouring the shelves for more food. "Don't we have anything more? I have always wanted to try an Oreo. I have heard that they are 'milk's favorite cookie'. Though it confuses me on how an inanimate object can have a favorite anything." Castiel muttered as he sat back down to a laughing Dean.
"No."
"Just come with me to the library. You'll see." Dean pleaded. Cas nodded and swung his legs around to get up. He winced in pain as he felt a tug of protest from his belly. Dean was immediately searching his mate for damage.
"Great. Call her back and tell her the plan, then have her come immediately. You and I will go out and get supplies." Dean decided. Sam nodded in agreement and grabbed his phone.
" He tried to keep it from being confrontational, but he was worried. He didn't like disappointing his fans, and he had promised a signing. Hell, he'd already gotten the ticket revenue from selling some pre-tickets for it. Then why wasn't it there.
"You get to tell her." Dean said to Sam. Sam widened his eyes and shook his head.
"I am not going to tell you how I know, because then you would probably kill me, so I'll just tell you."
"Oh my god. Well...I said I would do this. I'll just do the first...uh, I'll do the first five." The mouse clicked on the first link, and text filled the screen.
"If it would not bother you too much." Cas responded. Dean laughed.
"I need all of my Grace, and there is a small portion in you. So, if I am to figure out if something is inhabiting my body, I will need your portion of Grace as well." Castiel explained. Dean inhaled sharply and subconsciously put a hand over the scar on his arm from Castiel when he raised him from Hell. Castiel laughed, the sound almost desperate for something to break the tension.
"Um, actually...both. We're having twins." Dean said, picking up a few rolls of powder blue and pale pink streamers and putting them in the basket.
" Dean yelled, worry and disbelief tainting his mind. He stopped immediately after he felt a surge of fear coming through the bond.
Castiel looked down at his hands, and he squeezed them into fists, then he raised his head back to face the camera, the anger back in his eyes.
"Well, technically they are for Mary Jo and Bobby, but we are giving them to you." Sam elaborated for Cas. Cas moved his lips in a small 'o' and followed the other three people into the garage. Once inside, there was a large pile of neatly wrapped presents. The biggest ones, like the cribs were in the back, and the small bundles of clothes and toys lined the front. Charlie covered Cas' eyes again and giggled.
"Thanks Sammy. Thanks both of you for coming to get me and killing Naomi." Dean said, much to the confusion of Sam, and Cas.
"Cas! You...you just had your first mood swing!" At hearing this, Dean began laughing as well, despite the confusion bubbling in his mind about the term 'mood swing'.
. Dean thought, winking at the angel that was already up. Castiel rolled his eyes as Dean laughed again.
"So, what am I going to do, Mr. I-Can-Fix-Everything?" Dean asked with false sweetness. Sam thought for a second, then Cas came into the room.
"Dean!"
"No, actually it's flying."
"What can I get you boys?" She asked sweetly. Her name tag read
"Yes, he is doing his job. Its a family business, so he is with his brother." Cas explained. June nodded and looked down at some of the other customers.
"Yeah, I think so too." Castiel nodded.
"I am still a celestial being Sam, though my stomach has become the size of a celestial body. I can hear you." Castiel yelled from the kitchen. Dean laughed, both at the annoyance tinting his mind and at the flustered face of Sam.
Sam got dressed in his black suit with a lighter green shirt than Dean, and a deep burgundy tie, then he ushered Dean hastily to the pulpit where the pastor stood, beaming at him. In the seats was Kevin besides his mom and Garth sitting next to Jody on the other side. Charlie and Cas were no where to be seen, which worried him a little bit, but he knew that they were waiting behind the door. Even though the bond was cut off, Dean could still feel the excitement buzzing through. It made him smile that Castel was just as excited as him. Sam ran quickly around the benches of the church to into the foyer of the chapel with Charlie and Cas, leaving Dean alone at the alter. A bead of sweat dripped down Dean's face as he pulled at his collar. Then, the doors at the back opened and Charlie and Sam came walking through, arm in arm.
Cas smiled even wider and finished unwrapping Dean, leaving the bow on his head and over his mouth. Dean got up and helped Cas up as well, and they walked back inside. Dean kept his arms at his side and a straight face.
"Hello, Charlie. It is very nice to see you. Especially in this circumstance. I have not seen you since the wedding. You look well." Castiel commented. Charlie nodded and gave him a big hug.
"I did once. Amelia dragged me to one when I was with her. It was really boring, but I learned a bit." Sam said, getting the bags. Charlie came from around the corner and saw them. She broke into a grin and went to help them.
A lot of you guys might not know...but we went to therapy together for awhile. When I was in Kansas for a few weeks, he invited me to join him, and it was useful, but I had to go back to Illinois."
"Fine, lets go."
"Whatever your 'gift' is, we don't want it. I guess you'll have to return it." Dean snapped in Crowley's direction. The demon shook his head and looked at Cas' abdomen.
"That does not mean that you cannot be happy, Dean." Castiel hissed, leaving the room in huff. Dean closed the bond because he knew this most likely a temporary mood thing. He definitely did not want to hear the insults in Enochian that Cas was probably coming up with. Dean picked up the cereal bowl Cas left behind and took it to the kitchen. Dean knew that no love was lost between them, it would be impossible to get Dean to stop loving Castiel, and Dean knew that Castiel was going to feel the same way, even after Dean's body died.
can hide. So why on Earth would I keep a secret from you like that?" Dean said, taking Cas' head in his hands. He put his forehead to Cas' and smiled. "I love you." And just like that, the bond burst open with forgiveness and love streaming into Dean's mind. He sighed in relief, his mind feeling so pleasurably full compared to the emptiness it was in the hour before.
"I think I might be able to figure out what it is. I am going to need your help though." He stated as he got off of the bed.
He checked his tag on Tumblr and tons of people were congratulating him on his achievement, how he was that much closer to a Diamond Play Button, but he noticed that one person had sent him something first. Dean. A little notice from Impala67 was at the very bottom of his screen, and it was a message.
"Of course not. We can invite Charlie! I'm sure she'll be happy. And also...we haven't told her about the twins. We are never going to hear the end of it." Sam admitted with a groan. Dean and Cas exchanged a look and a few thoughts.
"You got me gifts?"
I know that this one and the last chapter haven't been as long, but the next one will be a Vlog, so it will be longer.
“Hey everyone out there! I’m Impala67, or Dean as many of you guys know, and if you don’t know, then what are you doing here? Nah, I’m kidding. Welcome! This week, I’m going to be doing something a little different than normal. I have gotten a lot of requests about me and IntriguedAssbutt, or as you know him, Castiel. Now, I'm kinda weary about reaching this far into the dark spaces of the Internet, but I have solemnly sworn to you that I would do whatever I needed to do for y'all." The screen split into pieces, so the main view was still of the man's face, but there was a small window in the corner that showed that he was on a website called "Fanfiction.net". "Many of the people that suggested this said I should try a different website than this one, but when I looked things up, this is what came up, so I'll just use this one."
"Dean, Dean listen to me you need to get grounded." Castiel insisted. "You're in a bathroom right now, you're safe, and you're not going to be hurt." Castiel said firmly. "I want you to breath with me, five seconds in, hold for eight, five seconds out." Castiel inhaled deeply, insisting that Dean do it with him. Dean was still breathing rapidly, but he tried to match his short, choppy breaths with Castiel's deeper ones. After a minute or so, Dean's breathing had slowed down and his heart had ceased racing. Dean looked up into Castiel's cerulean eyes and gave a short nod to show that he was okay now. He stood from the toilet and noticed that Castiel had broken the door down to get in to him.
help make this a double episode. You’ll be helping us help other people! It’s good honest work.”
"D-Dean?" Castiel's voice was cracked, hollow, but hopeful as he looked at the green eyed hunter.
"The neph-the baby will gestate for approximately nine to ten months, a little bit over human gestation time. When it is time, the child will detach itself from my Grace and become a sentient being. Unfortunately, it will be very painful for me. The angel equivalent of labor pains." Castiel explained. "In that time, I will still be able to use a majority of my 'mojo' such as flying and smiting, so we may resume hunting. But I believe it would be best to stop those activities after the sixth month."
"Crowley."
"Do not fear Sam, I am still an angel. I can heal your injuries easily. Though, it would be easier on everybody if you tried a bit harder to
There is no excuse on why I didn't get this up sooner. I'm so sorry. But its here now and that's what matters.
Cas landed with a thud, groaning in pain has he felt his belly skin growing back over the babies. Dean landed on top of him, and Sam was on the ground somewhere close. But all Castiel could comprehend was the wonderful presence of Dean above him once more...even if he weighed more than he remembered. Dean groaned loudly and rolled off of Castiel. Cas sat up with difficulty and looked at Dean. He pressed frantic kisses all over Dean's face, trying to get him to respond.
"I dunno what it is, but i just have this feeling that it is going to be a girl. Cas, what do you think?"
"Aww, does the widdle Deanie feel sad? Did I hurt your widdle boyfriend?" She cooed in a mocking voice.
"As you both know, I am going to go into labor any day now. On that day, I am going to be in agony, most likely. Whatever I will say, I will not mean. Also, the pain will last anywhere from four to thirteen hours. The babies will detach themselves from my Grace and appear in Dean's arms since he is the father. Sam, you will need to be in the room to take the first baby quickly so Dean can catch the second." Castiel explained gently. Sam nodded and looked at Dean.
"Damn straight."
Dean sang to Cas. He heard the sharp inhale of breath as he received it, which caused Dean to smirk.
"Cas...they're incredible. Are their wings going to look like that?" Dean managed to choke out in amazement. Castiel nodded and hugged Dean from behind, his abdomen pressing against Dean's back.
"I can do that, but what about you bond? Are you going to cut it off after you go into labor?" Sam questioned.
"Why can't you just take what you get and hope it doesn't go away instead of expecting it to? You can't live your life like that!" Sam exclaimed, for pulling Dean to face him. "Just, accept that you are happy with your life, and that the world isn't out to get you for once!"
"Cas, listen. Last time I felt this happy, Naomi took me. Kinda put a damper at that. I just feel like I can't get too happy, or something will happen to us. I can't let that happen. You're only a few months from your due date!" Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. Castiel stood and glared at him.
"Cas. I never really knew it, but you and I were always meant to meet. You pulled me out of a rough spot," Everyone but the pastor chuckled at that. "And I will always be grateful for it. You have saved me and even Sam so many times since then, that I have stopped trying to keep count. You are mine and I am yours, pretty much always. I love you. More than pie, more than a good burger, more than nearly anything, even the Impala. You are and will always be my angel." Dean finished, looking up into Cas' eyes. Tears streamed down his face, coating his smile in salt water. Dean reached between them and took his hand. He slid the ring on Cas' long finger, looking absolutely perfect. The pastor nodded lightly at Dean, then turned to Castiel.
"Wow, I am surprised. It's not right, but it is a second favorite. My favorite is "Believe It Or Not". You know, the theme to Great American Hero?" Castiel grinned, and Dean groaned, rolling his eyes so far, all you could see were the whites of his eyes.
"Is that...two heartbeats? Which means...you guys are having twins?!" He shouted, standing up suddenly. He grinned and crushed Dean in a Sasquatch hug.
"Oh Dean. Please don't try and lie to me. You are absolutely terrible at trying to tell me off. When the angel has better insults, its time to give up, darling." Castiel stepped forward, his mind blazing in protection for his mate.
"We love you all, and we'll talk to you soon." The two waved, and the screen went black for a moment, then something flashed on screen. A note on a black screen in white writing.
"June, thank you very much for speaking to me, but I believe it is time for me to leave." Cas said as he put down a few dollars for the beer. She looked at the man who was swaying on his feet and scowled.
"I-I've been trying to call him for the past few days now, but he hasn't been answering the phone. God, guys I am so worried about him. He's...Dean will worry about someone's wants before he thinks of his own
"I feel so hurt. That you two would go and get Cassie here knocked up and not tell me! Dean, I thought we had a better relationship than that." He said, putting on a mask of feinted horror. Dean paled when he heard what he had said.
"Hell yeah you aren't most angels. You just so happen to be mine." He grinned, stretching his freckles widely, leaning forward to press a kiss to Castiel's forehead. Castiel sighed in contentment and closed his eyes and somehow, fell asleep in the embrace of his hunter.
The search bar fills in with the typed words "Destiel fanfiction", and then the mouse clicked on the search button, and immediately, about 2500 results pop up on the screen, the first being titled "I Don't Like Jokes", with the name "DeansbbCas" as the author. The tanned face in the bigger window nearly cringed.
I know this is short, and I know it's been awhile, but I hope that even this short chapter will tide you over. I plan on doing a bigger chapter for the VidCon! It will be big, I promise.
"I am sure he would love that, thank you." She found a pen and wrote down a number on the back of his hand with her name signed
"Yeah, let's just go to bed." He took off his flannel so he was just in a soft t-shirt, and he went into the bathroom to change into his pajama pants while Castiel did the same.
"Hey everyone. I..I have to tell you all something. I know that I haven't posted a video in a few weeks since my collab with IntriguedAssbutt, and here's my reason why; my year long relationship...it just ended." Dean choked out, the screen stuttering for a moment before it came back onto Dean's face, which was slightly less red, but there were fresh tears on his cheeks that had been hidden by the editing. "Many of you may know that I was with a girl named Lisa for the past few months, and even more of you are probably wondering what I mean by a year long relationship when I only met Lisa last spring."
"Dean, why do we need to go to Walmart?" Sam asked, coming out from the kitchen.
"Can I come in and see what Cas was doing now?" Sam asked from behind the door. Dean peeled himself away from the angel to open the door. Sam walked in and took in the wings on the walls. "Holy...Cas. Those are amazing. Where did you get the design pattern?" Sam wondered out loud.
Dean was not prepared for the shower. He had been to one in Cicero with Lisa, but even then it was completely boring and he didn't pay any attention to how or why everything happened.
"Woh, Sammy. Calm down. I...I was just kinda excited. Just, come here." Dean gestured to Cas' stomach. Sam furrowed his brow and came over. He knelt down and put a hand on his abdomen. Then he widened his eyes and put both hands on the bump.
Dean shook away his thoughts and put in his earbuds while he started packing the last of his things: laptop, chargers, phone. The essentials. Dean would save the toiletries for later, so he decided to go grab something to eat. He shuffled out of his room, still bobbing his head to the beat of the newest Taylor Swift song. He would never admit that he listened to her music, but with earbuds in, he could get away with it. Dean looked around and noticed that Castiel had gone on his morning jog, so he unplugged his ear buds and played the song from his speakers on the phone.
"I told you you would do something you would regret. Please, leave before I ha-" Cas was cut off by the crash of the drunk's lips to his. He smelled of whiskey and tried to pry Cas' mouth open with his tongue. Castiel pushed him away hastily and wiped his mouth. He then reared back and punched the man. He staggered back and held his face. He looked up and spat some blood from his mouth to the side. Then, he strode unbelievably fast to Castiel and pinned his hands against the wall of the alley.
"No, don't worry. I just wanted my head to myself for a little bit, baby. Okay?" He asked, smiling lightly. Cas narrowed his eyes but nodded curtly. The fake Dean sighed in relief, but then had to face a questioning Sam. "What? I need my own time, don't I? Stop being a bitch."
"Yeah, you wanted to take my husband and babies, and now you 'need me'? Sounds convincing." Dean said, turning away and trying to walk away. Naomi appeared in front of him, blocking his way.
"Dude, that would be perfect! Throw a surprise party for him!" Sam said once he was sure Castiel was out of earshot. He still whispered though, not wanting him to eavesdrop.
"Don't worry, babe. I will love you even if you get to be the size of a small moon." Dean said as he raised Cas' hand and kissed each of the knuckles gently. A wave of relief flooded his senses, and it almost made Dean want to exhale in relief with him.
And it scared Castiel.
"She?" Sam asked skeptically.
Castiel sent him a mental picture to remind him.
"Dean, technically have no gender. I only reside in this Vessel as a male, and now that Jimmy Novak has passed on to Heaven, the body is mine." Castiel explained. "Which means, as an angel, I can bear children, though I never thought it possible."
It started one day when the trio were in the Men of Letters bunker watching television. Castiel had become very attached to many of the shows, such as Sherlock, or other cop shows. He was lying against Dean on the couch, while Sam was in the library trying to figure out something about their latest hunt. Castiel suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, one that prodded him to fly to the restroom immediately in order to throw up the contents of his stomach, which was mostly bile. From outside, Castiel heard Dean pounding on the door, asking what was wrong.
Dean received an agreement as he led Charlie to Castiel. As soon as they entered the room, Charlie bombarded Cas with a hug/tackle. She babbled endlessly about boys vs. girls and how the baby will be lucky to have an aunt as cool as her. Dean handed the package of Oreos to Cas and slid an arm around his waist. Castiel absentmindedly ate the cookies and answered the questions posed to him. But as he finished the package, he looked down at it with confusion.
"Is this okay?" Cas asked, sighing. Dean smiled and tried to break the tension. He walked over to him and slid his arms around his waist.
Small hints of jealousy washed against Cas' mind and he chuckled.
"Wait, have I fallen asleep?" Castiel asked as he shot straight up. Dean looked at him and nodded.
"I was trying not to pass out from the pain Dean. I think that its fine that I didn't get the joke." Sam muttered as he stood up. Just then, he noticed the blood that had seeped through Castiel's shirt, much like Dean had. His face twisted into one of worry as he began to freak out. "Cas! The baby?"
"No. I don't believe it will hurt me too much. No more than an average pregnancy." Castiel answered Sam, it was quite inconvenient that Sam couldn't listen in on their conversations and just know. But then again, Dean had a feeling that he definitely did not want him listening in on some of the things he was going to be saying through the bond. The thought made him grin.
"Yes, Bobby's actually closely resemble mine. Only mine are a bit more...garish. You saw them, the day we were bonded, remember?" Cas said, reminiscent of the day this all started. Dean thought about it. He had seen them, and Cas was right. Castiel's wings were almost glittering in their evanescent shades of violet, green, and blue that weave ever so delicately into the deep black of the downy underside of his wings. Bobby's WERE similar, except for the were simple and much less flamboyant. Dean grinned and turned to look are Castiel.
"No Dean, you really aren't." Sam shot back. Castiel sat with confusion leaking through the bond.
At that moment, Sam came running in with a knife drawn searching for a threat.
Except when something impossible happened, as it usually does for the Winchesters.
"Its there, just a bit dormant. See if you can find it." Dean nodded and closed his eyes. He searched through his brain and found a little golden spot that pulsed with power and just something that screamed
"Well now this just won't do, will it? Three men, one of whom is practically dripping power, a devilishly handsome one, and a gentle giant. Where the hell did you scrounge up this group, Dean?" The witch sneered. Dean pulled at the ropes desperately.
Notes at end of chapter
"Sam, he is in Heaven's prison. Everyday for the past ten months, he has been tortured by Naomi for information. He never gave any, but that does not matter. She drilled into his mind and retrieved every detail of our lives. The only thing that remains a mystery to her is how the bond between Dean and I works. But she is close, and if she breaks into it, then she might be able to sever it, which could kill us both." Castiel explained. Sam sucked in a shocked breath.
“Magic spells apparently, Rapunzel! I’m so envious. You have no idea what I go through to maintain this mane.” Jonathan flipped his hair for emphasis. Karamo, though entertained, knew they had a job to do, and he wanted to get to the bottom of Dean’s desire for Cas.
"Dean, we can't paint the entire room black. They're babies. Make it blue or pink!" Sam argued one day in Home Depot, near the paint section. Dean crossed his arms and glared at Sam.
Castiel commented with a stream of pride licking at Dean's mind.
"Yeah, it's exciting, all of this." Castiel was silent for a little bit, then he sighed. "I know this will inspire so many fanfictions, and maybe some day we'll post a reaction video to them together, but not until later on." Castiel assured them.
The mouse moved to click the link that went to the search bar.
"Okay, I won't call, HER, a nephilim. But either way, we need to do some research about this. I just hope that there is some sort of precedent so we can figure out how long this will last and what we can expect." Sam explained. As he finished, Cas winced and held his abdomen again. Dean sent a stream of worry to Castiel and received a faint 'okay' feeling.
"Obviously, you normally miss everything. It worked. And now, Cas, lets find out what you have inside you." Dean said, getting serious once again. Castiel nodded and closed his eyes for about a minute. Then, he furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head. Suddenly, his eyes flew open.
"Easy. You have one sibling. A brother." Dean frowned.
"H-Hep..." Castiel whispered, praying to his absent Father that whoever was there would hear his plea.
"Sure, Cas. Sorry."
Cas walked in the bar and went straight for the counter. A blonde woman was tending the counter, she looked at Castiel with a soft brown gaze.
"I swear. One day you are going to be just staring at each other, then one of you is going to end up bent over the table. And I will ask Cas to blind me." Sam muttered to himself as he walked out of the room. Dean just kept a goofy grin on his face.
Dean made a face and was soon bombarded by an audio tech who hooked him up to a body mic, clipping the microphone to his collar and fastening the battery pack to his waistband. This was the weirdest thing he’d ever been a part of. Sam seemed much more at ease with it and he sat in one of the chairs he was directed to sit in. They helped him change his position for the best backdrop and lighting, but more lighting was added and a camera was set up on a tripod. He was instructed to explain why he nominated Dean for the Queer Eye makeover.
"That's okay. I told you I would love you even if you were the size of a small moon, didn't I?" Dean questioned. Cas nodded and glared at him.
"I will, otherwise Dean will feel all the pain, and I can't have that." Cas assured him. Dean grasped Castiel's hands and looked at him with a small smile.
Lunch was peaceful, full of chatter and laughter as the eight men got to know each other. Everything was going off without a hitch until a dramatic gasp came from Jonathan. “You
It took nearly two weeks of non-stop watching, but they finished the series and the three men sat back in their seats with gaping mouths.
"Thanks for that."
"Cas? What is this?" Dean asked, looking at the food.
"Yeah. I'm a little nervous, but I'm more excited." He assured him. He then yawned and laid back in the bed again. "I'm gonna try to get to sleep. Got a big day." He smiled, rolling over so his back was to Castiel. "Night."
You already know Team FreeWill, but the Fab Five don't. And vice versa. Let them get to know each other.
"And after, I am enlightening you in the way of British television."
"Dean! What happened?! Is everyone okay?" Sam asked, bursting into the room with a panicked look. Dean stood up and put his hands up.
"You keep praying for Castiel, and yet you know he will not come. Why do you do this?" Naomi asked one day before the daily torture. Dean laughed weakly.
Dean had donned Cas in some of his clothes, old and worn, but still comfortable enough, as well as attractive. They made Cas feel a little bit better, but nothing had healed his broken heart since the angels fell. Smiles from Dean, a new book, Sam's uncontrolled laughter, killing Metatron...nothing made Castiel feel like the angel he used to be. Dean constantly told him that he used to be a dick, and that him as a human was far better, but shockingly, that did nothing for his near non-existent self esteem.
Dean sent a mental image of the color and felt a nodding approval from Cas.
"Are we going or not?" He asked, sending a hint of annoyance to Dean. They shrugged and followed him out. Dean got into the driver's seat next to Sam in the passenger seat. For some reason, swells of red anger kept washing against the bond, making Dean absolutely confused.
"He's just trying to avoid the issue at hand, you know how he is." Sam sighed, looking at the silhouette of his brother ahead of them. "You should talk to him tomorrow. You need to get this off your chest." Castiel looked briefly at his chest to make sure there was nothing there, then he realized that it was a euphemism, and he nearly smiled at the fact that he actually got something.
Castiel emptied his bladder, then returned to his barstool, where his drink was waiting for him still. He took a long swing from it, and he immediately felt happier than he did before, which Noah must have seen, because he put his large hand on Castiel's knee.
"Okay…what brand do you want?" Cas was taken a bit aback. There was different types of beer? He had just assumed they were all the same.
"RIGHT?" Charlie said, laughing at the expressions. Dean shook away his amazement.
"No, I believe the Chef Digiorno made the frozen part. I simply heated it per his instruction." Castiel explained. Dean laughed and placed a kiss on the crown of Cas' head before sitting down and eating. The trio ate in comfortable silence, Dean and Cas didn't even talk to each other through the bond, they were too tired and content with the quietness to let it leave.
"As many of you know who follow Impala67, Dean...he's in a bad place right now, and how the fuck could you do that to someone as nice as him? I've known him for awhile now, and I've never once thought of any reason to hurt him, physically or emotionally. Benny Lafyette, whoever the fuck you are, you are directly out of the seventh circle of Hell, you know that?" Castiel snarled at the screen. "Dean deserves better than you could ever give him, and you hurt him because you didn't have the balls to be serious."
Dean searched the screen for some sort of sign that he would survive the story, and he sighed in relief as he found out that it was Castiel who saves him in the end, and they find out that everything was a huge misunderstanding.
"It seems that something I thought utterly impossible has just come true. Dean," Castiel said, looking into the hunter's eyes with a sad look. "I am carrying a nephilim." Sam nearly fell over and Dean just stared at his new mate.
"Well I'm surprised she doesn't scream in terror instead."
"Yes, but the ceremony is much like human marriage in that it needs a witness and I need a blessing from usually the father, but in this case, your brother will do." Castiel explained, weary of what Dean was going to say. Dean began to laugh.
"That is good. I think." Dean said, stretching out his hand and placing it on Castiel's stomach. Beneath the fabric of the shirt, Dean could feel the loss of some of the muscle and an addition of a hard spot at his navel. Dean looked around and made sure that Sam was elsewhere, then he lifted Cas' shirt and placed peppered kisses along his belly. Pink, bubbly happiness and lime green relaxation dripped into Dean's mind, stemming from Cas.
"Sam, will you give us your blessing?" Castiel asked as he took Dean's hand.
"Yes, Naomi." The fake Dean said before watching her vanish along with the mess it had made with the skin. He then walked down the hallway and met up with Sam. After talking with Sam for awhile, Castiel found them in the library with a worried expression.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak in holy matrimony." Dean chuckled in his head at the name. Cas had insisted on using it to honor Jimmy, who was now in Heaven according to Cas. It wasn't like he was going to have it for very long, but the marriage license needed a last name. "Dean Winchester, do you take Castiel Novak, as your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?"
A normal black screen turned into flashing white words, reading in large, bold font "RANT INCOMING", and after they flashed for a few seconds, the screen faded until Castiel's face was clear. He was clearly angry, his eyes a storm of blue and gray, making him look incredibly dark, despite the brightly lit room.
"Sam and I have an extra present for you. Just keep your eyes closed for a second." Charlie told him. Dean looked at them with confusion, and then Sam held up some wrapping paper and a big, red bow from the bag he got from the market and grinned evilly. Before Dean could run, Sam tackled him to the ground and began wrapping Dean in the paper. After a few minutes, Sam managed to immobilize him and sat him on the ground behind the biggest present, so he couldn't be seen. The bow was placed on his head and it also covered his mouth so he couldn't talk. He could hear what was going on though.
"Of course you do, sweetheart. I'll make sure you feel so much better by tomorrow mornin'." Noah drawled, and he pulled Castiel from his seat, letting Cas lean against his side as the alcohol and...whatever else was making Cas feel so out of it, took hold of his capability for motion. Castiel stumbled over his own feet as Noah led him through the crowd, his hand firmly on Castiel's backside the entire time. Castiel couldn't help but want to speak out about it, but his tongue weighed more than a million pounds at the moment, and speech was simply not possible.
"I dunno. But I just know that its been a lot." Dean said. Sam nodded and wrinkled his forehead.
"Is it a good thing or a bad thing? That he's been sleeping I mean. I know that he is kinda human cause of the babies, but is he suppose to sleep and eat so much?" Sam inquired, honestly curious and concerned.
"No. That means that there is something wrong and I need the sleep to fix it." Castiel replied, much to the shock of Dean.
"Damn. Now I can't ditch you. Oh well." He shrugged and shoved Castiel lightly. Cas laughed and pushed Dean back, forgetting momentarily that he was, in fact an angel with far more strength, and making Dean fall over. The playful mood vanished as Castiel rushed over to help him up.
The Fab Five discover that "Cas" isn't a woman's name after all.
At the door, stood Crowley. He had a smirk on his face, as usual, but his eyes were a bit softer than their common cold glint. Sam tensed up and felt for his knife in his back pocket.
Castiel nodded and wiped away tears hastily, trying to erase their existence in the first place. Dean got up quickly and pressed a kiss to Cas' forehead, sending a reassuring streak through the bond before leaving to go to meet up with Sam in the library. But he was stopped by the woman who he had seen almost a month before. Immediately, the memories flew back and he growled at her, his instincts to protect his children and mate kicking in.
"Yeah, but you're my macho older brother who hates all things chick flicky. Apparently, your husband can bring out things I've never seen in you." Sam suggested. Dean nodded and walked over to where Cas was sitting and Dean planted a kiss on the top of his head.
"Uh...no, I have two brothers. Sam and Adam."
“Oh, definitely a closet case,” Tan confirmed. “I had a hunch and of course I was right. Takes one to know one. Luckily, I have experience in this department so I have total faith that I can push through one little soft spot in one of Dean’s barriers of machodom and hypermasculinity and reach out to him and pull him through. If he takes this step, I think it’ll be majorly beneficial to him in the long run, and not just because he may get to be with the love of his life.”
"Made some breakfast before I left." He shrugged, then pulled out his phone to read the text. "Wait what? They cut our signing?" Castiel grabbed the itinerary and read it over. "They cut... your signing. Mine is still there." Castiel noticed with a deep frown. "That's not right. We were supposed to have all our events together, and they can't just take that away from you!"
"I...I don't know what you are talking about. Cas is a guy, he can't get pregnant!" Dean shouted, noticing that no one was around to hear him. Crowley chuckled and shook his head.
"Yeah, no kidding." Charlie agreed. Sam sighed and got up from the couch where they had basically lived on for the past ten days.
"Do...do you mean like, sex? Because we have already done that. What do you mean by 'mate', Cas?" Dean asked as he got up from the bed. Castiel looked at the ground, as though ashamed to speak further.
"Oh Cas...I had no idea." Dean whispered, his eyes wide at Cas' story. He had just seen the aftermath of the evening, but he knew nothing of beforehand. Gentle hands came to cup Cas' face, then wiped away his tears. Cas leaned forward and pressed his ear to Dean's chest, listening to the uneven heart beat of the man.
"I'm fine Dean. I just got up too fast. Now, what was it you wanted to show me?" Cas asked. Dean led him out and covered his eyes. Cas struggled to get him off. "Dean! Stop it! You don't have to do that! I'll just close my eyes if you don;t want me to see it!"
"Nice. Well then, lets get hitched!"
"Oh calm down moose. I just wanted to stop by and offer my congratulations." He offered, not stepping in because of the line of salt at the door. He looked down at it and raised an eyebrow. "Honestly, you two are so paranoid."
Upon Castiel's reorientation into the world of the living, which was so cruelly called 'waking up', he noticed a searing pain in his mind, his ass, and in his heart. Cas' eyes flung open when he realized that he could be in the clutches of Noah still, since he could feel a warmth beside him, and he looked around, the darkness in the room not telling him anything. He stumbled to one of the two doors that were in the room, crying out when the pain in his thighs suddenly became present as well. He opened one of the doors, and he found a bathroom, which he staggered into. He shut and locked the door behind him, since he knew he had startled whoever was in bed with him.
"Cas, it's fine." Dean insisted, "I-"
Castiel snorted. "Yeah, you reached real deep for that one, huh? And it's not like he went to some obscure website that no one has ever heard of. It's literally 'fanfiction.net, the most basic thing you could make for a fanfiction website." Castiel criticized. He leaned closer to the screen when he saw the typed words. "Destiel? Huh, that sounds nice. I like it better than what he's suggesting. Deanstiel? Really? It doesn't flow. Destiel sounds like a real name." Castiel noted.
"She said she was going to need all of three hours to get here, so pretty much anytime would be good."
Dean loved using his full name between them, it made their life feel far more real and it cemented Dean's claim on Cas. Castiel looked up with wide innocent eyes. Then he smiled, more devilishly than Dean thought the angel could manage.
"Hey, Cas? Why do you call Dean 'beloved'? Is there any rhyme or reason to it?" Sam questioned, honestly curious about the answer. Cas' cheeks tinted a light red and he looked at Dean.
"You are going to be the best gift I have ever received."
Then the drill attacked Dean's mind again, throwing Castiel backwards and out of Dean's thoughts once more. Though he felt utterly broken, Dean had still called him 'babe' and been able to say 'I love you'. Something the shifter never did, and it made Cas swell with longing and love. Sam ran over to the angel, who had been thrown to the ground by the sheer force of the pain in his mind. Castiel got help from Sam to stand.
"No it isn't! I love it! I sing it to my niece to get her to go to sleep!"
"Oh, Dean. When will you ever learn? Everyone you ever cared about has died. Why should these boys be any different? And before you freak out, of course I know about your life. First there was Mommy and Daddy, then your little friends Jo and Ellen, and last but not least is your weirdo friend, Bobby." She purred in a sinister voice. Dean felt his heart breaking at the mention of his family. She saw this and grinned evilly before continuing. "I was in your head, and man, it was truly messed up. There was a name though, Cas. Must be the guy I just killed. Poor widdle Deanie. So afraid and all al-"
"I didn't know that at all. I just thought that since you talk about Sam all the time in your videos, you only had him." Castiel said, still confused.
"Cas is asleep. I can feel it." Dean said a bit louder.
“You flirt. You just winked at a million people. Dean’s a whore.” Castiel whispered, hiding his mouth from Dean, but he knew that the other man heard him. Dean grinned at him, and then he looked back at the camera.
"Don't worry, Sammy. The baby is fine. Its half angel, remember? And besides, Cas said she doesn't have a solid form yet." Dean clarified. Sam sighed in relief, then looked back at Dean.
“Let’s just get it over with,” Dean grumped a little with a heavy sigh.
"What do you know about nephilims?" Sam asked. Dean glared at Sam with a cold look.
Sam looked at him. "I didn't ask." Dean laughed and before he could tell off his brother, he heard Castiel again.
good. It makes me...very happy." He said in between bites. Dean chuckled.
On cue, Dean’s face popped up from the side of the screen, and he waved at the camera. “Hi everyone! I know, I know, dream come true, right? I have fulfilled your dreams and fanstasies just by being here, huh?” Dean said cheekily, winking at the screen.
"I may be with child, Crowley, but that does not mean that I will not smite you here and now." He fumed, exuding Heavenly power as his eyes glowed white. Crowley raised his hands in defense.
"Get out of here." Sam growled gripping the door in preparation to close it. Crowley sighed and shook his head.
It was month two of Castiel's pregnancy, and all was well. The trio continued to hunt on occasion, mostly easy things like routine salt and burns, or small vampire nests. They stayed in the bunker most of the time, not that it was a problem. It had enough old films to entertain someone for a year. Dean and Cas watched old classics so that Castiel could finally get many of the so called 'popular culture' references, even though a majority of the movies came out before 1950. All was normal in the Winchester family. Until Dean and Castiel accidentally brought on the wrath of a red haired she-devil...
"Wait! You...you know the sex of the baby?" Castiel asked, and Crowley nodded.
. She grinned and wiggled the box.
"You are welcome. Now, let us find Dean." Cas said. He touched his fingers to Sam's forehead and flew to the prison. They landed in front of a large stone building. It was somewhat menacing, as though it knew its own purpose and showed it. Cas looked around and then gestured for Sam to follow him inside. Cas opened the doors and gripped his angel blade tighter. Sam shifted the hand of his sword and gulped nervously. A scream echoed along the wall, but it was too feminine, most likely another angel. Then, a bloodcurdling scream of both pain and sorrow pierced the near silence. Castiel immediately recognized it, as did Sam. They nodded at each other then began running down the hall. An angel appeared in front of them with an angel sword.
Tan France takes Dean Winchester shopping... and a bit of truth comes out.
“You flirt.” He accused teasingly right back.
"No problem, honey. Just remember, you are welcome back here. Actually, take my number. I would love to meet up with you sometimes. Maybe our significant others can meet, too." June proposed, and Castiel smiled at her.
"Because, Castiel." Cas flinched at the harsh tone Dean was using. "When I had sex with you, I never thought that you were going to get fat like this! Or that you were going to turn into such a whiny bitch! I would have thought twice before asking you to marry me." Dean said harshly. Castiel melted to the floor, unable to move. Dean took it as an advantage. "Honestly, baby." Dean hissed the word. "Did you ever think I was actually okay with having a baby? Let alone two. I should have left while I had a chance." Dean yelled. Castiel covered his ears and curled into a ball, not wanting to hear anything. He pried at the bond, begging him to open it. Then, Castiel got a glimpse of Dean's mind after prodding and pulling all he could while he stood in front of him, crying out insults and slander. Dean was not in this room, but instead he was angry at some woman who seemed so utterly familiar. And in that moment...Castiel knew what was going on.
And that's when he heard something faintly in his panic.
Castiel just sat there, his mouth slightly open as he felt a wet tongue press over his sensitive veins, and Cas whined, shaking his head and shutting his eyes. The feeling of the itchy stubble that Noah possessed was not enjoyable, and neither were the lips that were slowly working their way to Cas' lips.
"Don't sit up, you have three broken vertebrates and a fractured sternum." Castiel said, which stopped everyone in their tracks. Dean inhaled sharply as Sam winced and lied back down.
“Hello! And welcome to yet another episode of IntriguedAssbutt and friends! About two weeks ago, I had none other than TheGirlWithTheDungeonsAndDragonsTattoo, Ms. Charlie Bradbury, and we did the blindfolded makeup challenge, and she really made my eyes pop with that mascara.” Castiel batted his eyelashes playfully, then he laughed. “Or, maybe not. Anyway, I have another guest today, and it’s someone brand new to me! Why don’t you show yourself?” Castiel grinned.
"I need your silver knife." He asked much to Sam's surprise. Sam took it out from his belt and handed it over. Castiel grabbed Not-Dean's arm and cut across it hastily. The wound blistered and burned as he screamed in pain. Sam jumped back in shock.
handicap yourself." Castiel said, sarcasm trying to worm its way into the words. Cas touched his two fingers to Sam's head and Dean could feel Cas' Grace gather and push through his fingers into Sam. Sam gasped and sat up.
"I actually thought we were going to find out instead of a 'yes'. Screw him, come on babe, let's finish our already great day." Dean asked, and Cas nodded. The rest of the evening went off without a hitch, Mrs. Team ad Kevin left shortly after Crowley did though, very paranoid that he would come back. Garth stayed until Sam and Charlie had to usher him out so that Dean and Cas could have some 'alone time'. Before Sam left, though, he walked over to his brother and pulled him into a hug.
"The babies are coming."
The couple walked out of the store hand in hand to the Impala. After putting away the groceries in the trunk, a voice came from behind the pair that made them both freeze in fear and anger.
"I don't know, the eternal glory of winning a challenge on my channel." Castiel shrugged.
“That’s great,” Karamo praised, beaming. “That’s really good work. What do you call your organization?”
"Well, the reason I had a distended abdomen in the first place was because this Vessel needed extra space to hold the full extra Grace. Now that I am in Heaven, there is no need for it because this form is only a means to an end so you do not burn." Castiel said. Sam scoffed.
All the anger Dean felt immediately evaporated and was replaced by apology and horrible pain for Dean's mate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Moving on! Alright, date of birth." Dean cut in, writing his answer down.
"Cas, you gotta heal him. His brain is fried from her. Use your mojo." Sam said, hoping it would be that simple.
Cas gestured to his pants and how they refused to button. Dean sighed in relief and smiled wearily.
"Yeah, I'm fine." Dean responded to Castiel.
"I will squeeze an answer out of him later. In the meantime! Let's see who will win!" Castiel declared. "Alright Dean, your favorite song...is "Rock of Ages"
"We've talked about this, Dean. You can do this. There's a way more likely chance of crashing in a car than in a plane, and you can have some wine on board." Castiel reminded him, and Dean nodded, swallowing hard.
"Just so you aren't bored with the details, let's skim over it. I'll read some aloud." He cleared his throat, and began to read. "
"She better be good to you. Because if she hurts you, she'll have to deal with Sam and I. No one hurts our little sister." Dean said with assurance. Charlie laughed and shoved him lightly. "What's her name?"
"Do you have the rings?" Sam nodded and pulled out the pair of rings. Dean's ring was black tungsten with a silver band through the middle, engraved with the Enochian symbol for Castiel, and Cas' ring was the opposite, a silver band with a black strip in the middle, with Dean's name in Enochian. "I believe the grooms have written their own vows. Dean?" The minister gestured. Dean pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and opened it.
"CAS! The...the baby! Is...is she?" Dean whispered, not being able to finish his sentence. Castiel shook his head and took Dean's hands.
“Not to switch the mood too abruptly, but you mentioned you guys work together,” Antoni recalled. “What do you all do?”
"I do."
"That'll be okay. But it's gonna take a few days for the paint to be completely dry and ready. We are going to do the base coat today, and maybe the second. If it needs it, then a third tomorrow. If you need us, tell me through the bond, okay? I might not hear out loud." Dean told Cas, giving him a tender kiss and then went to work on the room. It took two hours to do the first coat. Then, after lunch, Sam and Dean painted on the second coat. The second took longer, mostly because of the slight paint fight that Dean started by 'accidentally' throwing the roller behind him, hitting Sam in the back. By the end of the day, they were exhausted, red, and had a perfectly painted room. Dean slumped into the kitchen to scrounge up some food, and he found Castiel with three plates of food on the table, sitting with a big smile on his face.
"Our baby is not a physical manifestation. It is attached to my Grace and is as immune to human weapons as I am. The baby is safe." Castiel assured Dean. Dean almost fell over in complete relief, but then straightened again.
"And then...there's John Winchester." Castiel practically roared, standing up and making his chair fall over. "Dean's father is the one who hit him!! You guys all saw his face, right?! John did that! How could anyone hit their own child like that??? What would make someone stoop down to the level of hitting someone more than half their age?!?!" Castiel shouted, throwing his arms up, then he kicked his couch behind him, taking his anger out on the furniture. He kicked it, threw the pillows, pounded on the cushions, and he finally fell down onto it. After he fell, the camera did a quick jumpcut to later on, where Castiel was back in his normal chair, an ice pack on his foot from kicking the couch.
Dean was taken slightly aback by the nickname, but soon the shock wore off as he smiled widely. He placed a chaste kiss on Castiel, who was practically buzzing with happiness and excitement.
"Thank you for dinner, and I am very excited to find out what you are going to do in the nursery tomorrow." Dean whispered in Castiel's ear. Sam rolled his eyes at the moment his brother and his angel were having and decided to turn in and go to sleep.
"I have to go real quick and serve some of these guys, but I'll be right back, honey." June smiled and walked away, leaving Cas to his drink. He was able to take another sip before a hand landed on his shoulder and pulled him around to face someone. The hand belonged to a man, who was probably 45 years old, with dark, oily hair and dark eyes. The gaze he had set on Cas was predatory and hazy all at once, and he was smiling with damaged teeth. He smelled heavily of alcohol, especially when he exhaled in shock of seeing Cas' face.
"Dean called me 'babe' often, even though I was only a fledging at one point, never a baby. When I asked him the significance, he told me it was a term of endearment, and I thought of none better to describe Dean after I was told I could make one for him. The word 'beloved' loosely fits a word in Enochian, though the technical translation is 'forever loved'. That is a bit long for a nickname, don't you agree?" Cas asked innocently. Dean was surprised. He never heard the story behind his pet name, and it made Dean blush and feel tremendous pride at the same time.. He could feel Castiel chuckling lightly through the bond.
"Thanks, Cas. That means a lot to me." Dean said honestly, and before they could get too awkward, Castiel turned to the camera.
Castiel looked at Sam and held out his hand, looking innocent. Sam chuckled and held his hand out.
"Its only the first month, we've got plenty of time to argue about the gender, lets just get back to the bunker." Sam said, getting into the Impala. Dean got in and once Cas was in the back, he started the car and started the long drive back to the Men of Letters bunker. Dean looked over at Sam, and saw that he was asleep. With a light smile, Dean poked at the bond gently.
Hey everyone. Sorry for the delay in update. Both authors got horrendously busy over the holidays and there was a mild case of writer's block to overcome. But we're once again sitting down together to crank this out and get it finished as it's something we both love and take pride in. Happy reading :)
Dean was surprised, but followed instruction and got his brother.
Dean knelled down to Cas' now distended stomach and smiled.
"Don't be scared, Cas. I've got you. Whatever this is, we can handle it. Right?" Dean asked as he pulled him into a hug. Cas nodded into his chest, fighting stinging tears.
"You okay, buddy?" Noah asked, and Castiel, while he could barely speak, managed an actual giggle. Castiel, former angel of the Lord, giggled out loud. That just made Noah's now creepy grin become even bigger as his hand drifted up Cas' thigh until it rested between his legs. Castiel's head swung down to look at his crotch, which did nothing more than sit there, and then he looked back up at Noah, who leaned over to pressed his smelly lips to Castiel's neck.
"You and Sam have been so good to me during my pregnancy, it is only right I return the favor in some way, so I made dinner." Castiel declared as Sam came into the kitchen. The Sasquatch grinned and sat at the table eagerly.
"Hey, Charlie?...No we aren't cancelling, I was calling because we have a change in plans...No...Yes, surprise party for Cas...Haha, no. Dean screwed up, so we are helping him apologize...Okay, bye." Sam hung up and turned to Dean who was grabbing the keys to the Impala. Dean was focusing on the bond. He pried it open for a second and sent a few waves of mock disapproval.
Dean had lost count of the days since he last saw Castiel. With his head so pitifully empty of the bond that he once held so closely to his heart, Dean was broken. Naomi knew this. Once a day, she would come into his cell and drill into his mind to find information. Information about Castiel, the babies, Sam, his family; anything she could get. By the end, Dean was screaming in pain and nearly dead. Then, Naomi would heal him and put him back in the prison. This went on for ten months, and everyday, Dean prayed for his angel to come for him, but he never did.
"No way. I gotta help you. Is there anything I can do? Get you a towel? Or something to drink to get the taste out of your mouth?" Dean asked, rubbing circles on Castiel's back. Castiel just nodded. Dean understood and he got up and left to the kitchen to get him some water. When he went back to the bathroom, there was no one there. Instead, he found the angel on the couch where he was before. Dean furrowed his brow.
"Yeah, sounds perfect. I'm gonna chill in my room and get finished packing." Dean said, leaving the room before Castiel could thank him. Castiel shrugged and decided he could do it later.
"Hang on a sec, I gotta take these to Cas. Actually, you should probably come with me. He's pretty excited to see you." Dean told her as they made their way into the bunker.
"Yes." Then he vanished, like he does, but Dean sighed.
"Yeah, he said good job on the idea, Sammy." Dean complimented, much to Sam's surprise. Sam smiled and put the paints on the counter. After getting back to the bunker, they brought the supplies to the room destined to be a nursery. The floor was covered in plastic and the furniture was yet to be brought in. Castiel walked into the room and saw the pair beginning to open the paint.
"A shifter?! But if he's here, where the hell is Dean?!" Sam asked the creature. He smiled menacingly and spat in his direction. Castiel grabbed his shoulders and looked into his stolen emerald eyes.
"Thank you, Sam. I'll take that into consideration." Cas said neutrally, and he stepped ahead of Sam, so he was between the oldest and youngest Winchester.
"You took my mate. Then you thought I wouldn't notice that you had taken his place? Who put you up to this because it is obvious you are not smart enough to have planned all this alone." Castiel asked, his anger seeping through his words. Not-Dean gulped and looked from side to side.
"It means that I would bind my Grace to your soul for all of eternity. Basically, we would be each other's forever. But I could not possibly take that from you, I can't take your life from you." Castiel said as he turned to leave, but Dean caught his arm.
"That seems fair." Dean nodded with his lips pursed. He reached off screen and brought some notecards and pens up, handing one stack to Castiel and keeping one for himself. "First question. Favorite song." Dean said, grinning as he quickly wrote down his answer.
"DAMMIT." Dean cursed, putting down his bags with a heavy sigh. "C'mon! Can't we go one day without problems!?" Dean gave an exasperated sigh and sank down into an office chair. Castiel looked at the bed, and he too sighed.
"Down, boy. I am not here to threaten you, but to warn you." Crowley turned around and started to walk away. "But since you two are so intent on killing me, I guess I'll just go..."
This sounded like every single romantic movie ever made, yet Dean clearly had not yet wrangled his feelings for Cas. Karamo could see the smile Dean flashed at Cas, and the warm looks on their faces, as if sharing an unknown joke. Karamo recognized it from his own relationship experience.
"Cons don't normally refund for cancelled events or guests."
"Thank you, Dean. And I am here for you as well. If you ever need anything, I am just a message away." He smiled, his blue eyes twinkling. "So, next question? Date of birth...I think I remember hearing that it was January...uh, not the 21st...oh! The 24th!" Castiel decided, and Dean made a face.
"Do you feel like there is anything wrong? Like, any angel senses that are off?" Dean inquired as he got off the couch, then knelt down to be eye to eye with Castiel. "Tell me everything."
"Well...that was certainly more than I bargained for. I didn't think I would get so into it. As it appears, I'm already almost ten minutes into this video, and I've only read one fanfiction. So, I guess I'll have to make this a series, huh? Maybe you can go nag Cas about this stuff and try to get him to do it." Dean snickered, and he closed the small window, so it was now only him in the video. "Okay, I'm out of here. I'll see you all later, and remember, never be afraid to reach out to me if any of you need some help with anything. I'll try my best to talk to every single one of you." Dean smiled widely. "Bye!" He waved, and the screen went dark.
"Oh don't you demand things from me Mr. Winchester. I will do what I see fit to do. Now. Hadraniel, take him. I will follow shortly." The angel, Hadraniel, nodded stiffly and grabbed Dean's shoulder and flew off. Naomi looked at the shifter and smiled. "You know what to do. His memories and demeanor have been copied to your mind. Which means it should not arouse suspicion from the other Winchester. You know what to do."
"So. We can share Grace?" Dean asked hesitantly.
On opposite walls were names. 'Mary Joanna' was scripted neatly onto the left wall, in black elegant strokes. The right wall held the words 'Robert John' in large, bold letters. It was just as elegant, but more masculine in form and the letters were in white. But that wasn't what got Dean's attention.
and they mentioned it." Cas explained. Dean nearly choked on air. Sam stared at Dean with a gaping mouth.
"Thank you all for watching, and have an intriguing day." He smiled, then the screen went dark.
"Thanks Sammy." Charlie gave a hug to Cas and Dean, stopping to comment on how well she put together Cas, then the pair left. Castiel was lying on the bed with a great big smile and a suggestive wink.
"Just...don't talk about that. I am going to murder any guy who goes near her." Dean growled as he got in the car. His brother kept laughing as they drove to the party supplies store. They got inside and tried to find a worker. An older woman met them, her graying hair was curled neatly and she smiled warmly.
"What do you mean, Dean? You killed her? Don't you remember going all 'angel' on her?" Sam asked, furrowing his eyebrows. Dean was surprised.
"Don'...wan' no...nothing." Castiel stammered.
"Dean has never, ever called me baby. I have always been his 'babe' and him my beloved. Tell me what you are before I smite you!" Castiel yelled with Heavenly power. The glass of water on the table nearby shattered into a million pieces, as well as the lightbulb in the lamp as Castiel's real voice threatened to burst through. Not-Dean whimpered and covered his face.
"NO!" Dean stood up and looked over the paper, finding a number to call. "I'll be right back." Dean said as he held his phone to his ear and left the room to yell at some people. Castiel stayed put, looking at the paper some more. When he found out about the cancellation, he had gotten really upset too, but he didn't know what he could do. It wasn't his event even. He stood up and went to his room, passing Dean's on the way.
"Wait!" Dean yelled after him, Crowley's lip twitched into a smile as he turned back to face him. Cas furrowed his brow and looked at Dean, confusion prodding Dean's mind.
He nodded weakly as looked up and Cas with grim eyes.
Queen of Moondoor, so I am officially this little one's god-queen!" Charlie declared, patting Castiel's stomach tenderly. Dean scoffed.
Dean sighed as he got into the car with Cas by his side. Castiel wanted to go with him because even though Cas had been with the Winchesters for awhile, he had yet to go grocery shopping, which was apparently important now that Cas ate like there was no tomorrow. They got to the store and went in. Castiel grabbed a cart and pushed it with enthusiasm over being there. Dean shoveled the necessities into the cart, occasionally throwing in something special for one of the residents of the bunker, be it him, Cas, or even Sam or Charlie. Dean made sure to get at least three packs of Oreos, much to the glee of Castiel.
"Well, can you get us to Heaven? Both of us?" Sam asked, hoping the answer was yes. Cas furrowed his eyebrows and thought for a moment.
"You know, I have no problem with you guys, but if you are going to do that, then I want Dean to stop calling me on the chick flick moments." Sam asked. Dean stood up straight and shook his head.
"We are not taking the Impala. Take one of the trucks. We are going to have a
