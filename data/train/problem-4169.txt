,” the sheriff corrected, before explaining. “You care about everybody so damn much. Sometimes more than you should.”
He just shrugged, for a moment wishing so badly that his dad would walk through the door and fix everything for him. It was a common wish, for his dad to eventually show back up and take back control, take over the money issues and the problems at school and the fact that they always looked homeless in too-big or too-small clothes that sometimes were nearly falling apart at the seams. Inside, he was still that little boy that thought his daddy could fix any problem.
None of that happened, though, because Sam rounded the corner behind him and froze, gaze moving between them, assessing the situation. “Uh. Hi, Mom,” he said dumbly, and Dean turned a watery glare his direction. “You made good time.”
Just as she was closing the trunk, Dean skidded into the garage, Castiel on his heels. She smiled as Dean silently debated where to sit, before crawling into the backseat, tugging on Castiel’s sleeve until he followed him. Mary settled into the driver’s seat, put on some soft classic rock she knew Dean would recognize, and started toward their destination.
“I don’t know. I haven’t watched this show in years. Think I’ll keep it on.” Mary did turn down the volume, but the pretty colors kept flashing even as Dean’s eyes fluttered closed. Just as he was starting to fall asleep, Cas’s fingers threaded through his hair and he sighed, burrowing deeper into his pillows.
“I really believe it’s them, Singer,” John said gruffly, glancing between the boys before shaking his head. “Don’t really understand half of what comes out of their mouths, but they seem legit.” Dean snorted at that, and Sam seemed to bristle. Cas just looked indifferent, if a little impatient.
He dug through a trash can, then moved on to a dumpster in the next alley before he finally found a newspaper. The date claimed it was 2020, and his fingers froze on the page. That couldn’t be right? Could it?
Growing up, Mary Winchester had practically been a religious figure in their family. Dean hardly remembered her, and what he did remember was hazy and rose-colored. Dad only talked about the good things, about how loving and funny and bright she had been. Over the years, the woman had been practically deified. When Dean had been young, he had made up stories for Sammy about their mom, made her into a superhero, something larger than life. Eventually, she had become something bigger, something
“So, Bobby’s then?” John asked. He wasn’t really looking forward to seeing the man again; last time they hadn’t parted on such great terms, and he didn’t enjoy the thought of a gut full of buckshot.
Dean held his face in his hands, wide eyed and confused and hating every second of this. “But! I don’t
Looking around in a daze, Dean tried to figure out where he was, but nothing looked familiar. The street was empty, most of the lights in the surrounding buildings were off, and he didn’t recognize any of the street signs or businesses.
Dean’s ears flared red and glanced over the top of his menu at his mother, who for the most part seemed to be ignoring them. Dean swallowed hard and nodded at Castiel, who went back to absently drumming his fingers slowly against the tabletop and glancing out the window.
The drive to Bobby’s was fairly quiet; John had spent countless hours with his boys in the backseat while he drove cross-country, and they had never
She knew she didn’t have to say anything, even nonverbally ask it of him. Castiel understood, probably better than she did; if anything happened, he would protect Dean first, and she was more than grateful for that.
The next morning, John blinked open gummy eyes, rubbing at his face as he groaned at the headache. Looking around, he found himself in Bobby Singer’s living room, the old drunk passed out on his own sofa next to him.
Sam sighed, rubbing a hand across his face, and Dean couldn’t help but feel bad; Sam looked like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and this was just one more thing on his plate. He waved back towards the table. “You should finish eating. I promise I’ll tell you what’s going on, but it’s up to you whether you believe me or not.”
“So,” he started, turning to look at Sam, “you’re really my baby brother, huh?” Now that he was alone with them, Dean was starting to feel some doubts.
She took a seat across from them, just observing for a moment. Sam turned to smile at her, but his attention was quickly snatched by the witch pointing something out in her book. Cas was watching Mary closely, as if expecting her to say something that might send either of her boys spiraling. She couldn’t blame him, really, as that was actually fairly common for her. Constantly putting her foot in her mouth, stepping on toes, breaking boundaries she didn’t even know were there.
“Are you shitting me?” she asked, voice high and breathy. “The Winchesters and their pet angel came after
He was a nerdy little guy, dressed more like a lawyer or an accountant than what Dean would have pictured as an angel. His hair looked perpetually windswept, his eyes were
Castiel nodded and got in the driver’s seat, Dean following into the passenger’s seat. He drove them down the road, stopping for a few minutes to fill up the gas tank, before pulling up in front of the diner.
Dean swallowed hard around the lump in his throat. He never really thought he would make it past twenty, let alone
His eyes flew open, probably showing everyone else just how panicked he felt inside. Did he really want to be that person? Did he want to know what put that terror there in the first place?
"I feel ancient. But then at times I get so swept up by all the new things around me, I feel young and slightly hopeless...Sorry, this, what is this?"
"Yes. Our presence does seem to antagonise the killer." The lore all pointed to the Lamia. A flesh eating beast, potentially taking the disguise of a person.
Castiel shifted, a vulnerability crept along his spine and ghosted the back of his neck. As though invisible tendrils pulled at him. The same injection of perverse invasion he felt when they'd gone upstairs at Keane's house. The sensation leaving him nauseous and his chest tight. He'd been on the brink of panicked collapse when the phone had rang.
Patting himself down, Keane sighed, "My keys. Got my car's but not my work set, must of left them back at the precinct, no one should need the cruiser tonight I guess. It's been, distracting, having you here."
"I knew you would eventually go. This being, older then all around it. Alone like I am, but with a soul so bright, overflowing. Enough that it swelled the rivers of my shallow existence. I couldn't let you leave, I tried to keep you here, but it wasn't working. I've seen the contrition etched into your heart. The love that spurs the hope, I knew that if I could only talk with you...Ancient being to old creature, but you didn't come alone and here we are."
"Right Sammy, get in and get the roster for the shifts, make sure you get the right dates for the crime scenes, maybe we can get a lead there. Try an' avoid any truffle hunters."
"I also heard," Dean shifted closer again. His voice faltered slightly but it held a playful edge, "You say that you don't let yourself feel stuff, in case you lose control. But, you're here, in the bunker. No powers, no crazy witches or Angel family, so I'm going to hold you." He plucked Castiel's glass from his hand and set it on the floor by the couch. "Well not hold you, but like a hug. It's a once in a lifetime thing so just bare that in mind."
"I couldn't control the downward spiral I fell into, I was like an addict. It worsened as each kill brought us together. Then, when you began to share your pain..." Single tears streamed down Keane's face, his voice pitching higher, "I felt the same release, then when I kissed you, I touched your soul and I knew immediately what you are. It all made sense to me. I could see all of your suffering, to of endured that for so long. Stars were born and died as you ached."
"Of course, the sadness. When the body begins to let those emotions win, it triggers a release of stress in the hormones. The body already starts to shut down.  The soul is no longer impenetrable, it hovers, as if between worlds. We are demonic by nature, but not by design. Not soulless but not fulfilled with such spirit as this world's other creatures. To consume a soul, it cures a pain inside us. The longing to have what humanity has. It takes me away from my own loneliness, my own suffering."
Feeling emboldened, Cas leant forward, sliding his hand back to the cheek it had caressed. Fingers brushing the soft skin of Dean's earlobe. Pulling the other man slowly toward his face, kissing him gently.
"So I just feed him some false information when he rings," Castiel said softly, brushing past Dean's arm as he sat at the table beside the younger Winchester. "I really don't understand your overt reaction to my friendliness. I cannot help it if officer...?"
"No, Samantha, I'm asking him seriously. What did his mouth taste like?" Tone more normal and without the childish edge it had taken before, Dean looked at Cas through the mirror.
Officer Lenny Keane smiled, fork twisting in his pasta as he sat across from Castiel. "You make it sound like you're ancient." He chuckled softly.
The barn door slung open suddenly with a heavy thunk, all in a sudden moment, Sam let go of the metal handle and reached for his gun. Firing off a regular shot messily into Keane's shoulder. The wound breaking the connection with Cas.
"I have not hurt him you petulant child!" Keane roared, "The bridge between myself and the Angel far transcends your capacity for understanding!"
Sneering, Dean leered, " Alright, so then what if officer friendly is our guy? Just because Samantha's your new number one fan, doesn't mean you suddenly know how to handle a situation. You're powerless, what are you gonna do, bore him to death with your poetry?!" Teasing childishly, the older Winchester stared challengingly at Castiel.
"I understand totally," Keane smiled, his voice calm and tempting. Unseen by the brothers, his eyes lit with bubbling passion, cheeks a merry blush and lips wet as he nervously chewed them. "I like to feel that way in a relationship. My life can feel so wretched sometimes. Small town, not a lot of folk, even less like me. Sometimes I feel like a bird fallen from the nest. Too young to fly and to weak to protect myself."
Sure enough, Keane's car was parked by the old, wood-sliding place. The familiar curve of the sedan recognisable in the pale moonlight. The building was unlit, but no obvious effort to hide the vehicle had been made.
"Sorry, it's the wine, I'm not much of a drinker. It seems you're not the only one with a loose tongue. I hope I haven't blown it for a second date?"
"I thought I saw him flinch, when he picked up the key ring, he went to toss it back and I thought I should wait a second more...then it just went
Castiel took a sip of the drink and grimaced. The acrid taste of neat whiskey fouled his tongue and warmed his throat.
"Another body? Really? Where? When did this happen?" Keane sounded concerned and soon enough both figures reappeared in the living room. "They haven't rang me..."
"So you tell me Cas, why some creepy little officer flutters about you from the get-go, the killing amps up the more you two get to talking. Then, he thinks you're about to skip town and now he's called you here, to the psychopath's playground, called
Sam lowered the lid of his laptop slightly, long fingers tapping absently on the silver plastic, "In Castiel's defence, all you did was stand there and pout." Tilting his head when his brother shot him a dark look.
Humouring Sam to no end, who noted the lack of writing and eating across from him. His brother focused so intently on the ongoing conversation.
The unamaused couple beside Sam's table pursed their lips as the young Winchester gave them a toothy grin before filing out after Dean.
"He- what? I just, don't wanna have to waste time tryin' to save his ass, when we could just stick together and stick to the plan."
Sam felt like he was trespassing, on both Castiel who was sharing his self-truths and of Dean who seemed to be having a visceral, existential crisis.
, the, uh. I," Stammering as the fingers swirled slowly from his knee towards his inner thigh, still respectfully low. "Bugs. Birds, I like to be outside."
Castiel was still adapting to having a body, not just occupying one and was immediately unsettled by the jump his heart had made at the analogy. His face softening further as the human pull to be relatable, understood and accepted pushed him.
," Scoffed the Hunter. He sighed then pointedly looked at Cas's reflection, "Answer it, could be useful."
Dean's fingers curled into a fist where they were resting on the notepad, the tips pulling the paper into a creased scrunch. Sam looked his brother up and down and flicked his eyes over to the table a small ways away. He could see Castiel's suited back and the soft and flirty face Officer Lenny Keane was flashing across at him. He nodded inwardly before pulling his phone out his jacket to fiddle.
It'd been five minutes and Cas and Dean sat in total silence. Cas had felt the urge to clear his throat for a while now, but refused as to avoid triggering some kind of conversation.
They'd hugged before, passionate and desperate hugs. Bone crushing and also playful, but this wasn't in the middle of some drama. It wasn't a reunion that neither thought would come to pass. Slowly, Cas snaked his arms round Dean's middle, tightening enough to enclose them fully in the hug.
"-he said I have. Said he could see it. Was worse then anything else you've been through. He spoke matter-of-factly but the upset was clear in his tone.
'? You've kissed people before right? April, Meg? Was it like Meg?" The tension in Dean was unspooling as he felt the rush of words tumbling in anger from his mouth.
Keane seemed level-headed against Dean's anguished lash. "My apologies, Agent. I was trying to make things easier for Ro- Agent Serbet and yourselves. I have apprehended him, his name's Kent Forster, 35 and a recent release from an over-stretched psyche unit, apparently he was one of the 'l
"Rowan, don't apologise. Go, if they're going to drag you about tonight the sooner you get there the sooner we can meet up after?" The Officer placed a gentle touch on the Angel's arm, bodies close.
“Was Dean supposed to be in town? Is this de-aging, or time travel?” Jody chimed in, bringing them back to the topic at hand.
to be driven. He smiled wide, hustling over to the driver’s side door, but Sam shooed him away like an annoying toddler.
. Dean braced himself for her next words, but they still hit him like a ton of bricks. “I’m sorry, Dean. Bobby’s been gone for a few years, now. But he loved you boys, so much. You were there with him, at the end.”
Dean seemed to realize where his thoughts were going, because he just laughed, reaching out to tug the angel against his side again. Castiel the angel went willingly, practically melting against Dean’s side as the hunter jostled him gently, and suddenly Dean’s words from earlier made more sense
Yeah, Dead thought, reaching out to idly trace patterns on Cas’s chest, marveling at the fact that he was allowed to do this now. He played with the buttons on Cas’s white dress shirt, tugged playfully on his tie. Yes, this was definitely worth growing up for. There was no doubt about that.
“Sam! Hey, I’m going to put you on speaker, okay?” She pulled the thing away from her ear and pressed another button, and then there was a man speaking from the device.
Frowning, Jody leaned forward, clasping her hands between her knees as she leveled a sad, pitying look his way.
Just as he was about the open his mouth to start another conversation, there was a loud banging coming from the front door, and then it slammed open and someone in high heels began descending the stairs. Dean whipped around, expecting a fight, but Castiel just set his book down on the table again and slowly rose, moving to place a steadying hand on Dean’s arm.
After about an hour of searching, she stumbled across an article that sounded suspiciously like vampires, just a couple of counties over. She printed out the article, folding it up and putting it in her jacket pocket, before heading back to the war room.
useful. I know you’re letting me stay here because I’m your brother and you think you need to look after me and I’m just some stupid kid, but you don’t need to worry about me. I know where I stand. I know you need me older. I know I’m not who anybody wants here right now.
“Us too,” Dean said with a nod, and that was that. Rowena cleared up her things, gave Jack a tight hug, and then moved on. Sam moved to the table in the library with a stack of books and lost himself there. Dean and Cas took each other’s hands and disappeared to their room. Jack watched them all disperse, like it was no skin off their noses that they had time travelled, or seen their long-dead family, all for him.
Castiel looked confused for a moment, before he shook his head, looking fond and exasperated in equal measures. “Not quite. But one of your friends was able to hack into some kind of offshore account. Set us up with a credit card that never runs out.”
Sam, Cas, and Dean hopped out of the truck before John could convince himself to move and were already moving toward the porch. “Heya, Bobby!” Dean called, grin wide and joy practically radiating off him as he moved closer. Bobby faltered, blinking down at the men standing in his front yard, glaring at them in confusion even as he resettled the gun at their feet.
This woman with the blood on her face and blood in her mouth and vindictive look in her eye couldn’t possibly be the same woman who had once shrieked and made a horrified face when she had seen a snake slithering in the grass in the backyard while her little four year old son had giggled at the funny expression.
The boy sniffled a little and reached up to wrap his arms around Dean in return, holding the back of his jacket in a white-knuckled grip. “I appreciate that,” Jack said softly, leaning back to give Dean a smile. He nodded, clapping a hand to Jack’s shoulder, before turning back to the room.
He reached the landing at the top of the stairs, opening bedroom doors searching for any sign of his brother or Bobby, but it was starting to look hopeless. Just as he was deciding to go back downstairs, he heard the front door open again. Wide eyed, Dean fumbled with the flashlight, trying to turn it off as quickly as possible. Then, he moved into his and Sam’s room and grabbed the thin lamp between the beds, holding it like a weapon as he hid behind the door.
He pushed the pictures away, feeling guilty, and settled back down on the bed to think things through, laying down until he could shove his face in a pillow and forget about his life for a minute. He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of pine needles and ozone, and froze. It smelled different; not how he ever remembered smelling, himself. Maybe he used a different shampoo, now?
to be an adult?” Mary finally asked, having gotten the gist of the conversation by then. She held one of the shards in her hands, turning it over and over thoughtfully. Sam turned, brows furrowed, unsure himself. “If it says it lasts as long as you want, then does he not
Dean nodded, though he wasn’t quite sure what, if anything, they could honestly do. He had never heard of witches doing anything like this before, but, then again, Dad usually kept him away from witches if he could.
“I guess. Easy mysteries, the good guys always win, and it can be funny. It’s easy watching.” Then he rolled over and wormed his way under the covers, head settling next to Castiel’s hip. “I’m gonna go to sleep. You guys don’t have to keep watching this.”
The longer Dean stood in silence, the more Castiel’s smile seemed to dim, until it had faded away into an awkward, concerned look. He peered up at Dean’s eyes through his lashes, as if searching for something, and
“Oh,” he said, like it had slipped his mind that Cas and John Winchester had never technically met. “Dad, this is Castiel. Cas, this is John Winchester.” In a lower voice, meant just for Cas, Dean said, “Don’t punch him, please.”
Sam opened his mouth to say something else, no doubt something biting and hurtful, scowl dark and bitter. Dean cut him off before he could get a word out, eyes wide and a little panicked. “I think that’s a great idea!” he said quickly. Sam turned to him in confusion, but at least he wasn’t scowling anymore. “C’mon, man. I’m no use just sitting here, and you know it. Me and Mom can go check out the vamps. You and Rowena can keep researching. You know I’ll go stir crazy if I don’t get out of here soon.”
The ride to her home took less than five minutes, and silence between them was almost painful. Dean could tell the woman was itching to ask questions, throwing him looks out of the side of her eyes every few seconds, but she was holding back. Dean, for his part, just wished that this was all some bad dream he was going to wake up from any moment now.
“Uh huh,” Dean finally said dumbly, realizing he should probably be responding instead of having a crisis. He needed to make some kind of excuse, get out of here so he could think, and maybe sleep for the next week or so. “I’m gonna, uh, go get some sleep. I’m beat.” He backed out of the room and turned tail towards his room. He knew he was being a coward, but wasn’t that just par for the course? He couldn’t handle anymore heavy emotional talks right now. He was just
trying to find the counter-curse while Dean had been in constant pain. Witches, man. He wondered if Sammy even remembered that whole disaster.
He had never expected to see her again, certainly not in the flesh, and he wasn’t sure how to handle her and all her real-person issues.
When neither Sam nor Dean seemed happy to answer, Castiel did instead, turning his intense eyes on Bobby as he explained. “Our child was cursed by a witch, and his grace was bound. It has caused him great discomfort, and we fear it may have worse side effects if we cannot reverse it. There is a spell in this book, which I read years ago, in this very room, that could help him. However, I could not recall the specifics, and I did not want to guess with my son’s life in the balance.”
Dean nodded, filing that away for later. Maybe he could try to pump Cas for information on older-him. Claire did say they were best friends, right? “Uh, what are you reading?” he asked instead, not really caring but definitely wanting to break the silence between them.
“Eileen your girl, then?” John asked, getting off the interstate when he saw the sign for Sioux Falls. He wasn’t an idiot; he could read between the lines here. He wouldn’t say he was 100% shocked at the revelation that Dean was dating a guy, but he
When he turned to look, bright green eyes were staring up at him. Dean, with his freckles and his tan skin and his sandy blond hair. Dean, decidedly
.” Sam waved his hand at Dean, and Dean frowned. The food he had on his plate no longer looked so appetizing. Was he really that much of an idiot?
Dean stood, moving to take his placed beside Cas; he had spent more than enough time with John towering over him with a bad attitude and he definitely wasn’t going to tolerate it today, not when their kid’s life was at stake.
Mary took the lead, peeking her head into the barn, giving herself time for her eyes to adjust to the darkness. Shafts of noonday sunlight passed through the barn from holes in the roof, lighting the interior up just enough for her to see five bodies strewn around the barn, sleeping.
job of it. He set his burger down and crept towards the doorway, leaning forward so he could hear Sam’s half of the conversation better. Castiel watched him go with a sigh, but he didn’t try to stop him, so it couldn’t be anything too bad, he reasoned.
“Okay,” Dean said, taking his time to take his plate into the kitchen. He stepped back into the dining room, head down and unobservant, just to get tackled in a hug by Claire. She wrapped her arms around him and
“I try,” the angel eventually said, his hand stilling on Dean’s head as he thought over his next words. “Dean is very important to me. As is Sam. But Dean and I,” he trailed off, looking conflicted. “We went through Hell together. Purgatory, too. We’ve lied to each other, and fought each other, and fought together, too. In the end, I’d like to think that he knows we have each other to fall back on. I
“Likewise?” John said, sounding unsure about that. “Surprised you boys let another hunter tag along with you,” he mumbled afterwards, though he sounded like he didn’t quite believe his own words. This man, a
“I suppose I’ll take your word for it, ya paranoid bastard,” Bobby said, already looking like he regretted saying it. “Get in here, ya idgits, before I change my mind.”
Mary turned to look at him over her shoulder, flashing him a smile full of bloody teeth, even more blood splattered across her face. Dean stared at her with wide eyes, hands still reaching out, and had a moment of mental disconnect.
“What’s going on in here?!” Jody asked, rushing into the kitchen, sounding flustered and worried as she rounded the corner, still buttoning up her shirt. Her eyes looked a little wild until she saw Dean at the stove, not Claire. She sighed in relief, shaking her head, one hand on her pounding heart. “Oh, thank God. I thought Claire was trying to cook again.”
“I’m fine, buddy,” he lied, looking away and moving back towards the bed, leaving the door open behind him. Castiel hesitated in the doorway for a moment before tentatively following Dean, closing the door gently behind himself. Dean collapsed against the headboard and absently patted the bed beside him. Cas nodded, seating himself beside his friend, clasping his hands between his knees. Their legs stretched out in front of them and Dean smiled, knocking his foot against Castiel’s.
) He was just a small-time hunter; the worst thing he ever ran into was an angry spirit or a skinwalker. Now, Sam was here talking about ‘celestial beings’ and demons and vampires? How much had the world,
haven’t given up on calling me Sammy.” He raised an unimpressed eyebrow at Dean, which made Dean crack a little smile, which had probably been his intention. Sam grinned back and relaxed against the seat, sighing into the silence. “I know this must be kind of scary, man. But we’ll figure it out. We always do.”
Dean was staring at Castiel’s angel blade with open curiosity, but obviously pushed it to the side when Mary passed him. He turned, following her, shifting his grip on his machete anxiously.
John hummed noncommittedly, not so sure about all of that. It was odd that Dean was being so touchy-feely with another person, too, but he wasn’t going to unpack that now. Instead, he glanced out the window again, scowling when he didn’t see the Impala there.
Castiel, the angel, seemed to perk up at the song, a little smile on his face as he glanced meaningfully at Dean, who simply chuckled brightly and nodded in response. John wasn’t sure what exactly that was supposed to mean, but the angel leaned back in his seat comfortably and did something with his hands that John couldn’t quite see.
Dean bit his lips, hands fidgeting in his lap. “I just don’t know what to do, Cas,” he eventually admitted, having a hard time even looking the angel in the eye as he bared his soul. “I’m not supposed to be here, at least not me as I am right now. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know what anybody wants from me, and I’m just lost.” He gripped his hair in his hands again, leaning forward until his forehead was pressed tightly against his knees. “I know I’m not who anybody wants here, but I can’t fix it, and the witch can’t fix it, and I’m
Mary was still staring at Dean with wide eyes as she nodded, speechless. “When,” she started, voice strangled. She coughed weakly before trying again. “When you told me, I guess I wasn’t expecting…,” she trailed off, blinking hard, eyes fixed on Dean’s youthful face. “Oh, baby,” she sighed, finally reaching out to touch Dean’s tear-stained cheek. Dean swallowed thickly, unable to speak, but stood tall. He wanted her to want him, to see her son before her and want to
“I’m not sure it’s going to be that easy,” Castiel revealed sadly, after Dean had already tried and failed. He turned to trade glances with Dean, who was staring up at him from the table with sad, disappointed eyes. “This is a complex spell. It could have many meanings and interpretations.” Sighing, he met Dean’s gaze head-on, tilting his head down. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
In one of the desk drawers, he found a little jewelry box, full of old rings and leather bracelets. He recognized one of them as Mom’s wedding band and frowned before promptly closing the box and shoving the drawer closed again.
“Not that he’s not scary as shit, but after you’ve seen him grumpy in the morning without a cup of coffee, or waxing poetic about bees, or looking confused about movie references, he’s not so intimidating. At least, not to us. He’s been a part of our family for, what, twelve years now? Nearly thirteen?”
Dean looked away, face pensive as he thought that over. Mary sounded far more confused. “So, you were all okay working with demons, but the British Men of Letters was just a step too far?” She didn’t mean to sound so snippy, but she was still a little pissed that they were so distrustful of them. She had thrown herself in with the organization, but she always reserved the right to leave them.
Dean yawned suddenly, so wide he felt his jaw crack, and he smiled sheepishly at Cas. “I’m sorry, you’re not boring, but I really am exhausted.”
,” Dean said, turning towards Cas again, eyes wide, “you’ve been here for me like no one else ever has before, and I can’t imagine older-me not loving you back, man.” He shifted uncomfortably on the bed for a moment before sighing and admitting, “Hell,
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Mary said softly, gripping the steering wheel with white knuckled fingers. “I don’t know a lot about how you grew up, or what John was like after I died, but I understand he changed over the years. I’m just trying to wrap my head around
Feeling a little sick at the amount of pain radiating off of her, Dean shivered, frowning at her. “Sorry.” He felt a little sick, now, and really, really wanted this conversation to just be over. Maybe if he went to sleep, he would wake up in his room at Bobby’s house, and he could chalk all this up to some wacky dream.
“He, uh. He looks like a twenty-year old, but he’s really only four. He’s a good kid.” John nodded at Sam’s words, still trying to absorb all of this. He saw the sign for Singer Salvage and turned right, heading down the familiar gravel drive. He didn’t miss the three very obvious sighs of relief when the house came into view, but he did raise a curious brow, glancing at them out of the corner of his eye.
“Of course, of course,” she said, setting her bag down on the table. “Sit, dear. Won’t take but a mo’.” Dean didn’t look so agreeable, so Castiel wrapped a hand around his shoulder and gently guided him down into a seat, hovering behind him as Rowena moved closer. She held out a hand and Dean jerked back, glaring.
Mary returned a few minutes later and ushered them towards their room. Dean grabbed the bed closest to the door, bouncing on the edge for a second before turning a look up at the adults.
“I don’t think it’s as simple as that,” Rowena began, cutting in before it devolved into an argument. “Right now, Dean does not remember being an adult, and I’m sure he hasn’t heard many good stories. All he knows is being a teenager. That’s like you right now, as you are, being told you’re the wrong age, so please remember being older than you are now, and
“Who was that?” Dean asked without preamble. They both knew he had been eavesdropping; there was no use pussyfooting around it.
“That’s all water under the bridge, dear. Now, come along. I need some blood.” Dean held his hands to his chest like he was clutching a set of pearls and scowled, but Sam was already reaching out and pricking his own finger, letting the blood well up before squeezing a few drops into the bowl. Stupid, trusting little brother.
“Dude,” she drawled, waving a hand at the angel before shoving him away from Dean. “He doesn’t remember you. Personal space, yeah? You’re making him uncomfortable, scoot over.” Before Castiel could react, Claire squeezed herself in between them. Once there was more room, she moved herself out of Dean’s personal bubble and leaned against the sofa, groaning loudly. “You people are ridiculous,” she grumbled under her breath, rubbing at her eyes.
A soft rap at his door broke him from his spiraling thoughts and Dean pulled the pillow over his face again, letting out a low, frustrated growl. He could tell whoever was on the other side of the door was hesitating, probably having heard him.
“I’ll go with you,” Cas said with finality, and Dean deflated on the spot, though he looked secretly relieved. Mary smiled, already a little excited about this whole endeavor. She barely knew Dean as he was in the here-and-now, and she didn’t know anything about how he was at sixteen. This would be an eye-opening experience for both of them.
Nothing happened for a moment. They waited in silence, staring at the space in front of them, and then suddenly there was another young man standing in the room. He smiled, happy as he took in the scene around himself.
“Thanks again, for letting me crash here tonight, ma’am. I do appreciate it. And you getting ahold of my brother.”
Mary’s silence was nearly deafening, and Dean winced, feeling like he had undoubtedly said something wrong. He stared down at his hands for a long moment before sighing, turning away to look out the window, smile long gone. Castiel frowned; so much for easy conversation.
“It’s a crap thing to do to yourself, loving me,” Dean told him, laughing lightly when Cas flicked him gently on the nose.
Jody laughed, pushing his head away playfully, before she turned and headed toward the stairs. “It’s not a problem, Dean. You’re family around here.” She gave him one last determined look. “We’ll figure out what’s going on in the morning, okay? Just try and get some rest.” He nodded, biting his lip and pulling the blanket up just a little higher, and she flipped the lights off, plunging him into darkness.
“Where are we?” Sam asked, but the question was cut off by the sound of a shotgun cocking. They slowly raised their hands, turning around to face the person on the other end of that gun.
John paled a little at that but nodded, looking away out the window again, unable to meet their hard, judging gazes.
When he didn’t react, Claire took that as her cue to continue. “They need a vessel in order to be on Earth. My dad is Castiel’s vessel. He’s your best friend, and you guys all sort of tried to look out for me over the years. When I let you,” she said with a crooked smirk, though it looked a little sad, too.
Bobby stared at them for a long moment, apparently digesting that fact, before he turned to the library and started rooting through books. Castiel stood as well, moving around the room and taking in the books, the weapons, the dust surrounding them with a fond look in his eyes. Dean watched him with a soft face, but Sam just looked sad.
. The townsfolk wept for him, an unpredictable reaction took over Littlewood. The sadness and awakening of my sensitivity to such feelings took over once more and I became the beast I was created to be."
He confided in me, the only thing that stopped him, from taking the leap, was that he feared he wouldn't be allowed into heaven and would not be reunited with his beloved. He told me that it was becoming harder to keep going. I worried that he could be right. I don't know what will happen when I eventually go, but I couldn't sleep thinking about this man and his grief. Then, I saw him one night, a few weeks before you arrived. Blackout drunk, unconscious almost...Numb. His soul was singing as it pulled away from his body, a vast force held back by the last threads of life itself...
"So Cas, what did officer friendly's tongue taste like?" The older Winchester snapped, back turned to the Angel on the backseat.
"Officer Keane, confused my attempt at an iron test for a casual flirtation. In fact, surely that's good luck, else what other explanation would there be for such a mistake?" His soft blue eyes trained up toward Dean who stood with a hand resting on one hip, sipping occasionally from the bottle.
Dean hurriedly started to gather his stuff and simultaneously throw his jacket on. Sam looked bewildered and threw a hand out to steady his brother, "Dude, what were you saying to Cas about being inconspicuous?" He murmured.
Thrown off by the unusual statement, Cas quickly tried to scan his memories for a time either of the Winchester's said this to him. Frantically trying to discern if this was a typical social nuance between friends and acquaintances. Nothing turning up, his face pulled tight, Keane looked for the first time that evening, nervous.
The Angel was placid, swirling the scotch in a smooth singular turn of his wrist. "I appreciate the offer Dean, but I understand such a thing would make you uncomfortable and it is my desire to not provoke such feelings in anyone. Least of all you."
Annoyed, Cas tilted his head and stared hard at the rearview mirror. Dean flicked his eyes up briefly and huffed when he saw. "Why you continue to berate me when I am the only one furthering this case is beyond my understanding of humanity."
'", Dean air quoted. Head jerking at the older and less robust looking men resting against a patrol cruiser, coffees in hand. "Are having a pow-pow?"
"-No there's not!" Keane screamed. His face contorted into an agonised picture of grief and wretchedness. "There is no love in the next life for me. No one will be there because she didn't wait! Couldn't handle the pain of losing so many of our kind. I wasn't enough! She promised us eternity and stole it in the night. She's gone. I cannot go where she went because it would be alone that we burn in the pits of hell. I cannot go anywhere, there is no natural end to this painful existence."
"Are you encouraging this?!" Voice breaking as his mind felt fractured suddenly. The Hunter shook his head. "Sirens, Lucifer, every goddamn demon...this is their game! Cas, dude, did you forget being actually fucking murdered last time you walked into a 'date'?"
Twiddling his fingers around his own tumbler, ring clinking gently on the glass. He nibbled his lip absently before peeking at Castiel.
Cas hopped out the back and then plonked in the passenger seat. "Someone has confessed. Leonard is with him now, said would it be easier for the paperwork if we made the arrest."
The hearty chuckle unsettled the Angel, before the other man spoke, eyes fond and tender, "Is this something some asshole's said to you?"
"Shoot him Cas. He's the killer, you know it, I know it!-" The Hunter spat, flinching slightly as Keane jerked the pistol toward him. "
"I would say come with me, but if my boss is there, he would be confused if I showed up with local police. You know how purist they get up-rank." Castiel improvised, the bureaucratic institutions not dissimilar from the Angel's.
Sam gently closed the lid of the laptop completely, voice breaking as he went to speak, clearing his throat rather loudly before continuing, "You...Get what...wait Cas, do you...?"
The Hunter grunted in response, then mumbled about the shower. When he'd disappeared with a wash bag and towel, Cas turned to Sam.
Finding him in the parking lot with Cas as they both ducked into the impala. Sam catching up and dropping into the passenger side, the car dipping as he manoeuvred his lanky body.
"Cas is right Dean. It's nothing you wouldn't of played yourself, you have to hand it to him, it's pretty good."
Castiel felt a ghost pain of being stabbed burn in his stomach. He sat quietly for a moment, refraining from eye contact, "I understand your concern Dean, as Sam said, you can follow me and keep an eye on things."
"Why the fuck would he do that?!" Yelping, Dean stepped to Sam, before looking confused and determined at Cas. "You aren't gonna take your clothes of, are you?!"
The Angel simply shook his head in silent anger before storming off along the road back to their motel.
Dean would of thought he was praying if he didn't know him. Sam chatted to compensate for all of them, having waited the first hour for his brother to pick out a cassette, only to realise there wouldn't be music the on four hour trip.
Tentatively blinking back across at his friend, Dean moved the palm to his mouth and pressed an innocent kiss into the palm. It lingered and his stare intensified.
The drive back to Lebanon had been melancholic. Cas was usually a silent passenger, but often Dean would find him gazing in peaceful reverie at the passing Kansas countryside, this journey he'd sat still, head hung low and hands resting on his knees palm upward.
Dean looked horrified, "Dude! You eat people?! Like actually fucking eat their heads off?! You ever thought of just getting takeout?!"
"You think so?" The Angel's voice fluttered softly. Keane must of nodded. "You don't think it's, uh, dumb?"
"I sensed his turmoil when he arrived. At the crime scene you first worked. It took every ounce of self-control not to consume you all then and there." Keane looked hungrily at Dean and the Hunter reclenched his fists, noting the Angel flinching in the corner of his eye.
Castiel also appeared shocked, having not considered the dinner to be so, but upon reflection realised it was nothing but. Thinking on his feet and having not really gotten any kind of information other then an insight into the private workings of Lenny Keane's mind, Castiel decided to do what he assumed the Winchester's would do in his stead.
He let himself flop back against the cushions, Cas going with him. Chest to chest they embraced lovingly. Dean stroking absently through the thick dark hair that mussed so easily.
"There is no living if not for love." Keane's voice broke, pistol beginning to tremble in his hand as tears erupted and ran free down his cheeks.
Dean perched on his knees and stared not-so-subtly as the Officer took the trench coat from the hostess and proffered it to Cas to slip into. The muffled sound irritated the Hunter's ear through the headphone. The signal tapering as Keane held the door open and Cas brushed past him and entered the night outside. The last of the connection disappearing with the Angel.
"I can see what you've done to him. Millions of years of trauma and loneliness and nothing compared to the last ten years he's been tormented with." Keane growled.
Dean gestured with his beer, his expression pulled into sarcastic mocking as he took wide steps toward the Angel. "But you,
Once they got back to the bunker, Sam collared Kevin and made base in the library. Keen to document more on the Lamia after a mild debrief from Cas and to keep the teenager out of the firing line of both men's emotions.
Dean whimpered for a second before clearing his throat to mask it. His nose brushing against Castiel's, a thumb idly rubbing his light stubble. He wrapped his arms around the Angel again, pulling him closer, deepening the kiss.
"So while me and Sammy have to sit up all night tryin' to figure out who is Mr Crime Scene Interruptis-"
Castiel's expression soured, "Why is it you take everything so personally. You yourself encourage me to take initiative. I was simply building on an opportunity that presented itself in a way to advance our investigation, to get a unique input from a potential library of inside knowledge." He nodded at Sam as he accepted the beverage.
"Oh." Castiel's voice perked in gentle interest. Dean frowned even deeper and held back the urge to use his little mirror to peep at the table.
Once the figures were gone, Dean shot into the house, quickly navigating his way to the location and snatching the keys. A temptation to stand still, holding his breath and listen, won out for only a moment. Once safely back in the impala, Sam rings Castiel's phone.
Keane hesitated at the base of the stairs, "Don't you do breakfast? If it were up to me, I'd have you tell them to keep your plants watered." He chuckled flirtatiously, eyebrows waggling.
By some relief there was more light coming from the barn then on initial look. The heavy door shunted to the side on a rail, enough to get inside. Once in, Keane calmly shut it, heaving with both hands.
" The Hunter all but screamed, stepping toward his friend, but backing off as the pistol hammer clicked. "He's listened to your story man, please..."
" Dean exclaimed out loud. Luckily not so loud to be heard by the pair, but enough that the table adjacent to the brothers turned disapproving looks their way as Sam raised his brows. Wondering if his forehead would remain crinkled if he continued to indulge the older Winchester in chasing an Angel around for, personal reasons.
, I'm not a creature of low intelligence Dean. You forget my role before your existence was battle strategist. We take guns."
"Cas...I heard what you said to the- to Leonard. About wanting to feel cared for and stuff. Vulnerable and held. I could do that for you..." Dean's voice cracked. They were sat a foot apart and he shifted a little closer.
Keane snarled with rage, spinning and pointing the pistol at Dean, finger twitching at the trigger as Castiel cried out, "
Castiel broke the kiss, resting his head on Dean's chest. The sound and feel of his heart was louder then he expected. He could wholeheartedly understand the child's desire to nestle in for comfort. Immediately lulled into a sense of security, he smiled, "I do enjoy being held. It is very fulfilling, however, I don't want this to change our dynamic. I am still the remains of a magnificent source of power. My very voice can level towns, my visage is a terrifying beauty that will burn the very eyes of those who are look upon my face. I can destroy armies of demons with sheer intent alone. Well, not so much these days, being without grace...but please don't treat me differently because..."
Hastily grabbing one, Dean rolls his eyes, "You're gonna go make googly eyes over spaghetti at some cop who's tryin' to ride your tail feathers on this case? Just, FYI, to get a head up at the station. Not because he digs your silly, little nature facts or your dumb, emo-girl metaphors."
Flinging himself in Keane's path. "Please don't do this!" Reaching a hand behind himself and gentle touching Dean's stomach with his fingertips. Feeling the sharp respirations as the Hunter grabbed at his arm to pull himself in front of the Angel. Sensing his next move, Cas simply pushed him back.
Castiel turned his head patiently and Dean groaned, flicking his keys and taking them onto the road.
The other two followed, Castiel unperturbed and Dean scanning the nearby cornfields, swishing in whispers and shrouded in darkness.
Noticing the gaze avoidance of his brother after watching him on the scanner "Cas it's Sam, get outta there."
The other two men simply listened in silence as Keane spoke. Dean had stilled, jaw still clenched but hands loose.
Sam saw him in the wing mirror as he walked down the street path, lit by the tall lamps, haloing him in light as he approached the car.
"Okay Dean." Cas looked wide-eyed back at the Hunter. Taking in his whole face as they got closer. Unsure of what to do with his hands.
Cas replies, voice slightly wavey and breathless, "Yes sir?...Have you notified Agent's Stein and Adam's?...do we have coordinates?...okay...has the coroner removed the body?...I'll be right there...no, it's not a problem."
, well, we don't need you to do that, you will have a mic under your shirt so probably best not to."
After a quick reassuring nod to Sam, the Hunter dropped down beside the Angel. Hand rubbing soothing circles on his back, "You tried buddy, he's at peace."
A secondhand blush crept up Dean's cheek, Sam opened his mouth to speak but Dean briskly cut him off with his hand held up. Head crooned intently as he listened.
Cas wavered, the baiting and jokes were Dean's shield. He was afraid and Cas couldn't make a decision.
Eyes wide, mouth open and words unspoken. Dean felt limp and helpless. The truth was no surprise to him but to hear it felt like a revelation.
"Heaven has its rules, but it's not unkind or unjust to the spirits it inhabits." Cas sobbed, the residual connection creating a rift between them, large waves of emotion crashing through into the Angel. "She suffered greatly and did what she thought was best. Without malice or evil. You both tried to live repenting your old ways. She'd be there."
"But then, I had a callout, a case, this man. He'd lost his wife of fifty years. He was retired and had grown children. We were getting calls out to peel him off the sidewalk by the bar most nights, he was hurting, in every way possible. I felt his intentions as the months went on, until it was so clear. The clarity of his motivations were like a solar flare.
Sam frowned for a second and relaxed as Castiel deepened his look of frustration. "I really cannot fathom-"
"Great!" Keane beamed, standing as he left cash on the small tray provided. Catching Castiel's arm as he reached for his wallet, the sight of the cash prompting him to remember human manners. "It's on me. You can get it next time, but maybe somewhere without garlic bread, given it's the second date..." He winked at the Angel.
"It is, a certainly warm feeling, to be cared for in such a gentle manner. I value my station, I am hard-wearing. I'm in control, I have been in charge of uh, whole departments at the bureau. I demand respect and I enjoy it. But, sometimes, it is
Dean resolved to drink the exhaustion away, with hopes of a full day and nights sleep, to avoid any confrontations of his own feelings. He was surprised when Cas also had come to the same resolute conclusion and sank into the couch in the den beside him with a pint glass full of scotch.
Castiel's voice was deep and just a fraction rough, Dean felt lost. "I am not alone, just not taken in the sense you're asking. I think I've maybe, just been misunderstood. I can be quite, serious, so I've been told before, by friends of mine."
"What triggered this? You've controlled yourself until now, why?" Kind but determined eyes still focused on Keane.
Sam rolled his eyes and gulped at his water, the bottle crinkling in his hand, "I think you're being OTT. Y'know it is possible the guy just likes Cas, let it play out and see what we can glean from him. Let Cas practice being the bait, see it as a social lesson for him."
Dean wrapped an arm under one of Cas's, tightly holding him round the back and the other hooked around his neck, hand gripping tightly to his shoulder and resting his chin on his fingers. Ear tickling the Angel's stubbled cheek.
Sam looked at Dean's squinched eyes. Then back at the screen as the officer closed the gap and pressed a kiss on Castiel's lips.
"It's Cas, damn fool has no sense of precaution. What if our guy is putting himself in the investigation? What if he's just using Cas to get info? Or maybe, even take him out. Feds are closin' in, why not cool the heat by taking out dorky rambo?"
Before nervously heading upstairs. No intention of continuing what was already a step too far in the charade after the kiss.
"It is my understanding that breakfast is the most important meal of the day." Cas cocked his head and frowned. "By plants, the only thing I have that constitutes, is a half eaten stick of cucumber that's languishing in a cool box."
Castiel sat on his single bed, freshly showered and wafting a water park leaflet at his face and neck. Feeling the distraction of the enticing images on the garish, shiny paper. Children laughing in small geysers of water, young adults making a big splash into a pool. He swallowed dryly and considered sticking his head under the bathroom tap.
"Sure, Leonard." The formal use of the full name drew yet another pleased chuckle from Keane who pecked him on the cheek before heading to the kitchen, holding a hand up in farewell as Castiel left the house.
"I picked up on that, at the crime scene, where we met. Crap, how bad does that sound?" Keane laughed. "Though it's obvious to me, you just need some affection, someone to smooth those rough edges sometimes huh?"
"Guys! Can you just save it for when we get outta the station?" Sam relented, watching the road as they approached the building. He was dressed in his FBI suit and was flattening the tie down against his shirt.
He pulled his hand away but the Hunter caught it, pulling it back up and holding it against his own cheek. Closing his eyes, lids fluttering before stilled. Face pinched in something Cas couldn't explain.
"Well, the answer is no, you don't sound dumb or like a girl or anything like that. You come across as interesting, gentle, dark but in the sexy Darcy kind of way."
A sharp knock rapped against the back passenger window as Keane came up alongside the car, waiting patiently and looking at Dean. Both men had gasped but reclaimed their demeanour.
"I was just, surviving. I never lied, you know, when I said I'm alone here. My kind, they're...well they're gone, mostly."
"No, everytime we catch a lead, it doesn't go anywhere conclusive. If this continues then we just write up our findings and send them back to our Supervisor, they either send out more experts or we put it on the shelf and come back to it in six months."
The gunshot was loud. Castiel's ears rang as he dropped to the floor. Sam slunk down against the door, face splattered with blood and tissue, shock crippling him.
The Winchester hit the dusty floor on his front but hastily began to scramble up. Keane pulled the pistol from the back of his jeans and pointed it without hesitation at Dean.
"Because being dirt poor and starving is all made better by finding Daddy, headless in a ditch?! You're tellin' me you get nothin' out of this, just some carnivorous favour to man?" The pacing was stirring up dust, knuckles white and wrists ringing. Dean snarled viciously.
The suspect occupied a nearby farm, the impala crawled stealthily up the dirt path toward the house. He was indulging his friend but felt unnerved instantly by the lack of red and blue lights and or other official presence.
Sam." Glowering then turning to look at Cas who mirrored the same head tilt. "I don't! You're still in trouble!"
Then he glanced back down at Castiel. Prostrate on his knees, hand hovering over the body before dropping limply into his lap.
"Yeah and I also know what happens when he goes rogue, when he thinks he's doing the right thing." Clenching his jaw, Dean glimpsed a flashback from the past. "Dude walks into every bad guy cliché trap there is. He is the walking embodiment of damsel in distress."
"I've been trying hard. To please him. I rebuilt Dean from the smallest of cells, a rebirth if you will. I know him as a mother knows her own children and yet...I just can't get it right." Head bowed, Cas let his eyes droop shut momentarily. Entwining his fingers between themselves.
The car was deathly silent. The solemn rage that bubbled internally within Dean, visible in the small vapours of steam that were his micro-aggressive ticks, blindingly obvious to Sam who felt abysmal on behalf of his tortured brother.
"Any closer to catching the killer?" Keane asked. Dean and Sam sat in the impala, hunched over the receiver screen, the only light against the black sky. A thermal scanner was planted in the window of Officer Lenny Keane's living room. It was an older model Bobby had swindled off a previous FBI fling but Keane could be seen well enough, approaching the sofa with a glass outstretched to Cas who was sat on the middle cushion.
...agent stupid, swan in there all fluttery eyelashes and then hold hands with the investigating officer,
"Just Lenny's fine, but honestly you could call me whatever you want." Keane winked at Castiel as he signalled to the waiter for the bill.
Over the weeks, while they had searched for a counter curse, Jack had grown sicker, paler, weaker, and they were worried it was only going to get worse.
“Slaughterhouse Five,” he said proudly, shocking Dean into silence. He blinked slowly up at Castiel, who smiled again, a little brighter this time. “You recommended it, and you reference it frequently. I thought I might finally sit down and read it, to better understand you, and the things you enjoy.”
Sam gave him a little self-deprecating snort at that observation. “These are yours, actually. I just browned them.”
Sam, tactful as ever, clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder, seeming to come to the realization that Dean was getting a little too emotional for either of their comfort. He left quickly after that with the excuse of making dinner. With his brother gone, Dean took a deep breath and stepped into the room, letting the door shut behind him. He took a quick look through the pictures, the drawers, the closet. This was all his! Well, adult-his, anyway. He had his own bed, a place to keep his important pictures, drawers and closets to keep his clothes.
The angel was sitting grim and dissatisfied beside him in the back seat. Mary was scowling through the windshield, still rubbing at her sore throat. Though he was trying to calm down and settle into the high of a job well done, Dean still felt adrenaline pumping through his veins, his heart hammering uncomfortably against his chest as he tried not to look between the two adults in the car.
When no one answered, Dean reached up and grabbed the spare key from the porch light, easily slipping it into the lock, though it was hard to shove the door open. Looking around, Dean didn’t think the place had been touched in years. There was dirt, dust, and ash everywhere, signs of a massive fire following him around the house as he moved deeper and deeper inside.
. He may have time travelled or something, but he wasn’t a total idiot. He was more interested in… “And that’s Cas!”
“Well, a lot’s going on,” Dean started, voice jolly but eyes dancing dangerously. “A witch friend of ours seems to have botched a spell, and here we are.” Dean clapped a heavy hand on Sam’s shoulder and Sam kicked him in the leg, leaning back against the bed and shrugging off the paw on his shoulder.
He didn’t feel anything different as she apparently searched his energy, or whatever, until eventually she sighed and pulled away. His eyes flew open as she stepped back, and he watched her warily. Hopefully she had good news, but going by that sigh, he doubted it.
, are bad.” That crooked grin fell from Dean’s face, replaced with a scowl of confusion. “When you and I were stuck in Purgatory, you met a vampire named Benny. He helped us escape, and you brought him back to this world with you. He was an admirable friend, though he did not live long topside. He had been in Purgatory so long, he no longer knew what to do with himself here. He got his revenge on the man that killed his wife, and then you killed him. As a favor.” Castiel sighed, looking down at the hands clasped together in his lap. “He was a very good friend, to you
Sam started the car and Dean couldn’t help the grin that split his face; that rumble had lulled him to sleep on more than one cross-country jaunt. This car was the closest thing he had to a home, and he had missed it when Dad took it with him on his hunt.
“Here it is. Rowena should be able to use this to help Jack. It’ll work, right, Cas?” He looked up at Cas, who was reading the spell very, very carefully. After a few moments, he nodded slowly, looking hopeful for the first time that day.
Sam didn’t look convinced and Dean winced, looking away. Castiel was staring at him, too, like he was trying to read his mind. Dean shivered, moving his gaze to stare at the table instead so he didn’t have to look at anyone else.
Dean hesitated, taking a moment to order his thoughts. Where should he even begin? “Are we together?” he finally blurted out, wincing at how blunt he was being but he desperately needed to know.
,” she said, pointing at the paper, “is something I can do. You know I’m not good at sitting around and waiting.”
“Sure thing, sister. See ya around,” he told her, before turning and waving at the others he hadn’t interacted with much. He watched in silent fascination as Claire moved on to Castiel, hesitantly wrapping him up in a hug, too. He looked a little unsure of what he was supposed to do with his own arms, but finally did settle on tugging her close to his body, and she practically melted against his chest. When she pulled away, her voice was a tiny bit shakier than before.
“There’s nothing I can do here. You and Rowena can keep looking for ideas on how to help Dean, but I’m no use with magic. At least
. Why the-" Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. Shaking his head to himself and then rubbing his palm over his face. His tie getting caught over his arm.
A small vibrating sound pulsed from within Castiel's trenchcoat. He looked at the screen, Dean glancing at the Angel in the rear mirror. Cas grimaced subtly and placed the still buzzing phone, back into his pocket.
Still reeling, pulling himself from the strange headspace he'd entered on assumptions from Cas's previous statement, Sam kindly patted the Angel's shoulder. "Just, carry on Cas, Dean's just being overprotective." The indeterminate lie slipping out easily, but he knew saying what he really thought would just complicate things.
The invisible tendrils that earlier tugged, now thrust heartily into his being. Cas felt as though he was bleeding out, the rooting veins eviscerating his armour as they greedily scoured his body, desperately seeking the information within. As though a flick of a switch, the Lamia caressed his soul and began to see all of his feelings. Everything there was, even things he himself couldn't see. Memories removed by the other Angels.
The door creaked a little as he slid into the back, Dean needing no further prompting, hurriedly pulled them out and away from the small suburb.
"For the record," Dean started his voice close to the Angel's ear. "I don't think you sound dumb. You're one of the smartest guys I know...and I like your nature facts. While I'm playing nice, you should know I even tell them to Charlie sometimes, I take the credit though...you aren't mentioned."
"Castiel..." Keane sounded out slowly. He glanced at the Angel but then was straight back to Dean. "You were supposed to come alone."
Knowing full well Dean was listening Cas gritted his teeth, "Yes it is. He continually undermined me, despite my standing, my rank. Then, when he felt his sense of control slipping, he lashed out at those close to him. His self-destructive behaviour tore at my more sensitive side."
It felt plausible, "Or, maybe he came here after a tip or whatever it was that alerted him to the killer's identity and now, said killer has either murdered or taken him hostage. He didn't call it in because he was trying to avoid the bickering over the arrest and detention of the suspect, especially after I mentioned that my boss was difficult about such things. He acted out to help me, not thinking properly and his irrationality has cost him?! He is a civilian that needs saving and you're threatening his safety with your own hubris and disappointment that I could be right."
? Claire just smirked, leaning back against the sofa, spreading out like none of it ruffled her feathers. Dean knew better. He played the same act, all the time. It was exhausting, he knew.
“I suppose. All work and no play with you, Samuel. I swear,” she sighed, but she was smiling as she settled down at the table. Sam snorted and looked away, taking another book from her pile and cracking it open.
“Dean,” Sam said softly, looking heartbroken, “it’s not like that.” He looked uncomfortable, like he didn’t exactly believe what he was saying was true.
“Sit,” John ordered, pulling out a silver knife. Dean smirked at this old song and dance, when the worst thing that happened to them was shapeshifters and demons. He sat on the edge of the bed and bared his arm, Sam following suit though he looked more than a little longsuffering for doing so. After he gave each of them a cut, and nothing happened, John turned to Castiel, waving for him to roll his sleeve up, as well.
There was the sound of more moving around on her end of the call, and Dean’s mind was spinning at all of this new information. The Devil? The Darkness? What the
Stupidly, Dean felt tears prickling at his eyes and he looked away, subtly wiping at his eyes, though he was sure the angel hadn’t missed it. “You know, for what it’s worth,” he finally said, when he felt like he could speak semi-normally again, “I think I probably love you back. You’ve been nothing but kind to me since I got here. You’ve been taking care of me, listening to me rant and complain even though you didn’t have to. That means a lot.”
“Don’t be such a stranger, yeah?” she told him, and the angel nodded solemnly, smiling at her before she huffed and turned away, face burning. Dean moved to stand next to his brother, the angel a step or two away, and marveled once more at just how much taller they were than him. He felt like a little kid getting rounded up from day care. Sending one last look at the women sitting around the dining room table, Dean took a deep breath and followed his brother out the door.
Dean’s silence was thoughtful, either because he was attempting to restructure his world view, or because he was attempting to wrap his head around the fact that he had been friends with a monster, Castiel wasn’t certain. He didn’t look angry, though; that was one step in the right direction. Mary was silent in the front seat, but Castiel could tell she was burning with curiosity. Perhaps the boys had not shared this story with her, yet?
a thing,” he reminded Dean with a raised eyebrow. Dean looked away, ears red, shoving his straw in his mouth in order to keep his foot firmly out of it. They waited in slowly loosening silence, with Dean eventually calming down enough to enjoy his free drink.
After talking himself back into moving, Dean pulled himself away from the bed and started opening drawers at random, rifling through the closet, crawling under the bed to see what he could see.
Dean led them into the diner, picking a booth near the back where he could see the front door while also still looking out the window. Mary put her back to the door and let Castiel sit beside Dean.
“Besides present company?” he joked, nudging Dean’s shoulder with his own, and Dean laughed, high and bright and happy. “Yes. We have a friend named Garth; he was a hunter before he was bitten by a werewolf. He ran away and met another werewolf named Bess, who taught him how to deal with it without hurting anyone. They have three children together now. He’s very happy. And we are friends with witches, as you’ve seen, as well as the King of Hell, and a few demons, even. Well,” Castiel hedged, waving his hand back and forth, “I wouldn’t say
It was moments like these that Castiel treasured most. Dean was snoring lightly at his hip, one hand fisted in Castiel’s trench coat. Cas let his hand move through Dean’s short hair in a reverent manner, over and over, soothingly.
As they stared at each other, Sam’s phone pinged. He pulled it free from his pocket and smiled. “Cas says he’s asleep,” he said with a snort, turning his phone toward Rowena and Mary, showing them the picture Cas had sent; Dean was sprawled on the bed, Castiel next to him leaning against the headboard, and Dean had his head laying against Cas’s lap, one of Dean’s arms wrapped tightly around the angel’s waist.
“She doesn’t care about us, does she?” he asked, his dinner sinking like a stone in his stomach, making him sick.
Maybe Dad was right, and he wasn’t good for anything more than an extra body, backup, waste of space bastard that he was.
“Yeah, I guess,” he mumbled, turning to walk around the car and get in the passenger seat, instead. He noticed Castiel slide into the back seat and wondered if that was his usual spot. Did he follow them around like a guardian angel?
Dean was the first to perk up. He reached for the paper and scanned the article, eyes flying as he took in the details. “What are you thinking?” he finally asked, meeting her eyes for the first time since she had sat down.
“You, well. Younger-you should be back in a few; went out to grab dinner,” John said, turning back to the boys and their scary friend.
sixteen, but forty and grinning sleepily as he nestled just a little closer to Castiel’s hip, hand flexing where he was holding on to the angel’s jacket.
) seemed to be injured, the amount of power radiating off him was enough to leave John quaking in his boots, though he tried to control it. He looked past Castiel’s shoulders to gauge the boys’ reactions, but he was a little miffed to see Dean was just grinning, and Sam looked disinterested. As if they weren’t even a little bit terrified by that show of raw power.
he was feeling, even as he shuttered himself away, until he was staring blankly at his knees. He wouldn’t cry in front of these strangers. He
“Yeah, Bobby sent me down the road to pick stuff up for dinner, while him and Sam were cleaning the kitchen. Sam kept griping, wanted to come with, but Bobby said it didn’t hurt him to help out.” Dean was grinning wide, laughing as he recounted Bobby’s stubborn grumpiness. Castiel cracked a smile, too, easily envisioning the scene.
“You want anything to drink while you wait, kiddo?” the waitress asked, noticing how anxious and jumpy he was. Dean gave her a tight-lipped smile and shook his head, trying to calm himself down. It still felt like bugs were crawling under his skin, itching at his organs. “Why not try some lemonade, honey? On the house.”
Castiel hummed deep in his chest, raising an eyebrow at Dean, but he didn’t push. Dean liked that about him; he always let Dean think through what he was feeling without throwing any expectations on him. It was a nice change from living with Dad and Sam, who had more than enough expectations of him, often conflicting.
“May I come in?” he asked, rough voice softened as he practically whispered. Dean peeked over his shoulder, half expecting his brother to be lurking in the shadows somewhere, eavesdropping. But Dean didn’t see anyone else in the hall, and let out a sigh, nodding.
Not for the first time, Sam kicked himself for being inattentive around the boy; on their last hunt, weeks ago now, a witch had gotten the drop on them, knew they were coming even, and had prepared a spell to weaken any angels they might have with them.
Dean’s head jerked up at that, turning to trade a significant look with his brother. Through the closet door, huh? Just like when Henry had time-travelled to
Dean opened his eyes, searching Castiel’s, and sighed contentedly. “Well, ain’t that romantic?” he drawled, smirking dangerously. Cas’s eyes flashed, unspoken challenge accepted, and he reached out, yanking on Dean’s collar until they were inches apart.
Castiel’s entire demeanor was icy and closed off as he glared in her direction. “As I’ve heard Dean say before, ‘demons I get, people are crazy.’ We do not trust the British Men of Letters, because they invaded our bunker, shot Sam, tortured him, lied to us-
“At least I will not have to worry about angel wards here this time,” Castiel grumbled, and Dean rammed an elbow into his side with a
“Dean?” the woman asked, and Dean jerked away, eyes wide and face shocked for one crucial moment before he was able to get his expression under control. He gave her a cocky grin and shook his head, backing away slowly.
Growing up, Sammy had always been the more religious of the two of them. Dean had never spent much brain power on digging too deep into the mystical origins of their world. (
Dean didn’t have the time or the brainpower to unpack all of that, so instead he focused on her little wink towards Cas, who was now furiously looking anywhere but near them.
burger. Sam reached into his pocket and checked the phone, eyes going wide at the name. Dean watched him warily, then; he knew that face, and it wasn’t anything good.
, he thought callously to himself, but the way she was looking at him, he knew he must be close with her as an adult. Maybe he really
Dean threw his hands up, running a shoulder into Sam when he started laughing a little hysterically. “Are you kidding me? We haven’t been here five minutes and you already think I’ve been banging the angel? I mean, I
“How are you doing, Dean?” Castiel asked, arms folded against his chest as he watched through the window as Mary interacted with the kid behind the front desk.
“Wait,” Dean said, eyes wide and hands out, scooting back against the arm of the sofa, panicking. “Are we
Dean sighed, shoulders drooping as he finally nodded, giving her a shaky smile. The waitress smiled back, satisfied as she filled a glass with ice and lemonade before setting it in front of him. “I’m sure your daddy’s gonna love the sugar rush that’ll get you later.” She gave them both a wink and then walked away, tending to the other patrons.
“Wow,” Sam drawled unconcerned from the side lines, leaning back against the bed on his arms, taking in the scene. “Just like old times, huh, Dean?” That seemed to break the tension, and Dean reared his head back, smirking in Sam’s direction. Castiel rolled his eyes, and John slowly felt his heart rate slow, the red in his vision receding enough to realize he had just made an ass of himself, but no one was even batting an eye.
“What are you in the mood for?” Castiel rumbled, looking up and down the street for options. Dean just shrugged.
“We’re home,” he said simply. Dean nodded, leaning away until he was sitting fully upright. Mary wasn’t in the front seat anymore, but Dean could hear movement coming from the trunk.
Dean watched her go, blinking blankly after her as her words slowly sunk in. He turned on Cas with a bright red face, refusing to meet his eyes. Castiel didn’t look so ruffled by the woman’s assumption, though he did stare after her with a hint of confusion.
Whatever, he decided. Didn’t matter. He was getting the hell out of Dodge. There was a weird feeling in his gut as he drove away, like he was forgetting something important, or that there should have been more people in the cab with him. He shook his head. What a stupid thing to think. He kept driving, putting Sioux Falls far behind him, already thinking about where he could look for his next hunt.
. There are always ways to erase history and shit,” a blonde girl said scathingly, one hand rifling through a bag of chips and the other flipping the dark-haired girl off.
“Cas,” he answered, grinning into his pillow and pulling the other man a little closer. Once they were laying down face to face, Dean smirked, slow and easy. “You mean all those pretty words you said, or were you just trying to get me to get my shit together and grow up?” He raised a skeptical brow at his angel, but Castiel could hear the real question beneath his words, could see the fear growing in those beautiful green eyes, the agitation in his bright soul.
Dean still felt the tips of his ears flare red and he glanced around, hoping the waitress hadn’t heard him. He just nodded, looking at the menu with new eyes.
learn to cook?” Dean asked, bouncing over to Sam’s side and peering around him at the stove. Part of him had been half-expecting to find a smoking hunk of meat there, but it just looked like regular burgers. Plain, non-smoking burgers.
They were long gone by the time any neighboring farmers would have seen the smoke. As they drove further and further away, Dean slowly let himself relax, letting out a tense breath.
John nodded, glad that his boy had found someone in the nebulous future. “Eileen’s kickass,” Dean chimed in, punching Sam in the shoulder with his free hand. “She’s deaf, so we all learned sign language for her, too. And Jack thinks the sun shines out of her ass, it’s adorable.”
Sam sighed, his face softening as he talked to Dean like he was some scared little kid. “Dean, we know you didn’t mean to. But I’m pretty sure you- well,
As he was fighting with himself over what exactly he should do, there was a soft knock on the door. He whirled around, wide eyed, and tugged at his hair a little harder. He didn’t think he could face his mother, and he really didn’t want Sam with his big puppy dog eyes to come in staring at him. Swallowing hard, he squared his shoulders. He needed to face his problems like a man, not a scared little kid.
He was smiling in every single picture, that ever-present terror dimming and overpowering him depending on the picture.
“Self-sacrificial to a fault,” Claire explained in a stage-whisper, ducking Jody’s second playful smack. “And you’re a huge dork. You quoted
She scanned the picture, eyes flying back and forth as she hummed at the information. “This should help,” she finally said, nodding along as she began piling things up on the table. Dean hovered over Jack while they waited. Sam helped her pull together the ingredients. With Castiel’s comforting hand on his shoulder, Jack practically collapsed against his father, burying his face in Castiel’s hip.
Dean sat up, biting his lip and closing his eyes, thinking hard about the picture Claire had shown him last night. He was taller than he was now, with close cropped hair, and crow’s feet around his eyes, and muscles and a happy smile and a bit of terror in his eyes underneath everything else, and…
Jody poked her head back into the living room, shutting off the kitchen light behind herself. “Sam and Castiel should be here in the morning. They left as soon as I called.”
“Um,” he started, shifting until he was sitting up more, “hi?” The angel took a hesitant step back as Sam and Jody rounded the corner behind him. Sam froze when he caught sight of Dean, eyes wide and face slack as he tried and failed to contain his shock. Dean gave him a crooked little smile he hoped Sam recognized, waving from the couch.
Castiel didn’t even blink, just handed over a credit card that the waitress used to settle their bill. “What?” Dean hissed under his breath, trying to be quiet and struggling, “are we
fifty years old, stood behind them, shotgun raised and aimed their direction, a scowl firmly in place as he eyed them all warily.
“Jack,” Sam called eventually, waving him closer to the table. Jack reluctantly pulled himself away from Castiel’s side, letting Dean’s hand fall from his shoulder, and stood in front of Sam and Rowena, shoulders set and back straight as he surveyed the tools on the table.
"In some ways we thought we were. Men mostly, who were effected. It was quick, we left no identity of the victim, before modern science took over. Saved families the pain of living with the guilt, thinking that they didn't try hard enough to save them. You know, suicide can be a congenital prerequisite once a death occurs?" Keane's eyes were wet.
Cas stood and sardonically regarded Dean, head cocked and eyes squint, "I have studied humanity since it's existence. I have lived with it, alongside it for a decade. I can act, 'normal'."
The figures seemed to shift and Keane's voice crackled back through the speaker, bouncing round the impala. "I know it's only the second date, but, if your boss's about to turn up or pull you, I worry you could be gone before we get a chance to get to know each other. We might not get a chance to be...close, I just, if you wanted to...I wouldn't normally ask like this..."
"A desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world." Dean retorted under his breath, but relaxed back against the wall.
to let go. You see not only did you do the opposite when I asked, "keep a low profile, introduce/inquire/vamoose.""
Sam withheld the brotherly urge to place a hand on his back as he saw the two thermal, humanoid shapes stare at each other with not so much space between them.
"Why are you doing this?" Cas was gentle, like a kind therapist. As though they weren't in a standoff with a flesh eating beast who'd killed a dozen people since they'd arrived.
Cas peered over the empty stalls and large space, eyes shutting for a second before he heard Dean make the same conclusion.  The Hunter had immediately lashed out at Keane, but it seemed the younger man was quicker, kicking Dean onto the ground.
Keane wailed. A harsh shriek. Red rimmed eyes, swollen and moist stared longingly at the two men clinging on to each other. Each ready to embrace a bullet to save a life. He thought about his own beloved, thousands of years of the same fervour, passion and peace in each other's presence.
Dean stood unmoving, staring blankly as the body of Officer Leonard Keane shifted into a long, dark creature with thin leathery skin. Another three feet in length and a series of branch like arms with hundreds of whip-like tendrils all coiled around the corpse on the dusty ground. The headshot wound transferred, but Dean just grit his teeth and looked away.
"Don't take your crap out on me Dean, you're only showing your hand." Sam spoke matter-of-factly as he often found it worked to be blunt in unavoidable conversations that involved Dean's convoluted feelings.
"I like you Rowan, can I call you Rowan? Agent Serbet seems a tad official when we're discussing how cute you are."
"We need to burn him before cops get wind he's missing." Sam choked weakly, getting to his feet and looking at Keane.
Sam implored, perched against the water marked table in their stifling motel room. The double and the single the two brothers and Cas occupied were messy as the hot nights had been unbearable for all.
"-I haven't been myself no. Well, I've done, surveillance work there before. A long time ago, so I can't really speak for the culture now."
sending bambi onto the ice without a helmet." Dean glared at the floor, pointing blindly toward the Angel. Opposite Sam, leaning toward the wall.
Dean heard the shame in his voice and thought of all of Cas's great mistakes, now perhaps just impetuous desperation to cry out but without the human understanding of why and how. The magnificent pressure must of been overwhelming.
Dean grimaced, "OTT? Please Sammy, save that shit for your diary. Well, I wanna know where he's going. When he's coming back and I want a vehicle registration."
The Angel's face softened slightly. He'd been human, or whatever an Angel with no powers was, for some time. Taste had been...an adventure to say the least. Sam had pointed out, in books targeted at children; to teach them about the body and it's fascinating processes; that the palette had different sections and taste receptors and demonstrated with a selection of foods, what sour/sweet/salty etc was.
They'd spent the entire day at the precinct. The mystery killer creature managed to evade them at every turn and a more thorough look at the post mortem's of the victims hinted at the possibility of an inside job. At present they stood in the mid-afternoon heat beside the impala as Sam fetched bottled water from a nearby vending machine.
I hadn't realised until that point that it had brought up buried feelings within me. I gorged on his soul and I felt...
"You grabbed him and clung on like some huge, dumb limpet?!" Yelling, crossing the room to get to the mini fridge.
The hiss of gass escaping the cap of a beer made Cas turn as Dean took a large gulp. Wiping the back of his hand over his mouth, "You were holding hands. It was like every chick-flick moment passed over before you let go. Supposed to be on a case, not picking up dudes!" He put the bottle down on the table, a little too hard as the foamy liquid oozed up over the top.
Cas sympathised with Dean. The blunt facts were that he'd killed innocents and needed to be put down, but his own wrongdoings, the death and chaos, thought to of been for the good of heaven. The good of mankind. To be alone and amongst a nest of scurrying ants that don't see you. He felt that.
Resting his chin on his hand, elbow perched on the table as the other hand swirled his fork in his plate, Keane twinkled at Cas. "Please, I like it. You have such a, what's the right...intriguing way with words."
Aware that the other man had called him sexy. Since becoming one with the flesh that made up the image of his previous vessel, Castiel had never considered the outward effect of his appearance.
"Espionage won't prevent another stab wound. You're packing heat, not sending you in blind like that. Not when I- we can't be there. To save you."
