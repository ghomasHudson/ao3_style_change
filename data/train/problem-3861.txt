Before they could discuss it anymore there was the rumble of a car engine outside, pulling up to the motel. "Quick, hide." Dean said and ducked into the bathroom behind the shower curtain, Sam went under the table (which had a table cloth on it). There was a jingle of keys and then the door to the room opened, multiple people walked in. Sam curled up as much as he could so that he wasn't seen and Dean help perfectly still, trying not to make a sound.
Dean looked embarrassed and Cas looked away shyly "Was I really that obvious?" Cas asked quietly. "Well, you did only answer when Dean prayed to you and you always got into his personal space, you mainly risked your life for Dean, and you both were always eye fucking each other." Sammy listed. Dean chuckled awkwardly and Cas tried to hide in his trench coat. "As much as it is entertaining to watch Dean get flustered we should start heading out."Sam said. "Ya, I agree with Sam. We need to get going." Dean chimed in, wanting to get out of the embarrassing situation.
John glared at Dean "Let me go and step away, this doesn't concern you boy." John told him in a cold tone. "Not gonna happen, I'm not gonna let you near my brother." Dean told him, taking a small side step and blocking Sam from Johns view. "I can't believe you are still as immature 15 years later as you are now." John spat at him.Dean growled and quickly raised is right fist and punched John square in the face. John stumbled back and out of Deans grip while the other 3 brothers stared in stunned silence.
The Impala is speeding down the road and takes a turn sideways. "I'm telling you, Squirrel, we could have taken him." Sammy argued with his brother. "What we need is a plan. Now, they're probably keeping Dad alive, we just gotta figure out where. They're gonna wanna trade him for the gun." Squirrel told his brother. Sam just shakes his head and Squirrel glances over at him. "What?" Squirrel barked. "Dean, if that were true, why didn't Meg mention a trade Dad, he might be..." Sam started, getting upset. "Don't!" Squirrel yelled at his brother. Meg was leaning back as far as she could in the seat.
In the orchard the elders are tying the Dean's and Emily to two adjacent trees. "How many people have you killed, Sheriff? How much blood is on your hands?" past Dean asked. "We don't kill them." the sheriff said sternly. "No, but you sure cover up after. I mean, how many cars have you hidden, clothes have you buried?" Dean asked, the sheriff walks away. "Please tell me you got a plan to get out of this." past Dean asked his future self.
Squirrel sighed and glanced at Sam "Anybody ID the corpse?" he asked. Sam shook his head "Well, that's the thing. By the time the cops got there the body was gone. So cops are saying the kids were just yanking chains." "Maybe the cops are right." Squirrel said. "Maybe, but I read a couple of the kids firsthand accounts. They seemed pretty sincere." Sam said, looking at his brother. "Where'd you read these accounts?" Squirrel asked glancing at his brother."Well, I knew we were going to be passing through Texas. So, umm, last night, I surfed some local ... paranormal websites. And I found one." Sam said embarrassed.
(f)Dean sighed before yelling up the stairs to his brother "Sammy, I know you said we shouldn't change anything but I need to fix this." Max looked at (f)Dean confused. (f)Sam had heard his brother and booked it to the stairs. "Max, hey." (f)Dean said to get Max's attention back on him instead of the stairs. "That was a mistake all right? So was lying about who we were. But no more lying Max okay? Just please, just hear me out." (f)Dean said calmly. "About what?" "About how you're psychic. And about why you killed your dad and uncle. How you were about to kill your step-mom."
"We drew straws to see who would have a have a nickname. I got to keep my name, past me is Squirrel, and my brother is Sammy." Dean explain, pointing to each corresponding person as he talked. "You two could rock paper scissors to see who gets to keep their name." Sammy suggested. "Might as well. Dan't really have straws laying around." past Bobby muttered. They rock paper scissored and Past Bobby lost "Welp, by the rules me randomly made up months ago someone else gets to pick your nickname." Squirrel told them.Past Bobby sighed but nodded "Fine, but i'm only lettin' Dean pick."
"I didn't even realize it but this whole time, he was there. He was outside the garage when his Dad died, he was in the apartment when his Uncle died. These visions, this whole time -- I wasn't connecting to the Millers, I was connecting to Max! The thing is I don't get why, man. I guess -- because we're so alike?" (p)Sam said, focusing back on his brother. "What are you talking about. The dude's nothing like you." "Well. We both have psychic abilities, we both..." "Both what? Sam, Max is a monster, he's already killed two people, now he's gunning for a third." "Well, with what he went through, the beatings, to want revenge on those people? I'm sorry, man, I hate to say it, but it's not that insane."
Dean laughed and lifted himself so he was straddling Cas' hips "I'm gonna need my clothes back Angel." Cas didn't do anything, just looked to the side and avoiding Dean's eyes. "Cas."Dean said sternly. "Alright, fine." Cas grumbled. He redressed Dean and Himself. Dean Stood up and lent Cas a hand, pulling him up onto his feet. Cas grabbed both of Deans hands "Close your eyes Dean." Dean did as Cas instructed and gripped his hands tighter. Cas flew them back to the Roadhouse. "Alright, you can open your eyes now Dean." "Thanks Cas." Dean let go of one of Cas' hands but kept a firm grip on the other.
"We've met out future selves, Dean told me somewhat about you." Squirrel explained. Cas looked excited "They're here? Where are they? Where is Dean?" Cas asked in rapid fire. "We don't know. We were fighting Azazel and the room suddenly went dark and they were all gone." Sam told him. "All?" "There was a demon with them, apparently friends." John said, sounding a little bitter. "Crowley?" Cas asked confused. "They work with more then one demon!?" John yelled, a little pissed. "No," Squirrel ignored his dad "her name is Meg. You know her?" he asked. Cas nodded his head slowly "Yes, we were close before."
"Start wiping down your fingerprints, we don't want the cops to know we were here. Come on, come on!" (p)Dean said. Using his rag to open the window he looked to his brother "I'm gunna take a look inside." "I'm coming with." (f)Sam said, hoping in after his brothers counterpart. (f)Dean helps (p)Sam wipe down the railing.
A barn window swings inwards. John jumps through and disappears. The older Winchesters follow, then younger brothers. They survey the room. Vamps are sleeping in hammocks. All is quiet. John looks into the stalls. Both Sams and Deans make their way through the barn. As Squirrel passes a hammock he kicks an empty bottle on the ground. It clinks but the vampire doesn't wake. Dean cringes and holds his head in his free hand. Sammy stops and goes to his side "Dean are you okay?" he asked, keeping his voice low. "Ya, just a really bad headache." Dean tells him cringing once more.
"Look, you wanna pitch your whole 'Lord has a plan' thing? Fine. Just don't pitch it to me. My brother's dead." the man said. Ms.Miller walks into the entryway. "Roger. Please!" she says. "Excuse me." Rodger says, moving away. "I'm sorry about my brother in law. He's...he's just so upset about Jim's death. Would you like some coffee?" Ms.Miller asks the brothers. "That would be great." (f)Dean tells her.
Max shook his head "That's alright, you can stay at the motel with us and we'll grab it later today." Sam said smiling, Max smiled back. "Now let's head out, past us is probably freaking out." Dean said and started walking, Sam and Max following. Stepping downstairs and out the door the past Winchesters looked from by the impala. "What's he doing?" (p)Dean asked. "He's coming to stay with us for a bit." (f)Dean told him. "You two up front, we'll sit in the back with Max." (f)Sam said.
Young Dean looked slightly disappointed but nodded and got ready along with young Sam. The older brothers stepped outside and a little ways away from the room. "Why'd you pull us away Sammy?" Dean asked his brother. "Dean, we can't tell them about the future." Sam told his brother. "Why not? We could fix so much, stop so many bad things from happening." Dean said looking exacerbated. "Exactly Dean, which is why we can't tell them. We shouldn't mess with time, bad things happen. Remember when Balthazar un-sunk the titanic? Or when we brought dad into the future, you were wanted and I was giving speeches and loved kale."
Dean headed over to the door, Bobby close behind. When he opened the door Meg was standing on the porch "Took you long enough. I don't wanna come in but can you guys hurry up so we can get back on track? You're dad is still being help hostage by past me and gonna get possessed  by Azazel. I would love to get this show on the road." she explained. Dean nodded "That's fair, we'll be out in a bit." Dean told her. Meg nodded and headed back to the Impala, Dean shut the door.
(p)Dean looked at their doubles "You two mind being enlightening?" he asked, slightly annoyed. The future Winchesters kept quite. "Well look Sam" (p)Dean started saying to his brother "They probably don't remember this and it means nothing." he continued, trying to use their counterparts silence as helpful proof. "Actually Dean" (p)Sam said "future me does remember this, it has to be important with the way he sounded." he told his brother smugly.
Dean grabbed his phone "Go out and grab stuff front he trunk that we might need." Sam left the room with an empty duffle bag. Dean tried to call his dad, only getting voicemail. "Dad? We think we've got a serious lead on the thing that killed Mom. So, uh, this warehouse—it's 1435 West Erie. Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can." Dean hung up as Sam walked in. "Voicemail?" he asked. "Yeah." he gestured to the bags "Jesus, what'd you get?"
"Oh? This is Dean." Meg said. "You've heard of me?" Dean asked. "Oh, yeah. I've heard of you. Nice—the way you treat your brother like luggage." Dean looked confused. "Sorry." Sam cringed. "Why don't you let him do what he wants to do? Stop dragging him over God's green earth." "Meg, it's all right." the three of them look around quietly. "So what about your other two brothers? The moose and the one I haven't met yet." Meg asked Sam. "Their off visiting family, should be back in a day or to." Dean tells her.
Before anyone could say something else John noticed future Sam and Dean "Who the hell are they?" he asked pointing. "Um, well..." (p)Sam trailed. "Dad, they're future us." John looked at (p)Dean skeptically. "Do you think I'm stupid?" John asked his sons. "Dad, we're serious. They've shown plenty of proof." John still didn't look convinced. "I know how to make you believe us." (f)Dean said, raising his hand slightly.
"All right, just, uh, calm down. What's your name?" "Tessa." "Okay, good, Tessa, I'm Dean." "What's happening to me? Am - am I dead?" "That sort of depends. Where is your body?" "Oh, follow me."Tessa says, leading the way. Squirrel and Tessa stand outside a room, watching what is apparently Tessa's body, hooked up to tubes and machines.
"Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spengler? Hellhoundslair.com. You guys run that website?" Sam asked. "Yeah. You guys fans?" Ed asked. "Oh yeah, yeah, we're huge fans." Squirrel said, slight sarcasm evident in his voice. "And ahh, we know who you guys are too." Ed said. Squirrel and Sam both look at him sharply "Oh yeah?" Sam asked. "Amateurs." Squirrel immediately loses interest "Looking for ghosts and cheap thrills." "Yep." Harry said, finally looking away from the older Winchesters "So if you guys don't mind, we're trying to conduct a serious scientific investigation here." "Yeah, what have you got so far?" Squirrel asked.
Rubbing his eyes Sam asked his past self "What are you doing man, it's the middle of the night." he raises himself onto his elbows. "We have to go." (p)Sam said, still getting ready. Becoming more alert (f)Sam sits up entirely in bed. "We have to go right now." (p)Sam told his counterpart, about to leave the room. (f)Sam stood up and grabbed his past selves arm, stopping him from leaving.
"Not quite, but look at this." Sam said lifting something up, that something was a Samsung SGH-t309. "What the hell?" Dean said "Who has one of those anymore?" Dean asked looking at Sam. "Not sure, but it says it's 2005." Sam said, looking confused. Both brothers didn't understand what was going on. "What do you mean it says it's 2005?" Dean asked "Maybe it's old and has the wrong date." he tried to reason. "Or" Sam said "something went wrong when jack took chuck powers, maybe we were to close."
John looked puzzled "What do you mean I'm lucky to be alive?" "What he means is that the first time this happened Cas wasn't there to save you when you made that deal. You sold your life for mine. Dad, you died." Dean explained, voice trailing off. Cas gripped his arm reassuringly. John looked down "So I can't help?" "Dad if we weren't concerned about screwing up time we would let you help. Honest." Sammy said. "What's so wrong with messing up time a little bit?" John asked.
"Actually, we were counting on it." Squirrel said from behind her. Meg turns to look at him. Dean stares at her and then looks up at the ceiling. Meg also looks up and sees a large protective symbol etched there. "Gotcha." Future Meg said as she and Dean got up. "You're a traitor." past Meg growled at her counterpart.  "Eh, don't really care." (f)Meg said, shrugging her shoulders. "What could possibly be so great about working with these morons?" (p)Meg asked. "I bet you it was the angel." Dean said, crossing his arms.
When John, Squirrel, and Sam came back down it was obvious it hadn't gone to well. "We should get going. Max is probably wondering what happened to us." Dean said. John nodded and went outside. "Well, this is gonna be a fun trip." Dean muttered to Cas as they left the house. Bobby put his bag in the trunk "Alright, Who's sitting where?" "I'll drive. Cas can sit next to me and Thorn will also be up front. You, dad, and Sammy can sit in the back." Dean said. "Any objections?" he asked. "Why can't I dr-" "Cause you don't know where it is." Dean explained.
John continued to talk  to Sam "Your brother's right, we don't have time for this." he said, only frustrating Sam more. "Last time we saw you, you said it was too dangerous for us to be together. Now out of the blue you need our help. Now obviously something big is going down, and we wanna know what!" Sam said, yelling at the end. "Get back in the car." John said flatly, glaring at Sam. "No." Sam growled back. "I said get back in the damn car." John said raising his voice. "Yeah. And I said no." Sam barked, stepping closer.
Harry and Ed run past Dean to the other room, where Mordechai appears again. Screaming, they run to the front door but it is locked. Mordechai follows them. "Jesus Mary and Joseph." Harry says scared. "The power of Christ compels you, the power of Christ compels you. THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!!!" Ed starts yelling. "How do these guys live so long?" Dean asked his brother, Sammy just shrugs. "HEY! Come and get it you ugly son of a bitch." Sam yells.  They fight until Mordechai pins Sam against the wall, ax across his throat.
(f)Dean turned to face his brother "Really Sam? You get on my back about spoiling the future and you pull shit like that?" "I didn't mean for it to come out the way it did. It was just a natural reaction." this made (p)Sam look at his older self. "If that was your natural reaction then I am concerned." (f)Sam cringed, realizing he just made the situation worse. "Welp Sam, you seemed to have done it again." (f)Dean mocked.
Sam walks over "What?" "The first victim, the old man—he spent his whole life in Chicago, but he wasn't born here. Look where he was born." "Lawrence, Kansas." "Mmhmm." Dean picks up the second file. "Meredith, second victim—turns out she was adopted. And guess where she's from." the paper reads "Lawrence, Kansas". Sam sits down across from Dean, clearly shocked. "Holy crap." "Yeah." "I mean, it is where the demon killed Mom. That's where everything started. So, you think Meg's tied up with the demon?"
"Because" (f)Dean started telling his past self "We don't work that well on our own. If we just team up with our doubles it would basically be the same thing, we may not be alone, but we're still without our brother." both Sam's looked at (f)Dean shocked. "Okay, that's fair." (p)Dean nodded.
Scruffy pulled Squirrel into the next room and Sam followed, Thorn took the chance to talk to the older Winchesters. She pulled them off to a different room "I remember where to go. We can get a jump on Azazel and get your dad out." she told them. "What about the girl past you is possessing?" Sammy asked. "You guys already shoved me of the building right? She can't survive that." Thorn told them. Both brother look down "Hey, you can't save everyone." she told them before turning and heading towards the door. "You guys coming or are you gonna let history play out normally?"
"Alright, what do you need me to do?" Dean asked. Wanting to help his Angel. "Sit behind me but a little ways back so I don't hit you with my wings," Cas told him. Dean scooched behind Cas, keeping a foot of space between them. There was a strong rush of air had Dean close his eyes. When he opened them he saw two large black wings in front of him. Dean stared in awe at Cas' wings, lifting a hand to feel through them. Cas gasped as Dean ran his fingers through his feathers.
"Cas made a deal with a cosmic entity to save our sons life. He never told us about it though and made Jack swear not to tell us either. The deal was that when Cas was truly happy the empty would kill him." Dean took a second to get his breathe. "The reason it's my fault he died is because the only time Cas was happy was when he told me how he felt cause he realized we didn't have to be together and that just telling me how he felt would make him happy." Dean shot out quickly, words barely intelligible.
I don't no how to right gay smut or smut in general so I stared at that paragraph for literal days trying to figure out what to wright. I was waiting to make dinner and just yelled 'FUCK' real loud and angry in frustration. Finally finished though, hope you're happy :)
All the Winchesters were in a motel room. Squirrel and Dean passed out on the same bed, Sam asleep on the other and Sammy asleep at the foot of Sams bed. John was sitting at the table listening to a radio "Unit 22 let me confirm. Mile marker 41,abandoned car. You need a workup?" the dispatcher said. "Copy that. Possible 207. Better get forensics out here." another man said back. John puts down the radio, jumps to his feet and grabs his jacket. "Sam, Dean, let's go." he says as he taps them on the feet and Sammy on the head.
"Yeah, tell me about it." "I mean it. Y'know, a normal, everyday, naked-in-class, nightmare. This licence plate, it won't check out. You'll see." "It felt different Dean. Real. Like when I dreamt about our old house. And Jessica." "Yeah, that makes sense. You're dreaming about our house, your girlfriend. This guy in your dream, you ever seen him before?" "No." "No. Exactly. Why would you have premonitions about some random dude in Michigan." "I don't know." "Me neither."
Dean reached down to grab himself but Cas swatted his hand away. "No Dean." he growled lowly, a warning. Dean quickly moved his hand back to the ground in front of him. Closing his eyes an panting, focusing on Cas thrusting in and out of him. Cas' cock dragging against his prostate every thrust in. "Cas, Cas stop for a second." Cas instantly stopped moving, looking down at Dean with concern. Dean whined low in his throat from the sudden lack of stimulation "Let," he was still panting, trying to construct a coherent sentence. "Let me ride you?" he finally asked, turning his head to look back.
Squirrel and Sammy entered the music shop "Why did we have to do this?" Squirrel asked a little more sour then necessary. "Because Dean is still bitter he had to deal with the scarecrow twice and all I had to do was chill with Meg in a bus station." Sammy said. "Well why am I here instead of Sam?" Squirrel asked, turning to look at Sammy. "Because we work in pairs and unless we are going our separate ways for a bit then we go with the other version of our brother. You agreed to this." Sammy said matter of factly.
Dean is in his motel room on the computer, researching Meg and the symbol. He picks up his cell phone and dials Sams number. Sam picks up. "Hey." "Let me guess. You're lurkin' outside that poor girl's apartment, aren't you?" "No." Dean waits for another response. Sam rolls his eyes. "Yes." "You've got a funny way of showin' your affection." "Did you find anything on her or what?" "Sorry, man, she checks out. There is a Meg Masters in the Andover phone book. I even pulled up her high school photo. Now, look, why don't you go knock on her door and, uh, invite her to a poetry reading, or whatever it is you do, huh?"
The boys had arrived outside of Elkins cabin that night. The door opens slowly as Sammy puts away his lock pick, Dean has a flashlight. Sam and Squirrel right behind them. "Looks like the maid didn't come today." Squirrel said looking around at the mess. "Hey, there's salt over here. Right beside the door." Sam pointed out. "You mean protection against demon salt, or 'oops I spilled the popcorn' salt." Squirrel asked as he flipped through Elkins' journal. "It's clearly a ring. You think this guy Elkins was a player?" Sam asked. "Yep." Dean said.
Thorn growled loudly and Dean steps between her and Squirrel "Okay, lets not start fighting each other." Dean said, not wanting to get into another fight. "Okay, how can you be this okay with being on the same team as a demon?" Squirrel asked. "She's proven to be on our side. She has helped us multiple time. I've fucking told you this." dean said, fully turning to his counterpart. "If she's this willing to turn against her own kind then how do you know she won't turn on us?" Squirrel said, gesturing towards Thorn.
Looking back over to the Sams Meg asks "Were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?" "No. No. That's because I have a knife of my own." (p)Sam told her. Meg is confused. (p)Sam and (f)Dean break free from their ropes and (p)Sam grabs Meg's shoulders, then knocks his head against hers. She falls to the floor while he groans in pain. (f)Dean goes to untie his Sam.
"Dean, I don't sleep." Cas informed him. "I don't either, doesn't mean I don't want a place to wait till the hunter parade wakes up." Thorn said. "It's fine Cas. If you want you can stay in our room till we fall asleep." Dean suggested. Cas smiled at that idea "Looks like I'm getting my own room. Give me the key." Thorn smiled, holding out her hand. Dean tossed her a key, handed John the key to his and Bobby's room and TFW went to their room. "So you're back to full Angel power now Cas?" Sammy asked, putting his bag down.
"Watch your tongue boy or I'll burn you like I did your mother." Azazel growled. "I know why you killed her and you won't do the same to me." Dean told him matter of factly. "Oh do you now? Why did I kill her?" Azazel asked, crossing his arms. "She broke her deal." Dean stated. Azazel stared shocked at Dean and Alastiar blinked in confusion. "How do you know that?" Alastiar asked. "More time travel shenanigans." Dean stated simply. "How often have you time traveled?" "Well lets see, about I think, counting now." (I'm not sure, I hope that's right.)
Arriving at the bunker they all got out. "So, there is another person staying here." Sam said rubbing his neck. "Who?" Meg asked as they walked into the library. "His name is Max, he's got psychic powers." Dean said. "Wait, is he one of Azazel's kid?" she asked. "Ya, he originally died but we didn't let that happen this time." Sam said smiling.  Max walked into the library "You guys are back." Max said happily. His eyes landing on Meg "Who are you?" he asked cautiously.
"Hey, you been out to the orchard? You seen that scarecrow?" young Dean asked. "Yeah, it creeps me out." Dean laughs. "Whose is it?" "I don't know. It's just always been there." Dean interrupted the conversation, nodding towards a red van parked by the garage "That your aunt and uncle's?" young Dean looked to where he nodded to. "Customer. Had some car troubles." "It's not a couple, is it? A guy and a girl?" young Dean asked. "Mmhmm." Emily responded.
"What? Why not?" " Is that Dad?" the other person said, sounding a lot like Dean. Both brothers were very lost at this point, Sam wanted to look out and see who was talking but didn't want to be caught. "You're after it, aren't you? The thing that killed Mom." Both Sam and Dean help their breathe, remembering this conversation. "A demon? You know for sure?" " A demon? What's he saying?"..."You know where it is?"... "Let us help."... "Why not?" "Give me the phone." young Dean told young Sam. "Names? What names, Dad—talk to me, tell me what's going on."... "No. Alright? No way." "Give me the phone"
Dean opened his eyes, not remembering much after losing a but to much blood and passing out. He couldn't see very well but he had a good clue on where he was by the smell around him. Dean opened his eyes and ya, as he suspected, he was in hell. He was shackled to a wall and Sammy was shacked next to him on his left. Thorn was tied up on the other end of the room they were in. Both others still knocked out from whatever happened. Dean tried to get out of his bonds but the door opened.
"You walked away!!" John yelled in Sam's face. Dean had had enough and stepped in between them, grabbing John by the scruff of his shirt. John was taken aback but Sam ignored Dean "You're the one who said don't come back Dad, you closed that door not me. You were just pissed off that you couldn't control me anymore!" Sam yelled at John. John tried to side step Dean and get closer to Sam, not seeing Dean as a real threat. "Where the fuck do you think you're going? Step away from my brother." Dean growled, shoving John back.
" Well, they're not here right now, but what about you, Meg? I thought you were goin' to California." Dean comes up behind Sam. "Oh, I did. I came, I saw, I conquered. Oh, and I met what's-his-name, something Michael Murray at a bar." "Who?" "Oh, it doesn't matter. Anyway, the whole scene got old, so I'm living here for a while." Dean clears his throat loudly and Sam turns around. "Oh, Meg, this is my brother Dean." Sam said, turning back  to face Meg.
Squirrel smiles and starts cutting at the ropes. John moans and starts to come around. "What-what's going on?" John muttered. "Dad, are you okay?" Squirrel asks as he finishes cutting John free. "They've been drugging me. Where's the Colt?" John asked, sitting up. "Don't worry, Dad, it's safe." Sam tells him. John nods and looks over to Dean and Sammy, staring at them, they stare back. No one says anything. Thorn walks into the doorway of the room and takes one glance at John before stepping back "Something the matter?" Squirrel asks. Thorn glances at Dean and Sammy, who shake their heads, she does the same.
"You should be kissing my ass, you were dead meat, dude." "Yeah, right. Future me had a plan, We'd have gotten out." past Dean said. "Actually, my plan was to wait for Sam." Dean told his past self. "You have to be kidding me." past Dean said in disbelief. "Hah, you didn't have a plan." past Sam laughed at his brother. " they started the car and drove to a cheap motel.
"Please! Hey, hey hey hey hey." (f)Dean yelled and got there right as Rodger closed the door. "I don't want your help." Rodger told the four of them and walked away. "We're not priests, you gotta listen to us!" (f)Dean yelled after him but knew he wasn't gonna listen. "Roger, you're in danger!" (p)Sam tried. (p)Dean looked around and got the others attention "Come on. Come on come on." he said and started walking around the building.
Half way through Meg spoke up "Where's your angel?" both brothers were silent. Dean cleared his throat "Cas died." he said, staring ahead but not really at the road. Meg stared at them "You're kidding right? Even if you're not, death has never stopped that angel before." "This time, it did. He made a deal with a cosmic entity and used it to save me." Dean told her. The car went silent again and was for the rest of the ride.
"Can it kill yellow eyes?" John asked. Dean looked confused for a second before realizing what he meant "Ya, don't worry, it can kill Azazel." Dean told him. John looked confused "Who-....it has a name?" John asked shocked. "Well, all demons have names. Not to mention he's not the only demon with yellow eyes." Dean told him. "Oh really? How do you know?" Sam asked curious. "Azazel is 1 of 4 princes of hell. All the princes have yellow eyes." Sammy told his counterpart. "Look we'll explain demon hierarchy after we gank these vamps.
Dean sat up, looking around, seeing Sam to his right. They were in a motel room, with no trace of Chuck or Jack anywhere. Slowly standing back up Dean tried to get a better look around, it was a cheap motel with two beds in the room. Walking around he checked everything out, finding a bunch of their stuff, including John Winchesters journal. Dean was starting to freak out a little, where were they, where was Jack, what happened, were thoughts that kept running through Deans head.
The boys take off the fireman gear and move to the bedroom door. They slowly open it and see John on the bed. Squirrel goes over to his father. "Dad?" he leans down and listens "He's still breathing. " Sam looks relieved. Squirrel starts shaking John "Dad, wake up. Dad!" Squirrel takes out a knife and is about to cut the restraints around John's wrists. "Wait. Wait." Sam says, stalling his brother. "What?" Squirrel asks. "He could be possessed for all we know." Sam said before turning to their older selves. "Is he possessed?" Squirrel asks. The older Winchesters look at each other.
(f)Dean looks down "Should've known that was what you were gonna ask." he said before chuckling lightly, though there was no humor behind it. (f)Dean took a deep breathe before he answered "Cas is-was, my best friend. He saved my life a dozen times over." (f)Dean took a shaky breathe before continuing. "He died to save me...." there was something unsaid in the air, the other three Winchesters waited. "He....He l-" (f)Dean swallowed and (f)Sams eyes went wide.
Sam enters the motel room looking for Dean. "I have to tell you something." the brothers said at once. "Meg is summoning the Daeva." Sam said. "So, hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?" "Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing." Dean looked thoughtful. "Why would our future selves hang around her then?" he asks. "Maybe she changes." Sam shrugged. "What's the deal with that bowl again?" Dean asked, getting back on track. "She was talking into it. The way witches used to scry into crystal balls or animal entrails. She was communicating with someone."
Dean is trying to open the cellar door, but he fails. Sighing he walks back down. "I don't understand. They're gonna kill us?" Emily asked. "Sacrifice us. Which is, I don't know, classier, I guess? You really didn't know anything about this, did you?" past Dean asks. "About what? The scarecrow god? I can't believe this." "Well, you better start believing, cause We're gonna need your help." Dean said walking over. "Okay." Emily said. "Now, we can destroy the scarecrow, but we gotta find the tree." past Dean said.
"Now," Dean started, wrapping his arm around Cas' waist "I believe I owe my angel some cuddles." Cas leaned into Dean. "Yes, you do." "Alright, lets go to my room." with that both men walked out of the kitchen and down the hall, they earned their break.
Cas jumped in surprise before returning the Kiss. Wrapping his arms around Deans neck, Dens hands leaving his face and wrapping around his waist. They parted all to soon for either's liking but Dean needed to breathe. They stared into each others eyes "I missed you Cas." Dean said, voice shaky as pent up emotions came to the surface. Some tears slipping from his eyes. Cas smiled at him softly "And I have missed you so much Dean."Cas said as he swiped a few tears away with his thumb. Dean quickly pulled Cas into a hug, burying his face into Cas' neck.
Sammy was still trying to get his brother and their Meg up, they had both been knock unconscious. Sam and both Bobby's are slowly moving across the room and Meg follows them, stepping past Sammy and his brother. "We don't have it on us. We buried it." Sam told her. "Didn't I say "no more crap"? I swear – after everything I heard about you Winchesters, I got to tell you, I'm a little underwhelmed. First Johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun, and then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads. Lackluster, men. I mean, did you really think I wouldn't find you?"
Once at the motel both pairs of brothers checked into two rooms and met up in the past Winchesters room. "So" past Dean started "how long are you guys gonna be here?" "We're not sure. We don't even know how we got here none the less how to get back." Dean told his counterpart. "What was your plan then?" past Sam asked. "Not sure. " Sam shrugged. "If you don't mind we could stay with you." Dean suggested. "We can't tell you about the future but we could help with small things." "Dean, no." Sam said looking at his brother.
"Glad I could help." past Dean walks to the classroom door. When he opens it, the sheriff hits him on the head with the end of his rifle. Dean falls to the ground, and the sheriff and the professor look at future Dean. "Um, let's talk about this." Dean said taking a step back. "I know you're gonna knock me out one way or another so just go ahead." Dean said standing still. The sheriff gave him a weird look but knocked Dean out anyway.
"It was fine. Why?" Max asked, looking confused at (f)Dean. (f)Dean sighed internally 'dammit kid, why do you have to lie?' "All good memories? Do you remember anything unusual? Something involving your father and your uncle maybe?" (p)Sam asked before (f)Dean could say anything. "What do ya....why do you ask?" Max asked, shaking his head. "Just a question." "No, there was nothing. We were totally normal. Happy." (f)Dean looked at Max, it was hard not doing anything when he knew the truth.
"Oh, cut. It's just a coupla humans." a guy says, the older brothers sigh. One guy holds a small electrical gadget, the other a camera which he switches off. "What are you guys doing here?" the first guy asks. "What they hell are you doing here?" Squirrel asked him, a little forcefully. "Ah-ha-ha. We belong here, we're professionals?" the first guy continues, his partner looking to the older Winchesters. "Professional what?" Squirrel asked. "Paranormal Investigators." he hands Squirrel and Sam business cards "There you go, take a look at that, boys." "Oh you gotta be kidding me." Squirrel says exacerbate.
"You know what Sammy and I have been hunting. Hell you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself. You can't be that worried about keeping us safe." Squirrel stated. "It's not the same thing." John told him. "Then what is it? Why do you want us out of the big fight?" Squirrel asked. "This demon? It's a bad son of a bitch. I can't make the same moves if I'm worried about keeping you alive." John said, looking between both his sons. "You mean you can't be as reckless." Squirrel corrects. Dean looks to his brother in silent question if he should interject.
Dean smiled wide and looked thoughtful for a second "You're going by scruffy." Dean said, sounding very proud of himself. Scruffy groaned in annoyance "I was expecting you to be mature." He said, facepalming. "Oh, you were dead wrong." Sammy chuckled. Sam looked around for a second "Guys," he started, getting everyone's attention "where is Meg?" he asked. (trying to write this story but suddenly thinks of Jared in the wig from the finale and starts dying of laughter. "His grumpy face. Fuck, I hate the finale but that scene is so funny" XD)
I'M SORRY THAT IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO MONTHS!!!! Please take this chapter as an apology. I hope you like it, I needed to update the tags because of it. ENJOY (the next chapter will come out sooner P-P
"Come on, let's go." Dean said. The Sam's, Dean's, and Emily start running. They hear a noise and turn around, but the scarecrow and its victims have disappeared. The three of them stay there and look around.
"Huh, vampires. Get's funnier every time I hear it." Squirrel said, still half asleep. Dean had grabbed his jacket and left right behind John, Sammy not to far behind. Sammy yawned and stretched, trying to wake up more and saw Dean walking over to John. "Do you two need something?" John asked, a little more harsher then expected. Dean stared at him for a few seconds, taken aback "Okay, chill, I'm not here to punch you or anything." Dean said raising his hands slightly. "Look, I don't 100% believe that you're my sons from the future. I thought my boys would know better honestly." John said.
They left the building and got into the impala. Driving to the motel (f)Dean was leaning against a car and talking to (p)Sam. (f)Sam got out of the impala and headed towards his brother, (p)Dean behind him. "Ready to go?" (f)Dean asked his brother. "Yep." (f)Sam said smiling. "Please tell me you'll come back before anyone dies." (p)Sam said, looking at their future counterparts. "We'll be back before you know it." (f)Dean reassured him.
Max gestures to the lounge and they all take seats. There is a moments silence, then (p)Sam sighs. "How you holding up?" (p)Sam asks softly. "Okay." Max tells him. "You're dad and your uncle were close?" (f)Dean asked. "Yeah I guess. I mean, they were brothers. They used to hang out all the time when I was little." Max said looking over to (f)Dean. "But not lately much?" "No, it's not that. It's just....we used to be neighbors when I was a kid, and we lived across town in this house. Uncle Roger lived next door, so he was over all the time." "Right. So how was it in that house when you were a kid?"
(p)Sam shakes his head and sighs "So what do you think killed him?" "Maybe the guy just killed himself? Maybe there's nothing supernatural going on at all." (p)Sam looks and their future selves and shakes his head " I'm telling you, I watched it happen. He was murdered by something Dean. I watched it trap him in the garage." "What was it, a spirit, poltergeist, what?" "I don't know what it was. I don't know why I'm having these dreams, I don't know what the hell is happening Dean." (p)Sam told his brother getting slightly worked up.
"Oh, John, I'm offended. Don't you trust me?" Azazel says, faking sounding hurt. John shakes his head slowly "Fine." "So we have a deal?" John asked. "No. You do not." a deep gravely voice said from behind them. Azazel looks around John to see a man with messy short black hair, striking blue eyes, a black suit and blue tie on backwards, and he was topped off with a beige trench coat. "Who are you? You're certainly not human." Azazel says, looking confused.
"Nope, and future you isn't either." Sam said. "Well, you'll figure out what it is, you can figure out a way to kill it." Sam said smiling. "I know. We're actually on my way to a local community college. We've got an appointment with a professor. You know, since I don't have my trusty sidekick geek boy to do all the research and future me won't say shit." Sam laughs. "You know, if you're hinting you need our help, just ask." "I'm not hinting anything. Actually, uh—I want you to know....I mean, don't think...." "Yeah. I'm sorry, too. We both are." Sam said, looking at his past self.
In the lounge room (f)Dean is on the lounge, (p)Sam in an armchair. Ms.Miller pours coffee and hands it around. "It was wonderful of you to stop by. The support of the church means so much right now." Ms.Miller said. (f)Dean inwardly cringed from what he was about to say "Of course. After all we are all God's children." he told her, trying to keep his voice calm and even. (p)Sam noticed but didn't ask, just noted it away for later.
He and Bobby headed back to the others. "What did we miss?" Dean asked. " This is some serious crap you boys stepped in." Scruffy (I'm having a hard time taking this name seriously) told him. "Oh man, you have no idea." Dean sighed out with a chuckle. "Over the course of 15 years we've dealt with way worse then one measly Prince of Hell." Sammy piped in. Scruffy looked at the two confused. "Demon hierarchy, ya got Satan, then Lilith, then the four princes, the nights of Hell, and the list goes on." Dean rambled. Scruffy looked more confused.
John's truck travels down the road. Kate sluggishly opens and closes her eyes in the passenger seat. After a moment headlights shine in the rear-view mirror. Two cars approach John's truck quickly from behind. John looks in the rear-view mirror, but the cars have disappeared. John has to stop when the road is blocked ahead of him by Luther, three other vamps, and two cars. "Get out! Who are you?"  Luther asked? " Name's Winchester." John told him. " Where are your friends?" "Cleaning out your nest." Luther smiles tightly. "Where's Kate?"
"I just wanted to stretch my wings. It's been so long since I've had them." Cas explained. Dean smiled and nodded in understanding. "Here," Cas grabbed Dean's hand "let me show you what I found." Dean shifted nervously, still not a fan of any type of flying. Cas could tell Dean was nervous and gently wrapped his other hand around Dean's waist. "Dean, close your eyes and hold onto me," Cas said quietly. Dean took a deep breath and grabbed onto Cas' trench coat; closing his eyes.
"Alright Cas, time to get up," Dean said. Cas groaned in disagreement and nuzzled his face into Dean's chest, not getting up. "Cas, you have to get up. I have to pack." Dean chuckled. Cas glared and sat up, straddling Dean's chest. Suddenly Dean's bag was next to his bed, fully packed. "No, you don't." Cas huffed. Dean laughed and sat up, causing Cas to slide down into his lap "Alright Cas, what do you want to do?" Dean asked, wrapping his arms around Cas' lower back. "I want you to cuddle me assbutt," Cas grumbled, wrapping his arms around Dean.
Still reeling from the shock of seeing his unconscious body, Squirrel turns, relieved, as Sam enters. Sam stops at the door and stares at his brother's body, breathing heavily. "Sammy! You look good. Considering." Squirrel said. "Oh, no." Sam said worriedly. "Man, tell me you can hear me. How's dad? Is he okay? Come on, you're the psychic. Give me some ghost whispering or something!" a doctor entered the room. "Your father's awake. You can go see him if you like." "Thank god." Squirrel said relieved. "Doc, what about my brother?" Sam asked.
"I'm, um, sorry about your dog." Meg muttered to Bobby. Meg got flung back as her counterpart busted open the door and stepped in. Meg had been flung into Dean and they both fell onto the floor. As past Meg stepped in Squirrel comes at her, unscrewing the flask, but Meg hits him and sends him flying into a stack of books. He appears to be knocked out. Sam steps in front of Bobby and Scruffy, placing himself between them and Meg. "I want the Colt, Sam – the real Colt – right now." she told him glaring.
"Good. That's good. Well you must be exhausted. We should take off." (p)Sam said while standing. "Yeah." Max said. Max walks the to the door and they leave. "(p)Sam and (f)Dean walk down the drive to stand beside the Impala "No one's family is totally normal and happy. See when he was talking about his old house?" (p)Sam asked his brother. "Yeah Max isn't telling us everything." (f)Dean said before getting in the car, (p)Sam following suit.
"We're just trying to get a book and movie deal, okay?"Ed told them. From the basement comes the sound of knives being sharpened. The Winchesters are immediately back on alert. "Oh crap." Ed whispered. Ed and Harry crowd in close behind the brothers with their camera. "Ah guys, you wanna ... you wanna open that door for us?" Ed asked. "Why don't you?" dean asked, turning back to look at Ed. Mordechai bursts through the door holding an axe and screaming. Squirrel and Sam empty their gun chambers. He holds on, then wavers and disappears into mist.
Squirrel takes the Colt and tucks it into the back of his jeans. "What are you doing Squirrel?" Sam asked. Squirrel grabs his duffel bag "We got to go." "Why?" "Because the demon knows we're in Salvation, all right. It knows we got the Colt. It's got Dad – it's probably coming for us next." Squirrel told his brother while putting on his jacket. "Good. We've still got three bullets left. Let it come." "Listen, tough guy, we're not ready, okay? We don't know how many of them are out there. Now, we're no good to anybody dead. We're leaving.... now!"
"Dad, it was a trap. I didn't know, I'm sorry." (p)Dean apologized to John. "It's all right. I thought it might've been." "Were you there?" (p)Dean asked. "Yeah, I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive. She was the bad guy, right?" "Yes, sir." The younger Winchesters said at once. "Good. Well, it doesn't surprise me. It's tried to stop me before." "The demon has?" (p)Sam asked. "It knows I'm close. It knows I'm gonna kill it. Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell—actually kill it." "How?" (p)Dean asked, John smiles. "I'm workin' on that."
Bobby uncrossed his arms, seeing where this was going "Please tell me Crowley didn't," "Ya, he did. Sacrificed himself to save us." Dean finished. Bobby sighed and looked at the ground "Son of a bitch." Bobby muttered. "Sorry Bobby." Dean said. Bobby took a deep breathe and looked at Dean "Not your fault that idjit was always getting himself into deadly situations." Bobby said. Bobby pulled Dean into a hug "Right now I'm just glad you're alright." Dean hugged back. They broke apart after a knock on the door. "That's probably Meg. I don't think she was to hyped to head into a hunters house."
The other three nodded "Can the Dean's share a room and me and my future self share a room?" "I actually second this." Sam said. "I'm not that bad of a roommate." both Dean's said at once. Each Sam gave their respective brother their signature bitch face. "Alright" both Deans said "the doubles will share a room." Dean said and his past self nodded. "We call this room." past Dean said.
"I mean, you say Meg is your daughter and you call Lucifer dad but Meg also called him her father but if she was your daughter that would make Lucifer her Grandfather." Dean rambled. Thorn face palmed and Azazel stared at him. Sammy gave his brother an 'are you serous' face. "It's a legit question." Dean shrugged. Azazel shook his head and turned away from Dean "I wanna know why. Why’d you do it?" Sam asked. Azazel turns to Sam "You mean why did I kill Mommy and pretty, little Jess?" he mocking asked.
Sam chuckled. "I ransacked that trunk. Holy water, every weapon that I could think of, exorcism rituals from about a half dozen religions. I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything." Dean nods, and they begin loading their guns silently. A few minutes later there was a knock at the door. Dean got up to answer "Hey, welcome back guys." he greeted the future Winchesters. "Here for the Meg and demon situation?" (p)Sam asked. "How'd you guess?" (f)Dean asked back.
Dean took a breathe "You need to go to the bunker." "For how long?" John asked, crossing his arms. "A while. Basically you have to live there." Dean continued. John growled "I will do no such thing. I need to find the Demon!" he yelled, taking a step forward. Dean cringed, he knew this was gonna happen. "Well that's to bad cause you can't." Sammy said, glaring. "You don't get to tell me what to do boy." John said darkly. Bobby came over and stepped directly in front of John "Listen here, you are lucky to even be alive right now. We are trying not to absolutely fuck up time so you can't help." Bobby told him sternly.
"Yes ma'ma." Sammy and Dean said at the same time. Cas chuckled and shook his head. The group walked out of the Roadhouse and all stood by the Impala. "So how's the car situation gonna work?" Squirrel asked. "You guys can take Baby. Cas can fly me and Sammy back to the bunker." Dean said. "Right. I keep forgetting the tax accountant in a trench coat  is an angel, with wings." Squirrel said. "We'll see you guys later." Sammy said, waving to their counterparts at Cas grabbed him and Dean.
She gestured vaguely behind herself " Actually, our son Max, he was the one who found him." (p)Sam looks through the doors into the dining room and sees Max sitting in the corner, staring into space. "Do you mind if maybe, I go talk to him?" (p)Sam asked. "Oh thank you Father." Ms.Miller says to (p)Sam as he walks over to Max.
John crossed his arms "Fine, give me proof." (f)Dean smiled. "The demon your hunting? His name is Azazel," "He's one of four princes of hell." (f)Sam chimed in. Johns arms feel to his side and he stared at them. "Also, you do have a plan for killing Azazel." (f)Dean said. "I don't know what-" "The colt." (f)Dean said in a matter of fact tone. John was quiet for a bit before taking a deep breathe "Alright, I believe you. But what are you doing here?" John asked.
he Impala is parked outside a cabin in the woods. Inside Sam is pouring salt along the window sill. His face is a mess – bruised, bloody, and swollen. Dean, Sammy and Thorn are talking quietly by the far wall. Squirrel comes into the room. "How is he?" Sam asks. "He just needed a little rest, that's all. How are you?"  "I'll survive." Sam turns to his brother. "Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?" "I don't know. I don't think so. I mean, we couldn't have found a more out-of-the-way place to hole up."
"Mm-hmm." Squirrel says although still asleep. Sam half sits up, Squirrel starts rubbing his eyes. Dean had sat up instantly upon John tapping him and Sammy grumbled but stood up. "I picked up a police call." John told them. "What happened?" Sam asked. "A couple called 911, found a body in the street. Cops got there everyone was missing. It's the vampires." John said. "How do you know?" Sam asked rising from his bed. "Just follow me, okay?" John told them as he left. Sam walks across the room, putting his jacket on.
Squirrel looked to his brother skeptically "And what's it called?" "HellHoundsLair.com" "Lemme guess, streaming live out of Mom's basement." Sam grins. "Yeah, probably." "Yeah. Most of those websites wouldn't know a ghost if it bit 'em in the persqueeter." Sam sighed. "Look. We let Dad take off. Which was a mistake, by the way. And now we don't know where the hell he is, so meantime we gotta find ourselves something to hunt. There's no harm checking this thing out." "All right." Squirrel says resigned "So where do we find these kids?" "Same place you always find kids in a town like this." Sam said.
Humming quietly and snuggling his head into Dean's neck Cas smiled widely. "Want me to finish oiling up your wings?" Dean asked, moving Cas back a little. "That would be desirable, yes." Cas chuckled. "Alright, then sit back down," Dean instructed. Cas did as told and stretched his wings out. Dean quickly but carefully found Cas' oil glands and started applying it to the whole wing. Cas kept exceptionally quiet, but his whole body was shaking by the time Dean was done with one wing. "Cas, you good?" Dean asked, slightly concerned that he'd hurt his Angel.
Sam enters Squirrel's room quietly, clutching a brown paper bag in his arms. "Hey. I think maybe you're around. And if you are, don't make fun of me for this, but um, well, there's one way we can talk." Sam said into the seemingly empty room. He pulls out a box labeled "Mystical Talking Board". Squirrel is now behind him., arms folded "Oh, you gotta be kidding me." he said in disbelief. Sam circles around the bed and sits cross legged on the floor. He opens the box and pulls out the board. "Dean? Dean, are you here?" "God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party."
I won't be doing every single episode because that would take forever and I want to do this till season 5.  (p)=past   (f)=future
"Hey dad?" Squirrel asks, getting Johns attention. John turn to Squirrel and Hm's "I'm sorry." Squirrel says. "For what?" "Using a bullet." "You did good." "You're not mad?" "Mad? I'm proud of you. You know, Sam and I, we can get pretty obsessed. But you – you watch out for this family. You always have." Squirrel smiles, slightly surprised "Thanks." John pats him on the shoulder. The wind suddenly picks up and the lights start to flicker. They all go over to the window. "It found us. It's here." John muttered. Dean and Sammy exchange looks and Thorn gives John a deadpan look.
Squirrel started to walk off "Where are you going?" Tessa asked. "Just wait here." Squirrel told her. He runs down the hallway to another room in crisis. The same spirit is hovering over a little girl, who is being resuscitated. It reaches a hand into her face. "Get away from her!" Squirrel yelled. He lunges at the spirit, which vanishes. The nurses stop resuscitation. "All right, let's call it." "Time of death, five eleven p.m." "At least she's not suffering anymore." Squirrel is stunned.
The brothers were at a trailer park, going to talk to Ed and Harry. Dean pounded on Ed and Harry's trailer door, hearing some yelp in surprise inside. "Come on out here guys, we hear you in there." Squirrel said. Ed and Harry stick their heads out the door "Ah, would you look at that! Action figures in their original packaging -- what a shock." Squirrel said sarcastically.  "Guys, we need to talk." Dean said. "Yeah, um, sorry guys. We're ahhh, a little bit busy right now." Ed told them.
A woman stands on the front step of the house, crying and leaning against a middle aged man. A young man stands behind them, looking distraught. (p)Sam watches, grimacing, then turns to walk away. The other three notice and follow him back, (p)Dean leaning against the Impala's bonnet. "Sam we got here as fast we we could." (f)Dean said. "Not fast enough. If we hadn't have stopped to argue we might have made it." both future brothers shook their heads.
"I'll update sooner" WELL THAT WAS A FUCKING LIE. I t took me nearly a month to update again, I am sorry BUT you guys will LOVE the next chapter
"If there's one thing I am good at it's breaking the rules. The Winchesters do it quite often." Cas tells her. Squirrel looks at Cas "You're Cas aren't you. You're my Angel." Squirrel stated, shocked. Cas blushed a little and nodded. "You're not aloud to do this. It's his time!" Tessa yelled as Cas walked closer to Squirrel. "Dean Winchesters time is not for a long time." Cas said as he touched Squirrels shoulder, sending him back to his body. Cas looked to Tessa "They are now under my protection. Tell death I said hi." with that Cas disappeared.
Their at a Bus Stop. Emily is getting on a bus to Boston. She smiles at past Dean, who waves to her. She waves back and takes a seat. Past Dean and Sam watch the bus leave. "Think she's gonna be alright?" "I hope so." "And the rest of the townspeople, they'll just get away with it?" "Well, what'll happen to the town will have to be punishment enough." Dean said as all four started walking to the car. "So, can we drop you off somewhere?" past Dean asked both versions of his brother. "No, I think you're stuck with us." past Sam says as they hop in the car.
On the interstate the sheriff's car is following Dean's car to make sure they leave. When they are gone the sheriff turns around and drives back to Burkittsville.
Meg turns around to face them as Both Sams and Deans stood up from behind the crates. "Sam, I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship." Meg paused for a second "I am of course, talking to past Sam." the younger Winchesters were surprised. "How-" (p)Sam started but was interrupted by Meg. "He told me, first day we met. You were asleep." (f)Dean glared at his brother. "And I'm in the wrong for saying we know Meg." he muttered to (f)Sam quietly.
"Just a little friendly conversation." Dean said as Scotty walks away. "Oh, and that coffee, too, man. Thanks." Scotty looks agitated. Dean keeps talking to the couple. "So, what brings you to town?" Dean asked. "We just stopped for gas. And, uh, the guy at the gas station saved our lives." the women says. "Is that right?" younger Dean asked. "Yeah, one of our brake lines was leaking. We had no idea. He was fixing it for us." said the man. "Nice people." young Dean said, slightly concerned.
Dean ended up yelling at the end of his explanation. The car was silent for a bit, Dean seemed to constantly have that effect. "You, consider me part of your family?" Thorn asked, sounding confused. "You've more then proved yourself a friend Meg, even is you don't think so." Dean told her. "Now, I don't want a word out of anyone for the rest of the trip. And squirrel, if you say anything about Thorn being a demon again I will pull ditch you at the nearest motel." Dean said, glaring at his counterpart through the rear-view mirror.
"Look, I don't want to believe it any more than you. But if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing. We still have the Colt. We can still finish the job." Sam reasoned with his brother. "Screw the job, Sam!" Squirrel yelled at his brother. "Dean, I'm just trying to do what he would want. He would want us to keep going." Sam said. 'Quit talking about him like he's dead already. Listen to me, everything stops until we get him back, you understand me? Everything." Squirrel said.
Cas grabbed Deans hips and started moving him on his own. Deans head rolled back, letting Castiel use him for his own pleasure. "Cas, Cas, Castiel!" Dean yelled loudly as he came across both their chests. As Dean's channel tightened around him Cas was brought to his second orgasm. His wings spasming in pleasure, and his eyes glowing behind his eyelids. Dean collapsed onto Cas, spent. Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean and cleaned them with a thought. "That, was amazing." Dean chuckled into Cas' chest. Cas nodded and wrapped his wings around the hunter, nuzzling into his hair.
"Yes sir." Sam and Squirrel say in unison. *Theme music starts* Sam, Squirrel, and John look over to see Dean holding up his phone "Is that really necessary?" Sam asked. "Of course. Everyone needs theme music." Dean tells him smiling. Sammy walks over and takes the phone before turning of the music "Hey!" Dean yells, abandoning his burger on the table to get up and chase Sammy around the room. Sammy laughs and Squirrel runs to help his counterpart while Sam tries to hold him back. John smiles and laughs along.
Dean chuckled and laid back down and rolled onto his side, taking Cas with him. Cas hummed happily and nuzzled his face into Dean's neck. Dean went back to petting Cas' hair and picked up his phone. He set a timer to go off 10 minutes before they were supposed to leave. "Cas, when the timer goes off you have to get up," Dean told him. "Fine," Cas replied voice muffled in Dean's neck. Dean yawned 'Maybe I can get some sleep before we go' he thought. Closing his eyes Dean drifted off.
"So, what do they look like?" Sam asked. "Well, nobody knows, but nobody's seen 'em for a couple of millennia. I mean, summoning a demon that ancient? Someone really knows their stuff. I think we've got a major player in town. Now, why don't you go give that girl a private strip-o-gram?" Dean said with a smirk. "Dean, future you said that doesn't happen." Sam reprimanded. "He could have been lying." Dean said shrugging. "Why would he lie about that? He's you." "Fair point."
"Nope but I'm not surprised." he said after a few seconds. Dean laughed and John walked over "What are you two talking about?" he asked. "Vampires." Dean said smiling. Sammy nudged Dean with his elbow and walked of, Dean following close behind. John watched them walk of in confusion "What is going on with those two?" he muttered to himself. John walked back to his truck, he could question them more later. Dean and Sammy caught up with their counterparts and Dean slid into the drivers seat. Squirrel got in next to him and both Sams hopped in the back.
"Please. Let us go." Emily pleaded. "It'll be over quickly, I promise." Harley said. "Please." Emily said again, hoping her uncle would let them go. "Emily, you have to let him take you. You have to—" all of a sudden, the scarecrow sticks his sickle through Harley's stomach. Emily and Stacy scream, then Stacy is captured by the scarecrow, too. Emily runs into past Dean's arms while her aunt and uncle are dragged away by the scarecrow. The rest of the townspeople run away in fright.
Cas shuttered and started grinding against Dean. Both men were moaning, rubbing against each other. Dean threw his head back in pleasure. Cas leaned down and started Kissing and biting Dean's neck. "Cas. Cas please." Dean moaned. Cas let go of Dean's wrist and slid himself down Dean's body. Cas settled between Dean's legs and brought them over his shoulders. He kissed Dean's dick through his jeans, making the human whine. "Angel, please don't tease. Not right now." Dean begged. Cas hummed thoughtfully before looking up at Dean "I won't tease you now but I will make it 10x worse next time." Cas said.
(p)Sam went back to talking on the phone "Yes I'm here."......"Jim Miller. Saginaw, Michigan. You have a street address? Got it. Thanks." "Checks out. How far are we?" (p)Sam asks, hanging up the phone. "From Saginaw? Coupla hours." "Drive faster."
Both Dean's grabbed a gun before leaving the car and all four Winchesters headed to the house. They burst through the door, (f)Dean and (p)Sam heading to the kitchen. "Fathers?" Ms. Miller said. "What are you doing here?" Max asked. "Aahh, sorry to interrupt. Max, can we, uh, can we talk to you outside for just one second?" (f)Dean asked. "Why?" Max said, getting suspicious. "It's....it's private. I wouldn't want to bother your mother with it." (p)Sam told him. "We won't be long at all though, I promise." (f)Dean tell Ms. Miller.
"Wait...wait."Ed continued, the brothers just kept walking. "What thing about Mordechai you guys?" Harry asked. "Don't tell 'em Sam." squirrel said to his brother. "But if they agree to shut the website down Squirrel." Sam said. "They're not going to do it, you said so yourself." Dean said, looking at Sam as they all stopped walking. "No wait. Wait. Don't listen to him okay? We'll do it. We'll do it." Ed said, stepping in front of Sam. "It's a secret Sam." squirrel said, ignoring Ed. Sammy looked to Ed and Harry and seemed contemplative. Sammy sighed and Ed and Harry turned to look at him.
Sammy nodded and left. "Well, I don't know about you but I'm gonna watch some t.v. Dean said, patting Cas' shoulder and going to his bed. Cas stood in the middle of the room awkwardly, looking around. Dean chuckled and patted the spot next to himself on the bed. Cas smiled thankfully and went to sit down next to Dean. Dean grabbed Cas' hand as he flips though the channels on the t.v. He turns on some show, neither properly paying attention. Cas scoots closer to Dean, snugging up to his side and laying his head on Deans shoulder.
When the light fades she can see that it's Cas "Clarence, you're alive. Tweedle dumb and dumber said you had died." Thorn smiled. "Cas smiled back "They weren't lying. I had died again but like before I came back." he told her. Cas melts Thorns chains and catches her when she falls forward. Cas flaps his wings and brings her back to earth and quickly going back down. Thorn stands and goes over to the others to see Sammy on the ground. She holds out a hand and Help Sammy up "What happened? I passed out." "Clarence is back." she says.
Dean gripped onto him and cried into his shoulder. John rested his chin on Deans head and rubbed his shoulder. He looked over at Sammy who was still staring before he turned his head town and hiding his face in Deans hair. Closing his eyes he hugged Dean a little tight and waited patiently for him to calm down. When Dean did calm down John didn't let him go. They all sat in silence for a bit before John finally spoke "I, am so sorry Dean. I never wanted anything like that to happen to you boys." he apologized.
"He is, this is how Azazel got into him." Sammy whispers. "We have no way of getting him out though." Dean says. "We could try an exorcism." Sammy suggests. "Can't, not with Thorn nearby." Dean reasons. "They what are we gonna do> We con't lie to them." Sammy says, side glancing their counterparts. "We can actually, it'd just be wrong and they might never trust us again." Dean responds. Sammy gives his brother a deadpan look before sighing "Alright, but I have a bad feeling." Sammy says before they turn back to their younger selves "No, he's good."
Monitors are beeping, a doctor and some nurses are surrounding Squirrel, resuscitating him. "All clear." Sam was huddling in the doorway, tears in his eyes "No." "Still no pulse." "Okay, let's go again, 360." "Charging." Sam is in the doorway, crying and fidgeting; Squirrel comes slowly behind him. He sees a ghostly figure floating over the body lying in the bed. "You get the hell away from me." Squirrel growls. He runs to the bed and faces the thing down, yelling. "I said get back!" Sam blinks, looks confused, as if he's heard something.
Squirrel took a second to process what Dean had said, barely able to understand his last sentence. He blinked a couple times while Squirrel caught his breathe and finally said something. "So, you're telling me that we made Cas happy. And that he liked us, in that way. That because he told us how he felt he died. And that he hadn't been truly happy until then." Squirrel said dumbfounded. Dean nodded "Ya, that's the gist of it." Squirrel ran his hands through his hair. "You can ask more later. Didn't you say we have to get to Colorado?" Dean asked. Squirrel nodded and they headed back to the impala.
He rises slightly, turns towards the cops and cups a hand to his mouth "Who ya gonna call!" he shouted, catching Ed and Harry's by surprise. "Wha...huh?" "Hey! You!" a cop shouts. There is a muddled mixture of voices "Freeze. Run! Come on! Get back here. Hey!"  the cops chase Ed and Harry back down the path. Laughing, SAM and DEAN make a break for the house. Once inside Sam breaks out the rifles, handing one to Squirrel. Squirrel turns on a flashlight "Where have I seen that symbol before? It's killing me!" he said, slightly frustrated.
Dean sighed as he put his bag down in his room, face planting onto his bed. Cas chuckled and laid down next to him "Chuck I need a nap." Dean groaned. "You're father is still waiting for you to tell him how you found the Bunker," Cas informed him. "Oh, Cas, come on, it was a long drive even with the break. I need my 4 hours." Dean said, rolling over and looking at Cas. Cas sighed and rolled his eyes "I'll inform Sam you are not having that conversation tonight." he told Dean.
(f)Sam grabbed the tape he was already looking for and handed it to (p)Dean. (p)Dean uses the masking tape to connect each pool of blood. When he is done, the pieces of tape form an unusual symbol. "Ever see that symbol before?" (f)Sam asked. "Never. Mind helping us out with research?" (p)Dean asked hopefully. "Sorry, not on this one." (f)Sam told him, giving a sympathetic look. "We're gonna go check on Max. We've left him alone for about a week now and we want to check in." (f)Sam said. "So we're on our own again. How long will you be gone?" (p)Dean asked. "Not to long, I promise."
Cas hand wanted to get up for a while but couldn't move without waking up Dean. He knows from experience that that is not a wise idea. Dean's body stiffened as he stretched. He moaned happily and Kissed Cas' neck "Mornin' sunshine." Dean said. "Good morning Dean." Cas hummed. Dean let Cas go and sat up, allowing Cas to move. "I'm going to get some coffee, See you in the kitchen?" Cas nodded. Dean changed his shirt, grabbed a new flannel, and left the room. Cas grabbed his trench coat off the chair and followed after Dean. In the kitchen, all 3 Winchesters were drinking coffee and Bobby was sitting at the table.
Dean got on the mans back and Thorn was soon by his side, trying to get him off of Sam. Thorn gets up and takes a few steps back before charging at the man, effectively getting him off of Sam. Unfortunately now he was fighting Thorn instead. Dean helped Sam sit up and made sure he was okay. Sammy brings John over and Sammy nods at his brother before Dean rushes over to go help Thorn. Thorn has managed to land a few blows on the guy and he's bleed intensely from the chest.
Dean smiled "Ya, Cas is my angel." Dean said, a stupid grin on his face. "What's so funny?" John asked. Dean shook hos head and started to get up "I'll ride with you and explain a few things." Dean told him. Both John and Sammy got up, Sammy slightly glaring at his brother "Dean, you can't go telling him about the future." Sammy sighed. "And why not?" Dean asked. Sammy opened his mouth before thinking about it and he sighed. "Alright, fine, but please keep it vague." Sammy said before turning and walking back to the impala. Dean and John heading to Johns truck.
"I suppose." the professor said. Dean started reading this rime "This particular Vanir that's energy sprung from the sacred tree?" "Well, Pagans believed all sorts of things were infused with magic." "So what would happen if the sacred tree was torched? You think it'd kill the god?" past Dean asked. The professor laughed "Son, these are just legends we're discussing." "Oh, of course. Yeah, you're right. Listen, thank you very much." past Dean said, shaking the professor's hand.
Cas gave him a leveled look before whacking him with one of his wings. Dean fell back from the force and started laughing. Cas huffed and started to stand up. Dean stopped laughing and quickly sat up. Grabbing Cas' waist and pulling him into his lap. It was a little difficult to keep Cas in his lap, his wings awkwardly pressing between them. Cas was trying to use his wings to push away and off of Dean. "Oh come on Angel. Don't be like that. It was a joke." Dean soothed. Cas didn't seem to want to listen so Dean tried using nicknames.
"Turn around Dean." young Sam said, looking annoyed. "What? Why?" "Because we need to go to California." young Sam said, leaning into the front seat. "Dad called from a payphone. Sacramento area code." he told his brother. "Sam." young Dean said" "Dean, if this demon killed Mom and Jess, and Dad's closing in, we've gotta be there. We've gotta help." "Dad doesn't want our help." "I don't care." "He's given us an order." "I don't care. We don't always have to do what he says. Please tell me you're with me on this." young Sam said, looking at their older selves. The older brothers looked uncomfortable ans just looked out the windows.
"This is the second week of April." "Yep." young Sam looked at the older versions of him and his brother, trying to see what they were thinking. "So, Dad is sending us to Indiana to go hunting for something before another couple vanishes?" young Sam asked his brother, looking away from their older counterparts. "Yahtzee. Can you imagine putting together a pattern like this? All the different obits Dad had to go through? The man's a master." older Dean cringed slightly while older Sam rolled his eyes.
(f)Dean and (p)Sam turn for the door, Max follows. As (f)Dean grasps the doorknob he turns back to smile at Max. Max sees the butt of the pistol in (f)Dean's waistband in the hall mirror. Suddenly the knob is pulled from (f)Dean's hand and the door slams shut, as does the wooden window blinds all around the room. "You're not priests!" Max yelled as he backed up. (f)Dean draws his gun but Max uses his power to pull it away, sliding it across the floor to where he can pick it up. He hold's it on (p)Sam and (f)Dean.
Thorn had been dragged of somewhere else by Azazel, leaving Sammy in the cell alone. Flashing blue light shined under the cell door, the sounds of fighting getting closer. The door burst open someone stood in the doorway. Air rushed in, making him light headed, someone grabbed him and Sammy soon passed out. When Sammy regained consciousness he was in a field. Squirrel, John, and Sam were standing over him. "Oh thank god, you're alive." Squirrel sighs. "Fuck Chuck. He ain't ever done anything helpful for us." Sammy muttered. "Conscious enough to curse out a dude, he's fine." John smiles.
"You're not my Dad." Squirrel has the gun pointed at John. "Dean, it's me." John says, raising his hands. "I know my Dad better than anyone. And you ain't him." Squirrel said, not backing down. "And you lied to us." Squirrel says, looking to the future Winchesters. "What the hell's gotten into you?" John barked. "I could ask you the same thing. Stay back." Squirrels voice lowered as he glared at John. Sam comes into the room and is shocked to see his brother pointing the gun at John. "Squirrel? What the hell's going on?" Sam asked carefully.
"All right. Just don't hurt her." Luther says as he places the Colt on the ground. "Back up. Further." John told him. John drags Kate forward and leans down with her to pick up the gun. Kate works at the ties around her wrists. "It's a nice move, you almost made it." Luther says to John. Kate swings around, knocking John back against his truck. He drops the gun. Luther approaches, backhanding John back against his open car door, shattering the glass before he lands unconscious on the ground. Luther approaches again.
"Dean?" (f)Sam asked his brother. "Ya Sammy?" "Are we forgetting something?" (f)Dean thought for a second. "I feel like we are." Suddenly, the shadow demon attacks John. He is thrown into a set of cabinets and falls to the ground. (p)Sam also falls. Both Deans are thrown to the floor. (f)Sam went to help John but only got attacked by one of the Daeva.
Sam stalks into Johns room with a duffel bag; Squirrel meets him at the door and starts trying to talk to him. "Sammy! Tell me you can friggin' hear me, man, there's something in the hospital. Now, you've got to bring me back and we've got to hunt this thing. Sam!" John looks over to Sam "You're quiet." he said. Sam turns, fuming, and hurls the bag onto the bed with a crash "Did you think I wouldn't find out?" "What are you talking about?" John asked. "That stuff from Bobby, you don't use it to ward off a demon, you use it to summon one. You're planning on bringing the demon here, aren't you? Having some stupid macho showdown?!"
Dean heads upstairs and into the bathroom, locking the door. He takes a deep breathe and braces himself on the bathroom counter. He took another deep breathe, trying to clear his head. He still wasn't over Sam bringing up Cas last night. He gritted his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut, he couldn't stop thinking about Cas. It didn't help that his past self was constantly asking who Cas was.
(f)Dean turned back to their counterparts "One question each, anything you want to know." the car fell back into silence. "When....When is the next time we see dad?" (p)Sam asked. (f)Dean seemed to think for a moment before answering "About 2 more weeks." (p)Sam was surprised he actually got an answer. Everyone's attention went to (p)Dean "What?" he asked. "There is no way you don't have a question." (p)Sam said looking skeptically at his brother. (p)Dean stares at his future self for a few moments before finally asking "Who is Cas?"
The professor pulled out a large book and turned to a certain section. "Woods god, hm? Well, let's see. (He leafs through some pages." on one page past Dean notices a picture of a scarecrow on a post surrounded by farmers in a field. "Wait, wait, wait. What's that one?" he asked pointing. "Oh, that's not a woods god, per se." "The V-Vanir?" the professor nods. "The Vanir were Norse gods of protection and prosperity, keeping the local settlements safe from harm. Some villages built effigies of the Vanir in their fields. Other villages practiced human sacrifice. One male, and one female." past Dean read. "Kinda looks like a scarecrow, huh?" Dean said.
"Don't be so sure. He killed some people very special to me. But still, you're right, he isn't much of a threat. And neither is your other son." Azazel said. John lowers his head, raises his eyes "You know the truth, right? About Sammy? And the other children?" "Yeah. I've known for a while." John nods. "But Sam doesn't, does he? You've been playing dumb." "Can you bring Dean back? Yes or no?" John snaps. "No. But I know someone who can. it's not a problem." Azazel tells him. "Good. Before I give you the gun, I'm going to want to make sure that Dean's okay. With my own eyes."
Dean nodded in understanding. "Are you guys gonna properly help us? Tell us info instead of waiting?" Sam asked. "This time it's to important not to." Dean told him. Both younger Winchesters grew concerned at that "Why, what's gonna happen? What happens to dad!?" Squirrel asked, starting to yell. "Dean." Sammy said sternly, looking at his brother. "Don't" Dean ignored him. "If we don't do anything dad's gonna die." Dean told them. Sammy looked ready to punch his brother, Squirrel glared at thorn. "Leave me out of this buddy, Azazel is the one with a plan." She told him.
Meg is gathering her things. Past Sam is trying to call Dean on his cell phone. Meg walks up to Sam "Hey. Our bus came in." past Sam hangs up the phone, shaking his head. "You better catch it. I gotta go." he puts on his backpack and Sam gets up ready to follow him. "Go where?" Meg asked. "Burkittsville." "Sam, wait." "I've been trying to call my brother for the last three hours. I'm just getting his voicemail." "Well, maybe his phone's turned off." "No, that's not like him. Meg, I think he might be in trouble." "What kind of trouble?"
"Why are we going to Nebraska?" Sam asked as he put on his coat. "And why are you in such a hurry?" Sammy asked. "The Roadhouse Sammy. Chuck, we've been so caught up with everything else we forgot." Dean explained. Sammy's eyes went wide "Let's go." he said. The older Winchesters practically flew out of the house. The younger brothers looked at each other and followed after. Getting outside Cas was standing next to a completely fixed Impala. "Oh, my Baby. Okay, Cas, you're growing on me." Squirrel said as he stepped outside.
So, I know I've been doing every other episode so far but that's not how I'm gonna do this. Some episodes I just don't find that important and I wanna keep the story interesting.
The Man comforting Ms.Miller on the step the night before opens the door. "Good Afternoon. I'm Father Simmons, this is Father Frehley. We're new junior priests over at St Augustines. May we come in?" (f)Dean says to the man, the man nods. "Thanks." (f)Dean says. "We're very sorry for your loss." (p)Sam tells him. "It's in difficult times like these when the Lord's guidance is most needed." (f)Dean said, cringing inwardly. This wasn't his favorite get up considering his last few encounters with God.
The Deans pull over to the side of the road when they got to Burkittsville, Indiana. Getting out they head to Scotty's Café with a guy sitting in front "Let me guess. Scotty?" young Dean asked. "Yep." "Hi, my name's John Bonham." "Isn't that the drummer for Led Zeppelin?" "Wow. Good. Classic rock fan." " What can I do for you, John?" Dean takes two pieces of paper out of his pocket. They are Missing Person flyers for Holly and Vince Parker. "I was wondering if, uh, you'd seen these people by chance." Scotty looks at the flyers "Nope. Who are they?"
"You wanna go back to school?" (p)Dean asked. "Yeah, once we're done huntin' the thing." "Guys." (f)Sam said, not wanting the situation to escalate. The younger Winchesters turned to look at him "What?" (p)Dean barked, obviously not happy to be interrupted. "I don't go back to school." (f)Sam told them calmly. "There is no point in getting into a fight about something that doesn't happen." (f)Dean looked at his brother in shock. "You're not usually the one for big spoilers." (f)Dean said to his brother.
Cas leaned against Dean, tilting his head to give Dean better access to his neck. "As much as I love this kind of attention you've only groomed one of my wings," Cas said. Dean chuckled and tuned Cas' head. Kissing him on the lips he pushed Cas off his lap. Cas stretched his wings back up as Dean stood. Moving over Dean started smoothing out Cas' primaries. "Hey, Cas?" Dean asked. "Yes, Dean?" "What kind of wings are these?" "Why do you ask?" Cas questioned, looking back at Dean. "Well mainly cause yours are fucking huge." Dean chuckled.
Squirrel gestured at a symbol. It is a cross with a dot in the middle, the bottom stroke looks like an upside-down question mark. "No." Sam said, he turned his head and looked back at his counterpart. "Please tell us what it is?" he asked. "How do you even know the we know what it is?" Dean asked Sam. Sammy face palmed "Maybe cause you've been on this case before." Sam said flatly. Deans face scrunched up in regret "Oh, right, that." he said dumbly.  Sammy sighed "Later, I'll save you the research." Sammy said, his younger counterpart smiling.
Once done Dean, Sam and Squirrel sat down with Sammy. "Well, that was pointless." Squirrel said, slumping back into the booth. "Why didn't you let us skip that?" Sam asked looking at the older Winchesters. "Because, you need the full experience of this hunt. Gotta go through all of it like we did." Dean said and while looking at the menu. The brothers ordered some food and ate in silence for a little bit. "So, where do we find this Craig guy?" Squirrel asked. "I believe, we find him at a music shop, right?" Dean said, turning to look at his brother. Sammy nodded.
Past Sam starts up from his bed, suddenly wide awake. He looks across to where his future self is sleeping peacefully. (p)Sam sits a moment, then moves into action, flipping on the light switch and shaking his counterpart. "Sam. Sam" he said, shacking his future self. The moment (f)Sam stirs, (p)Sam rises and starts gathering his things.
"I'm fine Dean," Cas said, voice a bit gravelly than normal. "You sure? I didn't hurt you did I?" "No Dean. I am unharmed. Please continue." "Alright," Dean said quietly, not 100% convinced. He was working on the second wing when Cas threw his hands over his mouth. Dean stared at Cas with concern. He had gripped a cluster of feathers by accident and was afraid he had hurt Cas. He let go and tried smoothing out the feathers, causing Cas to moan. Dean jumped in surprise as Cas froze. His wings bristling. Dean gave Cas a curious look before grabbing some feathers and lightly tugging.
The future brothers pulled up to the motel and grabbed their respective bags. Getting out of the car and going to their rooms quietly. They set their stuff down and call it a night, laying down and going to sleep.
The Impala is parked by some train tracks. Both Sams are looking through the Key of Solomon book on the roof of the car, Sam is spinning a marker in his hand. Dean is at the back of the car, loading up guns and putting them into his duffel bag. Squirrel is leaning against the car looking solemn and Sam looks over at him, concerned. Sam passes the book to his counterpart and hops down, walking over to his brother. "You've been quiet." Sam says. "Just getting ready." Squirrel says. "He's gonna be fine, Squirrel." Dean told his counterpart, shutting the trunk.
can't but I can. I can fly down to Hell and pull them out." Cas told them. "Can you do that?" John sounded skeptical. "I have pulled both Dean and Sam out of Hell. So yes John Winchester, I can pull them out of Hell now." Cas said sternly.
When Sam and Squirrel walked out of the house they saw Thorn and their counterparts standing by the Impala. "What the hell guys? We thought you ditched us." Squirrel yelled, sounding frustrated. "We were but realized if we took the Impala and left you you'd be stuck here." Dean told them. Everyone climbed into the car and they started driving off "You remember where to go?" Squirrel asked, looking at Thorn. "Yep, but I ain't going in with you." she said. "Come on, why not?" Dean asked her. "Because I can't fight Azazel, he'd kill me."
Dean rolled his eyes and stepped away from (p)Meg "Alright, first things first, pick which one of you is getting a nickname." Dean said, looking at both Megs. (f)Meg raised her hand "I'll take the nickname." sh said. "Great, you can go by traitor." (p)Meg snarked at her counterpart. (f)Meg just rolled her eyes. "How 'bout Thorn?" Sammy suggested. Thorn smiled "Not bad. I'll take it." Dean nodded. "Alright, now that we won't be getting confused lets talk for a bit." Dean said, glancing at Meg. "Alright, Where's our father, Meg?" Squirrel asked, clearly wanting to get on with the interrogation.
Squirrel glances at John and down at the gun Dean is holding out. Squirrel quickly grabbed the gun before John could and took a step back. "Son, please." John says, taking a step toward Squirrel. Squirrel starts to back up a few steps. "Give me the gun. What are you doing, Squirrel?" "He'd be furious." Squirrel stated. "What?" Johns said confused. "That I wasted a bullet. He wouldn't be proud of me, he'd tear me a new one." Squirrel continued. John just looks at him as Squirrel raises the gun, pointing it at him and cocking it.
Dean bowed forward, his head resting against Cas' chest. When Cas calmed down he was breathing heavy. Dean thought Cas was done till he sat up and realized the angel was still fully hard inside of him. Dean blinked at Cas in surprise, the angel smirked up at him "You didn't think we were done, did you?" Dean chuckled and shook his head. "I'm glad we're not." Cas loosened his grip on Deans hips. It had tightened during Cas' unexpected angelic orgasm, and it was sure to leave bruises. Dean rolled his hips causing Cas to bite his lip and trow his head back.
John and the other 3 Winchester brothers emerge from the trees carrying crossbows. "It barely even stings." Kate told them. "Give it time sweetheart. That arrow's soaked in dead man's blood. It's like poison to you isn't it?" John asked. Kate looks shocked, then wavers and loses consciousness, dropping Dean. "Load her up. I'll take care of this one." John says gesturing to the other vamp. Both younger Winchesters gabbed Kate and put her in the trunk of the impala. "Dean you good?" Sammy asked his brother. "Ya, I'm fine. That kiss was disgusting though."Dean said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
"So they have it." John said. "You mean whatever killed Elkins?" Squirrel asked. "We gotta pick up the trail." John said starting to get out of the car. "Wait. You want us to come with you?" Sam asked dumbfounded. "If Elkins was telling the truth, we gotta find this gun." John told them. "The gun -- why?" Sam asked. "Because it's important, that's why." John told them. "Dad, we don't even know what these things are yet." Sam said. "They were what Daniel Elkins killed best: Vampires." John said. Dean looked shocked "Vampires? I thought there was no such thing." he said.
Sammy shakes his head and mouths 'not now.' before turning back to the others. "Look... I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece. Your mother's death ... it almost killed me. I can't watch my children die too. I won't." John said solemnly. "What happens if you die? Dad, what happens if you die, and we coulda done something about it?" Dean and Sammy both looked at the ground but stayed quiet "You know I been thinking. I ...think maybe Sammy's right about this one. We should do this together." Squirrel told John.
The Impala pulls up as Roger approaches the entrance with a bag of groceries. (p)Sam leans out the window "Hey Roger." "What are you guys, missionaries? Leave me alone." he said, heading to the building. (f)Dean guns the engine, jumping the curb as he hurriedly parks. (p)Sam hopped out of the car and yelled after him "Hey. Roger. We're trying to help!" all Winchesters got out of the car and ran after him.
"And Jo, you help too. I'll talk to the older boys." Jo nodded and lead Squirrel and Sam over to Ash. Dean and Sammy followed Ellen over to the bar. "Now you two, start talking. What happened in Carthage? How are we all back in time?" Ellen asked, grabbing a drink for her and the boys.
"I think we both know how you really feel about me. You know, I saw you watching me—changing in my apartment. Turned you on, didn't it?" "Get a room, you two." (p)Dean chimed in, (f)Sam gagging slightly. "I didn't mind. I liked that you were watching me. Come on, Sammy. You and I can still have a little dirty fun." she begins kissing his neck. "Meg, do us both a favor and stop." (f)Sam said. Meg looked over to him "Don't like me anymore Sam?" Meg asked.
The Impala drives onto a junkyard. There are junk cars around and hubcaps nailed to the side of the house. A large dog is chained to a post and is lying on the hood of an old tow truck. Dean and Sammy practically jump out of the car, slamming the doors and bolting to the porch. Before they even made it up the steps the door opened. Bobby Singer stepped out and both older Winchesters stopped in their tracks. Squirrel and Sam trotted up behind their counterparts "Hey Bobby, listen, we can explain." Squirrel started, knowing the older hunter was paranoid.
"Well there was one point in the distant future where we brought you to our time and it messed up everything cause I became a known wanted criminal, Sammy gave speeches and loved kale, Zachariah was still alive, and Cas had no idea who I was." Dean said. John blinked, processing...that. "Alright, fine. When do we have to go?" he asked. "Sometime soon. We need to take Thorn back as well since it's possible all of Hell will be looking for her." Dean said. John nodded "One more question though." "What's that?" Sam asked. "What do you mean by 'Bunker'?"
Dean moved so he could have a hand on each wing, massaging the base. His thumb accidentally brushed over an oil gland. Cas groaned harshly and pressed into Dean's hand with more force. A lot had spilled onto Dean's hand. Out of curiosity he brought his hand up and sniffed. It had the scent of Honey, spring flowers, and a cool breeze. Giving in to temptation Dean licked some off his fingers. Humming, Dean was pleasantly surprised. It was sweet and savory, with a tangy aftertaste. Dean smirked, getting an idea. He massaged Cas' sides to keep him distracted while he leaned closer.
Meg looked over to the future Winchesters "What's your plan boys?" they looked at each other. Sighing they put their weapons down and their hands up. Meg looked at them confused, shrugging she ordered the Daeva to knock them out.
"Are they ever gonna remember we're here?" Meg asked the older Winchesters. Sam and squirrel jumped slightly and looked over, obviously having forgotten about the other three occupants in the room. "well they remember now." Dean said smirking. "Isn't she the Bitch that's kidnapped our dad? Why are you hanging around her?" Squirrel all but growled out, glaring at Meg. Meg actually growled at him as her eyes shifted to black. "Alright, calm down you two." Dean said, stepping between Squirrel and Meg. "She's on our side now, remember?" Sammy told the past Winchesters.
Sammy seemed to catch on to what his brother was thinking "Dean do you actually think-?" "Sammy there's a chance." Dean said, sounding hopeful. "What are you two talking about? Who are you talking about?" Squirrel asked. Dean didn't respond, just hit the gas pedal and drove. "Dean where are you go-" Meg stopped talking, catching on. Sam and Squirrel looked between Meg, Dean, and Sammy confused "Care to let us in on what you all are talking about?" Sam asked. None of them answered. Squirrel sighed and fell back "Give up Sam. We'll find out when we get there."
Both Deans walked out of the diner, their brother leaning against the impala. "Okay, Sammy I got your rabbit food." Dean said, Sammy rolled his eye. "Now, why don't we get back to the motel, I get to drive." Squirrel says, already getting in the car. "Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?" Dean muttered to himself. Squirrel turns the key in the ignition, Latino pop-dance music blasts from the speakers; when Dean tries to turn it off, the wipers turn on. Squirrel rears back. "WHOA! What the..." Squirrel said in surprise, he quickly reaches to turn everything off.
"Cas, you have your wings back." Dean said in shock. Cas lightly nodded his head "Yes, it appears so. I just hope I can keep them now." as they were talking Sammy had come up to them, everyone else close behind. "So it finally happened? You two are finally together?" Sammy asked them. Both men blushed "What do you mean finally?" Dean asked. "What he means is that you two constantly had sexual tension around you whenever you two were in the same room. It was obvious you liked each other." Thorn explained. "It seemed like everyone knew you like each other but you." Sammy laughed.
Dean moved off of Cas' dick before laying back down on him. "We should probably head back soon. The others have to be wondering where we are by now." Dean said. Cas groaned in protest wrapping his arms and wings around Dean tighter. "Honey Bee, we can cuddle all you want when we get back to the bunker. We're gonna be staying there for a bit and letting history play it's course for a little bit." Dean offered. Cas huffed but let go of his hunter "I expect at least two hours of cuddles when we get home." Cas said grumpily.
Dean hung up the phone and went to his room. Grabbing his bag he headed to the library. "You leaving already?" Max asked, looking up from his book. "Unfortunately yes. A demon is about to try and kill our past selves and our dads about to have the shit beat out of him." Sam walked into the library with a towel around his shoulders. "Hey Sammy, grab your bag, we need to go get kidnapped by Meg." Dean told his brother. Sam looked at him confused but sighed "Alright, give me a sec." Sam said walking off.
They were all quite, (p)Dean glaring at the older Winchesters, (p)Sam went to stare out the window and the older Winchesters were staring at the road. "He has a point," (p)Sam said, making his older self turn to look at him. "It's not like we're asking for you to tell us where dad is or anything. Just to save us some time on research or checking a house. You could have saved us time and let us get away sooner if you had told us nothing was in the house." (p)Sam said, starting to glare at his older self.
f)Sam lightly shook his head and (p)Dean frowned turning back to the landlady. "Ma'am, do you mind if we take some time? Give this place a once-over?" (f)Sam asked. "Oh, well, go right ahead. Knock yourself out." she told him. The landlady walked out of the room and (p)Dean went to the tool box. Pulling out the EMF meter he looked to (f)Sam "Am I gonna need this?" he asked. "Try it and you'll find out." (f)Sam said, shrugging his shoulders. (p)Dean frowned "So, a killer walks in and out of the apartment—no weapons, no prints, nothin'." he said.
The younger Winchesters laughed. "Man, I almost forgot what they used to be like." Sammy said. "Right? Almost missed the fuckers too." Dean chuckled. The younger Winchesters looked at them oddly. "Do we ever run into them again?" Squirrel asks. "Yep, and they teach us something real important." Dean told his counterpart. "What would that be?" Sam asked. "That gay love can pierce through the vale and save the day." Dean said with a smile, a bit of a distant look in his eyes. The brother headed off to the impala, off to their next hunt.
