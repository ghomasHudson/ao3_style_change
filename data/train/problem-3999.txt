the memories he needed, a gift from his past-self to his current person. He felt… complete. Losing his memories to the corrosion of having a human body and no grace was an event well-documented in the black notebook, all the reset words written in with an explanation of what they were going to bring back into his mind like a new puzzle piece.

The scene is not yet set, the stage not ready- so the curtains on the ceiling of the dais are still sweeping over the wooden panels below it.

“Got it,” Dean jumps in, biting back a smile. He scoops up the offending geode, holding it high for Elanor’s approval before replacing it on the shelf above his head. “The rock with the incredible story is safe,” he says cheekily.
Dean snatched the bag from him and glared. “Cut it out with the Santa stuff, or you’re walkin’ home from here.”
Slightly delayed and too late for her to see, Dean nods, his eyes flicking reflexively in the direction she indicated and
Sam rolled his eyes. "You love him, right? You want to spend the rest of your terrible, crazy, perfect life with him. You want to give him your last name. That's all true, yes?"
“Hey!” Dean yells out from behind him, too clear for Castiel’s liking. A brief glance over his shoulder reveals that Dean’s helmet is off, held uselessly in one hand as the other still clutches Castiel’s waist. Considering their circumstances—dangerous police chase through unfamiliar territory, Dean’s physical condition—Castiel

It gives him a somewhat momentary distraction from the fact that Castiel, who always answers prayers and comes when called, has not come back to him for the first time in a while. Dean realizes just how much he has taken everything for granted.

Dean Winchester (impalameonastick)
catstiel: ^^^^^
Dean mouths, and Sam tilts his head in confusion.
Sammy turns under the covers, facing his older brother with a look of pity that Dean misses because he opens his eyes too late. His stupid little brother is trying to shuffle his way over, but he gets more and more wrapped up as he wriggles, and Dean snorts. “Com’ere, you,” he grunts, holding two arms out and rolls over. One of his arms is trapped uncomfortably under his own body weight, but god, the feeling of his brother finally relaxing in his totally

He can blame it on the fact that the man, whose name he still does not know, appears in his store much more frequently than he needs to, but he can’t deny that his heart skips a beat when he hears the familiar throat clearing as the man somewhat announces his arrival when he steps into the store, wipes his boots on the mat politely by the front of the door, and glances to meet Castiel’s eyes from where Castiel stands behind the register before walking around to look at the new assortment of globes that have arrived. Some of them have even been ordered specifically

Castiel looks at the hand with his head tilted to the side and eyes narrowed. He then realizes that that was the cue for him to reply in turn, and he flushes pink. “I am Castiel Novak.” The extended hand is left in the air empty, and so Dean retracts it, his ears turning red. Despite that horrible interaction, he forges on in his attempt of

He pulls out his wallet and brings out a five and a one from the inner pocket, as well as a few quarters and dimes. “Hey, listen,” he begins, as he hands the money off to Castiel. “I- gosh, this is so dumb.” He drags a hand through his hair, Castiel watching him in silent amusement as he stashes the money away in the right columns. “Oh! Right, er… I’ve never gotten to the introduction stage, so… hi.” He holds out his hand. “My name is Dean Winchester.”

Castiel watches as he stalks his familiar path around the dimly lit aisles, nodding almost appreciatively at one particular snowglobe that houses a miniature car and a cabin behind it, windows lit up by supposed candles inside; he grabs it and holds it in his hands carefully with a gentleness that betrays his supposed hard-rock look, examining it with an almost childish excitement. Castiel ignores him for a while in favour of going to the back and taking count of the items there for a while, knowing exactly when to come out to meet the man who probably has the snowglobe in hand.

"Oh my god!" Lisa exclaimed and ran towards Dean and helped him untie Cas.
"I said. I didn't promise, did I?"
"Nice to meet you, Sam. I'm new here. It's just been a year. I don't remember who I was before." Sam took a deep breath.
"Here let me help." Dean slowly took off Cas's shirt.
"It's time to end this all. The more we wait, Dean could get hurt. Since we know who it is, it's easy."
"Maybe."
Dean began the process of unpacking when he heard the jingle of keys and stood up straight. It was that smell again. It was his room mate's smell. Dean didn't want to ruin his first impression so he took his juice bottle which was infact blood. He didn't want to pounce on the guy on the first day or anytime.
"What!? Thank god. B-But what are you doing here rather than being beside him?" She asked him which Castiel told her truthfully.
It was dinner time and Dean was playing with the two babies or boys you might say. They were growing up pretty fast.
"Dean ..he helps the librarian in his free time. So yeah I got his help." Cas chuckled. Dean nodded.
"I know that my present mom isn't really my mom. I remember dad saying that mom disappeared protecting me. I don't know what he means but I'm sure it's related to others like you. He hid me. Like literally for one year in the basement. Said it was for my safety. I didn't really question. My dad is my everything. And now he's angry because I like boys." Cas ended shrugging.
"Tell me what happened Dean." Cas said, stroking Dean's hair soothingly.
"It's Sprite. Haven't you had this before?" Dean answered.
"Are you sure you want to go further in this state, Cas?" Asked Dean. He could feel himself getting hard.
"We will love you no matter what." His mother said and Dean almost cried out of happiness. He was never a guy who showed his feelings but this transformation had taken his feelings to another level. He hated that.
"I just got used to people leaving me. But now that you're talking to me, and if you stop I don't think I'll ever be okay."
"Your boyfriend, love of your life, your angel Cas."
"Yeah. I'm Dean. Dean Winchester." Dean introduced himself.
"Yeah and K in K-pop stands for Chinese."
"Just stay inside until the right time comes, yeah?" Cas told him. Dean melted at the soft voice which was so different from before.
"You tell me." A voice startled him. He looked behind him to see Dean standing.
See you guys next week. Until then, have a great week.
"Yes. Please. I want to be yours and yours only."
"Look at me!" Cas looked up hesitantly.
"What're you doing my lovebirds?" Charlie asked laughing.
Two years later.
It was Lisa.
Sam went back home to see if the others had come back home. They had.
Cas was on cloud nine.
Dean's dorm was located at the third building, 5th floor. The campus was huge, the tress surrounding the buildings were neatly trimmed. Since there was no lift, Dean had to climb all the way to the 5th floor. Now that he was a vampire, he wasn't tired. He reached the floor and started searching for the room 112, it was down the passage to the left. He was the first to come, his room mate hadn't shown up yet.
"Finally. Today's math class was boring not gonna lie." Cas huffed as he kept his books back in the bag. Dean did the same and followed Cas out the classroom.
Dean watched as Castiel droped his bag near the table which they were supposed to use it for studying. He was about to say something when a girl came in hugged Dean. He was unresponsive. All he cared was the boy infront of him. Dean felt someone shaking him and realised they weren't alone.
Hello again, since I can't upload the chapter tomorrow I'm doing it now. And I love reading your comments so please let me know your thoughts. See y'all next week.
"Beautiful, Dean. You look perfect." She said and Dean smiled. Dean wanted to go talk to his little brother now but his mother stopped him.
: right. Boys when do you have holidays coming up?
"Nice to meet you." Clarie said.
"Yup, I love sandwiches." Cas smiled and told Dean to go search for a place for them to sit.
"Ugh!!! Get your lazy ass up and go to the airport. He came to say goodbye to me and I heard you didn't text him all month after everything!? You have 15 mins Dean."
"Promise."
"Okay."
No one was there yet. After a few minutes, another car arrived and a woman and a few other men walked out of the car.  Castiel instructed the driver to go closer.
"Clarie?" He asked. And Jody turned the Camera towards them. Clarie waved at Sam.
"Aww. You're beautiful my angel."
Castiel sighed. "Who drinks beer for breakfast?"  He got up from beside Sam. Sam noticed the relief in Dean's eyes. He smirked mentally. His plan has to work. They suffered enough. With Jack being the God, heaven restored, hell in hands of Rowena, they just had to take care of some rogue monster here and there or small ghost cases.
"Lower your volume. He's sleeping." Castiel said as he pets the puppy.
"I met Charlie and she told me that...that your mark belongs to the mother of all and...and um…. people with that mark can't be anyone's mate or a soulmate to another species or human." Dean didn't look at Cas as he was scared of what he might see in those beautiful blue eyes.
"How can she be so dumb?" He heard Dean ask, tilting his head to the side, disgusted. His mom didn't learn anything from his dad who was an expert in these things. Business I mean.
Castiel could feel the poison. If he and Sam hadn't come on time, they would've lost Dean forever.
"That's no problem. I always wanted to meet people like you. I never imagined I would be staying with one of them." Castiel told.
"What?"
The boy looked shocked to see Dean had found them.
"What about me?" Charlie asked pouting. Dean chuckled.
"Uh...yeah I guess." Cas wasn't convinced with the answer. Dean was still looking at the floor. Cas sighed.
"That....you have to ask him." Lisa gave a pause.
Sam walked towards Dean's room. He had made a daily habit of checking on how his brother was doing. He hoped Dean would get better soon and start searching for Cas. Sam was so happy the year Dean and Castiel were together. Dean was so happy and satisfied. Sam was getting used to this. But fate had its plans. Dean was back to drinking and didn't step out of the bunker, he just stared at the photo of the three they took during a dinner at a restaurant where Sam had to leave asap because they both couldn't keep their hands to themselves. Sam smiled remembering those moments.
Checking his phone, Dean realizes it’s later than he expected, nearing two in the afternoon. That explains the sandwiches, and probably Cas being out of bed, but Dean can’t focus on any of that right now. All of a sudden he feels claustrophobic, wants to be anywhere but here, in Cas’ space and under his thumb, whether he’s wearing his collar or not. It’s an unpleasant sensation, and while a large part of Dean knows he wouldn’t trade the things they’ve done for all the normality in the world, there’s another part of him that just wants his friend Cas back.
the freaking pleasure last night.”
—in the dark of his own mind, instead of only this void.
“I know you hate the idea,” Sam starts again, and this time Dean just slumps in his chair and pokes at the rim of his bottle with his finger. “After Dad—”
“Sorry,” he apologizes, waving to Tanha. She rolls her eyes and ducks back under the bar.

starting to set. Four-thirty in the dead of December—the light doesn’t last long, even this far west. It’s bright enough to make him squint, though, the curve of the highway sending him what feels like directly into the sun.
With Castiel’s cock moving methodically inside him, hitting his prostate on nearly every other thrust, it doesn’t take long for the tension to build in his groin. Half-dazed, Dean sneaks a hand in between them and strokes himself the way that he likes, in time with Castiel’s patient rhythm. It all amounts to some kind of flawless perfection Dean could never have imagined being with
Dean looks surprised and then scoffs. “
Except for when he didn’t. When he’d make those suggestive little comments, or just...linger.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered, shaking his head. “What now? What is it? Did the Pumpkin King start flying overhead? Did Cindy Loo Who pop by? Grinch? Krampus?”

“I was cold earlier,” he explained quietly.
“Rude,” Dean complains. “You were going to strand me at this thing alone? Do you
“Psh,” Charlie replies, waving her hand dismissively. “Semantics. Besides, Dean isn’t going to be the one lying,

Once freed from the producers’ clutches, everyone stands around a bit uncertainly, probably not wanting to be the first to cross any proverbial lines. Thankfully, Victor steps up to the plate and gets things moving again—suggesting they all go and check out their sleeping accommodations.
There’s even a large rock near the entrance that Castiel is fairly certain he can move, closing the whole place off, for the most part. This is absolutely as good as it’s going to get. Leaving the flashlight on the floor, balanced and pointed up at the ceiling in a way that creates terribly creepy shadows, Castiel drops his pack and hurries outside to retrieve Dean.
With one quick wink, the elf clicked their fingers and there was a crash. Everyone stumbled back, but Dean was frozen to place as the glass shattered into shards and from within it spilled what seemed like  two metric tons of snow, crashing into his legs and sweeping a few elves off their feet.
They watched each other, eye to eye, for a long moment.

Right or wrong, that is me, that is how it is. If you enjoy my fics, literally all I'm asking in return is that you don't push those buttons because it hurts me and makes me want to stop writing. ANYTHING else, please, feedback away. I want to know how you want to see them get it on. I want to know what kinks you like (or don't), etc etc. I want to hear your reactions to the story (even if those are tough, because those are YOUR reactions and all valid)!!! There's a difference between "Oh wow, this chapter was awful for me to read because I'm sensitive to subdrop" and "oh wow, using this kink means you're a disgusting human and I hate how you made Cas someone who likes it." Dig? Big difference. If I need to explain why the first is something I always want to hear and the second is something I never do, please, do us both a favor and exit stage left.
all the way off, before you mess with something you can’t fix. You got
and stronger for it. Instead, Castiel found himself friendless, jobless, and with a humiliating ink pattern on his back that he has to look at, has to think about and suffer with, every single day.
“Underestimate me now,” he says quietly. “Call me a whore
"F-Fuckers knocked me out cold," Sam chattered as Dean started shaking Cas and rubbing his hands over his face in hopes it would warm him up. "D-Dunno what they did to C-Cas, but when we woke up here, he said he c-c-couldn't feel his g-grace. Said he was f-freezing and that he couldn't feel what kinda magic w-was trapping us."
And if all goes as planned, Cas is going to have it on his finger tonight.
No, not staring,
“I resent that,” Balthazar says, turning his back to display his stunning blue-gradient wings, wide as they’ll stretch. His feather pattern is light up by his alulas, sky blue that blends darker all the way to royal down by the ends. Each feather finishes with a dusting of silver at the tip, and Castiel agrees—it is rather spectacular. He also has a similar metallic effect on his own tips—silver, like Bal’s, as opposed to Gabriel’s gold.
escape from prison, after all.”
“Inside,” Dean demands. “Gimme the nickel tour, and if you skip everything but the bedroom, I promise not to complain.”
What follows is the best workout of Dean’s life. Although, that
Suddenly, Castiel’s eyes started to glow bright, neon blue beside him and with a great, heaving yell from the angel the door slammed shut, locking automatically behind them, though Sam for one had no idea if it would hold against a possibly-still-juiced-up-on-Angel-grace Prince of Hell. He supposed that they were about to find out.
just because it’s new or because his collar is off, is beyond Dean’s comprehension. Why it didn’t occur to him that Cas would take
As someone who inks people’s skin for a living, it’s not the most ringing endorsement of either his talent or his judgment. So, no, Castiel won’t be strutting around with his own personal canvas on display, not this year, anyway and perhaps not ever again.
“Gabriel,” Castiel replies with a sigh, turning to greet his cousin and immediately being yanked into a hug. “Oof.” When he lets go, Castiel notes that Gabriel’s sweater puts everyone else’s to shame. It has actual flashing lights
Suddenly, the door to the train car jostles with the effort of someone trying to yank it open from the outside.
Dean’s rhythmic thrusts are giving Cas quite a bit of friction that’s hard to ignore. His own cock is angry at him for not holding Dean’s head still and finishing down his throat when he had the chance, but neither of them can—in good conscience—say that this current situation is worse. Castiel looks up into Dean’s eyes, hungry and wanting, and jerks his pelvis in wanton invitation.
to stifle his own noises of appreciation as he watches himself slide in and out of Dean’s ass easily. The soft, round cheeks bracketing his cock are still bright pink from the spanking Castiel doled out before deciding to fuck him, and just for fun, Castiel raises his hand and brings it down hard once again. The slapping sound his palm makes when it connects with Dean’s skin seems to echo off of the dingy tile, and Castiel grins at Dean’s responding whimper.
ready to jump on that train yet, but just the intimidating show of force he’s watching is enough to make Castiel shiver despite the warm Southern California air. The fact that they’re lined up at Kaia’s back, facing the demonstrating crowd, it’s—well, it’s unnerving, is what it is.
related,” Castiel exclaims, wrapping his arms around her thin shoulders and squeezing tight. “I love you,” he adds, kissing her cheek before darting away to catch up with Anna. The pleased smile on his mother’s face as he goes makes the sappy display
“The demon Crowley is patrolling the other side with Sam. I’ve checked the east side already, we’re all clear. Care to keep me company? I’m not very sleepy,” she admitted, humming bitterly. She jerked her head a bit to throw a piece of limp red hair over her shoulder. “Several millenias of not sleeping is a hard habit to abandon.”
The cup was taken from him by cool hands, and he was pushed down onto the cot by warmer ones; Jo, then Dean. Their scents mingled and Castiel felt immediately at ease as the potion rumbled through him, sliding through his veins, washing his body in numbness. He felt himself relax into the otherwise uncomfortable cot, and he heard Rowena begin to chant as his eyes slid shut. Through his lids, the last thing he remembered was the purple glow from Rowena’s hands, held out over him, palms down.

“No, assbutt,” Castiel replies, splashing him admonishingly. “You drew my eye from the moment I stepped off of that boat. I only had your name and information, not your picture. I was looking for Dean Winchester, yes, but I had no idea who you were until you told me. And by then—” Castiel leans in, way too close, skating his lips teasingly close to Dean’s. “—I was done for.”
To his surprise, Dean’s face changes as Castiel attempts to move past him, openly looking his body up and down. “Anxious to get me alone, Doc? Heard through the grapevine about what the prison slut will do for anyone that Crowley owes a favor? That what this is about? Hey, baby, you don’t need to call me down to the Principal’s office to snag a piece. Gonna need to see the menu, or—?” Licking his lips, Dean crowds him against the cool cement wall, letting his hand drift down to Castiel’s hip where it curls possessively.
“Why don’t you just pee on me?” Dean complains gruffly, but the corners of his lips twitch with a badly hidden smirk that makes Castiel outright grin.
The fans who pen these stories are both subversive and clever, extremely diverse in their imaginings.
or what to do next.
Something new, something different. Curious, Dean shifts his chair closer as Sam pulls out his phone, swiping swiftly until a grainy black and white image comes up on the screen. He flips the phone in Dean’s direction, leaving it face up on the table. “Congratulations, Uncle Dean.”
was available, which only made Sam more irritated and prickly.
under penalty of death admitted to it. He made a face as he remembered his brother comparing potentially being squashed underneath Dean to Wile E. Coyote’s misadventures with anvils—“without the funny cartoon resurrection.” Fuck him.
losing himself in the moment—it’s automatic for him to default into self-restraint-mode. He’s already there, despite having full permission to finally
“We’ll have a Christmas for him after,” Sam reassured, following Dean into the hallway, their feet padding over the hard, cold flooring. “We’ll figure something out.”
Under the tree were a few presents, some in bags stuffed in sparkly tissue, and some wrapped in silver paper and topped with bows. But Dean knew that there was room for more.
he cannot have?
He turns his head, looks down the scant two inches to meet Cas’ eyes, flicking his gaze down to Cas’ lips. Cas seems to understand, and as he parts them, Dean leans in closer and releases the smoke. They don’t break the rules again, their lips never touch, but Dean blows what’s in his lungs straight into Cas’, and it’s easily as intimate as if they had.

yes, but excuses all the same. Even his dad calling after him, trying to entice him back for a board game in front of a roaring fire, couldn’t budge Castiel’s sour mood.
not so sedated and uninterested in attempting to answer complicated questions. Maybe if he could
Scratching his chin, Castiel carefully considers what to say next. His instincts tell him that Dean’s last question is deflective humor more than anything else, so he goes with that, opting not to overthink it.
And with Dean off from work and it only taking
“Dean.”
“Next stop, the bunker,” he said as he passed.
Surely, they’ll get there, but not like this. Even four of Castiel’s fingers aren’t going to cut it for where they’re going today. Time to up the ante. When Castiel withdraws his hand, Dean writhes against the mattress and complains (as expected) but Castiel pays him no mind—he
“Uh, it is the way you guys were doing it,” Mandy replies as she yanks the curtain closed behind her.
Soon, very soon, she'd have them all.
God. No, the best thing Castiel can do is to protect the timeline he has access to with his full potential, along with the people in it. Including and especially, Dean.
“Why do you care so much about what I identify as, Dean?”
With that in mind—and all of Dean’s gorgeous, bright red skin shining under Castiel’s hands—he takes pity on the trembling man, still on his knees. Blanketing Dean’s back with his (still-clothed) body (
Sucking in a haggard breath, Dean tries his best to take Cas’ words on faith. He closes his eyes against the light and takes a long moment to adjust, the memories of everything leading up to him losing consciousness flooding his mind all at once. “Fuck,” he repeats, this time at the implications of what his being tied down must mean.
"Meet you at lunch." Charlie winked. Dean waved to her and walked to the cafeteria.
: Thank God I have a free class now. *Don't scold me*
"Look, Dean hasn't talked to you since that day and he probably needs more time. And you know we want a grandson or a daughter which you both can't give."
Hope you like it. Please do comment and let me know if you like it. It is very much appreciated.
Soon Charlie and Lisa joined.
After Dean left, Castiel turned to Sam.
"Thank god. Yes I did. How was the trip to Japan?"
"We need to leave. You can continue your college back where we left off." Cas' dad said.
"I can't wait to be all human again." Castiel chuckled.
"Shut up Charlie, I don't even know whether he even likes me or not." Before Charlie could reply the bell rang indicating the class was over.
"Hey, how have you been?"
"It's good so far." Dean said as his parents joined Sam on the other side. "I broke up with Lisa. She was sad but I know it's good for both of us." Dean sighed.
Castiel was happy with his choice of friends. Castiel really liked Dean. It wasn't as if he didn't like him back at school, now it's just more. He had a crush on Dean and he knew the girls knew but he had no choice now did he? Cas was sad. Dean would have a true mate. Once while they got bored doing homeworks, Dean told him.
"Dea-" she was cut off.
"I missed you too!"
"Excuse me." Sam called and the man turned around leaving Sam shocked. "Cas...?"
