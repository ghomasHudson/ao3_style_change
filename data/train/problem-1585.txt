come back. Is that understood?”
“YOU WOULDNT TALK TO ME, SHERLOCK! GOD DAMMIT!” he hissed. “For a bloody week I tried to do everything I could to get you to talk to me! Even if it was just as fucking friends and you would have no part in that. As far as I’m concerned you lost the right to know the second you kicked me out of you house.” He spat, “If you’re going to be like that get the hell out of my room!”
John picked himself up off the floor and practically ran to the kitchen, tripping slightly as he went. He grabbed a bottle of pills – he didn’t even know what kind they were... he just wanted relief. He wanted silence and he wanted to be with Sherlock, even though Sherlock didn’t want to be with him. Fuck that girl. He was so angry, so angry with everything, and if he had just stayed home none of this would be happening.
Sherlock hummed and ran his hand through John’s hair, “Because it is.” He replied. “I sleep better with you by my side and so do you. And no, do not argue because I know you do as well. You forget we have class together so I see you every day and I can safely say I have never seen you as well rested as you were this morning.”
Claire sighed. "I'm going to start living with you. And don't give me that face.” She said firmly as John's stare turned into a glare. “You don't have any say in the matter because you fucked up." She growled out slightly. “I gave you two chances to live on your own. The bathtub, and now this, and frankly I’m not waiting ‘round to find out if the third time really is the charm.” She whispered quietly, lifting his hand up and pressing it to her lips.
“Well, what are you waiting for?” He snapped, he couldn’t sit around here all day and wait for Sherlock to make a stupid decision.
This chapter is also doozy.....  (I keep using that word hahaha let's mix it up... Killer? This chapter is a killer??) but I enjoyed writing it! It honestly probably hurts my heart the most thus far and for that I am sorry, but I love my fucking angst, okay?
Sherlock closed his eyes and slowly reached up to wrap his hands gently around John's wrists, holding them so he would stop hitting his chest. "I know... I know it was, my love. And I will never forgive myself for the pain I have caused you, but I didn't have any other choice. You would have died if I didn't..." He whimpered.
“John, I was the one that shot you! Of course I needed to stay!” He sighed and sat at the edge of the bed.
John glared at her slightly, well that certainly wasn’t the response he had been expecting, “What does that mean...”
“Stop. That’s none of your business...” John looked away, swallowing audibly.
John swallowed hard and shook his head, “Whatever.” He huffed, “I’m going for a walk.”
He groaned and tried to wiggle away, “Really?
Hours passed and it seemed that John wasn’t making any progress. He sighed, stood up, and then walked to the door. He had just placed his hand on the door knob when he heard a soft groaning sound.
John’s eyes widened and he grinned, “OH! Oh! So you’re the big brother that looks after him even though he doesn’t want it – how fascinating!”
“Umm, yes, that’s it. And I do – did… like my brother! I just– no one believes me and I need your help... is there a time that we could meet? How about two weeks from Saturday?” John grinned to himself on his beautiful acting skills, Sherlock had once told him that when a person started using past tense quickly, often times they were guilty.
Brian sighed and slowly laid Sherlock down as he started to unbutton his shirt, “You love me... I know you do... you just need to remember what we had. Don’t worry I didn’t give you enough that you will pass out or anything.” He said softly and then started to kiss down Sherlock's neck.
John’s livid with Sherlock. He’s yelling at him and screaming at him and he knows it’s irrational, but he can't help it. They were on a case and Sherlock had run off alone, like he always does, but its different now. He can't keep doing this! Only this time he managed to get a bad bruise on his head from when the person they were chasing hit him with a golf club. He’s fine... of course he’s fine, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t scare the daylights out of John.
“You aren’t getting away from me that easily… what are you hiding?” He cocked his head a little to the side and gave John a look that immediately reminded him of a confused cat. “If it’s because you live in a smaller house than me, well don’t be embarrassed... a lot of people live in small houses.”
“OR WHAT?” Moriarty snapped and rounded on Sherlock, lunging at him like a lioness would to an unsuspecting gazelle, only Sherlock was suspecting this. He would
Sherlock sighed a long and suffering sigh. He honestly hated people and he was so bitter about everything. He didn’t care about life anymore... not since John died. He didn’t even know why he continued to live if he was being honest with himself. He figured it was because he would rather feel the pain of depression than to be gone completely. Plus, you never really knew what to expect when you died… for all he knew he would just cease to exist and he wasn’t sure he liked that outcome either. However, that didn’t stop him from trying on several occasions. Sometimes he wished he had never met the bastard. He honestly ruined him and Sherlock hated him for that, “Fine, but I just want you to know that your case is incredibly dull and I’m only taking it for the money.” He huffed and stood up, but wouldn’t turn around. He walked over to the window and peered out of it.
Sherlock is an asshole and I hate him. One day he will understand, but maybe he won't. idiot dude.
Mycroft hummed and looked at his watch, “Right. We better get you dressed, probably only have about five minutes. You have to look presentable.” He sung and snapped his fingers slightly. As soon as he did this a woman John didn’t recognise came into the room, holding his clothes. She was dressed in a pencil skirt and button down shirt, like she had a high end job and needed to look presentable herself.
because this was not a matter of if! He would wake up because Sherlock wouldn’t take anything less. He looked at John's lifeless body; it was like he was as cocoon... There and present, but lifeless and unmoving. He swallowed hard and his mind started to drift. It seemed to be doing a lot of that these days, he told himself it was because his brain was trying to figure out an alternate ending for what really happened. Perhaps a way to punish him, see other possibilities he could have taken that didn’t end up with John fighting for his life.
Question:
Sherlock closed his eyes as he tried to picture the driver. Built body, blond sandy hair, white skin, a crazed look in his eye, white shir— JOHN’S DAD! Sherlock gasped and then started running as fast as he couldn’t, even though he was no match for the speeding car. There was only one way he would be stupid enough to go so fast, so reckless, and that was if he had John – not only that but if he had John and was planning on doing something stupid. Sherlock ran faster, even though it seemed impossible. He briefly thought that this was probably the fasted he had ever run in his whole life, but he needed to keep up with the car. Even with all the adrenaline pumping through Sherlock's veins, it seemed impossible to catch up. The car was going so fast and he only had his legs to carry him through the streets. Sherlock could tell it was heading for the river and he knew the car could only go right or left. Once the car turned whichever corner Sherlock knew it would be gone and he would lose it. He would lose John all because he wasn’t fast enough and for that he would never forgive himself.
Ted Watson scoffed, “I will not have a fag living under my roof with his faggy boyfriend! You’ll make me catch fagaria!”
(See the end of the chapter for
I don't have my Laffy Taffy on my sooooooo i'm going to cheat...
She smirked and rolled her eyes, “Well, I think that’s rather a giveaway considering it is mid-morning and you are at a bar all by your lonesome. Wanna talk about it?” Clearly she liked American terms better than British ones, or perhaps she had one American parent while the other was a Brit. John wasn’t like Sherlock, he couldn’t figure things out the way Sherlock could.
John awoke to the sound of beeping and pain in his body. He didn't want to open his eyes, but he could tell he was in a bright room – and if the sounds of the beeping were anything to go by he was in hospital. He mentally cursed himself and tried to think back to the last thing that he had done... Ah, right, the bottle of pills... So stupid. He should have known that Claire would have followed him home. And wasn't that just brilliant? Because the second he opened his eyes he was going to see her angry face... Unless she wasn't there, then he would have to wait until she walked into the room, but either way he would have to see her angry face and he would probably get yelled at and wasn't that just something! Unlike last time however he wasn't grateful that she found him. He was done. He was tired and he tried to move on, but ended up getting yelled at and kicked to the ground, figuratively of course, but it all hurt the same. He wasn't okay and the fact that people just expected him to be okay was sickening to him, how could they expect him to just move on? Perhaps John was too dependent on Sherlock, but after years of not having him, only to have him ripped away again right as their relationship had repaired itself, hurt tremendously. He tried to move on, he honestly did, but he just couldn’t let go and he was so exhausted. He finally wanted a dreamless sleep, one that he would never wake up from.
jOke Of ThE ChApTeR:
they could be intimate, John wanted Sherlock so badly. He hadn’t properly had Sherlock in years – and no that time that Sherlock half sucked him off didn’t count –  but right before they got to the good part Brian walked in and would act embarrassed, he would stumble out an apology and then leave the room, giving them privacy. That was fine and good, except for the fact that after that happened Sherlock wasn’t in the mood anymore and John didn’t understand why! He would immediately start getting dressed and then went to tinkering about his experiments, basically ignoring John all together, so John would just leave.
UNTIL NEXT TIME BITCHES
“He’s a detective... working for New Scotland Yard,” He sighed before making his way over to the edge of the bed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Doubtful it will be snow, John. It’s probably rain – if anything slush... it’s not cold enough to stick to the ground.”
“That sounds so lovely, John. I’ll be sure to try it the next time I eat breakfast.” He watched as John’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. “Was the bunny mean? Did it hurt you?”
OH MY GOD MY FUCKING HAND HURTS AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. A LITTLE INVISIBLE GREMLIN IS STABBING ME WITH A LITTLE INVISIBLE PIN.
My stomach is cramping and I'm about to have a baby... it must be Jesus!!
“I need you.”
When John didn’t say anything Mycroft continued to speak, “He wouldn’t be happy that I tried to assault you, but I didn’t. He knows I’m hurting and don’t exactly think like a normal person – though, I do a brilliant job of hiding that – he would just be proud at the fact that I changed my mind. No, I came up with something else. Some other way to hurt you, and that is why he’s never going to forgive me.” He hummed, standing up to pace around the room.
John stood outside the door of 221B Baker Street and waited for Sherlock. He was actually a bit worried he wasn’t going to show up and then what the hell would John do? But before he could doubt it anymore Sherlock climbed out of the cab and John grinned.
“No... You’re right. I’m sorry.” He swallowed hard and looked at the ground.
Sherlock swallowed hard and looked into John's eyes as he nodded slowly and forced a smile, “to the moon and back.” Tears filled his eyes and he leaned forward to kiss John's forehead. He forced the tears to go away because he needed to be strong for him right now. Now was not the time to let it out, nor the place.
Eventually, everyone was gone and John was left sitting on the pavement by himself. He slowly reached up to his neck, pulling out the necklace from under his shirt and wrapping his hand around the heart shaped locket that he never took off. Ever since Sherlock had wrapped it around his neck, the necklace had stayed there, he didn’t even take it off to shower… and yet he wanted to yank it off and throw it away and never see it again. He wanted to watch as the chain shattered and broke apart as he tore it off his neck, but... he didn’t because that was all that he had left of Sherlock. Sure, he had what was at the flat, but all of those things seemed so meaningless compared to the locket that was resting against his chest.
John lifted his head up and grinned at her, it was the first real smile he had shown in months, “Thanks. I’m slowly getting over his death... I think it’s always going to hurt and the pain is never going to go away, but it’s slowly getting more manageable...” He lied. In truth he came here because he was terrified he was going to do something stupid and break Sherlock’s promise. The trying to quit drinking was true, but he was in no way feeling better about Sherlock's death and that just filled him with confused feelings. On one hand, he was pissed off... he was sick of feeling sad and depressed and suicidal all the time. It just felt like every day that passed it got worse and worse, not better. And that made him so incredibly angry because Sherlock in no way, shape, or form, deserved his grief after what he chose to do. On the other hand, he was relieved because he felt like the second he felt better about Sherlock's death it meant that he didn’t care for the man anymore and he didn’t want to feel like that. As much as he knew that that wasn’t true, that’s what his brain kept telling him and he couldn’t help it. Getting over Sherlock's death would have been wonderful, he could love the man, and care for him, and remember the happy times without getting an overwhelming urge to follow him. He could speak highly of him and tell everyone of how amazing and great his former lover was. That no matter who he fell in love with in the future, Sherlock would always hold a special place in his heart – a place reserved only for Sherlock. Getting over Sherlock’s death would be the most beautiful thing that could possibly happen, and yet, his brain refused to let go.
Guys I am in the weirdest mood right now and I keep talking to myself and I feel like no one reads my notes anyway....
“Because it’s the only day I can do it... please! I’ll pay double!” He swallowed.
John gasped and then glared at him, "What the fuck!!" He narrowed his eyes.
John wanted to smirk because he knew Sherlock was lying, but Army John wouldn’t have known so he kept a blank face. “Ah, those are important...”
"Fuck..." He groaned and then snickered and pretended to cough, though really he didn’t have to pretend that hard, his throat was still aching. "Actually I'm sick!"
The man slowly closed the casket and Sherlock had to look away. He buried his face into John's shoulder and just focused on his breathing, if he didn’t he would pass out and that would be more traumatic than all of this already was.
“Because John... you do realise you can’t... Sebastian will kill you.” He said slowly.
The man hummed and nodded, “Oh, yes! I suppose you could say I’m his biggest fan, but unfortunately for me he would think of us as enemies – archenemies if you will.”
“No... No, sorry. Not that... is there a reason you don’t like anybody?”
My Mummy says I'm a Miracle.
Sherlock walked up to the side of the bridge and looked down at the water for a long moment. He just stared at the water until he finally broke down and started crying. He had a bottle in his hand and John could only assume that it was a bottle of alcohol. Oh Sherlock... Sherlock looked up at the sky and was screaming words that John couldn’t make out. He was too far away for John to read his lips.
John walked up the steps to the house and opened the door with his key that Sherlock had given him. He pushed opened the door and saw Sherlock sitting on the couch. John smiled brightly at him and put his bags on the floor as he ran up to Sherlock and hugged him tightly. “I’m so sorry, love! I had errands, but I’m home now and we can spend the remainder of the day together!” He hummed as he kissed Sherlock on the nose and smiled.
“BULLSHIT!” He screamed. He was practically shaking with anger, there was no sadness left in him, only anger. It should have scared him, perhaps in the past it would have scared him, but he had nothing left to give emotion wise. It was all engulfed by the anger that coursed through his body.
Sherlock chose the dog, John chose the car, and Lily chose the iron.
snickers.
“Tell me a story…” Sherlock whispered.
“Umm, it was dark and scary and then a silver bunny came into the room!” John snickered.
when his phone rang. He didn’t want to get his hopes up, but who else would be calling him at two in the morning. He answered his mobile without looking at the caller ID because he was pretty sure if he saw who it was, he wouldn’t have answered.
HIYA!! I UNDERSTAND THAT NEW COMERS WON'T KNOW SHIT BUT I ADDED A NOTE AT THE END ALMOST A YEAR AFTER THIS CHAPTER WAS POSTED! AWWWW YEY
Sherlock didn’t mind. John kept hitting the right spot and it felt so good. He could feel the pleasure building and building until he was coming all over his chest and it felt like he was falling, but also floating and it was such a beautiful and confusing feeling, but he didn’t care. He also may have been making noises, but he honestly couldn’t even tell anymore. Everything just faded away and all that mattered was John.
She nodded and seemed to understand what he meant, but John knew she didn’t.
Sherlock thought as he glared the gun down. If he was going to die he was not going to be frightened. Well, okay, let's be honest. He was terrified, but he would most certainly not let it show. He wouldn’t give Ted the satisfaction of the fear in his eyes as he pulled the trigger – as Sherlock's brain exploded onto the wall with the frightened look still on his face. He wouldn’t let Ted win this battle. He may have the satisfaction of killing him, but he would never –
break, not you! And I got that!” He growled, “You just happened to be the one he fell in love with so you got the repercussions of it.”
John snapped back to the real world and looked down at Sherlock, "Oh my god..." He choked out and started shaking. "Sherlock I–"
John ignored him and kept hitting his father. He kept punching him until his hand was bleeding and then he continued to punch him some more. He couldn’t even feel the pain in his hands as he heard the crack of bone under his knuckles. He only saw red, he honestly thought that was an expression. Apparently it was not.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at that, but waved it off and handed John's phone back. He was probably angry with Sherlock's forwardness or he was just in pain, “Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you.” He smiled some as he grabbed the coffee and turned around. He took a sip and grimaced because Molly’s coffee making skills were horrid, but he needed the caffeine. He had been up for three straight days and he was hoping he would be able to go to sleep tonight. He was so close to solving his current case. He went back to his microscope and then peered into the top, “How do you feel about the violin?”
Sherlock frowned because maybe he actually was trying to fix things... He slowly opened the letter and started to read, he wanted to go into his room for privacy, but he figured that would be a bit rude to his guests.
“Yes, well, forgot my... gloves.” He lied and quickly held up his gloves.
He swallowed thickly, but nodded slowly as he climbed back off the bed, “Okay...” He said quietly and kissed her head. He brushed her hair back and then left.
also i got a new job... at........ walmart..... XD where i work nine hours five days a week! So i'm very busy, but im also trying to get these to you as quick as i can!! i hope you understand!!
The DI sighed and closed his eyes, “Sherlock, I know it’s hard to accept that the one you love is a murderer. But we tested everything to make sure it was right before we brought him in. He’s in a holding cell right now, he kept screaming at me to call you, so I did. Even though I was certain you weren’t going to answer. He’ll be moved to the actual prison within the week.”
She sighed and scrubbed her face slightly, “He’s in pain. They won’t give him any medicine because of how he tried to kill himself – afraid he’s an addict or something, but yes, he’s fine.”
Sherlock sighed, but nodded because he knew if he were to tell John what awaited downstairs, he wouldn’t come. “Alright, come on.”
Thankfully the ride wasn’t a long one and soon the car was stopping. John opened his eyes and handed the cabbie a couple of pounds. He got out of the car and walked through the headstones until he found the onyx black one with golden lettering. Slowly, he sat down on the grass and stared at the headstone for a long time, looking over the lettering and letting the unbelievable sadness he felt wash over him. Usually he tamped it down, or drowned it out with alcohol, but today he let himself feel. Eventually, he reached out and traced his fingers over Sherlock's name – something he hadn’t ever been able to bring himself to do before. Something so simple… he was just touching lettering on a slab of stone, but it meant so much to him. He took a sharp breath as the tears prickled his eyes.
John glares up at him because he can't do this right now! “Your arse was around my cock. People say things they don't mean all the time because they let their dick control their brain.” He hums.
“Again... no.” He huffed and narrowed his eyes at him.
Sherlock blinked again. “Well, John, that’s silly… Obviously the floor is just going to give you a back ache and—“
“We’ll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o’clock. Sorry, I’ve got to dash... I think I may have left my riding crop in the mortuary...” He frowned a bit and headed for the door.
Sherlock flailed. “No!! Bad John!!! You’re marrying me! Not some stupid arse bunny!!” he growled.
John couldn’t help the tears that fell down his own face, Sherlock was never this desperate. Whatever Sherlock went through was awful, but they would get through it together like they always did, they would brave the storm and press on like soldiers, and John would always be by his side, “Always.”
She blinked a bit, “Yeah, of course it’s okay... Why wouldn’t it be? I’m Regan by the way.” She smiled softly and then ordered a Coke for him and a pint for herself.
“Yeah, I just had one drink. I went to a pub and met a girl... I think she might actually still be there so we should go! If you want to anyway...” He shifted slightly.
“Never know the secret...” He whispered loudly and closed his eyes. “Oh, it’s going to break Sherlock.” Sigar laughed and smiled, showing his bloody teeth. “My last gift to him... only this time it isn’t a lie.”
John felt as his mouth went even drier,
Something happened to Sherlock, that much was clear, and without knowing what it was it was hard to understand Sherlock's perspective on things. He was still so angry with Sherlock, so angry for what he did to him. He broke John, and John hated that he let himself stoop so low. He hated that one person had the ability to do that. He supposed though that it was also the situation of it all. It wasn’t just the fact Sherlock had died, it was the fact that he had watched it happen and he wasn’t able to stop it. He had been fine in the army, he had hurt for a while, yes, but he was able to move on. This time it was different though, it felt like he had failed and he couldn’t live with that.
John laughed a bit. “Alright. Hold on, you. I have to finish packing up my stuff.” He smiled as he put his pencils in his rucksack and slung it around to his shoulder. “Ready! Where do you want to go?” Sherlock just grinned more, if that was even possible, and ran out of the classroom. John had suspected that Sherlock would have been tugging him if the circumstances were different… One day he would come clean, but sadly that day was not today… or any time soon, really. It hurt him in a way to know that Sherlock wanted something so bad of him and he just wasn’t ready to give. He shook his head though, trying to clear that thought and sighed as he ran after the madman, because he would always run after him.
They stayed like that for a long time before finally John yawned. It was pretty late and he was tired. He pulled away slowly and looked at Sherlock. “There. Now I’m going to go sleep. You can take the bed… I’ll grab the floor.”
except for the fact that I wrote this two days ago so really i'm not listening to that song right now...
John heaved himself up and walked to the bathroom where he took off his pants and turned on the water. He got in and smiled as the water washed over his bruised and aching body.
He sat there as he read the newspaper, thinking everything over when his mobile started to ring. He frowned slightly and picked it up, “Mycroft Holmes.”
“Now would you like us to explore with you?” The Doctor smiled a bit.
“You are.... you can’t deny that John, no matter how hard you are trying to. You don’t have to do this, John... Let me go and I won’t arrest you... I’ll let you live with him and I will take care of whoever is asking you to do this job.”
Answer:
John laughed slightly and shook his head, “No, but I think you should be.” John dropped his cane and in one swift motion reached for the gun that he carried in the back of his trousers. He spun around and shot the two people in the car so they fell dead. He sighed and frowned a bit, “Pity... I was going to ask that woman out on a date.” He sighed and turned back to the man with an umbrella.
John frowned a bit because he didn’t even know what day it was, “what day is it?” he swallowed. He didn’t know how long he had been out.
. Mycroft swallowed and turned around as he watched John's face contort into pain, he placed his umbrella in front of him, stood up ramrod straight, and waited.
Sherlock yawned and smiled brightly. He kept his hand wrapped around them and the other wrapped around John as they both drifted off into a deep sleep.
John laughed and shook his head as he stepped forward, "Surprised you didn't catch on sooner. I took you to be a genius, Sherlock Holmes. Though, I guess in all fairness you were never once able to solve my crimes so it only made sense that you weren't able to solve this one either." He huffed.
Mrs. Hudson answers and smiles as she takes him into her arms. He smiles tightly and hugs her back. His brain is still whirling, but he does care about Sherlock so he needs to do this. He slowly pulls away and walks up the seventeen steps. He hasn’t seen or spoken to Sherlock since... their fight... yes, let’s call it a fight.
John cried out in pain and whimpered, "CLAIRE! GET OUT OF MY FUCKING HOUSE!!!"
hahahha five years later and i'm editing the damn chapters so I can finish updating this fic. anyway i hate mark and moffat for the shit show that is s4. So i am in no way like moffat. but i am evil. I gave myself some feels reading that. shit damn.
Three months later and John was sitting at the pub watching Claire pour drinks. He had taken to going to the pub at night so he wasn't so lonely, night was honestly the worst time for him. He never hooked up with anyone though... He wasn't ready, he honestly thought he never would be. And though he would never admit it to anyone, he was grateful Claire found him in the bathroom that day. She wasn't angry with him either which was surprising.
She screamed and punched him in the face, though it was rather weak. She didn’t want to hurt him – she was overcome with emotions, yes, but hurting him was not something she wanted to do. She choked on a sob and then hugged him tightly, “Why!” She sniffled.
John blinked at him for a minute because really? The fact that he seemed to think two weeks ago since they were intimate was equivalent to twenty minutes ago blew John's mind, but also you couldn’t even call what they did two weeks ago intimacy! “You didn’t even finish!” John growled, before taking a breath and calming himself down. “I think the whole meaning of a blow job is for me to actually have an orgasm!” He grumbled and crossed his arms over his chest, raising his eyebrow at Sherlock.
Sometimes things are not what they seem. You can think one thing about something or someone and then you find out you were completely wrong and everything you thought you knew is suddenly gone and nothing makes sense. John Watson is the perfect example of all of this. He knows how to play the game and he most definitely knows how to not get caught. Suppose that’s what makes him the best there is. John Watson isn’t a good man... in fact he’s the furthest you can be from a good man. John Watson is the best assassin in the United Kingdom and frankly if you were to ask John he would say the best in the world.
– actually no. We weren’t even fighting. You were the prick that destroyed me, telling me this relationship we have was all an experiment.” He hissed out and looked at Sherlock with a glare. “Doesn’t mean you need to be a prick about it all the time! Yes, I was going to tell them, but I obviously wasn’t ready! Thanks for throwing me into something I don’t want to do. And by the fucking way as soon as I woke up from my bloody coma I told you, so it wasn’t like I was keeping anything from you.” He snapped and then looked at his friends, “I’m joining the army and I leave exactly one week from today.” He said, deadpanned. He wasn’t happy about what Sherlock did because really… it wasn’t his fucking place. It may not have been as bad as outing someone for being gay, but still. It was something he needed to tell his friends and he was going to, he just needed time, but clearly Sherlock couldn’t even give that to him. As soon as the words to his friends were out of his mouth, he stood up and went to one of the toilets. He walked in and locked the door behind him. He wanted to lock the door to the whole loo, but unfortunately the bloody place didn’t have a door to begin with, just a curvy hallway for privacy. He didn’t plan on coming out until the bell rang, he could easily skip without missing anything in the class, what classes were going to give out assignments on the last day?
John frowned slightly and walked towards the kitchen, but Sherlock growled more, “Don’t come in here! I’m obviously busy!” He snapped and John froze slightly because this was not the Sherlock he remembered... not the Sherlock he remembered at all. He didn’t like this Sherlock one bit and he didn’t understand why Sherlock was being so mean. Sure, he thought John was dead and he had anger about that, but this… this just felt different.
Sherlock's phone started ringing loudly and he groaned, waking up from his deep sleep. He put the pillow over his head, but it would not stop shrieking. He hissed and was going to throw it against the wall, but John told him if he didn’t answer it and stop that god awful noise he was going to cut Sherlock's eyes out. Sherlock didn’t like the sound of that very much so he slowly rolled over and reached for it. His head was pounding and he was all crusty – he had no idea why and then suddenly everything came rushing back to him and he smiled a bit. It may have been a right mess, but they had a moment of some sort and that made Sherlock happy. He reached a hand up and touched the dog tags around his neck and then answered his phone. He kept his eyes shut as he heard Garrett blabbering on and on about some case. It seemed like it was in the middle of nowhere and he wasn’t really paying attention, but it wouldn’t be that hard to find. Sherlock eventually hung up the phone and shoved John out of the bed, “Wake up.” He grumbled and slowly stood up.
Sherlock just nodded numbly and followed John to the bedroom. They got ready for bed and John fell asleep almost instantly after saying goodnight. Sherlock couldn’t sleep at all, but he also didn’t blame John for falling asleep – they dealt with grief differently, he understood that. He slowly stood up and walked to his mother’s room. He climbed into bed with her and wrapped his arms around her thin body, so fragile Sherlock thought that maybe the wind could manage to break her bones.
Sherlock slowly looked up and swallowed, his eyes wet and puffy from the tears he had been shedding, “John’s not dead and now you’re dying! I’m probably going to lose John too, even though he’s not dead! Nothing is the same anymore… Why can't I just be happy?? He hates me, but I just–“
Sherlock whined and played with John's hand some more, “They almost didn’t let me ride in the ambulance with you… That was most certainly not acceptable.”
He hummed and leaned forward to kiss her cheek, honestly he hadn’t felt this happy in years, “Thank you, Love, but you are also wrong. Sherlock found his John, as you so wonderfully put it, now you just have to find yours.”
John decided to take a trip up to Scotland, he had never been before, but he had always wanted to go. It seemed like a good thing to do to get away and get his mind off of things. He supposed he really should be thinking about things, but then again there really was only one issue and it was out of his control. It was up to Sherlock whether he wanted to open up or not, but if he chose to not… John knew he couldn’t possibly continue on with this relationship, he had to let go no matter how much it hurt him to do so.
Sherlock groaned and rolled his eyes. "I'm already awake and we aren't doing anything, you don't need to act like an adolescent child."
“That I what…?” John blinked.
Sherlock smiled a bit and set the letter down. John was adorable and even though he was in danger he was at least safe now… or as safe as you could be. He smiled at his father who was smiling back at him, “Thank you.”
Aiden walked out of the flat, slamming the door behind him. Sherlock let out a breath of relief, that was one thing taken care of… Now to focus on the other issue at hand.
Sherlock was a moaning mess. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. It was a slight burn, but it was also so wonderful and so magical. He wondered if it would feel like this no matter who was doing it or if it was just more wonderful because it was John. He practically screamed when John hit the right spot. “Do that again!!” He said enthusiastically. And just like he asked John did it again, and again, and again. Because John knew how to please him and would always know how to please him. Even if it was a bit rough at the beginning. He would never leave John… he would stay with John for as long as John would have him because he loved this boy so much. He felt as John pulled out his fingers and then watched as he rolled a condom onto his erection.
Sherlock wanted to cry and wasn't that just tedious. He knew it wasn't a trick because John looked different... He held himself differently, his hair was slicked back, he wasn't in those ghastly jumpers... And for the first time Sherlock could actually deduce him... Assassin, parents left him when he was younger, miserable, lives in a mansion with slaves, Mike works with him, and so on... And then he realised that John was letting him see all that and it hurt him more than anything. John was showing him all of this to tell him it wasn't a trick... This was really happening right now and it terrified Sherlock. And then Sherlock got angry because he had loved this man. He had loved everything this man was, but the man he loved was fictional and wasn't there at all, "So everything we did – everything
Her heart filled with pride and she gave him a watery smile in return, “I’m proud of you, John... really.”
The rest of the funeral passed and once it was over John watched as they lowered the casket into the ground. He was angry that he didn't even get to see him... They usually let families see the body even if it's a closed casket funeral, but John didn't get to. He supposed it was because he wasn't family, but Mycroft didn't get to either so it didn’t really make sense. It didn't matter though... He couldn't bear looking at that face again without breaking and he had been so good not to break yet, a couple of tear drops did not count as breaking. And though his heart was completely broken, he himself had yet to crack. He honestly hated that in a way, but he didn’t want to give the bloody git satisfaction of seeing John break… so, he simply didn’t.
She sighed and handed them their drinks, “That I am, John... that I am.” She smiled softly.
“Sherlock!! So what happens when I get shot and your mum and Mycroft get shot as well?” He glared a bit. “Not to bloody well mention if you just have ‘this feeling’ why the fuck did you do it in the first place.” He was just so confused and he didn’t know what he wanted... he wanted to be mad at Sherlock, but he also wanted to rejoice that he still had him. He sighed heavily at the confusing thoughts running through his head. Perhaps this was heaven then. Though, John thought that if this was really heaven there wouldn’t be anything confusing about it. So that left that he was still alive and Sherlock was being reckless.
JoKe Of ThE cHaPtEr:
John searched the hospital for a few minutes before he found him out by the smoker’s area leaning up against the wall. John sighed and walked over to him, “You’re just temping yourself with things you can't have...” He said quietly as he grabbed Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it.
He walked into the kitchen with just pants on and smirked, even though he was staying at a motel he ended up spending a lot of time at Sherlock's, though lately it was becoming less and less. Sherlock was doing something on his microscope and he looked stunning, John really was just going to leave him alone and get some water, but he couldn’t help himself. He walked over to Sherlock and wrapped both of his arms around Sherlock’s waist while he kissed his neck softly, “Hi.” He hummed as he continued to kiss the taller boys neck.
Still, he couldn’t help but hope that Sherlock would call him, that he would finally give in and tell John everything, but the longer that time went on the more unlikely it seemed. He wanted to be the number one priority in Sherlock's life, because Sherlock was the number one priority in his, and perhaps he fooled himself into thinking that by leaving Sherlock would finally come to his bloody senses, but here he was. A week later. In a dodgy motel that didn’t have air conditioning, listening to the constant sounds of people shagging.
Three months after John’s death all of the stories were leaked. All of the people he killed were revealed and all of the cold cases that involved him were solved. After police had all the information on John Watson everyone considered him the best assassin in the world. He was known worldwide and was famous... and even though that wasn’t the best title to be remembered by... Mike knew that he would have loved it.
Sigar’s eyes snapped to his wife. “Yes..?” He said innocently like nothing had even happened.
“Controlling bitch,” John muttered under his breath, but Claire heard it anyway.
“Hello? John? Are you there because you’re not saying anything…”
“NO! No!! Look! I have it!” He shoved the money in his face.
“It’s John’s father! He’s- we don’t know how, but he’s escaped! He escaped a week ago, but I just got a call that-“
I don't know, but the flag is a big plus.
"I had to get out." He stated simply. "Sherlock was being annoying." He huffed, though there was no power behind it.
As soon as he left the house he quickly did a search on his phone and found out that the coaches name for their football team was Greg Lestrade. That was definitely close to Messpod, and even if it wasn’t the evidence was too much to not assume it was him. Sherlock had contacted the police and gave them an address explaining everything. As much as he hated to admit it he couldn’t do this on his own. He would beat them to the destination though seeing as he was closer. He felt his phone buzz and he quickly reached in and pulled it out.
!” He honestly didn’t think he would ever hear those words again. Never in his life. He would do anything for John, anything at all.
Sherlock's heart warmed because he had never had a friend before. John didn’t count in his brain because John was Sherlock's boyfriend, not actual friend. This was different and he loved it. “Thank you,” he whispered. He watched as Brian nodded and then left the house. He would tell John that they were friends now, but maybe it would be a better idea if he were to keep out Brian's actual feelings towards him. He didn’t like hiding things from John, but he knew nothing would ever happen between him and Brian and with John’s anger issues it was safer to just avoid the topic all together.
it makes! Over and over again until the night is over or until I open my god damn eyes and sometimes I still see it like a hologram in front of my face! Like some arse hat of a person set up a projector in my room just so I could see it when I wake up too. I used to wake up screaming his name, but now I just sleep through it because it’s happened so many fucking times that I’ve gotten used to it!" He spat. He grabbed the front of her shirt and pulled her close so he was practically touching her nose with his. "That flat is all I have of him. I don’t even have the fucking necklace with his stupid hair in it because I threw that across the cemetery like a fucking wanker. The. Flat. Is. All. I. Have. And I am
Brian ignored him and just kept going. “I chose you because I was angry with you, Sherlock. I’m pretty sure that I’m in love with you and I just needed to tell you. I know you are with John and I’m not asking you to leave him to come to me, god no. He’s my best friend, I would never do that to him… but I felt like you needed to know the reason behind everything. I know you always said I was when you deduced me so you most likely already knew, but I wanted you to know for sure. So… now that you know. Please also know that I will be there for you always. With whatever you need.”
Sherlock snickered and then looked at John who had gone a very bright shade of red, “Oh, Cakeman… You’re just jealous that you can’t get any action,” He snickered more and this made John's face go even redder than it was previously. Of course, all they did was snog a bit until Sherlock had his little panic attack, but Sherlock didn’t mind letting Mycroft think what he wanted. The dirtier he thought, the better it was for Sherlock. He wanted to haunt that man’s memories every day until he died.
"I LOVED YOU!!!" Sherlock screamed and his hand holding the gun started shaking.
“That... THAT BAD?” He cried. “John! It isn’t fair! Now you have to cut yours off!!!”
The man blew a sigh of relief, there was still a chance of Mr. Holmes turning him down, but at least they were getting somewhere, “John. Captain Watson. John Watson, sir.” The man on the other end finally got out, John had been a friend to him, he was having a hard time staying calm, but he was managing.
Sherlock swallowed hard. “What was him..?” He knew what Mycroft was talking about… of course he did. He was not a stupid boy, but he just hoped Mycroft would drop it.
The water rushed over him just like he wanted. He slowly sank down so that he was sitting and leaning back against the wall. That was his favourite part about the shower, the ability to sit down, but have the feeling of hot rain pouring over you. John let his eyes fall shut and he just forgot, he couldn’t tell you how long he was in there for, but by the time he got out he was bright red. This brought a smile to play on John's lips. Slowly, he wrapped a towel around him and stepped out into his room. John looked up and practically screamed as he saw Sherlock sprawled on his bed. He really wasn’t expecting Sherlock to be in here… In John's brain he seemed to have it in his mind that Sherlock hates him for what happened tonight.
She nodded as well, but then remembered he couldn’t see her, “Alright... go save the world, Sherlock Holmes.”
Claire came over to John and scoffed some, “Thank God she’s gone.”
John ended up at Sherlock’s old house with a tear stained, red face. He sniffled and knocked on the door, he could have gone back to his motel, but he didn’t exactly want to be alone right now. He didn’t even know who lived here, but he was hoping it was Mycroft or Lily. He was hurt and angry and he knew that Sherlock didn’t know about Miles, but that didn’t stop him from spitting out his name like Miles was John’s side lover.
John's eyes snapped open and he gasped, “Sherlock! I had the worst dream! You said that—“ He stopped abruptly when he realised it was Zack waking him up and not Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed heavily and followed him. He didn’t say anything, he didn’t know what he would say and he wasn’t really sure why he followed him. Perhaps he felt like the conversation wasn’t over even though John was resigning from it. He didn’t want John to end on a bad note he supposed.
John groaned, “Sherlock! I am used to sleeping on hard surfaces! Just please drop it and take the bed!”
“No! It’s not!! They can run around in the giant backyard that we will have and then at night they can all sleep in our room! And we would be old so if we had to get up to go to the bathroom the cats would guide us!” He sniffled.
“I think that’s rather the point…” Lestrade snickered.
“It would look a bit weird if I wasn’t here... don’t you think?” He tried to joke, but it just came out sounding dry.
Mycroft glared up at him from the ground, “I didn’t go through with it! And you’re one to bloody talk! You killed yourself and didn’t tell anyone you were alive, you practically destroyed John! You practically destroyed me.” The last sentence was whispered so quietly it was like a confession. Sherlock supposed it was. Mycroft would never had admitted that had the circumstances been different.
him. Rainbow trotted over to him and meowed quietly, sensing his owners distress. Sherlock sat down and slowly opened the letter as Rainbow jumped into his lap.
Sherlock smiled softly, he wanted to reach forward to grab John's hand, but he also didn’t know what lines were drawn in their boundaries right now, “I asked you what you were doing at Mycroft's house.”
“The little girl sobbed for days and days on end. She had a proper funeral for Bellfire even though nobody but her attended it. She didn't eat. She didn't sleep. And she didn't go out to pick cotton. She was alone in the world once again, but eventually she did get up. And she did go out and pick cotton. Because even though it hurt – Even though she didn't want to. She owed Bellfire that much.
John blinked. “Umm.. You’re welcome…?” He awkwardly wrapped his arms around this strange man that was hugging him and didn’t exactly know what to do.. Eventually the man pulled away and John awkwardly picked up
Soon John was dressed in one of his many thousand pound suits. He hummed and left the room going down to the basement, “Ah, hello Mr. Holmes.”
Knock Knock
He wrapped his arms around her and held her close for a long time. He drew in a deep breath and closed his eyes, “I had no other choice… please understand that." He said so quietly he wasn’t even sure she would hear him.
Sherlock sighed and scooted over as far as he could. “I promise you won’t because it is physically impossible for you to do that because your name is John Hamish Watson and as far as I know... it is physically impossible for John Hamish Watson’s to hurt me.” He smiled a bit at John and patted next to the bed.
“What? I told you, you aren’t coming!” John flailed around, he wasn’t about to add murder to his list of regrets. Granted, he wouldn’t have been the one to murder Sherlock, but if something did happen to Sherlock on the way home he wouldn’t ever be able to forgive himself.
The car pulled up to the house and John got out without a word. He needed a shower even though he wasn’t necessarily dirty and had just taken one before he ran out of the house, but he just needed to wash all the bad stuff away, watch it run down the drain and disappear forever. However, he knew that was impossible… He sighed as he went up to his room and went into the bathroom. He turned the faucet and stripped down to nothing. After a while the room filled with steam and he sighed happily as he made his way over to the shower and stepped inside.
After the first day of trying to ask Sherlock out again John had just given up. He told himself, and Sherlock, he wouldn’t give up easily… but he did in fact give up very easily. He couldn’t handle being laughed at and degraded though, not by the boy he loved anyway. He watched Sherlock all the time at school, but he didn’t text him anymore and he didn’t talk to him. Sometimes in chemistry it was really hard to not talk to Sherlock. He would just forget about everything and he would think of something that would make him laugh, something that him and Sherlock used to laugh about all the time. He would turn his head and open his mouth to speak to Sherlock and then, like a dam breaking and water bursting out and flooding everything, the memories came back. So he would shut his mouth slowly and turn back to his paper.
Sherlock swallowed some and was silent for a moment, “John... You have to tell me that you are going to keep your promise...”
the locket and then you can have something of mine to wear... I wear your dog tags every day and I never take them off, well I do to shower, but only because I don’t want them to rust. You can have my hair around your neck in a locket and you’ll be wearing a piece of me like I do with you. Like I said no one will know what’s inside except for you and I...” He smiled some and started to put on his shoes.
Sherlock glared at the wall and huffed, “Yes, well, she’s requesting to go home because she doesn’t want to die in a hospital bed. There
Sherlock sighed and didn’t look up from his book. They weren’t worth his time and he definitely didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of making him believe he was actually interested in what he had to say. He probably just came over to call him some names, push him around a bit, and then he would leave. He had John now so he didn’t care what they thought of him anymore. “Yes, Brian?” He sighed, with his nose still buried in the book.
He wanted to sob, he wanted to break down and beg for John's forgiveness, but John wasn’t even with him and why, why,
Mike swallowed and looked down at his feet, “No, suppose you can’t... or maybe you just haven’t opened yourself to the right person.”
Sherlock nodded once and smiled softly, “Right, of course. Is there–” He paused for a brief moment and took a breath before continuing on, “Is there anything you need?”
. Brian couldn’t stand the prick.
“You’re not explaining anything. You can tell me nothing that is actually worth listening to! You don’t know anything about this case at all and frankly I don’t even know how you got in here! But you are leaving now and you should be
Claire’s eyes widened as she realised what had just happened. She didn’t mean to snap at John like that, but she just hated this. She hated that Sherlock was doing this to John and she hated that John was hurting so much. She was trying to make it all better and instead she managed to make it worse, she knew if she didn’t act fast the consequences would be unfixable and she wouldn’t be able to forgive herself. Not only would she have lost a friend, but she would have let Sherlock down. She would have broken his heart and she knew it would only be a matter of time before he too took his own life, only this time it wouldn’t be pretend. God, she was a fucking idiot. She knew that he was just trying to get a rise out of her and it fucking worked. Jesus Christ she had failed everyone in all honesty, but there was still time to fix this.
Sherlock glared at John, "well, how do you think I feel!" Sherlock crossed his arms and pouted a bit.
“Sherlock, please just tell me,” John gave him the puppy dog eyes and Sherlock thought he looked adorable, once again.
UNTIL NEXT TIME BITCHES.
Lestrade eyed him carefully and then pursed his lips together, “come live with me.” He hummed. “You have nowhere to go and I am more than happy to lend you my house for the time being.”
“Oh! How rude of me! My name is Sherlock Holmes!” He hummed. “Now, John, how do cars work!!”
People often got confused between love and lust and Sherlock couldn’t wrap his brain around why Brian loved him when Sherlock had been mean to him all those years, but then again Brian could be like a John in which he actually liked how Sherlock could deduce and pick apart things just by looking at someone. He sort of thought it was a bit troublesome how Brian chose Sherlock's side instead of John's. Brian and John had been friends for years! John had even considered him one of his best friends at one point. Some best friend he was, ditching his mate when he was down. He just sighed and shook his head at the thought as he continued to walk home.
John swallowed and nodded slowly. He reached out of his burrito of warmth and grabbed the coat, sitting up and putting it on. John buried his face into the lapels and choked on a sob. It still smelled like him and it was too much, but not near enough at the same time. He looked up at Claire with watery eyes, but the tears didn’t fall, "I miss him so much... And it hasn't even been a full day yet..."
"John..." Claire whispered. "Please calm down..." She reached her hand out a little bit, something he could grab onto and support himself, but he ignored the offer.
Lily blinked and stared at Sherlock, “Oh my...”
Sherlock smiled softly and lifted his head up just a bit to kiss him deeply. He pulled away slightly after a moment and nuzzled to his cheek, “I love you, too. Now, let’s go home...”
and almost hurting Sherlock were one thing, but to now lay there and degrade women? That was unacceptable. Well, to be fair it all was unacceptable and all of it crossed a line, but John could only take so much at one point in time.
I had a chuckle bwahah
Claire wiped the tears off her face and just closed her eyes, hoping with everything she had that Sherlock was able to find John and bring him home. She had worked so hard to keep him safe the last two years, had always been there for him… talked him down when he needed it. It couldn’t end like this just because she had a slip up. She refused to let it.
“It’s a love story and they kiss in the rain… Except it’s at a lake and not in the middle of the street, but I’m sure that this is in a film somewhere!” He laughed, “anyway, The Notebook – well, It’s depressing, but then it ends happily... In a depressing sort of manner.” He frowned slightly as he cleared his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. So this was going somewhere… Mycroft gasped and put a hand on John's wrist. “Wait! John! What was the bunny’s name? I need a name John! And then you can go to sleep. I Promise.”
Mycroft's eyes were wide and he swallowed thickly. Why oh why was he so stupid! This was one of the few times he hadn’t called for backup because he honestly didn’t think he needed it! In all honesty he thought that John just lied about the military for a simple reason. Looking back now he realised that that was a rather stupid thought, but this man looked like he couldn’t hurt a fly. He just looked like a depressed middle aged man trying to fit in, oh how wrong he was. He tried to remain calm, but he was pretty sure his face was slipping.
"Please John, if you would let me explain..." He said quietly. "If there was another option I would have taken it, but–" Sherlock was once again interrupted by John plowing him to the ground and beating him on his chest weakly.
Sherlock started walking away and just shook his head, “Keep telling yourself that,” He growled.
Mycroft nodded and led the way to the dining room. They all sat in their assigned seating: Sigar and Lily at each end of the table, John and Sherlock on the left side, and Mycroft by himself on the right. One of the butlers brought out a bowl of soup as a starter. John smiled and ate it happily, even though it technically was lunch time and it felt like they were eating dinner, he was starving and didn’t mind. The food was also amazing, he was slightly annoyed Sherlock hadn’t given him meals like this the whole time, and they even had a butler?? Where had this butler been since John had lived there? In hiding?  However, he would take what he could get and not complain, he knew he was lucky he was even able to complain about these things. He would have never dreamed of this sort of thing happening to him, or anyone in his family for that matter. “This is absolutely wonderful! Who made this evenings meal?” He hummed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was him, wasn’t it…?” Mycroft asked after a long moment.
John blinked slightly, “You’re upset... Why?” When Sigar didn’t reply he decided to push more, “You regret your life choices and now you realise that I’m not going to leave this room without putting a bullet through your brain.”
GOD I HAVE TO PEE!!! anywayyyyy
His father laughed and walked over to him. He slowly handed him the letter and sat on the couch next to him. “Go ahead, read it, we’ll wait.” He said so softly.
“Fuck off.”  Sherlock growled and yanked out of John’s grip, Sherlock rarely swore out loud, and when he did it was because he was really not okay.
"John?" A voice startled John out of his thoughts and he almost dropped the vase he was holding.
John nodded slowly and for the rest of class didn’t speak to him. He wanted to cry again, but he was in the middle of class and he would not break down no matter how much he wanted to. The class seemed to drag on forever, John just wanted out so that he could go home... or to Zack's house. His father was in jail, sure, but John didn’t want to take the chance... and with Mycroft being the one to throw him in jail he didn’t know if that would stay or if Mycroft would set him free now that the experiment was over. Surely, Mycroft had to be in on it the whole time… and if he wasn’t he would definitely side with his brother.
Mycroft pursed his lips and swallowed. “Yes... but I’m sure he knows now... wherever he is... unless of course there is nothing after death and you’re just dead and cease to exist entirely—“ He realised then that Sherlock was giving him a strangled, pained look and that practically killed Mycroft. “Right,” He cleared his throat and looked down at John, “Time and a place...” He took a breath and was silent for a good ten minutes. Everything he wanted to ask on the tip of his tongue, but not quite sure how to broach the subject. “Why did you lie to him?”
JoKe Of ThE cHaPtEr:
The man groaned and shook his head, “I’ll give it to you if you give me the money, Sherlock! You know the rules!”
“I will as soon as you tell me what happened next…” He looked around the room and grabbed a pen. “Look I even have the controller to control the spinning right here, but you have to talk first.”
She clucked her tongue and shook her head once. "Sorry, love. You'll have to deal with the pain this time. Not so fun being in hospital when you don't have the drugs to ease your way, now is it?"
John laughed loudly and rolled his eyes again, “Answer me a question, please?” He waited until Mycroft nodded slowly and then he began, “How many times has Sherlock had an unsolved case?”
It was early afternoon when John walked through the door of Baker Street and frowned slightly as he saw Sherlock and a man he didn’t recognize sitting on the couch. Normally, John would just think it was a client, or perhaps Sherlock made a friend… However, they were
John swallowed hard and stayed where he was, he knew that if he got up and tried to stop Brian it would cause suspicion. He pushed his salad around some more, because he definitely wasn’t about to take another horrid bite, and just waited for Brian to return. However, before that happened someone was nudging at him and John looked up.
John swallowed hard and nodded, “Okay... I promise...” He did… god, help him he did. He didn’t know how long he could keep that promise for though.
He was lost in thought and then Sherlock was running out of the door yelling something about pink and John was so lost... He followed Sherlock and peered over the edge as Sherlock was tugging on his hair explaining everything and then John growled a bit under his breath once Sherlock was gone because the fucking cabby made a mistake! He wasn’t paying the cabby to sit on his lazy arse and do nothing! He was paying him to make sure nothing was out of place and that Sherlock wouldn’t find him, but apparently that was too hard for the poor little man with an aneurism.
Sherlock blinked and John looked away, "John...." He whispered, “Whatever gave you the impression that I was...”
you risk my life, risk my health, just because you wanted to be fucking selfish. How fucking dare you think that you can keep this from me and we can still manage to repair what fucked up relationship we still have.” He shook his head and gave a small laugh, but nothing about this was funny. He glared at Sherlock for a couple of seconds longer before storming out of the flat. He just needed air and some time... he didn’t know if he would ever go back to Sherlock, but he had a pretty good feeling he would – he couldn’t seem to stay away from the insufferable man. And John just hated the fact that Sherlock didn’t trust him enough to tell him things like this – or that’s how John felt anyway.
John also noticed the way he looked when he thought John wasn’t looking. He was fidgety, he was lost in thought, he had pained expressions on his face. Something had happened, he had gone through something, and he just wouldn’t tell John what it was.
Claire nodded slowly, knowing this question would probably come up, "As you would expect... Did he –  did he watch it happen..." She closed her eyes and prayed that he hadn't. John didn't tell her what happened, but it was all over the news... Everywhere she went it seemed like he was still there, but he really wasn’t. Sherlock was up and rising in his success and with Barts being such a monumental place, of course the news was going to cover it.
John blinked from the floor. “Where are you going..?”
“Sir, please! I think you will want this soldier because he kept asking about you and no one even knows who you are! I don’t know how
John just smiled sadly and then went to go pack a bag for the both of them, it was the least he could do for Sherlock. These next few weeks he wanted Sherlock to do as minimal work as possible.
anyway until next time.
“Sherlock… that was amazing! I don’t care if it is a ‘shot in the dark’ as you so wonderfully put it… I want to know if you got it right.” John said as he ran a little ahead of Sherlock and stopped in front of him before walking backwards.
Sherlock nodded slowly and wiped the tears off that had fallen on his cheeks. “I’m sorry... I’m not usually this emotional...”
John chuckled softly, “So impatient.” He smirked and then bent down and started mouthing at Sherlock half hard, clothed prick.
Mycroft's face hardened and his hand clenched on the umbrella, “So who are you really?”
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose before making his way over to the bed to lie down next to Sherlock, “Sherlock… two things. One, hedgehogs are most definitely not fluffy and two, I told you why it wouldn’t be a good idea to become exclusive.”
“Thank you so much!!” And with that he ran off to go explore the new world out in front of him.
“Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!!!” John groaned as they walked out of the house. He had been repeating the word ‘stupid’ for about a half hour.
Sherlock was in the middle of replying when the bell rang so he just stuffed the note in his pocket and smiled at John. “Ready to go to the special place?”
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COMMENT AND KUDOS AND SUBSCRIBE!! Literally you don’t have to subscribe or kudos, but I REALLY LOVE READING THE COMMENTS SO YOU SHOULD REALLY DO THAT! And you can even comment if you don’t have an account mwhahahaa isn’t life swell?
Sherlock stared numbly at the screen and then looked down into his lap, “This isn’t a dream... is it?”
John pursed his lips, “well then, I’ll die a rich, successful man.” He rolled his eyes. “Come on! Get on with it!” He was angry and he knew that this was something he needed to do... it was better to do it now when he was angry, than to do it when he was not. Mike just stood there are John growled more, “GET ON WITH IT!!!!” He screamed and then the sound of a gunshot filled the air. John stumbled back on the impact and frowned a bit. He looked down at his shoulder and blinked as he watched the blood pour out of his body. Strange... it didn’t hurt at- “MOTHER OF FUCKING GOD YOU SHOT ME IN THE FUCKING SHOULDER!!” ah, there it was. He screamed out in pain as he collapsed to the ground.
John choked on a sob and looked up at Sherlock. He didn’t want to do it... he didn’t want to do it ever, but he had no choice, “I’m sorry...” He whispered quietly and then pulled the trigger.
Knock Knock?
Okay guys... I had something serious to talk about here... AND NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER!!! faaaaacccccckkk. Sooooo anyway it ends on a cliff hanger.... terribly sorry about that... but am I really?!?! ((;
John wanted to scream and lunge across the table. Why were they just sitting back and letting this happen? It wasn’t right!! But it also wasn’t his place to do anything so he closed his eyes and counted to ten. Because Sherlock would be livid with him if he intervened and he already made Sherlock upset enough these days.
Sherlock was still standing on the sofa looking at the pictures he had drawn when he heard it. His eyes widened and he was completely shocked for a moment. He had no idea what to do, but then his legs finally caught up with his brain and he was running. He ran down the stairs and swung the door opened and then halted a bit as he saw the man with his hand raised about to knock on the door.
hehehehehehe
Sherlock walked through the doors and talked to the receptionist to see where his mother was staying. Once they got done talking he nodded and drug John to the second floor. Sherlock was slightly angry with himself as well, he came here for work all the time and didn’t even know his mother was in the same building, fighting for her life. John swallowed as Sherlock stopped in front of one of the doors; he slowly opened it, and then stepped inside. Sherlock let go of John's hand and made his way towards the bed slowly, he swallowed hard and sat down in a chair next to her bed as he reached out and grabbed her hand. She was sleeping so he didn’t want to wake her just yet. She needed her rest.
John swallowed thickly, looking down briefly before nodding and going up the stairs. Because what the woman didn’t know, was that he was the one who had put Sherlock through whatever it was he was going through. He was the cause for his short temper. He pushed the door opened once he climbed the seventeen steps, taking a deep breath before walking in. He frowned a bit when he didn’t see anybody in the flat, but then he realised that Sherlock had turned his chair to face the wall so that when he sat down in it his back was to the door. John smiled fondly at that, such a fucking drama queen.
“OVERREACTING? YOU THINK IM OVERREACTING?” He screamed as his hands clenched and unclenched by his side, “YOU’RE A FUCKING DRUG ADDICT!! SO PLEASE TELL ME HOW I AM OVERREACTING?”
“Sherlock! You are not! You didn’t know I was alive and I know that if you did know I was alive you wouldn’t have slept with him. I’m a bit angry that you did, but I have no right to be and I’m not going to leave just because you slept with him... Though, I’m angrier at the fact that it took you a week to stop, but I guess we never explicitly said we were still dating… just as long as you don't do it again – I mean if we start dating again that is.”
ooooooo next chapter is the meeting! bow chicka wow ow...
Brian was staring at Sherlock in complete shock before he finally snapped out of it and shoved Sherlock harder against the tree, “I am not a rainbow like you!!”
and these are all the daily important facts. you guys hate my notes dont you? WELL IM NEVER EVER GONNA STOP BITCHES!
“AMAZING!!”
He screamed out of frustration and then regretted it almost immediately when he realised he just used half of his remaining air. He closed his eyes and then wrapped both hands around the rock and brought it down with everything he had. His hands went through the window and his eyes snapped opened realising he had finally got it!
John shivered and thrusted five more times before coming as well, he didn’t make a sound, just let out a whiny breath. He whimpered and laid in bed limply, “That was brilliant – you are brilliant.” He hummed.
Sherlock looked up and blinked at John's scream. “What’s wrong?” he flailed, and sat up immediately, his voice filled with nothing but concern.
“Glad to see you made it just in time…” Sherlock drawled, clearly not happy with how close his life was to ending.
“You’ve been drinking...” Sherlock said slowly, a frown playing on his face. Had he really caused John to go drink? To slip into his father’s ways? The thought made him feel sick.
A silver haired man came into the room and he and Sherlock talked back and forth about some bloke named Anderson, but John wasn’t really paying that much attention. Before he knew what was happening the silver man left and Sherlock was running out the door, “Mrs. Hudson I won’t be home until later! John don’t wait up.” He hummed and then was out of the flat.
Sherlock was suddenly very grateful he chose to sit because he knew if he was standing his legs would have given out. He swallowed hard and felt like his whole world was crashing down around him, “What....” His voice cracked a bit and he just looked at John with a pained expression. John had known this for two weeks and didn’t bother bringing it up once! What if she didn’t have that long and since John was holding it off – what if she died! “Is – is she going to be okay..? It’s treatable right... There’s still a chance for her?” He swallowed hard and looked at John with so much hope. He couldn’t lose her... she was his everything even if he wasn’t there for her as much as he should have been. Or there for her at all within the last five years.
“What!!!” He screeched as he turned around to face his brother, “Mycroft, that isn’t fair!! He’s being mean! Why does he even want you! I’m his boy—“
Mycroft was tied up to the wall and was being forced to kneel.
to let them win.”
Sherlock walks right up to John and shoves him up against the wall, “Feel familiar? Oh wait... I remember. You weren’t in this position last time, were you? I know why don't we switch roles?” He clears his throat and makes it go a tiny bit higher, “’Oh my god.... Sherlock... you’re so tight!’” He groans softly. “’I’m sorry... I’m so sorry!! I love you so much... you just made me so angry when you left and now you’re back and I promise never to leave you again... I’ll move back into Baker Street and we can be together just like before!’” Sherlock whimpers and then everything slips away and his eyes harden.
“It’s your fucking chair, Sherlock! You should bloody well sit in it!” he snapped and put the paper down, casting his glare at Sherlock. This wasn’t about the chair, they both knew it wasn’t about the chair. It was about last night – well, and all the other times John had asked. The conversation still hanging fresh in his mind, they all did really, but last night seemed to weigh more heavily on him.
Sherlock came over and sat next to John as they ate ice cream. John had already been watching the movie, but gladly restarted it when Sherlock arrived. John didn’t hold him like he said he would, but Sherlock didn’t mind, he still wasn’t sure he liked being touched even though it was John. By the end of it Sherlock was sobbing, but somehow John managed to keep it together. John wondered if it was because he felt like he couldn’t cry in front of Sherlock because he needed to stay strong for him or because he had cried so much he just didn’t have anything else left in him. He wanted to believe it was the former, but John was pretty sure it was the latter option and that made him feel pathetic once again. Perhaps though, he just didn’t care anymore, he had no more tears to shed for the man sitting next to him, and that option was actually rather appealing. He looked at Sherlock once the credits started rolling and took a breath.
“No, not water! How much alcohol have you had? Any drugs you have taken… Anything..”
A couple of weeks passed and John was trying... he was really trying, but Brian was insufferable and if John tried to talk to Sherlock about it he just ignored him or told him not to worry. John didn’t understand why Sherlock wouldn’t listen to him and that hurt him a bit, but he supposed he would have to earn Sherlock’s trust back. Either way, he wasn’t even living in the flat and Brian was still insufferable. He did see parts of the old Sherlock though, so he thought that this could actually work and maybe that was the reason why he was even trying in the first place.
The anger washed over John again and dammit all to hell counting backwards from ten wasn’t working this time! His mobile started to vibrate in his pocket and this just made him even more angry and anxious and agitated because he wasn’t about to answer it and the constant buzzing was pissing him off! He decided to step in and put an end to… well to whatever
“Because she thought you sounded beautiful! Plus, she helped me with my problems and most of my problems revolve around you soooo...” John smirked at him and held his hand softly.
Sherlock hummed softly as John continued to kiss down his body and gasped when John grabbed the waistband of Sherlock's pants with his teeth and pulled them back before letting go, so that they snapped back against his skin. He whined and thrusted his hips into John's face, how rude of him to snap his skin and not touch him as soon as possible to make up for it.
WHAT AM I EVEN SAYING?
"’You'll know...’ The fairy whispered again and coughed. ‘Goodbye, River.’ She said softly and then passed away.“ Sherlock gasped as a random bolt of pain ran through his body. He placed his hand over John's and just breathed for a moment. He could finish the story, he had to. He would not leave John like this. He looked up at John with glazed over eyes and continued once again.
“You’re just angry because one of your mistresses left you. The one in Paris, might I add, and that happened to be your favourite one. So don’t go taking it out on me.” Sherlock mumbled while looking down. John knew that Sherlock could have fought back more if he wanted to, but at least he wasn’t sitting back and taking it…
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
Sherlock and DI Garrett were talking, but he didn’t hear anything they were saying. His mind whirling with so many thoughts that it didn’t finally shut up until they were already in the cab and Sherlock directed a question to him.
“Okay.” Was all he said before hanging up the phone. He didn’t want Sherlock to tell him over the phone, it needed to be in person.
An older woman answered and she smiled brightly at him, “Oh! You must be a client!” She hummed happily. “He’s upstairs. Just walk in and keep in mind that if he yells at you, it’s with good intention. Poor boy has been through so much.” She sighed, staring wistfully at the stairs. She didn’t know why she was telling John this, but he looked like a nice man and she didn’t want him to run out looking terrified or upset like most of Sherlock’s clients did. Sherlock was unbearable when a client ran out on him and since there was no one around Mrs. Hudson was the one to get an ear full. Though, she would probably run out too if she hadn’t known him like she did.
Sherlock waited for John to do something, but apparently John was incredibly slow with signals. That was okay though because Sherlock liked him no matter what. Which, in a way, was very weird to him because in any normal circumstances he would not be okay with slow people… John was different though. He slowly pulled back just a little and ran his fingers across John's jaw line and then under his chin. He tilted his chin up and looked into John's eyes and slowly leaned forward until his lips brushed up against John's. Sherlock smiled a little to himself when John made a cute whimpering noise. He liked that he could catch John off guard– even if he did think that his signs were the most obvious signs in the world and that even a blind man could have noticed what Sherlock was about to do.
In case you were wondering I just put it in my mouth and it was delicious.
“There was another way, Sherlock...” He glared at the floor, finding one of the tile pieces exceptionally interesting.
Sherlock swallowed hard and tried to wiggle away, but Lestrade just pinned him harder to the point where it hurt his wrists. He watched with horror as Lestrade stopped pinning his wrists at his side and pulled them together above his head so that he could grab them with one hand while continuing with the buttons on his shirt with his other hand. Sherlock started thrashing, with each button that he opened Sherlock realised the situation was becoming more and more dire, and less likely that Mycroft would get there in time to save him.
“Give me the address and a gun.” John growled and stood up.
The person that grabbed him laughed as he picked John up when he tried to wiggle away, “Not going to happen.” He hummed.
John was snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the figure that entered the room. He was about to tell him off for not calling him ‘sir’, but he realised that it was Mike. He relaxed some, but still had a tight hold and his gun because was angry and hurt about the memory he relived. “Ah, Mike!” he stood up and then threw the gun at Mike.
John bit his lip and even though he was completely smashed, he did feel a bit bad. “Okay… okay... Go away duck!” He hummed and just watched Sherlock, who had his eyes closed. He waited a moment and then smiled as he started to pick up the blanket off the floor. “It’s gone, love. Now, come here.” He said softly.
I HAVENT SLEPT IN EIGHT DAYS--- Oh my gosh!! EIGHT IS A MAGICAL NUMBER IN THIS CHAPTER AND I DIDNT EVEN MEAN TO DO THAT! IT'S A SIGN! *Me from the future.... hello. How the fuck is eight a magical number in this chapter... bwahah oh wait.. figured it out... not sure if that's magical or not but okay me...*
John grinned, “I want to take you, Sherlock Holmes, out on a date! We’ll dress up and go to a nice restaurant. I have enough money saved up for that!” He smiled. “And besides we have been going out for a long time now and I haven’t once taken you on a date! That just simply will not do!”
“He was lonely!” The Doctor protested and huffed. ”Some people don’t know how to deal with that sort of thing.”
usually I have loads to talk about, but I'm tired and listening to a johnlock playlist and I'm going to go cry....
John stared down at the plastic fork and glared at it, like it had personally offended him. “One of these days...” He said slowly, “I’m going to succeed and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.” He mumbled and picked up his plastic fork.
Fourteen hours later Mycroft was running into the hospital, demanding where John was being kept. He had to – needed to – find out as soon as possible if the man they actually brought in was John or not, for the sake of him and his brother. He ran to the room they had told him and stood outside the door, waiting for something – anything. He didn’t want to open the door because if it wasn’t John behind them he didn’t know what he would do... however, if he didn’t open the door he would never know, and then he could never make the caller pay for his actions. He swallowed down his fear, straightened up his posture, and slowly opened the door. Which was silly really, no matter who was lying in that bed they were most certainly asleep, recovering from the gruelling surgery. Still, a better posture was more superior than a slumped one. He looked around the room, taking everything in, before looking towards the bed, what he saw made his heart ache. John laid on the bed with a breathing tube down his throat and a bunch of other machines hooked up to him. Mycroft wasn’t an expert in medicine, but he knew these machines were keeping him alive. There were even more hooked to him than when he was in a coma and at the time Mycroft thought that was impossible.
They talked for what felt like hours and the more John spoke with her the more he wanted to take her home. He didn’t know what it was still... maybe it was because she was the opposite of what Sherlock was. Or maybe it was just the fact that he was incredibly lonely and craved to be touched by someone, it didn’t matter who he just wanted that feeling. Or maybe it was the fact that he was finally moving on, finally letting go and all it took was letting someone else help him ease the pain. Perhaps, he wasn’t even gay at all – maybe he was bisexual and just didn’t realise it until the right girl came around because he was more attracted to men? Still, if he needed someone to help him move on, why not take up the option? Obviously this girl couldn’t ease John’s pain in one night seeing as they barely met, but he figured that in time she would be able to help him and that gave him that sliver of hope that he needed.
put me through!” He hissed, jabbing his finger forward, as if to accuse John of everything.
The man known as Aidan pipped up and hummed, “Three days! I know it’s soon, but isn’t he just so handsome?” He sung and kissed Sherlock on the cheek.
“John, I have not asked you for a lot in this life. I like to think I’m a pretty mellow boyfriend. Sometimes I can be a tad difficult, but I have never wanted anything as much as I want you to kiss me right now… Please. I am begging you, I have begged you, and we both know that that is something I don’t do.” Sherlock struggled to get all of that out, but he finally managed and he was proud of himself.
John knew he was messed up and he knew he had a problem. It kept him awake most nights in all honesty because the smell and taste of blood should not be something that he got off on, but he did. It wasn’t something anyone, but mental people got off on and that made him feel broken. Growing up was hard because he felt so lost with the things he felt and the things he wanted to do, but he couldn’t help feel this way. It was like an itch and it wouldn’t go away unless he gave into it, so he compromised... He only tortured and killed people that other people wanted dead, granted it wasn’t a good compromise, but it was a compromise nonetheless.
DEUCES BITCHES!
John took it and frowned, “Hell, no.” He grumbled as he looked at the locket. It was a silver heart shaped locket with a chain, the chain was nice and thin and would be easy and comfortable to wear. On the left side of the heart however were the words ‘I love you’ written in cursive. On the right side was a little pink flower, it was very girly and John wasn’t going to be caught dead wearing this. Because that is exactly what would happen. He would die and the paramedics would take off his shirt and they would see it and he wouldn’t even be able to defend his actions because he would be dead. Not a chance.
“Why...” John said back, refusing to accept that this was actually happening. “You can tell him yourself.”
“Well I could ask you the same exact question… tell me does your girlfriend know you are cheating on her?” Sherlock drawled, as he smoothed out the sleeve of his shirt where Anderson had yanked him.
Sherlock sighed and glared at the wall a bit as he pet the sleeping Rainbow, who was curled up in his lap, “Twelve o’ one.” He growled. “I said if you were one minute late I wouldn’t take you and yet here you are. One. Minute. Late.” He drawled out, but there was a harsh bite to it.
Brian frowned a bit and Zach perked up, “tell us what?”
John was silent for a long time because Sherlock's words just made him cry more and he wasn’t about to let Sherlock hear that. He didn’t understand why this was happening to them, but it was and they had to get through it. Though, John wasn’t sure he wanted to at this point, especially when Sherlock had just told him he would never be able to forgive him, but before he could stop himself he found the words tumbling out of his mouth. Curse his brain for betraying him once again. “I’m staying at the hotel down the street, room 323… come see me. I don’t care if you don’t want to, just come see me for two hours. I’ll put on The Notebook like I promised in my letters that I would and I will hold you in my arms as we watch the movie. Then after you can leave, or you can stay, but ultimately the decision comes down to you, Sherlock.” He paused, “though, I’m going to be honest with you. I’m not sure I want this to work out, but what kind of man would I be if I just walked away when it got hard? The fact that you said you don’t think you’ll ever be able to forgive me, is honestly so cruel. Not trying to throw a pity party here, but I definitely had it worse. I would gladly take thinking you were dead, over not knowing what happened. None of this was my fault, not a single bit of it, so you blaming me is extremely childish. But like I said, come over and we can try to make this work, if that’s what you want.”
Sherlock stood up as well and grinned. “Hello! What’s your name? Can you tell me how cars work?”
save John. He would. He skipped steps... Thankfully, the scene was safe, but he couldn’t call 999 because his bloody mobile was broken! He tried screaming, but he didn’t think anyone was around, but his brain wasn’t working properly so he supposed there could be. It was London after all and people went for walks at night. Surely, someone had heard the commotion of a car falling into the Thames.
Sherlock was feeling so many things and he didn’t know how to express any of them. He growled a bit and jutted his jaw forward, “You- What the actual fuck! You just left me!”
Roses are red.
Literally I am a terrible human as it has been longer than a year! most of you probably assumed I abandoned this, but I did not.... I stopped writing for a while because... well I lost all my work and I was very bitter and angry. BUT WE'RE BACK NOW!!! AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU GUYS. I hope to jesus that my readers didn't give up on me ;-;
“Yes…. and no….” He smirked a bit.
.” He snapped, not meaning it, but trying to make her angry so she would just leave him alone. “And right now you want me to stay because of some sick...
John swallowed thickly, “Stop avoiding it and just fucking shoot me!” He hissed.
The next day there was a knock at the door. Claire waited for John to get up and answer it because this wasn’t her flat, but when it was obvious he wasn’t going to do that she sighed heavily and went to the door.
John groaned, “Sherlock, where are we going!? It looks like it’s going to snow soon! It never snows and when it does I would much rather be inside than outside.”
“THE DUCK, JOHN! WHERE?”
to know. John ended up with a small amount on his finger and then carefully stuck out his tongue to taste the substance that was on his finger. Really, how stupid was he? This was Sherlock they were talking about, the man of chemical experiments and here John was just... eating some unknown solid... He was going to die one of these days, and his own stupidity would be the cause.
“You’ll learn to love it.” Sherlock smirked and started to walk out of the shop. “No one will ever even know it’s there.”
John sighs and tries to wiggle away, but Sherlock's grip is too strong, “No, I’m saying that once upon a time I could have meant it, but now it means nothing to me.” He shrugs and then suddenly warm, wet lips are on his. He kisses back for three seconds before he’s turning his head to the side, “Sherlock stop!” He swallows and squeezes his eyes shut.
He waited a moment and frowned when she didn’t open her eyes. He nudged her a bit harder, “Mother. It’s morning... you need to take you pills.” He said in a shaky voice, trying to be firm, but failing. Still she didn’t move and that terrified him. He took a deep breath and with trembling fingers and wet eyes he slowly curled his fingers around her wrist to check for a pulse... when there wasn’t one, he broke down.
He was currently sitting on the couch staring at his phone when Sherlock came into the room and plopped down in his chair, “Bored!” He groaned.
“I put you in the back for a reason, John! Now stay down!” He said firmly and groaned a bit. “And not particularly, but it really can’t be that hard.”
“Of course…” John echoed back with a grim smile on his face. Mycroft didn’t seem to have any weapons, so this most likely wasn’t about torture, besides he didn’t really see Mycroft as the torture kind. Didn’t like to get his hands dirty, that’s most likely why he couldn’t go through with the rape, or whatever. “So… why is Sherlock going to hate you?” He drawled back at him when it was clear Mycroft wasn’t going to elaborate.
go it would cause suspicion… He took a shaky breath and stood up as he made his way over to the tree, just as Brian ripped the book from Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock held the squirrel and then walked over to John. He went to the edge of the bed and sat next to him. “I feel like…” Sherlock furrowed his brow because he didn’t really know how he felt. He just wanted to be close to John! “I feel like I want to touch you…”
He didn’t want to let it slide, but he didn’t have any other choice. He couldn’t blame John for what happened, however, he did for the longest time, but now he realised that this wasn’t John's fault... he did what he had to do, what he
Lily yawned and squeezed his hand, “It’s late. Come back tomorrow? And do me a favour, try your hardest not to push John away and yell at him. He can only take so much, love.”
Sherlock started throwing on his clothes as he listened to her speak, he didn’t even care if he didn’t match, he just needed to get to John. “How long ago did he leave?” He waited for an answer, but when she just sobbed in response he growled at her, “HOW LONG AGO DID HE LEAVE, CLAIRE!!” He screamed, demanding an answer from her.
“Sherlock...” he whispered quietly and didn’t speak for a long time, “I love you... do you know that?”
Sigar sighed and shook his head, “Despite what people think I do have some form of respect. I knew that you would hurt with him not writing you back and I knew each letter would become more and more personal. That’s private... so, no, I didn’t read them.”
Sherlock frowned deeply as he stumbled back and took a shaky breath, raking his brain for the next question to ask. How was this
John right this second or he was going to implode! “John. I really need you to move, please.” He groaned and rolled his hips.
Sherlock was silent on the other end. He felt like his world was crashing down and he had no idea what to do, or what to say for that matter... He whimpered slightly and tried to make some words come out, but failed.
John nodded. He wasn’t usually hungry in the morning, but they hadn’t eaten anything at all yesterday so his stomach was angry with him. John sat up and frowned as he looked down at his jumper and skinny jeans. He hated sleeping in clothes and he
Mycroft resisted the urge to sigh. He started thinking of all the brick buildings where John could have snuck into that had a ‘thing’ in it that he could sleep under. Unfortunately, ‘thing’ could be meant as a lot of things. “What happened next..?” He needed more data.
Mycroft's eyes widened and then his face hardened like stone, his jaw clenching, “you do realise it is illegal to prank call the government. Not only that, but I can trace your call and have you, and everyone else involved, arrested!” He sneered, no he wasn’t Sherlock, but he still cared deeply for the boy. He didn’t show it, but the news of John's death hit Mycroft harder than he ever thought possible.
“Actually I did. I uncovered everything there is to know about John Watson. I picked him apart one by one and then I glued him back together only to break him down again to the point where there was absolutely no fixing him.” His lips turned into a creepy smile, his eyes were wide and manic.
also also im like so sick so thats legit and you all should love me.
Question:
Question:
“Harry is short for Harriet. She’s my sister not my brother.”
They sat down at Ed’s Diner and ordered breakfast. John had eggs and toast with bacon, while Lestrade just had a coffee. He claimed to have already eaten before work, which was a perfectly reasonable claim so John didn’t question it. They talked for a while about nothing and then finally John felt comfortable enough to tell him everything… It felt so good to tell someone all of the things he was feeling. How his father kicked him out for being gay, how he got kicked out of Sherlock's house and how he had nowhere to go. He told Lestrade everything as he ate his breakfast and sipped his orange juice.
“He’s heartbroken... though he tries not to show it and he’s starting to find comfort in me.” He said some as he sifted through his closet, looking for a reasonable suit to wear. He started to strip and Mike sighed.
mean something.” Nope. No. This wasn’t happening. It was just some sick nightmare that John couldn’t seem to wake up from. Sherlock wouldn’t do this to him. He just wouldn’t.
Yes, John had avoided actually hitting him after they had tumbled down the hill, but he was screaming things. Awful things… and all because he wanted to make a show for his so called ‘friends’. Sherlock growled to himself as he turned off the sink. Why would John want to impress those people anyway? What kind of people would want to hang out with others that got off on violence? No, he would go home. He would let them win, but only because he needed time alone, time to think. And even though it made him livid and angry and he was so very stupid for it. He had already forgiven John. Sure, he was mad at him, he was madder than hell, but he had forgiven him and that’s all that mattered.
The woman’s eyes widened and she started to weep as she took the man into her arms, “My baby...” She whimpered.
“Nonsense! Just until you get back on your feet John. Come on! We can go right now.” He smiled happily and paid for the bill.
John kissed down his neck, to his chest, before shimmying out of his pants. Honestly, he had just been exhausted, but they hadn’t been intimate since before Sherlock's mum had died. If this is what Sherlock needed to feel comfort, he was going to give it to him with everything in his being.
. It felt nothing like how it did when he was with Brian and he wanted it to last forever. He kept moving his head up and down and swirling his tongue around the top, but then his mobile beeped and he pulled off of John completely to look at it. He sighed a bit and stood up. “Sorry, but I must go.” He walked over to the coat stand to put on his coat and scarf. “Make yourself at home, I probably won’t be home until late – if at all. It was good to see you again, John.” He hummed slightly and then he was running out the door.
. What sort of boyfriend was John if he left him at a time like this?? He had been a bit of a dick to John, but he knew John didn’t take it personally. He secretly hoped John would run to him and wrap his arms around him and tell him everything was going to be okay, but when he heard the footsteps running away he knew that that wasn’t going to be the case… He went inside and sulked on the couch.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he clenched the phone tightly, “Claire...” he whispered, because he was positive that she was calling because the worst possible thing had happened. He was so close to being done, but now he was too late, John had gone and offed himself.
Sherlock took a deep breath and let go of John’s hand, “He wants to see the video’s...”
“It’s basically like you just stepped into another dimension.” He explained and grinned. “The police box is just a camouflage. It doesn’t really look like that.”
This was in no means going to be rushed by either of them. John wanted it to be slow and loving and sweet and judging by how slow Sherlock's hand was moving around the both of them he was thinking the same thing. After a moment Sherlock pulled away and rolled over a tad so he could reach into the drawer beside him. He pulled out the lube, but left the condoms because this was their last time and they were both clean. John watched as Sherlock poured the lube and then brought the hand behind him to prepare himself, but John stilled him. Sherlock gave John a rather frightened look because he was afraid he did something wrong and he wanted this to be perfect, but John just tugged on Sherlock's wrist until his fingers were brushing against John's entrance. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel like his heart swelled and broke at the same exact time because out of all the times they had sex John never once bottomed. It wasn’t that he was never going to, but he wasn’t ready and Sherlock could see that. He never wanted John to feel pressured and he liked the feeling of John inside of him anyway. He raised an eyebrow at the blond, but John just nodded and lifted his leg so that it draped against Sherlock's waist.
Sherlock's heart shattered, this was so much worse than John breaking up with him, “wh-what... John, are you insane?! You’ll die!!”
"FATHER STOP!!" John faintly heard Harry's raspy voice call from somewhere in the distance, "I- I have a girlfriend! Her name is Clara! I love her and I'm planning to run away with her!"
In this (J)l
The man groaned a bit and shifted. His leg was fine… well as fine as it could be. However, his shoulder was killing him. He landed on it and for the average person that would most likely be okay, but for this man it was not. “Yeah, fine.” He shuffled a bit and tried to stand up, but Sherlock pushed him back down a bit.
at the very least. You can’t possibly lock him away for that.”
Sherlock blinked a bit and frowned, but kissed John back nonetheless. He didn’t understand John most of the time and that should have drove him up the wall because he hated not knowing things, but truthfully... it just made him fall more in love... something he didn’t even think he was capable of, but now here was John standing in front of him, kissing him softly and lovingly even after everything that had happened between them. Just like that none of this mattered anymore because they had each other and that was the most important thing for them in that moment.
Sherlock swallowed and finally pulled away slightly. He leaned back in and kissed the top of her head, “Bye...” He whispered. He looked at the man and nodded once before walking a bit away from the casket and sitting down.
Joke 1:
damn john is one sassy motherfucker. i actually love the fact that john is so evil someone save me.
Which in turn made Sherlock shiver and then roll John over a bit so that they were both on their sides. He brought his hand up to John's hair and brushed it out of his face, even though John's hair was fairly short. He wasn’t going to say anything and it was clear John wasn’t either, but sometimes actions spoke louder than words. He swallowed hard and kissed down John's neck as he slowly slid his hand down John's back to hook his finger under John's pants. He pulled back a bit to look into John's eyes because he didn’t want to do anything John didn’t want... no matter how badly he wanted it.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment, “All things end, love. I’m-“ He took a shaky breath and kissed the top of John’s head, “I’m not really here, but I need you to stay strong for me. Can you do that?”
Mycroft swallowed hard and slowly walked over to sit next to his little brother. “Well, if he doesn’t wake up...” Mycroft pursed his lips because neither of them were religious and he hated the whole speech about how he’s ‘in a better place now’. It just made both of them just feel worse and he certainly didn’t want to cause his brother more pain. “Well, it means you were too late Sherlock, but you can’t blame yourself... You did everything you could to save this boy and he knows that... but what you did might not be enough...” He swallowed hard. “Life is shit sometimes, but you just have to keep moving forward and look for the beautiful things in it.”
Sherlock screamed and tackled him to the floor. “YOU TRIED TO RAPE MY BOYFRIEND!!!” Sherlock started hitting him, but Lestrade was a lot stronger and flipped them over, pinning Sherlock to the ground.
But unle(S) you want to suffer
Sherlock only told John to leave because he was about to break down and he didn’t want John to see that, he had seen enough of that. The door slowly shut and Sherlock rested his head on the edge of the bed and sobbed. He tried to be quiet because he didn’t want to wake his mother. She needed her sleep, but she happened to wake up anyway.
“You will be… I can almost guarantee it…” He had to make his walking slower because John wasn’t a very fast walker, especially when he was walking backwards.
Though, it seemed he didn’t need to because Sherlock knew what he wanted to ask, Sherlock always seemed to know what he wanted to ask without having to voice it. “They found me before it was too late... I didn’t wake up for two days and once I did they took me to a rehabilitation centre – it obviously didn’t work, but they tried... and I stopped trying to kill myself so I suppose they did accomplish something.” He took a deep breath, “Still... I have those thoughts sometimes... even still, and I know I shouldn’t because I have you, but… it’s not the same. We both know that.”
a difference. Now, here is what you are going to do. You’re going to go back home and pretend like nothing is wrong. You’re doing a shit job, Sherlock, and I’m not happy. And trust me you don’t want to see me unhappy. And actually you not even remembering who I am is making me quite upset, Sherlock.” The voice drawled, squeezing his fingers tips so hard into Sherlock they were sure to leave bruises.
Sherlock huffed, “that’s it?” He rolled his eyes, “Also you sound pleased about that so my guess is you didn’t like your brother anyway.”
“Sherlock, I’m sorry! We couldn’t find him and I didn’t want to worry you, but I just got a call that someone saw him for the first time in a week! He’s finally on the move again and that worries me... I fear he might....” Mycroft trailed off because he didn’t want to tell Sherlock something that Sherlock most likely already knew.
. How could you smile at a time like this? “You look like shite. Let me buy you a drink and you can tell me all of your problems.” The voice sung.
John woke up a day later in his bed. His bed was giant and made of the softest sheets he ever had the pleasure to touch. John loved his bed more than anything and it was actually the only reason he ever actually slept. He groaned a bit, slowly opened his eyes, and saw Mike sitting in one of his chairs in the corner of the room.
“Stop it! You aren’t fine! Shut up. Just—“
Anyway there are a few things you need to know... Primark is basically a Walmart in Britian.... except for... they only have super cheap clothes.. they don't have movies slash games slash food... Just clothes.. So maybe Walmart isn't a good example... Primark is like.. Like.. WELL ITS A REALLY CHEAP STORE THAT HAS A BUNCH OF CLOTHES AND ACCESSORIES AND IT'S LIKE FOUR STORIES BIG AND I SERIOUSLY LOVE THAT PLACE TO BITS AND ALSO SHERLOCK'S POINT OF VIEW IS NOT THE REAL POINT OF VIEW IT'S JUST WHAT REALLY POSH PEOPLE THINK AND HE'S POSH SO THAT'S WHY HE SAYS ALL THOSE THINGS!!! FRANKLY I THINK PRIMARK IS AWESOME AND AMAZING AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! BUT THEN AGAIN I'M AMERICAN SO.... (THAT COUNTS AS TOURISM...)
Sherlock just chuckled. It was so like John to use vulgar language at a time like this. “Well, I can’t promise you anything, but I will try my hardest to stay alive forever and ever.” He smiled and pushed himself up a tad to kiss John sweetly.
John climbed out as well, but it didn’t mean he wanted to… he looked around and rubbed the back of his head, the place was completely dodgy. There was graffiti everywhere and everything around them was an old abandoned arcade game arena, “Sherlock, this place is dodgy as fuck… what are we even doing here..?”
John sighed and started rummaging through Sherlock's nightstand. They may have shared a bed, but they hadn’t had sex, even though he told Claire they had, and John knew he didn’t have any of those things... though thinking back he was starting to wonder why the fuck not. Luckily, he found both in Sherlock's drawer, good damn thing too considering he was fucking Brian consistently. He opened the packet and was about to roll it onto to aching prick when Sherlock stopped him and shook his head.
