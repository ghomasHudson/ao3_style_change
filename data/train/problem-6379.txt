Tony’s cheeks start to heat up as he reads the dare challenge on TV, and his mouth goes a little dry, as Steve stops fidgeting and stands up. “Up,” he orders, and Tony stands up without missing a beat, confused for a second because Steve sounds like he did last night, as he was playing Captain America. The idea of Steve mixes with Captain America again, in the most delicious way, as he sweeps Tony off and presses him to the wall adjacent to the couch. Tony’s feet wrap around Steve’s waist instinctively and his head spins a little as Steve kisses him, so passionately his lips hurt.
with a bit of sarcasm,” Tony quips, and can’t help the adoration that bubbles in his heart at the way Steve’s lips turn into a thin line, despite the circumstances.
“I have a perfect view of the plug now. I’m going to try and grab it with the forceps. Stay very still for me, Steve.”
Tony brings Steve’s face to him and puts their foreheads together. It’s him, it’s absolutely him, flesh and blood and alive and he is hurting like hell, because for whatever reason beyond Tony’s comprehension, he thinks there is a single thing wrong about him. “It’s you,” Tony says, kissing Steve’s lips, his cheeks, his chin, “it’s absolutely you,” he repeats, as his fingers comb through Steve’s hair, “you’re here. You’re actually here, and in my arms by fucking accident?” He kisses Steve’s eyes, his forehead, his nose, as his hands go lower, touching Steve’s neck, shoulders, and digging into Steve’s back. He pulls Steve into himself, breathes him in, and God, oh God, he is as cold as ice. Tony presses closer to Steve, even if just half an inch more, enveloping Steve’s body with his own, hopelessly wishing that there would be some warmth left in him, somewhere deep down.
Nat turns to Steve with a half-knowing smile. “I’m sure Steve’s not gonna do anything like that right?”
tasting, smelling, experimenting.
Steve nods, before fathoming Dr. Stark’s words fully, and it’s in the middle of his struggle to say actual words that the idea sinks in and the image crystalizes, that he has to
He thought about Tony’s breath against his skin and his hands, wrapped around Steve’s waist, holding him close, keeping him from drifting away with the wind. Being enchanted by the touch, the sharp burst of pleasure that ran through his body and took his breath away, and left his head spinning and his core aching with want he did not know existed.
He’s got this.
“You’re late, Stark.” Steve grabs Tony’s waist as soon as the door opens, drags him in, and closes the door, by pressing Tony to it. “You don’t get to keep me waiting, you hear me? I don’t appreciate it.”
He pulls the blanket up to his neck and looks out of the window as the buildings become more condensed. He is dizzy, lightheaded and the humming sound of the car and the rain are making him very, very sleepy.  Then Captain Rogers turns the radio on and thank fuck, the most ridiculous love song of all time is playing.
Steve is sleepy. Gloriously beaten up, rung and stretched in the best possible way and happy, giddy with the strange sensation that rolls through his body with every single move of his hips. It’s a presence, a shadow, a reminder of what has happened and it hurts in the most perfect way with every word, every smile, and every breath.
“Move down, a bit more, excellent. Now put your feet up,” Dr. Stark instructs, and his fingers burn on the skin of Steve’s shins as he guides them onto the stirrups. “Ah, there you go, great job.” And the praise washes him all over even if he knows, at least on some deep inaccessible level, that it’s not meant the way his body is trying to take it.
“Okay. Let’s come clean shall we?” Tony huffs with a lopsided smile, “Vic and Anthony were very surprised when they received the order to prepare 2000 meals for the Houston Food Bank. Their food’s a bit expensive for charity, usually, but they’re closed right now and it’s not like they have anything better to do, so they agreed to throw in a discount. The meal is made especially for us, as a thank you from the 15 staff who will be cooking the meals for as long as the restaurant is closed to the public.” And his lips twitch a little to do that heartwarming cheeky smile that he does when he is happy with himself.
Well, almost perfect, because Steve starts to lick Tony’s length just then, and Tony can’t get a hold of himself anymore. He presses his fingers into the desk and closes his eyes, opening them in the hypothetical paradise of pleasure where there is nothing, except for stars and flowers and Steve. Steve, who is sucking Tony’s cock, somehow kissing his soul in the process too, and there,
Tony tosses his StarkPad on the nightstand and stretches his arms over his head. “So, Steve, I’ve had a question since this afternoon, and I am just gonna come right out with it, if you don’t mind. Do you… happen to… have a crush on our president?”
, in case you wanted to reblog it!
Because it felt right, for the first time in forever, he tells himself for the hundredth time, to trust someone. Why would Tony feel the same way? He couldn’t. He definitely shouldn't.
He steps forward again and his hand on Steve’s shoulder is like fire and ice, rain and sunshine, calming and exciting all at the same time.
Ty takes a last look at Tony, nods, and walks out of the bedroom.
OH, AND BY THE WAY, there is a funny point in this chapter. Tell me if you spot it, the first person with the correct answer ... will be forced to suffer reading through more words from me :)) aka a small fic based on a prompt of your choice :)
but the power of the fantasy shocked the hell out of him. It felt real, like he had just seen it with his own eyes, thrilling and yet so painful, the fact that he was not the one in Steve’s arms but also… he wasn’t the one touching Bucky.
And it’s all slipping away from him.
“Mr Murdock’s the best in the field.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve’s still asleep, soft and warm, slumped against Tony’s side, and he looks like a Golden Retriever puppy with the ray of sun shining on the fine blond hair all over his back.
Captain Rogers nods.
“So, what are his options?” Captain Rogers sits back on the chair at the head of the kitchen table, pushes Tony’s plate toward him, and smiles. No questions. No spoken commands.
What he wants to do, he realizes as he walks another couple of steps, is to close the distance and kiss Steve’s pursed lips until they part a little to let Tony’s tongue in. It’s to have more of him, that hair, those lips, that perfect ass, and that apparently good heart. All he wants to do is make Steve stay, one way or the other, and maybe do something good along the way as well.
, Tony tells himself,
Please mind the added tags and for spoilery warnings please take a look at the end note.
He has finally arrived at the spring but he can’t take the water. It’s pouring out of his clenched fists, no matter how much he squeezes his fingers; you can’t hold water in your hand, and that’s that.
And it’s not that hard anyway. He just needs to slide onto the bed, ignoring the way the gown stops covering him altogether as soon as he lies down, and just give up the last bit of his dignity. Simple. Easy.
He should go. He should just—
“Oh God, I am so sorry, I … made a mess, I’m just …”
“I don’t want to stay away from you.” Steve slides his fingers over the desk toward where Tony’s fingers are holding onto the edge. “I want to stay very, very close to you.” His fingers wrap around Tony’s and the beast growls low in his chest, Steve shivering all over as Tony brings his other hand forward and covers their intertwined fingers.
He could not let Steve go, now that he was at least half sure that this was what Steve wanted.
Ty is always gentle when he takes Tony’s clothes off and helps him get into the shower. He is extra careful not to touch any sore spots as he dries Tony and kisses all the red and purple spots he finds along the way as he dresses him. He puts Tony in bed and covers him with the fucking gray duvet and cuddles him to sleep. He says how sorry he is, how much he wishes he did not have to do this and how much he loves Tony. And it’s not like that Tony doesn’t try because he absolutely does. He might be
Tony’s eyes dart open. “What? You on the other hand are cheating on a partner?”
I really really hope you enjoyed it and thank you so much for reading this!
“Oh wow, me too! From New York I mean. And here on business.” He locks his phone, throws it on the couch and stands up.
Steve’s managed to rinse more than half of the dishes when Tony’s fingers slide between his cheeks, suddenly warm and sleek. That’s what the quick weird noise must have been a couple of minutes ago, right before Tony’s hands had moved away from Steve’s balls and toward his back. The steam of last night’s memories cloud Steve’s mind, as Tony slips his finger back and forth in between Steve’s thighs and then, just then, Tony’s fingers brush over Steve’s hole out of nowhere and Steve cries out, almost dropping the wine glass he’s rinsing, as his hands go numb and he starts shaking.
It’s not even odd, that Steve was having a painfully out of reach dream about dancing with Tony, a couple of days ago. It’s magical but not surprising that Tony does exactly as Steve needs, even when he has no idea about it. The same way he knows how to touch Steve, exactly the right way, to make him rise and fall at the same time. How he knows what to say to make Steve’s mind stop reeling and start moving forward, how he knows what to do exactly to steady Steve and help him go, like taking off the mask Steve had been wearing for so long without even knowing it existed.
It must be amazing. Living somewhere that you can
Steve is not obsessed with the idea of kissing Tony’s lips right at this moment. Or maybe he is but he can’t do anything about it, really. He smiles again instead - he will get muscle pain soon from all the fake smiling - as he spreads peanut butter on all five pieces of toast on his plate.
, in case you wanted to reblog it!
Tony wants to do it a month after. Steve insists on waiting a year. They settle on their six-month anniversary in the end, and it has to be a late Saturday night, so the appointment ends up being five months, three weeks, and six days after that very first time.
But hey, here we are 😊 and I'm planning to post with way less delay, fingers crossed 😅
Steve delivers his best speech before launch and spends time with each of the department heads who are on the bridge, smiling and shaking hands, telling everyone how honoured he is to have a chance to be working with them.
It's been a while right? I'm super sorry for what I can't even call delay 🙈
The fourth plain white t-shirt looks worse than the first three. Steve runs his hand on the back of his neck and wonders if he should go back to the first plain white one; he is not planning to wear a button-up shirt to this date--dinner, or whatever.
Steve moves down Tony’s chest and licks those few scars in the middle. This doesn’t just feel like it's the first time; this actually
Tony shows Steve how to touch step and triple step with ‘It’s Been a Long Long Time’, while kissing him once and twice then once again, and explains how you can west coast swing to any pop music, like ‘Underwater’ mixing and matching the steps Steve had just learned. Steve’s brain stumbles over the words of the song, hooked on how the love Tony breathes is all Steve needs to become invincible, as silly as it might sound, how he can even breathe underwater if he can keep Tony’s lips on his for as long as possible. They slow down with ‘The Way I Am’, Tony letting go of Steve’s body a couple of times to pull him back right after. He sings some of the words, ‘cause I love the way you say good morning’, and ‘I love you more than I could ever promise’, and it shouldn’t be possible to be nearly flawless, but Tony apparently is, because even his singing voice is absolutely perfect.
A little too giddy with the idea, Steve doesn’t notice the intrusive alpha scent for the first few seconds. He can just tell something is off, because Tony’s shoulders tense, and his smile fades away as he looks up.
Steve pulls the covers over them and makes sure that Tony is tucked in and warm. He loves the way it all feels right with Tony, he tells himself as he closes his eyes and presses Tony to his chest, just a bit further.
“What was the best sex you ever had?” Steve reads Tony’s truth question, sounding a little shaky still, and Tony hesitates for a second. Not that he doesn’t know the answer, because he does, and it’s more clear than Steve’s anxious anticipation with the way he is chewing on his bottom lip and rubbing the back of his neck. It’s the realization of the answer that is taking Tony by surprise, the clarity itself, how there is no beat, no doubt, no internal debates. How it’s completely obvious.
, and it’s breaking his heart and mending it at the same time, the way Steve’s all in all the time, and he may not love Tony, not exactly, but he can make those stupidly hilarious moves while taking off his pants and make Tony laugh so hard, so he forgets about the thinning of his resources to help people in this crisis, the deaths, the everlasting series of not being enough, at least for a few minutes.
Just. No.
It’s a U. It’s malformed and too long all the way around Tony’s cock and balls, but definitely a U and Tony can’t stop the out-of-no-where tears or he just does not want to.
Thank you to everyone reading this so far. I would love to know how you feel about the fic, and I truly appreciate each and every comment. Your nice words make my day and they are truly my fuel to go on writing this daily. I love you all and I hope everyone stays safe and happy during this hard time.
Steve chuckles as he digs through the drawers to find some of the cookies he had baked on Wednesday while obsessing about dropping by at Tony’s apartment to give him some. “You should come back to my place to see my paintings,” he says without thinking, before sitting back down at the trolley to finish sterilizing the tattoo equipment. “They’re half creepy and doubly magnificent.”
“If I ever tell you I love you, Rogers,” Tony says and runs his hands through his hair to tidy it, “you should wonder if I’ve been replaced by the aliens.” And that’s all the warning Steve gets before Tony opens the door, slips out, and startles Steve with the loud noise of the door closing behind him.
Tony’s lips brush against the side of Steve’s face and the tears stop running down. He kisses the line of Steve’s jaw and Steve’s shoulders stop shaking. His lips find Steve’s and the choked sobs disappear. Steve tastes Tony’s mouth as Tony parts his lips. It’s sweet and so painfully familiar. Steve’s suddenly dizzy with the flood of sensations washing over his skin, a knot coming undone, deep in Steve’s core, that he had kept so tightly tied.
Small and pale with all of his upper body wrapped in dreadfully stained bandages, but it’s him, it’s absolutely him, alive and breathing, and, God, looking at Steve.
“Oh come on,” Tony snaps and takes a couple of steps forward. “Was it that bad? Is it that embarrassing? I mean you always had the option of letting me die, you know, so it’s not like I forced you into it.”
Tony finishes off the bagel, takes another sip of coffee, and twitches his face. “Ham and cheese sandwiches? I am sure it was more than one, so let’s say three?”
Steve is different today.
It’s still dark outside.
This is all Natasha’s fault, well at least partly, because she found it funny to pack all of Steve’s plain white t-shirts for these two weeks, to get her point across maybe, that Steve does actually need some help in that area. Steve takes off the T-shirt he’s wearing to put on another one, which looks exactly the same, and pouts with frustration before he kicks himself mentally. This is not a date, he reminds himself for the five hundredth time, even if Tony has declined Steve’s offer to help cook or set the table and has said that he will
. He literally sacrificed himself to save the world. I have nothing to be ashamed of for loving the guy with my whole heart.” And the sincere pride in his tone fills Steve’s chest with a million butterflies.
Steve opens his mouth to say something back but it’s harder to get focused when Tony’s remarks are this perfect. The vein pulsing so beautifully in Tony’s neck and the urge to bite doesn’t help either and Steve closes his mouth to gather his thoughts as the door swings open and Nat walks in.
He informed Mr. O'Connell of his plans for departure while sorting the disinfected luggage in the clean storage room for the last time and helped with settling the second-class passengers of the newly-arrived ship into Quarantine Building 2, which did not take long.
Captian Rogers steps forward and shakes Ty’s hand. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Mr. Stone.”
She tucks him in, turns the night light on and puts a glass of water next to the half-eaten plate of cookies on the nightstand. She then smiles and kisses Tony’s cheek before she walks out, leaving the door open so Tony can call out if he needs anything.
I should warn everyone that I am using a rather harsh tone about the President of the United States in this chapter, and please if you don't like to read that, skip this.
that is happening and why on earth did it seem like a good idea to stay in Tony’s penthouse, or his arms or his life for that matter?
“Hey, hey, none of that.” Dr. Stark’s fingers wrap around Steve’s hands, take them off his face, and hold them both in his. “It’s perfectly normal to have an orgasm after so much stimulation. And honestly, you did me a favor.”
Steve is the most boy scout kind of guy Tony has ever met. Not that he usually comes across a lot of those people, because his circles are fucked, but Steve has this raw, genuine, greater good aspect to him that he doesn’t even try to hide. It’s like a breath of fresh air, the way he believes in making a change, the way he operates almost all the time, and it’s beyond astonishing how his ways actually work, as naive and unworldly as they look, how he has done more in the past three days, than the president's administration in the past three months.
What if he actually has a date, tonight of all nights—
are working on the reports,” comes Tony’s voice from the other side of the room, “because the rest of us are already buried under the pile of work you’ve assigned to us.” Steve’s already irritated with the smugness before even turning to look at Tony. “The technology analysis of the debris is on your desk though so you can get chugging along.” Tony points his half-chewed pencil at Steve. He winks mischievously and then frowns and the flare of anger bites at the back of Steve’s throat, just like always.
Steve runs, in agony and hope, because it’s him, sliding down the steps, holding on to a blue-faced person Steve doesn’t recognize, his beard untidy and his hair mussed, eyes glossy as if empty of life. But it’s Tony, in the flesh, half the size Steve remembers, hissing in pain as he slumps into Steve’s arms, but he’s alive, breathing, saying words Steve can’t gather the mental ability to understand but is grateful to hear nevertheless. Steve has to pause in the middle of the steps, to take a deep breath and steady himself. He has Tony in his arms so he can’t shatter into pieces; he has to keep it together.
Steve starts with his fruit salad, and so does Tony. They eat quietly for a minute or two, staring at each other, as if this, eating breakfast and sharing feelings, is something they do every single day.
Steve lowers them both on the bed and pulls the covers up. It smells like heaven under Tony’s blanket and Steve can’t help but smile as Tony lays his head on Steve’s chest and reaches over Steve’s body to draw soothing circles on his back.
“Shooting Santa Maria could be quite catastrophic,” Dr. Banner raises his head from his PADD and takes his glasses off. “Without the perfect angle and precise force, it could blow up the whole spaceship.”
“Dr. Stark, please. Wait, just, wait.” Steve tries, feeling the sweat that’s trickling down his temple all of a sudden. “This is not the main problem. There is… something else.”
It’s unfair and it’s absolutely painful, but it’s the fucking right thing to do. It takes Tony every single bit of his will power though, to let go of the edge of the desk, cup Steve’s face and bring it up so he can see Steve’s eyes. “Steve, what are you doing?”
“Tea, sir?”
Thank you soooooo much to bae and sesh for cheer and beta, guys you rock, you're the best I appreciate you so so much!!!
“Ty, for God’s sake,” Tony says and rushes up to his feet. “Just leave, please, just…” he goes on, dragging his fingers out of Steve’s, and the plea in his voice breaks Steve’s heart into small pieces.
“Steve, for fuck’s sake, do you ever use your brain?”
“No need to do that.” Dr. Stark puts the tablet away and comes to Steve’s side. “It’s all done and dusted. You can’t even imagine some of the things I’ve had to deal with since I started working in this ED. This was nothing, I promise you, I won’t even remember it tomorrow.”
He seems to have shed a skin, or grown another one, as he can’t seem to stop smiling all the way through breakfast and finds the time, all of a sudden, to come to Tony’s room many times during the day, with or without food, and waits 5 whole minutes one time, for Tony to finish his video call so he can get his nose kiss before he goes back to his room.
He is still wearing his white shirt and black pants but he has gotten rid of his shoes and socks and, well, even his feet are A-class alpha material.
This is all very normal, Tony thinks, it must be, although he has no baseline for comparison. It’s fine, it totally is, even if it’s not what Tony had expected; not that he has a clear vision of what he exactly expected anyway.
be the best combination.” Her face lights up in a smile and she shakes her head fondly. “When he gets ready for an event though,
“Steve’s been rotating as a volunteer through different jobs across the quarantine facility since he was released from mandatory quarantine. He was free to spend his days drawing the breathtaking surroundings, but of course, he’s preferred to read to sick, quarantined immigrants. Or to breathe in the disinfectant for hours at a time, which does no good for his lungs, but he has to help no matter what, because ‘
The world starts to spin and the floor ceases to be solid. He’s folding, falling, dying maybe. It will be hours before someone comes looking for him, and there are some perks to being dead, like not having to think about the pathetic image that he would make lying on the bathroom floor. Bruised, foul and filthy; a perfect reflection of who he’s ended up as.
The idea rolls through Steve’s body and tears run down his face. Tony is the one Steve has been waiting for; awake or asleep, buried under miles of ice in a stretch between two centuries. He
Then Dr. Stark pulls the stirrups out. Steve’s brain freezes; his body starts to boil.
He slowly turns his head towards Ty, expecting to bite his tongue and shut up as he always does just seeing the discontented look on Ty’s face, and he is surprised to hear the sound of his own voice. It’s small and almost quiet, but it is there.
Tony doesn’t lift his head from the headrest of the tattoo table. He doesn’t even open his eyes. “I’d have you tattoo it on my forehead if you wouldn’t freak out. I love you. I admire your stupid guts and the fact that you’ve been beaten up in every alley in Brooklyn. I’m sure, Steve. I’m certain.”
The reflection in the mirror is not his.
Tony's an A-class loser.
yay!! all sorted I guess?
He stands in his room for a second and listens to make sure Tony is still awake. He will do this, now. It wouldn’t be a big thing, but it would be something. And something is better than nothing.
There is something magical about that smile. It’s beautiful and earnest and it kinda lights up the guy’s face. Sparkles shine in his eyes and butterflies start to fly in Steve's stomach. Things seem to run away, all of a sudden; and he feels like he is 20 again, carefree and shy and damn he is absolutely blushing.
The city is waking up slowly and the lights of dark windows are flickering on. Steve closes his eyes, to keep the tears in, and imagines Tony’s hands in his hair. He imagines hiding his face in Tony’s chest, trailing his lips along the amazing artwork of scars, that Steve is dying to ask why, and talking, maybe crying while no one can see. Tony’s soft words, and his endless string of kisses, the way he holds Steve tight and takes his breath away with a single touch; the way he fits, he’s right, he is the one.
What if they had gotten a chance to be together before the war? What if they had been allowed to turn that mind-blowing, heartbreaking connection Tony had been witnessing for months, into something that was called love these days? Would Steve hold Bucky down just as he was holding Tony right now, blowing him away with every slide of his body? What would Tony do if he had met Steve and Bucky after they had gotten together?
Tony wakes earlier for a change.
This was a mess.
He lets Pepper know that he will call her back sometime in the foreseeable future. He leaves the ‘foreseeable future’ clause out of his statement, though, just in case.
bumping into the guy’s sharp cheekbones. “First of all, you’re obviously not his alpha.” He points to Tony’s intact skin, showing through the wide neckline of his T-shirt. “And I wouldn’t give him a tattoo tonight, even if you’ve been bonded to him since 45 got elected to the office.”
Tony watches him chew and swallow, and it’s right in that second when he finally decides it’s appropriate to lick the small bit of strawberry jam off Steve’s chin, that a familiar monotone voice echoes in the room and, well, nothing can be more of a turn off than the sound of the drawled words of the leader of the free world. Tony rolls his eyes one more time as he turns to the TV. “Why are we watching this again?”
“You know, I never got used to people calling me Dr. Stark,” he says, as he pushes his finger in, less gently this time, but in one quick motion. “The sphincter is intact.” His finger moves around and pushes further in as Steve presses his feet down on the stirrups, his fingers digging into the sheet under him on the exam table. “Dr. Stark is my dad, and he used to be an attending in this hospital when I was an intern.” There is more pressure and more push. “No tears or tenderness in the walls.” The finger goes further up, just barely brushing up against his prostate, and it takes every ounce of Steve’s willpower to not move his feet and kick Dr. Stark in the face. “He runs the company now, and I envy him so much, because he gets to deal with prosthetics and medical technology. Ah, there we go, I found it,” he says happily, and Steve wonders if his head would explode with the way the plug shifts as Dr. Stark’s finger touches the edge of the damn thing. “I always wanted to become an engineer, but he wouldn't even listen to me talk about it. Eh, water under the bridge.” He pulls his finger out of Steve’s ass in another swift motion, and it’s just impossible, how his whole body burns, in a jumble of mismatched sensations.
enlisting photo and calls it pretty?” Steve shakes his head. “Feels like an exceptionally cruel and crazy joke to me, Tony. Feels like dangling heaven in front of my nose, only to have it taken away, like a story where the moral is ‘if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is’. There is no way that the universe would be
Tony looks up from the coffee Steve has just left on the desk, along with the blueberry pancakes he must have ordered last night. Steve’s holding his mug in the hand he is leaning on against the door, and is rubbing the back of his neck with the other. Spending the past 7 days with him, Tony already can tell that this is Steve’s
They sleep for hours, holding on to eachother before they receive the rescue communication. Steve helps Tony get dressed and holds his hand through the ride back to Avenger, and lets go reluctantly when Tony is being rolled into Medical 1. He doesn’t notice the heavy feeling in his chest as he’s walked to Medical 2, or as he's being checked up and cleared to go. Sneaking into Medical 1, he watches Tony’s weak smile from across the hall but doesn’t find it in himself to go any closer. Tony’s doing fine, surrounded by his friends, and Steve has no right to impose. Steve’s not Tony’s friend. He’s Tony’s Captain and he’s done what was required to keep him safe like he would for every other crew member.
Steve takes a deep breath. “Very,” he breathes out and he kisses Tony’s chest again, and then some more.
Tony stares at him for a few seconds.
“But you’re … still hard. Just let me, okay?” Tony whispers as his lips brush against Steve’s and he rubs the skin right above Steve’s waistband suggestively.
He doesn’t miss Tony’s soft breaths and beautiful smiles every single second of every single day. He doesn’t want to hold Tony close and smell his hair, and he definitely does not want to make him whimper and moan in pleasure, properly this time. He doesn’t want any of that. He doesn't get to want any of that.
“I’m not here to argue my correct assessment, Captain Rogers. I wanted to offer to be released from duty and get off Avenger at the nearest space station. The engines are solid and working as expected so my engineers should be able to take over from now. Lieutenant Engineer Parker is more than capable.”
“There are 328 people on board.” Commander Barton taps at the hologram and Santa Maria’s schematics show up. “We can take them on board temporarily until we get to the space station if we get close enough, but...”
“Okay turn around, get back to your dishes,” Tony teases as he gently pushes his chin to the side of Steve’s face, and Steve turns to the sink and back to the dishes.
Steve’s face goes from shock to unreadable, before it softens to another perfect smile, and Tony lets out a breath he did not know he was holding.
as if he’s walking on a cloud or something.
while Dr. Stark is
Tony helps Steve to the shower and washes him with heartbreakingly gentle touches as if Steve’s a delicate glass sculpture that needs to be handled with care. He asks if Steve’s feeling alright
To be close; to be more.
Steve is not sure if it’s physically possible to be more turned on than he is right now. Or embarrassed for that matter as he is cherry red all over and he is absolutely leaking in his underwear. He nods and probably blushes some more because Tony’s eyes get even softer and yet darker with intent.
“Fuck you,” Tony says against Steve’s lips, his scent making Steve's head spin, his nail scratching Steve’s skin, as Steve’s shaky fingers fumble with Tony’s pants and open the zipper.
Steve holds Tony in his arms as they lie on the couch and covers them with the warm knitted throw. Tony kisses Steve’s lips, his face, his hair, his wonderful mesmerizing eyes, and doesn’t know how many times he whispers 'I love you too' in Steve's ears before he falls into a deep dreamless sleep.
Right now though, Steve hides behind the wall of new items on his list. He spends over 10 hours on phone calls and video conferences with so many people he loses count. He chats constantly, with his new team - because he now has a team of four interns and one real-life SI-employee assistant - and spends most of his leftover brainpower to figure out their complicated references, which they use in their professional communications even. He hides behind the long messages with Ms. Potts going over the list of congress members and senators who are willing to help lift the ban on distilleries making hand sanitizers and comparing the details of Nestle and Kraft food bank proposals. He hides for a whole day behind being busy, too busy to spend five minutes putting some food together to take to Tony’s room and get the nose kiss he misses so much it almost hurts, instead of obsessing about it with every beat of his heart.
“But, just so you know, and not that I’d be ashamed if I had picked up a hooker down at that bar, but no, it is not true,” and he shakes his head again, and something serene about his lopsided smile eases the pain in Steve’s clenched fists. He opens his hands and wiggles his fingers, as he lets out a breath he’s been holding, deep but quiet.
“Between four to seven hours. Closer to four because statistically, the black hole’s gravity ratio might increase as they get closer to the core.”
“I’m already impressed.” Steve puts his fork down and tilts his head, watching Tony’s forehead unwrinkle, and his laugh lines deepen. He then stands up and walks around the table, to wrap his hands around Tony’s shoulders and breathe in the coconut scent of his hair. “I’m very very impressed.”
He pulls back to look into Steve’s eyes. “I love you, Steve. I love your pretty face and your ridiculously kind soul and the fire that’s been burning deep inside you, for, wow, a century. I love you, inside and out. I fucking asked you to move in with me an hour ago, there is no chance in hell that I’d let you go
The alpha towering over them, on the other hand, is just too much. Steve has seen his kind so many times, the ones who think they’re just precious for being born an alpha, or that having broad shoulders and blond floppy hair makes them superior. He has even ‘designed the tattoo himself’, because he has a minor in visual arts, and can’t shut up about his degrees, his inventions, his black belt, and his parents’ mansion in Malibu, the whole time, as Steve gets his tattoo set ready.
“I know,” Tony wets his bottom lip, “I just didn’t want you to get fired,” and his forehead wrinkles in pain for a second as he struggles to breathe, making Steve’s breath trap in his chest. “It would’ve been your last strike, dumbass, have you forgotten last—” and he brings their intertwined hands to his chest and starts to cough, distracting Steve for a moment, as he kisses Tony’s neck and caresses his forehead. It’s only after Tony has stopped coughing and seems to be dozing off that something clicks in Steve’s brain.
“I don’t need to charge your employer for this room though, I can afford the two weeks on my own,” Tony says, taking a couple of careful steps forward, hoping he doesn’t sound like a pretentious rich person.
Tony finally stops browsing the channels when he gets to The Daily Social Distancing Show. Steve laughs at Trevor Noah’s remark about the president not being a billionaire due to not knowing how numbers work, because he understands the reference, and a few knots untie in his stomach as Tony puts an arm around his shoulders. Tony kisses the side of Steve’s face as the president shows up on the screen and starts to tease Steve about having a crush on the guy all over again. Steve kisses the side of Tony's face, his lips prickling as they brush over the goatee, and smiles. Tony is trusting Steve with billions of dollars worth of secrets, for whatever reason that’s fully beyond Steve, and Steve can trust Tony with this one thing in return, which is not devastating or classified anyway.
Steve asks about Tony’s shouting match with the White House earlier and Tony’s face goes hard for a second. The president has denied the financial relief package proposed by a symposium of his largest donors including Stark Industries although he was scheduled to sign and announce it that afternoon. Steve can’t believe that Tony would donate to this president's campaign, and Tony explains that it’s not up to him, that it’s been a company policy forever to donate the same amount of money to both presidential candidates so they have an equal amount of support, whichever gets elected to the office.
but sharp needles are pricking his heart suddenly. “I’d say you get to do both then,” and he ruffles Steve’s hair, brushing his forearm to the side of his face and Steve turns and pecks a quick kiss on Tony’s hand before turning back to watch the stripping wheel spin on the TV.
What is he doing here? What the hell is this
“I love you,” Steve murmured against Tony’s hair, soft and sleepy, and shifted a little. Maybe he was not taking Bucky’s place. Maybe he didn’t have to lose Steve, to give him what he wanted.They had to figure this out, somehow. There would always be a way.
nervous, if he ignores his sweaty palms and flushed cheeks, and the way his heart is racing in his chest.
“I am gonna take these off too, if you don’t mind,” Steve explains as he unbuttons Tony’s jeans, “I know it’s not part of the dare but they’re gonna come off with the wheel spinning anyway right? And besides, these questions have to be rigged somehow because, why do you have so much more clothes on while I am completely-” and he removes Tony’s shoes and socks too quickly to be humanly possible “-naked?”
Steve asks for the same things they’ve had for breakfast yesterday, as some of it should be what Tony would want to eat. He can ask Tony for tomorrow maybe, and he can order the night before, so he doesn’t have to leave the bed before Tony wakes up.
whatever.
Steve is restless. He can’t sit. He can’t lie down or walk or work out for that matter. What Tony has said plays on repeat in his mind and he wishes he could tune it out but he just can’t. He thinks about it over and over and over again, until the words lose all meaning, but nothing makes sense. Why would Tony trust Steve? With
Pepper sits by Tony’s bed and holds his hand. Steve doesn’t need to look at the deep wrinkle between her brows to know that he’s not welcome to stay. Holding Tony in his arms, carrying him to bed, and tucking him under the blankets they used to cuddle under, is more than enough. Knowing that he’s not gone; that there is a shred of hope left in the world to keep going for.
They move at the same time. Steve points the missile and shoots as Tony maneuvers the shuttle. They watch holding breath as the spaceship gets hit by the ray, emits a cloud of smoke, jerks back and forth, and finally moves away from the event horizon.
Steve closed his eyes and listened to the waves come to shore and go back toward the ocean. He was too damn tired.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (although I have not mentioned the name so far) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
designing the new Stark flagship semi-automatics guns?
“Coffee is not food. What is the last food item you remember having eaten yesterday?”
Steve’s brain short circuits at the thought. “What? No, you’re not gonna die from a heat.”
He’s totally got this.
Something stings around Tony’s forearm and starts beeping, so he turns, slowly, and looks at a beta with too-serious eyes behind round glasses, tapping on the source of the pressure. He sighs with relief as the beeping stops, smiles at Tony and his eyes don’t look so serious anymore.
Sorry, this chapter took so long, but hey it's 3.5 k, so maybe consider it one and a half chapter? :)
He opens his mouth, sips the too-sweet water and blames the sudden rush of glucose for the instant feeling of warmth and the heat that is most probably shading his cheeks pink. Nothing to do with the bergamot scent. Or the insanely calming smile.
He also thinks about babies. Many of them actually. He somehow feels he is trapped in a cute nursery, or a haunted house, and there is a baby at each and every corner. He can hear them cry and coo and giggle. He can even almost smell them and that is absolutely ridiculous.
Steve shakes his head. “No. Not this time. This time, I don’t want you to show any gratitude.” he reaches for Tony’s other hand and starts to kiss the fingers one by one.
Captain Rogers finally puts down the fork and there is not a single crumb left on his plate. He thanks Helen for the millionth time as she clears the table and something bubbles up in Tony's heart when Helen's face is the happiest he's ever seen.
Everyone on the bridge is now looking at them. How do you say ‘because you’re an omega’, without saying the words?
“I did it because your stupid ass was in the parking lot trying to light yourself on fire. If you hadn’t gone after that freak with a flamethrower, who was actually already half-unconscious anyway we wouldn’t be having our collective asses roasted right now!”
I would fall asleep every time, even if it was just for a few hours, and I would still jerk awake, sweating and disturbed, with a pounding heart and a dry mouth, wondering if I was still in the ocean or if I was on that cursed bridge, if I was drowning again or failing one more time. But still, the only break I could get from the hell that was my life over the past 18 months, the only relief, the only breath of fresh air, was him.”
Steve blinks to push away the fog that seems to have suddenly filled the bar and watches Tony’s cheeks go cherry red and then lose color completely. He can tell from the way his own heart is pounding and the blood is rushing away from his head, that something has gone horribly wrong, but his brain can’t process events at the normal speed and it’s too many seconds too late when it starts to catch up.
ALSO, there is a dance scene coming up soon, yayyyy, and I would love to hear your song suggestions for this version of our boys to ummm have their first dance?
The second chapter, Day 1, is here, as promised. I am planning to update daily so please help me go with your precious kudos and comments <3
Steve shakes his head and narrows his eyes. “No! No, no, no skipping, no. I can do this, it’s fine,” and well, Tony can’t say no to Steve’s pouting determination anyway.
Slipping inside the CCU is a piece of cake for a SHIELD field agent specialized in galactical combat. What proves to be out of Steve’s league, however, is keeping steady and remaining hopeful as he wobbles through the beds and looks at people’s faces one by one. To keep going with trembling knees and blurry eyes, to suppress the voice that gets louder and louder by the second, that yells that Tony might not be here after all. That Tony is—
“Coming to the party tonight, Tony?” Nat asks as she hands Steve his take away coffee and Friday special donuts.
“God, Steve, I know you’ll be careful. You don’t have to … you know … you just don’t need to.”
“I went shopping and stocked the fridge with edible things, including real food. I took a photo, and the only person I wanted to show it to was you. Too weird right?”
Steve kisses Tony slowly.
He is the courage itself. He is grace and sympathy and the reason Steve can sit, eat or rest at least a little easier. He is the wings Steve doesn’t have and they reach places Steve can’t reach. He makes the world a better place, with no superpower, whatsoever, except for the power of his brain and his amazing, perfect soul.
His back hurts. His nose hurts. His hands and his head hurt too. He is also light-headed and he has probably started shaking at one point because Captain Rogers stops  the car to cover him with a blanket he pulled out of nowhere. It might be a precautionary measure, Tony thinks, to keep a light travel blanket handy in your car in case you rescue a random shaking omega from your trunk. The car has taken a few tries to turn back on and it’s running with a suspicious sound that Tony would have brought up if he has the energy to, or if he had been on talking grounds with Captain Rogers.
Tony takes a step back too. “What?”
He had taken Tony’s clothes off, piece by piece, and had carried him,
The fact that he has a secondary gender just like Steve.
Tony is on his phone on the other side of the room, leaning against the window and Steve takes a deep breath to calm his nerves as he vaguely takes in the perfect lines of Tony’s naked back.
or Tony will wait, forever, if he has to. “I want you. All of you. I wanna… I wanna be yours.”
“This place is not as scary as I remember,” he says, and moves on to sit on the chair in the corner and browse through Steve’s design album. “All this your work? Wow, look at this magnificently creepy horned creature.”
He finds himself moving things around to make them look nice on the table, but he doesn’t get a chance to feel embarrassed about it, as Tony shows up at the breakfast area, pulling a t-shirt over his head. He has that sleepy glow, his hair adorably mussed and Steve has to reach for the coffee pot to keep his hands busy; to not reach over and push Tony’s hair away from his forehead.
“Can you… can you actually do that?”
Ty’s deep alpha voice is supposed to be enough. In a simpler life, Tony would roll over and show his belly on hearing only one of the sweet pet names Ty is throwing at him right now. It’s not a simpler life though. His fucking stupid hormonal omega brain hard coding is too incompetent to handle the situation.
Tony is sighing and rubbing his forehead when Steve shows up at his door, awake and not shaking. He has changed into clothes Tony has not seen before, so his things must have arrived sometime during Tony’s all day shouting festival.
Dr. Stark’s eyes go wide, for a fraction of a second, before the corners of his eyes crinkle with concern. “Okay. That's okay, we’ll figure it out.” And he smiles again, his eyes still on Steve, and Steve’s so damn grateful, as he feels so numb and small that he might float and get lost in the sky without them.
Steve goes from room to room and reads the hotel guide about the penthouse. The sheets, the antique lamps, the original Nicole Eisenman hanging in the living area that Steve would have sworn was a replica. Even the tumbler he just had water in is by Waterford, worth as much as a whole set of living essentials to furnish a small studio, and that makes him more confused and frustrated.
“Yes, Steve, of course I’m interested,” he finally says, unhappy with how empty the words are but he’s not quite sure how he’s supposed to sound. All he knows is that he’s interested in keeping Steve happy and if that means saying yes to, well, whatever, Tony is interested in doing that. Truth. That’s very much the truth.
“I was wondering if you… wanted to…” He sighs and the blush runs down his cheeks pinking the back of his ears. “Would you want to… do a scene with me?” He turns red all over his neck and Tony can see the color running down his chest, through the fabric of his white T-shirt.
Not a big deal. Whatever.
“I would normally prescribe pain medication but I’m thinking you won’t really need those. I have to get to another patient now, so one of the nurses will come to check on you shortly. Did you want any help with your clothes?”
“You,” he finally says and the relief in Steve’s features is more precious than any belonging Tony has ever had, even if it’s there for less than a heartbeat, and is replaced with fabricated disbelief and cheeky smiles.
“For God’s sake Steve, I just donated one mil-- a lot of money, let’s say, to promote ‘The Emergency System for the Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals’ which is all sorts of stupid, don’t even get me started because the federal government should have started promoting it days ago, but let’s just not go there. And I know it’s not enough, all my money is not enough to do something right for millions of disadvantaged people, but how on earth am I supposed to impress you with fifty bucks?”
nothing like that was happening on the other side of that door
“I’d prefer to open you up myself, just to be safe. You think you can stay like this a bit longer?”
The armor means hope. It means resilience. Loyalty. Selflessness. It means rising above the literal situation and being there for the most vulnerable. It’s breathtaking. It’s phenomenal.
Ty takes a step forward and balls his hands into fists. “He doesn’t need to,” he says from between his teeth. “He’d be proud to show off his alpha’s name where it belongs.”
He’s great. He’s perfect.
What if Tony manages to prove himself wrong by just being too much like always? What if Steve finds out finally, like all of the other ones, that Tony is not good enough for the scene and not worth Steve’s time? What if he figures out that Tony’s just not good enough in general, despite all of his efforts, and stops loving him?
Steve is blushing all over. He is smiling and casual, on the outside at least, but Tony can see the red that’s already spread down the neck of his t-shirt and the narrow strip of skin between the hem and the waistband as he flops on the couch next to Tony.
Getting Tony out of the government house with this mind-blowingly heartbreaking rule... what in the name of heaven is that supposed to mean?
Tony turns on his heels and raises an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”
“This did not cost more than fifty dollars, I promise.”
Captain Rogers is still pacing when Tony opens his eyes. His blood pressure is probably around zero and it would be the perfect time to pass out right as Captain Rogers finally takes the driver's seat and turns around to face him. It can't get any worse than this. It will just be over.
He can’t fall apart.
“I am honored, Steve. I can’t begin to figure out why, but I am happy out of my mind that you were, you know, easy with me,” and he presses his lips against Steve, watching the way Steve gets lost into the kiss before he is lost himself too in the way Steve’s mouth tastes like a Tuscany spring morning which is oddly specific but exactly true.
Steve takes a deep breath and smiles. “Let’s get this son of a bitch.”
Tony shakes his head before he brushes his lips, softly against Steve’s. “No one I know has a friend who can make 45 do something he doesn’t want to. That's a hell of a friend though, I wish I actually had one of those.”
“I’d love to, Commander,” Steve says automatically and regrets it right away.
Ty’s eyes pop out, figuratively, and he finally lets go of Tony’s hand. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He looks at Tony, then at Steve, and his hands dart to his pockets, searching for something from the outside, and well, Steve doesn’t have to be a genius to work out the reason for his sudden frustration.
But nothing about this peak of human perfection has been like anything Tony has ever experienced. He is something else altogether, from his eyes to his lips, and that perfect hair magically staying in place, even when he is having a nightmare. Or his words, the semi-socialist beliefs, feeling uncomfortable if someone spends too much money on him in times of crisis. And above all, the way he makes Tony feel when he kisses Tony’s lips or runs his hands through Tony’s hair or sucks his dick, for that matter.
Nebula was an abused omega who unfortunately passed away.
His life has turned upside down a few times since he last took the mask off. Someone in the next room cares about the man under the mask, who now knows Steve inside and out, or is at least willing to give it a try, because he thinks Steve was pretty before the serum and what’s special about him does not come from a bottle. The world is still burning and Steve’s shoulders, as enhanced as the serum has made them, are too weak for the weight of it all, but he’s not alone in carrying it anymore. Life throws good things at people too, sometimes, and there is someone out there, who’s Tony Stark
The oyster is ready to be shocked. The Steak is marinated and the pork belly is spiced. Tony sets the oven temperature and gets Helen to take the last platter of appetizers to the living room. He has set the table earlier, with the blue Limoges china Ty has asked for. He has folded the napkins into elegant blue and white swans as Helen wiped the dust off the swarovski crystal glassware. There will be only 3 people at the table, and Tony doesn’t hate swans as much as the fucking stupid bunnies he had to make 14 of during  a miserable hour of trying 38 times.
Tony hates formal get-togethers. The meaningless smiles and impersonal conversations that are
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dare?” Steve smiles casually, but he is rubbing his hands on the sides of his thighs, and there is nothing casual about that spelled in the universal language of nervousness.
The white blanket smells like mild detergent, and feels like the nights that his parents were away on a trip, and Jarvis would let him fall asleep in his and Ana’s bed. It’s warm, like the time life was not a tangled mess of pain and tiptoeing around, comforting like the herbal aroma of the liquid in the cup that Nat brings up to his lips. Safe, like the air in this room, the natural wood furniture and the white sheets, abundance of light that spills in from these large curtainless window.
I got the general idea of this game from "Full Disclosure Strip, Truth or Dare Game for Lovers" and adapted it to some sort of digital version. I have not played that game though so no idea how that one goes exactly!
So he runs back home when he’s finally finished, takes a quick shower, and wears the shirt Tony has said complements Steve’s chest, once, and takes a taxi back to the city because the event will be over if he takes public transport.
Tony takes another breath. “There’s no... setup,” he says, wondering if he should reach for Steve’s hands right now, “whatever that’s supposed to mean.” He keeps his hands to his sides though, rubbing his palms against his thighs. “Meeting you and falling in love with you like this was insane too, but it happened, right? For whatever reason, too random or just magical. Against all odds, but here we are. I guess it’s fair to say that nothing is impossible.”
He is joking, right? What if he is not joking? Shit, what if Tony has actually offended him? It’s not like he can pack up and go-- wait-- he actually can pack up and--
“I am from New York. I’m  here on… business.”
The guy Steve’s still dreaming about kissing and doing other things with, had to clean the filthy mess between his legs before covering him with a blanket, while he was out because he had an orgasm during a medical procedure.
It’s a lightning round of ‘Would You Rather’ questions. Tony reads the first question that is blinking on his phone and looks back at Steve who has his ‘I can do this’ look on again but is fiddling with his fingers still, so Tony reaches over and holds Steve’s hands in his.
I hope it was worth the wait :) I am hoping to write the final chapter in the next week because I'm desperate to close this one off.
It’s all coming back blank.
It’s after midnight when Steve finally opens the door to his old office. He imagines Tony, sitting in this chair, leaning his head against the window, tapping on his StarkPad, mumbling to FRIDAY from time to time. The moon reflecting on the silver in his hair. The dim light of the screen dancing in his eyes. Like a couple of years ago when life was simple. Like the time Steve remembered what happiness was.
“Golly, where on earth was he all this time? Did the private investigator finally find a trace of him in Sydney?” Steve asked, before unfolding the telegram after a few tries. His fingers must be cold, Tony thought and pressed his nails into his palms so as not to reach over and wrap his hands around them.
Captain Rogers walks back in the room, with a bag of ice and a large glass of cloudy water, right as Nat is fastening the last button of Tony’s shirt. Tony is grateful. He prefers to either be found curled up in the trunk of a car
and it took all of his non-instinctive willpower to stop the howling alpha inside from punching Barnes or breaking his neck.
Captain Rogers fidgets and rubs his temple a little, then sits back, crosses his legs and does nothing.
“Santa Maria is stuck too close to the black hole.” Commander Romanoff taps on the hologram of a starship not larger than a dot almost lost within the magnitude of the black hole. “Comms is patchy and half of the ship has lost life support. We are the closest starship with rescue and battle equipment but we are not close enough to get to them in time.”
Tony smashes his piece with the dessert fork so it doesn’t look so intact. He is not sure how long the pretend eating strategy will work, before he either starves to death or Ty figures something out, but he is not looking forward to either of those.
Tony waits for what seems to be an eternity and then closes his eyes when he can’t seem to keep them open anymore. He waits a little more with his eyes shut listening to the rhythm of Captain Rogers’ ridiculously deep breaths before he drifts off and he is not entirely sure but at some point, there is a gentle brush of fingers on his hair and a whispering voice that might be saying something, or singing a song.
There was a rush, a hot wave swirling in his chest, as he imagined them
Apparently not. Damn you, Iron Man.
“We don’t have to do it now.” Tony whispers, kind and reassuring in Steve’s ear, “we can do it tomorrow, or next week,” and he kisses Steve’s cheek, as the final gesture, the last message, “it’s okay if you don’t want to do it at all. Just tell me. I’ll do as you say.”
hint of judgment in his eyes though, which Ty probably can't see. Or maybe he can but he doesn’t care and that makes a lot of sense because Ty doesn’t really care about a lot of things he knows.
He looks at Tony, vaguely aware that his eyes are probably popping out of his head, looking absolutely hilarious. “I…” he tries, shocked that his brain can’t come back with anything, “he…” and he tilts his chin toward the alpha, but words are still stuck somewhere deep and don’t want to come out.
“Why would Starklite 14s be on the news? We don’t have a TV but as far as I remember SI launching a new rifle is business as usual?” Tony looks at Ty who is, for fuck’s sake, looking at his StarkWatch. He has finally loosened his grip on Tony’s arm and is now rubbing the painful points that will bruise tomorrow. It’s no one’s fault that Tony bruises that easily though. He has a
“I do want you to stay very close to me.” Tony says, his eyes shining, his face determined. "I missed you. I can't stop thinking about you."
“I’ve known you for 11 days exactly. It’s a small number if you count it like that.” Tony says softly.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” he asks and Steve wonders if he’s hearing correctly.
“Look at all these swirly curls! Why would you hide this adorable mess?” Nat chuckles as she finally finishes brushing Tony’s hair. He could’ve done it himself, most probably, but it’s not a common occurrence for Tony to have someone brush his hair. It’s nice to be indulged like this, despite the constant swirl of shame in his belly, to have the luxury of a tender touch without an agenda. “No hair products on the list, sorry.” She puts the brush back on the dresser and turns back to Tony. “You have to leave these pretty things out to the public eye for a little while,” she says and covers Tony with a white blanket before curling up next to him on the couch.
“What if I tell you that you have no idea who I am? That I was in a plane crash, but 75 years ago, that every inch of my body hurts all the time, that I’m so broken I might come apart any second now? That I am not supposed to be alive in the first place?” Steve rasps between broken sobs, “what if I’m not strong or brave and I have no idea how to save
Obie understands. He always has, since the very first time Tony was  admitted to UCLA Hospital with a concussion because
“Thank you, Cap, I had a blast. We should do it again sometime, maybe somewhere with more privacy?” Tony seems endearingly happy, as he tangles his feet to Steve’s and Steve doesn’t find it in himself to doubt his words; the ‘having a blast’ part, or ‘doing it again’.
Bucky shifted on the bench until his body was pressed to Steve’s side. “I’m so sorry, Stevie, you went through so many awful things and it’s all on me,” he sighed and shook his head. “I would’ve been here from the first day, but I never got your letter from before your departure or the telegram that announced your arrival, as I had already moved to Sydney. It was so foolish of me, not to write back home
It will not be okay.
Steve can hear the sound of latex gloves being peeled off Dr. Stark’s hands and thrown in the bin, and his brain fixates on the price of each pair for a second, that he will have to pay out of pocket because there is no chance in hell that he will use his employer-provided insurance for this hospital visit.
Tony pushes on Steve’s sides with both hands as they finally break apart, and Steve turns without missing a beat, as if it’s the thousandth time that he is doing this with Tony’s direction. The idea of touching Steve for the thousandth time stays with Tony, as he runs his soapy hands on Steve’s back and he trembles with every shudder of Steve’s body as his hands slip from the base of his neck to the slight hollow of his waist. He is an unrealistic dreamer, as Pepper points out to him all the time, and a thousand is a nice round number anyway.
, in case you wanted to reblog it!
“Excuse me?”
, as a random person who seems to be all Tony’s got right this moment, has asked for his help. This flawless alpha who’s sitting too close, smelling like a bakery, who has called and discussed the situation with the best lawyer out there, ‘
Right now however, he’s none of that. The bunch of sharp shattered pieces he has in his chest are not capable of melting, and his fingers will be in no condition to even sketch a phone antenna because Ty knows exactly where to hit so it would hurt for so long on so many fucked-up, stupid levels.
He tries to think about something happy but his brain is betraying him as always. Slow constant movements and dizziness make him drift off slowly. He finally comes up with something to be happy about: the fact that he has thrown up back in the bedroom so there is little chance he will be covered in his puke when he finally gets the fuck out of here.
He was tired, hungry, and decaffeinated like hell, wondering if coffee would help with the blinding headache of listening to board members yell at one another the whole fucking day. Taking off his jacket, Tony sighed and looked around, rolling his eyes at the idea of Steve not being around right at this moment. He threw his briefcase on top of his jacket and tie, kicked his shoes off, and was about to get FRIDAY to call Steve when he heard vague noises from the other side of the living room.
“Well…” he breathes in, “there was an accident.” He breathes out, trying to look down, still unable to break eye contact. “The base…” Steve tries to breathe in again, but there is no more air left in the room. “Broke. Came… off. I was holding it for a second, and then I only had the base, and the rest was… gone.”
shaking as he taps on the green button, and he
“Why don’t you go first?”
Tony’s alive and is nibbling at Steve’s skin and maybe, just maybe, there is still a chance to make things right.
“We still have pandemics?"
Tony licks at Steve’s hole and Steve presses his teeth together so as not to scream. He digs his fingers into the sheets, hoping he doesn’t rip thousands of dollars’ worth of bedding, and wonders if he can put a name on the feeling that’s washing over him right now. It’s burning and soothing, gentle and relentless all at the same time, as Tony’s tongue goes further in, so impossibly tender and maddeningly intimate, that tears start to well up in Steve’s eyes.
Steve doesn’t die.
“Tony--”
The song at the end is
that cost an arm an a leg, definitely, which someone has to pay for at some stage; it’s just that the person can’t be Tony by any means, as his arms and legs are completely useless and he has exactly zero cents in the pockets of his beige bloody pants, crumpled on top of his bloody jacket by the foot of the bed, in the bedroom upstairs.
He can keep his heart open, and hope for the best, despite the solid scientific evidence that proves him to be wrong to even try. The science can bend just this once, Tony thinks as he pulls the covers over them. He presses Steve to his chest, and thinks about the fact that no one can be wrong to at least try, before he falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
Steve’s doomed.
Steve hates Saturday night shifts.
Dr. Stark stands up and takes off the gloves to toss them in the bin. “How long has this been going on?” he says, as he washes his hands, and it’s a small blessing that he is facing away from Steve, so he can pretend to be invisible for a second.
“I have participated in combat training multiple times. I’ve got a field promotion just like you. That’s on top of my-” he fetches his PADD from under his arm and starts tapping at it “-Starfleet Academy command courses,
Steve laughed against Tony’s neck and pulled away. “Buck, for the hundredth time, it’s called a text.” He shook his head, his lips curling into that sweet smile that had only started to appear since Bucky had come back.
Tony smiles and something goes loose in Steve’s chest, as he leans forward and his palm covers Steve’s fingers.
Steve’s face goes serious and he stops smiling, a blink and you’ll miss it kind of situation, and he is smiling again in the next fraction of a second, brighter than before. “Strip friends indeed, then.”
Steve takes a deep breath. “You go first.”
“Are you sure?” Steve blurts out as he looks at the design and his stomach starts to feel funny, as if something bad’s about to happen. The way the guy’s been going on about his masterpiece of a design had Steve thinking that he’d be tattooing a butterfly, or a tiny moon and an even tinier star on the side of this omega’s delicate neck, but this, the scripted words with the simplest possible font... feels wrong.
This thing cannot be him.
This is not how he’d imagined the first time an omega staying at his place for breakfast would go, but he can’t lie to himself that after the initial panic of Tony waking up and some back-and-forth screaming, it feels kinda warm and fuzzy to watch Tony stop frowning as he swallows the first forkful of Steve’s signature blueberry pancakes, and the way his eyes go wide with the fork frozen in the air as he lets out a low moan of pleasure.
“You seem to have a fever,” Tony says and his palm touches Steve’s forehead. “You should definitely go to medical, you might have picked up some virus from Earth that you don’t want to spread around.”
He can’t help the long exhale, or the buzz of happiness that spreads from his chest to the tips of his toes and makes him jump to his feet. “There is no impression to fix, and no such thing as an easy omega,” he says as he steps forward, and watches Tony’s eyes light up, reflecting the way his own eyes must be shining right now, “and I’d love to take you out, every night, but definitely on a date, um, next Saturday?”

“Thank you, Captain, I’m glad that they’ve lived up to expectations.” He takes a step back and narrows his eyes. “Did you wanna take a look at the engine room? We did a full tour with Captain Wilson but never got a chance to show you around.”
He squints and stares at Steve. "Why am I still with the jerk? Because he’s a manipulative asshole. Like, right now, I can see it, certain and clear as I can see how blue your eyes are, that he only agreed to me getting a tattoo because he figured out a way to make it about himself and resorted to the most dickish moves to get what he had planned.” He then looks down at his plate, shakes his head and starts stabbing the stack of pancakes with his fork, frowning again.
“Feeling better?” Captain Rogers asks, and leans forward a little. “Do you need anything?” He’s clutching his knees and Tony watches as his knuckles go white, before tracing the trail of tiny red dots on the carpet and looking back at his own lap. Does it mean he’s feeling better if he can move his bare toes now? Or if he can finally move his fingers to trace the blue bandage? The ability to breathe even struggling with pain, while he’s supposed to be suffocating, or the fact that he still exists, despite all odds, that he’s still here, and miles away from Ty, does any of that count?

He can’t process the data going around, between Mr. Murdock typing at his laptop and Captain Rogers who’s taking ages making food at the stovetop. Not that Tony hasn’t tried to be prepared and gather the information that would come in handy on a day like this, because he had, so many times and in so many ways that thinking about it makes his chest tighten. It’s been all he would be doing every chance he’d get. How many useless escape plans had he made? How many hours had he spent reading through California laws and browsing countless posts on omega forums on the dark web? How many hopes had he crushed when things kept falling through, one after the other, after the other?
“I could smell the dark chocolate scent from across the hall,” he says as Steve lifts him in the air and holds him against the door, “and besides, who started yelling the moment I walked into that briefing room? You know how much I enjoy seeing you go crazy, gritting your teeth and pushing your fists—,” and that’s all he manages to get out before Steve pushes in, and they both go quiet for a few seconds.
