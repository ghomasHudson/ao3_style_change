“Yes, Ma’am.” he grinned and put the shirt off. She was a Beta so Steve didn’t see her as an immediate threat but Tony knew he didn’t like it when he flirted. Well, not
“We haven’t named them yet.”
One and a half people die.
“Steve, I am sorry. Please, I don’t want to-” He would not rape him again… would he? No, Steve Rogers was many things but not a rapist. Last time he had had a bit of a dubious consent but he was sure that he would not do this. Not against his will anyway. It was not his style.
it debatable.”
After they got a room, Steve gave him a pill against morning sickness - not that it was morning - and lay next to him. He put Tony’s head on his chest and had an arm around his waist. Although Tony had fought against it his whole life even
This will be a major plot point later and change... things
“Not at the moment.” ‘Uncle’ Rhodey seemed to be very fascinated with the boy in his arms and Tony couldn’t blame him. Even if admitting it hurt him somehow, these children had a presence that automatically had him pamper them. He knew the team would surely visit him soon, too so he needed to present a third name by the time they were here. He needed to come up with something but he had never liked to choose something under pressure.
“That’s really nice of you, Tony.”
Steve shook his head again. “let’s do it
“You’re not eating anything.”
“Sore?” Steve’s amused look made Tony smile and nod. He hadn’t been proud of that fact until now.
There was another pregnant pause and Tony decided that Steve wouldn’t understand anyway. The other still seemed to change his mind about this.
Heat inducers were strictly forbidden outside the medical field. They made the Omega’s heat almost unbearable and were only used when a couple had trouble conceiving. Although it would only last three hours, Tony knew he would be aching. Maybe even more than after his first heat in decades. It was a cruel thing to do. He knew soon he would not be able to think straight. And Tony needed to think straight. Losing his physical ability was one thing, but not being able to properly realize what was happening was another.
Tony wondered if Steve was thinking about this injustice too. And he wondered if this would finally make him realize what he’d done to Tony. He was disappointed to realize it wasn’t so but at least his Alpha pitied the teenager in front of them.
“S-Steve, please, god I-” he couldn’t hold back any longer. His muscles clenched around Steve’s length and Tony let out a cry of release. He now knew why Steve had changed positions: he would have collapsed on the pillows otherwise.
He clenched his jaw. “They had a company to deal with.”
“James Stark. Wow, he already
“Apologize.”
will do it and this will be everything but pleasant for you. Are we clear, Omega?”
“Steve-”
Still, he tried to put the pieces together. Last night, Steve had taken care of him. He had not hit him (and knowing Steve this was a miracle) and he had soothed him. He had held him tight and reassured him. This was something new. Tony was used to being ridiculed for his nightmares or told not to be overdramatic. Never before had there been anyone to actually acknowledge his feelings. Well, apart from Rhodey.
Tony thanked him quietly and started to take little sips out of it. Stupid flashbacks, stupid weakness he had just shown, never again. He swore himself this wouldn’t happen again. He would never need Steve’s comfort again. From tomorrow on.
I can’t do this.” Tony tried to stay calm, he really did. “I can’t be a good parent. I never
There was silence for quite a time. He had no idea if this was a good or bad timing but both of them were too taken aback to continue their fight.
“Because it’s obvious Mr. Rogers won’t take no for an answer unless it’s absolutely impossible,” she explained. “And by your mortified expression I could see he didn’t ask for your opinion.”
“Is that a threat?”
“Mr. Rogers, it is a pleasure to see you again.” The woman reminded Tony of Michelle Gomez with her strict look and her dyed titian hair.
“Well,
He woke up panting and sweating, realizing there was a hand on the reactor. "Get off me!"
Steve was greeted with Tony’s wetness and warmth. He had to admit that it felt marvelous, Tony didn’t seem to have had someone inside of him for a long time. He was tight, even tight for his heat and Steve couldn’t help but groan at his clenching muscles. His hand grabbed Tony’s neck and pushed him down the mattress as his thrusts became more erratic. Tony had to concentrate to press back to him each time. It didn’t matter too much, not for him. All that mattered was how deep Steve had buried himself inside. All that mattered was the soothing effect his hard thrusts had. He still felt hot but in another way.
“A moment, Mr. Stark. I need to understand. So, you hid your representation for all those years and pretended to be a Beta.”
“...I’d rip it out.”
Tony had no idea how the whole scenting process worked but he was more than glad he was finally allowed to sleep a bit. The last few hours had been tough to say the least and his body demanded immediate rest.
In his distressed state, he hadn’t even noticed that Steve had stood up and approached him. He had woken up with the sentence
It was the tenth night he was sleeping alone again and Tony had to admit that he had grown accustomed to someone holding him all night. Listening to someone’s heartbeat all night had been relaxing, soothing. He could fight his biology all he wanted but the responses were still there. but now he was alone. No one to hold him, to reassure him.
Tony was the perfect example: Everything he had done so far was drinking too much and spend several days awake in his lab without proper nutrition or water. But Steve could change that. He knew he could. He had given Tony simple rules. Rules for his best.
He didn’t know if he was begging for him to stop or if he was begging him to continue. Steve, however, seemed to interpret it to his advantage. He pushed his fingers deeper into Tony’s quivering form. “So you thought you could keep this a secret?”
Tony wakes up the next day.
First, he thought the blanket was a heated one, then he figured the heating was on, then it became clearer. He let out a soft hum.

“I will not punish you, Omega. You have done nothing wrong. You were in distress. If even, I should have woken you up. It’s my job to care about you, remember?”
“Fuck you, Rogers. I am not overreacting, so stop your gaslighting bullshit! You’ll need more than that to break me. Three months in a cave didn’t, and your lame ass won’t either!” He knew he was babbling and monologing but the words came out of the blue, blurted out as if they had been long due, and in a way they were. “From the moment we met you were nothing but an ass and I won’t let you turn me into a fucking breeding machine, so get your shit together and fucking

“I think so, yes. Mr. Stark, as you know you have a higher risk of your children suffering from illness, due to your age. It’s a risky pregnancy, we had that point covered, right?”
He took a deep breath as soon as he got pulled out of the water.

him in my presence I will make sure you can never walk again.”
Eventually, he left the party again, something made him sick. Omegas were supposed to be corrected, yes, but also protected. They weren’t slaves. He walked back into their bedroom and found Tony sleeping on the floor, completely exhausted.
do that, okay? You’re trembling.”
“Yes, and-”
“Alright.”
“You! You are responsible for this shit! Fuck you, Rogers! I wish you would have stayed in the fucking goddamn ice!”
“It’s four in the afternoon, Steve. I can’t just get an appointment for today spontaneously."
Steve wasn’t finished yet, though. He pushed eagerly into him, his tongue licking over his bonding mark. He wouldn’t, would he?
“And the many galas? What about that one? Come on, Tony, we both know the champagne and the other people were more important for them than you.”
“It is not debatable.”
His pregnancy had been polarizing (“Even more people who are trying to have an opinion about my body. Great Rogers, really, good job”) and discussed in several magazines. Half of the people were content he had finally been
Not the good kind of burning. And if he was really honest, not the bad kind either. He was just so hot, his skin was itching and he felt like he was spending the hottest day of summer in his winter jacket.
“Nope. Well, get used to that one.” he grinned. “Thank you for lying for me, doc.”
“Sir, I must inform you that-”
“Tony.” Steve’s sigh made him sick. He had fucked up. He knew he had. “Of course you can eat breakfast. Why shouldn’t you?”
“For example,” he chuckled. “Something that’s not dangerous.”
Steve growled. Enough stalling. He couldn’t wait longer himself. After all, Tony’s scent was incredibly increased, probably because of the withdrawal of suppressants.
“I do like it but it doesn’t look very comfortable.”
Tony was so glad Rhodey was here. He was like his personal rock sheltering him from the turbulent waters that were his life now. He was Tony Stark. He didn’t need protection from an alien army, he could deal with a robot trying to kill the entire human population but when it came to his team leader, he was at loss. And scared. The first time in his life he was scared. Not scared to die; Dying hadn’t scared him since he had flown through a wormhole in the sky. His fear was not to die. To grow into the submissive quiet person his mother had been throughout her life. He didn’t want his personality to fade away, to become what Steve wanted of him to become.
“He does.” Steve nodded.
“Stark.”
“Tony… Tony. Let

“Come on.”
He sighed. Somehow he had hoped it would just be
Tony nodded. “Don’t you like it?”
“I’m not saying do everything, we can see how much you’d like to do eventually.”
“Don’t you think you can cope with the pain without medication? I mean you survived Afghanistan. You can surely survive a birth.”
“No, you wouldn’t. Why would you even say that? Omegas have only disadvantages: I can’t even have a goddamn

“I always call the shots, sweetheart. And if you don’t let go of me, I will kick your ass so hard your vertebrae will pop out of your mouth one by one like a PEZ dispenser.”
His eyes widened and he started to struggle. Steve wouldn’t have any of it, though, and pinned both of his arms down with only one hand. “Oh no, Tony. You did this to yourself.”
“I see.”
Seconds later, his head wandered to Tony’s ear, sucking his earlobe. It aroused the Omega even more and he felt yet another trail of slick wander down his thighs. “Please, Alpha, I am
“Steve-”
He rummaged in Tony’s wardrobe and didn’t find any piece that even
Thank you for all the comments and reviews! It's what keeps me working ^^
Hell, just now he got why his father had signed him up as a Beta. Being an Omega sucked. But he couldn’t avoid Steve forever and he would surely not be taken as someone who could be intimidated just like that.
They are growing inside of
“N-No, please, Alpha, I don’t want-
Rhodey sighed. It wasn’t like he didn’t know about the problematics. “Alternatively, you could give the lawsuit a try. If you plead guilty and come up with a sob story you could maybe get a lesser sentence. Punishment by Alpha, if you can really sell yourself and you always can.”
Tony flinched when he heard the voice but put on a cocky grin to hide it. It then changed to a neutral expression. He tried not to look scared, because honestly? He wasn’t. His mood swings were all-present and he constantly moved from
Tony wanted to give him a snarky reply but the first blow took his breath away. Being a playboy, Tony had often done this to his one night stands after they had asked for it, but he had never been the receiving part. He got that this could surely be arousing when done gently, right. But Steve was hitting him with such brutal force that he made his point more than clear.
“My role is to protect you and to take care of you, make sure you’re safe. I’d like you to at least accept me in return. We both didn’t expect to end up with each other so I think we should make the best out of it.”
This seemed to calm him. Steve’s arms did. He felt warm, protected, safe. Like he was flying.
He had no idea what else to call the little girl. It was not like he was very good with giving someone else a name. Whatever name he would give to her, it would stick with her forever. “Do you have any idea?”
“One that requires both of your assets. Does the OPP say anything to you?”
Steve bit down his bonding gland until he tasted blood. Immediately he felt how their scents were mixing, how Tony’s scent was changing. Everyone would know now that he was his. Tony panicked and tried to push away. No. No. Just no. But before he could struggle any more, the hormones pushed him into an ecstasy he couldn’t quite fathom. The rush, the endorphins, the oxytocin… he knew about them theoretically, but experiencing this himself was unbelievable. Steve’s knot swelled almost at the same time, leaving Tony breathless and too overwhelmed to cope.
“For what?”
“Are you now? Oh, I guess you are right. All wanton and wet for me, Tony. If you could see yourself now…” He hit his prostate with each push, tired of the foreplay. Tony wasn’t sure if he could handle it anymore.
He noticed how Steve pressed his lips together. He could tell he was angry. He should’ve just accepted the compliment. He shouldn’t have tried to diminish his Alpha’s praise. Tony held his breath, his eyes on his plate.
He nodded and showed Steve his hands. Apart from a little cut, he was fine. Steve cleaned the mess for him and instructed him to take a shower and pick something out of his closet for the store.
Steve sighed. “Let’s make an agreement. You will let your doctor check how many pups we’ll have and their gender. In return,

my Alpha, so there’s no point anyway.”
Pinky swear. Thank you for all the people still sticking around ;)

Seriously? Had this been a test? Had Steve just wanted to see if he would ask for permission to meet Fury?
“Gonna bring you back, then. Your Alpha will worry. You’re not even able to orientate yourself in a fucking house. See? That’s why you can’t live on your own. You’re here to carry pups, not to be smart. But you know that now, don’t you?”
He nodded weakly. Yeah, that was true, at least according to Steve. He had told him hours before that was what he saw his role in the relationship as. “But your nose-”
“Yeah.” he nodded. It was bad enough to be pregnant without wanting to, no, it also had to be a pregnancy with a high risk. “But they are healthy so far, right?”
And there was something else. There was something he longed for, something he needed. He was too muzzy to think the sentence to an end. He needed. He needed something and couldn’t quite name it. He knew it was his heat, although this knowledge got harder and harder to access. There was only the itching feeling, the longing.
Tony whimpered.
“Are you kidding me? You’re Tony Stark. You won’t tell me you’ll give up after less than a year to-”
to that - but right now he couldn’t bring himself to care. He needed friction, needed something,
He knew Steve was staring at him, probably already thinking about his punishment. He didn't want to know what kind of man Steve was when it came to punishments. Would he use his hand or a paddle? Would it hurt as much with his father? Would he….? Would he…? He didn’t know, he just knew he had to take what was coming. That was what he was meant to do and he would oblige.
“I didn’t. If even, I killed a bundle of cells and-”
And not just any Beta. He was the loudest, most confident, most powerful Beta in the world. So powerful that most Alphas envied him to the point where they wouldn’t make deals with him out of pure aversion (and because Tony had won many lawsuits against Alphas who thought they could prove their dominance in a meeting).
“Yes, suffer the consequences. You repeat yourself,” he huffed. “We’ll see how that’ll work.”
Long time no see, guys, well, not really. Here another chapter. I kind of struggled with this one, but it is necessary for the second part of the story. Yeah, I don't wanna tell you too much yet ;)
Yes, I am still alive. A new chapter for you now that I can finally go to my favourite starbucks again to write
“A don’t do
“How are you calling the others?
There was only so much time Tony could give someone to adhere to the new modern world. Even if this special someone was an ice cube from the forties. The fact that Steve Rogers belonged to the part of Alphas Tony wanted gone only showed how old-fashioned the standards really were. He had had more than one fight with Rogers about the fact that Omegas ‘needed guidance’ and ‘needed protection’.
“I think I’m gonna show you exactly why walking around alone isn’t good for pretty things like you.”
He had confronted her once, asked her why she was so nice to him because this was by God not the norm he had found out.
When he strolled into SHIELD he was confident on the outside. A mask he had perfectioned over the years; Think less, smile more. He winked at some employees who seemed to talk about him behind his back and pretended like self-doubt didn’t exist. Fury waited for him in one of the conference rooms, it seemed. He already thought about a good excuse to give Steve as to why Bruce had needed to babysit when he stopped.
“And they’ll work?”
As always: The more comments/kudos, the more motivated I am. Not an obligation of course, I am glad for everyone that enjoys the story <3
problem.
As soon as they arrived home, Steve smiled at Bruce, thanked him for babysitting and made sure he was gone before he pressed Tony against the wall; and not in a romantic way. “How. Dare. You?”
He was happy for the outcome and rushed to clean the table and wash the dishes. If he was done soon, he’d get blankets and pillows and-
“Name.”
I have started a new job and I really thought I could just go on like this. Heh, stupid little me.
“Yeah, sure. When you were a kid people still died of tuberculosis.” he managed to say. “I want to be pain-free. Period. Either you accept that or you can wait outside.”
Whatever. He couldn’t change it right now. He’d see after the birth.
If I am honest, I think I’d prefer to be an Omega.”
“Thank you for making breakfast, Tony.”
His hands trembled when he opened his jeans button but he managed to undress with as much elegance as possible. “I am s-”
“You can do this after breakfast,” Steve said sternly although the bastard really had the audacity to make it sound like a proposition.
“You better stop doing this obn-”
Tony bit back a sob of frustration. “Please, Steve. Please, Alpha, I need you inside me. Now. God, I’ll do anything, just-”
“If something happens to them-”
“Oh, will you? Nice of you that you don’t punish me for something that would be shitty of you.”
Tony tensed.
Other people thought this was against everything they stood for. The highlight had been him being on the Ellen Show. Really he was a fan of her but sitting in an oversized chair and talking about how he got knocked up was not one of his favourites.
For a moment, Steve could see how this boy really was when he’d warmed up to him. He seemed to be sassy. He could need that with Bucky being his best friend. He immediately went back to looking down, though.
Steve took a deep breath. “Exactly. And you will be polite. I can’t believe I even have to mention this. You will not insult me. And you will not attack me either or you will regret it.”
“No. Put. it. Off.
I'm not dead, just stressed. I am not giving up on this story or Eyes on Fire, I just need a break sometimes. So... enjoy!
“I am on your side, Mr. Rogers. Natural birth is the best way for healthy pups and doctors should just be called if something goes wrong. I think both of us can agree on this, yes?”
When Steve had explained to him he would receive rules he had thought he would get dragged into a corner and Steve would yell them into him. Instead, he had been told to get something to drink for himself and to sit at the table. That didn’t sound too bad so he had complied and was holding a steaming hot mug of coffee in both of his hands, looking at the (technically) older man. “So, you wanted to talk.”
She nodded and waited until he was gone, then she sighed. “It’s always the same with those Alphas if you ask me. In most cases, they want to command everything and everyone but as soon as you are telling them about the gory details of childbirth they want to be everywhere but here.”
“I beg your pardon?” Tony frowned. There was no way in hell he would do this without medical staff, without painkillers and without professionals.
He pressed four buttons on the machine and put his Latte Macchiato on the table, along with his tablet.
Tony already knew this conversation wouldn’t end too well. But there was no way he would say sorry to this. “Yeah… Listen-”
He stood and went to Steve in the living room. “What you did this morning was fucked up on so many levels.”
The other had already collapsed in his arms.
wanted to call them. That was the reality in most conservative families anyway: The Omega would go to the PRO with some names their Alpha had chosen and they called it a day.

“I see.” Steve brushed his hand along Tony’s side. “I would’ve  loved to see how they were born.”
it really hurt. Steve didn’t try to make this enjoyable, obviously. It was still a punishment. He hit him every time on the same, sensitive spot. His skin was irritated, pulsating and Steve’s super soldier serum made sure that the blows were hard, painful and not too regular.
Captain. That’s for lesser men like
“You are rude again, Tony. I was really nice and lenient until now but even
I am literally so sorry for not updating for so long, my updates will obviously take less long now. I didn't forget about that story, just had some problems within my relationship and the family... yeah, you know how it is...
Tony had never had problems with being naked in front of others but this was different. He had no idea what was going on.
Steve is a shit dad. Tony's a stressed parent.
“You. You established some rules. You never asked me for my fucking-”
Steve seemed to be surprised as well as uncertain. Good. Tony would not make this easy for him. He would leave, even if this meant to get chased by the government, his team and the PRO together. he didn’t care anymore. He would get this abortion. He would go underground and live a not so rich but at least happy live somewhere. He didn’t really care as long as he would no longer be Steve’s personal plaything.
fault. Remember that.”
Steve. Maybe I
The third option would be to call Rhodey, explain this shit to him and ask for his knot. No, totally not going to happen either. This was not debatable. First of all, this was a shitty favour he would ask of his best friend and second of all he didn’t want Rhodey to see him reduced to his basic biological instincts. Hell, he had just had one heat before his father had given him the suppressants and it had sucked.
As soon as he stood, he felt how slick he actually already was. Goddamnit, stupid biology. The fluid almost gushed out and he was sure that every Alpha in a radius of 700 Meters would smell him like that. He needed to put on much of aftershave and hope he would not get caught by his teammates instantly. He didn’t even want to imagine what would happen then.
Today, they had discussed it again and Tony had just been too pissed to give him a sarcastic reply. Instead, he had told everyone he’d work in the lab and had stayed there. And he hadn’t come out. Twelve hours later, he still sat there, tinkering on his newest suit and living off energy drinks, coffee and spite.
He sighed. “They want a world where about twenty percent of the population gets reduced to breeding machines. Basically.”
business what I am eating and what I do with my tablets. And I meant every single word about you, just for your information.”
Feeling them kicking for the first time made him happy although he was aware that Steve had been about to do something very inappropriate and very violent. Really, he had no idea how to handle this idiot any longer.
He nodded and stepped into the lift, hoping he could leave them both alone. He had come from Florida to New York just to check up on him and he would certainly do it again if he called Rhodey sighed. Only Tony could get himself into those messes. He could have stayed, of course, but he knew this would make Tony more trouble than it was worth. One unprofessional move and he would lose his military rank and with that any power to help Tony if things got even worse. No, leaving had been the right choice.
“I… uh… Are you sure you want to know any of them? You don’t have to check how resilient I am. I can assure you that I am quite flexible. I can adjust to any rule given to me. I promise nothing will be too hard to handle. Whatever you-”
He dragged him along. On their way back he could see the door he had been looking for and would have found if he had decided to say no to the champagne. Another time, he swore himself. Next time he would get Fury everything he needed.
“...will heal faster. Supersoldier, remember? I’ll let Bruce have a look tomorrow.”
“God, not that face. You are making your lecture face.”
“They seem to have failed, Sir.”

The clock was ticking too loud. Why did he even need a damn clock? Why did he need machines that made that kind of noise? Why could he not even listen to his goddamn music? Black Sabbath sounded like an odd noise someone would put into an alarm to make it sound gruesome. His head was throbbing to the music. Fucking stupid headache.
Steve and Tony talk. The wrong person apologizes.
“Oh, shut up,” he snorted. “I think I’ll go for… Charlotte. Charlie. Simple. Nice. Has a good ring to it. Steve can choose the second name if he really wants to but I think the names are set now.”
he gasped. “
Tony meets Bucky
“Allowed to…?”
And as good as it made him feel, it was also one of the main reasons he and Steve Rogers did not get along at all.
“You look stressed. Don’t be. I bet every pregnancy and childcare book will tell you the same.”
Even beforehand, he and Steve had discussed what to say to the press as even Steve knew that the truth was unconventional at best. They were not in the forties anymore. Not that it would have mattered; well over half of the population were still dicks. No matter what Tony would have said; in the public eye he had it coming. An unmated Omega in hiding? Scandalous. He often joked that they’d soon release a movie about that aspect of his life.
Like Steve had said earlier, the guilt fell from his shoulders. Maybe being an Omega had really its advantages. If he had been an Alpha in this situation he would have had abused his Omega and considering his strong attitude towards abuse he would have needed much of time to get over this fact.
“Fuck you, Rogers.”
Steve’s thrusts got harder, faster and Tony felt how he was melting into a content subspace where he only responded to them. He felt great, felt like he was being torn apart and put back together with every thrust. Steve hovered over him, he had turned the shorter man by now and looked into his hazel brown eyes.
Steve smiled. Softly, not afraid anymore. It was strange to see and made Tony frown. “You would never hurt me.”
19, then. He felt like crying when he reached 15. It hurt. He would have never thought how
“Alright, I’ll keep it in mind for the next time.”
“None of our agents have the-”
take those days off, Tony. It’s your heat, I want us to be in this together. And every respectable alpha should think the same.” He had never heard of
“I… I… “
“Never had a good sleep, even before I presented.”
Tony wants to sue Steve but a voice of reason tells him not to.
Tony didn’t trust the Alpha. Not even a bit. But his upset stomach would trust that damn soup. He was hungry. After all, he had barely been able to digest breakfast. At the same time, he never wanted to eat again. Steve was not friendly. He was one of those entitled Alpha idiots thinking they could do with their Omega what they wanted. He was one of those Alphas Tony hated. This was no change of heart. He just didn’t know what would await him.
He took a deep breath. He was Tony Stark, not a stupid, daft Omega like Rogers would think. He had taken those illegal suppressants since he was thirteen, that made about thirty years now. If he would find no one during his heat he might die. This had always been a risk of taking them, right after infertility and distress. It had been worth it. Without an Alpha, he might die. Might. The first option he had was to go into his panic room, get some toys on the way and just hope that he would survive the next three days. Not the best choice he had, really.
He turned around, went towards the elevator and stopped when it opened. JARVIS didn’t say anything, which meant it could only be a handful of people. When he saw who of them it was, he sighed internally.
Tony goes to Fury and regrets it instantly.
Tony fucks up at Breakfast.
Steve didn’t press the issue further. but at least this explained the hostile attitude Tony had given him the moment they met. “How did he evade the recognition procedures? You can’t just drive to the PRO and declare your presentation without backup checks
“Yeah…” he sighed. “Thanks for the reminder.”
“Mrs. Gatehouse,” he nodded politely and gestured Tony to sit. The engineer waited until Steve himself was already seated. He was not a dog. “We came to you because Tony seems to have withheld his Omega nature from the Registration.”
“Looks like we’re staying here tonight. You’re in no condition to get back home. I hope you’re proud of yourself.”
“Yes, actually,” Steve said. “I wanted to inform myself if home birth was possible.”
“No, not really. You might have a higher heart rate but nothing serious.”
Apart from that, he had spent the last two months by designing the nursery and nest. Tony had had no idea how strong the urge to build one would get in the seventh month. Before he had fully realized it, he had looked through several IKEA catalogs and hired a professional interior decorator.
"You could say so."
“Listen to me-” Steve took a step towards him and Tony and Rhodey immediately stood and put himself in front of the former playboy.
“I know, Rhodey. Thank you for this. I swear, I… thank you.”
“I understand that. Really, I do” He glared to the infants. “You could call one after me.”
“Are you… okay?”
When Tony had gone to college with fourteen he had been the youngest student they had ever had. Naturally, his obnoxious know-it-all behaviour had gotten him into trouble in no time. He had been more of a loner until Rhodey had taken him under his wing.
“Yeah. Actually, we have.” He pointed to Tony although he knew the other had no idea what he was talking about. “We have a very big problem.”
“Shh, I’ve got you.” Tony felt how Steve wrapped his arms around his body to soothe him. The Omega was still trembling, trying to cope with what had just happened.
“Yeah, I get it. Breeding machine and entertainer. Now, if you excuse me, gotta go to the restroom.
“Oh,” he blushed. “I mean… If that would be okay?”
“Tony?” Not him. Tony produced a last coherent thought. Not him. not Steve. Of all the stupid people in this building, it couldn’t be Steve. “Are you…? Tony!”
Tony had needed English lessons from a private tutor, Dominique had been fired and to this day, he dreamed in French and not English. Not that Steve knew that. Tony didn’t like him enough to tell him these anecdotes.
“Accurate,” Tony assured him and looked at the clock. It was two PM. Good. He took a pill.
“Alright.” Tony sat down, shifting in his seat a bit.
She sighed. “It doesn’t work like that, Mr. Rogers. This test would but your pups and Mr. Stark at risk. And we don’t do them here because we think it isn't morally justifiable.”
Steve sighed and continued speaking. “It was impossible how you behaved at the PRO, Tony. Really, I can’t believe that you would embarrass yourself
“Not even the pains of labor can shut you up, I see.”
He worked another twenty minutes until he stopped.
Tony sat down, hands at the table. “You could’ve told us we would both be on that mission.”
Too well he remembered how his mother had received not the least bit of help with him and he had been a handful. His father had shrugged it off, occasionally even punished his mother for the way Tony had spoken or acted. And he could imagine all too well how Steve would do the same. This pregnancy was a potential set of punishments that would come much later.
He could not need JARVIS between his throbbing headache and his nausea, really. The last thing he needed right now was a loud voice.
“Then stop acting like one!” he hissed. “Really, just- just stop. Just go back to your room and do whatever you want, as always. I can’t deal with this right now.”
Tony explains his reasoning more to Steve.
“No,” Steve said. “I
He was too exhausted to protest and was at the moment just glad to have someone near him now, even though he knew this feeling was some Stockholm Syndrome Bullshit.
“It’s my job.” he insisted and poured him some coffee. After he had put everything on Steve’s plate, he brought his hands together and put them into his lap, looking down. Steve looked at him for a moment before understanding what was happening. “You can sit if you want.”
“Nothing in the entire world can.” Only now he discovered a little note on his bedside table. Steve had been called in for an important mission. he didn’t complain, now that he thought about it. He had more time with Rhodey now without Alpha territorial issues on Steve’s side.
“You need to take them every 24 hours. They should work immediately. And they are highly illegal so don’t get caught. I could lose my job.”
so I doubt you could realize it on your own. Now listen to him and don’t think of yourself all the time. Have I made myself clear?”
“So the reactor is an issue?” he sighed. Brilliant.
“We’ll do it.”
“Apologize.”
Tony hated the fact Fury was right and nodded. Steve seemed to have the same thoughts and gave him a polite nod. It was idiotic to claim otherwise and Fury knew that. So Tony just let him have this smug grin without complaint. “What kind of mission is this?”
“You were in the lab again.”
“No.”
He was pleasantly surprised when the one entering was Rhodey. “Hey, Tones.”
He heard Steve chuckle lowly. “Desperate now, are we?”
“For what it’s worth, you are allowed to keep working, but I want you to ask before you do. And you will have to earn it. If you break rules deliberately or if you start to think you can defy me just for sports, I will take this privilege away from you and you will engage in things Omegas should normally engage in.”
“Protec- He used a condom, right? When you were in heat. I mean, you surely don’t want to get pregnant.”
I thought first the abortion laws in my AU were insane and then I remembered that this is exactly what Alabama intends to do. Stay strong, guys. They can't do this inhumane law forever!
“Tony.” It was Steve this time. “I wanna hear what he has to say.”
Of course. Do you need any supplies? I will take the days off, don’t worry.”
It was scientifically proven that Omegas without a mate tended to be self-destructive, tended to neglect their own needs in favour of other things. After all, this was how nature had created them; It worked this way. If Omegas did not have those issues, there would be no reason to look for a mate. Simple biology.
“Well, you’re big.” he shrugged and gave him the newspaper. He kept feeling his mating mark. It meant safety. Even if his father had changed his mind, even if he rather wanted him to be with a business partner, he couldn’t do it anymore. All he had to do to stay in that position was to make Steve happy. He could do that.
Steve nodded, finally feeling understood while Tony abandoned all hope of finally being taken seriously. “Yes, I think so too.”
Tony nodded although he was very sure he wouldn’t. Rhodey could not always be here and protect him and
Tony frowned, not sure if he had got that right. “Excuse me?”
“I didn’t want-”
“A ticking time bomb, yeah, got it.” he sighed. “Just a stroll, Cap. I am going insane here. You don’t want me to work, I can’t go outside… what am I supposed to do all day? Knit?”
had to admit that being held like this as an Omega did things to him. He felt sleepy, usually happy and could have happily dozed off to Steve rubbing little circles into his scalp. Sadly, this didn’t hold for long.
The fact that JARVIS had just unmuted himself made Tony frown. There were only a few protocols that would allow him that. “What is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
without you. I can’t work without your permission. You can abuse me as much as you want to-”
“Pardon?”
“On your hands and knees, Omega. Present yourself.”
Having three kids to take care of at once was challenging but they were not that much work he had to admit. He was glad he hadn’t gotten three kids who would scream all the time or couldn’t be alone at all. No, it was like they knew he was struggling with it still. Most of the time they were either sleeping or playing with each other on the blanket Tony laid out for them. Of course, he played with them, too. Sometimes he would shake their rattles or do the classic peek-a-boo (it was something they very much liked). Most of the time,s though, he was working on his tablet. Steve was a dick. He had told him he could work eight hours a week (way too little and he knew that), but that the pups had to be his first priority, too. This meant he couldn’t go to the workshop without endangering them and that bastard knew it.

“A problem my Omega can surely talk through with me
“Yes, what?”
Hey guys, thank you so much for the massive feedback! And here I thought this fanfiction would not have /any/ notes. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I am sure I will not update all too often but now I am kind of motivated (mostly through comments and kudos). So here is a new, if short chapter. Have fun! A reminder: English is not my mother tongue so if I have the wrong idioms or something I am more than happy if you tell me. Thanks, folks!
When Rhodey had gone, Steve turned back to Tony. “We will not give our pups away, like it or not.”
“You have no idea what kind of club this is. Hell, you didn’t even know it existed until five minutes ago. They did some things to people… there are people in mental institutes never coming out of it again because they messed them up so bad.”
“Yeah, let’s make an appointment for tomorrow. Tonight we’ll go out.”
“I am afraid it is. If he would do it without medical supervision he might die.”
Finding a babysitter for the triplets had been easier than he had thought. Bruce was taking care of them and Tony was sure the Beta would do a decent job. He was more worried about Steve’s reaction when he’d find out Tony was at SHIELD instead of being the nice obedient stay-at-home Omega he wanted. Actually, he didn’t care that much. He could take punishments quite well by now.
“Stop being so overdramatic, Steve. I just need to get to the car and to the next hospital. Don’t worry, I’ll send them a text so they’ll know we’re coming.” He pressed the button so the elevator would open. “You coming with me?”
“Mhmm.”
“Yes.”
“Quit being so dramatic.” Steve rolled his eyes. “Now, what is it you want to talk about.”
Tony was spared from lunch.
point. Instead, he felt like a firework exploded inside of him. There was not even friction yet. There was far too much slick for that. Too much to feel a single finger yet. So he started to press harder against it. He needed to feel…
he hissed. “You will not even
“Well, believe it or not; It’s about the pups.”
“You will not enter your lab for at least a month.”
Rhodey nodded. He didn’t wear his uniform for once but a simple white shirt. “You could leave him, Tones. I know he isn’t good to you. Hell, everyone with more than two brain cells knows.”
Steve frowned. “Who helped you through your first heat, then? You can’t have done this alone.”
“It’s your choice, Tony.”
“Is that a passive-aggressive command? You are improving, Steve. I wonder if we can expect a swear word by next year.”
“You should stop threatening me.”
“Steve? I need you here,” he called and tried to breathe evenly. He was not having this. Nope. Not now. He wasn’t due until next week and he refused to believe it was time already.
Tony moaned, his hips slowly pushing up and down his fingers. He wanted to tell Steve to fuck off already, to leave him alone but it was impossible. He felt too much pleasure for this.
“I mean it.”
He would find a way to smuggle birth control into the tower. He would not get pregnant again. Maybe he couldn’t shut down his heat anymore, but he knew someone who could give him something to counter the effects of pregnancy now that he knew.
Tony glared at him to check if he was really serious or just oblivious. Both, it seemed. There was no reason for Steve to lie to Fury, so he really had to think this. If it’s that horrible you could fucking stop acting the fucking same!
“Look, I don’t care about what’s going on. Stark? Sit down next to Rogers. Got a job for you both.”
“Then why did you…?”
“You know since we are all patriotic and righteous; Is it really right to treat a person differently just because of their presentation? Hell, I thought you had some manners in the good old 1920s. Dad always told me you treated Omegas like delicate flowers, courting, and those things. Where is your twenties spirit now, huh?”
At least twins. Twins were easier to handle than triplets. Three kids at once. And
“Do you think I’m that poor, kid?”
“Then I
“You are sorry because you killed our pups. They didn’t live because of your selfish damn ways.”
The first thing he noticed again, was how someone undressed him, relieving him at least from a part of heat. He sighed contently, not knowing why. His mind was racing, not comprehending what was happening. He was off suppressants, this was a literal fuck or die situation. Even in his state, he mused that this whole situation fucked him already up so much that he would probably survive the next 72 hours.
He had wanted to make the cooling system smaller, to extend the shields and the arms instead. But he had just noticed that he had drawn the blueprints all wrong. The construction would definitely not cool the construction the right way. If he would leave it like this he would get a short circuit in no time. And of course, he had noticed this just now.
“Both.” he decided. “It’s nothing… it’s nothing people like me should meddle with.”
Steve still stared at the boy. “But he’s a child.”
If it’s that difficult of a question I’ll make sure you will-”
“Is that really what you want to wear?”
After five minutes, Steve was done and came out with a towel around his hips. He looked very good. Tony hadn’t been able to really pay attention yesterday with his nervosity but now he could revel in the sight. he was toned, very muscular and his skin was a perfect shade of porcelain. All in all, he was glad he had enough self control to not jump on him right away.
have.”
But the triplets.
pregnancy had been a huge risk and it was a miracle nothing drastic had happened.
He sighed. “Okay.”
He was relieved that Steve understood that eating food was not really on his to-do list at the moment. He could not believe that he had done this. He couldn’t believe he has gone this far. His throat was still sore from the gastric acid that had found its way up to his throat.
“I thought about what you said - about the forties. I think I was just mad at you for keeping your presentation a secret. I wanted to punish you for it as every Alpha would. Because you don’t have the judgment
“You could have just stuck with me, but no, of course not. You’re Tony Stark. Doing what you’re told is
Tony Stark was a Beta.

“I’m sorry.”
“Mostly people. Sometimes at parks.”
Steve tensed. Tony seemed to have succeeded in making him uneasy at least. He was annoyed, obviously, like he had to deal with a defiant child. “Apart from that, you will eat three meals a day. I will prepare them the first few weeks. In time,
He shrugged He liked cooking more or less but rarely found the time. “Sure, fine, whatever.”
“I didn’t know you’d be here, too.”
Tony frantically looked at him. “For taking them and disobeying you.”
The cool gel was a blessing in this hot summer and he looked at the ultrasound with her.
“As brief as possible, Stark.” Fury warned.
From then on, he had been respected more or less and doing stuff with Rhodey proved to be fun. He didn’t even leave when Tony started to get… well, off track.
Maybe some of you have already noticed but this will not only be a porn without plot fic. It is also a fanfiction that will criticise society. And porn. Lots of it. But you get my point. Comments and kudos are appreciated as always since that keeps me going
Tony thought about that and decided knowing how many to expect wouldn’t harm. It wasn’t important to him
“Oh, good luck with that, soldier boy,” he laughed sarcastically.
“You need to be taught a lesson in lying to me. You thought I didn’t smell him on you? Supersoldier. I can smell him, no matter how many artificial scents you use.”
Tony realized what he had done and fell into shock. He couldn't move, everything went numb. "I..." he had hit him. He had hit Steve. No matter what these men had done to him, he was sure Steve would have even worse ways of making him regret what had just happened.
Working in the lab was too dangerous, at least according to Steve. Tony had obviously realized that he couldn’t build his armours with his hands at the moment without endangering the pups, but forbidding him to enter his workshop was ridiculous. “I was working on a few updates. Programming. Really, Rogers, you gotta stop mothering me; doesn’t suit you.”
Tony let out a soft whine, that was the only answer he could give. He was just glad he wouldn’t get pregnant again. He could endure a few hours of artificial heat. As if he’d read his mind, Steve put his mouth on his ear. “I found them, you know. Your new ones. Replaced them with placebo pills weeks ago.”
“Excuse me?”
“Steve.”
“I want to know how many pups I’ll get. And the gender, if possible.”
“Your boxers as well.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“However,  would not recommend it,” she continued. “For your own safety.”
“I will
“I- What?” Steve was completely brought out of concept by this and let go of Tony’s wrist. Tony himself didn’t know what was happening. It hadn’t been a lie: They had started to kick and completely surprised him. He put Steve’s hand on the spot. “Here.”
.” he contradicted. “It’s everything but.”
“My…” It was embarrassing to talk about it. At home, he wasn’t allowed to talk about it and he doubted Steve wanted to know about it in advance. “My heat is due in two days. And I…, Of course, you don’t have to participate. But is there a room I could-”
It was obvious he didn’t believe him. but Tony didn’t really care about that one. He thought about doing something, going out maybe but it wouldn’t be wise, considering many people wanted to kill him just to make a statement.
“N-No.”
“You won’t. Do you think this is easy for

this.”
I will keep on writing this and if it should ever come to me abandoning this fic, I'd inform you.
“The problem is” Fury started to finally get the attention on him again. “That it is a very exclusive party. You need to apply for a spot and to be invited. And you need to be someone they want to have. Of course, they would never turn down Captain America.”
Steve ignored him. “You will get up at 8 AM and go to bed at 12 PM every day unless I say otherwise.”
He had no idea where she stood in the whole

“Stop being nervous, Rogers. You are not the one who has to push out three kids in a few hours,” he made clear. Really, there wasn’t anything worse than having Steve run around all nervous while he was trying to stay as calm as possible.
Steve ran his hands down his sides, caressing Tony’s back, then his thighs. In the end, one wrapped around Tony’s member and stroked it in a fast, merciless rhythm. Steve knew Tony had been very lucky with his body. His length was astounding for an Omega. So this was why none of his previous lovers had suspected anything. He didn’t doubt it was more than functional, especially with the suppressants.
“Yes, and as his Alpha, you are supposed to
“Your biological parameters indicate you are going into heat, Sir.”
By the time Steve was allowed inside again Tony was exhausted. He knew they had to call Steve to scent the pups, but honestly; If it had gone according to
“No.” he said. “No, Steve. I can’t eat right now. Not after that breakfast.”
It was not too bad. So far Steve was at least not entirely an asshole, although that would surely change in time. He knew the basics of Alpha-Omega rules and they weren’t too pleasant. Tony had even had difficulties to obey as a
There was silence for the next few seconds. Tony’s frown turned into something else, something more panic-stricken and he went from denial right to bargaining. “I can’t go into heat, JARV. I took my suppressants this morning. You reminded me of it.”
“Uh huh. That’s nice but I meant really. Come on, you can tell me. Is it embarrassing or just something you think I’ll think is boring?”
And although most Alphas assumed he was secretly jealous of their presentation, they couldn’t have been more wrong. By being a Beta, he could refuse to take part in this whole Alpha-Omega drama that was going on for decades now. The Omega Rights Movement had grown big in the 80s and hadn’t really stopped until now, although there had been little to no change since then.
Steve surprised the public and Tony.
“You heard me.
Steve gave him a look, then glanced at his stomach. “I see. I’ll ask for a room for us so you can lie down.”
Steve’s soft voice was enough to assure Tony he was safe, that he was calm. He wanted to make a comment about how sexist it was that the girls wore pink while the boy was dressed in baby blue but he was not awake enough for this yet.
He nodded and started to sob again. He was crying in front of Steve. Steve saw how he was crying like some five-year-old. God, his father would have given him a decent beating if he had seen him like this. Of course, he knew crying was a natural instinct. he knew everyone did it once in a while and he also knew it wasn' the end of the world. Of his pride, maybe. Steve soothed him and stroked his back until he had calmed down a bit. “Come along, okay?”
“Everything went well, Mr. Rogers,” Midwife number two informed him. Well, at least Tony had called her like that in his head. Now that he could finally think clearly again he could read her name tag; Kathleen. “Mr. Stark needs some rest now, if you would follow me?”
At the end his chest was not as tense as before and he went back to lying in bed. After another well-deserved nap, he heard a knock on the door and told whoever it was to come in. Probably Steve.
Steve gets second thoughts.
“You went through a flashback. You didn’t mean to. You are forgiven.”
“I can see… two girls and a boy.”
about this! The pups are mine, just like you!”
“For?”
Steve thinks about his relationship with Tony.
“Tony, the only rule is that I want you to tell me if you want or don’t want something, that’s all. Look, my Ma didn’t raise no fool.” Tony could hear he was falling back into his Brooklyn accent and he found it adorable. For a moment, he looked into this man’s eyes and saw hope for himself. Maybe he wouldn’t be so bad. He hadn’t hit him so far. He had not even screamed at him. That had to be a good sing. “Tony, I won’t hurt you. I don’t think you are
It made sense now. The fever. The inability to concentrate. His hypersensitivity. The itching, the scratching, the- “No, no, no, no. Damnit, JARV, what the hell can I do now? Okay, uhm...”
Tony sighed the millionth time that day and nodded, texting his gynecologist. Mrs. Acerb was a rather tall and stern woman but the right person for Tony. She didn’t sugarcoat what was happening, she didn’t treat him like the fragile creature he seemed to be according to Steve’s actions.
Tony never had wanted children. Never. After the childhood he had, he hadn’t been too excited to put someone else through this. And although he had decided to keep the pups on his own accords he had felt weird. Not like he really wanted them. Or did he? It was too late to abort now anyway. The only thing he knew was that he would have to handle being a parent soon and that doubts wouldn’t help him any further.
He hoped he would come back because now it became evident that he had been his best chance to finally be loved, be accepted. The thing he had always wanted.
Tony felt like he was nothing but stressed since they had come home. He knew his father’s rules by heart, he knew what to do, what was expected. He knew what was punished how, he knew what he could take. Steve’s rules were new to him and he hadn’t told him a single one yet. “I don’t have to eat breakfast. I don’t want to be greedy.”
“I get it now,” he said, leaning back and crossing his arms. “I get it, Tony. I thought I could save you from yourself. I thought I could make you a better, healthier person than you are.”
Steve asked him to sit at the dining table again and came back with a warm mug. “It’s milk and honey. Helps after a nightmare.”
Rhodey tries his best. Tony finally steps up for himself.
“This is not debatable.”
“Tony!”
“Right.” he sighed. “But he
“For killing out pups. For being too foolish to realize I was.”
“Don’t mention it. I mean it. Don’t. Now, to the details of your birth.”
The Alpha wouldn’t have any of it. “You don’t get to call the shots, here.”
It wasn’t like omegas were forbidden to do math or physics, but most of them didn't do it. For one, because most didn’t receive schooling above middle school in the first place and for another because they had to have permission from their alpha to study anything like that. Most alphas only agreed to a degree in childcare or English (if they even agreed, which was rare as well).
He had already missed them. The fluffy things; The blankets and pillows and plush things, although he was sure it was only because his heat was approaching. Steve didn’t have to care about it in the first place but he was glad his alpha did care for him.

With as much elegance as he could produce, he kneeled on his bed and fell on his hands. Steve was not stripping. This meant… “Really? A spanking lesson, Cap? Look, not that I am not kinky but-”
that I wanted to live without someone punishing me whatever I do.”
He moaned when he felt a thick finger circling his entrance. A great part of him tried to push away, to tell whoever this was to fuck off, but the part of his stupid biology leaned into the touch instead.
“I will not leave unless Tony wants me to.” He said sternly. “If you even
“But that’s fantastic, Tony!”
so far.” Really, he felt like he was in kindergarten again. On the other hand, these rules weren’t as catastrophic as he had imagined them to be. He could work with that.
-Eyes on Fire, Blue Foundation
Of course, Steve could free himself from him rather quickly, he was a super soldier after all. Nevertheless, Rhodey had made his point clear. “You better go now,
“At least call him James. Jamie reminds me of Jamie Oliver. Really, I’ve never seen someone cook so messy.”
“Of. Fucking. Course.”
Tony needed a few moments until he saw that Steve was holding a spoon in his hands. A spoon with scrambled eggs on it. He had no idea why the hell he was insisting on food now, after all, he had just gotten a decent punch into his stomach. No optimal condition for eating.
a choice? Call the New York Times!”
“It seems you already need a lesson. If you want to behave like a child I should maybe treat you like one. Put off your trousers.”
His entire demeanour changed from curious to worried. He could see the little frown and those ridiculously big eyes. “Oh Gosh, don’t tell me you do drugs.”
Tony can rest. Steve isn't there.
Fury was facing the window, though he knew he could see him through the reflection of the glass; Fury was too paranoid to look away otherwise. He had crossed his arms and looked into the distance. That wasn’t what made him frown though; Steve sat at the conference table.”Tony.”
Actually, he wasn’t eating breakfast much; He didn’t have the motivation to stand in the kitchen to make food only for himself. Tony, however, seemed to be the type.
“Steve, please- Look, I am sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have spat in your face. Now, can we please go?”
He would wake up hours later in a hospital bed, in Steve’s arms with three little cribs next to them. “Morning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve would’ve stayed out for another hour.
“Let’s see… I can see one, two, three. You are getting triplets, Mr. Stark.”
“I… I see. Sorry, I'm still new to the technology here.” he gave her a warm smile. “So everything is okay?”
“Good.” He went back to Tony and hugged him. “Just call me up when he is being himself again, Tones.”
having kids anymore but so many? He had grown up with nannies who had taken care of them.
“I don’t need a pillow fort, thank you,” he scoffed. No need to highlight his presentation, his bed would do just fine. It had nice, warm pillows in it and was comfortable.
The barista had screwed up. Of course, he had.

The flu would have been one thing, but there was also his hypersensitivity that was going on for days now.
it only took ten more minutes for Tony only feeling the pleasure and nothing else. He was whining, begging and mewling, desperate to get knotted as many times as possible. Steve turned into Alpha, stop turned into more. When he finally felt like himself again, he was sore and disgusted. He realized he was kneeling in front of a tub. Steve looked at him, probably calculating whether his mind was still hazy or not. When he seemed to be sure Tony was back from his drug trip, he grabbed his neck, causing Tony to flinch at the sudden movement.
“How dare I what, Steve?” he asked back, finally having found his anger again. “Are you fucking serious? You want me to go to the OPP with you? You want me to become one of those damned-”
This morning, the taste of his normal Starbucks order (a venti skinny latte macchiato with soy milk and two extra shots of espresso) had tasted stronger than usual. It had been almost unbearable to drink, and he still didn't know why. There was a weak link he wanted to draw but he shrugged it off almost immediately.
That was his main concern. If it would go wrong, horribly wrong, they’d be orphans. Maybe it was his own history that made him be terrified of it. He knew just too well how it was to lose his parents that early. And frankly? Steve did too so he didn’t understand why the triplets weren’t an argument.
, he had woken up after an open heart surgery without any anesthetics and not even flinched.
On one hand, he couldn’t wait to finally get rid of his pregnant belly and the back pain and the people who thought they could touch him whenever they wanted. On the other hand, he was scared. As soon as they were born he’d have to take care of them. Alone of course. He didn’t have any illusions in that matter.
When Steve woke up, Tony was not in bed anymore. For a brief moment, he was worried his mate had fled the house and was walking around without much orientation in the middle of the city. He didn’t know where this fear stemmed for but he didn’t know how traumatized his omega was and he didn’t know how he reacted to stress (yet). He thought quite a long time where he could be. The bathroom was open, the house was quiet.  Then the smell of bacon hit his nose.
It was nothing he hadn’t been prepared for. Well, more or less prepared for. He had learnt much at the seminars he had visited. He knew how to nurse, well, at least how to nurse in theory. His son would have to do the most of them both anyway.
“I’ll make some porridge for me. If I am allowed to eat breakfast.”
“Take a breath - please. Just breathe. It’s okay, Omega. It’s alright.” He had hesitated to touch him yet. He knew about these sorts of things. He had been in the war, after all.
The next hour was filled with people screaming numbers, one higher than the other, until Mr. Justin Hammer - it was bad enough he was a member too - acquired him for 5.6 Million Dollars. He had no time to feel anything, after all, they were here for a reason. They needed a piece of information for SHIELD. And Tony might know just where to get it. Tony suspected the one knowing where the OPP hid their new weapon was one of the higher members. Luckily, he seemed to be one that followed their ideology blindly. Just now he regretted having had four glasses of champagne. He felt tipsy and wasn’t quite sure where the room of said member was. If he presented Fury with the information and made clear he’d done this on his own, he might get some help from SHIELD to get rid of Steve once and for all.
“I am sorry, Steve, please, wait until tomorrow. I- I just-”
Steve starts to realize things.
“And normally, I would agree to home birth, but Mr. Stark’s reactor has decreased his lung capacity. He will need much of it during birth and there are already high risks of him dying, should we not intervene.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Fucking you has never sounded more innocent.”
Tony shrugged. “As if he was the worst one. From all the Alpha’s I know, I’d give him a 6/10 in being an ass. And I mean what’s the alternative? Either I leave him and get a lawsuit for hiding my presentation or even worse, the PRO decides Justin Hammer would just be the perfect Alpha for me. Nah, I’m staying.”
“Now to the specific rules. Before I tell them, it’s important for you to know that there will be more rules in time. But I will never punish you for not following a rule you didn’t know before. I will be fair.”
Sighing, he knocked on their bedroom door and entered. “Are you alright?”
Tony was burning.
He thought about it with a frown but shook his head. “I’ve got some kids now. It’s easier to just stay with him. And… well, hope he dies on a mission. And I mean it’s not that bad. He cares about me. More or less. I mean something to him. I mean, yes, he’s a control freak but at least he does it because he wants to protect me.”
“I’m gonna stop you right there.”
He dressed so he wouldn’t scare his mate too much and walked into the kitchen with loud steps.
“Steve,” he repeated. “I made scrambled eggs with bacon.”
“You either do as I say or I will leave,” Steve explained lowly. It didn’t sound like an explanation, more like a warning. And it probably was. This heat would surely be lethal without help, Tony was sure. Although he would have liked his honor intact, he didn’t want to die. So he turned around, pushing his body up and spreading his legs. Normally, he would have died out of shame - no, normally, it wouldn’t have even

When Fury had called he had felt like he was close to freedom. Now he knew it was even worse than he’d thought.
Immediately, he punched the intruder in his face and fell from the soft surface. Hectically, he tried to orientate himself as he moved back into a corner, his body still on the floor. He wanted to ensure there would be no one behind him.
He himself knew many Omegas and neither of them - bonded or not - looked like they would need help. Not that Rogers would have cared. He was the same traditional idiot as always and Tony had gotten tired of contradicting. The topic was still brought up from time to time but both men had made their point too clear to discuss it further.
“So I won’t cost too much.”
“You know
“Omegist, yeah. He gets the picture.” Tony turned to Steve and looked at him, ready to spill the beans.
He frowned and clicked on the first hashtag. There were dozens of entries and he couldn’t help but smile. About graduation, about accomplishments and moments of independence. He liked all of the entries and put the phone back on the table. Just now he saw Steve’s expression.
There it was. Tony was too exhausted for this conversation. But last year he had gotten to know Steve better and he knew his way around words by now to keep him from losing his composure. “I know what you mean… Actually, I thought about it as well. But I think we should give them a chance to have their own name, you know? Since we two also started a new chapter in our life.”
“It’s maybe better if you leave.” he sighed. “I am tired.”
“I am very sorry. Believe me, I would rather have it otherwise. Might I talk to your Omega in private? You can stay, of course, but it’s about details concerning his placenta and breathing patterns.”
“Yes, right. We should lower your caffeine-”
Steve’s tone of voice had changed and frankly? Tony didn’t feel too self-confident anymore. This man was more than capable of breaking his neck with one hand. he could not escape. And even if he would activate the suit and get the fuck out of here, the authorities would be after him for his whole life. After all, he was not very popular along them unlike Steve.
Tony laid the positive pregnancy test on the table. Steve didn’t know how to react for a very long time. Something inside of him was immediately obsessed with the life presumably growing inside of Tony, told him to protect it whatever the cost. And he knew Tony must feel something like this as well, as hard as he wanted to suppress it.
“You will do as I tell you or you will-”
Steve frowned, he had a look Tony had never liked before. Ever. “I am not so sure about that. You might get hurt. You know you are-”
“I…”, he sobbed and tried to stop so he could give Steve a normal answer. “I am sorry, I just… nightmare and Afghanistan and it… it was- It was real and then you had your-” he burst out into tears again and needed another moment. Steve let him take his time patiently. “And then you had your hand on my reactor and I thought-”
He had heard of them, though. Even when everything had been alright, over two years ago, he had known about the OPP and had tried himself to get some answers, to stop this party before it would get out of hand. Sadly, as a Beta, he had not been able to join. There were stories about Omegas who had been completely torn inside, unable to ever have children again. Mentions of Omegas so traumatised that they had not been able to come out of their apathy. Ever. The thought of this party had disgusted him two years ago and they had only grown since. The thought of getting into it was disgusting and at the same time intriguing. Maybe he could show those bastards now what he was capable of.
“I’d rather like home birth.” he clarified. “My mother had one.”
Silence.
Hello again, guys!
“Captain, I want you to listen to-”
“I really like reading and I enjoy drinking tea and going through photo albums.”
“No.” It was more of a moan than a complaint.
“Strongest on the market. The CIA uses them for their Omega baits in case they need to seduce someone. It’s not a suppressant but you won’t get pregnant.”
“I didn’t ask for your opinion. Either you undress or
“I want to offer them for adoption. Or abort. I don’t- I am not ready for this yet, Steve. I never wanted pups. I never wanted a family.”
Tony and Steve share another heat. Also, cliffhanger.
“And they bid to-?”
She nodded. “Oh, really? Well, in that case; lie down and put off your shirt, please.”
He thought this answer was brilliant, stunning and so he kept her on call with an hourly wage of a Google CEO.
"S-Steve-" he felt that Steve's fingers met little to no resistance. Eagerly, his hips moved and he begged Steve for another finger. In the end, he had four inside of him and could feel how his muscles clenched around them. It was strangely good, satisfying, but didn't feel as well as he needed it to feel. “Ple- Please, I-”
When they finally reached 20 (Steve had decided he didn’t like uneven numbers) he was sobbing into the pillow he was holding to muffle his sounds. His whole body was shivering to cope with the pain.
“How’re they called?”
“Oh-!”
He shoved it away, denied the signs and tried to keep working. Something of an odd feeling started to grow inside his stomach. A tickling. Probably the coffee. Maybe an intern had messed something up, not the Barista. Those students could not even distinguish the stock market points from their GPA.
“Math problems. Equations. I like it. And physics, too.”
“I- I- bought them mys-”
“What?”
“What did you think we should call them?”
Couldn’t he even do one thing right? Couldn’t he behave and be good for one single day?
“Me? I like sketching.”
“Thanks. Not much I can do without the lab,” he said, avoiding to show it had actually been fun. As soon as Steve would see a sign of that he would feel like he had done the right thing by knocking Tony up and he wasn’t having it.
“I meant other things. Your nest, for example.”
He really didn’t know how he could have gotten so lucky with his alpha. He could do math, he could speak his mind (although he still didn’t trust that) and he would keep him although he had come with a medical condition into this bonding.
“I can threaten him as much as I want; I am his
“Sir, it is quite important.”
“Where were you?”
you. I will show you your rightful place.”
me this way. Your attitude towards me and others will change now. You will treat me with respect and in exchange, I will make sure you will be cared for and that you stop being so self-destructive.”
Just then, he remembered he had seen the boy back the first time they had visited the society. He’d been bubbly and full of life. He remembered him so well because he had laughed so beautifully with his glass of champagne in his hand. With his mother being Irish, Steve had no problem with people under twenty-one drinking something. The boy with the golden locks had no life inside of him anymore. His entire willpower seemed to be directed towards not trying to cry. It was shocking how two hours could change a person. If he was his son, he-
“It’s a club. Well, since March they are also a political party. They want to fight for a change in the constitution and they want a tightening of Omega laws. Very conservative and very-”
