Trench asks, less a sarcastic aside and more of a reproach towards Dean’s rough treatment. Okay, Baby guesses they’re just going to ignore it, then, in favor of more pressing matters. Isn’t that their life.
God Bless America.
Grumbling, cigarettes in his lap and all pockets searched, he has to admit defeat. He must've left his lighter in his coat pocket, at home. He can't believe he forgot his coat, and shivers at the cold night air.
Trench looks amused, maybe a little caught off-guard, but their fabric is relaxed and genuine.
"Don't worry, Cas," Jo stands up and drains her cup, too. "Gabe won't mind that I made out with his brother, then."
“Something is very wrong!” I yell.
“Yeah. Happy Turkey Day,” he hears before the phone is passed quickly back to Mary.
“A bit,” Cas responds with a shaky grin. “I have no idea how to navigate a relationship with a father, so this is unfamiliar territory.”
Dean laughs. Yeah, yeah. “Moot point, anyway.”
When they asked, I didn't tell them it was my dare.
Maybe Baby doesn’t need to say it out loud. Maybe she’s been understood all the same.
As he watches the opposite side of the table rearrange their cups, he feels the back of a hand on his elbow. He turns to find Cas trying to keep two cups upright and smiles. Cas is here!
Cas’ trial by overenthusiastic family goes rather smoothly. He meets Mary first, and has a day to relax before Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and Sam crash the silence of the house on Christmas Eve. They stay over, cramped into all available sleeping areas, and that's all the excuse Dean and Cas need to share Dean’s old twin bed.
"Of course I don't trust you! I know you're fucking him! I know it, so stop lying already!" My father's voice boomed. I flinched at the swearing, the word sounding wrong in my ears.
Meg snorts once more. “Nah, Gabe’s probably got her. I doubt it’d do her any good to see me right now. I’ve got something I need to do.” She opens the door, and music and chattering flood out.
"Oh, yeah, um,"
“Do you want to?” he asks quietly. “For real this time. I’m not gonna bail on you after.” He smiles sheepishly.
“Anyway, these are the guys. They’re in town for a rawhead hunt they didn’t think I could take care of. Good thing I already took care of it,” she gripes. She’s actually a little stung, still.
He knocks. And waits. And knocks again.
Trench continues. Anyone else would think this is a calm line of questioning, but Baby can see the hint of belligerence.
, she replied, and Trench rippled their fabric in a responding laugh. Castiel wavered, and Dean helped him into the car on the way to the Whore. He could’ve teleported but, well, Baby for one was glad he was too intoxicated to do so. Even though it hadn’t taken as long as last time, each time the wait to see Trench seemed even worse.
“What are you guys doing?”
Baby wasn’t entirely sure how to respond to that.
Chirrup! Claire glances at her texts, sends off a response, then back up, telling her story around bites of onion fries. “Well if we're trading... this one I know for certain, and it’s that both Crowley and his mother were personal friends of the boys. Even after all that stuff with Cas. It was practically a buddy-movie.” She chews.
"Are you scared?"
"Writing." I reply. My short answers don't bother him; they never have.
But he's just been stubbornly silent, playing with his empty can, so after a beat of sitting on the tree together, Dean starts.
“Why, you-“ My father slams me back against the wall.
We were all sitting around the table, Hannah, Dean, and I, as well as a few friends who I no longer know. Cheap party hats were strapped around our heads and we filled our mouths with cake that was all too sweet. It was all very picturesque. I jumped down from my chair and ran upstairs, to the bathroom, because I needed to use the toilet. As I walked past my parents' bedroom, a chill rushed over me. It was the sort of chill that you get when you know you've walked into something you shouldn't have. I couldn't help myself. I slowly peeked through the gap.
He looks at Castiel, who's still as a statue. “That might make sense,” he finally says.
Dean looks again at the email Charlie sent him, making sure he has all the details right before he pulls up in front of number 128. Dean looks over at the mailbox, which has the right number, but he can’t see the house clearly, just one of those big hedge bushes and what looks like a walkway.
“But then how would you break into my computer?” Dean teases, trying to lighten the mood.
That means you have to buy today's coffee, though.
"The goddamn bus drove right past me!" I huffed, coughing up dust.
"I'll stay strong."
“So, how’s Seattle?”
“Nah.”
We were playing around at the pier on a summer day, the sun beating down on us. During the daytime the Boardwalk was mostly empty, the partying scene that I had yet to see only existing at night. It was pretty much a ghost town at ten in the morning, perfect for two kids who had nothing better to do than mess around. With a distracted wave of the hand and ‘yeah, sure’ from our father, we had taken it upon ourselves to take the bus to Boardwalk.
As he puts one leg out of the window, I grab his arm.
When the laughter has settled, and Jo and Gabe have refilled, Meg says, "Ooh, I've got another one. Never have I ever... Had sex."
"What? When?" Dean looks alarmed that Gabe would consider doing drugs without him.
"You definitely owe me one, dude."
Cas looks straight at him, and the sincerity of his voice makes Dean shiver. “I do.”
“Stop it. Right now. Cas, Hannah. Rooms. Now.” My mother issues curt orders, pulling my fuming father away from me and forcing him into a seat at the kitchen table.
"I think..." she starts, "That I'm pregnant."
“Well, Gabe heard that there might be a house party down the hill, and Meg is seeing if one of her Sisters gets back to her with details of another option. Basically, we’re going with the flow.”
“I guess so.” Dean grins.
"Hi, Dean," he hears her response over the line. "How's the U of W treating you?"
"Okay, my turn now!" Jo returns to her usual bubbly persona. "Never have I ever... Made out with a friend's sibling."
“Well,” Cas says, “it’s a long story.”
Dean lets him infodump and tries to anticipate how this meeting will go. He knows it’ll probably be emotionally charged. Hopefully positive emotions, but Dean’s a realist and he recognizes that even if it’s positive, it’ll probably still be awkward as hell. He thinks through several scenarios and what he can do in response, because he wants to be there for Cas however he can.
Dean isn’t moping— he’s reflecting. He’s reflecting on how he got here, and how he can possibly get on from here.
Dean's already lost the beat of conversation and is too buzzed to try to manufacture a new one. It's rather peaceful in this weird beach grove, and he's happy just to sit. Plus Cas doesn't seem very talkative right now, so Dean won't push it.
Dean shakes his head softly, but Meg gets up from the couch, done speaking.
Baby watches how the sun glints off Trench, the relaxed folds of their fabric as they zone out. She’s in love, goddammit, and even with all the plots and betrayals, the cosmic consequences and sacrifices that led them to each other, she really couldn’t ask for anything more. Even better and more miraculously, Trench loves her back.
He doesn’t know how, but somehow, they’re back on the other couch, in each other's space. It’s quieter, it’s darker, and Dean is thankful. He nudges Cas.
"You bein' a smartass now, honey?" Dean smirks back, the humor in his eyes replaced with a new sort of delight. He stares at my lips like a lion, and I can't help feeling like a gazelle.
“You okay?”
Cas comes around the car and kisses him, quick but heated. “I’m proud of you.”
Lydia looks over, questioning. “What was that all about?”
I get two visits on the first day of 1984. This is the first.
"Plus, study dates are definitely not a thing," Dean stutters out, head down as he regains his footing and carefully steps to the end of the square.
Thanksgiving dawns with a killer headache.
Dean feels just a little happy that Cas considers Charlie a friend, but he refocuses.
And then the tapping at the window starts.
“Dude, where’d you get this?” Dean grabs the bag, examining it. He’s grinning.
I don't talk on the drive home, and I go straight to bed. Dad isn't home.
"Dean?"
Idly, he wonders if he could find the straight vodka and skip all this juice nonsense, but shakes his head. He doesn't really want to get that drunk tonight, so he downgrades to a beer, maneuvers around some dancing bodies, and escapes to the back of the house.
“Now you have to.” Hannah grinned mischievously up at me.
I flick the lamp off, watching the lightbulb flicker for a second, before collapsing into itself. It's not like I haven't tried to fix it, i just haven't successfully managed, yet. Yet.
Dean turns to glare at her, and Meg puts her hands up.
We walked to school together. It took an hour and a half, but I don't think it felt like that. The secretary called my mother, screaming on about how I was late, and no, that wasn't an excuse. Meg just grinned.
Baby hadn’t expected the man and coat to be back, but for the next few days they were in and out of her seats, with a woman and girl as well at times. Slowly, she heard the coat out.
Being flipped by a demon hoard hadn’t been the highlight of her year, but T’s confessions a few weeks earlier had been worse. She still wasn't over it. The way Trench had explained so rationally and calmly Castiel’s plan and motives, about the souls and Crowley, contrasted heavily with the scene she now found herself in: crashed outside a dirty warehouse, Sam broken by Cas, Dean and Bobby about to be. All Trench could do was wait, and hope, that this showdown didn’t end as badly as she feared it would.
Cas' eyes are mischievous. "She'd probably regret naming me after an angel if she knew."
And when she watched Sam pull both Lucifer and Michael into that hole, Dean heaving breath against her, the only positive she felt was the luck that she could be here to tell this story.
“You type it next to me every study session. ‘Winchester’ is a horrible password and you should create a stronger one.” Cas side-eyes him seriously.
“Okay, then,” I shrug once more, making my way out of the bathroom. “They’re going to love you in prison.”
“It's sorta— it's— yeah. That's what I was going to say, buddy.”
Hannah’s face goes pale. “No, I’m not marrying Michael, Mom.”
I watch every muscle in the man’s face intently, waiting for the moment when it will click in his brain.
“Don’t be scared!”
Weed.
Dean grins. “Don’t lie, you love it.”
The difference in interaction between Castiel and Jimmy was startling.
I shoot Hannah a quick look, silently asking if I can tell him. She replies with a small nod.
“I’ll do it!” he interrupted, starting to clamber back onto the pier, skinny limbs struggling to lift himself up. He was easily the smallest kid on the block.
Dean's insides turn to metal, heavy and oppressive. He instinctively runs outside to explain, but forgets that Lydia is still on her way out. She intercepts him right as he reaches Cas.
Friday 16th October 1983
The worst thing, was that all of a sudden, it was like my parents had never been friends with John and Mary. I heard mumbles, half-hidden mutters, shared over coffee early in the mornings, or over wine, far after I was sent to bed.
"Well, he's lying!" We swing our entwined hands forward together as we continue the trek, not caring about the volume of our voices, with the sound of the waves crashing fifty meters away just as loud as us.
"So, do you want to talk about it?" Jo asks cautiously.
She shrugs. "I don't know, I just assumed you hadn't done anything."
"Depressing, as usual. They want to redo the Roe v. Wade case ten years later, like some sort of weird reunion. And then there's the usual GRIDs death count, so pretty cheerful stuff, y'know?"
The door to the closet opens slowly, and light fills the room. Dean is crouching in front of me, Meg standing a little behind him.
Meg has rounded the corner and is now standing twelve feet away, watching us desperately try to clean ourselves up. Dean’s face is red and blotchy and I can assume mine is, too, based on Meg’s raised eyebrow.
“Oh no,” Cas smiles. “Now there’s motherly expectations. How dare you.”
Dean is lying flat on his back, hoping that will keep the nausea at bay and out of his voice. Thankfully he wasn’t far from his dorm last night, and made it home, even if he doesn’t exactly remember the whole walk.
Dean pulled her over, alone in the front seat, and Baby could feel him tight in the shoulders. He answered the ringing phone. Click.
“Good job, Cas,” Hannah said sarcastically, sniggering.
"This is your stop, Novak." The car shudders to a halt in front of my house.
"You sometimes refer to him in the past tense," Cas replies after a hesitation.
"What, are you afraid of cooties or something?" She puts her free hand on her hip, takes my silence as her victory of the argument, and takes another sip.
I try to open the door quietly, careful not to wake anyone. My mother has never asked what time I come home, and I guess she doesn't want to know. I creep into the kitchen, trying to avoid making the floorboards creak, and begin pouring a glass of water when I spot a figure on the back porch. Through the darkness, I see a party dress and tightly curled hair. Hannah.
deanw96@uw.edu
, Trench rustles distinctly.
Dean goes still all of a sudden, letting his arms fall to his sides. He stares at me like he's trying to say something, but just can't spit it out. We keep looking at each other, expecting something to happen; for something to click and me to leap into his arms, and everything will be okay again.
I spin around to see Dean sitting on my bed, rubbing his eyes. His hair sticks out at all angles, and part of his flannel shirt is caught on the back pocket of his jeans, pulled back to reveal tanned skin.
My father is sleeping on the couch when I close the front door. He's been sleeping there every night since the big argument, and I haven't seen my mother look him in the eye since either. Things are going well in the Novak household.
“Playing dumb, I see. About your sister’s little issue!” He spits, looking disgusted to hear the words come out of his mouth.
Now that Cas is back, it seems, for the foreseeable future, Baby’s confronted with her earlier promise. She said she would tell Trench as soon as she saw them, but, well, it’s harder in practice. What if she says something and Trench doesn’t reciprocate and they’re stuck together for months? Baby cringes. She doesn't think she could stand it. It’s one thing to confess when their lives are crazy and constantly dragging them apart, but right now she's loath to jeopardize this safe, seemingly indefinite period of peaceful living with Trench.
Trench does a small laugh, as if hesitant to share.
He mindlessly scrolls through social media, liking a photo here and there in a bid to distract himself. It’s almost succeeded, thoughts of last night far from his mind, until he sees that little green dot next to one Castiel Novak.
“I know. I know now that it’s a bit more complicated than that. And I hate that I can’t just love or hate him. All I want to do is tell him these things to his face and make him acknowledge them, and apologize, but I can’t.” He pauses to steady his voice. “And at the same time, I want him back even though he’d hate me.”
"Boardwalk!" screams someone in the back, followed by several whoops and cheers. The car speeds off seconds later, with Hannah riding shotgun, followed by nothing but more cheers and a cloud of smoke.
There's general chatting as they make their way up the sandy path, and Dean falls silently into step with Cas, the only other male there.
deanw96@uw.edu
"Who's this?" His gaze turns to Dean, who's been trying to keep on the periphery, uncertain.
“I guess I’m not involved in this,” I mumble.
“What's it like growing up in Seattle, where you can't even see the stars at night?”
Trench shared in her awe, buttons shifting.
Shit. Why did he think this was a good idea, again?
“Okay then, my turn!” Adam exclaimed, the three of us now paddling in a circle.
Cas finally speaks up, sounding monotone. “I was born in 1997, my mother is Naomi Novak, and she says you’re my biological father.”
It was a little maddening. Castiel was determined to spend as much time away as possible, it seemed. Baby didn’t know what could have changed while Dean was out of the game, but between Sam being strange and Castiel being more absent than usual, something was definitely different. And her one link to the outside, the one Object whose company she could enjoy, was always out of wheels’ reach. She sighed air out the vents.
“Not particularly.”
"I feel like that sometimes." I say, not really focusing on my words.
Cas’ eyebrows raise.
“Did you see the look on her face? It was like I’d just slapped her. God, I’m such a bitch.” Jo’s voice is a little muffled, like she’s crying.
The sky is almost purple, the horizon never quite fading to black in this city. Dean’s gone through a few cigarettes; Cas on the other hand is holding back and only intermittently taking hits from his pipe, sporadically offering it to Dean.
"That was too tame, me next," says the person on Meg's left, Gabe.
"That means that it's working. That's what they want from us, I think."
"I always feel slightly violated after having to say I'd fuck the school principal."
Dean opens his mouth to speak, before closing it again when nothing comes out.
He shushes them. “Both of you just shut up and watch.”
I stare at the floor.
Both. Oh.
“Just come back down! Please!” Panic was rising in Hannah’s voice.
Now that the heat of the moment has passed, Dean struggles to put himself back in friend mode, unsure how to navigate the new reality of their friendship… relationship… thing. He chooses avoidance. Avoidance is good.
Meg gives a surprised laugh, and Dean looks puzzled, too. “Do you want to be?” she asks.
He laughs again at his seeming joke, then lights another bowl as if the conversation is at its end, its mystery resolved. And Dean lets him, lets it fade into the night.
The coat laughs in a thick rustling.
“Maybe I want to be sexy now.” I spit, still feeling a little embarrassed that he’d noticed. “And you can talk about being sexy- making out with every girl you see like it’s no big deal!”
Baby chuckles a bit.
Dean tuts. “If Luke told you to jump off of a cliff-“
He keeps rereading Cas’ response, the one he didn't see because he was occupied with Lydia.
“Hello, Dean.” He realizes his hand is still on Cas’ shoulder, and takes it off.
Dean's sorrow was apparent, and she mourned with him, even as she was silently relieved. Anyone who couldn't have her in their life wasn't right for Dean— she was a very part of him, and to deny that part was nothing sustainable. But still, Dean had found something that he cherished, and once again it was taken away by his life on the road. So she mourned that with him, even as she hoped that he could build something else, something he had been ignoring and denying, something that could live and grow even on the road. Someone who embraced all parts of Dean, and left none tarped.
I return to the couch we've claimed, shoving a Madonna and Soldier out of the way as they make out in the middle of the dance floor. Dean and Jo sit on one side, with Gabe leaning on the armrest, a sexy nurse clinging to him, getting a little too close for comfort.
“You’re with them. You’re trying to get me.” I accuse him, standing up and walking towards them, the gun still pointed at them.
At that moment, Bruce’s eyes light upon something across the room. “Holy mother… is that?”
Cas is caught up in the mood, giving a huff and jokingly guarding his stub. "You can't take it from me!"
"That's what I thought," she shrugs, "Just wanted to make sure."
“I can’t resist your homemade popcorn and you know that, Dean! I know you made extra.”
A footstep appears on the floor, breaking through wooden floor boards, then another, another, another, coming towards me.
His mother rushed in, ‘Well, I’ve read many pieces of advice that say a diverse major is not a hindrance to med school applications, if you still have the knowledge base and discuss the reason in interviews.’ She had smiled as well, a strained grimace under the eyes of her family.
I didn’t think he’d noticed. All of my forward moves, flirting, randomly kissing Meg- I thought that was all subtle enough for it to only really exist in my head.
Baby’s confused, jolted.
"Dean- shit, I'm-" I struggle to say, only encouraging him to go faster, wilder, rapidly moving his head, digging his nails into my ass, and ten other things that I can't remember.
"Oh," says Meg.
And: He likes it when it’s his dad’s weekends— the house might be smaller, but John is gone enough that Dean can have girls over without a watchful eye (while Sam is at his after-school club, the nerd). When John returns in the middle of him lifting Rhonda onto the kitchen counter, he just smiles a little and walks right back out the door. Dean ignores how that makes him feel, and goes back to kissing Rhonda.
Chuck
"What are ya writing?" He asks, getting up and strolling towards me.
“Is whatever you’re calling about gonna make me cry like it did mom?” He doesn’t sound worried, just curious in that cheeky way of his.
Cas nods solemnly. “Yes, I think I know.”
“Mhm,” I hum.
He had made it home safe, and sent Cas a text saying as much. Seen.
Focus on his face.
“Jesus Christ, Cas, are you okay?” Jo grabs my arm, a concerned look on her face. I jump back at her touch. A hole has burnt through my sleeve, singed fabric exposing my skin. Jo’s hand is black and blistered, the blotches spreading up her arm, her neck, her face. Her blonde locks disintegrate, leaving only the smell of burning hair.
“What are you doing here?” I ask, turning around to turn on a lamp on my desk. It's still broken. I feel heat rising in my cheeks when I feel his eyes automatically going straight to my ass.
Cas nods, seemingly more in reassurance to himself than in answer to what Dean’s said.
Baby knows that Dean dug his way out of Purgatory somehow, and that Benny had to do with it. She’s gathered that Cas was there too, maybe. At this point in her life, that's enough detail to satisfy her and keep her moving forward, so when she asks Trench how they got out, it’s purely curiosity. That’s why their answer catches her off guard.
I slump down on his bed, hearing the squeak of porn magazines that had been halfheartedly hidden beneath his mattress.
(Is it too early to sign off as “Dad”?)
Friday 24th October, 1983
There was a moment of consideration.
“A miracle,” Charlies says, rolling her eyes. She grabby-hands in Dean’s direction, and he passes out the coffees and Top Pot donuts.
"You know how he is, head-down on his projects and homework. Anyway, enough about me. How was your date with that girl? You never keep me in the loop."
Well, of course, there are some differences. Now they also get to kiss each other without second-guessing; they get to sleep over with more than sleeping in mind; they get to say the word
He can’t tell if his team is winning, thanks to all the crazy added rules, but he does know that he hasn’t had to chug punch in quite a bit, and for that he’s grateful. Or maybe it was only a few minutes… he can’t really judge the passage of time right now. Anyway, he’s probably in the lead.
"What? No, of course not!" I stuttered, feeling myself reddening at the accusation.
Life continues, an endless round of sleeping, class, studying, eating, and generally staying holed up inside because of the weather. He sees Cas frequently, and sometimes they hang out outside of study group, as well. Just the two of them doing flash cards or having lunch at Dean’s place. It's a comfortable routine, not least because Cas is always fun and interesting to be around.
She snorts before bursting out laughing, swinging an arm around me. “Come on, Cas, it’s not 1953. Of course I don’t hate you! You’re still Cas, and you’re still a fucking weirdo, but not because of that.”
“Coffee break,” he announces 40 minutes in.
"I've got one!" says Jo again, probably trying to settle them down; maybe she feels excluded as well. "Never have I ever... Taken acid!"
Dean and Cas pull up a few steps behind, and Dean takes in the official-looking metal pit and the many coolers and empty plastic bags around it.
“So this wasn’t your first time with a guy?” I ask hesitantly, as the realization dawns upon me that I’ve just gotten a blowjob, in a bathroom, from Dean.
-I won’t tell you whether or not Hannah had the baby. What I will tell you is that she went on to go to Harvard Law School.
Cas smirks a little, taking a sip from his cup. “Well, they’re not very creative in their drinking games.”
, then pockets the lighter. “I won’t need it anymore.”
Dean coughs.
“Are you a chicken?”
"Easy!" shouts Gabe, taking a swig of his drink, along with the rest of us, except for Dean.
There was so much blood.
. Faux-offended, high and mighty. She feels exposed, because Trench knows she cares about this topic.
Meg and Jo continue talking, but I'm already deep in my thoughts again. A place where no one knows what you're doing. Perfect. Dean and I need to talk, and if the location for that discussion is the men's bathroom, then so be it.
“Never gonna happen. What about your love life?” Benny asks. “Who’s all this worrying for?”
"You're a total loser." I say, as I pick up my sketchbook, because Dean knows how to use my weaknesses, and I know that the kid will be the death of me one day. Maybe not directly, but I know that when I finally hit the ground, it'll be because of him and his persuasion.
“Yes. I forgive you. It’s not like we were together, and I was unfair to put all these silent expectations on you and then expect you to follow through on them. Although,” and here his voice turns serious, “if you ever do cheat I’ll throw you out on your ass.”
, she promises herself.
He forgets about the hungover dude to his left all through the slides, all through the discussion, he forgets about him while the professor picks unsuspecting students to answer questions about non-mendelian genetics. He doesn't remember about his poor peer until MacLeod turns his eyes in Dean's direction. Dean freezes for a second until he realizes the professor's gaze is on the boy right next to him, who still hasn't moved from his face-down position.
“Dean, where are you going? We’re not on the quickest route back to Seattle.”
"Look, I swear that's what he told me!" Meg screeches through laughter, barely coherent, her drunken state not helping.
He really is returning the favor.
I duck back behind the other side of the building, perpendicular with my friends. They haven’t seen me.
Baby couldn’t help but laugh at their straightforward way.
Dean sees Meg playing Rage Cage with abandon, an impressive stack of cups being passed around. Gabe is over there, on a table for some reason, putting on a great lip-syncing show. Finally there’s Cas in the corner, pouring drinks and chatting with some other kid. Dean’s about to go meet him, but is dragged off by Cas’ friends—Dean’s new friends—to fill out a pong game.
“Cas! What the hell happened?”
, Trench confirms.
After disposing of the body she takes new aim, driving for a few minutes before she pulls into the nearest hunter hangout, which doesn’t look like much but is at least a grill and a tap and homey enough that she doesn’t feel skeeved out. Not that she needs any help protecting herself, she shoots to the Jody-voice in her head that always cautions her about this place. Plus, she has friends here.
My lungs fill with water.
Cas smiles in forgiveness.
The biggest thank you of all to the new mods of the DCBB, Jojo and muse, who are doing a great job at managing everything and being the only reason we even have a DCBB. No idea how they do all this and keep sane, I’m guessing crystal meth.
She can’t think about it, sometimes. But she knows how to fix it. When the weight of the world gets to be too much, Claire goes hunting.
“Hey hon, it was nice to hear from you. Don’t go crazy, buy yourself some good food somewhere, alright? Love you.”
Maybe it's the accent. Or the getup. That definitely contributes, Dean thinks, as the professor hangs his heavy overcoat on the chair in front. Anyone in a full suit is automatically more intimidating.
Cas inclines his head, still with a shadow of a smile, and takes his own hit. Dean drags his eyes away from his mouth after too long, and they sit in companionable silence, passing the joint back and forth again.
Gabe coughs.
Of course Crowley and Ove are still in her trunk. Of course Sam is in the hospital, of course Dean is out of his mind. How else could the day get better?
Dean just watches Cas, the way his hair curls around his ears, and how his eyelashes flutter, eyes still closed when he returns upright. There are no thoughts in Dean's head, exactly, it's just that his gaze is a tunnel on Cas and there's nothing he can do about it.
“Are you calling me emotionally stunted or some shit?”
“There was nothing
This isn’t civilization.
"God, so close-minded," Gabe shakes his head. "Cas?"
“Chuck. Why?”
She doesn't need to say yes, or even nod. She just holds my hand even tighter as she puts her heels back on.
If a voice could cut, Dean would be bacon frying in a skillet right now.
“Yes, dummy. But he also can’t stop talking about you, and it’s driving me nuts.”
I look at him, and he looks back at me, and through the darkness, it's as if we're really seeing each other for the first time in a while. Something clicks, and Dean feels it to, like something that's been out of place, digging into my side, has just been knocked back into place.
It was how she thought one might act, that is, until her and Dean’s fling in the backseat! Baby had been privy to many a night where she had to divert her attention to give the people in her interior some privacy, but that one left her reeling.
"She thinks you're a monk, Cas," Dean says, and I snort with laughter.
Before I can say anything, he bolts out of the stall, and then the bathroom, back out into the crowded dancefloor, leaving me half naked and confused.
“And if he didn't come around, screw him.” Dean's startled into a laugh to hear his mother say that. “I'm serious, Dean. Your happiness is all that matters.”
“I’ve been wondering ever since that night a couple weeks ago when we played never have I ever. And then on Halloween you guys were acting super-weird. A while after you left, I drove home too, and gave this girl Eva a ride home—her house is a block away from yours—and passed your house. I saw Dean climbing out, figured it was nothing special, but then you leaned out, too, and kissed him. I damn near drove into a fire hydrant.” She gives a small laugh. “After that, it was obvious. You two shared all of these looks and sideways glances, and you’d make goo goo eyes at each other.”
Castiel hums. “I did wonder quite a bit when I was younger. I imagined him as some magical figure who would find me on my 18th birthday and bring me to live with him. Though now, with the fact that he’s never tried to contact me, he’s probably an asshole. Maybe that's my mother's type.” Cas laughs a bit, but Dean can hear the wavering in it.
“Be right there,” Cas shouts towards the door, and goes over to where his shirt is, tugging it on. He looks back at Dean and gives a small wave, then disappears out of the room.
“You’re not Dean and Meg!” I yell, looking between the two of them.
Silence.
"The bathroom? Is that code for something?" I turn to Meg as Jo coughs and straightens herself out, obviously a little flustered from her interaction with Gabe and the nurse. She's always been weird about him making out with so many girls.
“Really?”
"I just think he's not going to-"
I sob for minutes, hours, years, I can’t even tell, with the gun under my chin, finger on the trigger.
"You're messing with her emotions, Cas!"
I’m blaming a bench for my parents’ failing marriage.
Baby sighs. Leave it to Trench to get right to the heart of the argument. She has to concede that point.
His carefully constructed excuses for Cas’ silence (his battery died, or he has a phone interview, or he dropped his phone when getting into a car, accidentally stepped on it, and then kicked it into the drain where it got eaten by raccoons) shatter. Though he’s not going to sit here feeling sorry for himself, he has to acknowledge that Castiel is definitely on his phone, and ignoring him.
Except, he stays completely still. I carefully open my eyes and he's still staring, not disgusted or scared.
Christmas morning is a rather calmer one than many in the past; they all get up late, drift to breakfast, exchange small gifts around the table, eat cookies. Later, under the tree, Dean gifts Cas the ugliest sweater known to mankind, which he predictably loves, and some nerdy book that's just up his alley; (he slips him the personalized mixtape later). Cas buys Dean a sweater as well (surprise, surprise) and a dedicated star, a reminder for when he can't see any in the sky. Dean doesn't tear up, he really doesn't.
"I'm not really sure if I'm honest. I think so."
Trench smiles at their long-running inside joke.
, she thinks.
offend
"Don't worry," Cas says to Dean over Gabriel's head. "This is his better setting. When he's high he gets outrageous."
Charlie scurries off to the kitchen and Dean warily follows Meg to where she sits on the couch.
I cautiously enter the bedroom. It looks just like it did last time. I lean over and open the bedside drawer.
"Jo?" I ask when I reach her, and the blonde looks up from her drink. She's relocated to the bar since I last saw her.
Now that she thinks about it, she can’t really justify her response. It just feels wrong, but not for any reason, per se. Tall, dark, handsome, and annoying.
When he does, his expression is hurt, but there’s still fight in him.
Now that does catch her off-guard.
The second visit that I get arrives with an equally hesitant, equally familiar voice. Dean ruffles my hair as he sits down. Just like Meg, he looks different. Older. I can swear that I see some stubble on his chin.
"Oh, this should be good," chuckles Dean.
“I don’t want to be another Tommy Reynolds." I sigh, my legs going weak all of a sudden. "I don't want to be some uncertain kid you blow just to get him to shut up."
As I head back into the bar, I notice Jo and Gabe sitting together in one of the booths. Gabe’s denim jacket is around her shoulders, and our pile of coats and purses is on the bench opposite them. I ignore my friends, hoping they won’t notice me. I don’t want to be around anyone right now.
Trench is talking about Dean and Cas, supposedly, but it sounds pointed. Baby doesn’t have much to say to that— she’d like to reconcile too, but she’s not the one at fault here. She’s stubborn, and she needs an apology first.
, Baby tries to rumble comfortingly, even though she’s still mad, she reminds herself, still mad.
They sit in silence for another few minutes, looking up at the mostly blank sky. Dean sees an airplane blink past, and is almost ready to call an end to it and head inside when Cas speaks again.
Trench considered.
"Whatever you say, Sammy." Dean replies, the front door slamming behind us too quickly for him to reply.
He thinks of Lydia and feels sick, but it doesn't change his answer. “It’s not a game,” Dean manages.
The chance to ask Charlie comes fairly quickly after Thanksgiving break, when study group afternoon turns into ‘show Cas a million necessary movies’ night.
I check my watch. 8:34. I should get going soon, since I'd agreed to be at Dean's house by 8:40. We'd made arrangements for him to take us and our friends to the Boardwalk, in his dad's old Impala. I'm pretty sure that Dean can't drive legally yet, but he's taken us to Boardwalk a couple of times and no one has died yet, so that's a good sign.
Shut up, shut up, shut up—
"What date? What girl?"
He caves under the intense look and tentatively nudges the shoulder next to him. After a delay, Sunglasses manages to sit upright, though Dean suspects his eyes are probably still closed behind the shades.
Focus on his face. Focus on his face. Focus on his face. Don't focus on his thigh pressing against your crotch, as he pins you down. Don't focus on how sweaty your palms are getting, gripping the fibres of his polyester carpet. Don't focus on the way your heart slams against your rib cage; it's beating so fast.
"Could you grab my dad's car keys? They're on his bedside drawer."
Silence.
Jo and Gabe are kissing, her hands hanging around his neck, his on her waist, both of their eyes closed. Eventually they separate, staring at each other. I don’t know who kissed who, and it almost appears they don’t know, either.
But still, she’s more mad at herself than at Cas; now that she’s ready to forgive openly, to talk it out, all those missed opportunities haunt her, and it’s only herself to blame.
Jo turns on her heel and runs back into the bar, the heavy metal door slamming behind her, clanging and echoing through the alleyway.
“You do?”
Dean huffs a small laugh. “Yeah, actually, I think I’m great. I just have some things to tell you, is all.”
Meg and I stumble down the streets, not cold, despite the month. Maybe it's the neon, or the alcohol that puts soft edges on everything. The others are all still in the bar, where Jo's dancing under a spotlight, and Dean and Gabe are trying to pick up girls. Meg and I had just drawn short straws and have been sent to buy four more packs of cigarettes, despite my protests that I don't even smoke.
Hannah's gasp.
Gabe bursts into laughter as well, "It was ages ago, man! Your sister's really hot!"
His dad calls too often and his mom just watches the phone ring, not picking up, but not rejecting the call, either. He tries to focus on his homework.
"I beg to differ. I saw your dick this one time in the locker room and I've yet to recover."
"Man, that's bullshit, I'm sorry," Dean replies. Cas just inclines his head. "What would you study if you could?"
“Alright, enough. I might as well say what I came to say. You wouldn’t mind getting us some coffee, would you, hon?” Meg looks at Charlie.
Silence.
So I lay on my bed, and wait for sleep to take me.
She's met with a mocking silence.
She turns to Dean. “Chill out, man. I know.”
The two return to their state of panic. “Are you trying to blackmail us?”
“Would you like to tell your dear wife and daughter, or should I? The pleasure would be all mine, but I wouldn’t want to deny you the privilege.”
“Hey, it’s not your fault. Look at me.” Gabe’s voice is soft, gentler than I’ve ever heard him speak before.
Just then, I notice that Dean’s space is now empty. He must have left when Meg and I were yelling at each other.
Dean grins back. “Playing dirty, I know.”
Welcome, one and all, to the world-famous Novak family shitshow. This is no ordinary argument, ladies and gentlemen. This is the real thing, my friends. Guaranteed, 100% authentic, suburban dysfunctionality. All shouting, half price! What a steal!
“Gray, as usual.”
"Can I kiss you?"
"That was... good." He whispers, and I nod.
"Language!" John Winchester calls, jogging down the stairs, holding a can of beer in one hand. I divert my attention to the floor when he arrives in the living room. I've never been much of a fan of John, to be honest. He's always seemed shifty, giving a wavering smile that only existed in his mouth, watching Meg or Jo walk away for just a little too long, the sharpness in his tone when he speaks to Dean. The fact that the beers he drinks are more of a permanent fixture in the house than he is doesn't help his case.
“Oh, shit, ow—nope, that hurts.” Gabe winces in pain as he attempts to shift his neck from side to side and fails.
His legs carry him up the steps to Cas’ place, but his brain is somewhere else. It’s a shock when he reaches the door so quickly. He still doesn’t know what he’s going to say, but hopes inspiration strikes once he sees Cas. How exactly is he supposed to explain where those words came from, and convince Cas they aren't true?
Well, then.
“—but I do know that I’m not wearing it.”
Baby’s gears freeze a bit at that word. For all they’ve talked about Dean and Cas, they’ve never introduced that word, even in joking. It feels heavy in the air between them, but Baby ignores it. Instead:
“What's this whole name confusion?” Dean asks. “Castiel?”
"Who's Dean? I'm Batman!" a voice shouts from behind me, and as I turn, I'm knocked off of my feet and onto the floor by Dean-or rather, Batman.
Before I know what's happening, she's kicking off her heels and dumping her jacket on the wooden path and running out to me on the dunes and we're kicking up sand and screaming and laughing hysterically.
Until the ringer goes off.
“Cas knows her from study group—”
“I’m just saying, we all have secrets… and sometimes, when we mess up and are a little bit too public about our secrets, people find out.”
“Lis... I'm not gonna lie. Okay, me and Sam, we... we've got issues. No doubt. But you and Ben—”
My anger melts away as he stares at me with puppy dog eyes, waiting for my response.
Cas nods, and steps up to the door.
"I'm down."
Baby laughs, a watery thing. She could just about kiss them, so, as Dean and Cas’ lips finally meet, she does.
Homosexuality And Its Diseases
"Um, sure, I can text them to you or—"
Jo cuts him off. “Get lost, Meg.”
on it
"Adam!" Hannah shrieked, spinning around to look up at him. But it was already happening.; the disaster was already in motion.
He opens it— and is greeted by not to a happy Cas, or an awkward one, or a flirty one. Cas’ eyes are puffy and his nose is red; he’s obviously been crying even if he isn't currently. The mood is distraught and Dean instantly discards his earlier anxiety, ushering Cas in and sitting him on the couch.
With Sam at the wheel, Baby hits a dog.
“I’m scared of heights!”
study group?
That tone again… Baby pushed down her indignation and reflected on the words. She was taken aback but tried not to break her stride on the road. In the recent weeks she had heard talks of angels and seals and had pieced together the barest bones of the threat her boys faced. Only now did she realize how much she truly missed in their lives, and how many gaps would maybe never be filled.
He knew this was too good to become anything, that he fucked up and Cas is just figuring out the best way to tell him it’s over before it’s began. Just study buddies, thanks.
Castiel had taken the chance to escape to the kitchen and help with making the whipped cream (making the whipped cream? What was this family?) when his uncle asked him about his schooling.
They both go entirely silent.
"My name's Dean," he says in a partial whisper, extending his hand. The guy looks at the offered appendage and makes no move to extend his own hand, so Dean drops it, a little flustered.
, Trench teased. At least Baby thought that’s what the tone was. Fabric could be so hard to read, but she was getting better at it.
Meg taps on the window.
They hug—Cas a little stiff as always, Chuck trying and failing to look at ease—and step away. Dean laughs internally. Like father, like son, he supposes. He comes forward to shake Chuck’s hand.
“Achondroplasia is caused by…”
He looks back at Cas again, who smiles.
Baby laughs again, in a way that makes her afraid she'll pop a gasket.
And then I see stars.
“Get your ass up here!”
Another thank you to Emily AKA captainhaterade, my beta, for fixing all of my mistakes and removing my constant unnecessary commas. Honestly, she’s the only reason this makes any sense whatsoever.
"Thank you," Cas grates out as he stands to leave. "It appears I now owe you two. Dude."
My vision goes black.
"Can you keep a secret, Cas?" She eventually replies.
No but seriously, thank you to my wildly talented artist, Soph AKA idjitsaviors (I mean did you see that art??? How??? It’s not fair, she’s a good person AND she draws well jfc leave some for the rest of us). Thank you for putting up with my inability to reply to emails and last minute epilogues.
“Hello, Dean,” he says, amused. “What’s up?”
"Which one?" he asks, face still in shock. Gabe is the youngest of four brothers.
"Anyway, I was afraid she was going to disown me, send me to Bible Camp or something equally dramatic. But she didn't, just heaped on the pressure to make up for my
Dean sits and glares forward, feeling stupid as Cas walks past him. He takes a long drag. Of course a guy like Cas would have a girlfriend. Gorgeous, funny, probably smart; of course he would. He still could have included Dean a little more, or something. Whatever. It's not like they're really friends, Cas had just said it for politeness—
The concrete steps are cold through his jeans. Dean inhales his own smoke again and wonders if he should break the newly-formed silence. I mean, the guy did offer him a lighter, which was nice. And it's kind of like a smoke-break situation, right? A little friendly chatting wouldn't be amiss.
Maybe there’s always a new development, but when the weight of the world gets to be too much, she knows she has them too.
Here he hesitates for a second, letting Cas adjust, but apparently it’s too long because Cas brings Dean down with a hand on the back of his neck. Their lips crash together violently, and Dean resists slightly, pulling back a small distance. He locks eyes with Cas, then closes them again as he leans in for a series of sweet kisses. Cas sighs, hand pressing harder on Dean’s neck, and Dean obliges.
“A guy I know owes me a favor. Figured we could both use something to help us along tonight.”
deanw96@uw.edu
"No, no, don't ruin your work on account of me. I guess she's part of your life as much as mine." Dean flops back onto my bed, and the bed springs creak under his weight. I glance over at him, to see him close his eyes as though he's going back to sleep.
It comes out of the blue, but it’s not unexpected. It’s been hanging over them for weeks.
She sighs.
Dean swears his voice isn't that loud or high-pitched, it isn't. He just desperately needs it not to be true.
She got caught up, between flashes of consciousness, as Dean worked her back to health. She heard about Sam’s absent wall, and Cas’ new position as “God”, and the whole time all she could think about was how this was all Trench— Castiel’s fault. Through her mess of feelings, the strongest was betrayal, and the second strongest was a desire to see Trench again, anyway.
"What... are you talking about Charlie?" Dean lets out an indignant noise. "Definitely— definitely not a date. Just a study group, swear."
I slump down beside her, the breeze blowing through our hair, still smiling. My hands clasp onto hers as we watch the outskirts of the town; couples running by, groups of drunk friends, even some girls in tears. A man and a woman sit down at a bench just behind the wooden path, fifty yards away from us. In the darkness I make out the woman, a curvy blonde in a dark plum dress. The man is harder, but I can almost see brown hair, and maybe a beard. Their hands fumble around, and first the girl is climbing onto his lap, and there's a glint of gold jewellery, and he's grabbing her ass. Then, he's laying her down in the bench, kissing her legs and her neck and her tits. Then, blonde hair is flying around as she straddles him, and Meg is saying, "Oh, there's second base! Wait, never mind, it's third.", and everything is clicking in my mind.
I consider my words very carefully before deciding that if this is the family shitshow, I might as well join in.
"Also," she starts, after wiping her mouth, "Dad needs the car tonight."
"I'm trying my best to figure stuff out, here." He runs his hands through his hair, staring down at the floor tiles. I can't see much of his expression, thanks to the mask that he eventually retrieved, but I can only assume that he isn't grinning with joy.
Dean walks out of the library, holds the door for Cas, and leads the way to the nearest smoking area. He feels rather self-conscious with a guest, but they fall into easy conversation as they walk, and in only a few minutes they’re chatting away as they sit down in the designated area.
Meg sighs audibly. “Listen, there’s something you should know. I… I really liked you. I still do, sort of.”
Just then, Sam walks in, looking about as pissed off as usual. He's not actually an angry kid, he just tends to avoid putting up with Gabe's crap.
“Why would you need to do that?”
Meg is silent for a bit, before she whispers something.
I squint at the bag, trying to decipher what it is, before it hits me.
Dean getting into a fight with an angel, being saved by an angel… That’s how the day progresses. The angel promises to help, which Baby guesses is better. Still, the fact that it’s not Cas there, that Dean sent out a general prayer, puts her on edge. Something’s wrong. They had watched the angels fall— what a sight. But at least Cas had been on Earth, right? Would the fall have affected him?
But it’s inevitable, and how their life goes. They’ll both deal.
“Sure,” Dean smiles, “Off into the night I go.” His voice is a deep growl, trying to emulate Batman.
Dean’s voice cuts in, and Trench continues,
"Ah, hi, I'm Dean," Dean says, sticking his hand out.
Behind it stands a disheveled dude in what looks like a bathrobe, his hair sticking up everywhere. Sorta like Cas’ does.
Later, through these conversations, she learned that Castiel was miraculously back, but she didn’t let herself have any hope. Just because it was the angel, didn’t mean he would be wearing the same coat. Objects didn’t get miracles, only Beings did.
Silence.
Baby felt for Dean, but she didn’t understand. Though years ago, when they had met, Lisa had seemed like a nice gal, the problem was that there had been many a nice gal in her backseat. She wasn’t sure what made this one so special. Then again, she did trust Dean to know what was right for himself, even if Baby disagreed. It’s not like she could have told him, after all.
Dean laughs. “And here I thought you were gonna hit me with a ‘the stars we see could be long dead’ spiel.”
“Yeah?” The look Cas gives him with his sad blue eyes just begs for Dean to tell a comforting anecdote, so he casts around for a memory that he can share. For some reason, before he can analyze it, he launches into the story of his seventh birthday party.
What I couldn't see was the reality of his body lying limply on the sand.
Wednesday, 20th August, 1975
"Seriously, Hannah? When? Why?"
But before he faces forward, the guy catches him with a "Cas."
-Cas’ mum and dad are based on Naomi and Chuck, respectively.
“Are you going to tell Michael?”
The man shakes his head violently and stands up, but Dean’s stab of panic that they’ve got the wrong guy is unwarranted. “Yeah, I definitely knew her. We dated for a while when we were in high school, and then her family up and moved. She never said goodbye, even. I wonder—” He stops pacing and looks, shyly, at Cas. “This is kind of crazy. But… maybe you’re why they relocated so suddenly.”
“So unless y’all been doing some weekly day-drinking, I think he’s had quite enough time to find you interesting while sober.”
My stomach churns as the car zooms along:  the music plays and I get this feeling in the back of my mind that nothing is alright right now.
“Yeah!” I yell back, before turning to Jo, who’s staring at me, looking confused.
“I’m probably going to fail my exams when I get back.”
She laughs lightly. “Where’d that come from, Novak?”
Mary is silent for a beat, letting it sink in. “Dean, is this you coming out? Because if so I don't care, you're my son.”
castielnovak@uw.edu
, It’s his break-up moping movie.”
Charlie is a force to be reckoned with on any day, but today is exceptional; she just won’t stop pushing. After the latest subtle drop that she’s gay, and a lot of people she knows are gay, and that they always seem to clump in the same friend groups, Dean’s just about had enough. Usually he’s the one joking around, so focusing so much is strange, but anything to get Charlie back on the topic of paradoxical inheritance. His stomach was already roiling at the beginning of the meeting, thank you very much, and she is not helping it settle.
That gives them both lots of time to stew in silence and work up the courage to address the elephant in the car. And it gives Baby time to reflect on their past.
"Not a problem," the recipient drags out as he turns halfway to retrieve it while fumbling with something in his lap.
“I don’t make the rules, man,” he laughs, conveniently ignoring the fact that he did make the rules.
“Yeah, please. What are you up to right now?”
"So," Dean says as they settle, sand crunching under the chair legs.
Dean has a strong urge to tease Cas for that line, but he succeeds in not voicing it.
"My mother calls it the devil's lettuce," Cas says at a random point. "She has all these strange, circuitous names for weed. It's hilarious."
"Dean-" I started, but he was already by my side. He was already a witness, and he was already smart enough to know what was going on.
It had been almost a year of being back and she ached to communicate with someone, but Castiel kept flying away.
deanw96@uw.edu
I decide that maybe there are some things she should know about me, too.
Weird.
And maybe, just maybe, that is okay.
I panic, stumbling away from their table. I need to get away. My vision finds the piles of coats and purses. I dig through it, only to find them melting in my hands. They pool on the floor, liquefied. I continue to dig. The pile seems endless.
Dean has his head tilted back trying to find pinpricks of light, but looks over at Cas as he speaks.
As it turned out, when a dodgeball is thrown by a six-foot-tall, 240 pound teenage boy, and you're not looking, it will hit you in the face. I had learned that lesson the hard way.
Castiel pulls out blank notecards and hands them to Dean to make them, since he know Dean enjoys that. Once he’s handed them over he buries himself in reading the text, eyes tracking back and forth. Dean begins the notecards with a distracted start, but manages to get sucked into it. When he announces he’s finished, Cas looks up and they take turns reading out the terms for the other to guess.
So Dean does, and by the time he's done singing Cas’ praises he feels a million times better. Mary doesn't hate him, at least, and that's good enough.
His face.
01:51.
“It’s kinda far on the bus, but it looks like they deliver.” Dean grins at Cas’ expression. “Happy Thanksgiving.”
Cas mutters that the phrase doesn't work quite so well at nighttime, but stands as well and starts up the steps with a small smile.
“Come on, don’t listen to that stuff that mom said-“ I start, but she interrupts me.
But she began to understand, minutes later, when the pair emerged from the building and Dean was lit up happier than she’d seen in years. Oh, yes, she could tell.
“Again, what do you want?”
“My mom tried to calm them down, which is when they turned on her too.”
“Well look at those two, finally settling down,” I comment, trying to make a joke.
“Dude, I’ve seen you smoke in here.”
Cas comes back out with two cups of water, setting them on the automan and joining Dean on the couch. Dean reaches for the glass for something to do, drinking half before setting it down. A little routine that he loves about Cas’ apartment.
“Do you want to go to prison, man? I can’t get into Princeton with a criminal record!” He turns to me. “Here, just be careful. It makes you do dumb shit.”
"Oh. It's just you." She says, turning back around to face the yard again.
Pandemonium.
"What do you think of our costumes, Sam?" I ask, proudly brandishing the Superman symbol on my chest.
Trench seems to deflate, or maybe that’s just the water making them soggy and heavy. It’s quiet, and Baby assumes Trench won’t speak again, until they do.
Dean cough-laughs to get his voice back. “Sort of. I still like girls and all, but there's this boy…”
I spun around to come face-to-face with my critic, only to be met with a smirking, dark-haired teenager.
“Dares. I dared Cas to do a backflip off the pier and he couldn’t.” She smiled, holding on to the edge of the pier and pointing at me with her thumb.
The backdoor slams behind me, echoing in the empty house. I fly up the stairs, into Dean’s room. It looks so cold when there’s not a teenage boy in it.
“The enemy’s in bed with them!” Bruce retorts. “Though I don’t know that I’d trust Mr. Blood Boy with the king of Hell running around his house.”
Hannah's leant back away from him, sitting cross-legged on the beach, a hand still clutching his skinny wrist. Her other hand was over her mouth, muffling cries.
“Dean?” I knock on the window when I reach the car. As it rolls down, I see Dean in the driver’s seat, one hand on the wheel, with Meg riding shotgun.
They’ve decided to spend Christmas with Dean’s family— well, Dean decided once Cas let drop that his grandmother hadn’t invited him to Christmas dinner. Not that he wanted to go anyway, but like hell was Dean going to let his boyfriend be alone on Christmas. As his mother is obliged to be at the Novak dinner on Christmas, she and Cas had celebrated a few days before with a small gift exchange. Cas had come over teary-eyed, and Dean was in a rage until he realized they were cathartic tears; happy ones, even. They were mending their relationship and building a small offshoot family— Dean held him tighter that night than any other.
"And, finally, Cas." Meg looks at me, dark eyes locked with mine.
“But you just ate three donuts,” Dean teases her. “I don’t need you even more hyper.”
‘Actually, I recently declared my major in plant biology.’
“Because for the past two days he’s been curled up watching nature documentaries, only taking breaks to moan and groan to me about it. He thinks he doesn’t want to talk to you, but he does. Knock some sense into him.”
“Ugh!” Gabe’s head pops out from between the railings and he stumbles backwards, hitting the wall behind him. He stares at Jo, also breathing deeply, unsure of what to say.
I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to do, I’m so fucking scared, I’m just a kid, I don’t know what to do—
The only space left is an empty chair nestled between Meg and, of course, Dean. I dump my tray down and the Coca Cola bottle on it rattles and tips over, causing it to bubble up.
She’s left alone.
As it creaked open, my mother's head shot up. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over, weaker and tinier than she had ever looked before.
“Well, look who came crawlin’ back.”
“Here, got you something. Um, I just thought, since you mentioned not having any other clothes.”
, she screamed silently. In her desperation, she moved the slightest fraction of an inch— enough that the reflection off her roof caught his eye and he really looked at her. Against all odds, she watched as years worth of memories—ones she and Dean and Sam had shared together—pulled Sam from Lucifer’s hold.
todays notes
Well, that and a couple more beers.
“Well, first I have to explain.” Everything sounds silly in his head, and he doesn't know how to make Cas quite understand. “I told you that story about my seventh birthday party, right? My dad got there totally drunk, for one, then tried to drive me and my brother home with him in that state. My mother was furious, they almost came to blows. Just to give you an idea of the sort of guy he was.” Dean waves his hand. “That's not the important part. The important part is I grew up with clear ideas of who I had to be to live up to his standards. I'm sure you relate.” Dean tries for some connection, and sees that it might be succeeding. “I loved him, and I wanted to make him proud. And he was very clear that being a fag was not part of that. Needless to say, it doesn't feel
“I mean you’re so butch, you must’ve been compensating for something.” Dean is again surprised into a laugh and Sam joins him, the solemnity of the past hour dissolving.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice is softer than Dean would've expected. “I understand what it's like, too. My mom wasn't thrilled, nor my family. I didn't realize you were still closeted.”
This is rats trapped in a well-organized cage.
Cas nods slightly, but takes a bit to start talking.
Her gaze turns on Cas finally, and Dean can almost feel the wave of rage and betrayal that Cas directs towards him.
Somehow, distractedly, dangerously, she and Dean drive to a hotel parking lot. After Dean parks, there’s a moment of awkward hesitation. After all this time, they still hesitate? Baby rolls her headlights, and Trench laughs.
Oh, God.
Baby is silent, unsure how to ask this question that's haunting her, when Ove interjects.
"How about 'never have I ever'?" I say, and everyone else looks up.
Cas’ eyes are asking some sorta question that Dean doesn’t know how to answer, so instead he just replies, “Of course. But I’m driving.”
Trench grins.
, but he’s currently hyper-aware of Lydia's attention on this exchange. His chest squeezes. It's like some kind of torture device: his internal soup of shame, embarrassment, his father's negative reinforcement, the slurs someone graffitied on his neighbor’s mailbox when he was 7; all of that versus the force of what he wants to say, the strong friendship they've built, the pride flags that started appearing in Lawrence right before he left, this city,
"Nope! I'm out! You two are gross!" Dean stands up and escapes the couch, oddly disgusted by Gabe and the nurse, considering he'd usually be cheering them on. He disappears into the crowd and Jo and I readjust just as Meg appears and settles down in Dean's place. Jo groans as she's once again pushed against Gabe's ass.
Meg, the driver for the evening, had driven the others home, and since Dean and I live in a different part of the suburb, we were dropped off ten minutes for from our houses.
As if they can hear her thinking, Trench looks up, catches her looking, and narrows their gaze fondly.
Benny sighs, mouth twisting into a smile. “Brother, you are really wrapped around the axle for this boy.”
“I told you about my birthday party on the drive here? Well, it wasn’t like that exactly. My dad was late, he almost missed it. My parents wouldn’t stop arguing at home, so I played soldiers to distract Sammy. But it was still a great birthday. I guess what I’m saying is, we all have to deal with our dads being slightly clueless, making mistakes and all, but that doesn't mean they don't have the potential for a good relationship.”
And then it's silent, and then Meg says, "Oh."
I ran over to where Hannah was still shaking Adam, her sobs returning.
Just as Dean is suggesting they come back later, there’s a noise at the door and it opens.
Suddenly, I hear a smash. I glance down at myself, and see shards of glass spread out across my lap, the scent of alcohol in the air as it drenches my jeans. My hands are still hovering, holding an imaginary glass.
I let myself in through the back door, since I've known the Winchesters long enough to know that none of them can ever remember to lock it. Sam's the only one with half a brain, but he's inherited Dean's habit of never using it.
so heads up I invited my friend cas to study group today
I gave a heavy sigh, only to choke out a sob again.
She’s not happy about it, but then neither is Trench. They’ve only just become friendly again, and it pains her for it to be cut short so soon.
Baby didn't know what to say. All that time in lock-up and this was what had been happening? She didn't know whether to feel guilty or angry or betrayed or forgiving, or all of them at once.
Dean’s expression reads:
But here was this coat, always at the center of the action, it seemed.
The bright blue vest he's wearing is a shock, and a bad reminder. She winces and looks away, studies the gas pumps.
This is the only way.
Then: him and Sammy playing in a kiddie pool in the backyard. A shiny moment in time. His brain adds details from later, more cynical memories— the dead grass in the summer and the scorching heat of the concrete stepping stones. Dean’s splashing his brother, pushing him, holding him under the water— he gets carried away and Sammy comes up crying. It’ll be forgotten in a minute, it didn’t mean anything, but grown-ups just don’t get that.
I make my way up to the second floor, leaving behind Gabe's whines of “jeez- y'know you guys do that a lot? What was I even saying wrong? I think my leg is broken! I'll never walk again!”
Dean begins laughing, a cynical grin forming on his face.
I close my eyes, let myself sink into it. I let myself enjoy it, like I’ve been afraid to do for so long. This is the first time where I’ve fully and truly been okay with us kissing.
Made it home safe. Let me know that you did too
Cas still looks stoic, and Dean’s played his whole hand. He doesn't know what else he can say, expect the bare truth, and hope it's enough. He stands up and steps towards Cas.
“You got what you asked for, Dean. No paradise. No hell. Just more of the same. I mean it, Dean. What would you rather have? Peace or freedom?”
The coat stirs weakly.
, he sniffs, the haughtiness in his voice contrasting sillily with his accent.
“Oh, and,” she says, as she opens the door to leave, “if you break his heart I’ll break your face, so don’t let me down, Dean-o.”
“Thanks,” I call out behind me as I head out of the bathroom, back into the bar where music reaches my ears once again. I slump down on a stool, focusing on the feeling under my tongue.
That’s exactly what I’m doing: stumbling down a backstreet of Boardwalk, on my own, with no idea where the others are.
He knows he doesn’t have to. It's not what Cas had asked from him. And maybe Cas will accept him anyway, but he feels the need to put a stamp on this apology, verify it with action. Or, at least, with a phone call.
“Wait,” says Ash, “you too, Dean.”
As he pulls down my boxers, he looks up at me.
Hannah’s answer isn’t what I expect.
Baby isn’t sure, but she could’ve sworn she just saw Trench, walking with Cas by the road. Apparently Dean gets the same vision, because he backs her up, but once they’re stopped, there’s no sign of either Trench or Castiel.
"Shut the hell up, you mere mortal!" Dean's voice breaks, revealing the sixteen year old boy beneath his costume.
I made my way to the kitchen, while Dean climbed the stairs.
“Castiel!” Chuck still looks scruffy, but he’s cleaned up at bit and is wearing actual clothes, so that’s a bonus. And an ugly deer-patterned sweater— oh god. Dean hopes it’s ironic, but that’s probably wishful thinking. At least Cas will get a kick out of it.
"Yeah."
I give a small laugh and pull her in closer to me. All this time I’ve been so afraid, and for what?
Dean’s at an honest-to-god house party. It’s like he never left Kansas.
Dean smiles sheepishly. “Thanks.”
Not as gracefully as he would like, he bends to Cas’ ear to ask something or other, and accidentally ends up cheek to cheek. He jolts back to a safer distance.
, they say quietly.
“Cas, we don’t want to hurt you.” Dean tries to say calmly, but tears are silently dripping down his face.
Cas looks like he’s about to casually slip off the side of the dock into the water.
A cloud of smoke wafts over him as his cigarette lays idle between his fingers, and he breathes it in on impulse. It's not his thing, and it smells too strong, but it’s at least better than that froufrou watermelon smoke inside. Ick.
Dean's brain does a short tangent on the word 'rough' in that voice, before he snaps himself back to present.
She and Trench look at each other. There’s so many things to say, but now that they’ve said what’s important, everything else feels ancillary. There will be time. There will always be time. If Baby’s learned anything since she’s met Trench, it’s that Cas and Trench will always return to her. Even through death, apparently; death cannot stop true love, as Dean is fond of quoting. She has to say it's proved very true.
? Of Ove of all Objects?
“Can I kiss you?” I murmur, fixated on his eyes.
Meg and I separate slowly, as I keep my hands on her waist. Trying to get back at Dean or not, kissing her is amazing, and I mentally kick myself for only ever doing anything romantic when it’s for my own selfish desires.
Gabe shrugs, "Never, I just wanted to drink."
Dean takes the bunch of cloth from the back and turns towards Cas in the passenger seat. Baby just watches the interaction, numb. This connection is what she and Trench had seen and wanted, joked about, and something they had built their own connection on, and now Trench isn’t here to see it. The fact that Trench is gone sours her emotions, but she watches anyway.
Dean doesn't usually sit so close to the front of the lecture hall, preferring the middle range, but he's running a little late and decides to beeline toward the first empty chair he sees. As he takes off his backpack and slides into the seat, he realizes he's picked a spot next to a preppy-looking student wearing sunglasses. Inside. On an overcast day.
Cas looks like he’s about to say ‘no’, but surprisingly lets him in, stalking away to the kitchen. Dean sits on the couch while Cas fills their water glasses, the routine reminding him painfully of their several study sessions. Cas comes back in and sets the cups down, not hard in anger but in a controlled way, and that makes Dean hopeful. He looks up, and Cas’ face is similarly controlled and emotionless. The hope shrivels a little.
I stare on, until I see my revenge sitting on the couch opposite, twirling her hair.
But like, your friend Cas or your Friend Cas? Do I need to wear my interrogation jacket...
“Hey, everything isn't your responsibility. Getting me out of Purgatory wasn't your responsibility.?
“It’s not like that,” Dean says while Charlie blurts out, “I'm gay.”
, Baby thinks,
Just as I’m about to open the door, the shorter one grabs my arm. “Fine.”
Cas' mouth quirks at Dean's tone. "No. I mean, I've tried nicotine, but not in this form. There's not much of a culture for it here." He's silent, then takes another puff. "I think I like it."
After ten seconds, she broke the surface again, gasping for air, spitting water out of her mouth, and shaking her head like a dog trying to dry itself off.
“Do you know what animal is scared of heights?”
“Me and Ben can't be in this with you. I'm sorry.”
"Any time."
He had been celebrating Thanksgiving with his family as Dean had theorized. An affair for the whole extended family, it was always stressful, but it was important to his mother that he be there. The very early dinner had passed easily as Cas could sink into the background of chatter, seated as he was with his younger cousins. It was over dessert that things went south.
Silence falls. Dean looks constipated, and Cas looks caught off-guard.
Tuesday 5th September, 1978
I glance at my watch.
She looked out at the dark road, remembering a murmured conversation Dean had held with himself last week as Sam had slept cradled in her passenger seat. The words had been too soft to hear over her mechanisms, but it had seemed almost reverent. What she wouldn’t give to know exactly what Trench knew…
Cas looks back quizzically. “No. I'd rather focus on other aspects, wouldn't you?”
Dean shifts in his seat. That's the question he's been asking himself, too, on annoying repeat. He starts to say, “I don’t know—” but realizes that won’t cut it. He swallows. “I'm in the process of... unlearning a lot of things. Talking about us in public is still nerve-wracking, and I panicked.” All these honest expressions of emotion are exhausting, but he pushes through. “You make it sound so easy. It's
“I’ll do it,” she eventually said, before taking a gulping breath of air and diving down into the water, her feet kicking around where our knees were, propelling her further down.
Dean laughs a little at the caricature, then shakes his head.
My heart skips a beat as I sharply inhale. How could she know? I was so careful; we were so careful—
If you bend a kid, they will break, no matter how many times you swear that it is only making them more flexible.
No answer.
“I know what LSD is.”
The bong is passed back around, and thankfully Cas breaks the staring contest to hit it again. Dean looks at the glass contraption, his drunken brain thanking it—
, Trench said through drapery, offhandedly.
"Hey." I call out, as I slide open the glass door leading out to the back porch. Hannah jumps slightly, startled at my voice, and turns around. She's sitting on the porch steps, head resting in her hands, and elbows on her knees. She's wearing usual Hannah-Friday-night-clothes, with a cotton candy pink, silky dress, that pools around her thighs.
“I— yeah.”
It was a lie. We couldn't be safe by staying where we were. I believe that the suburbs are the most dangerous place of all.
"Me too. I mean, I think so, too."
With just her luck, Bruce seems to be right in the middle of some-such story tonight.
“Does it matter?” I shrug.
Chuck looks pale and not at all ready to hear this news. “I just don’t see how that could be possible.”
All You Need To Know About GRIDS
“What are you doing?” I plead, my voice raspy, my hands slick with sweat.
Baby had to smile, just a little, and that there was another victory.
The room is still in half-darkness, with only the light of the street lamps to illuminate it.
“A cardigan,” Benny supplies.
Trench doesn’t laugh, exactly, but their buttons glint.
"That's it, really." I shrug, putting my hands under my armpits to avoid the cold. "So if you're just doing all this to get a kick out of it, just stop."
“Yes, it was taxing to keep up.”
Meg nods to me. "Cas, you haven't done one."
Dean looks up, and says lightly, “Not anymore.”
“Cas! What’s going on?”
She’s leaning against the back wall of a building around the corner from where I was walking. Gabe is standing in front of her, arms crossed.
, Baby responded, keeping her cards close to her undercarriage.
“It’s cold, get in! I want to close the window!” Jo shivers from the backseat. Jo moved to New Jersey from Texas eight years ago and hasn’t ever gotten used to the cold, unlike the rest of us have.
, Baby sighed to herself. Like any other day, it had been a long one.
I watched.
“I want to make something out of myself. I want to have a life. What about you?”
After I step out of the car, I turn back to face her again, leaning in through the open window.
"Really?" frowns Jo.
Chuck shakes his head. “Um, I’m not sure what you guys are on, but if you want to come back later—”
Hannah and I trail off to our rooms, and despite the tension radiating from the entire house, I can’t help but keep grinning to myself in pride. The shitshow was successful.
“Then you should’ve provided sugar-free, filling snacks, poor Dean.” She flounces out of the room towards the vending machines and Dean smiles, shaking his head.
“We’re not fans, believe me.” Well, he can’t speak for Cas, but so far Dean is not a fan of this guy. “This is Castiel, your son.”
He says something lewd in response, and, well, maybe she didn’t misjudge. But she’s still happy that she can finally quiet that niggling voice in the back of her head; she knows now that Trench feels something too—they must—and it gives her a strange courage. She’s waffled for too long, and it’s the easy way out.
I carefully peel the comforter off of me, and clamber out of the bed, my feet landing on Dean's boots, which he at least had the decency to take off before getting into my bed. I stand up and quietly walk over to the closet to find something to wear for the day. I glance quickly at the digital clock on my desk, which reads 06:23. Another forty minutes until I'll have to start my day, so I take advantage of my extra time. I grab a pencil from a desk drawer, along with an empty notebook I'd bought simply because it was on sale. I couldn't help myself.
Claire smiles at the waitress, who comes over and takes her order of cheeseburger, rare. Sizzled flesh is still on her mind, so she figures she’ll shift to the opposite end and eat like a werewolf tonight, practically raw. Don’t forget the onion rings.
Cas nods and everyone packs out the door in various states of drunkness. Dean watches, amused, then follows Cas as the last one out.
Finally, finally, the boys stumbled back out, sans Cas, and Baby really didn’t know what to think. They got her back to Sioux Falls, Dean swearing the whole way and not saying much else.
Cas traces a circle over the engraving, then takes his hand back and continues talking as if nothing has happened. Dean curls his fingers into a fist around the lighter, letting it rest out of sight for the remainder of their break.
The sand lies between us and the ocean, the whole beach deserted, with teens favouring Boardwalk's nightlife to the sea in cold October. We're wandering down a wooden path, right on the edge of the town, where it’s emptier.
Baby wonders the same thing as she sees Cas wipe blood from his eye.
"Truth or dare?" offers Meg.
“Oh, hi! I'm Lydia!”
‘Biology,’ his grandmother Naomi purred from across the table. “On his way to med school.” The smile she had given him had made him distinctly claustrophobic, and lent him the courage to say, ‘Actually…’
“It won’t be an issue!” My mother stands up to place a hand on Hannah’s shoulder, “You’ll either get rid of it or marry Michael. Won’t you, petal?” Her voice is sickeningly sweet.
However, as I near my door, something seems off. There's sound coming from inside.
“I want to do something.”
“Hey!” she cried, returning the favor. All of a sudden it was a full on splash battle:  the biggest event of my life, the one that every kid had been preparing for since they could, well, splash.
"Let me tell you, this is who I really am! Captain America is my alter ego!" he starts, his distraction gone as Jo huffs and goes into the kitchen.
Benny looks unimpressed, but turns back to the dresser, then walks over to the closet.
"Need a light?"
Dean examines this version of Cas, one that’s even more closed off than he was when they first met. One that would be unreadable, if he didn’t know him so well. This version, too, he thinks. Yeah, this version is good too. If he’ll have me.
Noise from the apartment bell interrupts Dean’s stewing.
Chuck looks around uncomfortably. “Um, how’s school?”
“And you?” I ask, tempting fate.
“You can't save everyone, my friend, though you try."
I look around, to see that no one has drunk anything, except for Gabe, who's taken a swig of his beer.
After making sure that he has Dean's attention, he continues. "I realize that... while I detest this class, I need to pass it. And that's hard to do when you can't focus on the professor for very long..."
"Why did daddy hit you?"
Dean frowns. “Yeah, his mom found out. They sent him to military school.”
He disappears, too, leaving me and Meg alone.
“So, I don’t know how much you could hear, but Charlie found your dad.” He pulls up the new email, showing it to Cas. “Port Townsend, I guess?”
"So you say an action, whether you've done it or not, and if you have done it, you drink and then explain yourself, and if you haven't, you don't drink and make fun of those who have. Hint: the most sober person is usually the most boring."
“Jo?” I ask hopefully.
I salute him in thanks, before climbing the stairs, and find myself opening Dean's bedroom door. Dean's room suits his personality. The decorations clinging to the walls are a mishmash of movie posters, newspaper articles, and photos, mostly of us. I also spot a few topless girls stuck up near his wardrobe, but I divert my attention to the half-naked freckled teenager at the mirror.
Trench spoke slowly, and oh, they must be tired.
When it’s over, and we’ve stopped breathing heavily, I slump back against the door of the stall, my legs all of a sudden exhausted.
“It's just that the Winchesters aren’t badasses, they’re like Sourpatch Kids, nothing but gooey fluff on the inside.”
Charlie, though he mainly sees her in study group, has become a good friend since he’s moved to Washington; probably his best friend. Maybe his only friend now, Dean scoffs in his head. Or, well, there’s always Benny, and Kevin.
“Sounds good.” Ash christens the game, sets a few rules, and they’re off.
“I heard Rowena was practically the fun aunt. Not that I’m all warm and fuzzy about witchcraft, but sounds like she could’ve been entertaining to meet.”
Lydia smiles at Dean, flushed with winning, and starts dealing. He can see Cas glaring in the corner of his eye, but he doesn’t look over.
They’re on a roll.
I slumped down into the faux leather bench, tilting my head back and pressing it against the yellow cinderblock wall behind me. I squeezed my nose, as blood oozed out of it, the metallic taste sliding into my mouth.
And then— no longer.
Cas stands up abruptly, announces that he's going for a walk, and clumps off into the trees.
Adam flung himself off of the pile, skinny limbs flailing through the air.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned and my life is spiraling out of control. But with Dean’s arm reaching around me gingerly, I decide that some things are simply out of my control. Some things are destined to happen, whether or not you planned for them.
“Hm? Oh, yeah, sounds cool.”
After that, bringing Dean and Cas back home, Trench and Baby just listened.
"What?" Dean pauses, half-turned, and looks back over.
It’s been two weeks since they started dating, and nothing has really changed. They still relax around each other, sometimes awkwardly bumping knees, sometimes fitting perfectly onto Dean’s couch. They still study with their friends, host movie nights, go to occasional and stupid parties. They joke, Cas in his stoic way, one eyebrow giving him away, Dean laughing unabashedly. They still flirt, in person and now over text as well, or through Snapchat (Dean receives way more pictures of plant specimens than he can reasonably be expected to look at).
“I think I’m in love with you,” he says, and oh.
"Have you... got a boner?" Dean asks hesitantly, still holding me down, not moving.
The first round goes fast. Dean’s in it to win it, so he folds his crap hand and takes a drink. Cas and Megan also fold after the flop, take their respective punishments, and it’s just Lydia and Ash who play on. Lydia ends up winning, and Ash takes off his socks, to the protests of those present. Not very remarkable.
Baby pulled up at the police station before Trench had even made a dent in the latest news, from the celestial to the mundane details that Baby appreciated. Each time Castiel reentered the car and Baby moved forward on the path to Raphael, Trench chipped away: Cas’ brainwashing; Dean and Cas, throwing out the rules and ripping up Chuck’s ending; the way Dean looked with the angel’s hand over his mouth; Castiel, using a cellphone; Jimmy and his love for his daughter; Dean handing over the amulet even after being dressed down by Cas; Castiel carving protection into the boys’ ribs.
“Oh, sorry,” he says hesitantly, running his hands through his hair.
“Welcome.” Dean drifts over the couch, Cas into the kitchen. “I figured,” he says over the sound of the tap, “we could do some flash cards and then work on whatever other classes we need to, since there’s not much this week for advanced genomics.” Dean relaxes into the sound of his deep voice, hardly paying attention to the words.
"What do we do?" I asked her, begging my big sister to fix the problem, just like she always did.
“Hey, Kevin, you’re late to the party,” Dean says as Charlie digs out her computer.
"Okay, share your stories," Meg says, turning to Gabe first.
“So how’s Andrea?” Dean asks as they eat.
“My dad’s,” Dean says, by way of explanation. “John.”
Yep, that was all.
, Trench replied simply.
“So just eat shit!” Jo lets out, breathing deeply. Silence punctuates her rant as Meg does nothing to retaliate. We all just stand and stare at each other, wondering what’s supposed to happen next.
He finally breathes out, as much a sigh as an exhalation of smoke, and looks back over at Cas who is staring at him. The man's eyes move up from his lips to his eyes, and though his expression is the same, Dean senses that the mood has shifted. Maybe not so unaffected as he assumed.
“This is Dean. Dean— Megan, Lydia, Ash.”
Dean's eye flick to his face, then back to his hand. What the hell. He takes it as casually as he can and puts it to his lips. The smoke burns, but he’s drunk enough that he can relax into it.
Another night, another party.
“I’ve got some cards somewhere around here, I think…” He rummages in the shelves under the TV. “Here.”
