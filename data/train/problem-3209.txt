He just gets glimpses of a tangle of emotions. Rushed nerves and building panic. Struggle to complete something… frustration. Embarrassment? But Dean can feel underneath, concern that cuts back strong. Fear that has been built upon for a long time. Longing.
“No, Dad, what is it?” Dean asks. This is an argument old as time. All Dean and John seem to do now is argue.
Dean shakes his head harder, refusing to meet Cas' eye, "I should have told you. I shouldn't have let you marry me without telling you that it might be hard for us to adopt because of me."
But Cas is just… not a good fit for society. His magic is strong— no doubt— but anxious. It's unpredictable. Little outbursts of nerves from his childhood have left him embarrassed and afraid of hurting others. He remembers how it would sound like a balloon popping whenever he got stressed over a potion in school. He recalls how things seemed to sprout at his feet for comfort whenever he was trying to face his social anxiety— in the line at the store, talking to new people, on the school bus.
Dean walks into work feeling better than normal. He's tired, but things are better with Cas, and he's well fed and he thinks today is going to be productive as hell.
Dean thinks about how things seem to be collapsing all around him. He misses little things more than he ever thought he would.
It was the first extended period of time that Dean and Cas were left alone in the bunker together. Since their fight, they had slowly and unspokenly begun to work back to normal.
Jack is so sweet. He's got the same blue eyes as his sister, but his are bright with curiosity and a little clueless. Dean and Cas can tell that Claire has done a good job of keeping her brother out of harm's way. He is interested in hearing about Castiel's time in Italy, telling Cas that he had to do a bunch of research on culture there for a school project. Castiel tells him about the things he had seen, and Jack lights up with the realization that he had researched the exact same monuments.
He strips their bed in their room, tossing the old sheets and some of their clothes from the floor into the hamper. Cas notices that Dean has been wearing Cas' clothes more than his own. Castiel thinks this is a good sign.
"Lookin' back Cas? Fucked up. What kind of dad says that shit? Even if he was raised to think that way?"
Dean was powerful. The fact that he was able to interact with intention without a physical touch was impressive for being a child. Often it took practice.
Love you? That didn’t make any sense. No-- last time Cas had tried those words Dean had basically told him to get out. Dean didn’t, couldn’t mean love in the way that Castiel wanted love with Dean, he had made that abundantly clear.
Dean fell asleep to the Beach Boys while Castiel was in the local Target shopping for some new clothes. When Cas came out to the Impala, Dean was snoring a little bit. Cas got into the passenger seat and watched the rise and fall of his chest with rapt attention, before he slammed the door just hard enough that the vibrations shook Dean awake.
Cas' smile widens and he presses a kiss to Dean's nose as he slicks a couple of fingers. Dean's legs are folded, feet on the bed with Cas lounging against him. Cas presses in slowly, wiggling and testing the give. It's been maybe 24 hours since Dean has been fucked?
"Ok yeah," Dean says finally, "that has crossed my mind. I think that kind of hazy place you go after sex seems really amazing, but I don't know if I can let the walls down enough to get myself there. I'm too— I dunno— wound up."
Cas continues, "You needed support, your partner, especially when things went downhill, and I wasn't around. And I am sorry. Fourteen weeks was a lot to ask. I am so lucky that you even considered it
The thing about taking on Dean Winchester's emotional suffering was that it wasn't so much as the magnitude, but the contents that caused Castiel pain.
Dean expects Cas to take the necklace and put it on himself instead, but Cas tosses it gently behind Dean onto his cot.
His mind catches something weird. He almost drifts right over it, because it’s far enough in the woods that it’s sort of out of his mind’s view. He senses a little bit of panic, so he reaches for it, pausing in his stride to try and figure out what he’s feeling.
“Well, at the same time, I chose to— well I— I decided to clear up some of the cloudiness in your head,” Cas spit it out.
Cas is embarrassed to think that his frequent masturbatory fantasy is what he imagines Dean’s soul would look like as Cas brings him to orgasm.
Castiel didn’t have to work hard to imagine Sam Winchester flipping between a leather-bound lore book and a worksheet of times-tables.
"You were so sweet, pulling back to stop me from choking, being so careful with me. Couldn't stand to see yourself the only one coming— you yanked me up and got us pressed together and practically bit down on my neck."
“In the fucking region, Dad, okay? I use magic, and yeah, it might be an advantage, but its who I am. You’re just fucking sour because your magic is weaker than a fucking grade-schooler's,” Dean finishes hotly.
In the woods on a rainy day, the clouds threatening from above, the trees quaking with it. The energy built in the air. The way the forest floor’s undergrowth and rotting foliage made vitality. How their neighbors, tucked in the next cabin over drifted quietly with different feelings and aims, lighting across Dean’s radar in the periphery. Dean could fasten himself to the weight of the world, the life of the forest, and tug it into him. He’d tug it into his heart and through his chest, leading it down through his feet and into the ground, pulling the power through himself in a way that was intoxicating. Rushing through his temples, his lungs, his groin, to the flats of his feet and releasing in a live wire.
Dean's hands are up Castiel's shirt. This was not an unusual situation before Castiel left. It strikes him as interesting, Dean seeking comfort in bare skin, in closeness, when he spoke so many times of keeping their distance yesterday.
Dean begins jacking him, quick and strong, fingers closing tight on the upstroke. Cas thrashes and wiggles. Dean holds his hips down with his thighs.
"Want you to know it's not okay for people to hurt you. For any reason. You should be allowed to feel safe. Cas and I want you and Jack to feel safe. No matter who you like."
Dean wondered how much of John’s passion really had to do with Sam, who had been born simply human, not a magical bone in his body. Sam was intelligent beyond belief, and deeply involved with their magical community anyways. He had even become a delivery boy for a small apothecary in town now that he was old enough to get a job. John claimed Sam was his reason for advocating, whenever he and Dean fought about it.
He reminds himself constantly that this is for his own mental stability. More often he finds himself remembering that this is for Castiel too. Dean will be better for everyone.
—Castiel had to walk himself back through that rush of feelings as he deciphered what of those were Dean's ideas, and which of them were just Castiel's. In the end, he had to hold himself back, sometimes physically bite his tongue, when he noticed Dean feeling this way.
Cas thought Dean was kind? And intelligent? Who the hell did Castiel have him confused with? Dean was a good for nothing womanizer with a GED, a give-them-hell attitude, and a death wish.
He raised a colony of bees, the honey purified in the full moonlight, and sold at his shop. He kept little things left by creatures— butterfly wings and bird feathers. The local ingredients made his spells more powerful, organic.
They're almost there. On their way to a crescendo. Dean's hands are wrapped around Castiel's thighs, holding his legs up and wide so he can dig his nails in tight.
"You— god, I missed you," Cas says, his voice full of something that Dean isn't quiet able to pin down.
So, when Dean's texts became briefer, when their calls became less frequent— When Dean spoke of new opportunities and friends, Cas assumed what was logical:
Dean chews his lip, thinking, "I still feel like I lied to you a lot here. I don't deserve you to be so forgiving to that."
It feels much like it did when Castiel’s magic brushed up against Dean from afar, except one hundred times more intense. The energy pushed through contact of their hands is enough for Dean to instantly even out all but a few of the sparking nerves in Castiel. Cas is able to see the situation more clearly the moment that his mind clears. As a knee jerk reaction, he takes the pure magic that Dean is feeding him and sends it back Dean’s way hesitantly.
Maybe he is overreacting— but on the other hand, maybe Dean has epically fucked up. He has no idea which this is.
"Did you ever submit some applications for the adoption stuff?" Cas asks, sounding light and curious.
Cas rubs his wet eyes against his shoulders and tries to even out his breathing. Once Dean is on him, he is put back together enough to pull Dean by his shoulders into a sloppy kiss that's wet with Cas' tears and saliva.
you! I thought your mother was lying when she told me you could only be reached at a landline, for gods' sake Cassie, it’s 2020, get an iPhone,” Balthazar rambles.
Dean tries to ground him, "Easy there. That's okay, Cas. There isn't a good way to practice this stuff."
Castiel's expression eases at seeing Dean's face calm and sated. Dean knows he probably looks tired and even more relaxed now.
Cas taps his dick against Dean's hole a couple of times, then gives a few little slides against his cheeks, where he's wet and soft.
They're staying with an old woman named Sheila Tate out on the west side. She's fostering them but doesn't want to have kids for long because she's already got three that are grown. She knows she can't help them financially if they want to pursue higher education and she can see how bright they both are.
Sam continued to look worried, eyeing Cas carefully, “You don’t deserve to hurt Cas. Neither does Dean.”
Cas was too caring, too in love with Dean to ever hurt him, to ever try something unless Dean asked for it explicitly. Cas wouldn't even go for the ease-in model. Consent was very important to him, after all, angels had always valued this.
“I am doing better,” Dean says earnestly, “And I told you, I’m seeing a therapist. Isn’t that good enough?”
It takes Dean a few episodes of Tiny House Nation and awkward small talk to end up in Castiel's lap again, but it happens eventually.
But Dean encourages Cas to press him into it, his back scraping against the wall, maybe scratching it up a little.
Dean looked like he was going to speak again before Cas stopped him, “I decided to take a similar measure with some of the things that I could see were troubling you, and I wanted you to understand—“
Dean has three job interviews. He gets two offers. He has to sit down and do the math for his now three offers. He compares benefits and salaries and commute times and time off. Cas and he discuss it. Dean can hardly believe he's wanted in one position, much less three. Two of them are salaried higher than SynCorp, and the last has such good family health benefits and retirement matching that the similar salary doesn't even phase him.
But Castiel honestly had known. He knew when Dean was hesitant to hold his hand in public at first. He knew when Dean flinched when shouted at, people pleased, and had to leave the scene whenever people started to throw punches. Hell, he knew there might be issues the minute Dean put a harsh
Cas makes his way to the kitchen, brow furrowing as he takes in the mess. That is unusual. Dean, believe it or not, is actually the tidier of the two of them. There are plates and cups in the sink, the kitchen table covered in mail and papers, Dean's MacBook resting closed on the table.
But lately, Dean had been doing so well. He had been fighting for the things he wanted, pushing for kids, and a home that suited a family. Dean had been working hard at a new job, and had been making connections with new clients, and coworkers.
Dean finds himself sniffling on the way to work. He takes a couple of decongestants and hopes its just allergies. He seriously cannot get sick.
Either something is wrong, or Cas has figured out he doesn't want to spend his nights in bed with Dean.
Dean is right— it's Cas. Cas is sat so his back is up against the wood post on the corner of Jack's soon to be bed, and he's got his head between his knees. He's breathing harshly, his body shuttering with exertion.
After a moment he whispers, "I just never want to hurt you. I never want to lose you. And I am afraid because of how much I liked that."
"Sam, let me heal that," Cas spoke to Sam instead of Dean, hoping that would alleviate the blow which healing often seemed to have on Dean's pride.
Castiel cannot help but feel more apprehensive now that this familiar has revealed himself in his human form. Bears, birds, toads, Castiel can handle. It’s other human beings that make Castiel start to second guess his every movement.
“Sorry,” Dean says, voice rough with whatever he’s feeling. He clears his throat, “I don’t want to let go of our connection, I like how it feels to channel your magic.”
Dean pushes himself up on his elbows and feels his head spin, but gets himself so he's facing Cas, "Cas what's wrong? What's going on?"
Hesitantly, he reaches for the receiver, like it could burn his hand upon contact. He yanks it up, cord letting off an impressive cloud of dust. Cas shoves the phone to his ear, waving wildly with his free hand to get the dust cloud away from his face.
Dean gets to the kitchen, feeling a little like he's going to puke. Or maybe pass out. He reaches for the cupboard to get a glass as he says, "I will, I promise, hang on."
In a few minutes, Dean will get up to refill Cas' stupid hydro flask with the bee stickers so they can both get in at least a few ounces of water before bed. He'll probably wash off a little too, and grab some wipes for Cas too. Dean didn't think tonight was rougher than usual, but he'll check with Cas again, and maybe take a peek just to make sure that his angel isn't down-playing some discomfort.
Dean could never forget that one. He had been in tears, head spinning from lack of air, choking around Cas' dick while Cas came down his throat and the only thing that Dean could think was how much he liked it. Dean swallows a little and nods to Cas again.
Cas looks a little surprised, excited, and a lot pleased, "spanking you? Slapping you?" He pushes it a little further.
"Dean, I would have never pushed you to explain anything about your past that you are uncomfortable with sharing with me. I understand that things were tough for you and Sam when you were younger," Cas tells him slowly.
Dean kisses back playfully, reaching up to grab at the bar like he's going to do a pull-up— except for the fact that Cas' got him.
After the movie, Dean complained that Sam picked a stupid movie and that it was a waste of two hours and “beer money”.
Dean stares at the message. It feels like this message isn't for him. This is for the Dean that Cas has made up in his head— the Dean that isn't a piece of shit. Dean clears the message.
He gets into work and sees that the rest of his team doesn't look much better than him. They all start their work begrudgingly, slowly shifting through what was, just yesterday, exciting new development.
"I wanted to get to talk to you though, and if now is the only time that works for you, then I guess I'd better take it!" Cas says.
Dean wordlessly shifts up so his weight is pressing him down into Cas' mouth. Cas uses both hands to hold Dean up and press forward, his stubble scratching deliciously. He licks and sucks into and around Dean's hole like it's what he's meant to be doing. He pauses to spit, slicking his hole with heat.
Dean shakes his head and makes to stand up. He feels Cas' hands try to catch him as he half stumbles out of the room and towards the kitchen. Cas follows him close behind.
“Maybe give him a little time, but be certain to show him you're still with him. And when he does come back, talk to him. Tell him the stuff that you normally feel like you wouldn’t,” Sam suggested.
But Dean is fucking sensitive under his arms, and when his arms are bared like that it makes him feel helpless to Cas in the best way.
Castiel stood and made a move towards him, “You promised! You promised you would listen,” He practically growled to Dean.
Dean even tested the waters, pushed back against Castiel for a moment, moving their magic towards the moonflowers that dotted the fence and giving them a little bit of love to spruce them up to the point that their blooms almost dripped with perfume. Castiel hadn’t even thought to give his moonflowers some affection— they always seemed to just bloom on their own.With a little attention though, they practically dripped with pollen, and Castiel had a feeling there would be more moths around for a while.
“No, I still live east of Siltcoos. It’s across the lake from Dune City. That’s kind of… that’s a long drive Balth,” Cas stutters.
In the brief glimpse that Cas gets, Dean's bare chest is slim and freckled. His shoulders curl forward as he nervously hikes the blankets up over them, putting his chest back down on Cas' so he can't get a good look. Castiel doesn't miss the way Dean is quivering. From exactly what, he does not know.
Its Saturday morning where Cas is and Friday night for Dean. Neither of them have anywhere to be, so Dean doesn't feel the slightest bit guilty when he lets out a little moan for Cas to hear.
Dean hears a soft noise coming from what they're assuming will be Jack's room. He follows the sound, worriedly thinking it sounds like someone in distress.
Cas giggles against his shoulder, his mouth wet and leaving spit on Dean's skin. Dean uses his lube-free hand to guide Cas' chin up for a kiss.
Dean knows from this that Cas' question was a serious one, "No you're ok. I just— I'm not used to talking about stuff like that so openly," Dean explains.
Jack's room is blue-gray with a fresh coat of paint. The bed has a striped gray IKEA quilt and the walls have four carefully organized frames with stock pictures. There is a bookcase that Cas has painted blue, and a little ocean themed night light that's plugged into the wall.
Dean licks them, blinks as their combined magic whispers through Castiel’s hair, glitters in his eyes and makes him look like a sacrifice that’s been anointed and left for Dean and Dean alone.
Dean realizes too late that, yeah, he's there. His mind isn't on straight. He feels like he's watching and feeling everything from somewhere outside of his body, and he can't even remember how he got there in the first place.
Cas finally calls two days later. Dean is just waking up on a Saturday. He picks up the phone with a:
Dean wipes at his face, frowning as he speaks, "I wasn't going to mess with your opportunity, Cas. I couldn't be responsible for that too," His voice is small.
Eventually, after a few measures of swaying, Cas lets go of one of Dean's hands and pushes with the other to twirl Dean in an awkwardly quick spin, which makes Dean laugh.
Things sort of fade out after that. It's too much, too much, but a good kind. Dean floats and Cas eases up on him, leaving Dean sobbing and just trying to hang on to consciousness.
“You knew? That I loved Dean?” Castiel asked, relaxing in his chair, even letting himself smile a little bit. Sam knew.
Castiel knows he’s strong— that’s the problem. His magic is skittish and powerful at the same time, a recipe for disaster.
His home was warm with fire and piled with books and bits and knickknacks. He wasn’t much for organization, letting his house become a cozy disheveled. His crystal shelves are layered in geode dust. He’s got unlabeled vials and jars fermenting about. He’s taken to hanging herbs to dry all over the place with twine and hemp rather than just on the drying beams.
He isn't going for anything too intensive. He's too emotionally raw for that, and he doesn't think Cas would even let them get as far as to fucking each other this morning.
Claire laughs, “Me too. He’s just excited. He likes that you guys have good sidewalks for riding bikes.”
When he looks down at Cas, his blue eyes are watching Dean with the same horny-glazed fascination that he always has when Dean does this.
"So, you'll have to connect with Lars, Kevin and Miriam. By the end of the day, if you wouldn't mind. You can give them this paperwork and send them to my office with any questions you can't answer yourself."
Dean leans back, makes space between them again. He gets space back as the song starts to fade from the radio.
Really, what was the worst that happened? Cas had known that his feelings for Dean Winchester went beyond his feelings for any other human being from the moment he laid eyes on him. Of course, he hadn’t equated these feelings for human love until much later. As an angel, Dean’s soul was the most intriguing thing he had ever encountered. Almost magnetic, and apparently only to Castiel. Other angels had frowned upon the obsession that Cas developed. In hindsight, Cas understood why Dean and Sam had been directly avoiding following the apocalypse plan intended by God for humanity. That didn’t bode well for any of the heavenly hosts. After running from heaven however, and spending some time as a human, Castiel was almost embarrassed to recognize how much he loved Dean. He was blind to all other joys when Dean was in the room. He was careless with his actions, with his desires. There was something about being in proximity with the righteous man’s soul that made Castiel utterly weak in the knees. That was undoubtedly the reason that Cas was aching to clear up the muck too: there was really nothing like being able to bask in the light of Dean’s soul without anything between them.
Castiel is thrusting up against him to meet his downward strokes, and Dean knows that he needs to get the angle just right, work his hips in just the right slow-roll-snap that will make their skin slap together and have Castiel begging for him.
In hindsight, maybe not his best move. Claire instantly becomes defensive, brows furrowing, hiding behind her wild blonde hair, "What does it matter?"
It only takes about fifteen more thrusts before Cas comes. He’s watching Dean lose it, helpless, and he’s buried deep in him. Dean’s little whimpers have him whispering, “Good boy, good boy.” Cas’ vision whites out helplessly and he has to bite into Dean’s shoulder.
But Dean had begrudgingly let him go, let Cas go secure his career and calm his anxieties in another fucking country for fourteen weeks.
They both know Dean has a hard time letting go when the roles are reversed. It's helpful for Dean to watch Cas in this position— vulnerable and open, eyes bleary, and gone on the endorphins. Maybe someday Dean will feel more comfortable with being in the same position.
Dean turns his head, his jaw set, and his eyes wet with tears. He looks guilty and ashamed and afraid all at once.
Cas breathes into Dean's ear, sending shivers, "Yeah baby, that's it. Give it to me, Dean. Come for me."
He has to take a deep breath. It’s overwhelming— is this what it’s like to work with a familiar? Is this what it’s like to use magic without fear of it being erratic?
"I'll take that as a yes," Dean gasps, using his hand to pull Cas' jaw left so they can resume kissing.
Cas is content and comfortable, now more back to himself, but still a little hazy with all of the good shit that just went down. His mouth tastes like sweet come and sweat, so he licks his lips and cuddles into Dean's chest.
Dean sets his chin on Castiel's chest, eyeing him. He settles his hips down so they're flush with Cas', Dean resting in-between Cas' spread thighs.
Claire makes a little uncertain noise, "Are you and Cas really going to adopt us? Jack, but me too?" Her voice is so tiny.
Cas seems to remember Dean's dick at the same time Dean does, because he pulls his fingers out, then uses both hands to take Dean's thighs and spread them.
“It’s not a problem Dean, and you're not fine. I know that, you know that. You haven’t been fine since Dad fucking handed you a shotgun and left you as bait when you were eleven. Hell maybe before that. I haven’t been fine either,” Sam said, finally getting frustrated as well.
Sam sighs, "Just. Tired. Removed and sometimes a little under the weather. I remember a couple times when Dad was gone for a long time and we were low on money Dean would get pretty sick and out of it."
"I love when you do that— the feeling of it. And I think that you would love it too— perhaps more than I do."
Dean walks home from the train with his shirt unbuttoned to his undershirt because it is so hot out. He considers stopping for takeout, but reminds himself that he's trying to watch his weight and he's got food at home. Thank god its Friday.
After their scene last Friday, he and Cas have gotten far raunchier in bed. Once he had taken account of everywhere Dean was sore and checked in with him way too many times, Cas had relaxed. As a result, Dean's head is clearer than it's been in
Cas spent the next few days with pneumonia-like symptoms, coughing, chills shuttering through him, and sharp pains in his chest. He could tell he had a fever because he desperately wanted to get out of his button up. He cooped himself up in his bed and tried to meditate in order to start getting through some of Dean’s emotions more quickly.
"Tying you up," Cas breathes out, watching Dean's face nervously for his reaction, "holding you down."
"Uh, yeah. Like he felt like it was his fault that we were broke and Dad was gone, even though I'm sure he knows that's not true."
“She told me that she understood how afraid I was, and that it still wasn’t enough to scare her away. She reminded me that she has been hunting on her own forever, Cas. She’s grown up with the same uncertainties I have, she gets it,” Sam said.
“Fuck you Sam. I-I’m not, okay? I’m not just relying on Cas, I swear,” Dean says, “I’m talking to a therapist now too.”
Dean was twitchy and energetic during breakfast, hurrying with things to do before work. Cas gives him a long wet kiss as he runs out the door.
Sam’s expression melts out of frustration and into concern, “Dean, I thought you had gotten past this self-worth stuff. I thought you were doing better.”
While Sam, Eileen, and Cas went back to the motel, he was given the job to swing past Joey and Annabell’s home to let them know that they were safe from the Wraith. The door to their home swung open before he could even knock and Joey was inviting him in for a celebratory beer.
Sam flies in on a red-eye flight on a Thursday night. He insists on taking the train from the airport which Dean finds insane because it takes about an hour and twenty minutes and requires a couple of transfers. Sam always tells Dean that he likes to gather his thoughts on the EL. Dean makes Sam swear that he won’t transfer from Blue to Red at the Jackson tunnel. That shit is sketchy as hell.
“Probably,” Dean agrees, “At least Claire does. She’s old enough to kinda have a say in what’s going on.”
Dean gets his hand slick, then pours lube over their dicks too. Then he wraps his hand around the both of them together, squeezes gently once, and starts to jerk his hand.
Dean— doesn't know the answers to these questions. He's too tired to really think of fighting with Cas much more. He doesn't know where he would even go if Cas were to kick him out.
Cas had promised to get the stuff they need—watermelon and pasta salad and root beer and such. Apparently the ground beef had beef overlooked.
Dean is trying to keep on top of his meals and exercise and work. He has trouble sleeping a few nights in a row because its hot and he decided to leave the air conditioning off so he can open the windows.
He took a deep breath, "I had sex with a few guys. Mostly fucking them at first, but I was young, you know? It didn't seem like that big of a deal to try bottoming— hell a lot of girls I knew were into pegging anyways. Found out I liked it, and I started bottoming more and more."
Dean's mouth is wet and open against Cas' chest as he moans. He jerks his hips a bit erratically, knowing he's fucking into a puddle of Cas' come and lube.
"Been feeling much better since we scened. Clearer head, more focused. I haven't been so worried about us, either. I know you're not upset with me, and that makes me less nervous. I love you. Thank you for letting us do that..."
Dean's eyelashes flutter, lips parted as he fucks back onto his fingers, his only point of contact with Cas the hands in his hair.
Balthazar must hear the uncertainty in Cas’ voice, because his tone takes to more soothing with his next words, “I am sure it’s lovely, Castiel. That actually is what I was calling about. I am hoping to come to visit you.”
Cas decides to go over the scratches a few times for good measure, digging in deeper and deeper as he watches Dean respond to the feeling. Cas knows well that scratches walk the pain-pleasure border that Dean has flawlessly aligned.
They sleep in bags on foam camp pads with just two feet of space between them. A lot goes unsaid— a lot gets repeated.
“It's been ages since she’s been happy like this,” Joey said, settling across from Dean at the table in the other room.
Dean's sure that Castiel can see the hesitation in his face, the way that Dean begrudgingly is allowing Cas to start to move him to the rhythm of the music.
He double-checks that the lube he has isn't the one that he hates having in his mouth. Cas doesn't love the flavor of lube most of the time and he likes having access to wherever he wants to put his mouth. This brand is one of the few that doesn't bother him—but also is one they shouldn't use when they're using silicone toys.
"Yes, you're fine. That's why you tried to fuck yourself dry in a position that is emotionally compromising for you," Cas says sarcastically.
Dean considers this, face still gently leaned on Cas', "That's why I should be thinkin' about it though. You take care of me, I take care of you."
"I want you to know that I love you Dean, and I will never stand for anyone who wants to hurt you or make you feel less than the man you are."
"Things hit the fan. I applied to the adoption agencies and... and they told me they didn't think we'd be able to adopt because of my criminal record," Dean rushes out.
Cas' eyes catch the headboard and he wonders aloud, "Do you still have that old tie that you bought for the FBI get up somewhere around here?"
Dean has got his fingers just touching his dick lazily, so yeah. He hopes this is phone sex. He makes a noise of ascent.
Besides this, she seems to understand some of Dean's shitty movie references and compliments the Impala where it sits in the driveway. Dean loves her the moment he meets her— it’s a kinda like looking in a mirror.
Dean lets Cas take the pillow and position it below them. He lets a hand on his spine guide him to his knees. Dean looks up at Cas, hands on the floor and legs folded.
Dean is trembling a little bit, nervous and excited and Cas seems to understand, slowly massaging a hand on Dean's lower back.
Cas must decide it’s not earth shattering (it's really not), because he responds easily, "Good boy. Get some in your hands."
Dean can't respond other than to gasp out because he's still touching himself. He knows Cas knows, he can see Cas watching the screen greedily, watching Dean tremble and twitch.
His cauldron stand is close to his fireplace now so he can transfer fire from his house warming flame without ever needing to cross the house anymore (that… had been a fiery mistake to begin with.) He’s lived in his home for just shy of twenty years now.
Cas hums, then gets his hands down to the hem of Dean's hoodie and starts to ruck it up, "Can I take this off? You're burning up."
He keeps fisting his dick as he goes, a little out of it but knowing that he shouldn't stop unless Cas tells him to stop.
Dean has never been here before, but something about it feels as though it wouldn’t be hard to imagine calling it home. And it’s not only the gargoyles that are charmed— Dean can sense heavy enchantments on the whole place.
He wants to get back to their usual dynamic, of course. That's not even a question. He just feels strange with the idea of shifting back into a power dynamic that requires so much trust when Dean is feeling like he can't trust anything right now.
Cas is eyeing him a little funny through the camera, partly ticked, but mostly calculating. He can't decide what's
Cas, for whatever reason, loves the softness of Dean at the middle, the little jiggle of his thighs.
To Dean's credit, the last time he got up to get a washcloth after they fucked, Cas had been all teary-eyed and upset when he had gotten back and it had broken Dean's heart.
Then he leans forwards, drops Dean's ankle, arches his back in the sexiest of ways and sinks down so they're chest to chest— Dean's nose only an inch from Cas', their breath mingling.
“Well they wanna stick together, and we’ve got room. Besides, you know I hate babies,” Dean says with a grin.
"Woah, Dean, you're having a panic attack," Cas breathes, apparently wondering the same thing. He gets Dean down to the floor and untangled from the blankets in seconds, his hands maneuvering Dean so he's got his head down, and lots of space to breathe and settle.
Dean stops walking, getting her full attention. He reaches up to point at a scar that runs along his jaw across so it sits into his earlobe, "See this?"
The time came in a prayer from Sam. Cas was in a motel room in Fort Wayne, Indiana in an instant, racing heart relaxing as he heard Dean's full laugh.
Cas truly didn't think they would be unable to adopt due to something that happened years ago either— it was absurd. Cas wonders momentarily why Dean hasn't spoken to Sam about this. Sam would have been able to clarify in seconds that Dean would still be a contender. Agencies just say that shit to do their due diligence— to scare actual criminals away from adopting a kiddo when they don't have the right intentions.
Dean is nowhere to be seen. The room is a bit musty, as though no one has been in there in a few days.
Castiel registered that, no, Dean did not look well, his eyes red-rimmed and his regular jean / laced shoes combo had been replaced by faded joggers and the vulnerability of bare feet.
It only takes a couple of minutes more, Cas watches as Dean's body becomes fucked-out lazy, his arms relaxing and his tummy sprayed with come. Dean gets his hands free and lets his fingers slide through the mess, grabbing some up and sucking it off his fingers before offering some more to Cas.
Even after being naturally gifted, and a high achieving familiar, just like his mother, John seemed to care less.
Dean huffed at this and parked the Impala, taking notice that the car Sam and Eileen had returned to the bunker’s garage.
“I missed him, okay? It was hard to be home alone without him. And when I applied for the adoption stuff initially, they brought up the arrest thing.”
Cas acquiesces, getting off of Dean and helping him turn on his side. Cas slides in behind him without a second thought, tucking his face to the back of Dean's neck and planting a sweet little kiss.
Hi guys! Thank you for reading, this seriously took so much sweat and tears. I hope you liked it, that you are doing well. Let me know what you thought.
Cas wonders if maybe this is what Dean needs— to reconnect. Dean needs Cas to let them get a little rougher than normal.
Dean's chest swells and he sucks in surprised gasp like he hadn't been expecting those words. He should be— he's fucking married to Castiel. For whatever reason, both Dean and Castiel decide to let that one slide.
The sound of the doorbell breaks their standoff. Cas sits up slowly, pulling himself from the bed to run and get whatever food he's ordered for himself off the nearby Grub-hub suggestions.
Its him, in the mirror. Their bedroom has a giant Ikea mirror that Dean can see every detail of himself in. It's not often he looks at himself in this mirror naked— most of the time he changes in their walk-in closet. The bathroom has a half mirror mounted high, so Dean can see his face and upper chest.
Balthazar is a cousin from Great Britain who had gotten a posting in France quite a few years ago. He used to spend summers in Oregon with Castiel’s family when they were children but since leaving for France, Castiel had barely seen him. Balthazar always seems to take Castiel’s unusual magic in stride.
He had ended up in jail with no money to bail himself out, and a court date that kept getting put off. He called Sam and told him to be sure to pay the rent and buy groceries. To call Bobby if there was trouble but not to worry about him, and not to tell anyone where he was.
Dean frowned. He had to think about that one. He supposed he probably would have, if given the opportunity. Coming to Sam had been the right decision.
“When I took on Lucifer for Sam last year, I figured out that I could assume all of the thoughts and feelings and doubts in his head as my own.”
He was so certain that Cas was going to, at the very least, kick him out that he's not sure what to do now that he's been fed and cuddled and sent to shower.
However, without Sam there to talk it through with him, Cas felt rather uncertain about what to do next, and decidedly heartbroken about Dean.
Cas knew pretty quickly that he was gay and that he had no interest in people who were living life as though it didn't matter.
That morning they woke up wrapped together, Dean hot and hard against Cas' hip. Cas let his hips roll a few times to hear Dean's sleepy breathless moans. Then Cas left the bed to get them coffee, smiling at Dean's small groan of discontent.
They talk some. Nothing too groundbreaking. Cas reasserts his love and Dean makes a couple more attempts to apologize (which Cas tries to actively listen to, but always ends up rolling his eyes at).
Dean eyes him warily. He knows how tactile Cas is, so it hurts some that Dean can't just give him what he wants. Curling in Cas' arms right now sounds like exactly what Dean doesn't deserve, but he also wants it so badly it hurts. Dean waves his hands, no. He's not giving up that easy, "Not right now. I don't think you should want to."
Cas could remember countless nights after their first conversation, unable to quell the way his heart pounded at the thought of simply inviting a new person into their lives, of being unprepared for a human to care for. Cas needed to find an agency, an insurance plan, a color scheme for a child's bedroom. He needed to take a childcare class and—
Dean thinks, "I'll talk to the agent, but yeah, you should be able to. If you guys agree, you'd be moving in the next couple of days anyway. I'm sure Sheila told you that."
"Awesome, maybe we'll hear something soon! Seriously Dean, imagine. In maybe as short as a year, we could be actual parents," Cas sounds so excited.
Dean will forever wonder how something that sounds so much like porn dialogue can become poetry on his husband's lips.
With this thought Cas eases Dean's head back with his hands, guiding him back and pulling his hair gently. Dean sucks so his lips pull off with a wet-pop noise.
Dean's face is tingling. It's like Cas had grabbed him and pulled him to the surface of whatever he's drowning in, just for a moment, long enough to help him walk that pain-pleasure line, and then send him vaulting back into that hazy nothingness.
Cas locks eyes with Dean, keeping his gaze steady to gauge how it feels as he slides his fingers in pointed twists and strokes. Dean purposefully lets his face mirror how it feels, making it clear when Cas has found the right spots.
Eventually, he pulls Dean away from the wall and toward the bed. He enjoys the rough grind of spit slicked dicks, and then the feeling of Dean shoving him down to the bed and getting on his knees on the floor. Dean takes a long lick up Castiel's cock.
Because, no. Cas has never made Dean feel unloved. Cas has never had crazy expectations or been judgmental about Dean's past. Really— it's Dean who has decided Cas should be upset. Dean who has set the bar for himself higher than Cas would ever reasonably think to.
They make out on the couch a couple of times. It starts as gentle, reaffirming kisses and ends up with them pressed together, lazily kissing, eyes closed and hands touching and smoothing. Things are taken slowly.
Cas believes him. He hums in approval, making his way around the bed to take a look at Dean carefully, appraising.
"I think we need to talk about some of the things you mentioned last night. I am concerned about what's going on in your head," Cas begins, "I am also quite worried about your temperature though. I don't want our conversation to make you any less well than you already are."
Dean scoots down into Cas' cock, effectively taking him down without hesitation. Four fingers were really probably more than Dean needed. Cas huffs at the feeling of Dean taking control, his now free hand flying to Dean's hip to press it to the bed.
Cas asks him about his job, about the house, about the neighbors. Cas tells him about Italy, about new friends and a different pasta he had the other night.
Castiel's heart breaks a little. His husband is curled on their couch, sick as a dog and hadn't even mentioned it.
"I know. I wasn't here," Cas begins. He looks guilty and afraid, like he knew this was coming. Dean's brain has trouble understanding why he can't seem to find any anger.
“There’s rules though, okay? Once school starts I expect you to have it plugged in by a reasonable time. You can’t brag about it to Jack, either, I don’t want him to get jealous, but I think he’s still too young for a phone. I think we’ll make a rule that he’ll get one once he’s in middle school, but I just don’t think he needs—”
The thought just makes Dean put in an extra hour of work that evening. He goes for a run afterwards.
"Get yourself so close and—" Cas hisses as Dean starts to use his hand to make deliberate downwards strokes, "— and then stop yourself."
Dean doesn't think any more about what love makes him do. There's not enough time. The way things are now— it exposes his priorities.
The toughest part about these attacks is that Dean is always left dying to know what caused it. He wants to jump at the problem with claws and protect his husband. The catch is that Castiel is already so anxious thinking about it alone that it made him panic. If Dean pushes him to make it a conversation, Castiel could very well end up reversing right back into panic mode. Plus, after an attack, Cas is usually already panicking about having another one. There's no reason to add to the anxiety.
He could call Sam, but Sam would just call Castiel right away. Sam has seen Dean get like this one too many times, and would drag Castiel home with worrying words like "depressed". Hell, maybe that's what this is, but Dean can't help but feel as though he's still responsible for letting himself end up this way. Depression is when you feel sad over the things that aren't your own fucking fault.
Cas eats slowly. His appetite is pretty small, as peckish as he had been when he first had touched down.
Cas has got him there. Yeah. Cas should have probably discussed it with Dean when Dean wasn't moments away from the hardest orgasm of his entire life— and if Cas was having sex with anyone else, Dean would probably give him shit about it. But it's Dean, who has been slapped around by too many supernatural entities to count.
He scoops his hands around Cas' sweaty lower back and gently hefts him up the bed so that Cas' head is resting on one of their feather pillows. Dean climbs up between Cas' still twitching thighs and lets his weight slowly melt down onto Cas. He pins him down so he's warm and grounded and surrounded by the smell-feel of Dean's skin.
Cas is nodding as Dean admits his fear, his hands finding Dean's to squeeze. He tries to get his gaze level with Dean's, "That is absolutely valid."
Cas helps him through it, instructing him to breathe in and out with him, and squeezing his knee reassuringly.
"Dean I find you endlessly sexy. You make me want in ways I did not think angels could. I love you naked, I love you clothed— hell one time I got horny when I saw you in a winter parka," Cas says.
At the end of the day, Dean walks in, eyes bright and tie loose around his neck. Castiel, already home from work, watches him kick off his shoes from the couch where he is watching TV. He thinks how lucky he is that his husband comes home looking like
Cas chuckles and Dean looks back at him, where he is naked and holding the ties, eying Dean like he's some sort of offering.
"Not making sense?" Cas presses. It's actually comforting to know that this has happened before. That means that Dean has been through something like this and gotten back to normal. Maybe Cas can help.
He manages to get it out of Dean that therapy didn't go well. Dean can't seem to do anything other than cling to his husband once he gets his arms around his neck. Castiel doesn't seem to mind, he just slowly rubs Dean's back with big warm hands and enjoys the feeling of having Dean near.
He considers ubering to work, but he's not a little bitch, so he stands on a packed southbound red-line train and tries to forget that he's Dean Winchester.
“I just… I don’t want Cas to have to put up with the shit I haven’t dealt with myself. He deserves better than that. He always has. The fact that he is even able to think about taking on my shit when I’ve put him through so much… so much Sammy.”
Cas laughs now, setting his fork down, "No. They offered me the whole account if I can get it running. It would be three months, but potentially a double to my salary."
Dean is sinking down on Castiel's cock, on top of him, barely prepped. The hot drag around Cas' dick feels like heaven, but the wince in Dean's features... the way Dean is refusing to meet his eyes...
"I agree, but it came from above, I have no say in who they get rid of. I am simply hoping they don't let the two of us go."
Dean hesitates, "No. But I should have told you about the record. Either way," Dean still isn't looking at Cas.
Cas tries to glare at Dean, but he's too busy fucking up into Dean's hand, his arms flying up to grip Dean's shoulders.
Dean goes up, climbing up on Cas, all hot-skin and knees and elbows. Their dicks press together at the positioning, Dean's hands balancing on Cas' still clothes shoulders.
Castiel's hands are on Dean's hips, his fingernails digging in and giving Dean that pain-pleasure wires crossed sensation that he has been jerking off to since he was a teenager.
Dean's mouth hangs open at the thought of Cas' salary doubling. It is not as though Cas really needs it to— they're both comfortable.
Dean gasps in protest and struggles against Cas' grip. Cas settles so he is sitting on Dean's stomach, pinning him to the bed.
He checks Dean’s face for signs of discomfort as he eases in. Dean is wet and stretched, and the angle is quite good. Cas’ first thrust is easy and smooth, without any of the burn that Dean usually takes time to relish in. Castiel knows that this will likely disappoint Dean, but he also relishes in the way that Dean’s body just opens for him.
Dean can't help but feel his chest warm at this, "I know, Cas, I know. I want that I'm just— it's new and it makes me a little uncertain."
"I am frustrated," Cas agrees, watching as this statement makes Dean's face waver, "But I'm mostly frustrated that you'd think any of this would make me want you to leave."
Cas makes those delirious little moans and his hips are twitching because he can't handle keeping up with Dean's rhythm. So Dean gets up on the flat of his feet, almost on his toes so he can get enough leverage to fuck Cas into the bed with the weight of his body, hopefully plowing directly into the sweetest spot.
Dean is content to tap to the beat of the song and listen to Cas speak about some body-positive activist that he follows on Instagram (whatever the hell that is) until he surprises him with,
Claire mostly just looks happy at the fact that Jack is enjoying himself. She finishes her burger off at lunch almost as quickly as Dean does. As Castiel takes Jack to check out the weather exhibit that's ahead of them, Dean tries to talk to Claire.
"Words Cas. You have to use words," Dean says gruffly, nosing at the side of Cas' head to get him to speak.
The trouble was, Dean wasn't a stupid man. He was quick to notice a sudden change, and would not likely fail to notice something like what Cas had done for Sam. Using that magnitude of grace would take obvious concentration, and Dean would also likely notice a change in how he felt once the murkiness was cleared up from his soul.
Dean is slim-waisted, clean-shaven, and toned. In a tie and dress pants, eyes green and skin freckled. Cas' mouth waters.
So Castiel asked for a little cabin in the woods. He asked for spell work lessons from a private tutor, and Naomi had agreed, petting his hair softly. She set him up on a property far drive from any town, on a river, and in the depths of the woods. She paid for his lessons, visited weekly, and brought food that he couldn’t grow in his garden. She helped him with the spells he attempted until his knowledge of spell-work became even more advanced than she knew how.
Joey just nodded, “It’s incredible that she’s even out of bed. God… after her attempt last month, and Lauren’s death, I thought there was no way—” Joey had to stop talking, it looked like thinking about it was causing him pain.
It's a little different on the receiving end, Castiel can let give all of the ropes over to his body and let himself just move in time with Dean's hands and hips.
It's not just the fires, either. It's the hurricanes too, and the way it's so much colder already, in September. Dean's been through more apocalypses than the Bible— but it still hurts because this time, he has no idea what to do.
Dean sure as hell hadn't been rushing to tell Cas about how stupid he had been as a kid. He was already the one who went to community college and made less money. He felt like he was the less impressive of the two— Castiel was so smart and kind and talented, whereas Dean was kind of a shitty guy. From a bad background with no money or experience to his name. It was mostly with Cas' persuasion that Dean had pushed himself to apply at his current job too.
Dean has to consider this as well. He looks around at the coziness of Castiel’s cottage: the hanging herbs and crystals casting rainbows. The scent of lemon and basil from cleaning, the buzzing of energy off of every surface of the place carefully managed by their joint energies.
. He's a low-level employee, a liar, a criminal and therefore unfit to be a parent. He is a bad husband, a bad employee, and now he's fucking unemployed to prove it. This is simply the hammer on the nail that’s been positioned for so long over the mess that is Dean.
About twenty feet later, Dean stumbles on a small dirt path. It's small, but worn, as though it does get used occasionally. There are a few tracks, a set of tire treads from a car, a mark left by a bicycle, and a couple of sets of footprints in dried mud. Dean takes off down the path, hoping this will lead him to the source of the discontent ahead.
Dean lifts one of his legs to wrap it up around Cas' waist, effectively giving Cas the answer needs to hoist Dean up so he's straddling Cas, with Cas' hands supporting his ass.
Dean convinced Sam that the new Star Wars movie was worth seeing in theaters. Castiel sat in a foamy theater seat and accidentally touched Dean’s hand in the popcorn bucket like a teenage girl. Dean just passed the bucket to Cas and grabbed the hot tamales out of Sam’s hands instead.
Cas hums and leans down to kiss Dean's freckled shoulders. His hands find Dean's hips and press slow circles there. He comes up behind him so their thighs are touching, and Dean can tell that Cas is more than a little hard.
The lube makes it sound harder than it is, and it doesn't sting at all, but it was still obviously a slap. That makes Dean freeze up a little, but his dick twitches in Cas' hand, and he can't help but whimper.
Dean lifts his hands to rest on Cas's knees. Cas flips them palm up and clicks open the lube to put a generous amount in one.
Dean leans forward letting Cas make their dance become a slow one as he pulls Dean closer and puts his hands on Dean's waist. They sway together slow. Dean puts a hand on Cas' shoulder and sets his chin on it, hiding away to look over Cas' shoulder.
Eventually, Cas gets up to get coffee, and Dean grumbles and follows him into their kitchen. Dean makes eggs and toast and Cas rubs at his shoulders while he watches the pan.
He looks over his finances and decides he can't go back to school unless he can find something part-time too. He really would rather keep working than go back to paying too much for textbooks anyways.
Dean is hesitantly warm back. He meets Cas with all his I-miss-you's and I-love-you's, but he is never the first one to text.
“What do you mean?” Cas decided to play dumb, perhaps because he was scared to take the plunge, or because he wanted to give Dean an out.
that you made it an option for me. But Dean," Cas gives him a pointed look, "How am I supposed to know that you're hurting if you keep it from me?"
Dean sorta squints at this suggestion. What the hell does that mean? Dean has never been big on exercise, "I dunno Cas, I don't really want to."
Kansas was flat, and Cas was reminded of the time Dean said he could “see for miles!” The breeze was cool as it rolled through the windows, but the air was warm with sunshine. The snow had finally all melted, and spring was threatening to light up Lebanon again.
They end up hustling to have everything ready to go by 7 pm for dinner. Cas blames Dean's "beer breaks" with Sam and Gabe. Dean blames Cas' adamancy that they have an angel food cake that took an hour to whip egg whites for.
Castiel could tell that this was going poorly, and he wondered if he should have stopped earlier. The thing was, he didn’t think that Dean could handle it. That's why he was walking on eggshells like that. Cas decided he was in too deep at that point.
On the days when Claire doesn’t have to be in her class, they just hang out at home. They both have bikes, so they bike around the neighborhood and get icecream sometimes. They have mastered the art of Netflix and Cas set up Sam’s old shitty Wii for them to play Lego games.
Cas takes the huge blanket downstairs and sets it on their L-shaped couch. He plops down and fiddles with his phone, waiting for Dean to emerge. Cas can feel himself becoming anxious because he doesn't have a plan. Dean can't seem to listen to what Cas is saying. He's in it so deep that Castiel is struggling to help him see things clearly. Cas has no experience with helping through depressive episodes, and he's already jet-lagged and out of his width.
Dean sighs, “Fine. Told you mosta this stuff already though. I had to lay all those people off at my old job, and then Zach fired me, you know? I was just trying to find something else, so I wasn’t unemployed again when Cas got home.”
Dean frowns, thinking of the half-packed bag on the floor of their room and whispers, "I'm okay, Cas."
He stretches his arms out and rolls his shoulders, his eyes bright and bleary, his hair making him look the best type of fucked-out.
God. Things had gotten pretty bad. Cas can't believe he didn't notice sooner. Dean had been off— off like after a scene, off like after a hard day at work, or a reminder of something alike to his father. Cas can't believe he didn't figure out what was happening with Dean sooner.
He doesn't get a response. Dean kinda-really wants to make out with his husband right now, so he peeks around the main level for him.
“I know, we definitely have Dean. Believe me when I tell you I am lucky I had you through it all. But at some point, you've got to realize that you can’t shoulder it all yourself. You don't have to,” Sam pleaded with him.
Like Dean had thought before, there was no way he was going to get what he really wanted unless he asked Cas for it directly.
This alternative scared the hell out of Sam, even after the gentle pushes which Cas had been trying to give.
Cas suddenly is pitched back to a phone conversation he remembers vaguely where he had been encouraging Dean to get outside to exercise more. He remembers what Dean said earlier, about
They've talked through every lead that they had about finding Sam— they checked the spot they grabbed him, the last place he was seen, all the places they might have considered taking him.
Dean pulls away before Cas can deepen the kiss. He opens his eyes— not realizing he let them close. He stares as Cas slowly blinks back at him.
It’s Dean’s thirtieth birthday. He was awoken to Castiel’s lips trailing downwards at about 5 am, then again at 9 with coffee. They’d had Jack’s shitty pancakes for breakfast. Enough maple syrup can make anything edible.
Dean knows what Cas is talking about. Last year he took a week-long vacation up to see Uncle Bobby with Sam, and by the time he was home, Cas practically dragged him in the house to suck his dick in the front entry way.
Things get kinda mushy after that. Dean continues to jack himself to Cas' moans and praise and the wet sounds behind camera.
Sam plowed onwards,  “I really love Eileen. I could see myself doing research for hunts with her, but I could also, you know, see…” suddenly Sam’s face paled, “Oh shit.”
Dean is always gorgeous, his eyelashes splashing across his face and his summer freckles more prominent than during the cold winter months. His lips are pouty and sweet, especially as he sleeps.
Dean chokes a little, his eyes wet, "For theft, Cas. I stole a fucking computer. It was so stupid. I am so fucking stupid. I was seventeen. I spent a whole month in jail, and I was seventeen."
Claire will later quietly admit that she has only ever found other girls attractive, even when she was a little kid. She feels less nervous around Dean and Cas because she knows they have no qualms about who anyone loves.
I decided to rate this teen a long time ago when I first started it. There is not expect sex here, but it reads as very intimate, so if you feel the tags aren't mature enough, let me know! Enjoy!
Cas ends up with his lips wrapped around the tip of Dean's cock, his hands toying lower to play and tug in a way that's just shy of painful. Dean's boxers are pulled beneath his balls, the thick band of the fabric creating a delicious pressure. Dean shakes slightly under the attention, letting his thighs shift around Cas' face and his hands drift to thumb at Cas' cheeks.
"Good, that’s good," Cas says breathily. It’s been a while since either of them have had any sort of human interaction regarding sex. Five weeks, in fact.
That's actually very good to hear. Takes some pressure off. Dean can do this, and he knows he likes it.
He catches a whiff of the aftershave that Cas uses on the pillow that is Cas'. The damn scent doesn't leave, even when he washes the sheets every other week.
Dean had been in year two of community college when his four years younger little brother Sam had gotten a scholarship to Stanford and taken off for California. Sam simply refused to take more than a few hundred dollars for groceries from Dean, claiming he already had an on-campus job, so frankly, Dean had fewer expenses than normal. It sucked that he was paying rent for two when only he lived in the place than he and Sammy had been renting since Dean had become Sam's legal guardian.
Castiel freezes. The crystals he was carefully putting in place fall back to the ground, and the movement of his plants shutters to a halt. Castiel stops and gazes apprehensively at the person before him.
Their house is already too big for the two of them, they aren't even renting anymore. They go out to dinner whenever they want, and they spend frankly an alarming amount on sex toys. Dean knows money would be good, but... three months without Cas?
But his tone makes Dean get that guilty feeling in his chest, an inkling of the icky-ness that sometimes comes the day after they scene.
"It should," Cas agrees, "It’s always so much better after a while— like the time after your trip with Sam?"
He would not leave Dean. He could show Dean that he was in this for Dean. That Dean deserved people in his life who would not leave, who would offer him kindness and give him love unconditionally.
Can Dean really give in and take advantage of Castiel's kindness? Just... let Cas nurse him back to health and convince him things are okay? Is that fair to Cas? Is that even fair to Dean?
Dean feels some heat start to pool in his gut. He misses the way Cas tastes too. In more ways than one. His lips, his sweat, his come.
"I fucking lost my job. I can't even keep a stupid entry level job. I'm a shit husband, I can't keep it together to apply for adoption and now I don't even have a fucking job."
Castiel emerged into a quiet bunker. He sat at the War Table, in the second chair from left, the one next to Dean’s, the one he had come to consider his own. He opened a book titled Signals and Serifs - Getting the Spell Right the First Time. Cas had been surprised how much supernatural related lore books were continually published for the modern reader, but he supposed Sam had needed to go to Seattle’s occult bookstore’s website so he could order this one.
Suddenly Cas feels like his chest is going to collapse if he doesn’t get his body against Dean. Castiel loves physical affection. After months of being away from Dean, who usually gives it profusely, he feels touch-starved and achy for it.
Cas lets out a little whine, the leg that isn't wrapped around Dean falling open so Dean can sorta climb on top again.
Dean smiled against Cas, "I know Cas. And I, y'know. Feel the same way about you. I just haven't talked about it like it was
Cas hurried to tell him, “Everything is alright, I promise. I just want to be certain that there is no miscommunication.”
Zach takes a deep breath, but nods, "You've got a week left. Finish up whatever you can and get project stuff in order. I'm going to call the rest of your team in here in a moment. Sorry I made you do that last time, I couldn't bring myself to."
"Heya Cas," Dean noticed him, blinking in happy surprise. His eyes sparkled with post-hunt adrenaline, something akin to the rolling high of good fortune, or the look Dean often got when he was driving his Impala on a fresh stretch of road.
Jack admits one night when he bounces off to his room that it’s his “safe place”, and Dean has to pretend that the comment doesn’t make his eyes get watery
"Maybe," Dean grumbles. He's pretty tired and out of it, but he's horny and Cas isn't there and he just wants to get off and crash to sleep.
John groans, “It’s not that, Dean, I just think Benny’s is going to be one of the last of it’s kind because of the human activists. Magic just isn’t fair.”
Cas had to wipe away a tear, “Sam, I believe the bunker has the facilities to house another roommate.”
Dean keeps his knees up around Cas, effectively forcing him to stay close to Dean. Cas gets those big rough hands under Dean's shirt and slides them up over Dean's sides, peeling the cotton t-shirt with them.
Sam knew that Cas loved Dean, and hell, Sam had probably figured out that Dean loved Cas back. Sam knew that they were both gay for one another and Sam didn’t give a fuck.
Cas was floored, he hadn’t expected concern out of Sam. He supposed that he had underestimated the trouble which the whole situation had caused. And he hadn’t thought of it as self-harm either. He knew how torn up he had felt to find out that Dean had hurt himself, even if it was just punching a mirror out of anger or getting himself roughed up in a fight. It was less the thought that Dean was physically hurt, even, and more so that Dean was in a mental place where he was not bothered to cause himself pain. It did not sit well with him to think of how his loved ones would respond to learning that Cas had hurt himself, especially on purpose.
Dean is feeling better after that chat with Cas. It feels like Cas still really cares about him— like he'd drop something big to take care of Dean.
He's asleep on the couch in their small nook room, wrapped in two or three blankets, the topmost being the quilt his grandmother had made them for their wedding.
He gets out and runs again that afternoon. He's so jittery and excited about the future that he doesn't have much of an appetite. He pushes himself to eat an orange once he's out of the shower, and texts Cas a few gooey messages about how excited he is.
“Ok,” Cas decides with a huff, pulling his hips back, scooting Dean up the wall and shoving back in.
Dean has to fight every urge he has to wrap Cas up and whisper sweet things until things are all back to normal.
"Fuck, you are so beautiful," Cas praises, scratching a little at Dean's bottom lip, "Get my dick out."
"Even if it was just the work stuff, I would come home if you needed me. You know that, right? I'd be there, unconditionally," Cas reminds him.
"None of that. Just because we didn't have sex yesterday doesn't mean you're not cumming today," Cas demands.
Dean cannot watch it for another second once he realizes the distress this brief exchange has caused Cas. His words cut off, panicking at the sight of his new friend so distraught.
"Well I know I want you to fuck me," Dean says eagerly, not wasting any time, "And you know I like to get roughed up a bit. Or held down."
Cas certainly knew that Dean was overqualified for that position as well. Zachariah had taken a liking to Dean instantly because Dean had seemed so excited at the prospect of the position— when in all honesty it was clear to both him and Castiel that Dean could fulfill a much more vigorous role without question. Cas hadn’t said anything to Dean though, because Dean had been so excited.
"But dad shows up, banging in the door because I left it unlocked. And here I am, riding this guy's dick like there's no tomorrow. Full frontal too, the motel beds faced the door at this place," Dean laughed a little at that.
After a moment Dean speaks, "I— I was having a tough time today. I shouldn't have pushed it with you in that way. I didn't even really plan to. I just started taking off your clothes and realized I wanted it to hurt."
It's been days. So many days that it's started to feel like acceptance. Acceptance that they're not going to find Sam, that he'll never see him again. Sammy's really gone— it's starting to get to the point that Dean should consider starting to mourn his brother.
Dean doesn’t seem to get the hint, reaching for Castiel’s energy in a way that Castiel cannot help but react too. It is intoxicating how much Dean wants him, how strongly he pulls. Castiel blushes, glancing at Dean quickly. He wonders if this is normal for a familiar.
Pretty quickly, Cas has his fingers gripping in Dean's hair. Dean is really going to town, hollowing his cheeks and bobbing his head like he is in a hurry. Encouraging Cas to choke him with it— something which they are usually more careful about. Cas isn't the one that gets off on Dean choking either, really. Dean kinda likes how it degrades him though, so sometimes Cas will allow it.
Dean can't help the way his cheeks flush, and he sucks the inside of his lip a little needily. His body responds to Cas' words without his permission.
"Nothing comes to mind though Cas?" Dean pushes again. Honestly, the idea of hearing the dirty shit in Cas' spank bank would make Dean's day. There's something about Cas dreaming about sex with Dean that makes a little zing go up Dean's spine.
“Yes, of course, all is fine,” Castiel replied hurriedly, “It’s just— complicated. I have been trying to decide how to approach Dean about—”
He hauls himself to the bathroom to piss. He ends up sitting on the floor, shorts down and head in hands. He cries because he's in pain, because he misses his husband, because his life as he knows it is simply over.
At home, he strips to boxers and wraps himself in the old quilt Cas' grandmother had given them for their wedding. It smells like Cas' parent's house.
Dean's heart flies into his throat and he clears it to try and lie as smoothly as he can, "Yeah, actually, I did. I've been meaning to follow up on those. I got computer generated responses, like 'thank you for showing interest', but I haven't really heard anything specific."
Cas slowly slides his cock up the wet heat between Dean's spread asscheeks, not letting himself enter Dean quite yet. Dean tries to shift back to indicate that he needs Cas in him immediately, but Cas just smacks his ass, almost at his thigh, and says, "Quit that."
He smiles at Dean, a hand reaching up to feel his forehead, "We should get you into bed baby. You're burning up."
Cas also knew Dean hated the idea of him going to Italy for this trip. It was unfair to Dean, that much was certain. They were freshly starting their careers and exploring new parts of their relationship, thinking of children— and here Cas wanted to walk away?
Cas wonders if he is allowed to bring it up. Is Dean ready for that? Is Dean able to consent to whether he's ready for that at this point? Is it fair to Dean that Castiel is dying to start again?
Dean nods against him and then admits, "Me too. I don't know if I would ever be able to give that up."
He scratches over Dean's ass with his full hand again, enjoying how it pinks up around the marks. He slides a gentle hand down to where Dean is hard against the fabric of their bedspread. He isn't surprised.
And the sky is darker now, too. It's red because the Southwest is on fire again. Dean can hear the news on their crackly radio when Cas plays it. California up in flames, heading up the coast. They can see the fucking haze the next morning all the way in Montana.
Cas crossed the room to sit across from Dean at the table. The move brought them much closer together, and while the proximity was at first uncomfortable, it settled quickly into a welcome change quickly for both of them. Dean unconsciously stretched out his legs so they rested between Castiel’s.
"Okay, yeah. I can do that. Let me know if you need anything. I'll keep checking in," Dean reassures.
Castiel's heart breaks. Fuck this stupid man and his stupid insecurities and his beautiful heart and his bright soul.
Cas hums, "One thing does. But I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I will admit that I was sort of asking to see if you had thought about it too."
He gets in the shower. Stands under the spray and doesn't do anything. Just stares at the water. He gets out after fifteen minutes without reaching for the shampoo or the soap.
With Dean effectively immobilized, Cas lets his hips punch forward. His dick is already pretty deep, so the movement just slaps their skin together and stuffs Dean fuller.
One bit of guilt that surrounded Dean drove Castiel almost to madness. The bit that was associated with Castiel himself. Guilt over Cas' decision to leave heaven. Guilt over all the times Dean had needed Cas to heal him. Guilt over his desires to touch Cas. Guilt over leaving Cas behind without saying goodbye, or kicking him out, or not saving him soon enough. Guilt over all the times Cas had died, and how Dean had never held him long enough when they were finally reunited into an I-thought-I-lost-you hug.
"How are you feeling?" Cas asks, one Thursday afternoon when Dean can't help but call Cas over and over again out of boredom.
Cas still did Dean’s extra dishes and picked his socks up off the floor. He made certain Dean was aware that Cas was still willing to help with the groceries. Dean had started fixing Cas’ coffee for him again in the mornings. That morning, Dean had even done the little, rhythmic knock on Cas’ door to rouse him from his meditation when breakfast was ready.
Castiel had forgotten that Dean is still holding gently on his wrist, his palm warm and inviting and sustaining the contact that makes it easier than ever for Dean to pick up how he’s feeling.
People go by quickly. So fast that he can't focus his eyes on any one of them for long enough for it to be significant. In his line of sight, he can't see the sky. He's in a concrete box, looking out of the glass at another towering slab of metal. There's a pigeon on the curb across the street. It's gray and beady-eyed.
Cas picks up his bag from luggage claim. He considers for the one-hundredth time whether he should call or text Dean.
Every fantasy was doused in Castiel’s endless strings of praise for Dean, and in his mind, Dean just took it. Let the words wash over him and let out little whimpers. In Castiel’s deepest desires, Dean knew what he was worth, knew how much he was loved.
Or, Cas would have said more if Dean hadn't met his lips for an openmouthed kiss, tongue wet and demanding in his mouth. They're quite good at this— kissing. Cas would go as far as to say that they have become experts. Cas knows that Dean likes him to bite against Dean's lips, to push their tongues so their teeth drag against them. Dean is aware of the way Cas shivers when Dean sucks a little on Castiel's tongue. Dean knows that Cas likes it so that his lips are slotted below Dean's.
But Castiel had never looked down on Dean, because frankly, Castiel's parents had paid for his undergraduate in completion, and helped with his graduate degree as well. It took until after they graduated for Cas to stop receiving financial help from his parents.
Dean wonders how Cas can stand to not hide his face when he cries. Dean knows that Dean is the weaker of the two of them, but he still cannot fathom how Cas can keep his face forward, challenging Dean as tears drip down his nose.
What bothers Cas most is how torn up Dean is. Cas has known for a long time that Dean has dealt occasionally with what seemed like depression. Dean has never called it as such, or mentioned anything along those lines, but it was clear he often struggled with it. Nothing to this extent, however.
When Castiel comes down, his body is relaxed. He sinks into the bed and gazes up at Dean like Dean hung the moon before pulling Dean down on top of him. Cas nuzzles his face into Dean's neck, his stubble making a nice scratch.
. If his dad had ever found out about the whole thing Dean would have been dead for sure. And he wasn't kidding, John probably actually would have beat him within an inch of his life.
It’s someone with magic. Dean is surprised that anyone would live or even be hiking around out here. Dean thought all the land out on this road was a national forest. That being said, in Oregon it’s so hard to tell what’s privately owned land and what’s government-owned forest that it could be that Dean has stumbled upon a home.
Dean scoffs at the worry in his Dad’s voice. As if John cares, “He’s fine dad. At least Benny is appreciative of all the cool opportunities there are for familiars around here— there aren’t very many locally-owned agencies like his left.”
They fill out papers. So many papers. They get the house checked by the agency and by a private contractor. They buy beds and desks.
They don't call— Sam has some event with Jess' yoga club that he agreed too, but he just hasn't heard from Dean in a while. Dean reassures him over text that things are good. He lies about working on filling out applications for a possible new position at SynCorp and taking a vacation day coming up.
Cas had never felt like someone had leveled with him— sure, he had loved before, but not like with Dean.
Dean backs away a step, crying openly now, "I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I know I should have stood my ground with Zachariah. I should have worked harder, taken on some extra shifts, seen it coming.
Castiel huffed and let out a little smile at that. He truly did love Sam as well, they had been basically brothers for years. Their mutual love for Dean helped them to understand each other more than they would care to admit. And all other people aside, Sam Winchester was a genuine and intelligent human being. Cas felt lucky that these were what Gabriel would call “his people”.
Dean always seemed so certain about how he felt and who he was. His quippy dialogue and stony exterior created the assumption that Dean had a clear understanding of the things he felt. Cas expected Dean to feel sadness over those he had lost. Guilt, yet acceptance over the things which he regretted. All humans felt that. Cas would be the first to claim that Dean had made mistakes, but the last to hold back on forgiving them.
Cas had always been the one to pick apart the details, while Dean watched him, his eyes big with emotion and hope that the two of them could help a kiddo that was suffering through the same things Dean had to overcome all by himself.
Dean's client never got back to him, so he sends follow up emails. They were able to get the data mostly back to the way it was, but now its glitching. Dean has looked the code over what feels like a million times and he has no idea what's wrong with it. He wonders if it’s one of the parts his team members provided, but he doesn't want to assume that it’s not his fault, so he continues combining through the lines.
But now it would come to bite him in the ass; how could Castiel still love him when he had been lying for so long?
"You'll call, right?" Dean asks, his post-sex haze and submissive vulnerability making it harder for him to have a filter.
"A clown Sammy! A clown. I swear to god, how many fucking clown cases are we going to get this year? It's like we're in some TV sitcom," Dean chortled.
Dean quivers. Cas runs his thumbnails up the arch of both of Dean's feet, punctuating in the sensitive middle with a dig of his thumb. He eyes how Dean's body reacts to this, remembering his promise to add a slight scratch. Cas gets his hands up to Dean's lower thighs, grips with big hands then pulls Dean so he is on his stomach on the bed.
He’s got a palm resting around Dean’s wrist, Dean’s hand doing the same to Cas’, his palm hot against Castiel’s pulse. It’s more contact that Castiel has felt for a long time.
"Understand me correctly Dean, I do not wish you to stop, and I never want to push you to do anything that will make you feel the slightest bit uncomfortable. But I do know that you often seek— vulnerability— during sex. Even when you are administering the direction, you are accidentally open with yourself. I can see you trying to keep it in, stop yourself, but you really don't need to."
Dean sits on the edge of hit cot and holds onto the amulet that Sam had given him all those years ago. He's thinking about what he would say to Sammy if he had a moment, if he had a chance.
He comes home with a couple of avocadoes that he picked up so they can have vegan burrito bowls for dinner (well vegan for Cas. Dean is putting cheese on his, damn it!). He's humming to himself as he unloads his bag in the kitchen.
When Cas has finished, Dean is sad and happy at the same time: missing the feeling but happy that the vulnerable moment is passing. He tucks his arms around Cas and hauls them up to chest to chest, using his foot to kick the sheet at the end of the bed up towards them. He wraps the sheet around their naked bodies to hide them from the rest of the world.
in advance. And, to top it all off, the blame sort of falls on Dean because he is the project manager.
They swim at night in Lake Michigan after Cas gets home from work. They go to farmers markets and buy fruit and veggies. Dean tries to show Claire how to cook. Jack sticks two green beans up his nose during dinner and Cas laughs so hard he falls out of his chair.
Cas breaks the kiss to fiddle with the cuffs and command Dean, "Check to see if your feet can touch."
Dean knows nervous magic when he sees it, and observing this man that desperately needs the anchor that a familiar could provide has Dean padding lightly into the garden towards him.
"I think he knew how hard it was when Sammy left but he didn't really know what to do. Sometimes I wonder if dad was giving me space because he thought it would be healthy, or if he just wanted to get the fuck away from me."
Cas flips Dean and gathers him to his chest, pulling the covers up to keep them warm. Sometimes, when Dean is coming down, he’ll get a little chilly.
"They know I'm gay. They like— hate it. Probably because they're in the closet themselves, but it's still stupid," Claire explains, watching her feet as they follow along behind Cas and Jack.
Dean's mind goes to the empty fridge. He thinks of that time he tried to shower and couldn't get his arms to move to get the soap.
you've been working so hard abroad and I've gone and fucked everything up. And even if we could get kids, without two adults with incomes
"Yeah, okay. Thanks Zach. Sorry," Dean stutters. He can tell he's not all the way there, he's getting lightheaded and he seriously needs to get out of this office right now.
Two months in, they stopped using the second bedroom, and simply stored extra shit in there. It was nice too because when Sam came to visit, he had somewhere to crash that wasn't a couch.
Dean sees Cas shift a little—actually they can’t. They’re in the process of getting Claire and Jack, so they need to be around Chicago for house checks, meetings, and weekly visits. Dean can tell Cas is uncertain whether he can share this with Sam yet.
Claire interrupts a FaceTime call with Sam and Jess and ends up hitting it off with both. Dean carefully asks if Claire would think it was cool to fly out to California to visit Sam and his partners. Claire practically loses it with excitement – “California? Hell yes!”
Cas had gasped, his dick softening with the pulse of fear and worry that Dean's appearance sent through him.
Cas is instantly careful, "Dean, only if you want to. And only if we talk about it first. I will never hurt you."
Dean has no control over the speed, the angle, any of it. He can’t do a thing about the way his dick only gets friction against their stomachs on every few thrusts. He cannot control how Cas sinks his teeth into Dean’s nipples. He can only sit there and whine.
He decides to get a bagel on the way to work. Lord knows he could use the extra calories right now. He's been feeling bad still, his chest heavy with a cough and waking from eight hours of sleep still just as tired. And he knows he's getting smaller than he intended.
Cas will sit outside the tent and keep watch. He'll listen to the radio or read one of the books from the Impala. He'll cook or spend time just sitting and thinking.
At first, the wave of guilt made Cas a little bit sickly glad. His heart celebrated to know that Dean did feel something about all the times he left Cas behind. Dean did feel ripped up and guilty, just like someone should when they threw a friend under the bus. To Castiel, this affirmed that Dean cared about him.
Dean rolled his eyes, "Ok, but that was normal shitty kid stuff. A little smack if I did something wrong, or a punch when he was pissed because I fucked up a hunt. Hell, a lot of the time I probably deserved it. I wasn't an easy kid Cas," Dean explained.
“Can you really blame him, Dean? Wouldn’t you have done the same if you knew you could?” Sam asked him.
Cas comes back to the bed with Dean's old fed tie, and one of his own blue ties from where he had stripped it off earlier.
He looks exhausted, but he's turned towards their bedroom door, like he's guarding, worried over Dean. Dean's chest feels warm with relief— Cas is here to stay.
Dean moves his arms a bit and finds that he can't move from the position easily. His arms and legs are essentially immobilized so he has to stay open to Cas like this. It's scary, but it's more sexy than it is scary.
Dean was stunned, “I’m fine, dude. Seriously, you guys do not need to be worried. I don’t know when this shit became such a big problem.” He huffed.
“Sam, I’m pretty sure there isn’t a therapist in Lebanon who deals with Supernatural shit,” Dean shot him a face.
“I— geez, sorry this is fucking awkward. I was hoping to ask your advice on something?” Dean sort of asked, sort of said, rubbing the back of his neck.
His manager reminds him that he doesn't need to be working through the tasks as quickly as he has been. She tells Dean his work has been exemplary so far and asks how he would feel about taking some online certification courses so he can be more hands on. It’s the first time Dean has ever been spoken to about not over-working himself by someone within a job.
Dean blows out a breath against his neck, huffing a bit of a laugh, "Yeah, that's why you've got your head in your hands, huh?"
"Just trying to be healthy, ok? Not everyone can love to hit the gym all the time. Wanted to keep myself fit, y'know?" Dean explains.
"Different shows available. I missed the good old American Netflix," Cas comments as Dean settles next to him.
Cas makes it to the spot where Dean got some of Cas' come smeared and Cas licks it up, even though it's bound to be cool and sticky now.
When he finally had room to think, to breathe, to rationally be aware of his situation, he was eager to find a moment to grasp at some of the sufferings that drifted around Dean.
Cas’ eyes widen a fraction as he realizes what Dean is finally figuring out. His lips part a little, letting out some air. It seems like he’s going to speak, but instead he just leans forward to press a soft kiss to Dean’s forehead.
"Yes Dean," This was the first time Castiel had said these words out loud to Dean, so he treaded lightly, "Your father made choices with how he raised you that are concurrent with emotional abuse. And obviously physically hurting a child is never ok."
“I think, perhaps, it would be less effective to just tell him. Maybe I will inform him of what I have done, and then try to quell some of his worries. I am afraid of, I don’t know… scaring him off,” Castiel confided.
And Dean has no idea if anyone is okay. They haven't heard from Jody or Bobby. They tried, in the beginning, to reach out to Bobby. The minute their phones connected the fucking demons were on them, at all angles, trying to get to the stupid amulet that Sam once gave Dean. The same one that apparently can lead them back to God.
“You are more than deserving of the things you allow yourself, and not half as permissive as you should be about doing things for yourself. You are not any more responsible for ANY of the things which have happened to me than I am for them myself, Dean, look at me,” Dean was trying to look out the driver's window, away and into the concrete retaining wall they parked next to.
"I wonder if Sam and Eileen are back from Vermont yet." Cas changes the subject, letting Dean know that their talk is done for now. Thank god (though Dean is also a bit disappointed).
Castiel has long since given up making their sex life something that has to be all prim and perfect. He falls apart on Dean every time he bottoms now— not just moaning and rolling his eyes back— but truly letting his body thrash, his hips jerk and his lips tremble.
They packed up and hit the road a few hours later, Sam and Eileen settling in the backseat and signing back and forth. Cas got in the car last and sat next to Dean in the passenger seat. He still seemed uneasy, but Dean decided it was a win that Cas even agreed to get in the car.
“So, Dean, how have you been doing?” Sam asks, the minute that Cas leaves the brothers alone while they are walking around downtown. Cas apparently couldn’t make it a minute without another cup of coffee.
Dean had cried into Cas' chest and whispered out strings of apologies as Cas pet his hair and tried to get him to sleep for the next half-hour.
Cas leans forward to lick— yes, lick— along Dean's lips before climbing up over Dean and shoving Dean's hips so he is on his back, with Cas perched over him like a cat.
Not that this information has come as a surprise to Cas. SynCorp's head company, NuroTech had been known for mismanagement of startups. They often took smaller tech companies with a good idea and an inspirational leader and poured in funds and company structure that didn't quite work. There were a few cases in the last two years of NuroTech startups going under because they had invested in areas that simply didn't fit the market. It truly wasn't Dean's fault— SynCorp just didn't have the demand in Chicago.
A bus goes by with an ad for the CW. Someone is riding a bike. There are people talking behind him in the restaurant.
That made Dean chuckle, “She is welcome here anytime, for however long. Seriously Sammy, surely you know that.”
Dean wasn’t looking at him. Castiel honestly didn't blame him. He was a little surprised when he heard Dean speak, “Cas— I don’t know if I can hear this.”
Cas is nodding immediately. Dean feels a little weird about showing things through video chat, but he assumes enough people have phone sex nowadays that it’s not a big deal. He's also feeling pretty uninhibited because of the liquor.
"Shh, sweetheart, I've gotcha," Dean tells him, trying to spread the warmth of his hands everywhere he can reach.
Dean gets up near him, gripping his forearms, "No, no Cas. I want to be here, I swear to you. I just—I'm not sure you'll want me to be after you hear."
"Yes sir. I'm sorry," Dean chews his bottom lip, looking like he feels worse than his tone inclines.
It wasn’t the disappointment that hurt the most either, it was the fact that Dean expected to be left behind.
Dean is too tired to try and read the situation. He just lets Cas finish up with taking care of him before scooting off of Cas and stretching out beside him.
"Yeah, kid. We are. Cas and I were gonna come up and ask if you wanted to come with us this weekend, actually," Dean says, voice strong and clear.
Dean turns around and looks at Claire, who is looking out the window at their little blue house. Her blonde hair is all over the place and she’s got a split lip from a game of soccer that she and Jack tried to play.
Cas is relaxed in the chair next to him, his feet still up in Dean’s lap from where he settled them as they had been finishing up the last of cleaning Cas’ cottage. Neither of them can give up contact totally at this point. They’re both too attached to each other at the moment, coming down from the magic use.
Cas brings his hands up to the bar and guides Dean's hands to the cuffs, his back still flat to the wall. This position is going to be perfect.
Cas forks up another bite of noodles and says, "Well, it’s a short-term position to work with a big warehouse client. They're trying to integrate their entry systems internationally."
A voice and another sharp slap to his ass snap Dean back into the coherent world. He moans and hums out in question.
Cas reminds himself that he knows everything about this man. Dean may seem distant, he may not be acting like himself, but Cas knows everything about him.
And so Cas began, “As I told you, Dean, I truly intended to take the troubles and try to give you some relief. I felt that it was the least I could do. It was mostly an easy process, I did want to respect your privacy as much as possible. I intended to keep myself impersonal and meditate the feelings away but,” Cas glanced at Dean, “I didn’t expect to have such a difficult time.”
Finances pooled, they had settled on the little blue place on West Sunnyside Avenue, with the ash tree out front sitting above the sidewalk, and the parking garage in the back for Dean's Impala. Luckily, they were about a twelve-minute walk from the elevated train, so Dean didn't have to brave the messy city streets with his darling car.
"You should take some of this NyQuil," Cas suggests, grabbing the package and pulling the little kid-safe bottle lid off, "When was the last time you had some?"
Dean's submissive-people-pleaser instincts kick in and he sits up to cross the room to get lube out of their closet.
“Yeah. He had sorta been lying to me. He did like this weird emotional vacuum shit, and I got all pissed that he had been fucking around in my head. You know how he dealt with your Lucifer hallucinations?”
"Yeah, Cas, I know. Thank you, I appreciate it, but I'm doing fine," Dean deflects. He can't let Cas know that things aren't going as planned.
Dean leans forwards too, tastes the sweet in their air, in their space. Feels the charge in their skin, in the heat between them. The magic as it grounds him from his toes to his knees, up through his hips to his chest where they press together, the heat and the slick of their lips as they meet, slowly, wet and soft and so sweet—
But now Dean is realizing that no one can quite understand him entirely— he is always shifting, feeling, and morphing through his life in a way that only he can perceive.
"I know you're going to be amazing because you're so attentive to the stuff that won't even matter to them. Look at where we're sitting. We've got a whole fucking room set up for each of them— you've plans for adventures until we can bring them home. Hell, you bought them goggles so we can all go swimming. Cas, they are going to
After four or five more strokes, wet and rough, Dean comes into his fist and onto his tummy, his head rushing and the spin of it making him pant. He chokes on his moans and the camera catches the image of come smeared on him, so he is sure Cas will be happy.
"No, you really didn't. You had a bad time with how you've been feeling, and things have been bad, but you haven't messed anything up," Cas tells him.
Cas rubs his fingers at the wings of Dean's shoulder blades a few times, before getting his nails hooked in his back and dragging down. The sensation makes Dean hiss, and Cas can see the white, some red, trail of nails as it follows down over his ass cheeks and down to his calves.
Sam looked so sad, “No Dean, that's not what I meant. But I do think you should listen when he tells you that you deserve to be happy. Deserve to be loved.”
They were mid-fuck, Dean prepped lose and careful with a copious amount of lube. Cas had Dean sitting up above him as he prepped him, their mouths connected in a dirty, tongue-heavy make out. Since they already had Cas on his back, it was easy to help Dean up to his knees and position Dean over Cas' cock.
“Oh, I almost forgot,” Dean reaches for the top drawer of the little white wooden desk in the corner of the room, pulling out a sleek box, “This is for you.”
," with that determined face. He knew Cas would be pissed, but it still feels like shit to hear the words from his lips. And that was the nice version: Cas is too kind to ever really come down on Dean.
But Cas has other ideas. He gets one hand in Dean's short hair and anchors it there, yanking a little while he uses his other hand to smack across Dean's ass again.
Dean makes it hard to pay attention as he leans down and licks over the head of Castiel's dick, his mouth wet with spit. Dean lets spit drip down, chasing it with his lips as he eases down Cas's dick.
Cas looks upset and gives Dean a sad smile, "I know. It’s a long time. But think of how much it would pay off. I mean, Dean. This means college funds."
"You are going to be so good at this, you know that? I have seen you be the most gracious and forgiving person I have ever met. I've seen you around kids and with teenagers occasionally. You do amazing. And I know this feels different, because they're yours now, but you are still going to be amazing."
He follows the magic as it gets stronger and stronger. The woods are even more beautiful as he gets away from the area where the trees have been pruned back for the road.
“He was always so ready to live a normal life. It sucks that he feels like he can’t have that anymore. Like all the fight is gone outta him,” Dean took a swig of his beer.
Dean's new job has been going very well. They are a non-profit agency that does work for other non-profits. He likes the fact that they have clients much as they did at his previous job. He likes the fact that they are working for a variety of different organizations that are trying to do good in different ways.
Cas doesn’t seem to think anything of this asking instead, “Where do you come from? Clearly you are familiar with the woods.”
Dean Winchester isn’t a particularly interesting man. He’s not more intelligent than your average person, nor is he well-travelled or exceptionally funny. He can be rude and abrasive, or overly confident. Sometimes he can be irrational.
Dean whines into the sheets, he has no fucking idea what Cas asked, he was so deep in his head that he wouldn't have noticed if Sam came in and started doing cartwheels.
have no idea how to parent. I've never been responsible for a child, much less a teenager," Cas' words are rushed. He's freaking out.
Cas stills his movements and turns around in Dean's arms, catching Dean's lips in the sweetest kiss.  He lets his hands wander to Dean's ass squeezing in question.
Cas’ heartfelt considerably lighter, why hadn’t he thought of doing this ages ago? Sam was right, Dean deserved the love that Castiel had to give, and Cas was not the only one who saw that.
Cas isn't even sure what exactly to do with this information— but he is certain that it makes his chest squeeze painfully. He bites a lip to stop a little noise of discontentment, leaning forward to wrap Dean in a brief hug.
"Dean?" Cas calls, his voice edged with worry as he takes the stairs two at a time up to their bedroom.
"Of course. I'm not sure we would have much time to ourselves anyways. My itinerary is pretty hefty," Cas says.
Cas finally starts to come back to himself and squirm when he can feel the come drying between their stomachs.
Cas must decide that its enough because he adjusts their leverage slightly, then deftly lines himself up and begins a slow slide in.
“There isn’t service out here. It’s an enchanted-d landline,” Castiel fumbles on his words. His nerves are making little sprouts come up around his toes, and Castiel takes a deep breath to get them to stop.
She actually apologizes to Dean and asks if he's alright at the end. She knows she is pushing his boundaries.
Dean nods without question. He reaches up, picking at the button on Cas' jeans and then easing down the zipper. Cas scoots so Dean can pull his jeans down to his knees. Dean doesn't go for Cas' boxers yet, leaning forward to nose at his cock. His lips part to mouth down at the base, where Cas is sure he smells of sweat. He's been wearing these boxers all day. Dean makes eye contact, holding it as he waits for Cas to correct Dean's behavior.
He knows he's being a little bit of a self-pitying asshole, that’s what Dad would say, hell that's what Sam has insinuated so many times. But Dean doesn't know what else to do. He's been fucking proactive, he's been healthy and applied to so many jobs. He's worked his ass off at work and been careful to keep Cas out of the loop.
Cas' hands make their way to Dean's shoulders, then ease down his back, feeling his muscles and warm skin. Cas scratches his nails down Dean's spine and feels Dean melt into him. Dean has always responded well to positive touch, particularly those that Cas will give when they are hidden away under the covers.
“Not really,” Cas said, and he prided himself in how decided he sounded. And he wasn't lying. He really did want this, Dean smiling and drinking beer and suggesting they go see a movie or make dinner, “Do you?”
She weasels the basics out of him. John was mostly absent, except for when he wasn't. And when John was around it was because he'd run out of money or places to stay. John Winchester was a depressed, alcohol dependent adult. He had held it together long enough for Dean to learn some life basics, before the loss of Mary Winchester had sent him spiraling.
“Hey, you do not need to let me anywhere near your space if you’re uncomfortable with it,” Dean reassures, squeezing Castiel’s hand gently.
Castiel felt angry that Dean hadn’t approached anyone to discuss it either. He worked through this anger with the realization that it made sense Dean felt this way. The number of times that Dean simply assumed he would be bait, the number of occurrences where Dean seemed impossibly unaware that his life was worth more than he thought— it made sense that Dean just allowed himself to drown in guilt without dragging it into conversation like his brother might. Castiel wondered whether maybe Sam was the more adjusted of the two, and snorted to think that the younger brother had been the more mature all along.
Cas sucks Dean's come off his fingertips without a single beat of hesitation, pressing their sticky chests together as the action has him hurtling to the edge. He comes, thrusting into Dean and growling out against his neck, teeth biting down a little.
Claire steps forwards into his hand, leaning into his arm like a weird sort of hug-comfort-thing that feels oddly on brand for Dean.
No matter how much Dean liked Zach, Cas didn't like the idea of Dean being his subordinate in any realm of the word.
Sam sighs, puppy eyes still shining, “It’ll be good enough when you start believing in how great you are.”
So for now, he had a haphazard patch of hearty pumpkins. Carrots and potatoes and an ever-creeping rivulet of mint. Bird baths which he filled daily with fresh water and a variety of charms and crystals throughout. The whole thing was manageable with little stone and gravel paths which Castiel spent long hours puttering around, making himself at home in his own energy.
“Cas, fuck, I had no idea that you actually had to go through that shit. I thought you just— I don’t know what I thought exactly, but not that.” Dean was upset. Cas could hear the doubts in Dean’s head now. He remembered how Dean regretted just leaving Cas there. How he ached to apologize, how he often thought back to the fear in Cas’ eyes just after Cas took on Lucifer’s hallucinations from Sam.
Dean and Cas get hitched— Becky and Chuck come, and Becky calls Dean her "Son", which makes Dean cry for a while.
Cas nods, his eyes sympathetic. It hurts Dean to know that in just a few minutes he'll be leaving this behind.
"I want you more than any child we could adopt. I want you whether you are making a billion-dollar salary or nothing. I want you when you're sick and when you're feeling unwell."
Zachariah's quiet acceptance had frustrated Cas. They had never worked together directly, but Cas was aware of Zach from word of mouth of other professionals. He was seemingly a nice guy, but there was something off in the way that he liked having total control over his subordinates.
Cas kisses his chest gently, like they've got all sorts of time, and this isn't one of their last days to see each-other for fourteen weeks. He lets his fingers touch and roam over Dean, feeling the way his skin rises and falls, the sturdiness of his muscles, and the slight squish of his stomach.
“Ah, I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable Cas. I hope you’re not uncomfortable,” Dean scratches the back of his neck nervously.
“It’s not about me? Like hell, it’s not about me. You can’t have one nice thing to say about my job, you just get all judgmental and hateful when I’m the best damn familiar they’ve got, the best one in the fucking region, you know that?"
He approaches Dean slowly, sinking down into the armchair across from him and trying to decide whether he should wake him up.
This is how Cas ends up in his front garden, barefoot in the moss and desperately concentrating on trying to get things sorted out. Concentrating so hard that he barely notices a new energy make its way into his sanctuary.
They have to take it easy for a while. Cas takes a well deserved week off work the next day, calling in to explain that he's going to need some time to adjust.
Castiel quickly leans down and kisses Dean, gentle and meaningful. It's a long kiss, and Cas can feel Dean sniffling through it.
The rushing feeling that connecting with Dean brings sort of becomes hazy when they push the magic out with more intent. Without the feedback loop of energy getting trapped, Castiel actually decides it doesn’t feel so dangerous.
Beyond the walls is a small cottage, smoke rising up from the back chimney, drifting with the wind. Two myrtle trees twist together above the home, the branches interlocked. The paneled roof curves with the doorways and windows of the cottage, a worn brown. The siding is a plaster material, seemingly over stone. The windows are stained glass, uneven blue and green.
Cas lays Dean down back, letting his whole-body rest on top of him with that delicious warm weight that Dean will never get over. Everything with Cas is so good because it's Cas.
Cas' eyebrows shoot up in surprise. It's odd that Dean is already so close to the edge, and that Dean is fucked out enough that he isn't able to just slow himself down
Dean can't help but melt into the way that it feels, his eyes feeling oddly heavy for how much sleep they had gotten.
Dean cannot breathe, he wasn't ready for this yet. He tries, gasping, and pushing the covers away to get himself some air. What the hell is going on?
Dean's words actually seem to surprise his therapist. Then again, Dean never brings his father up himself. They always start pleasantly and make the slow slide to the discussion of John.
It was one of the hardest months of Dean's life. He and Sam still try to avoid talking about it. Dean had been pretty fucked up after a month of anxiety, guilt, and legal proceedings. Sam had been upset and afraid. The two of them had spent a long time just sitting at the dinner table the night Dean had gotten home, just crying and unable to speak.
The radio is a bit fuzzy out here in Montana. Dean's got it just dialed so they reach a channel that plays music that isn't half bad sometimes. The song playing right now is rough and mellow, Dean can't help but lean into the music as it floats. He's always felt like he's right there with it when there's a rhythm.
Dean starts at the top, pushing over the head slowly to make that same, delicious sensation that he knows comes when you ease your cock through the first ring of muscle. Then he completes the thrust rough, sliding down Cas' length and back up to under the head quickly. Cas' hips jerk each time Dean pushes down over the head.
He rolls on his back and stares up at the ceiling feeling everything and absolutely nothing all at once. It's oddly crippling.
"That's okay. We're still gonna come up this weekend. If you guys wanted to, uh, pack some bags we could bring them back," Dean says.
He thinks about it the whole Uber home, wondering whether everything is about to change, whether Dean has been lying when he says "I love you" at the end of every text. Whether Dean is really Castiel's anymore.
It's Dean, who can barely ask for a kiss when he wants one. In all honesty, if Cas hadn't just done it, Dean probably would have never realized how hard he gets off when he gets slapped around.
“Not these ones really, to be honest. I live in town, I’ve been down the road closest to your place a million times, but never on foot so I’ve never felt your magic before. Shame,” Dean explains.
This thought softens Dean a little— he knows that Castiel is doing all of this for the both of them. For their happiness, for their
The cum starts to fly out of Castiel's dick, thick and wet and all the way up to his nipple on the left. His cock jerks against his stomach as Dean continues to work him through it. The cum easing the way for a hot slide.
"I just think you don't stand up for yourself to people who try to take advantage of you," Cas tells him.
"I'll text or call every day," Cas says, and it's pleading, so Dean knows there's still some guilt that Cas is harboring about the whole situation.
The water glass is empty, as is the small plastic cup of NyQuil. Dean is buried in the sheets, his face hidden.
Cas needs to hop in an Uber at 3 pm to make sure he makes it to the flight on time. He's pretty flustered with getting ready to go, so he isn't focused on Dean, which Dean understands.
When they were looking for a new place, Dean insisted that he had to help because they had separate finances, and it was ridiculous for Cas to pay for the whole place that they both were going to live in. Cas had listened, and the next week, he had proposed to Dean on the Chicago riverwalk. Cheesy, Dean will admit, but at least Cas didn't do it on a boat.
It helped that Dean had been relieved of some of the emotional pain, there was a new bounce in his step. He took fewer cases, slept longer hours and laughed harder, even when the jokes were B-side. Sam noticed and seemed to follow in suit, his grins lasting longer when he realized that Dean seemed... happier. Cas tried to help indirectly, sneaking his way into redirect Dean's thoughts with the knowledge of how he may be feeling.
Dean followed him as far as the bunker’s front staircase. Cas could hear Dean reasoning with Sam, and Sam responding in a flat voice, sounding utterly in-love, confused, and helpless. Cas supposed he could relate. Eventually, their voices lowered, and after about twenty minutes, Cas heard the door to the bunker swing shut.
They do talk about it. Cas explains that he feels like he doesn't know what he can do, and it makes him feel anxious. Dean explains that he feels the same way but wants Castiel to know that he's done everything Dean needed him to. They end up snuggled together, legs tangled and Dean's lips on Cas' neck.
Cas watches as Dean is starting to fall apart, and like the all-knowing, perfect angel boyfriend that he is, he gets one hand on Dean's dick and jerks him quickly with old lube. He gets some purchase with his knees and starts to fuck Dean even harder, snapping his hips at the end to smack against Dean's sore ass— and Dean is right there, just about to—
“That’s the problem, Sam,” Dean said, his voice watery, “I keep not listening, and now I don’t know how to fix it.”
He makes his way up the stairs to their bedroom and enters without pause. Dean is carefully arranged at the center of the bed, head down and invitingly nude.
Dean can't even get himself to think clearly about this— it’s like his mind has mentally blocked out the times when his Dad had gotten aggressive. Every time Dean approaches the memories, it feels like he's thinking about something he shouldn't be, so he just stops.
Cas is still doing something on his computer as he answers Dean, "Exercise is great for relieving extra energy and staying in shape. I've been trying to get up earlier lately to hit the gym in my complex."
Dean's spit slips from his lips, Cas watching with heated eyes. Dean hums around him in contentment, making Cas' hips jerk lazily, moaning.
Dean shrugs his shoulders tightly. It's basically a yes, "Told him it was his fucking job to be paying our rent, not mine."
This makes Dean feel much worse. He tells her as much and she gives him a soft, pitying look, "That's just how it works, Dean. Sometimes it has to get worse before it gets better."
“It is alright Dean. I think it was something I had to do. Especially after all the hurt I caused,” Cas said.
After spending most of his childhood scared shitless of child protective services and shitty foster parents and being split from Sam, Dean is ready.
Cas ends up possessively dressing Dean in his clothes before feeding Dean chicken Pad Thai with a fork. Then he tries to ease Dean’s muscles by massaging his back and cracking his spine. They end up in a shared shower, lingering under the hot water together as Dean comes down from his headspace, and Cas becomes reassured that Dean is safe and sated.
Cas was mostly trying to understand when he and Dean became a single unit in Sam’s head. He supposed that it makes sense, Sam knew the both of them better than anyone else.
Dean wonders why he didn't realize sooner, of course, Cas likes to have control— he spent so much time taking orders from God, and then taking orders from heaven, and then taking orders from mankind that of course. Having control over Dean, over someone he loves, feels more than a little exhilarating.
He gets home and feels all weird and depressed again. Has he really not been paying enough attention to his feelings about Dad? Fuck that, Dean cannot handle how weird he gets when he starts thinking about his father.
Dean frowns again, reaching out to pull himself into Cas' chest. Damn Cas for being all insecure in Dean's afterglow. Dean is supposed to be getting cuddled at the moment.
They didn't talk about it until the next morning. Dean woke up, eyes red-rimmed and puffy, but seeming lively with a good night's sleep.
Cas noses and then kisses and then licks and sucks at the taste and scent of Dean's fresh sweat and grime, probably salty in his mouth.
Cas liked that Dean didn’t know how to respond, so he pushed on, “I think we do not give ourselves enough credit for the good thing which we have going here. We have a normal life, as normal as we can get for being who we are with what we do. Sam would be foolish to look at trading it blindly. You and I are important to him.”
Dean knows he's compensating for his experience with John, but he can't seem to feel like it’s a bad thing. Cas has been nothing but supportive of them adopting older kids.
"I wish I could," Dean sighs, "But I've got to stay with SynCorp. I'm still so new, I doubt they'll let me have much time off."
It was just after they had started having penetrative sex. It had taken a long time for them to get comfortable with it, Dean especially. After years of random one night stands, Dean's experience with relationships with open communication was limited. They had moved slowly, giving them both time to feel out what had developed between them. But they had eventually gotten there, and Cas thought they were on the same page.
Things did not get less awkward. The case was shit too, and Dean could feel it wearing on everyone. The victim was a 44-year-old mother named Lauren, who was found with her brain sucked out of a giant hole in the back of her head. The whole thing was a textbook wraith, and Sam was sure to pack lots of silver.
Sam takes off Sunday evening, which is good because both Cas and Dean have to be up for work rather early on Monday morning.
Sam hummed, looking at Cas expectantly. Cas’ heart fluttered, was he going to tell Sam what he thought he knew? Was he truly ready to face the music?
Dean squeezes her quick before letting her go, "If it happens again, call me, okay? You shouldn't be all by yourself after bad stuff happens."
He helps strip Dean bare and assists Dean in yanking off his own boxers. Dean walks them back towards the wall, where Cas knows the brick is rough, and Dean has complained about it before.
Dean is still lying on top of Cas, his head to his chest, knees on either side of him as Cas starts to run his fingers around Dean's hole.
Dean's hand moves quicker on Cas' dick. He works further up it and twists some at the head now, just the way Cas likes it, where he's a little slicker and the head catches.
Jack is fascinated by the Transportation Gallery, pointing out the old planes and listening carefully as Castiel reads some of the captions on the signs.
"You like this too," Dean breathes. All other nerves aside, Dean really does love it when Cas feels good.
He makes his way to the family room and finds Cas under half of the coziest blanket in their home, perusing Netflix.
What right did Cas have? Who died and made Cas the sole interpreter of Dean’s emotions? Shouldn't Cas, after knowing Dean for YEARS, have realized that what he was doing was invasive and unthinkable?
Since Dean’s favorite food is burgers, and it is Dean’s conjecture that his own burgers are the best that he has ever tasted, Dean is on grill duty for the evening. Meaning he needs burgers for him and Cas, the kids
They're using a couple of fold out tables pushed together and lawn chairs. Claire and Cas had gotten bulb lights for the back patio. They cast light with the help of the fire pit that Sam had helped Jack had made a bonfire in.
Dean comes apart a little more. He's making little noises against the bed below, glad for something to bite into while Cas continues.
The hot press of skin, the proximity to Cas' eyes, the way he kisses Dean— it's exactly what Dean needs at the moment.
Dean wonders why this beautiful man is tucked away in the woods, so far away from everyone and everything.
So, Dean went to Walmart and fucking stole a computer. He had the guy get it out of the case, and then made a run for it.
Cas resumes his careful press of lips to where Dean has gotten himself already wet and loose. Castiel mouths, tongues, sucks. He mixes spit and lube, his face wet with the combination. He scrapes his teeth against the flesh, letting a finger make its way up to test the give of Dean.
They text a lot. Cas sends pictures of the Italian countryside from the train he takes to Bologna. He sends Dean quite a few food pictures, inquiring whether Dean knows how to make these dishes for them at home. He sends a selfie on a famous bridge and a story about miscommunication with an elderly woman.
Dean huffs out a laugh, "Believe me, Claire, I do get it. I'm not telling you that because I think it's not a reason people hurt others, I'm telling you that because it shouldn't be."
Dean knew that Cas truly had no qualms with the idea of children though. He had seen the search for adoption agencies on their home computer later that week, as well as searches for parenting handbooks.
being balanced with his weight on Cas. He still sometimes trembles, his gaze on the way his thighs jiggle.
"They are, Dean. I really do think things are much better now. I guess I was just as uncertain about where we stood as well. I assumed you would come to me, much as you have now."
His manager smiles and gives him a mini lecture on preventing work-place burnout and creating jobs that are fulfilling to the employee. She also tells him that she'll look into getting a parking pass for the Impala so Dean doesn't have to take the bus.
Dean wants to get siblings. Get them out of a bad spot and into a better home where they can go to a stable school and ask him stupid kid questions and argue with him without being afraid he'll hit them.
Dean's face is scrunched a little, his posture suddenly tighter, "You don't have to do that," he says softly.
Dean thought to himself. The cold feeling in Dean’s spine spiked icy as he put two and two together.
Cas has that proud after sex smirk and hair as he kisses up Dean's chest, and then noses his way into Dean's armpit, stopping there to breathe in deeply.
"Anyways, Dad wasn't happy. When he finished swearing out the other guy and tossing him in the street without his shirt, he got more upset with me. I mean, to his credit, leaving the motel door unlocked and unwarded? That was reckless. But he was more pissed about the fact that I was having sex with a dude," Dean said.
It's at this moment that Dean recognizes that they are more than well enough prepared for what's to come.
Castiel sighs, "Some. I can tell there's a lot going on— more than Dean is willing to share with me. I intend to respect that."
Kid be damned. Cas would take Dean Winchester over a child he had never met any day. Dean was the important thing in Castiel's life. Cas wondered if Dean felt the same. He knew how important the kid was to Dean. Cas would do anything to see Dean happy, even if it meant Cas out of the picture.
Then he tells Laura all of it. How he finally told Castiel something specific for the first time about his father. He explains Claire's bruises, his own yellowing bruises back in the day. The woman from his job, the way he desperately wished he could go back and speak up for himself and Sammy.
After a few days, Dean gets fucking tired of eating take-out and Cas' sub-par cooking ("No offense, Cas.") He announces he will be cooking dinner. He actually feels like he wants to do it— he is looking forward to doing something other than laying around: like he finally has energy again.
Cas is really close, Dean can tell. His body is stiff and jerky. Cas is huffing out breaths and letting short moans rumble from his chest.
Dean shakes his head, hiding his face so he can watch Cas with one eye, the other hidden in his pillow. They continue to maintain their gaze for a long time.
The feeling makes Dean's cock try to kick back up against his stomach and Dean can't help but grind it a little against Cas' hip. There's no way either of them are getting off again tonight, and they both know that. It still feels kind of nice to simply touch, even after the fact.
"C-can I come? Sir?" Dean asks. He's in the habit of asking early just in case. If he doesn't ask, he'll end up coming without permission and getting in trouble.
He shoots Sam a text to let him know that Dean is alright. Cas types "Therapists Chicago" into the search box.
Cas is too weak to deny anything. Dean presses him against the wall of the empty bunker as soon as they get indoors, easing off his trench coat. Dean's tongue is demanding in Castiel's mouth, but welcome.
Dean's hand that's providing some extra stability makes it up to Cas' thigh, trying to lift Cas up and into Dean's mouth. Cas makes a little groan, following Dean's suggestion and rocking his hips forward to chase the slick of Dean's lips. Dean relaxes further and lets Cas fuck into his mouth, hitting the delicious curve of his throat on the third or fourth thrust.
It’s easy for them to forget that there had been a period of time during Sam’s college career where Sam had come home to stay with Dean and Cas. It had been too expensive for him to live in Palo Alto in the summer because he would have to pay rent to live somewhere.
Cas pulls away and gets himself seated next to Dean on the couch, sharing Dean's space and snuggling into his side, his eyes on Dean as Dean cautiously meets his eyes.
Dean quickly changes into a hoodie and some sweats, unbothered to change his socks, which have been on for almost 72 hours straight. Dean catches sight of the bag he had started to pack. He thinks of moving it, hiding it from Cas. Maybe Cas won't see it, won't kick him out.
“I just felt like Cas wouldn’t want me around anymore—if he found out about all the shit that happened while he was gone.”
It wasn’t unusual for someone with magic and a familiar to marry one another and have children— just unusual for someone as powerful as his mother had been to indenture her services to someone with as little respect for magic as John Winchester had.
“For sure! This place is like a dream come true, Cas. All those charms on the gates, on the plants, I can tell you’ve worked hard on it. I’m trying to talk myself out of asking to see inside as we speak.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, and he meant it, “I know how hard it can be to watch your loved ones fight their battles in their head.”
Cas crosses the room and deposits the items on the bed, turning then to Dean to watch what he's doing.
Dean frowns, “You weren’t supposed to get me anything. I thought we agreed not to do gifts for birthdays.”
Cas gets a hand up on Dean's dick (finally) and starts to jack him slow with dry friction, quieting Dean's question into a moan.
“I can’t even believe it really happened,” Sam huffed out a laugh, “We just… put everything out there.”
Dean lets his hands slip to where the pudge he had always despised now has become the flat of his stomach. It feels wrong.
Jack has the door open, racing up the steps before Dean's even out of the car. Jack is bouncing with excitement, a too-big gray Jansport backpack on his shoulders with his important stuff that he refused to pack in a suitcase.
"Cas," Dean says more than asks, moving to plop down next to Cas so he's pressed to his side on the carpeted stairs.
“You don’t have to do that for me. You don’t even know me,” Castiel lies through his discomfort. Even if this familiar is genuinely kindhearted and eager doesn’t mean Castiel wouldn’t possibly hurt him.
Cas suddenly flips Dean over, rocking him so his back is flat against the bed, his wrists and ankles still tied tight so his legs are spread and his backside bared for Cas.
“Not even someone to help out on days like these? The garden looks fucking amazing now, I can’t believe what a little bit of magic did to the place. Not that it wasn’t gorgeous before,” Dean plows on.
He stands and hoists Dean up at the same time. Dean easily slides his legs around Cas, arms at his neck as Cas walks them across the room. Castiel knows Dean has something for being carried. His twitching dick proves it. Cas presses Dean's back to the wall just under the bar, keeping Dean's legs around his waist and meeting his lips for a kiss.
Eileen responded with a gesture that Cas supposed wasn't in the American Sign Language syntax, but would be understood by anyone, hearing or deaf.
Dean looks down to where he has his legs spread haphazardly. He's drunk enough that he's not too insecure about how he's laid out vulnerably.
And maybe, because Dean had been doing so much better mentally, Castiel decided to try to get this thing off his chest.
Dean's cock is dripping from where Castiel can see it. Cas can tell that with about a dozen rough thrusts would get him coming down Dean's throat. He doesn't want this yet, but he's also uncertain that Dean has himself prepped well enough.
Eventually, Cas drops to the floor, grabbing for their earlier pillow and settling at Dean's feet. He hikes Dean's left foot up while Dean yelps, putting Dean's foot up on his shoulder and tilting Dean's hips forward.
Cas feels Dean wince under his hands and that sets of a little alarm in Cas' head. He tries to back off, to put less pressure, but Dean draws him in closer like he wants it to hurt.
Dean eyes him warily, his protective instinct still aware that Cas is vulnerable in more ways than one right now. Cas settles to sit on Dean's hips, and slowly presses his lips along Dean's chest, licking frequently like he's trying different spots for their taste.
(My number one kink is Dean Winchester crying, and my number two is any of Team Free Will taking off their shoes in the bunker. )
"Pl-please. Can I stop?" Dean's request sounds a bit like he's begging, and his voice is watery with tears.
So when Eileen finally stabbed the damn Wraith in its slimy little chest, and Dean personally spit on the body before he burned it, he was in a very good mood.
His head hurt. He wondered vaguely if Sam was back to the bunker yet. He wondered if that was where Cas had gone.
Castiel nodded, keeping his eyes fixed on Dean as he continued to dry the cup he was holding. He left the silence open so Dean could elaborate.
Dean grips Castiel's hand himself, "And if that makes me weaker than I used to be, then I just don't really care."
"The problem is," Dean whispers, "I think if my dad was alive today, I still wouldn't be able to stand up to him."
Dean is slowly starting to feel like this is a very bad idea. Cas' fluster is making his stomach clench with anxiety and all he really wants is to pull Castiel back into bed and never let him leave.
Castiel nods like he understands and then says, "It's not all new, though. Remember a few weeks ago when I held you against the bed after we showered?"
Castiel is not a good fit for society. He’s quiet on the front, and awkward to talk to. He’s bookish and imaginative. He’s got anxiety pouring out of him, bobbing his leg and chewing at his fingernails. And he’s got a knack for magic.
Dean gets an email from his supervisor, Zachariah, who wants to have a meeting the next Friday. Dean responds immediately and agrees. Hopefully it’s a raise with all the shit Dean has had to fit lately. Things seem to be looking up.
It was just when Cas had finally relaxed into his seat, carelessly gazing at the curves that made up Dean’s face when Dean decided to drop a metaphorical bomb on him.
Castiel’s little home became an extension of his magic. The trees around the property grew large and a little unusually, twisting together above his home in a strange embrace. The stone walls that used to have decorative etching were reduced to piles and piles of moon blooming vines and the occasional gargoyle peaking his way out.
Cas makes his way over to Dean, noticing how he is a little tense. Cas trails a hand down to his stomach, feeling as Dean tightens his muscles there out of some insecurity. This touch is usually a good indicator of how Dean is doing—not that Cas will ever tell Dean this.
Cas heads down to start the coffee. Dean pulls a t-shirt on and they end up in the kitchen, Dean sitting at the island and chopping veggies for omelets while Cas keeps an eye on the first one on the stove.
“That’ll be okay, right? I only get this week off and I really want to come to see you,” Balthazar tries to convince him.
Talking is a loose word, Laura actually hasn’t gotten that much out of Dean, but it’s mostly true. And he isn’t just relying on Cas now.
Cas honestly doesn't get off on Dean riding his dick— and not for the reason you'd think. Sure, Cas loves to have Dean on top of him, and he adores Dean in any way which Dean will have him— but after the first time, Dean had rolled on top of Cas...
This is what he was left with: sadness and love, and next to nothing on the bright-ideas-list of what to do about it.
“How was work?” John grunts as Dean gets in the car. He’s eyeing Dean a bit oddly like he’s uncomfortable with the fact that Dean had just been a black bear. Dean thinks it's ridiculous every time his dad gets weird about it— his fucking wife is a black bear too, for gods’ sake.
To Cas’ credit, he honestly expected that conversation to blow up. He had now firmly established that he too, was a self-deprecating idiot, and had decided that that may be why he always expected the worst to come out of conversations like those. He found it humorous that his self-loathing seemed to have prepared him for it that time.
Dean was quick to join in, Cas figured he would be. No matter how angry Dean was with Cas, it was funny to see Sam so nervous. Sam started to unfreeze, a smile slowly spreading across his face until he too, was laughing.
"Felt so good to have you near me, after a long week. You were all warm and tired and pliant. Got you against the wall and went down until I was as far as I could go and just listened to those noises you made, god, Dean, the noises you make," Cas starts.
The agent questions Dean about the theft charges. He explains the situation to her, describes how he sat in jail and how he paid back the fines with interest. By the end of the conversation she seems unconcerned, asking about their plans for where the kids could enroll for school.
“You underestimate me, Dean,” Cas teases hesitantly, Dean can feel the little anxiety flickering from Cas at the thought that Dean won’t understand that he is attempting humor.
He's just... small. Dean Winchester, larger than life, glowing with ambition and care and humor is small and vulnerable right now. He isn't as filled out as he should be—definitely thinner than usual. He's sweaty and pale. His shoulders are turned in protectively and he's uncomfortable in his own skin.
But Dean is moaning, and giving Cas those sultry eyes—- and Cas gives in, fucking down Dean's throat without much consideration.
The world is falling apart around them too— they're running from demons, they always are. But they're running from every creepy-crawly now too. No motel room is safe, they're watching and waiting for Dean and Cas to show themselves.
Dean thinks about whipping up these incredible fish tacos that he had made a few times before Cas took off for Italy. He starts to get the fish defrosted while he instructs Cas to get the charger for his computer and find the recipe.
He sat in the stupid jail and thought about how he could have just gone to the fucking library for another month and saved up for a used computer off Facebook market place. He was stupid. So stupid. But to his credit, Dean had been 17.
Cas frowns, gulping as he looks at Dean and feeling as his magic jumps with his anxiety. Castiel does not want to hurt anyone. That’s why he moved away, distanced himself from ever having to encounter situations like this.
"What's got you drinking tonight sweetheart?" Cas asks, getting his cup of coffee in hand and walking with his phone.
Cas smiles at him and folds the blue one to go in his suitcase, "Besides, I would only want to spend time taking in the beauty of Italy if you can come with me."
"I had to basically treat him like a kid for a couple of days. Get him to eat and stuff. Remind him that he was being crazy, and it wasn't his fault, you know what I mean?" Sam explains.
The bear moves closer to Castiel, padding cautiously into his space. Cas watches the animal carefully, wondering how they even came across him this far away from anything else. The bear rises up to its hind legs, suddenly becoming a much more imposing form than it had been before.
Dean doesn't even go for lube or ask Cas' to get some fingers wet or anything, he just grabs Cas' hips and moves him up the bed. He positions himself up above Cas's cock on his knees and —
“I know, I don’t think I can either,” Dean agreed, picking up his already half-drunk beer, “I just wish that he was more open to taking things for himself.”
“That’s quite alright Dean. I’ve come to terms with it,” Cas placates, “How is your relationship with your family?”
Cas gets done two weeks early. It’s week twelve and he's back in Chicago, intent on surprising Dean at home. He wonders if maybe this is the wrong decision—  perhaps he should call and confront him about it, ask Dean if Dean is planning to leave.
John sighs, “You know there aren’t very many small owned businesses like Benny’s left because most of them are heavily regulated by the Human Services Administration.”
He caught Sam alone while he was doing push-ups, of all things. It looked like he had just finished his daily jog.
He has to pull the phone away from his face so Cas can't hear the way he is sucking in air. He coughs a few times, still feeling his raw throat and struggling to get in air.
Castiel didn’t come around until the next Tuesday when Sam called him for a case that he found in Ashland, Illinois.
Dean decides the only plan of action is to hang on. He'll have to clean his act up, tidy the house, and get some stuff packed up so he has an emergency bag when Cas gets back.
Dean huffs out a sigh as Cas pulls away into his own personal space, shutting down and causing a couple puffs of dust and sparks and leaves to puff about his energy nervously.
"I don't want them to treat you like shit. People are assholes to people at the bottom of the corporate ladder— especially in new start ups," Cas tries to explain.
"Unless you don't wanna know— I mean I get that too man, it's not like anyone wants to hear my stupid sob story, it's not even that big of a deal—" Dean said, a little anxiously.
“Unfortunately. Her mom had seasonal, but Anna really had a hard time with it. I always try to do as much as I can, but sometimes… I can’t even tell what’s really going on, much less figure out how to help her.”
It is this appointment that she informs him that she thinks that he's going to need to talk about John if he wants to feel better.
Dean likes that he feels excited to cook and eat again. He loves these fish tacos, and so does Castiel. Maybe this is the beginning of something that could resemble normal.
Dean takes a breath, "I like it when you dig your nails a little. Like that it burns afterward. And I like—" Dean cuts off as Cas resumes his torture.
Then he's on the elevator. Then he's on the train. Then he's on his street, in his kitchen, in his and Cas' bed.
Dean gets sicker. He's got a temperature and a cough. He's too weak to get off of the couch for long. He makes himself canned soup and drinks the warm ginger-ale in their pantry.
Dean will never claim that Sam only loves him out of convivence, or that the people who have shown him kindness did so only for their own gain. But the starkness of how Castiel has loved Dean, and been so vocal about it, had flipped Dean’s life up on end.
Later, Cas noticed Dean trying his best to reach what appears to be a tense spot on his shoulder blades. Cas tugs Dean so his back is available without hesitation. Cas presses two calloused thumbs into the spot Dean was failing to reach and Dean lets out a hiss.
Cas was probably worse off, his eyes glazed, just dark pupils with rings of bright blue. He’s sweated through his blue pajama set, and thus unbuttoned just the top two buttons, revealing tanned skin, dewy with sweat. Dean catches the sparks from Castiel’s hair out of his periphery as they work. They start to trail like fireworks as Castiel gets more comfortable, more drunk on their combination.
Castiel’s phone rings. The violence of the ring makes the handset rattle almost off the base. The motion sends up a puff of dust— his phone never rings.
Dean does a bit of work in the evening to try and get ready for Monday, and he notices their client hasn't responded to his email. This makes a little anxiety rise in his gut, but he forces himself to try and make it a tomorrow problem and cooks some salmon in olive oil.
“I sort of talked to Benny to see if it would be possible to get you away for a couple weeks in September… Sorry to go behind your back like that, I wanted it to be a surprise. And if you want to go a different week we can probably exchange the tickets, but I think Claire did find a certain tour that week that she wants to go to, and I know we want to be here for Pride, so I—”
Dean takes a deep breath, then tries to ease her nerves by saying, "Don't tell me Sheila did that," he jokes.
Dean hooks his hand on Cas' thigh just under his knee. He angles Cas' hips up so that he can get his hips just under— a little higher— there. Dean eases back and uses his other hand to scratch down Cas' left nipple harshly. He digs in his nail and then does his best to tease it with his thumb and forefinger, pulling a gentle moan from Cas.
Dean and Cas start having sex again. At first, not in the way that they had previously, but now at least they're doing the slow fucking thing instead of the slow (but hot) foreplay only. Cas is honestly nervous to push Dean further than he's ready for.
He gives Dean a minute to get undressed, thinking through what he plans to do in his head. The planning dynamic of this has always been part of what makes it so good for Cas. He follows steps and gives orders clearly and carefully, reorienting himself all the way.
Cas’ breath hitches a little at the thought of touching this strange man. To his alarm, it’s a strange mix of excitement and fear. Castiel is afraid of having someone so close, nervous to be meeting the first new person he has encountered in months. At the same time, he is embarrassed to admit that he finds this familiar— Dean — to be sweetly attractive.
Cas is right about the fact that Dean's position is insignificant too. Cas is in fucking Italy working on a crazy project and making bank and Dean can't even keep his team working well enough that the company deems them valuable.
Dean's eyes widen in realization that he Cas isn't even interested. His face scrunches with uncertainty.
Dean blushes a little, “Yeah. Cas thought it would be good for me to talk some stuff through with someone who does that stuff professionally.”
Cas tsks, something he's never done before in bed, "If you can still order me around, then clearly it's not."
Dean snorts, "A good place to feel like I'm being good? A good place to y'know, reaffirm that you want me? Always."
Naomi asked often if he had met any familiar’s day to day that seemed interested in him, commenting that perhaps the right person, the right channel to his magic would be able to help him control his energy a little bit better. Castiel rolled his eyes at her every time. No familiar wanted to linger on his magic, skittish, and confused as it was.
Hesitantly, Dean reaches forward and takes Castiel's hand with his own. Cas pulls him forward and up, his eyes never leaving Dean's. Their other set of hands find each other as Cas leads Dean to the small open space in the tent, just big enough that they have some wiggle room.
Dean wonders if he'll ever be able to get strung out like Cas does after sex. He's seen it happen to loads of women in his time, but it was never something on the table for him during those encounters. Sure, maybe for a moment when he was coming, or afterward for a minute while she was just being the little spoon, but it wasn't like this floaty echo-y feel-good thing that Cas has introduced him to. Hell, Dean didn't think it was something that guys were supposed to want until Cas became addicted to it, asking Dean to get him there.
They're sitting in the bunker's kitchen a few days later, Cas eating a bowl of fruitloops and drinking black coffee with two sugars. He's watching something called an Instagram live, and Dean is working on his fried egg and toast across from Cas at the table.
Dean is frozen for a minute, before he thaws some and seems to give in. He rolls forwards so they're finally—
“Yeah, I do, okay? I just felt like I was gonna bring him down. Like maybe he shouldn’t want me anymore.”
A little while later they start to get stuff put away into Claire and Jack’s respective rooms. Dean is helping Claire put up a couple of frames and as she finished putting away an absurd collection of socks.
"Yeah, okay," Dean says, eyes glued to the phone number at the end of the email, "I'll give the agent a call right now."
Sam shook his head in exasperation as Cas brought his hand to the edge of the wound and began to piece it back together. At the same time, he willed the faded spots of Dean's soul to let up a little— pushing an angelic dish-soap to cut the grease of it.
Dean wasn’t looking anymore, he was pulling the car off the highway, looking less and less certain about his choice to bring this conversation back to the front.
Dean hates the feeling of being sick, but he hates the idea of Cas not liking him more— he retches over the toilet three or four times before he can get his stomach to settle.
“What happened?” Dean asked, looking his brother up and down to be sure he was all in one piece. Dean must have decided that Sam looked well enough, because he continued forward to take his spot beside Castiel,
Castiel reminds himself that he intends to get his tongue up Dean's ass in mere minutes, so it won't matter much.
Dean feels a flare of guilt shoot through his stomach. Sam is right, of course. Cas is there for Dean in sickness and in health, but that doesn’t mean that Dean’s issues haven’t been affecting Cas. Dean thinks back to when he found Castiel on the stairs in the middle of the night.
He works extra hard to make sure he's pulling their weight and getting his team to perform more efficiently at their tasks. He feels bad for putting it on his coworkers, so he ends up doing some extra work at night at home to make sure things are getting done.
What it boiled down to, was two emotions that Castiel didn’t realize could mix together so flawlessly. The first was desperate sadness. Castiel was sad that Dean Winchester didn’t think he was deserving. He was sad that Dean naturally tucked all of these thoughts and feelings away. It hurt to think that had Dean voiced these feelings, Cas could have so easily quelled them. So quickly explained to Dean that he was so worth everything. It hurt Cas also to think that had Dean made the things he felt more apparent— had Castiel been well versed enough to read Dean’s body language, and understand the underlying meanings to his words, that Cas could have understood what was happening in Dean’s mind all along. That maybe Castiel himself could have avoided so much pain and hurt, and simply loved Dean in the way which he was designed to.
“Sam, I am afraid I haven’t been very… forthcoming with Dean. It hurts me, deeply, to understand that some of the guilt, the blame, revolves around disappointing me. I need to explain to him what he means to me,” Cas took a deep breath, trying to tell himself that it was going to be okay, that Sam would understand, “Sam, I— I love Dean.”
They’ve got something kinda lowkey planned for the evening, family coming over to have dinner out back. Sam, Jess, and Gabe are staying in an Airbnb somewhere in Lakeview. They’re intending to come over later, but got last minute tickets to a Cubs game for the morning. Dean isn’t upset—he likes the time with just his immediate family anyways.
“I’m at Portland International right now. I’m here for a conference, but I took a week so I could see Naomi and Carver. I just found out that you’re still not living at the house in Forest Grove,” Balthazar explains.
Dean thinks for a moment, "We texted the other day. Think the last time we called was a couple weeks ago."
But with Dean, it was, well— personal. Cas wasn't sure why he expected Dean to be rational, but for whatever reason, he anticipated well-adjusted emotions.
Dean and Cas get more adventurous in the bedroom, Cas sitting him down to talk about the fact that Dean likes to be smacked and pinched during sex, and how Cas thinks it could be really hot for the both of them if they explored BDSM.
Cas supposed he should come clean about all of it. It would be hypocritical for him to feel anger over Dean’s self-sacrifice when Cas himself has been wandering down this path of taking on other’s suffering as well.
Dean supposed Cas is right, and he wonders for a moment if it's normal that he's never had a mature conversation about his in-bed-preferences with another partner.
Dean almost cries out when Cas pulls out of him, and he does when Cas pulls away so he's no longer a warm presence against Dean's back.
Cas knew this was true. He and Sam had actually spoken about Dean's father before, and Sam was far more adjusted with his understanding that their father had been abusive. Sam had opened up to Cas about how Dean had been particularly affected because he was trying to ensure Sam's safety. Cas wondered to himself if Sam was aware of the more significant abuse that Dean had just told him occurred while Sam was away at college.
"I might actually be able to come home a couple of weeks early. Things are going really well," Cas says.
He does about twenty-five sit-ups before his head starts to spin— jeez, he must be doing worse than he thought.
It takes a moment for Dean's brain to get back online after that almost-orgasm so he can get back to Cas.
"What you should apologize for," Cas begins evenly, "is the fact that you think it's ok to use me to hurt yourself. That's unfair to me and to you."
"They're kids from Chicago that need somewhere to live. This agent thinks we would be a good fit," Dean says, his heart beating harsh in his chest.
Cas takes a seat across the tent on their cooler, watching Dean from across the room. The song has shifted into something that seems to roll into the tent, even through the tinny speakers. It's slower than the last song, and the man singing fades to the back with a weighted melody.
Some idiot in his project group forgot to save their data on Thursday, so everything they had prepared yesterday was lost to the files. Dean has to make a call on whether they should spend the time trying to recover the info, or just get to work on recreating it. Worse, some of the data from yesterday was directly derived from a conference call they had planned
It seemed to work, for Dean slid forward, peeling away from the towel Sam held slightly and offering a gaping wound to Cas' outstretched hand. Cas frowned, trying to act as though something was incorrect.
Cas looks up fearfully to where Dean's face is, but finds Dean's eyes looking back, dark and wide, lip bit. He realizes suddenly that the jerk of hips was less about getting away from the pain, and more about Dean grinding his dick into the mattress.
The second was love. Pure, unhindered adoration for this man. For all of the good which Dean possessed. Cas saw himself in all of Dean’s burning desire to do good. Castiel was floored by the selflessness contained in one human being, the way which Dean refused to take for himself, even when he was so deserving.
It feels a little bit nostalgic to see Sam sitting across from them at breakfast. It makes Dean think of that little rental apartment they had first lived in together, constantly stepping on each other’s toes.
It's a blessing that everyone seems distracted right now. They are able to go into a store and pick up some extra cans and such without anyone getting near to them. The shelves are still a little picked over— but things have gotten much better. People are expecting the spikes in sickness now.
Cas moans breathily, his fourth finger slipping into Dean to meet a third that has been working him open.
“I can understand why, Dean has never been great with talking about his feelings,” Sam agreed, “I think that’s a good idea Cas.”
"And you're allowed to, Cas! It was good for you, it was good for me, and that's all there is to it," Dean rattles out.
Cas grabs Dean's chin gently with his fingers and forces Dean to meet his eyes, "Dean Winchester. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that head of yours. Of course, I will call. And I will text. Daily. Just because I am going away for a few months does not change that I am your husband, and I adore you. Unconditional, remember?"
