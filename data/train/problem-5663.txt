“Was it true?” Tony asks into Steve’s chest. Steve ‘hmms’ “about wha-?” he mumbles, his voice blurry with sleep. Tony shifts uncomfortably, “about
Tony woke up slowly. He nuzzled into the soft warm skin beneath him, comfortably warm for the first time all day, and rubbed his eyes. Steve had one arm thrown over Tony’s shoulder, and the other resting softly at his nape. Tony stifled a small smile, gently pushing away from 250 pounds of gorgeous super soldier and slipping his feet into the fluffy red and gold shoes he had insisted on bringing along. Steve had sulked over them all the way to the cottage.
Tony made more and more excuses to himself for the things he wa doing, as he threw himself into building the Dyson Sphere. The semantics for his more powerful weapons swirling temptingly just at the edge of his vision. The urge to build them, to use them, almost as alluring as just giving in and taking a drink, the closer they got to another event. To Steve remembering.
The feeling of being trapped, and the all consuming terror; well,- it doesn't
Fickle thing.
He supposes it doesn't matter, as she doesn’t come back. It feels like another failure above a list of failures. Never mind that Steve had
Stark looked grim, A flash of frustration and dark rage flashed through his eyes, so fast, Steve was certain he’d imagined it. He wished he had had happier news to give Stark, well, he should’ve probably have thought of that before, and anyway, Steve was done lying to Tony. Any version of him.
Tony followed Happy in blind faith as he lugged him into the kitchen and pushed him inside a large storage cupboard, closing it after him and standing guard. Tony held his breath and waited, pretending that the dark quiet cupboard wasn’t scarier than anything that could be outside.
Tony gasped for breath a few minutes later, convinced Ty wouldn’t be able to find him again. He leaned against the wall, slowly edging down, throwing his head back in relief.
He admits defeat before re-routing to the nearest roadway motel. It's slightly better than the usual accommodations Steve favoured, but Steve doesn't want to risk riding his bike until he finds a cheaper place.
He checks out of the room.
with the heat. Steve’s hand over his cock is all there is in the world.
“We can,-” Tony offers, aborted. “We
‘I won’t let them hurt you again,’ he promises quietly. ‘I won’t let anyone hurt you.’ He feels like a child wanting to hold the moon in his hands. He doesn’t really care.

, lips pressed tightly together. His elbows bruised and raw against the concrete.
He pushed open a door, straight into a dead end. With a low whine, Tony flung around back to the door. Before his desperation could descend into full blown panic, a gentle hand grasped his elbow, and Tony would recognize that grip
And what a picture must they make? More than a thousand years younger than he was: squabbling and pretending he wasn’t smart enough to look right through to them.
The old Steve may have felt stupid and horrified at what he was doing. The new Steve is just glad for the company. He’s even more glad that it is Tony. He’s so happy his heart might burst.
She's warm, and she's soft and she wants to use Steve for some pleasure, she has no more care for him than he does for her. That would make him feel less guilty, if he'd felt guilty at all in the first place. Maybe the whole clinical lack of emotion and investment, care-only-going-so-far-as-to-achieve-goals thing would hurt, but the feeling of people using him is nothing new at this point. He's used to it. She gasps and twists and
Tony smiles. “You left me here, aching and
His phone rings, loud, with an obnoxiously happy tune that Steve was pretty sure he hadn't set. He gasps, and struggles to his feet. He runs a hand through his face, and fights for his breath.
Maybe he was going into some kind of delayed shock. Didn’t that happen, When people experienced terrible things?
Moreover, it had helped Steve make another important decision too. Steve knew he'd have done it all again, a million times over, even with all the pain and grief and loss, If only just for this beautiful amazing ridiculous man, he would one day (hope to) marry.
The idea of the Multi-Verse existing, where he'd become Captain America, went into the ice and woke up and became an Avenger, again, was a stretch. Even by his imagination.
said costumes.
He opened the door, and walked in throwing his luggage in one of the spacious rooms. He leaned by the large window, the cool sea breeze messing his hair up. He feels rather than sees Steve slide in next to him, he leans his head down on his elbows and Tony gently pats his hair. Steve takes his hand and tugs it close, placing a kiss on his knuckles.
Steve doesn’t see Tony for so long after, he loses count.
He looks back up. Thor looks satisfied with himself, and Tony has competitiveness issues a mile too wide. He has a score to settle.
“I know how this goes,” Stark said, bluntly interrupting Steve’s internal monologuing. Stark took a deep breath, “In my universe,” he begins haltingly. “In my universe, we fought the same war. We fought it to the bitter end, said and did things to each other, that we knew we could never come back from. We were as self-righteous as it got. We wouldn’t be stopped. Maybe in our darker moments we’d even admit that we
Once at the end, Natasha sat on the hardwood floor in thought.
It was nice sharing the warmth with Tony and just being there. Content and happy. Steve wanted to bask in this feeling forever as long as Tony was by his side. He wanted to do everything with Tony by his side. The man snuggled closer and was drawing near to sleep when the feeling was ruined.
“Do you know what you’re like when you’re drunk?” Tony didn’t expect that question, but it was he heard before.
Steve was left clueless. Something had happened, he just knew it, but Tony didn’t want to tell. And the blonde wasn’t going to push.
This would work, Tony thought. It had too because he had felt too perfectly fit with Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist. They were too perfectly fit when their lips connected. Their hands fit perfectly when held.
Comment for prompts or anything you want me to write next. Just the character and an idea and I’ll see if I can do it
“Okay.”
“Steve you know what I mean! I can’t hold a relationship because I’m me. I’m too much work and you deserve someone better who isn’t going to bring you down. I’m a disappointment, Steve! Im good for a one night stand and that’s it, then I leave. It just wouldn’t work out. I’m just-” Tony was panting. He had been knowing this since he was 20, but saying it out loud gave it a newfound anger he didn’t know he had. He felt some lonely tears fall down but those were full of rage and felt hot on his skin.
If he couldn’t comfort, then he will be right by his side for the aftermath.
“Hey, everything okay? Tony? Tony!” The brunette didn’t answer. He just looked at Steve’s face, making the blonde uncomfortable. The captain felt under great inspection but it gave him more time to study Tony. God the man looked like he has just been mugged or maybe he’d just killed someone.
All Tony had was Clint.
Tony was baffled.
But she joined him in eating a bowl of ice cream in the kitchen and parted ways.
But he was.
No, Steve didn’t have a driver’s license. He had never took a driver’s test in his life, not even in the 40’s. But Steve did have practice in weaseling out of some tickets he could tell you that. And Steve felt no shame about going over the speeding limit. You could ask all the New York cops. And now was a time he could work on his speeding.
Or maybe it was something deeper?
“I’m not what you want Steve, not deep down. I’m not right for you.”
But it was nice listening to him sing, as if a wall had been lifted and Tony was completely open. As if Tony has nothing to hide. That was even better. Thor didn’t like it that Tony couldn’t trust him but maybe if he earned it then they could become friends.
Anyone have any ideas of prongs for a new chapter?????? I’m running out, please help
“Oh, hey Cap what can I do for-?”
“Don’t even get me started, Nat. All they do is talk about their pet. The cat’s not on the damn date. I don’t want to hear about your cat, I want to hear about you! And then he gets drunk and start hanging on me like where about to go to his place and have a one night stand and shit! We’re at fucking lunch!  I swear to god he didn’t even ask one single question about me.” Tony said all in one go. He was visibly upset, waving his hands and his eyebrows crossed. “I’m telling you, it was terrible.”
Steve can do that for Tony. Even if he didn’t want it.
He traveled up the tower to Steve floor; trying his best to calm down. The man was still in flight mode, ready to run from anything and everything.
“Thor! Don’t creep up on me like that, I have a heart condition you know!” Tony jumped. He slowly took off his headphones as Thor gave an apologetic smile.
“I remember what my mom would do when I would hop into her bed. She would make me a mug of hot chocolate, kinda like the way Nat makes it. Then she would tuck me in her bed and tell me about her day at the hospital but making it exciting. Like if a doctor delivered a baby that day, she would change up the name and make them into a monster that messed up the hospital. She used to tell a lot of monster stories, i don’t why, when she had a kid that didn’t want nightmares.” Steve chucked. Tony was listening, he could tell, but wasn’t anywhere close to sleep. His eyes just stared at Steve’s in deep concentration. Steve soon grew insecure under Tony’s constant glaze, “Sorry if I’m talking too much or its too much infor-“
“Do you think about me?” Tony spoke softly.
He had to go!
“Stay there. I’m coming to get you, okay.” He heard Tony move through the phone, probably just nodding. His breathing was hitched and unsteady, as if he was about to die.
“I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but it was never supposed to come to this.” Tony started to run his hand in his hair, never looking at Steve. He was dealing out badly, and Steve had never seen him like this.
Except it wasn’t.
That dream was just uncalled for. The day before was perfect; no one yelling at him, no unexpected triggers or topics that could start the dream. It was actually quite wonderful when you think about it. He got to spend lunch with Steve, which was really a treat as the blonde kept trying to make Tony blush, and he spent the afternoon with Rhodes before the man left again.
“I’m looking for something, don’t worry, just a walkthrough. Stay there and look depressed on the couch, makes me feel better.” Tony spat, not moving to look around. He was in a grey sweatsuit, the one that hugged his curves just the right way that Steve loved so much. The one that lead to other much pleasurable things. Now he wasn’t even able to get close to Tony.
“It’s always been just you and me. You and me. No one else, Steve!” Tony turned back, face heartbroken but voice firm. The sun shone through the window in the otherwise dark room, showing Tony’s watery eyes that held tears threatening to fall down. “Steve you broke that!” Tony spread his arms full length.
Steve couldn’t love Tony, but Tony could always love him. That could be enough. He wasn’t going to be choosy, he could always survive on being friends with Steve. The idea of sharing a bed or holding hands could stay a far away dream that Tony could never reach. Their hands probably wouldn’t fit, he would tell himself or that Steve was too tall to share a bed with. Anything to keep his thoughts from going towards the deep end where he couldn’t get them out of his head.
Steve’s face fit perfectly in the crook of Tony’s neck, the blond giving Tony a kiss along his collarbone. The blonde held Tony close, wrapping both arms around the smaller mans waist. Tony shivered at the contact.
Tony signed deeply. Of course he wasn’t going to tell. Steve didn’t know why he expected much from the man, it never ended up the way he wanted. He pulled from the Tonys grip and walked towards the door. He didn’t know why he even wasted his time.
Steve had messed up royally.
Tony looked a mess.
“It’s not battle time, Captain, you can stand down.” Tony opened Steve’s right fist and saw the glass. He let out a soft gasp once looking at the small seeps of blood and began to cradle Steve’s hand, trying his best to hover over the bloody cracks of skin. “Well a bit of glass isn’t much damage, you’ll survive.”
It was wild.
Tony lunged at the man, their lips connecting. He felt Steve’s arms around his waist and relished in the touch. The kiss was quick and dry, but it didn’t matter. Steve was his own.
“I want to take you out on a date.” The blonde sputtered loudly.
“Why can’t you look at me?” Steve starred at Tony, face full of disappointment. He had been in there for days, days holding Tony’s hand, waiting for the other man to wake up. Just waiting for him to make any movement; to show that he was still there, still alive. “What’s wrong?”
Steve answered the phone, putting it on speaker. The morning sun shined through the window as Steve made the bed, something he hated to do that Tony would always do once they hopped out the bed together. His room, no their room, would be a mess if it was up to Steve. Tony would be making him clean up right now if he was here, being as chirpy as ever.
Tony eyes grew in disbelief.
“Hey Steve, you there? How was your day, well night? I hope your making the bed, I do not want to come back to a messy room.” Came through the phone. Only Tony would worry about that, Steve sighed with a faint smile.
Tony stopped pacing the room, stopping far away from Steve so he wouldn’t be tempted to do that again, he didn’t need to do that again. The man let out a breath. He didn’t make contact with Steve blue eyes, those eyes that were pleading for an answer. His hands turned into a fist, ironically what got them started in this mess.
“Just go.” Tonys voice quivered throughout the room when he figured his hoping wasn’t going to work.
Things are simple now. The general populace hates him. Steve hates himself more, and his Friends seem utterly convinced that tip-toeing around him was helpful.
But, Steve wouldn't really have it any other way.
When Tony had put the plug on Steve and then had to run off to an emergency meeting, Steve had still had faith. Resilient went into a crisis at least once a week, and Tony was an expert at heckling his board, He’d handle it and be home before dinner. When Tony sent three apologetic delay messages, Steve begun losing faith, just a bit.
Soon they are screaming, yelling so loud that Tony sees the agents outside inch away from the room.
If it wasn't so horrifying; he'd be impressed by the work. His feet go
Even worse, Tony hadn’t shown up, had abandoned Steve all alone to deal with the bloody idiots in the bee suits. Toward the end, he had yelled so much that bee keepers had cried themselves into submission at Steve’s feet.
be done with, “it’s over.” he murmurs, hanging his head.
They don’t talk about anything.
The water tends an almost greenish sheen to the air, his skin shimmers like he is something exotic, playing at seduction: a game Thor had witnessed a million times to possibly more satisfactory results.

her to leave.
Tony'd been crucified for the war.
When one lived the life of a superhero; it was an easy enough thing to assume that family was home, and love - the threads of content sewing them together. Easy enough to accept victory as a given; success a team effort for good rather than glory.
Steve for his heart." Stark shook his head, clearly incensed on his behalf. Steve strongly suspected it wasn't just Roger's heart that had been mocked.
So very true, he was. Their gentle giant.
“We fought,” he began, “We hurt each other. I lied, and maybe he did a bit too” Steve grit his teeth, before sighing in resignation. We hid things from each other. "Waited too long to tell certain truths, and now it is too late"
Tony’s victorious look reminds Steve of the first time he had walked into his cell. Steve almost misses that Tony.
He doesn't see Steve for the next 621 days 9 hours and 8 minutes.
Steve is in the road again when he hears the high pitched whine of the repulsors above him. He jerks to a stop immediately. Not sure if it was Tony or something else, Tony had his armor taken over more than once, and apparently Dr. Doom had run around as Iron Man for a bit. His eyes burn with the thought
He took a moment to observe him. Stark did look a little worse for wear. He was pale and thin, his wrists bony - hands shaking ever so slightly. Was he afraid of Steve? Or was it some kind of injury he had sustained? Stark promptly put his hands in his pockets, and met his eyes, cornered - challenging.
Inhaling the smell of
“And break the lovely scene you’d been setting? Excuse an old man his indulgences.”
Steve is a level of beauty Tony has never been able to successfully quantify, or even comprehend. So he lays there, ogling at him unashamedly, let’s his eyes slide over the mighty shoulders, the dip of his spine, the curve of his ass, the crease in between - like it was nothing but a great tantalising secret - a secret he longed to explore - to open it up, and play his tongue over, feel Steve wiggle and gasp beneath his tongue - easily conquered, glad to surrender.
They’d laid flat on the bed, Steve holding Tony down, both breathing fast, exchanging harsh kisses, when Tony had abruptly pulled away and declared he couldn’t have sex with Scott Summers’ long-lost twin brother. Steve had stared at Tony blankly, and may or may have not made an ill-thought-out comment on Sam’s more unfortunate wardrobe choices and Tony’s closet inspirations. Tony had rapidly colored a blotchy red and promptly ran to the mirror to confirm Steve’s words.
Tony woke up slowly. He nuzzled into the soft warm skin beneath him, comfortably warm for the first time all day, and rubbed his eyes. Steve had one arm thrown over Tony’s shoulder, and the other resting softly at his nape. Tony stifled a small smile, gently pushing away from 250 pounds of gorgeous super soldier and slipping his feet into the fluffy red and gold shoes he had insisted on bringing along. Steve had sulked over them all the way to the cottage.
There's nothing behind, and nothing beyond. It feels like the perfect analogy to his life.
‘Be Safe,’ he told him, instead. Steve nodded, a little disappointed but mostly understanding - always the gentleman. It couldn’t be helped, really.
are a scant few, and Steve is so very gentle. Tugging Tony into his mouth, giant palms pressed over Tony knees, kissing at him, tongue peeking in almost like foreplay, rolling Thor’s come out of his body, and pressing it into his thighs.
He slouches and stumbles back into the bed, burying his face on the pillow. It does little to curb his erection and he is now achingly hard. He sighs and snakes a hand under the blanket, and runs a thumb over the head of his cock slowly, returning to his all time favourite fantasies.
He walks forward and absently places his hand on the bars, Steve struggles to his feet, worn and thin, places his hand over Tony’s.
Eventually Tony’s shoulders begin to shake in silent sobs.
On hindsight, it wasn’t a hard decision at all.
Tony woke up with a jerk, hands flailing wildly. Steve’s hands were clamped around Tony’s forearms as he leaned over him, both of them sprawled across the ground, their blankets tangled. Steve felt warm; very warm - Tony was as cold as ice.
“Steve...” Tony muttered gently as Steve pulled him further in. The ‘Bro Line’ between them had always been a bit blurred, but this was getting a little too weird. it was hard on Tony’s already fragile heart. “I need to - ” Steve cut him off, rapidly shaking his head and pulling him even closer.
Steve feels a gentle thrum of contentment.
Here, you're in love with a liar you can never trust.
He looked back at Steve. “My Steve is currently a Nazi,” he spat.” And I am brain dead. The last time we spoke, he asked me when the last time was I drank. The last time he came to speak to me, he told me about all the different ways he was going to ruin everything I had ever built, all the time while mocking
Tony is curled up, a warm pliant weight on Steve’s chest, his legs brushing against the insides of Steve’s own.
He slides his hand back out of his hair, back in his front to spread wide over the finger-shaped bruise Thor had left over the curve of his waist. Even on a trace, Thor's palm feels massive.
but he could have this. For a second, Steve let's himself sag against Tony.
Steve settles on his knees and waits, as she gasps and pants for breath. Waits, as her breasts heave attractively, red hair spilling over the pillows like a halo. Steve waits until he is sure she's okay, and then plops himself on the bed next to her, forcing a grin as she beams up at him, and runs a fond finger through his cheek. He cups her hand in his, mostly to stop the uncomfortable scratching and presses a kiss to her palm. Her eyes crinkle. She looks,
He wants Tony to suffer. But he doesn’t want him to hurt.
Steve shrugged, not bothered about the place enough to correct him, and not invested enough in the conversation to try.
Steve nodded vigorously. Oh Boy! Did he know that.
Steve lets his eyes roll incredulously to look down at Tony's vague silhouette in the dark room. Tears didn’t speak much for a general stage of ‘rightness’ but then again,- he wishes he could take a moment to cry like Tony so often did. Did it make anything easier?
He wonders what he did that could have frightened her so.
that generally permeated around Tony, Steve breathes.
: a sham of a faith that they both pretended they still had in each other. Like this, he shamefully wishes Tony were more like Sharon. Sharon who understood the ideals that dominated Steve’s life better than anyone else.
Steve is being merciful to them both when he ignores the pitiful offer.
When darkness arrived, he welcomed it gratefully.
what he'd do then.
Tony shuffled over to the bathroom, yawning widely. He sat on the stool in front of the mirror and rubbed his nose, reaching for the aspirin on the shelf underneath. He popped a tablet and looked up at the mirror absently as he raised his water glass to drink, only to see pulsing black vines covering his chest.

Honestly! That was just, so,-typical really. It kept in line with how everything else in his life was going on; and the food,-the food seems to gotten just about everywhere. From the bed to the carpet, to even the
He felt a chilling hatred for the part of him that felt an almost mind numbing swooping relief. Steve was gone. And Tony didn’t need to pretend to listen to a conscience he had silenced a long time ago. He could fight the war without Steve’s interference, without Steve hovering over his shoulder every other minute. The jet - a distant spec in the sky - eventually disappeared, not even a glint to be seen.
He knows. Knows it because of this apparent
In reality, Steve sobs as he huddles in the corner of his room.
to be angry with Tony about anything.
Tony's gasping breath echoed jarringly loud in the quiet bathroom, as the wires tightened around his throat.
He held the railing under the wash basin in a white knuckled grip and touched the clear surface, tracing the wires as they went down his shoulders, gently teasing his collarbones, disappearing under the collar of  Tony’s She-Hulk T-shirt.
When after weeks of careful deliberation and mature VOCAL adult conversation, they’d planned ahead, taken their time offs, and devoted whatever they still could to each other. Tony had carefully tied Steve up with black rope so soft, it had felt like candy floss. He had looked into Steve’s eyes the whole time too, and rode him so slowly, luxuriating in him - no hurry, no places to be at for so long that Steve had been left gasping, desperate, and so
Every now and then, he’d dreamt of Tony. Dreamt of standing with him on the roof, as the wind whipped the hair off his face, and if it was an especially lucky day, the light would cast Tony’s face in shadow. Steve would crack a joke no one would find funny, and Tony would laugh, laugh like it was the greatest thing he’d ever heard- his eyes crinkling, sassing back;
, Steve.” He gasps, arching into Steve’s own grip, and rolling back his foreskin,  bending down to Steve’s chest and warming his nipple within Tony’s own mouth, rubbing the flat of his tongue over it, as Steve arched, body bending back pushing into Tony’s mouth, whining helplessly.
Even after all these years, no one calls him Winghead like Tony does.
clumsily loud in the silence. He ignores the sleepy, mildly annoyed looks he receives from the general early-morning populace, milling around before the day begins in earnest, and pushes the clear glass door open.
Oh! The glories of sentimentality. Tony should just surrender to the Freudianism.

He silently walks forward, puts his back to Tony’s and hums an old song his mother used to sing.

He stared blankly at the rolling hologram of Spider-Man spinning in front of him. Sometimes, he looked at his friends: and it would reaffirm him. This was what he was fighting for;  who he’d do anything to protect. Then he’d blink and Steve’s betrayed face would be staring at him with a kind of revulsion Tony hadn’t ever seen on his face before..

, and stupid; One of his favorite things to dream about had been an idea, a thought, a what-if, he'd been alone with Iron Man when his secret identity had been revealed. Tony grinning at him sheepishly in the Ferrari red thong that did little to reduce his near exotic appeal. In his dreams, Steve would draw Tony in with a finger on the string. Tony would come to him, pliant, his eyes half lidded, the electric blue of them glittering in the dark. He'd be so soft, and Steve would be so careful. In his dreams Steve would take off the thong and Tony would want him to.
Steve
talk to Tony. He knows that. Tony would be sympathetic, kind even, and he'd steady Steve's hands for a little while, just by holding them really tight.
Tony drags his hand back around, plays it over his body, drags it up,
Thor smiles, pushing Tony out of his arms and into Steve’s. “You mistake me,” he says, ever so patient, “The honour of singing your glories is a privilege I shall not soon forget.” musing - Thor runs a hand down Steve’s face, “You are,- neither of you, the easily forgotten types.”
Tony looks down, burying his face back into Steve’s chest, “What if I hurt you again?” he asks. It was stupid,- this... this, need for assurance, but communication was their greatest failure - and Steve, was the Avengers’ greatest glory. But, Steve,- Steve just smiles, ever so gentle, and Tony had almost forgotten that he could smile like that, easy and weightless. He raises a hand to push Tony’s hair out of his face, down the slope of his cheekbone, to cup his neck as he was so partial to, pulling Tony into his arms even tighter- “Then, I will have you in the night,” he prays into Tony’s hair, “singing you to sleep, and holding you in my arms like we were all there was to this world.”
Steve is wet,
trusts me.” he can’t quite suppress the pathetic sniff. He rubs his nose on his shoulder. Tony’s hand on his waist tightens.
He ran forward and fell to his knees beside an injured woman. Her skin was grimy and crusted with blood. Tony gently took her by her battered shoulders and flipped her over, gasping as a clearly dead Carol lay limp in his arms. It couldn’t be Carol! Tony would’ve recognized her before if it was Carol. Her blood soaked through his jeans as he stumbled to his feet. It wasn’'t just Carol, Tony noticed with growing horror. Thor was lying at a distance, hands splayed and cape torn. Spider Man was hanging off a tree branch a giant hole burnt through his chest. He saw Luke and Jessica with Danny. He saw Hank and Jan lying on the ground, scant inches from the other. Tony flung around spotting Wanda, Vision, Bobbi, Jessica Drew, Natasha, Bucky, Rhodey,Pepper. Everyone Tony knew.
And there will always be other chances.
“ I expected you to choose me Steve! You said you loved me, you said that every morning when I woke up, but you choose Bucky in the end. You choose him over me! Your boyfriend! I get that he was your only connection to the past, I do, but if you told me what he did this wouldn’t be happening. It would still be me and you! We would still be us!” Tony yelled. He broke away from Steve’s grasp in a huff, turning away from the man.
He turned and looked at the man.
Now she was a empty floor. Nat remembered it from the tour Tony gave and how he insisted that it was completely empty. So it became a hot spot on her radar.
“I’m good. As fine as I can be, Nat. How about we leave and get ice cream or something, it’s getting a bit too depressing in here.” He said popping up, giving her his hand.
Suddenly Tony joined in too with the laugher. It was very silly and sweet, somewhat childlike. It was hysterical with an airy glow. Most importantly, it was real.
The man was wearing a classic black tuxedo and his hair slicked back. The smile plastered on his face showed Clint he was a bit too happy to be there. So either it was faked or he was really really really excited over something simple. This man wasn’t intimidating despite his job label and his height.
Oh gosh, Steve was getting closer. This man was going to kill him, Tony just knew it. He needed to get away but the room was shrinking. There wasn’t anywhere to run; Steve would find him anyway. And there he was, thinking that Steve loved him or even thought the world of him. But Steve hated him. Tony knew Steve hated him since the beginning and Steve tricked him into lying to himself.
Steve wouldn’t be lonely anymore.
“Can, Can you stay on the line?” He asked as if he was scared to be alone.
Soon the man popped out of the elevator wearing jeans and a hoodie with a button down. His causal outfit. Oh, Natasha thought, he actually tried. He’s wearing his causal outfit, the one where he gets desperate and gives it his best to act normal. Natasha let out a soft sigh of pity.
If Steve didn’t kiss him then all of this mess wouldn’t have happened, his mind answered.
“It’s the sixteenth. You would think that after all these years I would move on or at least stop this-“ Tony arms jolted as his eyes stayed with Steve’s, looking for something-anything.
“Yep, were in wonderful shape.” Clint answered again trying to catch Starks eye, “Ready for whatever’s thrown at us next as long as we have the support backing us up, right Tony?”
Steve could sense Tony stepping closer.
Yeah, Steve thought, this contest was going to be worth it.
“Wow huh. Well thanks. ” Tony’s eyes twinkled a bit more, as his smile reached his face fully.
Tony walked out after a while dressed in a grey tracksuit with black sunglasses. His hair was slicked back, wether it be by water or gel. He looked great.
“I don’t know, Steve. I don’t know.” He whispered. Those words were too much for the lump in his throat to handle, but Tony kept it together.
‘Don’t regret it’ was all he could repeat in his mind. He didn’t want to regret that, he had wanted it so much that it was more of a dream come true. Maybe he had just ruined a friendship but it was worth it. Steve just didn’t want to regret it.
Why a planetarium?
Thor learns about Tony’s mother
There were many cars to chose from but he needed something comfortable for all the yawning Tony was doing over the phone. Steve hopped in the Audi and raced out of the garage. He hoped that was comfortable.
“Why’d you do that?” Tony spoke, his voice rising with panic. He began to breathe deeper, trying his best to calm down but it wasn’t working. His eyes looked around the room frantically as he paced around the room, not making eye contact with Steve. “Why’d you do that!”
But what would make Tony want drink? What’s caused him to go to that bar and drink till he forgot? What caused him to get so drunk enough to call Steve for help with a scared voice?
“Your eyes are beautiful too, did you know that?” Steve thought he was pushing it with the flirting but he couldn’t stop. Tony face started to grow red in clear embarrassment as he tried to hide a smile by biting his lips.
It would be hard but worth it. Because maybe they were meant to be. Maybe he could actually try a long term relationship and not just dip when things got hard. Maybe he could claim Steve has his and him as Steve’s. Just maybe-
“If you just came to break my heart some more then get bent.”
Tony liked to paint? Paint? Really?
“I have other responsibilities than just this team Rogers. So I missed one fight, I didn’t know about it. You still took care of it right, it’s not the end of the world!” Tony shot back, voice raising. He began to leen on the door frame, trying his best to mask his sickness.
Steve felt lost. It was hard enough to navigate what Tony was thinking all the time but now he felt lost at sea. On a little raft. Without anything to help him find land. Finding land would be a lost cause just like understanding what was going on in Tony’s head of his. But it was worth the try, Steve loved him too much to give up.
Steve smiles back and thought it was a great idea. Give them all a chance to actually talk to Tony. To actually do something with him. Or see his smile or see his eyes glimmer. To notice if he had dimples are not. Or- no, Steve shook his head. He couldn’t be thinking like that right now.
Tony noticed that he didn’t like this look on Steve. It was so full of desperation.
Steve felt the worst. His face fell. Guilt and regret plummeted in his stomach mixing into a giant blob. It was growing too fast and so hard to contain. Steve was his boyfriend but he didn’t know this. He didn’t even remember. Steve wasn’t there when Tony needed him. Tony was there when he had his accident. But It was like he never was there for Tony. Steve didn’t even know anything about Tony, like his gardening.
It wasn’t enough, Steve thought, thanks for trying but it wasn’t enough. He would need a hundred of those tiny shots to actually feel something. Steve wished he was drunk right now, to not feel this pain. He wished he could tell the bartender to give the whole bottle. But he couldn’t. Steve would look like an alcoholic in front of everybody at the gala. Like he hadn’t looked at an idiot enough?
Steve watched Tony finally look at him, noticing the fierceness in his eyes and how he held himself up taller.
It was the only one reserved for her.
He was just drunk.
The lump in Tony’s throat was coming back. His eyes were becoming wet again. His breaths started to become deeper. It felt like an anxiety attack, Tony knew the feeling by heart. His flight instinct was telling him to go go go but he couldn’t. Tony didn’t want to admit it.
Steve treasured the thought as he bang to cook.
Tony’s legs moved faster than his brain did, sinking towards the ground right next to Steve. He didn’t know what he was doing but he was doing it. He didn’t know why but he was. Tony’s heart raced faster as he took told of Steve hands, watching the blonds head raise up.
Jarvis shipped the silk a few days later and Thor was ready. The rich silk was soft and fit the exact color of the scarf, just like Thor hoped it would do. Soon the scarf would like it was never torn in the first place.
His eyes adjusted to the morning light, blinking a few times, and noticed Tony by the window. The man was in nothing in his boxers, sitting crossed on the couch. His skin looked honey toned as the sun shined, the shadows perfectly shaping his face. It would be a beautiful sight expect for the sad face Tony had. Tony just sat there staring through the window, rubbing a pencil in his hand.
“Well I don’t know what to do now. Maybe you can help.” Tony glanced up at his canvas as he tried to get the pain off with a towel. But instead it smudged even worst, making his cheek and eyebrow blue. Steve had to hold in a laugh.
But Tony didn’t care. He didn’t care then and he didn’t care now. Stark wouldn’t even spare a glance as the doctor checked him out. He focused way too hard on what the doctor was doing instead of Steve, trying to pretend he wasn’t there. Trying to get Steve to leave the room and stop staring at him.
, scratched him when he’d been trying to steal the remote, (And how did that even work? The git could handle stopping his own heart) Steve felt pretty proud about his decision regarding his pants. He leant against the cushions smugly as he watched Tony remorsefully putting his clothes back on, hiding the clamps under an overly large violently purple silk pillow at the bottom most shelf.
The stern woman raises an eyebrow at him, peering at him over top her glasses. Tony gives her everything he has left, his heart beating so hard in his chest. He couldn’t have Steve sleep in the road again.
He sneaks down the floor, consciously not walking too close to the walls,
, there between Tony’s legs, wanting to give him pleasure that makes him almost faint with need. He beckons him closer.
-----
“That was great honey,” she says as soon as she catches her breath; Steve is simultaneously upset and grateful that she hadn't noticed that Steve hadn't cum. She gasps for breath once, and once more before smiling widely, sitting back up.
She looks at him speculatively, as though wondering if he could handle it. She then shakes her head in frustration. “You had an accident. You almost died.” She runs an exhausted hand through her hair. “We’d all been tracking you for weeks. Ever since Tony completely went off radar and two days later, you went missing.

Tony even had the silicon lube already in store. Steve with respect for his own sanity decided not to ask Tony who he had had adventurous amazing shower sex with before. Steve would be better anyway, clearly. He wasn’t trying to overcompensate in any way at all. Steve was, after all, just a Super-Soldier who had fought in World War II.
“What happened?” even his voice is hoarse.
It was Tony's non-subtle way of asking Steve out. Steve would politely ignore it.
Tony groans, tugging Steve’s cock into his hand.

Tony feels safe for the first time in over ten years.
Tony felt hot tears soak his beard as he ran the torch over Steve’s torso, trying to find the source of the blood. There was a sharp jagged wound right over his heart, and Tony took another terrified breath, placing the phone on the ground. He desperately cupped Steve’s face, lying limp and still in his arms.
“Not all our susceptible,” Steve smiles, laying Tony out on the bank, flat against the floor, legs raised, and over his shoulders, “Not all are adaptable either.”
Steve smirks, dancing his thumb inside Tony’s body, “I’m just fine here Anthony.” he bends down spreading Tony’s thighs apart.
Thor slides his arms around Tony’s waist, locking them - arm over the wrist. The tip of Tony’s cock grazes the careless edges of Thor’s fingers. He sets his head by Tony’s shoulder, breathing hot air into his damp neck - “
He took a deep breath, cracked his knuckles, and got to work.

He got interrupted at 68. Sandalwood and some of that aftershave Steve loved, flooding his senses. Tony commanded his tensed muscles to relax one after another. They knew now was not the time to be undisciplined. Certainly not time for them to look for an excuse to lean on Steve.

But Tony can, so he does.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With an ungodly shriek, Tony dropped the glass, upended the stool and backed away from the mirror, tripping over his feet and falling to the floor with a loud crash.
Thor roves his eyes over Tony’s body: a satisfaction: the conquering victor. “You needn’t ask Dear Friend,” he says, his voice thrums, deep and resounding.
Every charlatan has a charade, and every charade comes to an end. Tony Stark knew this better than most, he’d been there and lived through it.
that food does when people have no time to clean up.
“They may not necessarily have been weak.” Steve offers from behind. Tony flings around. Thor, however, seems remarkably unperturbed for someone interrupted in a time of vulnerability. “We are defined by what we are at our weakest.” Steve shakes his head, “Those moments do not define us.”
Steve looks up as he comes in, a childish look of delight on his face. Neither of them fared well in loneliness.
There were so many things he could've said instead. 'He always considered you his home.' 'He trusted you with a ferocity that would surprise you.' 'He was so protective of you, that he could hardly

been, all the while considering it a weakness. "He Loved You" he'd said. Steve shouldn't hurt so much that was what his counterpart had chosen to reveal to Tony.
Steve wonders how his life had come to this
But benefits for the sake of the good fight, and just benefitting were two exceptionally different things. Tony would dare to go ahead and say there was almost a certain grandiosity to it: fighting, winning, and bleeding together.
It does something to his chest, sharp nagging pains, like broken faith and a lost optimism filled with things like hope, and
“We tried not to make it personal of course” Stark looked at Steve. Elbows on the table - hands rubbing each other nervously. “But that never works out for us does it? You and I; It always becomes personal”
For Tony, Steve would go through everything a million times over. He sometimes struggles to even understand it. How it was even possible to love so unselfishly, so instinctually, so ferociously.

“Tony… Tony!! TONY!!!”
with the effort of not just grabbing Tony and having him again. It shoots sharp tingles of pleasure up his spine, his legs spread open accommodating and ready in response.
And Steve has had enough of being a burden on everyone.
“Don’t be us Kid. You don’t want to be us,” he said quietly, gently squeezing his shoulder.
A better man would have explained himself to these people, these people who’d walked through the gates of hell with him.
Tony crawling away from Steve in a hotel exactly like this, sobbing that he couldn't help it. Sniping that Steve should beat him up and that he wouldn't,
Steve was convulsing into the water, sharp and uncoordinated, hips clenching and pumping, his hands tightening over Tony’s ass, opening him almost painfully wide. Tongue dancing inside his body with focused intent. Whatever was left of Thor long cleaned out. Its Steve’s flesh over Tony’s own. Rubbing into his walls, his lips mouthing wetly where Tony was speared open. The pleasure is almost too much, too overwhelming. Tony wiggled and gasped, his body twisting and digging into the rock in uncomfortable places, wiggled as Steve curled his tongue inside Tony, curled it, opened Tony up with his thumbs, pushing himself in further like he could barely get enough- all the while hips pistoning into Thor’s fist under the water: sweat gleaming in wet drops on his forehead, glinting at the tips of his blond lashes, shoulders bunching with the weight of Tony’s legs, thumbs holding him open: like this was all he’d ever wanted.
It was cute, to say the least.
It was too late. The damage was done. Thor had ruined it for good and Tony’s face told it all, he just made the biggest mistake. This small scarf, a old hand woven scarf was now ripped into two so easily. And now it was ruined.
Steve takes care of Tony when he’s drunk
Well Steve was always cold, of course his bed would be the same.
Tony didn’t last the day. Steve had stormed in there with a nervous look on his face. Tony didn’t know what to do and what he did, if he did anything at all.
Steve went along with his day. He called Tony at lunch, the man sounded fine. He had lunch with Nat and worked out. It seemed like a good day.
“Are you blushing?” The sleepy voice teased. It wasn’t hoarse or squeaky but sounded as smooth as honey. Tony could feel the mans breath against his skin, how warm it was. Gosh this man made his tongue tie and his stomach fill with butterflies; he was off the rails.
“Ok,“ said Clint, his voice raising in excitement, “we have a whole week to learn as much about Tony as we can. But nothing we already know counts, so no cheating. And you can’t ask Jarvis. Whoever learns the most wins.”
He still shivered under the blanket that had somehow fell down, scooting closer to whatever was warm next to him. It felt like a person, their legs foreign Tony’s skin. They were long and masculine, but warm, warm enough for Tony to curl his cold feet under.
Steve sat down next to the man and squeezed his hand.
“But I’m wearing mismatched socks. And my hair messed up. And- ” He pulled her back. His eyes were frantic, looking for something that was right in all this supposed mess.
Silk and needles and all the tools you use here on Earth.” Thor explained as he brought out the scarf.
But he could feel cold icy fingers tracing something on his skin, somewhat ticklish but soft at the same time. His heart swelled. Now Tony needed to see who was going all these sweet things. Did they know who he was? Because he didn’t deserve sweet things.
Natasha was lurking at 3 a.m.
He walked closer towards the man until he reached the couch. Tony still hadn’t noticed him.
Steve was awoken by the call late at night,  maybe midnight, but was soon alert once hearing Tony’s voice. Maybe he was in some type of danger? Maybe he was kidnapped or something? Or in some type of simple trouble? He hopped out of the bed, quickly finding clothes with the phone by his ear.
He wasn’t enough.
The tears kept coming down his face and Tony didn’t have the effort to stop. He just needed to breathe. If he breathed then he could stop crying and stop thinking about that damned dream. He could move on with his life and try to survive with being evil.
All Tony could see was a bright white light. It was like a cube, painted all white, and he right in it. Only him and this endless road towards. Or backwards. Tony thought he was dead and maybe he was; but the white didn’t make any sense.
“Thanks for helping me out back there. Sorry I froze.” He said quietly, and if Clint wasn’t trained to hear it he wouldn’t have. That was something else about Tony. In the media, he’s loud and brass but in real life, he’s quiet.
“No! Everything’s okay, I promise, just calm down.” Tony interrupted, almost yelling through the phone. The mans voice sounded hoarse like he had just been screaming, or worse, crying!
What was most weird was that he could actually breathe. There wasn’t a light blue glowing out of his chest, there wasn’t even a scar. It didn’t make sense. Tony kinda wished it was back, he had grown too fond of it. It felt weird without it.
Why was Tony up?
“I know Tony!” Steve yelled back but softening his voice as he saw Tony step back, “ I know. Your right, it was you and me. And, and I don’t want it to disappear- I-I don’t want to lose you.” Steve didn’t dare look at Tony, his voice was breaking.
Tony’s tear is hot and wet when it lands on Steve’s chest. He quickly wipes it away, but the damage is done.
Tony smiles grimly. “How many times have you said that before?” he wonders out loud. It’s not designed to injure, but curiosity had its price, and so did love. Tony is accustomed to paying for both. Thor smiles, pardoning the transgression, something irrevocably sad in his eyes, “I am a God, My Friend.” he says, “Let me have my mysteries.”
Tony was the one person Steve had wanted around him after it all. Now they were both fallen from grace.
“Turns out, I wasn’t the late one,” Thor says, his eyes are warm, fond. “The war, however, it seems is yours, Captain.”
Ty grinned at him, with the usual half-mad look in his eyes. Tony’s heart beat so hard, he was truly surprised it didn’t echo over the dark room.
But Thor lets him have his indulgence, a mummer’s ploy -
It was a luxury, something he let them have. Vulnerable here, with his arms thrown back and up over Steve’s shoulder, legs spread with only Thor to watch: it feels like something much more.
She looks startled at Steve's sudden eagerness, and pulls her clothes on in rapid motions, quick and jerky, like she was in a hurry, or scared. Steve stops to pick her stilettos by the door, and offers it to her. She takes it and sends him an unsure smile. Steve smiles back at her weakly. Her face softens from the confusion to mild concern. She looks at him assessing, and then her eyes widen. She nods jerkily, and scampers out of the room.
; tugs Tony’s body out of the bank, his palms closed over the globes of his ass, down hovering over the water, with Steve spreading him open to the damp heat. “Tony, Tony, Tony,-” he chants, his voice half-muffled, buried into Tony’s body like it was all he knew. Tony bit his lip, pulling his hands away from Steve’s and burying them in his own hair, instead.
, the pleasure is almost distant, he's enjoying the warmth more, the goosebumps that trail in the wake of his fingers. He throws his head back: rolls a nipple, tugging at it gently between his thumb and forefinger, lets the other hand slide suggestively into the water.
Easy to say 'I am Spartacus' with fifty others yelling the same next to you after all. Context considered.
Stark got up and walked back to the window, wrapping his thin hands over too prominent ribs, a sign of vulnerability his Tony would never have shown him. Steve from the bottom of his heart felt a visceral jealousy for this other Steve. He’d had to go through the entire ice thing too, but he’d woken up to people who’d grown to care for him. Who saw him as something beyond a symbol. He looked at Stark, staring numbly off into space, even the memory of losing Rogers seemed to hurt him, regardless of whether or not the other Steve was currently alive.
“When did you get here?” Tony asks, ignoring everything else. Steve grins. “I would not miss your shows for all the wealth in the world, Anthony,” he says, his eyes, teasing. The dark from the past few months seemed to recede every day. Prison had left its mark on Steve. Rattled him like fewer worse things in his past had not managed to. But he was getting better: much to general delight. When Tony had woken that morning in Steve’s arms: he’d been smiling in his sleep.
, he is almost constantly worried, he looks behind his shoulder a million times over and there's nothing.
Steve isn't stupid. He knows what is real and what isn't. Vegas doesn't exist. That is real. He knows the fear of the Illuminati reassembling wasn't real. (Tony hadn't even apologised) but Steve did
Tony fell on his back,is breath leaving him in sharp bursts. He placed a hand over his heart, still gasping. He looked at Spiderman. The wound was so obviously a repulsor burn.
Tony simply glows. His eyes are tender as he presses a kiss to Steve's knuckles. The armours would be even better now, with Steve's own input.
Tony wonders what kind of monster could have done that to Steve.
“I’m not a thing to be claimed,” Tony breathes, he doesn’t believe they think that; not really. He’s more curious as to what they have to say. Steve hmms. “No.” he acquiesces, “You are far too big to be anything so easily claimed. Took me fifteen years to come close.” He pats Tony’s hair, “Not something easily forgotten.”

left a bitter taste in his mouth. Steve shakes his head and shoves Tony out of his mind.
How could he hope to explain the complexities of his relationship with Tony to her? To the naked eye, their relationship probably defined unhealthy. Steve still wasn't sure it it wasn't.

he has on people. He hiccups a sob.
But he couldn’t have him. This was just a one off and would never happened again, Tony reasoned. He needed to calm down and take a cold shower. They were never going anywhere. There wasn’t a Steve and Tony in the future. There wasn’t a Tony and Steve. Damm, there wasn’t a Tony and everyone in the future! Tony has brought his hopes up for nothing, he had brought Steve’s hopes up, but was selfish enough to try and get a taste of that life. Tony was wasting Steve’s time, he knew he was, and he needed to go. Steve’s buff arms weren’t going to stop him, Tony needed to go.
. Tony nuzzles into him, had it been anyone else, Steve might have thought it awkward; but any hints of shyness or discomfort he might have felt had been long since burnt out the first time they had seen each other naked.

Happy waited patiently for Tony to regain his composure before helping him back up to his feet, standing close until Tony regained his breath.
Steve, of course, in his typical Steve-ness, decided to fly off into space to fight them. Earlier, He had come close, a secretive smile on his lips, the familiar look of longing in his eyes as he looked at Tony, leaning forward temptingly, it had felt like a lead up to a perfect kiss. If the past Tony had known how much less he'd deserve Steve in the future than he already did, he'd have kissed him years ago.
He started shoving at Steve’s shoulders, suddenly quite worried. Surely Steve was alright?
Steve should,- Steve should probably clean. He surveys the room, The discarded takeout boxes, the dirty clothing littering the floor, the empty beer bottles lying morosely on the ground, and tries to quell the rapid tide of rising disgust.
Steve is grateful. It’s easier to talk to Tony like this, easier to not have to worry about judgment, wonder if the ever-present faith in Tony’s eyes would recede somewhere quiet and distant. It’s shameful. This hope for comfort. This,- this pitiful
Blue-eyed Tony sat across, hands folded over his chest restlessly tapping his fingers on his forearm, giving Steve an extremely familiar defensive look. He seemed to want to say something, but promptly thought the better of it. Clearly the Steves and Tonys didn’t have it easy, in any universe.
Tony shivers. There is something about Steve, so powerful, so great, so
He sighs in relief, uncurling his hands - his fingertips leaving bloodied crescents on his palms. They smear as he pulls back.
He can’t quite make his mind up if Tony crying is the most beautiful thing in the world, or the most embarrassing.
“Thor” Tony gasps. He raises to the balls of his feet, but Thor was too massive, too insurmountable - his strength so vast, Tony feels like a squirming elk between them. A pup, a plaything, a toy: so absolutely owned - wagging his tail for the master who’d dared to tame him. “Thor” he moans again, as Thor rests a thumb over his tip, rolling over the skin. He wouldn’t let his hand stray anywhere else. He had no need to, Thor’s hand something far too distinct to be human - Tony would recognize it anywhere in all the world.
Steve feels colder than he had in the ice.
He chokes and covers his mouth with a hand that is no longer bloodied. His knees buckle. He crumples, letting himself fall for a second, and then -
When everything was as ready as could be and both of them naked, Steve suddenly recognized how intensely awkward the situation was. It was all fun and games when you were friends, and Steve knew a lot of people who’d unquestionably been good friends and eventually escalated their relationship into something more, but Tony and Steve had been friends for
He doesn't open his mouth for the rest of the session. Or any session afterward.
Coughing from the smoke, Tony fled without looking back. If Ty burned to death, it would probably be for the betterment of all of mankind.
It shouldn’t have been so surprising. His cock shouldn’t have jumped to attention, hard and leaking over his stomach, flushed and so very ready for Thor’s aesthetic pursuits.

He assumes murder is not something super-heroes do.
“It makes us experience our greatest fears,” Steve said.
Tony ignored Steve’s sulking completely. Over the years, he had definitely built up some kind of immunity to it. He closed his eyes as some shampoo commercial rolled on the ancient television. He’d just have a bit of a shut-eye, and worry about his diminishing relationship with Steve when he wasn’t quite so cold and floating in gallons of hot chocolate.
He absently traced the photo of the Founders he always kept in his lab, Stephen Strange was undeniably a fine man, Tony didn't doubt his skills. But this was hardly the first time Tony had made Steve forget something on purpose. And this was definitely not something a handshake could solve. Not that Steve and Tony were even capable of handshakes these days. Their relationships tended to oscillate between sweet hugs with deeply emotional conversations and earth shattering fights.

Ty traced a thin, claw-like hand on Tony’s jean-clad thigh, stroked his face in a lover’s parody of a caress, before leaning forward, holding his head in a death grip and stealing a violent kiss. Tony felt the hot blood and ash bubbling in Ty’s mouth like acid. He retched, ripping himself away from  his former friend so violently that Ty fell into the fireplace.
Steve, of course being the mature and obviously the intellectually superior being, changed back into pajamas before Tony came back. He clearly wasn’t getting any tonight.
The room was warm, cozy, but Tony still felt stifled for some reason. He regretfully pushed himself away from the warmth of the fire-place and stumbled onto the door, still mostly doozy.
to feel needed and loved.
Tony stumbled forward, ignoring the monologue, the world was ending; everything was dying; and Tony should have really kissed Steve before he left. He placed his hand on the warm alive metal of Steve’s chest plate, a hand over his heart.  Steve had always thrummed with life, warmth, compassion, even while wearing what was debatably the world's greatest killing machine.
He had nothing to prove.
He tightened the knot on Steve’s chest as something made a delicate
Steve keened over Tony, his ‘hmm’ thrumming into Tony’s own body, the pleasured sound shorting out Tony’s brain. “Steve” he gasped, reaching an arm out to his hair, sinking his fingers into the lovely golden folds; pushing himself down into Steve’s face. Steve whined some more, pulling back, peppering sweet chaste kisses into Tony’s skin, mouth still so very eager like he could not get enough of him. When Tony arches and whimpers, Steve grunts out -
his brain begs.
“For yourself?” Thor is almost cruelly amused.
Steve doesn't see Tony for the next 364 days 14 hours and 36 minutes.
Tony is explaining something about the armour with elaborate gestures. He grabs Steve's hand and drags him deeper into the lab, still talking a mile a minute. Steve interrupts Tony because
The red of the incursion sky flamed overhead. Steve stood in front of him, in all his American glory - wearing the armor Tony had so painstakingly designed for him. He'd have felt bitter if he had been capable of dredging up the required emotions for it. He did feel a weird sense of pride. And was that relief?
Steve shakes his head. Burdening Tony was fruitless. He'd appreciate a talk: but not about this. Not with Tony who loved Steve with an abandon bordering on obsessed worship. He can't talk to Tony, especially with something like this.
Steve sucks his finger into his mouth, laves his tongue over the pad of it: now smooth and devoid of calluses, built up with no trace of his history as he was. Steve licks Tony’s thumb further into his mouth, hallowing his cheeks around it, sucking in earnest, like he wished it were Tony’s cock instead that was resting its heavy weight on his tongue, his arm tightening around Tony’s waist, almost cruel in their strength.
Here, the liar is terrified of you because that has been

Tony laughs, looks down, pretentiously coy, “Oh! You know” he flutters his fingers through the air. “Enlightenment.”
Tony nods, "I'll always come for you" he says, as though it was obvious, wringing his hands a little nervously.
Tony had wished a million times over that Steve would never remember, he had wished a million times over that he would. That Steve would shout at him. He wished Steve had hit him the face.
Steve remained terribly terrifyingly still. Tony groaned, a quiet noise from the back of his throat, scrambling with one hand for Steve and with the other for his phone. He grabbed Steve’s lolling head desperately, pulling Steve to himself, turning the torch function on and then slapping his face, sharply, all the while begging him to wake up. Steve remained still.
Steve was immediately reminded of himself after he had first woken in this century, he’d been defensive and short too. Terrified of everything strange. Stark though, he seemed completely proficient in pretending that everything was alright, when everything around him was clearly on fire. Steve suddenly felt his heart go out to the man. Surely, he could say something? Stark had been cordial so far. Steve, at the very least, owed him the same.
But, Tony has always been a generous lover, a painfully honest one. When Steve took him into his arms, that day when Tony had woken up after months of sleep: kissed him like he’d found an oasis- things had changed. Tony could no longer afford games, with who he was, and who Steve was: lies were out of the question. Lies had gotten them into this mess. Honesty and love would get them out. Frivolous as it may seem to the sceptic.
eyes.
He’s always hated the hard truths.
He tightens his grip around Tony's body, holding Tony up as much as Tony is holding
In the end, it is about as anti-climactic as it can be, as Tony, after a decisive node to himself, just walks forward and hugs Steve, running warm well worked hands through Steve's hair in gentle consolatory motions. “Steve” he says softly, testing the name out. And when Steve stands stiffly, Tony pulls Steve closer, and nuzzles his nose against Steve's throat. Tony smells of metal, expensive cologne, and something that always felt like the mansion.
would have known. But Steve had seen the bruises on his skin. Heard the white faced assessment of Tony's doctors.
Tony laughing as Steve corners him in the lab, his laughter fading into moans as they move against each other in perfect sync on one of Tony's many tables. Tony grease stained, as Steve tries to touch every inch of him all at once. Steve bends down to run his fingers through Tony's lips, Tony sucks Steve's fingers in, eyes glinting in mischief and adoration. Steve feels his breath leaving him in a laugh. Sex with Tony was just so much
Civility hardly lasts and soon they’re screaming at each other over the bars, hurling accusations and below the belt blows.
Tony stared at his hands vacantly, tears obscuring his vision.
Tony pulls away when he reaches too hard, a wet strand of drool connecting Steve’s flushed red skin to Tony’s mouth, “Or what I could be,” he hums.
Nothing to say that being a Superhero did not have its perks.
“I didn’t always,” Tony agrees, easily enough. There is an undercurrent of guilt in his tone, but no regrets. Steve wants to hate him for that. He tightens the arm-thrown over Tony’s waist instead, slides his palm down the slope of Tony’s back, skirting the inside of Tony’s sweaty thighs. It's almost whimsical, an opportunity to hold Tony in his arms again. More for the fact that he won't get to do it for long. He lets his nails catch at the parts where he knows Tony is most sensitive, up to spread his cheeks open to the dark air, and slide a digit in where Tony is swollen and dribbling over Steve’s fingers. He scoops some out. Plays his obscenely large fingers over Tony’s readily available body, rubbing his spend into Tony’s skin.
It was a good decision, Steve knew. A mature decision taken by consenting adults. Obviously, they’d both have to understand each other's limits and restraints. It made sense that they started off with some normal good natured spanking. Tony had managed to get his hands on some paddles easily enough and flung them on the bed with enough disregard that Steve was sure that he wasn’t lying about being comfortable with it. Like 90% sure. One could never be completely positive.
First Thor had taken him, strong and forceful: up against the glass with the whales swimming behind them. Now, Steve would stake his claim. A stupid game of Russian Roulette where Tony was always the gun.
Tony kissed him before Steve could say ‘I told you so’.
The third time Steve and Tony try to do something adventurous, everything works out reasonably well,  and it really hadn’t been their fault that everything inevitably went to shit.
