“Wait, you must tell me your name!” Sherlock shouted, reaching after him just to wince and grab the bruise again.
Nope, can’t do that, eyes too-- eyes. John turned his gaze down to his lap, instead. “Sherlock, I know you’ve just gotten out of a relationship, but maybe you should just-- consider. Think about why you want people arrested for flirting with me.”
Sherlock blushed. “Well. I have-- I refused to let him…” Sherlock cleared his throat. “I only ever sleep over at his flat.”
He slowly slid his feet along the floor, giving John ample time to follow him and learn the steps. Before he knew what was happening-- he may have been distracted by Sherlock’s sweet scent-- John was spinning just like all the ton in the next room.
“John?” He asked hesitantly. He scoffed at himself-- asking permission to enter his own bedroom. He turned the knob slowly, anyway.
John liked to imagine the dial-up screech coming from his mouth as he laid there, eyes closed, hands under his chin.
The doctor, a short, round black woman that John hadn’t met around the clinic yet, escorted Sherlock back with a firm arm around his bicep.
John let out a sigh of relief when he saw her at the other end of the hall the next week. She gave him a friendly wave.
"No more privileged than I feel because you allowed me to be fully myself with you, John. It is the first time I receive such…unconditional acceptance." A moment of pause, then Sherlock continued. "I trust you know how important you are for me.”
It was then, as Sherlock pulled John even closer to him, that he realized with surprise that he was hard.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said gesturing with his hand, “This is John Watson, my bond-mate.” The woman smiled as he continued the introductions. “John, this my...our landlady, Mrs. Hudson.”
John blinked his eyes, trying to muster a reply. He was completely stunned by Sherlock’s speech. The mere idea he could have a romantic relationship with someone that was not his master was totally alien to him.
“I don’t know what you find so amusing in that page,” Sherlock’s annoyed voice said from behind him.
Sherlock wondered if John’s empathy was due to the loss of his own first bondmate, Colonel Nicholas Coleman. He had made researches, of course, but he had not been able to discover much about the bondmates’ relationship.
“Damn!” he said under his breath, as he ran along the sidewalk looking right and left. There was no sight of Sherlock. He had lost him.
Sherlock thought after several more strokes changed nothing, and he was finally forced to admit nothing was going to happen. This was the only sexual practice he enjoyed, and now he was not even able to take it to its natural conclusion!
John kissed Sherlock’s forehead and settled down to sleep. He had the gut feeling he would need all his energy to keep up with Sherlock’s newfound interest for sex...and wasn’t it an exciting prospect?
Was that fucking scots gaelic? Oh this Macfucker was moving up the shitlist like a champion racehorse. Pretentious, probably kilt-owning--
“There are a fuckton of dead bodies downstairs, lads, might want to take it down a notch.” Lestrade grunted.
Lestrade looked askance at John, who just shrugged. And then smirked at Sherlock’s back, confident in the knowledge that he was a sexy, irresistible army doctor with gorgeous eyes and strong arms.
“Oh, easy, it’s her neighbor. Not being stalked, she sees him because they live in the same building.”
After about a month of this, Sherlock regularly ducking out in his ridiculously tight shirts and smiling secretively at his phone, John asked, “So, are you and Alex getting on well?”
“You are, I don’t--” Sherlock cut himself off. “Well, be however you like. Yes, I am dating Alex. Don’t worry, I won’t bring him here and disturb you often.”
Sherlock was sipping some dark liquor, reclining in the booth next to the radio while the rest of them talked about sports and various other manly topics. John, sitting on a wooden chair pulled up to the edge of the table and thus sitting across the corner from Sherlock, regularly caught his eye to make sure he was still having a fun time and didn’t need to go home. Sherlock gave him a tight smile every time. It wasn’t very convincing, but John decided if he was making the effort to appear happy, he wanted to stay.
“Sorry, uh, must be, uh, something I saw on television.” Sherlock stuttered out, quickly turning back to the body to finish his deductions.
I never intended to make a second part to this, but it is actually very cathartic for me so I hope someone else is feeling comfort from it too.
“Yeah, the worst part was waiting while he recovered. Sherlock bored and on forcive bed rest? Not a good combination. I wanted to tie him up just to stop him tearing the flat apart.”
Sherlock grunted in irritation, pulling his phone out of his pocket. He looked at the screen and turned off the ringer without answering the call. John caught his eye across the scene, nodding slightly to acknowledge that they both knew it was Alex.
“You’re telling the truth,” Sherlock’s eyes were wide and shining in awe. “You really believe that.”
John shook his head like an etch-a-sketch to dismiss the image of Sherlock and military men. “Okay. So. What do I do now?”
The king interrupted before Sherlock could insult their subjects any further. “What Sherlock means to say is, were any of you at the ball last night so that you may compare your hand to the bruise on my son’s arm?”
“Yes, yes, um, I do have a question,” Sherlock said. He stood up to crowd over John, between them only their respective hands holding cups of tea. “Can I have sex with you?”
“Exactly. You don’t like it, it’s not nice, I should stop.” Sherlock straightened as he turned away. “I will stop.”
John smiled, letting Sherlock tempt him into the shadows between the window panes. “Mm, all the fancy ladies out there are lined up to dance with you, why should I steal one?”
Sherlock frowned. John would never admit it but he kind of loved when Sherlock frowned because he really threw his whole face into it and it looked quite funny. He’d even put him in a strop on purpose once just to see the wrinkles under his neck appear.
Sherlock’s phone rang, but he ignored it as he ran across the concrete floor to take pictures of the messages.
“You know, when a guy says, ‘I owe you one’,” Lestrade grumbled on the other side of the line, “It doesn't mean he actually owes you one. It’s just something people say.”
John blushed, which was very handy, since he couldn’t really blush on command. “Haven’t had a boyfriend in years, but no, yeah, I’m single right now.”
Sherlock dropped his toast and focused all of his attention on John while still managing to ignore the question. “You don’t like him.”
The majority of the trash was piled around the desk, surrounding a high backed leather desk chair. Sherlock was rifling through the closet, scarf pulled over his nose to block the smell. There was a lacrosse stick propped in the corner, but covered in dust. Other than that, it was hard to really see more about the room since it was so messy.
It was at this point, John halfway to boiling, that Alex smiled, leaned across the corner, and softly kissed Sherlock.
Lestrade looked askance at John, “Professor Cameron? From the Pythagoras case? I think it was Dimmock on that one, actually.”
Sherlock came over from where he’d been colluding with a forensic aide holding a laptop. “John, let’s go, I found the girl.”
“It should be!” Sherlock burst out, rather loudly in the contained cab. They both made eye contact with the cabbie in the rearview mirror, and John held a hand up with a tight smile to apologize.
“We’ve met, actually,” the man replied, shaking his hand. He had a soft Scottish burr. “Don’t you remember the Pythagoras case?”
Sherlock looked up, bright eyes and giant, open mouthed grin making him look ten years younger. “Physics, John! The library in Alexandria may have had evidence of planets in the solar system hundreds of years before their previously recorded discovery!”
An imprecise time and three blood bags later, Mycroft’s tense expression relaxed as he pressed two fingers against his brother’s neck. "The pulse is stronger," he said.
John never completed that thought as the drop of his adrenaline levels after so much excitement left him exhausted. He fell asleep on his armchair unmindful of his bad shoulder and with a slight smile on his lips.
John moaned as he felt the proof his Alpha’s desire against his thighs. The press of that hardness made him almost frantic with the need to feel Sherlock’s skin against his own and he pulled away from the kiss. “We are both overdressed…” he panted. His erection was pressing against his jeans and his tights were damp with his natural lubrication. He was very excited, since this was the first time he was going to have sex of his volition and with a partner he desired in almost twenty year. No wonder he was already so turned on!
To his surprise, Sherlock-- or subconscious Sherlock, replied. “Romantically, sexually, platonically, any way I can have you. I just never want you to leave my life.”
John stood, but Sherlock stayed down, gently patting on and around the girl’s body, carefully avoiding mussing any evidence. “Ah! Even better!” He held a cell phone aloft pinched in his fingers.
“Exactly. That coat must cost more than my rent. So why would he need a flatmate if he can clearly afford to live alone?”
“Fine, princess, what exactly do you want?” John said, the exasperation hidden behind the laughter in his tone.
Sherlock’s eyes refocused on John. It was strange, seeing the way they narrowed like they normally do when he was deducing something particularly hard. John knew his brain must be quite foggy from the drugs right now, so it was like watching gears struggling to turn.
John secretly loved when Sherlock talked a mile a minute to intimidate clients. It was fun watching their eyes get wider and wider.
Externally, John was mostly calm, save a brief flaring of nostrils. Internally, the Macfucker was waving a red flag and John was a bull blowing hot air around a nose ring.
John felt his hackles raise for a moment before he realized what was going on. “Nope, you’re not goading me. We’re going to the clinic, princess.”
He kept his hands clasped behind his back as he looked around the house. From what he could tell, it seemed like a normal, average home. Middle class, single child. Both parents working, latchkey kid.
“If he hadn’t given her the pills, if he’d made her take the poison like the rest of them, he’d be gone by now. We wouldn’t have found him so quickly, he might have already assumed a new identity by the time we connected it.” Sherlock said.
The nurse paused, glanced at the patient who was in a coma on the bed in front of them. “I do, yeah.”
“Mmm, army, soldier,” Sherlock said in a low tone. His mouth pulled up at the corner, the effect somewhat ruined by the cotton shoved in his cheeks. “All the nice girls like a man in uniform.”
Lestrade, startled, said his thanks. Sherlock was already walking toward the stairs, and John waved goodbye as he quickly followed.
It was only later, as the police force were tearing up his new flat, that it clicked for John. Sherlock hadn’t confessed a secret because he didn’t have any. Everyone knew he used to be on drugs. Angelo knew he was gay. Sherlock was open, flayed out for the world in a way that John had literally never experienced before. He was the first honest person that John had ever met.
John mouthed what? up at the ceiling in amazement. “Okay, how about this: This teenager says he always does his work correctly, almost every question perfect, and yet he’s failing the class. He thinks his maths professor is trading his scores for another student’s.”
There was a tense pause on the other side of the phone, and then a sigh. “Okay. Well. I’ll see him when I see him, I guess. Goodbye.”
Sherlock shifted slightly, now more interested. He remained silent as John sluggishly brought one knee down between Sherlock’s spread legs, crawling over him gingerly, before finally bringing his chin into the nook of Sherlock’s neck and deflating over him.
“Right well, from what I can tell, his wisdom teeth came in and became infected. His lymph nodes are swollen to high heavens, but I suspect if they just take them out, he’ll be right as rain.”
Sherlock reached forward and downed the rest of his second drink, and then held it up to John as evidence. “Need another. Bathroom.”
The next morning, John awoke from the sweetest dream. He’d been dancing across a lake with Sherlock, no kingdoms or horses anywhere in sight, just the two of them waltzing on clear and cool water.
John came around the desk, and Sherlock distractedly made room for him. The tall genius was now staring off into the distance, looking hurt and confused. John ignored the puppy dog eyes for the moment to focus on the screen.
On the other side, the room was darker. The windowpanes in the door off the ballroom let light in, but it quickly faded. There weren’t candles lit in here, and John was finally alone. He took a deep breath and blew it out.
“Well-- Okay, maybe for most, but,” John stammered. “I’m, we’re… best friends. More than best friends. I’d take a bullet for him.”
John made his way up to the platform, and started climbing the steps. Two spears crossed to block his path. He rolled his eyes. “Sherlock!” he called up.
John wandered off, starting to feel nauseated by the smell. He scanned around the warehouse in boredom as Sherlock went over each body. He stopped by a set of concrete stairs.
John was taken aback, but agreed. Sherlock hopped up, apparently already ready to hit the pub in one of his tight silk shirts and posh trousers. Could probably pull in slacks, the gorgeous bastard.
John risked a glance back up at Sherlock. He was staring at John, eyebrows so far down over his eyes that he must be getting a headache, looking violently confused.
Sherlock and John climbed out of the cab on the dirty edges of London, the unfashionable end of the Thames on their left and a large, abandoned warehouse in front of them. Shipping containers sat rusting to their right. Sherlock and John, in unspoken agreement, were focused on the case and temporarily ignoring the Alex problem.
An hour later, Sherlock and Alex were prowling along the corridor of the high school while John completed the triangle behind them. Bloody long legged bastards, six feet and all, making John scurry like a fucking mouse behind their stupid--
Sherlock looked utterly stunned. He jaw was hanging open like he was trying to catch flies. He collapsed down onto his chair across from John.
Sherlock stared hard at him, and Lestrade looked down at John in confusion. John could just watch Sherlock’s synapses firing as he tried to connect some deja vu of John putting him in cuffs. John had hoped he’d never remember what he said on the laughing gas, but clearly Sherlock’s mind was trying to connect the dots.
For Alison, he gave her sleeping pills. He didn’t want to see her suffer like the others. He’d had a moment of weakness.
Cameron lifted a tea glass off the side table and tapped it, still wearing that smile that made John oddly irritated.
“Oh.” John felt rather strange. Like his stomach was being shrink wrapped with warm plastic. “Are we… happy about that?”
Sherlock smiled the teethy smile that said “We’d love if you agreed, but you’d really, really hate it if you didn’t agree.”
John frowned at that comment, but before he could respond, Sherlock said, “Yes, well, I have the brains but John has common sense. Which really isn’t quite so common now, though.”
Sherlock shook his head, eyebrows raised. “No memory of it. I was rather… high on excitement that evening.”
“Yes, good, Sherlock, I’m a doctor. An army doctor, in fact,” John smiled like he was explaining things to a child. He couldn’t wait to relay this all to Greg later.
Alex and Sherlock looked at him, Sherlock’s eyebrows coming down as he opened his mouth to make a scathing comment on how John could handle bullets flying at him but not seeing his own flatmate kiss another man, but John held one finger up. “Right. Nope. Not having it. Be back in a few.”
“You don’t like him…” Uh oh. That was the deducing voice. Here comes the whammy, John thought. “And not just because of how he treats me.”
John looked at the body he was indicating, a girl, maybe sixteen, in the rough center of the arrangement of bodies. He bent down, carefully avoiding dipping the knee of his jeans in the various fluids.
Sherlock arrived back to 221B around 5:30, sun already starting to set with midwinter haste. His breath shortened as he opened the door to the flat. Dust undisturbed, immersion not on, air flat with the stale cold of an empty home. It didn’t take a detective to see that the room hadn’t been used.
The police also found chatroom records between Chris and each of the victims found in the warehouse. Chris had been detailing the conspiracy theories to each person, showing them “proof” of the creatures that were going to take over the world, telling them that they would control the mind of whoever they chose to inhabit and torture them, a fate worse than death.
“I don’t have much interest either way, but for you, I could make an exception.” He turned his head toward John. “You’re just too irresistible.”
“Ooh that must’ve been fun,” Alex said playfully. “Did your little helper figure it out for you again?”
John thought a lot about normal people. He imagined a very normal life where he woke in a normal bed, had breakfast with a normal roommate politely ignoring his presence, went to a normal job where he only called off when he was sick, and then had a normal dinner with a very normal pretty lady who talked about how much she loved normal television.
“No. The solution is very easy, I can’t believe I didn’t see it in the first place. Years ago, really.”
Sherlock sat upright on the couch and looked back at John. “That’s not the conclusion to which I came.”
Speaking of which-- John hurried down the stairs toward the stables. He heard the soft-pat footsteps of the house servant girl who lived in the tower room above his. He’d tried to chat her up, to no avail-- it seemed as though that girl was waiting for some kind of prince to rescue her or something. Wouldn’t catch good John Watson like that; he wanted a partner who was an equal. He worked for no woman.
“No, and that’s actually why I’m asking for a favor,” John continued quickly before Lestrade could reply. “Now, don’t blow your stack here, but I need you to…”
Minutes passed. John’s phone still lay open on the side of the pillow, relentless scrolling in search of distraction discarded for a brief grasp at comfort.
But tonight, he was determined. John mouthed along Sherlock’s pale neck, his hand rubbing sweet friction up his outer thigh.
John, despite his sigh, got out of his chair to get his jacket and wallet. “See, ordering me around like a servant, demanding a feast,” John pulled his jacket off the hook and shrugged it on. “Reclining on your throne all day-- all you’re missing is a--”
“She was trying to get you as a sugar daddy before she saw you head back to the GP area and realized you were poor, too.”
The woman in the silky robe shrugged. Both of them turned back to watch the girl some thirty feet away. She messily rubbed her snot on her torn sleeve.
Chris Atcher was a charming kid. Even in handcuffs, skin and hair greasy with lack of washing, and athletic body destroyed by ten hours of internet browsing a day, he was getting sympathy from the officers arresting him.
“Greg, mate, I’m calling in that favor you promised,” John said. He glanced down both hallways off the living room to double check that Sherlock really wasn’t home.
He wondered if this is how Sherlock felt when he watched everyone else trying to follow his reasoning.
When John came home later that night, Alex was gone and Sherlock was in his bedroom; John could see the light coming out from under his door. He decided to take a shower to calm down a bit after that conversation with Stamford.
John chuckled. “I’m just saying, is all, is that when someone makes someone else feel bad, more often than not, that person gets an urge to prove their worth to the person manipulating them.”
“I just don’t see what was so irritating about what he was saying,” John said, shrugging nonchalantly. John really was a very bad actor, but Sherlock was so worked up that he didn’t appear to notice.
The police had caught him on the train to the chunnel, and arrested him within 24 hours of finding the bodies.
John left the room to go up his stairs, and once the door shut he heard them burst into giggles together. He fought the urge to yank the door back open and demand what had been so funny.
“Well I,” John swallowed, and then realizing that lying was a futile maneuver, said, “Yes, you’re right, I don’t.”
John groaned at the thought. Donovan alone would be an entire days work of rebuilding his self-esteem.
A woman sitting next to him on the bus leans over on his way home to let him know, “I love peeing my pants. I get such enjoyment from it. This driver is being a bit speedy, huh?”
“Mmm, I feel like I could die in your arms anyway,” Sherlock said, reaching a clumsy hand out to John’s bicep. “I’d do anything to be in these strong arms.”
John walked back over to Lestrade, far enough away to be out of earshot among the voices of the forensic team. He lifted his eyebrows to let Lestrade know he was ready to talk.
When he checks out at the store, the cashier cheerfully says, “I have never been in love with my husband. Receipt’s in the bag, have a nice one!”
“Love, please, let me touch you,” John said, biting into the crux of his neck, eliciting a sharp groan. Sherlock reached down and unfastened his trousers with schoolboy eagerness. John let out a chuckle, completely enamored.
John tried not to dwell on what that meant for Sherlock. He didn’t want to be the person who displayed every facet of themselves for the general public, the one who never kept any thought to themselves. After knowing Sherlock for only a week, it became obvious that he hid nothing because he was absolutely desperate for approval.
“Real quickly, you do know that the Lestrade thing was three days ago, and not this morning, right?”
Sherlock and John both froze. John looked to Sherlock at his side, and then across the table at Alex. They were in a staring match. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock looked at John like he was dumb. “Why would I need a coat when my own body is--” he cut off suddenly, reaching out to grip the doorjamb. John rushed over to quickly support him.
“Should we have sex with Sherlock? Sherlock, long legs, sweet ass, mouth-like-a-sex-doll Sherlock? That’s up for debate?”
John was on his lunch break when he received a call from Lestrade. “Mate, I’m so sorry to bother you at work, but do you know where Sherlock is?”
John caught Sherlock’s eye, silently asking if he wanted to take over the phone call. He shook his head no, ducking his gaze down to his phone. “Yeah, no, well,” John said awkwardly. “We are doing… work, so if you just wanted to-- actually, he’ll call you when he’s finished.”
Notably, a woman in Bart’s had told him, “I’m going to kill myself tonight.” She was a nurse, a nice one, who smiled at every patient and scurried around filing reports at top speed.
John put his phone back in his pocket, shaking his head at Alex’s short tone. “He’s angry with you, Sherlock.”
But he never knew what to do. It’s not like he was handed this gift (or curse) with instructions. The general rule for him was to ignore the secrets he was told unless there was some way he could help directly. He couldn’t report any incriminating secrets without any evidence.
John moved on down the hallway, quite proud of himself thus far. He inspected each photo on the wall. A family portrait on a family trip to America, Alison appearing maybe ten. An engagement photo of the parents. A baby photo. John stopped at a picture that was set below eye level, the place that people put photos they didn’t particularly like; a friend’s baby or a dog that passed away.
John sat and listened to him, and then, like every other time, he got out only to brush his teeth, and then came back to bed. Sherlock held him, and John shuddered occasionally with a new thought and a new wave of despair, and Sherlock held him.
“Oh, fuck, John,” Sherlock breathed, and John smiled until his shoulder, because he thought he’d never tire of hearing that noise in his life.
But John noticed he brought his hand up to touch the spot beneath his ear subconsciously. For all the Sherlock said he didn’t observe, John noted this for future investigation.
“Okay, sounds great, but consider this,” the first debater retorted, mouth full of donut. “We could fuck him now. Like, right now.”
John did not believe a word of it. People were people, people in fancy clothes were royals, people in common clothes were commoners. Nobody looked different just because they had money, except for maybe that family in France that John had heard about that all looked like bulldogs from too much inbreeding.
John smirked, and edited the answer on the computer screen to move the answer up one space. He hit enter.
A knife of uncertainty twisted in John’s stomach. “Well. Yes, but I admit I’m not-- entirely unbiased on the subject.”
“Surprisingly, this is one area in which you are exceedingly—Oh, fuck!” Sherlock’s rare compliment was cut off as John’s mouth closed around the head of his cock. John would’ve smiled with vindication, but his mouth was rather occupied.
He nodded, glancing between the man smiling innocently up at John from his chair and the strangely focused Sherlock. “Well. I’ll just. Go make some tea.”
“At any rate,” the more rational half digressed, “we have to deal with this. How are we going to tell him?”
“I’ll stop when you leave your ivory castle and go down to the clinic like the rest of us peasants.”
“Yeah, I know, but you are going to help me because you are actually my friend,” John said placatingly.
Sherlock snorted, following John through the bar to collect their coats. “It wasn’t even. I know the game he’s talking about, it was a fundraiser but the charity is well known for giving their ceos six figure salaries out of the donations.”
Another clumsy, convulsive wink. John was over the discomfort now, overwhelmed by the hysteria of the situation. He was just along for the ride now.
And think Sherlock did. For three days, Sherlock was laying on the couch staring at the ceiling when John came down in the morning, and was in the same position when he went to bed at night. John assumed he went to the bathroom while John was asleep or something.
An idea, a brilliant, brilliant idea, occurred to John. He scrambled out of the shower and yanked open the linen closet, rifling through the back area behind the towels. He’d hidden it there, where Sherlock never looked since Sherlock never replaced the towels and always took the one on the bar.
Sherlock smiled at his back as John turned to lead him into the bedroom, knowing he’d follow this man anywhere, because no one had ever loved him as he does. And what a strange, wonderful pain to be so loved and accepted. What sweet torture.
But Sherlock was there. Sherlock was sprawled out on the sofa, long limbs draped over the back and armrests like a big pale octopus, thin hands shifting a newspaper down so he could see the doorway.
“I asked Sherlock to make sure my husband died,” Mrs. Hudson smiled at him. “If you’ll be needing two bedrooms.”
John used his hand to take what his mouth couldn’t. He carefully covered his teeth with his lips and applied pressure along his shaft. He felt the side of his hand hitting Sherlock’s flies on every stroke, and he was quickly tiring of not being able to touch Sherlock’s skin through his trouser legs.
John’s neck quickly tired of the angle bent over his own legs on the couch, and since he was a very practical man, he moved to his knees in front of Sherlock on the couch. Sherlock was meanwhile gasping in rare brainless ecstasy, his back arched from pressing his head into the sofa. “John, John, John,” he babbled.
Sherlock shrugged. “He said it was for the best that I did. Since it wasn’t likely I was going to change.”
“Yes, I am, who are you? Who are these men?” the teacher gestured to Alex and John like they were Sherlock’s hired muscle.
He stubbed his toe on the staircase as he trudged up, feeling exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with his actual energy and everything to do with feeling utterly put-upon by the entire world.
John smirked, slowly setting his tea down on the table. He adjusted himself on the sofa so he could properly look up at Sherlock, making sure he had his eye contact and total focus, and nodded. “Yes please.” He said politely.
“I see you finally used your backup,” Alex said. His smile looked rather more like just showing teeth at this point.
The closer he grew to the royal castle, the deeper the anger in his gut burned. He observed the spiraling towers breaking through the evening clouds, the expensive tarrow-candle light burning brightly from every window, and the carriages lining up in front of the giant entranceway painstakingly carved with cherubs and felt bitterness. He took a deep breath to calm himself. Life wasn’t fair. Some people had castles. John had a bed stuffed with the hair from the horses he brushed. That was just the way things were.
John looked up at Sherlock in awe. “You know, I--” John frowned, following Sherlock to the curb as he hailed a cab. “I love when you say things.”
Sherlock lifted his hips again, helping John take them off, and John took him back in his mouth, now holding his balls and brushing his fingertips against his perineum. “John,” Sherlock groaned, voice rumbling with intense pleasure.
“Oh, they’re all lined up for Mycroft,” Sherlock gently maneuvered John around and pointed out a tall man with a hooked nose surrounded by bored looking gentlewomen. “He’s the one that looks like a fat penguin.”
John nodded, and then nodded again when his brain connected “Alex” with “professor Cameron from that case that one time”.
He stilled to listen in the silence. The MacFucker was leaving, and Sherlock was quietly shutting the door on his back.
“You should be able to take him home in about a half hour. We just want to make sure his temperature goes down first.” John nodded, and the doctor left and closed the door.
Sherlock’s head snapped toward him. He smiled at John. “Yes. Yes it is.” John smiled back, electricity crackling down his spine with the pride in Sherlock’s eyes.
On his computer they’d found thousands of visits logged on the dark web, pictures of photoshopped creatures and pseudo-fascist promotional images. There was an amazon order for cleaning materials, as John had suspected, but also a bulk sized bottle of sleeping pills. He was a regular visitor of anonymous websites, contributing to message boards about radicalized conspiracy theories, and groups for discussing humanity’s downfall.
John couldn’t help it. He giggled. “Oh I really cannot wait to tell--” He stopped. Sharing this with Greg didn’t seem appropriate now, actually.
Sherlock looked through the financial files while John chatted with Wilkney. That seemed to be his job, most of the time; distract the normal people so that Sherlock could get at the important information. He rather suspected that Sherlock didn’t like being observed as he worked, since he looked so silly contorting himself all over to observe tiny details, and John was happy to draw the gaze away.
“Have you seen it? It’s huge, it’s perfect, he’ll be salivating the second we get it out of our pants.”
“Sherlock, what a surprise to see you here!” Alex exclaimed, shaking his hand with rather more warmness than was called for in the situation. “And the good doctor Watson.”
Sherlock’s phone cut off, and then started ringing again. Donovan and Anderson, along with the photographer and a few other staff followed up the stairs and started collecting evidence. There wasn’t much, but they scraped the dust off the floor and took pictures, grasping at straws.
The prince smiled at him. John’s stomach dropped out through his feet. The way his hands were shaking now, his heart pounding against his ribs, made John feel a way that no woman he’d ever met could cause.
John doesn’t like to advertise the fact, but he tends to talk to himself. Not aloud or anything, but inside his head, two miniature versions of himself (the crank being operated by the third) debated back and forth like sports gambits near constantly.
Doctor Robinson laughed. “Oh, that’s the perfect title for him. You should’ve seen him trying to glare at the tongue depressor in his own mouth.”
Sherlock neatly flipped the photo in his fingers to reveal John’s neat handwriting on the back that indicated the members of the photo.
“I like him less the more you tell me, but I’m telling you the truth here. You should never have to change to be loved. You shouldn't change. The people you know, me, Lestrade, Molly, Mrs.Hudson, we all like you exactly the way you are. Yes, you make mistakes, and yes, you do things we don’t always understand or like, but we like the person who does them.”
“Companion! You make it sound like you’re the Doctor,” John waved a hand in dismissal upon Sherlock’s baffled face. “Who was Billy?”
Sherlock shrugged, crossing his legs and looking away from John toward the window before answering in an airy tone, “Oh yes, Alex always wears a condom.”
“This doesn’t normally happen to me,” John confessed. He hated to lie, but he couldn’t see another way to help her. “What do you do when you feel depressed?”
The images were disturbing, but not as bad as the crime that he’d committed in convincing all of those people to join him in the abandoned outskirt and drink poison.
Rather than let loose a scathing remark to Alex, however, Sherlock looked down at John fondly. Despite himself, John smiled back at him. “As it happens, I cannot solve any case without John.”
And that’s how John ended up waiting in the clinic plastic chairs will Sherlock walked to an examination room, wearing only his pajamas and his long coat over. He really did look like a child.
“Listen, we really only have one chance here. If we want Sherlock, all of him, the relationship part, we need to take things slowly. Take Sherlock to the movies, romance him, a gentle kiss on the stairs, a nice snog on the couch, and then maybe, a few weeks from now, we’ll be able to slide home in that glorious ass and be together forever.”
“Right, uh, hi,” John said, extending a hand to the stranger. He looked familiar, but he couldn’t place him.
They were through that sweet, nervous period that John would reluctantly admit he loved. The tentative touches, the kiss-and-check, pulling back to make sure that was okay and okay? Yeah, yes, good, John. Sometimes John thought about Sherlock excitedly realizing he could just wrap his arms around John and John would stand there and happily be held and smiled to himself.
Sherlock rolled his eyes while pulling off a wet sock from the corpse laying on top of the electric box. “I suppose I should silence my phone more often.”
“Sherlock, John, we need you immediately. Mass murder.” Lestrade bent over in the door frame, catching his breath from running up the stairs. “Did you really not hear me coming up?”
“It’d have to be a perfect storm for this to work out. You’d have to admit you might not be entirely straight, he’d have to break up with a man he seems perfectly happy with, AND he’d have to be attracted to you in turn. What are the chances?”
John looked thoroughly confused now, and Sherlock sighed with the knowledge of imminent loss of sexual contact. He lifted his hips and slid his trousers off entirely. How he kept trousers that tight and managed to get them off that quickly, John would never know.
He looked at the homework, and then at the screen. He tilted his head, and then held the paper up next to the screen.
Sherlock left for the lab around half seven. John was still in bed. Sherlock pulled on his gloves, signature coat already on his shoulders, and pushed the door open to look in their bedroom. He was surprised to find that John hadn’t gotten up yet, and was still just a soft ruffle of hair sticking up from their thick winter comforter. Sherlock smiled and carefully shut the door without waking him.
John watched as Sherlock said every single that crossed his mind without regard for the person receiving the information. And how he turned to John, waiting for a compliment. Sherlock was the ultimate exhibitionist.
He turns on Baker Street and a dog walker says “I contemplate murder on such a regular basis that I’m afraid I’ll eventually commit one. Lovely day, isn’t it?”
“Whatever. We don’t need flashy looks. He’s our best friend. He loves us, too. Otherwise he wouldn’t live with us, like Mike said.”
John received lots of messages about cases, but they were usually sent to the blog. This one came to his personal email, which was unusual. It took a moment of searching his brain to remember who doctor Wilkney was, but once John remembered, he politely asked Sherlock to take the case on so he could solve it for his friend.
It was Friday and John was ready to get sloshed. He wanted to manually reset his hard drive. He wanted his crank turning man to be knocked off his ass.
Well. Good. John laid back down. He made the executive decision in his brain to not look too closely at the feelings that had brought up.
Sherlock looked at him, waiting for the rest of the sentence. John was going to mention that they’d barely spent any time together in the last month before realizing he sounded like a clingy girlfriend.
“I worry I’ll never have a normal family,” the grizzly detective inspector said to John, and then to Sherlock, “Who’s this?”
John blinked. In high school, John had a distinct memory of a teacher trying over and over and over again to explain a mathematical concept to him. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t ever remember the formula because he had no idea what any of the steps did. He pushed at it for weeks before the teacher finally sent him to the tutor. The tutor explained it again, this time as a metaphor with little doors and hidden numbers behind them. John remembered this because the breakthrough moment, the click as the knowledge finally slotted in his brain and he understood it, had felt so good. Like coming to the surface to breathe in after floating underwater for a long time.
“Sherlock, what are you-- you’re in your pajamas! You can’t just go out like that, you need a coat.”
Sherlock glanced over at Alex, and when they made eye contact, a light blush crept up Sherlock’s neck. “I retrieved it from the trash can.”
John, by the time he’s invalided from the army, has grown used to this. For a while, in his teens, when he realized that what he was learning wasn’t normal, he wrestled with the concept. He wondered if it was an assignment from a higher power, that he was supposed to do something with all of these people’s closet skeletons.
“Greg, hello,” John said amicably, stepping over to be almost shoulder to shoulder to the detective inspector.
He obediently followed Sherlock to the body he was bent over. “Must be a poison. Based on the vomit and amount of blood in the uh, fecal matter, I’d say something homemade. Cleaning chemicals, seems most likely.”
John’s little man briefly left his place at the crank to slide Macfucker’s name further up the shitlist scoreboard.
Sherlock, feeling a turning in his stomach beyond hunger pangs, gathered up his samples. He forced himself not to walk hurriedly returning them to Bart’s, and spoke slower than his usual breakneck pace to place his order at their usual chinese.
The second debater acquiesced. “Yup, yeah. Very good point there. Alright, send the signal up to head office.”
The second floor didn’t hold more bodies, but it did have more writing. ‘They’re going to get you too’, ‘be more careful’, ‘they can find you’.
John’s shoulders suddenly felt the weight of being so outside of everything these people were. He hadn’t taken dancing lessons. He didn’t even own the suit he was wearing; it’d be back to his sturdy stableboy clothes at midnight. He spotted an open door to a side room, and he eagerly stepped through it.
John nodded. “I think heroin and cocaine, yeah,” and then remembering that with the recent news, Sherlock was still a public figure. “When he was younger, not recently.”
Sherlock full on grinned now, cotton showing through his lips. “Oh, I don’t know if I’m a princess,” He paused for what John assumed was dramatic effect. “Queen, yes.”
“Thank you, John, that truly means very much to me,” Sherlock said stiffly, as if he wasn’t used to being told things like that. “I suppose it could be boiled down to the fact that Alex wants me to be a bit more… to follow the rules more, I… I guess that’s a way to say it.”
John gently guided him over to a plastic chair. He turned back to the doctor. “Hi, Doctor Watson, I actually work down in,” he gestured toward the general practice area.
John sighed heavily. He did have to come to terms with that. If he went through with this, if he really dated Sherlock, he would be in a relationship with a man. He’d fooled around with men before, sure, he did go to university, but he hadn’t ever actually had any sort of future with a man. Long nights together on the couch, going out to eat together, doing their favorite things in tandem.
He was led back to a small recovery room where Sherlock was reclining in a hospital bed. His eyes were closed, but he didn’t appear to be asleep.
The cab pulled up and Sherlock gratefully rushed out. John let him go, but committed that to memory to grill him later. Now that John was safely out of the firing range for being called homophobic, he loved to tease Sherlock about his “type”.
“No, Sherlock, you won’t. I won’t let you, actually.” Sherlock whipped his head to stare at John, body slowly turning to follow.
This time John couldn’t contain his snicker. This was why Sherlock had said him to watch, because he already knew he would take his revenge against those two arseholes. John couldn’t help but admire his class: he had delivered a killing blow without uttering a single curse or insult.
Perhaps it had not been a good idea to engage in that act that very night; he could almost see how Janine and her prostitutes would laugh at him if they saw him now…
“John,” he whispered, cupping the other man’s cheek with his palm. “I do love you.” He watched as John’s eyes widened and his expression filled with joy. “I started loving you very early in our living together, when I saw how good it was spending time with you and coming home to a flat filled with your presence.”
It was 4.00AM, almost four hours after their confrontation with Moriarty at the pool, and Sherlock’s body was still thrumming with adrenaline. He was restless and pacing back and forth the sitting room as his mind replayed the night’s events.
If it was someone else, a man met at the pub or even someone he knew better, such as Mike, he would bit the bullet and make a pass at them, just to see what would happen next. But it was Sherlock. John’s best friend. The man who had rescued him from an empty, lonely existence and given him a new life full of excitement, intrigue and, most importantly, companionship. John didn’t want to jeopardize it because he had suddenly become bi-curious.
“Because you needed it. Because I’ve been wanting to do it for a long time. Because I love you and wanted to make you feel good.”
Mycroft had never thought he would ever have to deal with the Royal Harem, and when Lady Smallwood and Sir Erwin had suggested a Personal Companion as reward for Sherlock he had thought it to be a barbaric idea. However, after he had time to think and a chance to examine the possible candidates, he had begun to think, why not? Perhaps a Personal Companion was exactly what his brother needed.
Mycroft shook his head. “It wasn’t. Father’s death caused a radical change in Sherlock. He thought it was his fault if Father had died. He closed up, became more solitary and rebellious, prone to temper tantrums. He started to antagonize me in every way, resentful of my being human. Mummy didn’t help the situation as she became…well, there is no other way to put it…afraid of Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned to look at him. “It was about what Molly said about the homeless man found dead with a wound similar to Majors’. I want to know more about it and to see if there have been other attacks against the homeless.”
John had to bite his cheek to avoid bursting in laughter as he saw Anderson and Donovan blush and look at everywhere but each other.
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand and murmured. “Loving me…it could be dangerous. The only time I tried having a relationship it ended in a disaster.”
Long, warm showers or baths helped him to relax his back muscles, always a bit strained by the effort of carrying and balancing his horns.
Sherlock continued to watch as John shifted in his sleep. He shouldn’t care so much for the result of some misspoken words—but he did. He didn’t like to know he had hurt John, even if his careless words had been uttered during the worst meltdown he had had since he was a child. He didn’t like when John was upset or angry with him…he didn’t like it at all. Even if, to be totally sincere, his words to John had been the truth. He had no friends because John was not a friend…he was more. He was his conductor of light, the reason Sherlock worked better when he was near. He was also more patient and more mindful of other people’s feelings. In short John was his conscience...the better part of himself.
Not only he was almost as smart as Mycroft – and that alone would have been enough to set him apart from the rest of the population, as he knew very well – but he also had physical characteristics that made it impossible for him to blend in.
Sherlock did so and felt John’s hand touch his naked back. So his coat, jacket and shirt had been burnt by the blast...
“You know I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper,” she gently chided him, but Sherlock ignored her.
John had collapsed on the toilet seat, assaulted by the thought Sherlock might have orchestrated his suicide to disappear and start a new life somewhere else, away from his tarnished reputation and a bondmate he had never wanted but had been saddled with. However, he had shaken away that idea very soon.
“Let it go, Sherlock,” John whispered. “Do it. I’m not afraid. I trust you.” He put all of his belief in his voice and expression, hoping Sherlock would see and feel how sure he was.
John toed off his shoes and stretched near beside, catching his Alpha’s lips in a kiss. He bit gently at Sherlock’s bottom lip, then slid out his tongue to press its tip against the lips, asking for entrance. Sherlock opened his mouth and John eagerly explored it, coaxing his Alpha’s tongue into copying his movements.
What the hell was he doing? Molesting his friend as he slept? John blushed to the root of his hair as he realized he was hard. His shame was overwhelming. God, he really had to get a grip on himself. What would happen if Sherlock awoke? Those keen eyes saw everything, noticed everything and how could John justify sporting a hard-on while looking at his half naked flatmate?
Finally – John couldn’t say how much time had passed or where they were – the car pulled up in front big, well kept white and black house. Anthea led John inside and then along a corridor, coming to a halt in front of a closed door.
Maybe, just maybe John should really tell Sherlock how he felt. Even if it most certainly wouldn’t end as he hoped, there was a good chance their friendship wouldn’t turn too awkward. Sherlock would probably dismiss the whole matter as useless “sentiment”, not mention it again, and would continue to treat John as nothing had happened.
John’s musings were interrupted when Sherlock suddenly ordered the taxi to pull over. He frowned as his friend opened the door even before the care came to a full stop, and walked quickly along the sidewalk, until he reached a young beggar asking for money near a corner.
His Ibex side rose in him, the instinct of the dominant male, his duty to protect the members of his herd from predators. Sherlock lowered his head, aiming his horns at Moriarty’s chest and was about to give a mighty push when he saw a red laser dot on John’s forehead...and another one on his own white shirt.
For a few days after the embarrassing incident in the shower, things had been strained between them, but gradually Sherlock had relaxed and stopped fearing John would try to seduce him at every turn.
He pushed the thought away. It was useless to speculate on what he couldn’t know. He had to focus on Sherlock.
“Let me show you, then. I promise you will like it.” John lowered himself again, half on the bed, half on Sherlock, as he made sure to avoid the other man’s erection.
“Good,” Sherlock flashed a quick grin. “Your bedroom is up those stairs,” he gestured with a hand. “Oh, don’t look at me like that. Your limp is psychosomatic and you might be able to get rid of it soon.”
“I was on the frontlines in Afghanistan for one year. I helped in the camp hospital, so yes, I’ve seen some of them.”
Well, the starting point was his bond with Sherlock Holmes. The younger man had been a constant source of surprises since they had met. Some were nice, such as the discovery of what he did for a living, other weren’t so nice, and such as learning he had been a drug addict in the past. And then, of course, there were the various body parts stashed in the fridge or in other unlikely locations.
It had been after their encounter with Moriarty, the night John had been willing to give his life for Sherlock, not because he was loyal to his master, but because he was in love with the other man.
He shivered as his mind recalled the image of Sherlock almost bleeding to death on the carpet, so John rushed to replace that memory with another one from the same night: the first time he and Sherlock had made love.
Sherlock slammed his hands against the wall in frustration. Instead of relaxing he was getting even more tense and sore, so much he had troubles in keeping his head high.
The criminal took it, and exclaimed. “Boring! I could have got them anywhere.” He turned slightly to throw the memory stick in the water and John took the opportunity to wrap an arm around his neck and use Moriarty as a shield.
“John…you should find someone else to love. As you have just seen…I’m not even able to give pleasure to myself. How could I ever satisfy you?”
Sherlock shook his head. “That’s your training talking, John. You have been indoctrinated to put your master’s needs and desires above your own, but it’s no longer necessary, not with me. As I said, I’ve no need or desire for a Personal Companion.”
Sherlock ignored him and stepped beneath the yellow tape John kept raised for him. They walked away in silence until his master said, “Good shot.”
John’s breath caught when he realized, with a mix of surprise, satisfaction and relief, that it hadn’t changed.
His epiphany had made more difficult for him to cope with what had happened next: Adler’s “resurrection” and her presence in their flat. Watching her flirt with Sherlock, seeing him respond to her, listening to her sexual innuendos was a torture. A part of John had wanted to stand up and tell her to keep her hands away from his bondmate, that Sherlock was his and only his. But he had restrained himself: Sherlock and he were bondmates in name only. His Alpha had made it clear from the start and would probably resent John if he made his jealousy known.
However, as soon as the call had ended, he threw himself on the couch, took his thinking pose with his hands steepled under his chin and closed his eyes. He didn’t say a single word until late afternoon, when he asked John to prepare some tea.
John’s thoughts turned toward his future mate. He wondered what he did for a living and why he wasn’t interested in breeding. Usually young Alphas wanted litters of babies; it was more common for older Alphas, those who already had heirs and didn’t want more, to bond with Neutered Omegas.
Sherlock walked into his bedroom and closed the door. He dropped his duffel bag near the wall and shrugged off his coat, folding it on a chair. Since he had showered that morning in the hotel in Georgia, he just carried out his nightly routine in the bathroom, and returned to his room, slipping between the fresh smelling sheets.
“There are no ‘wannabes’ here,” Sherlock almost snarled as he slammed the door shut. “I wish they were, but this is the real thing.”
Smart, funny, caring, he treated John as an equal, never mentioning his status as a Personal Companion, both in public and in private.
“-in exchange for what?” John interrupted him. He wasn’t interested in the money, but knowing what the voice wanted him to do would help him to assess how much of a threat this person was to Sherlock.
“As my plan to lure the killer out wasn’t working, I decided to force his hands. With my network’s help, I spread word in the homeless community to always stay in groups during the night. I told them to report me if the saw an unknown individual wander around the shelters or try to get some of them go with him with some excuse. This evening I got word such an individual had been spotted near Embankment tube station. So I went there, and stumbled drunkenly along the embankment. My mark didn’t realize I was a vampire as the alcohol I had poured on my clothes disguised my scent, and he attacked me as I had hoped he would do. We fought and I won…but it was a close call.”
Everything had seemed to go well between them, and Janine had never hinted he was doing anything wrong until the day he had rushed to her flat to hand her his heart forever only to have it broken into many tiny pieces.
Molly made a helpless gesture with her hands, “I don’t know. I can only tell you last week I examined the body of a homeless man found dead near Delancey Street. He sported a similar kind of wound, but the Met didn’t tell me to proceed with an autopsy as they ruled out the murder as the result of a fight between homeless people.”
Scientists had always claimed that was the origin on the vampire legends—and why should they have thought differently? If the vampires’ real existence was still unknown in 2013, it meant they were very good at covering their tracks and protecting their secret.
Sherlock and John had a long talk with Lestrade, giving their statements about what had happened, as Moriarty’s body was recovered from the debris and taken away. Of his six snipers, two were found dead and the other four were just wounded. They were all wanted by the police for other crimes and they were all willing to talk about Moriarty’s activities in exchange of a reduction of sentence.
John raised his fists to hit his attacker when a familiar voice said, “That was quite sloppy of you, John.”
For the first time since he had discovered Janine in the prostitutes’ arms, Sherlock felt hope stir in him. Hope that he could find someone who would love him as unconditionally as he had loved Victor, Irene and Janine …and loved John.
John nodded, then decided to make a last attempt at being accepted as more than a person Sherlock was reluctantly going to share rooms with. He leant forward and put a hand on the other man’s knee.
Sherlock cleared his throat and began, “About what happened earlier tonight…It was something I've not experienced before.”
However, all of his strength left him as soon as the stepped in the living room. His knees buckled and only John’s arms prevented him from falling face first on the floor. As it was, John lowered him gently on the carpet, made him comfortable and said softly, “Keep pressing on the wound. I’m calling an ambulance.”
John had felt beyond relieved when Adler had disappeared once for all from their lives, without Sherlock showing signs of missing her, although it was difficult to say for sure if it was really so.
380 days—that was how long it had lasted. A little more than a year without being bound to an Alpha he didn’t love and considered him just a possession. One year being able to do what he pleased every time he wanted to for the first time since he completed university—and now it was going to end.
And sometimes, when John was totally honest with himself – as it was happening more frequently in the past months – he liked to imagine what would be like to have those long, nimble fingers explore his body, what it would be like to be the focus of that single-minded concentration and to feel those full lips against his own…
From that moment on, things had just gone better and better. First the delightful puzzle of how the killer made his victims take the poison. Then the realization of the killer’s mistake, followed by the search and recovery of the pink case. Later on, the exhilarating chase of the taxi, with John always at his heels as they run up and down buildings...Sherlock grinned around his fork as he remembered how John had reacted when he had told him he habitually pick-pocketed Lestrade when the DI was annoying. He had expected a reproachful scowl, and instead got a laughter. Then it had been his turn to smile when, back in Baker Street, John had realized he had left his cane at Angelo’s.
John knew better than ask where they were going. Besides, he was too busy wondering about the reason of this summon. His emotions were raging from the elation of thinking Sherlock was finally back, to the despair caused by the thought Mycroft had called him to give him bad news. John appealed to his ER medical training and military experience to stay calm and not panic.
John’s expression clearly showed how little he cared about finding an answer to that question. “Yes. Yeah, right, good. So you've got something to go on, then. Good luck with that. Now, let me sleep.”
John tugged on Sherlock’s hand and murmured. “Now lay down and let me teach you how to make love...do you want it?”
John laughed aloud and then walked to one of the armchairs near the fire place and sat down. His muscles still ached because of all…the exercise… he got the previous two days. He also hoped Sherlock would take the hint and sat down too, so they could have a proper talk as bond-mates.
As John had felt from the first moment he had met his new master, falling in love with Sherlock Holmes had been easy—and how could it have been any different given the sort of man he was?
Sherlock Holmes, the world’s only consulting detective was lying on a couch too short for him, staring at the ceiling of his room in the London Breeding House. A room with a door locked from outside, bars at the window and furniture bolted to the floor. A cell for all intents and purposes, in which he had been closed for the previous five days.
“John…” Sherlock, eyes closed as his hand crunched at the sheets, as if he was trying to restrain himself.
John sighed as he walked into the kitchen to switch off the oven. There was no reason to keep the onion soup warm, since Sherlock wouldn’t be there to eat it and John had lost all of his appetite.
“Wake up John,” he said aloud, shaking harder when the other man didn’t wake but cried again, uttering a series of “no, no, no”. Sherlock bent over John, took hold of both his shoulders and shook him again as he ordered, “Wake up, Captain Watson!”
Far less awesome was to be kidnapped and taken in a deserted warehouse, where a disembodied voice coming from the shadows, a voice belonging to someone able to control CCTV cameras interrogated him.
The sight stirred something inside Sherlock, a desire to protect, which was ridiculous as John was more than capable of protecting himself. Yet…yet John had been hurt earlier than night—by Sherlock himself.
“It was your deodorant,” Sherlock answered simply, throwing a quick glance to John, who was following the scene with great interest.
“I don’t like to repeat myself. This is how the situation is—and it won’t change. And now, would you please let go of my knee? I have to check my mould culture.”
It was another ordinary morning- or at least what passed for ordinary in Baker Street 221B. John was sitting on the couch, reading the newspapers and looking for interesting cases while Sherlock was in the kitchen, working on some of his never-ending series of experiments.
They walked until they reached a room at the opposite end of the corridor. Once there, the manager unlocked a door and opened it, as the two orderlies moved closer to Sherlock.
They stayed like that for several minutes, just hugging and breathing each other’s scent. A part of John was surprised to see Sherlock behave so emotionally, but God only knew what had happened to his Alpha during the past two years, and how alone he must had been since all the people he cared for thought him death.
Every time John had seen it, he had thanked the car crash he had been involved in when he was fourteen, and the injuries that had led to his O-gland removal. Because even during his bonded years with Coleman he had remained his own man, with his own mind and spirit—and that would never change, no matter who his new mate would turn to be.
Sherlock pulled his head away with a groan, his lips red and swollen and his cheeked flushed. “Take them off,” he ordered gesturing at John’s clothes.
The Alpha opened the door and picked up John’s suitcase, preceding him inside the narrow hall. John followed him carrying the duffel bag and looked around. A door opened from the back of the hall and an elderly woman appeared.
Sherlock had never thought much about death. Obviously he didn’t want to die, but it had never stopped him from taking risks for the thrill of the game. However that night, he was not the only one facing death. John too had risked losing his life and it didn’t sit well with Sherlock. Wasn’t an Alpha’s duty to protect their Omega? Instead it had been John who had tried to protect him, restraining Moriarty as he told Sherlock to leave.
When Sherlock recovered his wits, he found John sprawled atop of him, his sweaty face hovering over his own as he looked at him anxiously.
“No,” John shook his head, as his left hand wrapped around Sherlock’s cold one. “It’s not too late. Tell me. Tell me now.”
It was created when one of the first UK ambassadors to Japan returned from his assignment believing his country needed an institution like the Japanese Geishas.
“Are you telling us he was bitten by a vampire?!” Donovan exclaimed. Sherlock scoffed and the sergeant corrected her words, “I mean, someone believing to be a vampire?”
John had lost almost all hope of getting a permanent master. He had been examined by potential masters several times, but no one had chosen him. He had been resigned to spend the rest of his working life being moved from a temporary master to another, until his retirement at age 65, when he would return to the Residence to spend there the rest of his life.
His back hurt like hell, and not just because of the blast which had burned his clothes and scorched his fur, but also because of all the tension accumulated during the case.
When it finally happened, a few minutes later, John could see that Sherlock’s eyelids were drooping as he struggled to stay awake. He caressed his Alpha’s cheek and whispered, “Go to sleep, Sherlock. I’ll be here when you wake up, and then we will talk again and start planning for your return among the living.”
“I suppose you have questions too, John. Feel free to ask everything you want pertaining Sherlock’s nature and what happened this night,” he older man said with a kind smile.
That same evening John was in his bedroom, engrossed in a book. He had retired at his usual time, but since sleep failed to come, he had picked up a mystery novel Sarah had lent him. The story had proved to be more engaging than he thought and instead of making him sleepy – as reading in bed usually did – he had made him even more awake.
Sherlock kissed John again, then proceed to touch and caress him everywhere, his hands gentle yet possessive. He was much more confident of his skills as a lover now. He could see with his own eyes how much his touch excited John.
John had soon become Sherlock’s housekeeper, keeping the flat clean, buying food, doing the laundry, and making sure there was a tea ready when his Master woke up. He was there when Sherlock needed a sounding board and made himself scarce when he needed quiet. John never considered any of these as tasks he had to do; they were all things he wanted to do and so did.
when Sherlock met her and they hit it off from the get go. It wasn’t love at first sight, Sherlock had been hardened by his previous experience, but he was fascinated by her – and she by him – from the start. She, like you, me, Mrs. Hudson and Greg was able to see the man beneath his physical looks. She saw how wonderful his skills as detective were and started a blog about his cases, giving popularity to Sherlock and helping him to build his reputation as problem-solver. In due time, their mutual attraction turned to love and they became a couple. They were together for three years before...” Molly’s voice trailed off as she closed her eyes.
Sherlock shook his head. “No need to apologize. I wasn’t sleeping. Too busy thinking about what happened with Moriarty.”
John had been shocked. Why hadn’t he noticed it sooner? Was it because he had never been in love before? Was it why he hadn’t been very disappointed when Sarah had broken up with him? The reason he hadn’t looked for other women to date?
Sherlock was still the Sherlock he had always trusted: genius, self-proclaimed sociopath and the best man John had ever met.
“John,” came the almost breathless answer, as the blond man writhed again, probably trying to find some relief by rubbing his erection against the bed.
Sherlock shrugged. “You could create another category: cases solved but still open, and write what happened during Anthony Major’s case, leaving out some details…obviously.”
"So," he finally said, looking down at the document still on his brother’s desk, "When I will meet this John Watson?”
"I like you like this," he murmured, his gaze intent. "It's what you really are, Sherlock, and I feel privileged you allow me to see it."
Sherlock’s cock swelled even more and hardened under John’s hungry stare and he too moaned with pleasure, as his own shaft twitched in response.
Mrs. Hudson chose that moment to enter the flat carrying a newspaper. “What about these suicides, then, Sherlock?” She asked. “I thought that'd be right up your street. Three exactly the same.”
On the other side, he too had almost reached the end of his endurance. He was copiously leaking from both his cock and opening and he ached to feel Sherlock inside him.
“You need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case.”
John put on his dark jacket and left the flat. Once in the street he didn’t walk to the pub, but entered inside “Speedy’s” to buy a strong, hot coffee. He then crossed the street and hid behind a parked van, from where he had a good visual of 221B door. To avoid the suspicion of the passerby, he often looked at his watch and paced back and forth, to give the impression he was waiting for someone. It wasn’t far from the truth, as he was waiting for Sherlock to come out so he could follow him. He was not sure his friend would go out this night too, but he was hopeful and willing to wait for a long time if necessary.
It did not take long for the Alpha’s breath to become laboured, so John stopped his ministrations. He could not risk Sherlock losing control when they had barely started.
John first applied the cream to all his burns, then he poured the relaxant in the middle of his shoulders and began to work on them. At first the massage was everything but pleasurable, and Sherlock grunted or moaned every time John pressed or kneaded a muscle. Then gradually, the pain began to disappear and the touch became pleasurable. Sherlock relaxed, and his mind began to wander, thoughts crossing his mind and disappearing before he could examine them in depth. Keeping his eyes open became an ever increasingly hard struggle, until in the end he surrendered and fell asleep.
“He had just attended the stag night with some co-workers. They confirmed he drank a lot,” Lestrade commented. “He worked for a consulting firm in the City. We are going back to ask more questions. Sherlock, do you want to come with us?”
John would start with the “pink lady” case, then move to the Chinese gang one and by the time he was done with them, he was rather sure something else would already have happened.
Together the two men moved Sherlock to his bedroom and lowered him on the mattress. Mycroft rapidity and efficiency stripped his unconscious brother of his blood-soaked clothes and shoes, leaving him clad only in his boxers briefs and t-shirt. That done, John covered Sherlock with a blanket and checked his pulse and eyes. Satisfied with his findings - his friend was just sleeping – he followed Mycroft into the kitchen
Sherlock had been very clear the only time they had talked about relationships. He was married to his work and not interested. Besides, John had no idea of what his orientation was. Sherlock had said “girlfriends were not his area”, but it didn’t mean boyfriends were. It just meant he wasn’t interested in having a girlfriend, as poor Molly Hooper could attest. In the time they had known each other, John had seen several men try and engage Sherlock in flirting and they had all be sent fleeing by some biting remark.
“Maybe they weren’t able…or interested…to see the real you. It doesn’t really matter now. What matters, what I’m trying to make you understand, is that I love you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, and that all I want from you is to be allowed to take care of you, to make you happy…and I don’t care if it will mean we will live in chastity for the rest of our lives as long as you promise me we will fall asleep in each other arms every night,” John concluded, heart hammering again in his chest as he waited for Sherlock’s response to his declaration.
He tried to push away all thoughts, but instead kept reliving the night events. Kept thinking about how things could have gone, which was irrational, as those events were now in the past and past couldn’t be changed.
She was a dream come true, his perfect match. Determined not to disappoint her between the sheets, Sherlock had done searches, watched instructional videos and even spent time with a prostitute in order to get the knowledge of to how please the woman he loved.
“Sherlock!” she exclaimed happily, embracing the younger man. “You’re finally back! I was so worried.”
There was a sigh, then John scooted over the mattress and raised the covers. “Lay down at least. You’ll be warmer.”
It had been Sherlock’s greatest international success, and he should be proud of how he had solved the case—instead his mind was once again thinking to that long past day.
John nodded and once in the living room he led his guest to the couch. They both sat down and after a moment of silence, he decided it was the time to ask a question about a topic that had bothered him since the beginning of his relationship with Sherlock.
“Sherlock!” he cried out, digging his fingers in his lover’s shoulders as he came. Pleasure washed over him, leaving him dizzy with its intensity.
The room he stepped into was big, luminous and airy. It was a study-library, with floor to ceiling bookshelves, a big wooden table with chairs, two leather armchairs and a couch. It was the latter that caught John’s attention. Or better, the figure curled atop of it.
that somehow evolved differently from the main strain. The real vampires aren’t the creatures portrayed in books and movies. None of that idiotic stuff about garlic, cross, holy water, mirrors and sunlight is true. They are immortal and the only thing that can kill them is another vampire… More importantly,” he continued, looking straight at John, “even if vampires are born predators, we’ve evolved and have learned to control those urges along the centuries and we no longer go around killing people to drink their blood. We eat as humans do and human blood is no longer our only source of substance. We still need it in small doses for our good health, and in greater quantities to stay young, rejuvenate or to heal from serious injuries that otherwise would leave us crippled. But we don’t kill or harm our donors. In my case, I don’t even feed from people, but I drink only from blood bags. However, in some rare instance, vampires become killers, and it’s one of them that murdered Anthony Majors’ and the other four homeless people in this area.”
