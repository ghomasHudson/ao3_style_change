He finds himself face to face with Abel Bryant. Only…not. The man is of the same height and build as their client dressed in the same style, with the same flaming red hair and slight thinning at the crown. But it’s not him.
"Yes. She's utterly charming, reasonably clever, and almost foolishly kind. And that is completely irrelevant to what this is about."
John nods. YOU'VE BEEN ACTUALLY SEEING ME AND HALLUCINATING THAT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE. OR HEAR ANYTHING.
Keeping his eyes closed, as that feels more natural, Sherlock takes himself back from the moment they left the hospital, retracing their journey on the street but this time paying attention to all the cues he’d ignored before. To his surprise, he finds he can draw up a mental picture of the path they took, the streets they’d crossed, even some of the people they’d walked by – a woman in heels pushing an infant in a pram, an Indian businessman on his mobile speaking angrily, a group of school children with two harried teachers and three – no four – parental chaperones on a field trip.
"Wha-- where--? Oh. Sherlock." He flickers from high intensity sparking to low, mellow warmth when he identifies Sherlock beside him. His voice is pure relief. "It worked. Thank God. How did we get down here? Are you okay? Why are you holding me so tight? It hurts. Jesus, everything hurts."
“Trust fund?” John supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Sherlock never seemed to be wanting for cash, despite mostly not getting paid for his work, and it was no secret that the Holmes family was well off.
Sherlock’s not sure which is worse – the verb she used that John never had, had never been allowed to use, or that she used it in the past tense. For the first time, he has real doubts about this plan of his, even though he knows it’s the only way.
Sherlock tenses momentarily, then composes himself enough to turn away from his microscope and regard John coolly. “John, I’m working. And why are you whispering?”
John shakes the thoughts away and tries to focus on the case. What little of it there is. He wracks his brain trying to remember any details from the two times he’d run into Hanna or that Sherlock had shared with him about Les Butineuses, but but everything seems either trivial or connected directly with the counterfeiting case.
John seems to have composed himself, which is more than Sherlock can claim. He had thought blindness alone had made him helpless but that was blissful independence compared to the state in which he now finds himself.
Sherlock doesn't know what he expects. Anger? A punch in the face? Weeping? Kisses? He gets none of these, so he waits, waits for John to decide what to do with him. The silence stretches on too long, dull, heavy, suffocating. At last Sherlock breaks.
“Yes. No. I don’t know.” Sherlock is breathing too fast, unable to put it in to words, nervous that John will end up mad at him again.
, and steam. The north side of the room is entirely taken up by large fume hood that vents outside. There is also a refrigerator and a chest freezer where John’s bed used to be, as well as a steriliser.
want to get a leg over is an improvement on that?" Sherlock is playing dumb now and it's ticking John off more than ever.
As a lover, Sherlock is magnificent, creative, and surprisingly talkative. John is more the quiet type, though hardly passive, but he enjoys Sherlock's stream of consciousness, his unpredictability, when it is on display. Often he takes the scientific approach, such as laying John out in front of the fire, licking a patch of skin and then blowing on it, observing the minute movements of the hairs, the time it takes to pucker into gooseflesh, and comparing the rates on different parts of John, providing a never-ceasing narrative about nerves, follicles, and temperature differentials as he ravishes John from head to toe. Or informing John that he is going to count every freckle on his body and that John is not permitted to move until he is finished.
John's hands are suddenly on his waist, pulling Sherlock up into the chair with him, Sherlock's legs having just enough room to settle around John’s thighs as the shorter man buries his face in the hollow of Sherlock's throat. A soft cry escapes Sherlock's perfectly bowed lips against his will and John whispers, "Be with me. Please. If only just once."
John sighs a bit a Sherlock’s typical rudeness, but it does seem to do the trick. Bryant carefully smoothes his shirt and begins to explain.
He nods silently, and John apparently sees what he needs to know that Sherlock’s accepted what he’s said. “I need sleep, I can’t think straight. You should join me.”
Sherlock nods thoughtfully. "Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for your... ingenuity. And your impressive aim, especially given that you were very nearly in a complete psychotic state. The fact that you managed not to kill or paralyse either one of us is very impressive. But...considering all that and the original delivery method of the toxin, instead of risking both our lives, healths, and sanities in a dubious display of medical machismo while under the influence of hallucinatory drugs... could you not have just sprayed up our noses?"
“Come on, it will be fun,” John coaxes. Sherlock has taken refuge in John’s room while Mrs. Hudson fills the lower floor of the flat with food and decorations for the party tomorrow. He’s sitting cross-legged on John’s bed, petulant and dishevelled in a way makes him look positively edible.
Victor’s grief he can accept. John's not sure he can believe any grief could be as great as his, but it's of the same quality and sincerity, and John is grateful for it.
John pulls out his mobile, fiddles with it for a moment, and sets it on the floor a little way away from them. The sounds of violin music, slightly tinny but magnified by the hard concrete and aluminium around them, waft up from the floor. Sherlock cocks his head, listening. “Schubert… Opus 18, No. 6, waltz in B minor. That’s…my own arrangement for the violin. That’s me…playing… in our flat.”
John pinches bridge of his nose and walks to the other side of the room, putting as much space between them as he can get away with. “How can you possibly think
Mary is sitting in front of a little vanity table, alone, her hair and makeup done perfectly, but still dressed in an oversized button down shirt and ragged shorts.
“Are you sure?” John whispers, trying to hold back, be sensible. “It’s not safe like this, we should at least—”
Sherlock smiles faintly. "Oh nothing. I think I was just told what I ought to say in my speech. Now, is the organist here? She was supposed to arrive ten minutes ago. Well, if you don't know, find someone does. Hurry up!"
Sherlock barely has time to blink before Moriarty is gone. He straightens and walks to the edge of the roof, as sunset just begins. He smokes three more cigarettes in silence and then goes home.
“It did take some sleuthing, but there’s always records of these things if you can get people to give them to you. Most of the crude oil tankers, the really big ones, were sold to a large oil concern out of Dubai – you wouldn’t know it. The smaller product tankers were mostly scrapped, they were older and not in good shape. A few went to various smaller companies, all names I know, for continued use in their original function. But one,
This time they take the scan with John first out of view and then where Sherlock can see him, to compare his brain pattern when he's "seeing" and not.
Sherlock snorts. “Of course not. He knows something is going on, but he’s choosing to let you handle it for the time being. You will be watched, though.”
He doesn’t say it. He’s almost sure he doesn’t. He can’t fight the void and he doesn’t want to fight John, but maybe John can fight it for him. Maybe John can explain everything to him.
John nods, feeling suddenly bone-weary. Victor shows him to his rooms. He's relieved to note that they are in a completely different part of the castle than where he had stayed with Sherlock. He’s quite sure that is intentional.
“The prints match his boots exactly. Maybe he changed his stride to hide his identity,” Lestrade offers.
Sherlock wraps his arms around John, crushing him to his chest, and throws a long leg over John's thighs to keep him close. He intends to roll them both over so he is on top of John, but he pushes too hard and they are both still coated in oil. They roll one and half times and then John slips out of Sherlock's grasp and off the side of the bad, crashing to the floor.
John flushes at the memory of his response, how he’d felt the warmth spreading in his loins and how his heart had skipped a beat at the sight of her. He had hoped the drugging would have made Sherlock forget.
He’s not sure how much later he wakes, but John’s no longer beside him. He shakes off the disorientating darkness more quickly this time, but something else is wrong. He can’t quite pinpoint it, so he calls out to John.
John has never experienced something like this, with Sherlock or really anyone else. Sometimes it is hard for John to tell how much he means to Sherlock on a daily basis. He knows it, of course, but it can be difficult to remember in the middle of a case or when Sherlock is sulking or insulting him. But right now there is no such problem. Sherlock is being so obviously desirous, so tenderly playful and solicitous, that even the most irrational parts of John’s mind have no room to doubt.
John drifted over to counter and put the kettle on. Now he could feel Sherlock’s eyes boring into the back of his skull, trying to work out what was going on. He smiled to himself. “Tea? Breakfast? I was thinking a fry-up might be nice. I know we have some beans around here…”
John shakes his head. “No…not really. A little annoyed and frustrated, but nothing out of the usual.” He grins to show he’s teasing. “Why did you think I was?”
Sherlock only rises to bathe and to change the sheets a few times – he remains fastidiously clean even in his laziness. He sleeps naked, having told John that the feel of elastic or any binding fabric against his skin at night is painful and distracting and the only things bearable are his high-thread count linens. His only concession to clothing now is to throw on a dressing gown when he gets up. John doesn’t mind this in the least, although he sticks to pyjama bottoms and t-shirt for lounging purposes.
John’s head shoots up and he looks at Sherlock with red-rimmed irises. “Sherlock,” he says, his voice much gentler than Sherlock expects. “That’s not what this is about.
On the second afternoon John runs into some friends from the Army, other medics that he’s served with many times. He finds he’s surprised to see them, though given the setting he really oughtn’t be.
Once at the top he settles himself on a electrical box and lights a cigarette. He doesn't have long to wait.
“Probably not. Best just to wait here.” Sherlock is barely able to stand, with injuries to both legs. He’s bound some cloth from his shirt around his thigh wound, and his ankle is definitely sprained badly but not broken. Both their faces are covered with scratches from where thorns tore at their flesh as they ran, and Sherlock is doubtless mottled in developing bruises underneath his clothes.
John accepts the hand, but sways once on his feet and Sherlock has to steady him. Without a word, Sherlock puts an arm around him and begins helping him up the stairs. This is worrying. John likes his beer, but is almost never intoxicated to the point of incapacity.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and John relished the genuine look of surprise on his face, seeing as how rare such an expression was for the detective. He did not, however, get to appreciate it for very long before Sherlock had all but tackled him, nearly knocking him backwards out of his chair. Before he knew it, Sherlock was filling his senses, tongue in his mouth, hands on his neck, scent of aftershave in his nostrils.
He trails off, and Sherlock blinks rapidly, eyes scanning. "When?" he asks innocently, thinking it must have to do with Afghanistan.
“You look like Christmas sometimes,” Sherlock tells him, a little breathlessly, putting his hands to John’s waist and running them down to caress his jeans-clad arse.
“This going to sound a little out there, but I think… I think the light might be how your brain processes…feelings.”
“Because I felt the strange urge to sterilize them after you used them test the rates at which human kidneys dissolve in difference kinds of acid.”
On the other hand, it is exactly as exhausting as John might have guessed, and infinitely more unpredictable. Sherlock has gone his entire adult life without regular gratification, at least ten years without any at all, and at least one year in unrequited lust after his flatmate – he intends to make up for it now. He has also apparently decided to adhere to the “if sex is better than casework, than there should be much more sex than casework” theory he had outlined for John. John is more than happy to oblige, but Sherlock has inhuman stamina and apparently little need for rest, even when not on cases.
The slightest lightening of the sky is evident through the window. Rosie shifts in her cot, but hasn’t woken. John takes Sherlock’s hand again as they peer over the rails at the sleeping child, unruly dark curls fanned out around her fine-featured face.
The obvious reference would be the province in the Netherlands – a meetup location, perhaps? If everything went wrong. But wouldn’t they have chosen somewhere nearer by to regroup? The area’s far too rural to be an important outpost for an international crime syndicate, unless their primary focus is on horses.
Feeling John's readiness, he withdraws his fingers, steadying himself on the ground, and pushes into John. He sinks in slowly, deeply, John's body welcoming him. John's legs tighten behind his neck, shifting and letting him in that tiny bit more, fitting to him perfectly. Sherlock stills, relishing the moment of intimacy, of wholeness.
It was the next day that was the problem. The first snag was that it was going to take some time, possibly weeks for Mycroft and Lestrade to officially clear his name. He was still a very wanted man. That meant no leaving the house, no posting on his website, and above all absolutely no cases. Not even private ones. That was going to make getting back to normal impossible, at least for the immediate future.
John starts running after the man’s trail, which leads into the mess of briars and saplings that have taken over most of what used to be grass. It’s pouring, he can barely see anything between the rain and the uncanny darkness, except for brief flashes of lightning and the accompanying thunder, so loud and near that John thinks they could easily be struck at any moment. But the man has slipped in the mud a lot so John still manages to follow, as does Sherlock, close on John’s heels but limping. They tear through the undergrowth as the wind and rain whip around them, and it seems they are gaining on him but it’s hard to be certain.
“He’s also giving you his power of attorney, to make decisions for him if he is ever incapacitated.”
“I just… aside from being angry about how you did it and how you were thinking about it, I think I reacted so strongly because of Mary. What I have with you and what I had with her were so different. And I felt so guilty that I loved you, that I ran back to you so quickly, that I betrayed her in so many ways, big and small. That she died because… because of what we do, what we are together.
Sherlock grips John’s shoulders more tightly, fingernails digging into skin hard enough to draw blood, and John can tell that Sherlock is close. He feels the pressure building within himself as well, as he is pounded into the mattress, broken down and rebuilt by Sherlock’s powerful, insistent use of him. He is breathing heavily now, greedily pressing himself back against Sherlock as he feels his friend begin to shudder, wanting to experience every second as deeply as possible.
Not that Sherlock minded it. Actually, he stole a couple cigs from the older man. He himself smoked, although infrequently. It was a source of relief when things got overwhelming, and it started a year before he began university. Mummy didn’t know, but Irene did - she caught him one night, and then threatened to tell on him if Sherlock ever annoyed her.
The next day, John and his dorm mates gathered in the Great Hall for breakfast, and a little while later Professor McGonagall handed everyone their schedules.
On the first floor, he slumped down the wall, out of breath, feeling like a scared doe. Downstairs he heard John greet Lestrade in the kitchen, the uncle surprised by how quick his nephew was done with the shopping.
“I’m a fashion student, actually. I can also make my own clothes,” Irene said, her pride stepping in. If Janine dared to scoff, then not at her studies. “I could show you how, if you want to.”
Hi! I added this preamble of sorts to explain how this fic works. It is not just 1 fic, it’s 3 in 1! Like my instant coffee.
Irene waved a hand. “Long story, I’m tired. Short version: I’m a matchmaker supreme, so trust me, will you?”
The dodo surged forward, purring as it rubbed against John’s legs, climbing in his lap. He huffed, falling on his butt and the dodo cuddled him, immediately friendly and trusting of this stranger. A crinkle appeared between John’s eyebrows, amused and fond. He petted the flightless bird, chuckling.
He carried himself heavy, his usual good mood disintegrated. He almost looked catatonic. John said this dinner was the last interaction he desired to have with Mary this summer. In that case, his return should have been cheery and celebratory, as he’d envisioned. This was the complete opposite of the anticipated reaction.
Passing the automatic doors of the mall, the hot air slapping Sherlock in the face, he sorely regretted not putting up a bigger fight over this at home. The constant, unrepenting hum of air conditioning already began to grate at his nerves, and the Christmas songs, oh God. Sherlock blinked, having them closed for a while longer than strictly necessary. Whatever. He agreed to this, so suffer through he shall.
“Just comfortable,” John said, pressing a final kiss to Sherlock’s cheek as he extricated himself from their embrace. “Okay, we have to stop or we’ll hug until the end of days.”
Speaking of which, he’s still unsure of what to make out of Castiel. They met at dinner, and the guy is friendly enough. A bit odd, otherworldly even, and that ticked off all the wrong buttons for Greg. He picked at his dinner, as if he wasn’t hungry, he had a tiny twig in his hair and a leaf behind his ear that John had noticed and plucked it from him, thinking Greg didn’t see, and Sherlock was the lead conversationalist at the table tonight, especially when they overheard Cas mutter something about molecules -- that’s when Sherlock started firing off his knowledge about chemicals, elements, and the periodic table, trying all his might to get Greg interested in a debate with him. This boy hasn’t uttered a word until then unless necessary, and Greg worried the kids might have a fever. Or was it him? Maybe he caught something from the Californian tourists that day. Bloody hell.
, John led them to a kid’s toyshop on the same level. The mall was adequately crowded, couples and their offspring walking from shop to shop, enjoying the sunny day from the safety of a giant climatised box in the middle of the town. Greg used to take John here at least once during his summer stays here when he was a kid; he had fond memories of the toy shop. He’d never gotten a toy or a plushie that was too expensive in John’s view, his mother’s heeding not to be a burden for his grunkle, her stern voice inside his head always tipping the scales of his decision making. Despite that, he’d chosen beautiful plushies to keep him company in his bedroom in the Shack. Unfortunately, his father had either torn them up in fits of rage or they were given to the dogs to play with, or they were thrown out without John’s consent.
“You never cook in the first place,” John huffed, ducking a crumpled newspaper Greg threw at him. “Don’t act like I’m lying! I don’t remember how long ago I saw you hold a pan.”
“I’ll explain later,” Irene whispered, glancing over the leg of Mary’s desk to see what the delusional woman was doing. Examining the dress.
town’s founder, Alexander Hirsch, only to find out that a woman has actually been the original founder, but there’s nothing to fulfill that claim yet. Alex has been mummified in chocolate and hated squirrels and --”
Mycroft ascended the stairs, careful not to be too loud. He got better over the years in sneaking up on people. He always gave their parents fright, much to his amusement. And Sherlock’s, when he was younger. Things were simpler back then. More careless and full of childhood oblivion.
“You know we’re in the same room and I can hear you?” Greg said bitterly, scowling at the both of them. He put his empty soda can on the floor next to his feet as he turned his body sideways to look at them. “I’m not that bad of a cook, you know? I make pretty decent pancakes. And scrambled eggs. And doughnuts.”
“We can do an experiment on your ability to perform a number of accents,” Sherlock offered. He had an inkling that John was trying to lighten up the atmosphere (successfully) in order not to make Sherlock overly sad about his older brother. A nice gesture. Such a John move, and Sherlock felt happy, albeit nostalgic. “But anyway, Mycroft left. He said he might not be able to come home for summer if he’s busy with his jobs all over Canada and the US and whatnot, so that’s why I told him to bring a big treasure. But…. Summer came and went, and Mycroft was nowhere to be seen. Mommy was suspicious right after he’d left in January that year, but he was all over the place and she couldn’t get a proper hold of him. She kept it from us, of course, not to worry us and only told me later when I asked.”
"And here I thought the first week would be easy," said John to Greg upon leaving the classroom. "What do you think so far?"
“Ha! I won another round!” Irene proclaimed victoriously, circling the whole grid a couple times for emphasis.
“Dude, I’m a mirror,” his mirror self proclaimed, gesturing its hands up and down. It was odd to hear his voice say ‘dude’. “You think I can run after you and kill you in your sleep? I’m bored. You tend to be often as well. Your date night is basically the only entertainment I have! Have some empathy, yo.”
Overall, the Winchesters and Castiel were quite the trio to observe, especially in action. Castiel was an angel of the Lord, so a warrior. But so far they weren’t presented with an opportunity where Cas could show off his fighting style or inhuman powers. What were their backgrounds? How did they meet? How did Sam and Dean become hunters? He’ll find out eventually.
A pause. A sigh. "Fine. But only because it's less boring than Potion of Forgetfulness at the moment."
“That’s fair,” Dean nodded, ducking his head. “Again, sorry for that. But -- she just has this sweet look in her eyes and her ponytails are adorable and….”
“Ew, what is that?” Ron pointed to a dripping liquid on the table that hissed when it fell on floor tiles.
He made his way to the kitchen and searched the cupboards for food, having no qualms about this being someone else’s kitchen. Well, Lestrade had told them to feel like home, which he didn’t, but he’ll use the comforts the house offers without shame. He settled for plain toast, opening the fridge to fish out a soda can (a cheap rip-off of Pepsi called
Dean left to pack and change from his sweaty clothes, leaving Cas to stand in the corridor by himself. “Which permits were they talking about?” John asked, turning Cas’ attention to him.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock frowned, feeling lost. He never had anyone besides his immediate family give him presents. Some from Mycroft have been meaningful and practical, like the enchanted binoculars that spotted magical insects easily. But other than that, the traditions have always been rather oppressive. Especially when he was forced to spend time with their extended family and the spawns of Grindelwald his mother’s cousins proudly called their offspring. Christmases were loud, obnoxious, and definitely not ‘calm’ or ‘wonderful’ as others described it.
“Definitely,” Sherlock said, a manic look overtaking his face. His big hands grabbed Irene by the shoulders as he shook her with vigor. “Do you know what this could mean?”
This didn't come as a surprise to Sherlock. Daniel Watson, a military captain, was a workaholic, so there was no doubt climbing the career ladder was important to him. He also held a great dislike for the magical world, and Sherlock couldn't comprehend how John didn't realise. Yes, John was aware that his parents were new to this and therefore brushed it off as something they would get used to, but he overlooked the way his father acted around him. It was obvious from the moment Sherlock saw him.
“Man, you gotta try it!” Will said, excited by the prospect of a sweet treat. “There are so many flavours! Cookies, kinder bueno, strawberry….”
“Irene and Kate are making fun of John’s height,” Sherlock said, setting the second aquarium on the counter, the stale water splashing on the glass frame.
“No -- no, wait!” Sherlock hurried to explain. “I didn’t mean to diminish the strength of what we have, I also think it’s more than dating. It came to my mind first, that’s why I used it. I…. I care about you too, John. Deeply. I’m sorry. I’m not used to relationships.”
Sally Donovan, who stood by talking to Henry’s father, looked at the sorry sight of the four of them and frowned. She squinted suspiciously at Sam and Dean. “No, why? I thought you two went with him?”
Feet shuffled on the floor, and then Irene was at his side, a soothing palm tracing circles on his bare back. “It’s not. I find it cute. But also infuriating because you both --”
Before the Doctor or Donna could reply, Irene beat them to it. “What? Sherlock, you did the math. In any other timeline, Molly gets asked out by Andrew West and Mike stays alone! We can’t mess this up when we achieved the best outcome for them!”
“Shit, what about Greg?” John said, a hint of stress in his voice. He found his own phone, only to see that he had no unanswered calls. “God, he didn’t call? What happened? Hey, Sally? Was Greg here?”
“You’d be surprised,” Sam said, chin tipping towards the boat. “We’d better get going, then. We’re Sam and Dean Winchesters, by the way. Brothers,” he added, motioning to the two of them.
. His body automatically turned to where he hid the journal (his suitcase, right beneath his carefully arranged socks), but he stopped himself from moving an inch. No, not now. He couldn’t risk anyone (John) walking in on him reading it again. He’ll leave it for the dark of the night, studying its contents. And if Irene had anything against him using his bedside lamp, she can shove it. It’s not like she’s too considerate of Sherlock’s needs to sleep when she calls with her fashionista classmates.
“Hey guys,” he said, nodding at John and Sherlock, then his brother and Cas. “How long have you been waiting?”
“You agreed to a favour of hers,” Sherlock said neutrally. John’s sharp exhale through his nose confirmed it.
Sherlock ruminated over the word for a second before giving John a slight nod. He rested his cheek on his folded arms and huffed, watching John’s face intently. He looked more rested than when Sherlock woke up the last time, but lines of worry were present even today, though to a lesser extent. His clothes had changed colour to more brownish shades, but his scruff stayed the same. Was it stubble, or a beard in progress? Sherlock didn’t know how exactly land dwellers referred to it. It couldn’t be a full beard, because those were longer, and they raised red flags in him due to his upbringing. Merfolk children were discouraged to interact with bearded landfolk because of its similarity to octopi, which liked to prey on them. Plus, children were gullible and easily deceived, or at least that was the common consensus among adult merfolk. Sherlock didn’t quite agree, but his nonexistent voice would do nothing to change that. However, childhood teachings hovered above him, and his senses perked up out of habit whenever he was around a bearded individual. Which wasn’t many times, but his point stood.
On the back of the coupon he read that A, whoever they were, had a solitary room in the back of the gym they rented. He made it there, circling around treadmills and dumbells stinking of sweat. He scrunched up his nose, but pushed through.
“Me too, Jake,” Irene returned his smile, handing Will the study materials. “Careful with the book. If I find one corner bent, I’ll bend you.”
“I’ll compete!” she raised her hand. Everyone gasped, again. Janine looked amused, but oh, she had no idea what was coming for her. Irene and Kate locked gazes, determination shining brightly in both. She’ll show Janine what a ‘regular’ is capable of.
“Sleep well?” Sherlock asked, running a hand through his hair. John grunted and tried not to slouch too much. He didn’t bother changing from his pyjamas either.
“You think so?” something in Sherlock’s eyes gleamed at that. He still looked apprehensive, though, not shaking off the feeling John may be mad at him. That told John in turn that Sherlock’s wit and genius weren’t alway appreciated. (How? Why not?)
“Painting our nails can wait, I have one more question,” Sherlock hurried to Cas’ side to show him the journal. He dutifully ignored Irene’s military remark and blatant disrespect of their fabled divine saviour and his fandom. “Cas, have you ever seen a mystery journal similar to this one?”
“Yeah, it did,” Sherlock agreed, although it was hard to hide his perplexion. He thought it was a reenactment of a scene from the movie
“Anyway, they blamed a Third Year student for opening the Chamber, apparently. Another student found out he had raised an Acromantula in the castle, and he was expelled. People back then believed that he opened the Chamber and let the spider kill Myrtle.”
Eventually, after what Sherlock thought felt like centuries, she put her gear aside, using her fingers to ruffle and fluff up his hair to her liking. She took a step back, forefinger pressed against her lips as she assessed him like some sculpture. She whirled one stray curl behind Sherlock’s ear, loosening another on his forehead. Irene hummed contentedly, but instructed Sherlock to sit still as she rummaged through her makeup bag taking out powder highlighter.
Sherlock’s lips curled up as he silently bore witness to their conversation. Lestrade was irritated, but he didn’t take it out on anyone close to him. He and Donovan were likely old friends, that much was obvious that day when he and John investigated the case of Gloria Scott with the Winchester brothers. Their bickering was based on firing off of the other’s comments.
Exhaling through his gritted teeth, Sherlock returned to the theatre. Best leave Irene to her harmless state of brain freeze musing about the Bible and Jesus, albeit incorrectly. Back inside, John’s head snapped up and found his silhouette as he closed the doors. Kate’s wailing had finally stopped, much to everyone’s delight.
Much to the Doctor’s dismay, the iPhone in his hand vibrated, but released an unhappy, suffering sigh and something popped inside its case. The Doctor threw it over his shoulder. “That’s a no, then. Should’ve known I got scammed by that London amphibian smuggler.”
On his right he saw another mirror, albeit considerably smaller in size compared to his current prison. Sherlock concentrated. He fixed his gaze on the opposite surface with diligent focus, the kind he saved for his experiments (and John, on occasion). Surprisingly, he felt a tingle swim and course through his veins, the sensation the very same he experienced when the mirror switched places.
“Gregory was an amazing friend,” Cage said with that frozen poster expression. No one would take that as a sincere statement. “And I only reciprocated. I cursed those who didn’t find this great home he gave me -
Eventually they spotted the whacky roof of the Mystery Shack and its sign, the M tilted to the side and threatening to dislodge any second. They came to the clearing, Jake huffing for breath and on the lookout for potential enemies out in the field. The lot was mostly deserted, save for Greg’s and Mrs Hudson’s cars. Jake raised his snout, the black tip of his wet nose twitching as he sniffed for a scent nearby. With the air clear, he headed for the porch, his body waggling. Irene tightened her hold around Kate, and soon they were hiding by the porch, listening keenly for footsteps that would foretell an intruder.
“Nope, he’s adopted like all toys are,” John grinned, handing Archie to Sherlock and taking the bags containing Cas’ clothes in turn. “I mean, you can return him if you don’t like Archie, but that’s bad etiquette.”
That alarmed Sherlock. “Did he?! B-but… I didn’t pick up on the clues! Up til now it was just my wondering, but did he?”
“No surprise there, Boss visited him two decades ago and just bound it out of spite on the spot. What about green leafy?”
“He does!” Sherlock confirmed, a smile tagging at the corners of his mouth. “He’s as talented as the real Freddie. He’s our friend.”
“I know who it is from,” he said grimly, but he encouraged Sherlock with a ghost of a smile. “Can you deduce it? You can open it as well. I don’t want to read it yet.”
“I assume you don’t want to be summoned to Professor Sprout’s office on the first day of school, Anderson,” Mycroft said cooly. He was scarily calm. If it were possible, John was sure Anderson would shrink under that gaze. “Or do you want to continue harassing Second Years? That wouldn’t be the wisest decision.”
“Too little data to answer that yet,” Sherlock clipped his tongue. He circled around OG as he inspected the eye stabbing. It wasn’t too deep, as though the person attacking wasn’t strong enough to pierce further. The cut in the abdomen was ragged, the attacker was struggling with that area as well. Interesting. “Technically, all of us except for Lestrade and Mrs Hudson  are suspects.”
“What about it?” Irene looked at Kate, intrigued. She never gave it a second thought, what might be above the small room. Kate climbed it and pushed the trapdoor atop it open, revealing the brightening sky above Reichenbach Falls.
“Wow, affection! Sure it does erase the inevitable existential crisis that’s creeping up on me.” Greg hugged John back, the gesture of support quickly turning into a competition of who can squeeze the other one harder and crush his bones. Greg let go after a while, wheezing for breath. “‘Kay, staph, I’m too weak for this shit tonight.”
He trailed off, pacing inside the Shack, slamming the doors behind him. John was unsure of what to do. The impostor saw something, but where? John scanned everything on the porch; the floor, the walls, the railing, the windows…. Oh shit.
It showed Sherlock lying on top of John, hands dug under him, their legs intertwined and mouths slightly agape, snoring softly.
And tomorrow, they’d meet. He and Sam and Dean would be reunited after a long search. And neither of them will have to wait for the other’s response anymore. He will hear Dean clearly and in person, not having to depend on a phone call or, surprisingly, prayers. The latter meant…. Well, Cas couldn’t quite describe it. But it was good. Tomorrow, they will see each other.
“A bunker? Or a passage that leads to some secret safe? I don’t know. Let’s see what’s at the end, and then we can come back with Sherlock. I don’t feel good here either.”
“I’m Sherlock Holmes and this is John Watson,” Sherlock introduced them, smiling down at John. “Irene is my crazy step-sister and Kate is our similarly crazy friend.”
Sherlock refrained from replying, instead choosing to fluff up the pillow by vigorously punching the ever inanimate soul out of it. He crossed his legs and turned his back to him. John grinned and grabbed his phone. Mike sent him a message.
“So she rings you whenever she gets an interesting new species,” Sherlock said, sitting in the passenger seat. He adjusted it more to his liking so that his knees didn’t ram into the dashboard.
His mind strayed from the forest, his focus dissipating as his legs functioned on autopilot. He will have to stop at a village to stock up on resources. He was doing alright with herbs and tinctures in the case of an injury, but food was depleting with each passing day.
“There’s the bugger,” Greg whispered, showing it a circle of salami. Indeed, the racoon inched closer, it’s cute snout twitching at the undeniably delicious smell. Fortunately, he was still holding the permit in its paw.
“Bullshit, it’s twenty-twenty-two.” She squinted, counting it in her head. “Yeah. How come this… stuff worked? Shouldn’t you be dead?”
“Okay. Uh… Where to begin… Ah! Right, so. You see, I’m not a normal racoon. I can talk and I am able to form coherent and intelligent thoughts, unlike my family and some deer friends.”
Dean’s eyebrows hitched up as he looked from Cas to John, as if asking for permission. “You’re aware people aren’t usually giddy ‘bout that kind of stuff, right?”
“Sorry, it’s not like I want to pry,” Irene said, brows knitting into a slight frown. “John is very nice, it’s hard to imagine him being sad or unsociable.”
“With John, I think,” Dean looked to Cas to confirm it, even though he’d said so minutes ago. His lack of sleep was showing. “He’ll be back in a bit, don’t worry.”
“I could be an ally,” John argued, though he appreciated that noticing details ran in the Adler-Holmes family. Irene gave him a look that told him all he needed:
John treaded up the stairs two at a time. He succeeded in lying to Greg about their true whereabouts and activity, though he didn’t lie when he said they lost track of time. And from what Greg told him, they were busy at the Shack as well, having Irene chase a racoon under the porch for half a day, apparently.
“You didn’t do exactly well with seducing your Golden Boy using the necklace, did you?” he teased. Mary grit her teeth. “Speaking of which, any theory why that didn’t work out, Miss Morstan?”
Sally Donovan and her younger colleague, sargeant Dimmock, animatedly gesticulated behind the bar, sharing anecdotes from work. What didn’t escape Sherlock’s never-ending scrutiny was the fact that Sally kept glancing at another person throughout her conversation with Dimmock. Henry.
They exchanged a long look, and Gabriel relented, shoulders sagging in a tired sigh. “Alright. Fuck this divine bullshit. But I can’t promise anything. I’m doing this mostly because my angel tits make me trust your bees.”
The drive was filled with unhappy engine sounds and horrible radio signal, later switched to Lestrade’s trusty collection of eighties’ music when even he couldn’t bear the crap transmission.
Sherlock trailed a finger over the vertebrae bumps on John’s spine. “Would you try it out, though? Bathing in squirrels?”
“It wouldn’t have to be. Why do they even build supermarkets inside malls? Why does everything in America have to be so big and so numerous?”
“Oh, don’t worry, dear,” she waved him off nonchalantly. She was wrapped in a thin cardigan; it was chilly. She walked a few paces back to the backseat and John came to her side of the car to see better. “I’m just getting things sorted out.”
True, they were each other’s pain in the arse, but she loved him like she loved her dad and mum (step-mother, Sherlock’ mom, but she started calling her mum long ago), and they were a chaotic duo that worked well together when they weren’t at their throats.
“Actually,” Sherlock said, the glint in his eyes telling John that he’s made an important connection himself. “There was a mirror shapeshifter who told us the exact same thing about the auras. He said mine is purple and John’s yellow. Does it look yellow to you?”
“Ugh, whenever I'm in those woods I feel like something is watching me,” Irene shivered next to him, watching him take the signs. Kate returned to her usual spot behind the cash register, pulling a neatly stacked magazine about hunting out of its proper order. Sherlock had put it there
Gloria turned her scrutinising attention to Sherlock’s friend, a sparkle in her eyes lasting a millisecond before disappearing. “Don’t go swimming, the water is cold. You will drown.”
That said, the evening continued on brilliantly. Sherlock was a bit put out when Cas couldn’t satisfy his curiosity regarding the journal, but Irene knew his mood improved when John made him go prepare Cas’ room and bed and later returned to the attic, hair ruffled and t-shirt crumpled. Irene hoped they kept their business out of Cas’ bedding, that would be disrespectful towards their guest. But seeing that dazed look on her brother’s face made her feel giddy about her matchmaker guts.
“You’re forgetting one thing, darling,” Freddie said gloomily, lowering his head. “You lot are not put off by me -- but anyone else might be. I’m not as rusty as some other ghouls -- been one for roughly forty years only --”
The crowd cheered and got moving in rhythm with the beat of the song. Irene turned to Janine, offering her a hand to shake, which was graciously ignored by the girl. Ah, so it’s like this.
“Alright. I’ll go, you can stay here and help Mrs Hudson with the s’mores,” Irene said, already turning on her heels to jog to the Shack. John moved to follow Mrs Hudson inside from the front, but then stopped abruptly.
. He was full of surprises, this man. And then he left to sort himself out, leaving Sherlock to his own devices.
Sherlock snorted. “Dean, I get it. But be aware that she’s going to try your patience a lot. I suggest we make a schedule of who takes care of her when and go from there.”
“Oh, did they?” McGonagall said, mildly amused. “I cannot say that I agree with their teaching techniques, but it does sound rather helpful. Now, let’s review our latest spell. Mr Selcout, if you please.”
,” Sherlock whined, halting at the doorstep of John’s room. He watched his back enter the room and open the wardrobe. John swiftly changed his sweaty t-shirt for a fresh white tank top. Sherlock’s mouth went dry. He’s seen John shirtless before, but the notion of swinging the fabric over his shoulders, the muscles contracting and softening, well. He was entitled to stare and
"Damn the cat!" John muttered under his breath, the animal walking by as though it were taking a stroll on the beach, taking its time to locate the trespassers.
John zipped up his hoodie, a yellow counterpart hanging over his shoulder. “I’m taking Sherlock out to stargaze. The sky is clear, so I want to go before it clouds. Sam and Dean are probably asleep, could you maybe stay in the attic with Irene? Just for thirty minutes or so. Sherlock said that the potion’s effects will wane tonight, so maybe she’ll age up during sleep. Is it okay with you?”
“Then how come you have, presumably, healthy wings?” Sherlock said, craning his neck to look at Castiel. He seemed lost for an answer.
Unease hung above their heads. John and Ron both looked at the ground, while Hermione and Harry exchanged glances. Sherlock shut his eyes closed, not moving even slightly. John inquired about the horcruxes, and Harry tried to answer as much as he could.
“Uh, I mean, I could help?” John said, shrugging. He tried not to let the pang of rejection show on his face. Damn, he shouldn’t have suggested that. He got carried away. “If you don’t want me tagging along, that’s fine, I get that. We don’t know each other that well, in the end and…”
“It’s gonna be alright. But man, what the fuck is this town? Fountain of Youth leaves? What’s next, Nicolas Cage returns, a trilogy?”
“Naw, he wouldn’t. He was a gentleman. A little cray-cray in the head, but who isn’t? He still sometimes visits on occasion.”
Oh, it did. The silent yearning that Sherlock had throughout March, April, May, June, and finally, July, was indescribable. He wrote it off as simple brain shenanigans, but seeing John… he really found his half, didn’t he? Okay, this is definitely over the top, so he’ll keep it to himself. But… yeah. John and him had a familiar pace of
had created. Castiel was versed deep into the fictional universe, his person not having moved for the past hour since the episode had started. Sherlock sat up and combed through his hair to make the curls more presentable, shutting the journal and depositing it on the coffee table.
“I… Doesn’t matter!” Sherlock said, irritated (and a little ashamed). “Just get him to touch my hand!”
Sherlock’s hand jerked as Mrs Hudson touched his knuckles. “Don’t take them seriously, Sherlock,” she said soothingly. The hint of pity in her voice made Sherlock’s skin crawl. “You’re a fine young man, you don’t need to listen to that stuff.”
John rolled his eyes, more at himself than at them - he should stop expecting them to know such trivia. He didn’t know much wizarding stuff either. Like with that Lord whoever-knows-who-it-was. At least he wasn't a threat anymore since last October.
“Ah,” Magnussen nodded, smugness clouding his face. “In that case, don’t let me disturb you. Dismissed.”
Whatever happened to that tosser? And where was he? Questions swirled in his mind, asking for the very needed clarity, and yet he had no answers. There was another man… Shorter than the hunter, and certainly more intelligent, but not a threat. At least that’s what Sherlock sensed in the forest. Did the man rescue him? Sherlock let out a long suffering exhale at the premonition of that and shook. He was in a rather hateful position.
“The name escapes me. But I think he stayed on the grounds and worked or works on the premises of Hogwarts now. Of course, no one could directly pinpoint the opening of Chamber to him - according to a legend, Salazar Slytherin constructed it. This was when the founders argued who would be coming to the school.
Mary gives him a queer look. “Don’t you? You planned our wedding, you became protective of me once you knew John loved me, you've endured the place of a friend when you wanted so much more. That’s what it is. Doing what is in the best interest of someone, despite personal risk or cost, even if it jeopardises your relationship with them or they are unaware of what you‘re doing or why.”
John is very still for a moment, captivated by this performance, then shakes himself and takes Sherlock’s hand, leading him back to the sofa. They sit, with Sherlock’s gangly legs thrown over John’s lap. “I’m not crazy,” he says defensively but tiredly, and John strokes his calf.
“Moriarty left Richard Brook,” Greg says carefully. “But Hanna – or whoever was helping her – left nothing.”
Mycroft lowered his voice, sadly. “John, you’re right, I do need your forgiveness, in more ways than you know. I should have protected Sherlock, shouldn’t have let him… but that’s not what I’m here for and I don’t expect you to give it to me in any case. There is something far more urgent at stake right now.”
“No. Only if it’s a really difficult case. Or if we’ve had a row and you’ve gone off to get some air. Then things can go a bit greyscale like today.”
Looked like he was going to Vienna after all, assuming he could figure out what the hell Sherlock meant about him knowing the codes. How exactly had he expected Mycroft to extract information from John that John didn’t even know he had? And without tipping him off as to why? The man was insane. Of course he had known that from the day they met and he had never stopped him from following Sherlock into hell before.
? Did you really think I was actually safe like that, that you could just step back into our life here without any consequences? My God, Sherlock, I nearly –”
Sherlock had suspected as much, at least that some kind of scan would have to happen. He didn't know of any diseases of the eye that would cause instant blindness like that, although he'd rather been hoping John did. "You do it."
She looks him over appraisingly. He knows that look. It's the "you don't seem like much but you have guts" look.
First he hobbles then he runs. He hears a shot, and shattering glass, but it’s not from Sherlock’s pistol. He forgets his injury as he races down flights of stairs, heedless of traps. He’s ended up in the front of the house now, grand sweeping staircase and large windows before him. He spies the murderer outside on what passes for a lawn, with a rifle, having just shot at Sherlock through the window.
“You really are thick!” John exclaimed. “Will you just listen to me for a minute instead of acting like you know everything?”
A name, an address, and a wink -a wink!- tossed before the lab door closed, had haunted his walk back to the God-awful bedsit that was all he could afford on his Army pension.
He takes a small sip of the wine and lets the heavy, dry notes of oak and dark cherry sit on his tongue for a moment before swallowing. Sherlock’s bright gaze, a startling bluish-green at the moment, turns to him and he meets his eyes.
“Look, sex is sex, ok? Man, woman, doesn’t really make a difference to me. Sex feels good no matter who I have it with and I like making my partner feel good. Sex is fun, and I enjoy having fun with my partner. It’s physical, and it doesn’t require much of an emotional component. At least, not all the time, not for me,” he admitted, and Sherlock saw nothing wrong with that admission. John was a tactile man. He obviously enjoyed sex. There was nothing wrong with that.
“You know, this would be a lot easier if you just moved in with me,” Sherlock reiterated for what felt like the thousandth time.
John sighed, his throat tight as the words faded into the silence between them once more. He looked up from his feet to look towards Sherlock again. He took in the familiar angles, the subtle changes from a lived apart, and his chest felt constricted with the loss of innocence that clung to Sherlock’s shoulders now. He knew Sherlock was no innocent, of course, but he had had to do things that he never wanted to do, and John had been around enough soldiers in his life to know how killing another person changed you. He wished, wildly, that he could have taken that responsibility for himself, to save Sherlock from that, but he couldn’t, and hadn’t been given the opportunity anyway. It was done. There was nothing to do except move forward.
“This was your room?” John asked and Sherlock looked at him with a hint of surprise on his features.
John mentally shook his head at himself and pushed out all thoughts beyond spending time with his daughter and his best friend without any other responsibilities. He had a whole day of blue skies, sun, beach, waves, and then ice cream in front of him.
Two plates of bucatini in his lemony carbonara with crispy bits of fried bacon and pancetta sprinkled throughout. John let the conversation fade out as Sherlock wasn’t speaking anyway and John had to admit that the food in front of him looked like the most appetizing dish he had seen in years. The first bite, lemon and yolky sauce and salty pancetta with the al dente pasta was perfection, and John hummed in food-inspired bliss.
John watched them for a moment, still aware and still ignoring Sherlock’s eyes on him, until he could no longer avoid its pull and let his own eyes drift up to an aquamarine gaze.
When she was done, John pulled off his shirt and started applying the sunblock to his own skin. While he tended to go more gold than burn, he didn’t want to take any chances. He was reaching awkwardly around his back when Sherlock huffed and grabbed the bottle from the ground and stood behind him.
It had taken three bedtime stories, a private violin concerto, multiple promises of waking her if anyone heard a single bell from a reindeer-drawn sleigh, and finally the reminder that she actually had to go to bed if she expected Father Christmas to come at all for presents for her.
When Rosie was finished and another napkin sacrificed to the lost cause of trying to clean the chocolate stains on her face, they rose and made their way back to the car. Once back at the cottage, Sherlock offered to bathe her and put her to bed and Rosie was more than happy with that plan, so John gave her goodnight kisses and sent them both off upstairs.
The Tube was significantly behind schedule, some mechanical issue, and by the time he had finally made it off the platform at a stop that three away from his destination, he was already late for his first patient. The mobile reception underground was complete shite, so he hadn’t even been able to call into work to let them know he was late and on his way.
When she opened the door he gave a relieved smile and shifted the tray into both hands and felt much more confident that it wouldn’t fall.
“Wrong on one account, though,” he said and tried not to grin at the look on Sherlock’s face at the idea of him being wrong about something.
When he got back to the flat he pulled down his book of flowers and meanings. After several minutes of searching through pages, he finally found the one he was searching for. A yellow marguerite.
John waited for them as they approached. He saw them talking together, but they weren't yet close enough where he could hear the words. Rosie held Sherlock’s entire attention, and John felt the now familiar tightening in his chest as he watched the two people he loved most in the world together. He had been worried in the beginning, not sure how Sherlock would handle John returning to 221B with a toddler in tow, but it had turned out to be a complete non-issue. Sherlock was absolutely amazing with Rosie right from the beginning. They were completely enamored with each other, and John didn’t even bother to hide the fond smile he felt on his face.
“Lestrade. Detective Inspector. Taller than me, shorter than you. Bit of a silver fox,” John replied casually as he returned his attention towards his book after he placed his teacup down on the table beside him.
“I’ll have them check to see if she had an owner. See if anyone has called in a missing dog or something.”
“It would appear Mummy made some changes to the rooms,” he said and John couldn’t hold back his laugh.
John’s smile was almost sad in response. He lifted his hand to brush a curl from Sherlock’s eye. They had lost so much time being together like this. Perhaps, though, there was something to have been gained by their time apart. Rosie, of course, but perhaps other things as well. Sherlock had learned to be more open with his emotions after his return from the dead and John had learned that a life without Sherlock was one that left him barely living. They had both hurt each other in such awful, painful ways.
“Hm, yes. And yesterday?” John asked as he took another sip of his tea and leaned back against the kitchen counter.
He managed about thirty minutes of conversations before the nurse made her way over to him again. He had never thought of flirting as being aggressive before, but there was no other way to describe the woman’s actions towards him. Which was odd, considering he wasn’t exactly the most sociable person in the room. Or the clinic. Or ever. But every time he shook her off for a few minutes, she seemed to come right back, stronger than before.
“Yup! Another kiss!” she demanded, and John laughed and kissed her cheek again, but she shook her head. “No, no, not Rosie kisses, ‘Lock kisses!”
He hadn’t expected Sherlock to follow him in. Not today. He felt another flash of anger and frustration, but he kept silent in the shower. Waited for the man to say something. When nothing came, he let out an irritated huff of breath, and finally reached for his shampoo and washed his hair, raked his fingers against his scalp so hard it almost hurt. Rinsed it off. Then he got his soap and started to wash his skin. Scrubbed the loofah hard enough against his skin to make the skin red as the blood rushed up at the onslaught.
Rosie’s eyes narrowed in intensity, in no mood to be intimidated by Sherlock. “Chocolate ice cream,” she reminded him, shaking her whole hand emphatically.
Sherlock looked thoughtful for a moment. “Almost everything. What’s missing? If you could wish for anything, what would it be?”
Another sunny room, though this one had a double bed that was done in soft blues and yellows. It rather reminded John of the garden below and he walked in and dropped his bag at the foot of the bed. He could hear Rosie playing outside the open window here, as well.
This “Alex”, though, changed everything. This was a relationship that John had been in. It was very clear that it went beyond the physical and into the emotional realm of actual relationships.
“You’re welcome, dear,” she smiled with a pat on his arm. “Joy and I went for a little walk earlier, so she should be good for the night. She’s such a good dog.”
When it came back, it was with the feeling of shaving cream being smoothed over his cheeks, his chin, his jaw. The clean scent of it joined the lavender to fill the air around them, and Sherlock let his head tip back as he breathed in.
Mrs. Hudson’s head popped out of the kitchen to look at him. “Are you sure, dear? Don’t you have something to be getting on with?”
John couldn’t remember what those flowers were meant to mean and perhaps they didn’t mean anything. Perhaps the mourner had simply picked flowers they liked and left them behind. Perhaps Molly had finally come to visit.
He made his way from the kitchen back into the living room, brushing the crumbs from his shirt, and over to the cold fireplace. He fiddled with the logs and kindling for a few moments before he finally coaxed the wood to catch and properly burn. The heat wasn’t instantaneous, but he could already feel the immediate area around the fireplace as the flames licked higher grow warmer. By the time his food was delivered, the living room had managed a slow climb up a few degrees higher. Not warm, by any means, but no longer frigid.
John’s feet stopped responding to his instructions to walk as he came into the center of the room, his eyes quickly scanning the area in surprise. There were vases covering every available surface, and some not available ones, filled with flowers. The scent of the blooms overpowered even the sharp, citrusy scent of the pine that had been present for the month.
It was silent for a moment, the only sound their quiet breathing and the noise of midnight London outside the window. John knew it was a risk saying what he said. Confessing to Sherlock how much he hoped for, but he couldn’t imagine not taking the chance to speak his feelings after being given the opportunity. He felt like if he didn’t say anything, he might never get another chance.
Each swipe of the blade was another tether for Sherlock to grab hold of and he started to pull himself back together with the help of John’s steady hands.
John laughed at him, exasperated, but conceded to go if Sherlock accompanied him. As it was in his best interest to ensure the doctor moved in as quickly as he could, he agreed and they made their way out of the flat and to a taxi.
With John safely ensconced in his bedroom, Sherlock rose from his chair at the kitchen table and made his way to the sofa. He needed to think. He briefly considered the nicotine patches that sat in an old biscuit tin, but ultimately decided against them. John didn’t like when he used them and it would have been too distracting to know that while actively thinking about John. He lay out on the sofa, adjusted the pillow there for maximum neck support, brought his hands up to steeple his fingers under his chin, and closed his eyes.
“Or continue to stand there until you reboot and are ready to talk,” John tried, opting for their usual teasing banter and hoping that would be enough to get Sherlock to engage in some kind of communication.
This was perfect! He needed John to want to move in. He had already declared that he needed an assistant. If he could pull John into the Work, he was positive he could convince him to take the flatshare. The doctor was clearly wasting away where he was, and if Sherlock could give him some kind of purpose…yes, this could work. He called John over, and though the man was a bit snippy at first, he did as Sherlock asked and gave his medical opinion on the victim. Sherlock stood up and began to explain to Lestrade everything he had seen. John stared up at him from his crouch on the floor, eyes wide and watching him intently, before he stood as he continued his deductions.
Sherlock got the better end of the deal. He pressed his back against the wall that was, in this case, chilly, his left leg accompanying the attempt at cooling off his body temperature. Despite their longing for cuddles they strayed from touching each other because it would only make them adhere to one another permanently. It would be fine if it weren’t for Sherlock’s neglectful starving tendencies, so this stayed in the hypothetical realm.
Two hours later, Sam was having a successful brainstorming session with Greg and Dean. The three of them invented three new expositions for the Mystery Museum. Dean suggested they give Huggybear a tragic backstory and put a fez on his biggest head in the centre, just so that he could gain more sympathy. Then he and Sam joined forces to put together a cornilope, an antelope made of corn -- for the kids. In the meantime, Greg repurposed some of his older exhibits, namely a parrot that was made of sticky notes and discarded swarovski crystals. This turned into a squirrel by some impossible miracle Sam thought went beyond the immortal world of Heaven and Hell. And in the end, they all agreed to give Sascrotch a girlfriend -- which was, in fact, just a really ugly plushie of a monkey. Sam called dibs on naming it and since twelve-fifteen o’clock, Sascrotch has a girlfriend called Monke.
“I want to see you try,” Sherlock said, picking up the journal to resume his search for the new temporary Mystery Shack attraction. John muttered under his breath, but Sherlock paid him no attention.
“Yeah, yeah,” Irene managed, hissing at the sticky feeling of her skin. She certainly didn’t want to attract bugs or wasps or similar insects today. She needs to clean up. “Do you know where I could find napkins?”
John nodded, a straightforward jut of his chin and he whistled to call the dogs. He got them ready and ushered them towards the front door. “Gonna take them on the lane -- nobody’s coming here in the afternoon and the Shack’s closed, so it will be safe to let them roam free for a bit. See ya later.”
“Oh yeah? You’re an annoying piece of shit!” John spat out, his viciousness startling Sherlock momentarily. Dean’s eyes widened a little as well. Cas continued watching Cage intently. Sherlock felt for John’s hand and squeezed his fingers. That made him swallow his next words of abuse and he leaned into Sherlock, breaths heavy.
Sherlock tipped his head, considering it. Hm. Yes, that was also possible, of course. “The question remains, though,” he said. “Where? Would he bother to enchant it somewhere else? That’s what I want to look at, John. Just a better peek under the illusion. I don’t have a rope with me yet, so I can’t descend tonight, but next time --”
“Well, I don’t see vampires,” Mike chuckled with forced airiness, trying to lighten up the mood. Sherlock tuned out the others who began to fight over who was going in next. Pity they ignored his literary rant. Stoker’s Dracula belonged among few of the classical books Sherlock bothered to read as an adolescent. Though that was due to the fact that his older brother liked the story.
Sherlock didn’t bother responding, instead opting to hurry up the enchanted stairs. John had to run to catch up with him. They stood in silence as the stairs moved to get them to another set. “John, I’d like you to accompany me on the task of befriending Rubeus Hagrid,” he said eventually. He weighed what Lestrade had said. While it was true that he didn’t mind others despising him, this time his reputation could marr his goal.
Where were the brothers right now? Anticipation flooded his vessel, tickling at his skin. He wanted badly to see that the Winchesters are alright and in good health. Were they angry at him? It didn’t seem so. Dean at first, but Cas sensed a feeling of relief and fear too, strangely enough. Or his grace did.
“That’s…. Sappy,” Irene smiled, bumping him in the shoulder. “All that love is getting to your head.”

“You Europeans are crazy,” Wilkes laughed, although his peers seemed more uncomfortable than happy to listen to his berating jokes.
,” a familiar voice coming from the darkened, shadowed entrance announced. John quickly crowded Irene behind him, shielding her and the chocolate statue of Hirsch from the unknown threat.
But the room they were in served its purpose, and none of them acted up. Until now, it seemed. Fuck. At least he’ll catch them in the act this time around. He was supposed to when the doll display was up a few years ago, but that didn’t go as planned.
John let out a sigh, patting the wardrobe to grab a pair of shorts. So what if Irene was a lesbian? He doesn’t flail about in his underwear only in front of anyone. “Listen, I don’t know exactly why I said I’ll go.”
“Well…” Cho started, crossing arms across her chest to stop the shivers. Cedric offered her the rest of the hot chocolate, but she refused with a warm smile of her own which he reciprocated. “Slytherin and Gryffindor don’t get along in general. And well, Harry has this rivalry going on with this other boy - Draco Malfoy? Padma Patil has her sister Parvati in Gryffindor, so she could tell you more about that. But the tension gets worse before Quidditch matches for sure.”
drinking liquid sugar,” Donna warned the Doctor, scribbling out the letter ‘v’ in those pointy brackets. Sherlock tapped his marker against his cheek.
Irene regarded the WCs nearby warily, questioning the man’s sanity. And his sense of smell. Random encounters like this made her realise how much she valued her madman of a brother. And modern, civilized toilets and bathrooms they had at the Shack. She eyed the man suspiciously, and when she got a good look at his face, she gasped.
Sherlock could feel the whites of his eyes flash at her while his irises rolled to see the inside of his skull for proof that intelligent life existed. “That’s not what I meant. I don’t think your date is what she seems to be.” He pointed a thumb in the mystery journal’s direction, which got her interest.
“Dunno, I’ll ask,” John said, tapping away on the keyboard, vibrations the only sound in the room. He sent the message and tossed the phone on Irene’s bed. Sherlock sat down on the floor, back resting against the side of his bed. John settled himself on his mattress, close so that he could peer over Sherlock’s shoulder. He tried not to shudder when John’s breath tickled the skin where neck meets shoulder.
Then why couldn’t he face Mary and say a simple no? It frustrated him to no end as he racked his mind up about it. He didn’t recall being this antsy over Mary, ever. Even during or after their breakup. But why bother? Maybe this was a problem that had to do with his upbringing; there weren’t many times when he was allowed to say no and stand up for himself when it regarded interpersonal relationships. Perhaps it grew into a habit in a couple areas of his life. However, he was over Mary, and apart from this small inconvenience, she had no power over him. Never had. He won’t let this fiasco weigh him down.
For a long time the castle was buzzing with news about every trial that was being conducted by the Ministry. John, who was no more interested in pointless wizarding politics than Sherlock, still asked how the Ministry functioned and all the details. Lestrade took it upon himself to educate him, so that saved Sherlock the necessary dismissal.
“I’m kidding! I’m kidding. She’s going to grow up like a spell cast righteously by one of those Disney bippity boppity blah-blahs or what have you.”
“Shh, that’s alright. I’d do the same thing. Next time, text me immediately. Okay? Even if something
John and Sherlock exchanged a fed up glance and glared at him simultaneously from where they were now sitting on the floor.
"I don't see what the fuss is about," Sherlock said flatly, taking two steps at a time as he led them to the library. He navigated the magical stairs better than any First Year, and John was glad for that. "All those carols, and sweaters, and cheery, fake attitudes - it's repulsive."
by Neil Gaiman sat inconspicuously under the bed, a yellow t-shirt masking the cover’s lower half. Irene chuckled to herself. She’d seen the show and read the book over hundreds of times. Or not. She lost count.
“Can I help you?” Mary said prudently. She made no effort to greet Irene or offer her a seat. She turned a page of the magazine she was reading. Her body language showed no signs of being intimidated or bothered, so Irene mirrored her. There’s no backing away. She’ll get John out of her claws, she promised. Or rather, insisted.
“Where do you think you’re going, weather boy? Soon my Barbie army will dominate this house and return it to its original state of being. And then, once you’re
“Be nice,” John nudged him with his knee, shooting him a disapproving raise of an eyebrow. “It’s not their fault Greg’s car is smaller than Wilkes’ IQ.”
"Dunno, but Carl may tell us," Greg shrugged, then turned to Sherlock. "And how have you been, genius?"
“Don’t tell me I’m wrong! Why did you agree? I get that you were being polite, but you’ve got to have healthy boundaries.”
belong on pizza,” John said stubbornly, taking the menu away from the confused Greg. “I’d rather have corn on it than pineapple. Or spinach.”
“Cool-cool-cool-cool-cool. Well. I’d still like to stay in hiding if you don’t mind? I just want to reveal myself when I feel like it.”
Just an additional note - I have been reminded yesterday that the Bee Movie exists, and I definitely plan on Cas watching it in this fic. Just so you have something cursed to think about in the meantime!
“Because we can’t risk an item suddenly going berserk on us, Sherlock,” John told him, nudging his ankle under the table. Sherlock’s shoulders sagged and he made puppy eyes at him.
“You’ll find out,” John smiled in his curls, planting a kiss there. Sherlock melted into their embrace, his body a goo of gummy bones and fluids. “But I’ll be honest, I’ll be surprised if you’ll push through it. The age category is nine to twelve years old, we’re older than that.”
“Alright, Shorty,” Sherlock smirked, ducking away from John who prepared to whack him with an old dirty cloth.
Nicolas Cage bent in his misshapen form to take the knife which Sherlock dropped. Unlike the other dolls which had only the thumb separate from their hand, he had all five fingers that moved as he wished them to. Quite a good design.
“Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff!” Billy awed, throwing himself over Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock huffed, completely taken aback by the display of uncalled affection. “I knew you could do it! Ever since you said you’re a detective in the car!”
“I’VE SEEN HER! I’VE SEEN HER AGAIN!” the guy yelled, running from person to person, invading their personal space to scream in their faces. He ran about the beach, making a mess in general of the place, but the people didn’t seem too bothered. He giggled inappropriately when he emerged next to John and Sherlock, rubbing his hands together. “THE LEGEND WAS TRUE! THE CURSED GLORIA SCOTT HAUNTS THE LAKE AT NIGHT! Y’ALL BETTER SKEDADDLE AWAY BEFORE SHE DRAGS YOU INTO YOUR WET GRAVE, HEEHEE!”
!” Sherlock screamed, snapping the journal shut and throwing it to the side automatically. He threw himself back, eyes wide, heart frantically beating faster than the beat of ‘
“When Henry started going out, he was…. different. As you may have seen him now. He became eccentric and he started using those weird ‘skedaddle’ words and whatnot. His dad didn’t take it well. Still doesn’t. He had planned to make Henry take on the family business so he could retire early, but that’s out of the window for as long as this continues. And seeing how today went down, I think it is obvious things aren’t heading in the right direction.”
Next update to how John's unwilling dinner with Mary will arrive on the *looks at wrist where I have no watch* 30th November! Stay tuned~
Before the ghoul saw it, she drew her gun and shot him between his eyebrows. Strong, pungent smell of gunpowder filled the air, echoes of the shot ringing in Mary’s ears. She aimed at the other ghoul while his friend staggered lifelessly to the cold hard ground. There was no blood splattering, no gasp, no scream. The remoteness of this area would cause no trouble with the local police department since no locals lived in these parts.
John threw his backpack over his right shoulder and jerked his head to the entrance for Sherlock to follow. “I will be able to see your boogers if you’re taller than me.”
Irene brushed her teeth and listened intently. Nothing, not even Lestrade’s coughs accompanying his smoking. Did they leave somewhere without her?
“Sure, keep telling yourself that,” Janine patted Irene on the cheek. Heat crept up her neck, a silent vow of fury ready to be unleashed if needed. “Listen,
Greg stayed silent for a while, humming tiredly as his brain caught up and rewired. When he looked up at John, his nephew grimaced. Greg was the embodiment of tiredness. In this light, his greying temples became more pronounced, though it didn’t necessarily make him look older. Just fed up with the world.
did he know? And was this for real? Considering that in general the Slytherins rooted for him, this couldn’t be fake. They don’t want him to fail, that much he gathered from their constant taunts of the Gryffindors and their childish rivalry. This couldn’t not be true. He hoped. Because if Draco handed him the four names of the dragons, then that narrowed his research considerably.
Dean yawned loudly, stretching his arms widely. “Were you being a creep in the shadows near his closet too?”
Intriguing! Dean liked the idea of it. He’s seen enough fucked up shit in his life, more than Greg can probably dream about, so that might fuel a streak of genius. “Yeah, sure! I’ll be happy to help.”
“She’s from Texas?” Irene said to John incredulously. He shrugged. Not that it ever mattered. Actually, she had a clear, universal American accent outside of her job.
“You’re welcome. I may need to read up more on the flower. There’s no point in us staying here longer, and I can see you’re eager to get to bed. At least we don’t have to worry about the flower being discovered, no one else is that adventurous to come here.”
“Yes, okay - but slow down and take a breath,” John said, nudging Sherlock’s knee. He had a bad habit of getting himself worked up and forgetting to breath until he was gasping for air. Thankfully, Sherlock listened this time and took a while to calm his erratic breath. “So the student couldn’t have done it - why expel him?”
“Look, you don’t have to drive us, really,” John said hastily. He scratched his dried hair with a touch of embarrassment. “We don’t want to be a bother.”
, well…. That was going to be dangerous. Luckily the job on the generator won’t be difficult, Greg had to conduct far worse recalibrations in his fifteen years of speedrunning this weird portal game. At least there isn’t cake to freak him out.
“It’s alright,” he said, “you just want a friend, right?” The dodo meeped in agreement, if a bit sadly. John cuddled him tighter but carefully so as not to hurt him. “Aw. Don’t listen to Sherlock, he’s gullible too.”
Sherlock eventually comes out of his bedroom, but when he does it’s almost worse. John had hoped that a long sleep would have helped him, but it’s clear he’s not slept at all, although he’s got the glassy eyed look of a man sleepwalking. He ignores all casework or offers of it, leaving John to helplessly field increasingly panicked phone calls from Bryant.
John sleeps in Rosie’s room that night and doesn’t come back downstairs. Sherlock doesn’t sleep at all, his mind spiralling, trying to work it out. Things seems worse on each go-round. It’s just paperwork, isn’t it? It shouldn’t be this unsettling to either of them. John shouldn’t have blown it out of proportion, not into a question of
“Wait,” John says, an idea growing. “What about someone who worked in a shop or garden centre? Are there any of those nearby?”
But John didn’t even have time to turn fully before the other man plunged the blade into his back. Time seemed to stop as John teetered on the edge of the pier, illuminated by a single yellow safety light, and then fell soundlessly into the freezing black water.
,” John says, grabbing his coat and pulling Sherlock down to him, kissing him heartily, hungrily, gratefully. Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise, then he gives himself up to the kiss and returns it eagerly. They break apart only when neither can go without oxygen any longer.
But John holds on to him and instead of ridiculing him just beams. It gives Sherlock hope. He gives it another go.
Sherlock laughed, a genuine laugh this time. “So you’re jealous! That is a petty emotion. Kind of…common.” He took a step toward Moriarty.
She turns bright red. “Oh! No, I mean, I’m always glad to see you, just, you know, I thought, because he texted… anyway, I have the body ready for you.”
John doesn’t ask, but nods quietly. “Just let me get changed.” He takes a quick rinse and pulls on clean clothes, then follows Sherlock out in to the streets, head pounding, without the will to ask where they are going.
It was scotch and he hated scotch, but he didn’t care. The two men sat, nursing their drinks as the computer did its work. They had seen plenty of each other over the past three months, but they had always been brief meetings to a specific purpose. The silence between them was uncomfortable.
John shifted his jacket to casually reveal his weapon. “You know I am the right person, Mr. Božić  because you are a smart man,  a man who is not to blame for any lateness of Mr. Moran’s goods. And I will be sure to make sure he understands that when I bring the shipment to him.”
Either way, while John enjoys Victor’s company it is a relief not to be expected to uphold the normal duties of a guest or carry on extended conversation most of the time. He finds that, even if his investigation leads nowhere, he’s glad that he came. Still, after three days of idleness he’s more than ready when Victor finds him in the library to tell him he’s tracked down the disposition records of Friesland Petrol’s fleet.
“Don’t worry,” John tells him. “We’ll keep you out of the action. And rescuing your co-workers and boss will go a long way to testifying to your innocence.”
“Yeah. Right where you told us. Well, what’s the hold up? Fine.” He hangs up. “Gonna be a few, some trouble with the doors.”
The strain is starting to show. His face looks drawn and hollowed, with dark circles under his eyes. Sometime in the week since they’ve been home he’s dropped the crucial pound or two which takes him from slender to gaunt. And the sense of manic energy, restrained or not, which is his primary mode of operation other than sulking, is not present.
When they are finished, shuddering sharply only seconds apart despite Sherlock not laying a finger on John to bring him off, Sherlock rolls John on top of him and they lay there, chests together, breathing in sync. Sherlock seems to like having John on him like this, likes to feel the weight and heat and solidness of him to assure himself it’s real.
“Sherlock,” he breathed. “He did it, didn’t he? He went halfway around the world and rescued you! God damn it, that bastard.”
John chews his bottom lip, realising how insane this is. “All I know is what I’ve told you before… I can give another statement but otherwise I don’t see how I can’t do anything that the police can’t.” His heart sinks a little. He’d been hoping for something to actually help explain what had happened, what had driven Sherlock to…to the end.
IT DOESN’T MATTER IF IT WOULD BE ENOUGH. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING. AND I WOULDN’T GIVE UP ON US, ON YOU, ON LIFE, OVER IT. I WOULDN’T DO THAT TO YOU. WE MEAN MORE THAT.
Then John comes home from a meeting with Mycroft to an envelope of breadcrumbs and news the Ambassador’s children have been kidnapped, and it all goes bad so quickly that he cannot quite comprehend it. They both know, instantly, that this is Moriarty’s doing, but neither will say it. John hopes, prays, he is wrong, that it is just a normal case,  that they will find the children and all will be well.
“Abel?” She giggles as if the man himself is a joke. “No, he’s not in today – hardly anyone is. I could take a message, or you… could leave your phone number and I could call you up when he’s here. Or….some other time?”
Ear poisons, great, fine. He starts reading determinedly and, thankfully, she remains silent. Although he hates the hungry, speculatively look with which she continues to scrutinise Sherlock.
John can tell Sherlock admires this criminal mastermind, whoever it is. “He’s brilliant, John!” Sherlock exclaims more than once. “Framing someone is hardly new, but this is a whole other level. He must be trying to knock out all his enemies two by two.”
“Piece of cake,” he mumbled to himself, not at all optimistic. He had no idea how he was going to do any of that, but he hadn’t come this far to give up. Sherlock was there, he was certain of it. And he was going to find him alive and unharmed. Then John might murder him for all he’d put him through, but that was really a low priority at this point.
One night, Sherlock enters John’s room, late as usual but with uncommon hesitation. John is already in bed, reading and wearing only pyjama bottoms, and Sherlock is in his favourite dressing gown. He approaches the bed almost solemnly, and John puts down his book as Sherlock wordlessly climbs on top of him, straddling his lap, and kisses him deeply, gentle but determined, hands cupping John’s face. It is passionate and sensuous, but there is something sad about his manner.
When John first felt Sherlock move inside him, he was completely undone. He had never experienced anything like it before and almost couldn’t process the sensation. Sherlock was so warm, so very warm, filling John so completely that John thought he might dissolve away happily into dust, then and there. Sherlock’s hands, one of his shoulder, one on his hipbone, burned on his skin and he pressed himself back into his friend, wanting to feel every centimetre. He felt whole in a way he never had before. He didn’t want it to end, though the release when it did, Sherlock’s hand wrapped around him, shuddering to a stop deep within him, was exquisite.
John takes a deep breath. “I understand. I do. I’m not sure it works that you can just turn your feelings off when you stop sleeping with someone though,” he points out.
“Right now,” John said, going into the kitchen and removing a supply of emergency cash from an old tea tin. “Would you prefer that I waited?”
, so intent on showing off and so focused on what he thought was the real case. He had caught every detail and yet still missed the essence of what was right in front of him. Moriarty was good, but Sherlock should have been better. Still, Moriarty had been showing off as well. He replayed that scene over and over again. It held the key, he was sure now. But where was it?
Before John quite knows what is happening, Victor has thrown his arms around John’s neck and is crying softly into his shoulder.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and closes his book. “Don’t mention it. It’s…fine.” He stands and offers John a hand up. “I think perhaps we should both get some rest.”
He knew many of their acquaintances treated them as a couple, and he never corrected them, though John always did. It wasn’t that he wanted people to believe that they were, he just didn’t see the point in trying to change their minds. He was uninterested in labels or definitions. Did it matter what others thought the nature of their relationship was, as long as they knew? But did they know? Did
He scowls. "And what should I take from the fact that my loving fiancée is so pleased that I'm finding myself in mortal danger?"
John's nipping at the spot under his hair where Sherlock's skull attaches to his spinal column, and it drives him to distraction as always, making his whole upper body tingle. John is draped over him completely and the spot where his cock is digging into Sherlock's skin is hot like a flesh wound.
He throws his arms wide, expansively, on the bed and commands, "Sherlock Holmes, tell me you love me!"
“Then what are you doing? What is… all this?” he gestures, indicating the retrofitted tanker as a whole.
, Sherlock, they said he'll be fine. He just needs rest and fluids." Mary's using her professional voice on him, the one she reserves for flighty patients and children.
Sherlock frowns, clearly hoping John would share what he'd learned first, but doesn't argue. "Her real name is unknown, but she works for an organisation known as Les Butineuses."
John looks down into the heart-shaped face, soft and snub-nosed, framed by wild obsidian curls. Her very earnest attempt to appear obedient and submissive is belied by the current of nervous excitement she can’t quite disguise and a slight upturning at the corners of her mouth that speaks to nothing so much as Sherlock when he’s plotting something.  “Um… well…” She blinks up at him sweetly from under dark lashes and he melts. “We’ve decided…that… you may go out with Trevor. But there are going to be some rules.”
WOULD I THOUGH? I KEEP ASKING MYSELF THAT AND I DON'T LIKE THE ANSWER I GET. I'M AFRAID OF THE MAN I WAS YESTERDAY. AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO.
John continues his search, debating whether it’s worth trying to access Bryant’s computer while he’s out or just wait until he returns and explain himself. His glance falls beside the keyboard, on an employee ID card strung on a lanyard, laying forlorn and abandoned. It’s Bryant’s, complete with unflattering picture and personalised bar code.
He's sprawled on his back on the wood floor of the bedroom-cum-lab, and he turns his head painfully to see John beside him, a few feet away. John is face down, unconscious but breathing deeply, pulsing with a soft anaemic glow around his prone form. There is a three inch needle sticking out of the back of his head and an accompanying dried trickle of blood down his neck that makes Sherlock shudder involuntarily and reach behind his head to feel the deep bruise in the same spot..
. What did it mean? Why didn’t he know? Moriarty acted like he should know. He should ask Moriarty. Where was Moriarty? Not here. Not at the pool. Not anywhere. He was gone, like a ghost. Sherlock felt like a ghost. Maybe if he was a ghost he could find him. But ghosts don’t have hearts, nothing to burn. He wouldn’t need to ask. But then he’d never know, and he’d be a mad ghost. Like Moriarty.
John swallowed, attempting to contain the rage that was again rising inside of him. “So what you are saying,” he said, his voice clipped, “is that you have come here to tell me that the man I thought was dead for the past three months, has been alive and well for at least two of those months, but may in fact be…dead…now.”
One side effect of the relationship that John really should have foreseen is Sherlock moving from possessive (which he has been since day one), to maddeningly, viciously possessive. No woman who dares to speak, smile, or, God forbid,
me before you test things…” John mutters. “But it’s not always like an old photo when I’m not around you…is it?”
They’ve merged bank accounts, but as about 80% of the money in it is from Sherlock, John still feels strange spending on anything other than household necessities. Still, Sherlock’s got his trust fund and the only other option is to ask Mycroft, and since John never counts his part in cases when adding things up, he figures he’s not out of line to spend a bit, particular if it’s on Sherlock himself.
He pauses, trying to think how on earth to go about this. “Look, you told me last night that you are careful with me, right? You try to protect me, you don’t like it when I’m hurt. Why is that?”
Sherlock finally gets John’s cardigan and shirt off of him, but before he can explore the new landscape John turns the tables on him, gets him on his back, shirt fallen completely open now, and begins tracing patterns on Sherlock’s chest and stomach with his tongue, hands sliding up and down his side, outlining his slim figure. Sherlock puts his deft fingers to work on John’s belt and begins to unbuckle it, and John makes a filthy sound and rolls off him on to his side, allowing Sherlock to remove his trousers, to reach into his pants and free him at last.
“No, Sherlock. It doesn’t matter, right? None of it matters.” He tears the rubber tube off Sherlock’s arm, hikes up his sleeve as far as it will go and ties off, grabbing the used needle off the bed and looking for a vein. “What happens to you, happens to me. I told you I’m not leaving you, and I can’t sit here watch you destroy yourself so I might as well fucking join you! Your blood, my blood, what the hell!”
“Hold on. I need a minute.” John takes a few measured breaths. He had put away all thoughts of anything like this weeks ago. He thought the moment where it might have been something beyond companionship had passed for good, and he had buried any other feelings he might have as deeply as he possibly could. Sherlock had been very clear about what he wanted – or didn’t want – and John had accepted it, happily even, relieved at not having to navigate the thorny topic of his own sexuality, even if part of him did yearn for more.
Of course it could just be a quirk, John thought – lots people have oddly specific tastes in certain items, but why something so obscure from a city he seemed to have no connexion to? It had to be something more than just a preference for a certain brand of smokes. Sherlock had certainly thought so, unless some other clue that had escaped John’s notice had led him to Croatia. But how to find out? Asking about Moran directly seemed like a dangerous proposition. He would have to go the route of the confidence man, he decided. Making sure his sidearm was in place but hidden, he zipped up his jacket and pushed through the door into the dim little shop.
Sherlock withdraws with a cough, replacing the shower curtain. John doesn’t have enough energy to be furious. There is silence, then Sherlock says, “It’s been 267 days.”
"Do you want to know how I knew, for certain, that it was you?" Sherlock asks mildly, as if inquiring about the weather. "The train station. Did you give yourself away on purpose?"
Sherlock shuts the door on the boy without acknowledgement or thanks. He pulls the curtains shut and rips open the padded envelope. It contains a data stick, a burner phone, and a note on paper he can quickly identify stationary from the offices of MI6: "Hide better."
He leans over and carefully removes the needle the needle from John's neck, staunching the fresh flow of blood with his shirt cuff. John flinches just the barest bit in his sleep but doesn't wake. He looks like he will sleep for a long time now.
And then John is with him again, loosing his bonds. He covers Sherlock in kisses, soft ones, all over his throat and shoulders and face, winding his arms around him and talking so incredibly delicately into the soft skin behind Sherlock's ear.
The day passed fairly quickly for John, more quickly than days had been passing for him. He had some work to do for Lestrade, requiring a large amount of background research on degenerative bone disorders, which was a good distraction. He had tea with Mrs. Hudson, who mercifully did not mention his visitor, although he was certain she knew all about it. She rambled on about drama at her bridge club and he allowed himself to be soothed by the steady stream of meaningless chatter.
There is no answer except the sound of a body being flung violently onto the sofa. John ventures into the sitting room and is unsurprised to see Sherlock facedown there, with his legs bent up at ninety degrees and one arm slung over the back cushion.
“Because I was there!” he exclaimed angrily. “You want me to relive it for you, so you can convince yourself? Okay. I saw him jump and fall 8 stories to the pavement. I heard his body hit the ground. I got his blood all over me, I felt for a pulse that wasn’t there, and I saw his lifeless face staring up at me with nothing behind his eyes. I’m the one who identified the body for the police, and I’m the one who buried him. Is that what you wanted to hear? Are you content now?”
Miss Callan looks entirely unabashed by the tongue lashing, although somewhat put out as John switches his attentions to her superior.
“I…thought it easiest, for you. I didn’t want you to have to go through that twice. It was for your own good.”
With difficulty Sherlock controls himself. “I want you, John. Right now.” He leans towards John again, but John fends him off.
Sherlock seemed relieved that the cultural debate of the twenty-first century was over, but not for long. “Do you see how many different species are here? Even the terror birds, though they seem most pacifist in nature. See that individual over there?”
“As you all probably noticed, I am your new professor for Potions,” Snape said pedantly, his voice barely above whisper, but they could hear him clearly. “I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the fine art of this subject, mainly because I am aware that young wizards and witches these days don’t pay attention to anything that doesn’t include swishing their wands around.”
“Honestly, Irene! He’s a dog, a bloody dog! Of course it’s easier to find certain clues better, he has heightened sense of smell like all canines do. Plus, he’s closer to the ground.”
“I worked hard to scam this off those Idaho tourists yesterday, so don’t let them get back at you, alright?” Greg told her as he pushed a conveniently thick stack of paper notes in her hand.
Perhaps she could taunt him about it. See what effect it would have. Except it wasn’t Sherlock sitting on his bed, but Castiel, and he was intently watching her from the opposite mattress, a lighter in hand. Irene sat up frantically, not expecting their new friend to sneak in here. Not that she was in a compromising state of being, but the principle stood.
“Don’t be dramatic, John,” Sherlock sighed, in an ironically melodramatic fashion. He frowned at his reflection in the window, something akin to unsureness passing his features. He shuddered, shaking his head and looked at John with those piercing, deducing eyes. “And anyway, I have you to save me, don’t I?”
Sherlock remained silent, but determined. His left leg came flying forward and almost squared John in the crotch, but thanks to his fast reflexes he was able to avoid the additional pain. Oof.
That startled a chuckle out of Greg. “Yeah, Millie would whack you on the head for that. But seriously, I can’t cut off business like that. The museum gets the most profit, then the merch. I have to make the most out of my summers, boys.”
Greg hummed in agreement, blinking to keep his eyes open. That case in Florida almost two decades ago seemed like a fever dream. What he and Mycroft thought was simple exorcism turned out to be a demon and his self-constructed army that took up drug trade on the East Coast. Honestly. But it went smoothly, relatively, once they got an insider -- Hudders -- on their side after careful negotiating. They had had an angel help them out as well, which sounded ludicrous, but hey. Florida had many surprises. And yeah, Florida Man was a bit too much to handle back then, but Greg was back for his teeth now. His life was crazy. At least in retrospect. He had only himself to reflect on it fully, what with Mycroft being….
Sherlock huffed, but relented, and John led Cas out of the room with them while John chugged the cold liquid. Irene shed the towel, throwing it on Sherlock’s bed to assert sibling dominance, and went to pick her outfit. Today she felt like a dress kind of gal. She packed five dresses, and the weather gave her the impression that it was ideal for a 1950s design. She had two of those, but which colour? Sky blue or green? Her inner Slytherin hissed assertively at the sight of the latter choice, so she rolled with it. Ambitious and determined it is. Irene put on her underwear and then the dress.
“Thanks for getting me out,” he said. “Honestly, what’s wrong with them? Potter can be potentially a target of some killer and they don’t even flinch at that.”
“You would do that?” Marina squealed happily. “Thank you! I shall repay you by sending you letters in bottles and sea horses!”
“THERE’S SOMETHING WITH BACON?” Greg gasped, hurrying over to get another look at the menu. “We have to get that! I love bacon!”
Shivers ran down his spine when he realised Snape was watching him intently, his head propped up on his hand. The professor settled behind his desk to tend to some paperwork, possibly grading essays already, but he stopped to see what he and Sherlock were doing. Evidently the eagerness with which the Ravenclaw boy moved about, carrying the ingredients caught his attention.
“What in the hell are you doing?” he hissed, throwing his legs over the couch’s edge. “How did I get here?”
“Seeing things, Holmes?” Wilkes called out teasingly. He bared his teeth in a sneer, standing up. He puffed out his chest, and John had the need to trip him. “Are you getting scared of vampires? Boo! Ha, scared yet?”
“Quick, let’s find something that may help us solve this,” Sherlock said as he set out to inspect the cave.
“I think I heard of it,” John said, nodding, crossing arms across his chest. “Never listened to it, though. Nothing from Broadway, to be honest.”
EDIT: changed Occlumency to Legilimency, as that was an error on my side - Occlumency is protecting your thoughts from Legilimency, as @annemedwards in the comments pointed out, thank you again! :)
Silence. Greg’s bags under his brown eyes darkened as he tipped his chin forwards in acknowledgement. Mrs Hudson’s equipment shan’t be taken lightly. “I have work to do.”
Thank you everyone for reading, we'll be shortly over 400 hits and whoooooo! cookies, take them! Stuff yourself! It's good for you~
“Well - I am now!” John growled, swatting Sherlock’s hands away. His ears rang unpleasantly. He rubbed his face to shake out the bare residue of a nap Sherlock had robbed him of. “Be quiet or the librarian will throw us out!”
Eventually they made it to the north of the island, having circled almost the whole of it and tracking criss-cross it as well. And there, where they could see a slim passage leading up to the small waterfall, was a vast space of the lake reflecting the sun. As if there were an invisible barrier separating the island from the rest of the world. At the border of the beach and water was a small, rotting cottage. It had no roof, not counting the few support beams leaving space for imagination as to make out the shape of the would-be top of the shabby ruins. The rock walls were slimy and covered in moss, which reminded Sherlock of England and its secluded places like this one, though less eerie.
John followed the walked pathway, breathing the fresher air in through his nose. Ah, that felt better. He will walk for another hour or so and then settle for the night at the outpost.
He shook his head as though to shake off the conversation he'd had with his sister and then he joyfully jogged down to the kitchen and joined his family.
“I’m telling you the truth, Mary,” she said, holding up her palm as a peace sign. “And I would never lie to keep John from enjoying himself. But he doesn’t. Enjoy himself, I mean. Not when you force him into social gatherings and are pushy and demanding.”
“I’m going outside,” he announced, getting to his feet. He needed a smoke -- badly. “I’ll be back soon.” Sherlock quickened his pace near the exit, when he felt his foot stumbling against an unforeseen obstacle. He did a sort of undignified skip to avoid tripping, getting a snort or two from the other customers.
Inside, they settled into a stall in the middle of the diner, Sherlock sat near the window, Irene graciously sliding in next to him while Mrs Hudson seated herself on the opposite side of the cubicle. Since it was lunch, a number of people came in to eat the cook’s delicious meals. After a short reading of the menu, Irene made up her mind and said she’ll have a french toast. Sherlock chose to go with the omelette.
” a gravelly voiced Barbie greeted them, hopping on the coffee table. Cas squinted at the plastic figure. The Barbie had long golden locks and a black sparkly dress, but she had another, manly face glued to her own.
On this fateful day, their second day at the Mystery Shack, Irene could be found crouching behind a shelf displaying small figurines of Sascrotches, as Lestrade took to naming the lame creature resembling a giant hairy ape wearing a pair of slippers and a piece of white underwear.
“Then how come John is able to see them?” Sherlock questioned, casting a worried glance in said boy’s direction. John was out of depth himself. Irene blinked.
He entered the house and went to check up on the museum. They were supposed to open it tomorrow - er, today - if everything went smoothly. The lights flicked on, and Greg stood, shell-shocked.
“Ah. I’d forget. Mike wasn’t kidding when he said that workload gets worse by the year. It’s distracting.”
But this also meant that Sherlock forged an emotional bond with the puppy and the mother. He won’t give them up. He would if an owner showed up, but that seemed unlikely.
“Nope,” John said, popping a grape in his mouth. “Haven’t had time yet. McGonagall flooded us with another Transfiguration essay, remember?”
“Oh, please! Pretty please, Greg,” she begged, pouting and putting on her best puppy-eyed stare, hands clasped together in a prayer gesture.
“So, what exactly happened today?” he asked, hugging his right leg. He shuffled closer to Sherlock so that he could see the journal better. Sherlock coughed into his fist, adjusting his position a little and then he got to explaining. How Sherlock found it, that its author is unknown and either dead or missing (not exactly a calming piece of information). There were other creatures documented besides pixies or vampires, but the journal was unfinished. It cut off approximately halfway through with a cryptic message saying that the author was discovered.
His brother gave him a look, clearly aware of his weak-ass attempt to change the topic. “It was delicious. You know, I had my doubts about Aunt Martha, but they’re passing. I like her. Though I’m still on my toes regarding her, what with what happened in Adam’s case.”
“My point is, confront him directly. Go look for him. Don’t let him hide with his insecurities. Come on, shoo, go find your boyfriend.”
John gave Greg a rundown of yesterday's action before Sherlock would get fussy over his 'incompetence'.
First he smoothed out the lapels on his nice blue shirt and brushed off a wayward dust speckle he acquired somewhere in the meantime. His hair was messy as per usual, but for permits and fake cards they needed something formal.
“He’ll get around to it. They’ll be back soon enough. And then John will shower you in gifts and whatever else you need. Ew, wait --”
“Oi! Don’t let her hear you,” Greg shushed him, smiling into his mug. “Yeah, I know. But she’s the one who insists on doing it. I’ll help her, of course. I know how to handle tools, and I agree that Mrs Hudson shouldn’t be the sole person who oversees and does the reparations. And besides, if we’re capable of DIY-ing ourselves, why hire somebody else?”
It was John’s turn now to playfully tease Sherlock about whatever he left unsaid and hanging up above them. “Hey, if I had to come clear about your scented shampoo, then you should finish your sentence too.”
Cas raised an eyebrow at the very eloquent response and shot the radio another contemplative look but relented… or so Dean thought. Cas took it upon himself to test Dean’s patience, and the two played a game of tic tac toe where Cas quickly shot out his arm to twist the button to the right, raising the volume, and Dean repeated it, but in reverse to lower it. This went on for a while until Dean finally snapped.
“What’s wrong?” he had asked, confused. He inspected his cup thoroughly, brows knitted into a frown.
“So,” John continued. “You fell asleep at night two days ago, as I said. Your fever broke, but you were shivering a lot. I had trouble regulating your temperature, you merfolk sure are a little more complicated than us.” He let out a small laugh, and Sherlock liked the sound of it. Will he laugh again? Merfolk rarely laughed, and even that was a polar opposite of this. John’s laugh was soft, if a little bitter, but pleasant. “I managed, however, and you survived. I used up half of my healing potions, though. I wasn’t sure how you would react to certain mixtures, so I had to introduce them one by one and hope you wouldn’t go into shock or get an allergic reaction.
“One more reason to keep it unharmed. Can’t have a fashion student find it soaking wet; I’d rather live to see another day.”
Curiously enough, she found Mary comfortably seated in a cushioned chair, facing the doors. She was dressed in a thin trench coat, pearls on her neck, hair done in a bun. Oh well. Irene had a feeling it would go to shit by the look on Mary’s face.
“Sam mentioned you are terribly fond of cowboys,” Cas said, crossing his arms. He seemed to be contemplating the idea. “But alright. I don’t see why not. It’ll be good to get to know human culture better.”
Henry's hoot put him out of his muggle-technology-induced trance as he waited for words of praise for such a good delivery. Sherlock reached into his trouser pocket and gave him a treat.
Suddenly, a flash of pain in his forehead twisted Cas’ face into a grimace. His wings fluttered but he focused on keeping them spread -- just in case -- but the unexpected throbbing pain spread into his temples and pounded on his skull as though it were a church bell. He felt himself shaking, his eyes fell shut and he tried to curl in on himself in a vainless effort to stop the unforeseen assault.
“Uhm, so far -- quite well,” he replied, shifting in his seat. He didn’t begin fully, he lacked the proper dissecting equipment, but he made do with a couple acquired kitchen knives. Not that Lestrade noticed. “Though of course it doesn’t quite add up to the data I’d have from
The Club and her Boss were… persuasive. She tied herself to the Club to get the love of her life back, but that proved to be more difficult than she’d have thought. Why worry? She
“Don’t worry, it’s not John,” she winked at him, which made him blush for some reason. He sorted himself out, goddammit. There’s no reason to blush! “
“Thank you,” Cas said softly. He observed his fingernails in the light of their ceiling lamp. “I like this. Is it common to paint your nails?”
"Exciting as in having a fan base or the potential of getting killed halfway through the Tournament so that people can bet and earn money?"
“But he couldn’t have been murdered because of the ring,” Sherlock thought out loud. He didn’t mention that the metal was some cheaper alloy. “He was unjustly convicted of a crime, taken away, and yet he still managed to ensure you knew he was coming back… Your hatred of sailors indicates someone close must’ve betrayed him, and you knew it before you died.”
“Oh! Of course!” He scuttled over to the furthest corner and handed her the phone, unharmed and with no additional scratch luckily for him.
John shuffled beyond the overpriced merchandise and disappeared in the house. He clearly knew his way around. “I’ll see you around, Sherlock!”
“We have to investigate further. We need more data. This is abysmal, but we have names to look up, and a suspect, albeit forty years later, to inquire about,” Sherlock said in a business-like way. “The school library may prove to have something else on the matter now that we can narrow our scopes. Additionally, we need to get our hands on the registrar of pupils from the forties. Who was the student that exposed Rubeus Hagrid? Who were the other students attacked? What kind of injuries? We have a lot of work to do.” He stopped to look at them, face serious. “I know John is willing to dedicate his time to the matter, but are you, Lestrade? We’ll probably spend a lot of time in the library, even more so probably breaking school rules if we have to sneak out after dark.”
Something shuffled on their right, and soon a deer with a fluorescent tail shot through the silent road, its eyes momentarily glowing in the golf cart’s faint yellow beams that served practically no purpose except attracting attention.
He’d barely pass for Sherlock’s type. Sure, he was muscular in all the right places, but he lacked the gracefulness that John, for example, carried himself around with. His clothes left a lot to be desired, his personal style opting for mundane sports items he draped over his body. He had shorts that were too big for him and made his legs look like sticks even if they were strong from participating in rugby, a washed out t-shirt in an awful sickly green shade, and
“Careful,” he huffed, holstering the item up and in the cart, noting the sunflower seeds. Weird. It’s as if he’s lived through this, he freaking feels it. He assessed Mrs Hudson, who wrought her hands together. “You alright? No twisted ankle?”
say he should exuberate more confidence, and frankly, his self-evaluation hinted he did an adequate job out of it -- but the what-ifs persisted.
"Of course we'll help," said Sherlock, looking away from John to the curious teens. "After all, this war on muggles and muggle-borns has always been awfully ridiculous - only I wish it could be just as easily magicked away as it is being promoted."
The merfolk was entangled in a net made of thick strands of rope, but that didn’t stop it from trying to get out of it.
Irene shivered, thinking back to their most recent encounter. “Bloody hell, tell me about it. We met him again two days ago.”
“Me too,” Sherlock said, leaning his back against the cheap plastic folding chair. John watched as he stretched, purple shirt tightening over his ribs. He licked his lips and rubbed his nose, prying his eyes from the gorgeous man next to him and focused on the yard.
Gloria froze, static building in the air like before a storm that has been holding out all summer, ready to wreak havoc.
“If you come back, I’ll buy more matches, shall I?” Mrs Hudson said in mock-caring tone, the one she would use for dumb tourists. “Or a flamethrower. That’ll be quicker. Don’t you think so, John?”
“I suppose,” he said, setting the newspaper down. “For the next…” - he checked the clock - “three hours approximately. She spent the night putting nail polish on the lamp on her bedside table.”
Mary’s phone buzzed, rousing her from her brainstorming. She reached for it, its pink case hurting her eyes under the sharp beam of light coming from her lamp. She tilted the head of the source of light so that it aimed at the wall and unlocked the phone. Just an instagram notification about more people following her. Not of importance.
“Oh, this is finally going to be exciting!” Sherlock said once they were out of the dungeons. Snape gave them homework to research uses of Flobberworm Mucus until next week.
- a Gravity Falls AU of Sherlock, a johnlock fic. You don't need to have watched the show to enjoy the fic :) Feel free to pop by!
“Alright, shut up, all of you,” Draco said loudly enough to be through the chatter. The older students sneered at him for interrupting, but they did shut up. “Can’t you see Selcout had enough? If he says Potter is telling the truth, we should trust him, no? He’s our Champion over all.”
“What? What for?” Greg looked perplexed. It was true that John had forgotten about it yesterday, but no harm was done.
Desperate kisses were exchanged as they grabbed at one another, groping and touching whichever part of the other they could get a hold of. A part of John’s brain had enough cognitivity left for him to kick the door shut, and then he was grabbing at Sherlock’s swimming trunks and pulling them down and off.
John nodded. She’d told him the story vaguely years ago. “I remember. But what’s the fond part of going to Florida, then?”
“They’re not in this world. Not yet, at least. They were checking up on me, apparently, but caused me no injury or loss of memory. They also said we will meet soon. I knew it wasn’t God, and then the being went on a small rant about how they’re better than Him and that He doesn’t care about us. Hasn’t for ages. They thought it would be ‘hilarious’,” -- Cas used exaggerated air quotes here -- “to snatch me but that He didn’t notice. They think of me as an investment for the future.”
“Nothing in particular but I have to check a few assignments,” he said, leaning his hip against the counter. Lestrade opened the light blue stained window to let the smoke out before Mrs Hudson came back and found out.
“How joyful,” Sherlock said, unsure of how to respond. Neither of them found anything incriminating on the dead remains, so they snooped around in the steady mysterious light of the cave.
“The squirrels want you to think that,” Hirsch replied, glancing sideways as if a mob of animals was supposed to drag him into the shadows and beat him to a plump. “But no. You see, my dear deer told me this would work -- and it did! Never underestimate der Hirsch.”
“Greg, can I remind you that the last time we did something mildly annoying to Donovan we ended up in county jail overnight?” said John, leaning back in the boat. It dipped backwards dangerously but he paid it zero attention. He held up his finger when Greg opened his mouth to protest, “And that was JUST a prank, calling the neighbours and advertising the nonexistent free Hogwarts train tickets. And, Sally is really after anyone’s neck as long as it’s her shift. She’s stuck here for the whole day. If she catches us - and you know she WILL keep an eye out - we will get fined AND possibly, probably, spend the night in county jail.
“No, I enjoy it. I’m just saying that the body can go on for longer periods of time without eating. It’s quite handy to train yourself out of it before exam time.”
When he lowered the book, he saw that the pixies had managed to tie Irene’s hands and legs up. “When I get out of this, I’ll break your fragile little wings off!” she threatened, struggling against the restraints.
He was shooed off by Professor McGonagall and sat down next to his classmates. Someone even patted him on the back as an encouragement. He looked up to see another kid be sorted into Slytherin and he searched the Hufflepuff table for his sister. He spotted her and she excitedly waved at him. Not far from her was Greg who gave him a thumbs up. He looked over the Ravenclaw table too, but the boy he had in mind was already piercing him with his bright eyes. He turned to the Headmaster of Hogwarts without any gesture of acknowledgement, John turning his attention Albus Dumbledore as well.
“Anyhow you imagine it to play out,” she said, one shoulder lifting. “Who’s going to ask the other out on a date first, when that’s going to be, where it’s going to happen…. There’s a lot to consider.”
“WELL, this is getting embarrassing,” Gabe pronounced, standing up. “Let’s go back and I’ll give you muffins so you lay off me. I had enough of your faces. Cas, I’ll keep in touch. Sherlock, John -- it was nice to meet you. Sam, Dean -- how was the TV?”
None of them cared about the hour. Irene brought out all the doll remains - some of them still moving - and tossed them into the fire instead of logs. Mrs Hudson brought out the s’mores and they munched on the sweetness in peace. It turned out that Mrs Hudson had gone back for her purse as she had told Nicolas Cage. She was feeling restless, so she went to see if the kids were still up for a cup of hot chocolate, and she overheard the confession of what had happened to the Other Greg.
Shoulders sagging, Irene nodded. “Fine,” she said, shrugging. “You’re right. Even though I think that magic wouldn’t let me die like this.”
“Let’s,” Sherlock panted, nuzzling into John’s hair above his left ear. John hugged him closer, burrowing his head into his shoulder, hand drawing lazy circles on his back. They stood like that for a while until another lightning urged them to set out to the Shack.
It happened rather swiftly. John minded his own business, he was walking along the corridor with Greg to lunch, when a pair of hands grabbed him and escorted him elsewhere without the Hufflepuff noticing.
“How do you do this? This is witchcraft,” Kate squinted at her. Her pen tapped angrily against the cashier’s desk. The magic trick was to always start in the middle. Apparently Kate had never ever played tic-tac-toe, so Irene decided to teach her. She specifically asked not to be coddled, so Irene delivered, though she was sneaky with her tactic, curious when Kate will catch onto her.
“Yeah, actually,” he said, and Sam slowed down the boat as they came to a halt at a tiny cold beach. The front of the boat bore into the wet sand, parting it and ruffling the sand particles in an inverted ‘V’ shape.
There was a ladder on one side, and a cold breeze wheezed out around their ankles. John went in first. The ladder wasn’t long, leading them perhaps ten meters underground. Irene took out her phone and flashed the battery so that they were able to see in the darkness.
The corridor had a burnt-out lightbulb, so it was dark save for the natural light streaming in from a small rectangular window at the end of it. The walls were decorated with useless junk accumulated over the years; a dusty grandfather clock; a grimy framed painting of a half-person, half-llama; a potted plant that was watered last when Ramses II was still alive and breathing; and a handful of cobwebs.
Perhaps it was time to breach the subject, once Greg returns from his vacation. Reminiscing could help him, and John would like to get to know this side of Greg. He hasn’t dated anyone since, but maybe talking about it would allow him to recover from it? He doesn’t say it, but as Cas pointed out, he seems to be brooding about things buried deep even now. John didn’t blame him.
John looked at his mom and Sherlock, who graced his brother with hate worthy of the passion of one thousand burning suns.
“He will. Now go, or I’ll really kick you in the shins,” Irene threatened, pointing at the doors. “Snog him silly and be decent!”
“‘S not my fault this prick ain’t cooperative,” the man spat in his heavy accent. “Listen - I’m gettin’ paid for delivering him to my boss. Get out of here before you get in trouble.”
John stopped, glancing at the pile of books they’d accumulated. He threw the backpack over his shoulder, taking the heaviest tomes into an awkward embrace. “I’ll make it quick,” he promised, telling Irene where to take the other books he couldn’t pick up. He ran up further into the library, trying to find a cart where he could deposit the historical books.
"What on EARTH were you thinking? Both of you?" she said, furious. She wore a night cap that overhung on one side. "I would quite understand if it were two Gryffindors named Potter and Black, but someone from Ravenclaw like you, Mr. Holmes, should know better than to wander off at night. You too, Watson. I would have never guessed you participated in such activities."
Later that night, when the storm that was holding off for weeks raged above London in all its mighty power and electricity was out, John and Sherlock sat in their bedroom, dozens of candles safely lit about the room. Sherlock had his head placed in John’s lap, who was now reading a thriller (Sherlock commented on it loudly every five minutes, spoiling a thing or two about the plot). Eventually John put the book aside and his fingers slipped into Sherlock’s damp curls, massaging his scalp.
“I say Rapunzel!” John shouted after her, eliciting a low chuckle from Sherlock. Irene took that into consideration. But now she, Greg, and Mrs Hudson needed to settle the Johnlock bet.
Yeah, he’ll do that as soon as they get out of this bottomless pit. From a literal pit to a more metaphorical, but still confounding pit full of unanswered questions that were piling up day by day.
"You promised that," Sherlock pointed out, turning a page in his Potions book. He wasn't exactly happy with it either and pushed it aside. "This is rubbish."
She stepped back, avoiding his hand he stretched out to steady her further. No, she needed to think about what was going on in her head without his logical interference. Not for long, just enough to brace herself for it. Sherlock’s rationale helped, but at least once she should let her emotional side deal with it first and not repress it.
If Seb were blessed with lesser, mortal, and slower reflexes, he would’ve been dead. A vampire at his left swiftly made an attempt to grab him, but he was faster. He pinned his hand to the wood, his demon knife cutting through the pale hand like butter, straight through the middle of the vampire’s palm. Hissing and grunted sounds of pain stumped the creature, and Seb took out an athame and threw it at a vampire opposite of him who lunged. The black knife hit him square in the face; not enough to kill it, but it gave him leeway for his next move.
“John and I like the apple and blueberry pies, and Irene likes the cherry one. If you mention you’re a friend of John’s you should get a discount at least, if not for free.”
Greg was dozing on the bed, limbs akimbo and his snoring disturbing his airways. He was still out of it.
Blake knew coming to Britain would be a slight culture shock. It was. He had somehow adjusted over the past five months, however, and considered himself quite blended in - at least until his accent gave him away. He was prepared for it all; the rounded r’s, the posh looks, the gloomy weather that was in truth quite lovely, hell, even the whole ordeal  of driving on the left as he observed muggles in London earlier in the year as he visited Diagon Alley.
“Your fear doesn’t concern me,” Sherlock said coolly, leading them upstairs. Lestrade shrugged, burping into his fist. He and John had the tendency to overstuff themselves like starved dogs.
John put Archie in the safety of his nightstand. Sherlock was glaring holes into him, but he reminded John of an adorable angry kitten. “Happy, Bumble?”
The doors were opened, welcoming him. He had a feeling his help would prefer them closed, so he did after stepping inside their living room. Sherlock Holmes was already seated in his black armchair, chin resting in his fingers, deep in thought.
“Because I’m an idiot who gets much too excited by beekeeping and honey even in less-than-adequate stores in vile malls you drag me to and who misunderstands what you say in the heat of the moment admiring honey?”
“First of all they allow me to travel vast distances in the blink of an eye,” Cas said. Sherlock took out the journal from where he put it in his backpack. He decided to take it along to put the plushies there. He jotted down what Cas was saying, adding to the blocks of information already noted from yesterday. “If you focus, it is possible to sense the presence of my wings. It can shield others if I want them to act like one; they’re quite strong and the feathers in my human form are impenetrable.”
“I just… forgot my underwear,” John said, gesturing at his drawers. He padded towards it, grabbed a fresh pair of briefs and sweatshorts, winked after overcoming his initial shock, and disappeared.
Indeed, he was elated to be leaving Hogwarts, not giving that girl an excuse to taint him and use Sherlock against him to get what she wants.
“Fucking hell,” Greg cursed, wiping his greasy fingers on the nearest pillow he got a hold of. He stood up with a grunt; his bones and back aching. He’s spent the last few days barely sleeping, slaving away downstairs in the basement labs. He had to weld an outer ring of the portal, and that took
Janine looked scandalized, but Kate gave zero fucks, and so did Irene. The crowd gasped at Kate’s bold words, but no one came forth.
“Fine,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “And… Thank you for coming with me. I know I said we’d sneak out earlier, but I have a potion experiment going on and…”
When John looked up, his eyes widened, and the chair fell backwards as he hurried to snatch a lighter Irene held under the crumpled paper. “No! Wait!” He knocked the item out of her grasp with a swat, taking the document back from her.
A knock on the front door intruded their afternoon domesticity. Redbeard made a run for it before either of them had a chance to react, and Grace followed her puppy, a low ‘woof’ serving as an interrogative ‘Who’s there?’ to the newcomers.
“It grows back after a while,” Sherlock continued, holding the lizard up to his gaze. It stuck its tongue out, sniffing the air while doing so.
“Don’t draw anything on his face,” he pleaded as Dean cast a contemplative look at Cas. “He’s suffered enough.”
She was a head shorter than him, brunette (frequently ironed hair, possibly, to straighten it; shoulder length, done in a bun), confident judging by her open posture and hands resting on hips. No rings on fingers -- single, or not in a serious relationship? No earrings either, or any jewels for that matter. Impractical during workout.
Mrs Hudson’s phone went off, and a picture of smiling Angelo appeared on the previously black mirror screen. She picked it up, still mildly blushing, and replied positively to whatever Angelo was talking about. Then she wished him a goodbye and hung up.
That startled a laugh out of Sherlock. “Improbable. Your growth spurt is long over, Irene. You’ve been this height since fourteen. I estimate you’re… hundred and sixty-four centimeters tall. That’d make Kate one-sixty-six. Not that different to the naked eye.”
“Music kept me company, though,” Freddie continued, and Sherlock had to agree. In the last two years, musicals were a balm for his soul when the days became unbearable and even his experiments weren’t satisfactory enough. “Queen and Bowie, all those twentieth-century bombastic grooves. I adopted the new name, taking it from our legend Freddie, since I got his voice now. Kinda unbelievable, but perhaps the universe did it for a reason. Years went by, and I did fine. But recently I started getting bored. And then
He retreated to the room overseeing the cave and the masterplan of his lifetime. He collapsed in a chair and limply reached for a water bottle he kept under the metal table. The plastic crinkle of it was gunshot loud in the vastly empty space as Greg gulped the water thirstily. It was refreshing, but not enough to grant him energy to go do another maintenance job. A burnout was creeping on him, he could feel its edges eat at his sanity and will to get up and work. He won’t push himself any more today.
“I decided to start collecting them,” she said, stepping back and tilting her head to look Greg in the eye as if to challenge her newfound passion. “I have my Union Jack flag at home, and I think I’ve got Wales too, but I could use a flag of the US.”
“They’re right,” Eddie chimed up, nodding. “This was one of the coolest show-offs I’ve witnessed, and I’ve been to a couple. You definitely killed it. Janine’s just rich and the majority of this town likes to suck the O’Learys’ ass.”
“You said you trusted Black,” Snape said, a hint of bitterness in his tone. “And they trusted him, too. If I had any idea…”
“Okay, you got me. That was a good one,” Irene said. “But yeah, Dean, no worries. You don’t have to be jealous of me. I don’t like dicks.”
The Great Hall was overflowing with students, it smelled of the most delicious food and one could feel the magic seeping throughout the room and Castle.
“Be my guest,” Sherlock said, tucking the journal in his backpack and handing it to John. He ignored his quizzical look and continued. “We’ll have to split up. One group should go and fetch the boat so we can get away quickly in case the other doesn’t succeed.”
Just as they were about to kiss, something cold and wet dropped on the tips of their noses. Sherlock blinked, nose wrinkling distastefully as he looked up. More droplets of water started showering them from the dark sky above, intensifying with each second.
No sooner than when Fleur disappeared the Hall went silent again. This was it. This was the peak every Hogwarts student had waited for since the announcement that the Tournament would take place here was made. Every House rooted for their own, naturally, however cordial they all pretended to be. Well, they weren’t exactly thrilled by the thought of having a Slytherin champion, though. Most of the student body agreed on that, no matter their reason.
John had let out an exasperated sigh, shrugging. He had a feeling this was a long time coming. “For a brief moment, yes. Then you sent me off to buy you cheap rip-offs of popular sodas. What’s your point?”
“Donna, you can’t play with the continuum and time like this -- not when TARDIS became systematically unresponsive for no reason!”
John tipped his head and smiled. “I’m sure he’ll appreciate it. He can pretend otherwise, but I know him. Did you enlist Mrs Hudson yet?”
Sherlock took that as a challenge. But -- he played dirty. A smirk curled his lips, and he swiftly wrapped his arms around John’s bent knee, tugging him off the bed. John’s fight or flight response kicked in, and a playful brawl broke out between them. They ended up on the floor laughing, John straddling Sherlock’s hips and pinning him down by the wrists.
"She won’t have any of that. You’re too skinny for her liking. She constantly tries to overfeed us, she’s not going to turn away from another prey."
“That’s one thing we agree on,” Sherlock murmured, rising from his chair. John followed in suit, the boys aiming it upstairs again, and they both dutifully ignored Greg’s amused smirk at the two of them.
Even though he can’t take Rosie’s kidnapping as something that’s exciting, because it isn’t. She’s gone and out of his reach and
Looking up at Cas from where he played with his bracelets, he pondered how to help him. His grace was back in full force but blocked, John was able to see his wings… things weren’t adding up. And Dean hated it.
“I know very well what I’m facing, and it’s a bunch of stupid, egoistic morons. Even religious missionaries would be less of a pain in the ass than you dickbags. Tell that
“I did, but John may have a point,” she shrugged. “We don’t know what it does with the human body, do we?”
. Hell no. But God, holding off on the things that he wanted to do with Sherlock was beginning to get harder and harder, no pun intended.
John blinked in surprise. He looked around them and the empty outside of the local home depot. Did he just dream everything? Perhaps he’s so out of it from all the pining his mind came up with a solution or hallucination to pass time. Fucking
“Sherlock, can you give me the tea we packed? It’s getting hotter,” John grumbled, rolling up the sleeves of his yellow shirt, exposing his forearms. As he turned to get it from Sherlock something sticky smudged across his cheek and chin. “What --”
“Lestrade, do you have relevant information on the Chamber of Secrets?” Sherlock breathed, hair muffled and sticking up at odd angles, a ghost of pillow creases pressed into his cheek.
“I didn’t, John told me,” Greg acquiesced, pointing a forefinger at the ceiling. “He may have mentioned the pairing of Doctor Strange and Iron-Man here and there.”
Cheering and gurgling sounds caught his attention. He lowered the papers and raised his eyebrows at the sight in front of him. John and Lestrade were pouring the entire contents of the maple syrup bottles into their mouths. Truth be told, he was taken aback - quite a lot.
