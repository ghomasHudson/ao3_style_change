Sam turned to Cas. "Have y'all heard laughter like that here before?" Cas shook his head. "Nothing weird has ever happened here. It's probably y'all since you said bad news follows you around."
He watched them grab their bags and exit the front door, the red of Dean’s ear tips still visible from the back and smirked as Cas continued ribbing his brother all the way to the car, before closing the door after he watched them drive off. Sending a quick prayer to a God that mostly liked to pretend He wasn’t to keep them safe, he then did his best not to worry about his brother and the angel.
The kitchen was bigger, probably because the space was both a kitchen and a dining room. There was a large table on one side of it that seated eight. "You guys host large parties or something?" Sam asked Gabe whom he'd followed in deeper into the house to get away from Dean and Cas's conversation. Gabriel nodded. "We do, actually. I like baking. Our friends like to come over and eat them. Sometimes I make edibles too. I have brownies right now. You want one?" He asked Sam, a mischievous look on his face. Sam felt like he was being tested. A part of him wanted to "pass" but not enough to eat a fucking weed brownie while on the job. Regretfully he shook his head. "Aw, don't tell me you're one of those Don't California My Texas assholes." Sam put his hands in his pockets. He was definitely not getting into a political debate, especially when he didn't even live in Texas. They were on vacation for Christ's sake. Of course, Sam's mind raced as he wondered if Gabe's brain retrained all the knowledge he'd had as an archangel. He couldn't help it, he had to ask, "I take it you're not one of those that wants to keep Texas a red state? No 'voting under God' for you?" Gabriel snorted. "I don't remember whether I was a believer or not but I get the feeling that while God is real he's long since checked out by now." That made a pang hit Sam's heart. Gabriel had no idea just how on the money he was. Perhaps he didn't understand why he felt the way he did but clearly his subconscious knew him and it had stayed with him. He was about to comfort Gabriel when Dean and Cas, apparently done with their orgy conversation joined them and Dean lifted the cake pan that was in the middle of the table. It wasn't cake. It was brownies. Before he could stop him, Dean grabbed two and stuffed them into his mouth.
Gabriel nodded vigorously. "I promise Sammy."
And with that the door busted open.
"So why were we brought back? And thank y'all for saving the world from the Apocalypse." Gabe shot Sam a genuine smile. Sam couldn't help but smile back but then it sorta melted and he let out a regretful sigh. "Look, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if we found y'all that means it's for a reason. Not only that but it means that your graces must be somewhere here on earth. Finding them and giving them back to y'all would bring all the powers back and probably the memories as your grace would automatically heal anything it sensed was wrong. As for who brought you back, I'm guessing it was your dad."
"So then what happened, Sammy? What'd they leave behind?" asked Gabriel settling back into his chair.
"I don't know, Dean."
"Did you like me as an archangel? Was I good?"
big s/o to iceman12 for not only giving this story the time of day but for caring enough about it to remind me it existed, lol. I promised a chapter update this weekend and as usual I'm pushing it what with it being 9:38pm CT (on Sunday) already but hopefully they enjoy the chapter anyway.
"I don't know. You didn't tell us much about yourself. Shorty over there didn't either but he was prone to showing off his powers a lot more so that's where we kinda picked up what he could do."
"Hmm."
"I don't know. I asked once but you refused to tell me."
Dean's breath had calmed down somewhat but when Cas entered the bar they were sitting in, "Whiskey Business", he felt like passing out all over again. It was Cas. Wearing tight jeans that accentuated his thick thighs and a Metallica sleeveless shirt that showed off his muscular arms and tattoos. Cas's hair was also different. It was still a mess but now it was long on the top and shaved on the sides. He also sported multiple piercings. He no longer looked like the holy tax accountant that he used to resemble but luckily he also didn't look like the end-verse Cas that Dean had to see thanks to the dick that Zach had been. In fact, he looked good. Really good.
A second later a thought crossed Sam's mind and he couldn't help but ask. "Hey Gabe?"
Sam glanced down at Gabriel who'd somehow found his way onto his lap once more. Sam wrapped him in a hug. "I've got to take it where I can get it. I really don't know what he's going to do when we find his grace."
"Destiel." Cas said, trying it out. "I like it. Much better than Sastiel, sorry Sam."
"Look guys, what he means-" "Stop." It was Gabriel that whispered it. "We believe him." "What?" asked Sam, surprised as get all. "You do?" Both Gabe and Cas nodded miserably. Cas spoke up then. "We get these dreams. Dreams that feel more like memories, like our brains are replaying something but I've never been able to see faces. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of green eyes. Gabriel always sees someone tall. I think-I think that's why everyone we've ever been with looked like ya'll. I think we were channeling ya'll and just didn't know it. But we don't just dream of ya'll. We dream of things that should be impossible. Of wings, lances, swords, blades, bloody bloody wars. We both do. So," Cas finally turned to look at Gabriel. "We are brothers. Tell us. Do we like each other?"
There was more that he wanted to say to Gabriel but right now a nap sounded good and there on the couch, with Gabriel in his arms, well he couldn't think of a better way to sleep.
"Are they gone yet?" came Gabriel's sleepy voice.
Cas looked over at his brother and engaged in some silent conversation that ended with Gabriel sighing and shrugging his shoulders.
Sam shook his head. "Hell yeah, you had one. An archangel blade. It was beautiful but no we don't have it. That thing is powerful. Chances are you hid it before you died. As you said once before, you can't just have that thing out, it could kill you." Gabriel laughed a small laugh but it sounded precious to Sam regardless. But thinking about it reminded him of Gabriel's real loud and boisterous laughter and he'd be lying if he said he couldn't wait to hear that one again. That one sounded more sure, more worthy of a being that could have the world at his feet with a thought.
"Not Cas's dick, thank you very much and you can't say shit like that. See? That's why those stupid fanfics exist. Because you say stupid shit like that."
"What the fuck was that, Sammy?"
Sam sighed and took another swig before answering. "Well, the only way to get Lucifer back in his cage was to say yes. So I did, I took back control of my body and threw us into the cage. This was where you died Cas. I didn't gain control back right away. No, I walked onto that cemetery and Michael was there wearing our younger brother, Adam. Dean wanted to speak to me, Sam, and Cas Molotov'd Michael. Lucifer didn't approve and he snapped his fingers and exploded you. I started beating Dean and somewhere along the way I realized who I was hitting and that's when I gained back control. I threw the horsemen rings on the ground, said the incantation, and was in the middle of falling into it when Michael showed back up and tried to hold on to me so that we could fight. Instead I grabbed him and dragged him down with me. From there it got pretty weird. Dean went and tried to live a normal life, got out of hunting for a while but me, I got out of hell that same night although we've never found out who it was that got me out. They left one crucial piece behind though." Sam stopped again to take a swig of his now lukewarm beer.
"So, ya'll decided to take a vacation during the second apocalypse?" Gabe asked. He didn't sound judgmental, merely curious. Sam nodded, "our lives have been a constant train of shit. For the past three years we've decided that anything that's going to happen will whether we're there or not so now we take a break once a year. We almost didn't this year but I'm glad we did otherwise we wouldn't have found y'all. Unless, of course, it was your dad that brought us here in which case I would like to remind him that we PREFER FREE WILL." Sam ended loudly as though to ensure God heard his little rant. Sam opened his eyes and looked at Gabe who held a faint smirk on his face. "Does that work?" Sam sighed, suddenly exhausted. "Sometimes. He's around. He's proven that much. He just doesn't like to get involved much. Even when it's y'all, his own damn children, that are the causers of mayhem and destruction. " "For what it's worth, I'm sorry." Gabe spoke softly.
He knows immediately that it's the wrong thing to say as Gabriel immediately turns green and runs to the sink where they can hear him retching.
Gabriel let out a squeak and fell to the floor, blood gushing from his now broken nose.
They're able to get the angel blades they possess out of Baby successfully and they're back inside the house in two shakes. Dean and Sam then show Cas and Gabe how to put up some basic warding and even though Gabe seems a little reticent about the whole thing, Sam is able to cajole him into participating. Gabriel seems a little surprised with how quickly he takes to it and Sam decides not to burst his bubble by telling him it's probably due to muscle memory. There will be much time for bursting of bubbles later.
"You guys are more than welcome to come back to our place. Especially since y'all seem to know us and well, we don't even know us." Cas's voice broke in, deep and rumbly as ever. Dean looked at him and felt himself go red when he saw Cas wink at him and follow it up with, "What do you say, good-lookin?"
Sam watched his brother roll his eyes before turning to continue on with the warding before turning to Cas to give him a nod of his own. He had to let him know he agreed with him one hundred percent. Dean could kiss his ass too.
"No problem. Now let me go find my lumberjack. He should be done brooding by now."
It seemed like Gabriel was thinking along the same thoughts as he followed Sam out.
"Is he gone now?" Cas asked. Dean stilled then nodded. "I'm sorry." Cas responded, turning to look at both Dean and Sam.
Gabriel sighed. "That's a lot. I don't know if I want my grace back. It sounds like a world that I don't want to get involved in."
As Dean walked up to the bar, presumably to tab out, Sam ran his eyes over Gabriel's body. Seeing Cas and how he was clearly a badass now, completely different from the stoic angel they once knew made him want to pay attention to Gabriel and see how else he was different. He spotted some minor differences as he held his hand out to Gabriel and helped him rise up off the floor. Gabriel was wearing skinny jeans that accentuated his shapely small legs. They stopped right at his ankles, frayed at the bottom, and had a ripped knee. They looked like girl pants but Gabriel easily pulled them off. He wore them with white Chucks and a simple white tee with one pocket across a shapely body that looked excellent against the light blue wash of his jeans. Jeggings, thought Sam. He remembered seeing the word somewhere and could feel that's what they were. Sam's eyes traveled up as he took in Gabriel's small but muscular body and he blurted out, "Do you work out?" before he could stop himself.
"GABRIEL?!" Dean exclaimed, anger quickly filling his features. Gabriel took a step back and Sam watched, confused as he saw fear etched across the archangels face. What the hell was going on?
Sam sighed. "Maybe we should just get you the books, it'll be faster."
"That's what I'm trying to explain Dean. He came up and asked me if I knew him!" Sam whispered furiously, trying to ignore what he knew were sobs coming from Gabriel who was still on the floor. With a final tug of warning on his brother's arm, Sam turned and looked at Gabriel, who was still bleeding as he hunched over, his small shoulders quaking as he cried. It tugged at Sam's heart and without another thought he crouched down. "Hey, Gabe? It's ok. We're sorry you got scared. Tilt your head back for me, let me see if I can stop that." Sam gently tucked two fingers under Gabriel's chin and tilted his head back while he leaned up a little to grab a cloth napkin that was on the table. The cloth napkin had surprised him, he'd never seen actual napkins in a bar before but maybe it was a Texas thing.
_____________
"So we had powers?" Gabriel asked, looking at Sam. Sam snorted. "You could do anything you wanted with a mere thought. By human standards Cas could too but you. You were an archangel. Cas once called you the most powerful weapons heaven had to offer." "Weapon? I don't like any sort of confrontation." That got another smile out of Sam. "We know. That's why you left home to begin with." "So, what made me want to fight Lucifer?" "The fact that Dean and I caught on to the fact that you weren't a trickster. A trickster is killed by a piece of wood with the blood of a victim. We tried to kill you multiple times and it didn't take. It was Cas that pointed out that if you weren't dying, you probably weren't a trickster. That gave Dean the idea that maybe you were an angel too. I trapped you and when you tried to laugh it off Dean challenged you to walk out of the holy fire. If you had been anything but an angel you would have been able to but alas you weren't able to and you revealed yourself. I asked you which one you were and you said 'Gabriel. They call me Gabriel.' Dean called you a coward for not facing your family and that seemed to do the trick because you did. You saved us and Kali, the Hindu goddess." Sam stopped there seeing that Gabriel looked like he was about to pass out.
"Lawyer?" Gabriel piped up.
"Could we do anything cool?" Gabriel asked.
“And Gabriel. I need to protect him too.” Cas had insisted. Sam thought it was an improvement when Dean didn’t roll his eyes at the statement.
Dean threw his hands up and muttered something under his breath about Gabriel already being a bad influence.
"You want another?" Gabe asked him and Dean, getting up. "Sure, thank you, short-stack." Dean replied easily. Gabriel turned to him with narrowed eyes. "Height jokes?" Dean put up a placating hand. "I used to call you that and it never bothered you because as you would say, hellllo, archangel. And I'm just a mud monkey." "A what?!" asked Castiel. "When we first met angels they used to call us apes or mud monkeys." Dean responded. Gabriel huffed. "Well, that's just rude." He said, placing the beers in the middle of the table. Dean shrugged, "True. Cas here killed him. I killed the other asshole."
"I know Dean. But should you have had to? Think about it, if you had a six year old son, would you leave him alone in a hotel room? Knowing what kind of monsters both human and otherwise are out there?"
"Do you have mine too? Did I have one?"
Again Dean surprised Sam by answering. "Not really. We don't think he's around that much. We really do mean the universe. A while after the Apocalypse, we actually met one of the fate sisters. She was mad because all those people who should have died, didn't. Including us. Or rather, we kept dying but kept getting brought back. Now that is something we think has to do with your dad."
"Dean, will you release my dick now?"
Dean leaned on the frame of the arch that separated the kitchen and the living room, crossed his legs, his arms and raised his eyebrow at Castiel who, in turn, narrowed his own eyes and bit his formidable lip in apprehension of what Dean was going to say or do. Dean started at the bottom and let his gaze become more hooded and heavy lidded as he did the slowest perusal known to man from the bottom of his legs, to his crotch where he spent over a minute biting his lip, licking it, doing it again and letting out a slow exhale before continuing his way up.
"Let's all go out, ok? I don't want to be here if they decide to uncloak themselves."
"Thanks for the food, guys." Sam told Cas and Dean who waved away his thanks. "No problem, Sammy. You kinda had your hands full after all." Dean smirked.
Sam would apologize but Gabriel doesn't give him a chance, instead he goes to the fridge and pulls out two pill bottles, handing them to Cas who shakes one out of each bottle and hands them to him. He dry swallows, lets Cas hold him for a couple minutes before exiting the kitchen. A moment later, Sam hears the tell-tale sound of a door opening and closing.
"I'm going to get you back for this, you know. It'll be the impala. You won't even see it coming."
Cloaked, Chuck watched and "heard" Sam, smiling to himself. The little human had gall. He'd make an excellent archangel. The perfect type needed to show the other angels about free will and standing up for yourself. He glanced at Dean, exchanging innuendo with his son, Cas. These two boys had defeated the Apocalypse simply because they said it wouldn't be so and stood by it. Yeah, they would make excellent angels. Chuck couldn't wait to add them to his family. Hopefully, they'd say yes.
Dean finally had the decency to look abashed. "Look, man-"
"Seriously, Dean?" Sam practically shouted as he saw how speechless and pale Cas and Gabriel had gotten. "What the fuck is wrong with you? Why would you tell them like that?" Dean just smirked at him. "Good brownie, Gabe." He said, tipping his beer towards Gabriel. Sam sighed in irritation as he pushed his hand through his hair.
Both Sam and Dean stayed silent. Neither knowing how to answer and the only sound to fill the room were Gabe's subsequent sobs.
"My soul. They left behind my soul. I walked around soulless for year before I came into Dean's town because there was a monster behind him. Later, even though I didn't want it back, Dean made a deal with Death to get it back. But by then my soul had been trapped in hell for almost a year and a half and again, every month here is a decade there. My soul was torn to pieces. Luckily Death put up a wall to keep those memories hidden otherwise I'd be in a psych ward somewhere trapped in my own mind. A blathering, sniveling savant idiot."
He sauntered up to them and tossed a "what's up, bro?" at Gabriel that had both brother's glancing at each other in shock. What the hell?
"Being all fucking innocent. You're going to be so embarrassed at yourself. I'm loving it already."
"But if Gabriel is to keep his memories, won't that mean I'll keep mine too?" Again Sam shook his head. "It's easy for me to say he will because of his status. He was an archangel. There's literally nothing he couldn't do." He replied, pulling said archangel into his lap- Gabriel went without hesitation. "But you had more limitations. I don't know what will happen with you. Hey! You know what we should do? You should make a video of yourself now and talk to your angel self, in case you forget anything, you'll have the video to remind you."
"Now we find your grace."
"So while you're taking care of him, who's taking care of you?" Dean asks harshly.
"What is that, exactly?"
"I'll be there." Cas interjected, making Sam jump. He'd forgotten Cas was there, having expected him to follow Dean.
"They'll probably eat each other then. Seems like a match made in heaven. Speaking of heaven, I'm sorry I feel asleep during your story telling. It's been a long day."
Sam hid his smile at Gabriel's words. Truthfully the ex-angel hadn't looked so much like an angel as he did now, all innocent and docile. It was adorable and he hoped that when Gabriel got his powers back, he'd remember this so that Sam could tease him about it. If he stuck around that is.
Sam glanced down where he could feel Gabriel's breath on his chest and felt something hitch inside him. Gabriel looked so peaceful and at rest. Sam hated to wake him up. He hated that he was going to have to bring Gabriel back to the life. Right then something changed inside Sam. He vowed to spend the rest of his days making life as easy as possible for Gabriel.
"Look." He started. He stopped and then started again. This was going to be hard. He was trying to find a way to give it to them gently but there was no way to do it. Better to just rip off the band-aid. "Here's the thing. Gabriel, back when you were in heaven, from what you've told us, you were happy. Once, you mentioned that you'd taught Cas here how to fly. But then your brothers, y'alls brothers, Michael, the eldest, and Lucifer, the second born started fighting and you couldn't take it so you left heaven and entered a witness protection program. I'm not entirely sure what that entailed, that's simply what you told us. You became Loki, a pagan god." Here Sam stopped to take a sip of his beer. Gabriel was staring at him, mouth agape before straightening and asking, "is that even allowed?" Sam shrugged in response. "We have no idea. We didn't know you that well. The extent of our knowledge of you is based on approximately four, or maybe five, times we met you. Loki, as you know, well, I don't know if you know, but he was the trickster. You played awful tricks on me and Dean. You turned me into a car, you gave me herpes, you kneed me in the balls, you killed Dean in front of me over a hundred times BUT", Sam quickly went on saying, seeing the tears filling Gabriel's eyes again, "When the Apocalypse came, you also died for us. You got stabbed by Lucifer, your brother."
Cas turns to look at him and a look passes over his face that Sam can only describe as repulsed.
Dean rolled his eyes at his little brother. "You're such a little bitch, Samantha."
Dean's stride became wider and he reached Gabriel and punched him.
Afterwards, they were going to Heim, a barbecue place that Cas had suggested. “It’s an actual restaurant?” Dean asked, his face scrunched up. They were hunters, accustomed to dive bars and petrol station “food”.
Gabriel shook his head as he tilted his head up to look at Sam, eyes wide. "We met them together. We were at the bar and they came up to us. Not to be crude but I think I have a size kink. I tend to go for the tall ones. Dean-I mean Cas- tends to like them with freckles or green eyes. I guess now we understand why. Poor Milo and Rigo. I wonder what their families think happen to them."
"Do you really want me to?"
Sam laughed. "Besides everything we already mentioned? Um, yeah, you could fly. Literally be anywhere in the world you wanted within seconds. You could snap and materialize anything you wanted out of thin air. You turned me into a car, you know. You could heal, bring people back from the dead, kill them with a thought, handy when it came to demons, lots of things."
"But," and here Sam widened his stance, as subtly as he could, knowing his brother would catch his move and ready himself, "if we're so famous you know that we've killed dozens of demons right? I mean, exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus..." and with that Sam and Dean jumped in and started fighting. A couple of times they were flung to and fro but Sam and Dean had plenty of practice with demons and it was getting harder and harder for one of them to get a good grab at the brother's. Finally, there were seven bodies on the ground, 5 dead, 2 unconscious from where the exorcism had taken effect and Sam groaned as Dean put his hand out to lift him up.
In the end, they decide that since Gabriel is asleep and someone needs to watch him Sam is going to stay in while Cas and Dean head out. Their first stop is going to be at the YMCA where Dean plans on getting Cas started on a regimen that will hopefully allow him to be able to protect himself.
"Tham." "What?" The man gently pushed his hand away and repeated himself. "Sam." Sam heard a snort behind him but ignored Dean to ensure he'd heard correctly. "You've been calling yourself by my- you've been calling yourself Sam?" The man nodded. "Why?" The man shrugged. "When I arrived here I didn't know who I was. I have no memory of anything beyond the past four years. The name that came to mind was Sam, so I've been using that. I didn't know my name was Gabe or Gabriel. It fits though. I feel like a Gabriel."
My arms were starting to feel the strain of holding on tight to Dean when he stopped fighting me and like Cas, fell to his knees. I went with him and held him this time like a brother. I knelt behind him with my arm around his chest and I pressed him back into me. I could hear Dean whispering something and I bent my head towards him, and I heard him say over and over “Help me Sammy. Please help me.”
“Why are you all in here?” Jack asked
“Warriors of Heaven hear me. Our father has deceived us and betrayed us. He has destroyed every world, every universe but our own. He wants to destroy this one and with it, Heaven, Hell as well as Earth. We need you to help stop him. We need you to fight alongside the demons of Hell and hunters of this world.
We left the garage and made our way to the map room. There was nobody there, but we could hear noises coming from the kitchen.
Sam’s mind was going into overtime.
I glanced over at Cas and I could swear there was a hint of a smile on Cas’s face as if he knew I had been watching him.
I sit back on my heel as Cas sits up to face me, “You fell asleep before you even finished your beer. I locked up the house and Miracle is in Jimmy’s room. I was going to wake you Dean, but you looked so peaceful, so I sat down for a while and I must have fallen asleep as well, I’m sorry”.
“Sam, I need you to contact Rowena and ask her if she’s sent the demon detail yet?”
Grabbing sweatpants, I pull them on before opening the door. Standing there is Michael, looking pale and dishevelled.
After saying hello to Siobhan, Rowena and Naomi came back out to the research room. I explained to Naomi about the problem we were having with the texts.
Robin stands with her hands on her hips grinning up at me, “Well if I know you, Dean Winchester and I think I may a small bit, is that you will give it your all and you will succeed”
At Siobhan’s nod, I looked at my brother who’s still staring at us. Finally, he spoke
“Well you are” Dean said to me completely ignoring my glare.
Cas’s whispered words break the impasse. Dean starts moving, small strokes building up to deep plunges into Cas’s tight heat. Cas groans, his hands gripping Dean's hips and ass cheeks as he guides Dean to rock harder and deeper into him. Leaning back to change the angle, Dean knows he has hit the jackpot when Cas keens loudly as he loses himself in everything Dean. No one else exists in the Universe at this moment. It is just them.
I rush to reassure him, “Cas it’s just me, we fell asleep. I’m sorry I woke you”.
“Speak for yourself” Cas said
Dean lowered his forehead to mine
I watched as Cas picked Siobhan up. When he turned towards me, his face was wet with tears. I don’t think I ever saw Cas cry before.
As I watched, the fire seemed to dim, and I could make out Siobhan’s outline. As she became clearer, I noticed she was naked. He clothes had burned away in the inferno. I stood watching, willing it to end.
“I cannot stay long” she said in her thick Scottish brogue. “It’s absolutely bedlam down there.”
SIOBHAN
“Well, we have had some times all right. But I hear you have a few stories of your own to tell” Jody said with a wink
Jack eventually spoke “I wasn’t expecting Siobhan to say that”
CASTIEL
As I approach, Sam releases her. Looking at both of us, she says, “Let's go somewhere a little bit more private, shall we” and in a wink of an eye, we are transported to what looks like the top floor of a hotel overlooking a sprawling city.
­­­­­­­­­­­
Letting Cas go, he picks up his suitcase and climbs down the steps only to be stopped by Miracle demanding attention which Jimmy is only too happy to give.
Sam has to agree. He takes in the landscaped garden, the hand paved driveway and the Victorian-style building as they approach the house. Knocking on the front door, they wait for over a minute before they hear the click-clack of high heels on marble.
“Hello, yes, is this Dean Winchester?” the voice asks
There are nods all around with Jimmy asking if he can use the computer to brush up on some of the signs and I agree.
“What, no Siobhan” Dean said “Absolutely not. We don’t know the reason Naomi hasn’t shown up. There could have been a power struggle up there. She might not even be in charge anymore. Siobhan no. I won’t allow it”
We untangle from each other as we hurry our way to Jimmy. All these interruptions are making me think the universe does not want Cas and I together. I'm getting a bloody complex.
“Like this, Dean. I want to see you when you’re inside me”.
“Michael, Dean and Cas are letting us use the sitting room so we can have a chat. Is that okay with you?”
We don’t stop until we hear Sam, “Guys, c’mon.”
“Your case?” said Dean
“Dean, that is you” he said with a grin on his face. “I’ve been trying to call you for days now. Is your number not working?”
“What no, it’s a great idea, Sammy, it really is and I think you and Eileen would be great at it, but……..”
We grinned at each other before Cas looked away, his face rosy.
Smiling at Cas, I continue, “Eileen is brilliant as well. She’s a tough cookie. Just so you know, Eileen’s deaf, so when you speak to her, make sure you are looking directly at her so she can read your lips, ok”.
From the tingles in the base of my spine, to the beautiful noises coming from Cas’s mouth, I knew neither one of us would be lasting long.
A smile that had me questioning everything.
Jack looked up at us and said the words that froze my heart “It has come for her. The Entity has Siobhan”.
There I found two letters. One addressed to Sam, the other for Jack.
Hackles rising, I snarl, “No we just like waving our hands around for the fun of it”
I smiled and said “Hello” and all four dropped to their knees “Prophet, we are honoured by your presence”
Michael looks panicked at this before Cas places his hands on Michael’s, “Michael, it's ok. You are ok. It doesn’t change the wonderful boy that you are. Answer me this, do you want to hurt anybody?”
Dean breaks eye contact and looks away before glancing at Sam.
Rose eyebrows journey upwards and I know I have stepped in it, “Oh so like a double date?”
“Dean, you can tell me anything. Unless you’re about to tell me you’re both eunuchs, then I’m going to have to kill you” I laughed.
Cas turns back and squeezes my shoulder before he sits down. Looking at Helen he says, “Of course we can take care of him. Won’t we Dean?
She was bleeding from some jagged cuts and she also had what looked like burns
After the boys left, I turned and smiled at Cas, happy to see him. I watched as Cas made to come and hug me but stopped himself at the last minute, busying himself with getting the salad from the fridge.
Dean just cracked a smile.
I plop back down on the bed feeling dizzy from the kisses and Cas’s declaration, “Yep, he’s going to kill me”.
Dean looked at me in horror and then he crossed the room to me and pulled me to him, “No, I’m sorry Siobhan, dammit I’m so sorry” he whispered over and over. “I don’t know why I get so angry. I’m so sorry”
Kneeling in front of me, Cas clearly worried, gasps out, “Dean what is it. Did something happen, Dean please, talk to me”.
“Morning, what have you got there?” Sam asked bending down to kiss the top of head.
CASTIEL
“You’re going with them right” I asked
“Because he tried to get me to undo it” I swallowed hard “He said he could send me back home to Ireland with Brodie and it would be like this never happened” I told them
“No wonder he was so upset when he found out you were leaving” Sam said “But Dean, do you really think it’s fair to him going with you when you can’t return his feelings. Maybe him staying here and giving him a chance to, you know get over you, might be the right thing to do”.
We were so much more comfortable with each other now.
Cas scrubs his face, “Rowena happens to agree with you. He’s going to try to hurt you and Sam in every and any way possible.”
“Rowena, Naomi what are you doing here………..together………..here?” Dean asked
Then Cas begins to move, small moves to get me used to his fullness. Soon I'm rocking with him, skin against skin, Cas’s cock hot and hard inside me, his belly and chest rubbing against mine, warm and sweaty, and his lips devouring mine, dirty open mouth kisses that alone drive me wild.
Jody snorts and rolls her eyes, “Ah yeah. The guy who taught me everything about hunting would kick my ass if I didn’t”
I looked around the room and asked “Where’s Siobhan”
“Yeah, tell me about it” I replied
Before my eyes, Cas turned an impressive shade of red and muttered something I couldn’t hear.
Then Cas stood up and walked towards me, there were tears in his eyes and he was still coming, he wasn’t stopping and then he caught my face and pulled me down to him and he was kissing me,
Sam seemed to come to some decision and said, “Shit, Dean I don’t know if I should even say this but dammit………….. look Cas has been human a few times or close to human as he could get, but this time, he’s fully human you know, he can never be an angel again”.
When we informed Michael, he got real quiet in himself, but we told him he could talk or not talk as much as he wanted. That the counselor was there to help him, and that Michael could open up when he was good and ready, and this seemed to settle him.
I watched as it sunk in with Naomi what we were asking. Us having that second plan hinged on her answer, otherwise we couldn’t risk it.
Speaking of family, Cas and I decided that now that we had told Sam and Eileen about us, we should clue in the rest of our extended family.
Looking over at Michael, his gaze rested on Cas, then on me, and back again, listening intently.
“Yes. But you could have told us that” Jack said
Leaning back, he holds Dean by the shoulders, “Dean, tonight when you ask me to go with you, I’m going to say yes. Ok? I will say yes.”
“Bye, Cas”, Jimmy says before hanging up.
At the door, I turn back, “Hey, you know where I am, if you need me. I don’t care what time it is, alright”.
“I hope you’re right Sammy” I replied
I looked at my watch. 4.58am. Very very am. I’m sitting on a very squishy monstrosity of an armchair in the boy’s room. Keith, Nicholas and Joseph have finally gone back to sleep, and I sent Jimmy up to the attic to sleep in Cas’s bed.
We both turn to see Cas standing behind us, eyebrows arched, having come in from the back porch.
The boys climb out without protest. The thoughts of bears excite them but scare them too. Sam, Eileen and Cas keep a lookout as I help the boys dress and pack the few things they’ve brought, the blanket and cooler, along with their towels.
Castiel’s eyes widened and then closed before he whispered
Cas says as much to her now, “I’m sorry I wasn’t more friendly that day, Jackie.”
Jack said “Sure ok”
Looking at her face, I colour furiously, “What!”
We had finished warding the cabin and had settled into rooms when I heard a couple of cars pulling up outside.
Dean and I looked at each other “She better answer this time” Dean growled
“See you next week, Dean. Same time”
“Oh for crying out loud. Typical, left up to the woman” I thought
At his puzzled look I took a deep breath and said “It’s about Siobhan”
The man nodded, and returned his gaze to the corpse on the floor.
Suddenly, his gun was on the floor, knocked out of his hands by a force too fast to be seen by the human eye. He was grabbed by the collar of his jacket, which was made out of thick leather, and sturdy enough to hold his weight without problem. His back was now pressed against the car, and he felt cold steel against his throat, pressing against the exposed skin in a way that made his blood run colder than the icy wind could ever achieve.
He grinned. "Shouldn't have underestimated me, I'm a great shot." He pushed himself up from the floor, wincing at the feeling of his aching body. "You know, I didn't want to kill you, I just needed some info-"
"I apologize."
The driver laughed out loud, the first time in what seemed like ages. He appreciated dry humor.
Everything that happened next seemed to do so in only a few seconds, leaving no room or time for the driver to take a breath or realise what was going on.
Dean cringed, looking down at the bottle of bleach next to him.
The rumbling of the wheels on old and tattered asphalt was only rivaled in volume by the music blaring from inside the car.
The drivers' heart jumped. He whipped his head around, barely registering how cold the eyes of the man sitting next to him looked, and slammed his foot on the brakes, not caring about the potential of slipping on the ground. The car came to a sudden halt, yanking both of them forwards and into their seatbelts.
It was indeed a road that the man was walking next to, made of trampled dirt and already halfway obscured by freshly fallen flakes. If the storm continued, the road would become impossible to drive on, that, the man knew. And that was not good for him, not good at all. So far, he had been relying on kind strangers picking him up, often times in the last moments before he would collapse from exhaustion. He had a habit of forgetting the time, walking for far too long, through night and day, as if he had forgotten that he needed rest and sustenance in order to keep on living.
He had no more right to know about the other hunters past than vice versa, and he sure as hell wasn't going to explain his own motivations. As the car started gradually slowing down, Dean put his head on the steering wheel for a moment. It was cold, but not as cold as the night had been. He looked back up. The sun had risen ever so slightly since the last time he had paid attention to it. It was right in front of him. Sappy metaphors came to mind, but he didn't get hung up on any of them. It was simply a new day.
Dean sighed, and tried his best to get up without slipping in the puddle of blood on the floor, the source of which he was trying to ignore desperately.
His sources had taught him about the werewolfs ability to transform only partially, and use superhuman strength and abilities whenever they felt like it. However, no one had told him about the apparent immunity to silver. Or maybe his bullets just werent pure enough. He needed to doublecheck with Bobby, something like this couldn't happen again. It had been too close.
They stood still for a second too long, before Dean grabbed the weapon from him.
Before Dean could get a closer look, there was a slashing sound. Blood splattered onto Deans' face. It drenched his shirt, forced him to close his eyes. There was a slight pause, then a dull thumping sound echoed throughout the tiny building. A deafening silence filled the air.
"Dean. It's Dean, okay? Dean Winchester."
Dean was already turning on his heel when he was grabbed by the arm. He turned around, confused, and was suddenly face to face with the man, who was staring at him intensely and with an uncanny and unreadable expression. He looked like he was about to say something, or like he was holding his breath in preparation for...
The hunter seemed to contemplate for a while, before ever so slightly shaking his head.
"So... uh... how come you're here, by the way? I guess we were looking for the same monster, but why'd you choose such a challenge?"
Driving kept his mind away from endulging in the most shadowed parts of his mind, though it could only distract him for so long with no other car in sight for hours, and the blindingly white snow robbing him of all thoughts. It practically drained him, having to watch the homogenous terrain fly by, not even interrupted by flora and fauna, one of whom had been buried in ice, the other one hiding in burrows and caves, not daring to venture out during the type of weather that would kill them faster than any predator ever could.
They sat in silence. The driver noticed that the man wasn't shivering. He just sat there, eyes fixed on the road, hands folded in his lap. He wasn't wearing gloves either. They were both plagued by the same questions. Who are you, what are you doing out here, where are you going? But they could sense that the other was somehow different from the average, and they respected eachothers privacy in a way that would seem insane to any other person.
"Detective Hills. Is my name. Thought it might just be time to introduce myself."
"Listen man, I will not ask you again. Who are you and what do you want from me?"
"I..."
A cold gust of wind blew at him. It made him blink a few times, and he had to apply an unusual amount of force to the door in order to open in further.
Finally, Dean took the time to actually look at the hunter fully. He was carrying a bundle of cloth so big that Dean was surprised about not noticing it earlier, despite his enraged state.
He kept on walking, or rather wading, through thickening snow. Cold, snowy weather brings fog. The dense kind, that impacts your field of vision, like a thick curtain obscuring everything in a certain distance. Trough the densely falling snow, this effect was multiplied into infinity, denying his eyes from scouring even the ground in front of his feet, much less the terrain around him.
Deans' digging grew increasingly agressive, his spade hacking chunks of frozen dirt out of the ground, catapulting them in all kinds of directions.
Dean accepted the answer. He knew the feeling, and besides, he wasn't exactly keen on going out into the storm anyway. The coldness still hadn't left his fingertips. They had become numb at one point during the burial, a contrast to the unrestrained rage that had been ravaging Dean moments before.
"No, seriously man, you just hitchhiking out here? The town were Im headed has three people living in it, that is not a safe way of travel in these parts. What, you were just hoping someone would stop by and carry you to your destination?"
He could hear shuffling behind him as soon as his back was turned, but he payed no mind to it.
The branches above them rattled with a new gust of wind.
"Jesus christ dude, you're an even bigger creep than I feared. Put your hands on your head and stand against the car!"
"May I enter your vehicle?"
The stranger nodded.
"So, you're a hunter?"
The hunter continued mopping the floor. It was quiet for a while, and Deans' grin was starting to fade, before he finally spoke up again.
He turned away from Dean, his gaze landing on the building that was now visible, illuminated by a singular light.
Dean didn't remember seeing a mop the first time he entered that room, but he had also missed the place in which the wolf had been hiding previously, so he wouldn't exactly pride himself on his great observation skills. The other hunter seemed to have a nack for it though.
The silence continued.
They might have to spend the night, but that's something neither of them wanted to think about.
A slight creak next to him. The shuffling of a too big trenchcoat. Dean opened one of his eyes, took another sip of his beer, and looked over to the hunter next to him.
The driver nodded in understanding, suddenly a lot more relaxed.
Which was why, when he saw the dark shape in his headlights, standing tall and steady in his path, he almost had a heart attack. He thought he had finally gone mad.
Someone cleared their throat behind Dean. He flinched, and immediately jumped to get back up, stumbling in the process. The cold wetness on his knees and legs was suddenly greeted with wind, making him shiver involuntarily. He spun around, irritated, and snapped at the man behind him.
Dean sighed.
His companion turned away again. He paused for a moment, as if he was calculating his next response, and the risk that came with it.
"Think again."
"This... is yours. I presume you would not want to leave it behind."
The man outside spoke.
Looking at the still snow-covered world around him, Dean took out a blanket from under the passenger seat, and climbed into the back without opening any doors. He needed to conserve heat.
"You found me. I am assuming you are taking me to your destination."
With horror in his eyes, Dean watched the wound close up, and the silver bullet drop to the floor. It made a high pitched clincking sound, and then it lay still.
The silence was deafening, but Dean wasn't going to back down this time. It had been a stressful and tense night, and he was in no mood to argue, but the lack of answers were pissing him off to no end.
The man, calm as ever, followed suit. He gently closed the door, and lifted his head. He stared right into the drivers eyes, piercing him in place with solely his gaze. The wind was whipping around him, furious and loud, but instead of bothering him, it seemed to fill him with life. He stood tall. And he looked threatening. Like a predator.
He spun around, gun already rising, when suddenly he was grabbed and flung violently across the room. He smashed into the harsh stone floor of the altar, barely shielding his head from breaking open from the impact. He fired blindly, two, three times in front of him, before opening his eyes, which had been tightly clenched before. There, across from him, stood the bartender. His fingers were sharpened into claws, his snarling mouth revealed rows of sharp teeth. There was blood dripping from a hole in his chest. Dean had hit him.
He gestured vaguely towards the ground.
Instead, the man lifted his shovel, and hammered it into the frozen ground.
"That's somehow worse."
"You a vampire or something? No need to ask, you wouldn't make it another hour out there. Pretty lucky I came by."
"Tell me your name."
He seemed to be... uncomfortable, in a way. Squeamish. His posture seemed tense, but he was seemingly aware of it, trying to conceal it as best as he could.
Dean was tempted. Now that the knife was safely tucked away, he wanted to jump on the man, hold him down and choke him out until he couldn't move, and then floor it out of there. He knew that it wouldn't work, though. Whoever the man was, he was superior to him in almost every way. He could probably outmaneuver him no matter what Dean tried, and then, Dean was certain, kill him without hesitation. He had to take the chance at survival that the man was offering him, and run with it.
Slowly, but steady, he made his way toward the treeline behind the church. The woods were thick around here. A few meters in, and no one would be the wiser for at least a while.
Slowly, Dean nodded.
The car slowed down. Dean had found a flat spot on the side of the road, a few yards into the woods, covered in glistening snow, but with enough space for him to park in it. The motor came to a stop. It was silent.
The white powder, (which you couldn't even call powder anymore, it was too packed together), drained his body heat with a frightening speed. He couldn't really feel his feet anymore, but he was sure that they were already soaking wet, and the numbness slowly snaked its' way up his legs, threatening to swallow him whole and leave him still and frozen at the side of the road.
The more Dean thought about them, the more the effects took hold. His head was pounding now, and his vision was beginning to falter. He was slowly crossing into slightly denser populated areas as well, meaning other cars on the road, meaning a bigger risk if he decided to keep driving like this. Disgruntled, Dean turned the music down. He needed to concentrate. With a heavy heart, he decided to pull over in the next best place, and take a nap on the side of the road. It was the only option he had if he wanted to arrive in Sioux Falls without crashing.
Dean looked up again, and tried to force a smirk on his face.
A slight pause. A quick look to the side, barely noticeable.
Dean squinted his eyes, trying to focus on the monster in front of him.
"I advise you to leave."
The creature moved first. It slowly stepped toward the driver, and even though he couldn't see its' face, he knew that it was staring at him. It came closer, step by step, its' wide frame outlined by the high beams it was standing in. It seemed to have an everchanging silhouette, its' edges constricting and moving with the wind, and it kept coming closer. The driver was close to pressing down the gas pedal, flooring it over whatever was approaching him and just speeding off. His engine was still running, he could do it, but before he could put his thoughts into action, a face became visible. Out there, only a few meters from him, now finally fully illuminated, stood a man. The changing silhouette could be attributed to a type of long coat, which was blowing in the howling wind, giving the impression of something bigger, more dangerous approaching. But in the light, he was just a man. And he was looking at him. Frankly, they were staring at eachother, both probably weary to the same extent, but also knowing that what they needed was right in front of them. For the driver, it was company, something, someone to keep his mind off other things, a break from the infinite whiteness that was stretching all around him. And for the man, it was shelter, protection from the elements, a way to keep on going through the night without succumbing to the cold. They could have kept on staring like that for ages, had the man outside not moved. He approached the passenger side door, his eyes never leaving that of the driver, watching him, maybe like a hawk stalking its' prey, or maybe like the prey judging the danger of predator in comparison to the world he was turning his back to.
"I... found these in the sacristry. They were in one of the storage boxes. The cloth as well."
Two weeks ago, the local pastor had been found in front of the church, chest ripped open, and a missing heart. Other than the obvious wound, there had been no other sign of struggle. Authorities blamed it on a grizzly attack, unusual since the population had been diminished drastically, and one would have had to wander over the border for it to happen, but not impossible. There hadn't been any similar attacks before or after the incident, which made Dean even more sure of being in the right place.
A hunt, which lay a few months back by now, had led him into the home of a collector of extravagant weaponry. Most of it was useless, but, after Dean was done with the owner, he didn't want this particular artifact to go to waste, or worse, fall into the wrong hands. He hadn't used it so far, hadn't had the need to use it, but his gut told him that now was probably the time to take it out of its' leather case, another special treat which Dean had, after some consideration, taken from the former owners house as well. It was a little bulkier, sure, but it was also protection, against thief and authority figure alike.
He had briefly forgotten about the cold.
The mans eyes narrowed.
While he was carefully touching his nose, examining what should have been a clean break, the stranger cleared his throat.
He didn't have one yet, and in all honesty, he didn't know if he would be quick to find one either. This lead had taken him months to find and follow, and if word got around, he would be even slower to get ahold of another one of these special monsters.
"You must be special. That gives you the power to break him."
"You know, we don't know. What I can tell you is that you can probably maintain them just by directing your grace to leave them alone."
"What's happening?" Cas asked.
"Why did you come up to me, Gabriel?" Sam asked after a minute had passed and he saw the blood was flowing much more diminutively now. "I don't know. I just felt like I knew you somehow. I guess I was right."
__________________
Neither Dean nor Sam said a single word on the way to Cas and Gabe's apartment, both of them were too stunned to speak. Cas was calling himself Dean, Gabriel was calling himself Sam, they were with people that looked like Dean and Sam and they didn't look like the Cas and Gabe that Dean and Sam had known. What the fuck was going on? Sam's eyes roved over to see his brother with his jaw clenched and white knuckling the steering wheel. Sam wanted to say something but he knew Dean didn't want to hear it. As it was, he was hanging by a thread and he was going to need that to remain calm as they talked to Cas and Gabe. Dean didn't do well with change and although Sam had seen the look of appreciation cross Dean's face when he got a gander of the new and improved Cas, Sam also knew that it had disrupted Dean's psyche to be hit on by said new and improved Cas, so yeah, he knew better than to try to give Dean a bone right then. He'd get his head and hand bitten off.
Dean opened his mouth but Sam beat him to it.
"What was that all about?" Dean asks Cas.
Sam hesitated before replying. "No, Gabe. Everything that you are, everything that you've been, that you've done had made you who you are and I wouldn't trade that for anything."
"Okay, hit me."
Sam laughed out loud. "Hell no."
Cas and Gabriel stared at them, mouths agape. "Like, together?" Cas finally asked. Dean gave his own shudder and nodded. "Yeah, it's called Wincest." "Speaking of which, there's Destiel and Sastiel too." Sam input.
Dean and Sam both shuddered. "God no. Don't even say that. When the universe finds a way it can fuck us, it usually does." Sam said.
"Yeah, well, we have to have them to rent rooms and things of that nature." Dean said defensively, crossing his arms over his shoulders.
“Great. I’ll be drinking douchebag beer.” Dean grumbled but he fooled no one. The smile on his face spoke volumes. Cas just gave him a smile before looking at him up and down and saying, “you sure look good in anything, Dean. Maybe sometime I can see your birthday suit?”
Dean stilled. "What?"
"You know when you get your powers back I'm going to tease you merciless for this."
Sam looked at him. He just couldn't imagine a world without Gabriel, the archangel in it. He'd already had to do it once and when Gabriel died, Sam felt it. Gabriel was the only "good" archangel. The world needed him. Not just because of Raphael but because of the angel duties he held. The world needed that. But how to best convey that? Sam thought a minute before speaking.
Gabriel hiccuped but nodded. "Not as much as Mr. Ripped over here but enough so that I can eat all the sweets I want. When I first got here I had something of a pudge. I didn't like it so I took up running and now I even run some marathons. Did I always do that? No, right? Otherwise I wouldn't have had a pudge." He looked at Sam in askance. Sam started to shake his head but then stopped. "In actuality, I'm not sure. I didn't know you that well. We just kinda, crossed paths if you will, a few times."
"So wait," said Gabe, bringing their conversation back on track, "You said that you dragged Michael down along with Lucifer. Dragged him down where?"
"It's like a place between worlds. A place you can access but no one else can."
"It's ok. I fell asleep too. I guess I could have used a nap. Besides, you were quite comfy."
Cas spoke up again, "Milo? Rigo? Would you guys be ok to catch an Uber back to your own homes? These fine ass gentlemen supposedly know us and are going to talk to us."
"In the beginning, as we told you we were predestined to become Michael and Lucifer incarnate. Our lives were led to one goal, becoming vessels for them. So Sam here was supposed to die, I was supposed to go to a demon to make a deal and I was supposed to go to hell. I did all of that. The demon offered me one year in return for Sam's life and I took the deal. When the time was almost up for me, Gabriel here stuck Sam in a time loop, reliving each day as Tuesday and every day I died. It was supposed to be so that Sam could learn how to live without me once I was gone but Sam didn't learn so Gabriel returned me. Once I was hauled off to hell, a demon became Sam's friend, pretending that she was trying to help and she got him addicted to demon blood. See, when our mom was killed it was because she was trying to save Sam from a demon who was putting demon blood down his throat. The demon blood gave Sammy powers, not right away, but they materialized around the time I went to hell. With the demon blood he became stronger. That's what Gabe was trying to prevent, he just had a lousy way of telling us. He should have just told us instead of going about it the way he did. Anyway, the angels did their best at separating us and it sorta worked. I was working with Cas and Sam was still working with that demon bitch, Ruby. It'll all came down to head when Ruby had Sam kill the bitch who owned my hell contract, Lilith. The thing we didn't find out until Cas rebelled and told me the truth was that Ruby was working on Lucifer's side. She was working for Lilith and Lilith was the final seal that needed to break in order for Lucifer to be released."
"How long will he be asleep?" he asked a grumpy Cas a couple of hours later.
Sam laughed again.
"You were the best archangel. Michael only wanted to follow an outdate plan of your dads. Lucifer hated humans and rebelled when your dad ordered y'all to love us. That's why he was casted out. Raph just wants power. But you, you were special. You left because of your family but you found your own family down here. You joined the pagans, became a god in your own right. Loki. That's how I met you, you know? First as the Trickster, then Loki, then Gabriel."
To Sam's surprise, Cas dragged his brother out and put him in Sam's arms and Gabriel immediately latched on to him before turning back to Dean. "No, Dean, I'm not your fucking pet. Whether I take the grace back or not is MY motherfucking decision, not yours! I don't come when you call, you son of a bitch. I'm my own fucking person. And if I'm an angel, as you claim, and I'm the one who took you out of hell then don't you think you'd be better off showing me some respect? Otherwise, believe me Dean, when and if I take those powers back I will make your life a living hell, I promise."
Dean laughed. "This and that." Cas narrowed his eyes at him. "Well, we're not strippers or anything but basically we hustle pool and play cards."
"Are you straight?" Cas asked, looking at him and Gabriel.
Gabriel looked at him. Sam averted his eyes, a blush covering him from neck to hairline. He didn't want to sound needy but...
Breakfast finally got underway, Cas pulled out eggs, Dean put bacon on a pan, Sam made coffee and went to sit at the table and Gabriel sat on his lap and hugged him. Sam sat there and hugged him back.
He brought the napkin down and took in Gabriel's tear stained face and tried to ignore the clenching his heart did at seeing Gabriel like this. He was an archangel for Chuck's sake. He shouldn't look like this! Gabriel was looking at him with fearful eyes so Sam spoke quietly. "I'm going to apply some pressure to your nose ok? It's going to hurt a little but we have to stop the blood, ok, Gabe?" The other man just sniffled and gave a slight nod as Sam moved his hand closer. "What have you been calling yourself anyway?"
Sam enjoyed the way Dean turned bright red and began to sputter only to stop when Cas put a finger on his lips. "Nope. It's been decided. You, you like snack, are bunking with me. Come, Dean. Let me show you to our room." With that, Cas trailed a finger down Dean's arm, leaving goosebumps Sam could see where he lay, in its wake before grabbing him by the hand and pulling him behind him.
"Dean, I literally watched you grab Cas's dick. You didn't hear me complaining, did you? Jerk."
"I promise then Sammy. I promise not to leave."
"Just like that?" Cas's eyes narrowed at him. Sam nodded, putting butter on his toast. "Just like that."
"So were you, you big moose."
"He even turned into an alcoholic for a short amount of time. When he wasn't asleep he could be found at a club somewhere, drunk off his ass and sleeping his way through the crowd. I like clubs as much as the next person but Gabriel was there from Wednesday through Sunday. Then he eventually got pills and did the sleeping thing and he wasn't awake long enough to get drunk much less anything else. Then it all slowly stopped but he was diagnosed as severely depressed with severe social anxiety. It's still something of a battle for me to get him to leave the house in the day time. He's nocturnal as hell. When he saw you, Sam, he hadn't left the house in 11 days. At all. I was afraid he was regressing and was mentally preparing myself for the possibility when everything else happened. But hanging out with you, it's the most relaxed I've ever seen him with anyone who isn't me."
Sam looks at Dean warily, “Tell me what………………... tell me what, Dean.”
I watch helplessly as Dean walks out of the room. Anyone could see that Jimmy’s words hurt him. I want to be angry at Jimmy, but how can I be. His whole world has caved in, and he doesn’t know who to trust. I can see him watching me quietly to gauge my reaction. So, I give him a quick smile before moving my chair over to the window, giving Trace and Jimmy space. This is where I’m needed. And when Jimmy finally tells his story, I know I made the right decision.
I saw Sam glance at me, rub the back of his neck, blew out a breath, looked at me again and then decided to think better of it.
You changed me Dean.
Castiel and I looked at each other “Siobhan” he whispered
Walking out of the bedroom, I hated seeing the look on Dean’s face when I said those last words. I knew deep down where Dean was coming from, but right now I needed to get out of here.
With Dean snoring softly beside us, Castiel and I reached for each other and we touched and kissed and stroked each other until we both fell into Heavenly ecstasy.
Cas’s face softens, muttering, “Sorry Sam” before Cas’s lips cover mine.
I ignore the quiet sniggers coming from the lake until I hear Sam say, “C’mon guys.”
Oh my God she thought to herself, No, No I’m not ready.
“Hey Cas, you ok” I asked sitting down beside him.
The next day Sam and I go to the hospital to put the protection spell on Jimmy. We talk with Adam for a minute or two before letting him off for something to eat. Then we head into Jimmy’s room. He looks pleased to see us though he tries to hide it, and his not so subtle look over our shoulder to see if anyone else was joining us was heartbreaking.
SIOBHAN
I remembered the feel of his body as I woke up, the playful tickle fest, the pining him to the bed, his laughter, the feel of our bodies together as I straggled him. It was all so fucking perfect, so easy, so right.
I told the boys that they could clean their rooms later, so the noise wouldn’t disturb Cas and Michael. I helped them clean up the kitchen and after that we collected eggs from the chickens and cleaned up the coop. The boys were in good spirits even after the fright they had last night.
Donna’s ragged breath is the only sound until Jody asks, “Sam, where did he go?”
Sam couldn’t be more transparent if he tried, “Sam, for the love of Jack, spit it out? What’s on your mind?” I asked him.
“No” I protested “I want to do more of this” standing on my tippy toes (Man they were both so tall) and pressing my lips to Dean’s.
Dean’s eyes widened at that and then he turned back to Cas and lost himself in him.
“So, what is it?” I asked a little breathlessly
Rowena started another incantation.
Joseph giggles again and runs back inside. I look at Cas and he returns my gaze, his eyes searching my face.
I walk him to the passenger seat with my arm around his shoulder, and he climbs in. Helen smiles sadly over the roof of the car at me before she climbs in as well.
What do you want” she asked?
Dean placed his hands on my upper arms and stared at me.
So engrossed I was in my mission to de-ice the fridge, I completely forgot the food in the oven. Thankfully, when I checked it was still good.
Cas winks at me saying, “We’ll see………. grasshopper”
I turned back to the freezer, pleased with the progress I made. I laughed internally thinking if we survived the coming apocalypse, it would be written that while the boys fought valiantly, I defrosted a freezer. Yeah well, at least I accomplished something.
Sam finished “Dean, call me at any time, you hear and pass that message onto Cas as well”
“Burgers” Sam replied, “You’re getting burgers with chips and would it kill you to try the salad with it”.
Huffing a laugh, I rub the back of my neck, “Shuudup you.”
She said, “Dean look about yesterday with Deputy…………….”
“Ready whenever you are Naomi” I said
I reached back again and grabbed Cas’s cock, “Now Cas please”.
Cas’s appearance still takes me by surprise. Instead of the blue suit and tan trench coat, Cas is wearing all black. Black jeans, plain black t-shirt, black denim jacket and black hiking boots. The outfit makes his hair look darker and his eyes bluer than ever. He looks human, he looks………
Donna remembered something then, “Castiel, Dean, disappeared first. Maybe twenty seconds later, Sam did.”
Now sharing a couch watching a Men in Black marathon, I look over at Cas. He’s stretched out beside me wearing my Led Zeppelin t-shirt and black sweatpants, I let my mind to wonder, what if I wasn’t bothered by it……what if……….
I’m not ok
Sonny leans back in his chair and looks at me not unlike the way he looked at the 15-year-old Dean (cocky as all hell) Winchester, “I have to say, I was surprised it was Cas you brought with you and not Sam. But I’m glad you did. He has a quiet way about him, but knows how to cut though all the bullshit, you know”.
Saying he’ll leave the kitchen to last; we head upstairs where Sonny shows us the boys’ rooms, three rooms with three beds in each. Jimmy the eldest boy had a room to himself while the three younger boys were bunking together. There was also one bathroom on the floor for the boys to use.
Blushing furiously, I smile and say “Yeah it was great fun. That’s kind of what I wanted for you, me and Sam. Toes in the sand, enjoying our retirement but yeah, today was kind of perfect”.
Dean walks away, head bowed, before turning back, “Cas, you’ve read Michaels file. The mother home-schooled Michael. He was sheltered from birth. It’s only thanks to the mother’s staff that Social Services knew Michael was in danger from her.”
I fill him in on the conversation before I ask, “I don’t want to break his confidence, but do you think I should call Helen?”
Hi all. Thanks again for all the comments and kudos. I really enjoy talking with you. Again this chapter is from both Dean and Cas's point of view. This isn't a happy chapter so be warned.
I look to Dean to let him decide how to answer. Dean decides on the truth.
One was a summer dress, and the other, well the other was a “bought in the heat of the moment knowing I would probably never wear it dress” but I knew looking at it I wanted to wear if for my boys. I wouldn’t be going out in it. It would be just for them.
The screams are broken by the sound of heart-breaking sobs.
Winking at me, Cas gives me a cheeky smile. Standing with his legs planted he raises his arms chest high and gives the universal signal with his hands to “Bring it on”.
“I know. We have to do some major strategizing to make this work” I said
She reached over and squeezed my hand as the sounds of the boys getting up to start their day reached my ears.
“I don’t know” I replied
Dean and Sam exchange a look, and Sam indicates for Dean to speak, “Jody, Donna, I died over a hundred years ago, about half that for Sam. You get to keep Sam for another long while. We were brought back to 2025 by an Angel because the Entity from the Empty wants to reset time and the Universe. Somehow it’s thrown us out of time and brought us here. We don’t know why, but I suspect it’s to throw Jack off his game and maybe to torture Cas and me.”
Jack explained everything that had happened after we left and then he told us Siobhan’s message……
I reach out my hand, “Cas”.
“Yeah, I guess I’d be interested” Jimmy answers quietly.
I groaned and kissed him deeply. Against his lips I muttered “You are going to kill me, but what a way to go”
I smile, “That’s an excellent idea, Jimmy, thanks”.
We start with the bumper cars. Cas takes Michael, Eileen takes Joseph, Sam takes Nicholas while Jimmy takes Keith and I stay with Miracle. For the next turn, Cas steps out to hold Miracle and I climb in next to Michael. I hadn’t been in a bumper car since I was a teenager and for these boys it was their first time. Hearing their screams and laughter is the best sound in the world.
Sam grins at her and says, “Yeah, and that’s a whole other long story, but yeah, Cas is alive and in Heaven.”
“Chuck” I whispered. Damn.
Naomi went to leave but Rowena made for the bedrooms. I saw Naomi watch her go. Naomi hesitated but then she climbed the stairs and went out the door.
“Agreed” Naomi said
I looked at him wondering what was wrong, “Cas, he’s ok, isn’t he?”
I’m hoping I’m wrong about this. I’m hoping that it has nothing to do with us if it is a demon attack. But what are the chances of that?
“Dean I’ve got you” Castiel said “I’ve got you”
“Dean, Cas stop” I said “This has to be done. Please you gave me your word.” I begged
My face was buried in Cas’s neck unable to stop the torrent of tears flowing down my face, whispering “You’re here” over and over.
Cas’s eyes filled with tears as he pleaded with me, “Dean please don’t be angry, I promise, I’ll never…….”
I looked at my brother over Siobhan’s head while I hugged her and what I saw startled me. It was pure love, not just for Siobhan but for me. His love for me was all over his face. I smiled back at him and hoped he could see in me, what I saw in him.
One last ingredient and the final incantation
I smile at him then and leave the room.
I also don’t think I can tell Sam without breaking down like an idjit.
So, was I going to do anything about it? Probably not.
It was no holiday at the beach; it was better. They didn’t want to leave at the end of the two weeks, but they had to get home, back to the Family Business even if Dean was quietly looking for something ordinary, something normal to do with his life at the time. Four weeks after leaving Jody and the girls, Dean died on a milk run.
………………………………………………………………………………………….
Jimmy answers, “My Dad”
Cas pulls back again and says simply “Goodnight Dean” before he gets up and heads back inside, leaving me dazed and slightly aroused on the porch swing.
“Awesome. I left her shampoo and grooming stuff under the sink in the kitchen. Thanks, Jimmy. But we’ll eat first ok. It’s been a long day” I tell him, and he nods his head.
“I will Cas” Sam replies
Roger is good people.
What I saw in the future with Cas was beautiful and pure and I didn’t want to be told it was lies or illusion, but I needed the truth. All the truth.
Laughing, I kiss Cas on the forehead on my way out of the kitchen, before calling on the boys from the foot of the stairs, to get a move on.
Obviously, Rose didn’t have the whole story, but some part of me wanted to believe it.
Dean spots Sam leaving his house, Eileen trailing onto the porch with him. As Dean watches them embrace in the distance, he says, “Give me a minute.”
I tightened my arms around him and said “Its ok, I get it. I do. I just hate you going through this alone”
"Fear not. I have found two shovels inside of the local tavern. I am sure the owner will not mind us borrowing them."
Something touched his shoulder.
A clawed hand slammed him into the wall behind him, the grinning, fang-filled mouth in front of his eyes.
"I am not a vampire. I am not otherwordly. I am a man with desires."
"Something bothering you?"
Dean tried his best to make his voice seem strong and steady, though both men sensed the uneasiness, and heard the slight tremble that accompanied the spoken words.
The hunter quickly looked up at Dean, then back down at his work, before opening his mouth. He almost seemed startled.
"Something like that."
The room he was looking at was... unspectacular. It was barely bigger than a supply closet, with small boxes stuffed into rotting shelves, and a dusty broom in one corner, which looked as if it could use a bit of cleaning itself.
It was creeping Dean out even more, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief when he finally saw the faint glow of a light in the distance. The air had cleared over the course of the drive, making it easier to see the road and the surroundings, therefore enabling Dean to drive at a slightly higher speed in the last few hours.
The drive was quiet. It was to be expected, after the little fiasco earlier, though it didn't bother Dean too much. His mind had finally gotten something to latch onto. The mysterious stranger provided distraction from all the various dark and bloody thoughts inside Deans' mind, and despite the grisly circumstances of their arrangement, he was thankful for his presence. It provided him with the opportunity to let his mind wander in different directions. Who, or maybe even what, was the one sitting next to him? Where did he come from? What was his mission? In Deans' mind, he had picked up particularly skilled and crazy serial killer, who had made it his mission to eradicate the entirety of the Harding' population, a task that was probably achievable in a few months of dedicated work.
Dean looked up. The clouds were beginning to clear now, and the moon shone through, bright and almost perfectly round. He had a job to do, and he had to do it quickly.
He alone knew what he wanted, what his aim was, and he was determined. Determined enough to waltz through the middle of winter, without protection or a visible goal, on his own terms, and with no one but him knowing where his destination lay.
The man on his passenger seat seemed unfazed by the question.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, and pressed out words through his fear, trying his best to not let them get stuck in his throat.
The man nodded and backed away. Dean kept his eyes on him, and slowly moved back toward the drivers side. He never stopped looking at the man, and he returned the favour, so they were staring at eachother once more, maybe even with a seemingly deeper understanding of the others' character. As Dean began sitting down, he briefly thought about pressing the pedal to the metal and getting the hell out of there, but before the thought could even finish forming, the man sat down next to him in one swift motion. He looked at Dean expectantly. Dean just sighed, turned his eyes on the road, and started driving once again.
The hunter was holding his arm out, shovel in hand. Dean slowly lifted his arm and took it from him, keeping his eyes fixed to a point behind the man, trying to both hide his shame and show the man that he was both thankful and sorry. It seemed to work. The hunter nodded.
"Hey man, I just wanted to ask you... can I know your name? It's cool if you don't give me a real one, I get that, I just need something to call you. You know, since we're kind of in this together, and all that stuff."
Dean blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected thankfulness, not after feeling the cold steel against his throat. The man continued.
Dean came to a halt next to him, a grin on his face, and sat the bleach down on one of the benches.
The stranger looked away awkwardly.
Dean quickly shut his mouth when he felt the blade press into his throat hard enough to restrict his breathing. He croaked out a hasty apology, and could have almost cried with relief when the blade was removed from him.
Only now did Dean notice how weirdly inhuman he had looked before. Almost dead, or soulless, or something similar.
Then, suddenly, he lowered his gaze. Cautiously, he lifted his other arm, in which he still held the axe.
"I did."
"I shouldn't have let you come near me. You are in danger by being near me." The man let his gaze drop, if only for a second, an unreadable expression on his face.
The sudden icyness of his surroundings shocked him, and the wind made him feel small and vulnerable, but he stood his ground and kept his eyes on the man.
"You aged well, if that's the case."
Darkness was already creeping in, the slither of light over the horizon growing fainter as the minutes ticked on. It wasn't snowing, thankfully, but it could start up again any second. It had been a turbulent winter, and the man was grateful that it was nearing its' end. He wasn't prepared for harsh weather, not as much as he should be. His head was entirely uncovered, dark brown hair whipping through the wind and creating the image of someone unhinged and delirious.
"Please", the hunter repeated.
"Vietnam."
The driver kept sneaking glances at this strange, way-too-young-looking veteran on his passenger seat, and uneasiness grew inside of him. Something started to feel off. It wasn't what the man had been saying, not exactly. It made sense, sort of; when you didn't think too much about it, he might be telling the truth. But the way he was talking was... odd. Very calculated, straight to the point, no joking around or sarcasm. If the driver didn't know better, he'd think the man was on the spectrum, though he knew that the military didn't take kindly to things like that, especially not in the 70s.
I have to drag the boys including Cas out of the water to eat some lunch but once they start eating, they devour everything.
Just as I was about to question Jackie, the figure in the bed moves, and recognition registers in his good eye.
Castiel” I whispered
Sam couldn’t be more transparent if he tried, “Sam, for the love of Jack, spit it out? What’s on your mind?” I ask him.
I was on my feet flying after him before I knew what I was doing. He had disappeared from sight, but I was aware of his angelic presence. He was headed towards the garage. I knew he probably wanted to be alone, but unless he came outright and told me that, I wasn’t leaving him alone.
The first and only time I saw Cas crying was that goddamn awful day in the dungeon when he told me he loved me, and then the Empty took him.
Jimmy tries again, “What about Michael. I hate leaving him, Dean”.
When we have the last of the equipment put away, I'm walking back out of the barn when Cas speaks, “Robin seems nice. Maybe you might be able to spend some time with her, you know, while you’re here”
SIOBHAN
“So, you’re together, together” Jack said
“Dean, Dean wake up. Dean, I got you, you have to wake up”
Opening eyes that are now filling with tears, he continues, “I could see it in Michael’s eyes, the fear, like everything is out of his control.
Cas’s face was so earnest that I replied, “Cas the kiss was fine, better than fine, I just…………..wait a second, next time??”
“Dean Winchester do you not remember Lucifer?? And what he did to me?? And when he was caged it was my son that was King of Hell.”
…………………………………………………………………………………………..
I liked the kitchen immediately. The walls and cabinets were cream with yellow accessories. The curtains, the handles on the kitchen cabinet doors, even the mugs on the table all yellow. It gave the impression of warmth, sunshine, but more importantly, it was welcoming.
The last five months have been a journey of sorts where my emotions with Cas are concerned. Five months ago, he told me he loved me and then he was gone.
Patting his shoulder, I ask “Any particular flavour?”
“Oh right, here we go, time for some smiting is it?” Chuck taunted
Sonny lowered himself to one of the beds looking a lot pale now, “Dean, seriously, it’s the least I can do. Believe me, what you have taken on is not going to be easy, you are going to be glad of a comfortable bed at the end of your day”.
“Well I got a car that was delivered here last Tuesday, and I was told to make sure you got it. Apparently, you loaned it to a friend” he said scratching his head
Wings burst from Castiel’s shoulders blades as they embraced.
Before entering Jimmy’s room, Trace signs in at the nurse’s station and then with the Deputy on duty, then I introduce him to Cas and Jimmy.
Sonny straightened up and starts walking back towards the house, “Look I don’t leave to start my treatment for a couple of days, so I can show you the ropes myself and introduce you to the boys and to Rose. So, are you both ready to run Sonny’s home for wayward boys?”
“Sam, you told me you read the letter, so you know why I left, yes?
Immediately the sequence of events with Castiel and the boys went through my head again ending with Castiel telling me he loved me before he is taken by the Entity. I was shaking by the end of it and stumbled to a park bench nearby and sat in it.
Siobhan looked at him puzzled but then she just nodded.
“Ok” he said. “One bath ready to go.”
“I feed their bellies, Dean. I give cooking lessons now and again. But it’s not me they come to when they have a nightmare or when somethings bothering them. It’s you and Cas and Sonny.
I sighed and said “Cas, we didn’t get a chance to tell you this but, well, I’m not staying here. I’m actually leaving in a few weeks”.
“I know what you mean” Dean groaned turning his face into my neck. “I am literally fried but I still want you both”
Dean took Siobhan from my arms and embraced her repeating over and over, “Never do that to us again”
Cas looks up as I open the door and we stare at each other through the glass and steam.
Jimmy hugs them while Keith and Nicholas shake Sam’s hand and sign goodbye to Eileen.
Dean swallowed hard and then nodded at me.
Giggling helplessly, Cas and I watch as the normally stoic Nicholas takes his turn and squeals as he’s launched into the air, landing in what has to be a painful belly flop.
I smile into the phone, “I don’t know about that. I’m kind of partial to your cooking.”
It’s another bright and sunny day as Cas and I watch them playing outside from the window in the office as we wait for Helen to arrive with the counselor. Right on the dot of 3pm, Helen’s blue saloon drives into the yard.
Before I could answer, Cas came around the side of the house and his face lit up when he saw me. I couldn’t stop the smile that crossed my face in return.
But of course, the first drugstore I find in Hurleyville is a small Mom and Pop place where you are watched like a hawk. The fact I’m a strange face is not making it better. There is no way I’m picking up lube here.
I walked over and sat on the bed facing him.
I give Sam a bitchface worthy of him as Cas blushes endearingly, which has me winking at him, saying, “Maybe later” and I’m rewarded with another blush before he mutters “Dean”.
I look at Sam and Eileen in horror, feeling even worse than when I had to ask him to leave the bunker, years before.
Cas smiles and nods, “Anytime Dean”
I retreated to my room.
Jimmy spoke up then, “Does she use sign language? I learned a bit of sign language at my last school”.
I turned to Jack “When you found her, was Chuck hurting her, physically I mean?” the bastard had already hurt her emotionally
His words hit me square against my chest and I don’t know how long I knelt there, still holding his hand and watched him sleep.
“Where is everyone” I ask him.
Pinning my gaze on her I said coldly “Well she’s not too fond of people who murder her son and turn her parents against her”
Jody scoffs, “What am I saying? Sure they don’t care now.”
Cas was rock hard and soft as satin. He was also burning hot. He felt amazing.
I looked at Rowena “Can you do it?”
Dean sat down on the bed and never felt more alone.
Eileen takes Cas’s side.
“Jack was is it? he said
Sometimes, later when Michael is all cried out, I draw comfort in just holding him. Michael has gone lax in my arms, and for a minute, I think he has fallen asleep. But soon, he shifts and looks up at me, “What’s that?” he asks.
Naomi eyes widened for a fraction before she said “Who told you that? she asked
I squeezed Dean’s shoulders so he would know I was ok with this. Dean was right, we had to give ourselves every option we could.
I couldn’t tell him everything, but I could tell him something.
Later that evening just as we are finishing dinner, my phone starts buzzing in my pocket. I pull it out and my heart leaps when I see Sam’s name on the screen. Jumping up I grab Cas, roaring “Back in a minute” to the boys as we run out onto the porch. Hitting the video button, Sam’s face appears on screen, “Dean, we just finished. Everyone’s ok. we are all good”
So that’s what I did. I told the whole crazy story of Adam.
Its when I step out onto the porch, that I see Rose sitting on the seat with Michael, who smiles when he sees me.
Cas tightens his arms around before he turns me around to face him. His face searches mine before he says, “Just do me one favour, Dean. If you are going to do something stupid like take Jimmy and hide him, at least give me a heads up first, ok?”
At his puzzled look I explained to Dean about trying to contact Rowena and Naomi.
He stops short when he gets to the mantle above the fireplace. The whole mantle is covered with pictures of him and Sam on their last visit here.
Michael’s nod is eager and infectious. I hope to give them all a great weekend because they deserve it, but nothing is going to soften the blow of telling them Jimmy is leaving. It won’t be just Michael that will be devastated to lose him.
Returning the hug, she says, “You too Dean”
I lean forward and say, “I never for a moment thought you did, Cas either”
After dinner, I leave
She needs to regroup, focus, but all the lessons with Jack might as well have been in double-dutch for all she could remember. Had the Entity won, had it damaged her mind so much that she was now just a helpless human again.
“I thought after we caught them on the couch in the TV room, they would behave themselves” Cas muttered darkly
“C’mon” Dean said “Let me introduce you”
“But Jack”, Sam said, “Can it do that, reset the Universe?”
Letting Cas lead, I stay silent, staying nearby in case Cas needs me, but he has it covered.
Jack’s arms circle his back, “Hi Dean.”
Hurleyville is jammed. We had to park up, a half mile from the centre of town. Apparently, people come from towns all round to visit the fair.
Apparently, Michael had been very tense to be back at the hospital, so his attention was on keeping Michael distracted.
But if you must fight, Cas and I will show you some basics that can help you get the upper hand so you can get away, ok.
Young Dean lowers the gun and returns it to its hiding place before saying, “I thought my Dad was exaggerating some of his stories with you, but they’re all true, aren’t they?”
Jody and Donna stare at them for a hot minute before Jody turns to Donna, “It’s that story more than anything that convinces me that this is Sam and Dean.”
Two tears make their way down my face. I don’t know if they are tears of sadness or frustration. Maybe a bit of both.
Michael smiles at me and whispers, “Ok” and my heart stutters.
But Dean still doesn’t look at him. He stops a few feet from the Impala before saying, “Hey Dean.”
“No, I didn’t. But when you told your story to us that night about how he died, something didn’t add up. I asked Naomi when I went to meet her. I asked her if she killed him. She said no but I’m not sure I believed her. But I had no proof, Siobhan” Jack said
“You don’t know the whole story Sam. Cas and I weren’t exactly angels if you excuse the pun. She had a right to be hurt and to leave.”
We were still lying on the bonnet of a shiny red car. I leaned up on my elbows to look down at her. She was smiling back at me with half closed eyes.
I never felt more at sea.
At that, Donna’s smile is blinding before launching herself at Dean. Squeezing him tightly, she whispers, “We’ve missed you. We’ve missed you so much. Sam too”
I reached my right hand around to grab Cas’s cock and push it between the cheeks of my ass and rub it slowly against my hole. I couldn’t believe myself how much I wanted this. Cas’s groan gave me the courage to keep going.
“I don’t know Cas. But if it’s true, we need to find that out as well” Dean said
I look at Sonny now, really look at him and I can see he has lost weight. His face is pale and there are shadows under his eyes. His green and black plaid shirt is hanging off one shoulder and the belt on his jeans is spanning his waist twice. No matter how nervous I feel, I'm even more sure of my decision to come here.
Rowena drained her drink and handed the glass to Sam “This time make it a double”
Jimmy looks at us in amazement, “What?”
“What, no. I didn’t mean” that Dean said
Cas, still holding her hand, covers it with his other, “Amy, it was our pleasure to mind Nicholas while you got better, and now you are going home together. Concentrate on that, not the past and Dean, and I are here if you need us. I mean it”.
Squeezing his shoulder again, I stood up before I threw myself at him and made a fool of myself.
“Well are you going to let us in? We’ll catch our death standing out here” she said in her thick Scottish accent with a devilish smile on her face.
I heard him call her name “Siobhan can you hear me? but I didn’t hear a response.
And Cas smiles at me. A smile not unlike the smile he gave me that awful day in the dungeon of the bunker when he told me he loved me, and then the Empty took him away from me.
Since then, we have gone through every trial and tribulation you can think of and then some and have come out the other side.
Dean grins and asks hopefully, “Lottery numbers?”
Sam and Jack went to her home, Dean and Castiel waited in a café across from her place of work, a doctor’s surgery where she worked as a secretary.
Cas is grinding against my fingers now, wanting more. My fingers now plunging in, I find the holy grail and graze my fingers against it.
“Good morning Dean”
“I need a drink. We are all going to need a drink” I said “And make it stronger than wine”
Dean spins around at hearing his brothers voice, “Sam?”
Dean turned to Sam and said “What are you waiting for? Call Rowena. I want to leave as soon as possible. Siobhan can I talk to you please”
Nicholas runs out, leaving the three of us alone and beaming before Helen turns serious, “I’ll keep a better eye this time, Dean, I promise.”
“Jack’s gone”
“Why? asked Cas
For the next few hours I kissed, stroked and touched this beautiful man, telling him over and over everything I loved about him and how I would never leave him. We climbed together on sensations so exquisite, so mind blowing that when we fell, we fell together.
I wanted to help Sonny.
Sam answers on the fourth ring, “Poughkeepsie.” I said
Slowing I started to become aware of voices in the darkness and I was overwhelmed with a serious case of déjà vu.
I gave him a mock glare, “You keep telling me you love me and then you disappear”.
“Siobhan, stop, this is not your fault. You left because you thought you were doing the right thing by me and Dean” Cas said “And we love you for that. But we are together now, and we want you to come home with us”
“Ah don’t mention it, Mi casa, tu casa” she said grinning
I eventually drag us into the shower for a quick clean up before snuggling back into bed.
Naomi looked at me puzzled “The future, I didn’t give you that ability”
“Hmmm maybe, all I know is we have got to get them to stop. Otherwise, we are going to have to move out”
“So ok, if I’m ok, not injured, not hurting, which I’m not, how come I’m not getting kisses. Do I not deserve kisses? Like what does a girl have to do to get kisses around……………
I had been in my room an hour soul searching when I had come to a conclusion.
The sound of a twig snapping, followed by a grunt, is all he hears before he picks up the growl. And not just any growl; that growl is from a Hellhound.
Passing the ambulance bay, I keep going until I find a visitor's seating area, and my luck must be changing because it’s relatively empty at this time, just past the lunch hour.
Jimmy’s words hit me square in the chest and leaves me poleaxed. I thought after our talk yesterday, we were ok. Trying to gather my thoughts and not focus on the bloom of hurt at his words, I tell him, “Jimmy, that's not what’s going on. I know you want to go home. I would never try to change that. But I meant it when I said you were like family to me, and I would like to keep in touch with you.”
But that happens Monday.
“Popular place” I quipped to Jack who just smiled at me. Then the smile vanished from his face. I looked towards the sandbox and the air was now swirling with white and silver smoke. A figure appeared and coalesced into Naomi.
Castiel’s face went slack with shock and then crumbled and he said “NO. This isn’t happening, no no.”
Cas beams at her, “I’ll pick some seeds up tomorrow. I’ll get Jimmy to help me. Where would you like it.”
I wanted to help, but I was useless, I wanted to pray, but there was no one to pray to and the one person I wanted to talk to about all this was also going through his own hell.
“Oh Dean I wish I could, but I have another couple of house calls to make” she replied “I’m just letting you know that the doctor on my recommendation, is taking out Michael’s stitches, and removing the bag on Monday. I informed Michael just now and Cas and I decided that I would collect them both and bring them to and from the hospital”
Helen replies, “Normally no, I wouldn’t have access to that information, but I have a friend in the office, and she knows Jimmy is one of mine.”
Making my way around the side of the house, I pass the vegetable garden that’s starting to flower, the garden that Jimmy planted with his own two hands, that he won’t now see to fruition and I try to tamp down my temper and my fear. I am so afraid for him.
“After everything is done” I said “That way we can relax and enjoy it”
“Dean, there she is”
Feeling a little warm under the collar from the attention that I was getting from both Travis and the squinty side eyes I was getting from Cas, I walk out onto the porch to call Michael.
She nodded yes with pursed lips and I laughed “Welcome to the club”
Sam was at the table with the ingredients for the spell to get them ready to go in a silver pot.
He's my responsibility. If I don’t look after him, who will?
He picked it up and brought it over to me, and I waited.
SIOBHAN
Cas’s face softens into a smile, “Only because that’s familiar and you know how to handle it. But Dean, you can do anything you put your mind to. And don’t forget I’ve seen how you handle victims of the Supernatural, kids and adults alike. You have already the skills to draw on here. I don’t doubt you for a minute”
I could barely catch my breath.
Cas just stares at me and the colour seems to drain from his face “Leaving. You mean like on a hunt”.
Naomi said “Welcome to Heaven. You will have to wait here.” She said to Cas, Dean and Sam. “I cannot allow you to enter Heaven any further. I promise I am not going far with Siobhan and Jack.”
Leaning forward to grab his face, I pull him towards me, "After everything we have gone through to get here, Cas, I'm sorry but I'm not letting you go. If we ever break up it's because you decide to, not me”.
Jimmy is looking out to the ocean when he asks “Did you really spend time at Sonny’s?
That was true. We’re spoiled with Rose doing all the cooking and truth be told we don’t have to cook on Sundays either as she usually leaves something for us in the freezer.
I watched as Dean followed Cas carrying Siobhan down the corridor, then when they were gone from view, I found the nearest chair and sat heavily into it.
I turned to Jack “Isn’t it funny that usually people are telling you to, Go to Hell”
Eventually we parted from each other. I smiled up at both of them and said “I’ll go pack my bag. I need to see Jack and Sam”
Eventually I managed to whisper, “What was that?”
They’re dressed like they came off the cover of a GQ magazine. Alt Sam is wearing a wine blazer and shirt, complete with ascot, navy dress pants and still sporting the man bun.
Cas ambles in last, hair wet from his shower, wearing long black shorts and his sky-blue t-shirt. The clothes only highlight his dark hair and his blue eyes, that I can’t take my eyes off of him.
