"Dean," she said, looking him sternly in the eye. "We need to show that we aren't weak. This couldn't have come at a worse time. With Bela's news about the Novaks, a wedding would prove to our enemies that the Winchester bloodline, the Family, is still strong. Your father is the reason we aren't wallowing in the gutter like rats. Without him, those who would seek to destroy us will move against our empire with the forces of Hell behind them." She dropped her hand and, eyes pleading, stepped back.
He thought to himself.
The door to his bedroom had been left open slightly to the hallway outside and Dean walked slowly, quietly towards it an peeked his head out. The hallway was dark, but Dean could tell something wasn't right. He needed to find his Mommy and Daddy. He stepped out of his room and started walking slowly down the hallway towards their room, being careful not to make a sound as he went so he didn't wake up his baby brother Sammy.
"Chuck?" Dean asked quietly. "Where am I? What is this place? What have you done with Sam? And Jack? And where is Cas?"
"Dean!" Castiel's firm voice filled Dean's head, dragging him out of the memory of the night his mom died and forcing him gasping back into the reality of his life. "You have to stay focused, Dean. None of these memories are actually happening to you, they're just that; memories." He forced himself to remain composed as the intensity of Dean's emotion rushed through their mind link and hit him like a meteorite.
"Um, I...I guess not, no. Not if you took my last name anyway." He quipped. And suddenly, Cas' lips were on his and oh god if he had thought that Creation had felt like bliss, it was only because he hadn't had THIS yet. Cas kissed him like the sky was falling down around them, like tomorrow would never come, and when he pulled away, there were tears shining in his eyes.
Dean didn't even think about his answer before it was out of his mouth. "No, don't do that." He paused for a second and then said, "Y'know, I'm gonna have questions, besides, not all my defining memories can be bad, right?"
He loved this city. Every dirty stairwell, every seedy bar, every doorway that led to nowhere, Dean knew them all. He had grown up on these streets, and he wouldn't change it for the world.
Castiel shook his head. "Father was very clear. He said I would know what to do. I must pass through the flames..." he looked straight into Uriel's eyes. "Alone."
"Dean Smith?" Lee chided. "Really?"
Come hang out with me on
Any remaining happiness Dean had from the alcohol was extinguished. His feet stopped moving, and his own voice seemed distant as he spoke. "What's wrong, Sammy? What happened?"
"No, it's fine. Thanks though. Just maybe don't go home yet? No sense keeping the wife awake if I need to call you again in a few hours." Dean said and forced a smile.
"Hey, hey, Sammy, listen, I'm okay." He tried desperately to soothe his brother's worries. The panic in Sam's tone had sobered him, and he transformed immediately into Big Brother. His primary focus was back on protecting his little brother, making sure he wasn't afraid. "Everything is fine. I'm not wasted, just a little buzzed. I'm gonna call Benny for a ride and head back to my place. I'll text you when I'm home and call you in the morning, okay?"
Dean looked away as Lee made a few more drinks for some of the other patrons. He couldn't bring himself to look him in the eyes. He was right; Dean
Dean stiffened. "Uh, actually, mom...there's something else I've gotta tell you..."
"Now, Chuck and Naomi had four sons before she passed. Apparently, everyone is a bloody Catholic because they named them all after archangels, the poor boys. Chuck started sort of 'collecting' street kids who had lost their families to the gang wars. He took them in, made them a home, and built his own family, not out of associates and partners like you lot, but an actual family of brothers and sisters." She pushed her glass away and leaned forward into Dean, dropping her voice barely above a whisper. Dean had to move even closer to catch her words as the music from the club's speakers continued to fill his senses. "They are ruthless. Especially the four oldest brothers. They will fight and kill and bleed for their family, and they will smile while they're doing it. You think you and Samuel are close? You've got nothing on these boys."
It wasn't long before the battle sounds receded above him and he began to wonder if Nithael had been mistaken, for not only was Uriel nowhere to be seen, but the frequency of his encounters with the hellish creatures had also begun to decrease. He slowed his pace and gripped his blade tighter, alert to all that was near. Around him the souls of the damned reached forward and grasped at him, clawing at his wings, grasping at his feet, crying, pleading with broken voices and eyes that had long forgotten what it was like to gaze upon beauty. Their requests for mercy were denied however, as Castiel had only one soul he was here to save.
"Well, Dean here is about the most 'unsavoury' as it usually gets in here, and you seem to have made his acquaintance rather nicely." Lee provided with a smirk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean had been so deep in his own head that he barely registered when he had arrived at Lee's. He sat down on a barstool and scanned around the room. Dean sighed contentedly. As he had expected, the bar was devoid of anyone immediately recognizable save for Lee himself.
"I...it was a joke, Cas." Dean said slightly embarrassed and more than a little shocked at the angel's suddenly very apparent lack of understanding of human interaction.
"Yeah, you always did hate those." Lee whipped the towel off his shoulder and picked up another glass, wiping the water from around the rim. "Anything exciting?"
Dean scoffed. "Of course she'll say yes! You two have been together, what, forever?" He grinned. "Although, if she does say no, you can tell her I'm available."
In the beginning, God created all things. He created space and all the celestial bodies within it. The planets and moons and suns and stars, comets and black holes and asteroids and nebulae.
Pain the likes of which he had never felt shot through his body. Every once of him seared with agony and he stumbled forward a few steps. He allowed the tip of one of his wings to curl forwards around himself and his breath hitched in his chest.
He had work to do.
Cas shook his head. "I don't know. I don't believe so. This doesn't feel like Heaven. It feels like...earth. It feels like home…"
Castiel turned one final time to his warriors, his brothers and sisters, his family, and said "This is Father's will."
"I dunno. Sam just called and said I needed to get home." He thumbed at the screen of his phone idly. "Could be anything."
"It's okay, Dean. You can be happy now."
The demons around Alastair shuffled an muttered nervously. It was as if Castiel had released a swarm of mosquitoes into their midst they way they began to wring their hands together and rub the backs of their necks. For a moment, even Alastair's face flashed a look of concern before reverting to its original, confident veneer.
"No." Castiel said. "I believe you to be a generally good human being, and therefore your memories must mostly be pure."
"We were all sitting around after I proposed to Jess..." Sam kept his eyes forward, unblinking. "Mom and Dad were so happy. Mom, she couldn't stop talking about colour schemes and napkin patterns. Dad and I were going down to the cellar to get another bottle of wine. He insisted. Said, 'it's not every day your son gets engaged.'" He laughed darkly as they reached the master bedroom, and Sam rested his hand on the doorknob. Dean stopped in his tracks behind him. "He just...dropped, Dean. I didn't even have time to catch him before he hit the floor." Sam looked up, and Dean saw tears brimming in his already red-rimmed eyes. He opened the door to the bedroom, and they both stepped inside.
"Thank you Dean." Castiel said quietly.
"Well, Mr. Smith, thank you for this...eventful evening. When I say the pleasure was mine, I mean it most sincerely." He took one last long swig from his beer and clambered off of his seat. "Perhaps if I'm lucky, I'll get the chance to see you again." He turned on his heel, trenchcoat billowing behind him as the breeze from the door caught it. Then he was gone.
Dean's eyes opened wide, a powerful force tugging at his heart. What did HE want? Only a couple of people in Dean's entire life had ever asked him what HE wanted. And it's not like it had ever mattered anyway; Dean Winchester didn't get to have what he wanted. There was always something else more important.
Bela's face tinged pink slightly at the admonishing tone in Sam's voice, and she puffed her cheeks out before speaking out again. "Under regular circumstances, Samuel, I would, but it seems that these Novaks are a bit better at playing cat and mouse than I would have anticipated."
The city at night always had a certain charm about it that Dean couldn't put his finger on. Maybe it was the way everything lit up a bit more or the fact that the darkness hid the grime that clung to every surface like a second skin, but the alleyways and culverts of the buildings seemed more inviting when they were filled with shadow.
No fear, no pain, no questioning if what I do's enough.
"Ya see, it takes a lot to stay on one of these things for very long. Takes some serious will power. You gotta be a real tough customer to resist the temptation of comin' down." He walked to the nearest rack, where the soul of a woman was dangling there, crying. The man walked behind her and leaned down close to her ear. He liked slowly, sickly up the side of her neck and she started to beg for him to stop, beg for it to end. "What's that, sweetheart? You want me to stop? Wanna make all this pain go away?" He dragged the blade across her flesh, all the while never breaking eye contact with Castiel. "Shh,  shh shh, shhShe,  " he crooned softly in her ear, brushing her hair from her face. "You've only been here a few days, I had 40 years to live through, you can stand a little more."
"Cas?"
"Yeah, well, brother or not, he's still a giant pain." Dean downed the rest of his drink and tapped the rim for a refill. Lee shook his head but complied.
"That is...oddly specific," Dean said when he recovered.
"Cas, you're really not making a lot of sense here."
"In English." Dean snapped at her.
“C'mon Cas, let’s go home.”
Uriel stared at Castiel, his youngest brother, his commander, and his eyes were filled with sadness. He knew his brother was stubborn beyond compare and that once his mind was made up, nothing could stop him. "I could go with you?" he said, though he knew it was in vain.
Dean tuned out most of the ensuing conversations. It was the typical discussion of territory, who was responsible for handling the gang activity on the west side, who was collecting from which businesses for protection owed and whether or not they had paid (Dean received a small nod of approval from John when he informed the table that Gordon would no longer be causing issues).
"Always keep a condom in my wallet, Sammy." Dean winked, and Sam rolled his eyes dramatically.
Dean felt the heat of embarrassment rise up in him as Castiel spoke. "Wait, so you're telling me you can see everything I see? In all of my memories?"
"Who are you?" Castiel asked. He appeared to be a man, but the unmistakable stench of demon rose off him like a cloud of poison.
"You didn't think I wouldn't take advantage of having the great hunter, Dean Winchester on my rack, did you?" he looked at Castiel and chuckled. "Come on Angel, you can't be that stupid."
He cut the line with a curt nod to the bouncer and walked through the doors into the dimly lit club. Dean felt the tension of the evening evaporate from his limbs as soon as the pervading scent of cherries and tequila washed over him. The black brick walls and tables draped in blood-red velvet made the room feel smaller than it really was. It was hardly past midnight, and yet every table was full of men, mostly suits from the business district here to pretend their sexless marriages weren't failing. Dean snorted. Sam could have his apple-pie life with Jess; at least Dean would never end up like these poor schmucks.
"So I can't see or move because I'm not really here?" Dean asked.
Castiel travels through the second circle of Hell and finally finds the soul of the Righteous Man, but is he too late to save him?
"Yeah, I was over at the mill. Gordon owes us and is being...difficult." He reached for the bottle of wine that sat on the table and filled his glass. He wasn't usually a fan of wine, but Cain always brought out the good bottles for these meetings, and when he didn't have to pay, it would be rude to refuse.
"That was thirteen years ago, Lee," Dean said, his voice dropping. "Things are different now."
But Winchesters didn't have friends.
As he balled his fists, ready to start swinging, he felt someone step into the space at his side.
"My name is Castiel Novak."
The Angels wept. God had abandoned them. They had lost their Father. Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael urged them to follow the orders that God had given them before he disappeared; to observe and protect man as He had bidden them, and many of them followed the three archangels to Earth. But Lucifer did not agree.
"You seem like you're in a better mood than a couple hours ago," Benny said, handing Dean a still hot take-out cup of coffee over the back of the seat. He glanced in the rearview mirror and, spying the menacing grin that remained hanging on Dean's lips, he groaned.
Dean chuckled to himself at the memory as he slid quietly into the seat next to his younger brother, Sam.
"I, uh, I met one of them already. Tonight. At Lee's." He gulped as the fire in Mary's eyes flared, then dissipated. "Castiel. I assume he's one of the adopted kids."
A glimpse of moments left undone, the words I could not find.
I hope this went well, again, more exposition, but hopefully I'll be allowed to write more development in the next chapter....
Rowena was a tiny woman who had come from Scotland and made quite the name for herself in America's lucrative sex industry. She ran a tight ship with her girls, who did everything from stripping to pornography to escort work, and, in the case of Ruby and a few others, the occasional special favour for the Winchesters. No man controlled Rowena or her girls, and if anyone ended up on the wrong side of the devious little redhead, they were likely to find themselves in a sealed box at the bottom of the river.
Dean let his grin deepen as his mother's intentions became evident in his mind. He could see her plan formulating, even as the gears turned in her brain. "He did."
Castiel did as he had been told. He maintained his garrison on Earth. He remembered what Father had told him, still not understanding His final words, yet never forgetting. Until one day, Castiel awoke as if from a dream.
Castiel approached cautiously. The aching pull of his heart was stronger than ever, and he knew he had found the Righteous Man. He extended his hand towards the man, and grasped his shoulder, turning him around to face him. As the demon - no, the man, for this was the clearly the soul Castiel had come to save - looked into his eyes, he felt something shatter in him.
His wings, those glorious feathers of pure white, which Castiel had always held in such high regard and been so proud of when standing next to his brothers in Heaven,  we're no more. In place of beautiful, soft white feathers now hung scorched black abominations. He reached out and touched the tip of his wing sadly. They were whole, not burned off like the flesh of his hands had been, buy they were now jet black, burned dark as the night sky by the hell fire. He extended his grace as much as he dared, trying to heal his burnt wings. The cool blue glow encircled them, rippled through the feathers with raw power, cascaded over the joints and around the planes of downy softness, but to no avail. Castiel pulled back his grace and a single tear rolled down this cheek. The damage had been done and grace could not undo it. His wings would remain black for the rest of eternity.
With as much remaining grace as he could muster, Castiel disassembled himself and Dean on a molecular level and transported them through time to the safest place he could think of, a place between the world's of Earth and Heaven and hell, far from the reach of Alastair or any of the other angels or humans or demons or anyone. As they traveled through the expanse of the void between space and time, Castiel reached out with the mental link he shared with his brothers and sisters.
Or can I simply wonder what it's like to be without?
It didn't matter that it was the end of the world. It didn't matter that Dean and Sam had spent their entire lives fighting against exactly this, only for it to happen anyway. It didn't matter that the angels had fallen and Cas and Jack had lost their grace. Because the end of this world means that everything can start anew.
Dean chuckled. "No, I'm usually good on my own, Cas. It's just been a long day."
"I'll be sure to call you, quick as a whip." She said sarcastically. He nodded and headed towards the door. Pamela's earlier proposition rang in his ears, and, as much as he wished he could stay and accept, his gut was telling him to return home and relay the information from Rowena to his brother.
The Alpha wiped at his face, scratching at his scruff while he tried to un-clenched his jaw. But he did have a new purpose now. He looked up to see Castiel waddling in, dressed in black maternity clothes, his stomach round with the unborn pup and wearing his collar. He was beautiful and looked much healthier after only a day of being with the Winchester pack, and it filled Dean with pride. This would be his path now. He had already set everything in motion by claiming the male Omega, and Dean would honor him and the little girl growing in his stomach. He would honor Adam, step in and take care of Castiel, and truth be told, Dean very much looked forward to having a pup around… He would raise her as his own, and the thought of it made his heart swell with joy and his wolf wanted to howl in excitement… That was the bright spot in this whole horrible mess… the pup.
“It’s nice to finally meet you, Cas. Dean had been raving about you all during the Hunts.” Sam nodded his hello.
A noise coming from downstairs brought her out of her thoughts. The house was always alive one way or another, with five—now six—people residing here, along with the two guards that keep watch outside… She looked over at Dean, who was still sound asleep, as she sat up. The Alpha was a deep sleeper unless something was actually wrong. Dean had an uncanny ability to be on alert the moment something was off in his immediate surroundings, which tended to be the house.
The once powerful Sorceress screamed until Dean crushed her. The sounds of her bones and her skeletal form breaking and cracking was sickening as blood spilled from her mouth, nose and eyes. Her body went slack when Dean removed himself from her. Only the shackles that held her to the wooden pool held her up.
“Just how far along is Omega Castiel?” Crowley stepped in, clearly curious and just as put off by Ishim’s announcement, yet quite gifted at keeping a poker face.
The Alpha swam between them, enjoying their pain as he then settled before Hester, who glared at him even in her deteriorating state. Dean smiled at her, a terrifying sight as his sharp teeth glistened and his eyes glowed. Before she could utter a word, four of his tentacles wrapped firmly around her, almost covering the whole of her, and he started to
Neither did.
Jimmy bolted up much too quickly for his system to agree with, and his head pounded as his breakfast threatened to come up. He had a lot of thinking to do. He was too confused to ask anyone what these new things meant, but he could feel the urgency inside of him. It bordered on a desperation, this need to understand what the fuck all of that had been, and what it meant.
“I love the lights,” Castiel whispered against Dean's shoulder, as he trailed his nose and lips to kiss wherever they landed.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Here comes Ketch. You’re lucky that Dean is busy with his daughter. First you touch his Omega, and now you’re trespassing in his private home.”
Castiel was beautiful and soft in ways she wasn’t. He was gentle and loving, care radiating off of him in an innocent and pure wave that made her want to recoil. She saw in all five minutes of her interactions with the male Omega that he was a special one. He was better than her and she felt it, her insecurities rising and threatening to choke her. She had never been an insecure Omega, had always been cool headed if not a bit overly confident throughout her life.
“Hi!” A bouncing redhead came towards them as they opened the door, and Castiel found himself swept up into a hug by the Omega. “I’m Charlie, welcome to the Winchester Pack!”
“Gonna breed you so good,” Dean growled against him as he spun him around, carefully held by his powerful tentacles, and Castiel barely had a moment to ready himself before the Cecaelia’s massive phallus pushed into him and the Warrior started a ferocious pace, indeed breeding him with abandon. The Omega moaned and mewled in time to his Alpha’s every movement. He came in an almost blinding euphoric daze that tingled all the way down to the tips of his tail fins.
Missouri’s words whispered in his mind and this...this must have been what it all meant. He had to end up here…to meet Castiel and find his true mate? Could he truly be this lucky? After everything that had happened…his pack, his family…
After delivering the caudal fin of her son’s murderer to Lorraine and holding the elderly Omega Cecaelia as she wept in relief, Dean promptly brought Castiel home to his cave. The Omega had been smiling at him wickedly since they had left the Blood Waters, and Dean wasn’t sure what had his beautiful mate so elated.
Dean glared at the room, his confusion clear as he had no idea where the hell he was and what this place held. Held seemed like the appropriate word. He tried to examine his surroundings.  While the place was a bit aged, it was functional, and even with the weirdest of every surface covered with the symbols, there didn’t seem to be any personal items of any kind.
As he listened to Castiel fall asleep against him, he smiled and made a note to bring the fairy lights with them on their next vacation. He had finally been able to vocalize his feelings to Castiel and maybe, just maybe, the next time those fairy lights will serve to help him propose.
“Crowley is my cousin. We were both born and raised here, and pull our magic from here. Our ancestors built this place. I’m sure you’ve noticed the runes and Triskelion.”
The roar of rolling thunder sounded outside as rain still showered down heavily. With the cozy warmth of the blanket fort and the soft glow of the fairy lights and having Dean’s right arm holding him close as his fingertips danced over his bare skin, he couldn't be happier. His body still tingled from their love making and his heart was still learning to embrace the words Dean had spoken just minutes ago.
“Alright, everyone’s here and we have more than enough witnesses. Castiel, you will need to sign here and then Dean. After that we’ll ink Lily’s foot and stamp it on the document,” Crowley instructed. Castiel quickly did as told and returned to Dean’s side so Lily could focus on him while the Alpha signed the document with his free hand.
“Oh yes, Castiel is still currently here. The doctors wanted to keep him for observation. He will be coming back to deal with his new position just as soon as you collect your brother,” Naomi voiced. There had been something in her tone that made Dean’s wolf sneer while Pam full on glared at the Beta.
“Hey!” It took the two a moment to pull away enough to see Charlie standing in the hallway, hold her nose. “Oh my gods, of course you two would go into a mating frenzy right from the get go. Go upstairs! I’ll take care of Lily and things. Go! Shoo!!” The redhead was pushing Dean, who was holding Castiel closer while they both growled at her. Another Omega near his Alpha… Castiel couldn't think straight, he had no idea how Dean managed to get them upstairs, but then he was laying on Dean’s massive bed with the Alpha kissing him deeply.
The carpenter’s eyes went wide as fear filled him…that was his husband’s voice, Cas’s voice. How??....
As the wind picked up, he closed his eyes and let the feeling of nature’s powerful energy surrounded him. There was the scent of salt and sand, and the cool water drops drifted all over him.The winds felt like a caress, as if he were being promised that there was definitely
Jimmy came to lying stiff  on his hardwood  floor. Slowly his eyes began to focus, and he saw he was mere inches from his clawfoot tub. He frowned and closed his eyes once more to try and temper the headache that was pounding at his temples like war drums. He tried to concentrate on the memories that had assaulted him, but his mind wouldn’t appease him. Instead, that flashback had brought all the ones from last week forward again. The one with the tentacles…the red tentacles were swirling in front of his eyelids.
Dean looked over at the Elders. Bobby Singer, Cain Wild, Missouri Moseley, Rowena McCloud, Donatello Redfield and Rufus Turner were some of the oldest and dearest members of the Winchester Pack. They had backed his and Sam’s father John in his prime, and before him their grandfather Henry. Winchesters were natural-born leaders and had one of the purest and strongest bloodlines. Direct descendants had gifts most of the other werewolf pack bloodlines didn’t, were much more attuned to their animal counterparts, were able to
Dean barked a laugh that startled them both and pulled them into a huge hug. “Yes, I give my blessing.”
“Hey.”
“Come…” Castiel whispered as he pulled the Alpha down so Dean would wrap him in his arms. Dean snorted.
This was becoming the new normal. Fighting, arguing or barely talking, and it was irritating Dean and his wolf to no end. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be, not between them, not after everything… and yet, no matter how much Dean tried and told himself things would get better, it didn’t seem to go that way at all.
It was only as she spoke the words that he realized that he had indeed hidden in a closet filled with harmless office and medical supplies. He sighed and eased out of the small room and briskly walked towards his office with Jody and to his surprise, Balthazar met them there.
Dean clenched his jaw as those blue eyes looked down and everything in the Alpha sudden felt utterly wrong. He felt Pam come closer as her soothing scent of sage and azalea calmed him, and watched as her scent reached Castiel who took a shaking breath in and closed his eyes. Her approach however seemed to have gained the attention of the other Alphas.
Benny had already assigned Charlie to Castiel, which was important. Like Pamela, Charlie was not only an Omega, but a bodyguard trained by Benny himself. Dean knew there would be backlash from some of the pack members because of him claiming Castiel, and Dean couldn’t protect him as needed because of his duties as Head Alpha. Charlie was the perfect fit: sweet, ridiculously intelligent and deadly to unassuming threats, which was why Omega bodyguards were the best in Dean’s arsenal. Apparently no other packs—perhaps one or two worldwide—were smart enough to see the strength in their Omegas instead of Alphas. Brute strength was one thing, but Omegas had an array of abilities Alpha’s didn’t, like using their scents to override an Alpha’s focus.
“It’s Dean, Winchester. Your mate.”
“Why? Would my omega be jealous? 😉”
As soon as Castiel was gone, Dean locked his door and made his way towards the bed. He tossed himself on the bed and groaned a little, the soft bed was relaxing his nerves in all the right ways, until he became a little too relaxed. He glanced down at his hard on and sighed, resting his head back on the pillow. Dean had promised himself he would be a better alpha than this. He wouldn’t go jerking off to some random omegas scent. But this isn’t a random omega, this is your mate. His inner monologue reminded him. After all, Castiel was clearly aroused too, so it’s not like it would hurt anything.
If there's some interest in the story I'll post chapter three soon. There will be smut in chapter three but I've never written a story like this before so don't judge me lol.
“As you wish, omega.” He smirked and kissed him again. Dean then pulled off Cas’s pants and frowned, noticing that Cas wasn’t wearing any panties underneath his sweats. On the one hand, it made Dean’s job easier, but Dean wished he could see how pretty Cas looked in panties.
“Uh Cas? It’s me-” Dean said but was interrupted with Cas quickly opening the door and pulling Dean inside the room. Cas was wearing a pair of silk pajamas that Dean had bought him, and Dean smiled softly. “I see the pajamas fit well..” He smirked.
He made his way up to Dean’s room and hugged Alfie goodbye, “Alright, I’ll see you tomorrow Alfie.” He smiled.
He made his way to his door, and Lisa walked up behind him and crossed her arms. “Where have you been Castiel? It’s against the rules to spend the night in another servants quarters.” She muttered.
Cas chuckled to himself and sighed, fixing his outfit once more before knocking on Dean’s door and waiting for Dean to open it.
“So omega, how was that?” Dean smirked and wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist. The omega rolled his eyes and nuzzled into Dean’s neck, “It was enjoyable.” He said simply.
“Mmm...maybe it’s just left over from my heat. That scent tends to linger on a bed.” He mumbled, nuzzling against Dean and taking in his scent. Just like before, Dean’s scent managed to melt away all of Cas’s stress and fears. It smelled like safety and home, Cas loved it.
The next thing Cas pulled out was a pair of deep blue slacks, a suit jacket, and a button up shirt. “I don’t see how this necklace would go very well with the suit..” He mumbled
“Like...sweeter? I guess? If that makes any sense.” He chuckled
Dean immediately tried to calm him down and he pulled Cas into a hug, “Cas, it’s ok. You’re ok, calm down..” He said and ran his fingers through his hair, “We don’t even know if you’re actually pregnant. For all we know it could be some hormone thing with the pills you're taking.” He reasoned. “We’ll get a pregnancy test after dinner, and whatever happens, you’re going to be ok. Understand?” Dean asked and rested a hand against Cas’s cheek.
This continued for a few minutes, and as Dean got closer and closer to his release, he would speed up the movements with the toy to bring Cas closer to the edge. Cas moaned a little louder around Dean and his movements became a bit more erratic. His lips were stretched thin around Dean’s cock and he whined as he felt Dean’s knot beginning to swell. “That’s it baby, almost there-” Dean encouraged and moaned, “You close omega? Gonna come from a toy and sucking me off?” He asked. Cas nodded to the best of his ability and whined, feeling the heat pool in his groin.
“Cas?” Dean asked, noticing how quickly Cas froze up.
Dean was stupid enough to expose their relationship. It had been a little over a month since they first hooked up, and every day since then Dean has left gifts at Cas’s door each night, progressively getting bigger and more personalized.
“Come on Castiel, it’ll be the best lay of your life. If you hate it, I’ll never ask to see you again, you can live your life without a mate. But if you enjoy it, you admit that we’re true mates and you let me mate you.”
The rest of the car ride was mostly quiet with Cas cuddling into Dean and taking in his scent. Dean kept Cas close as well, and they both seemed to just want to enjoy each other’s company, and neither of them had any complaints about that.
“That’s true I suppose..” Cas mumbled against Dean’s lips.
“Don’t go too crazy Cas.” Alfie joked and waved as he walked off.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was reading. Castiel knew that they were true mates, he had to by now, and his only question was what can be done? This was not the reaction he was expecting. For some reason Castiel just didn’t seem to believe that they were true mates.
That’s when the gravity of the whole situation really got through to Cas. After all, they did both have very strong reactions to one another’s scents, and Dean straight up rejected a different omega when he was in his rut. That was a feat in itself.
Dean looked over the response and his heart jumped a little. He didn’t even have a second to think before he typed back “Deal. Come to my room at 11:30.” He was absolutely thrilled at the idea of being Cas’s alpha that even the permission to court him was a step in the right direction.
Dean slipped his hand down to Cas’s breeder and smirked a devilish grin at how wet Cas already was, “Look at you..” He purred, “All wet for me already, do you get that turned on by me omega?” Dean asked. Cas was getting wetter by the second and Dean’s touches definitely helped. “Yes..” Cas moaned, because it was true. Cas was loving this.
Dean hesitated for a moment, but then nodded, “Yeah, I did have a question..” He smiled, “I made reservations for us at a local bistro. It has really good food and some nice music. It’s at 7:00, and I made sure to clear your schedule so you could make it..” He chuckled, “So…wanna go?” He asked.
“Oh yeah…” Dean nodded, “Then why were you scenting me so much?” He asked with a smug look on his face.
“Hey, I’m pretty sure that’s my line.” Dean said and pulled Cas in by the waist,  “Good to see you went with the dress. It looks stunning on you Castiel.” He smiled and kissed him gently. “Ready to head out?” He asked
“How often Cas?” He asked, his scent slowly filling with arousal, which quickly affected Cas.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alfie wait-” He said and sighed, taking the dress, “I don’t...I’ve never worn dresses or feminine clothes like that in public.”
He put his boxers away and held the pair of panties up and turned to Castiel. “Uh, excuse me, Castiel?” He asked.
At this moment he really wished he was wearing his underwear, because he could feel the slick dripping down his thighs, and he was sure other alphas could smell it too. He quickly made his way into his room and locked the door. He practically ripped off his uniform and fell into the bed. His body felt so hot and he was so horny, he had no idea what was going on.
As Dean thought back to Castiel’s aroused scent, he felt his cock twitch in anticipation. He closed his eyes, allowing himself to take a deeper breath of the lingering scent and he let out a pleased growl. He slipped his hand down to his boxers and pushed them down. The cold air of the room encased his cock and reminded him just how hot he actually was. He wrapped his hand around his length and began to pump, though he tried to think about things other than the omega from before. He tried thinking of busty omegas, but that did nothing to help. If anything, he felt that was having the opposite effect. He continued trying by just using the scent, but then he pictured those piercing blue eyes looking up at him while those pretty lips were wrapped around Dean’s cock. He let out a choked moan and moved his hand a little faster. Then he started to wonder how Castiel’s body looked. From the uniform Dean could tell the omega had quite the ass, but he wanted to see more. For now, he imagined the omega on his knees on the bed, his face pressed into the sheets and his ass high in the air, presenting perfectly for Dean. Then, before Dean got much farther than that his knot popped and covered his chest in his load. He moaned out Castiel’s name to himself and panted as he came down from his high. Dean opened his eyes and looked up at the ceiling. Then the guilt washed over him. It wasn’t fair for Dean to use that omega for his own pleasure, especially when the omega made it clear that he didn’t want to explore things with Dean even though his body definitely did.
With that, Castiel fell asleep as Dean lovingly rubbed his arm and rested a hand against Cas’s thigh. Dean was still troubled about the bruises on Cas’s thighs, but he decided not to push. For all Dean knew, Cas had no reason to lie. If he says he fell, then he fell. Dean sighed and took in the sight of Castiel. He smiled to himself, he was the luckiest man in the world.
“Cas? You still there?”
Now, it was early in the morning and Cas was working on covering up his bruises and marks before he went to do his tasks for the day. Then, he heard a knock on the door. He sighed and rolled his eyes, “Who is it?” He called
Other servants were watching now, and Cas had to try and keep his cool. He was still relatively new, and this was much more attention than he had planned on receiving.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “For fucks sake-“ he growled out and grabbed Dean’s face. He slammed his lips against Dean’s and moaned out, smirking as the alpha finally took control and slammed Cas against the wall. The alpha immediately moved to nose at Castiel’s neck and took in his scent, growling, “Omega, mine.”
Cas pressed his lips together and ripped his arm out of her hold when she called him a freak omega. It was common that male omegas were seen as unnatural and “fake,” and it led to lots of discrimination and mistreatment towards them, even though male omegas were just as natural as female ones.
Also! Just a response do a question I got. Yes, Cas is trained from his childhood and he could easily body Lisa if he wanted to, but he doesn't want anymore attention on himself than there already is and if he did that he could face discipline himself. Also, even though the house knows Cas is trained to some extent, if he used his skills he could raise suspicion as to where he actually learned these skills, since he doesn't want anyone to know what he really was a part of. Hope that makes sense!
The omega was hot, and wet in more ways than one. His skin was clearly damp and his hair was stuck to his forehead. His scent was absolutely divine, and Dean had to tighten his grip on the doorknob so he wouldn’t jump the omega right then and there.
“That’s probably it..” Dean mumbled and pulled away, “Well there is something I came here to ask Cas-” he said but became distracted, seeing his black shirt being used as a pillow case, and a toy that he gave Cas on the bed. “Do you use my shirt as a pillow case Cas?” Dean asked with a smug expression on his face.
“I understand.” He replied, “What would you like me to do instead?” He asked.
“That’s because it’s not for the suit, Cas.” Alfie chimed in and pulled out the next item in the box, a nice, long blue velvet dress from Versace. It was a baby blue color, just like Cas’s eyes and it was clearly made to be skin tight. “This is so beautiful Cas!” Alfie smiled, “You should try it on!”
He was sitting on his bed covering up some of his bruises when there was a knock at his door. “Coming!” He called and pulled on his robe. He walked to the door and smiled when he saw Alfie holding a box, and not Lisa or one of her friends. He happily opened the door and let Alfie in.
As he made his way back to his room, some of the other servants were eyeing him, and not in a good way. The main instigator of these looks was an omega female named Lisa. Castiel didn’t know much about her from his short time here, but he knew that Lisa had a huge crush on Dean, but it was never reciprocated.
Castiel noticed there was a small note in the box, but he couldn’t bother to look at it right now. He simply grabbed the toy with one hand and the shirt with the other and got to work.
“You must be insane. Absolutely not.”
“After Alfie dropped off the care pack, he came up to tell me how you were doing and I nearly pounced on him.”
Alfie frowned, “Cas, you’ve really gotta stop listening to Lisa.” He said softly. He pushed the box and clothes aside and took Cas’s hands in his own, “Look, Cas. Whether you’re a male or female omega you’re still an omega, and these clothes are made for all omegas, not just the women. You like the dress don’t you?  Then wear it, show all those sexist assholes what they’re missing out on.” He encouraged.
Dean had a list of ideas, but he assumed Castiel wouldn’t find any of them appealing. “Uh, you can go ahead and make my bed and then just do some dusting. Then you’ll be good to go.” Dean smiled.
When he did, Cas blushed darkly as he saw the alpha. He was in a tux that fit him perfectly, and his hair was meticulously groomed. Cas smiled as he looked over him, “Wow…” He breathed out.
Also I've found that writing helps to distract me from the dumpster fire of 2020, so I think I'm going to try and do a chapter a day, but I can't make any promises.
Dean sighed and climbed off the bed. He cleaned himself off and tossed his boxers in the hamper. He pulled on some sweatpants and a tshirt and then laid in his bed.
“Stop, Cas you didn’t ruin anything.” He promised and kissed his head. “Lets just enjoy our dinner for now, ok?” He asked
Dean walked over to Castiel and gently grabbed his hand, placing the clothing in his hand. The moment he did so, he felt a spark rush through his body and straight down to his groin, but he had to ignore that right now. “It’s ok Castiel, it happens. Go ahead and take the rest of the night off. I’ll see you around.” He smiled.
Not to mention the omega was definitely having a reaction as well. The omega was flustered yet trying his best to stay composed. But when he called him alpha, Dean had to try his hardest to suppress the possessive growl he felt building up in his chest. According to Dean, he was Castiel’s alpha and Castiel was his omega. That was the only solution that made sense.
Cas calmed as he listened to Dean and he nodded. “Yeah..” He sniffled and wiped his eyes, “Okay...that sounds good Dean.” He agreed. “I’m sorry for ruining the mood.”
“If I enjoy it, I will allow you to court me. Deal?”
Cas nodded quickly, “Yes-” he stopped himself before he sounded too needy, “Yes Dean…”
“Look,” He started, “Just because I was out of my room for one night doesn’t mean I was hooking up with your crush. If Dean has spent all these years never touching a single omega servant, what makes you think he would so quickly decide to touch me?” He asked. “I can assure you, your fantasy of being Dean Winchester’s perfect little omega is still completely safe.” He muttered and turned to his door. “Anything else?” He asked.
“You’re not just saying that?” Cas asked as he checked himself out in the mirror.
Castiel, confused as ever, wrote back “None of your business, who is this?” and then the conversation ensued.
Cas’s heart stopped at that suggestion. He knew Dean was just joking, and he probably didn’t mean anything by it, but what if Cas was nesting? Omegas didn’t nest for their alphas, they nested when they were expecting a child. Cas’s hand seemed to instinctively touch his stomach as his nerves heightened. He did have sex with an alpha during his heat, but it was the last day. The end of it! It shouldn’t have been enough to get him pregnant.
Dean had half a mind to let Cas sit there and suffer, tease him for a little longer since Dean might not get this chance again. But then, remembering their deal and with Cas’s current behavior, Dean was pretty sure they would be doing this again.
As he got close to finishing, he was putting away his last couple pairs of boxers when he felt a material much softer than his usual boxers. He turned the pile of boxers over and his eyes widened. Under the boxers was a pair of light blue panties with little embroidered bees all over them. They were adorable, but they definitely weren’t his.
Castiel turned around and then his face seemed to flush instantly. He was stuck in place as he tried to stutter an answer Dean’s unspoken question. The omega then lowered his head and locked his gaze on Dean’s shoes to avoid his eyes. “Those are mine. They became dirty while I was washing your clothes and I didn’t have time to return to get a new pair. My apologies.” He said quickly, and his voice was clearly shaking.
“Well yeah, but I’m the boss Cas, I can bend the rules if I want to.” Dean smiled, snaking his arms around Cas’s waist and kissing him gently. Cas was still confused, but he hadn’t seen Dean in what felt like ages, and the kiss felt good, so he rolled with it.
Dean laughed, “My suit?” he asked and laughed, “I mean, yeah sure. You gonna build your alpha a little nest or something?”
When Dean touched Castiel’s hand, it felt like lightning exploded through his veins. Suddenly, Castiel’s skin was on fire and Dean’s scent seemed to be ten times as strong. His mind was already fogging up, which is why when he heard the fuzzy sentence of “go….take…off..” he made a beeline for his room.
He then heard his phone buzz against the counter. He received a text from an unknown number that read, “How was the heat?”
Dean then carried Cas over to the bed and dropped him down, watching him with lust blown, alpha red eyes. Castiel smiled at the alpha, his own eyes the bright omega gold. Dean slammed his lips against Castiel’s in a feral way and practically ripped the loose clothing off of the omega’s body. He then moved to kiss up and down Castiel’s neck, settling at his scent glands and taking his time to mark it with a large hickey. Cas moaned in response and felt his heart speed up at this. He should’ve made a rule against markings, but he had forgotten to mention it. Even now, he was too high on lust to think about the consequences after this. All he could think about now was how good Dean’s lips felt against the skin of his neck. He knew his scent was probably speaking for him, but if it wasn’t, Cas gasped, “Fuck, yes..”
Either way, he tossed his phone down and writhed against the sheets. He tried everything he could to get himself off but nothing was working.
“With all do respect Castiel, your body was made for that dress.” He smiled.
Cas blushed darkly and hid his face in Dean’s neck, “Shit..” He sighed, “Yeah...it smells nice.” He mumbled in defeat.
Cas rolled his eyes even though a big fat grin was plastered on his face. He would never admit it, but Cas loved being spoiled by Dean.
“When did you smell me in heat?”
Cas nodded and looked over Dean. A deal was a deal and besides, that was some of the best sex Cas had ever had in his entire life. So yeah, if it came down to it he wouldn’t mind being mated to Dean.
Dean smirked as he lined his head up with Cas’s entrance and slowly pressed his length inside of him. He let out a deep, guttural moan. Castiel was still so tight after fucking himself on those toys all week, it really was a miracle.
Cas was already so close to the edge when he felt Dean’s knot begin to tug at the edge of his hole. He knew Dean would finish soon and Cas was already nearly there. Cas hadn’t even been touched yet.
Cas nodded, “Yeah..” He smiled and grabbed Dean’s hand. “And this dress is way too excessive Dean. I saw the price tag and it was nearly $600. You don’t need to be spending that much money on me to impress me.” He mumbled as they walked to the limo.
“I-I don’t know! But I feel like I’ve been gaining weight and now your scent a-and-” He said as he started to hyperventilate.
Cas nodded,  “Yeah..” he mumbled and moved to cuddle up against Dean’s chest. Dean wrapped an arm around Cas and held him tightly as they relaxed against each other.
“Thanks Alfie.” He smiled.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel said simply as he walked into the room. “Where should I put your clothes.” He asked.
Soon Dean set a hard and fast pace. Letting his alpha side take over, he fucked into Cas with primal need, watching how beautifully the omega took his cock.
After about four days, Castiel’s heat was much less aggressive and he was able to focus on most tasks. Not to say Cas didn’t need a knot anymore, but it was more like twice a day now instead of twelve. He woke up sticky and sweaty with his favorite toy on the bed near his breeder. He had decided this one was his favorite because it felt the most realistic and it was the biggest. Castiel would definitely not be giving that one back.
“That is, unless you just want me to bite you right now.” Dean teased. In response, Cas rolled his hips, causing Dean to gasp and shoot another load into the omega. Cas gasped a little and chuckled, “Shit, you’ve got a lot in you.” He panted.
Dean then moved up and kissed Cas again, surprised to hear a whine instead of a moan. “What’s the matter omega?” Dean asked and ran his hand down Cas’s side, “I don’t need to be teased, I need your knot.” Cas growled out. He actually growled. That was the first time Dean had ever heard a omega growl and fuck it turned him on.
He then made his way to the door and opened it for the omega. “Welcome back Cas.” He smiled.
As Castiel left, Dean caught a whiff of the aroused scent flowing off of the omega, and all he could say was it was a good thing the omega left.
Cas whined at the loss but Dean quickly shushed him, “You’re ok omega. I’m almost there.” He smiled. He used some of Cas’s slick to lube up his cock and then realized he had forgotten a condom. He thought about whether or not he should grab one, but the omega was already writhing beneath him, and who was Dean to deny such a pretty thing? Besides, if Cas had been taking the blockers, then he was taking the suppressants and birth control too. That’s what most omegas do.
“I’m not your omega, and no. I’m concerned for my friend.”
Cas smiled and sat up a little, “Well, it would be pretty embarrassing for you if you went through all that trouble just for me to say no,” He smiled, but stopped when he saw the genuine concern on Dean’s face, “Kidding.” He laughed, playfully punching Dean’s shoulder. “Of course I’ll go Dean, you’ve been nothing but amazing during this courting process, so I’d be quite the ass to turn down a proper date.” He smiled.
Dean nodded and chuckled, “Yeah I do, and if you keep pulling stuff like that we’ll be here all night.”
“You are not my mate, you are my boss. A relationship like that would be extremely inappropriate.”
About an hour or so later, Dean heard knocking at his door. That’s when he remembered that the omega was still working. The omega would have to come back into the room and do other things for Dean. Dean tensed and grabbed some scent neutralizing spray. He sprayed a couple spritz in the air, not like it would do much for the omega if they really were true mates.
“Then why don’t you go fill it Cas..” Dean smirked, “Put that toy of yours in and I’ll fuck it in and out of you while you suck my cock. How’s that sound omega?” Dean asked
Dean sped up his thrusts and Cas cried out, coming before Dean’s knot even popped. But that didn’t stop the alpha. Cas’s body tightening around Dean’s cock only encouraged him more, and he went harder into the omega, making Cas moan with each thrust of his hips.
I know in the show Lisa isn't that bad but I never liked her so I'm making her the bitchy mean girl lol.
Cas was becoming a little flushed, and he could feel the slick beginning to build up. If he was honest, he had used that toy at least every other day, but that would be too embarrassing to admit. “E-Every once in a while..” He stuttered, his hips shifting against Dean’s. He blushed more when he felt the new hardness in Dean’s pants, which only made him more turned on.
Dean frowned at that. He figured he understood why Castiel was upset, after all a random alpha was holding a pair of his panties, but he picked up a small hint of fear in the omega’s scent. The idea of scaring his omega broke Dean’s heart.
He had also finally gotten around to looking at the note that Dean had left in the box. The note was clearly in Dean’s handwriting and said: “Sorry for triggering your heat. Guess that’s a side effect of being true mates.”
“Awesome.” Cas agreed, resting his head against Dean’s chest again as he relaxed. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get himself to stop smiling. For the first time in his life, Castiel actually felt loved and cared for, like there was someone he could walk through life with, and that someone was Dean. He had never been happier. He closed his eyes and smiled, taking in Dean’s scent and slowly drifting off. Dean said he didn’t have to do any tasks today, so he figured he could take a nap. Besides, he didn’t want to miss this opportunity to cover his bed in Dean’s scent.
“Like I’m going to die if I don’t get a knot soon.” Cas snapped back and sat down on the bed. He opened the box and let out a cry of relief when he saw everything that was in the box. It was a shit ton of scent blockers, some hormone patches to make his omega think his alpha was there, and a few different toys. “Thank you...tell Meg, I said thank you.” He panted.
It was then that Dean noticed bruises on Cas’s thighs and he frowned, “Cas? What are these from?” He asked, resting his hand over a couple of the bruises.
“Yeah..” Cas mumbled and turned away from the mirror, heading out of his room with Alfie to go up to Dean’s. The other servants were watching Castiel with nothing but jealousy in their eyes. Cas hated being watched like this.
“So, we should do something about this whole true mates thing right?”
“Hey are you feeling ok Cas?” Dean asked softly as he took in Cas’s scent, “You smell different.”
Soon enough, the tow truck showed up. The ride back to the Impala had Dean feeling antsy in the passenger seat. As they passed the field where the cabin now stood in daylight, the eeriness of its lonely presence made Dean clench his jaw. “What do you know about that place?”
The next time Dean awoke, the brightness outside was now a pitch black darkness as soft snow slowly fell in a non-stop showering display. A candle was lit in the small torch the far wall held, giving the room a slight orange glow. The Dragon stretched, and felt his muscles and limbs welcome the pull of his movements.
“Our Cecaelia Sorceress gave us the means to be on land and search for Dean’s mate, but with a few conditions. We had no idea how long it would take to find him, if ever, and we needed a spell that wouldn't run out. So, Rowena, knowledgeable Sorceress that she is, gave us a ‘rechargeable’ spell. These watches tell us when we need to submerge ourselves. We need to do so for a few moments,” Sam tried to explain, as Meg looked at him, a bit impressed.
After his one meeting with Castiel’s mate, the terrifying and grief stricken Cecaelia Alpha, he hadn’t heard anything about him. Not that he had any way to, truly. Cecaelia Territories were frightening, and their outer parameters were frequented by great whites and other aggressive sharks. It wasn’t safe, especially for Omegas,yet he couldn’t stop thinking about Castiel. He wished he could have seen his brother with his mate, seen him truly happy. However, he also wondered how he would have actually reacted if Castiel had confided in him about his secret lover. Gabriel wondered about their eggs, and how the little ones would have looked with mixed species parents. The Omega smiled sadly. He knew Castiel would have made a wonderful mama. His brother had always carried such a fierce love inside of him that was bound to be meant for his offspring. Many Merfolk Alphas had seen that light in Castiel, and many had tried to get his attention, but to no avail. Castiel had never shown so much as an inkling of interest in mating or any kind of romantic intimacy with a Merfolk Alpha. He supposed it was because Mother Sea had plans for Castiel to be with a Cecaelia Alpha instead.
Thank you to everyone leaving comments and kudos! Let me know what you think of this chapter!
Dean watched Castiel for a moment, but as soon as he noticed the skirt of Castiel’s uniform ride up a little and showed what Dean assumed to be Cas’s bare naked ass, he quickly turned around and focused on putting away his clothes.
Cas whined a little and nodded, “Yes, sometimes...when I miss you.” He admitted.
As he was putting on the lingerie and then the dress, Cas couldn’t help but feel a little excited. Looking at himself in the mirror, he loved how he looked in the dress. It was a slim cut off the shoulder dress with long sleeves. It eloquently showed off his delicate frame, emphasizing his waist and his wider hips and thighs. He smiled and clipped the heavy necklace on and then turned to Alfie.
Not more than an hour later, there was a knock at his door. Castiel whined and Alfie’s voice slipped through the door. Cas struggled to get up and wrapped a sheet around himself. When he opened the door, Alfie stepped inside and set a package on Castiel’s bed for him. “How are you feeling?” Alfie asked.
“Ooh nice Castiel!” Alfie cheered, “It’s probably somewhere super expensive.”
That was enough for Dean and he smiled, looking over Cas like a happy puppy, “So this means you’ll let me court you?”
With that, the pair fell asleep in each other's arms. Little did they know this would be one of the last quiet nights they would have for a long time.
“Would that be so bad?” Cas asked and wrapped his arms around Dean.
“Like that omega?” Dean growled out and used his hand to pinch the nipple he wasn’t paying attention to. “Y-yes!” Cas gasped and moaned again. Dean looked up and took a mental picture. Castiel looked so amazing when he was being pleased. If he hadn’t gotten the job here, the omega could’ve been a star of the porn industry.
“Oh I know Cas, I just want to spoil you. You deserve it after all.” He smiled and kissed his cheek.
Because of this, Lisa’s attacks had only gotten more and more violent, and now other servants were sometimes involved in them too. It would be things like tripping him, hitting him, calling him names and such. The worst thing that had happened was when he was just trying to clean the floors, and a different alpha from the gang came up to Cas and asked Cas to fuck him, saying he heard from other omegas that he was willing to fuck for expensive gifts. Of course Cas said no, but events like that started happening more often and it was starting to weigh on Cas. Not to mention he now had visible bruises on his upper arms, torso and thighs from Lisa and her friends’ attacks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh..Cas?” He asked and chuckled, “You going into heat or something?”
The worst part was, Dean had no clue that any of this was happening. Dean was a busy man after all, and he really only had time to drop gifts off to Cas and periodically text him. They hadn’t seen each other since the hook up, and Cas couldn’t help but think that was a good thing. He didn’t want to know what Dean would do if he found out what Lisa had been doing.
They got in the limo and Cas cuddled up to Dean as they drove. Dean was strong and he smelled nice, although now Cas realized he seemed to smell even better, more attractive, even though that was inhumanly possible. He hadn't even realized how aggressively he had been nuzzling into the different scent spots on Dean’s neck and chest until Dean said something.
(See the end of the chapter for
Alfie nodded and turned towards the door, “Have fun Castiel.” He laughed and left.
Cas blushed and snapped out of his little daze, “What? No..” He mumbled and straightened himself out, “My heat isn’t until...well..I don’t know actually. Since you threw me off schedule and then I started the blockers..”
Alfie looked to Cas and his mouth gaped open, “Wow! Like really, wow Cas!” He smiled and stood, “You look amazing!”
Soon enough, Dean's knot finally popped and he moaned Cas’s name as his knot locked into place and shot rope after rope of his come into his omega. Castiel smiled and milked Dean’s knot for all it was worth, coming a second time himself.
When 11:30 came around, Dean was a nervous wreck. He was still partially in his rut and he was sure Cas was still partially in his heat. The idea of coming together and fucking it out was a horrible one, but it was one they both agreed to.
Cas moaned at the suggestion and nodded, quickly heading to the bed. Dean followed him and sat down on the bed, leaning against the wall and quickly pulling out his cock as Cas pulled down his shorts to push the toy inside of himself. Cas couldn’t believe he was doing this, it seemed to lewd and dirty yet it made him feel amazing. Not to mention the idea of tasting Dean’s cock and come was making Cas’s mouth water. He let out a soft moan as the toy entered him, and Dean growled in approval. “Good boy, now get to sucking omega..” Dean smirked. Cas moaned again, deciding he liked that name and shifted closer to Dean’s cock. Within moments, Cas wrapped his lips around Dean’s cock and started to bob his head, taking Dean down as far as he could and then moving up to the tip again. Dean moaned, tangling one hand in Cas’s messy hair as the other began pumping the toy in and out of Cas’s breeder. Cas moaned around Dean’s length and continued sucking. He loved the feeling of being filled from both ends. He felt so dirty admitting that to himself, but it was true.
Meg watched as Sam stood. Dean seemed reluctant to move as the beeping on the watches persisted. “What’s going on?”
Castiel had woken up out of habit, and was surprised to hear the Alpha’s voice through the baby monitor. He found himself smiling at the thought that even though he and Lily hadn’t been able to spend any time with Dean in the last few days because of his duties to the pack, the idea that Dean went to see Lily every night because he wanted to—needed too—filled the Omega with a sense of belonging… It was a significant moment. The Alpha truly saw Lily as his, loved her fiercely, and his instincts as a father were genuine and effortless… Castiel found Dean so endearing and the Omega was feeling needy and bold…Perhaps it was his sleep-hazy mind or the fact that the Alpha was in fact shirtless, his broad powerful freckled tan skin was on display. Or maybe it was Dean’s dominant pine and bergamot scent, smelling of happy sleepy Alpha, that hit his sensitive nose as they stood a mere foot away from each other in the hallway. For whatever reason, Castiel would never regret his actions that followed.
“From the information I have been able to collect from my contacts, the order was carried out by the Elder Zachariah,” Karen informed them, as she glided towards the side perch to settle herself upon it.
Dean could feel Castiel’s hesitance and it made his nose twitch. “Cas, Jody here will run a few tests, nothing invasive, it’s just to make sure all is good.”
Castiel smiled as he lowered himself to kiss his lover. The kiss turned quickly from gentle to passionate and hungry. They deepened the kiss as Castiel started to grind down into Dean’s lap, delighting that Dean was extremely responsive. Castiel loved the scent of him, a natural woodsy spicy smell that enticed him and he needed a taste. Castiel licked a long stripe against Dean’s neck.  Dean hummed and buried his left hand in Castiel’s dark locks. The warmth of his broad shouldered lover’s body, always hot against his usually chilled skin, always seeking out his heat. He kissed and tongued at Dean’s clavicle as his hands trailed over his stomach and side. He loved that freckled tan skin.
. However, most Omegas can handle both, a career and a family. While you obviously couldn’t and now here we are. You are quite lucky indeed that you didn’t want to mate, makes this divorce much easier. Now you can have your career and never have to worry about anyone being home to wait on you. Burden gone.” Bela voiced before she spun on her high heels and left Castiel with an utter feeling of loss and defeat.
“Emma called me, worried about your father. Now, what the hell is this?” Jo growled as she watched Castiel ignore them and place the pup’s tiny feet on the bedside so his little hands could touch Dean.
Minutes later, his pup was hugging his legs once more, bidding him night night. Castiel kissed the top of her head before she ran back to her father who put her to bed.
“Aww, come here, baby” Castiel happily took his son, thankful for the interruption and scent of his and Dean’s pup. He smelled of pine and green tea. It was so soft and pleasant, Castiel nuzzled him right away, gaining a string of giggles and mumbling from him. “Were you good for your big sister?” The dark-haired Omega asked as he smiled at his pup.
“Hey,” Dean replied, and she kissed him softly.
Castiel quickly disrobed and as he hung up his traveling dress and coat upon the hangars by the door, he groaned as he noticed its disheveled plaids and damp edges that showed its seasoned wear. He only owned a handful of dresses that were just close enough in style to appear suitable to be worn around a High Duke and his Lord's sons. He hoped he would be allowed materials to make new ones…or perhaps purchase new ones if his new husband would give him an allowance.
Castiel could only nod as his teeth started to clatter from the cold. The elder Alpha stood aside to let him into the Manor. The foyer was grand with a carpet that saved shuffling feet from the cold wooden floor beneath. A strong hug of warmth wrapped around Castiel’s small form, seeping into his bones, reminding his limbs what heat felt like as the large door closed out the cold behind him. Wordlessly he followed the man deeper into the Manor, his eyes in awe of the high ceilings and the hundreds of candles that lit their way as they arrived towards a beautiful staircase that parted in opposite directions mid landing. He tried to scent discreetly around him but his nose was still much too cold.
Her mate John, grasped her hand in his. “I agree with Mary. Our son deserves to release his rage in the form of punishment to the Alpha that has attempted to destroy his mate and kin,” he growled out.
Castiel rubbed at his face and decided they were right. If Dean didn’t at the very least know that he was trying to better himself to get him back. If he wasn’t able to  show Dean that he was utterly and completely the only Alpha Castiel had and will ever desire in any way. Cas stopped as  doubts and fears warred in the Omega’s thoughts. Castiel thought  of other Omegas and how they reacted to Dean and always had. That was nothing new, but with Dean now single it was significant and it sent chills down Castiel’s back at the possible implications.
Sam started towards the water as Meg followed carefully, while Jo and Rufus stayed on the dry sand.
Asmodeus balked a bit and cleared his throat before he turned to address Dean once more. “I understand you are mated Alpha Winchester, and your daughter is beautiful, I meant no disrespect.”
As he stopped just before the bed, Dean walked out of the bathroom, towel drying his hair from his shower and another towel slung low around his hips. Lust and arousal swirled in the pit of Castiel’s stomach at the sight of his husband’s state of undress. Water drops slid down the Alpha’s broad chest and strong abs. Trailing down to the line of light hairs that drew his eyes to the towel and the warmth hidden below it. When Castiel realized where his gaze had wandered, it left him feeling flushed and aroused.
Castiel sighed. The water had started to cool considerably, making him rush to wash his hair as well as the rest of himself quickly. He needed to be presentable. He wasn’t sure exactly how to make himself attractive but he would try to do anything to make sure Lord Dean readily agreed to the marriage and mating. Castiel wondered if perhaps the Duke had already ‘ordered’ his son to wed him? He growled in frustration and annoyance as a headache started to work at his temples.
Jo bit her lip in frustration. “It doesn’t matter.”
“I think I had a lover…before,” Jimmy managed, after some time. The tea was soothing, with the perfect drop of rich honey that added wonderful flavor to the peach and ginger black tea.
The Alpha turned back towards her as he rubbed at his face in frustration. “The worst part is you didn’t bother telling me! I had to find out from others, Bel.”
Inside was an impressive collar. It was a beautiful dark green sheepskin, with an intricately detailed Winchester family crest embroidered in rich black and grey thread. Dean couldn’t stop himself from reaching in to touch the soft collar.
Silent tears fell down the Omega’s cheeks as the words on the papers blurred together. Castiel had never felt so lost. Had never felt so angry with himself only to have self pity and depression grip him so tightly they outweighed anything else and used up all of his energy leaving him feeling and acting like a zombie. He couldn’t sleep, he could barely function let alone take care of himself. He was thankful that his sister had been staying with him all of this time to take care of him but he felt nothing but despair . He somehow managed to go to work, putting his own needs and pain behind him to treat others, fulfilling some misplaced need to help when he couldn’t seem to help himself.
Three senescences had been stolen from him, time that he would never get back. Despite his friends on land and everything they had done for him, how they had protected him and looked after him, Castiel belonged and longed to be right where he was now, in Dean’s arms. It terrified him to know that he had been cursed to forget his lover, to forget what they had and who he was. He felt a desperate need to assuage that fear.
Dean turned to Castiel, his features turned soft once more as he looked at him. “Which side?” he asked gently, and Castiel tilted his head to give Dean the left side of his neck, displaying his mating glad that still held Adam’s fading bite. Dean moved forward, refusing to let himself think too much about the fact that his bite was now about to overlap if not completely cover the one his little brother had once left, and bit the Omega, claiming him.
Castiel stirred and slowly opened his eyes. He was extremely comfortable, the strong scent of pine and bergamot surrounding him and the feeling of ‘safety’ sank into his bones, and he smiled in his sleep hazed glee. Slowly he carefully sat up as the reason for being awake at three in the morning hit him. He caressed his swollen stomach, the cravings for food becoming stronger the more his senses fully awakened.
He blew the dust from the cover and coughed as it flew up into a cloud. Dean quickly noticed what seemed to be dried blood splattered over its cover. He glanced back around the room at the multiple sigils and symbols, and looked back at the journal and wondered if the blood had come from the same source. At least it wasn’t fresh blood. This kinda looked like paint and it made it a bit easier for the carpenter to pretend it was so, and he opened the journal.
Pamela hummed and moved closer to him to keep their conversation from disrupting the others. “It is, but it’s caused some confusion in the pack at times. I’m sure you’ve heard of Sam.” Castiel nodded at the mention of Adam and Dean’s other brother. “Sam and Dean are extremely close as well and when Dean became Head Alpha, many in the Pack had expected Dean to make Sam his second.”
Bela sat at her vanity, unable to take her eyes off the dark green collar around her neck. A part of her was completely ecstatic… She wanted this, waited for this for so long… and yet a mix of anger and devastation came from the five minutes it took for Dean to clasp the collars around her neck… and Castiel’s. Castiel had been first… Bela wiped her tears violently, irritated with herself and the wild swirl of emotions that plagued her for the last forty-eight hours, since her world tilted and she no longer had a grip on how to feel… how to act. She felt out of control and wanted to scream because everything was wrong… Today was supposed to be her first day as Mrs. Dean Winchester. She should be happy, elated, and showing off a mating bite that this very collar was meant to uphold and accompany… It somehow felt like an empty promise instead of the life commitment it was to embody.
Time stood still as the blossoms of the tree swayed in the winds. As the only person he had ever loved bought produce, he noticed fondly that his hair stayed purportedly messy as ever. He looked healthy, his skin tanned, he seemed fit and strong.
was apparently damn obvious about his attraction to Dean, but the Alpha still felt out of reach, and the fear of being rejected or upsetting Dean stopped him from making a move.
There was also another member of the pack that was crucial to Dean, and that was Crowley, the pack lawyer. He had no idea how this seemingly easygoing businessman was full of artful tactics for bending all deals and laws in Dean’s favor. Because of Crowley, the Winchester Pack bloomed and was quite well-off, and all of it on the legal spectrum which Dean held onto very tightly. With both Benny and Crowley’s cunning counsel in other packs’ ways and all laws as well as the more underhanded way to go about things, Dean was ready for anything.
Those expressive jade green eyes studied him, filled with adoration and remnants of lust. “I um, I know I’m not the best at talking about my emotions, but I try to show you.”
The girls looked at each other knowingly. Pam winked at him and Charlie beamed.
There had been something so… powerful about that night, that had struck Castiel breathless. Even afterward, when Dean had walked him to his room, barefoot and only in jeans, he had looked tired yet content… Dean had mentioned before that Castiel’s scent as a pregnant Omega was extremely soothing to him, and although it had made Castiel blush, he had seen the effect it had on the Alpha.
“Wow, you’re home before midnight. Forgot what that's like” The sound of his husband's angered voice made him look up to find the man he loved for the last seven years. Dean Winchester was an Alpha that loved and protected fiercely. He was everything Castiel had ever hoped for in a partner; encouraging, fun and thoughtful. He had never used his Alpha status  against Castiel and had instead used it in ways that were always helpful to him and any other Omegas in their tight knit group of family and friends. Dean had also never forced him to mate despite having shown interest in doing so. He had never pushed. Castiel had fallen hard for the dashing man, expressive emerald green eyes with a powerful build and a movie star smile. Today was their seventh wedding anniversary and Castiel Novak-Winchester had completely forgotten.
“Are you trying to get killed or to ruin the alliance?” Charlie growled out.
Castiel woke with a start and sat straight up in his bed. His heart was pounding and a light sweat covered his whole body as the remnants of his erotic dream still clung to his consciousness.
“Meg!”
“Now then, with our Head Alpha having claimed his first Omega and the delicate circumstances of our particular situation, there are still rules and traditions, and I believe to prevent discord and pointless squabble within the pack, or at the very least to minimize it, I—”
Day 40: Lost five chickens…all butchered and left scattered across the coop’s yard.
Castiel looked away and toyed with the hem of his shirt as he continued. “An Omega and an Alpha can’t be friends… The Styne Pack firmly believes that if an Alpha shows any interest in an Omega, even something as trivial as speaking—especially laughing or sharing any emotions that could be perceived as intimate—they must be courting, and a mating and wedding would soon follow… Otherwise, the Omega will be viewed as a whore, trying to tarnish the good Alpha’s reputation.”
The Alpha turned onto his back and looked up. The grey light of the sad day outside felt fitting as the rain drops reflected on the white ceiling. He was alone in the room and for that he was thankful. Tears sprung to his eyes as he thought of Adam, of the last time they had chatted and how happy his little brother had been. The youngest of the Winchester brothers was always a quiet and thoughtful Alpha, he was warm and could make friends with anyone. How his life of travelling and helping others had brought him Castiel… Dean wasn’t sure what kind of marriage they had, but Adam had seemed content and had always spoken positively of his mate.
After what felt like hours, he finally regained control of his faculties and started down the hall after his Alpha only to find the bedroom door closed. Tears swam in his eyes as he placed his hand against the door. Dean didn’t want him in the room. The Omega slowly turned towards the guest bedroom down the hall and as he passed his daughter’s room, he saw she wasn’t there.
Meg nodded. Apparently the bigger Cecaelia was the more cordial one. “He washed up on the beach. He had nothing with him, no way to identify him, and he was covered in wounds. When he woke up, he had no idea who he was or where he was.”
“Mom, Dad’s in the hospital. He had a stroke.” Emma sounded completely shaken, and it was quite clear she had been crying. “Claire said he’s gonna be okay but he hasn't woken up yet… Mom…” The thirty-two-year-old had always been the more gentle and sensitive of their two girls. Claire was only older by two years, yet was very much a more stoic person, a strong Alpha trait that clashed with Emma’s softer Omega nature.
“How would Cecaelia know Rufus? He’s human,” she supplied, which made Rufus’ eyebrows shoot into his hairline.
“Everyone is ready,” Benny announced gently as he came through the back door.
Meg had no idea how to even start, when she saw both Jo and Rufus looking behind her with wide eyes. She spun around and found Sam coming out of the water. His massive dark copper- colored tentacles seemed to roll as he moved, and as he exited the water, the tentacles seemed to suddenly fuse together and within seconds, he had human legs. The trio turned their gaze away as the tall man slipped on jeans.
“I never thought you would. I’m just… surprised I guess,” Dean explained. He had known that Castiel was shy and reserved about his relationship with Adam. But he hadn’t realized there was no whirlwind romance, that his baby brother had married and loved his best friend. Dean bit the inside of his cheek, and he supposed this made things easier for him with what he wanted to ask Castiel now.
“Yeah—” Dean’s reply was interrupted as his two most loyal pack members stopped in front of his open bedroom door. Dean could feel Bela’s irritation at the interruption.
His pup’s gender? Castiel looked over to her, his eyes wide, his emotions a ball in his throat making him unable to form the words, and nodded.
“Okay,” Castiel retrieved his hand and looked around Dean to watch people leave. He saw Bela walk away while speaking with Crowley and Sam before he turned his gaze back to Dean and embarrassingly yawned. “I’m sorry!”
Castiel smiled at the large pink pearl in his grasp. Somehow, it had survived the ransacking of their nest, and Dean had found it. He nuzzled the pearl and then kissed his Alpha.
Gabriel was tending to his duties. He tried desperately to act as if nothing was wrong as he went through the motions of his daily routine. His mind was constantly on his baby brother, Castiel. He knew he had survived, his fast acting and a friend’s assistance had made sure that he had. However, beyond that, he had no idea where Castiel was and if he was all right, or if his mate had found him.
Dean had no idea how long and how far he had been running. He couldn’t feel his feet, his legs felt like lead, and he could still feel his pants clinging to him, soaked from rain and sweat. His lungs burned from exhaustion, and his whole body was on the verge of collapsing as he continued to push himself, stumbling through the forest. His vision blurred. He was starved and parched, but he hadn't dared stop, had pushed and pushed and pushed needing to get away. Freedom or death were his only options in regards to Abaddon.
The corner of Dean’s mouth twitched as he remembered the first few weeks of Castiel’s new found life as a human. Dean had taught him everything from brushing his teeth to tying his shoes. Cas’s few fumbles and frustrations with his human body’s limitations like needing to use the bathroom on a regular basis had been the former angel’s biggest grievances and had caused quite a few hilarious incidents at his expense. Dean hadn’t been able to keep his laughter at bay until Cas himself had started to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all and damn… Cas’s smile and laughter had been a new high for Dean.
Dean rushed towards Castiel, gaining everyone’s attention.
“I’m Castiel. We found you, and have been tending to you. You’ve been healing quite well, and now, since you are awake, you’ll be able to eat to gain your strength back,” the Omega that smelled like heaven informed him, and all Dean could do was nod numbly. “I will have Benny, our blacksmith, come look at those shackles to remove them,” Castiel added.
He made his way down the remaining stairs, only to jolt himself as he stepped on a particularly loud groaning step and closed his eyes to rein in his thundering heart for the silly scare. After a beat he continued down the last few steps and he found himself looking around the grand foyer. Everything was grand and crafted with measured skilled hands, impressive even in the darkness of the late evening with the candles lit giving small warm glows.
Dean’s emerald green eyes seemed to suddenly swirl with flecks of gold as he looked at him intently and Castiel gasped. He knew, he knew what he had seen, but he needed Dean to say it, tell him. Adam had told him, had never shown him, he’d been unable to after decades of not letting himself, hiding it, but now… that Dire Wolf… that blond and white massive wolf…
The male Omega licked his lips nervously. Was he that obvious? This was embarrassing and he had to get himself under control. He didn’t want to change the happy and safe life he had now, he didn’t want to risk being at odds with his Alpha because of a… a crush… He couldn’t risk Lily’s home. “I—” The words struggled to even leave his throat, when a knock sounded at the bedroom door and Dean poked his head in.
Its bark was pale and its leaves a blood red, yet its beauty and energy hit him like a wave. Dean closed his eyes and inhaled deeply as the scent of tranquility and life coursed through him. He hadn’t even touched the tree, and yet it was reaching out to him, healing him still as it filled him with a breath of fresh air, and he smiled.
“Then get them back!”
Castiel sat back up. The bed was extremely comfortable. His own bed at home had been almost as hard as the wooden floor… yet this… this was plush and soft… if he had been more of a clear mind he was sure sleep would be quite relaxing. He rubbed at his tired eyes and wiped any remains of tears that lingered. Perhaps a glass of water or warm milk if he was lucky enough would help him fall asleep.
Dean huffed a laugh. “Yeah well, I didn’t want to assume, and I don't want you to think or feel like you’re obligated. Adam will always be her father. We’ll make sure she knows all about him.”
Castiel contemplated knocking again as a light snow started to fall when the door was suddenly yanked open; startling him. A gruff older Alpha looked at him with disdain and an unimpressed gaze.
Gabriel wasn’t sure what was going on, but whatever it was, it was
Dean looked up at them, his nose twitched as Sam’s Alpha scent of pine and blackberries mixed with Bela’s Omega lavender and walnut, swirling around him. He finally stood, knowing that the part of him that just wanted to wallow and cry would have to wait because he had a responsibility now, not only as Head Alpha of the Winchester Pack, but as Adam’s family Alpha.
“I didn’t call Winchester!” Michael defended himself, as he tried to shield Castiel behind him.
In the last few weeks his flashbacks had evolved. Now they came with fierce sensations that left him reeling and desperate to understand. and  He remembered smells and tastes, feelings and emotions bombarding him like a dam threatening  to break. Since the intimate memory with ‘Dean’, he had been plagued with new flashbacks and other recollections.  He hadn’t told Meg. He knew she was worried, but she couldn’t help him any more than she already had. His ‘condition’ had kept her at his side too often when she had other obligations, like her own wife. Jo was always nice and friendly, yet Meg had mentioned their arguments and he understood. He didn’t want to be at odds with Jo, he liked her. Meg was wild about her, and they were sickeningly adorable together.
“I just wanted you to have the vacation you want. The one you deserve,” Dean added as his hands squeezed at Castiel’s hips.
“No… well, dad tried but she wouldn’t take his calls, and she had been so upset when Emma and I told her about the wedding that we didn’t want to upset her more..” Claire stated as she rubbed one of her arms in a nervous gesture.
“Yes but Cas, your actions… look at where they have led you?”
A part of him wondered what his sisters would say if they knew he had already failed once without so much as a look. Anna was only a year older than him and yet, the two barely had a friendship. They were accustomed to sharing their belongings with their simple means, yet Anna was never satisfied with any of it and somehow, she always blamed Castiel. Their older sister Rachel was always solem and cold, Castiel had only ever heard her speak a handful of times…their Alpha father had made an example out of her by physical disciplinary actions that had forever terrorized Castiel. His father had always been a man with two faces… the one he showed the civilized society of their small city and the one his family feared with a crippling dread. Somehow their mother did counter him and sassed him even when she too would be struck into silence, she always found a way to fight back.
“Yeah Cas, but only if you are okay with that. You would come with us back to my territories and be a Winchester Pack member. You would stay with me and be able to live freely and raise the pup safely and surrounded by family. Adam’s family, my family, we will take you in.” Dean was suddenly hit with a wonderful scent of happy sandalwood and jasmine. Castiel smiled and nodded eagerly.
“I have a few things to take care of, but I should be home for dinner. You wanted to start trying potatoes for Lily right?” Dean asked, and Castiel froze as he turned to look at him. The Alpha was fully facing him, tall, broad-shouldered, with a dazzling smile and the dip of his hips that disappeared into his low jeans… Castiel swallowed and felt himself flush. Dean frowned at him and concern took over his features. “Cas you okay?” Dean asked as he placed his hand on Castiel’s forehead, and the Omega forced himself to keep his mouth shut before he embarrassed himself. “You feel a bit warm and your cheeks are red. I think you should go lay down, I’ll make you some soup. I got Lily, just go relax, you might have a fever.” The Alpha instructed and Castiel dutifully nodded, too dazed to argue. “Charlie, can you make sure he’s comfortable?”
As they sank into the bed, the urgency diminished and was replaced by a leisurely warmth between them as Castiel’s pajama top was slowly unbuttoned. Dean smiled into their kiss and started to nip and kiss at the Omega’s jaw, slowly making his way down his neck and spending extra time against Castiel’s mating gland, which made him whimper beneath the Alpha. Hands explored each other and Castiel hummed happily once he was rid of his top, and he eagerly touched and caressed the Alpha’s toned chest. He felt bold as Dean groaned, and listening to his instincts he started to pepper the Alpha’s chest with kisses. Dean pulled him back swiftly, kissing him deeply as he ravaged Castiel’s mouth in a maddeningly slow and torturous dance.
“I um, I actually wanted to talk to you about something,” Dean whispered. Castiel took a seat on one of the stools around the island and waited for the Alpha to go on.  “Would you consider letting me officially adopt Lily as my own?”
he claimed Bela, no one would have batted an eyelash.
“Goodnight.”
“Wha—” Dean wanted to argue and yet, he could indeed feel something… feel Castiel across their new bond. The male Omega was… content, and despite his present situation with Bela right in front of him, his wolf felt a wave of pride at having his Omega, Castiel, happy in this very moment. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat. He had no idea how to fix any of this.
“I’ll let you sleep. I won’t be far if you need anything,” Charlie told him, sadness plaguing her smile, and Castiel was thankful for her genuine kindness towards him.
Renewed pain filled Dean’s heart as he missed his deceased brother. Adam would have never wanted this for his child, or Castiel, Dean was certain of it.
Today was a Thursday with a steady flow of patients and as Castiel spoke briefly with Jody and another colleague named Kevin, he heard two familiar voices that he wasn’t quite prepared to hear.
Cain barked a laugh. “Now, you know you are always welcome. The boys love you,” he said as he turned towards the barn and let out a piercing whistle Castiel was envious of. Within minutes, the stunning trio came out of the barn towards them. It didn't matter how many times Castiel visited them, they always took his breath away. They had this way of making him feel calm and loved, somehow washing away all his worries. He smiled as Hercules reached him first, gently nuzzling into his left cheek.
Castiel tentatively touched the healing bite mark on his neck. Just hours ago, Castiel was about to mourn not only his mate but their pup too, and that would’ve been only if he survived the surgery. Too many times he had witnessed other Omegas somehow find themselves in his situation, only to never return after the surgery. Dean Winchester, now his Alpha, had saved him like a dashing hero from adventurous stories of damsels in distress. Castiel blushed despite himself. It was clear that Dean saw him and his pup as family, and Castiel had known just how important that was to him from everything Adam had told him about Dean. Cas was grateful, and he would make sure to be a good Omega to him.
“Hmm, definitely a Winchester if she’s this hungry right away,” Castiel joked and Dean let out a full-bodied laugh. Castiel found himself humming in happiness as their scents all mingled together in the small room, even with the scent neutralizer working overtime.
“Hmm. I thought you would.” Dean agreed, as Castiel rose to lean against his left elbow and looked down at his lover.
“I’m glad you like it. It’s the only thing I can cook properly.” The Healer laughed at his own shortcomings, and Dean smiled as he licked his lips, removing the last bits of the hearty meal.
Dean could shift into his wolf form, and Sam and Adam could too. However, because of the fear and unease at such displays, Sam and Adam had always refrained. Hell, Dean wasn’t even sure if Sam still knew how, and Adam had stopped shifting altogether when he was just ten years old… But Dean took pride in this gift and he regularly shifted. Of course he was mindful to do so away from pack members, using the surrounding forest and woods as the perfect cover.
Castiel snuggled back down against Dean, buried his nose against the curve of his partner’s neck and sighed happily. This was everything he had ever dreamed of, as cliché as it sounded, he smiled and kissed Dean where his lips landed. Since he had been a young and awkward teenager that had been struggling to figure out his sexuality, he had always known one thing that he would forever desire, to be with a good man that loved him and valued him.
“Meg,” he rasped out, his throat dry. Meg had been his best friend since he had woken on the beach those years ago.
Dean felt his brother before he saw him. Sam was next to him in the blink of an eye. “Grab Michael,” Dean growled out, and then he was running at top speed with Castiel in his arms. He didn’t have to look back to know that Sam had Michael, and was just behind him as they bolted. Dean roared into the forest, sending out a clear message to his pack to fall back and get to pack territories
Jo looked at her with shocked, wide  eyes as she tried to comprehend what in the hell she had just witnessed.
Dean felt Cas’ need for him, and moved so quickly that Charlie barely had a moment to react. Dean stepped out of the house and onto the porch, moving to stand tall and dominant in front of Castiel, sheltering him and the pup. Castiel smirked at the murderous look on his Alpha’s face. He couldn’t stop himself from enjoying that power. He would feel guilty about bothering Dean later, in the privacy of his bedroom.
“What about his mate?” Sam asked carefully as he tried to clear his throat.
“So, Nazarovo?” Benny asked, securing his small bag as they stepped down from the private plane that the pack owned.
“Bela was supposed to be our Head Omega! What the hell is happening!?”
It was barely 6:30pm and she was going to sleep… He wasn’t going to argue, whatever ‘this’ was between them now was a vexing failure that he  wholeheartedly wished wouldn’t turn into resentment…
“What would you like to know? He was your brother,” Castiel teased softly, and it was Dean’s turn to smile.
“Everyone here knows you are Dean’s. No one would dare act against him even if they weren’t accepting,” the Omega Cecaelia voiced with a smirk.
Castiel flinched at the tone his lover had used. He knew Dean was going to be mad and he understood him, he did. But he had simply been lost in his work...
“Don’t forget to--” Sam tried to remind him, but Dean waved him off as he walked into the water in his ‘underwear’. Again, a pointless human garment.
“Alright then, why don’t you come in next Monday and we’ll get you situated” She stated and smiled at him.
“Um..” It took a moment for Dean to bring himself back to the present, his mind still going through the terror of a few hours ago. “A fishing trip with my brother.”
The blue Omega Merman swam forward slowly, yet kept his distance. “You are the monsters. You slaughtered my offspring. Your lives for theirs is only right. You tried to keep me from my mate. You are the monsters,” Castiel stated, as he looked over his kin, who were all watching him in confusion. “Naomi and Hester are the ones left,” he added.
“Wonderful, I will file this precious gem right away.” Crowley collected the documents and quickly tucked them away in his briefcase. He shook Dean’s hand on his way out.
As much as he wanted to hurry and rush, he wanted to be at his best in case of any dangers, and he wanted to look his best for his Omega to charm him back into his fold.
“Yes. She’s such a good pup,” Castiel hummed as he took out a pre-made fruit salad.
“Jimmy! You’re burning up! Let’s go.” Meg pulled at him to exit the shop. Mating season was still three weeks away, and she hadn’t even started to feel the symptoms, while Jimmy seemed to be going through them full-force as a mated Omega. It was a fierce, early heat, but she couldn’t understand what was causing it.
Castiel only nodded as he continued to caress his stomach. “May I?” Dean’s question made the Omega look up at him with shocked and scared blue eyes, which quickly filled with tears and turned heartbreakingly sad. Castiel could see Dean didn’t pose a threat and gave a small nod as he leaned back slowly and revealed more of his swollen form. Dean carefully placed his large hand over the prominent, warm pup bump.
Castiel turned to find a wardrobe. Gently he traced his finger tips over the polished oak wood, appreciating its craftsmanship as his mind wondered. Just days ago, his life had been completely altered and a part of him was terrified. Castiel’s family didn’t come from much and yet his parents insisted on pretending to belong in the high society of the privileged and elite. That desperation had led them to make foolish decisions that now had brought Castiel to here.
“Get to the point,” Dean interrupted as he watched both Omegas eyeing the prestigious collar on the counter.
“Cas!” Dean called out, and took off in a run towards him. Those blue eyes went wide in shock as Dean reached him.
Castiel frowned. “Hosting?”
“Fuck…”
Dean’s felt a rush of adrenaline; he was ready to ravish the Omega. Cas was already responding quite clearly to their mutual arousal, if the obscene tent in his sleep pants was anything to go by. But this wasn’t normal… This was heightened, and the sheer desire was starting to reach a boiling point as he felt his heart beating against his rib-cage.
“My Lord, this note came for you!” A young boy came running towards Castiel.
“So, you have quite the resume, may I ask what brings you here besides Balthazar’s suggestion?”
Sam’s eyebrows shot into his hairline. “Sorry I missed that.”
Bela’s eyes fluttered as his words hit her. Dean had taken that one task quite seriously… Yet she hadn’t realized he had asked Castiel, or anyone for that matter, for help in choosing the right flowers for her… “W-why did he ask you?” She couldn’t help asking. She had never met or spoken to him and Dean hadn’t said much more than his name and that he was Adam’s mate, yet now she found out they had spoken before? And from the sound of it, they had on multiple occasions. Jealousy curled in her stomach. She felt ridiculous, no other Omega had ever made her feel such a horrid emotion before, and Dean knew and dealt with many Omegas. Even other Omegas who had openly tried to flirt or turn Dean’s attention from her had never made her feel this sinking feeling before.
The Mermaid hesitated and looked over at Dean. The Cecaelia brought him flush against him and kissed him before releasing him, silently nudging him towards Rowena.
The Cecaelia Sorceress was not someone to trifle with, clearly, and Castiel was ever more thankful that this frightening, yet undeniably kind race had welcomed him because one of their own had fallen in love with him.
“Head Alpha Winchester, I’d very much like to hold a meet between our packs. Perhaps you have select houses that would be amenable to hosting some of my available Omegas—only our most precious and stunning, I assure you—and some of my strongest Alphas. Perhaps, if you would be so gracious, you could host myself and my six children: all of age, three beautiful Omegas and three strong Alphas.” Head Alpha Asmodeus Masters proposed while Dean jiggled Lily on his knee, the pup watching people with wonder.
A breath of silence covered the room and then suddenly Dean was… well, he was laughing hysterically.
Castiel blushed. “Thank you. It's an honor to meet you.” It was quite clear that Rowena was the Cecaelia Sorceress. The energy around her was charged.
“So this is your room. You have your own bathroom as well, so you don’t have to leave your room if you aren’t feeling up to it,” Charlie informed him as she led him into his new home.
“I’m good, enjoying the nice night. Mind if I sit?”
Dean? Did that mean he had a lover before he washed ashore? Who was he? What did they have? Was he the one with the green eyes? The smile? The flashback had supplied him with minimal visuals, yet those lips...he was sure those were the ones he had turned to kiss, and that those were the ones mouthing his shoulder and neck. Where was ‘Dean’? Was he looking for him?
Dean brought him deeper into the enclave. The colony of the Cecaelia only seemed to grow deeper and much more secure. Anyone trying to invade, or a predator, would never be able to survive. Dean lured him into a cove, where the center opened into a massive gathering stoned berth. There were five Cecaelia awaiting them, stationed upon the higher positioned sitting stones.
“It’s only been a few weeks—”
Fear started to grip him, and the male Omega’s hand instinctively went to his stomach while he tried to figure out what the hell had just happened. Was something wrong with his daughter? “I think something might be wrong with the baby,” he whispered as his heart began to race and his wolf mewled in worry.
Castiel hugged her tightly. “I will visit you, I promise.”
“Just two nights. I’ve never seen anyone, or anything, heal at such a rapid pace, blood magic or not,” Castiel stated.
“Leaving early?” Meg leaned against the frame of his office door and he rushed to put his things away.
“I honestly don’t know. All the caller said was that there was a car accident and they were sorry that Adam didn’t make it. Their English was a bit broken…” Dean stated as he untangled himself from Bela and started to pace, grabbing his cell phone and starting to tap at it.
“I’m not imagining things, right?” Sam looked at Benny, who gave him a knowing grin and a slight nod. Sam sighed and pressed his lips together. “Okay then,” was all he could say, determined to let things happen as they would.
“What the fuck do you mean gathering?” Dean asked Benny and then turned to Bela, brow furrowed. “Condone what?”
“Da!” Lily was suddenly feeling fussy, and Castiel’s eyes widened as he quickly handed her to Dean
Castiel was dizzy with pleasure, and he wanted—needed—more. With fumbling hands he grabbed at the Alpha’s shoulders and neck. Dean’s lips against his neck, teasing that area by his left ear, made him whine and that’s when the Alpha started to carefully slide into him. Castiel gasped and threw his head back into the sheets as he felt Dean move inch by inch, stretching him wide. Dean was thick and long and he had never felt so incredibly full.
“Cas,” Dean voiced carefully, as his lover held on to the Alpha’s tentacles tightly, and then Castiel turned to look at him with impossibly wide blue eyes.
He loved this man, wholly and fiercely. He couldn’t imagine his life without him, without his love. The bomb that was Dean Winchester was powerful and addicting. He was a large and dominant fixture in his life and that of anyone that loved him. Like a sun that beamed and you couldn’t help but need and seek out that warmed that came from just being in Dean’s orbit.
The Alpha kept his eyes closed tight as his heart calmed. The careful hand on his left shoulder and chest felt soothing when he would have expected them to be constricting. The fact that he felt pillows and a downy mattress beneath him, if it wasn’t from the physical pain and the restraining cuffs still around his wrists and his throat, he would have thought the Goddess had finally come for him.
“Balthazar… is this?” Castiel eyed the stunning ring in his hand. Carefully the older Omega took it from his hand and smiled at it gently before hiding it once more under his shirt.
“What if he never lets me see Ellie again?” Castiel could barely see his sister through his panicked tears.
“It’s the official police report and the mugshot of that lad that has clearly seen better days, who has been charged with Adam’s murder. He was quite drunk and crashed right into Adam’s vehicle,” Crowley explained quietly.
“Yes, Alpha.” Castiel was fatigued but managed a soft smile in reply, the possessive gesture making him relax within seconds. He knew Dean was looking out for him and he trusted the man wouldn’t put him in any danger. The idea of a warm bath and then a full night’s sleep made Castiel want to hurry through whatever check-ups Dean’s wanted.
When Dean enters the room he sees 15 maybe 20 people in the room. He looks around a little to see where he's going to sit, then he sees a small/tall men sitting alone looking at his phone. He has dark hair, Dean thinks it's black but isn't sure. Then he look up,
"I'm going to check on Cas. You make a list of things that you need from the store an don't forget the pie.'
Castiel saw them coming at him but he ignored it hoping they would leave him alone. "Hey fag what are you reading?" Alastair asked with a tone Castiel knew was fake. And before he n-knew it he got a fist in his face. The whole room started looking at them. "I asked you a question fag. I think the little fag is deaf or he lost his voice. What do you think?" And another fist collided with his face. Now he could taste blood in his mouth. He looked at them with a little bit of fear in his eyes. "Look the little fag is scared of us, that's what we want to see. We like that fear, like a lot."
It's the first day of college for Castiel and his friends. They all had a nice summer and they spended time with their family.
The walk to college was short because Castiel lived a few minutes away. Gabriel was also having a class now so they are going to meet at their spot. "Hey Cassie, where's Dean, didn't he had a class?" Gabriel asked while he took his backpack and walked with Castiel to the building. "Yes but he's going to be late. He sliced his finger while making a sandwich. He's getting 2 stiches now and will come in later." Castiel said. "Oh, well he better be in time because they are going to tell us what is important for our exam's. I know you will tell him what to know but it 's always better that you take notes for yourself. Let's go now because otherwise we're going to be late as well. I see you after class, bye Cassie." Gabe waved before he left to walk away. "Bye Gabe." Castiel doesn't know if he heard that. So he just went to class.
Dean was not humming to the music this time and he saw Cas looking at him. "What, is their something wrong?" Dean was getting nervous, "Yes, you're not singing to the music this time, is it the same thing as in the store? You know you can talk to me." Cas sounded concerned, "No, I'm waiting for my favorite song to come on." Dean lied, shortly after they where at his parking spot.
When Castiel saw the message he called Dean. "Hey Cas" "Hello Dean." They always started there conversations like that. "Where are you Cas, are you okay?" Dean sounded concerned. "I'm walking back home, I went to grab breakfast for us, I didn't know what you would like to eat so I just ordered everything." Dean laughed, "Cas you didn't had to order everything, bacon is good for me." Castiel didn't know that. "Sorry I didn't know thatn well we have food enough for the whole day I guess. Are you outside Dean?" "Yes, I thought you maybe went on a walk and if I went on a walk we would meet somewhere. But I'm walking back now, because I know where you are." Castiel laughed a little bit. "Why where you looking for me? Are you afraid I would just leave you alone at my place?" Castiel asked it with a sarcastic tone. "No, maybe, I was just worried that you where going to do something stupid. I only have on problem, I don't have a key to your place so I need to wait for you outside." "You're stupid, I'm in the street of the building, I will be there in 1 minute." "Okay, I will be waiting here for you."
"Well I know which one I'm going to tell. It's a lovely one, later I call tell a funny one. Castiel was around 5 years old. We went to the sea, I think that you already know that the sea is his favorite place, right Dean." Dean nodded while laughing at Castiel. "So we were walking down the beach together and it was becoming dark. We sat down in the sand and watched the sun go down. Cassie was sitting at my lap. At one moment he asked me why we couldn't see Mommy while she was dead. I told him that we could see her.
When Cas was in his room he took of his clothes and changed in his pajamas but didn't put the shirt on just jet. He took some bandage and cleaned the stabbing wound. It didn't look to bas so he just cleaned it and put bandage on and left it with that. He putted and his shirt and went to bed.
"You noticed something off about Cas today? He didn't finished his coffee, barely touched his food. It looks like something is off. And let's not forget, he was dead to the world when he was asleep, normally he would wake up with a single knock."
While Castiel was walking back to his apartment he got a text from Dean.
Dean didn't wanted to take a shower so he just putted his pajamas on. When he was done in the bathroom he had a text from Cas.
When he didn't got an answer he looked at Sam and he saw he was worried too. When he looked back at Cas he saw Cas was falling to the floor.
When Dean was making the eggs and bacon Castiel was looking at him. "Do you guys always eat this good in the mornings because we don't." Dean laughed, "No only on holidays and sometimes when we have summer break or something, otherwise it's just bread." Castiel nodded. "I had to wish you a merry Christmas from Gabe, he texted me yesterday." Dean turned around and smiled. "Say a thank you from me to him."
Dean is driving to the party with Cas next to him. Cas looks so damn cute with those cat ears. Dean is like always humming to the music. Cas is just nodding his head to the beat of the music. "Are you exited for the party Cas?" Dean asked when they were waiting at a red light. "Not really, I'm not the kind of person that likes to go to party's. Do you mind to take me home after the party?" Cas asked, "No not at all, at what time do you want to go back, it's Saturday so nothing to worry about." Dean asked while pulling over. "I don't know maybe at 12 or 1AM?" Cas sounds kind of weird, it sounds like he's lying or something. "If you want to get home before midnight that's fine for me. I will bring you home whenever you want you know that." Dean looked at Cas who looked more relaxed, "Thank you, that would nice. Cas said. They pulled up at the parking of the party. They got out of the car and walked inside. Charlie, Gabe and Balthazar were already their waiting for them.
