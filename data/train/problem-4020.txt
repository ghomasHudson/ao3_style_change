From there it gets a little faster, enough for them to both be glad there were no neighbours around; and enough for Dean's breath to hitch but not come back just as fast after they both finished. Dean was gasping quietly, trying not to worry Castiel, but it was too late. Castiel noticed and immediately made sure his oxygen was coming through the tube and rubbed his chest lightly, guilt flowing through his gaze as he watched Dean fight a struggle he couldn't help him against.
Dean shovelled his food into his mouth so fast, Castiel was genuinely afraid he was going to choke or stop breathing. Dean didn’t notice the worry, in his own little world of syrup and pancakes covered in sugar.
"You ordered pizza?" Castiel's voice breaks through Dean's questionable thoughts and Dean shudders at the low graveled growl in his tone, he bites his lip and holds the door open for Castiel, who steps in and gives Dean a once over with his gaze; it's something that makes Dean feel self-conscious and flustered.
"Go right ahead, baby" He murmurs against Dean's shoulder and pulls all the way out then pushes all the way back into him and that's when Dean was a goner.
"I will be definitely showing you these so called 'ropes'." Castiel chimes from his bed and goes on to tell Dean every detail about how they had to share a bathroom and how they can leave the room by telling nurses and using wheelchairs, how checks go and food.
Dean clings tightly to Cas' bicep, forehead against Castiel's shoulder, nodding softly as he holds himself close. The touch gets a bit more teasing as Castiel's hand slips under the last layer of clothes and wraps around him. Dean moans softly against him, trying to stay quiet.
Aha, I’m writing my little note up here. I hope y’all enjoy/enjoyed the story. I knew the ending since before I started this book and I hope it doesn’t hurt your expectations too much. Anyway, warnings are listed at the bottom this time, but they will spoil it. So if you want to be surprised, don’t check. But I’ll mark where the warning part begins & ends. ALSO there will be no epilogue because I want you guys to try and think up your best idea of the epilogue in the comments. Thank you for reading.
Dean hadn't noticed till he saw his reflection in the little screen that he was grinning like he won the lottery or some crap. But all he saw was... damn- maybe he did win the lottery. The smile fades for a moment. He won the lottery and lost the lotto ticket. Or bought a pie and realized it expired the day before. Before he can self-degrade anymore Fawn comes in.
Dean watches as a very soft smile grows on Castiel’s lips. “I just think you’re gorgeous.” He murmurs to Dean; Dean feels a flush go through his cheeks.
Dean huffs. “I take care of /you/.” He corrects and it has Sam groaning as he pulls up a chair, sitting in it.
He was so proud of his angel, he was amazed by how wholesome the male was. How his eyes seemed to glow with excitement whenever he finally understood or learned a new skill. Dean thought Castiel was perfect, everything about him.
"I would never forget something so bright and beautiful," Castiel murmurs gently against Dean's mouth.
Castiel is careful to prep Dean with his fingers, but smiles softly when Dean moans his name with need, but not just a sex need, a need like he wouldn't live without Castiel. Something that made Castiel want to never let him go out into the unforgiving world ever again. But Dean Winchester was too stubborn and independent to allow the angel to do that. So this worked, being with him, with nothing between them, seeing as Castiel had gotten rid of his layers and watched with pleasure as Dean's eyes darkened to a murky everest green.
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean whispers gently and watched as Castiel’s own eyes water just a bit and a wide smile takes its place upon his face.
Before Dean knew it, he was being pressed into the couch but also against Castiel. So Dean could feel every part of the other male's body. Castiel pulled his lips away and Dean found himself trying to follow his lips to keep kissing him. Castiel just smirks at him and starts to sit up, moving Dean onto his stomach and his face pretty pressed against a pillow. "You look cute like this, Dean, but you haven't been a very good babysitter, have you?" Castiel says lowly from behind Dean.
Cas sighs. "I was making some tea." He says, handing one of the mugs to Dean. It warms up his hands when he holds it.
"Listen Dean, you're one of my brightest students, and I hate to rush you. But you've taken too long with this assignment, and I wish I could do something about it, but I've done all I could already. If you don't bring it by Friday, I'm gonna have to fail you."
"Uhm. What? Oh, no, I'm, uh. I'm okay. Well, as okay as I can be when a cup of scalding coffee is now all over my clothes." Great, now he's rambling.
With Sammy it got easier eventually. He's learned to understand him without words, to know what he's thinking, how he's feeling. Dean's sure Sam knows how much he loves him, even if he rarely tells him. He's very grateful for that.
Cas takes a little while to answer, long enough for Dean to start panicking. But when he's about deflect his offer with a joke or a change of topic, Cas nods. They're still close enough that his hair tickles Dean's forehead when he moves his head.
Dean does his best work to assess the situation, but all he's coming up with is a repetitive whisper of Cas' name inside his otherwise empty head. He does the one thing he's never been able to do, which is voice his exact thoughts out loud.
"Well, you can come by anytime. I've a studio at home where I store all of my art stuff." Dean realizes too late that he just asked this guy he met an hour ago to come to his house. "I mean, only if you want to, y'know, you don't have to or anything, but, um. Yeah." Dean stares down at the table. He would love for the earth to swallow him whole right this second. If he prays hard enough, maybe it'll happen.
Cas has always been braver than him, so he's the one who closes the gap. He presses his lips against Dean's, so ghost-like and soft that he's not sure it's real. To test that theory, Dean's brain finally restarts with a jolt, and then he's pushing forward, deepening the kiss, which he's now sure is actually happening.
"I'm an art student." That reminds him once more of his long overdue homework, but this time, he doesn't feel the worry creeping up on him the way it did earlier.
"Yes professor, I promise, I'll have it by the end of the week, I'm just having a bit of creative trouble..."
Since his body has decided to become a full-time statue, all Dean can do is stare at the wooden headboard next to Cas' face. Then he clears his throat quietly and replaces what he wants to say with something else, the way he always does.
Dean traces Cas' jawline with his thumb the way he was imagining just a few minutes earlier, which pulls a sigh out of him. The stubble tickles his skin, and it feels so good he thinks he might explode. A million words unspoken fly through Dean's mind, but he doesn't need any of them at the moment.
“You know you’re whole speech before you bit the big one-” He began a slow clap, his hands slapping together boomed into the otherwise peaceful sounds of the forest around him. Dean turned around and shouted at the sky, “Wow, man, That was impressive, especially the part where you died before I could even get a word in edgewise.” he chuckled, completely exacerbated.
Dean worried, trying to peek in through the window. He shrugged before turning to the door and pushing on it gently, half expecting it not to budge. The door opened with a groan. He slowly walked inside, his footfalls causing the wooden floorboards to creak to life. There was not a person in sight, although Dean swore he’d heard a scurrying sound… He turned towards the pool table where he was certain the noise came from, before taking quiet steps in the same direction, looking for anything he could find to use as a weapon.
“I--” Sam shook her head again then more spew trickled out of her mouth and onto the floor between them, splashing up on Deanna’s legs and causing her own stomach to pulse. She gagged and coughed before regaining her composure and shaking her sister's shoulders.
Castiel sat in a black suit, in the driver's seat of the Impala, the engine purring as he and Jack waited for Sam and Dean. Jack, now six years old, sat in the passenger seat and was finishing off the paperwork on an assignment for his internship.
“What’s wrong with me?” Castiel laughed, “Dean, what’s wrong with you? We're in heaven, my grace is slowly but surely renewing itself. You've been mad at me all day. If you weren’t yelling at me now for healing you, you'd be yelling at me about something else.” Dean scoffed.
“Uh, yeah, sure,” she replied as she followed her sister back out into the hallway, Jesse in toe. The tall man rushed past the smaller sister and took his place at his girlfriend's side.
Mary, the sneak that she was, had plied her son with copious drinks after John had dramatically vacated the premises, and via snarky comments and sarcastic jokes, the two had managed to have what closely resembled a deep and meaningful conversation. She let Dean know that she would be there for him and that she was proud of the man he had become. Dean, in response, mentioned that if he had made things between her and John so unbearable, Ketch always seemed to be sniffing around for her. Mary replied with a playful swipe to his head.
He sat back up straight as his chest grew warm. Dean avoided looking at the man in the bed. He sniffed and scratched his nose. He trained his eyes to Cas' chest again and bounced his leg while he licked his lips absentmindedly.
“Maybe you just didn’t want to see it? Or, er... you weren’t ready to... ” Dean stared at the bottle in between the two of them, biting his lip. Sam studied his older brother. The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the quiet containing the ultimate unbreached subject. “So... you gonna avoid him now after spending months trying to get him back?” Sam questioned.
Deanna downed the last of her first drink and made a start on the second glass, her head had started to feel lighter. Sam continued to sip at first her drink, she appeared deep in thought.
he recalled. What was the time now? He knew it was probably 8:30ish, 9:00 at a stretch. He was too scared to look at his watch, too terrified to pull out his phone from his pocket. Dean, as if on autopilot, took his toothbrush and toothpaste out of the mirror cabinet and squeezed the tube onto the brush. There's no way that his dream could have been real. He tried to tell himself. There’s no way! Hadn’t Jack promised the last time that He saw them that He would be a hands-off God? Visiting people in their dreams didn’t exactly count as being hands-off. Dean relaxed a little, bringing the brush up to his mouth. He decided he would try to put his dream out of his mind for now. It was probably just a nightmare. A really lucid nightmare. A really lucid, really specific nightmare but hey, he’d been through some weird shit... so why wouldn’t that transfer over into his dreams? It was probably PTSD. That's what Sam was always saying, anyway. Like the times when Dean randomly found himself unable to breathe sometimes, or when he woke up sweating, Sam standing over him, having evidently just woken him up, or even like that one time when he felt his heart beating irregularly while he was out buying groceries and called the ambulance only to find out that all those years of eating crappy diner food hadn’t actually caught up with him. PTSD had probably leaked into his dream to promise him another reason not to rest.
"First, I made a deal with Amara... It was pretty easy to convince the Shadow I was dead." Jack started. "It had wanted my soul ever since I woke it up, so, after stopping my heart with help from some narcotics, I woke up in the Empty." He smiled gently at Dean's worried face, "I had learned The Shadows weakness during my time with God's power so when I finally arrived... I went looking around, until I found, and woke up, Crowley." Dean wasn't expecting that.
“Dean,” Mary beamed, her arms wide. Dean made his way around the table to her side so she could pull him into a tight hug. She laughed as she let him go.
For a moment Dean considered taking an easier path; praying to Adam instead. After all, he was curious to find out how his younger brother was adjusting to being a literal angel of the lord. Dean wondered, If Castiel had made it out of the empty, then maybe Michael had somehow made it out as well. If so, what did that mean for Adam? What would become of
Matthew 22:30 (Yeah... I literally looked up the bible for this one...) "In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven."
"Dean, what happened?" Castiel's pressed. Dean rolled his eyes and handed the bottle back, Cas cradled it in his lap as he leaned toward him. "Dean, please". His voice was so gentle that it made Dean's heart squeeze. He shut his eyes tight and breathed in deeply, he felt the weight of the emotions swirling around in his chest. When he opened his eyes again they had a newfound vulnerability to them, his eyebrows raised in the middle. He licked at his lips.
“Hey, you okay?” Dean asked, his voice gruff, as his thumb traced a line down Cas’s index finger. Castiel swallowed hard and pulled his hand from Dean's to sit on his own lap. Dean’s stomach tightened.
“Sure,” he stated and smiled at Deanna knowingly, before retreating. Deanna raised her red and orange beverage off the napkin and took a large swig before placing the glass down on the table and lifting the napkin, waving it toward her younger sister. She stuck her tongue out slightly between her red lips as she smiled, displaying the name Ryan and a telephone number written in black ink, smudged by a ring from the base of her drink. Sam rolled her eyes while she sucked her blue drink through the paper straw.
This whole thing seems a bit sketchy to him, so he goes upstairs to check on the child. Taking note of the photos lining the wall. The couple in the photos were very young, photos from the wedding, and then towards the top there were a few baby photos. Great, he was watching a baby. He pushes open a door that has the name 'Winnie' stickered on the front of it.
Dean glanced at the water below him. Sometimes he wished he was a seashell. Where he was allowed to sink to the depths and not have to worry about anything because it didn’t matter. Or he could be found and placed on a mantle like he was prized and desired. He wanted to be something.
It's silent over the phone before Dean hears a sniffle from Sam's end. "Hey! You better not be googling that crap. I'm gonna be fine, the hospital bill is gonna be more deadly than this disease, Sammy."
Sam feels tears roll down his cheeks, but not because he’s in pain. But because he’s happy and fulfilled.
Dean glances up from where he’s resting his head against Cas’ chest. “I guess because he helps people and he has cowboy boots, also he doesn’t take shit.” He replies and Castiel nuzzles him gently as he speaks.
Dean blinks, he absolutely did not want to go to the hospital. It took him a week to finally get to the walk-in clinic. "Uh-now?" He asks slowly, hoping it wasn't now.
Castiel pulled away slightly, a knee between Dean's thighs, practically pressing up against his crotch. "Let's start with your torso." He murmurs, hands sliding under Dean's shirt, feeling across his lower stomach, over his pecs, to his shoulders; pushing the fabric up with his movements and tossing the fabric over Dean's head quickly after that. Castiel's hands rub slowly along his sides and along his lower stomach. "You're
He barely notices he’s back in his house until he realizes he’s staring at the camcorder on the counter top. The last thing Dean gave him besides a kiss. He wanted him to have it back. Moving over to it, he touches the frame gently and wraps his hand around it, opening the screen.
And while Dean fell asleep extremely fast, Castiel barely blinked until he was sure Dean's breathing was stable enough to make it through the night.
”Don’t worry Dean, Sam is living. Not just surviving. He’s living now, because of you.” Eileen says from the seat beside Dean.
It had been a few days since Sam’s visit ended. He was happy to see his brother, even though he never wanted Sam to see him like this. Of course Sam is too damn stubborn for his own good.
Dean smiles shyly, feeling Cas' mouth against his head. "Why are you in the hospital? For pneumonia?" He questions, nervous that it was insulting or rude.
Dean blushes brightly, but says nothing because what he wanted to say was 'Don't leave', but he knew Castiel would be happier out of the hospital and in the actual world. Away from him.
Dean Winchester was the brightest soul that Castiel had ever seen, but his soul was no longer there and glowing. It was gone.
Dean hadn't lasted long and had released into Castiel's mouth with a groan and his hands tightened around the sheets. He was panting. Castiel moved back up his body and he looked at Dean as he sucked a mark right into his freckled shoulder, then into his collarbone, taking in the shaky moan he gave. He blew on the mark when it was dark enough. "I need you." Dean says softly, the few words he's said.
They held him after his first heartbreak and let go of him when he decided that he wanted to travel after graduation.
Dean swallows hard, eyes studying Castiel as if not believing he was actually there. Flashbacks of Castiel being taken go over his mind, but he focuses back on the moment. His lips part, trying to form words.
”If I had answered, I could’ve heard his voice talk to me- instead I hear his last words to me... over a fucking voice message.” He takes another breath, though Castiel notices the tremble doesn’t leave.
Castiel laughs at Dean's question before nodding. "He owns a candy shop," He rephrases with a smile.
Dean whines softly when Castiel lifts him to straddle his lap and blushes, but winces when his sore ass comes in contact with Castiel's legs. Castiel smiles and kisses his lips softly and sweetly. "You were so perfect for me, Dean, but you need to rest now. Need to come back to yourself," Castiel rumbles and Dean blinks, not very good at focusing after such a wild time.
Dean bites his lip, blushing darkly about to give some sort of smart ass answer, before he feels Castiel's tongue move right over his hole. Dean's ability to sass just vanished and all he could do was make a soft groaning sound that sounded like 'uh-huh'. Dean didn't grow anymore silent as Castiel continued to work him over just using his tongue.
Dean took a sip of his coffee as he held Cas’ hand across the counter in their kitchen. “I hope Sam is doing alright,” he says into his coffee cup.
Dean thinks bitterly to himself, but was slightly sated by the fact Castiel had lightly pressed his mouth to Dean's.
"Oh. I have pneumonia, it's gotten worse over the past while so I'm staying here till it's under control. Don't worry, the case I have isn't contagious." He assures and Dean gives a small smile at his assurances.
There was Dean, leaning upright against the passenger’s door, eyes closed and lips slightly parted. Castiel would’ve thought he was knocked out if not for the lack of colour, the fact he had a large puncture wound in his abdomen, but that wasn’t what got Castiel.
So Dean searches the rest of the house, there's still no baby. There's no contact numbers, Dean doesn't even have a phone. Hold up.
They stay that way until Castiel gets the reminder that he actually has to go home. Getting out, he kisses Dean’s lips gently and feels something cold press into his hand. His camcorder. Looking at Dean and watching his eyes crinkle a bit as he gives a wide but tired grin, kissing his head gently as he moves away, he sighs. “I love you, Dean, see you tomorrow.” He muses and Dean nods in agreement, waving gently as Castiel makes his way out the door.
The next morning, Castiel had panicked when he saw Dean was no longer in the bed beside him. The panic drained away when he smelt something sweet in the air.
”Hey, Dean?” Cas’ soft loving voice drifts through his inner monologue to himself and Dean allows his eyes to drift up to meet the piercing blue ones.
”Is it good steak? Because if the hospital ruins this for me, I’m suing them.” Dean says in fake seriousness.
Sam tried to make Dean’s childhood the best he could. He taught him to catch and enjoy nature. He taught him the outlines of marvel and DC. The importance of school and learning. But he taught him the most about how there are many things that can put a person on a path, whether it’s good or bad, but it’s that individuals choice to let their fate be decided for them or if they’ll write their own story.
It was quiet as they ate, but the peaceful silence was broken when Dean spoke up, mouth full of food, but voice coming through anyway. “I want to take you on a drive in Baby.” He says softly, gaze finally going to Castiel for the first time since they sat down for the delicious meal.
Dean feels a soft cool rush along his face as his door is opened and Castiel takes his hand gently to help him out. He's being led somewhere, his oxygen tank on his back. Curious, he stays quiet. Wanting auditory clues.
Castiel hangs up and throws his phone to the side, pressing his palms into his eyes and pulling at his hair.
Sam sniffles softly, he always thought his brother would be here to share this moment. A moment that may not have ever happened if it wasn’t for Dean in the first place.
Castiel gasps and makes his hand to his chest. “Oh my gosh, the honour. I’ve never felt so completed!” He says and Dean giggles.
”You’re my brother, but you’re also my role model.” He says gently, making Dean crack an emotional smile.
He watches as her eyes go over the page and she types lightning fast into the computer. "Yes, you can actually head right back. Follow the signs until you see 'X-ray waiting room'. A doctor will come and get you when they're ready." She replies and Dean nods slowly, listening to her instructions until he sees the sign and takes a turn to sit down in one of the chairs.
Dean was back in the hospital, smiling widely as he felt Cas’ hand stroke along the knuckle of his own.
When they get there, Castiel gives Dean a tour and it isn’t huge, but it’s cozy and it’s just Cas. Dean finds himself very keen on nuzzling with the bisexual coloured Pie plush that Cas bought him as they lay against each other on the couch. “Why do you find Doctor Sexy, sexy?” Castiel asks after they’ve started an episode.
”Relax, love,” Castiel urges Dean gently, giving a loving smile in his direction as Dean pulls Cas’ hand that was holding his to his mouth to press a kiss to the top of his hand.
”He left a note for you. Said I had to make sure you got it. It’s in his hand, would you like me to get it?” She questions and Castiel doesn’t look away from Dean.
Dean sighs, content with Castiel content. At least for the moment. He already missed actual Castiel.
Dean takes it all in, the bright blue of the ocean seemed so dull in comparison to shine in Cas' eyes. 'so cheesy' Dean rolls his eyes at himself. He glances at Castie; again. "You didn't have to do this for me-" he's cut off by Castiel's lips being pressed against him.
Dean was also blushing, a very shy grin playing on his lips. "Well my eyes can't even compare to the lightning blues Cas is sportin'," He says, trying to take the attention off the fact Castiel had practically called his eyes pretty.
”Well... I was wondering if you maybe wanted to spend the night with me at my place? If not,-“ Dean doesn’t let him get to the end of the sentence before he’s kissing him hard, feeling tears spring up.
Castiel moves to stand by the head of the bed, where he can look down at Dean's face, his tears were drying, but Castiel could still see the pain and sorrow in them. Right now, it was his mission to make Dean feel loved and valued. To make him feel
Dean laughs softly at his excitement, running a hand through his hair slightly, imagining it was Cas playing with his hair while they cuddled in their memory foam mattress, a queen, Dean had replaced it when they started dating because they did so many fun things. Sex, cuddles, kisses, Netflix, emotional chick flick moments, but it was, it was all perfect. Dean couldn't ask for anything better except that maybe his brother was still there.
He didn't actually have that many things, but Fawn respected his request and left the room. Dean moves to the next video, noticing that there was an obvious change between this Castiel and the one in the last video. He plays it.
Dean's harsh gaze stared straight into the reflective surface, glaring at the sight of himself. His hands clenched the corner of the sink so harshly he could feel the indents forming, but he refused to pull away. His eyes move over himself in the mirror, his nose scrunching in distaste at the sight of his freckled skin. He hated them; he hated himself. To him, the freckles were nothing more than annoying mistakes that littered his skin and made him flawed. He was already flawed, the freckles just made him feel even more flawed. He always noticed how slightly off centered his nose was, how many lines he had around his eyes, how tired he was, how reckless he could be, but he could live with those things because he always had. The freckles just started to show up over time and that's what he couldn't stand.
The kiss felt unworldly between them. The chapped pillowed feeling of Castiel’s lips against Dean’s damp plump ones made magic between them. Castiel licked gently at Dean’s lower lip and took his dive into the man cave he wanted to explore.
Dean sinks into his bedding, exhausted. He hadn’t been eating much and his sleep was practically non-existent. He took it as nerves from everything that had happened with Castiel over such a short period of time. He didn’t want to mention why he was so quiet, it hurt. He didn’t know why it hurt. But the past few days have just been bad breathing days; he didn’t want to worry Castiel and the doctors were checking on him regularly as they could.
Snorting but carefully maneuvering himself into the hospital bed, Castiel wraps his arms around Dean and inhales softly against his hair. He smelled good.
Whether you believe it or not, no one is as selfless, strong, brave, grounded as you are." When Dean parts his lips to argue, Castiel kisses him softly, but firm.
Dean nods and murmurs out a soft yes for verbal response. His body shudders under Castiel as his clothes are stripped away from him body and goosebumps go over a lot of his surface area. Not because he was scared or cold, but because his
Castiel stares out the windshield. The weather contrasting the deep hurt that had happened in the time he’s been in the car. He takes a breath. “Sam, I’m so-“ he cuts himself off, those words never helped anybody during a time like this.
Castiel must have been staring for moments longer than he thought because Dean turns around and is beside him in a minute, hugging him and burying his face against his shoulder. “Breakfast is ready,” he muses and presses a kiss to Cas’ cheek which makes a wide smile appear on both male’s faces.
The ocean. The water that Dean had spent a good amount of time around was pooled around his ankles as he stood with Castiel, just breathing.
wrong. Dean took notice of his surroundings which was very posh and sanitized. The couch he was sitting on was a weird lavender colour and he wasn't sure what to think of that, the rest of the living room seemed to be based off that shade of purple as well. There was a small piece of paper beside a silver photo frame of a family that Dean had never seen before. He picks it up quickly, needing to find out everything he could about the clean freak show of a house he was in; Dean reads over the paper quickly.
"Dean Winchester, and uh- yeah... but he shouldn't be though. He has University to focus on." He replies.
”Well, I hope you’re having a great day and maybe the next video will be me skinny dipping so the ocean can suck it.” Castiel snorts in the video and Dean cracks a wide smile that hurts.
Dean and Castiel had been bonding over the few months. They now acted like they had known each other for a lifetime and they actually talked about that. They both believe that maybe their souls existed in another world or universe with each other, hunting monsters or something. Dean wasn't going to lie to himself, Castiel was someone he was starting to form a little crush on. He tried to ignore it though because Castiel was getting better and was probably going to leave soon.
I finished this sometime after 1 AM, I apologize for it being trash. But I thrive if angst comments about your feelings on this and comments in general. So yeah, also I left the ‘note’ and the ending up for interpretation from y’all and because it’s 1:13 AM.
After begrudgingly and slightly curiously (okay super curiously) getting ready, Fawn leads him down to the main floor. It feels weird to be out of his room, especially holding onto a rolling machine that wasn’t like the ones other people were dragging through the halls. This one looked like a rolling backpack.
Sam chuckles, but it ends as a pained sound. “Me too.” He whispers, before huffing through the phone, like he was trying to manage himself.
"Hello, Dean. I know it must be tough losing a roommate, but I'm here to ask if you would like to transfer to a single patient room?" She asks with a small smile.
Dean blushes brightly and hides his face closer to Castiel, feeling a soft chuckle against him. Dean whines when he hears that sound and Castiel kisses him to keep him quiet. "Hush now, baby, I won't cut you off." Castiel assures, speeding his hand up along Dean.
It doesn't take long for a doctor with a caramel complexion, a white coat, and a name tag that says 'Dr. Jackie' to come and get him. He was concerned for himself only based off the fact that the speed of him getting in was too fast for him to not have any huge problems. "Make sure you have no jewelry on and please remove any unnecessary layers. Make sure your shirt is completely cotton or very thin. Shoes off." She says gently and takes his leather jacket, his over coat, and his flannel from him as he strips those layers off.
Castiel's plump, pink, pillowed lips covered Dean's with gentle force and his hands move gently to cup Dean's face between them. Dean leans to kiss back trying to remember the feeling. Cas' lips were warm and he tasted like the honey tea he always had for breakfast.
Castiel smiled and pressed his lips to Dean’s temple and stayed close. Running his hand through Dean’s and holding him. Dean accepted the touches and squeezed Cas’ hand that was wrapped around him gently.
”My phone rang again... not long after and I thought it was some dumb telemarketer. No-“ he sniffles hard. “The hospital.”
Sam, himself, Jack, and Castiel sat on the table in the bunker, with bottles of beer, a whiskey, or a juice box in each of their hands. He smiles, eyes filling with tears before he realized how much those people were his family. He places it down and glances at the other frames. Pictures of him and Sam, Baby, and Castiel filled most of the others. However, none Dean hadn’t seen before. He took a step back, admiring. “Damn, the perfect apple pie home.” He says out loud to himself.
Dean's face burns brightly because he was currently about to be spanked by a pizza man version of his best friend right after having mind-blowing sex. Dean was nuzzling against a pillow that had fallen on the floor and Castiel chuckled from above him. "I need a verbal answer to make sure this is okay, Dean," He says and Dean nods quickly.
Dean stares at the chocolate pudding until suddenly he's staring into the darkness of his eyelids and he sinks away into a well-needed sleep.
Castiel pulls him closer, cleaning his hand with a napkin he had shoved in his jacket. "Let's go find heart rocks and stick our feet in the water." Castiel says and pulls him gently into his arms and leads him to the water, both of them giggling excitedly as they head to the open sea.
A strangled sound that sounded almost like a gasp and a whimper left his lips and he spun around with wide eyes.
"Dean Winchester," A nurse says, holding a file as she stands at the beginning of a plain hallway, looking expectantly up at the waiting room, where Dean Winchester was in fact, sitting.
There was a click of a lid, cool sensations and finally a slow and careful push until hips were against hips. Castiel's hands now rested on Dean's hipbones that showed a bit more than they should, but Castiel didn't say anything or even second glance as he stares into Dean's eyes. "Tell me when I can move, lovely." He muses and doesn't break eye contact.
Castiel let a small smile, a curious smile playing his lips. "What about us?" He asks as he moves his hand to hold Dean's.
He was blinking rapidly now, eyes watering from how hard he was staring, he probably forgot to blink; maybe his emotions were getting to him as well. He swallows thickly, squeezing his eyes tight now. "Gotta get a drink," He mutters to himself, pushing off the counter and walking out of the bathroom to head towards the kitchen. He wasn't worried about Sam giving him a lecture about how alcohol is a stupid choice at 11 in the morning; it's five'o'clock somewhere.
Castiel doesn't stop until Dean's whining so much that his words are barely understandable, but he's still lucid. He rubs Dean's probably very sore ass, but smiles at the male who shudders until the gentle touch. "Did that feel good?" He whispers gently to Dean, who nods in response.
Before he got a word in, Fawn starts to speak. “Okay, get up, get your shoes on. I already got you hooked up to the transferable oxygen machine.” She says quickly, Dean barely has time to process the words.
”Actually I was told earlier that I’m allowed to be discharged today.” He says softly, Dean straightens and looks at him with wide eyes.
The ocean, they were at the ocean. "What is this?" He questions and glances at Castiel, smiling softly.
After Castiel finished explaining everything, Dean smiled and tilted his head. "Wanna play 21 questions?"
that he's commando right now. He shifts awkwardly where he's standing and is about to go back to sit on the couch and panic, but the doorbell rings.
When that calmed down, Dean and Cas turned. Dean gave Sam a smile as Sam looked at him, not with disbelief, but with a calmness that would have made hell shiver.
Dean flashes Cas a smile, before looking down. "I'm sorry, that was stupid of me to say-" He starts to ramble before Castiel silences him by putting his mouth on Dean's.
Dean mentally agreed. “You know what I do sometimes that helps me sleep?” He asks softly, taking in the role of the helper like what he often did with his little brother.
”He usually appears around lunch. Sometimes he brings McDonald’s burgers, hopefully this is one of those times.” He says with a hopeful sigh.
Dean didn't know if it was pity of being in such a happy space with memories that can't really be the same or if she was actually doing her job, but either way he didn't mind. "Uh-yeah, maybe a change will be good for me... Give me a few minutes to get my things together?" He asks.
It took me such an embarrassing amount of time for me to remember the word case in this chapter, judge me in your head, but comment your love for the book 😉   OH BY THE WAY. The last chapter is next chapter (:
One that made everything go into hyper focus, slow motion, a spiral of confusion and despair, drop into him. “Billie,” Castiel says slowly, glancing around as he pulls his phone away from his ear.
touch always started a spark in him. He felt the light kisses from Castiel along his neck until they reached his mouth, hands now removing his own clothes. Dean just watches him, he was gorgeous inside and out and Dean didn't understand how it was possible.
He watches as the doctor writes down more notes under those ones. "What type of work environment are you in? And do you smoke? How's your food intake?" He questions calmly, staring at Dean with this unmoving gaze.
”I just wanted to hear you say it, Cas,” Dean murmurs into the phone, something that has Castiel tilting his head.
Dean catches Castiel's stare in the mirror and Castiel gives a sly smile towards him and wraps an arm around Dean's waist and pulls him into his lap. Dean is
Dean knew about Cas' childhood, how it had mostly been him and his older brother, Gabriel. He learned that Castiel was 27 wanted to be an English teacher, but had to pull out of school because of his pneumonia. He knew Castiel's favourite colour was yellow and he was obsessed with bees. Castiel had learned a fair amount of stuff about Dean as well, which was good. Dean did sometimes like opening up about his life. Especially since this was his life now.
"I asked if you were alright?" He says gently to Dean again, not moving his hand, he was keeping his eyes connected with Dean's.
After a few minutes of the annoying beeps, two nurses came in. One was lovely lady named Allie and the other was a kind girl named Fawn. They were both amazing people and very soft and caring as Allie checked Castiel and Fawn checked Dean. “What have you two trouble makers been up to?” Allie Asia and Dean glances over to Castiel as Castiel looks at Dean.
I feel the camcorder is going to be important to the story... We all know which fic I got that from (;
Castiel looks over at him. "Perhaps we can become friends while treatments are going on." He suggests, almost shy about it.
”I get it. I’m sorry that I talked about it... I just wanted to make sure, you weren’t alone.” Sam coughs hard, the kind after you’ve cried hard enough that you lose your voice.
“Why are your feet so dirty?” He asks shyly, as if Castiel might close up and tell him that it isn’t his business, but Dean knew they were passed hiding things now.
"Anyway, my religious experience. I just came out of church! And I had this feeling while the pastor was talking about the sowing of seeds. How the seeds can't grow in curtain circumstances because of the devil. I know I haven't been planted in rock by Satan, but I don't think I've had the growing I believe is coming to me. 'Grow in adversity' quoted by... whoever said that. Anyway, I'm going on a jog, maybe meet the man of my dreams." He says and smiles at the camera before the video ends.
Dean grins even more and holds him tighter. “I would love to make my dishes for you,” he says sweetly, kissing him again, quick but full of enough love to make stars explode.
Dean looked around, squinting as he leaned against the impala with relaxed posture, he imagines Castiel in front of him, kissing his lips gently with his hands pressed against Dean's jaw. Dean smiles a bit more, his tongue between his teeth for a moment as he focuses on the road to his side and the forest trees in front of him, leaves rustling gently around him. "Hey, baby, just wanted to call you." Dean replies, voice steady, a soft and gentle undertone.
“Cas, in the most polite way possible. Fuck my condition. I’m asking just for this, okay? Let me take you on a drive.” He says, seeming almost desperate.
Dean listened intently to every detail, listening to the gravel of his voice and his words how they slurred together a bit, but were still understandable. Dean was happy to listen to this man forever. Even though he didn't even know him.
"It is okay! The only other nickname I've gotten is Cassie from my older brother and I find it insufferable." Castiel chuckles out.
“Mornin’ Cas,” Dean chimes with a mouthful and turns to see Castiel with a smile on his face. He looked better than yesterday.
Dr. Jackie doesn't seem phased, she's probably dealt with worse tantrums. "It means that at the rate this disease is going at, there's a chance that you may not survive more than 3 years. Now I'm going to help you get admitted into special treatment, if you have any family or friends, you may call them, ask for them to get some of your stuff. We'll set you up in a room..."
Dean looks at the screen. “Damn! It is! Wow, my day is perfect so far! Breakfast in bed, my roommate at my side and doctor sexy.” He grins and Castiel chuckles.
I’ve decided there’s either going to be ten or eleven chapters. I’m not sure if they’ll come out in the next week or in the next month. I just kind of type. (:
He looks at his hand for a moment, biting his lip to stop it from quivering. Watching his hand tremble slightly as it grips a piece of paper, seeing the dark red coating it and his hand. He carefully holds it against his heart. Dean looks up again, holding his breath.
The room matched the mood they had been for a good amount of the day, fairy lights were stringed along the walls and the glow was soft against the pale cyan of the bedding and walls. It was nice and Dean instantly felt calmed and safer than he usually felt. Castiel squeezed his hand gently and Dean flickers his gaze up to him as Castiel brings him to the bed and lays him down. "Is this still okay, Dean?" He whispers.
He looks down at it, there was dried red tinted colours on it but he carefully opens it, ignoring the stains.
Dean nods again. “Just, please, make...” he takes in a breath. “Make sure Castiel gets the note, okay? Please.” He breathes out, feeling very heavy despite no longer having an able body.
Dean blinks for a moment, trying to come up with some sort of lie, but his emotions take control before the Winchester side of him can. His eyes well up with tears and he's not exactly sure what's going on, but words spill from his mouth without his permission. Words he never wanted anyone to hear. "Why can't I be good enough? I can't do anything right. I can't talk how people want me to talk. I can't act how people want me to act. I can't even stand to be around me. Then I noticed the stupid friggin' freckles all over my body and I just- I hate them. It's like someone took mud and splattered it all over me, but they won't go away. I just wanna have some sort of confidence, but I can't, my body was all that I was semi proud of and now I can't, I hate it. I hate me." Sometime through that rant of mumbled and jumbled feelings, Dean's tears had actually started and when he realized it made him feel more ridiculous; he tries to pull away, to turn his head, to avoid all of Castiel's reactions or words.
Dean blinked quickly into realization that someone was there when a hand went on his shoulder and he tensed, spinning around to meet the gaze. "Cas?" He breathes out, confused and still trying to fully reach his normal functioning self again.
”And... I have decided to not have the tv on. I know when you come, doctor sexy will be playing but I’d rather have you. You’re way cuter than him and you always ramble and I wanna listen tomorrow. I wanna do that for you. I love you, hopefully I remember to delete this before you see this-“ he says before sneezing.
"Yes," Castiel starts, his hands trailing up Dean's shirt and somehow the fabric covering Dean's torso was just gone, "I'm going to pleasure and then
But he watched as Castiel hums Can’t Help Falling In Love by Elvis. He watches as Castiel’s movements seemed to light and weightless as he packed up his things in a supplied cardboard box. And he watched as Castiel met his eye and gave a smile so bright that Dean didn’t need the sun to supply light anymore.
, Dean." He murmurs, hearing a soft groan leave Dean's mouth again, he switches to take him in his mouth again.
Castiel snorts. “I’m fucking hot as hell, cute? That’s you- though I’d say you’re more on the adorable side.” He says, nosing Dean’s hair gently and pressing a kiss to his head.
One of Castiel's hands stays on his hip and the other is sliding gently into Dean's pants, palming him through the thin layer of boxer material. "Tell me if you need me to stop, love." Castiel says gently as he moves his mouth down Dean's jaw.
Dean and Castiel glance over at her with amused but appreciative smiles. “You’re probably right,” Dean sighs.
Billie touches his shoulder and soon they’re in front of the impala. Castiel isn’t sure what to feel when he sees it, it’s there. In front of him, but there’s no Dean and his gaze goes over to Billie, who wasn’t looking at him right now. She was looking past him and the impala.
Dean's whole body tenses up and he glances around for anything that could be a weapon. Barely anything, despite seeing no baby anywhere, this whole place is baby-proofed.  He moves over the door, if he goes down, he can go down swinging. He opens the door and his whole body goes from tense to just fully frozen. "Cas?" Dean questions, shocked at what he's seeing.
It had been a week or so since Castiel last came. But Dean wasn’t worried, they texted everyday and FaceTimed and overall it was a stable relationship.
Castiel argued and debated with himself through the pain. He could see Dean’s little smile on the pixelated screen. He clicks it quickly, trying to grasp him as much as he could.
“Dark, creepy, something out of Wes Cravins erotic fantasy? Yeah, it's one hundred percent the place”. Dean confirmed, both with himself and to his brother.
--” and that was it. Dean sat up with a sigh and paused his phone, causing the television to stop. He patted the memory of Castiel on his forearm and then stood up, while Castiel stared at him in confusion.
“Just a flat,” he gestured a line with his hand horizontally, “No?” Cas sighed. He inhaled deeply, turning his whole body toward Dean.
He never imagined Cas would just sit there and stare at him like he'd just announced he'd grown a second head or had been recently getting really into murdering innocent children.
I could see. He seems a bit off, you know, he’s too prissy; uptight. There's definitely something wrong with that angel, wouldn’t surprise me to find out he’s a queer.” Dean shut his eyes and tried to focus on containing the rage that was screaming inside him.
just asking about the bed, but yeah, I guess it would help to have the whole room. You know, in case it rains or something.” Cas’ smile grew wider for a moment before he returned to looking back out of the window with a sigh.
I'm gonna try update this bad boy a bit more frequently so look out for some sporadic chapter drops. :)
Dean's anger had been taken over by his grief, and his grief eventually subsided leaving him defeated. Defeated, and alone, and standing on a bridge in the middle of nowhere in heaven, his breathing returned to some semblance of normalcy.
. He felt a little guilty, getting plastered enough to go searching for more alcohol in a home that wasn't his own. He recalled that at least everyone had gone to bed by then so he didn't receive any comments or odd looks, so he tried to tell himself it was alright. He made a mental note to not do anything like that again in the future though,
"Trying not to wake you up. The hell are you doing awake at this time? Shouldn't you be resting, trying to heal?" Dean asked, trudging himself down the remainder of the steps.
“Is this hell?” Dean asked as he blinked at the sudden bright sun that shone down on them where they stood, in the empty field peppered with wildflowers. It didn’t feel like hell to Dean, however,
Jack picked up the Beanie Baby in one hand and pushed Dean's other to his back, implying that he should retrieve the Transformer. Cas seated Dean!Duck and Firetruck!Sam beside BeanieBaby!Jack and smugly looked expectantly at Dean. Dean rolled his eyes and placed the Transformer!Cas by the others before he stiffly walked Barbie!Kelly toward where the group of toys sat, pushing her torso back up when it fell, halfway. Dean cleared his throat and pursed his lips sitting up straighter to be in character.
“I wish I could interfere, Dean. I would, you know. I’d send you back there right now if it were up to me. Chuck really did a number on the order and even if I could send your soul back down there, the way it is, Sam would be killed in a second.” Dean sniffed and shot the last of his drink.
Dean's mind raced as his breathing increased. He felt somewhat calm still, despite the possible danger he was now in, despite the very real possibility that he was about to be tortured for all of eternity. He tried to feel the weight of his fear but it seemed lighter, like it was hidden from him, lifted from him, unwillingly. The air around Dean smelled clean, open. Birds sang from a nearby tree.
“I could create some for you if you’d like,” Cas asked, shifting his weight on his feet, “You’re making us even later.” Dean sighed and cartoonishly swung the driver's side door open, flopping himself out of the car and slamming the door shut. The air outside was hot and smelled like a mixture of saltwater and deep-fried food. He walked over to Castiel’s side of the parking space.
"Damn, right!" Dean agreed, his smile slowly faded and his eyes glazed over as his mind raced through a montage of the many times he'd died, imagining himself replaced by Kaia or Claire or any of the newer generation of hunters. He just hoped that he had taught them all he could.
“I don’t think that would have been wise... had I been "wasted", I doubt I would have been able to remain as polite as I was to your father.” Dean rolled his eyes as Cas swung his feet down to the floor and pulled open the door beside him. The creaking sound filled the still night air around them. The muffled sounds of music pulsed from inside the Roadhouse. Dean flung open the driver's door as Cas slammed his own door shut, then the blonde picked up his last beer and scooted over into the passenger seat, watching as Cas groaned and clutched his torso as he slid into the driver's seat and closed the door.
His parents smiled at him as the busboy led them over to their table. Dean stood, his chair scraped against the wooden decking.
“Oh, you are? Well, that's fine then”. He spat sarcastically. “Look, I don’t get what Castiel sees in you, but he’s been a dear friend of mine since before your species was even amoebic, so, if
Simon was bald and wore thick-framed glasses. He was pretty lanky and if Dean had to pick, he’d guess he was some sort of academic, a professor of something maybe? Just one of those people that made Dean feel like a dumbass purely because he enunciated every letter so clearly.
‘shrink prescribed angst tranqs’, and yeah I’m fine with it. I’m happy if you’re happy... but I also know, it’s gotta be bad or you wouldn’t even consider taking any kind of anxiety medication”. Dean licked his lips and scooted down in his seat, resting his head on the backrest and closing his eyes. He focused on his breathing, trying to calm himself down.
"Thank you, Steven", Cas grinned, his eyes glassy. "You make an attractive woman". Steve laughed and made eye contact with Dean.
“As in the Valium that I was prescribed in the psych ward? Isn’t that a little outta date?” Dean shrugged.
“That doesn't mean that there's not another way though. I'm sure if anyone could find a loophole, it'd be you, Dean.” Dean tilted his head, his brows lowered.
“Are you gonna put on some music or should I”. he asked after a while, changing the subject. Sam sighed, and even with his eyes closed, Dean could tell that his brother had given up on trying to push him to talk.
He made his way out of the library, his booted footfalls echoing through the hallway as he walked to the basement. He hadn’t been down here in a while. Not since he lost Cas. He'd always hated this room. It was cold and musty and smelled like old, moldy paper. The air seemed thinner than usual, Dean noted, as he looked around the room. His eyes settled on the corner where… where the empty came. Dean couldn’t waste any time thinking about that now. He would not let himself slip into despair, not while his brother's life was on the line. A pang ran through his whole body and came to rest in his stomach as he accidentally let a horrible thought in.
on Dean’s face from the get-go and had been gently trying to pull it out of him ever since. All of it was just so overwhelming. With the morning’s epiphany bouncing around his mind and tearing at his stomach, he couldn’t help but feel as if he’d backed himself into a corner. He was sick of being so afraid, he just wanted to rest, to put the heaviness he carried down for just a moment, and yet, he now felt like he’d just exposed himself to Charlie without her even asking.
“It’s unsurprising to find your soul's residence isn’t actually a location”. Cas stated, breaking the silence between them.
“You do whatever you want.” he cleared his throat, “So are we good now? Can we head back in?” Dean raised his brows and glanced back at the doorway.
Dean continued to explore heaven. He was finally starting to feel content, relaxed, at the idea of this being his new home. His little thought experiment, however lacking in imagination it may have been, had helped him come to terms with leaving Sam alone on earth; helping Dean find a sense of peace with his decision.
Dean gives a grin as he steps back. “Of course I did, bitch.” He says as Castiel steps forward and envelops Dean’s hand in his own, a smile towards Sam showing.
Taking as deep of a breath as he can, a choked sob leaves his lips and his body trembles with the emotional pain making a physical appearance.
Sam shakes his head, a soft sniffle to try and maintain the composure he knew he didn't need in front of his brother. "I can't, Dean-" He starts to protest, his voice cracking.
Billie was quiet for a few moments. “Castiel, I... Ive grown fond of you and your ‘Team Free Will’. I’m sure I can glance away or distract if you ever want to see him. But it was his time, he did the right thing.” She says and Castiel stares at the folded piece of paper in his hand.
Dean smiles and it seemed like a good place to stop conversation before he got ahead of himself and tried to pry the answer out of Castiel. He was a bit exhausted anyway, some rest seemed like a good idea.
"Sammy, hey- Listen I need to tell you something and you need to not freak out, okay?" He says quickly before Sam gets into one of his Stanford rants, which Dean usually loved, but today he needed to talk.
Dean walks in through the regular hospital entrance, going to the front desk. "Hello, ma'am, I was referred here by a Dr. Tacer? I have a note." He says and hands the page to the woman behind the desk.
”Yes, please, yes. Thank you” Dean says, repeating the words against his mouth and Castiel hugs him close.
Castiel looks up from some book Dean thought was boring to smile and move over to the end of Dean's bed. "Fine, but we both know I'm going to beat you, Winchester." He teases and Dean giggles, trying to ignore the dull wince of pain he got from it.
Dean snorts "Who are you? Dr. Phil?" He grins slightly and watches as Castiel tilts his head in a questionable manner.
Dean can see the facial expressions Castiel makes as he thrusts shallowly into Dean, being gentle and careful for the time being. Dean can see Castiel's fingers flex as they keep their tight grip in his hair, the quick rise and fall of Castiel's chiseled chest as he pants and moans, which makes Dean shudder down to the bone. He ca see the marks that Castiel left along his shoulder and he realizes that he likes the mouth shaped bruise on his shoulder. He didn't notice that he didn't even think about the freckles crossing his skin, he just saw how Castiel treated him. Like he was enough.
of Castiel, the sounds between them were very dirty. Dean could hear Cas groaning behind him, he could hear himself moaning, and he could hear the sounds of Cas' hips pressing against Dean as he sped up. Dean was trembling because he knew he wasn't going to hold out for much longer and he could tell that Castiel knew it too because Castiel was going faster now, moving his lips to the side of Dean's neck, sucking and licking his skin, enough to leave some lasting marks.
Dean giggles as Castiel makes a ‘blegh!’ Sound, grinning as he watches him recompose himself. “Okay I guess not, good thing I’m wearing my swim suit! Ha! Suck it ocean!” He yells at the wind before turning back to the camera.
"Dean Winchester, hello, I'm Dr. Tacer. Tell me, what seems to be the issue?" He says after sitting at the desk.
"And I'll be okay without you." He whispers weakly, giving another shaky smile, "It's okay, you can go." He says with a soft smile and soft eyes towards his brother.
Castiel pulls away with a smile before sitting up, looking at his phone which he had pulled out of his pocket. "My Uber is here, I'll see you soon, okay?" He says as he runs a hand through Dean's hair and grins brighter as Dean purrs against the touch.
By the time that Castiel had actually pulled his tongue out and his mouth away, Dean was a shaking and needy mess. Castiel runs his hand up Dean's back to grab a light hold of his hair as his other hand shifts around and then Dean hears a buckle. "I'm going to fuck you now, Dean, would you like that? I'm going to screw you so hard that you'll forget how to function, then, I'm going to make your ass as red as I can so you can't sit properly for weeks." He murmurs in Dean's ear and Dean practically cries tears of need.
Dean and Castiel deal with the kiss and Dean finds out some news about Castiel and deals with it well, but he doesn’t deal with his emotions the way he should.
"I'm so proud of you, angel! Now you can make dinner!" He laughs, but it sounded like it was falling apart a bit, though he clears his throat, like it was just a bit dry, his throat did feel dry and tight.
"I would tell you what I have, but I assume you heard over the phone and there's not much more to say about it." He says softly.
Dean smiles into the kiss with a happy sound, moving closer before feeling a tug at his oxygen tube. “Careful,” he says softly to Cas, moving to readjust it.
Castiel's hands slid along his thighs, keeping his gaze on Dean's face, watching his reactions as he slowly licks along his length, he happily listens to the hitched breath Dean gives. He gives alight smile, not wasting time and taking him into his mouth, all the way. Having no gag reflex had finally come in handy for the angel. Dean's sounds got louder, moaning and squirming against the bedding. Castiel pulled off for a moment, stroking him gently so he stayed stimulated. "You should be very proud of this
”Ready for a drive? Cas and I were going to head up to see Mom and Dad, you and Eileen should come. Make it a whole family dinner, but Cas gets shotgun.” He says with a small smirk.
" Castiel speaks gently through the phone and Dean lets out a relieved sigh, allowing a light smile play over his lips.
"Did your brother just ditch you for candy?-I-thanks." He says softly as Cas tosses the second burger towards him.
Castiel's gaze lifted to look at Dean to see if he was joking, but Dean showed no sign of teasing or lies. Gabriel laughed and made a soft 'awwing' sound. "Well aren't you two just buckets of goo for each other." Gabriel taunts with a cheeky smile as Castiel nudges his brother in slight annoyance.
He didn't know why he was just standing there, he had the ability to open the door, but he didn't. He held his breath. He didn't know what to expect.
That thought didn't exit his brain as he's shown a room with two beds and a curtain between the two, but it was opened. There was a male in one of the beds and he looked like he had been there for awhile since there were pictures and what looked like personal items around him. He's told to get into bed, then they give him an IV and one of those oxygen tubes that rest just below his nose. He was spaced out, dead silent as he goes from a lot of attention to none. Then it's quiet besides the monitors and machines around him and the other male.
But Castiel beat him to the punch. “Dean? Are you awake?” He asks, Dean nods before realizing Castiel probably couldn’t see him.
"I never got to say it earlier..." Dean murmurs to Cas and Castiel tilts his head to look into Dean's sleepy gaze.
Castiel gave him a smile, this ride meant a lot more to Dean than he was letting on. He gentle takes Dean’s hand and then holds up something in his other.
Straight to the point then. "Uh-I've noticed that my breathin' ain't what it used to be. It's um- harder to take breaths in. Been losin' some weight rapidly, I guess. And-uh I'm just real sore lately." He says, uncomfortable as he watches the doctor write down everything he said.
Dean gives a wide smile, holding Cas’ hand. Needing to touch him somehow. He nods with a giggle. “I watched them all, you’re so cute.” He says.
“I have a question, Cas,” he murmurs gently, leaning into every touch Cas would give him, and Castiel was giving him everything.
Castiel nods again and gives a smile. Almost seeming embarrassed. "I don't that reference, but I am not good with understanding  many pop culture things." He says honestly and Dean can respect that.
"Well, my immune system isn't as strong as the normal person's so when I got sick with it, because I was around a lot of fumes... It hit me a bit harder and it shut my body down, so I had to come to the hospital. It was a bit of a process because they didn't want to release me too early and have something else enter my system while I was already compromised." He explains, calm and happy.
”I’m okay, sorry the water just hypnotized me.” He says and squeezes Cas’ hand, which was now against Dean’s.
Eventually the vehicle slows to a stop and Dean feels Castiel's hand gently on his thigh. "I'm going to get out of the car and then I'll get you, okay? Keep the blindfold on." Castiel says and kisses his cheek before the door is opened and there's some shifting.
“I can turn the tv on for you and then after that you should shower.” She chimes with a playful scrunched face to act like he stunk, then switches the screen on.
Dean felt the affects of the orgasm quickly, his head practically spinning from how hard he finished and his body started to slump slightly more into the pillows until he remembered that Castiel was still pounding into him and he could feel Cas' hips stutter and soon enough he was hitting his orgasm. Dean practically sobs in pleasure, even if this wasn't 100% real, sure felt amazing.
"Castiel, I-What- Do you know what's happening?" Dean's voice had went up in pitch from his embarrassment.
”I have Eileen here, but I- wanted to make sure you know- you were just as important to him as his family was.” Sam murmurs, voice soft.
Sam seemed to realize what was going on, because he was doing the exact same thing. “We couldn’t have done anything.” He says and Castiel nods, not wanting to say anymore.
Dean's eyes were shut, tight; refusing to open them for emotional reasons and the fact, he was terrified if he opened them, Castiel would leave because he had too much damn baggage. Dean wouldn't blame Castiel though, he'd blame himself for being a little bitch about everything. Instead, he feels Cas' hand gently hold his jaw. "Dean," He whispers softly, sounding just as heartbroken as Dean felt.
That hope was crushed when the doctor nods. "I actually think that driving wouldn't be a smart idea for you right now, but you seem like the stubborn type so please- head straight there." Dr. Tacer says and hands Dean the note in the scribbled jumble of words that was only read among people in the medical field.
Dean nods, Cas’ surprises hadn’t let him down just yet. “Let’s do that-“ he replies, aollowing Castiel to lead him to a patch of sand and pulling a towel out of nowhere.
"Go lay on the bed, I'm going to go into the small room on the other side of the glass and when I speak to you through the microphone, please do as I instruct so we can have accurate x-rays." Dr. Jackie says with a sweet smile as Dean takes his shoes off and goes to lie on the almost plastic feeling cot.
“This is Baby, my 1967 Chevrolet Impala.” He says, rubbing his free hand along the vehicle’s slick black frame.
Blinking tiredly, he squints his eyes open at her. She was smiling brightly and seemed very bouncy. Holding a bag and a.
”He’s always proud of you, Sam,” Eileen says and Sam smiles, eyes still teary as he leans to give her a kiss.
There's a machine that moves over him, but stays a not terrible distance. At least 5 inches from his body. There's a few whirring sounds and clicks, like you would hear from a camera and then it's done. It's quiet for a bit and then the doctor is in the room, helping him sit up and handing his clothes back. "Mr. Winchester, I have some unfortunate news. You have something called Pulmonary Fibrosis. It's a lung disease which is what is causing your struggle to breathe. Your other issues are symptoms of what you have and it's been spreading for a long time." She murmurs to him, looking very sad.
Dean was currently watching Doctor Sexy on the tv hanging off the wall. Entranced by the way the doctor seemed to know exactly what he was doing whether it was surgically healing someone or screwing someone in the elevator.
Castiel stares hard at the car. He knew this car had value to Dean. More than just dollar signs. He glances at Dean who is already looking at him to see his reaction. Castiel smiles sweetly towards him. “She’s lovely, Dean.” He says, honest.
Castiel listens, as best as he could. He could feel Sam’s pain and loss as much as his own. They both lost someone important to them.
”Castiel lick ass Novak-“ Dean whispers in response and he can feel Castiel’s laugh rumble through him.
Dean had been his as much as Castiel was Dean’s. This wasn’t the ending he wanted for them, he wanted them to grow old in a little cabin, maybe adopting, maybe not. He wanted to show Dean how to plant flowers properly and he wanted Dean to show him his love for Western movies. He wanted that. He still wants that. But that wasn’t the plan. Their ending was good, even if it wasn’t the ending he wanted.
"Dean... It's been spreading and building for a year and a half, maybe more. There's nothing that exists that can stop it." Dr. Jackie says, putting a gloved hand softly on his shoulder.
”Dean, I seriously need you to send me a text or call me back to let me know that you’re okay, I’m starting to get- I feel like something’s wrong, please, just...” Cas trails off, his gaze on the being in front of him.
"I wonder what would happen if maybe we had a conversation about us." Castiel says softly against Dean's lips.
Castiel smiles before moving away from the bed. “I should start packing my things.” He says gently with a smile.
He stares at Castiel as he pulls out a little camcorder. "It's fully charged and there's a lot of embarrassing stuff about me on it, but- It'll give you some more insight on me until I can share all my life moments with you on our first date," He says, almost shy.
”Don’t worry, Dean, I won’t be leaving anytime soon. I want to say I died for you, but in reality, I lived for you, Dean. I wanted to breathe for you, You were my reason. You were my home.” He says gently against his lips.
He opened the screen door and walked in, the actual door already opened and pressed against the light grey wall lined with dark wood frames. He takes quiet steps to the kitchen. Dean thought quietly to himself that he should’ve been on guard and ready to fight, but he felt safe. He felt okay. His steps paused in the entrance of the pristine room, sparkling in the sunlight coming through the window above the sink.
"I want you to see yourself, I want to see how well you react to what's going to be happening. How amazing you look when you're so vulnerable and perfect for me. A perfect and good boy." Castiel says, watching as Dean shudders at what he says.
”Sam- slow down. Yes, it’s him- Castiel. And I’m bisexual. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you before-“ He’s cut off.
Sam pauses for a moment, seeming to notice Dean’s mind was somewhat elsewhere. “Hey, what’s going on?” He says, nudging Dean’s arm.
"Yeah, right with me. Since when do doctors ever show up on time." He grumbles to himself, looking around the room to study the posters boredly while he awaited the doctor to show up.
Castiel was sitting on his couch, thumbnail between his teeth, biting. A habit he had developed when something was grinding in his brain. Worry.
"Let's get a move on, little bro! Don't question the suit, I don't need your sickly contagious germs all over me!" He says as he walks closer to Cas.
Cas: I will be coming to visit soon, but I have something much better than pudding. And it’s not pie either.
Dean starts to rumbling engine of Baby and presses down on the gas as he starts to drive. ‘Stairway To Heaven’ starts playing through the speakers and Dean smiles as he drives along the roads.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek and tilts his head to the side. "It went good, I got rid of the werewolves." He says with a gentle chuckle "I know Sam would've laughed at how they were vegans during human form." He replies, hearing Castiel laugh through the speaker.
Dean gives a wavering smile, lips quivering with his own tears as he swallows, taking a short breath in as his grip weakens on Sam. "I love you, Sammy," He murmurs as his body slumps more into Sam and Sam holds him tighter to his chest.
" He whispers to himself, clutching his phone tightly in his clammy hand, his eyes squeezed tightly, holding his breath.
Dean nods slowly in consent and Castiel moves Dean to face the mirror, on his hands and knees, watching as Dean's cheeks flame a red as Castiel moves behind him and pushes into him gently, leaning slightly over him. Castiel's chest to Dean's back. Castiel watches as Dean does a full body shudder when he's bottomed out, he was listening to the soft voice crack Dean had when he said Castiel's name. Castiel couldn't leave the needy Winchester unsatisfied or waiting for too long, so he starts to move out of him and back in. Dean's back arched more when he did it and he goes to bury his face into his arms and the blankets, which Castiel stops with a grip in his hair, tugging until Dean's eyes meet his through the mirror.
"I should go, signing off." Castiel murmurs at the camera before the video ends again and Dean finds himself a little happier with a little extra energy to get out of bed.
Hearing footsteps, he turns to see Eileen and gives her a smile as a greeting, still purring and leaning into Cas’ touches.
Dean giggles softly and turns to fully face him again, glancing at his lips shyly. Castiel smiles, noticing his gaze and gently pressing his lips to Dean’s again.
By the time they had finished playing 21 questions, they had asked more than 21 questions, but now knew a solid amount of information about each other.
Dean stood, leaning against the wooden ledge with Castiel beside him. He felt Castiel’s gentle hand in his hair, brushing through it with gentle strokes that caused a purring sound in the back of Dean’s throat.
"Cas-I'm- Ima-gonna-" Dean couldn't get his thoughts out, but Castiel knew what he was saying and smiled against his skin.
"You're not funny, Dean. I don't want you to die. You're my family." He says, voice cracking a bit in sadness and Dean couldn't help but react to his sad tone, eyes watering.
He takes a moment to look at how little belongings Dean has. Sure, he has weapons, a few lore books, but nothing is really 'Dean'. A few photos on the nightstand of Team Free Will makes Castiel smile, the empty and spilt bottles of liquor do not. He doesn't bring them up right now, that would be the opposite of what Castiel wants to do to help Dean. Instead, he looks at Dean, smiling. "Lay on your back on your bed, Dean." He demands softly, the green eyed male listens quickly.
Dean gives him a slightly pained smile and squeezes Sam's arm a bit tighter with the most of his last energy. "You can do this, Sam. You're strong, you're a hell of a lot stronger than I've ever been. That's why I know you can do this. Okay?" Dean's face turns serious, but his eyes remain gentle "You can do this." He repeats.
”We’ve barely been a thing and you’re already too good for me.” Dean chimes and blushes darker as he watches Castiel lift an eyebrow.
I would just like to say, that once again I’m not an expert on the illnesses that these characters have, but I have put in enough research to know that what I’m writing isn’t unrealistic. I don’t mind constructive criticism, but I’d rather not take critique to how I display the illnesses I’m writing about. Thank you for understand and reading.
Dean pouts and then giggles a bit at Castiel who kept pecking his frowning mouth. “Okay okay,” he gives in, playfully  exasperated.
Dean keeps his head tilted up to look at the moon and the stars, watching his vision darken, his throat tight, air wasn’t as available, his limbs started to grow heavy and he saw the shadow of a reaper looming over him.
His hand was shaking, phone screen still bright. His breathing was cut short with every attempt of a gasp he could get.
Foggy memories appear at the front of his brain as he rubs his eyes. Cas was gone and the sound of only one heart monitor showed that. Looking at his lap to calm himself down, he sees the camcorder placed along the blankets. Glancing around, Dean decided that he could watch another video because no one was there to entertain him or stop him.
“Shhh!” A voice rang out from behind the bar area causing Dean to stop in his tracks, his head snapping toward the sound. Dean bellowed at the faceless intruder.
feet in the sand somewhere, right?” he shrugged. “So, why the shitty version? Me, dead, you, all powered down, sitting in a car avoiding my old man?” Cas swallowed, avoiding Dean's eyes.
“My name is Castiel. I am an angel of the lord, I like long walks along the beach, world peace, and insects”. He imitated in a clipped voice. Castiel wiggled the Duck on the ground. He chuckled.
The next two weeks passed in a relatively similar pattern. Dean would wake up late, grab a coffee, and head to Jack’s room where the toddler would be already up and playing with Castiel while Rebecca watched from over in the corner, making notes in her a4 book. Kelly would join them at around midday, at roughly the same time, Azrael would appear with the first letter of the day from Sam, and Dean would switch from coffee to beer or whiskey. The angel therapist shift change happened and everyone would get involved in whatever creative task Penemue would conjure up. Dean would leave at around five pm to start cooking, and an hour later the five of them would sit and eat a meal together. Penny and Kelly would then leave and Cas or Dean would read Jack a bedtime story while the other washed the dishes. The two would finally meet in Dean’s bedroom, fool around a bit, and fall asleep, ready to do it all over again the next day.
Dean's chest pain had gone. He knew that should have been worrying to him, but it wasn't; It was nice. He couldn’t feel much of anything anymore, only a faint tingle in his wrist where his brother clutched him tightly, trying to keep him alive with the force at which he held him.
“Dean, relax”, Castiel finally grumbled from the passenger seat, he slammed his hand against the dashboard, bracing himself against the sudden force at which Dean hit the brakes. Dean shot him a look.
"Do you miss it... your grace?" Jack asked while adjusting the cool air towards both his face and Castiel's. Castiel considered his query.
rebelling heaven.” He teased, “I do wish I could have seen the show. I wonder if my being there would have convinced them of your true identity.”
“Yeah, fine, but I’m still pissed at you for even asking me that”. Dean placed the now dry blanket (thank you, Heaven) back over his torso and cuddled up against Castiel’s chest, nuzzling himself into his slot between Cas’s neck and the pillow. “Remind me to tell you about that case Sam and I worked when we ganked Calliope at that school, in the morning.”
He pictured Sam walking around the bunker alone until he couldn’t do it any longer; until he decided to stop spending his time around ghosts. Dean drove through the wilderness, big cypress trees rose up on either side of the road as he tried his hardest to imagine a life where his brother would be happy.
“Jack”, Cas looked back up at him blinking through his tears. “Are you really God?” Jack smiled and sniffed.
“I said I didn’t mean it like that…” a smile reappeared on his face “I say a lot of things,” he repeated.
He remembered his seventeen birthday; his first-ever solo hunt, the two lesbian nuns, the way his dad never brought it up again, he didn’t even send him on a job again until years later, like he was trying to make a point; as if Dean didn't already know that there was something biblically wrong with him. He didn't even know how John knew. He guessed he had been too sensitive, too emotional. There was no way John knew about the way Dean was drumming up the funds. No way John could have possibly known that over time Dean had figured out that he could find peace, instead of self-pity, during the act. No way in hell John could have had any idea that Dean had managed to have learned how to enjoy it. Dean figured there must have been something else, some way John could see it, like many others throughout Dean's life had seemed to, like it was somehow branded deep into his soul; a flashing light upon his forehead reading slurs every time he had an improper thought.
“I-- I can’t,” Castiel mumbled, he looked down at the memory version of himself, an insufferable past echo of the man he was; his flawed, self-righteous attempt at seizing power for the good of heaven. He knew he was not in any position to take on that level of responsibility.
Deanna hadn't seen Sam in almost three years and looking at her now, she could see just how much time had passed. Sam's hair had grown down to her ribs and she appeared to have had a second growth spurt. The last time Deanna had seen her, Sam had still been her
“Dean?” Sam called into the seemingly empty garage. Dean placed his hand over his nose trying to quiet his snickers. Sam spun around to look behind him and Dean grinned gleefully, knowing he was most likely caught out, while he dashed madly to the side trying to run to get behind his brother again. Sam scoffed, a confused smile rose upon his face, “What the hell are you doing?” Dean chuckled, threw his head back and his arms up in defeat, before groaning playfully at being detected.
I’d be doing that?”, Her brows furrowed. She knew something was up, the way she looked at him, she could tell it was something big.
“Because I’m in love with you too, Dean,” Cas stated simply in a monotone voice, as if he could have been talking about something as mundane as the weather. After a long pause of silence, Cas began to chuckle at Dean’s gaping mouth. The angel had known the man beside him for over a decade and the stoic yet shocked mask he wore was one he had rarely seen upon the man's face. He continued, hoping to calm the evident internal crisis Dean seemed to be having. “Dean, you too have been made to feel that feelings are wrong and yet everyone has them." Dean blinked in response, his jaw clenching as he truly took in Cas's words. The angel laughed. A sound caused Dean to feel like he'd just touched a live wire. "We're not hurting anyone, not really, so why are we like this? Why did we wait until death to admit this to one another, if not for fear of looking foolish? Now we look foolish!” He shook his head, “I was so wrapped up in trying to be the angel my father wanted me to be and then, well, Chuck was the greatest disappointment in all creation so… what I’m trying to say... is that… you became my religion a long time ago, Dean.”
fine with pretending you’re more than just some ignorant little parasite that has somehow managed to Gaslight Cas into believing he needs you around”. Penny turned to walk back toward room twenty-two but Dean shot his arm out, quickly stopping the angel by grabbing at his shoulder.
“And yet, I don’t recall anybody asking you to do it?” Cas commented under his breath before sucking in air through his teeth in pain. “Ow! Jack, gentle.” Jack fumbled backward up toward Castiel's knee and bent down to kiss the general area of the hair he’d just pulled back into a ponytail.
“No,” Sam replied, logically, almost seeming disappointed that Dean would even suggest such a ludicrous idea. Dean knew he was being stupid but at this point, he no longer cared. He honestly couldn’t explain it, even to himself, but the concept of not being able to ever use a single ninja star on a case was now filling him with such an intense and unstoppable distress that he childishly couldn’t help but to keep pushing.
quite a cute notion, Cas, but no. You aren’t dead. I imagine you’re in a great deal of pain, yes? When, tell me, was the last time you heard of any soul having pain in Heaven?” Cas considered this for a moment and noticed his chest felt lighter. Another vesseled angel suddenly entered Cas’s bedroom, this time, however, without knocking, without even using the door.
Dean paused. He stared at the ground unable to move. The only thought he could muster was. No. No, he couldn't move because if he moved then he would have to leave. No, he couldn't leave. No, he wasn't going to go back to the bunker alone where there are too many ghosts. No, he wasn't going to throw another tantrum. He gritted his teeth and set his jaw. No. and sat back down. He considered that his dad, the great John Winchester would remark that even this was a tantrum in itself but Dean chose to ignore his dad's ever-present voice in his head. In fact, the longer Dean sat there clutching the objects tightly in his arms, the longer his anger redirected from himself onto his father. He'd always known the man had a strange effect on the boys but even now sitting there seething in the middle of nowhere waiting for God, he was reminded of times he'd waited around for his dad. His dad who he idolized the majority of his life despite the fact that in his father's eyes he was seen as little more than a mouthy soldier. His dad, who claimed to value family so damn much that he uprooted their whole lives for their mom's vengeance, and yet somehow was able to spawn a random brother that he and Sam never got the chance to really get to know. His damned holier-than-thou dad who dictated every inch of his life growing up that Dean never even considered he was worthy of-
The back of Dean's head was hidden in Cas’s armpit. Castiel's arm lay atop Dean’s, his hand slotted between Dean’s hand and the bed. Dean breathed in deeply, closing his eyes again, relaxing into the soft memory foam of his bed, a small smile on his face as he started to drift off again.
“That’s my mom and dad,” Jack explained to Dean, “and this is my other dad, and my other, other, dad.” He handed Castiel a fire truck and a rubber duck. “And this is me!” He grabbed a yellow beanie baby and plopped himself down, his diaper meeting the grass.
Cas returns the kiss like he's been drowning for ages and can finally breathe again. The electricity Dean felt when their foreheads touched is dialed up to a hundred where their lips are sliding against each other, like tiny little fireworks exploding against his skin. Despite the surreal feeling of kissing the man he's been in love with for ages, it also feels like home. Cas tastes like ginger and honey, and that cherry chapstick Dean bought for him at the grocery store.
Defeated, exhausted, and very hungry, he decides to go to the coffee shop two blocks away from campus. That way, he'll at least have a full tummy. One less worry. He orders some coffee and freshly baked pastries that he eyes in the display, and waits for his order on his usual table by the window. He opens his laptop and browses through some folders where he saves pics for inspiration, but it doesn't help in the slightest.
So, every time Dean says something wrong, he feels like a teenager with an embarrassing crush, mulling over his own words, regretting them even years after having said them. It's like an endless cycle of self-loathing, which he's an expert on.
Sometimes it's not even his long, big speeches that have the most meaning behind them, but the little sarcastic quips here and there, or the small, quiet sentences spoken in moments of uncertainty. Those are the ones that rewrite themselves in his heart, like lines of a poem carved in stone.
There's always something, and yet that something never seems to be the words that have been lodged in his throat all through the past decade.
Dean might not be tidy, or stick to a calendar, or function methodically, but when he gets random bursts of inspiration, they're entirely worth it. Once, he was able to paint about 5 pieces just from an ordinary raindrop he happened to see one sunday afternoon, because his brain just works in mysterious ways when it comes to creativity.
Because Dean has no self-control, he scoots closer to the former angel and stares. His eyes trace the slope of his nose and the curve of his eyelashes, and the way his jawline is pointing upwards. He suddenly gets the urge to trace it with his fingers, to feel the stubble growing there. A wave of longing hits him like it's done a thousand times before, and he does nothing to stop it.
"Maybe you could, um, stay here. Y'know, to help with your sleeping problems. A different mattress might, um. It might help."
If Dean Winchester has a prominent talent, it is, without a doubt, painting. He just has this slight problem when it comes to
After a beat of silence, Castiel offers to buy him a new coffee. Dean insists it was all his fault, but the man is stubborn, so they end up sitting together and splitting Dean's pastries.
Cas walks in, wearing a pair of Dean's plaid pajama pants and a Zepp t-shirt. He's holding two steaming mugs that carry the smell of ginger, and his hair is all over the place.
"Shit!" he hisses, trying to unstick his t-shirt to avoid burning himself further. He seriously considers giving up his career and his life to go backpacking through Europe and never return.
"At the crack of dawn? Sounds like someone's got a bad case of insomnia." He says it like it's a joke, but he's worried. Again, not good with words.
For the first time in weeks, Dean feels light and relaxed. He takes off his coffee-stained shirt, and nearly thanks himself for being so clumsy. Turns out that was the best thing that could have ever happened.
"That sounds nice, Dean. I'd love to come by. Maybe tomorrow?" That has Dean's head jerking up, and sure enough, Cas isn't joking. He looks –excited.
They break the kiss to take air, but their foreheads stay in place, aligned with each other perfectly. Cas smiles, and it's nearly blinding.
Two days later, he has three full pieces in Mrs. Jones' classroom, all made out of coffee spills and a hint of one particular blue color that he hopes to see every day for the rest of his life.
"Oh, uh. Thanks, I'll have that in mind." Seemingly waking up from its slumber, his brain catches on in the scene. "I'm Dean, by the way. Dean Winchester." He holds out his hand, which is immediately greeted by the stranger's. It's warm and soft, with a few callouses.
Then, there's a steadying hand posed on his elbow, accompanied by a deep, raspy voice, that has him looking up from the disaster going on on his chest.
"Yeah. It's not exactly an economically rewarding career, but I quite like writing." Castiel (or, well,
Holding the weight of his regrets, Dean lays back on his memory foam mattress and stares at the ceiling. He pictures Cas' eyes from memory. The way they droop when he's tired, and sparkle when he's curious. The way they squint when he's angry or thoughtful, almost cartoonish.
When he's called back to the counter and retrieves his hot coffee, he's still drilling down on his brain, hopeful for any hint of an idea. And as if his day wasn't already going downhill, he bumps into someone, spilling the coffee on himself.
than usual, and he has to admit, he's getting a little desperate. He had an assessment due three weeks ago, and he hasn't been able to come up with anything. His teacher, Mrs. Jones, normally gives him a one to two week frame to deliver his homework, because she knows by now that rushing him will just end in disaster. But even by that standard, he's a week overdue by now, and he's getting worried.
"Castiel. Nice to meet you." If Dean thought this guy was beautiful before, the smile he gives him then makes him even more of a sight. Dean lets his hand linger for a little too long, but Castiel doesn't seem to care.
Dean's brain stopped working the minute Cas sat on his bed, but the rest of his body doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. It's moving on its own, and a second later, his forehead is touching Cas'. He feels electricity run through it, like his skin is made of lightning. If Cas weren't human now, Dean wouldn't dismiss that possibility.
Dean's not good with words. Never has been. Sometimes when he was a kid, he'd spend days without talking. By now, he's figured he just has to show instead of tell, otherwise he'll send every relationship he has flying off a cliff simply because he doesn't know how to say what he's thinking.
"Jesse." He stated, hesitantly grasping the blonde girl's hand, "Uh, I didn't know Sam had a sister." The two of them stared down at Sam, whose own eyes trained up at Jesse, silently pleading for his understanding.
“Of course”, He nodded, narrowing his eyes. “How are you finding it this time; the new and improved Cosmic Siesta Condominium?” He asked, dramatically flicking his hair off his shoulder. Dean smirked.
“Castiel.” He looked up to find Dagon standing over him. Their form flashing between that of the Asain woman they had possessed and their yellow-toned true form of a man with long hair, a beard, and the tail of a fish. Dagon pulled Castiel up one-handed, by his neck. “I’m going to enjoy getting back at you for my death”, They smiled, as their other hand dragged, backhanded, gently down the side of his face. Quite suddenly, however, fear and confusion flitted across their face as a blade appeared through their chest, burning the essence of their spiritual form in a flash of electricity.
in here too, by the way, good ol’ Johnny Boy. He’s telling me all sorts of fun little family secrets. Seems that not only did you take up an appetite to the way I taught you to carve up the riff-raff, but you clearly got one hell of a kick outta me popping your rosebud.” He sighed his smile just a touch wider than John's, his eyes disgustingly empty.
“Since about seven o'clock. Kelly headed home pretty much straight after that. Jack made you this in art therapy” Penemue replied, handing Cas a piece of paper. He smiled down and the image, curiosity caused Dean to groan slightly as he rose out of his chair again, and walked over to Cas, peering over his shoulder at the image. The drawing was done in crayon of a small brickwork house, crass in detail but rich in talent. The building was shaped like a rectangle with a triangle for a roof, it was colored in red and orange bricks, with a yellow door and blue windows. The house sat atop a green hill, and spilling out of each of the two windows, and into the sky, were two large black outlines of, many-eyed, many winged monsters that smiled at each other.
“Woahhhh” Dean bellowed at the impact. He bent down, placing his thumbs under Jack's armpits, and groaned dramatically as he lifted the kid and placed him against his hip.
“Howdy, everyone! I brought y’all popcorn.” He peeped. Dean did a double-take, realizing that Cas’s mouth wavered as he attempted to hold his laughter in.
“Exactly my point, you’ve given up”. Crowly stated and shrugged before downing a mouthful of his beer. Dean's hand gripped tighter around the rim of his glass.
Dean was waisted. The sun had set long ago. Jack and Kelly had left pretty much straight after the march ended and Penny and Simon weren't far behind. Mrs. Middleton left after that, whereas, Charlie joined Cas and Dean out to some club's after-party that she insisted they all should visit, on account of her "party" scoring free drinks. At some point, Charlie had left with a bubbly blonde girl while Dean and Cas stayed. Castiel mainly sat talking to various different people. The angel seemed content to simply watch Dean, admiring him as he was, completely immersed, in his element.
“What, dude. Look at me! I look like a fuckin’ truck driver”. She kicked her leg out and the large dark blue jeans fell down from where they had been placed, scuffing the floorboards.
Dean flipped the page back and reread the letter. He sighed again and spared a glance to the angels behind him. Cas had seemed to manage to convince Jack to give him some space. He now sat with his hair still mangled and his face still bedazzled, grinning at the chaos that was being unabashedly unleashed onto Azrael's hair. Dean shook his head.
“I mean, I just assumed it was a rumor, like the Illuminati... but I guess they’re more like the Newmasons.” Sam’s eyes lit up in wonder.
“Fine.” He yelled angry at first then, backing away from Castiel and shaking his head he continued, softer this time. “I’ll find another way and I’ll be back for you. Just… don’t add this to the list of memories you regret, okay?” Jack’s voice was barely a whisper as he tried to keep himself from sobbing. Castiel fell back to the floor, shaking. “I promise I’m not gonna let you stay here, okay? I have Amara on my side now and together we’re gonna fix everything, I... just have to save Sam first.”
The walls began to melt into a wave of black goo transforming the scene inside Castiel's head into yet another memory.
Dean woke stiff and sore, his legs crammed up against his torso. The streetlight peering down through the opened window helped him put together enough of the night before. He'd fallen asleep on the couch. At some point, beer had turned to whisky which was also roughly around the time that the conversation had turned to retelling stories of old hunts. Eileen had been a good sport, Dean noted, pretending that she was interested in hearing about the time Dean had rapidly aged from messing with a witch in a poker game and the time Sam body-swapped with a gawky teenager.
“Unless you need anything”. Penemue addressed Cas, then unmistakably, glanced at Dean again. Dean rolled his eyes and trudged back over to stand by his seat, lifting his beer to his mouth.
“No need? Are you sure?” Dean rolled his eyes and bumped his head and shoulder against Cas from where the angel peered up at him, “I mean I figure there may be some need… is that not the whole point...”
“I told you at the time that the--” John turned to Dean and cleared his throat before turning back toward Mary.
“Yes. I’m fine, Jack, How are you here?!” He asked again, a little urgency rising in his voice as the danger of his reality set in.
“You’ll have less of a chance of that happening if I’m there with you!” Deanna clenched her jaw and looked at the sky.
"They're still there," Jack explained. "They're just asleep now. They have no power over that realm anymore". Dean shook his head. He'd have to just accept what Jack was saying. It was a lot to take in and he resolved to have to table all of the new information he'd learned, hoping that maybe Jack was right and everything would remain stable...
“Yeah, me too,” Dean replied, raising his brows and throwing his drink back. “I was pretty tempted to enforce The Men of Letters Code for you once we figured out that Ketch had done you in.” Mick glanced behind them into the crowd to where Ketch sat talking to Mary and John, “But, turns out the Asshat actually proved useful and got onboard Team Free Will. So-- I guess--”
“You, uh-- You happy with everything?” Dean asked, pushing the fries aside in his mouth, then amended his question, “Heaven, I mean.” Simon squinted at him through his glasses.
“I’m pretty sure I was just voted in as a regent to Jack.” Dean downed the remainder of his beer and dramatically jumped up from his chair at the same time as setting his empty bottle down on the map table. He stood over Cas, looking down on him from above. Cas stared up at him, the inside edges of his brows raised and his mouth pulled together in a line of uncertainty.
The glittery pen broke through the paper and ripped a small cut down where the comma was. Dean looked around erratically for a flat surface to write on and had decided on a wall when Rebbecca handed him her clipboard.
“Anyway,” John cleared his throat again. “You should really be getting out of the house, Dean. The kid I remember would always be getting into trouble, bringing this girl and that back to the hotel. It’s a shame that you’re here so soon, and I’d hate to think that you’re not even enjoying yourself.” Mary shook her head ever so slightly and eyed the menu in front of her.
“Is it working?” he asked, although he could feel the lack of it doing so, and therefore knew the answer to his own query.
party”, she raised her hand and twirled her finger in a circle “--and I’m sure if I asked, they'd all agree with me, that nobody wants your bad vibes stinking up the place”. Dean lifted his hands in surrender. “...So, you were saying?”
“Nothing weird coming over the wire, social media looks clean. You got anything?” Sam tore his eyes off his laptop screen after receiving no response, “Dean?”
He thought of Cas in purgatory, his hand slipping out of Dean's grip somehow, despite how desperately, how tightly Dean gripped him.
“Come on, man. I’m trying to unload here and you’re choosing now to button up?” He handed the bottle back to him.
Cas sat stiffly at the kitchen table, watching silently as Dean filled the pot with water and poured the ground coffee into the filter. The room filled with the smell of the heating beans. Dean turned toward Castiel abruptly.
"Can't do what?" Castiel asked after a moment, in an attempt to pull Dean back out of his head. Dean sighed and rubbed his hand across his mouth. He nodded as he felt a drawbridge lower in his mind. One second was all he needed and he could always pick up the pieces after.
“Burgers sound great mom, text me the address,” Dean replied, throwing Mary a quick smile and ducking through the crowd and out the door.
“He seems to have found a renewed devotion for our family since making it out of the Empty.” Dean nodded. “Then there's Joshua, again, an understandable choice considering his popularity among the more traditional voters. Then Balthazar, and me.” Castiel stated quickly, looking somewhere between embarrassed and humble.
“I don’t mean some kid that you co-babysit every now and again, Dean. I mean a proper family. You can’t even see the difference, can you? The shit you kids have gone through; the path that I started you on? If anyone should get the wife and two point five kids, it's you boys. It breaks my heart to see you here, on such high alert that you can’t even seem to manage to cut ties with any of heaven's bitch boys.”
"Em--Emma?!" Dean rushed towards her without a second thought. Alistair appeared at his side, John’s hot breath on his neck.
“I’m guessing that’s a good thing?” Deanna asked, following Sam’s line of sight out into the sea of unrecognizable bodies.
“I remember everything from before, Dean. I just wanted to say thank you.” John looked at him sternly. Dean’s mouth fell open slightly as he racked his brain for what he could have possibly done to warrant such a positive reaction from his dad. “I know I was never in the running for father of the year... and looking back on it, I know I could have gone easier on you kids.” John sighed, “What you did for me, reuniting your mother and me like that, I don’t think I’d have done the same thing if I were in your shoes.” Dean was able to close his mouth now. He raised his brows and stared at John for a moment, struggling desperately to find a nice way to explain that he definitely knows that his dad wouldn’t have done the same for him. As time ticked by, however, he decided a simple nod and slap on his dad's arm would have to say enough.
“I didn’t know about Lucifer or the emp--” Penny flicked his hand up and Dean’s voice cut short. He’d recalled feeling this feeling before. Penny had taken his voice from him.
he supposed. The most important detail being, That this last vampire was still alive and kicking, or more accurately, alive and grabbing him and pushing him into whatever it was that was maybe gonna start to be a problem really soon, and therefore Sammy was still at risk. Suddenly, though, Sam appeared behind, what would have been, the shoulder of where the vampire would have been standing had he not just fallen to the ground, newly decapitated. The next moments passed in a blur. Dean realized before Sam did, that his weird, wrong pain was making his breathing sound kind of hairy. Sam was looking around like he always did after killing a nest; like he was shocked at how well everything turned out like he was proud of how well they’d both fought.
“Well--” he began, leaning over and opening up the glove box, “I guess you’re gonna have to just wait it out and see. Or--” he tossed a cassette at Cas, who caught it one-handed, looking at Dean questioningly, “You can tell me what
"So, we walking until we find a place, or do you have a local haunt?" She asked. Sam's eyes flicked toward the pavement.
“Did--” She closed her eyes in an attempt to control her breathing, “Jesse. You didn’t give him a hunter's send-off?” She opened her eyes, peering down at her sister, “did you?” Deanna sniffed then inhaled shakily, her mouth agape as she searched the road, trying to find her reply. Sam huffed at her sister's lack of response, a tear spilled out of her eye and down her cheek.
everyone, joining in on whatever conversations they already had going. He’d played pool with Keven as Channing watched unamused from a seat in the corner. Jo tried and failed to start up a doubles game. Channing stated she would rather watch and instead spent the whole time on her phone. Dean assumed she had a lot of dead friends because she didn’t look up very often and considering they couldn’t get service from Earth, he had no idea what she could possibly find so interesting.
"No, you really are an angel, Castiel. Not just a literal angel, a metaphorical angel. Like, by human standards!" She held her wig onto her head in one hand as she attempted to sit down in the sand without falling over, or dropping the burger Castiel had just bought her.
“Heads up,” He threw the letter to the angel and they caught it in one hand. They looked down at the ball of paper and, with another fluttering sound from their wings, they disappeared.
“Lebanon, Kansas.” She placed her phone back in her pocket as Dianna rolled her eyes and groaned, “Guess I’m driving?” Deanna nodded overenthusiastically causing a small chuckle from her sister as she lifted the box marked “Henry”.
“Thanks,” She nodded, still watching the huddled bodies on the dance floor. “So, uh, what about you? Been up to anything new lately?” Deanna brought her eyes to her sister before training her gaze down toward the table between them. She picked absentmindedly at the dirt and blood hidden behind her french manicure as she attempted to come up with a response that her sister would want to hear. Sam’s eyebrows lowered as she turned her attention back toward the woman across from her, waiting for a response to her overwhelmingly simple and casual question.
“You’re going the wrong way.” He remarked, gesturing to the front door behind her with the opened beer bottle he clutched in his hand, the liquid foaming over the lip. The third person, still hidden to Deanna by the hood of a black cloak, raised their head from their phone at their friend's voice. Deanna smiled as she approached.
“Tried. I guess he meant it when he said that crap about raindrops, huh?” Sam asked, eyeing the board. Dean stared at the bubbles in his beer, watching them rise up from nowhere, glide upwards toward the surface, and explode.
’ to figure out I’d been trying to gently test the waters on and off there for, what, twelve years?” Cas lowered his hand, turning toward Dean abruptly.
“Shh!” Sam hissed quietly, maneuvering herself so Deanna could peer around the corner. A man and woman in police uniforms were making their way up the stairs and toward them, their eyes roamed over the stairwell as they walked. Deanna pulled at Sam’s wrist and started walking down the opposite end of the hall.
"I got it". Sam said, sauntering past her sister and pushed the door up, rolling it in upon itself. The two Winchesters jumped back and flinched involuntarily, half expecting something to jump out at them if not set off some kind of booby trap that John had set up, and yet, nothing happened. In fact, the storage container looked relatively normal. Cardboard boxes of all sizes sat stacked upon each other, the majority of which were cases that had once been full of beer. Dianna turned to her sister.
“Uh, yeah, sure. Sounds great”. Dean replied, barely paying attention, trying to get out the door. He positioned himself so he could see out into the night. There was no sign of Cas anywhere that he could see. Dean wondered where in heaven Cas lived, or if he just turns into rain and leaves here like Jack supposedly does on Earth. Dean didn't notice the silence, two bottles to a hand as he pulled his button-up back on over his arms, popping the collar.
“You have been avoiding me all morning, long before this…” He sighed, “Did I do something wrong?” Cas’s voice was softer now. His eyes were wide and full of concern.
“Yeah, Son. Mary’s right.” John stood from his seat calmly. “Not all of us are fucking the help.” He shook his head slowly, his eyes closed tight as he breathed deeply. “I can’t do this Mary.” He opened his eyes and looked down at her. His expression was hard. “Dean, I--” He shook his head again. “I’m trying to stay calm here but--” he laughed humorlessly, “You’re acting like everything's fine. Like you didn’t just-- How are you even here, Son? How is
“I am so...” Cas’s voice broke as his smile wavered “...proud of you. My beautiful, son.” Jack smiled down at Castiel with a look of pity and grief and nodded.
Sam was silently crying when she pushed D aside, she staggered over to the corner of the room, placing her hand upon the deep grey wall for balance. She lurched forward and projectile vomited blue sludge all over her feet. Deanna pinched her nose and swallowed hard, trying to get her brain moving again. The haze of the alcohol was both a blessing and a curse, now that she felt distanced enough to remember how to deal with these kinds of situations in a detached manner, but intoxicated enough that the ripe smell of blood and her sister's reeking vomit was causing her stomach to do continuous backflips.
“Mary seems to think you’re some kind of queer, shacking up with that strange fella in the trench coat,” he stated casually in a low voice so nobody would hear. “What’s his problem anyway, did ya find out?” Mary’s head fell into her hands as Dean raised his brows and tried to remember how to breathe, his mouth flapped open and closed for a moment as he huffed out an attempt at a cool and laid-back laugh.
"I want to do so many things to you, Dean," Castiel says to the male, running a hand through his soft brown hair, smiling when Dean lets out a soft purring sound.
Dean took a shaky breath as he looked up at Sam, gripping his forearm and looking into his little brother's tearful eyes. His own eyes were filled with tears as he gives a watery smile. "I'm okay, Sammy," he assures through a soft wheeze, feeling his brother's grip on his shoulder and side tighten to keep him upright. "I'm okay, this is a good ending for me."
”So if I wore cowboy boots, would I be sexier than him?” Castiel questions, making Dean giggle and peck his lips.
Starting up the engine and making sure everything sounds right, they drive off. The landscape around them blurring by even though they aren’t even going above the speed limit. Dean thinks Castiel looks extremely handsome as the sun hits him and he squints in annoyance at the glare. Glancing back to the road, he sighs.
”No no no,” Castiel chuckles, gently trying to take his hands away from his face. “You don’t get to hide from me!” He scolds playfully.
Smiling wide, Dean nods. “I just fucking love you, so damn much.” He says, honest and raw. His face flaming with anxiety as he allows himself to fret that Castiel may not say it back; that it’s too early to say that.
Dean watched as Castiel packed his bag and the side of his room now looked more like an actual hospital room. Dean had been more quiet than usual, his brain building up a storm of emotions and stress. He was so in his thoughts he didn't notice Cas had crossed the room to him, until he felt a gentle hand pressing against his cheek. He blinked and suddenly focused in on Cas' eyes.
Sam was holding a baby in his arms, rocking the gentle bundle as he looks at Eileen who laid in the hospital bed, tired, but happy.
Dean doesn’t waste another moment to reach up and grip at Cas’ shoulders, pulling him down to crash his mouth gently to his. “Don’t care ‘bout no pie, you’re here-“ he mumbles against Cas’ lips.
Castiel chuckled softly. “I was, planting seeds in the garden in the backyard. I know how much you appreciate food with no pesticides... and even though you don’t need to eat, I thought you’d like to make your famous cuisines every once and awhile.” He says, seeming sheepish now, as if Dean hadn’t fallen more in love with him.
"P-please, Cas, do it, do it, I need you-" He's cut off by Castiel pushing into him, holding his hip tightly and gripping his hair just enough.
Dean sighs, it was one of the better days. His breathing was still crap, but he wasn’t as sore today. Perhaps it was the new medication he was put on. The nurses specifically told him it wasn’t going to heal him, but it would make the pain more tolerable. And it had. So Dean was grateful.
Blinking hard, Dean allows the words to settle in. “What does that mean?” He says, just to make sure he wasn’t getting anything wrong.
Castiel watches Dean as he sticks his tongue out in concentration. Dean looks back at Castiel with a bright smile. “What?” He questions.
The drive was calm, Castiel speaking of his plans outside the hospital walls. He had gotten used to his job in the bookstore and it was attached to a coffee shop. He saw Gabriel pretty regularly and got to take on jogging again.
Dean notes the way his voice seems just as low and gravelly as now and the way he squints like he's staring directly into the sun instead of the lens. He was wearing a grey AC/DC shirt sunglasses rested on top of his head. He was gorgeous. Like a sun god or an angel more like it.
If Dean could light on fire from his arousal and embarrassment mixed together, he would be burning the house down. He flinched a bit at his comparison, it hit a little too close to home. Ouch. That one hurt too.
Dean takes a breath in, he could lie, he could hang up, but instead he takes the biggest risk he's ever taken in the romance and awkward department. "Hey, Cas, ever heard of the Sphere of Darkest Desires? Yeah, well, something happened." He takes a breath in, heart pounding in his ears.
Castiel smiles and kisses Dean's lips again before placing him on the couch and running a hand through his hair, taking in the soft sound that escapes the oldest Winchester's lips, before he relaxes into the couch and passes out.
"Will you let me, Dean? Will you let me love you and make you feel good?" He questions, tightening his grip in Dean's hair and watching as Dean's eyes flutter closed at the slight tug.
Castiel was there, in all his angel glory. His trench-coat around him, his tie twisted in a way that usually irked Dean, but whenever he fixed it, it somehow got tangled again. Castiel was searching his gaze though, ocean blue boring into forest green and then Castiel's gaze dropped down to Dean's fingers which were still twitching to itch again. "Dean," The male rumbled, looking at him with concern, gently pulling Dean's hands away from each other and resting one of his hands in each of his own.
for him. He parts his lips, taking a quick breath in "I can do this... and..." He cuts himself off with a silent sob before sucking another shallow breath in.
Dean had been messing around in the Bunker's storage, peeking through dusty boxes filled with files, pictures, objects. Everything was labelled perfectly, everything except this strange bronze sphere in glass casing. It immediately spiked Dean's interest and Sam wasn't here to reprimand him, and Cas was who knows where, so he opened the glass box and as soon as his fingertips brushed the ball, it felt like he was being transported. His vision went black and his body dropped to the floor, the ball and the casing beside him, but not damaged. The ball rolled a few inches away and the box fell on it's side where a piece of clear masking tape was visible at the right angle and in very faded sharpie, were the words
“I was worried you'd decided that, now that you finally had me, you didn’t need to make an effort anymore”. Dean scoffed as he opened a can of tomatoes.
"Oh, man, you have no idea. I'll start writing a list, beginning with what happened when Sammy got drunk for the first time when she was twelve, and why she's so deathly afraid of clowns." Deanna smirked at her younger sister and wiggled her brows. Jesse's eyes widened as he mouthed the word twelve silently at his girlfriend. She shook her head in reply, placed her hands upon the man's shoulders, and turned him, before moving her hands to rest upon his upper back, pushing him forward, lightly.
The motion behind the bar had Dean focus his attention forward as suddenly a mass of people appeared, surrounding him.
“Why, Castiel, You’re looking mighty thin, you are. May I offer you some pop-corn-n.” Dean chuckled as his acting skills faltered.
“Uh, yeah, duh! But… Damn. Well, maybe we can both be on the lookout for someone because honestly, like, I'm not one hundred percent sure-- and I don't wanna be overbearing here, but, I get super closeted vibes from Castiel, don't you? Like, he really gets my Gaydar pinging and he totally deserves to be happy, don't you think?" Dean sighed as he rubbed his hand over his face.
“I mean, it’s the plan.” He nodded, “No guarantee. These types of things have a way of not working in my favor but,” He shrugged, “I must be strong and carry on”, He repeated in a mockery of himself.
“Uh, I--” He swallowed. “It’s complicated.” He narrowed his eyes at the man across from him. Simon raised a brow in response, nodding feverishly.
away, but Rowena had assured him that there was no way to outrun his fate now. He assumed the flight would be canceled at the last minute and Sam would find a case in Ohio and head off without telling him and he couldn’t risk that, no matter how much he trusted Rowena’s handy work. He figured that even if he let Sam in on what was going down and locked both himself and Sam in the bunker, they’d somehow magically wake up in the barn in three days, anyway. At least this way he could go out doing some of the things he enjoys, and he was determined to spend the remainder of his time on earth living his life to the fullest.
Dean silently followed behind Sam toward the passenger side of the Impala, his footfalls falling meticulously in time with his brothers. He bit his lips together, trying to keep himself from bursting with laughter. When Sam arrived at the door, he turned his body to look across to the driver's side, expecting to see his older brother. Instead, he saw an empty garage. Confused, Sam sharply turned. Dean sidestepped quickly, trying to stay in line with Sam’s back.
”, Jack had said. Dean stared at the blank laptop screen in front of him. Jack had pretty much told him that it was impossible.
Dean looked out the car window as the guitar solo started. He choked down the lump in his throat as he watched the fields fly past. He realized he’d never really paid attention to the words of the song which was a wild concept considering it had sat in the glovebox of the impala his whole life. He’d been forced to listen to the tape too many times to count, and yet this time, for the first time, he couldn’t stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks.
"I'm thinking I might do it," Jack said, turning back to look at the house as the Winchester brothers made their way outside and toward the car, their laughs muffled as they playfully tried to trip each other as they walked. A smile tugged at the corner of Castiel's lips.
"So, no strippers? Just campfire stories?" He asked, picturing the boys lazing around on the couch laughing at wild, dangerous tales from their previous life.
“What’s that?” Dean followed her eyes to his arm where he saw red puckered scaring hidden by the black fabric.
“You okay?” By the look on Sam’s face, Dean could tell his brother was anxious to try to breach the subject once more.
approach to the whole, God thing”. Dean remarked, glancing at Kelly and chuckling at his own wit, attracting the unwanted attention of Penny.
“You don't have to finish it if you don’t want to.” She stated, tucking the food in her mouth to the side so she could speak without spraying it everywhere. Sam smiled sadly.
"Well you know Sam, she doesn't like to brag," D explained sarcastically before clearing her throat. "So… Anyway, Jess, now that we're great friends and all, I hate to be rude but do you mind giving me and my sister a moment alone?" Sam shook her head.
, Dean noted. Tall green hedges lined the gravel where the boys sat on the hood of the impala. Dean ignored him.
"It's like Facebook now," Jack said grinning. Dean's eyes narrowed incredulously urging further explanation. "You can invite your friends," He explained as if that somehow made it all clear. Dean licked his lips a little impatiently and raised his brow. Jack realized he needed to start at the beginning "Heaven's like earth now. You can live there and choose who shares your heaven with you. No more memories or anything, if you don't want. You can visit each other's houses to eat or play boardgames… whatever you want" Dean's eyebrows shot up, he was impressed. A smile spread over his face and he nodded with enthusiasm.
"Yeah? Well, thanks for that". He replied, voice dripping with sarcasm. He noticed her usually piercing blue eyes were dull and unfocused and there was an empty bottle of beer in front of her. "You don't look too hot yourself, kid."
Dean and I want to be able to talk to you about it. I’m sick of you shutting me out. I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this stuff because they're all either dead, missing, or completely freaked out after Chuck used them as a damn pawn in some perverted Winchester-centric melodrama.” He sighed.
“Cas, I’m just-- I’m having a real hard time… with-- with all of this.” He finally admitted. He walked his heavy feet toward Castiel. “I don’t--” He chuckled grimly. His eyes flicked back and forth, unseeingly, at the concrete floor between them. “I don't... want to be here.” His throat felt dry from forcing the words out. Castiel stared at him, his brows furrowed, waiting for him to continue, to elaborate. Dean licked at his lips. “I thought I’d be able to do it this time”, he looked up into Cas’s eyes, “You know? Really stick it out.” He shook his head, “I felt like my fight was finally over; There's no big bad lurking around the corner. For the first time in my life, there was no real reason I
“I’m Dean Winchester. I have the largest heart out of everyone created throughout all of human history, and we’re all aware of this, but you’re never allowed to ever speak of it or I will ignore your very existence for the remainder of eternity.” Dean stared at Cas, his eyes narrowed.
“I’ll be right there,” Dean nodded. Castiel smiled an awkward smile and then shut the door behind him. Dean dropped his back onto his bed and lifted his phone back up to his ear.
The next day the Winchesters woke up bright and early to go to the local supermarket to stock the fridge and pantry with all sorts of supplies. Dianna cooked a huge brunch, vegan for Sam, although D assured her, now that she’d only barely managed to choke down the tofu scramble, that it would be a one-off. Dianna enjoyed cooking, it was something she was good at given her years of practice. John would call her ahead of time from the road on his way back from a hunt, expecting an elaborate home-cooked meal. It was “a woman’s job,” he told her over and over beginning when she was seven years old.
“Yeah, we’ve done Zeppelin, so Hendrix is the next natural option.” Dean smiled, his eyes on Cas as he leaned over and picked up the beer again. Cas’s expression turned tender as he smiled at Dean. Dean cleared his throat, trying to ignore the feeling in this stomach. “So, uhh, now that's all sorted. What’s with the booze in heaven? How are we getting drunk in the Matrix?” Cas frowned.
“Did you have a nightmare?” Cas asked as if it wasn’t blatantly obvious. Dean nodded, a smile wavering on his mouth that didn’t reach his eyes. Cas ran his hands up and down Dean’s arms, then clasped Dean’s hand in his own, and with his spare, he continued to rub Dean from his arm to his back, tracing circles over and over. Dean let his eyes flutter closed, focusing on the feeling as it almost instantly calmed him, easing what little confusion and fear remained leftover from Dean’s dream. "Sorry. I heard you calling me but I wasn't sure if you still wanted--"
Mary had the honours of driving a shitfaced Dean back to the bunker. Dean hated leaving his car in some random cherry pie town all alone but worried that maybe the new heaven was so heavily inspired by Earth that he'd find his way into a car accident and become a quadriplegic or wind up with a DUI... and after the way he'd been burning all his bridges since getting to heaven, he figured he was on a fast track to having to disappear on a long drive somewhere, never to be seen again… therefore losing his license seemed like a bad idea.
“Are you kidding, Dean? The way the two of you looked at each other. Who didn't know?” Dean scoffed.
"Oh, who-- Um. Thing is-- like, you uh-- you--" Charlie's voice cut through Dean’s attempt at some kind of sentence.
“Is that what all of this has been about? I-- Dean.” Castiel shook his head, grinning ear to ear. “Kelly has already stated to me that she wants Jack to go back down to Earth. He’s alive, and semi-human, albeit also a God," he mused, "but a confused and childish God who now needs to relearn the alphabet and simple addition. I-- I can’t believe you sometimes--”
"Uh--" Dean swallowed. He poured as much enthusiasm into his voice as he could muster. "Well, I'll definitely go to support you. I can try get a group of us to go. We'll be your ally cheer squad". Charlie was silent for a moment, the only sound was Dean’s heartbeat in his ears. He continued to wonder how he even had a heartbeat without a body.
“Uh, yes. I did. I actually dreamt last night… not a nightmare, a dream... for the first time in…” Cas glanced upwards in thought “...since I was last a human.” Dean smiled.
“Not particularly.” He replied, squinting back up at the stars. Dean stared at Cas, irritation began bubbling away inside of him.
“Is this the place?” Sam asked, completely unaware of any of the thoughts that plagued his brother’s mind.
“Nope.” Dean managed. Penny shot his head toward Dean, his eyes sparkled with a newfound level of rage. They boiled in a display that roughly translated to an undeniable threat, such as... smiting Dean then and there. “No. See, I’m not okay with that.” Penny glowered at him. “I-- uh-- Would it help to tell you I was having a really bad day?” Penny laughed, a loud thunderous sound with zero humor.
“So, no more special joints before bed?” Sam asked, cocking her head to the side playfully. Deanna licked her lips.
“You would really rather leave me here, doomed to wander this place alone than come home for your family?” Jack asked, tears of his own now streaking his cheeks. Cas shook his head, still unable to meet Jack’s eyes, his heart ached.
Dean’s mouth found Cas’s again, he couldn't help it. He felt as if he could have personally been the one to explode the lights around them, like, he himself had just taken on the power of a million suns. He was the highest he'd ever been, grinning as he pecked little kisses onto the angel's lips, silencing him.
He stared down into the sink only now truly seeing how desperately he held on to the edges, his knuckles white. He released his hands and watched the color return to them.
“No”. Dean's heart sank. He knew if he had shared the true reason for wanting to use this specific weapon, his brother would have of course humored him, but he obviously wouldn’t even begin to explain any of that. He tried one last futile attempt.
“Oh, I assumed you’d get to the point eventually. Our mutual friend, Jack. Apparently, it's easier to create a bunch of new angels rather than resurrect the old ones... It turns out us angels are an endangered species, now'days''. Dean hesitated, the fog of his dream still swirling somewhere just beyond the surface.
“It was Dean. He-- Cas it's bad. I--” Jack shook his head trying to clear it, trying to get his emotions under control. “Cas, I have to free you from the empty. It's the only way we can save Sam.” Castiel felt as if his brain was working in slow motion.
“Dean Winchester.” Dean interrupted, placing his bottle on the table, standing, and extending his hand. “And you are?”
“I won.” Castiel frowned and with a sharp and shallow exhale, he felt himself get snapped back into his body.
“Yeah,” he admitted. He cleared his throat, attempting to imitate his usual bravado, “Yeah. So this whole thing you just testing the waters, or is there really gonna be live music and food trucks at this march?” Dean had a knock on his door. He inhaled sharply. “Hold on a sec,” He placed his hand over the receiver and swallowed hard. “Yeah?” he called, gruffly. Castiel opened the door a crack, his brows raised.
"Infinity Gauntlet-ed everything?" He asked with an enthusiasm that reminded Dean of Miracle. He could almost visualize Jack's big golden tail wagging.
“No offense or anything,” Mario began as she stood up, “but no way are we gonna tell you that. You could be, like, a murder or something.” Deanna rolled her eyes and sighed, pulling her wallet from where it sat tucked inside the jacket pocket. She slotted her nail into the card section, peaking at them carefully, and pulled out her real Driver’s license.
“I think it was meant for you.” Dean slowly gripped the picture, his hand brushing against Castiel’s soft skin. Dean inspected the drawing closely, it dawned on him what the drawing was probably supposed to depict; the two giant inconceivable creatures that hovered out of the house's windows and into the blue sky, were most likely Cas and Jack, their true forms.
“You’re not fine, you’re--” Cas cocked his head to the side, “Are you having a panic attack? What did Jack show you?” Cas’s eyes were wide with concern.
“Oh, I’m aces.” he smiled. “I’m gonna need you to rustle up some kind of mojo that’ll take Sammy out of commission for a few days.” Rowena cocked her head to the side.
"No, really, Cas. You'd have loved her. Blonde, legs for days, ass you could bounce a whole wallet off." Dean lied, animatedly. He licked his lips and smiled to himself proudly.
“You’re a fucking dickhead, you know that?!” Dean shook his head, his eyebrows raised in bewildered anger.
"Thanks," Dean murmured, releasing his brother. Adam backed away, looking confused and uncomfortable as he replied.
“You can. You always do anyway”. Dean peaked up at his younger brother. Sam looked heavy-hearted and the sight made Dean’s stomach twist. He wanted to open up to his brother but he knew that it was way too risky. Sam had a history of being the only one who would be able to talk Dean out of sacrificing himself. He’d probably break into a rousing, yet overemotional, inspirational speech about finding some kind of third alternative; some hope for a future where they both could live, and Dean knew that the concept of that was far too inviting, too tempting. He considered, for a brief moment, sharing the exact details of Cas’s death; the other equally terrible grievance that was currently haunting Dean. However, instead, he replied.
“Damnit, Crowley! You scared the shit outta me.” He growled. Crowly smiled smugly at him from the stool to his right, dressed in his regular expensive black suit with the stark addition of the new bling he was rocking on his index finger.
“I believe it pertains to you as well.” Castiel gestured his hand toward the chair where Dean had been sitting. Dean sighed and shook his head while rolling his eyes, then obediently took a seat.
"Can't you finish that another time?" he leaned over and opened the glove box and Jack obediently placed the clipboard and pen inside before closing the compartment again. He sighed and looked out his window, toward Sam's house.
“And here I was thinking I’d be good for business.” Dean swirled his glass and threw back a mouthful for dramatic effect.
Love the concept of Sam calling up Max Banes to ask him for his address so he can send him a wedding invite and Max is all "Can I get a plus one for my sister?" and Sam's all "Dude, she died" then Max has to explain that he ended up dooming his soul because he used that witch's ring to resurrect his sister from a bunch of twigs and Sam's all "Hey, man. We've all been there... Family... Am I right?".
“Weird?! I want to kill the guy!” He stopped mid-thought, “Can you kill Death? Surely, right? Because Crowley wasn’t always Death, right?” his eyes narrowed, “Unless it was like a promotion because he was so good at being an asshole”. Dean chuckled.
The church they had chosen, he had frequently visited since Jack first took over as The Big Man. The building was large and modern. There were no stained glass windows, no pictures of Jesus, no angel statues, nothing but the cushioned wooden pews, wide open space, and a big wooden cross at the center of the wall behind the glass pulpit. Sam liked going to church, he had found. It was a way to deal with all of the crazy he’d gone through over the years. Hearing the stories of real people going through horrible things all for the entertainment of a sadistic God, he could relate. He’d even spent time outside of the church, hanging out with the pastor. They’d discuss God as a flawed retributionist entity and Sam loved that. He loved that he could still keep his faith but was able to feel validated about his mixed feelings. He recalled the time he’d invited Dean and Cas over for dinner to meet Pastor Finley; young, green-haired, non-binary, Pastor Finley. They discussed at length the trials and tribulations from each passage of the bible over drinks, dissecting the literal and figurative meanings in each story. Cas only slipped up a few times; referring to Adam in the present tense or furiously debunking Matthew 22:30.
"You what!?" Jack continued to keep his eyes pinned to Cas, his blue eyes wide with worry. "Please tell me that's a really bad joke. You can't trust her, man!" Dean sighed. He was so tired. It had been one of the longest days of his life and it was still only early. He rubbed his brow, he could feel a tension headache setting in.
he decided, a kiss was a great start. Maybe a date, if she agreed. Not a rushed lunch date with Dean waiting for him so they could hit the road, and not a coffee date over old leather-bound lore books and a beat-up laptop, a proper date; a fancy date. A restaurant with an overpriced meal. Somewhere, he decided, he wanted to feel out of place. He wanted to go somewhere he could secretly worry that he would be kicked out if the waiter took a look at the brand name on his cheap suit. The idea of the two of them sitting across from one another in a world he never belonged to… a small smile took to his lips… The sudden realization occurred to him, he could try belonging to any world now. He could test out the versions of himself he always wanted to be. He could actually finally be the guy who took his girl to fancy restaurants and ordered overpriced meals... hell, maybe one day he'd actually be able to afford an expensive suit.
