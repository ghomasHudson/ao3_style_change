This ends abruptly sometime in early November when Aaron lets him know, extremely politely, that he has met someone.
“Thank you,” he says. “That’s great to hear.”
“I mean it! And I think it’s an important preface to what I want to ask you.” Jo nudges him. “Which is whether you might potentially like Castiel, in a liking way, romantically.”
“Well if it ain’t Dean Winchester,” says Benny, the warmth evident in his voice. “How the hell have you been? And where the hell have you been?”
And Dean? Well, Dean has a big pile of nothing waiting for him at the other end of the graduation stage. He’s hoping that he can tap the extensive Claremont McKenna alum network to somehow get employed, but his best guess right now is that he’ll be working in Bobby’s garage at least through the summer.
Sam takes a loud slurp of his green juice. “Well,” he says with an air of self-righteousness, “sometimes the very best relationships arise out of strong and solid friendships. For example—”
Gabriel arrives with a bottle of vodka and some orange juice, and then Meg with some Mangoritas, and then Anna who’s just happy to be there. The room is warm and cozy and full of light and sound, with Jo blasting her Senior Year playlist in the background. Dean sits on the bed and looks around the room and thinks about how damn lucky he is, how wonderful it is to see his soccer best friend and his work best friend and his regular best friend all in one room, all here because they love each other and they love him and that is so fucking beautiful and Dean is NOT going to cry.
The ringtone starts again.
He got back from Aaron’s late, later than usual even, due to a prolonged effort by Aaron to convince him to sleep over. As Dean insisted on his usual departure in the 2:00 AM shadows, Aaron sighed and pulled his blanket up to his chest. “I came out to my dad this summer, you know,” he said. “I would be willing to actually try this, if you wanted to. I mean, we can just keep doing whatever this is too. But if I meet someone who wants to sleep over and have breakfast together, I’m going with the breakfast guy.” Dean just stared until Aaron nodded awkwardly and waved him out.
Dean takes a whiff. “Nah, I think that’s just a few festering superiority complexes. Sammy!” he yelps, spotting his gigantor brother waving so hard he fears for his shoulder health.
Dean flinched when he felt a hand on his back, and he swung around, face draining of blood when he saw it was Cas. The one person he didn’t want to be seen with, especially with everyone standing around.
He’d imagined it would hurt, but nothing could have prepared him for the feeling of his baby moving slowly through his body. With each contraction, he dug his fingers into the meat of Cas’ shoulders and pushed as hard as he could. His back ached, his thighs shook, but with each successive contraction, Dean felt the baby move lower.
about me. It took me a long time to figure out what.” Dean just frowned, because if those angel dick bags were being mean to Cas again, he’d storm heaven himself to teach them a lesson.
Dean had never run so hard in his
Finally, after what felt like an age, Adam sighed a long suffering sigh and got to his feet. Dean's heart was thundering in his chest as he circled the table, but all Adam did was shake his head and pat Dean on the shoulder.
A week past with little to no change in weather, rescue or contact with anyone else.
Dean absently scratched his stomach, which had been goddamned itchy lately, and paused. With a shaky hand, and making sure Cas wasn’t watching, he gently cupped his belly. He pursed his lips, and frowned, a tingly, surreal feeling creeping up his back.
Dean shook his head, laughing to himself. People liked to pretend, in public, that they were normal and vanilla. But show them some Fanfiction, where all their wildest fantasies were laid before them, some they didn’t even know they had and the creature was released. Dean had complained
The girl smiled at him, and tried to flirt, but he really couldn’t be bothered. His feet hurt, actually,
Grinning, Dean replied. He was glad he didn’t have to think much when he talked to Cas, because he was having a hard time concentrating that hard.
Climbing into the car, Sam chatted happily about his first few days of high school, and Dean couldn’t help feel a little bit jealous. His brother was a pro at making friends, all he had to do was bat his puppy dog eyes at someone and they pretty much fell at his feet. He was easy going and talkative, almost the total opposite of Dean.
“What the hells he saying?” Dean looked at Sam with wide eyes, but his brother didn’t have any more of an idea that he did. Neither of them knew enough Enochian to understand what Cas was babbling on about, but then Sam’s eyes suddenly grew wide in recognition.
“That – that sounds acceptable.” Dean chuckled, and reached out. With a trembling hand, because of
“No, it was a
“Cas?” He said it as a question, simply because he didn’t know which version of the angel he was looking at. Was it roboCas, who had stolen not only their friend, but Dean’s hope of love? Or
“Well, the names Dean, and this here’s Gabriel.” The beta nodded and did a little wave. Thank Christ he kept his mouth shut.
“It’s ok? Melissa?” Dean tried to lean forward, but he was stuck. All of his muscles had given up, and Benny was just staring at what Dean couldn’t see. Melissa grinned, and picked up the squalling bundle of blood and gore, placing him gently on Deans chest.
“You have

Cas made him tonics and teas, everything he could think of to get his body back into synch and running how it was supposed to. No matter what they did, though, Dean just kept getting worse.

an uncivilised ape, thank you very much. Sam groaned and shook his head, but Gabriel just cracked up.
He couldn’t speak for the horrors he had seen, so he had just clutched his knees and waved them off. When he had finally managed to get his breath back, seriously, he was way too old for the crap he’d just done, he had explained.
“Then why the hell didn’t you set him up with me before dick face?”
Nah, he preferred the ones that were clearly homemade, by people who obviously loved each other. To have the kind of trust and commitment to put something so intimate and passionate on the internet… it was something Dean craved, more than he felt comfortable admitting.

“That’s absolutely fine, honey. Whatever you want, we just can’t wait to see you again. Do you – do you need us to come get you or…?” His mom let the question hang in the air, for which Dean was grateful.
His heart almost exploded in his chest when Cas grinned, an honest to god, teeth and gum filled face cracker.
“I am happy, Sam.” His brother looked at him like he didn’t believe that for shit, and neither did Dean. He ran a hand through his short, dark hair. “Its just not worth the drama, Sam. You know what this towns like, what
“Yup, sure am. Is there anything else you want me to do? I’m all done with this one, and I don’t have anything else.” Dean was panicking slightly, because while he

Dean gripped the steering wheel, rung it all the way around to the right, and felt his whole world come to a standstill as he caught Cas’ terrified blue eyes before the screech of tires drowned out everything else.
supposed to be protecting him, but whatever, Dean was a big boy, and he could deal with whatever was coming through the storm.
“You know how to finish dinner. I’ll be in my room.” Dean collected up his books, ignored Sam’s damn puppy dog eyes and went back to his room. Clutching his chest would have been all kinds of dramatic, but it felt like his heart was trying to rip its way out. Closing his door, Dean leant against it heavily, closing his eyes.
A soft hum from across the table had Dean looking up, and the guy was nodding in sympathy. “My brother keeps organising ‘dates’ for me, even though I’ve expressed my disinterest in them.” He had used actual air quotes, what the hell. “So far, one has been awfully rude, one only wanted to sleep with me and well, tonight’s didn’t turn up at all.”
“So, I’ll text you?” Dean asked hopefully. He was beyond excited, but he had to keep cool. All of this was new to him, so he had to keep calm. Cas nodded, clearly just as happy as Dean. They hadn’t agreed on anything yet, but Dean was happy to go with it. They would build up to something more.
and nodded.
With no other option, Dean agreed. He really liked Cas, and even as a friend, what was the worst that could happen?
“I'm sorry i didn't -” Dean started but Cas surged forwards, drawing him into a heated kiss.
Then there were the kids who were
Using the two alphas, and a big ass rock, Dean managed to crush the lock enough to wrench open the lid. He didn’t know what he had been expecting, but two folded fishing rods, a small tackle box and a set net, weren’t it.
“Uh, you heading out, Cas?” Damn him and his stupid questions, Cas must think he’s the biggest pile of dumb

He couldn’t say goodbye, everything was gonna be fine, and if the fucking paramedics hurried up, they would be. He knew that if he could just get Cas to a hospital, then everything would be
Cas must have sensed Deans trepidation, because he tilted Deans chin up with a shaky hand, until their eyes met. “Everything will fit, don’t worry about that.” Dean’s lips turned up in a shaky smile, and he shuffled forwards until he was hovering over Cas’ cock.
“Some guy in my social sciences class, they just beat the crap out of him because he questioned the teachers opinion on gay rights. I mean, he was right, and I
Who wants to guess what happens next???
Turning on the hallway light, Dean winced at the sudden brightness.
of it all, struggling to stay in the present.
“I’m doing just fine on my own, if you don’t mind.” Dean blinked, somewhat surprised that the man was British. He watched as the man tilted his head, and scented the air. His eyes widened, “Huh, an omega. Well, I wasn’t expecting
Dean carefully touched the alphas arm, not wanting to startle him. Cas breathed out a heavy breath and turned to look at him. “How do you want to proceed? I'm not very well versed in this sort of thing.” Dean didn't really know what that meant, but Cas said they would talk later so he would ask later.
“Cas found me, before any of the other alphas did.” After the tension filled few days, Dean needed to let loose some steam, and there really wasn’t any better way of doing that than teasing his alpha. “Yup, he was pretty damn thorough about it, too.” Dean made a show of looking into the pot that was bubbling away on the fire. “Shame there aren’t any carrots in there, Cas
Dean stopped wiping Links cheek where some milk had leaked free, and looked up to stare at Sam. “You’re kidding. What the hell are the chances of that?” The fact that there were, like, two points of separation between them, was just astounding.
to go without it.” Dean actually
mate?
“I don’t know what you mean.” Dean knew he sounded petulant, but he was freaking out something fierce, so he didn’t care. Benny sighed and scratched at his beard.
Sam seemed to have the same idea, because he threw his arm out, catching Dean before he could bust through the door.
“Just answer the fucking question.” Dean growled low in his throat, enough for Crowley to bare his own teeth in challenge. It didn’t happen often, omegas fighting, but when it did… yeah; he’d rather not go there.
Adam had the audacity to shrug like it was nothing, like he hadn’t been lying through his teeth basically the whole time he had been talking to Dean.
“Dean!”
“I know what you and dad were gonna do, and I just, I couldn’t let you do that.” His mom’s breath hitched, so he kept going. “I know you weren’t happy about it, but I really want you to meet him. I want – I want to come home, mom. But I need you to promise me that you won’t make me get rid of him. If you do, we’ll run and you’ll never see either of us again.” Dean put all the steel into his words as he could, because it was something he was not backing down from. His son’s life meant more to him than his parent’s feelings, and he was sure Benny would take him in, if the worst happened.
He popped the trunk, chewing on his lip as he reached carefully into the back. His fingers found the familiar silky material, and his heart stuttered. It would be a pretty shitty idea to get all
I’m gonna – I’m gonna come.” Dean felt everything in his body tense, that small moment of total calm before the storm, before –

Dean swiped his thumb over the skin of Cas’ shaking hand, trying to calm his nerves. It was strange, their positions switched. Normally, it would have been Dean scared out of his mind, but instead he was steering Cas through the turbulent waters of lip biting arousal and hand shaking fear.
to imagine how euphoric you taste.” Dean had just enough brain cells left to wonder how in the hell Cas was able to articulate a sentence. “It’s taking every ounce of self-control I have to keep myself from knotting you.” Cas did sound pretty fucked out, and if it were anywhere close to what Dean was feeling,
He cried harder when he thought of Cas, what he was probably thinking. Dean had just left him there, at school, to face everyone by himself. He had his friends, but it was different when you were together.
Who wants to play ‘Have You Ever?’?” She had a wicked grin on her face, and Dean went cold when he saw everyone else nodding. He knew what the game entailed, and that made him panic even more. Damn his new vow on no more lies, it was like the universe was trying to fuck with him on purpose.
the logic of the situation, or telling him when he was being a dick.
What was the worst that could happen?
“Is everything alright? You look like you’re about to pass out.” Cas looked concerned, and he had every right to be. Dean’s heart was hammering, and he felt lightheaded. Maybe it was a bad idea – maybe –
They’d just got engaged for fuck sake. They were in the prime of their lives, they didn’t smoke or do drugs, they were healthy, strong young men.
Your baby’s survival, and your safety, depend on that. Am I clear?” Dean gulped, because
“Dean, you must stay awake,
“What happened? Are you alright?” Cas came to a standstill close to Dean, but far enough away that they couldn’t touch. Dean was having none of that shit, not after the conversation he’d just had. Sam already knew, since the blundering lummox had caught them in the bushes, god he was
Nope, but another drink sounded fucking
Chuck jumped up, disappearing down the hall to answer the door. Dean shook himself; he was getting himself way too worked up for just a study group. As the voices drifted down towards him, he turned; plastering on a smile he hoped didn’t look too forced.
The burn was horrendous, but he kept going because as he kept telling himself, it was almost over. He cried out when it felt as if his body would split apart if the pressure didn’t ease within the next push, and with the shivering convulsion of his almost spent body, it did. His baby’s head slid out, releasing an almost euphoric amount of relief. The head was the widest part, if that was out, the rest would soon follow easily.
of mine.” Dean snorted before picking up a bowl of breakfast. God only knew what it was, but the little beta hadn’t failed them so far, considering the lack of ingredients available to them.
what are you, ten?” Sam knew as well as Dean did, that when you hadn’t had a good meal in a few days, tempers started to go to shit. Cas had been suspiciously silent through the whole thing. Dean shook his head and turned to see Cas smiling at him fondly.
The first house they reached was empty, save for a few broken bits of furniture and an angry looking goat. Dean hoped it made it out unscathed. It didn’t ask for the war raging around it, none of them did.

“Does
Seeing that the author was online, Dean thought it appropriate to vent his feelings.
i am sorry that this has taken so long! I know exactly what i'm gonna do for the plot now, so yay!
When they were absolutely sure the pack of alphas had passed, Cas and Dean deemed it safe to exit their small, vine covered shelter.
“I did it because I love you, Cas.”
Dean spotted a bench close to the water, and he steered them in that direction. When they sat down, Dean made sure to give Cas his space. The other man had been quiet on their short walk down the street, and Dean was happy to leave him with his thoughts.
Once he went over the words again, holy shit he was such a moron. Cas was… Cas was like him. He was exactly like him. He knew what it was like, he knew the deep, soul wrenching ache of being unable to create life. Cas knew the pressures of their society, how it was essentially built around producing the next generation.
“Hey Charlie, mind if I borrow Cas for a minute?” Cas smiled shyly at him, and Dean watched as his boyfriend nibbled his bottom lip. Dean cleared his throat and looked away, very much in danger of sporting an awkward boner. Cas smirked, as if he knew exactly what Dean was thinking, and laced their fingers together.
“I’m ok, Sam,” Dean heard his brothers breath hitch at the singular response, and he couldn’t have that. “
you’ll like him. You have so much in common, just trust me.” Dean rolled his eyes.
at his alphas positive reaction. He’d built a comfortable nest for him and his mate. The omega inside him preened with pride.
“First of all, don’t you dare fucking push me,
It broke his heart.
Instead, he covered Cas’ hand in his own, and smiled.
Dean frowned down at the gun he was cleaning, and tried to ignore the way his heart tightened in his chest. He didn’t know who had spilled the beans, not that it mattered. Everyone just assumed that Cas was a chick, the one-time Dean got hammered enough to mention him. He’d learnt his lesson though, and he had barely touched the stuff since. Garth was just trying to be friendly; he didn’t know that every time anyone talked about Cas, or Dean even thought about him, his whole world closed in on him.
After what felt like
“So, have you got anyone…” Dean shot Sam a look that told him to just
Cas shook his head, probably at the audacity of their English teacher.
Castiel realised, then, that Lucifer was in fact, insane. That was a passing thought, though, and didn’t stop him roaring and launching himself at the stunned alpha. Castiel let the last pieces of his humanity slip away, until his alpha took over, using his body as a tool for violence and
Dean blinked, and stared at his mate. He should have been used to the way Cas talked after months of knowing the guy, but sometimes it still caught him off guard. It took everything Dean had in him not to crack up laughing. He didn’t want to hurt his mates feelings, but he did have a limit to what he could handle.
“Yes, Dean. I would like that.” Cas gave Deans hand one last squeeze before disappearing back through the door.
School on Monday was… yeah, it was nerve wracking.
“It was, man, and nothing you, or any shrink says is gonna change my mind.” He wiped angrily at the tears falling, probably making his red eyes even worse, but he didn’t care. Benny wasn’t looking at him with pity or sympathy, he was just – just looking at him with acceptance, like he actually
No, not looking after.
They broke out into almost blinding sunlight. The beautiful white sand beach spread out before them, ending in glistening blue ocean, as far as the eye could see.
“Don’t thank me, just don’t disappoint me, ya hear?” She gave him another look that brokered no argument, and he nodded, before making a tactical retreat. He wasn’t exactly
“Ok, stay here and ask him what his name is,” Sam started to walk away, but yelled back, “I have a feeling we’re gonna be here for a while.” Yeah well, he hoped not. He had about, oh, two weeks, before things would get
“Hey, Cas.” He winced when his voice broke on Cas’ name, but the other guy mustn’t’ve noticed, he just smiled at Dean, and shoved his hands in his pockets.
He wouldn’t be able to leave until everyone was asleep, so he waited until his dad left for work, and crept down stairs for something to eat. His mom was nowhere in sight, so he scoffed everything he could reach. He hesitated, but then grabbed a box of fruit bars, some jerky and some chocolate. He’d put them in his bag, just in case he needed them.
“Is that why your dad hits you?” Four heads whipped around, but he didn’t stop, because at least it had meant the other boy, whose name Dean thinks was Alan, wasn’t getting pummelled. “Did he catch you with someone he didn’t agree with? Or did he find some porn or something?” Dean was just babbling, stalling for the bell, where he could alert a teacher or something, but he seemed to be hitting a nerve with Gordon.
They end up deciding on Scripps for dinner, since it’s not a great menu at any of the dining halls and Scripps has the most dependable salad bar. Not that Dean is particularly interested in that, but all of the dining halls have burgers and Cas seems particularly excited about some leafy greens.
Trying to remember the details of what he agreed to and frankly regretting both the effort and the agreement, Dean stumbles through the motions of getting dressed and tries to remember where his wallet is. The bright red shorts from last night hang haphazardly from his desk drawer and he avoids eye contact as he slips on a pair of navy athletic shorts instead.
opened his mouth.
WARNINGS FOR
Awesome.
Cas swallowed roughly, and Dean could almost see the moment he saw Cas come to some kind of decision.
Sam walked Jess up to her door when they dropped her off, which Dean thought was pretty damn chivalrous. It gave him a chance to give Cas a quick peck, which then turned into Cas pushing his tongue halfway down Deans throat. Not that he was complaining. Cas’ lips were soft and warm, sliding against Deans own. He swallowed Cas’ soft moan and held it close to his heart.
“Dean, you’re not making sense.” Benny sounded panicked, and Dean didn’t blame him. He must have sounded like he was dying.
had done that to Sam, to his whole family.
“Yeah, man. That’s why this has gotta be our secret, ok?” Sam looked at him intently, but nodded. Dean knew that at least for a few days, Sam would keep his mouth shut. Long enough for him to make it far, far away, anyway.
Yeah, he was man enough to know and to acknowledge, what he had for Cas was love, if that word was even big enough to describe what they have,
Cas just looked at them, and tilted his head, so reminiscent of how he used to be,
He was just over thirteen weeks, and he desperately wanted an ultrasound. He couldn’t risk it though, because they were horribly expensive, and they would see his medical history, or lack thereof.
His fist tightened when he heard one of the men on screen groan, and he opened his eyes, watching the screen as the one who was topping eased into his lover. The light was pretty bad, so he couldn’t see them very well, but he didn’t need that. He enjoyed the noises they made, the words they spoke in the heat of the moment, better than their anonymous faces.
“Don’t mention it, man. I was just doing what any decent person would have.” Well, he hoped so, anyway. The world was full of dick head and douchbags, him and Sam just tried to help wherever they could. They didn’t do it for thanks.
Dean wiggles his eyebrows. “I’ll arm wrestle you for that title.”
They chat for a while, catching up on the last two years. Benny’s parents are still in Lawrence but planning a move back home to Louisiana in December, so this is pretty much Benny’s last time in Kansas. Dean’s glad he caught him.
Sam responds almost immediately.
As he closes out of his final Google doc for the day, he glances at the computer clock and realizes that he barely has enough time to pick up dinner from the dining hall before movie night is set to start. Suddenly, he feels the nerves tingling in his hands again.
“Took a few wrong turns, but we ended up in the right place. Sam, this is my friend Cas. Or, uh, Castiel?”
“I would love to have dinner with you, Dean,” says Cas, looking pleasantly surprised.
They muddle their way through a drunken bedtime routine, barely managing a bathroom visit for brushing teeth and squinting in the harsh fluorescent light. Cas finishes first and goes back to the room, leaving Dean to stare at himself in the bathroom mirror. His eyes are red from the alcohol, face flushed, lips swollen, hair a wild mess. For a second, he thinks,
Cas’ eyes remain wide as he approaches the car with a certain reverence. “My grandfather used to collect classic cars. They were all sold off when he died, but I still know a beauty when I see one.” Dean unlocks the car and Cas, with extreme delicacy, places his bag in the backseat.
Jo rolls her eyes and makes a throat slicing motion to Dean behind Ellen’s back. “Yep,” Dean says cheerfully. “Jo was actually just telling me about how she was so excited to have the opportunity to learn about bike repair this summer, and now that I’m back I can teach her even more!”
Gabriel shrugs. “They didn’t fit. Plus, I got distracted talking to Raphael as he was refilling the pastry bar. My man! Well, my other man. You’re my number one man, even if you won’t let me put my hands on your balls anymore.”
“Dean,” Cas says again. “Please, it’s important.”
“I think I need to puke.”
Sam laughs. “Cas, I’m glad Dean has you around to keep him in line when I can’t.”
“Uh, yeah,” she responds, sliding her glasses back up her nose, where the collected sweat immediately reverses her efforts. “I checked it out from the gym because we were trying to ride up to Baldy, but I didn’t even make it off campus.”
Jo sighs. “Not that it’s either of our business, but Castiel went through a pretty nasty breakup last year. With a guy. Someone else with a weird name too, though I honestly don’t remember it right now. Pomona kid, politics major. From what I’ve heard, he was a nasty piece of work. That was honestly why Cas and I started hanging out – he really didn’t have anyone else. Except Charlie, but I think she was abroad last spring or something.”
“Almost, champ.”
Cas rolls his eyes and says, “Fine, but if we’re going to do this then we’re doing it right.” He shakes out some salt next to Dean’s belly button and sticks a lime wedge between Dean’s teeth. “Hold that.”
And that’s the fun version of the spiral. More often than not, though, Dean finds himself in a much deeper panic wondering yet again if Cas is into him. And since he talked to Jo, from time to time he also wonders if he is into Cas. And of course, more broadly, if that might mean that his father is rolling in his grave somewhere because his oldest son is gay. Or, according to Jo, perhaps bi.
“What?” Dean says, whipping around to meet his gaze. “What did you say?”
Dean is feeling pleasantly warm and loose by the time the girls are done getting ready and starting to pour their own drinks. He’s feeling straight-up drunk by the time they’re actually ready to go, with his hands numbing up a bit and not a single reservation on his mind. It is well past the 6:01 mark, with the sun starting to go down behind the old Scripps library, but from Gabe’s texts, the soccer party is still going and the girls still want to make an appearance.
They fall onto the bed together and Cas rolls them over so that he’s on top, lightly presses one hand to Dean’s neck and pulls back on Dean’s hair with the other while they kiss and Dean straight-up sees God.
Dean’s not sure how they get back to Sam’s dorm, aside from a few flashes of the inside of a car that smells like tobacco and peppermint. He thinks he lays down at some point to rest his head in Castiel’s lap, but that would mean that his face has been in very close proximity with a very compelling part of Cas’ anatomy and nothing has come of it, so maybe that’s not actually real. Regardless, somehow Cas gets them back to that Spanish-style roof and the arching doorway and Dean is so grateful, so glad that Cas is so smart and responsible and caring.
He feels Aaron’s breath down his torso, down to the waistband of his Zefron shorts, teeth dragging across his skin and raising goosebumps along the way. Staring at the ceiling, he promises himself once again that this is the last time and tries not to think about blue eyes like black holes.
It’s good to see Sam relaxed and at ease; there had been some years there where Dean wasn’t really sure that he would ever see Sam happy again. Dean’s freshman year, he had driven back to Kansas almost once a month to check on Sam and make sure that he was okay. After losing their mom and then their dad in rapid succession, it seemed only reasonable that the kid might be having a tough time. Luckily, Bobby and the guys in his shop stepped in to make sure that Sam was fed, housed, clothed, and even employed when he wanted to be. Sam, meanwhile, had funneled all of his energy into getting the best grades possible so that he could end up, well, here.
Dean whips around. “Oh, he’s not my boyfriend. I mean – I’m not, you know. I’m straight.”
“I would like to take a shower,” says Castiel. Dean glances in the rearview and doesn’t see him. When he turns around, he sees Cas fully lying down in the backseat. “This combination of sugar and caffeine does not particularly agree with me,” Cas sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I’m hopeful that a shower will help.”
, slowly unbuttoning his shirt and then sliding along the inside of it down his arms to pull it off. Dean’s skin is so fucking hot from the alcohol and the dancing and the being wildly turned on, and Cas’ hands raise goosebumps everywhere they touch, sending shivers down Dean’s whole body.
They pass the first night playing cards, ordering takeout, and nursing beers for longer than is truly necessary. Dean and Cas have a minor disagreement about sleeping arrangements, but Dean wins by simply lying down on the floor with Sam’s extra blanket and falling asleep before Cas can try to fight him further. He wakes up feeling a million years old with all of his joints creaking and clicking, but still feels a smile spread across this face when he sees Cas’ bleary, blinking morning face looking down at him from Brady’s bed.
“They are at an orgy,” Castiel responds in a neutral tone. Dean chokes on his seltzer and coughs for several minutes before responding. To his credit, Cas treats this with the same neutrality. “Cool,” Dean finally chokes out.
He still had a good four months to go, but he liked feeling prepared. It made him feel slightly more in control, despite his body chugging on regardless.
He really,
though, so he did feel it when Cas pulled out slightly and pushed all the way in.
“What do you write, Chuck?” Cas asked his friend, tilting his head to the side, and Dean
allowed to be that hurt, and whoever had done it to him, well they would fucking pay, wouldn’t they?
there was no way to tell that you had conceived.” Cas’ voice was tight and deep, Dean could tell without smelling the acrid scent of devastation around them that Cas was barely hanging on. “You listen to me; none of this was your fault. You – you didn’t do
“Cas?” The other boy looked at him, head tilted to the side in that ridiculously cute quirk of his. “Um, I was wondering…” Damn he was bad at this talking business. He blushed when Cas threaded their fingers together, and brushed his thumb over Deans knuckles. He could do it, god
The other omega.
Very quickly, their pants were shed, tented underwear all that separated them. Dean looked down, and felt his cock twitch when he saw the wet spot dampening Cas’ briefs. His boyfriend was
He hoped that doused Cas’ fears, because he
“I hate those fucking jocks.” Dean grimaced, wondering what the hell the football team had done. It didn’t take much to ruffle Chuck’s feathers, and when they were ruffled, the culprit usually ended up deep fried in the newest chapter he was working on.
Dean clutched the thin strip of material in his hand as he rounded the car back to where Sam was hovering. His brother looked at him, and then glanced down at the thing in his hand.
“Sure am, buddy. Just gotta find some water.” Dean turned up the wattage, but Cas just narrowed his eyes. He clearly didn’t believe him, but instead of calling him on it, he just nodded.
“Do it.”
which earned him a narrow eyed scowl.
“So I guess your goin home, then.” Benny sounded so damn sad, Dean didn’t know what to do. He stopped his snivelling, and beckoned Benny closer. Once he got within range, Dean grabbed him in a clumsy, one armed hug. He held on tight, because Benny had probably saved his life, and Lincolns, by taking a chance on Dean.
Spilling out into the early dawn light, Dean and his squad found cover quickly. His heart was pummeling the inner walls of his chest, threatening to jump out and expose him to his enemies. He scanned the area quickly for Benny, and found the southerner crouching a few meters to his right, listening intently to their orders as Hendrickson surveyed the scene before them.
The others left to get back to their work, but Benny stayed behind. Dean played with the legs of the onesie, still unable to quite believe in just a few weeks, his baby would be filling it.
“You ready, Cas?” Sam had his hands on the first piece, drilling into Cas’ temple. Luckily there were only five bits.
Castiel lost himself in the sensation and decadence of who he was beginning to think of as his mate, for he must be, if all the signs his body were giving him rang true. Dean finally pulled away, looking absolutely debauched, pink lips puffy and slick. So lost was he, that he failed to think about any chance of rejection.
Dean took a deep breath to prepare himself, before plunging under the soft waves. The water suppressed his screams as he washed his eyes. He knew it was the only way, but
He expected Gadreel and Cas to remain in control, even if he didn’t really want Cas too, and Gabriel wasn’t a threat. Betas didn’t react the same as alphas and omegas. He wanted nothing more than to spend his heat with Cas, but he couldn’t afford to get knocked up, not knowing when they were going to be rescued.
“Dean, that boy thinks the world of you. He is so mature for his age; I doubt a few high school rumours are going to put him off.” Dean really hoped so, because if Cas did break up with him… he didn’t know what he would do.
“I think I’m gonna hit the hay.” Everyone nodded their agreement, and set about finding their spots for the night. Sam and Gadreel slept by the entrance, probably to stand guard, lying down. He could see the furtive glances they stole at each other; he didn’t know why they didn’t just get it on already. It wasn’t like either of them could get knocked up, and disease wasn’t a problem either.
“As far as I am aware, it can take a few days or weeks for the body to recognise it is no longer…
It didn’t stop Dean blushing like crazy. He could feel the heat creeping up his neck, and invading his cheeks. Charlie sent him a sympathetic look, but he just stared at his books. He hated being the centre of attention, but some teachers loved singling out the quiet ones, even if it made things about one hundred times worse for them.
“That sucks man, sorry.” Dean was sitting next to Benny, who smiled at him, and bumped his shoulder with his own.
The scene that met him was both unsurprising and absolutely one-sided. Gordons goons had a sophomore held with an arm each behind his back, while Gordon railed into him, all while spitting hate in his face.
Cas.”
Cas just smiled at him, but Dean thought he saw something else there too, some emotion he couldn’t quite describe, but it looked a bit like hope. He was probably just projecting, seeing his own emotions or what he wanted reflected in Cas.
He didn’t deserve to feel that way, not after everything. Benny was a nice guy, and in the month he’d been on base, they had become good friends, but that was all it was ever going to be. All it
to us, we’d have told you that it was the
“Do it.”
“What should I worry about then?” Dean was trying to distract himself, and talking seemed like the best way to go about it. Cas closed his eyes and groaned when some slick slithered onto his cock.
“Boring,” she says. “Worked for my mom and got yelled at for not being as good as you.”
“Cas,” Dean says. “Cas, do you want to go to sleep? You look sleepy.”
Sam arrives home like a hurricane, as always. His flight is supposed to get in on Monday evening, since he only had one midterm to take on Monday morning, but it ends up getting delayed and Bobby finally gets him from the airport around 6:00 AM on Tuesday morning. Dean is fast asleep upstairs when he hears the door slam open and the thud of Sam dropping what sounds like six suitcases at once. Then the stomping up the stairs, since Sam is too gigantic to move across the floor quietly, and another dull thud as he falls into his bed. By the time Sam’s done showering, Dean is fully awake and staring at the ceiling.
of himself. From his messy hair, untucked tee shirt and ratty comfy jeans, right down to his woolly socks. He felt like in that moment, him and Cas, they were on the edge of
Dean isn’t much of a decorator, so his room remains simply appointed. Opposite the door, under the huge window, a dark oak bedframe holds a memory foam mattress with forest-green sheets and a quilt that Mary had made for him while she was going through chemo. Two squat nightstands sit on either side of the bed. The closets take up one side of the room, while the other opens into the Jack-and-Jill bathroom that Dean shares with Sam. In what used to be the only empty corner, next to the door, Dean added a comfy armchair he found in a thrift store the day he found out he got the scholarship to CMC.
“Regardless, Charlie, you’ll have to stop there so that I can preserve some of my modesty,” Cas says to her. “That story does not have a flattering ending for me. And a lady doesn’t give it all up at once.”
“Dean!” Sam pulls him into a hug. “You’re here! You made it!”
“How are things with Jess?” Dean asks, starting with a softball.
Castiel offers him a rare smile. “You may need to raise your standards.”
Dean knows that couldn’t be further from the truth.
“Dude, you’re being weird.”
“So.”
“But do you think he likes me, like, in a liking way?”
“I can hear you thinking,” Cas mumbles. “Stop thinking. And turn over so we can fit better.”
Today, 1:47 AM:
It’s mid-morning on Wednesday and Dean is sitting in a vinyl booth, wondering if this table has always felt so exposed. It’s not, really, tucked in a corner behind the bar, but there’s a direct eyeline to the door and out the window to the street. He checks his phone again, but still no new texts. The bell over the door chimes and he jumps, looking up, but it’s a mom with two kids instead of a six-foot Louisianan.
“Ah, of course. Anna, you are still welcome to shower here. I put out a towel for you and you can use any of the products in the blue caddy. Please let me know if you need anything. Bathroom is the last door at the end of the hall,” Cas says, pointing towards the only open door in the suite.
about it. And so what if he’s seeing Aaron more than usual, and sometimes imagining what Aaron would be like if he had blue eyes and a deep, gravelly voice.
The time between Fall Break and Thanksgiving always passes in a blur, and this year is no exception. This time around, however, instead of spending every free second sweating in the gym or getting pelted with rain on the field, Dean actually finds himself having fun. He and Cas visit the Nixon Presidential Library about an hour away, because Cas is a politics nerd and they can. Gabe joins them for a trip to Salvation Mountain, and they all stand around looking at the painted scenes for about three minutes before Dean whispers to Cas, “Is this it?” and they decide to go get boba instead.
Dean has been avoiding this conversation for almost two weeks now, knowing that Gabe was back on campus and wanted him to start partying with the team again. Though Gabe remains one of his best friends, he still just doesn’t feel great about going to parties with a group of people who hadn’t done much to support him through his injury and with whom he has almost nothing in common now. Just because he misses the game doesn’t mean he needs the people.
Cas furrows his brow and turns to look at Dean. When their eyes meet, his gaze softens, as if he’s seeing something in Dean’s face that’s changing his mind about something. Dean suddenly feels exposed, like Castiel can see straight down to his soul. “I would like that, Dean,” Cas says softly. “I do not have a lot of friends here.” He’s silent for a beat. “Just fans.”
“Sorry, Bobby. I’ve been too busy being young and dumb.”
Dean arrives a little bit early and takes his food outside to a patio table. He sends a quick text to Cas.
Dean regards him suspiciously. “Doing as well as my many other friends.”
“As long as you’re not irreparably damaging the psyches of my female friends, I’m fine with a little bit of wounding.”
“Yes, and that one is actually a fairly obvious allegory. Though I must admit that sometimes I draw more abstract conclusions. You should read the essay I wrote on the queer symbolism in National Treasure sophomore year.”
“Well for the love of God and all things holy, you need to answer your phone faster! I’ve just been sitting in my car waiting for you. Cas and Jo are already there.”
says a voice in Dean’s brain,
“Cas, you can’t wear that,” he says, interrupting Jess’ introduction. “Those aren’t party clothes.”
Maybe this is hell. Just a constant jaunty ringtone from somewhere in the room that won’t stop. Why? Why won’t it stop? Dean remembers reading stories of torture by repetition. This. This is that.
Jess laughs, easily and loudly. “Well, I don’t know about that. But if you’re anything like Sam here, I’m sure we’ll be great friends.” She pulls on Sam’s arm until they’re sitting on his bed. Dean looks around before plopping himself into Sam’s desk chair.
“Dean, did you hear me?” Sam is looking at him expectantly as they pull into the parking lot. The sun is going down over a cluster of trees in the distance, and Dean knows they are supposed to be heading out soon to a house party at one of Sam’s friends’ places.
Deciding that maybe he’ll ride the inertia of brunch to the library, he grabs his backpack on his way out and zips up his laptop and notebooks inside. He gets to Gabe’s car a few minutes later, chewing some Extra Polar Ice and hoping he doesn’t look as terrible as he feels.
Dean rolls his eyes and goes back to drinking his coffee as Sam continues to list off the various benefits of dating a friend. Despite his annoyance, though, he still hears the tiny voice in the back of his head saying that maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if there were some feelings there after all.
He throws himself onto the bed and sets the pie on the nightstand. Sinking into the mattress, he lets out a sigh. Memory foam. It remembers him.
“It’s Jess,” Sam says, still red and now very interested in what’s happening on the backs of his hands. “Her name is Jess and she lives down the hall. I think she’s going to come out with us tomorrow night, if that’s okay.”
“I can’t.”
“Dean, are you asking me if Cas is gay?”
“Boy, let me get a good look at you,” Bobby leans back and squints. “You look good, Dean. Like you’ve finally filled out a bit. And like you’ve finally stop running from some demons.”
Castiel shakes his head. “Just the seltzers. I can grab you one from the fridge.” He crosses to a mini-fridge that Dean had somehow missed earlier, despite it being painted in a loud rainbow pattern. It’s stocked to the brim with, exactly as Castiel had described, truly every kind of alcoholic seltzer on the market. Cas tosses him a black cherry flavor from a brand he’s never heard of and he sits down at the very edge of the loveseat to start drinking it.
His body remains structureless through ordering and receiving his standard scrambled eggs with bacon, toast, and sausage and a black coffee but he starts to take human shape as he scrapes the last few bites of eggs into his mouth. Jo and Gabriel have kept up a steady chatter, pulling contributions out of Castiel every few minutes.
“Castiel!” Jo squeals, pulling him into a hug and handing him a shot glass at the same time. “It’s tequila. Come on, get in the holiday spirit.”
"I'm staying at my parents' house/ and the road not taken looks real good now..."
Cas unbuttons his pants so fucking slowly, so slowly that Dean wants to take over for him, and then unzips his fly tooth by agonizing tooth. He crawls back up and covers Dean’s mouth in a bruising kiss while pulling Dean’s hips up into his, just long enough to work Dean’s pants and underwear down to his knees. Dean uses one hand to pull them off the rest of the way and drop them over the side of the bed, and then he and Cas are both naked and it feels like everywhere they touch is searing the shape of Cas into Dean’s skin. Dean feels like he might cum at any second, but he tries to hold on, tries to forget that he’s been fantasizing about this very moment for months.
“You have to. It’s fate.”
“His name is Castiel. Well, Cas. I met him through a friend. There have been some, um, moments.”
“Ah, for the fickle nature of women!”
And then Cas leans in and murmurs in his ear, “It looks like the party is ending, and I think that maybe now would be a good opportunity for me to see your room for the first time.”
“Jess is coming over in about thirty minutes, so if you want to shower you should do it now.”
“I’m going to go wait outside with Sam and Jess,” he says. “I’ll, uh, see you out there when you’re dressed.” He doesn’t wait for a response before letting the door slam shut behind him.
“What do you mean?” Cas asks innocently. “This is my best trench coat.” Jess snorts but tries to keep a straight face when Sam catches her eye.
Dean makes eye contact with him. His gaze is hyper-focused and unwavering, and Dean feels like he’s suffocating under the pressure of those eyes. “What?” he asks.
Afterwards, he feels Cas get up and return with a soft, damp washcloth, cleaning them both up before pulling a blanket up and over them. He burrows into the soft warmth of Cas’ neck and lets Cas hold him like a baby. He’ll never admit it in the light of day, but this is absolutely the best part of the whole night. Cas presses a soft kiss into his forehead and says his name, but he’s so sleepy, doesn’t want to open his eyes.
“Just asking if you want to join the brunch plans we just made. Since you seem to be living in outer space.”
Jo hugs him, then Cas, and takes Dean’s jungle juice from his hand to take a sip. “I’ve been well, Sir Gabriel, and you? Castiel tells me that y’all literally met each other at your own parents’ wedding this summer. That has to be a traumatic story.”
“I still believe that I was dressed appropriately,” Cas interjects grumpily, sitting down. “It was a party and those were my party clothes.”
“Ah, men. The root of love and romance, as they say. Just kidding, nobody says that. Where are the
Cas smiles and rubs a thumb gently over his cheek. “Me too. I just… I wanted to tell you something.”
“Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not some farcical French fry ceremony,” Cas says drily, reaching for his water glass.
Dean still feels a twinge in his heart and his left knee whenever he thinks about soccer. He spent the summer recovering from his surgery and readjusting to the thought of a life in which his whole identity wasn’t practice and games. He’s glad that his buds from the team are still keeping him in the loop and inviting him to all the team events. This morning they even texted him about joining their pregame for 6:01, the kickoff party of the year that happens when the required dry syllabus week ends at 6:00 PM on Saturday night, but he still hasn’t decided if he’s going to go. It’s over a week away, so he has some time.

“That was
He turns the knob to a new room with the same Star Wars poster on the wall and mezuzah in the door frame as last year. The lights are off and he doesn’t bother to turn them on, sitting on the bed and toe-ing off his shoes. This is going to be quick, and sloppy, and drunk, and he’s not going to think about it right now, or maybe ever, because if he thinks about it then it’s real and if it’s real then there’s going to be even more thinking and
Dean looks at Charlie, feeling helpless. She winks. “Sounds like y’all have a great trip ahead of you,” she says. “Now, would anyone like to come inside with me for a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie?”
Benny grins. “Dean, I know you too well for that. And because I know you and because I love you, I am one hundred percent sure that you would only call me if you were in crisis. And, to be clear, I don’t mind that – I’m here for you, brother. So what’s the crisis?”
“If only.”
“The time you what?” In the doorway stands a tall, slender woman with blonde curls and warmly dimpled smile. “I don’t know, Sam, sounds like a story I probably want to hear.”
He can’t stop smiling as they walk, even though Cas is asking him some surprisingly complicated questions about his thesis plans, and then they’re at Dean’s dorm room and he fumbles with unlocking the door and relocking it behind them and then finally, finally, he shuts Cas up the way he’s been dying to all night.
“Well if you ever want to hang out, I’m around,” says Dean. “Not sure if you heard, but I’m a jock without a flock anymore. Got a lot of time on my hands these days.”
“Castiel, where’s the bathroom?” Jo asks, gesturing to Anna.
Gabe’s grin takes up his entire face. “Alright, Dean Winchester! That’s my guy! Now, would you be a dear and fetch me a sugar packet for my coffee? It’s a little bit too bitter.”
“Oh yeah? Which ladies? Last I heard, you were barely holding on to a halfway hookup situation with Lisa Braeden, and that was almost a year ago.”
Castiel blinks, hard. “Are you not hungover? Are you not wildly and terribly hungover?”
Dean laughs. “Oh, yeah, you’re totally welcome to drive up to Palo Alto with me and crash in my little brother’s dorm room for the weekend.”
They make their way over to where Dean is parked in the student lot. Cas scans the Toyotas in the lot. “Which one is you?” Dean points. Cas’s eyes bug out. “
The first couple of weeks back on campus pass in a blur of high temperatures, short shorts, and slowly increasing anxiety about the semester ahead. Though it has only been a few days and he hasn’t even been to class yet, Dean is beginning to regret the courses that he picked for his senior fall semester. Surprisingly, it isn’t even his thesis that’s stressing him out, despite being a last minute Psych major (switching from his initial Econ declaration back when he was a freshman). No, mostly he’s worried about how to fill his time this year without soccer.
They walk around downtown Palo Alto for a few hours, checking out an old bookstore, a magic shop, and an Apple store in rapid succession. They finish with a few scoops of ice cream at a smaller storefront, and Dean delights in covering his with as many sprinkles as he can find in the self-serve station. Castiel, for his part, orders a child’s serving of coffee flavor. “I can’t handle sugar,” he says in response to Dean’s questioning look. “Last time I had a regular scoop of ice cream, several people ended up dead.” Dean is ninety percent sure he’s joking.
On second thought, no, God, no, this is not a boy but a man. Dean takes in the ruffled dark hair and piercing blue eyes atop a lanky, muscular runner’s frame. The man is wearing khaki-colored hiking shorts and a t-shirt that reads, “GISHWHES! Join The Hunt!” Somehow, it still doesn’t take away from his quietly powerful energy.
Dean frowns and pulls up a Safari window on his phone. He types Castiel’s name into the search bar and clicks on the first result. Apparently Castiel is a Biblical name and refers to the angel of Thursdays. Go figure. Dean hadn’t even balked at the name after meeting a girl named Mystical Raine in his Pitzer pottery class freshman spring.
“You really shouldn’t be so surprised, Dean. Gabriel and Joanna tell me that we have many things in common.”
Dean sighs and rolls over far enough to be able to look Cas in those baby blue black holes. “What? I’m trying to fall asleep after getting laid by this extremely hot guy I know.”
Ellen leaves them there, with their eyes locked across the bike shop window and elbows rooted to the narrow plank next to the cash register. They’re at attempt number five to arm wrestle, continuing to tie and then break the ties, when they are suddenly interrupted.
“It looks like one of your bolts failed,” he tells Cas. “That’s a pretty easy fix. I may just need a day or so since there are some other customers ahead of you.” Cas looks relieved.
“My own brother? My own blood? Betraying me like this? You wound me, Sam.”
“Welcome,” Cas greets them. He’s wearing a pair of blue sweatpants and a tan bathrobe with another old t-shirt. Dean feels a blast of dry, deliciously cold air from the room behind him. “Please, make yourselves comfortable.”
“Hasn’t hit yet. I think I’m maybe still a little drunk. Although, truth be told, it’s wearing off fast if my stomach is any indication.”
In between, of course, were the women – Rhonda Hurley in high school, who was the first to let Dean embrace any kind of feminine side when she convinced him to wear a pair of her satiny silk panties to third period calc. After, they had to leave school early to fuck in Dean’s car because he was too horny to wait. There had been numerous one night stands and flings, and then of course his on-again, off-again relationship with Lisa Braeden from sophomore spring to junior fall.
“Yeah, like, is he even into that, or…?”
“Dean, my love, you don’t have to be like this. Have a little patience with Daddy Gabe.”
“Jo, you wound me. Lisa and I were an entire hookup situation.”
“Sorry about that, just my instinct to use shorthand. I love a nickname,” Dean jokes, trying to lighten Castiel’s somber expression. Jo looks between them, as unsure as Dean of what is happening. She waits a beat, but nothing changes.
Jess smiles kindly. “It’s okay,” she says. “You and your boyfriend are cute. I can tell you care a lot about each other.”
“Like I drank an entire liquor store.”
By the time Gabriel drops Dean back off at his dorm, thoughts of the library long forgotten, he’s feeling much more normal and even excited about the semester ahead. They had overstayed their welcome at Norms to brainstorm a list of movies that could potentially be fun for movie nights. Tonight would be National Treasure, and Cas even offered to host. The promise of a good movie and a non-sports-related social event is apparently all it takes to put a pep in Dean’s step, because he feels downright jovial as he unlocks his door and drops his backpack on the desk chair. He slides his phone out of his pocket and texts Sam.
Movie night quickly turns into Dean’s favorite part of the week. As the oppressive heat of August melts into the long nights of September and then slowly dissolves into the slightly cooler days of October, they make their way through both National Treasures, the entire Twilight Saga (with much complaining from Dean and Gabriel, though Jo tells them that it sounds insincere), and a brief flirtation with the Bourne series.
Dean lets out a high pitched panic noise, but then sees Benny smirking. “You jackass,” he mutters, kicking Benny under the table. “I’m trying to have a crisis here.”
“Well, I am uniquely talented. It’s these magic hands that the ladies just can’t stop talking about.”
Cas joins him, blinking as he takes off his sunglasses. “Does it smell like a place of higher learning to you?” he says to Dean, sniffing the air. “We don’t seem to have this scent back in Claremont.”
“’Tis merely a flesh wound,” Dean mumbles, sinking further down in his seat. “Don’t talk to me.”
“Take this off,” Cas huffs in his ear, tugging on his formal-wear shirt. “And these too.” Cas himself leans back and takes his trench coat off sleeve by sleeve, throws it somewhere in the corner, and Dean has to stop everything he’s doing to watch his strip tease fantasy come to life. Cas unbuttons his shirt astonishingly quickly, revealing the strong muscles and soft skin that have filled Dean’s thoughts for weeks now, and then reaches down to unzip his slacks. This time, instead of stopping at his boxers, he pulls those off too, and suddenly Cas is naked and on top of him and looking down at him hungrily.
In front of him is a standard-issue freshman dorm room. On each side he sees a desk in the far corner, then a twin extra-long bed along the wall, and dressers closest to the door. Sam and Brady have put up what looks like an extremely cheap Target shower curtain down the center of the room, which Sam is explaining to Cas now. Cas’ brow is furrowed, probably because Dean had kind of made it sound like they were going to be staying in a two-room suite with a private bathroom.
Chapter 1:
“Hello from a soccer guy,” says a ketchup-soaked Gabriel. “I love a little GNI. Girls’ Night In, Cassie, don’t make that face.”
He deletes the exclamation point after a moment of thought and then hits send.
“You said the chains came off while you were riding it?” he asks the customer, a gangly girl with glasses who seems like she couldn’t have identified the chains if they bit her on the face.
Dean would like to disappear now, fully, just cease to exist, turn into a ghost and never ever revisit this conversation. He squirms. For a moment, there’s just the sound of Benny quietly sipping his coffee.
Not like Sam is going to notice, though – he and Jess have been unable to look away from each other since the first round of shots. Dean’s actually not sure if they can physically see outside of their private little love tunnel anymore.
Cas, a raspberry seltzer in his own hand, sits on the loveseat as well. Their thighs are almost touching and Dean has to lean hard on the couch’s armrest to avoid pressing his shoulder to Castiel’s. It makes the drinking harder and also, for some reason, more urgent.
Dean lets out a big breath. “I’ll swing through,” he says. “No guarantees.”
impressed by this development. “Damn, dude, you know cars? She’s a ’67, but you were pretty close.”
“Do you have any beer? If not, a seltzer is fine.”
“I kind of hoped you wouldn’t remember the cuddling.”
“You about ready to go as soon as we finish?” Dean asks Cas, picking up his latte for a sip and following it with a bite of eggs and toast.
“Executive decision, it’s one dude with the last name Norms,” Gabriel decrees, lifting a French fry in fake salute.
Dean whistles. Riding to Mount Baldy is an uphill journey, and even though the sun has only been up for a couple of hours, the temperature is already well on its way to surpassing a hundred degrees. “Well,” he says, “this should be an easy fix. If you sign this form, you can actually leave it here with us and we’ll return it to the gym when we’re done.”
They dance until all of the alcohol hits Dean in full and he feels like there are ocean waves crashing behind his eyes. He mumbles into Cas’ ear that he wants some water and Cas turns around, concerned, and props him up as they maneuver out of the crowd. Back in the kitchen, Cas sits him on a stool and pours him a glass of ice water from the fridge. Sam and Jess are long gone, probably catching up with one of the many groups that Dean can see spread across the patio outside.
Dean winces, not wanting to wander down those well-traveled paths in his mind. He tries to shake himself out of it, but the thoughts keep coming – Mary, hooked up to tubes and machines in the hospital that once employed her. Sam, barely old enough to understand what was happening, watching his mother suffer. And then the funeral and the endless days of grey, grey, grey.
Dean stares at him. “You, uh, would?”
in the weirdest, most intimate way.
“Who’s next?” he asks boldly, folding an elbow behind his head to show off the six-pack he still has from soccer. “Ladies? Or… Castiel?”
“Don’t fucking say you and Jess.”
Finally, they make it to North Quad. Light spills out of all of the rooms on the first floor of Green – its residents are all soccer players, and each room holds a different themed drink. Dean gazes around, feeling soft, feeling warm, remembering that he loves these people, even if he doesn’t like them all the time. He bumps every fist he is presented with, passing out high fives like candy. He feels so good, so fucking good, remembering how fun alcohol is, but also a little bit thirsty and maybe there’s more to drink somewhere?
“She’s coming,” Sam says with the tension of a man about to enter a war. “She just said she’s coming over now. Dean, don’t be weird, okay? Don’t be fucking weird and don’t say anything about that one time I—”
“I mean, it’s definitely been busy,” Sam said. “There’s a ton of orientation stuff, and then I’m also starting the actual content of all my classes and trying to keep up now that syllabus week is over. Plus, I met some cool guys down my hall and we’ve been hanging out a bunch.”
“Ladies,” he says, bowing. “Your beverages have arrived.” Anna rushes over and starts excitedly unloading the bag. Anna isn’t legal yet – as a sophomore, she still depends on her older girlfriend to buy her drinks for pregaming. Of course, Jo happily obliges.
Of course, the whole thing ended up being irrelevant when he took a bad fall against Chapman and ripped through his ACL. A surgery and several months later, the choice to quit soccer had been made for him and he still had absolutely no regrets. It wasn’t like he was planning to go professional or anything, so all it really did was decrease the stockpile of cash that John’s parents had left for Sam and Dean when they died.
While Cas gets up to refill his and Dean’s water glasses and, with a pleading look from Dean, grab another slice of pie, Charlie also tells Dean about how she met Cas at freshman orientation when he wore a full-length trench coat to a party at her dorm. Her description of it has Dean in stitches by the time Castiel returns, pie in hand.
Oh no! There is Only One Bed! ;)
“Whoa. Dude. Did you just quote Holy Grail? You? Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail?” Dean asks, more than a little bit surprised. One side of Cas’ mouth quirks up into a slight grin.
Dean wakes up slowly, feeling like he’s floating on the calmest sea. He feels so warm, so secure, but can’t quite remember why. He breathes deeply and smells a floral shampoo and Dove soap. That makes sense, because he’s definitely spooning someone. What happened last night? He tries to remember through the haze of alcohol and late night eyes what exactly he did. He was drunk, and then Cas—
Dean is about to answer when suddenly a red-haired girl with a Yoda backpack and a Harry Potter t-shirt appears beside their table. “Castiel, a rare sighting in the wild,” she says, patting him fondly on the head. She turns to Dean. “I do not believe that I have made your acquaintance, sir. What may I call you?”
“What?”
“Anyway, any chance you’d want to meet up at the diner sometime this week? I’d sure love to see you and give you a proper apple pie send-off before you go.”
“Dean,” she says finally, looking at Dean with a gravity that Dean isn’t sure he has ever seen before, “you know that you can tell me anything, right? I care about you. And I’ll always care about you.”
They pull up outside of a beautiful, Spanish-style dorm building sometime in the early afternoon. Dean pulls into a parking spot and lets out a sigh then subsequent groan as he stretches his creaky legs out and swings out of the driver’s seat into the bright sunshine of the Palo Alto afternoon. Walking around the back to lean against the trunk, he shoots a quick text to Sam letting him know that they’ve arrived.
Anna comes to the first few, but her attendance drops off as her practice schedule intensifies. Meg fills in when she can, but most often it’s just Dean, Jo, Gabe, and Cas, popping seltzers and sharing trays of dining hall fries. They return to Cas’ suite through Eclipse but bring Breaking Dawn, Part 1 to Jo’s when Cas tells them that his suitemate needs the space for a few weeks. Dean, remembering the orgies, doesn’t ask any follow-up questions.
“Oh, yeah, sure. I love brunch. Love those… eggs,” he says helplessly, frantically trying to remember how he usually strings together a sentence. “Listen, it was great to see you all, but I have to go. I have a, uh, thing.”
“Eh brother, half-brother, step-brother, fraternity brother, it all feels the same.”
Cas wheels around on Dean as the door closes behind them. “I’m ready
Despite having to navigate these extreme challenges, before he knows it, Dean is packing up for the drive home to Kansas for Thanksgiving. He’s planning to spend a whole week back home, even though Sammy is only flying in for a couple of days, and spend some time seeing the friends who are like family around Lawrence. He knows that he’ll be back for winter break, but after that, he might end up anywhere. He wants to take advantage of this time while he has it.
Dean, in fact, has not thought about that. That is a wildly new angle for the son of John Winchester, who had strong feelings about homosexuality and made them known from the moment Dean was old enough to understand the slurs. He thinks for a moment. Okay, maybe not a crisis. Maybe it’s okay. Maybe it’s a… good thing?
Dean and Cas have been so patient, but now it's finally time to ~ruin the friendship~.......
“Castiel is a Psych major too,” Jo explains, stealing two full handfuls of fries from Gabe’s plate while he’s distracted by the conversation. “And you’re both advised by Jody, and you both like biking and sometimes go to that theology club and attend all of the free film screenings on campus. It’s kind of surprising that you haven’t run into each other before.”
“Dean, would you grab the hairspray from the bathroom?” Jo asks, concentrating fiercely. “And the comb that’s in there, please.”
“Hello,” Cas nods to Dean. “I was wondering if you could help me with my bike. Jo told me last spring that there was a bike shop on campus, but I didn’t have a chance to visit before the end of the semester. I’ve been riding my brother’s bike all summer, but I really need mine back so I can lead the freshman orientation bike tours.”
“Yeah, that’s what I was going to say.”
Sam stays on the phone with Dean for long enough that the dining hall starts to fill up with students from across the colleges, growing noisy and bustling. He tells Dean about his classes, his roommate Brady, the parties he’s going to, and the clubs he wants to join. It makes Dean ache a little bit, thinking about how Sam has the whole world in front of him. Right now he’s saying that he wants to be pre-med and become an oncologist to help families like theirs, and Dean knows that if he decides he wants to do that, he absolutely will.
Aside from his one hurried text conversation with Sam, Dean has done very little planning for this trip. Mostly what he’s done is ask himself whether it’s weirder to share Brady’s bed with Cas or Sam’s bed with Sam. He’s certainly shared plenty of beds with Sam before, so he’s leaning towards that option, though his memory of certain Sam-related gaseous odors puts him off the idea just a touch. The floor suddenly seems incredibly inviting.
“Dean, have you ever heard the term ‘bisexual?’ It means that you can like women and also maybe still have a crush on Castiel.”
His advisor, a stern but lovable professor named Jody Mills with a surprisingly butch haircut and relaxed attitude for the generally conservative Claremont McKenna College, pushed him to “take it easy” in his class picks for this fall. “You don’t need to prove yourself, Dean,” she had said last spring, staring him down while he fidgeted with the laptop on his lap. “Punish yourself either. Sometimes you can just enjoy things.”
Bobby rolls his eyes fondly. “Alright, ya idjit. Can’t say I missed this disrespect.”
“Well what are you doing instead? How’s school? How come you don’t have time to call the man who raised you and let him know you’re safe?”
“Dean, you just told me to bring an outfit for a party,” Cas argues heatedly. “You didn’t tell me what kind of party, and these are the only clothes I have, so I’m wearing them.”
Sam has armchair diagnosed him with social anxiety, but Dean still hears his father’s voice in his head whenever he thinks about trying to find a therapist. Therapy is for weak-minded people, John would say, then a note of pride in his voice as he added on, “Not for my boys.” The conversation used to come up often when Dean’s mom was in treatment, as the months stretched into years and the endless hope soured into denial, anger, and finally acceptance.
Cas’ face, which now has an indiscernible expression on it as he takes in Dean’s gaze. “Dean,” he begins, his face softening, but Dean isn’t ready for that.
But tonight. It’s Mistletoe. ‘Tis the damn season.
This is the drug that keeps him coming back to this underclassman with a sweet smile and a soft brunette cowlick, the high that made him drink enough to make this okay every few weeks last semester; seeing this sturdy, powerful man turn soft and vulnerable beneath him. Aaron sucks wet kisses into Dean’s neck, biting down just a little like he knows Dean likes, until Dean gives in and lets Aaron take over.
“What I say is, I miss you, man! Stanford got you so busy that you can’t call?” Sam’s semester had started a week before Dean left Kansas to come back to Claremont, which had also been part of the motivation for his volunteering to work freshman orientation at the bike shop. Without Sam around, there really wasn’t much to do in an already boring hometown.
, Sammy?”
They hang up, agreeing that Dean will text Benny to schedule once he knows more about his plans with Sam and Bobby this week. Dean leans back into the pillows and sighs. He doesn’t know why he put that off for so long, doesn’t know why he hasn’t reached out to Benny for two full years when Benny has never been anything but good to him.
He almost physically runs into Sam in the hallway. “Sorry about that,” he mutters.
They slide into their seats in the booth and give their orders to Dean’s favorite waitress, Cathy, who takes their menus, brings back hot coffees and glasses of water, and mouths to Dean, “I’ll bring extra pie.” Then she’s gone and Dean is suddenly alone with Benny.
“Jo! It’s Jo!” Gabriel exclaims gleefully, seeing their friend in the doorway. “Jo, my sweet beautiful kumquat, how have you been? I’ve missed you in the training room.”
“Well, Dean Winchester, is okay if I interrupt your private dinner hour with Castiel? This ol’ boy hasn’t been answering my calls lately and I think he might be cheating on me.”
Ah, this. This is what Dean knew would happen if he had tried to reach out during the whole soccer spiral and even over the last couple of months with Cas. He wasn’t ready for it then, but he thinks he might be now. “Um. I, um, have a friend.” He takes the biggest gulp of water he can.
“Benny! I can’t believe you picked up.”
Dean snorts. “Sure, National Treasure. Another stalwart American classic.”
In the doorway stands Castiel. His hair looks somehow even thicker and darker than usual, which is making his eyes shine even brighter. He’s dressed in a slim cut white button-down and grey slacks, with his famed tan trench coat on top. Forgetting himself, Dean lets his gaze wander across the tightly fitted fabric of the white shirt and admires the length of Cas’ legs in those slacks. Clearing his throat, he adjusts his legs and leans back before arranging his features into more of a judgmental scowl.
The door swings open and Dean barely has a chance to register the flash of light from the hallway before it swings shut again, plunging them into darkness, and then there’s a body in his lap and hands in his hair and a mouth on his neck and he moans because it’s so fucking good and because against his absolute best judgment, he missed this a little bit. His hands find hips and he grinds into them, hard, then flips them over so that they’re lying on the bed together.
“It was hard to forget.”
As the afternoon stretches into evening, Dean feels his last anxieties about this trip dissolve. So what if he’s a little bit achey from a night on the dorm room floor? His people are safe and happy, and he is high from the constant input of sugary foods and, dare he say, love. Like, love for his brother. And friend love. Not, like, romantic love. Gross.
Dean ruts up against Cas and they slide against each other, sweaty and hot and panting. “Cas,” he groans, closing his eyes tightly as Cas begins a punishing pace, building the friction between them. And then – holy shit – he feels Cas wrap a loose hand around their dicks, feels that cool dry palm in the one place he hasn’t felt it yet, and can’t help but start pushing his own hips into it as well. He squeezes his eyes shut, so fucking close, and then hears Cas’ gravelly voice in his ear again, telling him to cum, telling him that he’s so good, such a good boy for him, and suddenly he can’t hold on a second longer.
After delivering the required tools, Dean sits down on Jo’s bed and takes a sip from his vodka cranberry. It burns its way down his throat and he starts to relax a little bit, feeling comforted by the soft coziness of Jo’s dorm room. He leans back and begins chatting with Anna, getting his update on all the rugby gossip. As always, there’s a lot of it – apparently Claire broke up with her girlfriend in August and is now pursuing a straight girl from her major while Krissy is hopelessly obsessed with a freshman who won’t give her the time of day.
“I love you, Dean Winchester.”
Jo turns and bows to him. “An honor and a privilege to help you rejoin the living, Sir Winchester.”
Jo is in his other ear, reiterating, “Dean, you gotta show Castiel your room. Do you know that he hasn’t seen it? You need to go, show him, he needs to see it.”
“Can’t wait to drive six hours in the bright, bright sun.”
Dean is sitting with Jo on the Pitzer Mounds when he first brings it up. It’s just about a week after Fall Break, and Dean has spent the last few days diving back into all of the homework that he ignored while he and Cas were in the Bay. After arriving back in Claremont, Dean had finally received a text from Sam confirming that yes, he was alive, and yes, he and Jess were a thing now. Sam also noted that yes, he was planning to cut alcohol out of his life, maybe forever. Dean agreed.
“Uhhh, Castiel,” she says, turning to him and trying to disrupt the awkward silence, “Do you want to go get brunch with me? Pitzer dining hall is open for another hour or so and I know you like their omelettes. Plus, that’ll give Dean some time to get started on your bike.”
Dean has been sipping on a foul concoction of whiskey and peppermint schnapps, so he is only too happy to take a tequila shot. Jo carefully pours some salt in his hand and then hands out lime wedges all around, and Dean makes direct eye contact with Cas and winks before licking the salt, throwing back the shot, and biting down on the lime. Cas looks perplexed.
“Don’t stop,” he mumbles over and over like a prayer as Cas makes his way lazily down to Dean’s neck, sucks in bruising hickeys that he knows his friends will make fun of tomorrow, but he is definitely not thinking about that now.
“I’d love to, Dean. You name the time and place. Aside from helping Mama with the cooking, I have next to nothing on the calendar.”
Dean feels his heartbeat speed up. “I’m straight,” he says. Jo seems unconvinced. “No really,” he tries again. “I like women.”
“Though it is not the pinnacle of cinematic accomplishment, I would still recommend a viewing,” says Cas. “Especially for the queer symbolism.”
“Sure,” Dean replies, backing out of the circle and edging out the door. “See you guys later!”
Benny grins. “Now that’s what we like to hear.”
“Um, hello?” the voice asks, surprisingly deep for a college student. Jo turns around.
Which brings him back into himself and he sits up, arm still slung around the back of Cas’ neck, bottom half soaked in tequila, and leans against his chest as he smiles over at their friends, happy and drunk. “Finally,” Gabe whistles. “Y’all have been holding onto that one for too long.”
“Do you want to know just how many dicks I’ve seen today?”
Fuck.
“Nice to meet you both. I’m Balthazar, owner and operator of Halo.” Dean just nodded, looking around at the sea of people. Oh fucking shit, they hadn’t even thought – what if someone they knew was at the club??
- Masturbation
“Dean, I don’t understand –” Castiel was numb, every nerve ending denying the fact he was being rejected by an omega that was his perfect equal.
Seeing Cas exit his house, and walk towards the car always made Deans heart speed up. Opening the door, Cas grinned as he ducked inside.
“So, a little birdy told me you went on a date.” Benny, the big, squishy alpha brute, laughed at Deans scowl, and thumped him hard on the back. The car he was working on rocked in place, and Dean shot a hand out to steady it. Benny forgot his strength sometimes, but it did come in handy working at the garage. There weren’t many alphas around, and for that, Dean was thankful. Betas just didn’t go as crazy around a male omega as alphas, and lucky for him, Benny was already mated.
“We are in the middle of a
The contractions had been slowly increasing in pace and intensity, until they were less than a handful of minutes apart. Dean knew that meant the baby would be making an appearance soon. Which was lucky, because Dean had pretty much reached his point of coping. Cas was pretty much the only thing keeping him going, that, and meeting their baby.
Dean hoped the alpha he was meeting didn’t have the wrong idea. Male omegas were rare, and alphas literally
“Oh, I remember you, alright.” Cas stuttered and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Dude, you were my first, everyone remembers their first.” Probably not quite the right thing to say, because Cas paled and pretty much collapsed onto the chair behind him.
Turned out, his parents were all for the idea, mainly because Cas said he’d take care of Dean and Link, because they were his responsibility.
Very quickly, more than anyone would give an omega credit for, Dean formulated a plan. It wasn’t very safe, but it was all he could do at such short notice. Keeping his eyes on the figure down the beach, Dean made his way back to the others.
As his muscles began to bunch, he straightened his back and pushed, feeling first one tiny shoulder, then the next, emerge into the world. Gravity, his friend through the whole process, helped him with the rest.
Dean’s heart exploded in his chest. He couldn’t even parse out what exactly he was feeling, everything was intertwined with his omegas overwhelming need to nurture and to protect.
“Can you – can you just hold me? Please?” Dean choked back a sob, throat burning with the shear effort of holding back his howls of devastation. How was it fair?
“Can’t wait, Cas.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean heard an affirmative grunt from somewhere near his elbow and decided that must have been where Cas ended up after they crashed into their sex induced comas. “Before we started, were you gonna say something?” Dean felt Cas still beside him, before a pair of blue eyes peeked out from their soft confines.
“There’s no point in us hanging around here. Let’s – let’s get back to the bunker. Regroup.” He wasn’t looking at Sam, but he could feel his brothers stare. Thankfully, Sam had the sense not to question him.
Dean frowned,
are you – are you ok? Where are you? Is your baby…?” Sam sounded so damn hopeful, and scared, all at the same time.
his windshield was broken, when it hit him all at once.
the rock was a whole lot harder than climbing up. He almost broke his legs when he fell the last few feet, but he stumbled into a roll at the last minute. Brushing himself off, Dean started in the direction of where he saw, hopefully, the Sam shaped pile of human.
Dean watched Hendrickson as he raised his hand, palm up waiting for just the right moment. A break in the gunfire had Hendrickson sweep his hand downwards, signalling their advance forward.
Cas sounded so embarrassed, Dean only
“Sam, you’re tall as fuck, go up there and see if you can see anyone else.” Dean waved his hand towards a slight hill; it looked like a good vantage point.
He knew Cas would freak out if he woke up and Dean wasn’t there, so with some effort, he managed to wake his sleepy alpha, and coax him out of their little nest.
He gave the signal that he was ready, and Benny swung open the door.
“I think we have to do it quick, I mean, look at him,” They both looked over at Cas, who had his eyes closed and was visibly shaking against the pillar. “I just – I don’t know how it’s gonna go, ok? I haven’t done anything like it before, and there is like,
“You alright, Dean?” He looked majorly concerned, and Dean didn’t fool himself into thinking he actually cared about anything but his ability to work. Dean just nodded quickly and forced a smile.
No one else seemed to be sick, though, so at least that was something. Maybe only he got the piece that was bad. Pretty fucking par for the course, really.
“Can I – can I ask why?” Castiel’s voice wavered just that little bit, and so did Deans resolve. In just one night they had found their perfect partners, and Dean was about to shatter that into a million, unsalvageable pieces.
Very soon, Dean felt the tell tale signs of Cas’ knot. The thick, ridged skin sliding in and out of his slick, aching hole had him tensing in a whole other way.
he hoped he wasn’t blushing as hard as he thought he was, because it probably looked like he was having a stroke. But his
“I would like nothing more than for you to go without, Dean, but I worry about the other alphas on the island.” Cas looked so concerned, it twisted something in Deans chest. Fuck, he’d only known the guy for a little over a day, and he was already getting feelings for him. It went against everything Dean had thought before being effectively stranded on the island, but he supposed that was what happened when you found your mate in such outstanding circumstances. Things took on a different light, when your life was in danger.
had triggered a spontaneous rut.
“All good, man. Uh, I’m Dean, by the way. This here’s Chuck.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ignore the mess of a napkin sitting in front of him.
As the months dragged by… what little hope he had, fled with the angel that had taken his heart with him.
it hurt.
The cave was silent while Gabriel poked what was going to be their breakfast with a stick, before announcing it was ready. Dean looked at his lump of blackened, slightly charred root with disdain. It had to be the ugliest piece of food he’d ever seen. Cas watched him as he brought it to his mouth, and gingerly took a bite.
Mary and Dean both looked up when they heard a noise by the door. Sam, with his big puppy dog eyes, fiddled with his sleeve and kicked the door. Mary patted Dean on the back and kissed his head, because she knew the brothers needed time to themselves.
“After our
some people thought male omegas were below everyone else. Everyone else accepted them for whom and what they were, hell, most people saw it as a miracle that a dude could give birth, but some people… They chose to hold on to the archaic belief that male omegas were the devils invention, only put on earth to tempt good men from their wives. They distorted those old world views, into something disgusting, evil and modern, taking omegas and using them for their own nefarious purposes.
(See the end of the chapter for
The drive back to Lawrence was long and tense. Despite the phone call home, Dean really didn’t know what to expect. Would his parents be mad? Would they treat him differently?
Back to mono syllables then, that was fine, Dean was having trouble talking too.
As always, warnings are at the bottom, so yay!
“You did good tonight, Sammy.” Dean looked in the rear vision mirror, and saw his brother grin in embarrassment.
“You – you can’t
Huh he hadn't thought of that, well how progressive of him.
“Well, I’m gonna be blunt.” Dean felt Cas’ hand at the base of his spine, and he relaxed into the feeling. Having his mate there really did help. He was grown up enough to appreciate support when it came his way. “There’s a group of alphas roaming around on this island, looking for an omega -.” Dean watched the group nod, some dawning comprehension fluttering across Gadreels face.
with Cas exactly what they were going to be doing, Dean had the feeling he didn’t have to.
Sam didn’t let him drive, much to his disgust, but he saw the point. His baby was pretty much the only nice thing he had left, and he wanted to keep it that way.
“Hey, Cas. Nah, no problem. Are you pumped for this movie or what?” They were going to see The Maze Runner 2, which looked pretty awesome. Plus, it had his second favourite character from Teen Wolf in it, a major bonus. He smiled at the chick running the ticket booth, and she blushed back.
“Are you alright?” Dean shivered when Cas’ breath caressed his ear, and he nodded, experimentally swivelling his hips and earning a sharp intake of breath from the alpha. “I’m – I’m not going to last very long, I’m afraid.” Dean snorted, because by the state of his own throbbing, dribbling cock, neither would he. He simply answered with another swivel of his hips. Cas’ growled quietly, taking Deans indication of his readiness literally by the hips, before drawing out and easing back in.
“Wow, did you two meet on the cruise? Because that’s an intense reaction right there.” Dean rolled his eyes, because it would have been a pretty awesome moment, if not for the beta sitting right next to the posturing alpha.
apart.
He wasn’t sure who surged forwards first, but the enthusiasm Cas showed when their lips met sparked a fire in Deans belly. They couldn’t do much with Cas’ head gear in the way, but Dean made sure to make it the best damned kiss of his life. He nibbled on his bottom lip, making Cas gasp in surprise. Cas opened his mouth, inviting Deans tongue in to tussle with his own. Dean groaned into the kiss as Cas gently nipped and bit Deans lips, proving himself a lot better than Dean had expected.
