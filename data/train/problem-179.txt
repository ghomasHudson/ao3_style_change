John's brows knit in befuddlement and mild offence as he snatched up the stack of untouched napkins and contemplated walking over to swat the consulting detective with them. Deciding to forgo addressing why he was given the matronly role in this whole ludicrous fantasy he instead could not help getting a kick out of seeing the other man so unguarded and outright silly. "God, Sherlock,” he apprized the other, “you know there was a whole bottle of Rum in there, right?"
He was rewarded by Sherlock lowering his mouth, lips parting and wrapping them around the head of his cock. John groaned, his hand’s fisting tightly into the bed sheets as he fought to not force the other man’s head on him as he so desperately wanted to do.
He must have hesitated a moment too long, for his flat mate eagerly cut him off. “The time of day is of no consequence, John.”
John didn't ask before scaling the close knit buildings to garner a better view, yet he too returned empty handed, without a clue as to where the woman had gone.  At least this was more of lead than they had gotten at the other two places.  The woman had clearly understood what he was looking for and she had used his attention to the others to make her escape.  They would need to return the following evening to follow up on this, perhaps they had found a Talmasca or rogue Talmasca meeting point.
"Don't be dull." Moriarty emphasized the statement with a dramatic roll of his eyes. He snapped his fingers and Sherlock was slapped violently across the cheek by his own rogue hand. The detective staggered with the surprise of the blow more than the force, though his cheek stung and eyes watered as the pain intensified around his swollen nose.
"That's not what I meant..." Her voice never reached his ears as he strode away from the cold concrete walls of Bart's.
They moved together, Sherlock thrusting against him and John rocking himself back, their cries mingling as they panted and groaned. He could feel Sherlock’s lips move against his skin, even as no words came out.
“Christ…” Armand hissed, his head falling back, as his whole body suddenly went limp except the proud erection that remained wet and ready for more attention. Louis couldn’t hold back a triumphant chuckle at the spectacle of his lover. He wallowed in the feeling of power he possessed in their dynamic.
Sherlock stood outside the back doors of Bart’s hospital and blew out a stream of smoke through his lips.  Beside him the mousy woman waved the smoke that drifted her way from her face with a desperate swatting motion, coughing in irritation to the cigarette’s pungent aroma.  It was cold outside and she had not grabbed her jacket before stepping out the small back exit with the detective for a break from their joint work.  She had her tiny arms wrapped tightly about herself, her hands tightly clenched in fists.  The detective groaned derisively and shed his long wool jacket, hating the social law that bade him to offer it to her more than the actual act of giving it up.  He wasn’t cold.  Far from it.
He propelled himself up into the sky using his cloud gift, disappearing into the darkness of night and the glare of the city lights. The night air was warm, especially above the metropolitan area, and he reveled in the way the air whipped at his curls and ruffled the cassock, as he flew unseen by the mortals below.
John must have still appeared apprehensive, for the detective’s shoulders straightened as his hands found his hips and gave a very exasperated sigh.  “You know I wish not to leave you here unattended.  The consequences would be dire for both you and the hapless fool that finds you.  We can co-exist together, John.  Why do you think I have been laboring so hard to experiment with our proximity?  This can work, if you just trust me.”
“You mean, you didn’t like finding them snogging on the couch.” She quipped, a wicked grin on her mouth.
Without even turning to address the man that had cornered him at the end of the hallway outside his door Louis was surprised to have his nostrils assaulted by another wave of the dreadfully tempting smell of fresh blood.  This was not mingled with bleach or water.  The alluring smell beckoned to his taste buds and palette, as potent as a pregnant woman's hormones induced insatiable cravings, mingled provocatively with the sweet odor of sweat, saliva, and stress.  If Louis had not fed recently the desire to pounce on the almost seductive offering at his door may have been too much. Clenching his teeth together the vampire straightened and setting his jaw he turned in a slow trained movement to greet the tall thin detective.
John sighed again, not realizing he’d been holding it in and clenching his molars again.  He gave his face a cleansing rub with his palms as he sat straight up.  “I’m fine, really.  Just fine.”
It was a homemade water chamber, a ballistics firing range for bullet comparisons. This was what forensics used to compare the identifying bullet markings from gun barrels—or at least a smaller hastily built version of one. John had no doubt that it served its purpose. Sherlock did not skimp on research when it came to his weird little experiments.
John screwed up his nose at his friend, looking across the luxury vehicle at him like he was a nutter.  “You telepathic now, are you?”
"I'd appreciate it, John." Sherlock commented casually, seating himself and pinning his eyes on the passing scenery through the window.
John was feeling confident amongst the other coffee addicts in their presence. Things seemed easier tonight and it was extremely pleasing. Louis had promised they would return to London once everything was in order.
Red-faced and mortified the older Holmes brother was soon hidden behind the shelter of his desk. Seated in the office chair with whatever clothing he could snatch from the floor, death-gripped on his lap. A deep scowl etched into the ruddy complexion.
David leaned forward and met the mortal’s warm lips.  Gently cupping his face between his hand’s he deepened the kiss and did as the lover had instructed.
The puffins had many colonies along the high cliffs of the isles sharp rigid shoreline and Marisa would frequent each daily.  She was not just silent and stealthy, she was lithe, incredibly graceful, and surefooted.  She could clamber down natural holds in the wet cliff face to a free space where she could rest, watch, and record.  When Sherlock found her, he would watch and study her in the same way that she watched her puffins.  That was until she spotted him.  Then she would get mad and crawl back up to give him a tongue-lashing that was as incredible and it was succinct.  He did not believe these little outbursts could count as conversation.
The men both stepped back as John gave the inquisitive registrar a nod and the zipper whizzed the gaping black mouth shut to conceal the gruesome scene within. Sherlock was fixed on the white glow of his phone screen as he continued to tap away and scan the information that flashed before him.
Sherlock was impressed and he allowed John to see the sly smile that curved the corners of his mouth as a deep satisfaction and pride welled in his chest—what was the colloquialism?—it the nail on the head. Even though it was a launch into the conversation he had been unsure how to start and was even more perplexed on how he desired to end, the detective waved a hand at his partner and then back to himself, as he explained, "Not anymore, John.  I solved it whilst you were enjoying the many pleasures of courtship, both in your home and on your way here."
“John,” The name was wrenched from his throat as the detective felt an impossibly smooth cheek brush against his thigh before John nuzzled his erection. He breathed over the straining cock, tongue flicking out to lick the head as his hand continued its slow torment.
"John, are you alright?" The brunet asked.  He really knew nothing beyond what he had read in the books he had leafed through that, until recently, had been purely fiction.
With a wave of Maria's hand, the engine of the black van parked nearby roars to life. The headlights come up, bright halogen spotlighting the tableau: Sherlock’s kneeling frame casting a long shadow across the floor, the harsh blue-white beams illuminating the sharp planes of Mary’s face, making her look even more haggard, bordering on ghoulish.
“I do.” John tries to sound confident, lighthearted, but his voice cracks and breaks on the two simple words. “I truly do.”
While the sound of it serves as a reminder to John that neither one of them are exactly young these days, he can’t help but briefly take notice of the flex of Sherlock’s taut, slender obliques just above the waistband of his black trousers.
He answers the call of nature, swipes a toothbrush around his mouth, returns to the bedroom. Sherlock is still in bed, gazing at him sleepily, dark curls falling into his eyes, sheets tangled invitingly around his waist.
drop, when he feels good, doesn’t have a blank space open in him that John needs to fill with caring and kisses and reassurance.
John’s fingers don’t stop, but Sherlock can feel his breathing go shallow, rapid with anger, with rage. “Did he rape you?” he asks, over enunciating each syllable, clearly fighting to keep his voice calm and level.
Sherlock’s bare flesh is not entirely new to him, of course. John has seen him without clothing before, of course he has, doctored him on too many occasions to count, thrown him bodily into the shower on a remarkably regular basis, after misadventures involving blood and mud and much worse, but this--this is
The hallway is silent; the door does not close, and John would bet a fifty his landlady is getting an eyeful of Sherlock’s fantastic arse. And who can blame her, really?
John laughs a bit. “How did you know?” He shoves his arms inelegantly through the sleeves, allows Sherlock to snap the snaps and tie the strings and just generally properly arrange things.
Sherlock doesn’t look at John, but he can hear the ghost of a smile in his warm, deep voice. “You were correct, as usual. I was far too impaired to function well, and a decent night of sleep has restored my mental faculties. Thank you for that.”
, idiots know how to breathe, even newborns can breathe without a perky ponytailed 28-year old having to teach them.
It makes John smile. Sherlock looks up at him, then ducks his head just a little in self-consciousness.
“This is what you want, isn’t it? To be filled up full, stretched out and fucked until your arsehole is stretched open, sore and raw.” Keeping his thumb working inside Sherlock, John bends slightly, rummages briefly for the tube of slick on the night table. His thumb slips out of his opening, Sherlock hears the unmistakable click of the cap, and then the cool squelch of lube as John presses in deeper with two fingers, setting a slow, steady rhythm that makes Sherlock see stars behind the darkness of the blindfold.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock rasps. His voice is low, unsteady bass rumble, cracked and wrecked with the simmering arousal that radiates off him in waves.
Just another strange little reminder of how fractured and confused their lives have become, and as small a thing as it is, it makes John feel just that much more unsettled and unmoored.
“I promise I’ll be back in under an hour,” Sherlock declares for the third time in the past five minutes, shrugging into his suit jacket.
This was an unbelievably bad idea. John closes his eyes, tilts the glass to his lips, finishes his dregs of lager. He opens his eyes, meeting Stewart’s gaze.
“Understand, John, that everything that happened to me there was very intentional, from the beginning. Everything that happened to me was planned. Rajakovic was not some opportunist lacking in self-control.. He was a...a...” Sherlock’s face twists into something harsh, a sneer made grotesque by the low-lit shadows. “A
“Scent memories are some of the most vivid,” Sherlock says. “Conducive to recollection in a way the other senses cannot begin to match. The smell of cheap vodka is one that is, for me, particularly evocative.”
John sighs just a little, sits down in the chair opposite. He brings his own mug to his lips, blows across the surface of his tea, takes a sip of the still almost-scalding beverage before speaking.
Patty taps in her number. A ringtone chimes from the depths of her purse. She opens the bag and pulls out her phone.
“She is not your daughter, mate,” John snaps before he can think better of it. “She’s mine, and we both know it.”
Sherlock’s screams are barely muffled by the gag as entire body goes rigid, then his hips snap powerfully upwards as he begins to come. John watches, utterly transfixed, as the trapped head of Sherlock’s penis twitches and spurts two, three, four times and he’s still coming, shuddering as the waves of orgasm crash through him, weakening pulses continuing to spill from his cock, pale milky stripes abstract art against his heaving belly, on the black fabric holding him so tightly, making a perfect, shockingly lewd vision of defilement as semen drips and soaks into the fine silk lace.
It’s the absolute truth; Sherlock’s fingers are clearly unpracticed, his strokes are a little rougher than he likes, his grip not quite tight enough, but just the fact that he is here with John, doing this to him, wanting him like this, makes the pleasure coil tight and hot at the base of John’s spine.
Mary’s right arm drops heavily, the gun clattering to the floor as she collapses with a sharp, bitten-off cry. Sherlock snatches up her weapon as John thumbs on the safety of his own gun, shoves it into his coat pocket, and struggles to untie the rope around his feet.
John knows this should be an awkward, unsexy conversation. But weirdly enough, the entire situation, the awareness that he’s instructing Sherlock Holmes in how to suck his cock--John finds it deeply, powerfully arousing for reasons he can’t quite put a name to, and he finds his cock still rock-hard and very interested in the proceedings.
John has to bite down hard on his back teeth to keep from laughing out loud; his laughter is based in fond affection, not mockery, not ever mockery, but he knows it would devastate Sherlock anyway so he keeps it in through sheer force of will.
Although the procedure is not perfectly sterile (the hemostat is not new, and has to make do with a quick alcohol soak) they manage a fairly clean go of it, considering. Fortunately the wound is not as deep as it initially looked, and John is able to talk Sherlock through placing the simple interrupted stitches.
Sherlock can’t help but smile. He can picture it--John in a tattered jumper and wellies, pulling weeds, a shelter mutt of indeterminate parentage sleeping in a patch of sunlight, honeybees droning in a tangled hedgerow. He can see it all and he knows, he absolutely knows they will be happy.
The entire look gives the unmistakable impression, somehow, of a anthropomorphised and very hungry alligator, and John is clearly on the menu.
“They seem so normal,” John says several minutes later. It’s not quite what he really wants to say. He doesn’t have words yet for what he really wants to say.
“Did you get your precious photos?” he asks, tamping down his annoyance, though a bit of his impatience still bleeds through.
“Fuck, God, Sherlock,” he murmurs, the words half-muffled, “you make me crazy, you feel so good, you smell so fucking good.”
If Sherlock hears it, he doesn’t make mention. “In time,” he echoes, and wraps his hands around the sides of John’s head to bring him up for a kiss, a slow deep meeting of lips and it’s lovely, of course it is, but John can’t shake the feeling that Sherlock is deliberately distracting him from a current of something odd and worrisome underneath it all.
John shuts off his higher brain functions and kisses him; his desperate need for this man is so constant, so close to the surface it takes him over in mere moments, the kisses quickly growing wet and messy with want. Sherlock is frankly filthy; his hair is greasy and tangled, his breath stale and sour; his body is distinctly unwashed, smelling of pure sharp musky maleness, and John is shocked and a little appalled at how aroused it makes him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in annoyance. “Yes, John, because it’s not really my fortieth birthday. I am turning one hundred and sixty three and attended public school
(Later John will reflect on the fact that at this point, he had ignored his phone completely for over two weeks. What impulse, what glimmer of intuition caused him to pick up his phone the first time Sherlock texted him? He never fully embraced the idea of some kind of extracorporeal connection, some kind of psychic link between Sherlock and himself. But he could never bring himself to dismiss it entirely, either.)
John exhales sharply, his annoyance flaring unexpectedly. They’re trying to have a moment, and they’re getting in their own goddamned way again, tripping over their own metaphorical feet, and why is everything between them always so damn difficult?
Alan Turnbull, a nurse who served with John in Kandahar, is a friend of sorts but not a close one by any means. He and John texted back and forth a few times after John's return to London, had discussed meeting up for drinks but as these things happen, neither ever followed through. Yesterday, Al messaged him out of the blue and told him he was getting married shortly, girlfriend up the stump and whatnot, and invited him out to his last moment stag do. Impulsively, John had accepted the invitation, his heart still brimming with cheery, unguarded optimism over yesterday’s job offer and his tenuous reconnection with Sherlock.
Sherlock snatches up his phone from its resting place on the bedside table, swipes and taps with the controlled intensity that means he’s on the brink of a new discovery. He smirks in triumph before handing the phone to John.
“Good Lord, John. Taking you out of hospital is pushing too hard as it is. You need to rest tonight and I refuse to budge on that point. There’s little he can do to extricate herself from his situation within the next 24 hours.”
Sherlock sighs and sags a bit against the countertop. John exhales and rubs the back of his neck, his thin lips set and grim.
“And I don’t expect it stops there,” Sherlock says. “I sincerely doubt Mister Johnson has restrained himself to only one source of illegal and immoral cash flow.”
(He finds that thought weirdly, inexplicably arousing. Which means he’s at the point on this escalating staircase of carnal lust where he finds almost anything John says and does inexplicably arousing, and for the ten thousandth time in his life he marvels at the absolute improbability of his life now, that this complex and marvelous force of nature named John Watson found his way to him, found him worthwhile, found him deserving of his care and love.)
The past two days have left him reasonably certain Sherlock does desire a certain level of physical intimacy, touching and hand-holding and hair-stroking, but John also knows that for some people wanting physical closeness does not mean wanting sex, and he wonders if that is true for Sherlock, because not once in five years has the man shown any overt interest in sex at all.
The flash of disappointment on Sherlock’s face is gone in the space of a single heartbeat. “Of course,” he says smoothly. “Well, then. Thank you for the assistance. As ever, you proved quite useful.” He pivots a half-step away from John, flips up his collar, an unconscious tell of self-protection.
“Text Lestrade,” Sherlock says as he tears out pages. He rises and thrusts the sheets towards John. Suddenly aware of being thirsty, he turns on his heel, returning to his desk. He picks up his forgotten mug, swallows the last dregs of cold sweet tea. “Send him the translations,” he tells John over the rim of the mug. Tell him he wants a man named Abraham. Ex-boyfriend of Elsie’s. American. Left-handed.”
“I saw that, you know,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice a deep rumble, almost sexy, before the effect is ruined by another violent shiver.
The tired detective shakes his head, looks up to the heavens as if seeking a divine intercession from the terrible life decisions of Sherlock Holmes.
John finally takes pity on his broken mewling creature, and brings a hand to Sherlock’s stiff, leaking prick. “Is this what you need?” he murmurs into sweat-soaked curls. Sherlock shudders, almost convulsing, as John strokes him.
His lightly stubbled cheek grazed against the man’s straining erection, forcing an unintelligible sound from the man’s throat. John turned his head just enough to give it a quick kiss along the side before he began to crawl once more up the man’s body. His mouth found new places to kiss and bite as he moved, rubbing along Sherlock’s deliciously smooth skin until they once again faced to face.
“Only slightly.” Came the swift response, softened not entirely by a cheeky smirk, that did make John give a short chuckle.  Sherlock reached toward the interactive console settled between them in the oak interior of the vehicle.  His fingers quickly began to flip through the menus until he pulled up a navigation map.  He pointed out an area off of the main thoroughfare, that was small and slightly isolated.  “We will make a stop over here for the day, I think.  The town should be big enough to sport a reasonable hotel accommodation that will suit both of our needs.  We should make it there before sunrise.”
“No, l prefer it off for now, John.” Came the other man’s reply to the action, words delivered with a steady deliberate tone that implied he was deep in thought.  There was no other movement, not even a shrug or a slight turn.  What was he watching?
“And what are they going to do, David?” the other sneered, sending his friend a wicked grin, “Put me in a time out?”
John too was curious.  He watched as his mind screamed, his senses crawled with agitation, and his hands fidgeted at his sides.  It was all he could do to restrain himself, to hold back from taking the detective back.  There was a palpable greedy possession exuding from the man that was hard to ignore.
Sherlock stepped forward, closing the space between them as those long, dexterous fingers released his arm and shifted to the hem of his sweater. The silence in the room made the situation seem more intimate than it actually was. “As you seem unable to accomplish this task on your own, I will assist.” As he finished speaking he slowly began pulling the material up.
“I hate you!” John bellowed, in complete contempt of his own weakness against his maker, as he continued to batter the other. There was a part of him that screamed to stop, that the other hadn’t moved and that something wasn’t right. Despite this, all John could do was continue until he realized he was suddenly exhausted.
John tore open the ensuite door that opened into the same bathroom and stepped inside the small room, slamming it behind him.  “Yes, that may bloody well be, you massive wanker!  But I care greatly and you will damn well learn to consider that!”
The consuming and altogether uncontrollable reactions infuriated the detective.  He grit his teeth and rushed from the café out into the cold, relieved by the cold wind that forced him to hunch his shoulders and bury his chin into the softness of the blue scarf.
“Just I could hear you arguing with yourself a bit and figured you'd like a cup of tea is all. I was up to make myself a night cap anyhow.” A smile pursed the soft rose lips of the older woman as Sherlock caught the whiff of scotch on the steam that wafted over from the land lady’s tea cap.
There had been lots of Chinese take away eaten, as well as all the customary Christmas baking—some homemade, most purchased—chocolates, spirits, and Mrs.  Hudson's traditional egg nog.  They had sang a few songs, rather terribly, while Sherlock serenaded them with beautiful renditions of the classic Christmas songs on his violin—grimacing all the while.  John had quite enjoyed that part and he felt that everyone else had as well.  Molly Hooper had lit up like a Christmas tree watching his graceful fingers run the neck with practiced precision.  John had mostly just enjoyed the juxtaposition of Sherlock's frown as the perfectly timed notes rang out in joyful little tunes from the gleaming body of the violin.
"Cutting to the chase, aren't we? Well you are half right, I will be back soon, tomorrow night in fact and I would like to inquire if you would care to meet me?" Armand’s tone became a little less playful but lost none of its sultry delivery.
John saw this transformation, saw his decent into the vast expanses of hallways in what he pictured was a library within the man’s self-labeled mind-palace. Full of information that he only needed to locate the index card for to further recall whatever he had deemed important about the subject. Even should the information be missing, the next course of action would be to obtain it through any variety of means at his disposal. The dull thud of his heart was suddenly resonating louder in his head as blue and green speckled eyes, dark with the shadow from the lamp overhead, met and locked on his own. There was the roar of silence in the room for a second, followed by the hot rush of ache—an ache for how good this all felt—flooded over him.
Finally satisfied he had gathered up what he was willing to this evening, he wondered over to his chair and flopped himself into it with a sigh. The man kicked his feet, crossing them at the ankle, as he eyed his flatmate amusedly and awaited a response from the prone figure. A few more long moments passed and for a brief second John wondered if the other had finally passed out.
Looking back up at the expansive stretch of mirror the man inspected his face again, with a quick sweep of his hand from side to side.  His skin was as smooth as if he had just shaved, not a single nick or hair missed.  He rubbed at his entire face and his eyes as he attempted to wrap his mind around the idea of someone else having done the tedious job for him.  His hands moved back through his hair and over a sore spot that made him wince with a hiss.
"Lestat?" like a bell came his name from soft and glossy lips, as the bare-chested girl padded out into the night air with a little shiver that left goosebumps over the flawless white breasts. The slightly darker toned nipples rose to hard peaks.
what I am doing.” He had ground out each word, shaking with agitation, as he explained, “If you have yet to work it out, Lestrade, which I have no doubt that you have not, Mary-Morstan-is-dead.  John is not.  Therefore, I am clearly not looking for a woman I know is deceased, I am looking for John.”
playing through the surround sound of his borrowed home.  It was ever convenient that Armand had left him the access code.
“Aside from him blowing up the place once I left with Sherlock, yes. I never saw him again until that damned night in the library.” Lestat turned to David, looking exhausted. “There, are you satisfied? Can we just—talk about anything else—I have a splitting head ache.”
The detective let his eyes roll back dramatically, scoffing loudly, as he corrected the detective, “’Good afternoon then’.  It is in fact an hour and twelve minutes after noon, inspector.”
"Like hell you will. As soon as I leave you're going to try to get into the basement." John crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling too much like a scolding parent who had the sixth sense to know when their petulant child was up to no good.
His laughter stopped when he caught sight of what looked like a post card, ripped in two, amongst all of the other paper refuse that cluttered the coffee tables top.  Was that why the detective had gone back to the flat?  He was taking John’s request seriously after all.
Moriarty had done the same thing, had he not?  How else was he to possess such powers—powers even incredible enough to best Lestat.  Although John loathed and despised his maker, he knew first hand what cruelty the black-eyed fiend could wrought.  Moriarty had been at best a sadistic psychopathic butcher when alive.  He could only guess at what evil consumed him now, knowing only that the man’s own dark ambitions would grow.  If this Ludvik wished to start a war with the supernatural powers of this world perhaps it was because of power-hungry, depraved beings like Moriarty.
John rose up on his toes, pointing a finger right in the creature’s chest, as he challenged, “I will tell you this!  It will take a hell of a lot more than Hollywood theatrics and a good grip!”
Louis had cautioned him strongly against seeing anyone from his previous life, explaining that they would not understand all the changes of his physical person and that it would be easier for them to come to the conclusion on their own that he was no longer going to be a part of their lives.  It would be painful, but it was after all more natural.  The doctor had noted with some disdain that Sherlock Holmes had somehow been excluded from this inclusion.  Yet, the detective was now fully aware of the existence of their kind and of John’s transformation.  Yet, despite all that, John was certain now that he was back home that he did not wish to seek the other man out and he had the means now of avoiding the detective, if he so wished.
This was far different from the soldier that had guided them both through the motions of mutual desire, longing, and fulfillment, and yet it was just as new and exciting as that time had been.  John was now a vampire and his cool touch had an air of danger that made the detective's fear receptors electrify in response.  Once again the detective began to wonder just if it was possible for a human and a vampire to engage in similar sexual acts to that which John and himself had partaken of in their former relationship.  The thought was magnified as the man felt the piercing crunch of fangs against his lobe, followed by the lap of tongue, and the suction of lips.  John's moan was low and guttural, animalesque in essence, and it made Sherlock's body respond in kind, his groin beginning to ache with growing want and need.
“Heh, how did it go now…? Ah, yes. That I was allowed to play with his ‘toy’ but not ‘break him’ though he seemed to have no problems with the rest of the fun I had with Sherlock. I’d venture to say I’m just not allowed to give him the dark gift.” Lestat seemed underwhelmed at the gravity of what he had just revealed. So David followed suit and gave it no special acknowledgement the confirmation of what he and Mycroft had speculated to in an earlier discussion.
With that thought, John eased back as Sherlock’s legs released their tight grip around him. Pouring some of the liquid onto his hand, he noted it didn’t have any scent, so not the oil the genius had used earlier. Rubbing his hands together for a moment to warm them he then reached out and stroked down the length of his friend’s cock, leaving a slick trail. Sherlock cried out, the sound barely audible as he thrust.
Typically, his emotions catapulted from self-assessing, disbelieving, to rash anger that brought him to manage a stumbling rasp, “What have you done...”  It had not been a question, but more of a rhetorical condemnation.  It proved just as ineffectual.
With the consulting detective’s mind completely overcome with desire, he let out a gasp of exclamation and then a scream of pain, as John’s mouth opened wide and his teeth sank into the tender skin of his neck.  His mind recoiled, like the snapping of a whip, and impulse replaced desire.  In a violent motion he shoved the doctor back from him.  The hand let loose of his curls and John fell back onto his rump.
John went willingly. He basked in the feel of Sherlock's warm skin sliding across him as the man draped himself over John, head finally settling over his heart with a soft sigh. When John opened his mouth to say something more he was interrupted by Sherlock's low, “Shut up, John.”
“Don't you dare.” Lestat stopped a breath from the other. He could feel the air leave Louis’ lips against his cheek. “Don't you dare look at me like that.”
The scream was accompanied by a blast of force that staggering Lestat back a few steps.  The mans wild expression again slowly faded into a pleasant smile that left the vampire more and more unsettled. The suite had gone dark and cold with the energy that flooded the room and just as quickly as it had come it was suddenly gone.
John settled himself on the younger man’s hips and drew the silk shirt along his still stretched arms to bunch at Sherlock’s wrists and held it there for a moment. His eyes narrowed at the makeshift binding it made while he debated on using that to secure the genius’s hands. With a slow shake of his head, he finished tugging the cloth off. It would be far too easy for the man to get out of John decided and tossed the shirt over the side of the bed.
“Oh heavens, I got so used to it being dead quiet with you gone that I'd almost forgot how much I missed hearing you racing around at night.” She chuckled with warmth in her tone, despite the exhaustion in her voice. “Not that it's keeping me up.” She added quickly, picking up her cup.
Then the pale lips parted and a wet pink tongue darted out to moisten them in a slow deliberate fashion before responding.  "It's simple really." Another pause and a slow deep breath in past those moist lips, "With my superior intellect and pulchritude in combination with your natural empathy and social stamina our offspring would be unstoppable." The last word left Sherlock's lips with another small upturn which lingered, leaving the impression of supreme self-satisfaction.
There were a few other thoughts that the immortal received shortly after within the same realm of sentiment, leaning ever more towards the erotic as both of the tossers eyed his short stature and thin build.  These were received only in parts, crowded by the jumble of other thoughts that he was receiving from within the vicinity as well as the noises of the busy intersection and buildings around them.  His senses seemed to be on high alert, absorbing anything and everything, taking it all in with no filter, bombarding him from all directions.  Overwhelming was an understatement.
“Dear beauty, now I must admit I am out of great plans for the evening and so the next move is yours. Am I taking you back to that stingy little flat you’ve decided to rent below the brooding detective or did you have any other more enjoyable ideas in mind for the end of this evening?” There was no mistaking the intent of the statement from the moistened lips of the pale young man, yet Louis took a brief moment to ponder his own desires.
“I know why you did it. I get that now,” John finished as he held a hand out to silence he detective. “But it doesn’t matter… now, does it? Mary’s gone… and now this.” He waved a hand in front of his body before grumbling hoarsely, “I still can’t have you.”
"That was in poor taste, Lestat.” Sherlock found the will to spurn the narcissistic prick. “I think I'd rather bleed out.”
John made to remove his shoes and someone called to him from down the hall, “No need, John, come right in.”  A man approached him, tall and broad in the shoulders.  He was ridiculously handsome—as he was finding out many of their kind were—making the smaller simpler man feel slightly self-conscious.
John obliged, continuing to thrust in that perfect position, pace slowly increasing as his need grew more intense. The sounds dripping from Sherlock’s lips were music in his ears. He pressed further, deeper, wanting to crawl inside the man, mark him as John’s for all eternity. He ached, not just for this but also for the blood he could almost taste just under the surface of the skin he was kissing.
Louis had warned John of these 'zonings'—things that could take a new vampire by surprise, a fascination so gripping that one forgot everything else and became lost in the experience itself.  It was a give-away, an attraction that drew the attentions of mortals to their kinds differences, which only garnered unneeded scrutiny that would lead to further investigation and discovery.  Their attractiveness was already too great a lure for the average human, a vampire had to guard themselves against anything else.  Louis’ most lectured point was this: do not draw attention to yourself; it garners far too much danger for both the mortal and yourself.
The call was closed and the phone went black just before it was hurdled across the room.  It made a loud clatter as it smacked the wall and fell the tiled floor of the kitchen.  John cursed and grabbed his head with one hand, closing his eyes.  His agitation was through the roof, along with his pulse, and the throbbing that rocked his cranium was almost too much.  His one chance to reach the outside world and he had buggered it up.
Sherlock finished a quick text on his mobile and finally answered his question.  “That was Moriarty.”
John crossed his arms and asked the detective, “Where do you suppose he came across the power to overcome death? It’s not vampirical power.”
Right hand flexing unconciously, he headed inside and towards the clothes he'd tossed haphazardly by the door. He thought of the hot emerald fire in the eyes of his fledgling as the heat in his hand rose in time with the hot pink flush of it's mark on the pale flesh of Louis cheek. It had been only a few days since he had left to Belgium but it hadn' t taken long before he grew tired of the seclusion. He had arrived back on the London sidewalks through his own supernatural powers. Picked up the young pretty mortal on the street with a devonair smile and whispered promises of seduction unlike any she could imagine. He had delivered his end of the deal and her end, unknown to her, not that she had asked, was to be the next bit of bait in his little trap for the consulting detective.
John also noticed that the advice was accurate and drew in a long breath himself, not having realized that he had stopped breathing. He tried to get used to this feeling of being overly full. Was this how Sherlock had felt? He didn’t think so, the other man had appeared to be enjoying this last night a lot more than John was. He shifted slightly trying to ease some of the tense strain and Sherlock cursed, his hips jerking in automatic response.
“He’s already agreed to take it.  He wants the dark gift.” Lestat said with a wicked grin, as he eyed Sherlock from over her shoulder.
Of course, he had told John that he did not. He wanted to. He wanted to believe that this could be an end to it all. Not for himself, but for John.
“I’m sure you already do, John. You will have access to my findings, I assure you.” Sherlock countered smoothly. Hastily clicking on the keypad to activate the camera that was positioned to capture John who flopped back on the bed and almost immediately was unconscious.
The vampire’s eyes moved off of the man for the first time since they had landed on him, drifting to the desktop where his hand reached up and spun the globe in the corner.  As the creature watched the small round sphere spin in its holder, Mycroft watched him.  He was truly surprised to have been given an opportunity to meet the vampire.  The beings’ kind were but a whisper that the truly gifted mind had only heard snippets of, deep within the catacombs of some of the most ancient of places and organizations beneath the surface of the British Government and Intelligence.  Whispers were all Mycroft needed.
The vampire turned back towards the entrance of the ally, satisfied that he had observed all he could, and contemplated if he should hail a taxi back to the flat. He knew the two men were on route back to the detective’s beloved Baker Street via the quaint little cars and bustling streets that made up London, but he could take a faster route by utilizing his supernatural speed and agility. Long past feeling guilty about the gifts this immortal life gave him, he used them now and again, as required.  He preferred to experience things in their entirety and at the pace the natural world moved. He rarely felt the desire to throw himself, as fast as possible, through the world with all the supernatural powers and god-like abilities, which only flourished with the passing of time. The consulting detective and his begrudging companion wasted little time searching out clues in this latest mystery, yet it was apparent that the doctor was getting ready to escape the night’s escapades when the two departed and the taxi was hailed.
He felt that it would be correct to assume that because the postcard was signed with Mary’s name preceding John’s and by the femininity of the script that she had penned the note.
Sherlock whirled about on his heel and with those wild wide eyes he exclaimed, “No!  You must leave!  Now!”  The consulting detective marched to the door, opening it and swinging his arm in a wide sweep through it, gesturing his need for the inspector to depart.  Immediately.  When Lestrade returned a thin-lipped glare, the detective gave an exasperated sigh, throwing his head back dramatically and bending at the knees, before he growled through grit teeth, “John will never come back if you stay.  It has to be just me and even then I cannot be certain!  Trust me, if we are to have any chance at finding him this is it.”
John rests his forehead against Sherlock’s bare shoulder, huffs a breath of sheepish, self-conscious laughter. “I haven’t been like this since I was a teenager,” he says, shaking his head.
In these times, in such contrast to his everyday arrogance, Sherlock always obeys John without question, obeys despite the undeniable, barely-visible but ever-present undercurrent of aroused shame that John so loves. The absolute trust Sherlock places in him somehow resounds deeply within John, feeds some poorly-understood need living in his soul, and it invariably makes John’s breath come shorter and his heart pound faster, thick dark heat pooling low in his pelvis, a delicious pulsing ache.
Another two days pass. Sherlock is feeling much better, well enough to be chafing in irritation at his enforced inactivity.
“Shut up, berk,” John grumbles without heat, waving off the hand Sherlock offers. “This is your fault, remember."
“I don’t think they’re designed for that level of abuse,” John replies with a touch of amusement. “Oh, well. Even if they don’t, still money well spent in my book.”
Dizzy and almost overwhelmed with sensation, John breaks the kiss, sliding wet lips along the rough end-of-day stubble along Sherlock’s jawline as Sherlock’s hands pull him in even closer, roam restlessly up and down his back in unspoken request.
“Let’s walk home,” John says, out on the pavement in front of the hotel, mere blocks from Baker Street. “It’s not very far, and it’s a lovely night.”
Sherlock’s cold shoulder applies, less specifically and more generally, to Mrs. Hudson as well. Day after day passes with pots of tea gone undrunk, toast gone uneaten, scones and pastries gone stale and dry on their paper lace doilies.
“I promise you I don’t intend to go on a full frontal offensive, or anything like that. For starters, much as I may wish to, we both know I’m in no physical condition for that kind of confrontation. I just--” John looks into Sherlock’s eyes, spreads his hands in entreaty. “I just want to go to their house and sit in the car on the street. I want to see them. I
“Well, I did,” Sherlock says, sounding exhausted, defeated in a way that makes something hurt in John. “They were classified, blocked from my access. Obviously. But once I knew they existed, it wasn’t difficult.”
.” John pushes himself up with his good arm and swings his left knee up and over Sherlock’s torso, his cock bobbing heavily between his thighs as he settles himself astride his lover’s body.
Jim nods once. “You’re an observant woman, Molly.” He turns his attention back to the board, contemplating, calculating. “Bet you’re a good player. Do you beat him often?”
John huffs in mock annoyance. “It wasn’t a punishment, you drama queen. But thank you. You look better.”
“Your fingers,” he says, his voice coming out raspy and rough and more than a bit demanding. “I want you to put them inside of me.”
He will let Sherlock pull away, disappear inside himself when he needs to. The Work takes precedence. And John knows this. Hell, he knew this going in. And it’s fine.
John slides the loop of the leash around his wrist and unbuttons the fly of his jeans, lifting his hips just enough to shove his jeans and pants down to free his straining cock. He wraps the leash around his right hand and pulls Sherlock around roughly to settle in between his thighs, grabbing him by the hair with his left.
“Don’t…” John takes a breath, tries to clarify his own thoughts. “Don’t go swooping in, Mycroft. He feels very betrayed right now, very violated. Tracking his every movement and snatching him up off the street isn’t a good idea. He’s a grown man--”
Of course he knows Sherlock’s not really there but even so, the emptiness of the room surprises and disappoints him just a bit.
Sherlock is sure it’s the ridiculous amount of food in his stomach, but  for a moment it feels almost hard to breathe.
“Don’t be a tease,” Sherlock says, and it’s likely meant to be snappish and demanding but it comes out breathy, desperate, pleading.
“Very much so,” Sherlock says, then leans forward and kisses him. John responds warmly despite being half-awake, meeting Sherlock’s insistent lips with his own sleepy but affectionate mouth.
But he took her back. He did, in the end, give in to Sherlock, his insistence that despite her lies and deception and attempted murder, the safest place for her to be was next to John, soothed into complacency by his supposed forgiveness.
“Thank you,” John says, meaning it. He wants to say something more, but there’s just no time. He gives her an awkward wave, feeling like he’s slighted her somehow, before turning again to leave.
(It has to be better for him than scotch, he figures, and Lord knows he partook of his fair share of...well, medicinal herbs...in his more youthful days.)
Mycroft nods. “They’ll be in witness protection. A small town in the American Midwest. She’ll be safe as long as Ms. Morstan abides by the terms to which she’s agreed. “
Seeing himself like this, bound and submissive, thoroughly abused and fucked and yet still hard, still desperately needy, sends hot showering sparks of  arousal through Sherlock’s body. He shivers helplessly, a tiny whimper escaping his throat.
“Ta, thanks,” John says absently, barely glancing up. The young volunteer slips out of the room without saying a word.
“John. Stop. Think about it for a moment.“ Sherlock tries to marshal his reason, his persuasiveness. “Mycroft cannot ever, ever give in to demands of that nature. If he did, even once, no one he has any connection to would ever be safe. Me, you, my parents-- we would live under constant threat from every two-bit London lowlife with delusions of grandeur.” He rubs soothing circles on John’s thigh, clockwise, the way he likes. “Think about it. You know it’s true.”
Sherlock blinks, tries to cut through the fog shrouding his brain, and remembers. “Greg and Molly’s wedding,” he murmurs.
“Which is a combination that leads you to essentially the same place as outright evil,” John observes.
“But what about you?” he asks. “Are you…” he searches for the right words, fails, parrots John’s words instead. “Have you come back too?”
“You should get a medal too,” Sherlock tells John through helpless giggles. “For the distance event.”
His eyes range over the plates, the saucers, the bowls. Mary bought all of them, every single one, getting rid of John’s things she didn’t like when he wasn’t around. Giving in to an impulse he doesn’t quite understand, buoyed by the constant black undercurrent of rage, he plucks a plate off the shelf and hurls it as hard as he can against the far wall. It shatters explosively.
It isn’t exactly the highest blow John’s ever dealt, and Sherlock’s eyes widen just slightly, but he doesn’t dare argue the truth of John's words. He blows out a breath and nods, not quite meeting John's eyes.
Sherlock brought John danger and challenge and madness. John brought Sherlock steadiness, control, and peace.
Sherlock wraps his hand around his aching, leaking cock, pulls, strokes himself hard and fast. Within moments his climax crashes over him, overtakes him, and he comes with a sharp, bitten off cry. His body shudders as the waves of bliss wash over him, come spurting warm and wet over his fingers and onto his belly. John fucks him through it, each steady thrust sparking another silvery aftershock of pleasure.
A few minutes later the text alert beeps. Sherlock waits for a red light to pick it up and look at the message, then types out a brief reply before returning the phone to his pocket
“Something ugly’s come up. He needs you.” Lestrade drops into the vacant seat next to John, but doesn’t remove the tweed trilby pulled low over his eyes. He drops his tone to conversational. “He needs a blade runner, Watson, and he needs the best.”
“I’m just full of surprises,” John mock-growls, though he’s truly more amused than annoyed; he decides to end the conversation and show Sherlock exactly
“Sherlock Holmes,” he says warningly, “You play dirtier than anyone I’ve ever known, and you are absolutely going to pay for this little stunt later tonight.”
Sherlock himself is perched on the edge of the mattress, blood-red dressing gown over t-shirt and pyjama pants, the halo of his curly hair silhouetted against the light filtering in from the hallway. For a fleeting moment John thinks with a sinking pang that this is another aching, hopeless dream; but then he breathes in Sherlock’s scent, the ginger and citrus notes of his damp, freshly washed hair, overlaid with a trace of a cigarette furtively smoked on Mrs Hudson’s back porch while John slept, and the mint of the mouthwash he used to try and cover it up, and underneath it all the scent of Sherlock himself, wool and amber rosin and the fundamental warm and masculine aliveness of him that has always meant home to John.
“We could split the difference,” John counteroffers. “Order some dinner, stay in bed. You don’t need to be dressed to do research on your computer, do you?”
“He does manage to embody the entire stereotype of a certain sort of American law professional,” Sherlock agrees. “It fits the entirety of what I’ve learned about Alexander Johnson, Esquire.”
“I know you’re up against the wall and all alone. You’re not the only one with sources inside MI6, darling, and I know for a fact they’ve washed their hands of you. Your brother is dead, and no one is sending the cavalry, not this time. You’ve played your hand and lost, so let’s not get tangled up in idle conversation.” Never taking her eyes off Sherlock and John, she carelessly gestures towards James and his men with the gun in her hand. “Go on, then, boys. Be a love and earn your cut.”
“You’re doing so well,” John murmurs. “So lovely, so gorgeous. Just relax and let me hold you. I’ve got you. I promise.”
“She has a good home now,” Maria says. “A real home, with good parents, a couple desperate for a child of their own. A librarian and an optometrist, if you can believe it. A house, a dog, a swing set in the back garden. They can give her the life she deserves. A life neither one of us could have ever given her.” Her tone drops lower, huskier, almost as if she were pleading, or maybe asking John for forgiveness. “John. We were never cut out to be proper parents, you and I. You know that, don’t you? You have to know that.”
John stares at Mycroft, poleaxed, as he parses the man’s words. Understanding breaks over him like a wave, extinguishing his anger, leaving him hollow in its wake.
“I do know,” Sherlock murmurs. He kisses his mouth, then presses his lips to John’s cheek in a gesture of heart-shattering gentleness. “You’re sure you’re all right?”
“You runty little cocksucker,” the man seethes hatefully, his fists clenching as he rises out of his chair. John would dearly love to lay this bastard out flat, but there’s the new job he doesn’t want to jeopardise.
The electronic shades covering the panoramic windows dissolve, revealing a gorgeous sunset, glowing orange-pink-gold through a poisoned sky.
John climbs out of the demolished linens; Sherlock magically conjures up a pack of cigarettes, pulling one out and putting it in his mouth as John is rummaging in his bag for his toothbrush.
He finds sight of the gun aimed at Sherlock’s skull is quite motivating, and it takes him less than half a second to decide on a plan of action.
But Sherlock merely brushes John’s sweat-damp overgrown fringe out of his eyes. “I love it.” He kisses him again. “You taste amazing.” He drapes the length of his body over John’s back, kisses the ridge of John’s shoulder blade, then presses his mouth reverently to each bump of John’s vertebrae.
The pair wait in awkward silence until Sherlock pulls up in a shiny black SUV that would make their old battered Ford Focus look like a trash heap in comparison. John is surprised to discover he almost...misses the old clunker.
The heat of that gaze is almost overwhelming, making John’s erect cock throb visibly with arousal, foreskin fully retracted, the head purpling and wet.
“The legal paperwork pertaining to Maria’s release from Edna Mahan,” he replies, eyes rapidly scanning down the page.
“HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT?” Sherlock roars, throwing the empty vodka flask against the far wall with all of his might.
John shuts up, suddenly aware of a sinking feeling that tells him he’s just revealed far more to Sherlock than he ever, ever intended.
“Kids today,” John mutters, but he and Sherlock are both smiling now, just a little. Through sheer button-mashing he figures out how to pull up the satellite radio, settles on a classical music channel. Chopin pours forth from what seems like a constellation of hidden speakers.
“But still,” John says aloud to the empty driver's seat. “What gives His Majesty the right to act so pissed off about the whole thing?”
He knows Sherlock loves him. He does, and he believes Sherlock when he says he is a changed person. John also knows, though, that a mystery this profound, this unsettling will call to Sherlock like an addiction, like a physical need in his veins that he won’t be able to ignore until he’s answered the questions, solved the riddles, teased the puzzle apart.
Sherlock’s voice cracks on the last word; he breathes out hard, swipes at wet eyes with the unbuttoned sleeve of his shirt, grasping the cuff of it under folded fingers like a child.
(They’ve tapering John's pain meds, and Sherlock is resorting to his hated nicotine patches, unable to keep up a pack-a-day habit while staying next to John’s side in hospital. These two facts aren’t helping matters at
“We’ll try again tomorrow,” says John quietly, evenly, conveying a calm he certainly doesn’t feel inside. “But right now, Sherlock, we’re making way too much of a scene for this time of night. In this area, frankly, the police are the least of our concerns.”
“No, no, this isn’t a bad thing. It’s also kind of not a good thing. I don’t know. It’s just a thing.”
Mary shrugs and nods, conceding the truth of his words. “You brought Moriarty back from the dead just to draw me out?” she asks.
activities. Sherlock looks over at him, his face creasing ever so slightly into a shadow of a genuine grin, understanding dawning as John attempts to gingerly rearrange himself into a more comfortable position.
If the situation they found themselves in wasn’t so grim, John is pretty sure Molly would give him a double thumbs-up in return.
The two of them lie in the dark, both wide awake and nowhere near sleep. John feels himself marinating in his own awkwardness, and can almost hear the gears in Sherlock’s brain turning, around and around, inexorably, unable to slow long enough for his body to relax.
“Not now, pet,” said John. “Not for a good long while, and the soap will sting if goes in too far.” He still spent a minute teasing Sherlock gently, pressing and circling at his hole, giving him just a taste of the bodily sensations he craved, and Sherlock whimpered, just once, in the back of his throat.
“Thank you for your time, Molly,” John says as they brush past her, and he sharp-eyed look he gets in response sends a chill into his bones.
“Terribly,” John replies, pressing his lips to the pulse point just under Sherlock’s stubbled jaw, tasting the salty tang of his skin. He slides fingertips over the worn denim seat of his jeans, savoring the feel of plush, rounded flesh under his hands. “Truly. I was bereft.”
It’s Sherlock. His slender frame is swallowed up by his voluminous overcoat, his pale skin gone grey and stretched tight across his skull, his green eyes wide with something very akin to fear.
“Oh god,” John says hoarsely, panting as the shivery ripples of pleasure recede. “Oh god, Oh god, I--” he hisses in brief discomfort as Sherlock slides his fingers out of his sensitive and now very sore arse.
“Morning, love,” John replies, and kisses him on the mouth. Sherlock’s breath is terrible, unbrushed teeth tinged with a leftover trace of old garlic. John could not possibly care less. “You awake?”
Sherlock proves true to his word. He’s back in the bedroom within ten minutes, scrubbed pink and toweling off his clean wet hair, when a knock sounds on the door. He pulls his jeans back on, turns to his jacket draped over the back of the desk chair.
The furnishings themselves, while comfortable and pleasant, have that distinct air of being entire room suites ordered from an upscale home furnishings website. The pewter-coloured side chair which John currently occupies coordinates perfectly with the deep teal sofa and hand-wrought brass end tables, while stretched canvases of oversized impressionistic landscapes adorn the walls and a precisely faded Oriental rug under the coffee table ties the whole room together almost too perfectly.
“Twice a week,” Sherlock sighs. “Since the end of January. It was one of the conditions of avoiding prosecution for Magnussen’s murder.” John can’t see his face, but he can practically hear the rattle as Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Of course, up until this point, sociopathy has always been a rather valuable job skill in the eyes of MI6, but shoot just one international media magnate billionaire in the head in front of twenty witnesses and suddenly everyone’s
“John,” Sherlock says in a low raspy grumble, and John immediately registers that his voice is somehow....
“Use the lube,” John directs him. “Touch your prick, but don’t you dare come without permission or you won’t again for a long, long time.”
Sherlock’s eyes flick up to meet his, self consciousness apparent in the way he can’t quite look at him directly, the way his teeth dig into his lip, the touch of pink flush staining his pale cheeks. There’s nothing else for it, John thinks, except to kiss him again.
Sitting in the back of a cab, Sherlock decides the whole thing makes him feel very uncomfortable and he’d rather not think about it any longer. Instead, he retreats to his mind palace, deleting piles of useless information (political structures of feudal Japan, the spread of Black Death along trans-Asian trade routes) in order to make more room to catalogue every single moment he’s spent with John since his return.
John nods. “Los Angeles. Ambushed in a stairwell. Force of the shot knocked me down the steps. Banged up my leg and hit my head. I don’t really remember it. Woke up a day or so later. bullet went clean through, healed pretty quickly. My leg, though--it was just a damn sprain, but---” John shakes his head. “Knocked a few wires loose in my head, as well.”
Sherlock immediately wedges himself into one of the molded plastic chairs, laptop precariously balanced on bony knees. John navigates the coin changer, slotting in a ten dollar bill in exchange for a double handful of silver quarters. He buys washing powder from the vending machine and starts a load of laundry.
Sherlock wakes, briefly, and turns his head to see John sitting in the chair by the door, staring fixedly at a spot on the far wall. He looks terrible, disheveled and unshaven and so much smaller than he ever has before, as if he were collapsing in on himself, a dying star.
Their hips rocked in time, cocks pressing against one another in sinfully delicious friction as John rapaciously drank. John gave himself over to the force driving him, losing all thought but his raging desire for more. John needed to consume this man, needed everything. The passion-filled haze drove him one, clutching Sherlock tighter against him as he forced the detective’s mouth wider. The sound of slow clapping broke the haze of burning desire they were under.
This was the very reason why he had strived to remove all emotional connections and reactions from his life and had immersed himself in the study of everything and everyone else.  This connection he shared with John was a double edged sword, both capable of allowing him to excel with great flourish and to hinder his mind and body entirely.  It could only be seen now as a weakness, as a detractor, as a hindrance to his overall being—because right now it felt like he was being torn in two.  A part of him was working out how easy it would be to make his way into the small flat that the doctor shared with his fiancé, just to know where he was, what he was doing, and why, and the other part of him was offended, hurt, and confused, willing to seek retribution.  Either way his mind was finding many very compelling reasons to seek out Mary Morstan’s residence.
Sherlock continued to glare. He was becoming more frustrated as the girl skirted around answering his question.  He asked again, without preamble, “Why are you here?”
More than a little satisfied with himself he turned his attention back towards the Baker Street flat and noted the darkened upstairs windows that denoted the fact that the consulting detective was not in attendance. The small window in 221C also remained black while through the main level there was the multicolored flicker and quiet roar of canned laughter that was indicative of the television's hypnotic cable shows. Lestat sneered in dissatisfaction.
“Understood. When I have a time for you, I will contact you again,” Marisa said before ending the call.
Startled by the sudden movement John stumbled, slipping on the water he had dragged in before catching his balance after a few steps. When he refocused his attention on the detective, he found that the man had thrown his jacket on and had already begun winding his blue scarf about his throat.
“Political jargon or not, dear brother, the answer is the same, if you would care to give me the time to say it.” His brother’s tone was grating and nasally, dripping with restrained annoyance.  He twitched his head back, his weak chin thrust out, as he swallowed and added in a measured tone, “I am aware of that situation and I have little information to give you above and beyond what you have already deduced for yourself.”
“It is rather curious,” the vampire mused, propping his chin in his hand, as he reclined in the leather seat of the private jet, crossing his legs casually, “I have come across very few mortals who are able to keep me out.  You should feel privileged.”  Sherlock received the most wicked of smirks from across the isle and then the vampire changed the subject.  “If you want to help your doctor then the best thing that you can do for him now is to help him accept what he has become.  It is really a gift.  A gift for both of you.”
John released a heavy sigh that was almost an indignant grunt, and then Sherlock felt the soft press of cool lips against the lobe of his ear. A hand came up, gently taking the other side of his neck, as the lips moved lower. Sherlock pulled the collar of his coat higher and soon the kisses gave way to nips. He could feel the sharp teeth grazing the skin of his trapezius, hesitantly. Then the fingers tightened, and he gave a gasp of his own, as the incisors penetrated.
As he had suspected.  "And you just happened to be here?" he said, more acidly than he ought to, "Getting ready for the breeding season?"
The look he gives John says… well, it says a lot of things at once. It says affection and nerves and apprehension and hunger-- yes, there’s definitely hunger there as well and the realisation sends something zinging along John’s nerves, makes something in him feel hollow and shaky and wanting despite the enormous amount of Thai takeaway in his belly.
“We’re good,” he says by way of greeting. “I sent the photo, metadata and tracking app embedded. You should be able to -- ”
John’s hands are on his shoulders now, his clothed body pressing against his naked back; insistent hips push into the cleft of Sherlock’s arse, and he can easily feel the hard length of John’s cock even through the fabric of his trousers. “That’s what you do to me,” John breathes into his ear as he thrusts, each movement shifting the plug against Sherlock’s prostate and sending another shower of sparking heat through his body. “Just having you like this, just giving you pleasure makes me this hard. Can you feel this, love?”
Sherlock looks up at him without pausing, celadon eyes gazing at him as his cock slides between those decadent lips.
Sherlock whines a bit but stills the movement of his hips, resisting the impulse to thrust while revelling in the denial, in his obedience to John over the demands of his weak and willful body.
“So that’s how it is,” says John, his voice sharp-edged. “Mary’s going to prison, the baby is David’s, my life is in shambles, and you just, what, assume you get me by default?”
A moment later James Martinez exits the passenger side of the vehicle, as his bodyguard Nestor and another, slightly shorter and younger man John doesn’t recognise emerge from the sliding side panel door. The driver remains in the van, a dark indistinct shape seated behind the steering wheel.
“You bastard,” John says without rancor, affection winning out over grumpiness. “Enjoy. You thoroughly deserve it.”
. So how could I be better than you deserve? In fact, how could I possibly be good enough, Sherlock? How could I even begin to be
For a confused moment the thread of time catches and tangles, and John thinks it’s Harriet’s voice in his ears.
“Deep freeze in the cellar,” Sherlock answers automatically before the rest of his brain helpfully supplies
“Oh God,” Sherlock rasps, his hips twitching upward, his cock twitching and swelling as it brushes against John's thigh. “Everything.
John gasps, just a little, a sharp intake of breath as he bites at the juncture of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder.
The moment is broken, however, when Sherlock gives a huge, involuntary,  jaw-cracking yawn, which of course makes John yawn sympathetically in turn.
“Do you mind if I smoke?” Sherlock asks, long fingers already tapping a cigarette out of a silver case.
The smell of decaying blood seems to increase tenfold, thick and fetid in his nostrils, and suddenly the reality that John had been pushing away comes crashing down over his head.
“No, but it is my best prediction,” Sherlock tells her. “You’ve been very helpful, Patricia. Thank you.”
In his moments of greater self-awareness, John realises he may in fact be hovering, rounding the bend of careful and considerate and stepping dangerously close to the land of condescending and patronizing. It’s obviously not the wisest or most productive approach to take with a man as proud and self-possessed as Sherlock Holmes. But at the moment he hasn’t really got a more workable plan, has he?
The second set of steps recede, then fade away as Jack prods him with the barrell of the gun. “Now, then, Doctor Watson. You’re gonna turn to your left, and we’re gonna go through that exit door and down the stairwell. Nice and easy.”
“Twenty, I think, to start,” John finally says, and brings his left hand down hard, just above the crease of his buttock.
“You are…” Sherlock stops, closes his eyes, breathes in and out once and opens them again. “You are the very best thing I’ve ever had in my life, John Watson, and you make me happy, happier than I ever even dreamed I could be. You’re everything to me, even if you’re too thick to see it, and--well, now that you know it, don’t you
Sherlock sighs and wraps an arm around John’s belly. “Incomparable. Literally. I have nothing in my life with which this experience compares.”
But Sherlock’s already gone, shoving roughly past John and stalking out the door. His feet pound down the steps, and as he leaves Baker Street he slams the front door behind him with a loud crash, making the very walls of the building jump and quiver.
John is silent for a minute as he sips at his drink in consideration. How is he feeling, he wonders?
John goes into the kitchen, deposits the little tin in the refrigerator before locating the calamine lotion in the cabinet next to the sink.
For a split second, John fears he’s going to swing his arm around and shoot his wife where she stands but he doesn’t, turning his upper body towards her but keeping the gun loosely trained on Sherlock and John. “What the
Sherlock nods. “Five minutes,” he agrees, before turning and scurrying off to get clean and hydrated as quickly as possible.
John laughs, a predatory sound, and grabs his arse cheek, digs rough fingers into the abused flesh. “I want to see you come like this,” John murmurs. “Rutting against me, so desperate you’ll do anything for it. I bet you’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
He’s burning with anger, his emotions spinning dangerously out of control--but God damn it all he finally feels it, for the first time in so fucking long he can actually fucking taste it, touch it, feel it as it flows through him, a river of rage and sorrow and frustration.
When he wakes again, it’s to the sound of the front door opening. It's early evening, near full dusk, and Sherlock is carrying two white plastic shopping bags.
What he feels is not guilt. Not regret. John knows, with an absolute bedrock certainty, that he did what he had to do to protect both Sherlock and himself, and that they would not both be alive tonight if he hadn’t pulled that trigger.
Sherlock stretches out on the blanket and watches John wrestle briefly with his jeans, tugging them down and off, baring his strong, solid body to Sherlock’s hungry gaze. He picks up his wine glass and refills it before lowering himself to Sherlock’s prone form, straddling his clothed legs between his strong, naked thighs.
“Sherlock wasn’t aware of the scope of this when he went out there,” John says. “Neither was I. If I was, I’d never have let him go without me.”
John can’t think, can’t remember, but he knows, instinctively, that he can trust that soothing voice, and he obeys with a single, rasping sigh, sinking back down into slumber. It’s a real sleep, now, still colored with a dark narcotic shadow but not quite the leaden blankness of heavy sedation.
John discovers he doesn’t want to fall back in the habit of covering up his imperfect parts. “No, I want to. Just help me out.”
John is still wide awake, scattered thoughts churning like flotsam on rough waves, when he hears Sherlock come back into the front room.
Sherlock is looking down at him a bit quizzically, his eyes gone blue-green tonight and blinking owlishly, and John suddenly feels very self-conscious and more than a little foolish.
He climbs out of bed and shuffles into into the bathroom, using the toilet before turning the shower taps on as hot as he can possibly stand it. He strips out of his pants and steps under the hot spray, scrubbing with Sherlock’s twenty-pound soap and washing his hair with his impossibly poncy organic shampoo.
There’s a pile of recent mail on the center island. John sifts through it. Bills, flyers, a copy of Real Simple magazine. He drops the mail back on the table, looks around the kitchen for his next likely target.
He touches John with an intensity of focus that’s almost overwhelming, sliding fingertips across John’s pectorals, tracing around the jagged edges of the scar on his shoulder. He is silent, hushed and reverent, bright eyes fathomless, and John knows he’s committing every touch, every sensation to memory.
“You’ve walked out twice on me tonight. And here I thought I was being charming.” John tries to smile; it feels false, hollow, like it hangs all wrong on his face. He gives it up.
But John is, if nothing else, good at social niceties, good enough for both him and Sherlock. It’s been one of his primary relationship responsibilities for years, and in this moment, he has an opportunity to put that talent to use. Their primary objective here is getting past the receptionist and in to see Alex Johnson, and they’ve been unexpectedly handed a golden ticket. John needs to cash it in despite still feeling battered, sliced, and emotionally exhausted. He gathers himself, gives her a winning smile, extends his hand.
“I love your arse,” John murmurs reverently. “It’s absolutely spectacular. Miraculous. I don’t tell you that often enough.” He kisses the tender flesh of Sherlock’s right cheek. “Every time I look at it I want to kiss it. I want to taste it.” Sherlock gasps as fingers gently spread him open and John’s warm, wet tongue swipes a wide, flat path from his perineum to the base of his spine. He can’t help but arch and cry out as John’s tongue circles that small tight knot of flesh and then presses, coaxing him open with gentle licks and caresses. John has never done this to him before and the sensation is incomparable, the filthy intimacy of it overloading Sherlock’s already addled mind with base, primal need. He spreads his legs wider and arches back in wordless entreaty.
Doctor Sheldon, to his credit, stops just short of rolling his eyes, but John can clearly see him fighting the impulse.
“I know,” says John. “And I’ve tried to respect that. I won’t make you talk about anything, or do anything, that you don’t absolutely want to do.”
“That’s right,” John says, voice rough and low. “You belong to me. Every part of your body. Every inch of you. Nothing will ever change that.” John kisses the very top of his spinal column, the bony prominence of the C2 vertebra, and moves down, dropping a small kiss to each knob of his spine. His lips press the swell of his left buttock, and Sherlock cries out in surprise as John nips him there, sucks hard at the tender flesh, pull the blood to the surface then soothes the love bite with catlike swipes of his tongue. He does the same to the other side, causing Sherlock to make little, bitten-off cries as he squirms and pulls at his restraints.
John doesn’t hesitate, shifting himself slightly to engulf that lovely prick with his mouth, savouring the delicious friction of hot satiny skin across his lips as he takes him in fully. He misjudges slightly from years out of practice, though, and the head of Sherlock’s cock presses just a little too hard against the back of his mouth, making John cough and sputter from lack of practice.
Sherlock looks slightly sheepish, leaving John to wonder what kind of trouble Sherlock’s big mouth had gotten him into while John was too out of it to take notice.
The two are silent for a long moment. Then another. John looks stricken, horrified, grey with guilt and shame.
The criminal’s split second of hesitation spares Sherlock’s life. His indecision gives the teller a moment to scream “Eric, no!” and grab frantically at the man’s arm. The shot goes wild, over Sherlock’s head, chips of plaster flying as the bullet strikes the wall. Sherlock doesn’t hesitate, using the moment of distraction to efficiently disarm and subdue the man.
“I wonder why I let myself shut down so completely. I wonder why I didn’t fight harder. I wonder why I didn’t stop it sooner. I’m brilliant, I’m
John looks down at the screen. It reads 7:43 am. He’s had three missed calls in the past five minutes. As he’s holding it, the phone rings again, half-startling both of them.
As the moment passes John is struck by the sudden, irrational desire to press the crumpled bit of paper to his lips, but even in the total privacy of the bathroom the thought seems ridiculously overwrought, melodramatically sentimental and horrendously mortifying.
“Nestor, for fuck’s sake, stop whimpering, it ain’t broken.” He returns his attention to Sherlock. “Now, gentlemen, seeing as you have the upper hand, at least for the moment. What can I help you with today?”
And the fact is this: the man a grifter, a con man, but not at heart a kidnapper or a killer, and John knows this to be true, knows this slim but real moral high ground is his only shot at leverage. He decides to take a chance; in the end, it’s Atlantic City, and John rolls the dice.
Sherlock suddenly feels a bit dizzy, so he makes himself horizontal, stretching out on his side across the blanket, propping his head up on his bent arm to admire the view of blue denim stretched tight across John’s inviting arse as he attends to his task, striking a match and setting it to kindling with the solemn, single-minded focus of the slightly drunk.
“It’s all right,” John breathes. “You won’t--” he tries, fails to keep that edge of demanding neediness out of his voice--”just, please?”
Katie exhales. “I just don’t want to be torn up anymore. I want to recognise myself again. So I guess I’m glad you’re here. You and your...friend. Hi.”
“You knew it was us,” John says to Maria, and it’s of course it’s obvious, so obvious is barely bears saying out loud, but it’s all he can think of in order to buy a few moments to think, to give Sherlock a chance to think, to give both of them a chance to do something, anything that would give them any sliver of a chance of getting out of this alive.
Wiggins is sitting on the couch, playing with his tea spoon, trying desperately not to shake, not to show how badly he needs to fix.
“You are,” Sherlock says, voice not unkind but brooking no argument. “I’ve got some interesting preliminary results on the analysis of the clothing Travis was wearing at the time of his death, but it’s going to take several more hours to confirm my findings. The best way for you to help me now is to get some rest so you’re useful to me tomorrow. I’ve already called a cab.”
“Take these,” John says, slightly out of breath. ‘I can’t hold on to these and get myself in the car at the same time.”
“You seem to be adjusting quickly,” John says, regretting how flip the words sound when they come out of his mouth.
Sherlock squints, as if he’s working out a particularly difficult deduction. “John. I’m not going to…” he tilts his head. “I have work to do,” he says, as if this fact should be self-explanatory.
The narrow window on his left side is a golden rectangle, early morning sunlight brightening the hospital room. The television, perched high in a far corner is on but muted, a pair of American chat hosts bickering silently as the news crawls across the bottom of the screen.
John knows they don’t have unlimited time; he knows that what just happened between them doesn’t change the dire urgency of their situation. But right now, with post-orgasmic lassitude creeping into his limbs, all he can think about is pulling Sherlock into his bed. But not before--
Sherlock sighs, and the relief is evident just in the tenor of his exhalation. John feels oddly...not indifferent, but almost numb, the enormity of it all still to much to process. The narcotics don’t help that feeling either. He can’t think of a single thing to say, so he takes another sip of the weak, cooling tea.
The skull remains silent, but his empty eyes seem to regard John with a softer, almost bemused understanding.
“You’ve shouldered so much of my burden,” Sherlock murmurs, lips brushing against the shell of ear, voice just barely above a whisper. “So much, and so bravely.”
The soft chiming beep that woke him repeats, low but insistent, indicating a waiting message on his phone console.
Morning sunlight pours in through the tall, narrow window, illuminating the dust motes dancing within the beam. The two men watch in silence.
He rises to fetch his gun from the back of the wardrobe, feeling the smile form on his face. It’s something small and sardonic and tinged with bitterness, but still. After all this time, something is finally
John’s beginning to think they may need to come up with a backup plan on the fly when the electric lock buzzes, loudly.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock says in his best put upon and haughty voice, as if he hadn’t just been caught dry-humping his former flatmate.
“I’ll be back in ten minutes,” Sherlock replies, and slips out the door again before John can question him further--if John were even in the frame of mind to question him, which he honestly isn’t. He’s pulled himself together somewhat since his meltdown, but his mind is still a bit fuzzy and indistinct, the connections sparking and shorting out if he tries to focus too hard on any one thing.
“Gotcha,” Glenn replies. He positions another pillow behind John’s neck, pulls a blanket from the narrow closet and tucks it around John’s pale bare legs. “Call button’s right here. Your guy coming back soon, I hope?”
But in the plus column, he’s mostly fully awake now, relatively oriented to his surroundings, and breathing without a tube in his trachea.
“That doesn’t mean…I’m not...” John hesitates a bit, fumbles for the right words. “I have no timetable here. No set expectations. I just--” He reaches out, feeling a bit uncertain, and strokes Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock stills, but doesn’t flinch. “I’m just. Shit. I’m really just happy to be here. Whatever you want. You set the pace, all right?”
Sherlock is curled up sideways on the foldout sleeper, thin hospital pillow under his head, phone in hand, scrolling listlessly. He looks up as the door opens, fixes the RN with a brief, blank, chilly gaze before returning his attention to the small screen in front of him.
“The surveillance camera was broken,"  D'Annibale states through clenched teeth. "No usable footage was recovered.”
But then again, while he’s been loving and cheerful, he’s not shown any inclination towards doing anything out of the ordinary, either--no clandestine purchases or furtive little
John reaches out to take Sherlock’s free hand, guides it to his head in unmistakable intent as he pulls Sherlock’s body closer in encouragement, relaxing his throat to take him in fully as his cock pushes deep into his mouth, pressing against his soft palate, testing his gag reflex.
He had been more than a little afraid that self, that life, was lost to him forever. But right here, right now, warm and sated and comfortable, in bed with an undeniably real and naked Sherlock --
She doesn’t, thankfully; rather, she slips out from behind her desk and hurriedly climbs the stairs to the second floor.
“Most people who are homeless become that way through dependency problems or mental health issues, or some combination of both.”
John slides his index finger under the lightly gummed flap, extracts another, slightly smaller envelope.
John looks at him for a long moment, then picks up the fine-tipped surgical marker and uncaps it with his teeth. He tilts his head in contemplation, lip flicking against his bottom lip, then presses the tip just to the left of Sherlock’s sternum. It takes less than a minute.
The test subject on screen is male, blondish, oddly aged-looking with yellow, rabbity teeth. He looks dull and sad, somehow, a man who isn’t intelligent enough to get by in the world but aware enough to be wounded by the fact. He is clearly uncomfortable, anxious, fidgeting in his seat.
--it makes something bright and sharp flare in Sherlock’s chest. He tightens his arms reflexively, pulls him closer, feels John relax into him. He’s much thinner than Sherlock remembers, his ribs palpable under his soft plaid shirt. Sherlock thinks of missed meals and field tents and strong hands caring for sick hollow-eyed children and sleepless nights under the glittering desert stars.
Sherlock sighs a little into his mouth as he reaches for John’s hand, places it on the dip of his waist, and John takes the hint, pulls him closer, reveling in the feel of him, taut muscle and warm skin under the soft cotton knit of his well-worn tee. He runs his hand up Sherlock’s back, feeling the indentations of each vertebrae, the flex and pull of each muscle as he slides his mouth across the sandpaper stubble of Sherlock’s sharp jaw as Sherlock’s fingers stroke up his thigh, curl around his hip.
John resolves to outlast Sherlock’s recalcitrance by being more calm and more patient--basically, just wait him out--but the days stretch on and on and Sherlock just grows ever more remote.
Sherlock picks up the bottle. He’s shaking so hard, he almost drops it on the bed, but he manages to get it open, re-slicking the fingers of his right hand. He twists his torso, reaches behind himself and spreads lube across his opening, breathing out as he pushes a finger inside. He gasps a bit at the sensation, the coolness of his finger against the heat inside his body. It stings a bit as he pushes deeper, the angle awkward.
“Lou,” says a man’s voice, tight and angry. “What in the hell have you dragged me into? You told me this would be an easy transaction, and now I’m hearing about secret agents and shootouts and God only knows what is going on down there, and if one word of this reaches my clients I swear to--”
“I’m not risking spilling anything on this posh furniture,” John says, carefully rising and making his way to the dining room table.
John takes a deep calming breath, stills the restless motion of his fingertips stroking Sherlock’s back. “I think,” he murmurs into Sherlock’s ear. “we should probably stop this, or I’m going to get too worked up to be able to sleep.”
“Someone’s watching us,” Sherlock says, pulling on his trainers. “Man in a black car, parked at the end of the street.” He shrugs into his jacket, picks up one of the guns from the dresser, opens the top drawer to retrieve a clip and chambers it.
John’s been here once before, years ago, as he lay feverish and delirious in a Camp Bastion hospital bed while septicaemia ravaged his weakened body.
“Arrogant arse,” John mutters, but there’s a definite fondness in his tone as he arranging his legs primly in front of him, shifting around slightly and finally locating a comfortable position as he leans back on his elbows with a sigh. “Damn good thing it was worth it.”
And Sherlock knows exactly what filthy things John likes best. He swipes the fingers of his right hand through the spattered trail of hot sticky fluid on John’s chest.
“Indeed,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice more than a little hoarse. He’s standing and shrugging into his coat in one single fluid motion, pulling John toward the door before Lestrade has even finished speaking.
And the truth at the heart of it all is this: He doesn’t want to know the details just for the sake of knowing; that terrible knowledge would be as sharp and cold as a knife in his heart, but even that pain, he thinks, would be a relief from the exquisite, endless hell of
“Quite,” Sherlock agrees. “Aiming for the head tends to indicate anger, as well. This was personal, someone he knew. Johnson was expecting him, he unlocked the door to let him in.”
"I know how big my penis is, thank you very much, and I’m not bragging. It has been problematic. Real life isn’t like porn, love. It's a lot more... work. It can be awkward. And uncomfortable. You might not even like it. Not everyone does. ”
“Unbelievable,” John says, stretching upwards to press his mouth to those smiling lips. Sherlock’s hand comes up and cups the back of his head as he kisses him back, thoroughly, and though the kiss begins in tenderness and caring, it soon grows passionate, hungry and seeking, as all their kisses seem to inevitably do.
“I was so scared,” murmurs John, almost too quietly for Sherlock to hear, and Sherlock squeezes his small warm hand once as the safety and peace of finally being home pulls him down into a deep, blank sleep.
Sherlock is about to shake him off, but John’s eyes catch his and he stops, reconsiders. “All right,” he sighs in acquiescence. “Just coffee and some biscuits.”
John turns his head, opens his eyes to watch him; his hand still wrapped around his cock, squeezing tight and thrusting minutely against his own palm as he as he savors the sight of him, his long pale limbs, his slender, yet-untouched prick dusky pink and curving upward out of its nest of dark curly hair, the still-lush curve of his arse as he turns, bending and rummaging for the lube stashed somewhere in his bag.
She looks skeptical even as she says the words, and Sherlock gives her a singular look of semi-polite disbelief.
. John takes his seat at the opposite end of the sofa, careful to keep their personal spaces separate as he puts down the bottles, picks up the remote, and queues up the movie.
The look Sherlock gives him is literally priceless, and John laughs, harder than he really should considering. “No, I don’t, I’m totally kidding, Sherlock, don’t look at me like that, I’m fine.”
John is alone in the bed when morning daylight wakes him, but same as in London, he can sense Sherlock’s remote but still reassuring presence nearby.
. So how could I be better than you deserve? In fact, how could I possibly be good enough, Sherlock? How could I even begin to be
He bends to kiss the edge of Sherlock’s ear, bringing his fingers to the silver buckle of his collar.
is to carry on Mycroft Holmes’ work and legacy. I trusted him implicitly, and he trusted you with what was most precious to him in the world. He considered you a friend, Doctor Watson. Therefore, so do I. And furthermore... I hope you consider me your friend, as well.”
The gears are spinning in Sherlock’s brain, almost audible to John as the minutes tick by. He never minds watching Sherlock -- sometimes, John feels as if he would be happy just watching him for all eternity -- but there is a lot riding on this particular moment, and John begins to feel like things are maybe dragging on a bit.
“Edna Mahan Correctional, entered 2002. Left in 2005, but the release paperwork mysteriously disappeared of course--” Sherlock pulls his phone out of his pocket, grimaces, taps out a message.
They’ve had vanilla sex in the interim, of course, of the kissing and cuddling and late-night-handjob variety, and while the orgasms were nice, it doesn’t even begin to compare to this.
“I don’t want your bullshit, I don’t want games.” John slaps him again, right-handed this time, hard enough to rock Sherlock’s head back. “I want you. Give me
While he contemplates the spectrum of human mental disorders, however, another part of his mind is mulling over the more important question of Doing Something Nice for John. He was on the brink of figuring out just the right course of action when this inopportune snow thing brought John home early. However, he always prefers having John with him rather than at dreadful boring stupid work, so he’s not overly put out at having his thought process interrupted.
“Where are the Budapest papers?” the man repeats, his voice bearing a strong Northern accent. Rank, rotting breath washes over Sherlock in a fetid wave, making him recoil. His gut tightens, and he might have vomited if there was anything other than bile in his stomach.
He enters the room with a deliberate, careful gait, looks out at the student’s faces, all gazing at him expectantly as he closes the door carefully behind him.
, yes.” He thrust up into the slick heat of Sherlock’s body as Sherlock rolled his hips, meeting him on each stroke, writhing and crying out in shameless lust and need.
“I’m sure he did--or thinks he did. The fact remains that I left the work undone, and parts of the network survived. I’m not saying that to assign blame on myself or anyone else. I’m merely stating facts.”
“Let’s put it this way. I’m every bit as Irish as you are American.” Kelly stands. “Best of luck, gentlemen. Drinks are on me.”
he thinks. The idea is amusing, and he can’t help but crack a bit of smile as he forks over a ten, the kid giving him a sunny grin as he returns the change.
One stunned moment later John feels the sharp bite of burning pain along the side of his torso, a line of fire blooming and spreading on his left side, just below his ribs. His knees buckle and he staggers forward a step, then another, giving a small strangled gasp of surprise and shock.
John lets go of the leash, and as Sherlock draws a deeper breath cool metal encircles his wrists. Not the padded cuffs then, or the hemp rope. Real handcuffs, then--one of the many pairs he’s nicked from Lestrade over the years.
He performs the necessary (Oh God, how incredibly necessary) ablutions, then showers thoroughly and carefully and brushes his teeth. He comes back into the room to find Sherlock seated at the desk, already on his laptop, fingers flying over the keyboard.
“In the bedside table,” Sherlock replies, his voice even but his face still flushed. John sits up, turns to his left to open the drawer. Inside is a tube of hand cream.
Sherlock is wide awake. He brushes a gentle hand over John’s flexed thigh, traces the edge of the gauze covering the fresh wound on his leg.
Sherlock picks up the celluloid head, examines it in the flickering firelight. “His name is Quentin,” he pronounces.
John closes his eyes, willing away an overpowering wave of vertigo and nausea. For a brief, terrible moment he is certain he’s going to vomit.
“Right.” John clears his throat. “Good. I’ll just…” John’s sentence trails off as he hands the water bottle to Sherlock. He turns away and heads upstairs to grab some clean clothes; in the strange relationship no-man’s-land where they’ve been dwelling of late, it had seemed far too optimistic and presumptuous to bring any of his things downstairs, despite sleeping in Sherlock’s bed every night.
Tamara nods."That makes sense. She was after antibiotics, specific ones, strong ones. I wondered why she didn't just go to the hospital. I'm guessing now, meeting you two, she's in a whole heap of trouble or something, couldn’t take the risk of getting found?"
John is knocking on the door. Sherlock opens his mouth to say something, but he feels the hurt welling up again and chooses to remain silent instead. He closes his eyes and deliberately pushes away thoughts of John, of his furrowed brow, of his concerned eyes and warm gentle hands. John had told him no. John had rejected him. If John doesn’t want him, he can bloody well stay away.
John sighs in resignation, grabs his paper bag, and follows Lestrade out to the cruiser. The gullwing doors rise, the overfed bulk of the Chief stepping out heavily onto the wet tarmac.
Sherlock shakes his head. “It’s coded into the genes. Shortened telomeres, programmed apoptosis. Trying to reverse it is like...it’s like trying to remodel the Titanic into a sailboat while it’s at sea under full steam. All of our attempts were disastrous. Massive mutations. Death within hours, days at best. Fatality rate one hundred percent. I have some theories, some hypotheses, but I’m nowhere near a working protocol.”
There’s a bottle of all-purpose hospital body wash on the built-in shelf. John lathers himself all over, more focused on getting through this without collapsing rather than being meticulous. He then then carefully (oh so carefully) raises his arms over his head to quickly scrub suds through his hair before ducking his head under the hot spray and rinsing off.
“Listen to me very carefully, “ Sherlock says, “and answer me truthfully. Did you call 911? Or anyone else besides John?”
John groans in pleasure beneath him and wraps his hot, sticky-slick fist around Sherlock’s cock, stroking him just how he likes, just this side of too rough, his thumb rubbing across the tip. The shivery-hot pleasure of it begins to wind up the base of Sherlock’s spine, insistent, undeniable.
“You were right about a lot of things. But I don’t think I’m better than you. Not for one second. Not ever. You’re the most amazing person I’ve ever met, the most brilliant and beautiful man in the world, and I would never think I was above you in any way.” John pauses for a moment, and when he continues, his voice wavers just the tiniest bit. “Do you think I could hold you? You don’t have to, but it would make the things I’m going to talk about a bit easier.”
Sherlock sighs in his sleep, snuggles closer to John, pressing himself against his shoulder. John runs his thumb gently along the edge of one sharp cheekbone.
“You have a strong moral code,” says Sherlock. “Strict distinctions between right and wrong. However, you cross the lines you yourself draw on a regular basis. You’ve killed people, and with adequate justification you feel little remorse, yet you’re a healer, you’re invested in helping people. You have an anger problem and a violent streak that you struggle to suppress. You enjoy dominance, much more so than you initially anticipated, and while hitting is one of your hard limits, you enjoy inflicting other types of pain and injury without qualm. You voice a strong negative reaction to impact play, yet your autonomic responses suggest intense arousal.”
John works him patiently, slow long purposeful sucks, sliding down to the base then back up to the tip, tonguing his frenulum and licking slow whorls around the tip. Sherlock’s entire body shudders with each flex of his hips, his damp skin radiating heat, his abdominal muscles tremble and shake with exertion as he strains towards his elusive goal, as John’s jaw aches with effort.
“I know that,” John says, his voice pitched lower, reassuring. “I do. So I guess what I’m saying is, I don’t think we are magically different people now than we were before. We just had our bullshit stripped away. Maybe we don’t have to change, as much as we have to get closer to who we
“You look nice,” Sherlock murmurs, unguarded. “You smell nice,” he continues, softly, then catches up with himself and blushes, charmingly, bright spots of colour blooming high on his pale cheeks.
“No, no, I’m okay.” He’s telling the truth. His mouth is dry and his side still aches and throbs, but it’s not nearly as painful as it was just 24 hours ago, an encouraging sign that his questionable life choices haven’t sent him on a turn for the worse. “I just moved a little too quickly.”
Sherlock runs his fingers over the stone. He thinks about John, sprawled across a narrow cot in the desert night, holding this stone in his warm palm and missing him.
Johnson suddenly moves, much faster than one would anticipate based on his age and size. If John were in a better physical state he would have been faster to register the fact that Johnson has pulled a weapon out of his pocket.
The hallway was typical for this period of build.  The stairwell was narrow but open, a pony wall serving as a railing for more than half its length.  There was a tiny bedroom immediately to the left of the stairs—
He normally slept in a cotton tee and pants, but he had forgone any such preparation upon his return last night. It had been dreadfully late, and the dogged chase around the dark and sweaty crevices of the criminal underworld within the old city had left him without a care for the state of his person. His clothes had been damp and had smelled of all sorts of unsavoury back alley aromas, so he had undressed and left the clothes in an unkempt heap in the corner, sliding between the sheets as he was.
"Thank you for meeting me," Armand began, leaning forward he outstretched a hand across the table and clasped Louis own, "I always enjoy seeing you." Before the taller man had totally reacted to the touch, the other had withdrawn and resumed a casual recline in his seat.
“If you wish to aid me, Mycroft, then find John.” Sherlock snipped, succinctly, as he grabbed the handle of the car door, “Until then save your breath and stop wasting both of our time.”
John sighed in an attempt to quell his rising agitation.  The doctor rested his elbow against the ledge of the window on the door and propped his chin in his hand, as a yawn came out of him.  Sherlock's brows creased in response and in a darker tone of nothing less than disgust the detective criticized him, "Has your banal lifestyle really left you so tired, John?  We are on the brink of something..."  There was a small hesitation then in the man's voice, which softly trailed off, only to harshly come back in an agonizingly enticing bite, as he whispered, "Something big."
