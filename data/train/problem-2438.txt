She glanced over at the improbable pair sitting across from her, two of the subjects she was providing security for. The brilliant detective, who many people thought to be a cold, reasoning machine, cradling the infant and carefully giving her her bottle. It was one of the loveliest contrasts she had ever witnessed.
John, meanwhile, gradually slowed down his movements to a casual rolling of his hips, and started planting touchingly gentle kisses along Sherlock’s spine – as if every brush of his lips was a declaration of love, Greg thought. The notion conjured an actual smile to his face, completely against his will, but there it was.
“John, let’s go.”
“I would be ever so grateful if you tried. You see, my son has gone missing.” The earl had to take a moment to recover himself. “The school where he boards called this morning, asking if he had by any chance turned up at home! The bloody idiots thought he’d simply gotten homesick during the night and walked back to Holdernesse Hall, where we live. Well, obviously he hadn’t. So the police were called. It was only several hours later that it was discovered that the French teacher was also nowhere to be found.” He paused, visibly struggling to contain his anger. “The police have so far failed to find any lead at all to either of their whereabouts.”
John had been more aware of the risk of heredity and had struggled to a lesser extent. But still, the minute he faced trouble or emotional hurt, or fear, his first impulse always was to turn to the bottle.
Gradually, so slowly it was almost unnoticeable, Sherlock started to feel better.
His previous words echoed in John’s ears. Since when was Sherlock bothered with people’s troubles concerning affairs of the heart? Was it possible he had been reminded somehow of something closer to home? Probably something from a very long time ago, John mused. He had never really thought Sherlock capable of feeling romantic love, but who knew, perhaps he had one day in the distant past.
Why was that again?
“Come on up,” he said, stepping aside to let her in.
Sherlock decided it was best to give the fake news some time to travel before he did anything else. It was important that the message reached both Bob and Jack before Sherlock went to see the goldsmith.
Unsure of what to do, John sat back down and opened his blog, deciding almost immediately to close it again. After all, what could he write on there? After having been occupied with two subsequent secret missions for months, eliminating first Mary (Rosamund bloody Moran) and then Eurus (Moran’s sodding ex-lover), he and Sherlock were now busy settling into a normal, domestic life, taking care of a baby and learning sign language.
His phone finally showed the search results with the flights she could be on. There was only one that matched the criteria.
Him not ever wanting a dog was another incorrect hypothesis, apparently.
John lifted some apple crumble onto his plate. “I thought we could use a couple of hours away from home, just the two of us, hanging out, with no purpose,” he said.
He clicked on it.
John couldn’t tear his gaze away from his lover. The brilliant git’s plan had worked perfectly from beginning to end.
you. In the second place, I wanna tell you something.”
She would have to use the special table for patients lying down as reference. Diastolic pressure was around 5 mmHg lower like this compared to in a sitting position, Sherlock knew.
serious.
Sherlock took it, and followed him into the bedroom, which was bathed in orange light from the evening sun, mirroring the warmth he felt inside at John’s suggestion.
“No,” John said. He took a couple more steps into the room. “We’d agreed to stay out of touch for a while.”
Then Sherlock started another drawing on a new page. He drew himself as a child, lying down with a blue rope around his neck. Again, he pointed at the empty space around him, and handed his brother the pencil, by way of invitation to draw the rest.
When he opened his eyes, Sherlock was looking at him with a curious expression, as if he was cataloguing new data. John didn’t care; he’d just had one of the best bloody orgasms of his life.
me though that you’ll tell me if I do something that makes you uncomfortable.”

“I don’t believe you.” Her vicious tone and the look in her eyes bit straight through his soul. The glare of a wounded animal.
Not even when his wife had died.
to do everything in his power to prevent that from happening.
Just then, Sherlock’s voice broke the silence. “I think I’m done practising, John,” he breathed, decidedly flirtatious now. “Would you like to have a go?”
Still, he had a very bad feeling about this.
John looked bitter. “Don’t you think he has fixed things for us in this case one too many times already?”
Sherlock’s heart ached as if he’d been stabbed. He swallowed. Twice. “I’m so sorry, John. I know it doesn’t make up for anything, but I am
In the meantime, Sherlock was looking into the possibilities of hiring a private teacher of British Sign Language.
With a quick grin in John’s direction, Sherlock slowly got up and casually walked over to their table.
Sherlock decided this was his moment. “Good morrrrrning, you hard-working men! Having trouble with the machinery, eh? I’ll tell you where you can find all the rings and various types of oil your hearts might desire. There’s a shop not ten miles from here. Cartman’s.” He’d seen it from the train, and it had looked like one of those shops that sold absolutely anything a handyman could ask for.
Then something nakedly possessive flickered in John’s eyes. He put his hands on Sherlock’s hips and went in for another kiss, just tongues this time, with their lips hardly touching. In the mean time, his fingers that had been resting on Sherlock’s waist started pulling Sherlock’s shirt out of his trousers. He then slipped his hands underneath, his fingertips softly scraping over Sherlock’s skin.
That would do. John jerked it off the wall and rammed it into the door with all his might, managing to smash it open in one go.
His eyes lit up. “She likes the snow painting?” he asked.
John looked a little pale. “This will definitely do the trick, yes,” he said, faintly, unable to take his eyes off him.
He grabbed a pillow and hastily stuffed it under his bottom, like he’d read somewhere on a page with tips on this sort of thing, and opened his legs.
The little group of Holmeses standing there chatting away in that manner they all had in common, forming a rather colourful contrast with the rest of the guests, also made Sherlock realise that, try as you might, you can’t ignore your family. They give your identity a necessary context, stupid as that sounded, but it really was true. They played an essential part in shaping you as a person – even if you didn’t especially like how they made you turn out.
At the morgue, they found Molly in the same cheerful mood as always. She was bending down to look into a dead woman’s ear when they entered and she continued to work while she greeted them.
Not that he cared in the least.
The neighbour’s dog had ended up at the vet the next day with toxicosis, and only barely pulled through.
“Hi, I’m er… I’m on a plane,” the girl told him, “and, er, I’m in the loo right now so no one can hear me.” She sounded upset. On the verge of panic.
The truth was, he’d wanted this for so long that his brain didn’t quite seem to know what to do with itself now that it had become reality.
John let out a nervous giggle, which, however, faded quickly. Sherlock took in a deep breath just as John let out a long sigh. They glanced at each other, and then John very carefully took Sherlock’s hand in his. They continued to sit there like that for what felt like hours, staring out over the heath even well after the dark clouds started to release their superfluous water. Only when they were threatening to become drenched to the skin, did they leave the tranquillity of nature to quietly head back into town, back home.
He pointed his finger at her. “Off it.”
Afterwards, Sherlock sometimes imagined talking to him, or just hanging out together, as if Bill were still there.
, alright?” John said, softly. “I understand. He shouldn’t have told them.” He looked Sherlock in the eye, making sure he was listening. “But what you said was out of line. You do realise that, don’t you?”
He heard a soft chuckle in his ear in reply.
John couldn’t remember the last time he had slept this soundly.
“No,” he lied. “If Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that’s not something you can fail to notice.”
. “Really?” He opened his eyes. “Makes sense,” he shrugged. It was usually a mystery to him what people saw in each other, but in this case the pairing intuitively seemed quite logical.
“It’s definitely alright with me.” Sherlock smiled nervously. “More than alright, in fact.”
“Can I safely get dressed for our mission now?”
At Oxford train station, Sherlock found himself in a chaotic throng of stranded train passengers. Due to damaged overhead lines, there were no trains running eastwards, an announcement over the speakers informed him. It would take several hours for the situation to be resolved.
Sherlock walked forward into the circle of children, going into full lecture mode. “The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals – step by step – the solution. That’s the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair. Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington the Poisoner.”
To John’s surprise, Sherlock even turned out to be a tiny bit prone to sentiment. For instance, when they would kiss, he would sometimes take the chain with dog tags from around John’s neck and pull it over their heads until it was around his own neck. He did this especially when John was a bit gloomy, mulling over his army days – as if he wanted to take away John’s burden.
And that was true freedom.
“Arthur!” the earl choked out.
. But at least he now had time for a different visit; one that he was, in fact, looking forward to much more.
So wait they did.
If he was ever going to make this move, he might as well just go for it and take his chances straight away.
Sherlock took the tin and lifted the lid.
John started reading out Greg’s text, and only half-way through, Sherlock agreed, “Oh, very good, indeed. Let’s go.” He quickly drained his cup and grabbed his coat.
The night was hot and uncomfortable. Sherlock tossed and turned for what seemed like ages. John, of course, was fast asleep. Naturally, these meteorological circumstances were nothing compared to what he had endured abroad.
“About a year now.” Craig wiped his face with his sleeve.
As confused as John had obviously been – just as the doctors had warned him beforehand would be the case upon his coming out of his coma – Sherlock had not doubted for a second that his words were true.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock asked.
Slowly, John deepened his thrusts, until soft moans of desire became muffled cries of pleasure in the silence of the room.
He hit ‘send’ and leaned back in his chair, not caring about the context of the query.
“Huh. He’s making a funny face.” She raised her gun and pointed it at him again. “I think I’ll put a hole in it.”
? Why?”
That’s right: he’d said he loved John, after all, John suddenly remembered through the curtain of haziness in his head. That had not been a dream, right?
Well, he was in no hurry anyway.

Redbeard painting for them. To put in their home.
“Yet the proprietress still remembers you.”
So when she found out, a year and a half later, that Sherlock was in fact still alive, she’d thrown herself at his companion and successfully got him to propose to her within six months.
John cringed.
Only moderate surprise there: she’d always known this just
Underneath, the woman had written, “If you not can geeve me back my beloved syster, at least bring me
“... would complete you as a human being,” she added.
Sherlock lifted his head, startled, his curls a lovely mess. “What?” he said, drowsily. “Oh.” He rolled off, his arms however still around John.
In the meantime, while she waited for them to confess their silly little feelings, she had another wonderful problem to occupy herself with. The Woman was apparently still around, waiting to be found…
“It seems to me that Violet is afraid of Jack,” John pointed out between two mouthfuls, “so maybe Bob is following her to protect her?”
To slaughter a dog like that… John couldn’t imagine what it must have been like for Sherlock at the time, having been so young. Was that why he’d decided later on to fight crime, John wondered? Because he’d experienced the deep wounds of injustice?
something. Having a purpose. Literally the only problem is I look like a drunk. Is that really so bad?”
And Redbeard, of course. Redbeard was always everywhere. Softly whining.
“Good evening, brother mine. So nice to speak to you again.”
Hannah (Irene) acknowledged this with a shrug.
Sherlock leaned forward to set down his mug on the coffee table. “I’ll think about it.”
of them. She’d had it all planned out.
She leaned backwards in her chair again. “So the silversmith was obviously in on this, somehow, but I couldn’t get more information out of him.”
? What was this dream about, then?” John wanted to know.
“You’re right. You’re absolutely right.” Sherlock thought for a minute. “No one else can know until we have Eurus. If she finds out, I shudder to think how she could use it against us.”
John was sure he was in heaven: to see Sherlock beneath him, limp with abandon and preciously smiling with his eyes shut, his legs resting on John’s back, as John’s cock slowly sank into that beautiful, lean body. John was practically gasping for air. And when Sherlock briefly opened his eyes and looked up at him as if John were the only thing that would ever matter to him in the world, John thought he might cry for joy. The intimacy of it all was mind-blowing.
* * * * *
Sally seemed amazed, in an impressed sort of way. “Mary? A secret agent?”
Sherlock stilled and looked at John with eyes overflowing with love, one hand cupping John’s jaw. “I promise,” he said, with the softest smile.
They’d been a perfect team.
“Are you looking forward to moving to your new home?” Sherlock asked, after finishing his muffin.
“Well, you did once say you were married to your work. So you’re just making it official only now, right? I mean, that’s basically what we’re doing, isn’t it?” John teased.
He heard Violet say, “But who invited me then, if you insist that you didn’t?”
She nodded. “Let me see. You’ve either been together for around seven days, seven weeks, or seven months, as that’s always when trouble arises. Which is clearly the case. I think seven weeks, judging by your level of anxiety. You’ve had time to get used to the idea that this was forever and now that some reason has arisen to make you doubt that assumption, your world has been turned upside down.”
Smith’s smile turned to a look of alarm as he backed away, keeping his hands in the air. “Whoa, whoa, whoa!”
Although he looked apprehensive, there was no trace of discomfort in his expression. It was more like awe.
“Right. Just Hannah, then.”
But as soon as his feelings started to take shape in his body, his headache came creeping back in to remind him of the state he was in. He sighed, rolling onto his stomach and pressing his face into the pillow.
Sad feelings. Chest hurt. Old memories.
Sherlock looked over at John, who looked guilty and utterly miserable. Ah, he should probably clear that up. “John, I… er… actually stumbled on purpose, when you let go of me, because I needed to end up in a hospital bed.”
“I think I will. And so should you.”
John looked at him with a kind of desperation in his eyes, apparently willing Sherlock to understand what he was saying. Sherlock didn’t. (
“No idea. Yet.” He drew in a breath. Oxygen and nitrogen molecules colliding. “But I don’t work for free.”
“Oh. That’s good,” John whispered. Molly was always good with Rosie. But he should really have just collected her himself. “Why am I even here?” John asked.
About an hour after the first guests had arrived, when everyone was there and had been provided with drinks, Sherlock suddenly noticed two things.
When he and John walked back down the gravel path between the perfectly shaped buxus bushes and bustling workmen to where a cab was waiting for them, with no new clue whatsoever that could lead to the recovery of the boy, and no specific theories to occupy his mind, Sherlock felt a heavy blackness settle in his stomach. John laid a hand on his shoulder and looked at him with concerned eyes. “You alright?”
Sherlock hummed appreciatively.
There was obviously complete trust between them, which Mycroft found more than a bit disconcerting. He had never expected his brother to trust anyone, once the naivety of youth was gone, convinced Sherlock was like himself in that way. Then again, it seemed Mycroft had also underestimated Sherlock’s faithful blogger. He seemed to have Sherlock completely in his power, having found a way to make Sherlock throw himself in with complete abandon, apparently by giving him exactly what he needed; competently turning that brilliant and restless brain upside down to give it a luxurious holiday – even if it was just for a few minutes.
“Maybe.”
Being made love to by Sherlock was wonderful for entirely different reasons. John didn't really experience the ecstatic physical pleasure that Sherlock usually seemed to feel (even though the initial unpleasant burning sensation had thankfully largely subsided), but having Sherlock be completely in charge of what was happening was incredibly hot in any situation, including during sex. Interestingly, after the first couple of times, most of Sherlock’s insecurity had frequently started to make way for something vaguely authoritative and dominant that John secretly had to admit turned him on no end. On top of which, Sherlock was almost always able to deduce exactly what John was or wasn’t comfortable with, even to the point of knowing precisely what it was he most desperately longed for in each given instant.
Once she’d set the timer and finally sat down across from him at the kitchen table, she managed a tone that sounded both enthusiastic and uninterested at the same time. “Visited Sherrinford? Did you, really? How was it? What painting was he working on?”
And then, the unthinkable happened, right before his eyes.
Eurus would never see her radiant smile again. Never hear that voice. Never touch her skin.
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John fondly looking down at him. His mind was racing to make up some sort of excuse, until he realised he didn’t need one. “You,” he said.
Sherlock chortled. “Good thing you’ve become part of the work anyway,” he said, his voice still slightly thick.

Much like the same thing had saved her own.
“Ah, John. Very fortunate timing.” Sherlock stopped pacing the room for a second and flashed a quick but genuine-looking smile at John, before cheerfully continuing on the same breath: “I’m stuck on this case and could use a fresh view, actually. Maybe you can shed some light on this.”
“Come here,” John said, stretching out his hands toward Sherlock’s.
He listlessly flopped back onto the bed, hugging the garment to his naked body. He threw his head back, closing his eyes as he imagined John was there, hovering over him, partly undressed and with his hard cock patiently leaking pre-cum, as he whispered sweet nothings into Sherlock’s ear like he always did.

“Probably me,” Sherlock shrugged, in an exaggerated display of innocence.
He looked at her performance, at her palette of intense facial expressions and bodily movement, mesmerised.
A chill ran down his spine.
“Because… because you are
Even Sherlock radiated delighted approval at John’s plan. “Would anyone like more tea or coffee?” he asked, getting up to refill the kettle.
John looked up at Sherlock, whose face had a virtually neutral expression.
“So… Will it always be like this?” Sherlock asked, between kisses.
“What word?” Focusing took more effort than it used to.
John’s eyes were still scanning the screen, etched into a deep frown. “No; when you’re being an arse.”
Reluctantly, he picked up. “Yes?”
They both smiled as they sat across from each other at the kitchen table.
An additional surprise was that he found it gave him an appetite – contrary to how his body would have responded during the previous couple of days.
“Maybe.”
According to several sources, it was the magical solution to all interpersonal problems.
Mycroft arrived punctually almost to the second, meaning he’d probably arrived much too early and had waited to enter, Sherlock realised, with an unexpected pang of melancholy.
He looked at Sherlock faintly smiling back at him from his hospital bed. The pompous git of a detective: his best friend in the world. John felt a strange but strong comfort knowing that nothing could ever weaken the bond between them, which was stronger than anybody could explain. Not even his marrying an assassin wife who’d attempted to kill Sherlock had changed anything about that. It didn’t get more outlandish than that, did it?
Initially, she’d declined.
His eyes widened a fraction and his thoughts were put on hold when he spotted a compact blond man with a fur-lined hood, making Sherlock’s heart beat faster for a few moments until the man turned his head to cross the street. It wasn’t him.
“I just have to ration myself,” Sherlock could hear a voice saying, very far away, “choose the right heart to stop. Please, maintain eye contact.
The dog seemed to be fine and simply trotted away when the supply of raisins stopped.
The CT-scan had shown oedema in his head, a slight swelling caused by the blow of the bullet. So they’d put him in a medically induced coma, in order to minimise the chance of brain damage during his recovery. By reducing the metabolic rate of brain tissue, the brain was being protected from more swelling, which could otherwise constrict blood supply and destroy additional brain tissue, the doctors had explained to Sherlock. But that meant John was intubated and ventilated, and there were several monitors continually showing all sorts of readouts that Sherlock could make neither head nor tail of.
If she came over at all.
As far as dreams went, the following months had been like a nightmare. But just as you do in a dream, John had accepted most aspects of it as a reality, in spite of how absurd it all was.
While Rosie read a board book – upside down – he stared at his CMS screen long and hard, trying to think what to write. Something vague but convincing. Something he would say when he was actually mourning a beloved spouse.
It was from an account called OpNorbury, apparently short for
There seemed to be a theme of futuristic science fiction.
The intruder had whipped out a pistol and spun around towards Sherlock, who instantly slapped the gun out of his hand. The man swung the large bag he carried up and towards Sherlock’s head but Sherlock managed to grab it and threw it out of reach before punching the man in the face. They traded blows and kicks for some time, until Sherlock succeeded in pulling the man’s balaclava off.
As Sherlock lapped at the sensitive, pink skin around John’s entrance, he pondered over the strange fact that both ends of the human digestive tract were erogenous zones – for which he’d never encountered a satisfactory scientific explanation. And as far as effectiveness went: while regular kissing provided no waterproof guarantee of getting John hard, rimming most definitely had a very strong effect on his state of arousal.
James clenched his jaw. “So how did you know that the boy was in this room, then?” he spat.
So it was indeed rather unlikely that she hadn’t gone out at all.
anything?” John demanded.
And as Sherlock felt he finally got his brother back, bit by bit, he experienced a new vitality himself as well.
When they went back into the museum to finish looking at the wings they had not yet visited, Sherlock noticed that Sherrinford had shifted his focus. He now spent more time looking at the other visitors as well, at them admiring the art around them.
“One of them called Blessington,” said John.
Finally, after over 2.5 years of working on this fic almost on a daily basis, I’ve now finished writing the entire draft of this story (which has shockingly become more than twice as long as I thought it would be, when I started)! So now it’s just a matter of editing the last three chapters, yay!
“Excellent idea,” Sherlock agreed. “Also, you should sleep.”
God, how could he have been so stupid?
“What were their backgrounds, their nationalities, age group, nicknames, anything?”
once more.”
Weirdly, John had called her only an hour earlier to try to reschedule, saying there had been “some complications” that morning, “which made the timing of their appointment less ideal”.
Sherlock frowned intensely, barely holding it together. He had one of those ridiculous lumps in his throat that he’d forgotten could be real, but he didn’t care. “John, I jumped off that building for
* * * * *
Sherlock smiled tightly. Remembering how much he’d missed John made him physically unwell. Well, more unwell than he already was, anyhow. He looked ahead again.
Resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, Smith patted his back. “Oh, Sherlock!” he said, releasing him. “What can I say? Thanks to you,” he gestured, as he turned to his entourage, “we’re
Sherlock was trying hard not to be sick. Such nausea.
For the following few moments, Greg just stood there gaping at the two of them, seeming to have completely forgotten why he had come to Baker Street in the first place.
John took a spring roll and lifted it to his mouth, but momentarily let it hover there in mid-air as he was trying to see a solution.
“Thank you,” Sherlock replied, smiling as he took it. “Actually, a very apt place just occurred to me for us to buy our rings.”
He’d spent the previous two days solving a case for Lestrade and was feeling full of energy. John had mainly been busy with his book project and his not-so-secret party preparations, which were amusing to witness as well.
Without answering, she took an unused evidence bag from her pocket and, turning it inside out, she picked the paper up without touching it.
Something in John’s demeanour suddenly changed. He looked at Sherlock with a concerned frown etched into his face. “Look, we don’t have to do this now. If you’d rather wait...”
Within moments, Sherlock was
John felt his blood start to boil.
In Hjerkinn, they were having a rest sitting on a fallen tree trunk one morning, when Rosie first said her own name. They’d just had a drink and when John put the bottle back into his bag, she spotted the bread he carried with him. “Lowey, bred!” She signed the words for “I” and “bread” along as she said it.
mere hours prior. With his Mind Palace still undergoing major refurbishing in the background, Sherlock was now expected to acquaint John’s arse with anal sex. To finger him. But how in heaven’s name could he finger John if he wouldn’t be able to feel whether he was doing it right? When he’d practiced on himself, it had been a delicate process of trial and error to figure out how he liked it – by simply altering the angle or pressure when it didn’t feel good – but at least he had been able to judge for himself and adjust what he was doing accordingly. But he couldn’t just copy-and-paste that onto John, could he? Just as panic threatened to crash over him, he realised that he should simply read John’s face. It was always an open book, but especially so during sex.
He couldn’t bear it, because Sherlock was the one person John trusted most in the world. Perhaps even the
“I trust your instincts,” John simply said. “Shall we get our coats and take the tube to Paddington train station?”
There was another short silence.
come across as annoyingly content. Mycroft had stupidly assumed that had been because of the rather major case he had just solved – though that had been more than two days prior; he should have known that effect would have long faded.
. At least he talks back and tells you when you’re rambling.”
“No, John. I’ve told you, I don’t have a sister.”
It wasn’t as if Sherlock had actually taken Eurus at her word when she accused his mother of plagiarism (obviously), but the idea had still taken residence somewhere in a corner of his mind. He wouldn’t have put it past his mum to do something like that if she was somehow convinced it was her right to do so.
As instructed, Molly took off her light pink summer cardigan – while continuing to balance Rosie on one hip and then the other, which was quite a hassle – and switched it for the green one she’d been carrying with her in a flowery, orange-coloured plastic bag. Turning the bag inside out so only the plain white side showed, she stuffed her first cardigan in there. Pulling the elastic out of her hair and shaking it loose, she stepped outside, with two bags and a baby, to where an agent stood smoking a cigarette. Without inhaling, she noticed. But it gave the man an inconspicuous reason to stand there, she supposed.
John couldn’t remember the last time he had slept this soundly.
“That was...” Sherlock couldn’t quite find either the words or the energy to utter them, and just settled for a heavenly smile that came completely natural in the moment and that he was sure would convey the same meaning.
Although… were those last two things really facts? Nobody had actually seen it happen, had they? The nanny had seen part of it, but only from a distance.
“You said it didn’t the last time and it wouldn’t with Sherlock, so who was it the last time? Who were you talking about?”
John was gripping Sherlock’s shoulder blades tightly, fingers digging into his flesh, firm and real. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he mumbled, and then lunged in for another sloppy kiss. With his hands he seemed to try to hold Sherlock everywhere at once, restlessly caressing his torso and shoulders.
John had decided to come here again straight after work, in spite of Sherlock’s aloof behaviour the previous evening.

“I saw you take it! I saw you!” As he spoke, he pointed his right arm at Smith, brandishing the scalpel he was in fact holding himself.
Yes, Mary had been good at hiding her tracks.
“Yeah,” Sherlock replied.

But it was as if earth’s gravity had suddenly become stronger. The bed pulled him back down like a magnet.
Sherlock frowned.
* * * * *
A loud, indignant baby cry from upstairs momentarily pulled Sherlock’s attention away. At the same time, it reminded him of something he’d been meaning to ask Mycroft.
Apparently it was.
Sherlock’s Italian was just good enough to know that these sentences meant: ‘The special black pearl has disappeared’, ‘The special one is still not found’, ‘Speculations about the lost special one continue’ and ‘English police still baffled by the lost special one’.
Each of the passers-by had their own unique characteristics, of which nobody seemed aware but him. It was hard not to observe their destinations and motives, just as it would be hard for other people not to see it if the information had been written all over them in graffiti. The woman on her way to a lunch date; the man who had obviously just been fired from a bank; the old lady walking her neighbour’s dog because her own had passed away.
Sherlock had been more than a bit clumsy, but thorough, and adorable. Not to mention incredibly sexy, despite his inexperience. Or perhaps because of it? There was something exceptionally pure and sincere about him whenever they were being intimate.
John’s cock had become almost painfully hard and was awkwardly leaking precum. He had a hard time keeping his voice steady as he replied, “Oh, Jesus, Sherlock, do you even have to ask?”
He noticed Mycroft looking awfully pleased in the background – undoubtedly glad he might soon be able to stop renting more and more storage space for all the canvases.
Since Rosie had been born, Sherlock had learnt about the schedules one needed to stick to with babies, if you wanted to have any peace left at all. So he took John’s time indication very seriously.
Upon coming out of the shop – wearing his new shades – he found Sherlock on his knees, petting a dog that had been temporarily tied to a lamppost by its owner. It was a large, friendly setter, its chestnut coat gleaming in the bright light.
He reluctantly turned his head back far enough to be able to look at the screen once more from the corner of his eyes. No. It definitely didn’t look like that. Sherlock was completely relaxed and enjoying himself infinitely more than Mycroft could bear to witness.
And to keep him from drinking.
“I thought there was champagne?” Sherlock objected half-heartedly.
“Has he attempted to make contact with you?”
“Well, even though you can probably ascertain beyond doubt at any given time that those rings are ours, should they ever temporarily leave our fingers for whatever reason – by the size and by the amount and distribution of sebum and so on – for the rest of us it might be useful to include a more specific clue.”
Sherlock had had no idea that this was what it would feel like. John’s mouth was soft and warm, and with it he was doing things to him that he hadn’t known were possible; alternately licking, kissing and sucking different parts (and all of them) of his prick.
Half an hour later, they were in bed together.
“And they’ve got these little red leaves in little circles all over the airplane,” the girl went on. “What are they called again? You know, just like those leaves on the syrup bottles, and the one on our school flag.”
Was he blushing? Actually, he didn’t care if he was.
Thank heavens not sulking. If anyone is going to sulk right now, it’s John and not his idiot brilliant flatmate, thank you very much.
properly. He’d disguised himself dozens of times in the past and it had always worked.
He let out a slow breath.
-- Call me as soon as convenient. SH
Sherlock simply smiled and gestured one hand vaguely towards Arnold while maintaining eye contact with Sherrinford, encouraging his brother to keep observing him.
“Oh, you’re
“Ah well, once I realised that the shorter corridor on this floor indicated the presence of a hidden room, added to the fact that you are familiar with building work yourself, I figured you’d have found this the ideal place to hide the boy, since you could easily bring food and water to him unnoticed.”
Sherlock tentatively smiled at John.
There was a short silence.
“Some more unlucky than others,” the builder said, as something dark flickered across his face, before he merrily continued, “I especially love the roses. My mother’s name was Rose. She would have
He thought about therapy. (Although he would only be able to talk about his guilt in the vaguest of terms, of course). But Ella had never really been able to help him in any meaningful way. If anything, she was the one who had ill-fatedly talked him into trusting people more – which hadn’t worked out very nicely for him at all. (Although that was hardly her fault, of course.) But moreover, her practice was so far from where he now lived that it would take him longer to get there than the duration of a session. And he didn’t feel like organising a babysitter for all that travelling time. Still, he felt he needed someone to help sort out the mess inside of his head. If not, he knew it would only get worse.
Eventually, they lay chest to chest, almost as if gluing themselves together with cum, Sherlock thought amusedly. The disappointment he had felt half an hour ago was gone completely and replaced by utter happiness (of a magnitude and intensity he hadn’t imagined possible a week ago).
Sherlock couldn’t help but feel relieved that Mary was out of the picture (and safely incarcerated under Mycroft’s beady eyes), even though all he wanted was for John to be happy – and she
“Greg, you need to investigate this man,
* * * * *
“John,” was all Sherlock said. He sounded relieved.
But how about Sherrinford’s second crime, at the first facility he’d been in? He’d opened the gas in his residential unit and locked everyone inside.
Sherlock nodded bashfully. “I’ve never loved anyone before this, John,” he then said. “And for the longest time, I didn’t think I ever would. But when you came into my life five years ago, it was very hard
In the course of October, after several weeks of their intensive lessons, it did become clear that the language was harder for Sherrinford to learn than it was for Sherlock, as he didn’t yet know any language at all that he could relate it to. The whole principle of vocabulary and grammar was entirely new to him. His thoughts had presumably always consisted of mere concepts and ideas, of course, rather than actual words or sentences arranged according to some arbitrarily established syntax.
He did.
He was determined to reconnect with him, in order to
She spoke again before he could. “I… I’ve been reading Doctor Watson’s blog. He’s… your
.” He smirked and raised an eyebrow like it was a joke referring to Sherlock’s fake relationship with Janine, or his apparently unknown sexual orientation. But Sherlock knew it was much more than that, of course. He’d understood since a while now how important honesty was for John, in all aspects of their lives, and he’d slowly started to see the point of it himself as well. He’d been working hard to get better and better at not withholding stuff, even when he thought the matter at hand was quite obvious (which he apparently wasn’t a very good judge of, he’d found out by trial and error). For both their sakes. “Yes, John. I promise I try very hard not to do that anymore. I’ll try even harder.”
While Sherlock and John prepared dinner, Sherrinford sat in the lounge with Chloe and drew funny animals for her in his sketchbook, making her giggle out loud.
“John, I want
John grinned, quirking an eyebrow, and squeezed Sherlock’s knee. “You? Keep bees?”
“Oh yes, quite sure. In fact, I’m rather hoping they will come out of the weekend as contented as we are, as a result.”
For this chapter, I would like to thank
All he could do was hope that this David bastard with whom Mary had cheated on him – obviously unprotected as she had managed to get pregnant –  wasn’t the type to collect body fluid contagions from across London. Anyway, he would soon find out.
He felt, simply, happy. (And that word did not even make him want to vomit anymore.)
And he felt certain that Sherrinford could read all that quite accurately from his face.
“Fine,” he replied, shifting slightly to rest on his elbows. “Weak.”
When they finally did, he ventured a more active attempt at seducing John. Before they got undressed, he cupped John’s face in his hands and kissed him. John kissed him back, but as soon as they broke contact, he turned away and left for the bathroom. Was John upset with him? No, there was definitely a relaxed smile on his face. It seemed he just wasn’t that interested. Again.
After their ways parted, John travelled back to London. He first went to take the medicine box to New Scotland Yard for fingerprinting, enjoying the impressed faces of the DI in charge and also Moore, who happened to be on duty. When he walked out into the now rather hot summer sun again, planning to hail a cab, he heard a familiar voice call his name.
She was content to have found a parking spot at reasonable walking distance from Baker Street – but also very glad for her folding umbrella.
John had finished, in the end, of course, after Sherlock had solved the case (and texted Lestrade from their bed). Sherlock had made sure of that. It had just taken quite a bit of extra effort.
John briefly smiled at him, before another silence settled over the room.
“Dada!” Chloe shouted, enthusiastically waving the box in front of Sherlock.
“Only very sporadically. As long as he can paint and he has his cats, he’s happy, it seems.”
“Hm, I thought so too. Ever been to Scandinavia?”
The Ledbury indeed was the perfect setting for Sherlock’s set-up. It was modern, with stylish chandeliers and long curtains not quite covering ceiling-high mirrors – and, most importantly, obviously expensive.
John wrapped his arms a little more tightly around his lover, who was already fast asleep, before drifting off himself as well.
John had always wondered what it would be like to give a blowjob – although not in the sense that he’d ever actually
Sherlock looked at the sight before him. There was John. Lying in his bed.
“Ah. Still a horror story,” John said, flatly.
He should not always be the one topping. It wasn’t fair on Sherlock to keep doing it this way. He should really just give him a blowjob instead, John decided, because he hadn’t done that in way too long.
As he continued to stare at the motionless silhouette of the most important person in his life, his thoughts bitterly drifted back to the sick individual who had deliberately harmed John in this way.
John was chewing his lips to suppress a giggle at Sherlock’s perfect imitation of a Very Nice But Slightly Scatterbrained Man. Even though John had often wished Sherlock were a bit more considerate, hearing him like this positively made John cringe, making him realise once more that he would in reality never want Sherlock to change a single nerve-ending in his brain. They fit perfectly together just as it was and John felt a fresh eruption of butterflies in his stomach just thinking about it.
They briefly pressed their lips together.
“Do you have a name?”
As nervous and afraid as Sherlock was to mess it up, John seemed to need this as much as he himself once had, three months prior, and the open expression on John’s face suddenly made it very easy to push in.
Still, he was reluctant to mention it to John. With the anxiety he still suffered upon leaving the flat, a holiday didn’t seem like a particularly good idea.
Judging by the way John was kissing him, Sherlock was now quite sure there would be plenty more to follow in the future.
Two years ago, when I started working on this fic (right after S4 aired), I first spent *weeks* trying to come up with a believable scenario that left Sherlock traumatized by something involving his dog (as was hinted at several times in the show). Also, there had to be a mysterious sibling ("The Other One" as he was referred to in two different episodes), and it had to be explained why Sherlock never talked about him. I hope the explanation I came up with is satisfactory! :)
! Oh my goodness, you’re the replacement!”
John blinks, briefly looking down at Sherlock’s fly and back up at his face again. There is a spark there, behind that impassive mask, and maybe something of a silent plea, even.
He swallowed.
“Well, yeah.” John cleared his throat. “She sometimes gives… her view on things.”
Sherlock didn’t flinch. In fact, his lips parted surprisingly pliantly beneath John’s and their tongues touched more elaborately than they had before, sending shockwaves of goosebumps down John’s back.
Then, a quick sketch of a plane.
“Won’t you get fed up with me?”
“Oh, Rosamund isn’t going to like this. No witnesses,” AJ had muttered, as he gritted his teeth.
“Well, that sounds like an amazing job Greg did there.” John lowered only one of his eyebrows, unimpressed. “No trace of her, of course.”
As they ate, they talked about several old cases, reminiscing over particularly funny or bizarre twists they had witnessed together.
Sherlock briefly opened his eyes to see John had crawled back towards him and was now tentatively touching himself as he lay on his side next to Sherlock.
* * * * *
“Hello, Mr Putting-The-Baker-In-Baker-Street,” Sherlock teased, as he wrapped his arms around John from behind and smelled his hair. His favourite kind of John-hug.
John felt horrible, once more, about not telling her of aunt Viv’s condition. But he quickly convinced himself yet again that it simply hadn’t been an option, despite how it made him feel, or her sacrifice might very well all have been for nothing.
John cleared his throat, choosing not to dwell on what Mycroft said just now. “Did you know he was back on drugs?”
John shook his head.
After Sally Donovan had stopped asking him questions, apparently satisfied that she’d heard all there was to know from his side of this bizarre story, Sherlock walked back to Lestrade’s office. He knew the building and its corridors and staircases well, of course, yet everything felt different today. He took every flight of stairs, every turn, as if he were walking through an underwater world. He didn’t hear any of the voices of the people he passed, noticed their movements only as in a blurred slow motion.
“No she didn’t.”
“That doesn’t even mean anything.”
John turned around in his embrace to face Sherlock, and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck, softly sobbing about the decades-old grief that had been part of him all this time, and forever would be.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and instantly both knew there was no reason to quickly sit up and pretend they hadn’t been snuggling. They yelled ‘yes!’ before unhurriedly starting to disentangle their limbs.
in the simultaneous sensation of blood rushing, skin flushing and vision narrowing down to only each other.
She droned on for a bit about incomprehensible things, before telling him, “Go to hell, Sherlock.”
When he told his therapist, full of emotion, that he was letting his daughter down, he mused that it was maybe because he did, in fact, feel rather guilty for every second he was letting someone else take care of her. But she’d only been in nursery for two weeks. Every parent probably felt horrible during those first days, he told himself. Still, he enjoyed exaggerating his feeling to his therapist just for the sake of it. Weird. He’d never really been one to twist the truth for no reason. Perhaps it was because there were so many other feelings he couldn’t talk about, so all he could do was transfer them onto something else.
Most of the time, ever since their childhood, it had just been the two of them, even after Rose Moran had come drifting along to join them.
The earl looked positively perplexed. “I gave that handkerchief to Rose almost thirty years ago. Before she broke my heart and told me we’d better stop seeing each other.”
When John subtly shook his head, Sherlock hesitantly sat down in the chair next to him.
Don’t worry about the next chapter, by the way, because it’s not as angsty as you might think. :) This is a fix-it, after all!
“Why not change name?”
She took off her glasses, blinking as her vision adjusted. “Culverton gave me Faith’s original note,” she said, standing up. “A mutual friend put us in touch.”
There was a short, comfortable silence.
For instance, until last night, she’d been terrified that the little bee teddy she had been crocheting for Rosie might remain unfinished. She knew it was silly, really, but now that she’d attached its little wings, it was as if a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. It was done.
When Ophelia number Two entered, he was less distracted by the quality of her acting, and more focussed on ruling out the possibility that this could be Miss Moriarty. Her jawline was similar, as was the position of the eyes, but not the shape. Make-up could do wonders, though.
Sherlock put a hand on his back and nudged him closer.
Only since falling in love with Briony had she really understood the importance of having a home filled with love to come back to. To keep you grounded.
John then took his face in both hands and pressed a kiss to his lips, bringing Sherlock back to the present and away from useless worries. Sherlock allowed his mind to drift and his body to relax, knowing that his brain would subconsciously continue to process data and connect threads regardless, or actually even better, when not consciously trying to think. Slowly, John kissed a trail down his throat, then down his chest, taking the time to worship every square inch of skin that his lips touched.
“I need to know what to do. About John,” he stated.
He was past the point of shame of asking The Government (as Sherlock still referred to Mycroft) for help, by now.
“Er… I didn’t… er…”

The world seemed to stop spinning.
The truth was, he could never be happy without John. He had definitely not been entirely happy in this limbo he’d been living in, having John near but
He did, however, very much mind his currently empty stomach; he was ravenous and couldn’t wait to have something to eat.
“I guess, yeah.” Something about Greg indicated, however, that his joy at this was not entirely uninhibited. “She is really great, you know, but we’ve also had a couple of pretty far-reaching misunderstandings, and… It’s just, you know, being the old fogey that I am, and after my spectacularly failed marriage, I sometimes worry that maybe I just don’t
“Don’t get out yet.” Sherlock wriggled his hand between them. “I want to come with you inside me.”
* * * * *
“I’m not one of your doctors,” Sherlock replied, more firmly this time.
On Boxing Day, Sherlock woke up to the smell of freshly baked bread.
Sherlock looked at the paper in his hands again, noticing that his fingers were trembling.
So that’s how he found himself walking over to Mrs Robins’s house during his lunch break again on a sunny Friday at the end of July.
As John and Sherlock looked at each other, there was the welcome sound of a helicopter approaching, quickly making any sort of conversation impossible with its noise.
, he told himself.
A director somewhere called, “Set; and action!”
John smirked wryly. “Yeah, it gets worse. In my dream, the ring I had for Mary was really old and ugly, talking about symbolic. Before popping the question, when Mary went to the washroom, I took it out and I kept rotating it in the light to make the three little diamonds sparkle, but they wouldn’t. They looked a bit like the worn glass you find washed up on the beach.” He sighed. “But the absolute pinnacle of the dream was, that once I recognised you, the first thing you did was make some stupid joke about moustaches, so I angrily grabbed your lapels and pushed you back onto the floor, ending up lying flat on top of you in the middle of an extremely fancy restaurant, he-he,” John chuckled hoarsely.
For the first time in years, Sherlock felt at peace. His withdrawal symptoms had faded into the background, and John was visibly recovering day by day.
bad idea), John’s cock springs to attention as it’s freed from trousers and pants – only inches away from Sherlock’s face.
The next moment, he was as lost as Alice had been in Wonderland upon reaching the bottom of the rabbit hole. He found himself in a corridor with lots of doors, all similar-looking and none giving any clues as to where the builder had disappeared to. But knowing that he’d entered not only the house, but also one of the rooms, was enough of a good catch as far as today’s quest for intelligence went, anyway. So when Sherlock heard a lady's footsteps approaching around the bend at the far end of the corridor, he decided he wasn’t going to risk getting caught trespassing in this disguise and silently left the way he’d come: out of the door, and off the premises onto the sun-drenched country road, back into civilisation – facts spinning through his head and slowly coalescing into preliminary theories.
Sherlock laughed. “You maintain an

After John had left Scotland Yard for home, Sherlock slumped back down in the chair in Lestrade’s office and meekly waited for the finalisation of the paperwork that required his signatures.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but John hushed him. “I don’t just mean about this. Actually, I meant something else entirely.” He sighed. “A year ago, we agreed it was important to have complete openness and honesty, after… after Mary shot you. But to me, that is
John decided to stoically keep up a conversation about inconsequential things, chattering about the weather, the breed of cows in one of the meadows they passed, the new railway company on the connecting line that he’d heard was in danger of going bankrupt already.

It was the one time he was glad for having a slight cold. He sniffed, “yes please,” and made a show of wiping his nose appropriately.

“I see. Is there any particular kink you’d like to tell me about?” John replied, not bothering to hide his grin.
There was something desperate about Sherlock, something John had never seen in him before. Almost pleading, submissive. And it was breathtakingly beautiful.
The goldsmith, with raised eyebrows, started to say something about the collection date, when Sherlock turned around, wavering slightly on his feet as he clumsily made his way to the door, where he rather elegantly collapsed onto the floor.
“And remember that time Lestrade was onto this smuggling ring,” John recalled, “and it turned out they were smuggling gay pornographic art back into China in the same vases they had hidden the tiger balm and rhino powder in on the way here? God, I’ll never forget the look on his face when he found that painting with the all-male orgy, thinking that his tips had been worthless. I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled myself.” John chuckled at the memory. “I think Lestrade was rather glad for your exceptional observational skills at that particular moment. Within about thirty seconds you had found and identified the traces of powder inside the pottery, preventing him from making a complete fool out of himself.”
Thank you so much for all your lovely comments. They are the fuel that keeps me going. :)
. Letting my creativity flow. I’m writing a story.”
Sherlock let out a long breath. “Rarely pure and never simple,” he said.
“Kiss me,” came a whisper from the shadows right in front of him, startlingly close.
Honestly, nothing had ever felt so good in his life. Ever.
“I must be hallucinating,” Sherlock muttered faintly – not entirely serious, but those were the only words that would come. In spite of everything, it was still a scenario he could not dismiss entirely.
Blackbeard’s little tail was beating wildly against her basket, as Chloe was trying to climb in with her.
“John, is this... will it always be like this?”
“Oh yes, that would be ever so kind of you,” Sherlock replied, somewhat subdued and still trembling a bit – rather convincingly, John thought – and he gave a fake address, which, knowing him, was probably the actual street where Bob and Jack lived.
John leans back against the worktop, suddenly tired. “I know you will ridicule me for wanting this,
Finally, John continued, “I’m personally not particularly comfortable with the idea of anything up my arse either. I totally understand. It’s all fine. I just... I love you.”

“Er…” There is a short silence, which Sherlock apparently attempts to overcome by frowning very hard. Eventually, he tersely states, “Pretty much, yes.”

“Don’t ask me
Two weeks from now should be enough time. Friday, early afternoon, just after lunch.
Absurd as it was, the mysterious ‘E’ (which was all she’d written below her number on the little slip of paper she’d given him) provided him with what felt like a much healthier mental outlet for his need for intimacy than either Mary or Sherlock could provide.
All in all, this lunch gathering was a very interesting experience, to say the least.
“Yeah.” John turned his head to brush his lips against Sherlock’s jaw. “Either you or Rosie seem to have a positive influence on my sister.” He smiled.
And Sherlock could focus on reconnecting with Sherrinford, restoring normalcy to his family.
Strange things were happening in John’s stomach when Sherlock started to finger himself in earnest. Sherlock was so uncommonly beautiful, lying there on his back with his gorgeous long legs spread wide and this one incredible finger elegantly moving in and out of him while subtle noises of satisfaction escaped his throat.
“Indeed. What
“John?” he tried softly.
John felt sick thinking about it.
, right?”
“I don’t think so.”
It was a sunny afternoon in mid-August when John was discharged and they took a cab home. Through a very unfortunate – not to say hellish – combination of a broken cab engine in the middle of Tower Bridge – where it was impossible to get out and hail another cab – and a subsequent gridlock, it took three hours before they finally arrived at Baker Street.
* * * * *
No, not John: Culverton Smith. Their hair was very similar.
He briefly knocked, before opening the door to Lestrade’s familiar office.
Quietly, but with a hint of raw anger in her voice, she added, “I never had a best friend. I had
He would come back as soon as he’d spoken to Lestrade.
That’s what Jim Moriarty had called him, according to Irene.
“You don’t think he was abducted?” John asked, quietly.
“Around six, I should think,” John answered.
It had been his very last few still functioning brain cells that had made Sherlock tell John that he needed to practice bottoming first, as the rest of his mind was overwhelmed with both arousal and apprehension.
Time for a full evening of telly and a large bag of chocolate chip cookies. And possibly a bottle of wine. No,
He was actually bloody smiling, the sod.

, that it summoned the strangest sensation in Sherlock of wanting to be even closer than this. His tongue was already inside John’s mouth, their hands were all over each other, ensuring almost full-body contact and still, it was not enough.
“I think I do, actually. Thanks,” Hannah said. She gratefully collapsed onto the sofa and, with a relieved sigh, took out her phone.
Now that the heartbreak over losing Rose had faded to a dull background pain that only flared up occasionally – much like her grief over Jim had – rather than continuing to paralyse her, her brother’s and her lover’s memory now gave her the strength to do what she thought they would have done, if they’d still been there.
His gaze shifted sideways to the floor, his shoulders slumped.
“Have you taken any antibiotics against that ear infection two months ago?” he enquired.
“No, seemed a bit rude. And there was no need, what with all the bloody Mickey Mouse and Spiderman merchandise all about the place.”
“Erm, no. I watched on my laptop. Never mind.” He looked away at nothing in particular.
After having lived in solitude for so long and being accustomed to only the most surface level type of communication, the wonderful effects of unrestrained, open dialogue were like a mystery revealed. Having everything stated openly turned out to make so many things so much easier. No energy spent on guessing or deducing the other one’s thoughts, feelings or motivations.
--” Suddenly, she spotted a belt where there shouldn’t be a belt: just above John’s knees. It was open. In the flash of clarity that followed, she noticed another belt telling the same story: lying discarded on the floor, next to a heap consisting of what was obviously a pair of Sherlock’s trousers, topped with… his pants.
The minute they entered the tea garden, they were heartily welcomed by the lady of the house, and directed to a little round table in a cosy and rather private corner of the garden under a torrent of cheerful chatter about how Sherlock (William) had grown. John stifled a grin.
He would do anything to save John from future harm by this psychopathic woman.
; the only person who’d ever vaguely looked out for her. She angrily squeezed her eyes shut against the tears that were about to well up as soon as she allowed herself to feel how much she missed him.
Pretending to be unaffected, Sherlock continued, “As unconventional as this might be from a pedagogical perspective, I’m going to give you your reward
She’d tricked him into texting with her, telling her all sorts of personal details. And she’d obviously deliberately targeted him,
“Yes, I did. They were those round little blue pills. Mr Cargill prescribed them for me. I got them from that new pharmacy on Bickenhall Street.”
There was a short silence during which Sherlock looked at him with the most sincere and open expression John had ever seen on his face.
“Stop lying to me, Sherlock! Why do you always lie?!”
Sherlock then gestured towards the therapist standing in the consultation room with a phone to her ear. “Who’s this one? Is this a new person? I’m
After a brief silence, he laughed, looking the other way. “Come on, let’s get something to eat.”
After having let Sherlock frantically run around the flat for some time, looking for clues himself (and not finding anything the Yard hadn’t already documented) while John finished answering Greg’s questions, John eventually handed Rosie to Hannah.
back home at Baker Street, didn’t you?” His cheeks reddened slightly as he looked away, in an apparent attempt at being casual. “Tell her I say hello,” he nodded towards the phone. Then, grinning, he huffed out a breath. “
John huffed out a breath. He definitely didn’t see any ‘romantic entanglement’ for himself in the future, no more than he saw any for Sherlock. It had taken John long enough to fall into that trap and he wasn’t willing to try that ever again. It had almost cost him his life. And Sherlock’s.
“You’ve got a scalpel!” Sherlock yelled. “You picked it up from that table.” He blindly pointed to the tray which was then several feet away from him. There was clearly a gap in the row of scalpels and only five remained. “I saw you take it.”
When one day, an innocent-looking ginger girl flirted with him on the bus, he saw the perfect opportunity. He needed someone else. Someone who wasn’t a psychopath, for once, thank you very much.
Nevertheless, he didn’t look away. “You, however,” he said, willing himself not to show any emotion and to appear unperturbed, “deliberately shot John in the head at close distance.” But God, he was exhausted, and all but overflowing with an explosive mix of rage and sorrow. “We are
“She, er… She,” John stammered, shyly, “she chose the ring. Adamant about the orange.”
“I’m sorry?” Sherlock said, flabbergasted.
killer?!” He then took a large mouthful of cereal and chewed on it for a bit, before turning away and spitting it out in a bucket that was being held up for him.
“Nothing more than a few theories, I’m afraid,” Sherlock replied. “Which is why I requested to visit you here and have a look around, learn a bit more about Arthur and his family.”
Reaching for the teddy, which was behind a small pile of books on the bedside table next to her, cost an infuriating amount of effort. Once her stubborn fingers had eventually gotten proper hold of the thing, she fell back onto her pillow with a suppressed gasp, clutching the bee to her chest.
With many thanks once more to Ariane DeVere for her transcripts from the show, in this case the morgue scene.
and that was the main thing, for now.
Sherlock spent a good deal of his nights simply staring at the sleeping miracle beside him.
“That was...” Sherlock couldn’t quite find either the words or the energy to utter them, and just settled for a heavenly smile that came completely natural in the moment and that he was sure would convey the same meaning.
Over the noise of tires screeching, Greg bellowed, “I
“Um, hel-hello,” she said. “Is, er... I’m sorry, Sh-Sherlock asked me to come. I didn’t know that you were gonna be here.”
After the initial alarm of hearing those words had subsided, a relaxation set in that bordered on drowsiness, causing him to belatedly realise that John had gotten up into a half-sitting position and was spreading his kisses out all over Sherlock’s torso.
“Saline?” John frowned, relief slowly washing over him.
He half lifted himself to look at Sherlock.
It really shouldn’t make any difference. Still, he estimated he was smiling at least 67 percent more since he’d invalidated his late nemesis’s stupid nickname for him.
He was Sherlock’s now.
John’s giggling only increased at this. Sherlock rushed to the kitchen to get a towel to clean them up, a grin tugging at the corners of this mouth at the potential slapstick level of the situation as he awkwardly hopped back to the sofa, where John was still lying helplessly stranded and covered in cum.
“If they found out it was you who did it, you certainly wouldn’t be fine,” he could hear Mary’s snarky voice telling him, like a little devil sitting on a cartoon character’s shoulder.
“So what has all this got to do with me?” John asked.
John pressed his lips together, trying hard not to overly display his arousal. This could be him. This could be him, sliding in and out of Sherlock.
Vivian smiled too. “You take care of him, John. Promise me?”
“No, I didn’t, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis. Don’t really need to check that the angle’s consistent with self-harm, do I?”
Carefully, he pushed one finger in, just half an inch.
While John, positioned in a corner as unobtrusively as possible with his tiny cup of lukewarm tea, tried to figure out how to carry himself more or less like a lady so as not to make a complete fool out of himself, Sherlock managed to interrogate his suspects apparently in a subtle enough way not to get kicked out prematurely – because they weren’t; quite to John’s relief. (He didn’t want to imagine the scene that would ensue if they were.) Unfortunately, one of the lads decided meanwhile to try and make him feel at home by striking up a conversation with him.
It had been a while since he’d last flown. It made him feel light, free.
(21 May)
John nodded, contemplating cracking a joke about being sure to make note of it if he saw an especially nice one. Instead, he decided to do that with a look, which did not escape Sherlock’s notice and elicited a half-heartedly hidden smile that sent wonderful shivers down John’s spine.
A couple of days went by with Sherlock poring over the Abergavenny file again, taking all the crime scene pictures off the wall and putting them up again in a different composition, enabling him to scrutinise every detail quite literally from another angle.
She stared at the note pinned to the noticeboard in her kitchen, that Culverton Smith had once given to Jim when they’d made this ridiculous bet. Smith had been an acquaintance of Jim’s, who had appreciated Smith for his like-minded cleverness. He had known exactly what sort of things Smith was up to, and – obsessed as he had been with Sherlock Holmes – had claimed that it wouldn’t be very difficult for someone like Holmes to find him out also.
Sherlock beamed at him as he got up from the table. “Come on, John! We’re going to Hell!”
they would get together,” he said, letting his fingers dance over Sherlock’s skin. “Might actually have encouraged it.” There was now a decidedly proud smirk on his face.
“Oh, it is. We’re just taking it easy, with Rosie and all.”
“Look at that energetic ballerina,” John chuckled. “It won’t take long before she can stand by herself.”
“By the way, I love your eyeshadow! Where did you get it from?” John countered enthusiastically, steering the conversation away from cross-dressing clubs and their locations before it could come to light that he knew absolutely nothing on the subject.
Still, Sherlock had been determined to come down here. He currently stood looking around, his eyes narrowed, apparently tuning in to the environment in that way he did.
“Oh god, Sherlock…” John’s breath hitched with every syllable.
. So… are you serious about this?”
He sighed, suddenly remembering reading about an artist who had used light-emitting shoelaces spinning around to make long exposure photographs, that made them look just like beautiful glass vases. She’d even called them ‘Light vases’ even though they were just spinning shoelaces. The vases on the pictures didn’t exist. Much like the picture that Sherlock was now painting to Sally about the current situation, and which matched rather seamlessly with all the evidence at hand.
In a flash of a moment, Sherlock was reminded of another shocked couple in a similarly fancy restaurant, and he quickly pushed the memory away. John had forgiven him and all had turned out well.
He was well aware they’d let you rent almost anything these days.
“Da!” Rosie yelled excitedly.
“Oh, yes, maybe you could write a monograph about me,” John suggested cheekily, pressing his lips softly to Sherlock’s jawline.
John smiled, still amazed at the turn his life had taken. Despite their extremely bumpy start, being with Sherlock was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
A chill ran down his spine.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, contemplating. “Well, in my case I suppose it was fear of rejection,” he said softly, looking at John from the corner of his eye. “Despite all my deduction skills, I could never figure out how you felt about me. Ever since we met, I’ve considered that my greatest flaw.” He paused. “Perhaps I was blinded by fear. Fear of being rejected and then losing you.”
In short, being in a relationship with Sherlock was like looking at a diamond, with countless different facets all reflecting the light differently: each beautiful in their own right.
Sherlock shook his head to expel all other thoughts, like a dog ridding himself of unpleasant raindrops. It worked.
John tried to get hold of Sherlock’s cock to stroke him, but that turned out to be altogether a bit too ambitious: to his own frustration he couldn’t maintain the same angle and rhythm while leaning only on one arm. And he was close now, so very close. He could already feel the beginnings of a dizzying whirl gradually building up inside, until it suddenly over-flowed his being and erased everything around him, annihilating along with it any reluctance to cry out an elaborate string of primordial syllables that meant nothing and everything at the same time.
Sherlock technically didn’t know any of this. At least, he never asked or brought up any part of her current private life in their occasional text exchanges. Those were usually about little mysteries either of them was trying to solve and could use the other one’s input in. Or just plain banter.
But there was also still Rosie. What to do about her? Even if Sherlock arranged security at her nursery, where would she stay the rest of the time? He briefly thought of Molly, or Mrs Hudson. They were Rosie’s godmothers and sometimes looked after her, he knew. But if one of them were to take care of her, there would still have to be added security in their home. Then again, wasn’t that necessary anyway? Wasn’t everybody Sherlock cared about a target right now, once again?
just so that her lies would stay safe. And that her moral compass was basically… non-existent.
“I do understand.” Naturally, John knew exactly what it was like to miss someone that badly without knowing what had happened to them and also how it felt when other people couldn’t grasp the depth of these emotions. John couldn’t come up with a single thing to ask Craig anymore and dug for his card in his inner coat pocket. Handing it to the lad, he said, “Please let me know if you remember anything that could be useful for us to know.”
“Back to your stalker. Have you ever seen him interact with anyone?”
“First of all,” John said,” I still love you just as much, and I have no intention whatsoever of leaving you. Ever. You hear me?”
She’d already called and texted a number of people – Mycroft and Greg, among others – and now the flat was silent again.
Upon reaching the landing, the living room door flew open and John came out and hugged him. For several long moments, they just clung to one another, burying their faces in each other’s necks.
Sherlock shook his head and pressed the sides of his thumbs to his eyes as he screwed them shut. He flailed wildly, groaning and opening his eyes wide. As Smith’s manic cackling continued, Sherlock buried his head in his hands, then turned away from him, bumping into a tray on a stand. The tray rattled noisily and he pretended to flinch away, focusing briefly on the row of six scalpels lying on it.
Stealthily, she took another few fast steps towards the bedroom door, which was not entirely closed, and saw a hand appear, pointing a gun at the bed.
* * * * *
When he turned, she spoke. “Hello.” She had decided to use a northern inflection, seeing as men were always extra likely to fall for any kind of different sounding accent.
Sherlock hastily took it out of the packaging, making certain that it matched the description, and then stashed it in the drawer of his bedside table, together with the lube he had ordered along with it. Then he went back to his mice.
“Yes.”
John would undoubtedly find some new abhorrent girlfriend again in no time, and that would hurt even more.
“Oh, it’s way too weird for me. Go to the police; they’re really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction.” He tossed her handbag towards her, which was strangely heavy, he noticed, then turned towards the kitchen. “Night-night.”
She had then poured a considerable amount of money into pulling off a trick her brother would definitely have approved of. (And wasn’t half of what she did in her life meant to impress him, even though he was no longer there? It seemed to be a life purpose, ingrained into her DNA, exhausting as it was.)
She had only wanted to separate Sherlock and John in a way that was cunning and that her brother would have approved of.
But despite all the awkwardness, John only had to look at Sherlock to see that Greg was right. He was radiant and John probably looked similar himself – although seeing him like that was probably less of a shock to outsiders.
with you. I
If only he hadn’t died.
“Indeed.”
“A Star Wars fan?” John asked with a faint smile, in an apparent attempt to break the silence.
“Great idea.”
“I see,” John said, not entirely successfully repressing a proud grin. “So you’re convinced that their deal included the condition ‘before he dies’?”
John, never closing his eyes for more than a few seconds during sex, always making sure it was really him. As long as he could see, hear and smell John – his wonderful, steadfast, loyal John – everything was alright.
Amazingly, Sherlock is letting him caress him, nuzzle him, touch him more intimately than John was doing mere moments earlier, with his cock in his mouth, as weird as it is.
Oddly, it was kind of comforting knowing that
“Look, er... Sherlock. I think I’ll just go home, after all,” John started.
If only John had ever come this close, had ever leaned over him with such a hungry, excited look. Sherlock would certainly not have felt the fear and repulsion he felt now.
all this time? Oh god, you were so close and I didn’t know.”
Then he noticed Sherlock was holding his breath.
Whenever either of them attempted to speak, a sound came out like a mouse being trampled on. So they stuck to whispering, so as to try and spare their voices and avoid comical sounds.
John rushed over to Sherlock’s side, quickly checking his vital signs. Fast but regular heartbeat, thank
Smith twirled a finger to indicate their surroundings. “I built this whole wing. Kept firing the architect and builders so no one knew quite how it all fitted together. I can slip in and out anywhere I like, you know... when I get the urge.”
This was one of the few BSL signs Sherlock actively remembered coming across during his research into BSL teachers and their introductory YouTube videos, and which he could therefore already understand.
British. Sherlock seemed to remember having heard it once before.
John starts vehemently at the sound of Sherlock’s voice right next to him. “Oh. Hi.”
The following days passed with an ever-increasing amount of notes and diagrams accumulating on the surfaces and walls of the flat, and with Sherlock and John each immersed in their own lines of inquiry. Beside their regular grunts and sighs of frustration, they mostly worked in silence, except for the occasional “tea?” and “I’m going out” or “we should get some sleep”. That last one was mostly John.
Thank God.
Disappointment started to make way for slight panic.
Also, he put in a lot of effort to acquire the perfect present, which was no mean feat. He knew exactly what he wanted to give Sherlock, but the timing in selecting the right specimen was crucial. It involved a lot of internet searches and phone calls until he found what he was looking for.
It was important that he kept talking to her, letting her know he was still listening.
They briefly exchanged friendly smiles, but didn’t talk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sadness fell over him like a winter blanket when he remembered. They were supposed to have cut off contact. And also they kind of actually had.
John slowly took in a long breath, letting the sudden jumble of thoughts in his head condense into words he could actually say aloud.
“Yes.”
“He’s not laughing, Sherlock,” John said.
“Will you please not do that anymore, Sherlock? You almost did get yourself killed.” John clenched his jaw, visibly struggling with what to say next. “You know how well I handled the last time I thought you were dead. I married an evil assassin. So please stay safe, yeah?”
John looked away, wishing Sherlock would just leave.
At how his own had utterly overwhelmed him.
Sherlock frowned, looking utterly bewildered. “John, you didn’t honestly think—”
John detected a rare lump in Sherlock’s throat. He nodded as he gently caressed the side of Sherlock’s neck, a warm feeling of pride blossoming in his chest.
The insight into the way he and Mycroft had both been pushed in uncomfortable directions by their parents’ lack of basic psychological insight. The way those role patterns had kept affecting the both of them. And how none of that was really anybody’s fault. It just was the way it was.
“... would you just say the word ‘Norbury’ to me? Would you?”
There was clearly no point in denying. “Yes, well, I’ve been meaning to tell you, actually…” He couldn’t suppress a nervous twitch of his mouth as he spoke.
area,” he said, ducking his chin as he raised his eyebrows sarcastically.
“Thanks,” John replied, when Sherlock remained silent. He was already observing the building and the window of Arthur’s dormitory, with the stout ivy plant covering the wall underneath – which could have facilitated his unnoticed exit. There was crime scene tape around an area below it, as there was also below another window further to the right, on the other side of the main entrance, in what was clearly the teachers’ wing – seeing as the windows there were bigger and farther apart.
His brain was being very unhelpful of late. He needed to

Sherlock’s heart broke a little. “Yes. Yeah; no, I’m-I’m still here. I’m here.”
“Or actually, even

“Alright,” Mycroft sighed. “I was studying up in my room. Daddy was at work and Mummy was in the kitchen. Nanny Forsyth walked into the garden to hang up the washing just after Sherrinford had started attacking Redbeard, so I can only tell you what she saw that instant, as you well know.”

John thought back to the confusing feelings he had been overcome with the previous afternoon upon seeing Sherlock dress up in women’s clothes. Sherlock was right, of course. He
John smiled back, reassured, relieved, until both their smiles merged into a kiss again, slow and tender this time, almost like their first.
* * * * *
Although John had enjoyed their travelling through little villages and being outside all day for almost two weeks, locking themselves inside a luxury suite for a while was definitely also most agreeable.
“Yeah, that was indeed, incredibly moronic of him,” John acknowledged. He nodded and remained silent for a bit.
“Hmm,” was all John said.
“Ah,” was all she said.
Smith, the shrewd snake, raised his hand. All innocence, he asked, “How do you catch a serial killer?”
lunatic.”
-- Everything alright? J
They languidly nuzzled each other’s necks, hands sliding under T-shirts, and mouths finding yet new spots to plant kisses.
John frequently found himself trying to come up with ways to
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock sighed, contentedly. “Just give me a minute and I will make it up to you.”
And of course it took a bloody genius like Sherlock to learn how to give the most amazing frigging blowjobs John had ever had, within
“Sherlock…” John smiled and shook his head, briefly looking up at the ceiling. “What on
He hung up, throwing some money at the befuddled cabbie – who had just pulled up in front of number 46 – and bolted out of the car.
On another note, I keep deciding to split chapters in two, increasing the total number of chapters even though I’m not actually adding new plotlines. Some scenes just turn out to be a little more wordy once I’ve written them down. Sorry for the confusion.
“Same here,” Sherlock breathed, eyes wide. Then he grabbed John’s bottom and pulled him even deeper inside, his fingers digging almost painfully into John’s flesh.
for missing John.
“Well, yes. I hope so, in a way.”
Sherlock dug one hand into John’s hair – with his other arm still wrapped tightly around John’s middle –  while John clutched Sherlock’s jacket as if afraid he might otherwise disappear into thin air. With their mouths frantically exploring each other, Sherlock managed to push the door shut with one elbow and then let himself fall back against it, which John, correctly, took as an invitation to crowd close and push him against the wooden surface. The increased sensation of bodily contact this created, caused Sherlock to soon feel his erection strain against the inside of his trousers, and he couldn’t help grinding it against John for some relief. He could then feel John’s prick in a similar state, pressing back rock-hard against his groin.
He quickly put a pillow under his bottom, infinitely grateful for the internet and its inexhaustible source of information.
Why was this conversation so awkward? It had never been this cumbersome between them before.
“Huh,” John huffed. “Probably just boys playing some prank on each other then, trying to break into one another’s dorm.”
It wasn’t that it was actually chilly (it was the warmest month of the year, after all), but he was vaguely aware of the absence of a pleasant warmth that had been there before.
John was apparently having similar thoughts, as he suddenly said, “So what was it that prevented us from telling each other how we felt?”
John felt a strange combination of relief at apparently having been instantly accepted as her son’s partner and awkwardness at her mentioning marriage in this early stage.
“It never seemed to occur to him that an eight-year-old would obviously not have the same mental capacities as someone studying for their A-levels. It was infuriating. And exhausting.”
involving him was even riskier, as he was sure to sense something was off, seeing as he knew them all so well.
“Awesome!” Sherlock’s face lit up and he walked towards her. “D’you do block bookings?”
“Let’s have a chat with one of these gentlemen first,” Sherlock said, as they walked up the driveway. One man carrying a chainsaw (who was rather stunningly handsome, Sherlock couldn’t help noticing) was just passing them from behind on his way to the stables, nodding to them in greeting. “Good morning, sir,” Sherlock said jovially. “On days like these, it’s not so bad having an outdoor job, is it?”
Upon entering 221B, it was a few moments before Sherlock realised that there was something different about his flat.
She missed them. So much.
By the time they arrived home, they were practically drowning in smiles and kisses and unable to stop groping at each other.
From across the table, Greg threw John a look.
I then spent several weeks trying to think of a scenario in which it made sense for Sherlock and Mycroft to have referred to ‘The East Wind’ from early youth (as was stated in His Last Vow), without them having had a secret superpower sister.
“The poor bloke.” Sherlock smiled back.
Although… there was one downside.
Then a man’s voice. “No, I’m failing to.”
He’d been planning to postpone killing Sherlock Holmes until after he’d had a nice number of sessions with him, but he was definitely going to rethink that now. He would first go and destroy the devices. And then, he might come back for the final round later this very afternoon.
Vivian had just gotten to the part where she was recounting the number of deaths The Peppers had caused at the Embassy that day – namely every living soul in the building, including all of the Embassy’s kitchen staff – when they’d suddenly heard the faint cocking of a gun from the direction of the tanks with the floating invertebrates behind them. The next thing Sherlock knew, he heard another gun cock and fire, and all of a sudden there was Mary, lying trembling on the floor, a faint trickle of blood seeping through her blouse.
in me, in a... well... er... context of... er... you know...”
The current officer definitely looked more able than her predecessor.
They’d agreed to only take straightforward cases with next to no danger and minimal legwork, for the time being, and requiring as little interaction with strangers as possible, for John. (They were slowly practicing exposure to strangers at the shops, not yet at crime scenes.)
It wasn’t until she saw John sitting at the visitation table that she realised it was him. The glasses and moustache didn’t fool her for a second.
Sherlock blinked. “No.”
“Hello, Alice? It’s William Sherlock Scott Holmes again,” he said to her, forcing his tired brain to sound calm and friendly. “Sorry, my battery died. I just wanted to let you know that I’ve arranged for police officers to be waiting for you at the airport where you’ll land, to take you back to your mummy, alright? Everything is going to be fine.”
Sherlock tried gently shaking his shoulder. What on earth was he dreaming, if
How straightforward her life’s worries still were, John mused, with her main concern simply being whether she received enough food and hugs.
“Aww, man, you’re just no use, are you?” Greg says in mock disappointment. (Or is it?).
In the following minutes, Sherlock’s face was becoming more and more flushed, he repeatedly licked his lips and incredibly kept tilting his hips as if trying to reach even deeper.
-- How are you? S
She cautiously put her hand on the door handle, pulling it towards herself slightly before pushing it down, which she knew avoided it making a clicking sound.
She absolutely adored the pink unicorn lamp she’d gotten, and the rainbow-coloured little piano kept her occupied and made her stop fussing for almost a full hour.
“What, for your blog?”
. He knows
It was quite clear that neither Sherlock nor John was ever going to get any useful information out of the bastard, while at the same time the man was a walking time bomb full of explosive material, which he was evidently only ever going to use to make the world a worse place. So, after adding up all those things, Sherlock had decided to quite literally give his life for John, by taking Magnussen’s life and thereby ensuring that Mary’s enemies wouldn’t ever be able to harm John.
She swallowed as she watched Sherlock bury his face in John’s neck, kissing him there, probably. He’d done that to her too, and it had felt good, even though it had all been an act on his part (which, in a way, she’d always sensed). But it was definitely no act with John.
Sherlock wasn’t sure how to respond. He’d been quite clear, he thought. Perhaps John just needed time to let things sink in.
Quick as lightning, Sherlock tried to think of plausible ways to talk himself out of this. But he was severely distracted by the fact that her personality seemed completely opposite to what he’d seen of her before. She was at ease and smiling.
John was expecting him to… to…
‘I need to kill someone,’ it said on the paper.
He pictured John’s naked torso as he’d seen it during their summers as flatmates, on the occasions when John hadn’t bothered to put on a bathrobe coming out of the shower. Sherlock then pictured them both naked, embracing, John running his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and down his body, lower and lower. He arched his back on the sofa and pressed a hand over his groin. But as soon as he imagined himself bending over a table with John behind him, all of a sudden he was fourteen again and back in the geography store room at St. James’s, tears of pain rolling down his cheeks.
She clearly wasn’t trying to pass as a man right now, though. Everything about her posture, up to the way she chewed her chewing gum, was aggressively feminine.
.” John swallowed. He rested his forehead against Rosie’s. “Your daddy has been a giant idiot. Once
Apropos of nothing, he didn’t think there was much of a chance of them ever ‘doing’ anything in particular in this bed, except sleep. And talk, or kiss, of course. John likely wouldn’t want any ‘gay stuff’, seeing as he’d always so loudly proclaimed being ‘not gay’. But that was okay. Of course, it was totally fine.
“You’ve been ages waking up,” Smith said, quietly. “I watched you. It’s quite lovely in its way.”
