There's a significant pause before his mobile buzzes again:
"The attraction," John echoes. Brian is giving John a flat, too-knowing smirk:
Sherlock nods, and John pulls back. Settling down onto his folded feet, as Sherlock rubs at the back of his skull: on his way down John licks Sherlock's nipple, peaked through cotton, just for good measure.
John nods. After a moment. "Minibreak at the shore, is it?" he asks, light.
"I think about it," Sherlock says, finally. "All the time."
twice a day to maintain the ability to carry on an intelligent conversation." Sherlock turns and walks up the sofa, leaning until it tips back up onto its feet.
John swallows. "Yeah," he croaks, and hard hot stinging Sherlock's right hand comes down just at the tops of John's spread red-hot smarting thighs.
he couldn't, I knew that just from the start and I still want him to, to do—to—to be with me in every—and I—"; and then he inhales again and asks, "How can I expect him to—to just—
. "Please," he is saying with his—
"Can't it wait?" Sherlock asks, very low.
John whines.
. An electric shock, the suddenness of that memory: a flood of lying on his back thinking about blowing the bartender at East Bloc and the PRISM disclosures and their electric bill, all the while with her body young and naked above him in their bed. His face floods hot. His throat a well-worn, familiar knot of shame. What had he been
"I want to go upstairs with you," Sherlock says, voice thick.
On the doorjamb, John's fingers twitch.
Sherlock makes a disgruntled sort of noise but his arms loosen. "Sit," John says, "Come on," and Sherlock puts his hand on the back of the chair.
"Did you?" Sherlock asks, frank and curious, a little breathless; and, swallowing, John nods, then bends back down to lick at him, the sensitive little puffed-up bud of Sherlock's nipple, swelling and hardening in John's mouth. "How devious of you," Sherlock says, low and rumbly, then makes a little hot noise, pressing up: he fits his hand close to the back of John's head. His fingers slip into John's hair. "You asked me over to revise, then." His voice curling up: "Chemistry, I think."
"If it wasn't a case, then," John says. "Your jaw, I mean."
actually
John pets his back. His hip.
"Yeah." John rubs at the nape of his neck. Breathes in, for the weight of Sherlock's body on his ribs; and Sherlock lifts up his head.
John turns his cup in his hands. "I haven't the first idea how to actually do it, you know," he says, after a second; and then sighs, and takes a drink; and Sherlock ducks his head.
what I'm worried about," John says. Unsteady. "That I've—I've tried exactly once to, to make a proper go of it and keep my cock in my pants and I tried it for—for seven and a half entire months and two great handfuls of idiotic reasons and for half of that I was—I was lying to myself and my fiancée and getting off with near-strangers in cabs, so I—I do worry that I'm a bit of a bastard and you've—I think already you've had more than enough of people being bastards to you so I. I worry about
"Yes," Sherlock says, thick, "can you—fuck me with your—"; and John nods. Moving, slow: Sherlock breathing in with him and out John's tongue slipping against him teeth and tongue as John presses his fingers inside him, glacially slow. Sherlock's hand tightens on his shoulder, squeezing hard: bloody strong violinist fingers. "You—is this all right?" John asks; and Sherlock says, "No." Voice wobbling and thick. "You—your—vibrator, your cock, you—" and John swallows. "Not a vibrator," he admits; and Sherlock laughs, high and choked, then says, "So just—fuck, fuck me, you can, just put it in me, just—" and then swallows, noisy and wet, with his whole body shaking all over and John's heart. "I can," John whispers. "I will, but—but can that wait, a bit?"; and Sherlock makes a stretched thin sound as he nods and nods, pressing his mouth up to John's, kissing him hard. His body, hard-stretched tight allover. "This all right?" John asks, quiet: Christ, he's so tight, but Sherlock whines jerking his head, up and down. John's throat hurts. "This," John says, very quietly, "I like this"; and inhaling on a gasp Sherlock reaches to cup John's soft penis between them. John breathes: letting him. That—shivery off-center fearful feeling: John settles himself into Sherlock's long hand. He won't hurt him. John pets, Sherlock shivers; then—space. Only just. Rubbing their emberish faces together: John breathes, Sherlock breathes; breathing out. Steadying, Sherlock's gentle petting stroking-soft long fingers on the tenderest parts of John's body as John is petting two fingers into his.
Drinks his tea.
"I want you to," John admits. Swallowing. Sherlock is nodding, pressing soft half-kisses against John's leg as his fingers press deep into John's arsehole: his four long fingers, tucked inside. "I want it." John swallows: Sherlock's soft serious eyes. "I want you to," John confesses, "I want all of you inside me, your hand, your cock," laughing—and all of him— "I want you to come so hard I'll have to worry about getting fucking
"Your bill," the waitress says, and they both jump. Sitting straighter. Pulled back. John pushes Sherlock's empty glass away.
"That was different," he says. "That was war."
"I need to talk to Mycroft," he says, and then, shifting, he adds, "family matter, and it's urgent."
"And you're allergic to them." John's voice comes out low. Encouraging, he'd meant; but forgot. The ends of Sherlock's hair are curling up around his fingertips, lush.
"It's just an exercise," Sherlock says, and then busies himself with his tea.
Sherlock lifts his head enough to kiss him. Soft. Minty.
"Yeah?" John asks, quiet.
"Mm—" John's mouth is— "or—" wet, and—he tugs at the hem of Sherlock's t-shirt and Sherlock lifts up just enough to let him pull it off. Hand on John's side, light— "Or you could show me," John says, tongue thick, too fast, "you—I thought you were going to show me, I thought—" with his fingertips skating up over Sherlock's blood-hot belly and ribs and suddenly, suddenly he wants, "I want to see, I want to
"Anything?" Sherlock asks, open-mouthed: into him.
"I like." Sherlock swallows. "This, I like—touching you like this."
"I want you to come over here and ride my prick in the bath," Sherlock tells him, and then grunts as John digs into the top of his palm.
"Here?" John murmurs; "Five," Sherlock says, rough, "or‚ or four, it'd be—but right now—"; "It's probably a seven on me," John murmurs, and Sherlock moans, "
John nods. Kisses him, again—and Sherlock pulls back, rubbing at his face.

of a woman, and unquestionably a pioneer, and that she would be, as a result, as famous as Joan Clarke and Dorothy Hopper, in certain circles—that is to say, quite famous indeed. That she is also, as written, kind of a personality just seems to me to be standard operating procedure, for Sherlock's family.

"Getting." Sherlock swallows. "Close."
"So, thirteen? fourteen?" John asks, and Sherlock starts laughing again. "I mean, I'd put it higher, but—"
Sherlock is quiet while John rubs his damp towel over Sherlock's wet hair. His face. The eyeliner, John will admit, is starting to look less deliberately smudged more just like it was applied by a hamfisted pillock and is now melting, but Sherlock's eyes are still huge and deoxygenating, dizzyingly green. John licks over his own bottom lip, rocking back on his heels. "My room?" he asks; and Sherlock swallows (up-down, up-down) and heads out onto the landing, bare-skinned. Not for the first time John is grateful that ever since that incident with Vivienne Harvey back in 2011 Mrs. Hudson never heads above the first storey landing without warning. John tosses his towel across the worst of the puddled water, then grabs the carrier bag out of the cupboard and follows.
. "I think I—I spent most of that time making you miserable shagging anyone handy when I could've—"
a harness, John hadn't been— "just giving you the opportunity to get yourself ready," Sherlock says, stepping into it, "in case you need it, to prove me wrong."
"No," John admits. "I don't." He touches it again. It still feels hot. "Maybe," he says, doubtfully, and then drops that hand down too. "You could always do it again," he suggests, "if it doesn't stay."
Sherlock's mouth twists, soft and rueful. He reaches over and touches John's wrist on the carpet between them; John turns his palm up, and interlaces their hands.
—the photo. That photo, then, still open, where Sherlock has left it, right there, broad and brilliant, splashed out wide across John's laptop screen.
"Pinches?" John asks, and Sherlock nods. John eases it open and Sherlock whines, squirming back, and John gives him a good hard tug and gets the clamp closed again, faster, and Sherlock moans. "Better?" John asks, quiet, and Sherlock nods and nods. Rubs his hand up John's forearm, reaches back for his skull—John kisses his ear, petting at the other nipple, already hard as a rock. "These are nice," John says, as close to conversationally as he can manage. He clamps it tight, and Sherlock bites down on a groan. "Sturdy," John says. "A good investment, I'd imagine."
He pets. Pets. Pets. Against him Sherlock is breathing: in one two three four five, out one two three four five, in and in and in, out and out and out. John strokes his fingers along Sherlock's scalp from nape to crown and back again, over and over and over, in time with Sherlock's warm breath.

"That hurt you," John manages, finally. "Those choices. And
Sherlock doesn't look back. Barely looking at anything, John thinks, through the warming haze of his skin. All his long fingers: sliding against John's at their sides. "You're quiet tonight."
"You won't even take a day off when you're dead on your feet," Sherlock says.
John gets his arms around him, what the hell; then grabs his arse, squeezes while Sherlock grinds up against him, hot and hard. The door creaks in its jamb, low and hollow.

"Yeah, sure." John's hand stops, briefly; his thumb curled up around the soft black fuzz at the top of Sherlock's nape. "I thought," he says. "If we'd been at school together—and this wasn't terribly realistic, you must understand—" he can feel Sherlock smiling— "but I thought, if I'd been ever been caned back at school and Sherlock'd been around, I'd've gone to him, after," he explains.
John's mouth is dry so he swallows.
angry? John does wonder, in a sense, what sort of Sherlock'd been with Raj Chabra and Gabrielle Adeline and he does wonder why Sherlock'd wanted to get to John in 2013 but mostly John finds he is wondering why
"Should I get dressed?" Sherlock asks. Muffled, against John's throat.
"Oh, 'orders'." In the corner of John's vision Sherlock's hand makes a graceless, pidgeonish sort of a swoop. "Mycroft makes his decisions based on the ten thousand foot view. If his 'orders' were worth anything he wouldn't need someone on the ground with a brain, so that they could decide to do something different."
"Catching up on my emails?" John asks, and hands him his tea.
"Do I have to?" he asks; and John smiles so hard his cheeks hurt, eyes blurring, crinkling up, and says, "No."
, he texts back.
"Yeah," he says, after a moment, "I think I—see your point"; and Sherlock pushes up to his feet, to take his cup back into the kitchen.
"Not." Thick. "Quite."
"I know," John says, helplessly.
, is it always—bloody buggering
"Just kiss?" Sherlock says, rough; and then looks up at him, with those vast, unanswerable all-colors eyes.
John watches, helpless. If he'd—if he were—stretched in dimensions he can't see—if he were big enough to—if there were ways that he could—wrap if he could make for him a shelter—
"Can I," Sherlock asks, thick and close, "can I fuck you a little bit more?"
"What time's the car coming?" he asks.
Sherlock doesn't say anything for a long, taut moment. Then he rests the cane against John's back, where he hasn't ever hit him—where he would never hit him, John (inescapably medical, over forty) knows; and then Sherlock says, very carefully, "Yellow"; and John opens his eyes. "I'm going to need you to count them off for me, John," Sherlock says, and raises the cane.
"Are we talking, then," Sherlock says, finally, "about 2013?"; and John's breath exits his body. A puff, unsurprised but still half-startled, loosening him.
Breathing. John breathes. John presses his forehead to Sherlock's forehead. His nose. His cheek. John swallows. "How you feel about me," he says, quiet. "How I feel about you."
, Sherlock replies; and John kicks off the duvet, wriggling his pajama bottoms down.
John shifts, and Sherlock wraps his hand back around him loosely, watching his face.
Even just with his hand on Sherlock's hand John can feel him tensing, a subtle tremor that ripples from shoulder to palm. Best to ignore it, John thinks. It's not the sort of thing Sherlock'd thank him for noticing. Instead John leaves his right hand still and uses the left to grab his water glass: "I mean," he says, "if you don't mind saying," as casually as he can; then takes a sip.
"No," John agrees, and grabs his mobile on his way back up to his bedroom, leaving Sherlock in control of the field.
, and then Sherlock had helped him back to sitting on the sofa and brought him a towel damp with ice and a digestive and two paracetamol and then hovered over him, crane-like and absurd, until John had dragged him down to sitting and put on
"I know," Sherlock says; and then takes an unsteady breath, arms tightening around him. "John—," he says, stretched thin; and so John bends down to kiss him, to take his hot face in his hands.
, but John is still standing there like an idiot; it makes Sherlock's mouth twist down, brows shifting: as it turns out, it's a rather good impression of all those worn-out academics, as best as John can remember, looking disappointed that John isn't entirely living up to his potential.
"It's so
, but still just barging ahead based on." He swallows, thick. "Whatever. Wrongheaded or half-complete notion we've got into our heads." He stops. "No way to tell," he says, "whether or not we've—or
"Badly-parked fish delivery van," Sherlock corrects, and John jerks his head up.
as thick inside him Sherlock gasps, "Oh—God—
Sherlock's hands. His shoulders. His throat.
John sighs. "No," he says. He'd thought—well, he'd thought it was silly, really. It'd got hot, though—or really, the idea of it, on the phone, later on. He lifts his head, looks up at Sherlock; stretches the truth, fudges its edges a bit. He says, "I think it's fun."
"John."
, Christ, at last.
"Kiss me," Sherlock whispers, and everything in John's life thins and narrows to the press of his mouth to Sherlock's mouth, the dark metal-animal taste of him, the just-veiled throb of his blood through his skin on John's skin above John's blood: the first girl John's ever kissed, the first girl he's ever wanted to kiss, the awkward stuck-up half-silent swot who—who hunches over his notes and won't meet John's eyes in the hall and John knows to his bones that he saw Sherlock looking sullen on the first sodding day of year 9 and thought: that girl, that one, forever, for me.
"You ever do it like this?" John asks. It feels sunk deep down into him. Spun down wound up with his lungs and his liver and his bones. "Like you're. Starts out, you're not even really having a wank." He swallows. "Just. Passing the time."
He stops. Rubs at his cheek.
Another: slow.
"Just let me get," Sherlock panting, "the whole bottle up you, and then—"
"My preferred strategy," Sherlock explains, "was to have," in between, "an ill-timed bout of the 'flu."

John makes noise. Pleading. Helpless. With Sherlock sat up behind him, petting him like—he rubs at his face. Tries to get his hands under him, shoulders up—
Sherlock nods. "You'd let me play with your hair," he says, looking too-close up at John: his long hand sliding soft along the edge of John's cheek; John twists to kiss his wrist's soft white inside. "You'd strip down for me in the sunlight," Sherlock says, weightless, all breath, "and then lie down, naked, with me": and nodding and nodding, John says, "I always want to be," swallowing, "naked, with you": and Sherlock pets his thumb over John's bottom lip and whispers, "I want you to"; and John breathes. Settling—down: closer into the nospace between them; "Touch me," Sherlock whispers, and John pets his hand loose around Sherlock's hard cock; and rubbing at John's cheek kissing him Sherlock whispers, "Talk to me, I need—"; and "I've been dreaming of this," John says: it feels pulled out of him. "All term," Sherlock says, and John laughs: "For years," he says, soft-unsteady, "since I met you," and beneath him Sherlock takes a deep, swelling-open breath. "Fucking me," Sherlock says, "with—with your purple—"; he stops, and kissing—kissing him: "Touching you all over," John says, "being—inside you inside me, I—I wanted you to—to show me everything about you," swallowing, "about
married with a child, probably up to and including out and out lying about it; and also that she lived apart from her family throughout the war. I should mention that, from a character conception perspective, it certainly would not have been a tremendous emotional hardship for her to do so. Anyway, taking those details as read: it's fair to assume that Anne Townshend would've been one one
"Fuck—" drawn in, breathless, "okay, stop, stop," dropping down to his side while Sherlock wipes his fingers on the sheets and fits both his arms around John's jerking ribs, nuzzling into John's hair while red-faced and warm all over cradled tight John laughs, and laughs, and laughs.
"Oh, please," John says, exasperated. "It isn't as though I won't get right back into bed with you later—come on, shower." He holds down a hand. "I'll scrub your back."
"John," Sherlock says, desolate; and John takes a slow, shaking breath.
Close as they are Sherlock is watching him. His blurred face.
His gun's in his chest of drawers, along with his holster. He slides the holster on and grabs the gun; checks it, quickly; and is just about to tuck it in when he hears the door click shut, down two flights of stairs.
"Yeah," John nods. "We—um. We haven't—Rhoda will want to know when—"
"Soft," John says. Quiet. Swallows: Sherlock nuzzling up against-underneath him and "I want you to be gentle," John says, "with me."
Sherlock's face crinkles up at the edges. "I could eat."
Sherlock says, "Hmmmmmmmm," and John inhales.
"So after your tour," John says, quiet, and waits for Sherlock's blush to contract to two high spots of color that'll take half an hour, nearly, to fade all the way. "You had a bit of a think," John prompts, in lieu of waiting until they do.
"Hm." Sherlock takes another bite of toast. Crumbs everywhere. John wants to lie down with him and wrap them 'round and around and around with a blanket so that they are pressed together and immobile, cocooned together like the incongruous ingredients in a particularly unlikely sort of burrito: an absurd mental image that bursts into John fully formed, red-purple and hot and yearning for a long shivering instant before it is inevitably joined by a conjuring of Sherlock's probable accompanying expression: scrunched-together scowling eyebrows, turtled mouth, nineteen chins. Coat, too, probably, collar turned up to frame that accusatory face. But beside him at the table Sherlock is saying, "But you deleted them... later," sounding tired and off-balance and uncertain; and John is recalled to the reality of him: his hunched-up shoulders and stale body-smells: he couldn't summon that face just now if he wanted to, John doesn't think; and John suspects he wouldn't much want to, either.
Also,
John picks up his mobile. Unlocks the screen.

Sherlock takes a breath. Another. "I just—I've let it get too far, I can't go that far, I can't—" He takes another breath, lets it out: careful, slow; and then he says, "I can't like it that much." His voice is rough. Unsteady. He says, "As much as I like it, when—"; and then turns back to prod his spoon through the lentils, as though he has given up on the end of the sentence.

," and then yanks his hands between them to untangle his shirtcuffs. John swallows, pulls the tails of his shirt out of his trousers, helps Sherlock shrug it off—and then meets Sherlock bending down forehead-to-forehead panting, John pressing his aching empty hands flat to Sherlock's heaving bare ribs. Presses Sherlock's arse back to the lower cupboards, thumbs across his trouser button badly done up: John swallows back fluttering-throbbing panic and gets down onto his knees.

"Not so much in Amsterdam," Sherlock says. "A few times. Errands. Passing through." He lifts his hand from John's back to rub his face, and cool air rushes in. "The tourists are useful, if you don't want to be noticed."

to turn up at the British Museum and I weren't there, it'd be just about the best of all possible worlds."
Twice.
John flattens his palm. Trapped up under his vest on Sherlock's body. "In some ways, I suppose," John says, quiet. "I felt a bit odd when I sat in your lap."
, as John inhales— "You've been busy, tonight," Sherlock says, quiet, touching him, "haven't you."
"Yes," Sherlock says, a little rueful. "She would do."
Sherlock doesn't answer. The mask of his face, the eyeliner, John rubs: cheekbone. Jaw. This face that he knows and doesn't know. This body. This heart.
He's so close John can feel it. Against him: Sherlock's bones, vibrations.
Rests.
"Yeah," he says, after a moment. "A." Clearing his throat. "A young man I knew," Sherlock says, "in Oxford."
"I was a
. John's never thought about Mycroft's hair being anything but black, but now—he's never looked at Mycroft the way he looks at Sherlock, has he. It seems obvious, in retrospect. Isobel Holmes, John knows, has hair of a deep, shocking bloodish red: natural, not dyed, John had been knowing helplessly, because it was liberally streaked with grey, gone all the way white at the temples, offsetting her disquieting eyes. John's thumb catches on a curl: "I know," he says. No—not Holmes, Isobel Townshend. She'd corrected him:
Sherlock meets John's eyes. It seems to cost him some effort. John feels strange: untethered, somehow—
"How so, John?"
"Six," Sherlock says, quick; and John stills, then squeezes again; and Sherlock says, "Six."
Cropped. Bitten off in the middle: John licks up over him looking up. Sliding his hand around his thickwet with his foreskin sliding-soft open and Sherlock shivers all the way down from his shoulders. Pulls one knee up. "Fingers," Sherlock says, unsteady, with his foot braced on the coffee table just behind John's left side while John works him slow wet-twisting his left hand fisted under Sherlock's right hand tight around Sherlock's red prick, wrist crossing wrist. "I want—" Throat, bob: "I always want," Sherlock says; and John can feel his face flood with blood, heavy and hot.
John is staring down through the gap of the back of the chair at their carpet—at the carpet, he corrects, in Holmes's office. Where Holmes, John knows, brings all his wayward boys.
He hunches one shoulder up, then the other.
It'd be an idiotic thing to agree to. John swallows, and jerks his head in a nod, and watches the bump of Sherlock's throat bob up and then down, twice.
John swallows. "That's." It's got a little metal studs on one side and a metal ring fitted in near the middle, and it'd seem entirely ridiculous, probably, if Sherlock weren't exhaling as he gets it seated, hips shifting a bit as he buckles it tight, with the little metal ring fitted down at the bottom, under his balls, so that if John were to put his thumb back against him, brush up—
"Later." Sherlock's voice is thick. He says, "Will you—," and then stops.
"Don't play stupid, it doesn't look good on you," John says, a little too fast, and then touches Sherlock's arm.

There passes no scrap of the ensuing twenty-four hours that is anything other than grindingly, miserably awful.

"I'm sorry," John says, finally; and Sherlock slides a little bottle out of the cupboard, and sets it beside the bowl of olives and tomatoes and onions.
"I'll need you to stop," Sherlock says, while they're getting his pajamas down to his knees, fingers tangling; "I know," John says, "I will," but Sherlock's already nodding, bending down to kiss him. Bare to the ankles. John breathes him in—Sherlock needs a wash: it's marvelous—while they ease Sherlock's knees apart, John shuffling up between them. Rubbing at Sherlock's hips. Sherlock's mouth breaks from his: inhaling, as John gets a hand around him, cradling-loose. He's so soft: plummy and delicate, velvety in John's fingers. Against his mouth Sherlock breathes. Breathes. His hands light on John's shoulders: John kisses his stubbled jaw, murmurs, "Yeah?"
"The auburn." Sherlock hasn't opened his eyes. "You're wondering where we got that. My mum's two-thirds of the way to ginger, so."
"Yeah," John says. Typing, as quick as he can:
"Good morning." Murmured—John sighs, mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth. "So," soft-moving, "then—if I could just get back to," says Sherlock, with his warm knee sliding heavy between John's knees made malleable; and John says, "Oh—no—please—by all—means, con—tinue," in between their scratching faces where Sherlock is snorting his awkward heron laugh; but they end up kissing for a bit longer, anyway.
"Just comes in like that, and then
Sherlock swallows. Reaches for John's wrist, and

It takes John most of the walk to the Tube station to work out why Sherlock would be in Guildhall. He's a little bit ashamed it takes him so long, but the look on Sherlock's face—as John turns up just in time to watch him get tossed out of the office of the Head of Composition at the music school—means that Sherlock probably isn't. John just grins back. He might've previously thought that that expression represented cutting scorn, but the fact that Sherlock backs him up against the wall just the next corridor is certainly reinforcing John's decision to revisit that opinion.
"Is it." Sherlock licks his bottom lip, his expression mostly too close to read. "
John drops his book to the carpet, rolls creakily up onto his side. "And do what?"
John breathes. In, out, in.

; and neither of them, not even for a moment, had treated it anything like a joke. It hadn't been a joke. It had been, instead, a promise; the solemnest promise, John thinks, that their shared vocabulary had permitted, in that moment, in November of 2014. Had it—had that changed?
"Of course," John says. "I've already been going since before you got in, so." Sherlock's gaze has slid down his face, settled somewhere around the base of his ribs. "Not half fair."
Christ. John curls his right hand on the duvet by Sherlock's cheek. Bumping against him, while Sherlock writhes, until—only just—barely—
"Watching you..." John swallows. "Press yourself right up against me."
Stopped just inside the door off the landing John catches himself: standing still and—staring—idiotic. The wispy, side-leaning triangle of dark hair at the nape of Sherlock's fair neck—what of it? Not new. John turns away and goes over to shove his sheets into the washing machine. After a moment out of the corner of his eye he sees Sherlock take a half-step back from the windows: his head bowed, nearly, when he bends to gather his music from the floor. Sun through their open windows, his body limned with light. John's back prickles. He is for some reason thinking:

"Did you mean it?" Sherlock asks, and lifts his head.
"Oh," sighs Sherlock, "
"To stop," Sherlock says, very quietly.
John takes a breath, then reaches over to pull the ottoman in, a bit; then reaches up for their cups. Sherlock sits in front of him, pale-faced, hollow-eyed, and John passes him back his tea.
fucking
Sprawled out in the bed Sherlock raises an eyebrow at him. "Only because of how much it hurt," Sherlock says, low and hot; then slides his hand up to slowly—twitch—the sheet—aside—
Her eyes widen. "I," she says, then, "Look, John, I'm very flattered, but—" and John feels all his blood rush up to his face.
Not much that's useful, as it turns out; but as Sherlock walks him through the childhood broken wrist, the schooling abroad (probably Germany, though possibly somewhere in Scandinavia), Sherlock pushes the letters apart, then sorts them back together into little clusters; it loosens some of the knots in John's chest, makes it possible to reach across Sherlock's arm for the fourth note—a bizarre misspelling, John couldn't tell whether or not it was significant on his own—and then settle his hand on the back of Sherlock's shoulder; to rub down the length of his spine when Sherlock turns in towards him and exhales. When Sherlock pulls back some seconds later John pulls his hand back up to the table and keeps it there, forearm bumping Sherlock's forearm, while Sherlock pulls out the pieces of failed musical ambitions—instrumental, not vocal—the clusters of letters collapsing and re-coalescing around new points, like little heaps of snow in wind.
"Any time," George says, and takes another bite of salad.
John licks his bottom lip. Sherlock's thumb. John's thumb. John's fingers. "...Should I ask you to cough?" he asks, finally; and Sherlock snorts, then laughs, full-throated and lovely; and safe, John thinks, to ease out. He wipes his hand on his jeans. Can't be helped.
Sherlock wipes the water off his face with one big hand. Says nothing. They're naked, John is realizing, somehow; somehow it's almost as though he hadn't noticed, as though it is new to him, somehow, that they are standing naked nearly touching all over half in hot water and wreathed entirely in steam; and Sherlock is watching him with his wet hair shoved back and his lashes trembling and his cheeks flushed from the heat. So close that when—loofah in hand—John breathes in, their ribs touch. Sherlock's eyes aren't green, but they look it, nearly.
Over in his chair Sherlock's cheeks are busy awkwardly splotching pink. That's like being a kid again too, John thinks; but he supposes he oughtn't to say that.
Sherlock is so still that John feels like he, in contrast, is wobbling: spinning, nearly.
, he thinks; and then catches himself; looking down at Sherlock's wide wild eyes and his buttoned-up turned-down pink mouth:
Jacob and he'd never've—," and then stops, reddening.
John closes his eyes.
Sherlock tugs his teeth at John's earlobe, then murmurs, "Turn around," and pulls back, and John nearly falls down.
It's not the sort of question John would ordinarily particularly inclined to answer, but he knows better than to think he can get away with deflecting Sherlock. "Have done, a fair bit." He tilts Sherlock's face to the side. "In the past." He starts on the left.
Sherlock opens his eyes, tucking his chin down to look at him. His expression is wide open: a little sharp shiver, sliding down to the base of John's back.
John swallows. Sherlock's very tall. All the way down in his hips his pulse is thundering into John's hands. "Want me to keep going?" John asks, very soft.
Stretching above him—against him—magnet-pulling John's floating arms up up up until their fingers fold together, pulled up above his head. Sherlock says, "You always feel dangerous," quiet. With his taut-expanding weight on John's taut-expanding chest.
: John swallows. Throat sticky. "Is that what you want?" he asks; and Sherlock exhales.
Sherlock says, "Yes, please."
"God," Sherlock sighs. "Keep—you can. Keep going."
"Just what," Sherlock says, finally, "do you think you could manage?"
, John remembers thinking, almost first of anything: it'd been a hot, pressed-flat unhappy pang. Now when Sherlock doesn't eat his cheeks hollow and sag and the muscles in his forearms stand out in lines and watching him John feels uncomfortably aware of the meat of him: blood and muscles and bone; that Sherlock isn't—a magical creature or a mirage, perpetually a schoolboy; but a man: the same age now that John was when John met him. John rubs his thumb and fingers firm into the tight muscles of Sherlock's back and shoulders and neck while Sherlock bends forward over his knobby knees and under John's hands he comes apart into a series of soft—startled—grunts and they are both steamed soft by the bath.
Sherlock swallows, twice, convulsively; then says, "With me, please"; low and hot, prickling; and so John swallows and starts toeing off his trainers.
me?" and Sherlock breathes—and breathes—and John touches his hair—and his cheek—and his
A strange feeling: not knowing what the things mean that he says, entirely; John is hot and cold, his right arm in the water like the whole of him watching Sherlock has remembered for a half an instant to watch something else, and then Sherlock is shuffling to the side and so John is shuffling with him: a half turn, as Sherlock shifts the last half of himself out of the water so that it comes down in a blood-hot rush all over John's back, as before him Sherlock squares his shoulders: "Yes," he says, straightening his spine.
"Didn't think about how good you are on your knees, then," rough and soso
"Hand me the bottle," Sherlock says, nodding up; the lube has rolled nearly to John's shoulder, so John twists—
Too warm, really, with all the windows closed, pressed together like this.
After a minute, he sits up. Tugs his vest down. Boxers up. The shower is still going in the en suite. Sherlock'll be able to smell it, John knows: come out of his shower flushed and pink and clean-shaven smelling of moisturizer and expensive shampoo and he'll come in to the wreck of his sheets and smell John where John was wanking, desperate, barely awake and still already delirious over Sherlock's bare beautiful body because Sherlock won't just sodding
"Can we," John says, and then stops.
Sherlock says, "Mine's thicker."
"Too sore for what?" Teasing. Almost.
George shifts in his chair. Instead of answering, he asks, "What part bothers you?"; which, really.
Sherlock leans close. Kisses John's cheek. His jaw; then rests, breathing against John's skin.
That glow.
When he sits back down and picks up his mobile, his hands are damp, a little. He's already ramped up, a bit: probably oughtn't to restart it. Probably ought to've left it running. But—well. Scientific method and all that: John closes his eyes and breathes: in, out, in, out,
Salt-sour at the back of his throat John swallows again. Again, again.
"Yeah," John sighs, "go on, then," and Sherlock swallows—up-down, up-down—and clicks on the arse. Not surprising. John slides his hand into his pants. The video loads up on one bloke kneeling with another bent over on his elbows and knees, round dark arse in the air while the other slips him a couple fingers, rubs his cock up and down the crack of his arse.
Sherlock's hand pauses mid-meander down the middle of John's back. "What?" he asks.
"To be so
of him, his pale belly and those lean white thighs, and John hadn't—he hadn't been paying attention, really; hadn't got his mouth on him, so he doesn't know if it'd been skin mostly or if there'd been anything else, much, thick and shining, to really properly
"Until I can fit my other cock into you, too," Sherlock says, very gently; and John laughs wetly, drops his arm.
," low: pulled thin and wavering, when John rubs the stubbled edge of his mouth down Sherlock's throat. On the back of his neck, Sherlock's long hand, pressed tight: at the junction of Sherlock's neck and shoulder, John closes his eyes. Breathes in deep with his hands trapped between them the somehow-familiar smell of Sherlock's body, dark-round and spicy near the end of the day; and then thumbs open another button on Sherlock's shirt. Palm sliding down to Sherlock's navel: another, another; and his whole front opened up. John turns his face, so that Sherlock's throat bobs against his mouth: swallowing, up-down, up-down.
his body and John cries out as above him Sherlock gasps, "Fuck, I—hold on," unsteady, "to the headboard," shoving his fingers back into him while John tries—no purchase—with Sherlock rubbing his stubble all over his shoulders while he screws his long fingers into John's arse and pants against John's back for his breath.
Sherlock huffs, but his expression relaxes, too: softening the edges of his mouth.
: shaking hands. Drops his mobile on his desk. Glances at the crack of his door, inhaling deep: scrubs his palm down his flies.
, and then
"John," Sherlock whispers, pressing—back: that long taut anxious line of his body; and anything's better than letting Sherlock force himself along, afraid of him, isn't it? Aching John folds his hand open, petting over the little round swell of Sherlock's lovely arse, nuzzling his face against the damp hot puff of Sherlock's fast breath thinking,
Sherlock hums. Electric tongue to tongue—and then Sherlock's soft rough-edged mouth on his jaw.
"Complete tosser," John says.
"Yes," she says. Leans back. "I like kids, and I like helping people, and I like helping kids. So I like my job."
It isn't surprising, John finds, not—truly; but it still drops a faint prickling trail up the back of his neck: like a spray of cold water. Tiny icicles. He keeps it off his face best he can: enough, he is thinking. Enough.
Awake.
: "OhJohn," gasps Sherlock, shivering as John—groaning—just. Shivering.
as John pants, "Let me, just let me, let me get you wet and then—" helpless grinding back down onto him shivering all over, sweat springing up as Sherlock underneath him arching touches John's soft limp exhausted prick and then tender presses his mouth over and over to John's mouth.
, John is asking, "Tell me"; and, "Seven," Sherlock whispers which hurts; and "Try," John gasps, "again": and then desperate kisses Sherlock from the heart of him here held-holding Sherlock baresofthot against him in his arms and "N-nine," Sherlock is breathing, almost, here, at last, "and a half."
They sit. Silent. Sherlock is breathing, John notes, rather fast.
Sherlock turns to face him. Their mouths brush. Part.
John rubs his palms on his dressing gown. "Yeah," he says. It sounds scratchy and rough. He feels scratchy and rough:
John swallows. And swallows. And swallows, and swallows.
"It's not uncomfortable for you, then," John says slowly, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, "when I make reference to the deep, oceanic shade of blue no doubt by this point attained—
Marianne is silent for some time. Finally she says, "You want to talk to me about my job?"
Sherlock curls his fingers: John gasps. "So come," Sherlock says, quiet, and pets his palm over John's taut abdomen until half-sobbing John traps it with his hands. He's panting like he's run a marathon in high August heat; Sherlock's fingers have stilled inside him: John's face feels like it is burning up. "John," Sherlock says.
, Sherlock'd said. It'd made John's chest hurt.
She nods. "Not the only thing you can do, though, either."
, finally: John getting his wet hand back around Sherlock's hot prick, pulling him—up against—while Sherlock holds him open, panting, pressing against John's hole slick and hot and thick as John breathes
"Lucy Matley's office is in Bloomsbury," John says; and Mycroft pauses, and then says, "Yes." John nods, then asks, "So—not far from the British Museum?"
Sherlock shrugs. "I had a sandwich, earlier." His eyes are sharp. "Just wondering if you needed anything," he says, "before I take what I'm owed."
He turns, just enough. Looks up at him: pink cheeks pale eyes long hands. John asks, "What if I put it on you?"
Sherlock swallows: up-down, up-down. "The fourteenth," he says.
"I—a bit." John's body is beginning to feel too small, drawn too tight around all his swelling organs, as Sherlock caresses the tender rim of him with warm wet hands.
Sherlock's eyes. Wide.
because it's got
Smiling. Sherlock's wet mouth. Soft nudging nose. "God," Sherlock breathes, "you'd better"; and John nods. Arms hard hands braced: holding himself still knelt up feeling everything face turned down to—
"Something like—one for utterly uninteresting, two for nice but not terribly electrifying, three for interesting enough that I ought to do it again—"
"Arse," John says immediately, "and doesn't count, you can't
like the kind of organization that young radical Harry Watson would've been involved with. Among other issues, OutRage! was heavily involved in the activism for a change in the UK age of consent for gay sex, which in 1994 was lowered from 21 to 18.
He swallows. "Good?" he asks, and looking down at him flushed lips parted wide-eyed, Sherlock nods.
John swallows, and drags the lot off the hanger: doesn't take much, he's only got three. Sherlock is watching him, lying half curled up on his side. The duvet's all rucked sideways again.
He feels wrung out. Aching. The strange not-quite-or-too-much over-squeezed feeling of coming dry, unprepared; Sherlock's desperate starved breathing behind him. Sherlock's wiry arm wrapped around his middle, tight-tight-
"Let's go out," Sherlock says.

to know him, even in the face of all the concrete evidence of all the ways in which he didn't really ever go away. In this nested tree of file folders there is some quantity of photographic and textual and, for all he knows, video evidence of—of this other person, who John has known, all along, existed. Exists. Photographs of a Canadian passport, John suspects; bank cards, perhaps: all of them excellent forgeries. An archive of symbols for a person who isn't Sherlock, not exactly, but also isn't
Under him Sherlock shifts, just barely. His fingers fold up with John's, then pull apart. "I won't let you," he says, quiet. Touching. Soft.
"When it comes to sex," John says, "I never know when I should say no."
"I was in the army," he says, finally. Looking up. She frowns. "Thirteen years," he says.
until Sherlock drops his hands at last and then kisses him, hard heart pounding and hungry and—and
That glowing-hot light-welling feeling, turned inside out. An auto fire, John is thinking, spine prickling, after a crash. He breathes: out, in, out; and then
Which it—
"I," can't—
Sherlock's lips part, very slightly: his face. A deep, unreadable dark sea.
In reply Sherlock rubs his two slick fingers over John's arsehole, bends back down to lick hot and good just under his hand still hard on the root of John's cock. John's legs twitch. Breathing deep. Sherlock pets at him, stroking; dips only just in, as though John is not already opening up relentlessly for all of him all over while Sherlock kneels between his sprawled-out thighs and sucks on his aching balls. Sherlock's not doing anything that'll actually get him off, but John's still inferno-red with it, dripping all over his belly, and when Sherlock pulls back, leans up to look at him, John chews on his own bottom lip, desperate not to close his eyes. Sherlock bends back down, spits against him:
"Tea?" he asks without looking, when John comes over.
A kiss.
"Without cause?" she asks, chin lifting, head tilting slightly to the left.
"The one at Westminster Abbey was my favorite," Greg says. "He'd used some sort of a girl's alarm clock, very princessy, with this sort of... sparkly liquid in its frame like a snow globe, so if it
"Facing the chair, bending over the seat," Sherlock says.
"I don't—I know you don't want me to think it's pathological," John says. Breathing: again, and again, and again. "But I—I have to think about it somehow, because I—I don't know what actually—
asked Sherlock for things, he knows he has, but he—he can't—
"You mean," says Sherlock, shifting: his hands dragging the belt low on John's wide-awake hips. John. Breathes.
"I don't need you to do anything to me, all right?" John repeats; watching Sherlock's eyes. His lovely wide eyes bottle-green in the lamplight: Christ, he is. He's— "I want you to get what you need," John tells him, "and I want you to sleep. That's—it. That's everything, for me."
, I want you to—" and so John whispers, "Kiss me," and into his mouth Sherlock gasps, "Yes."
Cold. John holds it in his fingers. When he touches Sherlock again, Sherlock still shivers. John tugs him in closer; Sherlock clings. Pets at John's hips, John's belly: the prickling inside-out feeling that lives under his skin. It's still far too hot. John wishes they weren't screwing on the duvet, just so John would have something to pull over them. Close them in. He presses his body close, blanketing. Pulse fluttering skin wet: John nudges at the rim of Sherlock's body, his free hand tucked around Sherlock to rub at the back of his tense shoulder; and Sherlock twists his face to the hinge of John's crooked-up embracing arm as John slides his two fingers back inside. Sherlock breathes. Breathes. John folds his knee over Sherlock's other leg, their tangled-up thighs. Pulling him in. Wanting him so close it feels like Sherlock's doing it to himself, nearly: so close that Sherlock can't be afraid. "All right?" John asks. Petting. Sherlock nods pressing close-closer to him and John pets.

He nods, twice.

"Well, it's not a real thriller if it doesn't leave you crushed with existential dread," she says; and he laughs, warm and pleased. It's—an obscurely delightful image, somehow: Marianne with her hipster glasses and teacherly chunky-knit cardigans, bashing out overwrought spy novels in her sun-flooded little flat, still using that lumpy brown-and-purple hand-made mug, the one with
"This seems like a frustrating and fairly pointless exercise," Sherlock says to the ceiling, "if precisely neither of us is certain what either of us wants."
"An advantage," Sherlock echoes; and John nods.
John's fingers: warm ribs. Sherlock's breath has picked up; his forehead-nose-mouth clumsily mashed to John's skin. Hunched over, still; held perilously tight.
"Yeah," Sherlock says, "sometimes."
, John thinks, when he's got a jammy piece of toast hanging out of the corner of his mouth, refilling the kettle;
He could rub himself off through the knickers. Pull them up over the head of his prick so he'd come just inside them, lick them off, rinse them out; he could get out Sherlock's crime-scene camera and spread himself out on Sherlock's filthy white bed. He could work himself just up to the edge with Sherlock's glass plug up inside him and the scanty strap back of the knickers holding it in, then ring Sherlock up and ask for directions.
"Lovely," Sherlock murmurs, and John moans. Roiling under his flayed crackling skin as "Filthy," Sherlock breathes, hot on his jaw; "my dirty—" while "little—" John "boy—"
is that Sherlock was very far from twenty-one, and he—the man. was. older." John takes a breath. "Much older. A full decade older than him, a post-grad, working with Sherlock's grandmother at Oxford. When Sherlock was—he was just. Home from school."
"Six?" John guesses, and after a moment, Sherlock nods. John pets down over the ball, pets the backs of his toes.
"Sh-Sherlock." Voice grinding in his throat: Christ, John might as well get down and— "I—
. John wants to eat him alive. "Ten," John repeats. Sherlock shivering against him, kissing—licks. John licks. Licks. Sherlock makes another small electric sound and John rubs their noses together, pets Sherlock's warm skin. Back. Belly. Hip. His hand nestling back in between them— (He could open him up. Pull him out and over and apart.) John's fingertips burrowed and nesting their mouths scrape open-closed and John's hand is still. Soft. Still. Then soft,
, Sherlock replies; John grins.
"I just need you not to move, just for a minute," Sherlock says unsteadily, "except, except for this," and then kisses him, kisses him over and over with his cock still hard inside him and John wants to move and not stop but everything but his mouth twisted back to meet Sherlock's mouth he holds himself still, still, still.
"It'd be eight," Sherlock gasps, "if you'd just—

Sherlock grimaces. Rubs at his face. "I
and "I want," John blurts and then stops. Tight. Teeth shut.
"Yeah," John agrees, and Sherlock touches John's hip through his jeans. The buttoned-up placket of his shirt. John's belly jumps.
"Ten, fifteen minutes," Sherlock says, stabbing at the pan, "I just started the pasta."
"Better," Holmes says. "Surely you can't think it's
Tight, Gasping. Gasping.
"Precision as ever my goal, of course," John says.
"I'm hardly," Sherlock says, and then stops.
, and I—I had sort of excruciatingly humiliating conversation with your brother—" the prissy-pinched mouth comes back, for that— "but that's nothing new, and I—"
John shakes his head, hair scraping between Sherlock's twelve thousand white pillows. "I trust you," he says.
"Fuck," Sherlock gasps, "fuck,
He can hear George shifting, at his back. "How so?" George asks.
"Hm." Sherlock inhales, sighs. "I should be," he admits.
. You know I dislike agreeing with your sister, but if her moving out of London spares us another dinner with that self-important cow, I will wholeheartedly endorse it."
Rhoda is in again in the morning. Back behind Natalie's desk talking about something, bent close, voice too low to hear. John arranges his face and heads over: "Oh," Natalie says, looking up. A smile. "Evie's feeling better, isn't that marvelous?"
"Mm." John licks his lip: pets circles, circles. Sherlock is breathing hard. Flushing all down his throat. "Tell me more," John says; and Sherlock lets out a slow, half-breath hollow groan.
"Well, you're in with every lunatic private detective
It's thirty-four minutes past nine, John notes.
And he doesn't.
Sherlock's bottom lip tucks in, a flicker of tongue.
, and
John shuts his mobile up in the top drawer of his desk. Burnt into him, he doesn't need to reread it. Couldn't even if he wanted to; a quarter to midnight last night:
"I've not put much thought into it," Sherlock says, easily parrying John's jab for his elbow. "Hardly traditional foil. Do I score a touch for that?"
"I can ask, yeah?" he says. "I mean, about—about other things."
"Possibly," she concedes, and sips her wine.
"And not sorry about it," Sherlock says, very softly, "I don't think."
"So you could." John tastes. "Later, if you wanted." Saliva. Skin. "You could calm down a bit," half-breathed, "and then."
"I wouldn't've done it like that if I'd known how it'd be for you," Sherlock says, after a long, taut moment; and John breathes.
, I, Christ, I need him to kiss me, I just need him to
"Why offer another go, then?" John murmurs, as Sherlock nuzzles into his throat; and Sherlock exhales, slow and steady, just against his skin. Knee tucked between John's against the sheets.
Sherlock is turning his hot face toward John's face: their noses bump and brush. John's fingers curling on the damp-soft skin of Sherlock's back. He presses them broad and flat, drawing Sherlock towards him, velvety and warm; but Sherlock pulls away. Rolled-up cuffs but nothing unbuttoned he pulls his shirt right off. It makes John want to be naked: Sherlock's dark eyes bare torso in his hands in their kitchen, hair static-frazzled and sticking up; but John is bad at being naked, with Sherlock. Instead: weight, toes; mouth, throat; with his arms wrapping tight around Sherlock's warm sides and middle as Sherlock takes a long, slow breath. John can feel it: tongue and lips, breath and pulse. He kisses the side of Sherlock's Adam's apple, the hollow between clavicle and throat: Sherlock's hands rest on him: the back of his shoulder, his hair.
"I'm not going to let you rush me, remember?" Sherlock says, quiet, but he squeezes John's right buttock and then sinks his fingers into him, curling: John groans. "Keep telling me," Sherlock whispers; "Good," John gasps, "it's—good,
, John'd said, then had to add,
"Good boy," Sherlock says, and John gasps, "
"Do you want to?" he asks, rock-rough.
John reaches back up over his braced arm, trades the loofah for the bar of soap: careful. He wants to be so careful, can't think how to be more careful, soaps up his fingers and keeps the bar of soap tucked in against the palm of his right hand, careful, resting against the base of Sherlock's pale back flushing a delicate shell pink from the heat. John pets his lathery fingers over the swell of Sherlock's buttocks, soaps under their curve and down the tops of Sherlock's thighs, rubs foam through Sherlock's wiry hair atop his crinkled-soft damp-satin hidden tender skin, and John doesn't linger; except, perhaps, at the little dimples at the tops of Sherlock's round cheeks. He can see Sherlock's ribs move, his heavy-breath. Steam-thick, John thinks, and—. And—.
"Do you track him?" John asks, thinking hard. Thinking and thinking.
Into silence. "Are you happy?" Sherlock repeats.
Sherlock nods, thighs tensing as he goes to stand, and John violates every rule he'd thought he'd had, to put his hand on Sherlock's knee and squeeze.
one had been different, had
They kiss. Awkward, twisted like this: John doesn't want to stop. Outside: warm sun and traffic. Disorientating, really. Kissing Sherlock in their living room: a year ago John'd half thought he'd never want to kiss anyone again. Two things, formerly unconnected; but now. All around them possibility. Sherlock could keep leaning back kissing John twisting over his shoulder; later John could rub his neck. Or John could pull him around to face him and kiss him properly, arm round his middle. Hand on his arse. Or John could sink down to his knees and drag Sherlock's bottoms with him, lick into him right there beside their open windows while Sherlock held onto his music stand to keep his lovely knobby knees from buckling or—or John could wrestle him down to the floor and roll around with him for hours; or pull him back and into their living room striped with shadows to the sofa, coax Sherlock's disheveled dark head down to rest on his knees; or. Or John could go with him into the kitchen and make their tea, while Sherlock makes their breakfast.
When he's almost caught his breath, John says, "Jesus Christ," then laughs.
"No," John gasps, skin crawling, "please—"; and "Kiss me," Sherlock says, rough; and helpless—

"—New York until Wednesday," Brian is saying to Natalie, who is rifling around in the clutter on top of her desk. "He hates to miss my weeks, but there wasn't any cure for it, this time."
...had he?
"Shocking." John props the rattling shower door open with his forearm, turns on the taps. "Skipped games entirely, I take it?" He runs his fingers into the water: cold, cold, cool; then lets the shower door shut as he twists back: a better use of their time.
"And you—did you already know how to cook?"
, at last; and John swallows, heart thumping. Presses his forehead to Sherlock's forehead.
Sherlock shakes his head.
"Hm," Sherlock agrees, rubbing.
His whole body feels limp. Poured out. All over his fist and his jeans—fuck. He would lie there sticky and shuddering but he has to—he grabs at his mobile and smacks at the screen.
"That's something you're going to have to tell me," he says, and John can't say anything. Sitting trapped and frozen, face hot, unable to quite look George in the eye.
Another person, he thinks, would probably—doubt, at least for a moment; John doesn't. He slides his gun into his holster and pulls down his jumper and trots down to the first-floor landing and sticks his head into the living room to ask, "Sherlock?" even though he isn't expecting an answer. He doesn't get one. He shuts his teeth again and marches down to the street which is empty with his mobile already tucked up to his ear ringing, ringing, ringing; but Sherlock is gone, doesn't answer; and John is finding that precisely no part of him is surprised.
. "I think I can understand that," John says, at last.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Pants, trousers, you know," he says, very quietly, and moving past him John brushes his palm over Sherlock's bent head, and Sherlock makes a caught, breathless sound.
"—pinned, but you'd want my mouth free, wouldn't you?" John's throat hurts. "So you could hear me—"
Sherlock sounds a little bit offended; John looks up to find his chins gearing up for full wrinkle.
"All right?" Sherlock asks.
He can't possibly get hard again, can he? but still his hips are still shifting against the pillows still restless and hungry as the lid on the lube clicks as Sherlock presses his long fingers into him, very, very slow. Christ. John's raw-flayed body, can't help it, is pushing back around him barely thinking, breathing hard, pulled-apart and raw and somehow, somehow still bloody
. "What," John asks, "am I doing all the work?"
After a moment Sherlock says, "I am—angry, you know," in a clumsy, stumbling sort of a way.
"You like kissing," Sherlock says, quiet. Lips still touching: brushing apart.
"If we're going to keep doing this we'd better start keeping tissues in the living room," John says.
. John, for his part, had forgiven him, wept all over him, got furious with him, and then forgiven him again all in the space of about an hour and a half. Then he'd had a 48-hour interlude where he'd thought, shamefully, that he could yet go back to being Sherlock Holmes's orbiting moon—but he'd righted himself, pulled back, resettled into something less impossible: working something close to full days with Cal and Jeremy; letting Sherlock, newly possessed of a mysterious and previously wholly-absent familiarity with what kitchens were for, cook him overly complicated dinners; trailing along on a case or two at the weekends; moving his shirts back into the wardrobe upstairs. But every paper in the city was still screeching about Sherlock, and in all that noise John'd lumbered about London in a vague, overwhelmed fog: Sherlock'd got too much sun while he was away. He'd had
"It's a bit of an excuse," he whispers; but Sherlock shakes his head.
"So you've asked him not to go off without you," George says, "and—"
"John," Sherlock gasps, "
"Please." Thick. "Please don't—"
"; and Sherlock actually, quite literally, steps back.
"I'm beginning to think you've lost count," Holmes murmurs, "should I start over?"
The whole business of Sherlock's six and a half minutes. John shifts, uncomfortable: he knows Sherlock just said it to get a rise out of him, truly; his stamina is perfectly fine. It's a bit hard to prove it, though, when he's tossing off in the middle of their living room and Sherlock's fully dressed watching him from the sofa with those knife-edge eyes: anyone'd be a little bit quick off the mark like that, John thinks. Anyone at all. He drops his head back in the chair. Surely it must be longer than six and a half minutes—not
"All right down there?" John asks, scraping Sherlock's hair off his forehead.
"There isn't anything for us to use to entertain ourselves," John says. "Hence."
Sherlock doesn't answer.
"What are you

John's fingers twitch. Memory.
"Smoking," John snarls, "behind the bike sheds." His face is tightened up in knots, baring his teeth, even though Holmes can't see.
"Tell me," Sherlock says, low, "just what you shouldn't do."
. John likes how he feels: under John's hands the back of Sherlock's warmth-crumpled soft shirt over his blood-hot skin. John likes how he feels above him and below him and behind him and in front of him slouching into him while they kiss: that is not, John knows, what he'd meant. Touching him belly-zip-pocket long hands. Against his mouth Sherlock murmurs, "Want to—" so John wants to too and a sudden-hot surge of shame and then drained, swallowed, gone. Sherlock's foot is moving so John's foot is moving, too. The side of his sole, the bump of his toes: John breathes deep and moves as Sherlock moves when Sherlock moves John moves too. A kiss, a kiss, another: Sherlock's moving lips move John's lips John's tongue, as their bare feet tangle and slip on the lino, until the ridge of the doorframe, sudden, presses into John's spine. Kissing, pressed against him toes to tongue, his long fingertips just tucked the front left pocket of John's jeans. Mouth open on John's mouth Sherlock tugs: John swallows, "Mm," half-sighed, "your bed's," caught murmuring between their moving mouths, "a mess." Sherlock inhaling: cool on John's lips but the satin-soft skin on his sides in John's hands is hot, hot, hot. "Improve my sheets," Sherlock asks, "did you?" and mouth slipping against his mouth up-down up-down John nods. His breath streaming out into Sherlock inspiring-expanding-inspired while Sherlock—slides his fingertips into—thin cotton-skin between them: "Oh," Sherlock murmurs. "Good." Against him John shivers, breath caught: "Have to—
he was always into sodding everything: Sherlock breaking away panting flushed scarlet as he fumbles John's dildo out of the drawer behind him and then—then fucking
Sherlock makes a small, uncertain noise. John tucks himself closer against him. Cock half-hard against him knees between his knees hands on his back. In his fingertips the syncopated-staccato concert of their hearts. John kisses him again. Again. Sherlock's hands are tracing a slow, meandering path down John's back, as though their final destination were anything other than patently obvious. Pulse loud John lets him. Gives him slow warm kisses and lets Sherlock roll himself tentatively onto his back so he can slowly uncertainly pull John on top of him, as though he'd said nothing. John presses his weight down against him and kisses him: a secret that John is willing to keep.
Sherlock squints open one eye.
"Yeah," John manages. "Yeah."
"Well,
"Of course," Natalie beams. She's a student in some arts program or another, goes in for acting, and she makes it very hard to forget; John laughs, a little, awkwardly.
John gasps. Cheeks flooded hot
"M'not a cat," says Sherlock, disgruntled; and John rests his head back against porcelain, sleepy, oughtn't be. Sherlock's face blurred in pieces as John blinks in the light.
"If it happened today it'd be entirely legal," Sherlock says. He sounds defensive: John splays his hand flat on Sherlock's warm ribs as Sherlock is saying, "Inadvisable, most likely, but what isn't, of what one does at seventeen?"
John is watching his face, far away. "I talked to Rhoda," John offers, finally, for lack of much of anything better to say; and Sherlock's blank eyes slide up to his. John swallows. "She'd rather we avoided the 30
"I'm not—." John's arms, crossed over his stomach. Squeezing. "Sherlock, I'm—I'm
, and then stumbles up onto unsteady feet and kneels down.
John's buttoned back up, but he still feels weirdly exposed, with Sherlock watching him like that. All the parts of him feel poorly connected when he sits on the edge of his chair. He asks, "Is this all right, truly?"
John opens his mouth.
"I just mean," John says, "I want to take care of you however you like," very quietly, and then swallows, sliding his palms down to rest on Sherlock's shoulders, John's thumbs bracketing his collar bracketing the hollow of his red, warm throat.
Sherlock rubs his mouth across John's skin, over and over: John's toes curl. "I know," Sherlock says, very quietly.
Sherlock's expression is unreadable. Flat. His fingers curling against John's back.
"Yeah. Works at... Capo—no, Kapa, I think. Biotech firm. Friend of Stamford's."
"The end of the first week," Sherlock says, "especially."
Gasping. Gasping.
"Is it." John stops, because Sherlock is kissing him. With a lot of tongue. Open-mouthed. Makes him shiver all over.
"All right," he says, after a moment. Grudgingly.
"I can't take much of that," Sherlock admits, and John bends back down. Sherlock had got his mouth on him, had kissed; so John bends down and gives him a kiss. Pets at his thighs, another, another: the base of his penis, his scrotum, just under his balls; and Sherlock is drawing his leg up, hesitant, slow. John strokes up the back of Sherlock's leg, eases his thigh towards his chest, and then bends in to kiss at the tender back of his knee: soft, slow. Sherlock gasps, his other thigh twitching, so John nudges that one up, too.
"I've already seen what you shove up your arse." Sherlock tightens the strap 'round his right thigh with a

John nods. "I did," he says, aching, "I did": and Sherlock kisses the corner of his mouth.

Sherlock's eyes crinkle up: his half-laughing downturned mouth. Warm bubbling-over: "
"Why'd you toss off in the shower, anyway?" he asks, squinting up.
"Fuck." John rubs at his face.
John grinds his teeth together. Not fast enough: humiliating, that little whining gasp.
"You don't have a second set of sheets," Sherlock explains; and John looks at the bare mattress, then licks his bottom lip, and closes his bedroom door.
Sherlock nods again. Close: warm and moving and real.
"Rinse, then," he says, at last; and Sherlock shuffles obediently to the side, ducking back under the spray. His face just flushed pink, pink mouth slack. Eyes closed.
Between their bodies their fingers tangle, untangle. Wind and unwind. Wherever they touch John feels like—like the sunlight filtering in through Mrs. Hudson's filmy white curtains is, in fact, welling up from between them. As though they are those peculiar sorts of deep-water creatures that live in utter darkness, but phosphoresce on contact. With both of them watching John traces the sides of Sherlock's long fingers with his fingertips, up and down, up and down; and neither of them says a thing.
