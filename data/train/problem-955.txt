He had a niece, a niece with no name. That would need to be altered as soon as possible. Most likely John would need to pick it but Mycroft should have some influence he reasoned. Something proper; Elizabeth, Francesca, Monica, Belinda all strong choices, family names, his own mother’s name Violet would have to be an option. He was pulled out of his musings by the voice of the good doctor, no strong emotion was indicated but he hadn’t moved far past the doorway, enough to close it certainly but not further,
Greg was still married, Mycroft seemed to be ruling the world from his desk and there was still the mystery of the silvery haired woman who’d been running around Mycroft’s house. In his warm embrace Greg had forgotten to ask about her identity but he was sure she was in some way related to Mycroft; her eyes had been too similar for them not to share DNA.  God but that kiss, he ran the tips of his fingers against his lips lightly, bringing back the feeling of pressure he’d experienced earlier. It’d been slow and light but he’d felt more emotion in it than he could ever remember experiencing in a kiss before. He felt they’d been working up to this moment for so long that the idea of waiting before progressing made him unhappy but he knew it’d be a disservice to both of them for this to move forwards before Greg was free of his wife. It’s not that he’d never had grounds for divorce, he had numerous, but he’d never found something to motivate him to take that final move and hire a lawyer. He was scared to be alone, he’d been married for fifteen years and he wasn’t sure he knew how to be without her anymore, his friends told him he should respect himself enough to leave her, his family said he deserved better and Sally liked to remind him on a regular basis that he would be a catch for anyone. He’d never hidden his bisexuality from anyone, he was comfortable with himself and what it meant to find both sexes attractive but he thought it might still shock some people if he ended up dating men, one particular man especially, he wanted to find Mycroft, wanted to know if he had something to look forward to once he signed those papers. Walking out of the library he entered the same hallway as before, the empty space was filled with the ticking of an old fashioned grandfather clock, the sound reminded Greg of a metronome he’d had while learning to play the piano with his grandfather, he’d always found the regular tick soothing.
“I am listening, Mr Mitrović, please continue.”
‘I didn’t know if you’d seen or would have heard anything. I wanted to know if he was alright; he was always so good to Sherlock and so polite when he had to come for those drug busts. He never asked about my soothers you know.’
Mina’s scream penetrates the near silence and he reacts on instinct; right hand drawing his gun from its place on the side table. Hitting the stairway before whoever has entered downstairs, thoughts of Mrs Hudson occur quickly but whoever it is seem focused on the stairs and entering 221b, his territory. He moves to the bottom of Mina’s stairs, gun raised, he’ll kill anyone who tries to harm her, she’s still screaming and he moves backwards up the stairs, he’s wary of tripping but they’re getting closer now, he turns and runs the final section of stairs flinging open the door to the nursery.
This little girl, she looked so small, John couldn’t see her being much older than two and it broke his heart to think someone so small had been somewhere so horrid. That there were people out there who would hurt someone as innocent as this child, the idea was beyond him. God what was wrong with him, he was growing attached to a picture, to the idea of a child, oh but this was so like Sherlock, he always managed to draw John in with the smallest details,
The alcohol and residual adrenaline were creating a haze in John’s mind. He sipped at the glass in his hand, turning away from Mycroft’s probing gaze and wandering toward his daughter. Her lips had parted in her sleep, pressed in a way which made them look like she was delivering a kiss.
‘I can’t explain why I like the quotes idea, it’s just that when I read it to her certain lines strike me as being so full of wonder, I want that for her.’ John wanted more than anything to fill his daughters world full of magic and light, Tammy smiles at him lightly, he’s been surprised by her ability to relate to his feelings when it came to Mina, when he’d asked about her family she’d explained she was an only child and didn’t hold any desire for her own. She was naturally nurturing but John appreciated that not everyone wanted to be a parent. He’d not been sure himself until Mina, he still found himself having to adapt on occasion but he felt that was most likely normal.
‘Alright good, second question, is there someone else in your home? Someone who shouldn’t be? A threat?’
I hope I will be with you next Christmas and will have found the courage to tell you quite how much you have come to mean to me.
“Well fucking do something Sally! The bastard is key to our investigation, the spooks can’t just spirit him away because they’re bloody done with him! We’re not, you tell them that.”
‘You are in for a treat Watson.’ Tammy followed him removing the rainbow scarf she’d draped over her shoulders, the woman’s fashion choices always made him smile, she was rarely conservative with her colour choices and more often than not her clothes told some form of story. He’d noticed that while in her store her clothing never ventured far from a jeans, t-shirt, converse combination but on the occasions he’d seen her outside of work she’d surprised him, often times looking more like a children television presenter rather than a business owner in her late twenties. ‘Today for our viewing pleasure I have bought some classic British Sci-Fi which beautifully blends the 1920’s style, time travel and in honour of your set company for tomorrow some landed gentry. There’s a country house, hidden passageways and a ball.’  She hops onto the kitchen side before removing her jacket, the t-shirt she wears underneath carries a circular emblem with interweaving lines, circles and crescent shapes. John can’t tell where he’s seen the golden design before but it strikes him as familiar.
‘Oh is that so, who have you bought?’ light flooded the entryway and the elderly woman gasped at the small group of men in her hallway. ‘John’ her hand flew to her mouth and Mycroft was certain the tears would come next, sighing he decided that none of this was going to plan but he might as well continue as if it were.
“He threatened her?” John asked.
Mycroft pauses here, he’s clearly extremely uncomfortable, John can’t say anything about the last  two hours has been pleasant for him either but this must be more complicated for Mycroft. There’s a certain undercurrent to his relationship with his mother, clear adoration on one level and something like bitterness as well. The two juxtapose each other to such a degree that their interactions seem stilted. John had wondered if it was merely the presence of a stranger in their midst but it’s becoming steadily clearer that the two have some unresolved issues.
Their absence that year had started a trend and every year Greg’s excuses became less and less tangible until he finally placed himself on the rota for working the blasted holidays every year. He had done that for the last four years and honestly he had been happier at work than he would have been at home. His wife was likely happier in his absence as well. But not this year. This year Greg had booked the holiday off, he had put to one side his plans for late night Chinese food and depressing conversations with Thompson, this year he was going home for Christmas. He had called his mother and made her promise to buy new tinsel, she had seemed surprised but quietly optimistic in the presence of his enthusiasm. When she asked if Denise would be coming for dinner Greg had said no., There had been silence for a few minutes before his mother simply said ‘good’ and they left the topic alone, his mother promising to make fresh minced pies in time for his evening arrival on Christmas Eve. His brother had called next, annoyed that Greg was promising his attendance when he had missed so many events over recent years but Greg had sworn to him that he would attend. His sister had simply sent him an email stating ‘I’m so bloody excited’ and numerous pictures of his nephews dressed as elves and snow men. Greg would admit to nobody that the sight of those three beautiful faces had brought a tear to his eye. He had missed so much throughout his marriage and it was time for that to come to an end.
‘Lestrade calling for status report, Donovan.’
I saw the picture. God John. It has been so long since I last saw you and to then see you like that, with those people, and with that woman. Your arm wrapped around her and you wearing that half smile that was always a lie.
"Another place?" John asked.
Redbeard died just after my twelfth birthday, I was broken by his loss John, he meant such a great deal to me and I had missed his final weeks because of my parents’ insistence that I attended the same school institution as countless Holmes men before me.
p.s. 'There's an east wind coming'
They undress each other in silence, John taking the time to pepper Sherlock’s shoulders with kisses, taking the time to drop to his knees and kiss the small pink scar left behind from the bullet that had pierced his abdomen. Sherlock gasps and his cock twitches in interest from within its silken confines but John just smiles up at him and doesn’t touch.
With the front door closing solidly and Mrs Hudson taking herself off for a quick sit down in her own living room, John thought the whole experience may have taken more out of her than any of the rest of them, John was faced by an empty flat, he’d not been alone here for months but the space didn’t look as oppressive anymore. In all honesty the only place John felt uncomfortable was the room at the end of the corridor he was now facing. Truly accepting this space as his, removing Sherlock’s eclectic belongings and replacing them with his own seemed unfair somehow, insulting almost. He entered the room slowly, watching the dust motes swirl in the early evening light he tried to truly see the space objectively but it seemed impossible.
Gregory Lestrade paused here and he heard a minor conversation in the background, he could not hear the other person's input but the detectives came through only slightly obscured. He pulled up his link to the Metropolitan Police database imagining the call related to a case the older man was working on, Anthea started to control the desktop remotely from her position outside the room; she monitored his calls for the most part. She navigated the multiple layers of security from her own desk and computer, the woman was a certified genius with computers, a government trained hacker, he believed it was lucky for the country he found her before the likes of Assange turned her to promoting freedom of information instead; they had yet to discover a computer system she failed to break into given enough time. Case document's filled his screen as the woman filtered through them for relevant information, she highlighted the sections he may need to reference although through an initial scan Mycroft wondered why the Detective would call him over something so mundane. His latest reported raid had failed to turn up any issues of national security, he had been brought back to reality by Anthea's large text appearing on his screen, 'He's speaking again Sir', he had managed to drift from the conversation entirely at some point, he swore the woman was a witch sometimes.
‘Wonderful things Orchids, so varied in their blooms and markings but so overwhelmingly beautiful. Each breed has its own individual features and challenges, but I fail to think of a more universally appealing flower. But then again I am biased.’
‘Hello,’ his voice is croaky and he quickly drinks some of the water he finds next to his phone,
“Yes, I can only apologise, sir, I lost my temper.”
“But you were a drug cartel,” Greg said, confused.
“Alright Sally, I understand what you’re saying. Just keep me in the loop if you hear anything more. Do we have strong cases for the ones we’re keeping?” Greg shook his head slightly before hanging up his phone.
They all took some time to digest this information; Greg came to stand beside John so he could look at the picture as well.
‘Dr Watson if you do not have any questions I shall take my leave of you. My colleague Lisa will be bring the child here within the next hour. She has spent the time between police involvement and now in the hospital; receiving treatment as well as being tested for multiple issues. We have very little understanding of her medical history as well as the history of her family, although we are now aware of the lineage on her father’s side her mother remains a mystery. Her treatment will continue until such a time as the state considers her to be physically well enough to be left in your hands. I imagine as a doctor you will have more of an understanding as to the treatments she will receive, however there is a legal need for them to be carried out by someone not related to the patient.’
You are most likely wondering why I do not remove myself from this hell hole and the answer is a simple one; across from me, at the centre of this thuggish gang, sits my next target. He was a minor part of Moriarty’s web, granted, but with his master’s downfall Kemran Abdulov has been slowly making himself irreplaceable to Sebastian Moran. He has taken over control of the Silk Road operations and runs them with an iron fist. You would not know it to look at him; slight build, overly long greasy black hair, mid twenties, three bastard children he cares little for and a wife he barely sees, but the man is becoming a mob boss in his own right.
‘Well Mina, now that we have embarrassed your Uncle Mycroft and Greg thoroughly should we unpack all these provisions. We could try out a snack from the approved list our friend Lisa has bought.’ He grins at the social worker and accepts the folder she holds out to him, her own smile in place she grabs three of the bags from the floor and follows him once he scoops up the forth. Leaving his friends to their blushes seems like the best idea at present.
‘Honestly Mother, Mycroft is the name you gave me if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end.’  Violet merely tuts at him on her way to once again fix her hair in the mirror, ‘You look fine Mother, I hardly think Doctor Watson will think badly of you if you have a hair out of place.’
‘Yes I understand and agree to the terms you just mentioned, do I need to sign anything now?’
‘John, I don’t know what further advice I can give you, unfortunately I am similar to my brother in my understanding of emotional matters, either of us particularly well versed in the care of others.’
“Nah, this isn’t right. I want the house. The other bullshit I don’t care. But the house I want.” His solicitor had advised that selling and dividing the profits would be the most prudent but Greg didn’t know if he honestly cared anymore.
‘I believe we shall be at a significant disadvantage this evening Father, Mother seems to have come over all French, would you believe it’ Siger’s quiet chuckle continued as they made their way through the foyer to the dining room,
“Mrs. Hudson he’s not trusting us so why…”Greg said.
Stay happy, MJ X
‘The quality might not be very good and the sound a little tinny, but still,’ he hands over his phone where he’s loaded a small video clip. He recognises the audio from his journey in the car, he watched the clip on repeat while waiting to arrive and it had kept him sane for the most part. Although his earlier deep set obsession with his tie choice now makes him feel foolish.
Mycroft notes John’s quiet exhale and wonders if he’d anticipated having to sit through a hellish hour of the details surrounding his daughter’s previous life, ‘Since then, John, I have kept my parents updated about any improvements you have reported with regards to Mina’s health and or wellbeing, my mother I believe has more questions pertaining to those changes,’ he leaves the sentence open hoping his mother will jump in with one of the many questions she’s been throwing at him over the previous week.
‘Morning Greg, what’ll it be today?’
Dear John
“Now, did you notice anything odd about the money that was coming in while Sebastian was spending time with your husband?”
“Well, Gregory, they are numerous and only partly salacious. Mostly I enjoy the idea of you finding comfort in my home. I do so wish for your happiness Gregory.” Greg found himself grinning fondly, he believed Mycroft wholeheartedly and informed him thusly as well as telling him the feeling was reciprocated.
He hears the light tread on the stairs and moves to stand, it’s most likely Mrs Hudson but he’ll take no chances, his hand moves to rest on his chest so he can make the short move to the counter where he knows the knife draw is, it becomes obvious his caution was over zealous when Mrs Hudson knocks on the open door,
He opens his mouth the tell Sherlock this, to advise him to abandon John in favour of Lestrade who is tall and distinguished in every way John is short and podgy.
“Because what is a criminal mastermind when faced with the two greatest minds in Britain. So why would he have killed himself?”
‘How can a two year old not have a name? Surely her mother gave her one?’
CHRISTMAS. DULL. UNORIGINAL.
‘Yes Mrs Hudson,’ he moves to great her and quickly helps by removing the majority of the boxes she has resting in her arms, he lifts the security lock on the baby gate to allow her access to the main living space, ‘watch your step Mrs Hudson, Mina would appear to have built a small maze of obstacles for our collective enjoyment’ he’s found it easier to get along with the woman since Sherlock’s death. She found him once when he visited Sherlock’s grave, she’d come to change the flowers, he later found out she did this every Sunday, he’d been sitting staring at the black headstone and cursing his own stupidity. He’d watched Sherlock near constantly threw the years of his addiction but once he removed himself from the world, once he moved in to 221b, once he found John, he’d begun to worry about his wellbeing less. He’d watched just as closely on occasion but the majority of the time he’d taken a step back. He received two, instead of four, security briefings a day and removed Sherlock’s security team altogether after the third time Dr Watson accosted his brother would be attacker before the team had even mobilised. She’d joined him in his contemplation, laying a hand on the one he had clenched on his knee, they didn’t speak but every Sunday since they met there, shared stories they had of the periods of Sherlock’s life they’d both known well. When he’d offered to pay her for the upkeep of 221b for the foreseeable future the older woman had smiled softly at him and said it was his for as long as he needed.
"John, you're beautiful. You always have been."
"I'm fine, Sherlock. I'm sorry I worried you."
"And I love you, John Watson. Hamish and everything." Just as the sealing kiss was again going to go past a point of no return, Sherlock unceremoniously dumped the parcel, which John vaguely remembered being somewhere on the the side away from where he was sitting, into John's lap. He was reminded of their state of undress as he looked down at it, yet didn't much care in light of this new yet inevitable and timeless development.
He moved his lips to John's, slim and soft and tasting of his favourite bag tea with honey. Great sucking kisses stole John's words and his breath and he didn't resist. He in fact actively participated, sliding a hand up his back into his tangled black curls and moving to straddle his lean sheet-covered thighs  with only a physical urging of his movements. John understood without words, so many times. The room went suddenly silver, wind howling through the eaves, rain battering the windows as if trying to break them. This was the dream. This had to be the fantasy, because the real world was never so perfect, so beautiful as John Watson willingly giving himself to him, though he vaguely heard the tearing of his shirt buttons, his own pleas and oaths in the distance. Sherlock begged John to help him, to never leave him. He responded each time that yes, always yes and he could never leave him.
"This was all I could find," John said, holding the bottle of 15 year Irish whisky over his arm as if presenting a bottle of wine for his choosing at a fancy dinner."
"Right. Sorry. I'll just... be a tick."
"Okay," John agreed, taking his lips before he had a chance to say anything else, sucking on his tongue in a manner that made them both moan a little in response to each other.
"Not much."
"Give," John demanded, accompanied by the appropriate gesture.
"Mm." John scooped a bit of the other two onto his dish and tore off a piece of naan with which to sop up the sauces. "It's fine. Get the worst of it out of the way early, I guess. What's Ay... Ayam...?"
John fully entered the kitchen and jokingly stood behind the chair in which Sherlock sat, putting his hands on his shoulders and rhythmically squeezing in a light massaging motion. Sherlock stiffened as he normally did when touch was not anticipated, but he gave no indication he was more uncomfortable than usual. "Mysterious, are we?"
Ever the scientist, however, the experiment wasn't abandoned as, just as John came hard, missing his expensive top by the skin of his teeth by pulling it up as far as possible and Sherlock catching most of it in his hand, Sherlock looked at his watch. John's trousers weren't as lucky. He was in awe all over again as Sherlock began lapping up his emissions with that deft tongue.
"I can't believe that just happened," John murmured.
"Now," Sherlock said sharply, signaling the end of playtime, "I'll get your father out of bed and we shall get you two dressed. Why don't you look in the wardrobe drawers in your room and fetch something to wear."
"Please, God. Yes," he heard himself say automatically. He was going to stop but John was already kissing him, infuriatingly slowly. There had been Maraschino cherries in at least a few of his drinks. Sherlock's deductions paused hard when John sucked on his tongue and drew his hands down his chest, making sure to flick his nipples through his shirt. He whined uncontrollably at the gesture, nearly weeping as John allowed him to grind up against his crotch. Even through the layers, he could smell the arousal and wished his hands free so he could touch back. John experimented on his neck with his mouth, effectively proving it was a good thing his hands weren't free. He might have made everything stop with how fast he would have tried to take control and anything that would lead to him stopping was unacceptable. John found a spot on his throat and he cried out. He hadn't remembered how sensitive his nipples were and, when pinching them combined with what was being done with his neck and pelvis, it was a matter of moments before he was bucking, swearing, and calling out his name, babbling through kisses about how much he'd wanted this and so much more.
"What did you call what I just did?" The git actually seemed a bit embarrassed at his behaviour. "I didn't give in because I couldn't resist, Sherlock, I gave in because you seemed to have actually gotten the point. If I thought you didn't understand, I wouldn't have finished you off and you would have just had to remain frustrated. I'm a lot more patient than you are stubborn, you know."
"No! I planned none of this! Nevertheless it happened and one must... adapt." John nodded in agreement and leaned up to kiss him as sweetly as he could muster. His wistful look dissolved once more into slight uncertainty. Showing on his face at all meant a deep, internal perplexity. "You... you never actually said yes."
"You do a bit," he smirked, letting his hand fall onto his own left shoulder, tracing the large scar he was obviously self-conscious about beneath the shirt there. It told Sherlock that he wasn't the only one laid completely bare now. "It really just means you need people, friends, family. You'll always need someone else. Everyone does."
No, that was too cheesy even for him. John racked his not inconsiderable mind for an opening to the blog post this little adventure would produce. He didn't embellish, as his best/flatmate enjoyed accusing him of doing. He just winnowed the pile of information, leaving the interesting grain whilst letting the chaff blow away. The chaff often included petty arguments, slightly illegal activity, and certain mistakes, such as the huge one he made getting into a hire car with Sherlock Holmes in the dead of Winter, during a snowstorm. They were far from the meager dusting London was getting and John was pretty convinced they'd ended up somewhere between the North Pole and the ice planet of Hoth.
With a loud noise, Sherlock crowded him back against the glass of the sliding kitchen door and took the greatest chance he'd ever taken to date. And that was saying something. John didn't fight him, but did stiffen in surprise again, before relaxing and allowing his tongue access. That's when Sherlock really let everything go, clutching him and nearly lifting him off his feet, reveling in the return of whatever he was conveying. John's taste was ambrosia, intoxicating and more addictive than any drug he'd ever tried. He was in great danger of losing his mind when he sucked on Sherlock's tongue and made the most interesting noise when the action was remunerated. Sherlock slowed, then ended it, before he was past the point of no return.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I see." And 'see' John did, for as soon as Sherlock touched his armpits, his penis twitched. Continued actions caused it to swell and lift, bobbing. John kept his own hands on his knees and watched intently as Sherlock's breathing became louder, more laboured. Soon there were other sounds mixed in, tiny gasps and quiet, short, moans. It couldn't have been more than fifteen seconds, but there he was, fully erect and breathing hard. It was actually pretty fascinating.
"No," he answered truthfully.
"It means," John said slowly, "you're the only one in the world. I invented the identity." Sherlock had to look at him then. They gazed at each other for a moment then dissolved into mirth before they started kissing again. Sherlock supposed he shouldn't have been surprised that this was exactly like the rest of their relationship, all difficult and strange and adrenaline rushes.
"It'll be fine, Sherlock. I won't embarrass you." Then, under his breath, "Nothing bloody does." He heard John click on his electric razor. He would have to trim everything down before shaving properly, Sherlock figured. The state of his friend when he returned from that awful survival training mission he did as a favour to Mycroft was appalling. He looked like a cave man someone had stuffed into khakis and a horrible jumper. His normally neatly cropped hair seemed to be growing from everywhere on his entire head except for his eyeballs. When Sherlock helpfully informed him of his horrid condition, the cheeky bastard grinned, teeth bright ivory peeking through ashen blond wire, and replied that he'd had a chance to clean up more, but he didn't take it in favour of seeing the exact expression Sherlock wore when he turned up looking like that.
He'd had some drinks that day, but even with the two large ones in a row minutes before, it was barely enough to do anything other than lower his inhibitions a bit further, make him think, surprisingly, a bit more clearly. Except for when he had Sherlock's tongue in his mouth and the fingers of his right hand tangled in Sherlock's curls and their free hands on each other's pricks. Only the basest of thoughts survived in this state at first,
"How dare you minimise our relationship."
"So have all of yours been born with hair?" He made sure to keep his tone unconcerned, though her answer made him doubly so.
"I... well... Okay." John went back to his mechanical tea preparation routine.
He couldn't fucking believe this. He couldn't fucking believe that he said 'fucking' in his own fucking mind. It was a constant reminder of how little control he had over it and how that was one of the greatest phobias of a Holmes. It went back to his pre-celibacy days, when a combination of ingrained precautions and extreme luck kept him disease free in his often drug induced promiscuity. This was in fact the number one reason he'd adopted celibacy in the first place. It wasn't exactly the drugs that had the largest effect on his mind. If he was high in a situation where sex wasn't available according to his libido/preference, then he was fine. What the drugs did do, however, was open his mind. They expanded his consciousness, whether it was to slow and examine every minute detail, or speed up and put the details together.
"If all else fails, we can blame it on the alcohol, right?"
"You have my word, remember, John," Mycroft reminded him. He nodded stiffly, he and Sherlock each receiving a sweet kiss for their trouble. Sherlock looked back and forth between his brother and John but stayed quiet. John knew he was just now noticing the shift in his brother's relationship with John. "Now, as to the child's future-"
"God, no. Not pretty enough."
, were all incredibly tedious, and best left to others who seemed to have a higher regard for those sorts of things. For some reason, however, it amused him to teach his upper-level dwelling flatmate things. It was pretty odd, probably residual sentiment from back when he was dead and missed the stupidest things, like Lestrade having the least amount of incompetence, Mrs. Hudson's nattering, John's... He never let himself finish that thought since his return. It was pointless. He only needed to watch the stupid videos or pictures John would send to his phone just to annoy him. Once the former Army doctor got past the whole... punching him every time he showed up... thing. Sherlock had to start saving the photos on his laptop in order to free up space for important things like crime scenes and... well... that was it.
), he needed the loo again. John was thankfully still there, and accepted him back on the sofa easily enough, but hesitated to return to their former position.
He was properly leaking now, the damp patch in his pants growing with every word he uttered, nearly gushing when John formed the word 'masturbation'. "Wait!"
They ran their hands all over each other's bodies, smearing the beads of sweat that had continuously to cropped up as they concentrated on their joining. Sherlock began with the muscle exercises, not moving his hips at all until they were both grunting because John had suddenly remembered anatomy and used those slim hips to tilt him to just the right angle. He then began thrusting upwards, using a few undulations of his own to keep close contact with Sherlock's prostate, guarantee the continuance of the amusing mewling sounds the man known for his deep voice was making. John would speed then slow, see what other noises he could pull from him. They were many and varied, his favourite probably his name repeated over and over in the most broken of voices when Sherlock was close to his orgasm. A few strokes yanked him over the edge before John took his pleasure a second time, the fading, most encouraging words from Sherlock begging him to look at him this time, look into his eyes as he came inside him. John could barely get his eyes to stay open, let alone focus when it washed over him, and all Sherlock did was shower him with praise for how he looked, coming because of him.
"I know," John sighed in return. "But at least people won't be so preoccupied with some perceived Eastenders-type plot point." Sherlock, the bed sheet characteristically wrapped around him, took a chair to his right, pulled it closer to John's side, and sat down in it hard. He then let his head fall on John's shoulder and the doctor gave the top a little kiss before looking back at the screen.
"Now for the final touch."
"What? Wait! No! No this isn't part of the experiment." But John was already convinced it was. Also Sherlock was lying a bit, but only because he was already upset and wouldn't have listened to the logical explanation until calming anyway.
"Just let me-"
Especially the way that he now gravitated to John's room when the boredom was beginning to be too much. There hadn't been a case in days, the heatwave stagnating even the criminals it seemed. Also it was the fact that when John
it?" he asked walking around to put the table between them. How did John read him that well without even being aware of it? The doctor sat in the chair there, his back to the landing door, and briefly eyed an experiment.
"Point taken," Sherlock apologised before giving John a coy look then baring his throat. It was somehow just the right thing, as John dug his teeth into it almost savagely, at the last minute pulling back enough to just suck hard. Sherlock's gutteral utterances only served to encourage him, though that was the only actual mark left. Although there was still no venture into the penetration bit, there was still plenty of involuntary swearing. Well, it was at first as far as Sherlock was concerned, but he found it urged John to higher passion and experimented with which words applied where in what voice seemed to do the most for his libido.
Mum had unfairly begged when she'd finally said something.
"A bit young, aren't they?" was all he could come up with after scrolling through a few, all of whom looked like virtual teen-agers to him. He leaned over to hand the computer back.
"I did a little experiment in university where I had applicants for a study I was doing on what ingesting certain things would do to the flavour, texture and smell of semen. So I had these blokes over to my dormitory room and-"
"How could you possibly know that?"
"Just what?" Sherlock was asking way too many simple questions. His head was a mess of tangled hopes and doubts and he was practically choking on his pounding heart. How could John not see everything? Sherlock was a blazing beacon of want and inadequacy. It was bordering on pathetic.
Except that he did. He wanted to so badly that he'd had to take up masturbation again for the first time since he was that broken-hearted sixteen year-old. He kept his self-imposed celibacy somewhat intact that way, even contemplating breaking it altogether by calling on the services of The Woman
"Because it was obviously the first time you felt safe enough to properly rest in a long time. Everyone in this house understands that. You're up now, however, and I'm told there's to be a grand spread for lunch. I'm sure you're hungry."
"Alright." Nothing else for it, then. "I want to be with you. For as long as you'll have me. I don't care about marriage or children or anything else you may want as long as I get to be yours and you get to be mine." John, blinked at him, apparently stunned. He took the silence as an opportunity to barrel on. "But I also know that I will repeatedly hurt and neglect you no matter how hard I try. I've wanted you
"I mean,
"Thank you." He kissed Sherlock, tempted to intensify it past reason, but was definitively removed from his face by a pair of strong hands on his shoulders.
"Will you please pick me up, Uncle Mycroft? I want to examine your tie more closer."
"Oh yes, loads of hair. No idea where it came from. I was told my maternal great, great grandmother and her siblings had a lot of it." As she went on, distracting herself with her genetic pondering, John quickly ordered more of the easier to clean plastic cloths to be put on the floor in front of the sofa as well as a clean sheet, an unused tablecloth, and some fresh bath towels that were to remain on hand.
Sherlock slipped down onto the floor, catty-corner to John, his back against the base of the bench. He thought twice, then pulled the cushion off the bench and pushed it underneath himself long ways. He indicated with a semi-slight head gesture that John was to sit facing him. Sherlock shed his suit jacket, leaving him only in the two hundred pound button up John sometimes wished he could pull off. Sherlock carefully got up to hang the jacket over a rather inconspicuous-looking pipe. John took off his own jacket and deep blue cardigan as well. It was his nicest blue gingham button up tonight.
‘Anthea, now’ His colleague aborted her movements instantly and retrieved her blackberry, typing one handed as she holstered her weapon once more.
Mrs Hudson, who had been brought a fresh cup of tea by Greg, addressed Mycroft,
Cocaine, you see, was a distraction, a comfort and that flash of adrenalin my system needed to work at its’ peak. For my deductions to come fast enough to prove useful and not simply cause me an unbearable migraine.
“I prefer my stories with a little more fact and a little less florish, Mr Mitrović.” Mycroft stated sharply.
Mycroft Holmes stands behind a heavy mahogany desk, observing the grounds below. All Greg can see is his back but he knows it’s him, the late afternoon sun makes his red hair shine and its all Greg can do not to lean out and run his fingers through it.
“Fuck me you smell good.”  John claps a hand over his mouth while Sherlock looks up in shock.
“Quite right, Mr Holmes., So, the beginning. Once upon a time…”
They're about to reach the veranda when Mr Holmes stops, John follows his example and inclines his head skyward, the stars are clearer than he’s used to, being in the centre of the UK’s capital has its drawbacks,
Hello friends!
‘John if you need anything call any of the numbers you have for me,’ Mycroft’s professional tone returned with the suit and not for the first time John wondered to what degree the pieces formed an armour for Mycroft, ‘Anthea can get me out of any calls and I can be here in less than twenty minutes. A pushchair is arriving in the morning and if you’re going to be leaving the house with her I’d really appreciate if you’d call me. Until all the people involved in with place she was being kept have been processed and the threat to her neutralised I want to have security aware of her at all times.’
All praise, cat gifs and pictures of Paul McGann to my beautiful Beta Ruby who helps me maintain some semblance of sanity and bolsters my poor grammatical knowledge and poor concentration with phrases like; 'You've said that word 20 times in this chapter alone, pick a new word.' Any mistakes that remain are my own and I humbly ask your forgiveness for them dear readers.
John scattered kisses across Mina’s head, losing himself for a moment in her steady breaths and the feel of her safe in his arms.
The annual Holmes winter party should be held next week and I wait with bated breath John to see what ridiculous sentiment filled speech my mother will give after my death. They raise money for drug awareness programs that still use the mantra ‘just say no’. I fear I do so often mock that lesson.
‘So then, I believe you had a story to share Mister Holmes.’ The lone voice interrupted the contemplations of the room’s other residents, Gregory Lestrade had removed one of the dust sheets from an armchair, John's he noticed and sat himself upon it crossing his ankles.
“It's for you.” John says simply.
“When you’re together.”
“Yes, this is him.” Mrs. Hudson pointed to the older man in the centre of the image. “What does he have to do with this Russian chap?”
‘John is there?’ He owed the man; he had once again been dragged into a farce of a situation. John Watson deserved some peace at least.
‘Why on earth would you’ John snorts derisively before responding,
“Who were the three?”
‘You know this isn’t a movie’ Tammy laughs while selecting the play option on the menu, John vaguely recognises the story arc title; Black Orchid. The familiar theme music pulls him in and John allows himself the luxury of curling up on the leather sofa to indulge what had once been his guilty pleasure, a secret love of Classic Doctor who hadn’t seemed like something that would go down well at university, he’d had to beg his mum to record them every Saturday so he could marathon them when he’d gone home on weekends. They’d started the revamped version while he’d been serving in the Army and he’d been surprised to learn there was less of a stigma to the show than he’d experienced while in his teens, he suspected that may have had more to do with Billie Piper being the companion than a particular love of time travel though.
“What did your husband tell you?”
‘Arnav’s on it sir, don’t worry, call in but don’t go in. Rest up, we’ll need to debrief tomorrow. The higher ups want to know what happened but you’ve been put on medical leave for at least today sir.’
‘As nice as that sounds Mister Holmes I’m afraid this isn’t a social call.'
The fifth year John doesn't find anything in his bedside table, although he does look. The 14th of February has become something of a second birthday to him but there's nothing and also nothing on the kitchen table when he goes downstairs for breakfast. Sherlock appears to still be asleep so John, feeling a little disappointed, makes a solitary breakfast and goes to work.
‘I’m not asking about your medical training, I’m asking about what experience you have caring for children, raising them, being a parent effectively. Just being a doctor isn’t enough, you need to know how to provide this child with a home Mr Watson.’
He called Sherlock's name and strained to try and look about the room without actually putting any part of himself in it. He called again, but still there was no answer, no movement, and no Sherlock, as far as he could see anyway. He was suddenly yanked through the door by the lapels of his jacket and barreled back against it, slamming it shut. His impulse to take immediate control of the situation was quelled with the introduction of a foreign yet welcome tongue into his mouth and hands that seemed to be simultaneously stripping off his jacket and undoing his shirt buttons. To be fair, he was no longer sure which hands belong to whom as the single goal seemed to be getting him naked and subsequently orgasming as soon as possible. Sherlock was murmuring things into his ears and mouth that were only filthy by implication and that extra grumble he seemed to have in his speaking voice whenever he was aroused. It usually followed his erection noise if he wasn't concentrating on controlling it, but now he allowed it to remain for the purpose of asking what took John so long, and reminding him that not only was he not wearing pants, but if it were up to him, neither one of them would wear them ever again if it wasn't for practicality's sake.
"It's all been sorted." John's heart jumped a bit as he looked up at the taller man incredulously.
"What exactly have you been telling her?" Mycroft asked incredulously as John began helping her change.
"John, please!"
?" John sat down hard on the sofa, staring at the dance of the warming fire. Of course Sherlock had hurt him, left him alone so long that it was now impossible to be able to get back to him, back to the way things were. He'd forgiven him long ago, knowing that, no matter what, Sherlock did what he did for good reason. The consulting detective was much more
"Do you want me to clean you up?" he asked almost indifferently. Almost.
"Just... no."
"We are scientifically unable to make a child together."
"Stop it!" John commanded in that tone that brooked no argument. He used it sparingly and only when he wanted to make sure he was heard. "Don't you think I would be able to get away if I wanted to?" Nevertheless, the guilt was overwhelming and Sherlock moved suddenly to plant himself in his chair in order to remain out of reach. It didn't exactly work when John came to him and kneeled in front of him. It wasn't helping either. Dawn was in full bloom, the light doing things to John's form Sherlock could hardly look at for the attraction it cultivated within him. Of course he could get away. His past was fraught with 'getting away.' From becoming a doctor to get away from poverty, to joining the military to get away from his broken family, to the hundreds of times they got away from nearly impossible situations, John was well-versed in 'getting away'. "You kissed me and held me and we both fell asleep. That's it. It was comfortable. I didn't count it as anything much because we all do strange stuff in our sleep. You didn't, I don't know, violate me or anything. You needed a bit of comfort that I was glad to provide. It... It only went as far as the kiss." Sherlock could only look at him at first, thinking as hard as he could about how to navigate this situation. Lestrade might know, but he was probably sleeping off a hangover if John was anything to go by, and he would be incredibly grouchy anyway when awakened at dawn, no matter the reason. "What... what did you think happened?"
"That I love you." It just came out. He tried to stare down at his mouth, confused with the confession, though he hadn't any idea when it was going to be said anyway.
"Yes, Sherlock, it would be fun."
"You seem a bit off, John." Sherlock stated, reading much further into the way John turned the medical journal pages. "Something the matter?"
"Well, you've said it yourself." John stopped altogether and he could have screamed for the sheer simple want of his kiss's return. "It's a chemical defect, an abnormality. Of course you also say that you're a sociopath, which we all know you're not, because, unlike other people, I actually do my research." John continued to hold his face the way he often did during these times, gently directing everything, as he planted another more chaste kiss on Sherlock's forehead, then leaned back on the sofa. "But you're right about the fact that actual proof of love is in the brain. Since there's no way to show this then I..." He knew that expression, the one that occurred when John was beginning to second guess something.
That first year John honestly doesn't notice the date when he accepts the poorly wrapped gift from Sherlock in passing. He just pockets the thing and doesn't open it until lunchtime.
If Mycroft Holmes could have painted one thing on the walls of the British Parliament it would have been; 'You will be judged by what you succeed at gentlemen, not by what you attempt', not because he was in anyway against grand gestures or significant social movements, in fact the brilliant man who had once said those words had brought about significant change for their country. It had made them one of the leading providers of welfare on the planet. However no politician was without flaws and no government was without faults; this time however he had found himself walking the thin line between careful acceptance and manipulation and the ever present chance he would snap and verbally abuse their so called political leaders. In fact he believed the political framework of this country had become so rotten he had found himself being forced to consider a coup d'état at least three times this morning. In his last scheduled meeting of the day he had been forced to retreat into his mind, focusing his intellect on the developing crisis in the Sudan before his assistant, known globally as Anthea, had saved his mind from the inane drudgery, handing him a note about a halestorm of nonsense developing in the China's British Embassy, he would normally have passed it off to one of his team but the idea of escaping the Prime Minister's company a half hour early filled him with a carefully controlled glee. He was now seated, nursing an espresso cup, tie loosened, on tenterhooks for the verbal beating he would be justified in giving The United Kingdom's Ambassador in China, the man was a weasel and Mycroft had been plagued by boredom for weeks.
‘Indeed, shall I show you to the library or are you happy out here for the time being?’
Everyone seems to have been touched by this retelling, Sherlock's mother reminded him so strongly of Sherlock that he had an urge to meet her he'd never have imagined before, as for the caring older woman, who swept in to provide love and devotion, he knew someone else like that, ‘Then it’s settled, I have a name for the latest Miss Holmes, Mina Louise Holmes.  One name for Holmes family tradition and one to represent the woman who blessed both me and Sherlock with love and sanctuary during our time together.’ John turned to the woman next to him; she’d been more of a mother to him over the past year  and a half than his own had been for the last ten. She’d meant the world to Sherlock and it was only right to honor her this way. The smile came easily to him even as he watched her dissolve into tears. From the looks the other occupants of the room were wearing he had made the right choice.
“Take the list to your lawyer; I know you already have one. Take it and just tell them what we’ve said. This is going to be sorted before the end of the year Denise.” He looked up at her now. “I won’t still be married to you by the start of the New Year, I will fight you and we both know I will win. Your lawyer will tell you the same thing, but you already know that. Take the list and the papers. Sign them when he tells you to.” He took the stiff cream coloured card out of his wallet and left it on the top of the stack. “This is my lawyer’s office. Have yours contact them when you’re ready to deal. I’m going to get my stuff and head to a hotel.”
‘I wasn’t aware she took naps at this time, I thought it was just in the morning?’ John nodded his head in agreement, she’d refused to go down earlier, she’d woken at three that morning and had refused to sleep alone since, she’d curled up on John’s chest as he’d read her a story in Sherlock’s bed but the second he’d moved to put her down she’d woken up.
*****
She’s clinging to the bars of her crib when he walks into the room; the blackout curtains are drawn so the room is bathed in the starlight her bee nightlight creates,
It’s buzzing through his brain and he can’t stop it. He’s lost a member of his team, another is gravely injured and he can’t do anything.  He stares at the cabinet and his mind goes blank. It changes into something full of violence rather than logic. There is something he can do.
John read the article over twice, barely checking the urge to tear it to pieces right there at the table before excusing himself to check in with his friend. There was a time when news like this would inevitably involve his and Sherlock’s names and more often than not their faces too. He remembered wondering how the national press could so flippantly talk about the officers putting their lives on the line everyday to combat the crimes of the country, but he supposed it was because the police weren’t honoured with the same respect as soldiers. No one wanting to admit that sometimes the streets of London could be even a portion as deadly of those in active warzones.
‘They’re not sudden though, are they? It’s like I told her; this has been coming for ages. She’s cheated on me for years; neither of us has been happy.’
John lifted his head from fixing the woman’s tea to look her over. She stood casually, enough but clutched what looked to be a newspaper clipping. ‘No Mrs. Hudson, no plans why?’
“I have no intention of signing until I have a lawyer look them over. I want to make sure our estate is divided in a way which represents my interests, our interests. Besides there’s no rush is there? I’ve been on you for one of these for years; I can wait a little longer.” She raised an eyebrow at him, “Unless there’s some special reason you’re all of a sudden so eager. Do tell, Greg, have you found yourself a little fuck toy? Is it Donovan? She’s enough of a slut to fuck you isn’t she?”
‘Ok, well I hope you’ll come, bye bye Mina’ she ducks her head and smiles at the little girl, John can’t see if Mina returns it but Tammy pulls upright and turns to renter her store.
“Now it’s pretty much him swooping in and saving me, dragging me off somewhere, an insanely intense snog followed by him saving me again, me staying in his house, more snogging and a slightly kinky hand-job. Me getting a divorce and now I’m living in his house, in his room, but he isn’t there. So you know, find a word for that and that’s the one we’ll go with.”  Greg stopped when he realised John was no longer beside him. Instead John was a foot behind him doubled over in mirth. “Oh come off it, John, it’s not that funny.”
"No, us! I never really had to explain it before. Most of the people I talk to either understand completely or don't ask. I mean, even you have to admit it's not the most normal situation."
"That's fine," Sherlock replied, just wanting to get this over with.
"You'll have your own rooms here of course. Mummy has had a room ready for Little Willa since she first heard of her existence. I'm sure Mummy and Father are already up there," he mentioned. Strangely, without a word, Sherlock gestured the direction in which John was to precede him out of the room. Once out, he took the lead and Greg began asking him questions one usually asks about a child in which they have an interest, especially with children of their own. John wasn't a pediatric specialist, but he'd sure treated enough children in the various war zones in order to qualify if he'd really wanted to retrain. Oddly enough, it took very little fear away from frantic two a.m. calls to hotlines as they were hardly ever in one place long enough to establish a regular pediatrician. Not to mention the fact that they were in hiding. A lucky side effect of his former military and university days was the fact that he had places around the world in which to hide out, doctors and lawyers and survivalists and everything in between to see to it she never missed a shot or wellness check-up regardless of knowing her only as 'John's Doe'. A play on a combination of the title of an unidentified man and a female deer.
"Good. Yeah. Fine. I'm good." It didn't sound promising. But for the persistent erection, Sherlock would have stopped. The kissing could be enough for now. Fortunately, Sherlock could briefly focus John's building tension in a different, more pleasurable direction by brushing the flat of his palm just once over the head of John's cock. His own throbbed sympathetically, but he had to get back to the task at hand.
John completely lost it as Sherlock looked as offended as he possibly could, which was saying something given how dramatic he was in general. He sputtered and stuttered and 'Well, I never'd in a most Mycroftian manner until it turned into blowing raspberries on the little girl's neck in retribution and she was as red faced with laughter as her Daddy was. John pretended the tears that emerged were solely from the laughter, and not the unbelievably touching scene of Sherlock playing with their baby.
"Right. I'll show you bride." Before he knew it, Sherlock was being lifted by his narrow waist. He was tossed easily onto the bed and kissed within an inch of his life. John soon found himself in a playful fight for dominance in which he equally challenged and pulled away, reminding Sherlock of his ability to take him down when and wherever it was necessary. When the passion got to a certain point, however, John was unsure of what to do and let Sherlock take control.
John did as he was told, finding several restraint items at which he merely lifted his eyebrows at this point. There was an iron ring bored into the wall just behind his headboard for research on bondage, specifically Kinbaku for a case. Which was exactly the wrong thing to think of at the time. He didn't much care to be dominated, but the idea of John taking control of him wasn't unwelcome. Sometimes he needed handling and the good doctor did it well when-
"Of age to drink," Sherlock said, a brief raised eyebrow seeming attached by a string to his shoulders, making them shallowly raise with it. John perused the ads much longer than he felt was warranted, tempted to take quite a few up on their offers, but many were so vapid under the surface, according to his now much more refined observational skills, that it would hardly be worth it. Several decades ago, perhaps, but even back then, he always had more severe crushes on the cleverer girls. Now, he hadn't the time to raise his partner along with any potential future offspring. He had enough of a time with Sherlock in the picture.
"You're infinitely more logical about my experiments than you let on." John shrugged at that. "You, Lestrade, and I hate to say, Mycroft have
a few yards away, Willa began her wriggling once more, Sherlock warning her to stop before she was dropped, though all involved knew it would never happen. The child complied only until she was being set down, little feet moving even before they touched the path leading up to the open front door in front of which stood an exquisite white-haired couple, both tall and exuding adoration as their pipe dream realized barreled toward them, calling out.
"Anything toxic in this?" John asked, cautiously sniffing the blender.
was the proud thought in the back of his mind.
"Friends protect people," he said, mirroring John's response at the time. With his eyes closed, John only felt his breath, hot against his own as their lips were slightly parted.
"Tell you what, luv?"
"No! No, no. I'll save that one for later. Still too sore a subject at the moment."
"Ah! You're home. It'll be ready in a moment. Sit down. The wine will have breathed enough by now. Pour me one, would you?" Before John could say anything else, the door shut and he was once again left slightly dumbfounded. He finally got around to hanging up his coat on the back of the door next to Sherlock's famous one and could do nothing else other than what he was told. Moments after setting the significantly lighter wine bottle down and taking a long draw from his glass, Sherlock opened the doors wide, then turned to retrieve a platter piled high with what looked like wild rice and sauced meats. A regular dinner plate on which naan was stacked was beside it. Despite the sting, it smelled delectable. Sherlock placed both in the center of the table, behaving as if this was just something they
The first time, they were holding each other so close that John didn't get the opportunity to see the magnificence that was an aroused Sherlock Holmes. It was very close to when he was just about to solve a locked room serial murder. In his face, at least. John hadn't any idea if this was what, in some measure, was going on with the rest of his body, the strawberries and cream skin, his scars, old and new, standing out further, his lean muscles taught, his chest expanding and contracting with his breath as he sat there on John, holding his eyes hostage... it was devastating.
"What? Why me?" Sherlock steeled himself with a deep breath and looked back into eyes as wide and deep as the ocean.
"He was going to have you killed. You, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson." John knew immediately, even after all this time, that 'he' was James Moriarty. "Unless he saw me die in shame, you would have been murdered. I... I couldn't let that happen."
"Sherlock, call Marceline over so she can still sit with us and Jess won't lose her place in the cue."
"Well, yeah." John was actually blushing. He found it adorable. Sherlock found that fact disturbing, but no more so than any other time he found him endearing. "How... would you kiss me if, you know, you were free to just express what you're feeling? Because I know the feeling part isn't actually the hard part. For you, it's the having to work so hard to cover it up that-"
"For the last time, Lestrade is my
He got back in there with long, slow thrusts this time, showering Sherlock with loving kisses, licks, and sweet words, releasing his hands so he could be held and stroked as well. Sherlock was truly apologetic in more ways than his words conveyed, continuing to accept john long after he himself had already orgasmed. When John was spent a second time, they cleaned each other and themselves up and gathered their clothing and appearances, putting all to rights. Of course Sherlock had to be Sherlock.
"We'll then join everyone for the coach ride to the campus tour and family picnic."
He whispered into John's ear again and, seamlessly, John informed their host that his Billy was bored and wanted to dance. He stood first, helping Sherlock out of his seat with a gentle hand and a promise that, by the end of the night, Jones' case would be closed. They would bill him later. John then allowed Sherlock to lead them to an optimum spot before giving over control again. It was a heady feeling, complete trust. He experienced it in fits and bursts and it was slowly becoming a problem. But, if Sherlock was on a diet, tonight would be his "cheat day" because he would drown himself in the confection that was letting John take over.
“Yeah, I mean you have to admit the Holmes brother would likely be called off-putting by some.”
Mycroft passed back the image of the three men for John’s attention. He studied them closely, focusing on the broadest man in the image.
“I don’t see why the hell that would happen Francis.”
This note is a little different from the others.
Nothing about them would appear to be significant would it John. The deductions I've made would make this couple appear mundane. As if they were characters in one of the day time programs you and Mrs Hudson favour during your periods of unemployment.
Greg’s never considered himself to be a selfish man, but sitting in the window of Mycroft’s library he realises he could easily become one. The man had sequestered him away in this room, promising to bring back wine and that they’d talk but it had been an hour and Mycroft was yet to reappear. The situation Greg’s sudden appearance in his office had interrupted still needed to be solved and Greg thought it was possible Mycroft had also needed some distance to sort through whatever was happening between them.
“Where was I, then.”
Mrs. Hudson gasped at the image. “I don’t believe it.”
‘Perhaps that is true, I have found myself more effected by sentiment since Mina has arrived,’ John thinks even admitting to this is a massive step for Mycroft, ‘John would you like me to cancel the dinner this evening, I assure you everyone would understand if  didn’t want to leave Mina.’ It was tempting, he’d already been nervous about leaving her alone with Mrs Hudson but he wanted Mina to have a relationship with at least one set of her grandparents, he doubted his mother would be enthusiastic once he informed her, as such he’d been avoiding the task for reasons he wouldn’t want to raise with Mycroft, not only that but John admitted to a degree of fascination in relation to the pair, the few conversations Sherlock had shared with John around the subject had created a mixed image, John wanted to know the reality of their personalities.
John thought about making the same excuses he always had; Sherlock needed him, he would only end up getting hurt and John would have to patch him up, John was a medical expert and that was helpful on murder cases. But no, if he was being honest then none of those were the real reason.
You always take the decision from me John, tilting my head up and meeting my eyes. You move forward as I do and our lips meet. It is slow to begin with, a gentle thing, the pair of us uncertain and surprised by the others participation. You draw back and realize I do not move away. You look in my eyes and finally see the depths of those feelings I have for you. That is the moment you smile. You smile at me and I smile back. You pull me on top of you, my narrow hips fitting within the cradle of your legs. I lay there shocked as I feel your erection beneath my own. You grin this time, that way you do when you catch me unawares and I can not have that John. So I rush forward crashing my lips against yours. My hands grab you, clench you to me, because now that I have you John I will not be letting go. I want you to be mine John just as I am yours. I want to hold your heart in my hand and know that you trust me not to break it.
Sherlock had already solved the case, but he damn sure was going to indulge this one time. Perhaps if he got a bit of it out of his system through the veil of their disguises, it would be easier for him to release all of the unwelcome thoughts into the ether, never to burden him again.
Sherlock counted quickly and, they did it exactly as instructed, John pulling his out, Sherlock, for some reason shoving pants and trousers down until they were around his calves, both rather nervously attempting to put the other at ease by voicing their comfort with the other having a good look before anything else got started. Sherlock's was like him, long and lean, the top much darker than the rest, a slightly above average length when flaccid, but the potential to grow, if the visual markers were anything to go by. John was a 'grower' too, but, flaccid, he'd seen he was the same length and width as his old friends erect, therefore becoming that much bigger. He looked his fill as Sherlock undid two more buttons on his shirt, then rested his hands on his slender thighs, peppered lightly with rather ginger-ish hairs.
"You got me there."
"What?"
and pulling his foot down so the server could set their drinks down. John handed her a twenty pound note and thoroughly ripped his attention from her to settle it back on Sherlock. Sherlock took a larger sip of his drink than he'd originally intended, as did John it seemed. John also tried a sip of Sherlock's, declaring it strangely delicious despite the odd ingredients. Just as Sherlock was reaching his breaking point, where he'd have to flee to the loo for a moment's respite from the animal attraction he was currently experiencing, owner Trevor Jones appeared, looking for all the world like a TV presenter with his crisply tailored bespoke suit(the only person in wearing one that Sherlock had seen), perfectly coiffed and manicured. Sherlock made a mental note to get the contact information of his tailor.
and there'd be nothing you could do."
"Only a few days ago," the boy replied, surname Lewis, going by his name badge. Sherlock had produced his phone from his dressing gown pocket and began searching for something. "They were saying that it wasn't doctor error but something was not quite right. She hasn't the money for a lawyer so I put off going into the service to work for one."
"We've no lube," John murmured through clenched teeth, convincing himself he was just playing along with the fantasy, but unable to not be his practical self at the moment.
"Seriously?" John's eyelids grew a bit heavy with playful chagrin.
"Would I be asking the likes of you if I wasn't?"
"It would have probably distracted you," he said simply.
"Women don't have penises, John," Sherlock snapped. "What did you do then?"
"Not a clue."
"I love you, John. Always have."
"Looks like. Of course, Mrs. Hudson will help with the least spicy one, and we can take some down to the Yard."
"Can't guarantee I'll answer but..."
He begged for him not to be dead. Prayed to whomever would listen, including Sherlock himself. John would giggle to himself sometimes, now that Sherlock was back, about how he'd react to being thus deified. It was even funnier that this well-known atheist was the sole reason for his believing there definitely was a God, and that the Almighty's favourite pastime was fucking with his creations like some sort of mediocre writer whose works you'd grab last minute before a long flight because the cover looked interesting enough.
"Oh. Well, ta."
He had actually considered telling John that he didn't have to return the favour yet, that all he'd wanted was his pleasure, but it would have seemed forced. Sherlock had wanted him just as badly, the whole thing exponentially worsened by how he looked coming for the first time as a result of what was being done. John didn't owe him, by any stretch of the imagination, but they were both willing and in their right minds, more or less, and so he'd allowed it to continue.
After a few minutes, Sherlock figured out John was still more concerned with hurting him as well as being so exposed. So he eliminated the obvious by letting John close his legs before pushing his face back home, roaming hands settling for a combination of stroking, fondling, and precise manipulation of John's nipples. He tasted divine, slaking a thirst Sherlock had no idea was so severe, a need for John's body to be willingly given over to him in pleasure. John was trying to keep his voice contained, almost comically surprised when it came out louder than intended. For the last of it, Sherlock pushed fingers into his mouth alternately, the sight of John taking them in without hesitation making him rut against John's rather smooth, trembling leg, the friction delicious with a combination of what was now proper sweat and pre-ejaculatory fluid.
"You tried everything, you said."
Proven when his phone rang. He must have done it immediately instead of waiting until a reasonable time(read: Sherlock was too busy to answer). Arsehole.
"Sherlock-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's stupid."
the man. It was the longest they'd ever gone since the start of this thing and he wasn't convinced Sherlock wasn't cheating, sneaking in whilst he slept in his own room, per the parameters of their 'break'. John had always been a vivid dreamer, but this was even over the top for him. During these 'dreams' his arms were immobilized, yet he strangely never felt threatened. It was almost as if he was swaddled by his blankets as opposed to bound, comfortable and safe. Then the kissing would begin, too long to be a series of chaste pecks, too short to be a proper snog. He would always wake up gasping, his erection tenting the covers, and the distinct feeling of someone else having been there. He knew Sherlock's smell by then and, now that he was constantly closer to him than ever before, it tended to linger. However, he didn't smell it in his room unless it was deliberate. They didn't sleep up there and the only other time the fragrance would be so very present was if John 'snuck' an article of the consulting detective's clothing to aid his fantasies during his alone time.
"I love you, Sherlock Holmes. William and Scott and all."
"How would you keep me from shooting down your throat?" That seemed to help. A lot. Sherlock laid back hard enough that, but for the thin, mat-like cushion he would have given himself a concussion.
"Show me." What was he even saying?
"Ruining your experiment. It was a perfect plan. It just... would have been better if it was just that."
Apologies.
"What?" John's attempts at wrapping his mind around everything being discussed were initially unsuccessful, another usual thing in the unusual task of speaking deeply with Sherlock, if he was honest with himself.
"But hear me out, John," Sherlock said before applying another body-melting kiss to his mouth. It was a terribly convincing counter, yet John again resisted, though by the skin of his teeth.
"But Lestrade-"
"Look, Sherlock, you know me. Better than anyone."
"Half noon." He bolted upright, clenching the covers in his fists.
"Looks like a speakeasy," John commented. Sherlock spent most of the cab ride over there trying to get himself under control, but then John would... say something and all of his hard work was dashed like so much delicate glass. In turn, Sherlock said nothing until they were at the top of the stairs.
"Are you trusting me, then?"
"I sincerely hope you all approve," was all John said before thrusting out their hands to the excitement of all. The three of them were hugged and kissed within an inch of their lives and lunch took several hours between the planning, discussion, and celebratory nips of champagne. An outing on which to gather materials was planned for the next day. Mummy apparently had many phone calls to make and, by nights end, they'd received dozens of congratulatory messages.
"Right," John almost whispered. "Do you, erm, have a go-to picture in your mind or have to be looking at something you find attractive?"
When they were
"Well. Alright then." John heard Mycroft's unspoken question, but God forbid he admit he didn't know something. He waited for the answer to be revealed, which it was in the next moment when John pulled the only thing that was hung up out of the closet. A tiny three piece skirt suit complete with tie.
"No," he said seriously, all traces of humor gone from his voice. He raised himself again to capture Sherlock's eyes. "You are good person. Whether or not you want to be."
"I knew what you meant." John wasn't sure, but the other man sounded extremely disappointed. Probably at how John was just like everyone else and let sentiment get in the way of everything he wanted to do. John would take on the villain role if it meant he could keep his best friend.
Goosebumps and more bloody tears dominated John's body, as the over-excited girl tried her level best to keep from wriggling in her Papa's lap but couldn't quite manage. It was a task to get her to wait for the helicopter to land properly before trying to jump out. They were a ways from the front door in terms of a toddler's legs and so they convinced her that Sherlock should carry her most of the way as his legs were longer and could get her there more quickly. She pouted, an expression so like her beloved Papa's they all had another laugh. Sherlock took steps John and Greg had to practically jog to keep up with. Mycroft took his time, giving the man with the bags some final instructions.
As if to cement his acquiescence, John took the lead, grabbing his hand and walking ahead of him toward his bed. John was taking him to bed. The thought was a bit staggering, but at least they were already there when they fell onto it. The fire had sufficiently warmed the area and he kissed John gently in the combined dim light of it and his bedside lamp. Sherlock undid John's jeans, gently tugging them off and leaving his pants for the moment. He also left the vest, determined to live out at least part of his fantasy of putting his mouth there, the side of his face, then his mouth again on John's now rather distended pants. It was so much better when John was erect. John wanting him was lovely to think about in the abstract, but this physical representation was almost more than Sherlock could wrap his mind around.
His concentration was broken by John marking his page with one of those ridiculous 'I believe in Sherlock Holmes' bookmarks and padding into the kitchen, his loose tartan pyjama bottoms falling over his feet and a small swath of over milked tea skin showing where his olive drab tee shirt was slightly rucked up from his sitting. Sherlock couldn't take his eyes off of it until it was thankfully adjusted. The consulting detective was seized with an idea and stood to immediately put it into play.
"I know it feels weird," John started, "with a child and all, but-" Sherlock quieted him with a soft kiss. Lingering long enough for them to put their arms securely around each other.
having a conversation about our sexual preferences, and since I can read yours from your browser history and past girlfriends, I have more knowledge of yours than you do of mine. Hence, you asking me. I'm only answering the question." And taking bloody forever doing so. However, John found he didn't mind the long route.
"Jealous?" John smirked jocularly, having to somehow get rid of the tiny seed of tension he felt at the bit of uncertainty regarding what may have been peeking out between the lines.
John used his whole body to, well, make love. That was what they were doing, wasn't it? Sherlock noted how John seemed to be everywhere at once, but not in an unpleasant way like those Sherlock had dealt with in the past, all grabbing hands and fumbling. No, John... blanketed Sherlock, no matter that he was underneath. It was as if Sherlock was a biscuit, dunked in John tea, absorbing him through every pore until he could no longer hold his integrity. It was almost literal as Sherlock emptied himself into John's mouth with embarrassingly few passes with his tongue.
"My bedroom is closest, but if you feel more comfortable-"
"As is knife-wielding John," said Sherlock. "Well, any weapon, really. Oh! I need to get you a sword!" Sherlock pulled out his phone to text furiously.
When he opened the door to his room, John was sat at the foot of the bed as instructed, tears wiped but the tracks still lingering, his mouth in a tight, line, determined not to cry(more)as he gripped the letter. Sherlock got down on both knees in front of him, so he could be as close as possible as he described the pure, bell-shaped white flower preserved indefinitely in the casing.
"I do my best with what I have."
"As you can see, he's fine," Lestrade stated. But not really, because he's just covering up what he's really feeling in this situation by being a complete twat, per usual. Seriously, Sherlock. You need to fix this. Immediately." With that, Lestrade grabbed something additional from off the tray, bid farewell to both of them, and departed.
"No." Yes. It was mostly internal, however. "But if you insist on hounding me about this and the eating thing then do what I say."
No pressure or anything.
"I may like-"
Especially now that he was re-positioning them so that he straddled Sherlock's lap in order to kiss him and... wash his hair. By the time John finished, Sherlock was fully hard again, this time stubbornly refusing to permit anything to be done about it. He washed John as well, finishing up by giving him another orgasm at which he was again surprised. Sherlock had always enjoyed that, and almost gave in to further caresses. But John was hungry, and when that happened, he often made him extra portions or ordered things only he liked to prompt him to eat. Not that this was the reason, because Sherlock could deny himself for days at a time in the pursuit of the truth. No, John annoyingly wanted to eat all the time and could get rather cranky if he wasn't fed and watered regularly. Well John could also deny himself as well if it was necessary. But, when it wasn't, John's body would betray him, breaking down piece by piece and Sherlock couldn't have that. He may have to wait to actually get the man physically inside of him, but he would not be idle in taking advantage of this new level of their relationship. He was positive it would even make him more amenable to his experiments.
"Well, it's a night club, isn't it? Part of what we had to do in the beginning of the training was be able to deploy despite the barriers of being impaired. So the lads... well there were a couple of ladies who could put most of them down without a second thought I knew..." John trailed off, recalling something pleasant for a moment and Sherlock barely repressed a sneer. "Anyways, we all went on an all-night bender. They dressed me for the occasion and... well it worked." John described the scene without batting an eye. Of course he did. He was the calmest in the face of danger, and there was real danger that Sherlock would explode with sudden realizations and panic over what to do with the information. John even stood differently. He wasn't the ever-present soldier at the moment, he was...
"Quite," Sherlock said, snapping a photo on his phone of John with the gift, overwhelmed expression unable to be erased despite the happy posed grin. "The only stipulation to my acquisition of it for you is that if it doesn't go to a direct descendant, officially adopted or otherwise, it goes either to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle museum, as he has a great interest in our family histories for whatever reason, or the National Museum of Scotland. By the way you
