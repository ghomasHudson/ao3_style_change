“Myc, I can't do this. I'm a sociopath, not a father!” He answered practically yelling, because he was having a panic attack. Jackson started crying, so Myc picked him up, and handed him to Sherlock.
On the other side of the door there were to now very shocked men.
“So a few weeks after Christmas break you'll be able to continue your three sports?” Picket asked
Sherlock looked at Irene and she told him, “Go to the room their having you stay in. I need some rest thank you for being here I'll see him tomorrow for an hour while he's here while he's here then I'll figure times out with you, maybe during games?”
"Yes! I'm sorry I didn't believe someone who was high almost all through eighth grade!" Molly said yelling at him.
“Yes, its better now.” Sherlock said lying yet no one noticed.
“We came for Christmas, made that promise to Mrs. Hudson, you know how she loves London. I also decided to show John around while we are here.” Sherlock says wrapping his free arm around John’s waist.
“I never liked my first name.”
“No T!” The boys shouted
“Well I know it's not to see you guys, and so do you Mycroft.”
John woke up the next day at the hospital, and was greeted the sight of Sherlock on the hospital bed feeding Jackson. “Mornin’ babe.” John said siting up to look straight at Sherlock and Jacks.
"World War 2." I muttered silently to myself yet everyone heard me.
“Yep, he doesn’t head back out until the sixteenth of January.” After the conversation Sherlock went back to his room to read the note. It just said that there was going to be a memorial service for his parents, on the twenty-ninth. John came into Sherlock’s, well their room, and found Sherlock playing with Jackson on the floor.
“Ok, sirs.” Both boys said.
“Alright, well, we all forgive you as long as it wasn't on purpose.” Sally said so no one could say anymore.
"Yeah!" Sherlock finally got out a full word.
"Oh John. John, John, John. Deductions. The way you look at him firstly, it's not hard to tell Mr. Watson. However, I have to make sure you are, how you say, good for him. Do you truly like my brother then, John?"
Finally got this chapter done. My plan is to have this part of the series done by Christmas Break, which for me is the 21st. Thanks for reading.
“Philip! I just put him to sleep!” Sherlock screamed at Anderson. While Sherlock continued screaming John got up went picked up Jackson, while Jim turnt up the t.v. to drown out Sherlock's yelling. John came back with Jackson all wrapped up and sat on the couch where Jim had moved so he didn't get diapers thrown at him.
“Or we could kiss again since Myc can't interrupt.” Will suggested.
“I know. I've been getting there because Uncle Jeremy and Kohen have dropped me off and picked me up. They will be in in a little bit. I've been going there a lot because I got a job there so I could support my son.” He said turning to Mycroft after Jackson was placed on his lap.
“Alright then let's get there.”
"Come on just one peck, or I could tell them our secret." Jim said
"Dating! Do I have to spell it out for you?"
“Yeah, Mycroft didn't believe us, so we just decided not to tell anyone.”
“Hey Will what's up?” John asked when he answered the phone and Sherlock could hear the boys in the background.
“I'm Philip Anderson” said the Brown haired guy.
“You're also the one with the most adorable smile!”
I walked over to two of the doors that were right next to each other. “This door, is the walk in closet. This one is the en suite. This door leads to the other room connected to this one. This room is way larger then most, but I thought am office type room would be good for you. It's about halve this size, so about the size of a normal master bed room. Finally the one across the room, well follow me I'll show you.” I said now walking across the room to the third room.
This chapter is brief about what happened on wensday and Thursday.
“Well I'll go talk to Will.”
“Ok.” He went to the en suite in his room. I heard the water running as he brushed his teeth. When I was done with the bedding I sat and waited for him. He came out shirtless and in his basketball lounge pants.
"Wait when did you two kiss and what's your secret?" Mycroft questioned.
"Fine I'm going to go pick up pizza." Sherlock informed them.
“About what?” Greg said before my sister could reply.
Sherlock snapped out of his his head and realized that Mycroft had disappeared on them. "Okay!" Sherlock said to John.
"Alright! Well let's get some pizza and talk to each other." John said showing the pizza.
“Ok then here let me burp him can you hold the bottle?”
“Fine but let's go see if they want to continue watching Doctor Who!”
“Yes, but why?”
“Yeah, maybe we'll have to beat that record next time!” He said kissing Will gently.
“That would be ok, right Will?” Liz said which dragged me completely out of my thoughts.
“Guys this is our roommate.” Greg said
"He is staying on campus. More specifically here. A bed will be moved into the the first bedroom, which I believe is Mr. Lestrades and Mr. Andersons. And Sherlock you will behave." Mr. Picket said
January seventh, the day after Sherlock turned sixteen. The boys had a soccer game against their greatest rivals, the Omaha Knights. Coach Morris and Coach Nicholas came to the boy’s suite at six am. “Sherlock are you ready for today? You don’t have to play if you don’t want to. You are still varsity.” Morris says.
"Great!"
“I'm Sherlock Holmes.” He said greeting them all
“Well we brought in the food from Mrs. Hudson, and yes Will you are actually going to eat you've barley eaten for a week.”
“Ok, good, We’ll see you four players in a hour.” With that the coaches left just as Irene, her parents, and John’s parents were coming up to the suite door.
They were unpacked by twelve so since the others were still “unpacking” they decided to go out on a lunch date.
"Yes, well, we'll see about that Mycroft, you're not smarter, you're older and more experienced, but that does not make you smarter." William said back to him.
“You're already, giving us more hope then the other families did.”
Me and GLkid2001 also decided that the sports seasons at the schools in the story's go all school year round. Which means before practice started they were probably scrimmaging teams.
“Yes, sir, I’m ready to play.” Sherlock says from where he is feeding Jackson on the couch.
"I won't, not now.”
" I just got two drinks, but I can't find Phil anywhere. You want one?" Jim asked his friend from younger years.
“My name is Jeremy.” And all of the sudden Sherlock turned around.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I'm John Watson, I'm the one rooming with you.” John extended a hand and shook Sherlocks
"Bloody Hell. I'll be where John is at." Sher said to his older brother.
"Ok so you are gay?" Molly asked talking to both her brother and Jim.
“Yeah Kohen.” Sherlock said and when he said Kohen, Jeremy and Kohen both smiled. “Also uncle Jeremy, and Kohen the answer to thanksgiving is yeah I would like to spend it with you guys.”
“Yeah, could you put him in it, it's hard to pick him up when I can barely stand?” Sherlock asked his brother, even though he was looking into his little boy's eyes.
When they got to the hospital the doctor said it was extacy,  and that they would be off of the high in about in hour.
“Ok!” He said slowly entering Sherlock as his boyfriend started gasping. Once John was fully in he realized something. “Um Sher did we lock the door?” He pulled out slowly went and locked the door then reinterred his boyfriend. And started kissing him anywhere he could and touching him anywhere and every where.
There’s a bit of movement from Allie now; she snuggles up against Moriarty’s side. Just like she used to do with me sometimes when she was scared after an episode of Doctor Who or something else on TV.
Well, there's chapter one. Comments are welcome. Let me know if you spot any errors or inconsistencies. Thanks!
An arm snaked down and wrapped itself around me, pulling me closer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyways, hope you liked it. I'm not sure if anyone's still reading at this point but who cares? Actually I do. I very much do.
The next, there was a flash and a bang and I was on the ground.
She hasn’t taken Moriarty down to kill him. She knows she’d never beat Moran, and he’d still have her at his mercy, still be able to carry out Moriarty’s twisted plans. She’s taken Moriarty down to give herself time. She’s done the math and knows her best chance to free Sherlock to stop Moriarty is to take herself out of the equation.
“And you’ve put me in a bad position. What am I supposed to do? First you run away, then you try to escape in a...more permanent manner. I can’t just let you think that’s okay, can I?”
Thanks!
Deep breath. In, out. Don’t panic. Don’t imagine. Just breathe.
As usual, if you noticed something...off, don't hesitate to leave a comment. Or just leave your thoughts. Or just let me know that you exist. IDK, I'm kinda desperate for feedback of any sort at this point...pathetic, right? I do appreciate those kudoses (what's the plural of kudos?) though, more than I deserve, that's for sure.
And Sherlock as if I were an illusion, as if I would disappear at the slightest provocation.
Breathe.
To his credit, he assessed the situation in only a few seconds. Me bleeding myself out, his boss lying on the floor. I tried to get as far away from him as possible, but I was already weakening from the blood loss, placebo or real.
“Should have fought back more.”
Sherlock was utterly fascinated by and immediately loved the latest addition to our little crime-solving family. She was eager to learn, he was eager to teach. I kept her away from cases for a while, but eventually she started solving ones she read in the papers, and when she began asking to come with and see the crime scenes, who could refuse? We all cared for her; even Mycroft begrudgingly fell into the role of doting uncle.
As usual, if there's anything wrong that you notice, please comment and let me know so I can fix it. This isn't beta read (clearly), so I like to think of you all as my beta readers. Thanks!
So...um...sorry.
Did I really want to spend the next twenty years as a mute plaything for a madman? Really want the world to be vulnerable to the very same because the few people who stood a chance of stopping him didn’t want me to get hurt?
I close my eyes and try to breathe.
Sherlock freezes at the touch and gives Mycroft a withering look. Mycroft, to his credit, doesn’t flinch, doesn’t shy away, but keeps on going.
But whatever he did, sitting there, stroking Allie like a cat, whatever he said, it always circled back around to how it was our fault.
“Rhetorical. I don’t need to know. It’s just a suggestion, and if you really were concerned about your safety, I’m sure Mr. Occupies-A-Minor-Position can do something about that.”
Buckle your seat belts, folks. Did you think I would just forget about some of those tags?
And just like that, we’re back in the game.
Sherlock is right, in a way. We are all the reason she’s gone, he must know that. Mycroft the backup, Greg the bodyguard, Sherlock the security camera, and me, the protective father who let his guard down for just one semi-normal night. He’s right, because if we hadn’t agreed, if we hadn’t done what the doctor suggested--
Sherlock’s shaking now, reaching for the computer.
‘You look like you’ve seen a ghost’, his friend chuckled, and then immediately became concerned, upon taking a good look at John. As the Prince was moving fast to the exit, people were perplexed, seeing him in such a state. He had no time for explanations (and even if he did, he wouldn’t have been able to give any) or apologies. He was making a scene, he knew it, but he couldn’t stay calm now.
‘Hello’, the blond man smiled at him, also a bit surprised by the boy’s entrance.
Some people from the flock were getting curious about his private place and he was quick to make them aware that it was
Since that night, Archie was often allowed to participate in Sherlock’s experiments or, at least, to take a closer look. Nothing seemed to escape his inquisitive brown eyes. He was a child, but he could be characterised as a capable child, as long as he found something interesting enough. Normally, Sherlock wouldn’t have given a child a second glance, but Archie wasn’t quite a regular one. Sherlock didn’t even mind his slight lisp that was more prominent when he started to jabber. He also didn’t mind answering his questions and explaining what was going on during his experiments, though sometimes the boy was content with just reading by the fire or listening to him playing the violin. One night, he asked Sherlock for a piece of paper, quill and ink so he could draw a map of their enclosed area with Sherlock’s help. The man felt himself childishly invested into the project, even though he did have a ‘map’ in his head. He explained how to draw a map properly and shared many things about their grounds, such as what the lake looked like from above, where the flock resided, where certain types of trees grew and where every major, and not so major, object was located. The map wasn’t very detailed or perfectly accurate (not to mention the fact that Archie wasn’t a professional artist), but it was still fun to digress from their usual activities like that.
He started running out of cocaine soon enough, but he still had enough of heroin, both legally and illegally produced. They were so different, – cocaine and heroin, but he craved both. It was all so easy, so familiar. He felt in control, he felt relaxed, happier. His days were running smoothly, he was his own person, and it was he and he alone who decided what he needed, what he could and couldn’t do. It was such a relief to be on drugs all the time now. As long as he had gear, things would be fine, but once he ran out of it, he would have to think of a way to obtain more. No, he wasn’t going to worry about it just yet.
But playing didn’t go well either, affected by mild, but persistent, tremor and general absence of inspiration, which simply wasn’t acceptable when you played anything composed by Tchaikovsky. It looked like Sherlock was having a particularly hateful day. His last fix had been administered only four hours and eighteen minutes earlier, but, already, the painful craving was returning; a little too soon even for him this time. He put the violin down and turned on his micro music system instead, loading the Swan Lake CD into it. If he couldn’t play it, he would just listen.
guest, as often as possible. Eventually, she just gave up on her attempts. It was clear that John was potentially interested in her, and he, undoubtedly, liked their conversations, especially if the topic was related to medicine, but he seemed more interested in spending time in the chapel. The Prince hardly ever interacted with the flock, to Sherlock’s relief. Whatever there could have been between John and Sarah, ended before it had even begun.
They started turning every night, at the exact same time, just like Sherlock had tentatively predicted they would after their second time of turning into humans and back into swans, becoming even more hopeful after Pierre had voiced the same thought back then, providing a nice second opinion. Sherlock went to the chapel every night, but was a little hesitant to use all the things he owned now just yet. They were just things, items, objects, but they meant so much after not having anything, and Sherlock still didn’t trust his hands not to drop and break something fragile. He was also slightly scared that one night he wouldn’t find the chest where he’d left it. He locked it every time and hid the key, so that only he alone knew where it was.
Things looked a little distorted on the edges, but, other than that, the picture was clear and he could hear all those people in the hall as well. Somehow, he could just concentrate his attention on any of them and hear what those particular people were talking about. They were having a small talk, joking, and they were, obviously, in good spirits, enjoying themselves, even when more serious topics were discussed. Sherlock couldn’t care less and his attention quickly shifted back to John, who, together with the regent, was greeting the guests in person, with some reluctance. It was unlikely they could notice it; Sherlock, however, could easily deduce it from several separate clues.
Mary was incredible; clever, easy-going, interesting, witty, not too young. John really had a great time dancing with her and talking to her. Their banter had increasingly lifted his spirits and he had long forgotten about any discomfort in his leg or shoulder, allowing himself to relax and have a good time. For more than an hour it was just the two of them, barely noticing anyone else around. If it wasn’t polite to direct his sole attention to just one guest, he couldn’t make himself care at the moment.
Whilst performing rescue breaths, he was pressing his fingers against the pulse point on Sherlock’s neck to avoid interrupting the whole process by doing it at any other time. At first, there was nothing at all, but then he managed to find a very weak, irregular pulse that in no way indicated that the heartbeat had been restored. It was better than nothing, though. Something insignificant was always better than nothing at all in cases like this. He continued as before: two rescue breaths, thirty chest compressions, two rescue breaths, thirty chest compressions… On more than a few occasions, he’d had to play by ear and improvise when a patient’s life depended on him, but this particular process had to be performed strictly according to rules.
A couple of years later, when Sherlock was thirty-five, the flock welcomed new members. It was unexpected, since Moriarty hadn’t brought anyone new for quite a long time, and here he’d brought, not one, but three new humans turned into swans for his damned collection. Answering the perplexed looks of his elder prisoners, he said that the flock needed some young blood, as the majority of them would be middle-aged soon and some, technically, already were. ‘Not that there’s anything wrong about it’, he quickly assured.
‘Fine’, Sherlock agreed.
While they didn’t really need food as humans, getting their primary and absolutely vital sustenance as swans, they did treat themselves to fish, mushrooms, berries and other safe, edible things they could find in the forest or in the lake. The food that swans ate wasn’t in any way delicious, so, as humans, they loved having some human food now and then, but, particularly, during holidays. Sherlock rarely took part in anything like that, but the flock members were always polite enough to ask. Archie didn’t like holidays either, however, sometimes he was interested in the food, so Sherlock went with him, knowing that the boy wouldn’t go otherwise.
I also want you to know that I've come to a decision to write
‘Your Majesty, Queen Martha’, he started, bowing to the regent. ‘I’ve made my choice, as was expected of me’.
Sherlock would’ve allowed him. He could even see some appeal in it. Perhaps, he wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it like many people did, but he’d have enjoyed John’s closeness, his warmth, his touch. He would’ve enjoyed the knowledge that John was able to take pleasure from him, that his ‘transport’ was desired and taken pleasure from. Sherlock, actually, couldn’t rule out having a very physical reaction to that sort of stimuli; it was obvious John was a giving lover. In addition, Sherlock’s feelings for him could’ve contributed to it.
‘I’m fine’, Sherlock assured, sitting up.
‘Oi! Shut it!’ Lestrade scowled. ‘Anyway, it’s not the end of the world. Many kings and queens take lovers after getting married’.
Sarah seemed particularly interested. When one night John was invited into the flock’s building and accepted the invitation, thinking it wasn’t polite to refuse, she even started flirting with him. It wasn’t a stupid flirt with eyelash-batting and lip-pursing; she actually engaged him in a conversation. What of physical expressions, all the humans turned into swans had the same common trait about them: when they were swans, to see what was in front of them clearly, they had to turn their heads to the side, at least a little bit, due to the placement of their eyes, and, in their human bodies, they sometimes did it purely out of habit, without meaning to. It could be mistaken for some sort of mild flirting. John, however, seemed used to it, because he’d seen both Sherlock and Archie doing it every now and then, so it didn’t affect him in any way. Sherlock felt ridiculous even thinking about anything like that. Yet, he made sure to stand between Sarah and
At first, nothing was happening. The sun was slowly moving towards the horizon, but its orange glow suddenly disappeared from the lake’s surface. There were some odd, distorted images on it instead, but then the work of sorcery bloomed into a large moving picture of a huge, rather impressive hall, full of very well dressed nobles and royals. There were a few surprised or mesmerised gasps from the members of the flock. Sherlock ignored them. It took him a few more moments to conclude that it was John’s castle, a nice piece of property here, in a foreign duchy, a foreign country. Sherlock had read an illustrated book about it, the book that John had brought him once, so he could recognise the castle’s great hall, which was also its throne room. It looked like what Sherlock was currently seeing was actually happening in the castle at this exact moment, at least from what he could see behind the windows of the hall.
‘Of course’, the Prince promised with a small smile.
There are several things I would like you to know about the story, this chapter in particular:
When the Queen asked him whether he was getting ready to the ball and how it was going, he just shrugged absent-mindedly and replied that everything was being prepared without him anyway and there was no point or need for his participation. She seemed a little upset by his reaction, not his words, as she knew he could be quite bad-tempered at times, but by his mood in general. Bill was a little worried as well, but he knew well enough when John shouldn’t be bothered, even with good intentions.
‘I might have heard some stories about your military adventures before’, she smiled with mild playfulness. ‘And your friend Bill Murray is currently entertaining some of your guests with more of such stories’. It was true. When John’s eyes managed to locate his friend’s ginger head, he saw him surrounded by some of the guests, eagerly listening to him telling them something. While John himself wasn’t a bad storyteller, Bill had his own theatrical and enthusiastic manner, especially when he was tipsy; as he was now.
Apparently, his state was very obvious, because that night John gave him concerned looks time and again.
He huffed with impatience, waiting for the music to start playing, and his annoyance was gone the moment the first composition started to fill the room. Satisfied with the volume level, he proceeded to prepare the new dose of gear and administered it, whilst making himself comfortable on the sofa. Maybe this time he was finally going to see the Mind Palace version of John again. He felt himself smiling, almost becoming one with the soft piece of furniture, letting his body relax and letting the music in. Only his fingers were twitching faintly for a while, as some sort of muscle memory of performing the currently playing piece on the violin. There was a, rapidly slipping away, part of his mind that knew that he’d overdosed this time. He could still hear the music, but it was becoming more and more distant now, even though it felt like it was inside him, saturating his very being.
‘Neither of us is good at this, so let’s not succumb to dramatics and make it even harder for the both of us. It’s time for me to leave. I won’t bore you with a farewell speech. Don’t forget what I told you about the chapel’. With that, Mycroft turned to leave. Sherlock had caught his pained expression. Mycroft was abandoning him… In panic Sherlock followed him, making loud, desperate calls.
Later, he saw the twin sisters as humans at the flock’s building. They looked identical and were even dressed in similar attires. Francesca and some other women were fussing over the girls. He couldn’t locate any young boy anywhere near them, though. When Pierre came with a brief visit to return a borrowed book (the one he'd been reading for the third time, because he'd already read everything Sherlock owned by now), Sherlock asked him about the boy, out of curiosity. The Frenchman said that the sullen child didn’t want to join them, but he was close by in the forest, watching them from afar and looking around, but he had been properly warned about the hounds. Everyone had apparently decided to give him some space; they had learned from the experience with Sherlock, both when he had been a child, just as young as the new boy, and now that he was an adult.
Alas, there was a good chance the insane genius had run out of miracles. John, however, wasn’t about to give up on him.
‘Sherlock’, he murmured, too busy scrutinising the person in front of him to care about pleasantries. The results of is deductions were quite unexpected.
‘Sherlock, are you all right? What is it?’ the Prince, finally, asked.
‘I’m sorry, Sherlock. I truly am’, she said with a sigh of regret.
What exactly Moriarty was doing and why he wanted the swans to see the ball was beyond Sherlock’s understanding. It couldn’t be good, though. Moriarty knew everything about John and Sherlock. Of course, he did. But what was he planning to do now? When the black swan turned his peripheral vision on him, the sorcerer noticed and made an impatient and petulant sound and a hand gesture that indicated that Sherlock should immediately turn back and keep watching, lest he missed something.
‘Oh, my boy, it’s wonderful!’ she chirped quietly so that as few people as possible could hear how excited she was. She got up with ease, uncharacteristically not even paying attention to her hip.
He didn’t think he’d grow any bigger. He thought that, as a black swan, he should have been slightly smaller than the mute swans in the flock, but they were roughly of the same size. It had been a relief to have his coat fully changed. The process hadn’t been pleasant at times, causing itch and irritation that made him want to pluck himself bald. He remembered a few days when it had been particularly frustrating and he had even injured himself slightly with his bill, before snapping at someone who had dared to ask him if he was all right. His coat barely caused him any trouble at all now, as long as he kept himself well-groomed and preened. He kept moulting annually, but it wasn’t that bad; he was used to it soon enough.
Throughout the years, now and then, he’d tried to dig again in two other places, with the same result. He had watched small animals and insects going and flying through the barrier, as if there wasn’t any. He’d estimated that the enclosed area was slightly more than two kilometres in diameter, but the borders made a rather rough circle, which made Sherlock’s measurements very approximate, not to mention that he didn’t have any instruments to make more accurate ones. The lake itself was almost half-circular, but with quite uneven edges. Its length, in its longest part, was about 950 metres, and its width, in the widest part, was slightly less than four hundred metres. The lake wasn’t situated at the very centre of the enclosed territory, rather, it was much closer to the south-east of it. He hadn’t had a chance to examine the entire barrier, of course, simply because it was too extensive. In addition, the exploration was risky. He had briefly seen the hounds from afar or just heard them approaching, as if appearing out of nowhere, making him fly away back to the lake in panic, and, it seemed, they always knew someone was at the ‘fence’ and where exactly the ‘trespasser’ was. Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to overcome his terror of them, even to some extent.
‘Yes, yes, I know, cygnets aren’t the best looking creatures, but it gets better’, Sherlock suddenly heard behind his back. He turned instantly, despite the clumsiness of this alien body. Moriarty was there, sitting on a large boulder and looking at him, mockingly apologetic. He couldn’t tell if the sorcerer had been there the whole time and the boy had failed to notice him before.
John followed when the swan started moving to the exit. His wide field of vision allowed him to see the following man without really turning his head, and he did feel like looking at John; there was a possibility of noticing things about him that his human eyes could’ve missed. The blond nearly ended up forgetting his crossbow, but, once he picked it up, he was quick to use the decorated leather strap attached to it, to put it on himself so that the crossbow was hanging against his back. Sherlock knew it wouldn’t have been used it to harm him, but he still appreciated John’s thoughtful gesture.
‘Do you think he’s still here?’ a female voice asked. He could recognise the voice as the one belonging to one of the members of the flock. For some reason, he just didn’t want anyone to enter this place, so he headed to the entrance to see why anybody from the flock would search for him. He was quite surprised to see that, instead of the swans, there were three people approaching: two women and one man. As they saw him, they stopped, looking just as surprised as he was. Their eyes shifted to his head, or rather his coronet, and he could see recognition in their eyes.
’, Moriarty murmured with a smirk. Sherlock’s heart was about to jump out of his chest at what he was hearing. ‘The Prince marries the liar and the sad swan has got needle tracks hidden underneath his feathers!’ he cackled. Sherlock was starting to hyperventilate, not sure if he had ever been more terrified of Moriarty. ‘Does something like… “Mind Palace” sound familiar to you?’ the sorcerer continued, ignoring Sherlock’s sorry state. He was circling him now, slowly and menacingly. ‘No? Doesn’t ring any bells at all? Oh, but it does, doesn’t it? But you’ve gone far too deep this time, Sherley! Where’s my clever boy?! There isn’t much fun when you’re so confused! Dull! Boring!’ he spat. Sherlock pressed his fingertips against his temples hard and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to make sense of Moriarty’s words. He knew they
He sat down on the floor at the sofa and touched his friend’s cold, smooth and impossibly pale face after checking his vital signs again, which he would have to continue doing as often as he could, until the help arrived.
It was fine. Just one night without John. While he visited most nights (almost every single night, as of late), some nights Sherlock spent without him. He convinced himself that tomorrow’s night wasn’t going to be any different.
‘You’re not going to die’, he replied resolutely (or naïvely).
‘You always are… Aren’t you?’ he almost whispered and closed his eyes, knowing what was going to follow. The bolt tore through his chest, and the pain exploded like white-hot splatters of molten metal and sharp glass shards. What followed was his endless fall backwards. No thoughts, no sounds. Just the fall, and the pain, and the tilting world, until he could only see tops of the enormously high trees and the night sky above them. And then, there was also Mary’s face, once he was on his back, defeated. She squatted down next to him. The crossbow was carelessly in her hand, against her knee and she was holding it as if it was a toy. He was shaking. He wanted to scream, but was unable to; in fact, he could barely breath and each laboured inhale and exhale only made the indescribable pain worse.
She believed that their new situation had something to do with the chapel itself being a sacred place and, by entering it, Sherlock had been blessed, and, by proxy, they all had been given some mercy for their sufferings. Sherlock rather thought it had something to do with Mycroft, but he couldn’t find any explanation. He knew that at least two swans from the flock had entered the chapel a long time ago, not to mention
The cygnet had, apparently, heard the other swans talking, so he was aware that he’d probably turn into a human for a few hours when the night came. But nobody was sure it would work the same way for the newcomers. Sherlock decided he’d find out later anyway before flying away to his chapel, as he usually did, not long before the transformation.
John woke up from a nightmare that involved dying soldiers and flying arrows, one of which had been sticking out of his shoulder. He massaged said shoulder that, fortunately, hadn’t had an arrow in it for a while now. He could tell it was still quite early, probably not even midnight yet. John was hoping to fall asleep again, but, evidently, it wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. Frustrated, he got dressed and decided to take a short walk, not wandering too far away from their small camp. He took his crossbow with him, just in case. Its weight on his back always felt right.
He couldn’t help thinking that, if their situation was different, they could’ve had plenty of adventures together; it could’ve been an interesting life. The world out there had a lot of mysteries they would’ve been able to enjoy solving together. Sherlock would’ve tried his best to provide all the thrill and danger John, obviously, loved.
Those who had been born and raised as villagers were quicker to adapt to the life of humans without many comforts. But the noblemen and noblewomen had also spent many years with nothing at all and with the bodies of swans. The villagers (as Sherlock kept calling them in his thoughts), however, were good at crafting things that could be useful. For example, they quickly wove a couple of baskets that made collecting of the wood for their fires more comfortable.
‘C-contractions?’ Sherlock felt like he was about to be violently ill. His whole body was shaking; he was feeling cold, slightly sweaty and feverish.
He hoped that maybe, someday, any day, something would change for the better, he’d be rescued or get a clue on how to escape, but nothing happened. Eventually, he stopped counting days and didn’t know how long he’d spent in this cursed place. Years passed, that much was clear. Winters were the worst, because Sherlock was freezing alone in his makeshift hideouts, away from the flock, too stubborn and anti-social to join the huddling fellow-sufferers. While swans weren’t particularly sensitive to cold, had relatively high body temperature, as well as oily skin and thick coats that helped them to withstand cold environments, including cold water, they still lost body heat through their feet, and winters weren’t pleasant at all. Moreover, Sherlock’s species (he would find out much later that he was different even here), was considered a southern hemisphere species, so, perhaps, he physically was less adapted to a very cold weather than mute or whooper swans. But, while he was so young, he wasn’t aware of that fact. Thankfully, the lake never froze, even though it should have, if things in this strange place were normal and natural, so the swans always had aquatic plants, at least the submerged ones, to eat when nothing else grew.
I tried to pull away with my last dregs of strength, tried to stop the contact, but he just held me there up against him until I stopped.
They were waiting for me there, on the doorstep.
Like hell it was fair. From the moment I woke up, Doctor Richmond had made no effort to hide his roaming stares. I knew what was going to happen here, and so did Moriarty. It seemed so out of place for him, so not his style, that I began to wonder how much he knew about my past. Probably everything. It would explain this particular torture.
Sorry I haven't uploaded the last few days, life's been a little weird lately, and is on course to get weirder...so I'll probably be inconsistent for a bit here, but ah well.
Sherlock was the most changed. More than me, even. He was haunted, it seemed. By the fact he was the reason I was kidnapped, by the fact he hadn’t solved it, by the fact he was so easily at his enemy’s mercy with me as leverage. He was as silent as I. We would often sit together in a room, not communicating, only appreciating each other's presence.
I wonder if Allie’s heart was really in it, if she had been drugged leading up to it, if the glass wasn’t as sharp as she’d calculated.
I twisted on the floor, grabbed his ankle, pulled him down with me. A blow to the head was all I had time for. Disorient him for a minute. Keep him quiet.
“Look at me, Allie.”
I felt around my neck and found that I had missed a rather crucial detail.
He’s typing furiously into his phone, finding this or sending that, when Mycroft gingerly places a hand on his shoulder. He’s seen this look, too, knows that this could work in the long run, could be harnessed, but if he has any common sense, he’s just as worried about the short term as I am.
Christ, why does it have to be me?
Back with Allie. I wonder what Moriarty's up to now? Enjoy!
I heard a toilet flush somewhere behind the door in the corner.
I wanted so desperately to run, to jump, to get away from the monster before me and the monster behind. I couldn’t do this, wouldn't do this. But his fingers flexed between my collar and skin, tightened the whole thing ever so slightly, enough to remind me just how little say I really had and how much worse this could all get. If it was happening one way or another, why would I take a likely whipping later along with this?
I opened my mouth to ask a question. Perhaps, “Why have you brought me here?” or “What exactly do you think you’re doing?” I really couldn’t say; in the shock that resulted from the lack of voice, it slipped my mind.
Welcome one and all to the demented product of a twisted mind. I'm not entirely sure where this is going, but hopefully somewhere interesting. Enjoy!
Allie should have been home hours ago. It’s morning now, and she’s been missing since last night. Should have texted, should have called, should have responded. Should have anything. It was all I could do to keep Sherlock from panicking, utterly and completely, and I’m only just hanging on myself. Maybe she’s with friends. Maybe her phone died. Maybe she’s okay after all.
I heard Sebastian move almost silently to one of the wardrobes and pull open a drawer. Of course.
On went the socks and a pair of slightly-too-big dress shoes. As I pulled on the coat, I moved to the window. Looked out.
Moriarty.
By all means, even if he did survive, he should have no resources, no backup. Three years of Sherlock dismantling his web. Three years where I only ever saw him every couple months, for a few minutes. His entire network can’t have been a ruse. It just can't have.
Sorry, that was a longer-than-intended break in uploading chapters. I'm trying to be more consistent (I actually have the next chapter pretty much written, probably gonna put it up tomorrow, it's a bit longer), but sometimes life just...lifes.
Finally the fear cut through the haze. Sebby, or most likely Sebastian, was almost to the bed. Moriary’s hands moved to the camera, and the red light turned on.
It made sense, of course, in a twisted sort of way. Want to keep me locked up and largely unsupervised? Desperate enough, and I might just break my thumb, dislocate something, snap my bones and be free.
(See the end of the chapter for

All I could do was sit there. I had made my decision. Manipulative, possessive lunatic over sadistic master torturer. I would probably regret it.
Not yet.
They kept me in the hospital for three days.
Mycroft walks over.
I have a general idea of the direction this is going, but if you have any suggestions or anything you'd like to see just leave a comment.
A ding from Sherlock’s phone and mine.
They must be so worried.
(See the end of the chapter for
No. I couldn't let myself think of that. Not on top of everything else going on.
On the tray there was piled a full english breakfast, complete with a steaming cup of tea. Also on the tray sat something akin to a smoothie, though the liquid was much thinner than typicaly. As he set the tray on Moriarty’s lap, unfolding the attached legs, Sebastian winked at me. I made my best effort at a defiant glare back.
“Why does she still have that collar on?” I move closer to the bed, concerned. She’s in a hospital gown, now, for which I am glad. Better than Moriarty’s clothes. But by the time Mycroft finds the right words, with an uncharacteristic pause, I know what he’ll say. Even though he didn’t discuss it with the doctor.
My eyes flew open on reflex, but I forced myself to stare at the bright red dot.
I saw Sherlock and John. They stood and stared, looks of disgust on their faces. They began to fade into a cloud of mist. I tried to call out to them, but my voice was as gone here as in the real world.
At the end of the bed, he reached down to the base of the left post and attached my right ankle cuff to a chain secured there. He repeated the process with my left foot and a chain to the right, so that I was stuck legs spread facing the head of the bed. My hands were pulled up and linked to a chain above me, looser than the other two, and he pushed my upper body forward until I was unbalanced and leaning over the mattress, entirely dependent on the chain holding my wrists. The cuffs dug into my skin, and I thought I felt the beginnings of cuts.
As usual, if there's anything I messed up, please let me know. Thanks!
In. Out. In. Out.
According to Mycroft, we know a great deal more than I would have supposed, but that’s hardly surprising.
With the help of a pen and paper and a few maps, I confirmed for Mycroft the location I had been kept at. When raided, it was found empty of people and traces of Moriarty’s whereabouts.
Mycroft consults the doctor again, in softer tones, then turns to inform us of what we just overheard.
Moran.
“Take it as an opportunity to do something normal. To not let this take over your life. What would you have done if things were different?”
And of course, there’s a picture.
At this point I've written a few chapters ahead, but nothing I'm too attached to if you have any suggestions. My point when I started that sentence was I'm just kinda pacing myself on posting for consistency reasons, but if anyone here prefers maximum content as soon as available to semi-steady smaller content parcels, then just speak up. This fic belongs to those who comment.
I was on the bed in the jet, and we were in the air. That much was unmistakable. When I saw Doctor Richmond sitting at the bar, I had to process for a moment, but it made sense. Of course that was something Moriarty would do. Of course he wasn’t safe.
I had been trapped earlier, but now it really sunk in. There would be no leaving unless someone came to get me, no escape unless a genius who fooled Sherlock for years slipped up.
He slumps against me suddenly, head on my shoulder, shaking in mostly silent tears. I’m nearly in tears now too, holding onto him, rubbing his back. We sit like that a bit, just the two of us, ignoring for a moment the screen.
“The doctor.” The words leave my mouth before the idea is fully formed. “What was his name?”
I almost immediately reached for the food. Certainly I couldn’t let Moriarty dictate even what I could eat and when to me. But Moriarty thought otherwise, it seemed, and snatched my wrist from the air.
“Good,” hissed Moriary, and he shoved me backwards with enough force to propel me off the bed and onto the floor.
“Shall I turn on the camera?”
The scent of food was too much. I finally opened my eyes to see that Sebastian was the one carrying the tray, and I flinched reflexively before stopping myself. It was a little concerning, how quickly Moriarty was able to give me a negative association with this man. Undoubtedly he hoped to set up a positive one with himself at a later point, and was likely already laying the groundwork. Just one more thing to look out for.
I could feel myself being hauled up. No way I could resist. I was half-carried, half-dragged out the back, shoved rudely into a vehicle, still stunned and dizzy.
Enjoy!
So that's where he was going with this. I tried not to react when the pieces fell into place.
I removed the hook of the padlock from the loop in my collar. When I tried to stand up, it was on weak legs. Walking to the bathroom had been no issue with Moriarty on hand; now I was alone.
I only made it halfway to them before I collapsed with a silent sob.
My eyelids began to grow heavy. Realizing I had been drugged sent a jolt of energy through me, and I almost broke free of his arms. Almost.
It was during one of these check-ins he suggested it.
I smiled. It was a dreadful attempt at humor, really, but the reference to Mycroft’s practical tag line was unmistakable.
“Please Allie, don’t, there’s another way, we’ll get you, Allie…”
Like all things to do with Moriarty, this was not going to end well.
A button is pressed and all the cameras are back and vivid, with sharp edges and bright colors.
Looking quite pleased with himself as I sat there, gasping like a fish, still quite able to breathe but completely incapable of speech, Moriary spoke up in a sing-song tone.
I had to be strong. Couldn’t show my fear. If I was here for any reason, then it would be to manipulate or punish my adoptive parents. They would be panicking; I would have to endure, keep them as calm as possible. Stay as strong as possible. For Sherlock and John.
And that scared me.
Now he whispers something in her ear, and she nods shakily.
When I came to, I was in the bed again, tucked under the covers. I sat up the instant I remembered what was happening, and quickly regretted the fast movement. Black spots danced before my eyes.
In. Out. In. Out.
I barely left my room.
At least I was sure there was no one else in the room, even though the cameras were still on.
“And of course, me. You hit me, Allie.”
“Come on now, no reason to be skittish.”
Then he’ll come back and talk some more.
Allie is finally back.
The timing of the sunset in the footage showed the room was probably in London or the surrounding area. The expensive tastes of the room as well as the presence of Moriarty’s clothing in the wardrobes revealed the room to be his. This increased the likelihood of it being near if not in London, though a location on the outskirts was favored as the fireplace in the style present was highly unusual to be found on the upper floors of a building, and due to the lack of interference with the sunlight the room had to be either near the top of a tall building in the densely-packed central areas of London or on the lower floors of a building somewhere a bit more spread-out.
John was gentler, too, like I might break. He was there when I cried; comforted me as I tried to scream, still silent. No surgery for a month and a half yet.
The door was unlocked, of course. I stepped out into a long, carpeted hallway.
When she stepped out of that cab, even though I knew it would be her, even though I had watched in silence as she escaped, watched her progress through the busy streets of London, it was surreal to see her there. I guess it wasn’t a trap after all, but it sure as hell still doesn’t make any sense.
Soon we were on the jet. Its interior was plush, reflecting Moriarty’s expensive tastes. More of a living room than a cabin. The bed near the back did not bode well for me. Then again, nothing boded well for me in the hands of Moriarty.
There’s no evidence that she’s been taken anyway. Mycroft hasn’t found anything yet, which means this could go either way.
“Why don’t you take the opportunity to get out of the flat? I know I’m only aware of some of the details leading up to you requiring a hospital visit, and I'm no psychiatrist, but I know it can't be good for you to stay in here forever.”
“She’s fine. Asleep, but fine. We can see her now.”
The sight of a plane’s interior makes my blood run cold. It makes sense, yes, in fact it was expected, but this just got a whole lot harder. Nobody’s there yet, so the airfield is probably some significant distance away from the pub, with no way for a non-genius to tell exactly where. That doesn’t stop Mycroft from getting on the phone, from ordering a search of some sort, from ordering a watch on all international flights, from ordering this and that.
Not that all the security in the world would have helped, in the end.
So the more permanent changes in them were obvious.
John, of course. He didn't like the idea of the hospital looking over his shoulder, or anyone else for that matter. Still, that was the end of of the check-in that day.
The computer nearly died once. When I stood up to get the charging cable, Sherlock caught my wrist. Gently, I pried his fingers off, but when I came back he grabbed my hand in his and hasn’t yet let go.
Aaaaaand we're back to John and present tense. Oh joy. This chapter should be interesting, we'll see. I did some minor editing to the last chapter, nothing too important, but if you want to reread feel free. Enjoy!
With frantic hands, I pulled her to me. She flinched, but only reflexively, I thought. She seemed disgusted with herself, underneath the tears streaming down her face.
Far, far worse.
It was then that Moran arrived.
It’s the back of a car, what kind, I’m not sure, but Mycroft and Sherlock can probably tell. It’s Allie, all right, tears in her eyes, shielding herself with her arms as Moran reaches toward her.
Then Moriarty speaks and she realizes this is not quite 221B the morning after visions of weeping angels brought her downstairs in the middle of the night.
Sherlock eventually removed his head from my shoulder, face red and puffy, and has stared determinedly at the live feed on the computer in the hours since.
Oh yes, it was suspicious. Why on earth would Moriarty leave it like that? But I pushed those thoughts away. Who knows what went on while I was asleep? Who cares that he isn’t here, like he always is? He has to consult with his clients sometimes, after all.
I picked up the sharpest piece I saw and sliced my wrists just below the shackles Moriarty had welded onto me.
Sherlock makes a low groaning sound, a sound of despair, and my eyes snap back open. I glance at the screen, nothing new there, and turn to Sherlock. Still as a statue, barely even breathing. I gently lift his hand from where it’s resting on his lap, take it in mine. I trace small circles on the back of it, and he seems to relax slightly.
“I would have left you alone, you know. You just had such a...reputation.”
“I know you’re awake, silly.”
“You only had to be a little more careful, and you would never have been in the right place to take you.”
“I know...”
We’d talked late into the night, or rather Mycroft did, once I got him started. Occasionally Sherlock would say something, usually under his breath, but as harsh as it sounds, he seemed slowed down by his attachment. Every so often, Mycroft would suggest an action and Greg would speak up, confirming his ability to do something or the other. I’m not sure how useful this was to Mycroft, considering his superior influence and likely knowledge of every asset at Greg’s disposal, but it seemed to help him feel like a useful part of the group, so Mycroft let him continue.
While he walked the long way around the bed, smiling that eerie grin of his, I only lay there, tracking him with my eyes until he was out of my range of vision.
Oh, he still hinted at our guilt. Still tried to plant seeds of resentment. Still whispered, “Surely, with all their resources, if they were really trying they could have gotten you back by now.”
Goodbye, Sherlock. Goodbye, John.
I'm sorry if at any point, in this chapter or any other, anyone feels a bit...out of character. In some cases, there will be more information forthcoming that will explain the difference. In some cases, I just messed up.
I studied my work. Pulled a coat and pair of socks from the pile for good measure. Then I retrieved the matches and lit the whole thing up.
It was because of that suggestion, that idea, that on my birthday we all went out for drinks. I liked the thought of doing something normal. Mycroft provided the security, of course, for the five of us to go to a nearby pub and celebrate a bit.
Most of the time, I felt safe enough in Baker Street. The hospital was where I felt most vulnerable. For weeks after I was discharged, I didn’t leave the flat.
I'd love to hear what you guys think about the direction I'm taking the characters. Too OOC? It's a fanfic and you don't care? Love it? Hate it? IDK, I'll take any feedback.
Almost, until I remembered exactly who this monster was.
But more often, he planted the seeds of self-doubt. Of self-hate.
Bracing myself and holding the comforter around me, I turned and sat up. The room was truly ornate, and dominated by the king-sized four poster I was sitting on. Massive double doors leading out, three windows on what I guessed to be the east wall, massive wardrobes on either side of a delicately carve fireplace opposite, and a single door in the corner, most likely leading to the bathroom.
Get ready for some MAJOR EVENTS next chapter. Yay! (Yay?)
“Sherlock. I know you want to help Allie, but-”
Of course.
“Richmond, I think.” And he’s on the scent too. We’re all thinking the same thing, for once, the geniuses and the goldfish, I think I once heard Sherlock say.
What my observations were telling me was that Moriarty was not nearly as emotionless as he seemed on the surface.
With the mist came voices.
Sebastian reached the bed.
From there it gets a bit more complicated. The surest fact past a general probable range of location was the identity of the blond. Sebastian Moran, accomplished marksman, ex-army colonel. Until recently, a somewhat prominent figure in the London underworld. Apparent second to Moriarty.
And just like he wants, Allie kisses him, and he stares into one of the cameras the whole time.
But once the ideas were there, you could see them take root. See them grow.
She looks so young, asleep. She is young. But her face is relaxed, and she seems calm.
Well, well, well. Still not over.
They were all in and out of the flat constantly, checking in, saying hello, but there was hardly a moment where I was without Sherlock or John.
“He must have links-”
He morphed into Sebastian, and cracked the whip at me.
Moran drops her and raises the stairs, then disappears into the cockpit. Moriarty stands there, towering over Allie, and Sherlock must see something before the rest of us because he nearly shouts before she has even begun to move.
“Why don’t we let him decide? That sounds fair, doesn’t it?”
I had risked everything and fallen short.
Finally, he came up for air, breath hot against my face. I kept my eyes closed. I didn't want to look at him, didn't want to look at the cameras. My mouth, I was certain, must be swollen; my face, red.
It’s not like I could have gotten away if I wanted to. One of Moriarty’s hands was pressing into my skull, the other gripping at the collar that wouldn’t let me get more than ten feet away from him. For the moment, I was at his mercy. I was finding myself at his mercy more often than I liked.
As per usual, just comment with anything wrong you've spotted. Thank you!
I checked for cameras as discretely as possible. I could see two without moving my head, both blinking.
“No! Allie don’t!” As if she can hear him, as if it’s her cue, Allie pulls Moriarty down to the floor with her and dazes him with a blow to the head. I would feel happy, feel elated, if it weren't for the despair in Sherlock’s voice.
By the door stood Moriarty himself, and beside him a tall, muscled man. More than a random follower, obviously, but I couldn’t place him. Between the two, a camera on a tripod; off for now.
How could I have messed it up? How could I have failed?
In Moriarty’s hands, I was as good as dead. Why drag it out at the cost of a city, a nation, the world? At the cost of my family?
“Your protection. Your people. Your security. And now she’s gone. If you hadn’t told her that she‘d be safe, she would never have left the flat!” His voice is rising now, each word tinged with the hiss of accusation.
It was real this time, not like at St Bart’s’ (John would’ve been a liar if he said he was no longer angry about it). It was more like back when Mary had shot Sherlock, only then John had felt significantly more helpless. While there was neither medical equipment at hand, nor necessary medications now, just like back then, he could actually do something this time; he was in charge and he couldn’t, wouldn’t, let Sherlock go.
There had been no mysteries to solve, except for the one he’d failed to solve… Once he had been physically capable of flying, he had inspected the barrier, both above the area (oh, how he hated to be that high above the ground! His heart had been in his throat the whole time, until he'd finally landed) and at its borders. He had deduced that it had a shape of a deformed and upturned bowl covering the area. He had even tried to dig a tunnel under its border, but that hadn’t worked either: the barrier went down into the ground and he couldn’t tell how deep it was, as he had very limited physical abilities to dig deep enough. He’d kept trying until he exhausted himself, he’d come back the next day and the day after that, even though his body had been sore and his feet painfully abraded, but, no matter how deep he’d dug, the barrier seemed endless.
When the dark, oversized owl started to descend, Sherlock’s heartbeat sped up in a new bout of fear. He was scared of the unknown, not having the slightest idea of what was going to happen and whether he’d be able to get himself out of this alive. The area was an ancient woodland and there was nothing helpful Sherlock had managed to spot so far. The bird lowered him onto the ground with surprising care (even that felt like the bird was somehow mocking him again in its own way). The boy’s tired, cold, aching body would not allow him to get up fast and try to run away, and, even if he could, he knew it wouldn’t have done him any good, at any rate.
(See the end of the chapter for
It had not been a pleasant adventure, no. It hadn’t taken long for the drugs to become a part of his life again. Later, he’d even managed to fool Mycroft after all that time he had not been using. During his captivity in Serbia, the drugs had had enough time to leave his system before Mycroft had come to rescue him, so his medics hadn’t found anything drug-related, and there had been more important health issues to pay attention to, including kidney and middle-ear infections.
‘If you want us to’, Sherlock replied quietly, never meeting the stormy-blue eyes with his own. It had become a habit, but he wasn’t sure he could trust himself with looking John in the eye without breaking down completely.
‘Come on, Sherlock. Your brother is back and hungry after his journey’, Mummy called again, and he could finally see her. She looked a bit odd in her clothes that were, nonetheless, rich and beautiful. He was wondering why he had expected her to look older. Still, it was Mummy and he was glad to see her.
‘Is it like this every time?’
Pierre, as it turned out, had noted the time between their transformations and shared his observations with everyone else. According to his calculations, they had spent about four hours in their human forms during both nights. And this second time, they had turned into humans roughly at the exact time as the first time when Sherlock had entered the chapel. Sherlock expressed his praise that at least someone from the flock deigned to use his human mind, instead of showing preference to a bird brain. It earned him a few glares, but everyone was used to Sherlock not being the nicest or most tactful of people. Pierre ignored them all, wondering aloud if it would always be like this for them now. Sherlock, in turn, kept his musings to himself, wondering if he and others would’ve had more time as humans if he had entered that chapel sooner after the sunset, as Mycroft had told him to. Maybe that would’ve given him a few extra hours in the body he was born with… Oh, but it was too late for regrets and they were pointless now. He felt a bit exhausted, both because of the transformations and because of running away from the hounds earlier, so he decided to get some sleep, despite the fact that he could still hear a rather serious commotion and racket, coming from the monstrous creatures. He had to convince and assure himself that they weren’t as close as they sounded tonight; they were simply noisier.
Sherlock stood up and turned away; it was easier like that. As soon as he opened his mouth after about a minute of silence and a shaky inhalation, he started from the day he had been kidnapped and torn away from his family, and couldn’t stop, until he told the whole story, or, at least, most of it. He was never once interrupted. A sceptic like John could’ve been less patient with him, but he was quiet the whole time. When Sherlock turned back to him and sat back down, he risked looking at the man’s face. What he could see was thoughtfulness, compassion, a small amount of fascination and disbelief. The latter was a perfectly normal reaction to a story like this, so Sherlock wasn’t going to hold it against him.
He was a human again…
‘If you’re worried about your swan, I wasn’t going to hurt it either; I just… thought it was unusual and beautiful, and wanted to take a closer look at it’. Even with the lack of light, Sherlock could see and hear sincerity coming from the stranger. He preened a bit at being called unusual and beautiful; preened figuratively, of course, not in a swan’s manner. He inwardly huffed at his own reaction. Wasn’t he pathetic?
And, yes, Sherlock had finally started conducting some experiments with what little resources he could get. It felt great to be able to use that glassware and tools. He did it all on the altar that, in fact, made a great table. Thankfully, Jeanne-Victoire never said anything about it, whatever she might think about it. He was too easy to wind up when it came to his space. Probably because of how unwelcome she felt, her visits had gradually become much less frequent.
‘Our Prince John is a romantic’, Bill smiled with mock coquettishness. ‘He would prefer to marry for love’.
‘Ask away’, he sighed. Apparently, it was the permission John had been eagerly awaiting.
‘Yes’, John confirmed with a small smile, probably thinking that Sherlock was deducing again. He both was and wasn’t. He just
‘Mycroft! Mycroft! Mycroft!!!’ he kept screaming in terror. His brother couldn’t leave him like this! He just couldn’t!
Sherlock couldn’t believe he had got himself into a trouble like this; he also couldn’t believe that his curiosity had nearly got him killed or crippled again. At least, the hunter had killed the hound that could have ended Sherlock’s life or disabled him, this time for good. He could feel he was starting to change. Soon, others were going to come to their own building nearby, and there was a chance they would encounter the man. He worried about Archie. What if the man was evil? No, he hadn’t looked like that. But there were so many ways some sort of misunderstanding could create a bad situation. Sherlock was both intrigued and nervous. Maybe the man would just go away? If it wasn’t for the other swans, Sherlock would’ve just changed, hidden in here, and avoided starting the fire tonight, so it wouldn’t be visible in the dark and attract attention. He would’ve stayed quiet and waited for this unusual night to pass. But others weren’t going to be quiet, as they weren’t even aware of the situation. He had no more time as a swan to fly to the lake and warn them. At the same time, once he changed and fully regained his senses, he could, possibly, go and talk to that stranger, if he hadn’t yet left the area.
‘Believe me, my willingness isn’t an issue here’, she said, looking him in the eye sincerely. It wasn’t very good being seen whispering to each other like this when he was supposed to be making an announcement. Mary seemed unsure of his intentions and he really wanted to assure her. Things weren’t going very smoothly and they had already broken a lot of protocols, of course.
‘As I’ve mentioned, my brother is a very influential person. If anything could be done, he would have done it a long time ago’. From time to time, Sherlock couldn’t help doubting it, but it was his petulant, abandoned part speaking, ignoring the facts. He
Bill was quick to invite everyone to go to the nearest village that evening, where the commoners were going to celebrate the summer solstice. Mike and Lestrade declined the invitation, but John was unsure. He was a people person. Back at home, the commoners were always happy to see him, but he wasn’t sure about the locals. Bill assured him that nobody would mind. Apparently, he had already visited the village before and he really felt like carousing tonight. In the end, John agreed to go with him. The Prince ordered the servants to gather some food and drinks, because coming empty-handed just would be extremely impolite, in his opinion.
‘If you don’t want me to watch you changing, I could go take a walk’, the guest suggested. Sherlock hoped that his next croon sounded like a negative answer. He wasn’t, indeed, very comfortable with it, but he was even less comfortable with John leaving, even if it was just for a while. He took time looking around and deducing John. Even though it didn’t matter any longer, he was thoughtful enough to, once more, leave the crossbow at the entrance. It was resting against the wall, this time together with the quiver full of bolts. Obviously, John’s way here had been safe and he hadn’t encountered any danger, which both was and wasn’t good, because Sherlock knew that the man was only happy to have at least a brief, dangerous adventure. John’s, more or less simple, but still good quality clothes were making it clear that the man hadn’t wanted to attract much of attention on his way here. The colours were all dark or neutral and there were barely any decorations. He, actually, preferred it to attires that identified him as a royal person. He felt more relaxed like this. The night earlier he hadn’t been wearing anything regal or particularly decorated either. He had been on a hunt, after all. Yet, good, but simpler clothes, obviously, felt more like a second skin to him.
‘But that’s just fucking, and we’re talking about marriage here’, Bill countered.
‘Fine’, the younger man agreed quietly, trying his best to smother any sort of hope before it had grown roots. John wasn’t stupid. He knew not to pester Sherlock with more questions the swan was ready to answer. It was a delicate topic. Sherlock was prone to using many unflattering words during those rare times he talked about his brother, but John could definitely see that there was more to it.
‘I wish I could take you with me’.
However, what his eyes saw next, on the coffee table, made his heart fall. A spoon, an extinguished tea light, a small, nearly empty package of citric acid powder (to dissolve heroin, of course)… That was enough to realise what was going on. Immediately after that, his eyes found Sherlock lying on the sofa, looking both ethereal and simply deathly pale, and, most likely, unconscious. John was next to him in a moment, trying to shake him awake, which didn’t work. Only being this close, he noticed a glass syringe between Sherlock’s arm and the back of the sofa. The sleeve of his dressing gown was still rolled up and a rubber tourniquet was loose halfway around the man’s upper arm.
He’d stared using again during his time away. Sometimes he’d been in need of stimulants to keep going, sometimes, but not very often, he’d required painkillers, if things had gone seriously wrong. When he’d started his mission, he’d preferred to see it as an adventure; the Work had always been his motivator, kept him interested and excited. But that wasn’t the same. It had been at first, or at least it had appeared so, but it hadn’t lasted.
And thus, deep inside, he was torn, despite the fact that everything had already been decided. Perhaps, he’d be able to come to Bavaria every year and see Sherlock. Would those occasional visits be fair to the both of them and their friendship at all? There were so many things separating them. Sherlock, of course, was aware that John would have to leave at some point, but they avoided talking about it. The avoidance of the topic was mutual. Leaving was going to be tremendously hard, but he was determined to do anything in his power to help Sherlock in any way possible, even if it wasn’t going to be much in the end.
As it turned out, the entire flock had changed back into humans the moment Sherlock had. Once they were back at the lake, Sherlock could see all of them there, in their true bodies they had been born with. But, just like in Sherlock’s case, there were some extras to it. They all wore obviously expensive clothes and shoes; they had their hair carefully arranged and even had a bit of some artificial rouge on their faces that varied from very pale to light-beige. Some men wore berets and other types of headwear, and some women wore so-called French hoods (some wore those with veils flowing behind them); two of them wore brocade caps. But their headwear left their scalps partly uncovered, on the front, in case of the ladies, so Sherlock could see that their hair colours varied from light-blond to chestnut. Sherlock’s hair was the darkest of them all. Most men were sporting well-styled moustache, some of them also had short beards. In Pierre’s case it was a goatee, as Sherlock had noticed before, others had wider beards. The women wore gowns, while the majority of men wore doublets, or other types of jackets, and breeches. Some articles had patterns, were embroidered or had other forms of decoration.
All he could hear was music, as he entered his old flat, immediately feeling nostalgic, but dismissing the feeling for now. Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake was pouring out of the loudspeakers of an, apparently new, micro music system.
‘Sherlock?’ He was brought back out of his thoughts by John’s voice. ‘You seemed so far away. Are you sure you’re feeling better now?’
It wasn’t hard to fool Lestrade. It was even easier to fool Mrs Hudson and Mycroft’s lackey during his brief visits. Oh, yes, he knew how to hide his addiction, indeed. He wouldn’t have been able to fool Mycroft now, though, but the busybody was away in another country (Sherlock must have deleted which) with a diplomatic visit, which was a rare case for him, but it was definitely playing into his little brother’s hands. If he demonstrated any suspicious activity, Mycroft’s underlings would undoubtedly notify him, but Sherlock knew how to be careful.
One nasty day brought them a long-lasting, cold downpour that renewed with vigour after quietening down only a little bit. Archie was hiding in the bushes (he normally liked the place and used it to watch everything around him, whilst staying relatively unseen), but it hadn’t made any difference and he was soaked through, not to mention that there was a lot of water beneath him now. While it was natural for them to be in the water, this particular situation was, most definitely, unpleasant, even more so for a cygnet that only had down and barely any plumage at all. It was cold and windy, too. He could’ve gone to the flock nearby and they would’ve taken care of him, but he wouldn’t.
‘All right’, John nodded, obviously open for more information. Not even remotely a trusting or naïve person, he liked to be well-informed to form his own opinions.
John was startled to discover that Sherlock was no longer breathing and there was no pulse or any other signs of life he could find now. It couldn’t have been for more than a few seconds, though, since John’s fingertips barely left the pulse point on his friend’s wrist. He quickly checked the one on the pale neck, then pressed his ear against the still chest. There was nothing. Only a couple of minutes before that, John had started to suspect that the ambulance wasn’t going to make it in time. He hated being right about it. It had been six minutes after he had rung the emergency service. They were supposed to arrive any moment now, but Sherlock didn’t have time. John was his only hope to survive. The army doctor was like well-oiled machine when it came to saving lives.
“You pop a pasty in the microwave and it comes out hot and fluffy. You take a bite and it fills you right up.”
There was a silence. John peeked up from behind his hand.
Meanwhile, Sherlock got a 0 on that exam, because A. he didn’t take the test and B.
However, to any not-quite-common passerby, they would have seen a man two seconds away from blowing up in a torrent of aggravation and frustration.
“I was honestly hoping to get to know you a little better before…jumping your bones. I don’t know what came over me and I apologize, but…would you like to have dinner sometime? I understand if you meant for this to be a onetime thing, or-or if you wanted it to just be physical but I really want-”
“Do what makes you happy, John!” she called after him. “Do what makes you happy!”
John shut his eyes tight, hoping to spare himself from whatever was in Sherlock’s eyes. “I was pretending with Molly. It was practice.”
“Not really,” John repeated, straightening. “So, what would you say? How would you get his attention?”
Which meant that John couldn’t know. It would be fine though. The body was merely transport, who cared what happened to it if it helped the greater good. It would hurt at first, but then he’d get used to it. Eventually.
“Then go on the date, John! There are literally only two things you can do right now! I have no idea why you’re freaking out, you’re already dating,” she muttered. “Is it because you’re roommates? That’s not a-”
They both turned to Sherlock, who had left the fluorescent microscope and was at the centrifuge. He didn’t answer.
“You’ve had sex with men!”
John had hoped to give Sherlock time to settle and become comfortable with him, but it had been
John Watson?” she asked. “You’re not! You’re harboring secret lust for your gay roommate, but won’t go for it, because you live together! That’s what
“Yes.”
I’m not done.”
“Apparently not the most famous, if the only consulting detective in the world doesn’t know it,” Sherlock said tartly.
And his straightness.
Sherlock groaned and dug his nails into John’s forearms.
“No, no, no, no, wait a second,” Sheila said, snatching his cell out of his hands. “Let’s think about this.”
“Oh John, listen! This is not the crisis you think it is! There’s literally no pressure on you to do anything or be anything! You can do whatever you want! You’re an adult! There are no rules!”
A vision of Sherlock disappearing into an atom sized particle drifted into John’s head.
“This is the closest-...When Harry introduced me to this bar-...I don’t have to explain myself to you! I’m going home!”
The End.
say it like that,” he said. He fumbled into his coat pockets. “I’ve got to call Sherlock. I’ve got to end this before it gets out of hand.”
They stared at each other for a few seconds more.
He moved from John’s mouth to his neck, returning the favor tenfold.
“Perfect,” he murmured. “Next time should it be your place or mine?”
“Downstairs?” John repeats, his eyes popping open. “We live upstairs.”
They stared at each other.
Molly pointed at Sherlock. John turned. He was seated at the computer, typing. “Do Sherlock. I can’t take this anymore.”
. But why? What was wrong with him?”
John collapsed on the ground besides Sherlock and stared up at the ceiling, the only sounds being their harsh breaths.
“Have you short-circuited? Am I going to need to call an ambulance for the both of us?”
Sherlock stopped short when he walked through the door. John was bundled up on the couch, wrapped in a thick blanket.
“God, Sherlock I love the way you smell,” John barged on, too caught up in the feel of Sherlock’s skin, his hands driven towards the one goal of the bulge waiting just a few inches away.
John decided to have mercy on him, and take them to a comfortable place where Sherlock wouldn’t have to rely on plans. He unwrapped the blanket, and umbrella’d it around Sherlock’s waist.
He closed his eyes and tried to imagine himself with Idris Elba, yet the moment he did he was back on the top stair burying his freezing fingers into Sherlock’s scarf. He got out his own keys and opened the door, and now Sherlock was pulling him up into the flat and into his bedroom. Sherlock kissed him hungrily, his fingers trying to find their way under John’s clothes.
“You know, we serve pickles,” Sheila said. “You want to try a pickle juice martini? It’s been on our-”
In that spirit, if you spot anything wrong or inconsistent, please please PLEASE let me know. Y'all are my beta readers and my common sense filters. If you WANT to beta read for me for realzies, let me know and we'll give it a try. I don't know why you WOULD, but ya know, if you really want to subject yourself to such torture so badly then be my guest. Until then, whoever is reading this, consider yourself my safety net.
Moriarty has her again, and it’s our fault.
I couldn’t see, couldn’t hear. My eyes burned and my head rang. I could feel the confusion of the people around me, the others on the floor that must have been my family.
She tried not to believe him. He was just manipulating her.
And the fact that he could be like that and still do the things he did, still torture and kill and play with lives like pieces on a board scared me more than any lack of emotion ever could.
(See the end of the chapter for
I barely dared breathe; I could see now in those black demon’s eyes a world of anger and of possessiveness and perhaps a tinge of sadness, all clouded by the slightest mist of boredom.
Undoubtedly nothing less than Moriarty’s personal quarters.
“Should have been more careful if you didn’t want this to happen.”
I tried to stay awake as long as possible, but with the adrenaline and immediate threat gone, there was only so much I could do. Within minutes of Moriarty’s departure, I succumbed to the worst pain of my life and drifted into a hazy sort of semi-consciousness, filled with hallucinations and dreams.
“What a shame. Well, Sebby, I tried. Your turn!”
Moran half-dropped, half-shoved me onto the floor, then turned and hit a button that retracted the stairs and closed the door.
So this is hell.
From my new position, I could see several more cameras, including one above the headboard, directly in front of me. Red lights blinked from all of them.
I would pass into full legal adulthood before I could speak a word.
When the door swung open, it was indeed Moriarty who waltzed out, dressed in some sort of silk pajamas.
Wow, in the little time since I posted chapter one, this already has a kudos. That's both unexpected and wonderful!
Unfortunately for my brilliant plan, he decided Moriarty would have to wait.
Okay. MAJOR heads up here. There's some decently graphic stuff in this chapter, please skip if this in any way triggers you or makes you uncomfortable. Nothing too terribly plot important happens here, and a summary of what does can be found in the notes at the end. All I'll say now is I'm very sorry for Allie. Poor girl. She'll probably be rescued eventually. You have been warned. Enjoy?
The collar was unlocked.
Well to be honest I'm not sure who's still reading this. Good news? No one to murder me for my sins against these poor characters. Bad news? No one is telling me how much it sucks so I'm not sure how to improve.
How nice of you to give me a present! Though it is Allie’s birthday, not mine. I guess I’ll just have to get her a gift...
It felt good to finally be home, but it felt...different. It was the same, physically, but I wasn’t. Sherlock wasn’t. John wasn’t. Even Mrs. Hudson wasn’t. She hadn’t seen the things the others did. But she had seen enough. Had seen the metal around my wrists and neck and ankles. She talked quietly around me, spoke in soft tones typically reserved for the bedside of the dying.
Tears streamed down my face and dripped onto the bed below me.
But now he’s done something curious.
Enjoy!
It’s been a half hour. As best as I can tell, Moriarty is done for the night.
I tried to stay awake as long as possible, but it wasn’t long before exhaustion overtook me and I fell into a restless sleep in my kidnapper’s arms.
He looked at a camera and winked.
And then he talked, like everything was normal.
“No. You don’t get to suggest or comment or help. You did this. This is your fault.”
There’s something else, another hushed sentence from Moriarty that I don’t quite catch.
So this is hell.
I closed my eyes and thought of the many places I'd rather be. Home. The cafe. A dumpster.
I've been kicking around the idea of a Moriarty POV chapter. Is that something you guys would want? Anybody? As usual, if you spot any errors or inconsistencies, please let me know. Thanks!
Enjoy!
Sorry, that kinda went on for a bit. See you next chapter!
“What do we know?”
The man standing next to him, Sebby, stalked silently towards me. It took every ounce of my will not to scramble away into some corner of the room. I couldn't afford to show weakness, and doing that would only delay what was now inevitable.
I lay there in disgust and agony, tired but even more determined now, until the light disappeared from the windows completely and Moriarty began to snore softly behind me.
John hovered less and less, but stayed protective, stayed in charge and in control. He came away from it compensating for Sherlock.
And Moriarty.
I don’t know if that’s what he says, or what I’m thinking, but I do know the next part comes from him.
The bar was my chance. I didn’t have long until Moran realized something was wrong. I grabbed a bottle from behind the counter, smashed it open. That was loud. I had maybe ten seconds before someone stopped me; it had to be enough.
If I killed him, I would miss my chance. Besides, I knew Sherlock would do it for me after what was going to happen next.
I doubt she’ll be like that awake for some time.
I was grateful she was trying.
Where before there was hardly a dull moment with him, a moment without thousand-word-a-minute deductions, now there was barely a word an hour. But it was progress from the absolute silence of those early days, so there was hope yet.
“Wouldn’t want me to invite Sebby in again, would you? Not so soon after last time?”
And she won’t be free when that collar is off, either.
For a handful of minutes I lay there, staring at a fixed point on the fireplace as his hand rubbed my shoulder briefly before coming to rest in the tangled nest that was my hair, stroking my head as one does a dog or cat. The similarity, almost certainly deliberate, was not lost on me.
The four of us walk back through identical hallways, following the doctor Mycroft threatened or bribed or what have you. To a room likely identical to countless others, save for its occupant.
Judging by the window in my line of sight--I had not yet moved--it was mid-morning.
I should have refused. I should have dumped the tea in his lap. It would almost have been worth it, just to see his face. He’d be surprised, of course, behind the pain. He wouldn’t expect me to, not with the unsaid threat of being at Sebastian’s mercy hanging in the air.
Clicking on the email, addressed to him, Mycroft, Lestrade, and myself respectively.
What could I do?
It was pure chance that we adopted her or anyone at all. Some sort of accident with her parents. Her unique nature created some interest, and she was brought to Mycroft’s attention. He thought the best place for her would be with us. Where else? Who else? So little six year old Allie joined Sherlock and I here at Baker Street.
I knew I couldn’t.
And was woken up by Sherlock.
Hell no.
The faces and voices came faster now, melding into one another, a whirlwind of escape and imprisonment, everywhere pointed fingers and disappointed looks.
I could feel every drop of blood.
As per usual, drop a comment if you have anything to say, correct, add, yell at me for, etc. I received a very interesting comment on the last chapter (interesting in a good way) and let me tell you, the feedback is definitely appreciated. Thanks!
Faster than I could see, faster than I expected based on the slow pace of approach, Sebastian’s hand wrapped around my ankle and he dragged me toward him. I finally let myself react, kicking at him as best I could, clawing at his face and eyes when I could reach. At that point, there was no use; he ignored my struggles and attacks and picked me up like a sack of potatoes. When I tried to roll out of his arms, he only tightened his grip until I opened my mouth in a silent cry of pain. I went limp.
We’ve reached the 24-hour mark, best as I can estimate, and neither Sherlock nor myself have slept in all that time. While I can’t vouch for Greg or Mycroft, I doubt they have, either.
Still, as I nodded, I had to fight to keep my face blank.
Oh Allie, where are you now?
He pets her head and rubs behind her ears like some household pet, and I’m starting to feel sick again. He grabs her chin and tells her to look at him, look at his face, and she doesn’t want to but he brings up Sebastian and she does.
“But before you drink that, it has been an awfully long time since someone’s fed me a meal.”
In. Out. In. Out.
The blonde is done, now; he moves to the side, bloody cat o’ nine tails in hand. Now Moriarty steps forward; Sherlock, if possible, goes even more tense. Now he pulls Allie up; she tries to struggle out of his grasp but fails.
And I thought I did.
I couldn’t back down now, only intensify my stare. No matter that I was scared for my life.
“You should have known your daddies had enemies. Why weren't you more cautious?”
My breath quickened, the collar seemed to draw tighter. Slow breaths, deep breaths, breathe.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was all I could do not to cry.
I heard the whistle of some sort of whip only an instant before it struck.
When carefully looked at them out of the corner of my eye, and I saw the lights were off, I knew it had to be a setup. Maybe they were on, but the red lights were out. Sounds like something Moriarty would do. Let me know that someone was watching when it was convenient, making me think that no one was when it suited his needs.
But it shouldn’t be her. All I can think is that if they wanted to hurt Sherlock, they would have taken me. They always have before. That thought is all that’s keeping me sane. Don’t think about it too hard. Don’t consider the idea they might want to hurt both of us.
Mycroft recoils slightly, looking offended and almost, if I didn't know better, ashamed.
I’d done what I could to escape, one way or another. There wasn’t really any way off the jet besides jumping to my death, and as tempting and effective as it sounded, there was no way I would make it to the door.
I can’t bring myself to think about what might be happening, right now, at this very moment. Sherlock has so many enemies, too many to keep track of: people he’s put behind bars, people he’s insulted, friends and family of either group. Since meeting him, I’ve gained enemies too.
They would have kept me longer, but they had run all the tests and fixed as much as possible. After that, there wasn’t much they could do when the British government, a detective inspector, and a doctor wanted me elsewhere.
She’s back.
He reaches down to her and I have to resist the urge to yell, the need to scream at him to stop touching my daughter you bastard, because he can’t hear and even if he could I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.
And there is yet another short chapter.
How could she have messed this up?
Just like that he drops her; she doesn’t have the strength to stand. Allie, poor Allie, dangles awkwardly by her wrists, half way through the motion of falling. Through one of the camera angles, I can see the henchperson put away the flail, not bothering to clean it. When he rejoins Moriarty, the two exit the double doors.
I didn't want to see who was there with me. As long as I didn't know, I could hang on to hope.
“Thank you, Sebby. You can go now.”
Panic must have shown on my face because all of the sudden the smothie wasn't in my hand anymore and Moriarty was holding me to him, whispering in my ear and giving me what was surely meant to be a comforting hug.
