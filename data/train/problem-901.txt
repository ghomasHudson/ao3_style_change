“And don’t you dare following me. Like you said; one of us still has a chance”.
Holmes needed to kick this devil of addiction off his back himself; he had even made John sign a contract to not get him any medication to alleviate his symptoms; unless his life was in immediate and absolute danger.
In the middle of the night he kicked himself awake; having managed to tangle himself up in the blanket. Where did that stupid blanket even come from?
“Jesus, calm down D” another of the girls yelled to him.
“A bit more severe than that…” the curly one drew a sharp breath. “Molly is a woman right?” You could almost see the lightbulb over his head in that moment.
She offered him her hand; a form of truce; and a big deal for her.
Stepping over the threshold to the room he seemed to have to break through an invisible but yet physical barrier.
Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed in horror of John’s hard words.
“That won’t bring her back though” her voice was cracking and Celia’s chest cramped.
“You know where to find me if you need Sherlock Holmes” he continued to whisper. She nodded and DI Greg Lestrade went back to his office.
Sherlock looked up at him with big wet eyes; speechless like a little lost boy…
Sherlock sat in a lotus position on the chair in front of the laptop and phone; filing the information about Cat, as well as the new bits of information on Paul Stulte into his own hard drive; also known as his mind palace.
Molly jumped slightly as she heard footsteps and muffled voices outside the doors. She knew those voices and they made her smile.
“This isn’t easy for me, sweetheart, Lucy…” Celia felt a lump form in her throat. She swallowed hard. “We found Kelly last night, she’s….” she coughed, her voice was dying out. She usually had no problems informing other people of the loss of a loved one.
“Have anyone confided in you, something you felt might have been a bit strange perhaps?” Sherlock had his hands on his back, still watching the older man carefully making a long list of deductions about everything from his breakfast to his lack of churchgoers.
“Balance of probability” Holmes replied without taking his eyes off the body in front of him.
“Oh she was, but she even fooled you to believe she was weak and needed help” Holmes’ eyes rolled sarcastically.
“Thank you, Greg! Can always count of you!” She smiled at the older DI who placed a cup of fresh coffee in front of her.
The cord tightened around her neck and that was it.
“Is it your daughter you worry for? I can tell you’re worried from that slight quiver in your hand and the fact that your eyes keep darting towards your phone. She fits the victims profile, doesn’t she?”. She stood up as he spoke. Her mouth open and her hand balling into a fist.
But both urges were so strong that John’s poor brain short circuited. He stood helplessly frozen.
“You have a picture of her in your wallet?” John’s eyes were wide as he looked at the back of his curly head.
“Still no news?” Greg Lestrade nearly made her jump as she was looking at the pictures of the marks on the girl’s neck.
What factor had he overlooked?
He needed peace. Just for a second!
Sherlock was shivering and stumbled slightly as he sat himself down on the bed behind him; his eyes were locked on John; his head full of questions… full of the need for John to touch him.
Though… there was one way… and Watson himself; the doctor; could not deny that even he had thought about it a few times.
Despite his chattering teeth and complaining of feeling cold; his skin was burning hot to the touch.
“Miss A…” realization finally hitting Watson, he had never made the connection before now. Of course. Of bloody course.
Sherlock gave her a grave look… John seemed the more confused.
He had the best source for witless romantic babble at his hands. Opening John’s emails he went digging; this time paying a bit more attention to the wording rather than just treating it as comic relief.
But John was playing… and he was in charge of the game.
Lucy was alone in Jack’s flat trying for the life of her to remain tough. She was more sorry than angry but she couldn’t let the world know that. She felt hollow inside and had no idea what to do with herself and her emotions.
“Why can’t you do it yourself?” He already knew that the other one expected him; skipping all niceties, to send her a text. But still he seemed to try to school him… perhaps in time it would help make him more… human? Decent?
“Sherlock, no” John gasped.
“What you said about me having a life…” his voice was hushed. His shivering stole its strength away.
“It’s not always the boyfriend” a voice startled her and she jumped. She looked up to meet a pair of greyish green eyes looking straight at her. Sherlock Holmes. Gosh he was fast.
Technically that wasn’t exactly a lie.
This was a good night for John it seemed. No nightmares for him tonight.
“Give it to me” He was done playing ‘nice’. As nice as he could pretend to be.
Sherlock found himself on his knees; tears trailing down his cheeks. In his hand he held the letter opener that he to his horror had no memory of grabbing. His hand was clenched around the handle so tight his knuckles turned white.
Oh she really thought she had laid that ghost to rest a long while ago!
Holmes and Watson cleared off soon after when Sherlock claimed to have seen enough and said he would have a better look at her at the morgue and was sure he could come a lot closer.
“Can I crash at yours again?” Lucy was the sender. Celia bit her lip hard
He wanted to stall further but he was fearing his unwillingness would become too apparent. He had to bite the bullet and get on with it.
John had no idea what had caused or triggered this… but it was a reaction he knew all too well from himself and his fellow veterans.
“Maybe but you can’t just show up and…” John didn’t get further before Sherlock had sprinted to get his blue scarf and wrapped it around his long neck before he grabbed his dark coat and flipped up the collar.
“Hmm” he mused. “maybe the couch is softer then?” he pointed to the dark corner of the room. She swallowed hard.
(See the end of the chapter for
Having to be ‘William’.
“Sherlock, no” she whimpered as a tear rolled down her own cheek.
She was white as a sheet; but managed a smile. A polite one.
“Something’s different about her” he said right away and stepped closer to her face. “Look at the marks on her cheeks” he pointed out to Molly. She leaned in as well.
A glimmer of hope was ignited within her just then. Maybe the one she had been running so far from would save her this time too. Maybe he had always known where she was… maybe… maybe…
“I am not here to hurt you” he looked right into her eyes. His stare made her bite into her lip. “I just want to know you” he tilted his head; mirroring her movements.
“Were you romantically involved?”
“I love you”
“And she’s a test subject is she?” John gestured towards the female. He was not buying it, not any of it!
“I’m really not at liberty to disclose anything of the sort” the minister was calm. Sherlock bit his lip about to lose his patience completely. Just then his phone rang and he excused himself to the man.
Cat had stumbled onto her feet and put the cash into her purse and nodded. She gave him a weak smile when she took her coat and hobbled out of the room…
Oh… I’ve done it again, haven’t I?
“I’ll need the loo” she gasped. Somehow she was now realising that once again she forgot her evening tablets. This was getting old.
“People generally don’t like people who are different” John called out to him as he brewed the tea.
How could he have chosen her… Where had she been when Sherlock was out of it; crying in the corner of the bedroom in the middle of night; clawing at his own skin? Shaking violently…
“And you are not going to make a sound” John continued to list the simple rules of today’s game. “Make a sound and I stop. No matter what I’m doing to you, I’ll stop. This will also count as your safeword” John’s eyes still held Sherlock’s in a vice grip.
Sherlock returned home; finding John tapping away on his laptop. He Observed his typing pace while he hung his coat and scarf by the door.
Sherlock’s naked back was turned to him; pale and thin, so pale it was almost luminescent in the poorly lit bedroom.
“Sherlock Holmes is out there; bet he hoped to make it here before us! The nerve” she was shaking her head. “I’ve told the crew to keep an eye out not to let him in here”.
He was too proud… usually…
He held the door for her as she entered.
At the The Stafford she asked for Mr Greenwich. One of Paul’s aliases. He had a rota that she was told to memorize. After Greenwich came Yellowstone then Redding.
Leaning against the fridge she looked at her phone; with an icy cold sensation washing over her.
But it told the man all he needed to know. He read her like an open book within the second.
John once again let his tickling fingers travel… this time they made it to Sherlock’s groin and lower abdomen.
“What experiment would that be then?” John was seriously struggling to keep his calm.
“Don’t” he repeated once more. It seemed to be the only word he could muster.
The evidence of physical torture and bullying was heart-breaking (not that Holmes was known to have one to break). But of course the young man was refusing to press charges… taking the fall himself. Including his own father’s wrath.
John needed the sleep too… These weeks had drained him.
“He’s getting desperate, almost as if he has a quota to meet” the consulting detective’s voice was low. The DI shuddered. “Just the wrong place at the wrong time”. He was picking at the stitches on her arm that she had obviously stitched herself.
He went to the kitchen and took the cup John had already prepared; assuming it was for himself.
“Lucy, when you get this please get on  a bus and go visit aunt Betty. I don’t want you in London… there is a serial killer on the loose and you might be at risk. Please call me soon”. Every word stung as she spoke to the answering machine. She knew it would fall on deaf ears…
“Fuck me if you want, but keep me out of fucking up your life” the woman under him turned to ice. She tried to sit herself up
Feeling her chest constrict she stumbled towards her small kitchen. It was only a few footsteps away from her bed but some days it seemed like an uphill climb.
“I hope you washed your hands before you started gnawing at your knuckle. I do also know how you feel about germs” The devil continued speaking to her.
Usually he would never have cared about such trivial matters, but in this woman he saw a puzzle to solve.
She was incredibly quiet this one; so accepting of her fate. He barely had to force her down the stairs. She hardly even shivered as he removed her clothes.
“It’s not funny, You know you’ve to call me if you stay out late. I worry. Be safe!” She tried to sound calm. It was no use shouting. She had tried that. Goodness knows she had tried that!
There was no answer on that one.
But John really did need the air in his lungs, he had to cool himself down. The cold London air would help that along…
But looking up from the screen and seeing him curled up peacefully breathing with a low snore it made his lips curl into a reluctant smile for some inexplicable reason.
“I can’t even sit still” the man who was famously known as the world’s greatest detective moaned. The effort he used to voice his annoyance was wasted; it was plain as day.
I would trade places with you if I could. Can I?
He sobbed against her chest and quickly stopped fighting her embrace. Giving in to her.
“They are sending me away” He even sounded like that handsome boy she used to know.
Half of him wanted to hug Sherlock, pull him close and save him from all the monstrous demons that had brought him to this point…
She almost ran out of the bar; only nearly escaping a fall down the stairs outside.
“Don’t make me do that to you again, okay pet?” his voice was sickly sweet. Like a punch to the gut.
“Wh-why are y-you he-here” She managed to voice. Her old stutter was showing its ugly face.
The minister had nothing to add and the people who were photographed and recorded entering and leaving the church didn’t seem out of place, if only they had something to go on, anything… not even a strand of hair did they have.
“No, it’s okay!” he brushed his hand over her cheek and gently lifted her face to make her look back into his eyes. “I’m here now”
“Do, you, have, it?” he pressed on, emphasising each word; as if he assumed she had not understood him the first time.
“Can we send her home yet?” John groaned.
The landlady, Mrs. Hudson, did come with a plate for lunch but he never noticed or recognised it; especially not her usual muttering about not being the housekeeper. It was getting rather old. But Sherlock was an expert at filtering…
“Look who’s here… the calf… uh… cavalry!” she laughed at her own joke.
Having found a suitable restaurant a mischievous smile lit up his face.
Sherlock cursed the silence… he wanted to beg John to move his hand back… to grab him, to take him into his hand and make him cum…
“Yes” he replied. “When can I have the copies?” he was standing in front of the map with the now 6 pins marking the crime scenes. His mind was hastily trying to make a pattern out of it looking for possible connecting points.
Lucy was walking the streets of London. She had left her boyfriend’s flat in a hurry. She didn’t care that he was using but she couldn’t handle it when he was trying to drag her into it.
She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Her hair removed from her face made the bruise stand out. Like a sore thumb.
“Your arse” the woman clutched her purse and took a big sip of her drink.
“A skull” oh god. Thank god! She caught herself thinking. Then she calmly reminded herself that this was someone else’s daughter and she had a job to do. And if she didn’t; this wouldn’t be the last poor girl to be found. The killer had to be stopped.
Sherlock reluctantly got on his feet slowly, still shivering as he let the shorter man put his arms around him. He wanted to push him away somehow. Hugs. Oh how he hated that gesture of sentiment. But he was desperate, he wanted the water to stop running down his cheeks. It had to stop!
“You’re leaving?” Her heart stopped in her chest.
Returning to the bar; there was William smiling widely upon seeing her.
Everyone knew that he might have had his fingers in some dirty pies… but nothing had stopped his campaign.
Sherlock Holmes was begging.
“You feel so good” John moaned to Sherlock; and Sherlock could feel that. He felt John’s cock twitch and throb with excitement inside of him; against his stretched walls.
John knew it was a hint about his previous social life… perhaps he had seen quite a few women since he returned injured from the war… but it was certainly not something the other would ever let go.
“- And Miss Hooper?” Celia stopped Molly Hooper from hanging up the phone after she had given her oral report.
You even gave me a smile; before you closed your eyes.
“Ida is my guest” Sherlock stepped in between them; glass cracked under his bare feet as he moved.
Gently he continued the circles; knowingly doing it long enough for Sherlock to want to groan at him to ‘get on with it’… and then he did it a little more… before without a warning slipping the finger in; just to the first joint.
“Cat” he replied.
She was far from that.
Kneeling down in the same motion John slid Sherlock’s comfortable trousers down; leaving Sherlock only wearing his bulging white pants.
Sherlock Holmes was a broken man. And it tore at John’s heartstrings to see him in such a state.
Oh John. Look at me. Please. Keep your eyes on me.
The moment she was gone his dashing smile faded. His eyes rolled and he ruffled his curls. He paid the barman and was on his way home.
Will I always have to see your head fall back; cushioned by the falling snow… do I have to see the snow turn from white to red.
“I mean why her? She’s 26, all the others were teenagers, her coat didn’t scream Goth” he kept his eyes on her.
Sherlock didn’t want to admit it… but he had actually ended up enjoying the feeling of those fingers. They worked.
He tore her jeans and panties off in one long movement; and barely allowed her a second to breathe before he moved himself  back on top of her; inside her.
“Don’t” he warned her.
“Here you go”. Greg Lestrade placed a fresh cup of coffee in front of her. She was chewing on her lip.
Please enjoy this chapter, and do forgive me!
“Let me guess, a crack whore?” John snapped cruelly. Much more cruelly than he intended; but he was overwhelmed with rage at this point.
Sherlock was fidgeting with his phone. Not much of a talker today John thought… nothing new there. It could be like talking to a wall some days. Or a moody teenager in a grown man’s body. As he stood there, his fingers tapping away.
Though, she was not all there…
Instantly she placed the strand back. Hiding her imperfection from the world again.
He felt as if the air in his lungs had been punched clean out of him.
She tried not to smile when she made an internal observation that it seemed it was often a trait of men with power-complexes or a below average penis… or even a combination of the two…
His nose against her bare skin felt like a rush; unlike any other man who had had his way with her; she actually reacted to his touch.
The day passed for Cat as well… and she grew increasingly numb. She struggled to eat her lunch, but forced herself. She needed to have some physical strength to endure what she had coming.
“Are you going to tell me what the hell is going on?!” John bellowed to Sherlock; completely ignoring the young woman.
“Hey leave a message and see if I bloody care”
“Silence” John put an index finger over the hole; as if it was a pair of lips.
Some brothers these had been though.
“Can I have the cash then?” The young woman stood up as soon as she had finished the pancakes. She was already on her way out of the door. Celia’s heart was aching. She got up and found the packed lunch she had lovingly prepared for her.
“Jack’s” came the short answer. It pained her to hear that anger that was always present in her daughter’s voice. She could still vividly remember her little blonde baby girl running around giggling her head off. So much had changed since Lucy’s father had been killed in action in Afghanistan.
He grabbed her arms hard and she cried out; shocked. He pushed her into the open van aggressively. The voice barking even louder to him.
“Interests, hobbies?” ‘William’ tried another approach.
“I see you’re aroused already” he looked up at Sherlock who seemed to blush in reaction to John’s observation. It was not that he was ashamed; but when they played these games Sherlock’s frame of mind and his awareness of himself became altered.
Didn’t the women know these words were nothing but cheap tricks? Surely they couldn’t be so easy… did they just play along?
Her face changed; a bit of colour returned to her ashen cheeks.
He could make her feel so alive…
I knew that day we met. I knew it wouldn’t end well as the day progressed. It moved too fast… too soon.
He found John’s laptop on the coffee table and opened it; finding John once again had changed the password…
Without any further words he slid her coat off of her shoulders and soon put an already prepared drink in her hand. Without her usual hesitation she took a long sip of it.
“A serial killer, that is what I need! Call Lestrade, he must have something!” Holmes was practically salivating at the thought.
She could swear Sherlock turned his curly head for a brief moment to look in her direction. Perhaps it was just her imagination.
There was a cold methodical approach to these murders. One that chilled her to the bone. There was a slight bruising on the arms but the only real sign of violence was the dislocation of the shoulders; which was caused by gravity as they were hung by the hands for what was estimated to be at least 5 hours; barely touching the ground with their toes and then the strangulation that had been terminal. One could only imagine the anguish and fear they would be going through during those last hours before their death.
But for some reason she always had it standing on the shelf in front of the mirror; perhaps so no one would judge her if they saw it was missing from her array of tools to make up herself…
“Better get you out of these, too. There’s no room for your bloody erection” John mused; proud of what he had managed to do to Sherlock. He knew exactly how vulnerability worked on him.
The veins in his arms grew as he placed his hands on her sides; giving him extra power to give her the final push over the edge.
“Thank you for cooperating, Billy” she smiled back at him and they both sat down. “Where were you Monday evening till Tuesday?” She looked into his eyes and he swallowed hard.
When she finally did she soon slammed it shut behind her; locking it firmly and checked it twice.
“Sherlock, are you all right??” John asked bewildered… But Sherlock heard nothing.
The woman stood in the middle of the room chewing the knuckle of her right thumb; her teeth sinking deeper and deeper; surrounding the joint…
Enjoy this last section of this story. Thank you for reading so far!
“S-sorry… I have an issue with touch” she admitted; hanging her head underlying her shame over that fact.
“I was worried about her, as a doctor and as a human being. She was in a bad way” the army doctor shrugged. “How did you feel about her? Or should I say think” he rephrased himself. He knew Sherlock wasn’t a fan of feelings…
“Sherlock Holmes” he held out his hand to her, politely offering to shake hers.
Hearing her phone she jumped out of bed; her entire being in a state of cold sweat and panic.
Sherlock was physically shaking now; hugging his own shoulders. He felt cold to the core.
He lost his usually graceful footing and stumbled. When he reached for salvation he nearly knocked over a side table. Hearing something clank against the dark oak surface he instinctively looked. Seeing what he had disturbed became the final nail in the casket the room had become.
On the kitchen table; in amongst Sherlock’s latest experiments that seemed to be the only things untouched; sat a young woman… completely naked and obviously high off of her face.
She slid onto the floor, nearly collapsing. Her teeth chattered; despite her little home being warm and cosy enough.
Had it gone any different if she had held her breath longer? Should she have smiled more? Maybe the other dress had been better? Was it wrong of her to be early?
Lies. That was exactly what he was doing!
“Thank you Greg” she smiled at him before eying Sergeant Donovan and called her over.
She held her breath; didn’t even dare to move. She feared she would pass out if she did something to worsen the pain.
She wanted to cry. No… This was not just about getting off…
“GAH!” He heard a well known groan of frustration.
Cat decided it was better to lie down and attempt to sleep through it.
And it worked… she was taken under; almost feeling herself sliding down into the darkness. Her body was worn out from the night she had had; apparently.
Was it really so easy?
She then crawled back on the bed with a banana in her hand, her usual breakfast; well as long they were still greenish and by no means had a brown spot on them. She sat herself as upright as possible. As straight as her spine allowed.
Sherlock quickly glanced towards her just as she staggered to her feet, still with the dumb smile plastered on her lips.
“Have you noticed a change in any of your faithful’s?” Holmes wanted to know.
We were in a locked room. How could there be snow?
He tried to close his own eyes; trying to let his breathing pattern mimic sleeping.
“Don’t touch anything though, evidence. Remember” the inspector warned him; with these words giving him permission to pull the lever disguised as an early edition of J.M. Barrie’s ‘Peter Pan – The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up’.
“You mean she’s careful, guarded? I wouldn’t blame her.” John attempted; remembering quite well that picture Sherlock had shown him.
Subconsciously she was shaking her head.
The image of her, so much younger, standing there in front of a bathroom mirror trying not to throw up again as she had her fingers deep inside her mouth; trying to remove the last of the filthy, rough hairs that was stuck between tonsils and tongue.
Two could play his game!
“6 months of sleeping rough” John’s hands had balled into fists. “She was vulnerable!”
“Yes” Sherlock’s voice was lower than he intended.
“Try and stay out of this for once!” She snorted. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.
“Let me go, please” her eyes were wet and the makeup she was wearing was running down her cheeks. She was reduced to a sobbing infant. “I won’t tell anyone, I promise… please” she continued to plead as he hung her from the water pipe.
“I hope you’re not thinking about dragging that freak into this whole thing” she snorted. DI Yellow gave her a confused look. “Sherlock Holmes” the sergeant explained. Celia nodded understandingly.
In that moment he grabbed hold of her face; pressing his lips against hers and forced her mouth open. He claimed her with his tongue taking her breath away completely.
“Might we have a look at Annie Jackson?” he looked at her softly. Molly Hooper put her heart back in the metal bowl and bit into her lip nervously.
“Don’t worry, I don’t have to come inside. I just want to make sure you get home safe. You’re an attractive young woman and you never know. I’d hate if something happened to you” he looked for her bewildered eyes.
“What was it you were looking for?” John asked as calmly as he could muster. John already knew the answer; but he had to hear it from Sherlock’s own full lips.
“John?!” Sherlock’s raspy voice questioned.
Now there was that strange sensation again. Her lips widened in a smile; her eyes somehow lit up.
“You don’t have to do it” she reminded him. She could barely breathe. Her fingers twitched and her skin crawled. She suspected the same thing was happening to him…
“How stupid is she!” he looked through the glass at the woman in the grey suit and the yellow hair. The brim of his nose wrinkling in frustration. He bolted out of there and half a second later he stood in front of Celia Yellow.
“She did, but Sherlock let’s not go there” John calmly informed his friend. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.
Sherlock’s hands cramped; his back arched and he pushed himself back onto John’s cock; opening himself up further in the process.
But Sherlock had never told him about that… He simply shrugged when John later noticed the fading bruises as he caught him changing his clothes.
“Not necessarily. Would there be a reason for us to think he might have had a grudge against Annie?“ DI Yellow looked into the eyes of the young woman that had now grown damp.
Officers were on their way to pick up Billy Clarke and Celia was spending the time pondering Holmes’ theory. Religious fanatic? A priest maybe? What religion? She shook her head. What had he based his conclusion on? The choice of victim? She knew many people had a grudge against people with that particular style and she was already dismissing Sherlock’s words. She had to admit not even she was too fond of her daughter’s lifestyle choice.
“Yes Master” all emotion left her voice.
John barely dared to turn his head. Could he really see him in that state? Should he? Wouldn’t Holmes prefer if his emotional self stayed a myth?
She finally heard the footsteps coming up behind her. She smiled. Her shoulders hurt more than any pain she had ever felt in her life; both had been dislocated from the precarious position he had left her in for hours upon hours.
“Well you know where to find me if you change your mind. How is Lucy doing?” he looked carefully at her.
“I’m trying to work!” he looked at her with annoyance painted on his face. She shook her head and smiled.
“Oh doctor” Sherlock sighed.  “Remind me; what is the rate of serial-battered women actually seeking help?” he rolled his eyes.
Molly Hooper started her shift early and stretched her entire being, hearing the cracks of her spine as she entered the morgue. It was dead silent in there as she was the only living soul.
Molly Hooper smiled at Sherlock as he entered the morgue with John. She was just about to open the body bag Kelly Middleton had arrived in when they came. His timing was always impeccable. She had been informed of the change of status regarding Sherlock Holmes and it did please her. She couldn’t deny that.
He knew Sherlock was lying through his teeth.
“Ohhhhh!” Sherlock groaned as he himself came; splattering cum on the bed in front of him.
His hips gave a jolt and a delicious sigh was heard.
“Not long enough. I love the place” she flashed him a smile.
And on her way she was.
He had been there all along; all Sherlock had to do was wake him up and ask for his help. And he chose this!
It held a key, and a cheque for 100.000 pounds; and a handwritten note with an address and the words:
The man finally returned and she turned her head to look at him. So much hate met her in those eyes. He was carefully moving her long hair out of the way and put the cord around her neck. She was shivering. Her phone beeped once again. The man paused for a second before he tightened the cord.
“Ida!” Sherlock demonstratively reminded John that she in fact had a name; and was not a ‘that’.
“You broke my heart tonight” It pained him having to say it out loud.
Perhaps not the wisest choice to mix it with alcohol either… but as some people felt the need to continuously put out there ‘you only live once’… and the drinks she had that night had been sorely needed.
“Yes, the grandson is looking for the money she’s hiding from him in her will; boring!” Holmes crossed his arms across his chest. “Call Lestrade!” he ordered.
“Well you certainly look human” ‘William’ laughed so hard his whole body moved and some of his curls bobbed around. “Okay then” he changed the subject for her; every little twitch of her body told him she was about to leave; too soon.
John looked away from the church for a moment to watch Holmes in his Mind Palace, a blank stare. What was the point of going to stake out the church when he wasn’t even watching? They were wasting time… John’s gaze returned to the church. Not much activity.
He had already braced for Watson’s overreaction. He had not imaged this.
It was a cold sound. A harsh sound that brought her back to reality with a jolt. She was slipping in and out of consciousness because of the pain that was ever present and she would rather stay under.
“Oh right, of course” John said and got up massaging the back of his neck that had grown stiff as he had nodded off.
Much sooner than he expected. Shouldn’t she be asleep at this hour?
“John… I…” His voice was croaky. “I need you” Holmes’ teeth seemed to hug his lower lip; he took heavy breaths “Now more than ever”
She was still writhing; she swore she could still feel the friction of him inside of her. She struggled to even sit up.
“Before? What happened?” he worked hard on showing concern.
Fuck. Now there really was no going back.
He was breathless; and he had already taken her breath away.
Expertly John knotted them together with the scarf. It gave Sherlock a spark of the same electricity that had flowed through John when their hands touched; and it had the same effect on Sherlock.
“Shezza?“ John groaned rubbing his cheek with his hand in frustration. He had heard that name before.
The man was sitting on a chair looking at her. His bible resting in his lap. She was working hard on ignoring the pain from her shoulders as they were slowly working themselves out of their joints.
His eyes bore into hers. His entire body froze.
“You said he was strong?” He looked up at the doctor.
John put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s hips and moved himself up against Sherlock’s ass. He aligned his cock with Sherlock’s prepared opening and pushed the head against it; until it gave way and John’s head popped inside his sphincter.
“I can call DI Lestrade and have him take over?” he offered. She shook her head.
Finding himself growing more irritated than inspired he snuck back in and put the phone back where he found it. Missing his aim by a millimetre in the dark the casing hitting the table gave a sound.
“He knows her?” DI Yellow repeated her question as she looked at John. Watson nodded, trying to stay calm himself.
It was a fact too painful to bear.
Somehow…
What a preposterous accusation!
“The… the rose” she sighed. She felt a hot electricity buzz from him into her. It even took her several seconds to remember her carnal fear of human touch…
Sherlock ran to don his famous attire and the two men were off towards St. James. Sherlock was a source of energy; practically waltzing about. He was that contend to have a real case at last.
“No, I mean really hate; hate so strong that one would be driven to murder?” Holmes spat and rolled his eyes.
“Elephant” she spoke to the empty room, as if it could work retrospectively; her voice little more than a creak.
“Don’t leave me tonight”
“No one knows me here” she beamed. Her exact reason for the move.
“Well who doesn’t in this day and age?” The minister spoke wisely. Sherlock nodded. Biting into his lip.
“Religious beliefs?” John wondered as he came back with his cup. Sherlock took it right out of his hands and took a sip.
“Don’t leave me” Sherlock’s voice actually broke this time.
“I know someone who would know though” his voice lowered again and she knew exactly what he was hinting at.
“hmm” he hummed; adding another note to his file about her to his mind palace.
“You’ve got great taste” the way he looked at her made it seem like he wasn’t talking about the contents of his glass.
Emotions were not something Sherlock wanted to concern himself with. It was a lesson he learned a lifetime ago. He didn’t want to admit it; but his brother was right when he reminded him that ‘All hearts are broken’. It was a tedious process; one that Sherlock surely didn’t have time for.
She braced herself for the outburst the mention of that name would cause.
“You’re so tense” A skinny boy some years older than her and with dark hair whispered to Lucy as they sat on his bed.
John could not help but let his eyes wander over Sherlock’s pale and freshly exposed skin; it filled him with electricity: the mere thought of running his hands over his muscular body… an electricity that radiated all the way to his cock, making it twitch into life.
“How’s it going?” Greg’s kind eyes smiled at her as hers met his. She just shook her head and sighed in reply “That bad, eh?” he raised his brow. “Is Sherlock any help?” he sipped his own coffee. Celia bit her lip.
Sherlock tried to deny his own want and lust; contemplating being a difficult subject… just to see how John would react. But it was not the feeling of pain Sherlock needed today… so reluctantly he swung his long legs over the edge of the couch and languishedly rose to his feet.
She put the kettle on; brewing herself a cup of caramel flavoured instant coffee. Well, it was more of a case of milk and sugar with a tiny bit of scented coffee…
He didn’t hear John coming down, wanting a glass of water as he, too, couldn’t sleep. John leaned against the sink as he drank his water; watching his friend carefully.
Holmes’ Mind Palace session ended abruptly at the voice of his landlady, Mrs. Hudson.
“Does it matter now?” the tall man barked back, his eyes trained on what had become his info wall on this particular case. Watson’s silence told him it wasn’t answer enough for him. A few minutes later Sherlock finally explained. “I would need a picture to show my homeless network; she kept changing her name. She was good; she almost escaped me a few times…” his green eyes zoomed in on her picture. John was glaring at it as well.
“He had a plan with all of these girls, I don’t think he was just out to kill them… He might have given them a choice” he wet his meaty lips.
“Just Cat” she sighed. Her eyes were darting towards the door. He noticed how her feet were even aiming towards it. He was losing her.
“You knew Mira as well, he could have threatened her to silence easily, or at least he would have thought he could” the detective explained.
As much as she hated him, she loved him. She cared… and she would never stop. Silly heart.
“What do you think you’re doing, Freak?” Sherlock was met by an angry Sally Donovan at the crime scene. He had been just a few minutes too late. “This is DI Yellow’s case and she doesn’t want you here”. She crossed her arms across her chest and couldn’t hold back her smug smile. Finally a DI with some sense.
He needed to numb his ever overactive brain. Too many thoughts all at one; it was quite overwhelming. Oh if he could swap minds with someone simple for just one night.
“The A was one she carved after Irene Adler kicked her out… breaking her heart in the process” Sherlock calmly explained pointing to the A, while his finger was still tracing the S.
And there it was. The end. A painful end. A desperate end. She wriggled in her last moments. She might have come to terms with her fate but she still struggled as the cord tightened around her throat cutting off her air supply. Human nature at its finest.
She had to breathe. She had gotten quite good at holding her breath over the months; but he was better at waiting.
“A tattoo on the wrist and she had her nose pierced” The woman in the blue protective suit explained removing her gloves. “It’s our man, DI Yellow, She’s been dead at least a day” she let her know.
They didn’t have much to go on though and as she reached for another painkiller to numb her back pain she noticed a yellow sticky note.
“I was going to step in eventually, she needed a break” he glared at his friend. Watson drew a deep, sharp breath.
“Shhh” he shushed her. His tongue reversed the journey his nose had made…  moving just a bit further towards her face; his lips hovered over hers. “Besides, you’re the cleanest surface in here”
Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed.
She knew it was over soon. Just not soon enough.
“John, please do say something. Your blood pressure must be through the roof“. He frowned, trying to hide his actual concern.
Horrific scenarios invaded his mind of what he was going to find.
She straightened her body as much as she could.
Putting one hand around Sherlock’s stomach to steady him, John bowed over him. Sherlock could feel John’s hard bulge push into his spine and even that made him gush with excitement.
“Me too. Much better than that modern stuff” he gave her a toothy smile.
“How do you know that? I thought DI Yellow didn’t want you on the case?” John didn’t seem too convinced and was preparing himself.
“Inspector… not a word of this to anyone, okay?”
“When did you last speak with Annie?” DI Yellow was interviewing the sister of the 4th victim.
He didn’t get to see that all the commotion had alarmed John who had come in; seeing his friend a shivery, sobbing mess.
“I can’t.” was all he could say as he marched towards the door, reaching for his jacket.
Her stomach was in knots. She felt full and empty at the same time. Her entire being felt hollow and she couldn’t stop feeling like she was all alone in the world. Entering the gate of her school she did hear a few people calling her name but it never registered. Upon seeing the empty seat next to hers in the classroom she bit into her lip and ran out of there without any clue of where she was going to end up.
“Don’t make me do this, alone” his vulnerability returned for a second.
“Cat?” he softly asked. “Cat, are you okay?”
“These girls might have been skinny but he would have to use his own force to cling them up like so; besides a woman might have been more prone to resort to physical torture. Remember this killer hates his victims” Sherlock explained. Talking faster than the speed of sound it seemed. Watson had learned to keep up over the years.
“But no, you don’t need me” Holmes spoke with spite in his voice and walked off.
“See, you know stuff” He tried to flatter as he quickly changed Sherlock into William. His assumed alias; however unfanciful considering it was part of his birth name albeit little used these days.
The young woman felt helplessly trapped the minute the lift doors closed on her. She pressed the floor button hard and the lift did as it was intended.
How long had he even been asleep for?
She turned around and grabbed the bedpost for dear life.
“Sherlock, you can’t keep lying around like that until we get the next case… who knows when that’ll be!?”
He sat himself next to her and observantly looked at her drink; it was almost gone.
Lucy sent Kelly yet another text. Kelly could be headstrong but she had always replied to her texts within minutes. They had a bond those two; and it unnerved her that there had been no reply since last night.
Her heart was still beating so fast she could hear it pulsate in the rushing blood in her ears. Turning on all the lights in her flat she went for a fruitless search for any trace of that thing…
Curiously she rubbed her cheeks; she was apparently so unaccustomed to smiling that it hurt her facial muscles.
Noises coming from behind the door told her the knocking had been loud enough. Her senses were now hyper alert.
Deep down she even hoped this time it was spiked so she wouldn’t have to remember or even be conscious for the exploits of the night.
He just couldn’t take it any longer. This was a cruel and unusual punishment.
“When I come back I want an answer” he whispered and then he was gone. The silence that followed was deafening and a tear rolled down her cheek. She knew she couldn’t get her hands free and she had lost the will to fight. She just wanted it to be over. No one was coming to save her. No one was missing her.
She got on her feet and glared at the map with 5 pins placed at the locations the young girls had been found. A new place every time. But always a damp and dark basement with water pipes in the ceiling. There was no clear pattern and it frustrated her beyond words.
Thinking it was Paul she ran to the phone before her body was even fully awake.
“And you’re still not talking?” John laughed. Sherlock shook his head.
I promise you Sherlock will be given a lot more space in this soon! Hope you're not missing him too much?
“What about the case?” Were Sherlock’s first words… he had managed to miss the elongated box in the corner holding it…
John shook his head. He quickly scanned the room; slowly realizing he was not in Afghanistan anymore.
She wasn’t there fully by her own free will. That much was clear.
“I know, must be good to be back at it! Ooh you have a picture of that sweet girl there”. Mrs. Hudson pointed to the wall she had been so concerned about before. “What was her name again?”. Sherlock was rarely in the mood for her goings on, this time he couldn’t stand for it.
The work seemed to muffle them somewhat… but when there was none; they seemed to only get louder until they could no longer be ignored.
The long, straight, black hair was the first feature she could make out in the dark and moist cellar under the high school. She swallowed hard and took a deep breath.
Cat drew a sharp breath. She looked around the room trying to calculate whether or not anyone would have noticed, or cared about him meddling with her drink. But her need outweighed her worry.
Going for her purse she grabbed a pill box marked Wednesday and threw three tablets into her mouth and washed them down with water from the tap and swallowed.
He needed air. Desperately.
John surely knew where he stood on tenderness!?
His eyes darted towards the kitchen. Ida stood in the middle of the room; shivering violently.
His skin felt tingly just as it had then…
He was actually pleased when there was a crashing sound from the kitchen; putting an end the deafening silence that had fallen on Baker Street.
“Miss Hooper”. Molly feared another question. She needed a break as her lips quivered. “Thank you”. This she sighed happily at.
Standing next to the woman he winked his eye at her.
So; the best hope for him was to keep his mind busy… or lie there, on his own hands: In a form of soft self-bondage to keep himself under control.
Ah, there was a thought.
“Who is she?” Yellow asked, surprised and intrigued to finally get a straight answer.
“I haven’t even touched your prostate” John chuckled as both fingers made it to the second joint.
“You changed your lipstick a shade. They did not discontinue your favourite brand and you’re a creature of habit. OCD in fact. Is that a deliberate change on your part? Are you trying to accommodate for your ghostly pale complexion? Who are you trying to impress?”
“I’m bored, John!” Sherlock Holmes cried out as he stood tall on the coffee table in the mess of a flat that was 221B Baker Street “I need a case!” He was absolutely miserable.
The only answer was a groan.
She hated the taste, but loved the effect.
“Mum? What the hell are you doing with Kelly’s phone?” her daughter frowned.
This was what it was like, and she knew it. Paul was the master and she was the sub and she was to serve him. She shouldn’t have complained!
“Well it’s not. She’s just a teenager, that’s what they do” he winked at her.  Obviously trying to help her survive the day of work she had ahead of her.
“You’re thirsty today. I do like that”
“You don’t sound fine. Should I come over?”
“He has taken your tongue, you are truly lost” he moved her long hair out of the way and put the cord around her neck. “I will liberate you, poor soul” he caressed her cheek and she froze.
“Hello?” he spoke softly.
“DI Yellow?” he greeted her politely before she even opened her mouth.
She took it as a challenge. Stupid. Stupid! She had even been curious to know what he meant by dangerous.
“Sherlock?”.
John Watson sat in his chair trying to read the paper. He heaved a sigh.
Snow.
He never told John this… but there had been a time it was so bad Sherlock had crawled into John’s bed and held him carefully trying to calm him down… fearing he would suffer a heart attack from his clearly dangerously elevated heartrate.
Also; if anything in this story seems to be victim-blaming I'd like to say that this story came from me trying to work out a situation and deal with my own doubts, fears and regrets... Most of those thoughts happen in Cat's head and I hope that comes through.
“Mr. Clarke is here” she was told and she was on her way to the interview room where she met a young man about 25 years old dressed in a black shirt and black pants. No piercings or visible tattoos. His hair was short and ginger and his eyes were bright blue. She had somehow expected him to be more out there than this.
That was chiselled into the grey stone. He wanted to remember her as the sweet and righteous girl he raised with her mother. Before the devil possessed both women.
In that second Sherlock felt it and it infuriated him. He was wiping his cheeks with slightly shaky fingers; his face contorting in disgust. John handed him a tissue and he ripped it out of the doctor’s hands and dried his eyes furiously.  Water softly trickling down his pale cheeks from his eyes, dripping onto the table. What in the bloody hell was going on?
No. That would be her answer. But she remembered her promise. ‘Just say yes’… yes to everything.
And something inside of her wanted to confront him with what he had caused her.
“She must have been unconscious, he dragged her down here. It took him a lot of effort; look!” Holmes was pointing at a slight disturbance in the dust that to John that might as well have been from the officers going up and down the stairs. Holmes was in his element and knew better. “He dragged her over here” Sherlock took the same steps the killer would have. “He would have tied her hands here and then…” he rose to his feet. “He threw the chain over the water pipes and dragged her onto her feet and secured it… I don’t think she was meant to be knocked out”
Panic rose back up within Cat; filling her body with painful electricity.
“Mira hated hugs too” John bit into his lip. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open as he glared straight into John’s.
Not that she was in the habit of inviting people into her home.
Why didn’t you move?
He then crawled onto the bed himself; sitting himself right behind Sherlock on his knees on each side of Sherlock’s thighs.
Celia’s hands were shaking as she was trying to prepare the breakfast. She had no idea how Lucy would take the news. First her father and now her best friend. It was not fair. She knocked on her daughter’s bedroom door.
“de Maagd” she announced.
She had tried to hide the bags under her eyes with makeup but the task proved to become more and more difficult for every day that passed.
“And where is that?” he put his elbow on the back of the couch and supported his head. God. This small-talk lark was tedious.
She melted with him.
Why? Why did they have to die? She was getting a bit too emotionally involved and she knew it too well. Her back felt tight and she reached for yet another pill.
John, I’m… I’m sorry. I am. Please, let me claw at your knees for forgiveness. Allow me that. Allow me one more chance.
“Yes, of course. Miss Middleton was knocked unconscious before arriving, did you not notice the marks on her cheeks?” he was looking at her.
“I managed to hide two of the cocaine bottles, just for safekeeping… just in case…” Sherlock was paddling in deep waters.
Hearing his words was the final blow…
“No!” The young girl shouted and got on her feet, knocking her chair over in the process. “Don’t you dare say it!” she threatened.
Hours after she reached into the pocket of her jeans. Gone was the metal box she had had a bad habit of fondling for all these years… it was replaced with an envelope.
“Don’t you want a look at Jennie Taylor too? I think she was the 5th victim”. She offered. Anything to keep Sherlock around even if she did know by now that it would never amount to anything.
“I am not leaving you… I am leaving everyone. Don’t feel special”. Just like that, he was back to being cruel. Pretending not to care.
The woman stumbled, knocking over one of his experiments; it made an unbearable amount of noise.
Cat was sitting on her bed hugging her legs; her back pressed against the cool wall.
“She’s not been dead long they say” the female DI informed the consulting detective. He remained frozen.
He rubbed his bottom lip; his thumb finding the small scar left from last time he had felt the full force of John’s wrath… He probably deserved it that time in the kebab shop…
Holmes gave a disgruntled Donovan a cheeky grin before he entered, donning gloves. Her tension over not being able to stop him amused him beyond words. He just loved toying with her.
Sherlock wasted little time getting into the sealed crime scene once the last officer had cleared off. John felt like protesting when they broke through the taped door but he knew Sherlock too well by now so it stayed inaudible.
A good moment later he looked to John who was making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen.
“Have you seen Kelly lately?” She started gently. The girl looked back at her.
Her hip was throbbing; a red bruise was forming and she did know putting ice on it would help reduce the swelling. But something within her stalled.
“Are you… jealous?” Holmes frowned. John gasped.
Holmes went over the night in his head; word for word… subtracting every little detail; every little piece of body language was deducted to pieces.
No going back now.
The cut started to sting now; making her jaw open wider in a silent cry. But it was a reaction to the frustration rather than the fact that it hurt.
“All we know is that he targets young females with a gothic clothing style; he undresses them and ties them up and leaves them for several hours; leaves no trace and none of the girls knew each other” she shrugged her shoulder tiredly.
What? What on Earth did he imply?
“No… Scoliosis… left untreated” The words themselves seemed to be painful for her to produce.
“I will” he nodded at her and sprinted to his office.
“Member of the public; she fits the MO” Donovan informed her. She was already putting her coat on ready to run out of there. The team were underfoot.
Just as she thought she should give it a try a text came through. From him… from Paul. She felt the muscles in her stomach tighten uncomfortably.
She ended up using most of the toilet paper; trying to clean herself up at least some; trying to ignore the fact that what she wiped away was mixed with blood.
“Wouldn’t dream of it” She shook her head. “If you would give me a minute” she pushed through to her desk trying to gather the new information the latest find of the new dead body gave them. The killer hadn’t strayed from his method. The only difference was that it was another young girl full of dreams and plans who was no longer alive. The parents had been contacted and were to confirm her identity soon.
“Such a pretty thing you are” he cooed, running his fingertips down over her face, all the way to her collar bone; this made her swallow again.
He hung his coat and scarf on her coat stand and instantly turned to look at her. Already mid twirl having taken in most of her flat.
Two officers were stalking the church night and day, everyone who had been in touch with the young victims shortly before their untimely deaths were taken in for questioning, autopsy reports were re-read and Molly Hooper the pathologist who had performed most of them was called to give her opinions once more. Scotland Yard was a busy beehive of activity and everyone could practically hear the clock ticking.
The loudest sigh of exasperation came from him. His eyes rolled and he seemed like a dragon about to spit out fire. And she was right in the firing line.
“Thank you for tonight” he smiled at her.
“Mira!?” Sherlock’s voice bellowed through the hallways. It resonated through, echoing. He opened the door and there she was. She was not alone though.
“Maybe,” he put his hand on the edge of the table to stabilize himself. “Maybe we should see how quiet you can be” he winked his eye at Sherlock who did know what that meant. The dangerous glimmer in his eyes had already given the game away.
Promise me.
Now it was Sherlock’s chest cavity that cramped.
The voice was almost instantly turned down to a whisper as he entered the building. He gasped a sigh of relief.
“No use, she’s not got any” Holmes mumbled as he was going through her clothes.
“Remember; be quiet” he ran his nail against Sherlock’s inner thigh instead of the soft digit.
He knew what that slight tremor in his friend’s voice meant. He knew how desperate he would have to be to utter that word…
He was asleep. Of course he was asleep. She shouldn’t have called! How stupid could she have been… how…
And silently Sherlock slid out of the dressing gown and threw the well-worn shirt over his head; dropping it to the floor next to the blue silk gown.
She withdrew her hand and her nervous tick resumed. She put the strand behind her ear; revealing that bruise.
The argument went nowhere and John had to painfully accept that there were some things that he could never change.
No. Please no.
“I thought your… friend… was helping you keep occupied” she rolled her eyes.
But the lost boy had been found…
Silence was a known enemy of hers. It allowed her thoughts to race and spiral out of control. It made the memories seep through…
No questions were spoken… but his brow furrowed, his face showing it well enough.
Without hesitation; eagerly even, Sherlock offered his wrists to him. He; himself doing a bad job of seeming uninterested…
“There’s another debate, he won’t be needed for all of it. He’ll have time to sneak off” he was still speaking to himself.
“Of course I did, she was good but not that good; sleeping among the homeless… they work for me, remember” he smiled at the army doctor who swallowed hard, struggling internally not to break down. For months he had been so worried about her and what faith she might have met. Why was Holmes such a sodding dickhead about this?
She was dreading going home and having to break the news to her daughter.
John frowned. That was really not fair. It was an all too depressing statistic. And quite frankly it pissed him off that Sherlock could be so cold about that.
His teeth chattered so hard that it made it difficult for the poor man to even speak.
He swirled the finger around as he moved in and out; faster now… until he went back to the first joint and pushed in another finger; slowly widening Sherlock’s rectum…
Sherlock froze and looked to the sleeping man; who groaned in his sleep and turned to his other side.
Just to give him an interlude from this hellish state. And Sherlock only seemed to deteriorate on this road to recovery.
“Oh Leila.” He rolled his eyes at her. She was crying rather helplessly.
But just in case…
She rolled her eyes.
John seemed to have his own needs to fulfil…
“No” He simply uttered, finally breaking the silence. His eyes burned into Sherlock’s.
“I write and paint sometimes, but I used to dance before…” she bit into her tongue; stopping herself. The underlying sadness was evident in her voice.
Watson simply blinked.
Oh fuck. Fuck.
He finished his reply and hit send, opening the next ‘heart-breaking’ case in email form. And so passed his day.
Gripped by panic she opened her eyes and looked around the room. Between her legs was a solid shadow being lit up by the flickering TV screen. The shadow was moving and she could slowly focus harder on it. It seemed to be a figure. It was rocking, breathing…
Turning his head to see the pool table he completely lost control of his own two legs.
As if John had read Sherlock’s mind one of his hands found Sherlock’s cock and in an erratic pace he tried to jerk him off as he pounded him.
She gasped; her hips bucking upwards towards him. Her body hungered for pleasure… she had been numb for far too long.
“She sent me a text an hour ago, said she was coming” Lucy replied calmly and leaned against the brick wall and lit another cigarette.
“I got some of the dust in my eyes, I’ve been successful at hiding this box from Mrs. Hudson…” he dismissed the cause of the waterworks. Most of all to himself. This didn’t happen. This was not him. Had he been drugged? Was he ill? His mind was going into overdrive trying to find a likely cause.
He sounded absolutely miserable. Weak. Broken even.
It was a gloomy and much too ordinary Wednesday. In fact it had been a quiet week so far; all too quiet.
“Don’t worry” she reassured him.
Her shoulders hurt so much; the back of her head was throbbing heavily and her cheeks were hot and stinging from all of the slapping. She was glaring angrily at the open bible on the chair; the only furniture in the barely lit room.
The tall man threw himself on the couch, reading the message that was still unsent, unfinished.
“I—Irish R-rose” she stuttered. And internally beat herself up for stuttering. Which never did anything to help that...
Trying to tell him there was no point in trying to fight…
It was far from the best method but she hated the oily feeling of the makeup remover she did own. It always slurred her vision and the thought of that scared her.
She was begging for an end. And end to the searing pain.
There he stood now; looking at his work. His eyes darting from one piece of information to the next. Everything was being organized inside his Mind Palace.
“I’ll text you the details. What are you doing up?” he suddenly turned stern again. “You know I want you rested”
The screen became lighter and she saw it clearer… it seemed to be a man; his face pressed against her inner thigh; rasping his tongue over the cut that was now exposed.
She let him walk away. She wanted to run after him and cling to him; beg him to come back… but it was worthless. She had tried that already…
“Her mother?” Watson remembered.
She looked at him with a dead glare. His words didn’t seem to make sense to her; he might as well be speaking a foreign language it seemed. She looked up at Sherlock.
“Please”
Was that really all it took?
… Though… not horrific in the sense he might have thought.
“Yes, hurt!” John’s own fingers dug into his arm to deflect his own urges.
“You make a grown man lose his mind” he pressed his thumb into her; just below the bone where it hurt.
There she stood; her eyes still closed and her head hanging limp; titled to the side. She almost looked dead already. But it was too soon. He neatly folded her clothes and put them in the corner before he walked up to her and slapped her face as hard as he could to awaken her.
His fingers intertwined with the telephone cord and he heard her voice in a seconds silence from the barking voice that was always present; never leaving him alone.
She heard a grunt as Sally Donovan came in. She looked to her.
She took it; not speaking a word. She shivered. She stuffed it into her pocket.
He watched her through the window as she ordered her signature drink.
I should have known. But I knew. I knew it. Did I not?
The sniffling detective was rigid; taken aback but had no time to push him away… so he remained frozen in Watson’s caring arms.
Sherlock struggled with his silence; chewing on his lip; pressing his head into the sheets under him.
With a few steps forward he was standing right in front of her and gently, too gently, moved her hair away from her face. He brushed the large, flattened pad of his thumb over the bruise; applying enough pressure to make it throb dully.
He attempted a retreat to the palace of his own mind in search of some sort of distraction from this horrendous boredom.
Sherlock had seen John twist and thrash, bathed in sweat before… an awfully pained and desperate look painted on his face. Even screaming himself awake.
John had pulled him aside in the living room; out of the stranger’s earshot. Sherlock’s eyes kept darting towards the kitchen; a fact that made John chew the inside of his cheek.
Sherlock scratched his prickling scalp. It was his only reaction.
Until the next time, Sherlock xoxo’
Standing in front of the door to the room she drew deep breaths as she tried to build the courage to knock on it, or was it courage to run she was looking for?
“If you need money…” he dug into his trousers and produced an envelope.
“Is Kelly on the way?” a boy with long auburn hair poked her sides playfully.
His long, razor sharp fingers reached her throat; his slender arms still growing longer. His hands wrapped around her throat; strangling her slowly. So slowly she was begging him to hurry up and get it over with.
“Let’s get you home” he whispered softly.
A smiley in faded yellow spray paint on the wallpaper peaked up under the chronological line of pictures of the young victims.
“Yes, sort of…” John didn’t know how to explain their relationship. He never really understood it himself and now he understood it even less.
Sherlock’s hips bucked. He had become a lot more sensitive than he was normally.
Ida must have tried to make it onto the cluttered floor… and failed…
“How is this relevant to the case?” John felt sick to his own stomach at the thought.
“You’re sure it was the chain? They looked a bit self-inflicted to me” Molly’s voice was low.
DI Yellow showed up at work early. She had managed a few hours of sleep; most likely caused by pure mental exhaustion.
“She does look young for her age” Watson swallowed hard. He felt uneasy looking at her. Sherlock was absentmindedly running his thumb over a raised scar on her pale arm that was littered with scars and cuts, some fresher than others.
Her fingers barely cooperated as she opened the message. It was him, wasn’t it? Fuck. Please let this have been the first message she prayed… she didn’t want to deal with those consequences.
What she really needed was a long, long and way too hot shower. She wanted to wash all of Paul away from her being.
It had taken a disgruntled Mrs Hudson a day to get the flat back in working order.
The woman looked at the case that was spread out on her desk. Her fingers reached for the coffee cup and she gulped the stale remnants of it down. This would be another long night. Another young woman found naked and strangled. 4 so far. The pictures made her cringe. This reminded her of what made her become a DI back in the day; she wanted to rid the world of the sick and twisted people who did this and put the families of their victims through hell.
“Is Jack nice to you then?” Despite the anger in her daughter’s voice she just wanted to hear her talk. A shrug of the shoulder was all she got.
Why could she not stay strong this time?
“You’re sure the murderer is a man?” John coughed trying to get Sherlock back on track. He knew exactly who Sherlock was referring to and the subject always made him uncomfortable.
“Who found her?” She stood up and tried to look professional just as she had done with the last few new victims of this specific serial killer.
He closed his eyes and felt John practically cling to his taller frame, gently rubbing his back.
Once that flimsy excuse for a security barrier was broken Sherlock went to researching for restaurants around London town. The bar did seem to be a safe spot for her; but it seemed to be a bit too safe for her. Definitely not an advantage for him.
“Tell me to stop” he groaned with the powerful thrust.
“Nope” Sherlock shook his head. “Mira already died once remember?” John’s eyes narrowed and Celia looked at him confused.
Looking at the caller ID he lifted an eyebrow.
“Jesus mum, fine! But only because I’ve got nowhere else to be” She could almost hear her roll her eyes before she hung up.
Once again the man he loved had chosen the drugs over him.
“Really?” John looked at Sherlock wondering what was going on inside his head.
Wait.
And still she couldn’t fight it. She was lost inside the shell of her own body; feeling like she was hammering against her own chest to be let loose.
If you're curious about this particular young woman, you might recognize her from my last fic 'The On-Call Corpse'
John’s lips were so close to Sherlock’s shoulder and he couldn’t resist leaving kisses on the naked skin. He heard the satisfied sigh escape Sherlock’s plump lips and internally mused whether or not to penalize the sound.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” The sergeant repeated his concern.
Poor Molly.
Sherlock had been hired to dig up something unforgivable… and since having economic ties to a child-labour driven factory in Sumatra manufacturing bombs wasn’t bad enough… He had had to dig deeper… and he found her. It had not taken many hours of surveillance to find out that they met a few times through the week in different hotels around London… and that she always looked worse for wear when she left. Despite her best efforts to seem unaffected and appear neutral.
Her heart thumped hard against her chest; but no matter how hard she tried to move her body it laid still, stiff as a board.
What was his name again? Walter? No. William. Like the prince! She made that fact into a mental note.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, flickering rapidly from side to side; panic gripping the detective by the throat.
Instantly her sharpened teeth dropped her thumb.
Returning to the couch John locked eyes with Sherlock.
“There’s been another one” she heard Sargent Donovan say and she swallowed. There it was. That pang of worry. That fear that one day she’d be showing up at a crime scene and it would be her daughter they would cut down from the water pipes.
“Coming?” he winked at the doctor who followed him reluctantly.
“John?” Sherlock tried to lift the spell.
“We’re going to church” Sherlock informed John after an age of silence from him. John stirred and raised an eyebrow. Sherlock’s eyes were trained on the map with the 6 pins in it and had been for the longest while.
“Ida is helping me think!“ Sherlock bellowed.
“Will you do and obey to everything I say?” John’s eyes looked directly into Sherlock’s. They practically bore themselves into his.
She almost felt outside of her body as she padded the blood away and covered up the damage as if it never happened.
In the stall she lifted up her dark dress with shaky hands. Sitting down did hurt as she expected it to and she did all she could not to cry out. Her hip was buzzing from Paul’s hand. He had hit just on the bone; he seemed to know what he did.
Oh the lies you could make yourself believe when you’re desperate enough… The all too brittle straws you grasp at…
“Oh you always do” he grinned, pretty pleased with himself. “They were all strangled by a telephone cord” he informed her and this she nodded at.
“Sherlock?” John looked worriedly at him. This was not his usual Mind Palace state. Something was wrong. John was reminded of the Baskerville case.
He tasted his as well and smiled.
”I’m so c… cold”
“I assume you were there while Mr. Holmes investigated the body of Miss Jensen?” Yellow asked.
“Seeing the girl? Tell her she probably should see her GP. It looked like it was quite a blow she took”
The longest while later he got his wallet out and found a small photograph that he then pinned to the wall next to the pictures of the other victims. Mira Jensen was now part of the statistic.
The horribly easy way out.
Paul would not be happy.
“You need MY time?” it only now dawned on her. He did not have to go to her to get his ‘basic’ needs fulfilled… There were many other places… but he had chosen to come here! To her!
Like a child Sherlock curled up on his side of the bed; his back turned to John, his breathing was fast and his limbs were helplessly restless.
“Oh yes!” Holmes cheered suddenly after reading a text. John was once again trying to calmly read his paper in his chair.  He looked curiously at him. “They’ve found another!” Holmes had a glimmer in his eyes, genuinely thrilled of the prospect of work. This was something John never got quite used to. John knew what this meant.
At the bar sat a woman; one hand constantly held on to her glass. The other continuously strayed to her hair; putting a strand of hair behind her ear, and then freeing it again; combing it down… to then continue the cycle.
John ran towards the sounds; it came from the kitchen. And a horrible sight did await him.
She was a deadweight, all knocked out from the blow to the head. That was not part of the plan. He huffed and puffed as he managed to drag her off down the stairs to the basement under the library. He carefully removed her black clothes before he tied the chain around her wrists and hoisted her up; tying her to the water pipe in the ceiling.
They had found nothing at the scene; nothing other than Kelly Middleton; her clothes, her phone and a chair. No DNA traces; nothing. It was almost unreal. Barely even a footprint was left behind.
“Yes what?” he sounded impatient. Her bottom lip quivered. Please, please don’t be drunk…
This time the dream had been kinder than other times… He hadn’t gotten to the point where he screamed himself awake. Not yet.
“Anything out of place” Sherlock sounded almost annoyed to have to explain anything to the army doctor. They both heard a cough as a minister walked in; obviously having heard that someone was in his church.
Sherlock furrowed his brow; noticing this change of mood… making his own silent deductions.
Oh, he really did.
Suddenly John slowed down inside of him; making long hard strokes as he began to gush; cumming inside of Sherlock’s body and Sherlock felt it; he felt the spurts hit the sensitive walls. And it took him over the edge.
The tall man bowed down and sniffed Mira’s neck, softly moving her hair out of the way. Molly had seen him handle almost as many dead bodies as herself but there was something different with the way he treated this one. And she didn’t like it one bit. He donned gloves and opened her mouth and looked at her teeth.
Sherlock felt bewildered. He felt it… he could feel it. What the hell was John doing to his senses?
“Thank you” she remembered that the man was paying for hers.
“Not talking either” John deduced out loud.
Her throat felt thick with the physical manifestation of a memory.
Tipping the book toward himself he started the mechanism that unlocked and opened the entrance; a bookcase turned outwards revealing the room.
The man’s hands were twitching as he heard her beg for him to leave her alone when he was removing her clothes. It seemed harder this time somehow. The voice in his head was louder than ever before and it seemed so distracting.
“Sherlock!” John raised his voice trying to awaken the frozen man. Holmes shook his head. John’s voice echoing in his mind.
“But,” Sherlock took too long to finish his sentence.
The case of the missing emerald sabre was nearly over; Sherlock Holmes himself had figured it out early on but now the evidence was there to back his words.
“Two of those” was the way he ordered with a wink, pointing at her glass. She had not once let it out of her hand or sight. The tender nodded and went to work with mixing.
“I don’t even know where she spent her nights this week; a few years ago she was my happy little girl… We told each other everything” She took another large gulp and felt the caffeine slowly take effect. “But at least I’ve still got my daughter” she nodded at herself, reminding herself of the task at hand. Greg nodded too. She straightened her back and put on her business face.
“No” she replied, much too quickly. “I’m fine with standing”.
“Be happy, Leila.
The guy had fought the withdrawals so bravely to just give it all up to temptation this way. It really wasn’t fair!
Perhaps it wasn’t the worst thing… considering this need he had for distractions for those pesky urges.
“You’re kidding me! Him!?” She put her hand on her hips defiantly.
Sherlock’s hands were shaking as he got the old shoebox out from under his bed. He was internally cursing his body’s betrayal and only nearly managed to stop the shaking as he heard the items inside the box rattle. He brought it to his kitchen; or rather his lab. Especially when he was on a case. He opened it and sat himself down as he carefully placed the items on the little table space that was left among his mess.
“Do lower your voice!” Sherlock finally emerged from the cupboard that by now was completely empty. “I have never been known to be hard of hard of hearing. My senses are quite remarkably alert” he smugly reminded the army doctor.
“Please let me cum” she found herself begging him desperately. She could not bear it if he should stop now… leave her unfulfilled…
John knew and felt the peril he caused him. Sherlock was practically writhing like a worm in his arms. He let out a chuckle; letting Sherlock know he enjoyed the torture.
And I had to watch you fall. I had to watch you sink to your knees; grabbing at your chest.
Tears streaked her ashen cheeks… Her dark eyes almost black. One hand clutched at her stomach, the other hugging the doorframe to keep herself on her feet… but somehow it didn’t seem connected to the retching she did earlier…
Why, why couldn’t she remember it at the time?
“You need my… time?” she avoided being indelicate. He shuddered.
“So, we’re looking for a man who is unstable, possibly schizophrenic?” John’s mouth was dry as he could not take his eyes off of her face.
“No, we’re not doing this again… forget I even brought it up” John drew a sigh of defiance. It wasn’t going to help the poor soul now. “I’ll leave you to it” Watson was off to bed.
He was fidgeting with the cord in his jacket pocket with one hand as the other placed a rose on the grave in front of him.
“Ida? Oh Ida is…”
“S-sure” there was that silly stutter again…
Her fingers were shaking and she took another swig of the liquor; hoping it would help… even if she did know better than that.
She reached for her drink to deal with the uncomfortable feeling of a pressure she felt in her chest. All her head did was make counter arguments against his words.
“That was…” he seemed to reach for the end of the sentence but found nothing.
Now John finally turned to her; trying to keep her gaze though her eyes could not hold the eye contact for long enough.
“Thought you could do with another” he pointed to the fresh drink standing next to his own that was nearly untouched.
“Leila. I’m afraid must” There was not a single trace of emotion in his voice.
“I don’t know that I am” John mused. Reluctantly he started composing a text; it didn’t take him long to hand it back to the other one.
It was going too well. By the book even; it was perfect.
No. He couldn’t. Not here. Not… not now.
She swallowed one of her pills and washed it down with coffee.
“Why would someone hate a group of people solely for the way that they dressed?” Sherlock asked as if John was still in the room with him.
“Why not?” He shrugged; seeming completely confused at this reaction to his reasoning.
“She was a working girl apparently, I don’t know… who the hell knows when Sherlock Holmes is involved… but she died 4 months ago, overdosed, Holmes found her. Apparently she turned out to be the daughter of Charles Augustus Magnussen” Lestrade shrugged his shoulder and went back to his own office, leaving the female DI with more questions than answers.
The knuckles on his hands turned white as they balled into fists. He was obviously trying to control his temper.
Every time he filled his lungs and held his breath the silence only gave way for the voice at the back of his head.
He turned the page of the holy book and mouthed the words to himself. Her teeth dug into her bottom lip.
“I was instructed to keep you away…” She said, unsure of herself.
“Why would I want to do that?” he turned halfway to face her better. He looked genuinely confused for a second.
The bad habit had started when she wanted to stop her teeth from grinding too hard against each other – an action she could not stop when she did actually manage to sleep, or when she passed out.
“J-John?” Holmes’ usually assertive tongue twisted and he stuttered.
Celia had not slept at all when she showed up at work; she had tried to hide the dark rings under her eyes with makeup but Greg looked straight through her when he handed her the coffee which had become a ritual by now.
He needed to get out of this messed up place.
Some things even he had no control over… and it was shameful for him to admit to.
The word was barely audible as it made it past his reluctant lips.
Just another day that melted into the miserable cesspool that was her lonely life.
All that remained was the ice.
“Yep, Schizophrenic and ultra religious, very dangerous combination” Holmes said as he carefully laid the young woman back down on the slab. Almost lovingly rearranging her hair. Molly’s hands were shivering and she was chewing on her bottom lip. Yes. She was jealous. “I’m going to need that report on her stomach content, text me” his steely green eyes looked sternly into Molly’s and out of the door he was. Watson right behind. Leaving the pathologist flustered once again. Alone with the body of a young woman she so envied despite her state.
The female DI tried hard not to show her emotions as her only daughter abruptly hung up on her. Holmes was watching her closely from a distance. She could not let him see her moment of weakness. She couldn’t afford that.
Only when Sherlock’s body made the very last convulsion and the last spurt of cum shot from his cock did John withdraw himself; slipping out of him.
Another black clad young woman, clinging to her faux fur coat, shielding herself from the ever present cool air, was on her way to her ‘bed’ for the night. If you could call a cold, wet and broken mattress among homeless people that. She stopped dead in her tracks and took a long detour when she noticed the well-known outline of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson ahead.
“Killer might return to St. James. -SH” Her brow furrowed and she looked to the map and realized the church was right in the middle of the 7 pins. She soon after sent officers to the church to talk to the minister and set up a surveillance plan to record who used the church.
“And Hillary?”
Eventually Sherlock agreed with himself that it was probably best for John’s own sake… the hug. He had always seemed to indulge in those things… so even when his senses slowly started to surface he fought the impulse to shove him away.
She resembled a frightened deer. Okay. That was as far as he got.
“Why you?” and in that same moment he invited her back into his precious Mind Palace.
“Cat? Short for Catherine… or like a furry one?” he chuckled; still attempting to make her feel at ease with him.
She hadn’t even bothered trying to cover it with makeup. When she was much younger she had tried to do the same; she had invested in so many products… and the marks still showed. It was only a painful process. And she had already caused herself enough pain.
Exiting the pub, he held out his hand to her but she shook her head. That kiss on the hand was as far as he got tonight if she had any say in the matter.
“You are then”
“Lucy?” a voice she had not expected answered her.
“Ah, you’re expected. Room 204, that’s second floor and just to the right, Miss de Maagd” the red-haired receptionist kindly informed her; pointing towards the lift.
Had she done something to offend her? Of course that had to be it. The silent treatment. She would come ‘round soon. It wouldn’t be the first time one had misunderstood the other.
Had she not been so nervous she might have found him attractive with his pearly white teeth, dark curls and that neatly fitted suit.
The answer was a solemn nod.
He made several mental notes of sentences… sentences he worried he wouldn’t be able to say with a straight face. How on earth did John manage to keep that up?
It was tough for me to write and has caused a few tears. Also while I have been proof-reading it; so I sincerely apologize for any mistakes.
She got her pills from her jacket and swallowed one, cleared her throat and watched the forensic team secure what they could from the young woman. No hope of as much as the slightest fingerprint, obviously. Too much to hope for.

Hearing him quickly unbuckle his belt and undo his fly and the rip of a condom didn’t soothe her. She felt her very insides twist and clench. As if that would ever do anything stop him…
“She was slapped?” She spoke, feeling his breath on her face. She struggled not to blush.
Sherlock closed the laptop; him having been halfway through an article that had given him no real knowledge anyhow.
Cat smiled; trying to look as grateful as possible… pretending she didn’t know the inner workings of hotels by now.
Watch me!
This poor man had seen battles; and John had only joined him on a mere fraction of them. That much he knew.
“Oh I will” he spoke minutes later when he was handed a file containing what they had so far. He walked off then but not before he said hello to Geoff; whose real name was Greg.
His eyes shuffled and she noticed him uncomfortably straightening himself.
She was dreading him showing off around a poor dead girl. Someone’s daughter… someone’s daughter. No. Wait. She had barely hung up when she called her own daughter. To her surprise she picked up. Oh thank god. Even though Lucy shortly after grumpily ended the conversation; at least it wasn’t her.
“Susie wanted to, but I knew her father and he would have killed me if he found out” he sighed sadly “We were always just friends”. She could tell he was getting a bit emotional.
John took a look at the young woman and his jaw fell open.
“5 young girls are dead and you do not want my help, why?” his narrow eyes looked through to her soul. He had noticed the fresh evidence on her desk, insinuating yet another victim.
“Kelly!” the old man called out to her angrily. The teenager was not looking back, she had other things on her mind. Little did he know this was the last time he would get to talk to his daughter.
“Normal…” Sherlock grunted, the brim of his nose crinkling in frustration.
“A few days, judging by the colour, hard to tell on the screen and in that light… uhm, is that her?” John shuddered uncomfortably.
“I told you no!” she cringed.
It was much too good to pass up.
She swallowed and nodded; knowing well she wasn’t granted permission to speak… trying to remember all his changing whims to avoid his wrath.
Resisting the urge to throw her phone at the wall in disgust more than anger Cat stumbled back to her feet and dried her eyes; expertly she rid her face of any trace of emotions.
It was the son; coerced by his fraternity ‘brothers’.
In a frantic panic, she patted her hands down over her body… finding that it was still intact; despite the fact she could still feel the damage. But the only visible damage was the bruises from earlier and that cut… still patched up and still it’s original size.
“In a few years you won’t be able to get rid of her, just you wait and see!” he let her know before he went back to his office. She got herself the first pain killer of the night and went back to trying to sort out the sparse evidence.
And now it seemed useful.
Her pinkie finger twitched helplessly.
“T-thank y-you f… for t-t-tonight” no matter how hard she tried to calm herself; her teeth her were chattering loudly against each other.
“Lucy, I don’t care what you’re doing tonight, just call. I won’t be mad” she let the machine know.
“How?” She was caught off guard.
She could not stop her teeth from digging into her cracked bottom lip this time. She saw right through his façade but it scared her all the same.
“I need a soft spot” Holmes grunted as the group was now out of sight. The cab taking a turn.
“Where is it!” Holmes’ desperate voice was muffled by the wood of the cupboard.
Her hand balled into a fist but she tried hard not to wake the man lying next to her. She wasn’t in the mood for his needs and he didn’t even know what had happened.
“Stalking me?” she attempted a terrible joke.
“A phone number?” He deduced; oh always that need to verbally state the obvious. “It was a success then?” the silence from his taller friend gave him pause to talk.
She had won the control.
The minute the blood started flowing she felt lighter; lighter than air even as if it was liquid lead that was oozing from her body. Her lips parted and she licked them.
Oh how she wanted the power to slow down time, just to relish him… this was all moving too fast… soon he would be gone… again…
Seeing a shadow move she was brought back to the anxiety and dialled… and it was ringing… and ringing.
She found it with the pile of clothes and found the message the best she could with gloved fingers.
Her pale face flushed and her lips formed a smile out of relief… and something more.
Only she could manage to forget to take prescribed pain relief for a severe and painful chronic back ailment…
“Have I made a mistake?” she faced Greg who shook his head at her and smiled kindly.
Didn’t he know by now it was useless? And couldn’t he at least come up with something less obvious than ‘QuoFataVocant’?
“What happened? You sounded upset” his eyes didn’t leave hers even if she tried to turn hers towards the floor.
He had merely changed his mind temporarily due to a display of waterworks… though this time Sherlock had not been in control…
Without trouble he flipped Sherlock over and undid the scarf; throwing it to the floor before he crawled up to put his lips on Sherlock’s in a long lingering kiss; his eyes looking fondly into Sherlock’s.
Sherlock went to take a quick shower and changed into one of his best suits; douching himself in the same aftershave he had worn the night before. He figured familiarity and consistency would be his strongest asset with the slightly neurotic woman he was trying to woo.
It wasn’t though. She got a quick glance at the man before he shoved her into the black van and drove off with her.
She closed her eyes firmly and tried to guide her breathing… slowly… one breathe in… hold… slowly out…
Her shoulders had been dislocated for a while now and her sobbing only got louder, echoing against the thick walls back to her. For once she could not stop; she had lost control over herself and the harder she tried to regain that control the harder she cried. She didn’t mind the pain. But she felt more alone than ever.
Another glass shattered and a cupboard was slammed shut with force.
“Lucy still acting out?” The man pointed with his own cup. She nodded.
How she wished he’d just throw her on the bed and get it out of the way. But he had to be slow… painfully slow. He enjoyed the torture and the control more than the actual sex…
Step one completed. This should be easy.
The cold lube trickled down over Sherlock’s opening that had already started gasping from the stimulation that had already been applied to Sherlock’s mind and body.
“Sherlock. What happened this time?” she took a step towards him.
The man then threw his phone at his friend who skilfully caught it in mid-air. This was not the first time there had been such an exchange.
“You know her?” Celia looked curiously at the two men. Sherlock didn’t move a muscle. He looked almost like a deer stuck in headlights.
“I’m sorry Lucy, I really am” the woman tried to reach out to her daughter but she only took a step back, out of reach.
“Bart’s Morgue, DI Yellow finally saw sense!” he was smug. He knew she would crack sometime, they always did. They always needed his expertise.
“Ah, Hello Molly!” Holmes greeted the woman with long brown hair in a high ponytail who was just starting her shift at St. Bart’s morgue. She had her hands on a human heart she was about to dissect and nearly dropped it.
