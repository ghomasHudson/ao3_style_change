It’s quiet for a moment and then Bucky narrows his eyes at Steve. “Nice try distractin’ me with Nat, but you’re not gettin’ out of tellin’ me about what happened with Tony.”
“Steve,” Tony pants, pulling away. “Steve. It’s never, I’ve never.” He looks at Steve and sees a matching desire in his eyes.
Dismissing Roth for the evening, Steve leaves his rooms and takes his time walking to the harem quarters. He's glad he does because he needs the time to try and calm his nerves as well as try and figure out what Tony could have planned.
Bruce works the soap into Tony’s hair and shares a knowing look with Clint. Tony’s feelings for Steve are a frequent topic of conversation for everyone in the harem. It’s not just Tony’s feelings they gossip about either. For a while now, Steve’s increasingly obvious attraction to Tony has also been part of the conversation. Rhodey and Bucky have suggested locking them in a closet together while Bruce and Sam are more of the mind to give them time to figure themselves out.
“You’re wonderful, sweetheart. I know you were nervous about using a blindfold, but you’ve done so well. I love having your trust in this.”
It’s on the tip of Steve’s tongue to sass Tony back, but the more he thinks on it, the more he realizes he really wouldn’t mind carrying Tony around. He kisses Tony’s temple and hugs him close. Tony's arms go around him and Steve would swear he feels him press a kiss to his chest.
Tony pulls away and takes the note from his pocket. He hands it over, knowing Rhodey won’t read it, and smiles. “Thanks.”
He's trying to think of ways to try and get Bucky and Bruce to give him something when the clock begins to chime the hour. He's hopeful that is the signal, but when neither Bruce nor Bucky move, he sinks back into the cushions. It's not a minute later when the door opens, admitting Jarvis.
“What am I going to do?” Bucky motions for Steve to go on, thinking he already has an idea. Instead, Steve feels his mind empty of any and all thoughts. “What am I going to do? Oh my god, Buck, what am I going to do? I’ve never done this before? How do I tell him?”
Steve grabs Bucky by the shoulders and looks him in the eye. He doesn’t know how he didn’t see it before. He’s always known the way he feels about Tony is different from everyone else, but he never clued into the fact that those were romantic feelings.
“Yours.” Tony knows there are going to bruises along his hips and he can’t wait. “Yours. Your Tony.”
He brings the shield to the backroom to dry and presses a kiss to the edge of it. It's silly to think something as simple as a kiss will add anything to the shield, but Tony chooses to believe he's adding a little something to its protective qualities. Here in the back, it’ll tucked away from prying, princely, eyes and should, hopefully, be completely dry by tomorrow. He’s just about to turn and go back to the forge when it hits him that this is so much more than a courting gift. Tony knows the moment he gives it to Steve, it will be a sign he wishes to be engaged, that he wants to marry Steve. Instead of the doubt, he expects to follow that thought, Tony feels joy. He feels excitement. He wants all of this to culminate in a marriage. He laughs as he realizes he’s wanted all of this to end with him and Steve being married eventually. He wants to rule at Steve’s side and be his partner in life.
He reaches for a dish to begin serving and his eyes go wide when Steve takes it from him. “Let me. Please?”
Nerves make Tony fidget even more and he spreads his arms out toward the food. “A gesture? Bigger than what I’ve done this week, but I thought it could be a bit of a beginning? I didn’t actually cook, promise. Happy did all of that. Only kicked me out of the kitchen once.” One of Steve's eyebrows goes up and Tony laughs. “Okay, okay, it was twice.” Steve continues to stare and Tony rolls his eyes. "Fine, it was three times. I wanted it all to be perfect."
“Hi, yourself.” Steve kisses Tony’s forehand and the tip of his nose and then his mouth. “You were amazing, tonight. I know blindfolds are hard for you and I’m so proud and impressed with you.”
Bucky pushes his way inside and picks up the glass of whiskey from the table where Steve left it. He takes a big swallow and turns his attention back to Steve. “You’re kidding right?”
The last flower Tony points at is another pink one, but different from the first. Steve steps into the grass and picks both flowers. He brings them to Tony and adds them to the daisy in his hand.
“It’s perfect. I love it.” He kisses Tony again, not noticing that he’s begun to lower his arm. “It is the best gift I have ever received.”
This time, both Bruce and Bucky snort. Bruce pats Steve's arm. "You are patient about many things, Steve, but not Tony."
Sarah gasps as a crown made of stars appears on Steven’s forehead. She never would have imagined her son would be so important. Brooklyn is still a small kingdom, almost inconsequential amongst the rest. How could her son be so important? She looks over to Margaret and the glow around her gets brighter until she has to close her eyes against the light.
So sorry for not posting yesterday. Between dog sitting and babysitting, everything else just kind of fell out of my head.
Tony opens his eyes and turns his head toward the sound. “It’s me. Planning on joining me, Bruce, or just standing and watching?”
In the bedroom, Steve sets out a pair of blue silk sleep pants and nothing else. He knows Tony will come out and see them on the bed and smile because of the color choice. He changes himself into his own silk pants and holds Tony’s collar in his hand, thumb moving over the leather.
Steve swoops in and kisses him, enjoying the taste of blueberry. “Had to have your favorites didn’t I?”
Steve snorts at the pout on Tony’s face. “You want my cock, baby? Want it in your mouth. Down your throat?”
“First, you take a deep breath.” Once Steve has done that, Bucky pushes him into a chair. “Good. Now, I think you should court him. Make your intentions known. Give him little gifts to show you’re thinking of him. Bring him a treat when he’s working in the forge. Those sorts of things.”
Once the shock wears off at the suggestion, Tony burrows as close as he can to Steve. With his head on Steve’s chest, Tony can hear the strong, steady beat of his heart and he already feels at ease. “You have the best ideas, charming.”
When Steve’s adds a third finger, it’s Tony’s hips jerking and Steve grins. “So close, baby. Just a little more. You’re always so right and I love it.”
“Jarvis, lights at 15%.” When the lights dim, Steve starts sliding the blindfold off. “Close your eyes, baby. Don’t wanna blind you.”
Moving from around Steve, Tony gets his first look at the place where his prince slept for 70 years. The room, itself, is bright and airy and Tony’s jaw drops as he looks around. He can see how a place like this would lead someone, especially someone like Steve, to come back again and again.
“I don’t mind the grease,” Steve teases. If he were honest with himself, he’d admit just how true those words are. He loves seeing Tony in his element. When he’s covered in grease and grime, forge glowing behind him, Tony is incandescent. “So long as you’re sitting next to me at dinnertime, I’ll be happy.”
“Stand, Tony.” Tony stands and lists to the side since one leg fell asleep. Steve stands and holds him steady. “Wake it up, sweetheart. Do we need to walk a little? Work Out the pins and needles?”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Sure, sure.” His stomach growls and he laughs. “Okay, new topic. Where are you taking me for this picnic?”
Jarvis holds Tony by the shoulders. “I have been with you since the day you were born, sir. I have watched you grow and learn and regardless of everything you have been through, you have the kindest and most generous heart I have ever seen. When we came here, you blossomed and came into yourself and stopped hiding who you were. It is easy to be confident in you when you have proven time and again to be deserving of such confidence.”
The final win goes to Steve and he fights hard for it. His strategy was sound, but so was Tony’s. When he can finally declare, "checkmate," there were only a few pieces left on the board. Tony had had a pawn a square away from winning back one of his own pieces when Steve had finally managed to corner his king and get the checkmate.
For everyday, Tony wears Steve’s dog tags on a slim chain under his shirt. For the most part, Tony forgets about them, but when he’s feeling stressed or annoyed, he can press his hand to them and think of Steve and take a moment to really breathe.
“Hmm?” Tony’s eyes wanted to close, but he blinks a few times to try and stay awake. “Dinner, probably.”
Once he has the food spread out, he calls out, “Tony?” There’s no response, so he calls out again. “Tony!”
“Talk as you eat. I know how much food Tony had brought up. You cannot be that starved, and I will not have Clint come prancing out with that grin he gets when he knows something I don’t.”
“Thank you, Steve.” There are still flowers leftover, so Tony picks them up and begins wrapping them just like Steve had shown him. “Help me make one for you?”
“Yes, yes. On the top of the head. I remember.” Bucky points a finger at Steve. “That wasn’t what I meant. And you know it. No one has ever made you feel the romantic stuff. The butterflies in your stomach. The uncertainty that comes from wondering if they feel the same for you. The stuff I feel for Clint and Nat. How sometimes, all it takes is hearing Clint laugh or catching Tasha in an unguarded moment for me to want to kiss them. Do you feel that with Tony?”
The hot water does a lot to soothe the soreness Tony is feeling in his arms. While he was working, he didn't notice how tense and sore they were, but now that he's stopped, he can feel the way his muscles are aching. He leans against Clint and lets out a sigh of relief. Tucked away in the smithy, he’d let himself focus on nothing but his project. Now that he’s here with his friends, though, he realizes how much he craves their company.
Clint was probably Tony’s third favorite person after Steve and Bruce. If anyone else asked, Tony would bat his eyelashes and smile as he proclaimed they were all equal after Steve.
“To cuddle?” Tony waits for Steve to lay down and then joins him, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “Then yes. This is perfect.”
Steve looks at himself in the mirror and twists and turns to get a good look. The waistcoat Roth picked out is a beautiful sapphire with a little light embroidery done in shimmering threads. He looks good and he hopes Tony thinks so as well. “I'm ready.”
Roth and Jarvis are waiting for them at the doors, both impatient to get them ready. The valets take one look at them and shake their heads, knowing exactly what they'd gotten up to. Roth takes Steve up to change while Jarvis pretends to do the same. As soon as Steve and Roth are out of sight, Jarvis straightens Tony's jacket and goes to visit his wife. Tony hurries to his forge to collect his gift. He checks the shield over one last time, even though he knows it's perfect. The metal itself is shining and bright and Tony gives one last yank on the leather straps to make sure he's attached them securely. Jarvis has also left him a shirt and waistcoat to change into and Tony could jump for joy.
He’s almost at the door when he turns back around and runs to Jarvis. He wraps his arms around the older man and hugs him tight. “Thank you, Jarvis.”
As the years passed, Sarah and Joseph watched their son grow and tried their best to let him enjoy being a child. He remained small and sickly through his childhood, but that never deterred him from doing his best to be just like his father. He’d follow Joseph to the training yard, picking up sticks as he went to be his sword. There were a few advisors and knights who tried to dissuade their king from letting the prince be in the yard, but Joseph didn’t listen. Instead, he chose a few of his most trusted and would bring Steven to a quieter corner and show him how best to wield his stick sword.
Tony takes his time showering, letting the hot water soothe sore and tight muscles. He does as he’s told and uses Steve’s shampoo and conditioner and body wash. It feels nice and he can imagine Steve under the water with him, hands roving over wet skin, whispering all sorts of praise and sweet words.
He studies the cufflinks in the bowl, taking a little time to try and compose himself. He knows he still won’t be able to fool Natasha, he's never been able to, but he still needs the moment. When he turns around, Natasha hasn't moved and she motions for him to lift his chin. Her fingers are nimble as she unties his cravat and Tony can't help but smile.
“Very.” Bucky stands and drapes his arm over Steve’s shoulders. “How long have you felt it? And more importantly, why are you denying it? Tony isn’t Rumlow. Pretty sure they’re complete opposites. I mean, Tony does talk a lot, but not about himself. But about his projects and science and things he finds interesting. Which includes you by the way.”
Tony lifts his hand and finds Steve’s cheek. “Little bit of stubble there, sir.” He smiles. “I like it.”
Turning his head, Steve kisses Tony’s brow. “You are this beautiful. This is how you look to me, Tony.” He flips through the pages and finds a sketch of Tony in his forge. “You are stunning.”
Tony sinks into the act of sucking Steve. It becomes a circle of endless pleasure as Steve continues to finger him, his other hand holding Tony’s head in place as he fucks up into his mouth
Once they’re dressed, Clint takes Tony’s hand and gives it a squeeze. They continue chatting as they walk out of the baths and when they emerge, Clint leaves Tony at the stairs with a wink and a kiss on the cheek. Bucky and Natasha are should be waiting for him. They’d been on a scouting mission the past few days and Clint was more than a little eager to see them. Tony watches him go and finds himself hoping that he can have that someday. Hopefully with Steve.
Dressed in just a pair of comfortable trousers, he finds a mirror and a razor to clean up his goatee. He’d tried the full beard once and hated how itchy it was. He’d also hated how long it took to go from patchy to actually covering his face. Rhodey had been the one to suggest just a goatee and it had been Tony’s own imagination that had pushed him to try different designs and styles. After some laughs from his friends and even Steve, he managed to settle on a style he liked and wasn't too difficult to clean up when needed.
“What?” Clint nudges Tony to sit up and cups his face in his hands. “Talk about burying the lead, Tones. When did this happen? What kind of kiss was it? Was it like this?” He kisses Tony’s forehead the same way Natasha likes to do. “Or like this?” He moves to kiss Tony’s temple. “Give me all the details.”
It always amazes Tony how Natasha just seems to know that he wants his cufflinks off first once his jacket is gone. He holds out one arm and then the other and accepts the cufflinks from her when she’s finished.
On the night when it’s going to happen, Steve and Tony have both decided to keep any surprises or changes to a minimum.
Blindfolds have been a limit for Tony for a while now, but he trusts Steve and Steve’s promised to keep the lights on and to stay close. Tony knows that all he has to do is utter the word, “newton,” and the blindfold will come off.
Tony opens his mouth and his hips buck as he realizes it’s Steve’s fingers. He sucks on the digits, tongue moving over them and collecting every stray bit of honey. He wants more. He wants his sir’s cock. Wants to feel the weight of it on his tongue and have Steve’s hand in his hair setting the pace. He sucks harder on Steve’s fingers, hoping he’ll get the message.
There is something comforting about having a plan and as Steve listens to Bucky’s ideas, he feels more settled. He can do this. He can court Tony. Tony has to feel the pull too. Steve has noticed him rubbing at his chest more than a few times and he wonders if he was feeling the same things Steve was.
Blushing, he looks over at Steve. “Thank you. Will you tell me about your day? I feel like I’ve been doing all the talking. Tell me what our dear prince gets up to when we’re all busy.”
“I can do that.” The shield is so close to being finished, so it should be a simple matter to make sure he is around more when Steve is looking for him. “Do you really think he feels the same for me, Nat?”
Lifting Tony’s chin, Steve pecks Tony on the lips. “I know. I’m so mean. But you’re going to eat for me aren’t you, baby. Take each little morsel from my fingers.”
While Pierce continues spilling his guts, Steven edges closer, hand moving slowly for the dagger hidden in his sleeve. Unfortunately, Pierce is paying closer attention than Steven realized and before he can pull his dagger, Pierce has a blade at his throat. In his free hand, he holds a small vial and there is a darkness in his eyes when he tells Steven that all it will take is a swallow and Steven will just be a pretty, empty-headed doll for him to play with.
“Okay, yes. That’s good.” Eyes locking with Jarvis’s, Tony takes a deep breath. “It’s going to go well, right?”
“Thinking about it.” Steve dips his fingers in the honey and brings them to Tony’s lips, watching as it drops onto his chest. “No biting. Just tongue.”
It doesn’t take Tony long to provide Steve with plenty of flowers to finish the crown. Steve picks out the ones he thinks will look best, glancing up every so often to look at Tony. As he winds the last stem, he smiles, Tony is leaning back on his hands looking out into the field with a soft smile of his own. He's absolutely stunning like this. So relaxed and happy. When Steve drops the crown on his head, his hands go up to touch and his smile gets brighter.
“Yes, yes. But still a kiss. Especially when it's our prince. I have never seen him kiss anyone but his mother before.” She takes his arm and leads him to the wardrobe. “Now tell me what happened in your words, while I act as your valet. My hawk was too excited to give me details.”
Steve laughs. One of his favorite things is when Tony rambles like this. He’s tempted to keep quiet and see how long he’ll keep going but, one look at Tony and his very visible nerves has him deciding against it. “Tony. It all looks wonderful.”
They get the board set up and Tony makes his first move. The game starts slowly, with both Tony and Steve watching each other to try and make out what strategy the other is going for. Tony always tries to make his choices seem random and without thinking, hoping to keep Steve guessing. He has a strategy, but he hopes Steve doesn't pick up on it until it's too late. Steve, on the other hand, is much more controlled and focused. He watches every move Tony makes and chooses his strategy from there.
“It was the same for me.” Steve hugs Tony close, burying his nose in dark hair that has gotten long enough to start to curl over his ears. “I very nearly tossed you over my shoulder and brought you back to the castle then and there.”
“You’ve been so good tonight. You’re going to get on the couch. On your knees and you’re going to suck me while I get you nice and open for me. And then…” Steve lets his words trail off.
“Preachin’ to the choir, Stevie.” The whiskey is smooth as Bucky swallows and it warms him through. “She’s always had a soft spot for Tony too. I thought it was because he and Clint were so close, but she just scoffed when I suggested it.” He takes another sip and frowns. “Didn’t even tell me the real reason.”
Steve lets go of his hand, and Tony walks to where the queen is waiting. She pulls him into a tight hug and Tony lets himself melt into it for a moment before pulling away. “I’m ready.”
Steve’s fingers move over Tony’s back and sides in soothing circles. “I think that can be arranged. You’ve got a bit of a strength kink I don’t mind indulging.”
“Hey, there, Petey Pie. Look what papa’s got for you.” Steve holds the bottle over Peter and the big brown eyes Steve loves, open and focus on him. Peter takes a few gasping breaths and reaches tiny arms toward his papa. Steve knows he could also be reaching for the bottle, but he chooses to believe his son wants him more.
Peter is already starting to drift off on Steve’s shoulder and he knows if he moves now, they’re in for a long night with a fussy baby. “Shut up.” Tony starts to laugh and Steve shoves him. Tony keeps laughing and flops back on the pillows. “Help me. Please? Peter’s already out.”
“I remember. She chopped her hair off and borrowed some clothes from the laundry.” Eyes closed, Steve can still remember the shock on her face when she saw Steve was sparring with his men. “She was ready to bolt before you tossed her a staff and told her to face off with you.”
The fact that Tony came to visit his mother for help makes Steve very happy. When the harem had first begun taking shape, the people he invited had been scared to approach the queen in fear it would be seen as overstepping. Sarah had quickly fixed that by coming to see them instead and since then, she frequently had visitors from everyone in the harem. Tony had always been one of her favorites and he had come to her for help courting Steve. It was endearing and sweet and Steve was glad Tony knew his mother not only approved of what he was doing but that she was also happy to offer her help.
Steve nods, heart in his throat. The only people who have seen his work have been his parents. The portrait of his father currently hanging in his mother’s chambers is his work. He’d asked her to not tell anyone he’d painted it and up until now, he’d been happy keeping his painting to himself. It had become his preferred way of dealing with his emotions when it felt like there were too many or they were becoming too complicated. When he’d begun planning this picnic, he’d gone back and forth about showing this to Tony, but he'd known this would be the perfect time to show Tony this part of him.
“Oh my dearest boy, of course, I do. He is a good man and you always light up when he is near.” She beckons him closer. “Now come. Pick something out.” She points to a couple of boxes. “I think these would suit Anthony quite well and shouldn’t impede with his work, but get a good look and pick what you feel is right.”
“I’m perfect, sweetheart.” He reaches into the basket and pulls out the box. “There’s actually something I want to ask you.”
The sound of Steve’s voice startles Tony from his thoughts and he idly wonders if he's somehow summoned him with his thoughts. He checks on the shield one more time, wanting to be sure it's securely on the shelf and won't be seen.
Instead, he pulls away gently, and, like Steve had just moments before, he presses his lips to his knuckles. "Goodnight, my prince."
They stay on their floor for the scene. Steve wants them somewhere comfortable. Somewhere Tony feels safe. Their playroom is also a safe place, but it also comes with other expectations for different kinds of play and Steve wants the night to be about them and Tony’s trust in him when it comes to the blindfold.
Tony steps into the room, arms crossed over his stomach. Steve frowns. He doesn’t want Tony feeling self-conscious and insecure.
He fixes a bottle and gets it warming, eyes fixed on the microwave as the bottle turns. Peter continues wailing and Steve winces as the volume increases. “I’m coming, honey. I’m coming.”
“It’s okay, Stevie. Breathe. With me.” Steve’s breathing slows even further, but he’s still trembling. “In and out, Stevie. I know it’s scary. You’ve never wanted that with anyone before. Of course, it’s making you nervous. You know Tony would never push you, though, right? You could take it slow with each other and he wouldn’t make fun or make you feel bad.”
Steve pulls Tony’s earlobe between his teeth. “Oh, don’t worry. I plan to. You’re mine aren’t you, Tony?”
Steve has noticed and he knows his blush says it too. The way Tony’s whole being brightens when Steve praises him is an extra bonus. He makes Tony happy and he gets to see that smile that lights up a whole room, what isn’t there to love?
Helping Tony onto the couch, Steve is thankful for how big and plush it is. He strips off his own pants and looks at Tony on his knees just waiting. “Ready for me, baby?”
“Gorgeous.” He pulls Tony off his cock and gasps at just how red and swollen his lips are. “You beautiful man. Sucking my cock like a fucking champ. Feel my fingers in you?” He thrusts them in hard. “Holding you open for me. Keeping you ready for my cock.”
“I know that, Buck.” Steve grimaces at the sharpness in his voice. “Sorry.” He takes a deep breath and lifts his head to look Bucky in the eye. “There was still this moment, right when I first woke up.” The memory plays in his head and Steve hates that it still has such a prominent place in his mind. “I saw him and he smiled at me and I hoped maybe he was the one.”
Biding his time, the prince continues acting as though he is unaware of Rumlow’s act. When they arrive, he plays innocent and naive, looking around with wide eyes and remarking on the splendor. Rumlow is satisfied that his act is still working and wastes no time bringing Steven straight to the king.
“No,” Steve whispers. “Let me do it. I want to. Really” He says half-heartedly, watching Tony get off the bed and bring the bassinet over to Steve’s side of the bed. “Get back in bed, Tony. I’ll lay Peter down in a minute. I’m enjoying this moment.”
“No, they’re really not.” Steve watches Tony, overjoyed that he’s not panicking. “They’re beautiful. Red and gold suits you so well.”
Sarah takes his face in her hands and brings his head down for her to kiss. “I know, dearest. But as your mother, you will always be my little one. Your father would be so proud of the man you’ve become.”
Steve has his face tipped up to the sun and is enjoying the warmth on his cheeks when he hears the tell-tale sound of Tony's steps. It's clear he's in a rush, even though he hasn't used all of his fifteen minutes. Tony comes close to barreling straight into him, but Steve is prepared. Pleased he’d had the forethought to set the picnic basket down, Steve reaches out and manages to grab Tony’s arm and pull him close.
Coulson shoos him off with the promise of keeping everyone in line. Steve laughs. Keeping people in line is definitely not an issue for Coulson. It’s one of the reasons Steve promoted him to head of the guard. He’s fair, but tough and always makes sure the guard is up to whatever task is set in front of them. Steve's only hesitance is that he knows his mother will ask the same questions as everyone else, but she'll also know with one look if Steve is holding anything back. She'll have no problem digging deeper and having him tell her exactly what he is feeling.
Steve reluctantly lets himself be led to the sitting room, but he’s not truly listening to a single word Bruce and Bucky are saying. He looks over his shoulder, hoping that maybe, just maybe, whatever signal Bruce and Bucky are waiting for will happen before they get too far. When that is not the case, he takes a seat when he feels Bucky push on his shoulder and his foot bounces as he peeks up at the clock.
The path Steve leads them down is one no one but a select few are aware of. As they get further away from the castle, he can see the wonder on Tony's face and he wants to preen a little that he put it there. He likes that he can impress and surprise Tony like this. They walk a little further and the path narrows and they are surrounded by tall grass and a few trees. There are wildflowers everywhere and their scent is thick in the air, turning it sweet and tempting Steve to have their picnic here. Reminding himself of his plan, he kicks a branch out of the path. He'd hate for Tony to fall, even if it would mean the chance to carry him back home. Ever since he tripped and sprained his ankle once, he's made sure to keep the path clear.
A little light seeps through the fabric of the blindfold but other than that, Tony can see nothing. He’s reliant on his hearing and other senses to know where Steve is.
"If you wanted a clue, you should have tried to make a break for it and find Clint. Natasha is sitting on him in our rooms to keep him from talking."
Steve grins and runs his hand through his hair. “She never asked again after that. I think she knew how I was feeling. She always seems to have a sixth sense about what I'm feeling," he adds in a low voice. "Once the month had passed, I started coming back here more often. Took me another month before I finally got rid of the bed and the other things that had been in the room while I slept. I replaced most of it with other furniture and turned this into a place where I could hideaway and catch my breath.”
When Tony hears the knock on the door, he half expects Steve to just burst into the room without waiting for Tony to say anything. When he doesn’t, Tony is confused. These are Steve's rooms, Tony really didn't think he'd wait to come in. Maybe it’s not Steve? He calls out and fidgets where he stands. There's no response and he frowns.
“I’m glad. I thought of having something else waiting for you, but I know how much you enjoy Happy’s lemon shortbread. And he’d just gotten a fresh batch of lemons in, so they’d be sweet, but still tart, and…” The words trail off and Tony blushes. “And I’m rambling.”
The strawberry has stained Tony’s lips an even deeper red and he has to force himself to look away. His gaze lands back on the picnic basket and the small box he tucked into the corner. It’s not how he planned it, but he doesn’t want to wait anymore.
Steve’s fingers trace designs over Tony’s back. “I think that can be arranged. Thank you for answering honestly. I’m proud of you. Ready to begin?”
The kingdom celebrates its awakening with almost a week’s worth of festivities. When things begin to settle, Rumlow goes to the king and queen and asks if he can bring Steven to his liege in order to gain approval for their marriage. The queen is hesitant, but her son smiles and bats his eyelashes at his knight, seemingly in love with Rumlow now, so she gives her consent, her husband following her lead.
While things had never become romantic between them, (they kissed once and both realized it was too much like kissing family), there had been more than a few nights where Tony had crawled into Clint’s bed and Clint had crawled into Tony’s. Sometimes they just needed someone close who would put an arm around them and let them whisper their worries into the dark. They were both happy to listen and offer whatever comfort they could, and on rare occasions, they just listened and comfort came from knowing someone had heard them.
“Careful. I can get you over my lap for a spanking real quick.” Steve takes a seat next to Tony and pinches a nipple between his finger. “Who’s in charge, sweetheart?”
Tony can imagine it. They’d be in Steve’s studio that day. Tony there for Steve to pose as he wants and needs. “I’d…I’d like that.”
A knock at the door pulls him from the fantasy and he finally gets out of bed. Opening the door, he knows he shouldn’t be surprised to see Bucky standing there, but somehow he is.
The question startles Tony, who had grown used to the sounds of the forge and his own thoughts. He lets out a shout, and drops the heavy file in his hand, narrowly missing his foot. When he lifts his head to see who has managed to sneak up on him, he's not surprised about who he sees. He grins and takes a step to the side to hide his work.
“Yes. Thank you for reminding me.” He narrows his eyes at Clint but keeps smiling. “That wasn’t embarrassing at all.”
“It’s not too hard,” he holds up the bit he’s started and lets Tony examine it. “Help me make this one?”
“You’re going to leave the forge regardless,” Steve comments, leveling a stare at Tony. “We’re going on a picnic.”
Tony climbs out of the bath and, after Clint joins him, they help each other dress. Clint is in his usual purple and he whistles when he sees the deep red of the shirt Tony has chosen. Steve has always liked Tony in red and Tony was happy to fill his wardrobe with every shade of the color.
The memory of the day Steve came is one of Tony’s most prized. Jarvis had led the prince to where Tony was arguing with Obie about marrying his neighbor, Lord Stone. They'd both been screaming and yelling and never heard Jarvis come in until suddenly the prince was right in front of them. The moment Tony had laid eyes on the prince, he’d been sure he was dreaming. There was no way the sleeping prince from all the tales had come for him of all people.
Steve’s hand is on the back of his head and Tony opens his mouth and lets Steve guide him back onto his cock. “Suck, Tony.”
They’re both breathing hard and Steve is peppering Tony’s face with kisses when Peter begins to wail over the monitor. Laughing, Steve carefully pulls out. “So much for the afterglow.”
One look at Rumlow confirms everything Pierce has been saying, and Steven has to fight the need to vomit. It gets even worse since Pierce does not stop talking. He looks Steven up and down and makes an offhand remark about how if Steven chooses to not join him, Pierce will just have to keep him as a pet and share him until he learns his place.
Completely entranced, Tony follows Steve up the stairs. Steve has always been the epitome of bravery to Tony, so he’s not surprised to find out he was brave enough to come back to the place where he’d been cursed. It’s on the tip of his tongue to ask if the bed is still up there, but he realizes how suggestive that sounds and stops himself before he does.
Steve keeps talking and it doesn’t take much more for Tony to follow him over that cliff. He comes hard over his fist and stomach, barely managing to hold back the moan begging to fall from his lips.
“Yes! Alright? I almost dropped to my knees when I first felt it. I swear I think I saw it too. Strands that glowed gold and red connecting me to Tony. It eased when I took Tony’s hand and made him the offer, but lately,” He rubs at his chest. “Lately, whenever I’m not with him, there’s this constant ache. When I went to see him in his forge, it was like I could breathe again. And then he smiled and it was like the sun came out.”
“Hmm? No reason.” He does a little twirl and winks at Steve. “What do you think, Charming? Do I clean up well?”
Sword raised, Steven prepares to end this once and for all. The icy blue of Pierce’s eyes bore into his own and Steven falters for just a moment. The moment is all Pierce needs. He pulls a sword from behind his throne and lunges at Steven. Bucky gets there first and it’s like time speeds up. Before Steven even realizes what’s going on, his sword is through Pierce's heart and Bucky is on the ground with Sam at his side.
“Yes, yes. I know. It is very exciting. On that day, my Prince Charming gave me the most beautiful ring,” Tony holds up his hand for everyone to see and there are more cheers. “Truly the best day of my life.”
“You’re definitely the better choice.” Before he sits, he finds another glass and pours some more whiskey. “I trust that woman with my life, but when she’s feeling protective, she terrifies me.”
Steve gets a hand on the nape of Tony’s neck and pulls him close. His fingers brush the ends of Tony's hair and he takes a deep breath. Closing the final distance between them, Steve keeps this initial press of their lips soft. It's mostly chaste, just a barely-there kiss. It's perfect and yet, Steve knows he wants more.
They continue walking toward the castle, chatting a little, but mostly enjoying each other’s company. They separate when they reach the entrance to the baths. When Tony starts to pull away, Steve stops him and quickly presses a kiss to the top of his head.
Tony slides to his knees and looks up at Steve. “I’m ready, sir.” He can see his collar in Steve’s hand and he wants to feel it’s the weight on his neck. Feel the way he becomes  Steve’s when he wears it.
Steve brings his hand to his face, brow furrowing. There’s a little soot on it, but nothing a quick wipe down won’t fix. “What’s wrong with it?”
“Good boy.” Sarah stands and takes his hand. “Now, come with me. I think you need to pick something out to give to Anthony. A piece of jewelry to let him know your intentions are serious. Tell me what you are planning next. His idea for a quiet dinner just the two of you was quite inspired.”
Now, Tony, is the one laughing. He moves even closer to Steve and pokes him in the stomach, enjoying the way Steve flinches. “You could.” He swipes at the sweat on his forehead, grimacing because he knows he just left a streak of soot. “But you won’t.”
Tony shivers as Steve moves behind him. “Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. I’m nervous. I like seeing you.”
Steve’s words are so earnest and heartfelt that Tony has to kiss him. “Yes, Steve. My prince charming. My darling. My beloved. I will marry you. I would love to marry you. I want to be the best partner to you and stand by your side and help our people.”
As they descend from the tower, Rumlow stays close to Steven, one hand on his back as he fills the silence with more than few clearly embellished tales of his bravery. When they do find the king and queen, also newly awakened, Rumlow is quick to talk over Steven and tell the story himself. He boasts about waking Steven with True Love’s Kiss and interrupts Steven once again, proclaiming that they are meant to be.
That question is one Steve has asked himself more times than he can count, even as recently as a few months ago. For the most part, he’s moved on from the curse and Rumlow's betrayal, but the dreams still come sometimes.  They always put him right back in Pierce’s throne room and all Steve can do is watch him smirk and boast about how easy it was to fool Steve. The dreams have come less and less since he and Tony had begun courting.
Steve passes Peter over, bottle and all, and digs into the stash of burping cloths they keep near the bed. “I wonder who he gets that from?”
She lasted another minute before the question she’d been holding back, burst forth. “Please, Margaret. Tell me. Am I going to lose him?”
He begins explaining how he’d never really experienced the same sorts of desires as everyone else, and once he starts, the words just keep coming. Tony listens closely, only interrupting now and then to ask questions so he can understand better. When Steve tells him how it wasn’t until recently that he began wanting more, he can’t help but blush.
Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s body to wrap around his cock, hard in his pants. “I know you do. Hard already for me. Just from my words.” He stands and pulls Tony with him. “I’m going to check in a lot, baby. I know this is new for us both and I want this to be good for us both.”
When Tony agrees to it, Steve is ecstatic. He always loves the way Tony submits for him. It’s absolutely gorgeous the way Tony puts that trust in him and lets Steve take control.
He saves his hair for later, hoping that if he bats his eyelashes, Bruce will give it a good scrub. When he’s sure he’s gotten as clean as he can, he pulls the plug and watches the dirty water drain from the tub. The drains and pipes had been one of his first big projects, and one of his first successes, and every time they get used he feels a little thrill. He created something for his home to make things better and it had worked and Tony was proud.
Steve beams and takes Tony’s hand. “You do.” He looks Tony up and down slowly. Red really is Tony's color. “Though, you missed a spot.”
Rumlow escorts Steven to Pierce and once the doors close, Pierce stalks toward Steven. The look in his eyes makes it clear he believes he will still be able to accomplish his goals. He promises Steven everything he can think of from power to wealth and Steven is disgusted. He pulls his hand free, and states, once again that he is devoted to the one who woke him from his slumber, batting his eyelashes and acting as though he is in love. Pierce just laughs and begins revealing everything about Steven’s true love.
Setting the razor down, Tony wipes his face and looks in the mirror. “He has feelings for you.” He tells his reflection. “He left you the daisies. He sent the tarts you found. He's sent just as many notes as you have. You are getting a happy ending.”
Tony waits for Steve to get a hand in his hair, but first, he hears the pop of a cap and knows Steve’s fetched the lube. He’s eager and anxious to begin. He loves the combination of Steve’s fingers in his ass while his cock is in Tony’s mouth, but he’s curious what it’ll be like while he’s blindfolded.
“Not sure yet.” Bruce looks down at the water and then back at Tony. “You’ve got quite the ring around you.”
Steve smiles to himself. He feels so content with Tony in his arms like this, knowing they have a bright future ahead of them.
“Thank you for telling me, Steve. I know it wasn’t easy.” Sitting back a little, he rests his hands on Steve’s chest and thinks about what he wants to say next, as well as how he wants to say it. “And I need you to know, if all you ever wanted was cuddling like this and kisses on the cheek or forehead, I’d be happy. I get to be with you, and that is all I want. I love you because you're you. Not just for kisses and potential bedding.”
“I am not sure, your majesty. I could not see a face nor a name, but they were hungry for power and your son is a threat to that desire. Do not fret, I will help where I can. Your son will not be left knowing nothing.”
“I can imagine.” She moves behind him and slides his jacket down his arms. “Now give me your arm and start talking, kotenok.”
Releasing Tony, Steve runs a hand through his hair, cheeks red. “Yes. Chess. Gonna let me have the first choice or try and give yourself the edge by choosing first?”
“Yes, Tony. I want to marry you. I love you so much and there’s no real rush. We have time, but I’d like to see this ring as a promise for our future. A promise to love each other and grow together and learn together and do our very best to be true partners to one another.”
“Good point. You want to go clean up while I start a bottle and collect our son?” Steve can’t help but smile as he says those words. The past couple of months have been a bit rough since Peter hasn’t been sleeping, but Steve wouldn’t give up that little boy for the world.
He remembers the glimpse he’d gotten of the strings connecting them. His own had been blue with a silver glow, bright and cool. Tony’s had been a deep scarlet with a golden glow around them. They had reminded Steve of a hearth fire. Warm and inviting, providing heat and comfort to anyone who was close. That was who Tony was too. Whoever he was with always seemed to smile more when he was near and he was always doing what he could to ensure others had what they needed.
Pierce revels in boasting about how he was the one who cursed Steven in the first place. All because a wizard had come to Pierce with his own prophecy about how Steven would be his downfall. Steven stares at Pierce, all sorts of questions vying to be asked first. When he can't decide what to ask, and wanting to keep Pierce talking, he blurts out how he's curious how Pierce had managed to stay so young. A booming laugh is the response he gets and Pierce shows him the bottles of potions he uses to retain his youth. Inside each bottle is the youth of one of Pierce's people and Steven is absolutely disgusted. Pierce does not even notice, words spilling from his lips about how when the prophecy didn’t change, he provided Rumlow with another potion and sent him to wake Steven.
Doubt still filters into Tony’s mind and try as he might to hide from it in Steve’s chest, it still whispers in his ear. “I know you do. I promise you. I know that. But-”
It’s easy to picture and Steve laughs. “That’s not a surprise. Go down to breakfast. I’ll get dressed and meet you. I promise you will get all the details as soon as I’m down. Deal?”
Margaret looked at her queen and offered a comforting smile. “Come here, darling. Hold your son. Feel how strong he is.”
“No! Nothing wrong. Promise. Just want to do this.” He stands on his toes and kisses Steve on the cheek. “Okay, we can go now.”
Tony laughs and it’s a bright and happy sound. “Alright, alright, I will make sure I am at dinner. I’ll even meet you at the stairs and let you escort me in.”
“Is this a special dinner, your highness?” Tony is grinning when he asks, tongue darting out to lick his lips.
Roth comes in as Bucky leaves and even he has a knowing look on his face. It's a look that means Steve will be talking about the night before with a lot of people.
Steve holds out his free hand and waits for Tony to take it. Steve only gets a moment to enjoy holding Tony’s hand, though. Before he can start leading him out of the forge, Tony pulls away, eyes wide, face pale.
As they leave the castle grounds, Steve notices Tony looking around, trying to figure out where Steve is leading him. Usually, when they leave the castle, they take the main road into town. Tony doesn’t go out often, preferring to give a list of what he needs to whoever is venturing out so he can stay and continue working on whatever project he's got in the forge. His errands are usually just that, errands. When he does venture out for supplies, it's because he has a very specific thing in mind and wants to be sure he gets exactly what he needs. Occasionally Clint convinces him to join him on one adventure or another. And when they come back, it's with a story and a souvenir.
“Hmph, sure Tony.” Steve snorts. His voice is laced with sarcasm when he speaks next. “Extra challenge. I’ll still kick your ass. Even going second.”
She crosses the room to her son and rests a hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. They both watch as Tony pulls the shield out and brings it over. Steve gets a look at what Tony is holding and he looks away from Tony to his mother and then back again.
What Tony wants is to swallow Steve’s cock, but his leg is headed toward the painful kind of asleep so he nods. “I’d like that, sir.”
“That's the surprise.” Steve picks up the picnic basket and begins walking, tugging on Tony’s hand until he follows. “But it’s worth it. Promise.”
Amiyusesha, I hope you enjoyed this fic! It was a lot of fun to write and Steve and Tony were both very happy to let me know what they wanted in parts
“Mmmkay,” Tony says, face still mashed into Steve’s chest. He feels Steve laughing and lifts his head so he can look him in the eye. “Fifteen minutes.”
Steve smiles. “Good.” He leans in as if to kiss Tony on the cheek and when he realizes what he’s doing, he stops and adjusts to open the door for Tony. “Sleep well.”
“Silly, silly papa.” He sings. “We love him, though, don’t we?” Peter blinks up at his dads, eyes locking on Steve. Tony looks over at Steve and snuggles closer. “Yeah, we love him so much, you and I. He’s just the best, isn’t he?”
One last coat of paint goes on the star at the center of Steve's shield and Tony feels his chest swell with pride. In this forge, with his own hands, he's been able to create and build. The list of his creations is long and Tony is proud of even the smallest thing. There have been arrowheads, horseshoes, nails, pipes, but this, this shield, it's different. He closes his eyes and lets himself imagine how Steve will react when he presents his courting gift. There will be astonishment and smiles and, if Tony is lucky, Steve will give him the best smile of all. The soft sweet smile that doesn't hide how touched he is. He’ll hold the shield in one hand and reach for Tony with the other. He'll pull him close and then...Tony shakes himself. It's time to think of other things.
Tony moves with Steve, trusting that Steve won’t just let go or mess with him. He feels the tip of Steve’s cock against his lips and his mouth opens to let him in. The hand in his hair disappears and Tony whines around the head.
He makes another circuit of the room, hands pulling at his hair. “Why did I kiss Steve’s hand? I'm smarter than that.”
“Fuck.” Tony’s hips move with Steve’s strokes. “Please, sir. Please. I want it. Want your cock. Want you fucking me.”
Coulson, who had been standing with him, smirks. “Do I dare guess what the queen wants to talk about? Or is it too easy?”
“They are the best moments.” Tony leans over to kiss Peter’s head. “He’s ours, Steve. Our baby. Our Peter.”
Steve plants one hand near Tony’s head and grips the headboard with the other. “Since you asked so nicely.” He snaps his hips and Tony keens. “Touch yourself, baby. I want to see you come too.”
Tony squirms and Steve eases him off his lap. He doesn’t go far, just curls into Steve’s side. “We’re doing this again, yes?”
Before stepping into his room, Tony takes Steve’s hand. Feeling brave, he lifts it to his lips and presses a kiss to Steve’s knuckles. “I’m sure I will have good dreams tonight. Sleep well, my prince.”
“Of course it was Clint!” He pushes Steve toward the chairs set in front of the fireplace and takes a seat. “You know how close he is with Tony. Nat is sneaking down to his room as we speak.”
“No?” Steve stares at Tony and licks his lips, trying to determine if he’ll actually be able to get him to give him a hint. “Really?” He grins and bends just enough to look Tony in the eye. “I could order you to tell me. I am a prince, after all.”
“I’m glad you’re happy here.” Steve suddenly feels the need to touch Tony. He’s so close and it would be so easy to reach out and pull him into his arms and not let go. Instead, he clenches his fists at his sides and clears his throat. “Since you’ve quenched it, does that mean we will actually see you at dinner tonight?”
“Little bit of both. It’s just,” he tries to find the right words and can’t. “It’s scary. I’m putting myself out there. What if Tony doesn’t feel the same?”
Tony notices the tears in Steve's eyes and finds himself at a loss for words. Instead, he gets as close as he can without getting in Steve's lap and slips his arm through Steve's. He tangles their fingers together and leans his head on Steve's shoulder. He wishes he knew what to say to offer more comfort, but he hopes just sharing this moment and this space with Steve helps.
With trembling hands, Steve manages to get the ring on Tony’s finger. The rubies suit him well and he can’t help but rub his thumb over them. When he lifts his head, he finds Tony smiling and Steve smiles back.
Tony tries to keep a straight face, but can’t help the giggles that escape. “Of course. It was only logical.”
“Of course he did.” Steve is touched by the gesture and just barely manages to keep from reaching up and touching the delicate petals. “He is thoughtful like that.”
Glad the blindfold hides the fact that he’s rolling his eyes, Tony sucks on the tip and lets himself play a little. He uses his tongue to tease along the underside of the length in his mouth and moans when Steve’s finger breaches him.
Tony nods and leans in, but stopping just short of kissing Steve. Steve grins, knowing Tony wants these kisses to be in his control to start. He pulls Tony closer until they’re pressed together from chest to hips and tries his best to suppress a groan. He'd never thought having someone this close would make him feel as much as this does. He's excited and nervous, yet he's also eager and ready to kiss Tony again and again. Their second kiss is slower and they both enjoy just sinking into it. They take their time mapping each other’s mouths, learning the shape and taste of one another.
Cheers erupt throughout the room with Clint being one of the most vocal in his support. Tony laughs, heart full at how much everyone is happy for them.
When they stand, Tony goes to give Steve a playful shove and ends up tripping over his own feet. Steve lurches forward and catches him, tucking him into his side and holding him close.
When Steve does appear, a small gasp escapes Tony's lips and his heart starts to race. Steve’s clothes are not all that different from his usual dress, but the way his breeches are fitted to his legs, his boots enhance them even further and Tony swallows hard. His eyes travel upward and he holds back a groan when he sees Steve's jacket. He swears Steve’s shoulders look even broader and the sapphire color make his eyes shine a deeper blue.
Bucky is ecstatic that Steve has accepted that he has feelings for Tony. Now, the question is if he’s going to do anything about it.
When evening comes, Tony and Steve walk back to the castle for the feast that awaits them there. Steve keeps hold of Tony’s hand the whole time, overjoyed to be sharing this with his betrothed. Whenever he spies a secluded spot, he pulls Tony aside and takes the chance to kiss him again and again. Tony returns the favor a few times himself, loving the way Steve happily lets himself be led somewhere they won't be seen. By the time they actually arrive back at the castle, their cheeks are flushed and their lips are swollen.
Unsure what to say, Tony just tightens his hold. Steve means so much to him and even the slightest inkling that Steve could feel the same fills Tony with warmth. He also feels something that he thinks could be love, but he's not sure he's ready to declare it so just yet.
Sarah pokes her son in the side making him flinch and giggle, just as he did when he was a baby. “Don’t you ‘good afternoon’ me, young man. You know why I called you over here. Now talk. Shall I begin planning the wedding?”
It’s on the tip of Steve’s tongue to say he’s fine and they can go in, but he knows it’s not the truth. “A moment would be nice, actually. How were the baths?”
“We’ve each won one.” Steve smiles and it’s the lopsided, slightly crooked smile Tony especially loves. “A tie-breaker is required.”
A gentle tug on Tony’s hand is all it takes for him to move closer and Steve lets go so he can wrap his arms around him. Tony burrows into his embrace, his own arms going around Steve’s waist.
More cheers fill the room and Steve and Tony become aware that everyone is watching them. Tony laughs and hides his face in Steve’s chest. Steve’s cheeks turn hot and he wraps his arms around Tony, making sure to keep the shield out of the way.
A doctor is sent for and after a few, very tense hours, Steven and Sam are informed that Bucky will live, but his arm cannot be saved. Pierce's blade had been poisoned and in order to save Bucky, they have to take his arm and the source of the poison. Once the procedure is over, they take over Pierce’s suite of rooms, placing Bucky on the indulgently large bed to recover. While they watch to see if he develops a fever, Steven writes a letter to his parents apprising them of what happened. Sam sends the letter home with his falcon, Redwing, and as soon as Bucky is well enough, they travel home.
“Yes, Steve.” Tony’s whole body feels taut and ready for whatever order comes out of Steve’s mouth next.
The laughter that bursts from Tony’s mouth is loud and happy. He leans forward, arms around his stomach. The idea of Bruce spilling a secret is hard to even imagine. He’s almost as good as Natasha. “Never. Bucky is almost as bad as Clint about keeping secrets. I wasn’t sure if he’d be able to hold it all in. But Bruce?” Tony mimes locking his lips. “He’s like a steel trap. He reveals nothing.”
Sam and Bucky share sly grins over Steve’s head, happy to have won. They listen as he tells them about the night before and they restrain themselves from cheering, but only just barely. Tony and Steve are on the right track and hopefully, it won’t be much longer before they take another step forward. Maybe even actual kisses, though Sam and Bucky don't hold their breaths.
Sinking back into his chair, Steve smiles. They have a plan. This is going to work. He has to believe that. Dwelling on what could happen otherwise is not an option. At least, not right now.
“And if I have?” Steve is looking at the ground now. He hadn’t expected to make the admission, but it’s the truth. Lifting his head, he forces himself to meet Tony’s gaze. “Tony?”
Walking Tony to the couch and the pillow he’s set on the floor, Steve lifts his hand to his lips. “I know you will be. Kneel, Tony.”
In the small kingdom of Brooklyn, a king and queen were celebrating the birth of their first child...
Tony can feel himself sinking into that calm settled place of submission and he swallows. “Yes, sir.”
“Pretty sure time just goes faster when we're together, Charming." He doesn't let go of Steve's hand and takes a deep breath. "I know it’s gotten a little late since we did end up talking a good while, but I brought my chess set up. Play a game? Or two?” He winks. “I’ll even let you win one.”
At his door, Tony reluctantly slides his arm free of Steve’s and feels a slight tug from his chest, right over his heart. It’s a familiar feeling. One Tony has long since grown used to. When he’s with Steve, it’s barely there, but the further they’re apart, the harder, and more insistent, the tugging is.
Quickly wiping his eyes, Steve smiles at Tony, touched by his actions. “Anyway,” he stands and offers Tony his hand. “Ready to continue on to our destination?”
Tony giggles. “Steve, it’s okay. I felt it the first time I saw you. I’ve always thought it was just the shock from having the prince appear at the door. But, as time went on and I knew you more, the feeling only got stronger. I just never knew what it was.”
Unfortunately, all of their preparations were for naught. As evening approached, it was Sarah who noticed how quiet it had become. The birds were silent and even the wind had died. She ran for her husband and together they began searching for Steven. They searched the castle and when they could not find him, they feared the worst. Their search moved outdoors and they quickly found his retinue of guards and knew they’d failed in their efforts to prevent their son’s fate. Before they could continue their search, a thick red fog rolled across the ground, rendering everyone it touched into an enchanted sleep. The same sleep which had enchanted their prince in a tower surrounded by roses and thorns in the woods...
“It is.” It amuses Natasa that Tony felt the need to clarify who. “I was nervous at first. Two men wanted me, and not only were they my two closest friends, but they also wanted each other. I did not know that could work, but they were persistent.”
It never fails to astound Tony how Steve seems to notice when he’s in his own head. No one has ever been able to catch Tony lost in his thoughts better than Steve. And instead of being angry or annoyed, he’s always curious to know what path Tony’s thoughts have taken.
“Mhmm.” Steve grins and steps into Tony’s space. “And if I were to ask Jarvis if you’ve eaten today?”
“I do not see how the prince will be able to deny you, young sir.” Jarvis brings a brush over Tony’s jacket, removing any lingering lint. “I have been with you a long time, sir. I know how much you care for the prince and I have seen how much he cares for you. You will spend an enjoyable evening together. And I am confident the prince will turn away from you when you tell him how you feel.”
Steve brings his hand up to his face and studies his knuckles again. They are littered with little nicks and scars and there is still no physical mark from Tony’s lips. Steve still feels it anyway. They had been slightly dry and chapped from being out in the forge for days at a time, but still plush and pink when Tony pulled away.
“Hey, sweetheart. Thank you for coming up when I asked.” He holds his hand out to Tony and waits. Tony doesn’t have to take it, but when he does, Steve smiles and reels him in.
“I am. Or at least,” Tony bounces a little on the balls of his feet and runs his fingers through his hair, “I’m making sure Steve is aware that I am courting him. And that I'm serious about it.”
Tony loves what they have. He never doubts that Steve is in charge, and he likes it that way. He likes having these times where all he has to focus on are Steve’s orders and pleasing him.
In a forge tucked away from the noise and bustle of the castle, a smith brings his hammer comes down in a steady, ringing rhythm on a red hot piece of metal. The metal begins to flatten out and the smith begins turning it after each strike of his hammer, working it into a circular shape. He doesn’t know how long he's been working for, but eventually, he gets it in the size and shape he wants. Pleased with his progress, he quenches the hot metal and brings it over to the table to check its hardness.
When Steven’s 21st birthday was mere weeks away, both Joseph and Sarah began making preparations. They hoped that if they kept their son close by and surrounded by guards, maybe, just maybe the Darkness would not find him.
He’s getting ready to protest and explain why it’s a problem when he finds his hand is in Steve’s again. “And I don’t care. You’re a smith, Tony. I like seeing the proof of it. Even when it gets on my hands.” A gentle tug has Tony stumbling into Steve. “I like you all cleaned up and I like you dirty like this. It's just proof of all the hard work you've been doing. It's nothing to be ashamed of. And Tony?" Tony looks up. "I like you any way you choose to be.”
“Yes. Good.” Tony turns his head to kiss Steve’s shoulder. “Help me stand? Not sure my legs are steady yet.”
Happy it's an easy question to answer, Tony tells Steve most of what transpired in the baths. He makes sure to leave out any talk of kisses or courting, focusing more on Clint and Bruce. He starts rambling about the arrows he wants to work on for Clint when he feels his arm sliding through Steve’s.
“That he is, your highness.” Roth brushes down Steve’s jacket one last time and stands back. “You’re ready.”
Tony blows out a breath and glares at Steve. He doesn’t understand why Steve is so okay with this. “I got you all dirty.”
When Lady Natasha Romanoff agreed to the offer, more than a few wondered if it was all a plot to infiltrate the kingdom. It was well known that girls from her kingdom were plucked from their families as children to be trained as spies. The truth of the matter was that Lady Romanoff was one of those children. She had been sent as an applicant for the harem and upon meeting Steve and getting to know him, she knew she couldn't betray him. When her handlers discovered this, they took her away in the night and Steve could not let that stand. He rescued her from the cell she'd been imprisoned in and brought her back to Brooklyn. Now she, alongside Steve’s spymaster, had eyes and ears looking for those who would try and harm the kingdom.
“Of course.” Steve laughs. “It’s not all that exciting. Honestly. It’s a lot of meetings with advisors and writing letters while finding the little moments when I can come and find my favorite people.” Steve holds Tony’s gaze as he says the last bit, a shy smile on his face.
“There’s more.” He lets go of Bucky and drags his hand down his face. “I want to hold his hand. I want to hold him. I want him at my side, asking his opinion about things going on in court. I want to share secret smiles like I’ve seen you do with Clint and Natasha. The same smiles Carol and Rhodey share when they think they’re alone. I want, oh! Buck, I want-” Steve blushes and looks away.
Bruce lingers a little longer, talking and joking with them before leaving to meet Betty for dinner. Before he goes, he stops and makes Tony promise to take more breaks from his work, telling him it’s not just Steve who misses him. Tony promises to take more breaks and he and Clint wish him luck. Just like Tony, Bruce has been pining for one of the queen’s ladies' maids, Lady Elizabeth Ross. Steve has given his blessing for the match, even offering to help set things up, but Bruce is still hesitant about making an offer for Betty. Tony and Clint do what they can to encourage Bruce, but they both know if they were to push too hard, Bruce would end up pulling away rather than going for what he wants.
“Aw, thanks, Rhodey bear.” Tony leans into the embrace. “If I give you a note can you give it to Steve? I was going to pass it to one of the footmen, but since you’re here…”
“Yes!” Sitting forward, he rests his elbows on his thighs and groans. “After Rumlow, I swore to myself I wouldn’t risk my heart.”
Sarah took Steven and stroked one soft cheek with her finger. His mouth opened in a yawn and his eyes began to droop and she smiled. Whenever she or Joseph held him, he watched them intently, eyes tracking them and their mouths when they spoke. Steve was small, but the way he watched them with such intensity made Sarah believe he was strong and would grow up to follow in his father’s footsteps.
“Yes, Clint especially so. James was the more patient. He was very serious about courting. Flowers, a pretty dress, a few knives. I was not used to that. It is not how I was raised. We worked things out, though. With time, and now,” She brings her hand to her chest in a motion similar to Tony’s. “Now, my two best friends are my two great loves and I did not know I could be this happy. We are not perfect, but who is? We try our hardest every day.”
The brightness of the light caused Steven to begin to cry and Sarah did her best to soothe him, trying her best to ignore her own fears. “Who? Who would want to hurt my child?”
“More information?” He waves away the bottle, his now attention fully on Steve. “Yes, I’d like that very much. Stop stalling.”
He hears Steve laugh and then there’s the sting of Steve’s hand coming down on his skin again. “I asked you a question, Tony.”
There’s a pause as Steve selects something and when Steve’s hand is close, Tony can smell cheese. “Open.”
Don't worry, I have not forgotten about the shield. Epilogue will be posted on Monday and Tony will have a very special gift for his Prince Charming.
The next week starts with both Steve and Tony making their attempts at courting. Steve finds a note from Tony tucked into amongst the papers for his next meeting. The note is mostly silly. A one-sided conversation about how Tony’s day has been going and how he hopes Steve’s meetings aren’t too dull. It makes Steve laugh and he tucks it in his pocket for safekeeping. He’s also sure Tony will want to at least get another look at the sketch on the back since it’s clearly one of his inventions. What really interests him is how Tony managed to slip it in amongst the papers. On his way down to dinner, he stops in the kitchens and, with a little cajoling, convinces the cook to make some blueberry tarts and have them sent to Tony.
Steven had hoped that once this was all over he’d feel jubilant or excited or even eager for the future. Instead, he’s angry and worried, and heartbroken. The last one is a surprise to him. While he’d always known Rumlow was not his True Love, there had still been a small part of him that had hoped. Steven wanted to be loved. His mother had told him about the Seer, Margaret’s, words when he was a child. How there was someone out there who would stand at his side and rule a happy and united kingdom with him. He wanted that. He wanted it so badly. He knew it would be like what his mother and father share and a love like that seemed like paradise. Now, though, it's different. He doesn't care anymore if he ever feels the pull of those so-called “invisible strings”. All he wants is to go home and learn how to take care of his people and take care of his kingdom.
