“Uh, I guess, uh, I…I…don’t really, um, I don’t really remember last night, so I, uh, guess I slept uh, just fine?”
They filed in to wait behind Castiel and his gang. There were just two other students ahead of them already going through the process.
Castiel stepped out, grabbed the package, checked the label to make sure it wasn’t being sent out, checked for any other mail, got back in the car and proceeded down the driveway.
Castiel felt like he needed to pace to work off his stress, but he forced himself to sit back on the sofa. He took a deep breath. In his mind, he saw himself at the edge of a precipice, sky before him, glowing sunset golden, and a misty chasm of an endlessly deep, beautiful canyon. He steeled himself to jump off.
Castiel turned and unlocked his office. It was furnished with the typical cherry wood desk, credenza and matching filing cabinets. There was a print of the ocean, a fake plant in the corner near the window, and a real ivy plant growing along the length of the top of the credenza.  Castiel had seen the same style of office his entire life. It must be Doctor Office Decorating 101 in the design field.
He shook his head again, thinking he could use Jack’s request to call Benny “uncle” to launch into his discussion over his news, but remembered Claire wanted to talk about hers first.
“Well, hello there, Benny.” He put his hand out. “Don’t tell me you have kids caught up in all this, too?” He looked at Dean with a quick smile, then back at Benny.
“No, I’m not telling them any of you know, unless I need it for leverage, and most likely it will be Balthazar, if that’s alright with you?” Michael addressed Balthazar directly. “I know I was upset with Gabe and Anna bringing you into this, but I’m glad they did. Another person of the age of majority on my, and Cassie’s side, would be a good thing and welcome relief.”
“Alright, come. Let her up, Jack,” Castiel said holding back a laugh. Just as he started rolling up the blanket, Jack let out another earth shattering fart as Claire screamed, “NOOOOooooooooo!”
“Woah ho, Bro!” It was Gabriel. “What’s got your panties in a pinch? You need to get laid, man! I’m just the messenger.”
“In those large frames over there,” Dean said pointing them out to Castiel, “are the original blueprints from 1899. We found them in an old locker in the basement. Lisa wasn’t fond of my idea to have them professionally preserved and framed, but when it was all said and done, she came over to my side.” Dean smiled, remembering.
“Idiot! You’re not helping his case by saying that!” Claire shoved her brother laughing. “You’ll be a terrible lawyer if you say things like that.”
They went up to Gabriel’s room and turned on his boombox, so they could talk without being overheard. Shortly afterwards, Anna tapped on the door, and she and Castiel came in. Gabriel set Castiel up with headphones at his new Apple IIe+ computer with his favorite games, while the older ones talked and strategized.
Suddenly, mortified, Castiel stiffened. Still aware of Dean’s panic, though ebbing, he didn’t want to bring it back again, so he just kept soothing and rocking him. He forced himself to not think about it and continue soothing his patient.
“Ben and Emma are right inside. I’ve got to congratulate you, Mr. Winchester, you’ve got two great children here. Well-adjusted, self-aware, stand up for their convictions, look out for the outsiders, the different, and the minority. Protective, ready and willing to take on the punishment to protect others. Emma is particularly impressive. If I were in a tough predicament, I’d want her as an ally. She’s quite the force to reckon with. Ben seems more laid back, but he also believes in his sister’s ability to assess a situation and will back her for all he’s worth when he feels she’s on the side of right. He’s less of a fighter though. More interested in keeping peace and going about his own business, but if it’s right, he’ll fight for it.”
Castiel wrapped his own arms around Benny’s back, still looking for a passage to touch flesh. Suddenly, Benny let go of him and Castiel felt empty, until he realized Benny was wholly focused on freeing Castiel’s rising erection from his slacks. He ran his hands over Benny’s forearms delighting in the feel of the hard muscles at work under his hands. He placed his hands atop the credenza on either side of himself and leaned back against the large piece of furniture, eager for the first cool air to brush his abdomen and cock, right before being gripped by a warm, strong hand.
“Dean. Dean Winchester.” Dean tried being congenial, but he was a bit suspicious of this sex baker slash deputy, whether he was Castiel’s brother or not. If the man was harassing his kids for something they may not be responsible for, he would not be on Dean’s good side, no matter whose brother he was.
After getting to know the doctor a little, Dean was unsure if any of the story was true. He tried imagining the doctor asking a woman out on a date, but he was hard pressed to see it happening. Then again, you never really know what people are like behind closed doors.
“See?” He smiled to the crowd. There was a small spattering of light laughter and more than a few “aws.” Jack laughed, too.
“Angel, huh?” Castiel gave him a sly smile as they turned down the hallway towards his office. “Have you seen my wings?”
“Are you shitting me?” Dean turned his wheelchair to face Castiel directly. “Mine were born in May too, May 1st. They’ll be fifteen.”
“Really, ma’am, it’s OK. You’re not far wrong, anyway.” Dean winked at her and gave her his most flirtatious smile while reaching over his shoulder and gently caressing, then patting Benny’s hand resting on the corner of the backrest of his wheelchair. Then, looking up at him with loving eyes. He turned back to her and blinked rapidly, smiling softly.
“I wanted milkshakes. We went to Dairy Queen!” He answered like any normal happy eight year old, smile plastered on his face.
Benny drove as carefully as he could to avoid the bumps and potholes on the road as they made their way to the farm.
He pulled up and stopped the car at the curved driveway section in front of the large porch. Getting out, he took in the rest of the property in his view. There was a wide swath of concrete drive leading to the barn-like garage to one side of the house and then a gravel road leading away off the side of the garage. Much further back he could see the peak of the roof of an actual barn and a few outbuildings. Looking back toward the gate entrance, he really couldn’t see anything because of the low hill, but he remembered the fence was lined with small trees and just mostly a large dirt and gravel-covered, bare spot to one side.
“I’m so excited Uncle Gabe! I’m going to join Future Farmers of America Club!” He stayed with his head on his uncle’s shoulder for a time. “Oh, hi!” He waved to Deputy Barker. “I’m Jack!”
“But how do they do that without an address? Don’t you need a street address for opening certain accounts?” Dean asked in confusion.
“Mr. Winchester? Mr., uh, Uncle… um, Uncle Ben. Mr. Winchester. Emma and…Oh! Ben! I see. Emma and Ben are…uh, still speaking with Principal Macleod and the deputy. We’ll call you as soon as they’re finished. So, please just wait here. You may have a seat.” She motioned her hand towards the seating area that was already filled by other parents. She frowned and quickly left the room again.
“The color is what they call blue.” Ben informed them. “That’s actually the color of their skin. They make good wool. I thought about getting a breed that people raise mostly for meat, but not a lot of people around here eat the meat, but more people craft and weave, so I got these. Plus I like their look. I might get merino later. They’re the best for wool, but cattle people don’t take much to sheep nor bison. I really want some bison, but it’s expensive to build the right enclosures that’ll withstand a determined bison bull. Hell, they can derail a train. Right Uncle Benny?”
“Guess?” Dean questioned, sarcastically. “Why didn’t you just do what most regular folks do and check her collar?” Man, this guy, really is a clueless brainiac, Dean thought.
“Alright, well Cas, Dean was supposed to show you around, so I guess Lee and I will. Dean fixed up the old barn and turned it into a house for you. That’s what he was doing before he fell.”
Dean woke up, his eyes wide. He sighed. He would talk to his therapist, Mia, about the dream. He got up carefully so as not to wake anyone and called Sam. Sam was up anyway. He checked his watch. It was six in the morning.
The regular school officer was at the door and held it open for them. Benny wheeled Dean quickly in the direction of the office, Miracle leading the way.
“Wait. Your brother Gabriel? The ice cream sex baker brother Gabriel? Is interviewing my kids? Why!?!” Dean looked angrily from Castiel to the deputy. Miracle jumped into his lap.
“C’mon you’re upsetting the do—” Castiel threw  the end of the blanket down and backed away. “My god, Jack! What have you been eating?”
“We’re all going to go inside and get freshened up for our dinner. OK?” Michael said in a wooden tone. As a group, they headed towards the back entry, when they heard Naomi’s voice coming from behind them.
“I have some warm bath water here in the basin. I’m going to give you a quick sponge bath to wash the urine off and have you feeling clean and fresh, and in a new clean, dry gown in no time.”
As they approached nearer, a street lamp came on at the gate and more could be seen coming on dotted along the long drive towards the house.
Gabriel guffawed and nodded. “Yes, I kind of am. I’d only be concerned if we were from Florida or Virginia or one of those other states where cousins or siblings marry.”
Sam turned and followed Dean with his eyes. He sat at the bar for a minute, waiting. He'd seen Dean behave this way before, but not in a very long time and he didn’t want to pressure him.
Ben and Emma were in the barn milking their cow. Her name was Spots. The Chickens were Hellion one, Hellion two and Hellion three.
“Kaia says she already has everything I need at her house and will bring it tomorrow morning so we can get started on the lighting.” Emma flipped through the pages in her sketchbook to show her father the drawings they’d done of how it would work. “I told her we’d replace everything we used and maybe add some extras in for her helping out so much and helping above and beyond.”
The laughing sobs coming from Cassie, the smile big enough to see his teeth, the spasms as his chest rose and fell, Gabriel was undone. He closed the door, sobbing, tears rolling down his face. He could barely see to drive and scraped the side of his car as he pulled out of the garage. They stopped in the driveway long enough for Anna to jump in the passenger seat, after Castiel wailed for her, and drove out of the gate.
Michael stood up, pulling his sister with him. He stepped over towards Gabriel, put his hand out and pulled Gabriel to his feet.
“Uh, yes. This is Dean Winchester? Is there something wrong? Is this about their driver’s permit?” Dean asked with only mild concern.
Dean shook his head out of the memory and focused on his next task. He had to go to the mechanic shop for his shift. Miracle, his service dog, always went with him.
“She’s smart, my Miracle is.” Dean said proudly. “She must’ve seen the lights on or smelled your cooking.”
“Hi, Castiel! I just wanted to see how things were going. Balthazar and I just had a late dinner and wanted to check on you and the kiddos. Say ‘hi’ to him, Balthazar.”
Adam told him. So they had a battle. A battle where no one would get hurt. A battle that no one would lose. Everyone wins.
“Hey Miracle, can you bring me the wrench please?” Dean asked his dog. She grabbed it and gave it to him while he was under the car.
Dean seemed to finally come out of his panic attack fog. He turned from holding Castiel’s gaze to look down. He took one long, deep breath, and squeezing his hand one last time, let go and tilted his head back, closing his eyes. Castiel stayed close leaving his hand draped over the chair’s armrest. He didn’t want to make any sudden moves that might leave Dean feeling alone or abandoned.
Finally, after what seemed an interminably long time, Adam and Dr. Novak emerged from Dean’s room. Benny and Lee anxiously stood as the two approached.
“Are you not going to date Officer Hester? I’m glad, because sometimes she just acted like a tired adult. You know the kind who are always angry.” Jack added.
“It’s over two blocks. You can’t see that far.” She laughed. “I forgot. You got a thing for Sam Winchester.”
“I’m glad you’re okay Dean. I thought we… anyway. You rest up. Crowley will take care of everything.”
“They’ve been having their farm licenses for about a year now, it’s just their first time without an adult in the vehicle with them. I think they’ll be fine.” She reminded him. “Besides, their uncle is already there to follow them home, so there’s no hurry. We’ve probably already missed them anyway.”
“Alright, alright. I do.” Gabriel admitted. “But I swear, I can never seem to be in the right place at the right time to meet him.”
Lee gave him a kiss on the forehead too and patted Dean’s cheek. “Call us if you need us Dean, okay?” He said and squeezed Dean’s hand, their fingers grasped around each other and then he let go.
“Thank you,” he said simply. He took a deep breath and let it burst out of him in a rush. “Thank you.” He wiped more tears from his eyes, face, and chin. The front of his shirt was damp with tears.
“Dad has what they call a ‘type.’ That means he likes people that look or act a certain way. Think about it.” Ben explained. “Everyone dad has ever dated, except mom, what do they look like?”
Dean smiled. “Okay Cas, I look forward to getting my honey. Oh, you will? I look forward to meeting you too.”
“Well, since you’re like our second dad, and I had no doubts that he would. Can we let Claire speak now. She has something important to say.” Jack held his sister’s hand.
“No, I will say, thank you, and I needed that. And we may see each other again. But that’s all. You’re still a kid.”
Castiel had just finished cleaning up the kitchen as Jack and Claire came shoving each other down the stairs.
Finally, Sam could fidget no longer, and went to the table to pick up his drink, and say "good night." There might be something to what Emma was saying, but he didn’t know Dr. Novak well enough. However, he knew his brother and there was definitely some interest on Dean’s part. He just knew Dean was always angry lately. He hoped it had to do with the broken leg and foreclosure and would resolve itself before long.
“Why sheriff, do you always personally greet staff each morning or am I just that special?” Gabriel smiled and lifted the lid on the top box.
“Is there any laissez les bon temps rouler as lagniappe?” Castiel tossed some well-used Louisiana phrases he’d learned when he lived in New Orleans, giving Benny a toothy smile.
“I…I, uh, I…Yes. Okay, um, we’re going to get back with you in a moment. I, uh, let me check and see which room your two are in.” She nodded as she backed away and gave a curtsy before turning to head out the door.
“Good to know. Now I can get away with even more nefarious stuff!” Gabriel half-smiled at his sister.
Dean was telling a story about something that had happened to him, Benny and Lee during a fire one day. Castiel was sitting between the both of them, turning his head back and forth as they each told him their side of the story. Sam could tell that the doctor was enjoying himself immensely, laughing, clapping his hands together and every now and then, touching Benny on the arm or shoulder.
“Please, Michael! He’s just a little boy! Please!” She fell on him and clung to him for dear life, sobbing and wailing. “He’s just turned eight years old! Please!” Eventually, he wrapped his arms around her, rocking and crying with her. Gabriel fell back, still sobbing, drawing his knees up to hug to himself, and sat watching. Finally, Michael sat her up and swept her hair away from her face.
Crowley was their financial advisor for the ranch. He was a family friend. Bobby’s lover. Rufus was another friend of Bobby’s who worked at the shop with him.
“But, they started it, Dad. It was just an accident. Jack can’t control his arms when he’s anxious. That boy grabbed him! It’s not his fault!” Claire was still standing, defensive and defiant. Blue eyes fiery and desperate for understanding.
“But your dad has had…” There was a pause in which Sam assumed Kaia was counting. “Seven, chances that we know of, to find a person for a long term relationship and has failed at least seven times. And Claire and Jack’s dad only had the one try? I think it’s only fair that Dr. Novak gets his chance with Mr. Benny before y’all try to sabotage his relationship. Let the poor man have something nice in his life. And if it doesn’t work out, then we can work together to try to get your dad and Dr. Novak together.”
His breaths came faster and more ragged. He rocked back and forth slightly as he tried to control his breathing and halt the coming panic he knew was inevitable.
“Take care of yourself, Dean. I’ll check on you soon.” He said, then stepped back,  waving goodbye as they drove off. Dean waved back to his youngest brother.
Eight O clock rolled around and the doorbell rang. Right on time. The pizza had arrived just a few minutes earlier.
“Well folks, here we are again. Today, this time though, it’s Adam and Michael. To celebrate their bond. Now, I think you both know what I’m going to have you say. So go ahead.”
“Young lady. Claire.” Rowena spoke. “Since you're new here, I’ll be lenient. As your father said, I did tell you all that you’d have your chance after I finished telling their version of what happened. But you have not let me finish. Also, I’d like to elaborate a point you perhaps missed. This is their version of what occurred, not, I repeat not, what I or any of us in positions of authority have accepted as the one, true factual version. As such, I expect you to take your seat, reach into your reserves, find your patience, and let me finish. Then, and only then, will you be allowed to have your say. If you choose to ignore my directions and have another outburst, well, let’s just say that will be your vocal decision to give up your rights to any further comments on this matter, at all. At. All. Let me make clear, that should you choose such a course, the lack of your honest, clear testimony might just jeopardize any decision in favor of any you may wish to be defending, including yourself. Do I make myself clear, Miss Novak?”
“If your mom and dad hurt you, I want to make them hurt the same way!” Jack yelled, jumping up. “Why would they make you sad? Don’t they love you, too, like they love Uncle Michael and Aunt Anna?” He stomped his foot and punched his fist against his thigh. “I don’t
“Actually, if the account had been kept being paid into, I might never have found it, but it’s overdrawn now, for the first time. Not very long now, but it appears for the entire five years it’s been open, it’s only been used to pay for a post office box. Unusual, hm. The post office box is listed as the primary address for the account.”
“Dad, we’re not babies. We can act normal.” Claire said with her arms out and palms up in mild exasperation.
Kaia leaned over and whispered, “Because he just answered a lot of those questions when your brother asked them. He said you’d love to get some wool and then asked you, but you weren’t listening.”
“Well, our Uncle Gabriel and Uncle Michael are gay and we all know they are. I don’t think my father is or why would he not tell us?” Jack asked with a frown.
The leader sighed. “Then I wish you well. Good luck and be safe. May the Gods of the earth be on your side in your journey.” And then he left.
“Can we get out and look at the stars while you do that? Jack always loved identifying the constellations.
“There, now you no longer have a criminal record Dean. Same with you Sam. In fact, you never had one in the first place. Oh and you’re no longer legally dead. It’s as if you never were at all. Dean, you’re a firefighter. I know it was a dream of yours. Sam, you’re a well respected lawyer. Castiel, you’re a doctor because I know you still want to help people. Adam, or should I say Nurse Adam. And then Michael, Michael you own a hospital. Gabriel, a police officer would fit you because you can punish bad people.” She took a breath.
it, Gabriel?” He growled. He reached over to lay the packet of lube back on the desk and gently roamed his hands over Benny, who was now standing upright and had turned around to reciprocate.
“Alright, everyone stop! Just full stop.” Michael stood and paced across the room several times. “I’m not playing games with them. I’m not strategizing, negotiating, making deals, bribing or acquiescing at any point, or in any way over ANY of this. This is me going in and laying down a law on never harming our brother or any of us over anything ever again. This me taking control, just like they claim they want me to do. They’re not going to like it and they may try to retaliate, but we’re going to have evidence that they cannot get to. And until each item we have against them is resolved or somehow taken off the table, we can be the ones to dictate how Cassie is treated. We will be his guardians. We will be his parents in all regards.” He pounded his fist on the bedpost in emphasis.
When Dean retrieved the fax from his office, it turned out it was the exact paper he’d gotten in the mail on Thursday. Sam heard him yell in frustrated anger from the office and was almost run over in the doorway as Dean wheeled himself full speed from the office towards the bar.
The Doctor waved back. Benny got into the driver’s seat of the truck and Adam went up to the window.
. “ he nodded for emphasis and to plant the fact firmly in his mind, that that was what he did. “And even though I’ve been… I was married…and with women in the past, and still think they’re pretty and I like them as people, I don’t think I want to really date them. I want to…I…I
“OK, girl, you can go.” He gave her a hand signal as he spoke to her, and she barked at him before running off down the steps to greet the twins, tail wagging furiously in her excitement.
Claire watched them intently. What was going on between them? Were they married or living together? Maybe they were divorced, but still friends? Emma and Ben called him uncle. Was Ben named after him? Was he their dad, too? Stepdad? She couldn’t figure it out, but was a little too timid to ask Emma or Ben about any of her concerns. Claire just knew he better not be two-timing on her father. She really liked him, but she would make him sorry, if he was. She wondered how long before her dad would get there. Maybe she should do something to get Mr. Winchester away from Mr. Lafitte? Maybe she and Jack could stay by Mr. Lafitte and she could sit on one side of him and Jack could sit on the other side to keep Mr. Winchester away. She wiped her face, crumpled her napkin, and tossed it on her plate. She didn’t feel like eating anymore. She just wanted to guard what she had the feeling was her dad’s new, and probably first ever, boyfriend.
He dropped to his knees next to his brother grabbing him by the lapels of his formerly neatly pressed, button up collegiate shirt. Buttons flew every which way.
“Yes, a boy and a girl just like you.” Castiel was still nodding trying to convince Dean of his veracity. “Mine are thirteen. Will be fourteen at the end of May. May 18th.”
He pulled Castiel along. “Oh, Dad, does being suspended engender punishment at home? In other words, am I precluded from going on a date to the skating rink dance Saturday with Clark?” Jack stopped and looked back at his father. “He’s paying and wants to take me to dinner, too. He’s going to ask his mom first, but I want to have a ready answer in case she says he’s not punished either. Do I have to buy him flowers, or if he gets me a corsage, do I have to wear it? I don’t think I want to wear a flower.”
“They live over on the other side of town in the direction of my house. Very near the old elementary school.” Dean offered. “But I know Deputy Barker lives alone with her son, so maybe if he’d like, she’ll allow him to come along with us to my place. I saw that you two were friends, Jack.”
They both looked over towards Benny and Emma, when they got a little loud, which often happened when Emma and Benny were talking together. For some reason since she was a baby, she took to speaking Benny’s Cajun French when she was in trouble or excited. Benny delighted in teaching her and having someone else know his native tongue.
“My brother and I saw the entire thing. The two girls and one boy were joking around and teasing the Novak boy, Jack. I don’t know why they were teasing him, but they started name-calling and saying some very mean things that made him very upset. I was upset hearing it!” She held her palm against her heart, “so, I can imagine how upsetting it would’ve been to hear someone saying those things about me.” She looked at Jack. “Don’t worry, you did nothing wrong.”
“OK, Dean.” Castiel smiled. He felt like this visit was a good thing and he’d made great strides in changing the dynamic between him and his patient.
“Well, first off, neither of you are in street clothes. Pajamas are not for going out in. And secondly, my patient is a bit stressed at the moment, between his broken leg, missing service dog and other personal issues, he just needs his dog right now,
“Shut. Up. Mother!” Michael turned away. He was so sick, he couldn’t look at them. “I am aware of the things Anna overheard. I am aware of the drugs you’ve been giving to our baby brother…”
“OK, then I’ll get out of your hair then, but if you need anything, I’m nearby so please, let me know or give me a call.” He pulled one of his cards out of his phone pocket case and flipped it over. “Yes. Here this one has my personal cell on the back. I should’ve given this to you yesterday. My apologies.”
Gabriel could practically hear Gabriel smile on the other end of the phone as he told him the story of how he met Sam Winchester, a Local of Hope Valley and a lawyer. The best one, in Gabriel’s opinion.
“At least  half a dozen times, but I’m going to go check once more, just to relieve my mind. I’ve got a stomach ache. I need some candy.” Gabriel held his stomach as he ran over to the two copy machines he’d used, lifted the lids and checked all around them. “All good, but I still feel queasy.”
“No, thanks required.” Balthazar cooed quietly. “Sometimes we just need someone to tell us we have permission to feel or cry or let go of guilt. Let go of it, my dear. You’ve held onto it like a precious jewel for far too long.”
“I’m just saying why would my dad not tell us if it was true? I just told him and nothing bad happened.”
“I’ve done little woolen needle felted sculptures before, but nothing more artsy like Emma.” Claire professed. “I’m more into photography. I’d love to take some shots of the completed project in different lighting setups and from different angles. I like to see the contrasts of the light and dark from different angles. I’m really invested in seeing the outcome. Emma’s vision is extraordinary.”
Emma, Ben and Dean had convinced Castiel to let Claire and Jack ride to and from school with them as well as stay with them and Dean after school while the doctor was still at work. Castiel was actually relieved knowing his children would not have to be home alone in the evenings until he got off. In the city, he had a sitter. Just a college girl who lived next door, but he knew the children were in good hands. He had not thought ahead to set up child care, after he’d ended up beginning at the clinic sooner than he had expected to do so.
“Sit. I’ll get the salad ready.” Benny opened their bottles, wrapped a paper napkin around one and passed it to Castiel. He poured the dressing on the salad, tossed it a few times, and placed a bed on each plate, topping each with croutons and fresh grated cheese. He opened the still warm grilled tuna and split it between their two plates. Then drizzled the last bit of dressing atop it all and sprinkled with fresh cracked pepper from a small side container.
He stopped by the store to grab some popcorn. Castiel had his mask on as he looked around the aisles. It didn’t take him too long to find what he wanted. He also grabbed the kids' favorite candies too.
The kids were dropped off at the Roadhouse. They would help Jo serve food. Too young to serve alcohol. Dean made it clear that if any drunk fuck touched his daughter or his son, he would get a bullet through his head. He didn’t have to worry though. She had Jo, Ellen, Ash, Pamela and Ben to protect her but he knew that his girl could take care of herself just fine too. Ben was also able to protect himself.
“Hey, Big Man, it’s alright. We can stop. We’re not going back to the institute. Mommy and Daddy were going to tell you tomorrow. We’re also having a party for you, since you don’t have to go back, and your favorite cousin is coming, too!” Gabriel began to slow the car down. He was on the verge of panic listening to Castiel grow increasingly hysterical. He should never have picked him up and ran. This was all his fault. He remembered there was a Dairy Queen two blocks away and headed there.
Benny placed the utensils down on the plate, walked around the desk and pulled Castiel into his embrace. He placed his hands on either side of Castiel’s face, and just looked into his eyes for an eternity of mere seconds. The kiss began with tender appreciation and became more intense and needy as it went on. Castiel placed pressure at the back of Benny’s head and pulled his lips more firmly to his. First lightly nipping and licking, then lapping until Benny opened his mouth to allow Castiel’s probing tongue entrance, sliding and entwining, tasting and teasing. Castiel gripped Benny about the waist and slid his hands over the broad muscular back. A slight moan escaped as Benny ran his fingers up through Castiel’s hair cradling his head in both hands, tugging firmly on the dark locks to turn Castiel’s head as Benny burned a trail down his chin, across his neck, and down to the barely expose cording of muscle near the clavicle.
“Hello, young lady. I didn’t even notice your return.” Castiel placed his breakfast on the table, grabbed a bowl and scooped some of the breakfast eggs into the dog’s bowl. He refreshed her water bowl, washed his hands and sat to eat.
“As we all talked about getting to know you, we wondered that Dean was appearing uninterested because usually he’s the first one to ask a new face out, and always lucks out in the dating department. But he became a bit boudé— a bit sullen, saying you were off the table because you were his physician, which normally he doesn’t care about things like that. But Lee, Pamela and I, we told him the town was too small to take anyone off the table. However, I have not yet told him that it was you that I went on a date with or am now seeing.”
“Now, what I’m going to say next may change depending upon what the X-rays show us. You understand?” Dean nodded as he shoved another forkful of eggs in his mouth.
From then on, Roy and Walt worked different shifts than Dean. Customers were just as bad. They’d ask Dean about what happened to his leg. Dean hated talking about it so he wouldn’t answer.
“We’ll help you inside and let you get settled in. The Wifi password is on the desk. Dean may live on a farm but he ain’t stupid.”
“Oh, cher, Jack. Please, never think that just because an animal is large and seems unbothered by people or other creatures in close proximity, that they are friendly, tame or not a danger to you.” Benny said with deep concern. “Promise me you’ll never approach any animal you may encounter, unless there’s a professional around that knows what they’re doing, and knows it’s safe for you. Then, still be aware and very careful. If you see a stray bison around, steer clear of it and inform someone for the safety of others, too.”
They’d come to the conclusion that, though the girls had jumped to the erroneous conclusion that Jack threw the first punch, the girls were responsible for the escalation, and for the others feeling the need to go to the defense of Jack Novak.
“I’ve talked to some of the craftspeople in town and I think I remember one or two of them saying it could be used for that, but since it’s a little longer hair, it takes more time. You can come over one day and we can cut a little off for you to experiment with until shearing time.” Ben reached over to check the thickness of the wool. “Right before it’s time for them to lamb, I’m supposed to have them sheared anyway. I thought I’d practice instead of getting a shearer, but maybe have a professional shearer here to guide me.”
“We don’t talk to them.” Claire said flatly. “They seemed nice enough when we were really little, but they always would say mean things about our dad and then they said they were going to try to take us away from Daddy. Uncle Gabriel and Daddy never let them see us again and I’m glad. I didn’t really like them and definitely didn’t want them to take us from Daddy.”
“That would be nice. I think my brother mentioned something about them. I think he lives on their property. He’s the new doctor at the clinic.”
Dean was just nervously, and rapidly, tapping one hand on his wheelchair armrest with his other arm flung over Miracle, scratching her chest. He was both relieved and fuming. Lisa was always doing things like this to “keep her independent identity“ she’d tell him only after he’d find out about it. He could never understand, because he never had any issues with her keeping her maiden name or having her own separate identity, personal or business.
we're going to let the good times roll if I’m there, Cher, and it’s not going to be only a little something extra!” Benny’s eyes twinkled in admiration.
Benny let him, and slipped into just allowing himself to be led and controlled. It was completely against his nature, but he found with Castiel, it was easy for him to go with it. Even now, with what was essentially just their sixth kiss, Benny could tell that Castiel had much more confidence and was more sure in his skills. And that was Benny’s main objective while Castiel was still dealing with his emotions and residual mental scars from his previous years of conversion therapy. Unfortunately, now was not the time nor the place for them both to be feral, no matter how much Benny wanted to be.
Sam heard the clinking of a bottle on glass. He went running to find Dean downing a shot of bourbon. Miracle was already pawing around his lap.
Castiel had just exited the kidney stone patient’s room and was heading down the hall towards Mr. Winchester’s room when he heard the crash. Yelling for a nurse or orderly to help, he rushed into Dean’s room at the same time as one of the nurses. Thankfully, it was one of the large, strong male nurses.
“I can’t wait to get a kitty kitteh! But Dad, I still want to talk about why you hurt thinking sad and bad things about when you were little.” Jack said, still with a hint of anger in his voice.
Eventually, he got up, drained the tub and rinsed it out. He went to the shower, swollen cock in hand, and rubbed out another two orgasms before he felt too sore and too tired to do it again. He washed and went to bed, but could not sleep. He’d never had that many orgasms in a row that quickly. He lay awake most of the night alternating between trying to envision Benny and even André, and masturbating three more times to visions of Dean. He finally fell asleep just before dawn.
Claire backed away and saw her dad speaking with Mr. Lafitte, closely. They were very close and looking each other in the eyes intently, then broke off their conversation to move to the auditorium. Yeah, she thought she was right. Maybe that’s who he had the date with? She walked up to her brother and they held hands as they walked out to the auditorium.
Castiel leaned down and kissed him. He laid down next to Dean. He pulled out a blanket and some water. He helped Dean drink some of it.
“MR. WINCHESTER!” He felt hands on his shoulders grasping him and pushing him back up right, saving him a headfirst tumble to the floor.
“I can’t, I can’t.“ Dean was sitting forward trying to steady his nerves and taking deep breaths. “I need my d…” He felt like he was suffocating and the panic was rising. He began to hyperventilate .
“Now,” he continued abruptly before Dean could interrupt, “first, I will give you details on the type of breaks you have. Secondly, I will discuss what steps we have taken so far. Third, I will finally re-examine your leg to check for any undoing of my previous work due to your tumble this morning. Fourth, I will lay out my intended course of care, which I am fully prepared for you to reject, argue against and flout at every possible moment of your convalescence. Do you have any pertinent questions before I commence?”
“No, that’s all I have to talk about for myself. Claire has things she wants to talk about.” Jack said seriously. “Let’s go see the sheep.”
“I’d venture to say that Jack will have absolutely no problem with your announcement. I have the feeling Claire will be fine, too.” Benny said with a fond smile. “But that boy knows his mind and is the sweetest, most tender-hearted young man I think I’ve ever met.”
“Thanks, Jo. The kids’ll be sorry they missed you. They haven’t really seen you much since school started”
Dean Winchester was working his ass off in the sweltering heat with the sun on his back. He had only a few hours to do this before he would have to meet up with the new doctor and show him around. He didn’t know why he had to be the one to do it. From what he heard, the guy was a dick but he had a job to do. He had to fix up the old house for the doctor. He had finished the inside with the help of his friends and now he was fixing up the outside. He was almost done. All he had to do was place one more thing and then the job would be done. He wiped the sweat off of his face and climbed down the ladder. Except that he missed a step and fell over ten feet and hit the ground with a sickening crack. He tried to move his leg but it was definitely broken. His farmhands, Lee Webb and Benny Lafitte, who had been working with him, came running.
Awed, Gabriel and Anna came up behind their older brother, who quickly opened the large safe with the combination he seemed to know by heart. Inside were several shelves stacked with files, folded stacks of paper, a second smaller safe, a few metal boxes, several jewelry boxes, and a large revolver along with several boxes of ammunition. He grabbed the revolver.
“Claire, sit down. Ms. Macleod said anyone who had objections could have a turn to speak after she was finished.” Castiel spoke firmly to his daughter.
“My brother, who owns an exotic adult bakery/confectionery/ice cream shop, tests new products out by giving me samples. This is his latest endeavor and I will have to let him know that it fulfills his requirements. However, I fail to see why anyone would like to walk around with that level of fruit stain on their lips, mouth or —other areas.”
“Well, Dean is a unique and rare man who inspire those qualities in others,“ Adam said fondly as he laid out prep for the bone setting.
“Just because you had a good experience and a wonderful loving and understanding father, doesn’t mean that every other person does. So, not everyone can just come out and tell their parents, other family members, their workplace or sometimes even their friends. And it is conceivable that your father may have had bad experiences with his parents or other family members that made him not want to or be fearful of coming out. Other people sometimes are just afraid they’ll hurt their family members if they lived openly gay. Each person is different.”
He did not like keeping his budding relationship with Castiel from Dean, but after what Dean had said about not wanting anyone to get involved with “his” doctor, combined with the way he seemed to react with regard to Castiel, in general, Benny was feeling something akin to guilt. On top of it all was the confession of how Castiel truly felt about Dean that Benny had been holding in since his date with Castiel.
Castiel hesitated. He knew that of all the people in the world he could trust with this, it would be Balthazar, but his problem still was he’d never truly come to terms with it himself, because every time he tried, it seemed to affect his life in extreme ways.
“Uncle Ben. Can you…can you make me a b-b-bowl of rice w-w-while we wait!?” Dean snorted and threw his head back in a fit of laughter. Benny squeezed his hand threateningly on Dean’s shoulder, but burst out laughing as well. He tried to keep himself quiet by looking down, but Dean and any other observer would know he was having a hearty laugh by the way his shoulders were shaking uncontrollably and the red hue of his face.
Once they got home, the kids made plates and popcorn while Castiel set up the movie. The weekends were the only times they were allowed to eat in the living room, with the exceptions of birthdays and holidays too.
The kiss was tame compared to the previous night’s inferno, but it was everything Dean had ever wanted, from Cas’ rainstorm scent drowning him to the pleasantly rough scrape of stubble against his mouth. Now that he wasn’t besieged by spasms of celestial sorcery, he was free to delight in the sensation of Cas’s hair between his fingers, and to truly marvel at the softness of those lips he’d imagined for so long. Their meeting was unhurried and tender, but it carried the sort of heated promises which sowed shivering flames along Dean’s skin. That sweet anticipation alone was enough to buoy Dean’s disappointment when they both pulled back to catch their breath.
As though to demonstrate, he extends said appendages out to their fullest capacity, angling them towards the sun like some sort of giant cormorant while he indulges in a lazy stretch. Dean is briefly enthralled by the buffet of taught golden skin, but miraculously manages to cast his gaze towards the looming wall of glistening black feathers, then back to the angel’s face. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Castiel so relaxed. It’s a rare and jarring contrast to his usual intensity.
Peridot eyes assiduously survey the angel as he finds his way back into the bunker with an uncharacteristic teeter. The door clanks loudly behind them, safely shutting out the horrors of the day, for now. Their fresh echoes still linger however, reaffirmed with every glance he takes of his crimson-stained companion.
“Don't worry Cas, I'll show you how to use toilet paper, it's not that bad,” Dean joked lamely, trying to dilute the grimness of the situation.
When Dean tries to break away, vexed by this sudden and exquisite gentleness, Cas’ hands compel him to remain steady as they explore him. His tenderness reforges him, but it is nowhere near docile. Dean all too willingly folds.
“This uh, feel good Cas?” he smirked, though his voice was feeble. His fingers were completely submerged in the onyx feathers now, with no inclination to stop.
Dean’s eyes stung, and his shaking fingers curled bruisingly into the angel’s thigh as he vainly struggled for composure. He knew he was allowed to come undone here. Cas had helped him painstakingly carve out this tiny, precious safe space for him over the years, but four decades of hard wiring against any spark of vulnerability was difficult to untangle on his best days. This was definitely not one of those.
This time, Dean made no effort to quell the desperate whine that surged from his throat. The angel had him ensnared in his trap, and he felt his tangled insides begin to fall away from the gaping wound of his offer.
He had his grandfather back, but Samuel was far from the illustrious hunting legend Dean had always imagined; He was actually kind of a slippery, cue-balled douchebag.
, all up in his space, to the point where he and Cas were cocooned in a sort of feathery confessional. It was almost impossible
It was unbelievable. Miraculous. And, despite the innumerable times Dean had pictured this in secluded corners of night; despite how he ached for sweet deliverance, it was all wrong. Cas was sacrificing himself again, because Dean had failed to control the situation. Dean couldn’t bear to have him used as some magical stop-gap, even while the errant spell greedily howled in his bones.
Obviously, Dean hadn’t exactly pictured their momentous denouement crowned with morning breath and sleep-crusted eyes, but if the endless years of tension were finally going to come to a head on a random Wednesday, he’d take it. He was in. 100%. All engines g-
Despite the skull-crushing tension, Dean couldn’t help but grin just a little, at the angel’s parted lips, tilted head and severely furrowed brow. He didn’t really blame Cas for needing convincing.
“Raphael’s troops meant to disable me by making me mortal. I have to admit, I didn’t expect such underhanded tactics from my siblings. I’m still not entirely sure how they managed it.”
It’s only when his forehead touches another that he pauses in his fall, desperately enthralled despite the fresh blood painting his brow.
“Sam’s debriefing the local PD, but he promised he’d bring back some dinner,” he said without preamble, looking to fill the space. His sore fingers reached the back of his stiff neck, idly tracing where a headache was burrowing into tattered nerves.
All he could grasp in that mind-shattering instant was the desire to respond before his atoms went up in smoke.
and I did NOT paint these nut-crushing pants on just for a bunch of pill-popping losers getting off to mass-marketed church iconography.”
“Cas you gotta give me something here,” Dean demanded, trying to temper his mounting panic. “I ain’t no warlock, but I’m pretty damned sure that you leave your vessel with a curse like this on you, you might not -”
“So, you’re absolutely sure that me digging my filthy mud-monkey paws around in those nice shiny feathers wouldn’t sully your precious angel flower or something?”
“The war in Heaven is of dire importance, Dean… but nevertheless, I promise will do my best to help you find out what’s wrong with Sam. Because you were right, and I do see it. There is something….
“Angelic flight is too fast for human eyes usually, but this.... I would like you to experience something other than nausea while flying, and this might be my only chance to give that to you.”
He didn’t have to, but he launched the shaking question out into the darkness anyway, misgivings forgotten.
God, he hated that he’d disturbed Cas’ cozy stance, the warmth on his shoulder evaporating as Cas shifted with concern.
“Yeah you’re a smart guy I get it, now all due respect, get the fuck out,” Dean snarled into his neck, every muscle taut with the extraordinary effort of keeping the boiling hysteria in his veins at bay.
“You must understand... yours is the brightest, most beautiful soul I have encountered in all of Creation. It calls my Grace to it even from the darkest of places. I know its brilliance by heart, and being able to touch it… to have you offer it freely
Dean was undeterred, and voraciously curious. And, as Cas had astutely pointed out, terrified, but for entirely different reasons than fatal dread. His heart kicked violently at his throat.
The words gut-punched him so hard, he felt his ribs ache. Happily, emotions for Dean Winchester killed boners faster than burrito night with his brother. On the flipside, this left him with actually having to deal with said feelings on the matter, since he was
“I know you’re in terrible pain.” Cas pressed on, calm as winter snow. His steady, rumbling voice washed over Dean, soothing and eucalyptus sharp. “I can help you.”
He watches the wrinkled expanse of Cas’ graciously turned back instead, trying to figure out what response would be appropriate.
“Fuck, Cas. Okay.” was all he had in him to say, though an arm wove itself around Cas’ hips and squeezed with all the warmth he was worth.
The angel's knowing eyes flicker briefly towards him, but he remains silent as he soon returns to contemplating the tranquil landscape. Dean's grateful for the time to unruffle his own feathers enough to hopefully coax the words out of his clenched throat.
Dean’s stomach sank into his heels. This was essentially a holy supernova seconds from happening, but he remained anchored, helplessly watching. The descent was happening so fast it was mind-boggling - the cracks breaching Cas’ skin were actually beginning to sizzle beneath his palms. A second ago, Cas was making jokes, and now he was literally unravelling, one puff of expelled Grace at a time. Dean wished he could touch the intangible wisps somehow and stuff the AWOL little jerks back inside Cas, but even then, he suspected it would have been like trying to stifle the flow of a broken dam with a cork.
, damnit. This kiss was an event, a big fucking happening - like the Dark Crystal becoming whole again, like Luke blowing up the Death Star - and Dean was lost to this massive realignment of his universe before he could even properly appreciate that this was also most likely a goodbye.
The angel waited him out as Dean ducked into his collar again, nosing the fabric open, helplessly magnetized. His control was slipping like water through his desperate, clutching fingers. He had mere seconds to explain a decade’s worth of emotion before his rational brain would permanently shut down. It was impossible, but he had to try. Cas deserved it, for the inevitable truth of what was going to happen here.
The mere effort of speech ignited more rivulets of Grace, and they crept ghoulishly from the corners of his crackling mouth. Dean kept trying to hold him together despite how the scorching glow seeped between his fingers. The angel’s palms weakly butted against his chest, in a vain attempt to expel him with bodily force. Dean choked back a wail of frustration at the attempt, but held steadfast to his face.
“Grace,” the angel said matter-of-factly, from right behind him. “Though right now, I’m not entirely certain.”
“You’re all I want,” Cas reiterates softly. There is wonder tainting the gravel tones this time, as though he’s just had a quiet realization of his own. He seems determined to brand this mantra into Dean’s skin, as if his soul hadn’t been enough.
“It was an unpleasant solution for you, and I’m sorry to have embarrassed you,” Cas began for him suddenly, “That being said, summoning a cupid would have taken hours that you possibly didn’t have. I did what I had to and I don’t regret it.”
Before Dean could acknowledge that, or swallow the brick suddenly lodged in his throat, Cas extended his arm and the rich, tingling joy of fingers suddenly scratching along his scalp made Dean groan out loud.
“No, you don’t know- you…” His mouth struggled to form the words around the indefensible keen of want gurgling up from his throat.
He swallowed hard as he recalled the relief he felt in that damned warehouse, at seeing the angel’s features return to normal between his hands… to see the bloodshot frenzy finally drain from his sad eyes. He’d done exactly jackshit to help with that, but in that moment he’d been so immensely grateful that the guilt hadn’t even set in until much later.
He’d faced thousands of otherworldly creations - gods and monsters alike - without batting a pretty eyelash. He wasn’t about to let one dour, tattered angel breathing down his back petrify him to the spot in a haze of unbidden desire. Except...oh. Maybe he was. It was definitely not his finest moment, in a string of moments with Cas each less fine than the next.
Cas swayed every so slightly, seemingly lost to the sensations sparked by Dean’s fingers. Dean felt his windpipe just about close up at the expression on his face.
Indeed, though he’d seen it a few times before and met a few that were more than deserving, the idea of angels dying was unpalatable even to Dean.
The wings bore down and crushed themselves inwards, seizing and electric as they tried to contain the impending event horizon. They forced him closer to the imploding angel, until his forehead touched the scorching surface of Cas’ skin. The heat hissed off him as his features bleached incandescent, and Dean was almost blinded... though not before catching sight of tears vaporizing right off Cas' cheeks.
Dean knew that the slight hitch to Cas’ voice, along with the teeny smile crinkling his stoic features translated to euphoria in Castiel-speak, or pretty damn close. Dean smiled widely as a few peals of laughter even escaped the angel as he lifted higher and higher, to the point where Dean had to stretch his arms far over his head to maintain buoyancy.
He carefully placed the black feather behind Dean’s ear, fingers lingering for just a moment too long. “You keep those.”
It’s blindingly gorgeous outside. Dean blinks for a moment against the mid-morning sun casting a warm glow over the Kansas flatlands below. The air is cool and sweet with Spring blossoms... and probably pollen, which gives him just short of 5 minutes before he starts leaking like a faucet from all of his facial orifices. Still, even histamine-supercharged Dean can appreciate relishing in some daylight and fresh air; the stale, submarine-like depths of the Bunker can sometimes get a little claustrophobic.
It didn’t really help matters any when the broken angel let his unkempt head fall against Dean’s stomach without any warning.
“Dean,” Cas interjected miserably, his eyes shining, “I rebuilt you from scattered, Hell-scorched atoms. I’ve held your soul in my hands. I fell from Heaven for you. In billions of years of existence, you’re the only thing that has made any of it worthwhile, to me. How do you think I feel? I fail to see how reiterating my love for you helps this situation in any way.”
“Once your mojo is back at 100% you’ll be able to block all that tiresome human shit out, don’t worry,” Dean snarked good-naturedly.
In guise of response, Cas stared at him in that pissed-off-owl sort of way he did sometimes. Dean suppressed the treacherous warmth he felt at the sight. So it always went.
“I was tending to my tomato plant and endeavouring a Spring cleaning of sorts, but then I thought I should take the opportunity to enjoy the weather fully. You and Sam seem to enjoy it, after all, when the occasion presents itself. I thought I would follow your example.”
He’s in the middle of an amused smirk when he realizes that’s probably one of the biggest lies he’s ever told - and he’s a prolific liar - but he’s nevertheless devoted to maintaining decorum if need be, for the sake of the angel’s dignity. Dean is a gentleman, after all. Sort of. Cas thankfully, just rolls those big blue eyes at him from above rosy cheeks.
The weak joking was overridden by a deafening woosh, and by the sudden and spectacular appearance of two truck-sized onyx wings. Inexplicably sprouted from Cas’ trenchcoated shoulder-blades, they extended to both walls of the kitchen, scintillating like oil slick and stars, and Dean suddenly just couldn’t get enough air into his lungs. He slid down to the icy tiles, burning bacon and scorched eggs forgotten.
‘Finally- finally,’ Dean thought, as Cas’ body turned towards him and he closed in, only to have his hands batted away and his temples promptly squashed by sturdy palms a moment later.
For now though, he retrieved the feather from his pocket and made a theatrical show of tossing it directly into the garbage disposal.
somehow, seemed to physically break his heart out of all the things that had happened to him that day. (Cas had mojo'ed it back together mere instants after they'd gotten into the Impala, but still.)
“Whoa whoa, Cas, I get that. It’s okay,” Dean interrupted, hands raised in surrender. “I’m grateful you didn’t let me turn into an enchanted horndog. I am.”
As expected, his stomach took a nosedive into his heels, but he nevertheless followed through with the other eye.
It was too much like a deliverance, like being plunged into a cold river after decades limping through the desert, like every country song Dean had ever heard. It was a sensation somewhere between having the best goddamned orgasm in his life, and literally being thrown into the sun. He was Icarus with his pants down, and he had no idea why this incomparable rapture had befallen him, how he had transformed into incomprehensible molten sunlight, where he began and Cas ended, if even he did end.
Dean, of course, didn’t want to sit and plan out the whole rescue mission. He just wanted Cas back. Sam decided that it would be best for Dean to go in with Jack to get Cas and to only get Cas. Deals with the Empty would be left up to Jack because Dean wouldn’t be able to stop himself from punching another cosmic being in the face. Since Sam and Jack were going to take forever to plan their rescue mission, Dean was going to plan what he was going to say as soon as he got Cas back. Dean stood in front of the mirror but looked down at his feet, feeling a mix of shame, nervousness, and anger. It was three words, but those three words were always hard to say no matter how strongly he felt them.
“You know the King James Version of the Bible is wrong. It is supposed to say, ‘Man shall not lie with boy’, not ‘Man shall not lie with man’. It was mistranslated. It was about pedophilia, not homosexuality. It sure would be ironic if it was considering Chuck has been with men.”
“Listen, buddy, you can’t stay.” Dean looked apologetic. He looked down at his hands. Why wasn’t he enough?
Dean recognized many of the faces as he navigated the crowd to find Cas. He kept pushing through the crowd past those he killed and watched die. Cas was the only thing on his mind. But despite heading towards him, he didn’t seem to be getting any closer. He moved faster, nearly bowling others over in his desperate attempt to reach Cas. He called out to him “Cas! Damn it, I know you can hear me you son of a bitch!” Sure enough, insulting him caused him to turn around. There was Cas’s face. His stupid, beautiful face that said, ‘
“I love you as in when I first laid a hand on you in Hell, I was lost. I love you as in the thing that broke me out of a homicidal, Naomi induced trance was being told I was needed, needed by you. I love you as in you are the one thing I could never have. I love you, Dean Winchester.” Cas pulled back from him. “And if that bothers you, I’ll stay here. You can forget me once and for all. Because I can’t exist in a world that I would be able to do the same. Because, Dean, a life without loving you isn’t one worth living.”
“I’m sorry that you’ve struggled for so long. Even if the world doesn’t accept you, I will. I know Sam and Jack will. We’re your family and we love you.”
Thing was, while indeed topless, Cas wasn’t exactly doing anything even remotely wild (much to Dean’s innermost chagrin). In fact, unless the angel was fixing to merge yoga and photosynthesis, Dean hadn’t the slightest inkling of what he was doing. Not that he really cared.
There was no way Cas could ever understand the desperate kind of ache Dean felt at seeing him like that anyway. He barely understood it himself, or rather refused to acknowledge that this roiling, heated anxiety unfurling in his chest scared him far more than anything he hunted. Of course, Dean subsequently felt an urgent need to escape the burgeoning Moment, but those wings he admired so much were keeping him prisoner in a cocoon of self-loathing awkwardness.
“I didn’t quite anticipate this but….it would seem that my hold on my vessel is weakening,” he returned casually. “The spell’s unfortunate side effect of forcefully manifesting my wings seems to be taking up most of my depleted strength and-” Castiel halted to catch his breath which in itself, was an incongruous notion.
This time, Dean did drop the spatula in favour of grabbing a bicep-full of angel before said frazzle-headed bestie bee-lined for the cosmos. Thusly anchored, Cas had little choice but to turn back and face Dean, though he looked twitchier than a spooked cat.
It was approaching 1AM when Dean finally decided he could take no more. He tore himself from his sweat-soaked sheets and launched himself to his feet with a howl of frustration. There would be no sleep tonight. Nothing had given him peace from his painful, vibrating limbs, churning belly and feverish thoughts; not TV, not porn, not polishing every weapon he owned. He felt as though he was teetering on the edge of a heart attack that refused to drop the other shoe. Chamber. Whatever. His veins thrummed with the frenetic wingbeats of a hundred beehives, his vision swam, and while he felt the lure of his one remedy wrenching at him from beyond the warm grey walls, he fought the roiling hunger with every atom he possessed.
He’d wanted to object further, but he’d grown too distracted by how far backwards the wings had towed him. He was suddenly aware of Cas breathing against the small of his back; steady, hot wisps of air scorching the skin there doing sweet fuckall to allay the mounting tension in his body.
His voice was so low, so close, that Dean thought fleetingly that one small stretch of his neck would allow him to stifle it with his mouth.
Dean loves him so much it hurts. More than the wounds that mar his skin, more than the bitter notion that Cas had again drained himself without hesitation to bring him back from the brink. He thinks Cas knows, but he hasn’t ever been able to bring himself to words. Dean’s love, after all, is molten stone from deep below the bedrock. It sows heat and destruction to wherever it flows, and unfailingly fells those in its tragic path. He fights hard to keep the ruinous burn of it to himself, but sometimes it seeps through unguarded crevasses. He loves with fierce, scalding abandon. And Cas, well.
“M’fine,” Dean grunted. His forehead was pressed to Baby’s cool glass, but it soon beaded with sweat anyhow.
swoon. He wasn't even sure which instance Cas was referring to, but he was too soon awash in all the ways he was ill-equipped and undeserving to answer such a declaration.
“Okay, so… spring cleaning?” he announces cheerfully, “Sounds like a good idea and frankly, I been meaning to do it for a while. The place could use a good scrub down, it’s a nice day, and we got nothing else going on.”
“It’s not inconvenient, okay? I get it.” Dean admitted, as he relented to the confined space. “Look, did you ward the place at least?”
It was all just too stupid. Too sudden. Dean had always known that his existence was an arthritic coin toss at the best of times, and he’d been okay with that. Massively deserving of it, even. But for it to end like this, in the dingiest room Bumfuck Nowhere had to offer... it was insulting and insufficient for a creature as vast and beautiful as Cas. If all Dean could offer was the meager comfort of his arms and his life such as it was, while celestial radiance consumed his best friend, he would freely give it. The realization hit him hard and far too late - dying was something he’d only ever considered doing for Sam, once upon a time, and yet…Cas was his family too, now. And Cas deserved more than the hand he’d been dealt, mistakes and all. Cas deserved everything, and once more, Dean had failed him.
The ginger had strayed far from her usual geek tees and jeans, and had opted for something a few palettes darker. Dean could not recall for the life of him ever seeing her in
“I can’t…” he gritted, voice thin. Long, airy wisps of insurgent grace seeped from his mouth as he spoke. “I will burn you…No… control. Please Dean.
He wasn’t born yesterday, dude.” Then Sam dons that smarmy, all-knowing smirk of his, and Dean knows damn well by now to brace himself.  “I mean don’t get me wrong:  your coddling is
Sam remembers now, the expression of righteous fury clouding Cas’ features after the taunting phone call, the likes of which he hadn’t seen since they’d first met the angel. How Cas, who was once Heaven’s greatest strategist, had stormed out of the bunker with barely a second thought - plan or consequences be damned - while he and Jack were left to haplessly scramble for weapons in his thundering wake. Arming themselves had proven pointless though, because weak as his Grace was lately, Cas hadn’t spared a single spark in razing the decrepit shack without a single hitch of hesitation. Like a tidal wave through a shattered dam, the angel had blasted the door in and growled his way through the comically-raised henchman eyebrows until nothing and no one were left. How the ceaseless hordes of evil underlings were even shocked anymore still baffled Sam.
Dean's vast sense of unworthiness immediately clamped his throat shut, but with Cas’ fingers leisurely caressing the freckled expanse of his forearm for a long, quiet moment, his opinion soon became moot.
“Okay, so just… uh...just rest until the spell wears off,” Dean suggested unhelpfully, releasing him.
“And I don’t mean in a brotherly way,” Sam clarified wryly, “I mean he loves you in a manly, sweaty, grunty way that I never want to hea-”
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel greets as per usual, retrieving the mug in Dean’s frozen left hand. It’s the one sporting the cartoon bumble bee. “Thank you for the coffee.”
A trembling sigh escaped him, and his hands instantly retreated to the back of his neck as he stood immobile, looking like he’d seen a ghost, or whatever it was that actually could freak out a hunter. Apparently this involved frazzled, doe-eyed warriors of the Lord and their criminally-smoochable lips. And oh yeah, transcendental soul-sex or whatever the hell
Cas gapes at him some more, his lip twitching into a light snarl of sheer bewilderment. He can't exactly blame him, Dean's brain has apparently chosen to devolve into geeky babbling and he can't seem to control it.
Dean could barely restrain his outrage at the gesture, but Cas’ eyes were flickering back and forth from
Charlie casually exploded into the vehicle, as was her wont, and crushed Dean in an immediate and inescapable chokehold of a hug. His adored adoptive little sister was one of the few who held an unlimited free pass for those, so he indulged her.
Fingers wiggled out of his grip, and arms slinked around his taught frame. Dean’s breath stilled in his lungs as Cas butted his forehead against Dean’s in the dark, an splayed a firm hand over his heart.
“It’s because we are bonded, Dean.” he explained simply, as though this was the most obvious truth in the universe. Perhaps it was.
“‘Kay well, in the meantime, dontcha think this game of naked angel pinball you’re playing might attract some attention from the yocals?” Dean asked, sweeping a demonstrative hand towards the motel suites and their
. Dean was used to being burdened. His entire life as a Winchester had been a smothering, burning blanket of impossible responsibilities imposed on him from far too young an age. While not always thrilled about it, he’d met fate with the pigheadedness dictated by his DNA, alongside Sam and Cas. They’d won as much as they’d lost, and by
Dean knew the angel’s terrifying skill set well enough not to question any of that, but the mention of his brother steered him straight past the occasion to mock Cas’ clothing situation.
“Fuck off, I’m not under the spell anymore, dammit!” Dean groused, squirming aimlessly. Castiel finally released him, his features clearing.
Dean says nothing as he relinquishes the drink, and just stares. Stares so hard and googly-eyed that his corneas might as well just roll out a welcome mat for every single allergen in the state.
“Cas? Hey, hey, what’s wrong?” He asked. Cas tried to sit up, but Dean kept a firm hand on his chest. “Can you tell me what happened? Did you have a nightmare?” Dean sat next to him on the bed.
Sam entered the room followed by Eileen. “Dean? Hey Cas, you’re back.” Sam looked relieved, then he scrunched up his forehead. “You don’t look too hot. Let me get you some food and water.”
Sam took in a deep breath and contemplated on what to tell her and where to start. He thought about the events of the previous days and how hard it what just to keep getting up, especially with Chuck actually beating him and Dean down.
The same Billie who betrayed them and sent the kid back to make it loud. The same Billie they took when the angel finally expressed his love and felt that happiness. That silly Billie.
“So now that everyone knows their roles, they can go.” Amara led Gabriel and Raphael to the portal for Heaven and Crowley walked to the one leading to Hell. They left and Jack approached Michael and Lucifer with an archangel blade in hand.
So, the angel was back, but it was loud. It was so LOUD. It seemed that every being was awake now. Making noise and sounding like insolent, whining children. They just wanted to sleep! They needed everyone to shut up and go back to sleep, but there were so many of them. At least Castiel stayed quiet. He knew the rules, and he made a deal.
Dean got up, and Cas’s eyes slid down his toned and quite impressive figure. “I’ll go with you. Just give me a second.” He caught Cas staring. “Like what you see?” He most certainly did. He nodded and Dean moved closer. “What do you like about it?” He was centimeters away from Cas’s face. He wanted to flirt, how cute. Cas pulled him in by the waist.
Their eyes were held a soft gaze before Dean said, “You know you have to be human, right? You’ll lose your grace, and you won’t be able to be an angel anymore.”
He let out a whistle, beckoning Miracle to come over. Eileen’s eyes brightened as the otterhound ran over and sat down at Sam’s feet.
“Do you think I won’t be useful to you and Sam as a hunter?” Cas’s demeanor suddenly changed and seemed more hurt.
“I am a Winchester. And you will listen to what I have to say, or your eternity will be spent trying to keep them,” Jack gestured to the crowd, “quiet.”
“Dean, you go in. grab Cas, extract his grace, and get out. Got it?” Dean cast his eyes downward. He knew that in order to rescue Cas from the Empty he would have to extract his grace and make him human. That was the only way he could get out of his deal and return with Dean, but just because it had to be that way didn’t mean Dean liked it one bit. Cas was his- Cas was an angel, and while that didn’t define him, it was one thing he was sure as hell proud of. But it also made him feel like that was his only use to the Winchesters, and Dean was going to make sure he changed Cas’s mindset. “Dean?” Sam pressed.
The Empty turned to Dean who was holding Cas’s face in his hand and looking completely in love. “Hey pretty boy, get it out and go.” The Empty sighed. “And as for the rest of you. Scram.” They snapped and two portals were made: one for Heaven, one for Hell. Amara appeared between the portals likely to sort the still confused beings into where they were supposed to go. The portals flashed as angels and demons were sent back to strengthen Heaven or give Rowena a massive headache in Hell. That was until the only ones left were Crowley and the archangels. Jack wasn’t familiar with Crowley, but he recognized him from the memories he received before he was born. He approached the group cautiously.
“Everything. Because I already know every inch of you. No criticism coming from the one who put you back together.” Light color rose to Dean’s cheeks. Cas would be a romantic. His stomach growled and he laughed. “I need food. Didn’t Sam say he’d bring something?” He looked around but saw nothing. “Do we have peanut butter and grape jelly?” Peanut butter and grape jelly sandwiches were his favorite food last time he was human.
“There never has been a time and there never will be a time where he isn’t my angel.” Dean pushed through a crowd of angels and demons to get to Cas. Young love, disgusting.
He was back in the Empty. It was colder than he remembered, and he pulled his trench coat tighter around him. This wasn’t his trench coat. He was wearing a red hoodie and green shirt. This was what he wore when-
“And you won’t be able to make any deals with any being or siphon power off of others. Along with that, I’ve ensured that there will be no demon willing to make deals with you or angel willing to trade grace because as soon as you break those rules and even attempt to make contact, well let’s just say where you’ll end up makes the cage look like Paradise.” It was really about time they learned their lessons.
Sam watched as his brother and kind of son, kind of nephew, walked through a portal to a place that neither he nor Dean had previously explored.
Sam paused and thought about the fear he felt when he saw Lucifer again. How he tricked Dean into believing that he was Cas, similar to how he tricked Sam into believing that he was Jess. Thinking of him stirred up memories of all that time in the cage. Eileen put a comforting hand over his.
He felt his mouth go dry and something in his throat. “When you said that you loved me. Did you mean it as in you’re my best friend or…” Dean trailed off and his eyes darted to Cas’s lips and licked his own.
When he woke up, he didn’t know how much later it was. He heard a rustling behind him and turned to see Dean facing away from him, presumably asleep. His heart soared.
Sam looked at Eileen’s widened eyes and took a big swig of his beer. Sam let her process that load of information while he started in on his salad.
“I will be okay. I have you now. I didn’t last time.” Cas took his hand. The reminder of what happened when Cas was human the first time and how he had kicked him out to live on his own hit him.
“As long as it doesn’t distract you from your work.” Jack replied. He’d been quietly observing up to this point and decided to rejoin the conversation. “You three will be responsible for overseeing all Heavenly activity. I have faith that I should not have to interfere. For Hell, we already have someone covering over there.” He turned to Crowley. “Your mother is doing a very good job.” Crowley rolled his eyes. He should have known that witch would take over in his absence. “You get to travel. You will bring the Winchesters intel and help Rowena keep Hell in line.” Crowley shrugged it off. At least he didn’t have to suffer through a mortal existence with the older archangels.
The words took the desired effect as Lucifer and Michael’s faces looked both horrified and disgusted at having to resolve their problems and be human.
“It never bothered me. At least, not as much as you think it did. The time I grew up in, being different, liking guys wasn’t accepted as much as it is now. Even now, it’s still a struggle for us.” He was well aware of the discrimination brought about by people who had nothing better to do than hate others for who they love. He remembered the homophobic preacher he killed after he took in the Leviathan.
“If you know what’s good for you, you’ll stay quiet.” Castiel said nothing. “Good angel.” The Empty moved towards the hunter. “Hello, Dean.” They appeared as Castiel.
“Just bring it to my room.” Dean moved Cas through the room toward the hallway. At Sam’s look, he responded, “He needs to rest.” He was halfway down the hall when he announced, “I’d get out of the war room. Jack was right behind us with Michael and Lucifer.” He threw open the door, Cas stumbled to the bed, and laid down on top of the messily made bed. It was nice and plush, and it smelled like Dean. He could hear Dean in the back of his mind. “You take all the time you need.”
Dean smiled at him and rolled his eyes, “Yes. It’s a great thing.” He paused, thinking about his next words carefully. “Since we’re together now, I was wondering if you would want to stay here now?”
Spending eternity unable to sleep in peace, truly a living hell. “You can make it quiet? Forever?” Jack nodded. “How?” the Empty was skeptical but starting to get desperate.
“They can go. But Castiel stays.” the Empty wouldn’t give up everything so easily. Jack was lucky he didn’t have the Winchester temper.
Dean drew back as if he had been stung. “Cas, come on, man. Sam and Jack need you. Cas, I need you. I- “
He took a moment to picture those bright sky blue eyes and how he felt when he last saw them. All the things he couldn’t say, not enough time, but that wouldn’t be a problem for him, never again. He was going to get Cas back, and this time he was going to make him stay. His jaw clenched, he lifted his head to look himself in the eyes. “Cas- “his voice croaked out. Maybe he needed some water, but then again, when was the last time he drank anything but booze? He considered grabbing a quick drink, but no, he couldn’t drink, he didn’t want what he had to say to be a drunken confession. He cleared his throat and tried again, “Cas, I- “, he let out a frustrated sigh. “Damnit.” Why was this so hard? What was the point of dragging his ass out if he couldn’t even say the damn words? One more try, one more and he could do it. “Cas, I lo- “, a knock came at the bathroom door.
Dean looked to his eyes, silently begging Cas for forgiveness for the information he was about to deliver. “The loophole, you wouldn’t outlive us. You would be human. You would have to give up your grace to get out of here.” Dean paused trying to gauge a reaction from Cas. He only stared blankly ahead. “I know it isn’t ideal, and I would never ask this of you if- “
“I can’t do it. It has to be you.” Dean refused to look him in the eyes as he held out the angel blade he had brought with him.
“Are you asking if I remember kissing you? Because the answer is yes.” Dean relaxed and softened his gaze.
“You promise? I sleep forever, never to be woken again by them?” the Empty held back their desperation, but Jack was smart, and he could see through the façade.
“Seems like I’m not the only idiot.” Cas's head tilted to the side. “Which one of us said that everything I do, I do for love? How can you not know? How can you think I don’t feel the same? Cas, how can you not know that I love you? What about my most raw instinct being to find you and leave Purgatory with you, wasn’t obvious? Not killing you under the influence of the Mark or telling you “I’d rather have you, cursed or not” didn’t strike you as love?”
His mouth opened in protest and he let out a “No I’m n- why would you- how- I am not an idiot,” he ended indignantly. He hurried, “You still didn’t answer me.”
“Fine by me, just remember who’s who. Don’t want to call your Dad if you mean me.” He met Dean’s gaze with all the love and affection he had for their small family in his heart. He heard the tapping of paws and watched as Miracle joined them in the kitchen and went to Jack. He hadn’t met the dog yet, but he was glad to see that Jack had a companion. His hand met Dean’s, and they intertwined their fingers. They were at peace, and they were together.
Cas’s words back to him, but he meant it. All of it. He was finally able to speak his truth and he was not going to hold back. He was going to let him know how loved he was every day for the rest of their shared lives. With a light kiss on the forehead, he pulled Cas into his arms, hands aggressively bunching up the dirty trench coat and face buried between his neck and shoulders. “Please don’t ever leave me again. Don’t go where I can’t follow. I don’t think I could keep going if I lost you again.” Dean started to sob, and Cas brought a comforting hand to Dean’s head. He let it all out. Everything he had repressed for years, all that had happened over the past few days, every moment he went without letting Cas know how he felt. Several shaky breaths later, Dean had calmed down enough to let out a small laugh and went back to holding Cas’s face. "Don't tell Sam about our chick flick moment."
He tried to keep it light, “Most that’ll happen is we get in a lovers’ quarrel and you spend the night on the couch.” The confusion on the man’s face made it seem like that was the wrong move.
. Light emanated from the bowl and shot towards the portal. It grew brighter and Jack and Dean stepped towards it.
He watched the portal’s slight, fluid movements with anticipation. How did time work in the Empty? He shook his head and occupied his mind by picking up some reading, but he couldn’t focus because he kept checking his phone waiting on more updates from Eileen.
“Do you need me? Or are you just letting your fear of abandonment take over your decision-making? Are you here for me or for you?”
“Yeah, I’m good.” Dean opened the door. “Let’s do this.” He followed Sam into the war room where Jack was standing at attention with a look of determination on his face not seen before. “Kid, relax. We got this.” Jack relaxed his shoulders but kept his brow furrowed.
Dean could only huff a bitter laugh to mask his sudden terror at the idea that he’d misread the situation entirely. He’d been so certain he’d seen something in Cas’ expression too… in this instance and in others before, but maybe it was just the wishful thinking of one forced to the breaking point of a decade’s worth of pining. Either way, Dean had been on edge for hours, and brittle and tired as he was, he figured this was as good a time as any to throw himself off the proverbial cliff.
“I don’t like hearing about that poor girl, Kaia’s stepfather. I have the feeling I’d like to beat the hell out of him,” Dean confessed to Benny after they went over the afternoons events as they began their drive back to Cottonwood Falls,
’ between us,” Cas went on in confusion, “and I have always respected that. I would never betray your trust; I know the situation was not real. ”
that spell, Cas. No matter what you did. We’ve all done shitty things. Unforgivable things, maybe. But your penance is to keep fighting, you get me? To keep trying for the people you had to leave behind, and for those who could still be saved. That’s the only meaning to any of this. The only reason.”
It took a while, but once he’d painstakingly regained some pale imitation of dignified footing, Dean risked a glimpse at said doofus’ face again.
This was originally the last chapter. I did continue this fic, but I'm still hesitant because I feel it's sufficient as is. (Cheese overload, haha). It was meant to be a short, intense vignette in the middle of the night. A blip on their radar, I guess, that could have happened "between the lines". The rest I've written for this goes beyond that, but has no definable end yet, so for all intents and purposes, this is the end. I hope you enjoyed the angsty fluff-fest, and apologies for any inconsistencies/cliches. I'd be delighted to hear what your thoughts were. Thank you warmly for reading! Cheers!
Dean would usually have stopped short at such a spectacle of tanned skin, besmirched as it is, but tonight it brings no sense of awe.
Soon, the angel returns them in kind, and gently covers Dean’s hand with his own. Dean finds himself gently stroking through dark locks and darker feathers still, while he undertakes his gentle and delightfully futile work.
After a long moment of silence which surprisingly, grows increasingly comfortable, Dean drains the last of his drink and sets the empty cup on the ledge.
Cas sighed, raking trembling hands through his dishevelled hair. This expression of grief was proof enough that Cas was off-kilter. He usually let the deaths of angels and humans roll off his tongue without so much as a blink, regardless of how he inwardly felt about them. The brief, vulnerable gesture left Dean starving with the need to comfort him, but he locked his arms even more tightly around himself, his nails digging into the buzzing skin of his biceps.
What the hell?!”  Dean started panting and wheezing. “Oh, god! What the fuck am I going…to do?! What am I supposed to do?!”
Castiel ran his hand down his chest across the plane of his stomach until he felt his cock. He did not grasp it, but ever so gently ran the tips of his fingers and knuckles back and forth up and down the slowly increasing length of it. He thought of being on that bed with the muscular male body pressed against him, of the feel of their two cocks pressed against one another, and of wanting more.
Castiel pointed out the pond on the way to the barnhouse. The kids were excited to  see that the pond was closer to their house than Dean’s part of the property.
Dean looked at his brother and nodded. He noticed that Adam, his youngest brother, was there too. Along with his kids Ben and Emma and his parents John and Mary.
“OK. I understand how you and your brother feel, Emma, but first of all, you shouldn’t interfere in other people’s relationships. And if their father hasn’t dated in
Gabriel gave her the once over. He wasn’t sure if she was actually disgusted or not, at first. And if she was disgusted, if it was with him liking Mr. Lion Mane or Mr. Lion Mane being interested in him.
“We know that Anna has probably filled your ears with all sorts of fantastical horror stories about Castiel and who knows what else she’s come up with. We know you’ve been busy with classes at the university, but she’s been out of sorts for sometime now.” Naomi glanced at Chuck, who nodded sympathetically in agreement.
“So, I just wanted to say,” Jack continued to the auditorium, “that I didn’t mean for it to happen, but technically, I did the first hit, even if it was an accident. It’s all my fault, because I did hit Eliot first. Or my elbow did. It still hurts. I’m sorry I hurt your nose, Eliot. So, I just wanted to say it’s all my fault and no one should get punished because I did it first.”
“OK, I’ll tell you. What color eyes do they have? Pamela? Uncle Lee? Uncle Benny? The real estate lady? That pretty firefighter lady, I forget her name? The firefighter guy, Anthony? The farm machine salesman? BLUE! They all have blue or hazel-blue eyes. Hair? They all have DARK hair, almost black. Are any of them short? NO, they’re all pretty tall, even the girls. Bodies? They’re all a VERY FIT. They’re all READERS, SMART, QUIET, BUT FUNNY.” Ben had gotten excited and was almost stomping as he paced back and forth explaining his theory. “I am TELLING YOU, DAD HAS A TYPE and Dr. Novak is his type!” Sam heard a fist pound on furniture.
“Deputy Linus is right. Donuts and cookies don’t last long around here.” Sheriff Mills reached out to shake Gabriel’s hand. “Welcome. So let’s see what you have there.”
Dean woke up in a hospital bed. He opened his eyes and blinked and then closed them again. The light was too bright. He groaned and covered his face with his hands.
“Ben, pull out some of those ramekins, enough for everyone, and stack them on the table for the ice cream. Emma, grab the scoop out of that drawer by you.”
“Dad, may I go first?” Claire asked. I really would like to go first and get it out of the way, so we can focus on what you wanted to have the discussion about.”
“I just saw a falling star! That’s so cool!” Claire yelled as her head popped over the front seat between Jack and Castiel.
“Please mind Mr. Winchester, Clark, or you and I will talk about how lonely it is at home when you’re grounded.” Chris instructed her son. Clark nodded in mild irritation.
“You have to remember though, it’s very small and not anything like the big hospital in the city. It’s not even really a hospital,” Castiel reminded him. “There’s not as much to do and see. I don’t want you to get bored.”
When Cas didn’t answer and instead turned his scarlet features away, Dean realized just how deeply he’d stepped in it. A prickling silence enfolded them both for a painfully long while.
....” Cas castigated him, words tumbling out in Enochian and English, each more anguished than the next. “I pulled you… out of Hell so you could live. Get OUT!”
Dean broke out of his stupor to huff out an incredulous laugh. He was aiming to bitingly inform Cas that he was
version,” Dean balked, his acrophobia spiking dangerously around his belly in protest. “I like it just fine right here.”
This time, Dean did move forward to sit beside him, quavering confidence be damned. Christ, there wasn’t much he could say to something like that, but he was no stranger to bearing the weight of countless atrocities on one’s shoulders. Sometimes it helped just to have someone there.
“Of course, Dean,” the angel acquiesced, “though I’m…” His sentence trailed off as the steady pulse of wing-beats suddenly hitched a little.
“If you love him Dean, just try again. Cas’ never given up on you, so… don’t give up on him. You both have given enough, and I just want you to try for whatever happiness you can get in this crappy lot we’ve been given. I know I have.”
The mirror was cracked and grey, but it nevertheless served up his haggard reflection with merciless clarity.
He is almost overcome with wonder, the bucket nearly careening to the floor. Cas doesn’t seem to notice.
“‘Course. I told you we could handle one little vamp’s nest. We used to do it all by our lonesome long before you showed up, Sparkles.”
Dean feels himself flushing three shades darker, and tells himself it’s all righteous indignation. It’s definitely
“I’m so glad my humiliation is useful to you,” the angel snapped, turning in on himself. “I suppose it wouldn’t be the first time.”
Donning an unmistakably proud glint in his eye, Castiel wordlessly extended a hand to help him back up.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel laughed. It was such a rare and gorgeous sound that it caused Dean to turn back towards him with a mirroring smile of his own. It only widened when Cas reached over and cupped his jaw in gentle invitation, raw wonder alight in his eyes.
Despite how secretly impressed he was with Cas for the devastating burn, he feigned affront. It was, after all,
“Cas?” he asked again, wariness mounting in his chest. His pulse skyrocketed and he instinctively reached for the knife he’d stupidly left on a nearby nightstand, not that it would make any damned difference. A faint groan escaped the heaving mass on the floor. Instead of the weapon, Dean risked a grope at the dusty lamp sitting crookedly on the nightstand. The dim orange bulb sputtered and buzzed its hardest, finally providing enough visual context for Dean to understand what he thought he was seeing. It didn’t help much. Squinting in a way that would give the angel himself a run for his money, Dean finally made out Castiel’s perma-tousled dark hair beneath the heap of what he could only surmise were feathers.
He barely had a second to contemplate the fire he found returned in Cas’ eyes before they closed altogether and he was being soundly kissed. It should have felt momentous. Dean had built it up to earth-shattering proportions after all, after having suffered years’ worth of imagining it in mercilessly vivid detail. He fiercely longed to actually enjoy those warm, plush lips against his, but all he felt was the magic seizing out of him all at once, a tingling death throw which throttled him all the way down to his toes until he shuddered in relief. Just like that, it was over.
Cas’ partial mortality was downright unfathomable in fact, not to mention probably incredibly disturbing to the angel himself. Downgrading to slug status was probably close to the human equivalent. He wondered how Cas could stand it, how he was so calm, or conscious for that matter… especially since long, wispy coils of disrupted grace were worryingly wafting from his injuries, still. Dean felt another pang of sympathy well up in his chest, but swallowed it down. Angelbro or not, Cas hadn’t exactly been Mother Theresa lately.
“They… could use some air,” the angel explains simply. He stands still, taking up a post beside the low couch he has found. Dean knows it isn’t very cozy, but Castiel doesn’t confirm. He waits patiently as he has always done, for a thus far unspoken invitation.
“Dean,” Cas halted him, suddenly taking hold of the itchy fabric and pulling until he reached Dean’s wrist. Dean felt the contact like a current sizzling all over his skin. He also found himself captivated by the slight tremor animating Cas’ fingers… how the angel suddenly couldn’t look at him despite years of staring-related transgressions.
“Whatever man. Guy spills his heart out to you and you try to decapitate him. That’s real nice, Cas… real romantic,” he grouched.
At this, the angel frowned, the wings pausing their aerial tai-chi or whatever it was they were doing, in concert. A sturdy, solemn hand landed on Dean’s shoulder as he stared sullenly into the ground.
His treacherous heart hurled itself against his rib cage in a fit of Pavlovian glory, and Dean practically tore out a stitch in his haste to leave the bathroom.
, for lack of a better word.” The great black wings quivered a little to highlight the remark, while Dean couldn’t help the slight swell of pride at the use of the term. That definitely wasn’t something they taught in angel school.
him if he ever got back down to sweet, blessed firm ground. Yeah, he was going to steal the angel blade right from his stupid, stinky trench-coat, bend him over and shove it right up-
“No,” Sam insisted, placing a reassuring hand on Cas’ slumped shoulder. “No, buddy. He just uh… he needs some time. It’s uh- not about you. Well, not
He just didn’t think it would be now - like right now - in the middle of the garage, with an unwitting audience.
He vainly struggled against the man-handling, but this only resulted in cementing his current position as the powerless little peon that he was. Beneath his outward grumbling at the vexing situation, something obnoxiously pleasant squirmed its way through him. It often happened when Cas overpowered him (or anyone, really), and he tried not to think too hard on what
Suddenly, the glowering pillar of righteously furious, iron-shouldered celestial crumbled into himself and- was that a flush on his rumpled face?
Dean wasn’t sure if he should ask why he had earned the latter, while Bobby had gotten his guts stir-fried. Shaky hands. Right.
“You were under the influence of a spell. I would never have left you to suffer, but I also would never take advantage,” declared Cas gravely.
,” Dean recited cheekily against Cas’ lips, his heart pounding, before Cas endeavoured to shut him up.
Okay so somewhere, somehow, for some reason, Cas was parading around half-naked, apparently on purpose. (Because no Big Bad Dean had ever encountered had taken up the fearsome habit of meticulously folding the clothes of its victims… not even the ones who
“Look,” Cas ordered him, his thundering voice far too close to Dean’s earlobe for any semblance of fairness in life.
Piqued, Dean finally rose from the small bed and decided he’d prefer skewering stitches into his hide than to continue this conversation with the angel who thought of him as a regrettable Plan B.
He begrudged himself the weakness, but Cas had become a constant. Family, though the term felt somewhat lacking, if he was honest. And maybe Dean resented him just a little bit, for becoming just another thing he didn’t deserve, which the universe would inevitably see fit to rip away from him or use against him.
At this, Cas finally looked at him. The striking blues made Dean falter as they always did, but he swallowed down his thundering heart.
This was how Dean saw him. Nothing ever good enough or done right. He was never present and always causing some apocalyptic level threat to break loose or bringing about cosmic consequences. Dean was too good for him, but he loved him because he was so good. “Goodbye, Dean.” Dean…Dean…Dean…
She signed and said back, “Right back at you.” She took his hand, and they walked down the stairs to the portal. Eileen watched the portal for a second and signed to Sam
“Of course, I’ll get you in your bed.” Dean started to head towards Cas’s room, but Cas didn’t move.
“Even if I did, what would be the point? I would outlive all of you except Jack. What kind of life would that be?” Dean bit his lip and hesitated to tell him the next part. Cas caught on to it, “What? What are you not telling me?”
“Don’t worry, I got you.” Cas’s weight shifted onto Dean and they moved towards the portal. The Empty was now mostly vacant with only the small group gathered by the Heaven and Hell portals. They walked on and through the one leading back to the bunker, to a new life that would be spent living each moment for each other.
“It’s something I never thought was possible between us. I always thought that me having a male vessel would bother you since you always seemed so defensive of your sexuality.” He could tell that what he said had upset Dean. “Does it still bother you?”
“I’m not playing at anything. You’re going to give us Cas or we’re going to take him. Either way, he’s not staying here.”
“I don’t know, just woke up.” He was hungry and thirsty; he recognized the sensations. He got up from the bed and stretched.
“Can we still watch the Michael and Lucifer fistfights from the ‘holy throne room’?” Gabriel smirked.
“I know that. You believed you were doing the right thing. You always do. Maybe don’t toss me out this time around.” Even though he had said it in a joking tone, Dean knew he was really pleading with him to be accepted.
“Yeah, she’s on her way. She said she would be here in about an hour.” Sam smiled. Dean was glad that his brother’s girlfriend would keep him company while Jack and Dean ventured into the unknown. Sam gathered some supplies in two small hex bags and handed them to Dean. He looked up curiously at Sam, “Humans aren’t supposed to be in the Empty. These are going to protect you and Cas from anything that might attack you and being erased from existence. As soon as you get his grace out, plant one on him.” Sam answered his unasked question. Dean shoved them in his pocket, making sure that they were secure. He grabbed an extra angel blade and slid it up his sleeve, now mostly ready to go.
“He made a deal.” The Empty bit out. Jack sighed internally. Cosmic beings always made life so hard. Maybe that statement sounded hypocritical considering Jack was a cosmic being.
“Yeah, we should go. Hold on.” Dean pulled a small cloth out and pressed it to the self-inflicted wound on Cas’s neck. “Hold that on there until we can get you some first aid.” He stood up and using Cas’s free hand, brought him up as well. He wobbled and seemed like would have fallen over again if Dean hadn’t wrapped his arm around his waist. “Easy there, tiger. Can you walk?” Cas nodded and tried to walk on his own. He was too weak to even go two steps.
“Welcome to the Empty, I’m the entity who runs the joint, and you’re all dead. Is that all? Can you just go back to sleep?” the Empty ended with contempt.
“I have no doubt that losing my grace will be hard and not to mention painful, but if it means having a chance at true happiness, it's worth it. You’re worth it, Dean. All that and more. I would do everything for you and everything to be with you. You do what you need to.” His face made Dean’s heart hurt. The expression was pained and loving.
Cas laid back on the bed. “You’re welcome to lay down too.” Would he do it? Was this too fast? Sure, they were going to start sharing it anyway, but he wouldn’t mind if they started sooner rather than later.
“And what do you think would make me want to go back to a world that wants nothing with me? To people who don’t want me unless they have something to gain from me? What is left for me on Earth?” the tone was scornful, and it had its desired effect.
Sam knew she wasn’t referring to the past few days. He still hadn’t told her everything about his time in Hell, what he could remember of it. He smiled, grateful to have someone as amazing as Eileen to be there for him.
“I’ve just lost my grace and I’m in a vast plane of existence where my status as a mortal should render me incapable of such a function as existence.”
Sam joined her on the floor. He scratched behind her ears then got up again remembering that Miracle probably hadn’t been fed since before Dean and Jack left. He walked to the kitchen, and Eileen and Miracle followed. He figured that since he was getting something for Miracle, he might as well make something for Eileen and himself too.
“I thought we already agreed that I would stay here. At least I thought that was what we agreed upon in the Empty.”
It seemed that when he and Cas made eye contact that the space between them suddenly closed and before Dean could stop himself, he was tackling Cas to the floor. He had landed right on top of Cas. Feeling unusually flustered by being in such close proximity to his best friend. He got up and pulled Cas up with him. “Well, that’s one way to greet someone.” Dean tried to joke. “Cas, I- Jack and I came to get you out.” He knew his eyes were pleading with Cas to understand him.
Dean brought his hand to Cas’s face and softly caressed it. “Less dumb, less ass.” His eyes flickered between Cas’s lips and eyes just before leaning in for a kiss. It was soft and awkward. Dean had kissed a lot of people in his life, most of them women, but none of those could compare to what he was experiencing at that moment. He had always spent quite a bit of time staring at Cas’s lips and occasionally wondered how they would feel against his. He would stop before his mind went too far. He wouldn’t have to wonder anymore. Gentle, chapped, and warm, Dean didn’t think he would ever be able to get enough. He slowly pulled back from the kiss to put their foreheads together and bring Cas closer to him. “I love you. I want you, and I need you. I don’t want to forget about you or live without you. A life without you in it isn’t worth living.” Internally, Dean rolled his eyes for repeating,
He was comforted by her statement and was about to respond when the light emanating from the portal began to flash. He stood up quickly and headed over to the war room. The portal continued flashing, and Sam checked on the spell. It seemed to be burning through its fuel. Sam quickly gathered the necessary ingredients and threw them in along with more of his blood. There’s got to be something else he could use instead, right? He lifted his gaze to the portal and began to wonder how things were going on the other side.
Cas stepped into Dean’s “personal space”, but he had no protests. “I guess we’re both a couple of dumbasses.”
“Sam knows. I told him a while back that I like guys, but I’m not gay. He said that I’m bisexual and that I wasn’t doing a very good job of hiding it. Then I called him a bitch and we didn’t talk about it again. My dad though, he used to say, ‘If either of you boys end up being one of those queers, you ain’t my boy no more.’ I was curious when I was a kid but no reason was good enough to leave Sam alone with dad and end up on the streets. Until he left for Stanford. There was Lee, but that didn’t work out. After him, I didn’t try again. Then you came along and flipped my whole world upside down.”
From far off, there was a flash of light. That never happened. That wasn’t supposed to happen. They focused their gaze on the two figures that emerged from the light. One was the Nephilim,
Just as he was actually starting to take in the words from the book on fae lore, he got an incoming video call from Eileen. He picked his phone up immediately and answered the call. He saw Eileen’s beautiful face on the screen and signed
A look passed between the three of them. “Now?” Jack asked. They nodded and braced themselves. He turned toward where the portal to the Apocalypse universe once was and closed his eyes. When he reopened them, they were glowing golden, and a rip in space, much like the one he created before being born, was created. Sam rushed to a large bowl with herbs, cut his hand, and chanted “
