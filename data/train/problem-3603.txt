Up until then his manner had been playful, but he must have seen something in Dean’s expression, because his smile suddenly slipped and he quickly hurried away.
Thankfully, Cas got the message, and after gripping Dean’s thighs and lifting him until he could wind his legs around Cas’s waist, he carried Dean over to the bed. They were still kissing, and Dean had wrapped his arms around Cas’s neck, with one hand tugging at Cas’s hair, so he was damn impressed that Cas navigated his way to the bed without any difficulty.
Cas sighed and stood up, then headed for the French doors, saying, “I’m… I’ll get back to my gardening.”
Draining the rest of the cup, Dean poured himself another coffee and one for Cas, then stepped outside. “What do you think, Cas? Could you grow something in that soil?”
“You’ll tell me if your grace decides to make me the enemy, right?” he asked Cas who just nodded, but at the same time looked like he really wanted out of this conversation. He couldn’t blame him.
He felt bold that night. He didn’t think he could rein it in if he tried. He wanted to be close to Cas. He wanted to tell Cas the thoughts he had in his mind. He wanted to see the way Cas’s face softened when Dean said those things. All he could think about anymore was
Ultimately, he might still be an angel, but it was obvious that these days Cas preferred earth to Heaven and humanity to angels. And thank fuck for that.
“Claire, honey, I know you don’t want to move but I can’t afford to keep us here. You understand that right? Dean is doing us a big favor so that we can save a lot of money.”
Castiel shook his head and sighed. “And I thought it was because you didn’t trust me in battle any more.”
and his own special lyrics involved freckles, for some reason, and by this point Dean would be happy if he never heard the song again. On top of that, Cas was
Closing his eyes and shaking his head, Castiel berated himself for his inappropriate thoughts. He had to stop thinking of Dean that way, otherwise he would only be torturing himself.
The text asked if there had been any sign of the ghost yet, plus an enquiry about how Dean and Castiel were getting on together, and Castiel needed a moment to think before replying. Of course Sam would be pleased to hear that they were more comfortable with each other than they had been for longer than Castiel wanted to think about, but how much would Dean want him to say about that?
It took nearly three minutes for her to finally answer. Castiel knew she expected them to either press for an answer or leave the room without one, but what their little girl hadn’t seemed to grasp yet was that Castiel would wait for her forever if they needed to.
The following morning he was definitely very groggy and poured himself a larger cup of coffee than usual. He hid in the kitchen after waking both Jack and Claire up like they’d asked him to do so that they would both be able to hear Cas’s reaction.
Dean wondered if they would move back once he and Cas had gotten rid of the ghost. For some reason, that thought didn’t sit well with Dean, even though he knew they wouldn’t be living here more than a couple of days.
He grabbed her a Dr. Pepper from his secret stash and used it as a peace offering, hoping since she wasn’t usually allowed to have soda that it might butter her up.
None of what was happening was what Castiel had anticipated, and he instantly lost himself in the feel of Dean as their kiss became almost frantic. Dean nipped at Castiel’s lips and thrust his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, and when Castiel slammed Dean harder against the door, Dean placed his hands on Castiel’s ass and ground their hips together. The sensation of their groins coming into contact set his veins on fire, and he released Dean’s mouth to let out a gasp.
Castiel had seen Dean worried before. When his mom had gotten sick and when his dad had lost himself to grief after her death. Castiel had seen that look in Dean’s eyes, the one that screamed that he just wanted to fix everything and make everyone’s pain and hurt go away. They’d been by Dean’s side the whole time and especially there after, when their best friend turned to alcohol for a while to try and ease the hurt. It was the only time Castiel had truly felt like they’d been able to be there for Dean, to help him when Dean needed them most. If Dean hadn’t allowed their help though, had turned it away, things may have looked so very different.
As if to prove a point, Claire stomped into the kitchen and threw her backpack onto the ground next to the table. She slipped into a chair and put her head down with a dramatic huff.
Dean was giddy like a child and Castiel could barely hold onto the stern face they were trying to portray. “We agreed to four outfits,” they reminded, trying to reign in their ‘dad voice.’
If Dean hated the homophobic sonovabitch already, it was nothing compared to his murderous intentions towards it now. Just as Cas and him were doing what Dean had wanted for so long… but there was no time to think about that now. With a fervent hope that they would pick up where they’d left off once they’d destroyed the ghost, Dean sprang into action, doing what was second nature to him when dealing with the supernatural.
It sounded like his three roommates were in Cas’s room for the moment so Dean tried to quickly heat himself a plate of food, hoping to escape upstairs before anyone spotted him, knowing he probably wasn’t in the best mood to attempt to have a conversation. It didn’t seem to be his lucky day because right as the microwave beeped, Cas came back into the kitchen.
The smile that broke out on Dean’s face was breathtaking, and his cheeks coloured. “Thanks, Cas. I’m, um… glad you like my food. I enjoy cooking for you.”
Mornings, by nature, were objectively terrible. Waking up and knowing one had to leave the warm comfort of their bed was an awful experience.
Cas sighed, and picked up the tin to apparently look at the pattern on the outside. “It seems that William and Ruth were driven apart, just like Jack and Ennis. Not for the same reason, of course, but-” He stopped talking and reached inside the tin. “There’s something stuck to the bottom.”
Cas glanced at Dean then, with a pained expression on his face, then quickly averted his eyes. “One could say
She hated being told what to do so it didn’t come as a shock when she scowled in defiance. “No. You can’t tell me what to do.”
By the time Monday afternoon rolled around and it was time to pick the kids up from school for the first time, Dean was nervous to say the least. He probably checked the clock five hundred times that day, convinced he’d missed pick up. By the time he was in the car with Jack’s car seat strapped in, Dean had half convinced himself that the daycare wasn’t going to have his name on file and arrest him for attempted kidnapping.
Dean could’ve said so much at that moment. He could’ve told Cas just how much Cas had done for him over the years. He could have told his friend all the amazing things they did for everyone in their lives. He could’ve said he was doing all this because Cas was the most important person in Dean’s life but he couldn’t form those words quite yet. Instead he said, “Because I care about you a whole fucking lot.”
Cas had looked disappointed, and Dean thought he might have been about to say more, but at that moment, Sam had come striding into the kitchen, telling them about how he was going to be meeting up with Eileen later. Whatever else Cas might have had on his mind had been lost as they got caught up in Sam’s excitement, and they’d been tiptoeing around the whole subject ever since.
Cas had made sure it was hidden well, and it was right behind Dean’s duffel, which… had a container of salt in it. Pulling out the salt and the box, Dean threw the salt to Cas.
“I’m planning on heading out tomorrow to investigate. You wanna join me?” Sam asked Castiel, but before he could even answer, Dean appeared from wherever he’d been hiding, slammed his hands on the table, and shouted a very forceful “no,” before shooting Sam a warning look.
As they walked through the kitchen, Dean looked like he was about to stop to pour himself a coffee, but Castiel steered him away from the machine and towards the French doors.
“Did you… choose to feel heat?” Dean asked but Cas shook his head. “I may have overestimated my current powers,” he said quietly, and began cutting up his omelette into tiny, painstakingly symmetrical pieces and slowly eating them.
there was no denying that that kiss was hot as fuck. Dean sat stock still and stared straight ahead as he tried to dampen his feelings of arousal. Cas shifted in his seat, and that didn’t help matters at all.
They really needed to start working past their issues and get their friendship back on an even keel, Dean decided. He wanted them to feel comfortable around each other again, and watching a movie together was a step in the right direction, wasn’t it?
By the time Tuesday rolled around Castiel was severely regretting agreeing to the shopping trip but Dean seemed excited. Castiel just managed to bite their tongue, for Dean’s sake. They weren’t going to turn down letting Dean do something nice if it seemed to make Dean excited. Cas knew how much Dean loved to be helpful.
Of course, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other when they woke in the morning, and Dean had straddled Cas’s lap and ridden him until they made a mess of each other and the bed sheets.
“Yes. In fact, I think you should teach me how to cook.” Cas took Dean’s hand and led him through to the kitchen.
“Claire. Your dad just told you to go to your room. Go.” Dean’s voice shocked all three of them. The storm behind Claire’s eyes disintegrated instantly, turned to shock by the harshness in Dean’s voice. She’d never heard Dean angry in her life, especially not in a way that was directed towards her. Tears flooded her eyes immediately and they could hear her sobbing as she ran to her room and slammed her door.
They’d tried to make it work, and for almost 3 years they thought it would but then their savings started to deplete as they tried to make the monthly payments. Then they made the gut wrenching decision to take from their retirement but even that still wasn’t enough. Their home at that point was only 10 years into it’s 30 year loan–a loan on a house Castiel thought would be paid by both their three-figure salary and Kelly’s.
Dean was standing in the kitchen, cup of coffee in his hand as he looked out at the view, just as he’d imagined the previous day. It had been a strange night, what with the still lingering tension between Cas and him, which was only exacerbated by them having to share a bed.
Cas still hated mornings and they still made a mess and had to spend way too long picking up after themself, but they couldn’t deny that they were happier now than they had been in a long time. They were living with their best friend, their kids were doing well in school, and Castiel could finally, truly, feel at ease.
Almost without realising he was doing it, Castiel began pulling his hand away from Dean’s and taking a step back. He would just slip away, unnoticed, and give Dean the excuse he needed to ‘make a move’ on Mimi.
Dean had never heard Cas swear before, and it felt very much like he was having a pop at Dean. But what for, he had no idea.
Dean stood there awkwardly, his hand lingering on Cas’s shoulder, an uneasy silence settling between them.
Cas’s eyes were glazed over, but he apparently had enough presence of mind to take Dean’s cock in his own hand and copy his movements.
“I am,” they said just as softly. It seemed to be the right thing to say because Dean’s eyes lit up. He was still staring at Cas and it felt like electricity was surging through where their bodies were touching: their knees under the table, Dean’s arm around Cas’s shoulder, the tips of Cas’s fingers brushing up against Dean’s thigh.
Bob laughed loudly, and prodded Castiel in the chest with his finger. “I like you, Cas. You’re funny.”
“Looks like we’ll get a great cup of coffee in the morning.” Dean gestured to the coffee machine, then at the French doors that led from the kitchen out to the back garden. “And the view’s not bad, either.”
Dean nodded, and focused on a spot on the floor as he waited for the inevitable speech about how much Cas liked him like a brother.
Understanding finally dawned on Cas’s face, and he shook his head sadly. “Do you mean Ruth was really Richard? So it seems he and William
The feelings Dean had for Cas had been simmering under his skin for so long, he couldn’t remember a time when they weren’t there. But he’d convinced himself that Cas could never feel the same, so when things came to a head in that storage room - when Cas said all that stuff about how Dean was actually fuelled by love, and that knowing him had made Cas care about the world before sacrificing himself to save Dean’s life - Dean’s feelings became even more confused.
“You okay, Cas? Sorry if I was ignoring you, babe; you know I can’t resist a bit of local gossip.” He added a wink for authenticity, and yet again Castiel was filled with regret at how cruel it was that he was getting to experience what it would be like to be with Dean, when none of it was real.
He was almost too angry to come back downstairs but by that point he was ravenous and didn’t have many other options.
Cas nodded. They seemed hesitantly excited, likely not wanting to get their hopes up. “They asked me to come in for a second one next week.”
"You need to wear something different," Dean added. "Mimi's already seen you in those clothes twice, and she's gonna think you're a weirdo if you turn up wearing them again."
The kitchen was a mess again from what appeared to be Cas’s attempt at spaghetti and garlic bread. Backpacks were strewn over the island and Dean could see Claire in the living room with a pile of toys. He didn’t see Jack right away but as he walked further into the house he noticed the four-year-old at his desk, playing with some monster trucks, crashing into Dean’s stuff.
They followed Mimi into the house, where she sat them down and insisted on giving them each a glass of lemonade and a slice of apple pie.
“It’s encouraging to see that that attitude is less prevalent than it used to be. Although, sometimes I see so much hatred in the world - even towards bees - and it’s deeply distressing.”
Castiel had only ever received one other gift in his very long life, and that had been from Dean too. It was a mixtape, and Castiel kept it safely tucked in the inside pocket of his trench coat. That had been a nice surprise, but this felt much more personal. The songs on the mixtape were Dean’s favourites, but this mug was about something special to Castiel.
“Wow, you really don’t like taking no for an answer, do you?” Dean moved closer to Bob, and his voice dropped to a growl. “You know what I would do if I was you? I’d fuck off, right now.”
Dean took in a shaky breath, and nodded. “You’re right, and this feels like a new start. One where we actually talk about shit… and have lots of sex.”
“Yes. Yes, I do. It’s the most thoughtful thing…” Castiel was going to say it was the most thoughtful thing Dean had ever done for him, but he thought better of it. “I only want to drink coffee from this mug from now on.”
Once the introductions were over, Rebecca explained with a fond eye roll that Brian was in charge of the food, before they each had a bottle of beer handed to them.
It was hard to give their daughter time when she had her sights set on hurting her brother’s feelings at every chance she got lately.
Dean’s face fell as he explained, “We can’t just wait around doing nothing, can we? Sam said the hunters who came here never saw the ghost, and maybe that was because it knew they weren’t a couple. If we do things that make it look like we’re gonna be staying, hopefully it’ll show itself.”
“I don’t need protect-” Castiel started, before deciding to distract Bob by asking about him instead. “So, what about you and John? How long have you two been together?”
is that what they thought of him? That he would get mad at them for simply living in their own home?
He tried to sit up, but it seemed to be a fruitless exercise. He groaned, then muttered under his breath, “Fuck.”
He wasn’t sure if it was necessarily the best idea to reward Claire on a day she technically got in trouble for yelling at her teacher but he figured since it was for a good reason it could slide.
The pain was quickly becoming unbearable, and Dean couldn’t focus, but suddenly it was gone as Cas stopped pouring the salt long enough to pick up the iron bar again and hit William in the side of the head.
“I’m so sorry. I should’ve locked the door or something, I just didn’t even think he might come in. I feel like an idiot–”
It had been the house Castiel thought they’d stay in for a while, at least until the kids were grown and they’d need to downsize. Getting laid off made sure that dream hadn’t stuck.
The answer was four. Four more rounds of sex before Sammy arrived. They started with blow jobs in bed after the call ended, then later after they’d eaten, they’d jerked each other off in the shower. Dean had thought that might be it for the day, but then Cas had sneaked up behind him when he was washing the dishes, and slipped his hand into Dean’s pajama pants and stroked him until he’d come, shaking and trembling while Cas sucked a mark into the back of his neck. Dean had returned the favour - once his legs were no longer made of jelly - and they’d gone to bed exhausted but happy.
Castiel debated just brushing it off and saying they were fine. It’d be easy to just sweep yet another thing under the rug and allow it to bottle up inside themself. They already had so many problems and Dean was already helping with so many of them it didn’t seem fair to continue to dump all of it out, knowing how Dean always felt the need to help. But Castiel felt like they were barely hanging on and the thought of just unloading all of it so that
“Here, eat,” he said and Cas thanked him with a nod and grabbed a fork on his way to the table. Dean followed him a few minutes later with two freshly brewed mugs of coffee, since coffee and booze were the only two things in existence Cas had never had much of a problem with drinking, and he put one of the mugs, a blue one saying “Best Dad”, in front of him. Jack had given each of them a “Best Dad” mug in different colors and although Dean was pretty sure that Sam was the only one really deserving the title, there was no point in denying the tears in Dean’s eyes when Jack had given him his mug, because although he was pretty sure he was doing a shit job of being a father sometimes, he loved the boy. Cas however, had hugged Jack for what had seemed like forever and when he had finally pulled away the smile on his lips had been the happiest Dean had ever seen the guy. He told himself that the reason he sometimes thought back to this smile was because he liked seeing his best friend happy. Because that’s all there was, right?
Castiel had heard of him and his scary stories, and he could understand why Dean would make that kind of connection to this house. He could imagine that it might look quite creepy at night, but in the bright sunshine of early afternoon it looked nothing less than welcoming. He nodded. “I like this house. It’s most appealing.”
Looking away, Dean suddenly found his hands fascinating, and he picked at the spots of paint that were spattered over them.
“No. No I haven’t seen it,” Castiel struggled to explain, their voice completely even. “I just already knew.”
“Nice work, guys. How did you get it to show up? No, wait… tell me the story when you get back to the bunker.” Sam sounded excited for their return, and Castiel looked sadly at Dean.
“I’m sorry I don’t have anything better,” he expressed sincerely. He wished Castiel felt comfortable enough to wear some of their sweaters to work but Dean was well aware how many shitty people there were. If Cas wasn’t up for dealing with them, Dean wouldn’t push the matter, no matter how nice he thought Cas looked in a baggy sweater.
Considering he’d spent the night sitting in a chair, Castiel had never been more grateful for the fact that he didn’t need sleep. He looked over at Dean, who was still asleep on the sofa, then quietly stood up and went through to the kitchen.
He had no idea what was on Cas’s mind, but there was a question Dean desperately needed the answer to. Telling himself that he would deal with whatever Cas said, he finally worked up the courage to speak.
“How long does this usually take?” Sam asked. “Dean, you should probably leave the bunker to be on the safe side. I don’t want either of you to spontaneously combust.”
Once the sexual relationship began between Ennis and Jack, Dean’s discomfort became acute. He couldn’t even look at Cas, who it seemed was totally unbothered by the passion on the screen.
“My teacher’s a bitch,” she spat out, fury rolling off of her. He’d never heard her speak that way. He didn’t think Cas or Kelly even swore in front of the kids so he knew something bad happened for Claire to risk saying such a thing in front of him.
He headed in the direction of a young couple Castiel remembered being introduced as Brittany and Matt, and by the time Castiel had gathered himself enough to join them, the three of them were already engaged in conversation.
Cas decided a whole night's worth of sleep was too long to go without kissing Dean and shifted forward enough until their lips were once again pressed together, sinking into Dean’s arms like puddy. They knew they didn’t have time for more than just a kiss but with the way their hands roamed as they kissed was their silent promise to come back to this that night.
“What if I need to use the toilet later? I don’t want to go through the process of having bowel movements ever again.” When Cas looked up, his eyes were so full of horror that Dean had to break out in laughter.
“What is it with you and toilets?” he asked but Cas closed his eyes and sighed, as if to brace himself. Dean stopped, since he definitely hadn’t forgotten the fact that Cas’ grace was unstable right now and he very much did not want to get on the angel’s hit list by annoying him too much, so he awkwardly ran a hand through his hair and focused his attention on the fridge instead.
Dean came to a decision then, and he put the beef back in the fridge. "Change of plan. We're going to the garden center now, and later while you're planting your flowers, I'll make the burgers."
pretty real. Did you mean it?” Dean stared up at Cas, feeling like he was laying his heart on the line and hoping it didn’t get broken.
Once they’d made sure Chuck was no longer a threat, and Jack became the new God then promptly disappeared after a quick goodbye, Dean was heartbroken all over again. He couldn’t say anything to Sam because he was also grieving, over Jack and Eileen… and actually, probably Cas as well.
“I think maybe it would be okay if you were my step-dad,” she announced, like it was just a casual thing to say to someone. Dean had to laugh.
“I think we both know that hurt their feelings a lot but that doesn’t mean you can’t make it right.”
Dean and Cas had gotten to know all their neighbors better since then, and they were mostly pretty great. Except Bob, because Dean still had a problem with him… He’d really brought out Dean’s jealous side, and Dean didn’t like it. Thankfully - and wisely - Bob hadn’t repeated his offer to Cas, so it was all good.
"Here." Dean handed the clothes over, as Cas took them with extreme reluctance and stared at them like they might bite him.
“No, thank you. I’ll stick with coffee.” Cas had an unmistakable note of disappointment in his voice, but at that moment Dean couldn’t find it in him to care. It was past midday, after all, and he needed to rid his mind of the last couple of hours, even if it was just temporarily.
To say Dean had been worried about his best friend for the better part of five years would be an understatement. Watching one of the most important people in his life get knocked down over and over yet being unable to help in any vital way was tough for Dean. Of course, his worry was nothing compared to Castiel’s stress. Dean had tried to offer help in any way he could but he understood that Castiel didn’t want to fall back on others if at all possible. So when they were able to score the Gas-N-Sip job, Dean had been hopeful it was a temporary stepping stone to getting his friend back on their feet.
They knew she was right but they were at the very edge of their capacity to hold in their emotions and decided to change the subject before completely breaking down into sobs.
The burst of different colours really brightened up the garden, and Dean could see that Cas had put a lot of thought into how he’d arranged the plants.
“I guess you’re right,” Cas sighed. They both knew it was true. Claire probably would have kept her mouth shut, too scared to upset Cas and then she would’ve likely never had the chance to move to a new classroom. It worked out for the best this way.
Dean sat down on the edge of the bed and wondered if he should go back to sleep; it was still barely morning, after all. But no, he was going to clean the house - after a quick shower - starting with the bucket of water he left in the attic yesterday. He would prove to Cas that he wasn’t just a screw up.
Dean seemed almost eager to pack the kid’s lunches and make them breakfast in the morning to take that responsibility off Cas’s hands and Castiel couldn’t find a reason to argue it. Cas agreed to take on dishes since Dean seemed to hate touching wet food, and they both agreed that Saturday mornings would be a day to do the really boring stuff like dusting and vacuuming.
Big emotions were allowed to be had, so long as Claire and Jack understood they must eventually verbalize why they felt them and what they could do to work through them. Discussion was important to Castiel and Kelly, and though it earned them much disapproval from all the other ‘perfect parents’ in the world, it worked for their family.
Walking into the apartment felt like a fever dream. For the first time in their life, Castiel was thankful the kids were with their mother. This moment wasn’t one Castiel wanted their children to see them in. Not as they slipped to the kitchen floor and tucked their head to their knees, feeling the whole weight of the world crushing all of their stability.
Their new shirts were itchier than the shirts they’d been wearing for the past few years but these ones now had the added factor of reminding Castiel of Dean everytime they got dressed for work.
“‘K, Sammy. I’m gonna grab forty winks now.” Dean pressed the end call button, and placed his phone on the table, then closed his eyes for a little nap.
But anyway, right at this moment, he was struck by the unfairness of a society that didn’t accept the love between Ennis and Jack, and it was hard for him to hold back the tears that were prickling at the back of his eyes.
Castiel should’ve known calling their best friend with a heavy, emotive tone in their voice would automatically set off Dean’s protective instincts. Already Castiel felt more at ease knowing Dean was going to be able to help them come up with a plan.
With just a touch of guilt at having ignored their children the entire car ride over, Castiel turned their attention fully to the kids, ensuring they were out of the car and had their school bags before reaching for their hands and walking them through the garage to the elevator.
Dean was glad to have this time back. Even if he didn’t know how long it would last for him. He tried to not let himself hope that their stay would be permanent. He knew it was wishful thinking. Why would Castiel want to forever live here with Dean when they were well into their thirties and Castiel had two kids to take care of? Who wants to be roommates with their best friend at this age?
Dean wanted to scream for Cas’s sake. He wanted to run down to whatever office building it was and curse at them for ruining what should have been a great morning. He wanted to scream at them for being idiots and not taking Cas for this position. He wanted to do anything he could to make this better for his best friend but he knew all he could do right now is be there for them.
“Hell yeah, I am,” Dean encouraged him, grabbing a pillow and placing it under his hips for a better angle.
So after spilling the slushy syrup all over their front, cleaning it up, repairing the machine, getting at least five more ‘thank you, sirs’ from the teenager, clocking out one hour past the end of their shift, and their car struggling to start in the parking lot, Castiel was done with the day.
“Why would you do that if we’re only going to be here a few days? We’re just supposed to be catching the ghost, nothing more.”
“I know I already apologised, but I really am sorry. I was a bad friend throwing you out like that, with nothing. I don’t know why you forgave me. I-”
Dean was still sad for Cas knowing that his friend hated not being able to have evenings with the kids but Dean tried to make Cas feel better about it in any way Dean could. The two of them made an effort to have lunch together every day, pulling Dean away from his work and Cas away from their job applications for at least an hour each day. It was the only true time the two got to spend together and Dean knew he wouldn’t trade it for anything. It was his time to check in with his friend or to just talk about anything and everything that came to their minds like they tended to do. Dean usually avoided asking Cas about job interviews since his friend had given him the most withering glare the last time Dean brought it up, but Cas still did keep Dean updated about the different places they were applying to. But mostly the two of them talked about the kids, because Claire and Jack were definitely their most favorite people.
Sam nodded his head before addressing Dean calmly, but with a determination in his voice. "Dean, if you're ready to put your feet up, good for you. I agree that you've earned it, but me… I'm not ready for that yet. And well, you already know Cas isn’t.”
“No! I’m not a baby!” Jack yelled, stomping his feet. A headache was forming at Cas’s temples. Just two more nights, they told themself.
There were more books, t-shirts, plushies, jewellery… but Dean had his sights on a couple of other things. He picked up a pair of socks and a blanket, both decorated with bees, and yeah… he knew Cas didn’t need to keep warm, but Dean felt he should have them anyway.
When he was able to see through the numbing grief that allowed him to function only if he didn’t think too hard about what he’d just lost, and start processing the sacrifice Cas had made for him, Dean’s overriding emotion was shock. He was shocked at the very thought that Cas might love him, but he’d obviously meant brotherly love, hadn’t he? There was no way Cas could love Dean romantically, was there? Of course not, because Cas was an angel of the lord, and even though Chuck had even gone so far as to say that Cas was different, angels just didn’t experience feelings the same way as humans. He probably wasn’t even capable of
With Dean, things were very different. After the utter failure of a conversation about Castiel’s sacrifice - and what he’d said moments before - he never actually asked how Castiel was, but he would often catch Dean peering at him through narrowed eyes, as if he was trying to gauge him.
Sam and Eileen still lived in the bunker, but they’d also retired from hunting, and were now running a seriously impressive hunter network. Kind of like the British Men of Letters, but one hell of a lot less douchey. When they weren’t answering phone calls, or researching in the bunker’s library, they were frequent visitors of Dean, Cas and little Lizzo. (Yes, Cas had insisted on naming the cat Lizzo, and because Dean had told him that naming her was his job, he had to live with it. He drew the line at calling her name outside the house though; he did have some limits.)
Dean could have sworn that Cas’s pupils were dilated, and he was pretty sure he saw that gaze shift to his lips for a fraction of a second. That couldn’t have been what Dean was imagining though, could it? Cas was an angel of the lord, and even if he was currently shopping in the flower section of a garden center, he was still a heavenly warrior. You could be a warrior and also like flowers, couldn’t you?
What did his friend see when they looked in the mirror? He wanted to ask, and he almost did, but he didn’t think he wanted to hear the answer. If he knew Cas, which he was pretty certain he did, Dean was sure all Cas saw when they looked at themself in the mirror was disappointment. Dean didn’t think Cas saw their eyes the same way Dean did: the same shade of blue the sky turned after a rainy morning; Cas didn’t see the lines around said eyes the say way Dean did: years of memories laughing by each other’s side, smiling as Claire and Jack discovered all the wonders around them; Cas didn’t see their lips the same way Dean did: late nights talking on the old couch Dean’s parents had in this very room, sharing secrets of their hopes for their future, the same lips that uttered soothing words to their loved ones when times got too tough. Cas would never see themself the way Dean did, Dean knew, so instead of asking a question he didn’t want to hear the answer to, he simply said, “I think you’re beautiful.”
“Yeah!” Jack announced. The conversation with the four year old a few days ago had gone surprisingly well with the kid announcing that he was excited to get to have brand new friends, even though he’d miss his teachers. Claire had not been as excited.
“It’s only temporary,” Dean promised. He was about to semi-jokingly suggest Cas quit and Dean be his sugar-mama until Cas found a new job but he knew his friend’s pride wouldn’t like that suggestion.
As they ate, Dean tried not to think too hard about the upcoming movie. Even though he always denied it, he did occasionally watch romantic movies, but only if he was on his own, especially if it had a gay couple as the main focus.
“Nah, we’ll just stare at each other longingly if we do that, and you’ll all get caught in the crossfire.” There was still humor in Dean’s voice, but there was something else too. Something Castiel couldn’t put his finger on, but it was all exceedingly puzzling.
Jack hesitated for a little bit, not quite looking up at Dean with his green-gold eyes, before shrugging his shoulders once more. “I dunno.”
Sam thought it would probably take them a few days to work the case, so he spent the following day on his laptop, using his finest computer skills - probably learned from Charlie - and by the end of the day, Dean and Cas were the proud owners of the house in question. Dean didn’t ask about the financial side of it, and obviously they weren’t going to keep the house, but for the time being it was theirs.
But Dean had been the one to ask and Castiel was terrified of what was to come when they returned home.
“So, what does it taste like?” Dean asked after a while. Cas seemed to be the slowest eater on the planet, but something about the way he pulled each piece off the fork with his teeth, about how sometimes he would inspect a piece with his tongue made Dean look away, and so he read the folded menu of some pizza place they sometimes ordered food from at least four times until he had the courage to look up again.
“Good morning,” Dean said, rolling onto his side and tangling his legs with Cas’s. It had only been a few months but being with Dean was more than Castiel ever imagined it could be. Learning that Dean’s feelings had been there as long as Castiel’s had been a shock but it was something they both chose not to dwell on. No matter what their lives could have looked like if they had known how each other felt didn’t matter since the life they had now together was beautiful.
Conversation was still swirling through the table but for a brief moment neither Cas or Dean were talking to anyone. Both of them seemed to realize it and turned to look at each other and share a little laugh.
Castiel couldn’t help the little laugh that burst out of him. He’d become too used to barely interacting with Dean, and he suddenly realised how much he’d missed this easy banter.
Castiel half-turned, to see Dean running his hand lovingly over the banister. He was right; the patterns on the banisters were just as pleasing to the eye as those in the bunker, but the stairs themselves were wooden, as opposed to the metal ones they were so used to.
“You up for watching a movie?” Dean asked suddenly and hesitantly, while avoiding making eye contact with Castiel. There was still a fair amount of food on his plate, which he was prodding at with his fork, and Castiel felt a slight pang of guilt that his unhappy mood might have affected Dean’s appetite.
“I do… so much. I hope he’s okay.” Cas’s voice was full of emotion, and Dean had decided it might be best if he didn’t intrude.
With Jack already on his tangent about elephants and how awesome they were, Dean made sure to nod along to what the kid said and ask questions when appropriate but he couldn’t help but notice how angrily Claire stared out the window, her jaw clenched tightly as the houses in the neighborhood passed by.
Actually, now he thought about it, Castiel had noticed on numerous occasions that Dean had a fascination with all things related to that era and cowboys in particular. Maybe this information could be useful in the future.
“I… yes. I would like that.” Castiel knew he was letting his guard down by revealing to Dean that he wanted to eat, but for some reason he wasn’t as worried as he had been even a few hours ago.
Once they’d found a place to stay and were settled in their room, Dean cracked open a couple of beers while Sam fired up his laptop.
As Dean watched him go, his trench coat practically billowing out behind him as he moved with a purpose, he congratulated himself on coming up with the garden center story. Maybe not all of the ideas he had under pressure were terrible.
“So, I’ll make you a veggie omelette, since you won’t be able to taste it anyway, but if you want, we can stock up on stuff you like later,” Dean said and cracked two eggs into a bowl.
Castiel hovered uncertainly at the bottom, until Dean reached the top and disappeared into the bathroom. He went back into the kitchen and poured Dean a coffee, then waited for Dean to reappear.
It turned out that the only thing Dean disliked more than the idea of him and Cas pretending to be a couple was the idea of
It had never crossed their mind for a moment that Dean would be anything less than welcoming and loving towards them all. Which Dean had been at the start until Castiel started messing up more frequently.
Dean nodded. “When you slammed me up against the front door? Instant boner.” He swallowed thickly, and a tremor ran through him at the memory.
All the panic from their talk with Rich finally washed away. They had somewhere to go. Somewhere stable and safe and where Castiel wouldn’t have to tank their credit score even further to put a down payment.
He rarely saw Cas in anything but his full ‘tax accountant’ get up, and it was a sight to behold. Cas’s arms were nicely tanned, and as he dug the soil and added the mulch, Dean could see the ripple of muscles under his skin.
“Yeah.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “I kinda feel bad for those guys who did all that work on the house then had to leave. Man, that really sucks.”
“Oh, I think she just got confused because you live with me,” he tried to rationalize. “She must’ve assumed that meant I was married to your mom or your dad.” He tried to sound casual as he said it but he wasn’t sure he did a great job. The implication that people assumed he was probably married to Cas since they lived together and Dean helped take care of the kids… did something to him.
It felt almost blasphemous for Cas to be using the fact that he was an angel for something so filthy, but
How did he not stop to consider that it was rude to keep walking into Cas’s bedroom every morning, even if prior to last week it had been Dean’s office?
“I disagree,” Castiel insisted as he let go of Dean and picked the cat up once more. “I think you love chick flick moments.”
The offer was tempting, but Castiel couldn’t leave. He’d promised to help in their mission to discover any additional information about their ghost, so to use an expression of Dean’s, he’d just have to ‘suck it up’. It would probably help if he was able to get a little distance from Dean for a while, but while Dean was being uncharacteristically thoughtful and attentive towards him, that seemed impossible.
“Not at first. Initially, I kissed you because I’d had enough. Every time I dared to hope that you returned my feelings for you, those hopes were crushed, and I just couldn’t stand being here with you any longer. Pretending… knowing you didn’t feel the same. So I decided the solution was to kiss you, catch the ghost, go back to the bunker, and continue ignoring how much I love you.”
He held the box out to show him, and waited for Cas to join him in the kitchen. The moment he was inside, Dean said excitedly, “It was under the floor in the attic. It’s full of letters, but I haven’t read any of ‘em yet; I wanted to show you first.”
Dean knew that was ridiculous, so before he lost his mind completely he tore himself away, and went into the living room. Turning on the TV and plopping himself down on the sofa, he tried to distract himself from thoughts of Cas's hands and bare arms by searching for something to watch.
Cas’s concern was adorable, and Dean looked him in the eyes before replying. “Good doesn’t come close. It was fucking awesome.”
“I love you to the moon,” she said as she pulled him into a hug, the familiar words they’d always shared.
Dean was surprised when Castiel entered the garage but he knew better than to say anything as his friend took the time to wake up. Castiel, for all their amazing qualities, was unbearable in the mornings.
It was crazy to think where Castiel had been just under a year ago, thinking that there was no way their life could look up. Cas had felt alone and scared and overwhelmed by everything that had come raining down on them but those worries were now long in the past. All because Dean had offered his hand and Castiel had been brave enough to take it.
This was the first real case they’d had since Cas’s return, so Dean hadn’t realised that Cas’s grace had been continuing to fade. But now that he’d seen it, he had to make sure that Cas wasn’t put in any more danger. He was not going to lose him again… not on his watch. By the time they arrived back, Dean had made a decision; he was going to do everything he could to pull back from the hunting life… and do his damndest to make sure Sam and Cas did too. They’d all earned that much, hadn’t they?
“You saw it?” Jack curiously asked and Dean had to stifle a startled noise behind his fist. He was simultaneously embarrassed but finding this hilarious at the same time. How did parents do it?
And now needing to lean on their best friend to help pull them out of this? It was hard to not feel embarrassed. Logically, Castiel knew if the situations were reversed and they had the means to help Dean out of a sticky situation, they wouldn’t hesitate for a moment. But Castiel was an adult, fully grown, with two children they needed to take care of. If they couldn’t provide the single basic necessity of having a home for their kids, then what kind of parent were they? What would this mean for their future with their kids?
Castiel got to his feet, and immediately missed the little warm body he’d been holding. If it wasn’t for Dean and his dislike of cats, he might have been able to keep her. Maybe even bring her back to the bunker. There was a small part of him that knew he shouldn’t blame Dean - he hadn’t even given him a chance to say no, after all - but he chose to ignore that. He was certain the end result would have been the same, regardless, and he would still have been annoyed with Dean anyway.
What the hell was Cas doing? They couldn’t just say these things and not have Dean’s stupid heart act up. It was ridiculous how Cas could make him feel like a lovesick teenager again with just a few words but he wasn’t going to deny that he kind of liked it. He nugged Cas with his elbow and smiled. “I think you’ve aged beautifully as well.”
“Yeah, some people just fucking suck.” Dean tried not to think too much about his dad, and how he might have reacted if he’d known about Dean’s attraction to a man - or more accurately, an angel who presented as a man - because he was certain that his dad wouldn’t have approved. In fact, he thought it was pretty damn likely that John would have tried to put a stop to it.
“Awww, would you look at you two,” Brittany said, before nudging Matt in the side and giggling. “Relationship goals.”
Dean resolved there and then that he was going to make sure that Cas knew how important he was to the Winchesters, starting with accepting his choice of movie.
As the silence stretched on, Dean swore he could feel something changing in the air between them. Kind of like the opposite of how the room felt when William had been there; instead of turning colder it seemed to be heating up.
Dean wanted to grab the kid and hold him tight. He felt so bad for being such an idiot. “I’m sorry, buddy. I didn’t know you were awake.”
He rubbed circles in Cas’s back, hoping to offer some comfort. “There’s going to be more interviews,” he promised.
hungry, but he had to distance himself from Dean for his own sake. All he could do now was hope that the ghost would show itself soon, and they could wrap things up and get back to the bunker. It would be much easier to spend less time around Dean once they were back there.
It felt so right. Kelly had been thrilled by the news that Cas and Dean had finally gotten together and the three of them, if Castiel said so themself, were doing a phenomenal job in co-parenting. It helped that Dean had always been amazing with the kids and had always loved them like his own.
Dean gave Castiel’s shoulder a small squeeze, then dropped his hand. Things were still strange between them, but they were putting on a show for the ghost’s benefit, and with any luck the case would be solved quickly.
The pain was excruciating, but it stopped as Cas snatched the bar out of his hand and knocked the ghost fuck-knew-where.
All the torture, all the mistreatment at the hands of other angels… it all paled into insignificance compared to the pain of leaving the being he cared for most in the entire universe. And of course, in the end, he had been unable to stay away for too long, and had returned even though he knew he shouldn’t. But then, to his everlasting astonishment, Dean had apologised. It was heartfelt - and yes, in the form of a prayer - but it was sincere, and things had been better between them, until Castiel had professed his love. It was too late to take that back now though, so he would just have to deal with the consequences.
He removed his hand from Dean’s mouth and was met with an expression of remorse. “Well, when you put it like that…”
“Yeah it did, even though Sammy totally stole our thunder.” Dean chuckled as his stomach rumbled. “You wanna help me make dinner?”
Cas’s expression was stunned, and perhaps worried, but they nodded. “I think that’d be good,” they agreed.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed. Noticing that they’d all finished eating, he realised it was the perfect time to show Sam and Eileen around before the conversation got any sadder. “So… guided tour?”
Dean thought, making a mental resolve to encourage Cas to choose next time. “Tell you what, I’ll pick the movie tonight, and tomorrow it’s your turn. Sound good?”
“Look, Cas. I know you keep saying that I-” Dean started, but was interrupted by his phone ringing. Pulling it out of his pocket, he could see it was Sam.
It occurred to Castiel to just ask Dean, but he had a feeling it would make things awkward between them again. In the end, he decided on making it as brief and positive as possible.
They ate lunch at the kitchen island and talked about a few of the projects Dean was working on. Once they’d cleaned up and Dean tidied up the kitchen to his liking, they went to work on moving Dean’s desk and office into the corner of the living room. He’d considered moving it up into his room but he had no desire to carry a solid oak desk up the stairs. All that mattered was that it was out of Cas’s way and Dean would no longer be the asshole who woke them up at dawn.
Claire appeared to still be in her room so Castiel tasked Jack with coaxing her out of it while they folded and stacked Jack’s pillows and blankets.
“And we’re done,” Dean blurted out as he put the last pancake on the stack, relieved as Cas let go of him in order to set the table.
Dean sipped his coffee as he watched his three housemates shuffling through the kitchen without so much as a glance in his direction. He watched as the kids set their plates in the sink, grabbed their lunchboxes, and shoved them unceremoniously into their backpacks. He watched as Cas came hurriedly in from the hallway with their coats, helping them put them on since it was getting pretty chilly in the mornings. Dean watched as they all formed a cluster and moved towards the door, shouting over their shoulders ‘Bye Dean!’ and ‘have a good day!’
“I don’t want to leave,” Castiel confessed easily because it was true. It warmed their heart to see Dean sigh in relief, like Dean had truly believed Cas was ready to pack the kids up and take them away.
Just then Dean heard Cas come through the front door, and he quickly opened the fridge and searched for the ground beef. He was just taking the packet out when he heard Cas’s voice behind him.
Castiel frowned and shook his head. “How could healing you be a waste? You’re the most important person in the world.” Dean looked like he was about to argue, so Castiel placed his hand over Dean’s mouth, before continuing,
It took a minute or two of manoeuvring to get both of them and the roses in the frame, but finally Dean was satisfied and took a series of photographs.
“Nah, you’re right.” Dean moved closer to Cas, and lowered his voice. “Wonder when this ghost is gonna show itself.”
“She says you want to make us go to a new house but because you and daddy are best friends you’re not allowed to. Because it’s not best friend rules.”
He lifted the lid again, then carefully removed one of the letters, opened it, and began to read. Cas looked at him expectantly, obviously waiting for him to read it out loud, but nope… that wasn’t happening.
He could always count on his best friend to make simple situations far more complicated than they had any reason to be but Dean knew Cas was a worrier. They hated not being able to solve their own problems and felt overwhelmed at the idea of needing to lean on others. Especially with the constant changes happening in their life, Dean wasn’t surprised that Cas thought they needed to bear all the burden.
“Very funny, Dean,” he said, before taking in their surroundings. There were three rooms on this floor, and a smaller staircase, presumably leading to the room inside the dome.
“I was in the Empty, but something pulled me out and flung me back to Earth. Back here.” He’d gestured around at the bunker. “This time I didn’t have to annoy any ancient cosmic beings.”
"Oh, you have no idea," Dean replied with a wink, before his face coloured the same way it had when Mimi told them they were adorable. “I should, um… get the burgers ready,” he added then, as he rushed into the house, leaving Castiel standing outside wondering what the sudden rush was for. After all, it was still only one pm, and Dean generally didn’t eat until seven or eight in the evening.
“Your teacher wrote this?” Dean asked in disbelief, feeling himself grow angry by the red marks. Claire was still glaring at the paper when she nodded.
The staircase was short and narrow, and dark at the top, and Castiel had a sense of foreboding, which practically vanished as he reached the last step. The room was completely empty, and even though it was quite dark under the dome, it still didn’t feel like there was any lurking danger.
“Thank you, Mimi. It was nice to meet you.” Cas’s deep voice seemed to startle her, and she flushed before going back to her car.
Cas seemed to realise that Dean was close, because he pulled off Dean’s cock and removed his fingers from Dean’s ass. “I think you’re ready,” he said, popping the bottle open again and pouring out some more lube, then coating his dick with it.
Castiel looked around at the groups of people gathered in the garden, chatting and drinking. “No, not yet.”
“He seemed happy when he left us, and I believe it was him who brought you and Eileen back. I just wish I could talk about him with Dean too, but their relationship was complicated, and Dean isn’t exactly good at discussing stuff when it comes to emotions, is he?”
Cas groaned, but he got off the bed and followed Dean to the bathroom, waiting tiredly as the water heated up. Dean thought tired Cas was cute as fuck, but he didn’t say so. Instead, he gently coaxed Cas under the spray, which was where they stayed, washing each other and making out, until the water turned cold.
It was a few minutes before he heard Dean’s footsteps on the stairs, then watched him walk a little unsteadily into the kitchen. Castiel held out the coffee to him, which he accepted gratefully before taking a long sip.
“I got you a bit of everything,” Dean declared, as Castiel took one of the plates from him. Stepping closer, he murmured in Castiel’s ear, “You don’t have to eat it all. I’ll finish anything you don’t want.”
Castiel had never been the type of person to beg. Growing up, things had always seemed to work out in Castiel’s favor. Childhood had been easy, education and academics as well, and friends and family had been both emotionally and financially supportive of Castiel’s choices to further education. Meeting Kelly, getting married, having children… all of it had just fallen into place. Perhaps Castiel had taken that privilege for granted, in fact, they knew it had been taken for granted. Not once in life had Castiel thought things wouldn’t fall into place. It was probably the most naive way to have grown up, and now it meant that Castiel lacked the skills to understand and process the series of events that had been going wrong for Castiel and their family.
Each and every day they got to witness the way Dean fit so perfectly into Cas and the kids’ life, the way that even Claire was warming up to their new living arrangement, gave Castiel back every ounce of energy their awful job sucked out from them.
By the time they arrived at the barbecue, Castiel was in a state of apprehension. He was much better in social situations these days than he had been when he first started spending time on Earth, but everything felt so raw regarding Dean, he didn’t know what to expect or how he should react.
But things were wrong and it was easier to be a mess than it was to try and keep their head above water sometimes.
Castiel was thankful Dean didn’t press for more but they weren’t entirely surprised their friend didn’t since talking about feelings wasn’t really Dean’s thing.
Cas’s voice was low, hurt even, but Dean didn’t have it in him to try and assuage those feelings at the moment. He was hungry and tired and frustrated and just wanted to be done with the day. He left the kitchen and took his plate of food up to his room. He texted his brother as he finished up, itching to get out of the house and was glad when Sam agreed to meet him at the Roadhouse in fifteen minutes. Dean didn’t even bother announcing that he was going out. He wasn’t certain Cas would’ve even cared anyway.
“Oh yeah, Sammy told me about that. Colony collapse… most likely caused by pesticides… we’ve gotta plant more flowers.” For once Dean seemed to be completely serious, and Castiel was surprised, to say the least.
it’s been occupied through the years by straight couples and families, who’ve lived there quite happily without any sign of the ghost. But one… their son brought home a guy one night and he was killed. And there was another death sixteen years ago, involving a gay couple. Each time, one half of the couple was killed.”
“That’s not very mature, Dean,” Cas said, before offering his congratulations to Sam and Eileen. “I hope you’ll be very happy. You deserve some happiness.”
“Yeah but they never smile like that with anyone else,” she explained, sounding far older than an average eight-year-old. “They’re always so sad all the time but they smile all the time when they talk to you.”
Cas didn’t finish his sentence, but Dean knew what it was he’d stopped himself from saying. He was thinking about after they left the house, and yeah, that was pretty depressing too, but maybe it was an indication that Cas didn’t want to leave either.
Making a decision, he took Dean’s hand in his, and pulled him towards the house. “I believe it’s necessary for me to experience sex right now. I think it’ll be important for my growth as a human.”
He could see Cas mulling the idea over. It worried Dean that his friend hadn’t immediately agreed to the situation. It made him start to doubt his own competence with the kids. Maybe he hadn’t done so great of a job the past times he’d watched them. “Unless you don’t trust me with them?”
Dean slowly opened his eyes and blinked at him, before sitting up and ruffling his hair with his hand. “Morning, sunshine. What’s in the garden?”
Dean went over to the fridge, presumably to look for something to eat, and Castiel felt it would be okay to leave him alone now. He opened the door, but before he could step outside, Dean asked,
Surely Dean didn’t understand the magnitude of this offer. Didn’t understand just how desperate the situation felt for Castiel. They wanted to be able to handle this on their own, to have a way to financially support themself and their children, but the universe seemed to be conspiring against it all. Dean’s mere suggestion that he would be willing to allow Castiel the chance to get back on their feet by staying with him was a gift, one Castiel didn’t know if they could accept.
Dean realised that Cas wasn’t too comfortable with the idea of just picking up what he wanted and putting it in the cart, so he decided to do it for him. As he placed the plant carefully in the cart, he asked, “See any other colours you like?”
He clapped Cas on the shoulder, before getting up to clear away the bowl and the beer bottles. “That was false advertising, alright. But it was a good movie, so there’s no need to apologise.”
“I’m not going to like this, am I?” Cas asked, looking like they were contemplating kicking Dean out to get back to their work.
It took almost half an hour to drive to the garden center, and Cas spent a large part of it explaining how he wanted to get some roses, but that they wouldn’t attract bees; for that, he would need lavender. Apparently, lavender and roses could be grown together, and Cas was pretty sure the soil was perfect for growing both.
It was as Dean got a grip of himself that he realized Jack’s lower lip was wobbling and that it probably hadn’t been a smart move to shout.
Dean’s features softened immediately, and he shook his head as he interrupted, “Hey, no. It wasn’t your fault he wouldn’t take a hint. He’s a persistent fucker, I’ll give him that.”
When he was spent, he collapsed onto Dean with a grunt, and as they lay there catching their breath, Dean absentmindedly trailed his fingers up and down Cas’s back. Cas murmured contentedly into Dean’s neck, and kissed the skin there as his breathing evened out, and Dean wondered if his angel was about to fall asleep. But then he heard a tired voice speak.
Dean waited for Cas to form their thoughts. He didn’t want to try and push the matter any more than he already had and he wasn’t really sure what he’d do next if Cas turned this help down. Of course he’d still be there for his friend but he wasn’t sure if he could stomach watching Cas continue on hoping that they would catch a break anytime soon.
Thankfully Jack’s mood was still high and his homework assignment of a single sentence about elephants and the elephant coloring page didn’t take too long. By the time they’d cleared off the table and safely tucked Jack’s homework back into his backpack, Dean was ready to prove he wasn’t the crappy quasi-uncle the kids thought he was.
Just last week he’d yelled at Claire when she was picking on Jack. Castiel hadn’t been mad about it and the two of them had a short discussion about it the next day, but it still rolled in the pit of Dean’s stomach knowing he’d already overstepped. The last thing Dean wanted to do was make Castiel think Dean was judging his parenting. He’d just been so shocked by Claire’s outburst and refusal to listen that Dean’s instinct had been to help.
Cas looked a little dazed, and it took him a second to continue speaking. “But then you seemed to like it, and I didn’t want the ghost to interrupt us any more, because-”
Dean frowned at Castiel, his brow furrowing as he regarded him. “Oh. Well, y’know… I thought I might’ve-”
Armed with a bucket of soapy water, glass cleaning spray, cloths, and paper towels, Dean got to work on the windows. He was relieved to discover that each window swivelled around, so he was able to clean the inside and outside of each one with little difficulty.
Dean had to stop himself from making a snarky remark about Cas not wanting to spend anymore time with him than necessary. That definitely wouldn’t have been a smart move.
Thankfully, it turned out Sam was right about the case; it was all over in a couple of hours, and they left behind a very relieved and grateful family. After that, all they needed to do was find a motel for the night and relax before moving onto the second case in the morning.
What Castiel really liked about the house, however, was how unusually structured it was. He had visited enough towns to have noticed that most houses were built in a similar shape and style, with identically sized windows and doors. But this one was irregular, with lots of quirky features, including columns either side of the front door, and even a dome on top that was reminiscent of a church.
“Do they–do they like it here?” He eventually asked, turning and setting Cas’s plate of food in front of them. Castiel didn’t know how to answer and it appeared by the look on their face alone, Dean already knew the answer to his own question. “It’s okay. You don’t have to lie. I might’ve overheard them saying they weren’t happy here.”
Mrs. Hanscum read the notes Claire’s teacher made carefully and remained neutral as she asked Claire a few questions. Dean silently seethed in his seat as Claire revealed the hurtful things her teacher, Ms. Black, had said to her the past few weeks.
“Sooo… we’ve got a little over twenty-four hours to kill. Wanna see how many times we can have sex before Sam gets here?”
He knew what the movie was about - of course he did - and he’d never watched it because it was a romance. And a gay one, at that. Not that he had anything against that, it just wasn’t something he would ever choose to watch, especially with his male best friend, who he had so many confusing feelings for. But he couldn’t exactly say no, could he? He’d told Cas that it was his choice, so he would have to deal with it and hope things didn’t get even more awkward.
Cas didn’t say anything for a long while and though Dean had originally felt satisfied in his message, now he was beginning to wonder if he’d officially overstepped. He’d been weighing the pros and cons of having this conversation for days and kept coming to the same decision. It was at least worth a shot to ask. Even if Cas wanted nothing to do with the idea, at least they’d know there were other options than sticking it out at a job that was making them miserable.
Dean had already made his way into the house after shaking off the sawdust from his clothes. “Trouble?” He asked, not liking the sound of that.
Cas lifted two fingers to Dean’s temple, and Dean felt the warmth of his grace as it flowed into him. He felt a wave of guilt that Cas was wasting his fading grace on him, but then again, he probably wouldn’t be much use if he had a concussion. Plus, it
Deciding to distract himself by talking about something else, he pointed towards Cas’s almost finished burger. “How’s the food? Is it good? Doesn’t taste like molecules?”
Cas was mostly relieved that they’d be able to get home and would even be able to eat dinner with their kids. Even though they knew their car was going to be sitting in the parking lot overnight, it was a problem they could worry about in the morning.
Castiel reached the top, and turned again to fix Dean with a stern eyebrow. He was about to reprimand Dean for his childishness, but the grin on his face stopped Castiel in his tracks. Seeing Dean looking so full of fun made Castiel’s stomach do a little flip, and he wished he was the reason for Dean’s smile.
“I know you did, buddy. Claire, do you want to hear all about elephants? Jack learned some cool things.”
“I’m not like most angels,” Cas said, and wasn’t that the truth? The others were all dicks with wings; well, ninety nine percent of them were, anyway.
Being nosy, Dean peered into Cas’s closet and looked through some of the items. In fact, most of the items he saw looked far older than a few years. At the far end of the closet were some of Dean’s favorite pieces Cas wore. A few oversized sweaters Cas only put on when they were at home. They were in different shades of blue, purple, and pink, all a similar soft fabric and Dean couldn’t stop the smile that tugged at his lips when he thought of Cas in them.
