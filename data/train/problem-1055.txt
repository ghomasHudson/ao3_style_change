"Calm down, he's getting a glass just as big as yours." As if to prove it, Greg slammed a glass full of something clear in front of John. "Sambuca and lemonade. Enjoy."
"Same thing."
perks.
Sherlock seemed irritated by the question, his head jerking slightly back as his fingers twitched atop his thighs. “Of course I’m sure, John. What possible reason could I have for rejecting your request?”
His words were like blows. John knew, his head telling him quite loudly, that Sherlock was clearly not in his right mind and was beyond irrational at that moment, but the fact that he was essentially saying the things that John himself had been considering these last few days – that one day Sherlock would wake up and realise that John was, as Mycroft had said so correctly, too ordinary to waste his time on – was just a little too close to home for comfort.
"OH MY GOD, YOU'RE A GAY MAN."
"Oh no, I was talking about the smiling. I do far too much of that with you."
John leapt up himself. “No, I’m fine!”
"Not that time," she said sheepishly, reaching up and tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear – she instantly looked ten years younger, simply from this obviously self-conscious motion and the topic of conversation. "I didn't have the confidence to talk to him, though Mummy took great pleasure in my obvious attraction. Oddly enough, a week before the next ball, she came to me and told me that 'the handsome Holmes boy from last year' had been asking his own mother if I would be there. It's not a big village," she said with a smile, "so everyone knew each other."
"Your talent?"
John laughed his familiar humourless laugh, rolling his eyes to the man who could not see them.
John didn’t seem at all surprised by this, simply nodding in agreement and straightening up. “Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that.”
John pointed a leek in Sherlock's direction, shaking it at him. "Just when I think I'm getting used to you..." He broke off, shaking his head again and turning to grab a knife to start cutting the vegetable up. "I must admit, it makes me feel at least
doesn't even have the decency to tell me that he knows." His icy eyes were fixed on John's like a magnet. "Of course I'm overreacting. How very silly of me."
"Ugh." Sherlock wrinkled his nose in disgust. "Water, then."
"I, err... I actually meant that I don't think I could... y'know, the strength of feeling you described, it doesn't... I don't think..."
A shuffling of paper, a shifting of posture. John was staring at the table beside him like his life depended on it, unable to face that look again for the foreseeable future. "I'm not looking at you like
Greg dodged his way around Sherlock's parents and settled himself next to Mycroft (much to the older man's obvious exasperation), leaning on his arms as he peered at Sherlock and John over his sunglasses. "So. You two. Sorted?"
One ring. Two rings. Three -
"No I bloody don't."
"No she isn't. You're fine the way you are."
This is the view from the top of Greenwich Park at the sort of time that this chapter is set, so this is how you can imagine it!
can shut up, too, with your self-pitying bullshit. Yeah, you've been a shit husband and a shit dad, but this isn't about you – again,
“Seriously though,” John pressed, grateful for the subject change, something he could handle easily in comparison to the awkwardness of discussing his impending trip home, “all of the things you think you did wrong during that point just don’t matter anymore. They got us to where we are now, and I don’t know about you but I’m rather enjoying the consequences.”
"I hurt you. I hurt you knowingly and willingly, as you said, with every intention of making it so unbearable for you here that you would have to leave. It is unforgivable. I have done so many things that are entirely... unforgivable."
"Just take the drink, Sherlock," John interrupted, knowing that people would only put up with his smart-arse comments for so long, "the more you drink the less you'll care, trust me."
out of me that I'm probably going to have to end up doing something I don't want to do in order to escape whatever it is that's wrong with me. I'm going to have to... talk... to someone."
depression now." John lightly jabbed the table with his finger, raising his eyebrows towards Sherlock. "It's taking all I've got just to sit here opposite you and even
She picked up on it immediately. "You've tried?"
"Yes, it's reality, get over it." John re-opened the fridge and pulled out a bottle of milk, opening it and giving it a sniff – he recoiled, slamming the lid on top of it but not twisting it on. "Jesus.
you don't know me. you have no idea... you have no right.
"Mm."
"Mikey?" The moniker escaped before he could stop it, a grin twisting his lips up as he looked towards the now death-glaring Mycroft and let his amusement show without a hint of regret. He quickly schooled his features into a more appropriate smile as he forced his attention back to Mrs. Holmes, however, a strangely powerful determination to be liked by her welling up within his chest. "Mrs. Holmes, it's so good of you to welcome me into your home at such short notice, can't thank you enough."
Sherlock tore himself away and took a few stumbling steps back, bringing his fingers to his lips and staring at John as if he couldn't quite believe his own actions but then there was the inevitable acceptance in his eyes, the reluctant knowledge that he had finally done the only thing left in his arsenal in order to destroy whatever was left of their friendship. He spat his words like a curse. "There. Try reasoning with yourself now as to how
Both Holmes' parents were staring at him. Tim was the first to speak. "Like I said, John, it's none of our business..."
For a while they simply sat staring at each other, John working hard not to look away and reveal his increasing discomfort and Sherlock seeming equally as intent, though likely not for the same reasons; the waiters bustled around them and took away their plates, the customers around them eating and talking and laughing like nothing was happening. Then again, John's mind said reasonably, nothing
John was intensely confused. "I was under the impression that you didn't know I existed until two days ago."
berate you for that.”
Harry looked genuinely disappointed, a little line forming down her brow. “Actually, what I wanted to hear was some sort of lovey-dovey nonsense so that I could rip the shit out of you and never let you forget it, so no. You're such a let down.”
It was like being bathed in sunlight – that was the closest thing that John could associate to the feeling flooding through him, though in his experience the strongest emotion he could describe in that instance was a wonderful sort of contentment: that didn't reach far enough. It was intoxicating, enthralling, evocative – how had he never demanded to hear Sherlock play before? He could feel his skin tingling from the sensation of the notes crossing the space between them, utterly absurd as they were mere vibrations, soundwaves, but it was so much more than that because John was ready to swear that the sound of Sherlock taunting and tressing the bow over strings brought about in him the same trembling lack of comprehension as the icy stare that he now so longed to have on him, only him, only
A brief moment where Greg genuinely seemed to consider it – but no, he was pushing himself up off the armchair and rubbing his hair roughly with his hands, shaking his head and grinning almost as if wondering how he had let it get this far. "Nah, no, y'know what? I can't do it. He has to do this himself, it's not fair on him -"
Nina waited. She knew the right moments to stay silent. He decided that he might actually attend the next session.
The man behind the desk stood up, dark eyes meeting John's unwaveringly and openly; his lips flickered instantly with a small but seemingly genuine smile as he stepped around to where John stood, keeping his gaze fixed on his throughout his movements. His whole demeanour was somehow comfortingly laid-back, white shirt tucked into what were clearly designer jeans and shoes perfectly polished but his gait so relaxed and open that John felt himself reacting instinctively as he returned the man's small smile. He watched the man walk slowly, steadily enough towards him as if to give John the upper hand to move should he want to, his arm reaching out as he got closer to extend an oddly delicate hand to him as he spoke in a quiet, entirely non-threatening voice:
John edged into the room a little more, hands still rooted deeply within his pockets. “You all right?”
John opened his mouth to speak, but William got there first. "No," he said, baritone voice offhanded as he turned away from them both and picked up a single bottle of red wine from the table. "He's all yours."
Sherlock was instantly alert; he knew without a shadow of a doubt that John would have never told Greg that, no matter how talkative he was feeling. He couldn’t explain it even to himself, though god knew he wanted to be able to, but he was absolutely certain that John understood the depths to which Sherlock had gone in order to do the things he had done back at Well Place and that he would keep it to himself regardless of what he was currently thinking. He raised his chin, defensive. “Is that an educated guess or have you been having me followed again?”
"You wouldn't drop it, what was I supposed to do?"
how you feel about… well, feelings in general, I know it makes you all huffy and snorty so don't bother giving me that look that tells me you're above all of that. Because it's plain as day right now, to me at least, that we need to clear the air a bit – we've both been going through things recently and now we're both going to counselling and god knows even the
The burning gaze was back, fixated completely on John as Sherlock rocked back and forth on his heels slightly; John found himself rooted to the spot, wondering inwardly if Sherlock had any bloody clue how intense he was, knowing deep down that the clueless man probably had absolutely no idea. No wonder he'd been propositioned three times tonight, if he was looking at the insanely drunk girls with those eyes. If John was a rabbit caught in Sherlock's headlights then those girls were already roadkill.
Irritated, Sherlock took a step forward. “Just let me in, Mycroft, I don’t have all night.”
.” He tilted his chin up in a strange mirror to his brother, to whose appearance he shared barely any resemblance. “Indulge yourself. You seem to be becoming quite adept at that, so take advantage of this rare offering to do so in my presence and let's get it over with.”
"Fine. Fine. My favourite colour is blue. Okay? Blue."
His steady heartbeat picked up slightly.
was what was 'going on'? I thought I'd made that abundantly clear to you."
Wait, what? How the hell do you know if I'm stubborn or not? Who the hell are you?
His mind went blank. "Uh. I don't know. I don't think so. I, er... no. No, no questions. I think it's all... clear."
The facade was back.
– take a fucking drink and stick to the rules...
He eyed her steadily. "I've told you too much, you know." He shook his head. "It is a failure on my part."
Leaning back slightly but somehow managing to fight the urge to claw Sherlock's tight grasp from around his arms, heart thumping a little erratically at the sudden burst of adrenaline that shot through his system, he forced himself to meet Sherlock's intense, somewhat manic stare with his own calm, steady one. He saw the mania in the man's face, saw his desperation and he found he could not turn away from it, couldn't back away. With an inward sigh and a not-so-inward curse, he finally nodded.
An exasperated sigh drew itself from John's throat as he shook his head, placing his hands on his hips. "Because apparently I need to get pissed off with you at least once a day or the world will implode, I don't know." He brought his hands up to his face, rubbing it hard, skin still hot despite the cold air around them. "Goddamn it, William."
Huh. Seventeen. He'd probably slept through most of them. Sighing, he moved his mouse over the ones which said things such as 'LONDON UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCES STUDENT UNION MEMBERS, HALF PRICE DRINKS TONIGHT' and 'Attendance Concerns' and instantly deleted them, knowing that whatever was in them was of no bother to him – after his conversation with Joanne yesterday he was almost certain that she would have spoken to his seminar leaders already, though what she could have possibly said was a mystery to him. Like everything these days, he didn't particularly care what was said.
John threw his hands up in the air. "Oh, well if we're doing this now – why the hell would you tell me your name's William if your name is Sherlock?! What, you were playing with me? What else don't I know, are you married? Have three illegitimate children? A time-share in Dubai?"
"No," Sherlock argued, shaking his head back and forth as he leaned forward, "no, you
Sherlock thought as he deposited the bottle of brandy on the nightstand. A deep alpha growl of approval rumbled in his chest as John worked himself up to a full erection with a couple swipes of his palm, not even remotely self-conscious.
“It was all very under the table. We got word that someone in high places is meddling in some dark business dealings,” Mycroft explained, his eyes going distant. “I put Sherlock on the case; I’m too high profile a face, and my people are well known in their circles. Our target would have jumped ship as soon as they realized we were on their tail.”
“John! There’s a dead man in the hallway!” Came her high-pitched shriek.
John is nothing if not complex.
"What's this? Did you get shot?!" Sherlock eyed the blood-stained skin, shrugging.
,” Mycroft’s hand slapped the table, making John flinch. “It’s their
“Ambulance.”
"Yeah, yeah, he's still in custody, undergoing tests. I'll get the lads to take him in. We'll figure the rest out in the morning." Lestrade agreed, already sounding distracted himself.
There was a scuffle of movement in the dark, a moaning sob that would have sent those with a lesser spirit running. Sherlock turned his light to the movement, twisted his wrist until the torchlight landed on a small figure crumbled in the corner of the room. Sherlock was not in close enough proximity to see full details, but even from this distance he could see that the other man’s short stature and small hands were indicative of an omega. Furthermore, the exposed skin of his dirty hands was wrinkle-free and unthinned by age, speaking of a younger individual.
“Now, are you going to help me, or am I gonna have to do this all by myself?”
The next morning Mycroft was having none of it. He was a miserable scowling git from the moment he knocked on John’s door. “I’m a bureaucrat, you dunce, not a bloody crime scene detective,” he growled, the words leaving his mouth while he slipped past into the flat. They glared at each other over tea that John barely sipped than Mycroft brought out the half-opened sleeve of Digestives and laid them out on the table like a peace offering. “I’ll have you remember we are doing this against my advisement.” Mycroft reminded, his lips a thin line of annoyance as John grudgingly accepted a biscuit.
A moment later, his phone pinged with a response.
Warning! Sexually Explicit scenes below. If you aren't interested in reading then pop back in for the next chapter.
"Am I ever wrong?" The very fucking idea. Sherlock rolled his eyes. When would they learn to stop questioning him? "This is their headquarters. There's no doubt about it."
Welcome to the real feels of this fic. Things are going to get desperate and uncomfortable from here out. John is a literal mess at the moment. I wanted to write him with a bit of raw grief, because our boy is not afraid to feel, though feeling around Mycroft? That might be a different story. Sherlock has been missing for 3 months, and I'm sure you're all thinking that's a freaking long time for John to have sat around doing nothing. Not the case, I'm sure he's been trying his hardest to find Sherlock, it's just he hasn't had the information to go off of to even start. We can blame Mycroft for that, he's a bit of a secretive asshole.
“Mrs. Hudson?!” John shouted.
Eagerly he reached for the other man, his fingers tangling in black locks and tugging Sherlock down until their lips meet with a spark of pent-up desire. Sherlock lets him lead, eagerly seeking out John’s lips with a sharp clash of teeth that spoke of two people who still did not quite know each other's bodies yet.
It all came down to the math in the end. His mind reminding him that if he said those three words aloud, then there was at least a fifty percent chance that John would reject him. Considering John's general preference for alpha females, Sherlock's odds were closer to a seventy-seven percent chance of being rejected.
Across the way, a lorry came to a stop in front of the warehouse, the breaks squealing in the rain. The driver leapt from his door before the wheels had a chance to fully stop. Despite the weather, the scent of aggressive alpha penetrated the air. Strong and chili pepper hot on the nose, it seeped into his nostrils like bad Chinese food. Sherlock resisted the urge to growl, forcing his own protective alpha response down with a slow, controlled breath so as not to risk giving their position away.
“Is there anyone at the head of the alley?” John questioned, his voice a gravelly whisper. Bringing himself to a stop beside a trash bin he waited, watching the camera pan across the street, the movement painfully slow. Idly he pushed a hand up under his jacket, hissing through his teeth as he tugged a piece of glass from his back. It was stained with his blood and clinked softly as he dropped it to the ground. There was more where it came from, he could feel the various splinters and shards piercing his skin and aggravating every movement. John had been through worse though, he’d survived a gunshot, and Afghanistan, this was nothing compared to that.
A sound to their left had both men jerking their heads up, and Mycroft pulling away. Stepping forward, John peered into their dim surroundings. Through the low light filtering through broken windows of the warehouse, John caught sight of a stocky silhouette running away from them.
“Fuck off you fat toff. I ain’t tellin’ you shit, take my soul to the grave.” The omega shouted, his words devolving to nothing but vitriolic curses.
“Good, good.” If his voice breaks Mycroft has the grace not to mention. He couldn’t admit aloud how hearing Mycroft soothed him, smoothing the edges of his anxiety down to manageable levels.
- Mycroft seems to be doing his very best to stop John from finding out and working on Sherlock's case
"Bloody hell…." John groaned in a rush as Sherlock filled him, his fingers spasmed where they clutched around the swell of Sherlock's biceps, his voice breaking. Sherlock smiled, a lopsided sloppy thing, and just focused on giving John a moment to adjust, forcing back the need to pull out and thrust in harder. Opening his eyes, he examined the lines and planes of John's face. The blond didn't seem to be in pain since Sherlock had taken care to properly prepare him. "You are
Beside his head, Sherlock’s phone chimed again. Neither of them paid it any mind.
Stay tuned for more chapter updates.
“John, get out, he’s one of them!” Mycroft shouted into the Bluetooth microphone, hoping his voice would be loud enough to get John’s attention. He watched with a gut aching fear in his belly as the driver got into the vehicle again. Watched as the vehicles running lights flared to life.
“Take me to-” John stuttered to a stop as he looked up into the rear-view mirror and met the seedy brown eyes and a familiar balding features of the man from earlier. The man who had injected him. “Oh…bloody hell, it’s you.” The grinning leer he received in return was tinged with blood from where his lip had split in their earlier scuffle. Barely able to think through the encroaching darkness John weakly moved to grab the doorknob, yanking at it just as the locks on the doors clicked closed with a sharp finality.
"I'm gonna get a tea, want anything?" Colt questioned after an indeterminate amount of time filled only with the sound of Brody's phone beeping.
Nini's Rambles:
John didn’t realize he was screaming until Mycroft’s tall frame blocked off his view of the door. He found himself suddenly muscled away from the horrible sight until his back slammed into the wall behind him. He was barely aware enough to feel long, cold fingers latched around his throat and jerk his neck up, forcing his vision away from the bloody sight until he was starring up into storm blue eyes. Mycroft’s mouth was moving, but he couldn’t concentrate enough to hear through the pounding of his own heart and the sound of his own cries.
He'd probably snap. Even so, Sherlock did have to admit that these people, whoever they were, knew what they were doing.
I forgot to leave gifs in the last chapter. They've been added!
-There are some huge plot points addressed in this chapter. We found out more about Eddington and what Sherlock has discovered so far.
Beneath him, John whimpered a sweet, heady sound, his fingers twisting in Sherlock's hair as his pleasure grew. Sitting up, Sherlock watched the omega writhe, his head kicking back against the pillows, lower lip clenched between the sharp, white peak of teeth. His insides gushed with moisture, the lubricant spilling from between the thrust of Sherlock's fingers, staining the navy sheets and glossing between his tanned thighs. John looked glorious. The very sight of him had Sherlock's cock straining between his legs, aching to be surrounded by the tight muscles of his channel.
The night was damp and cold, as it tended to be this time of year. His breath fogged from his lips in a bellowing gust, disappearing in the humidity of the air in seconds. Taking a moment to himself he paused on the street edge, looking out over the River Thames. His eyes lingered over the dark blue water, lapping at the edge of the Westminster Pier. The lights from the Ferris-wheel across the way reflecting bright azure across the surface of the river.
He couldn't do it anymore.
Sherlock closed his eyes, relishing the moment. A moment he honestly had never thought he would get to have. “To be honest, I am surprised we just did that,” Sherlock admitted, running his hand through John’s sweat-dampened locks in return. His fingers shook in the aftermath of their coming together, uncertainty coming back now that the heat of the moment had passed. What had they just done? Would it last, could they make this new thing work? Change was terrifying, what's more, neither of them was very good at it. He couldn’t recall the last time he’d seen John buy something new at the grocery, it was always the same staples, picked with exacting precision. He himself struggled even to go into a new restaurant, and they had the same five takeout menu’s for the last four years. Unchanging. Maybe unchangeable?
Tabitha stopped what she was doing to roll her eyes. "If you don't want him dead, it's probably best I finish the leg first." She snapped.
There was no need to imagine now. He took to worshiping John with all the ease of a man who had been thinking about the many ways he could do so for years. He kneaded his hands along the small of Johns back until he had a handful of John’s warm posterior. He sucked and licked and explored honeyed skin to his heart's content. It was new, and different, so different than he had ever expected. It was John that was a surprise, for all Sherlock's deductions he'd never expected this; an open willing partner with little to no reservations for the sudden new turn they had taken.
Comment me, kudo me, love me people!
“I was just thinking about the scientific data on male omega reproductive systems,” Sherlock admitted against the shell of John’s ear. John groaned, one hand slapping against the top of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock flinched, even though the touch was light enough, and scowled, he ducked his face into the scoop of John’s neck to get away from John’s teasing.
“Fuck. Yeah, that hit an artery.” John admitted, feeling remarkably detached from the situation. His head swirled, the vertigo making his stomach cringe. Turning to the side he dry heaved, though there was nothing in his stomach to actually vomit.
They were on the second floor; there was no way he was getting out the fire-escape and down the ladder before the two men started firing. He’d be ripe for the firing squad of they made it to the stairwell before he got down. If dead was what they wanted, they’d accomplish it. Plus, there was no telling how many men were outside; he could step out on to the fire-escape and have a sniper shooting him through the head before he got a chance to blink. Dead again, not the option he was looking for.
Nini's Rambles:
“Good morning to you,” John called, taking a moment to glance up and meet the eyes of the russet haired man. “Feeling a bit of a fuss today, Myc-” John’s lips clipped shut as the door swung open, revealing not one, but two strangers. Two strangers with guns.
“Ta.” Sherlock yanked his hand free from the other man’s grasp. “Now come here, I have other things I want you to touch.” Reaching out with his good hand he wrapped it around John’s neck and yanked the other man onto his lap. John laughed loud and clear as he followed Sherlock’s demands and threw one leg over Sherlock’s hips so he straddled the alpha.
“Christ, I don’t remember ever seeing you do something so…mundane before.” John stared, wondering if he should photograph this moment, for posterity’s sake, if nothing else.
Sherlock winced as John’s fingers brushed over the jagged bite mark on his hand, he looked down just as John caught sight of the injury. “What’s this? Did someone bite you?!” Sherlock eyed the reddened, infected looking skin, brow furrowing. Up until this moment he had completely forgotten about it.
The smell of Chinese takeout greeted him as he walked in the door. Sherlock paused, spying John's back, where he faced the microwave, no doubt reheating the food. The sight of him had Sherlock's heart in his throat. He looked homey and comfortable in a set of worn jeans and a black tee that was rucked up one hip in a way that said he'd been sitting on the sofa only moments before. His hair was still damp from a shower, left to dry without a fuss.
"I'm keeping a volatile alpha, with no sense of self-preservation out of a very dangerous situation with vulnerable omegas." Lestrade snapped. "The fact that John's not here doesn't make me any more comfortable with letting you take point." He gave Sherlock a shove, his fist winding into the soggy wool of Sherlock's collar before he pushed the alpha towards Donovan, "Stay here. We'll call you in when the situation has been handled." And then louder. "Move in everybody. On my count. Ten....nine...eight..."
His breath left a puff of condensation on the windowpane as he let out a sigh of relief. If the only thing he did with this whole situation was keep her safe, it was well worth it. Thinking critically, he dug into his pocket until he felt the hard edges of his phone. Gun still cocked, and at the ready, he unlocked the screen, dividing his attention between watching the window, the door, his downed captor, and the phone. On the screen there was a singular notification from Mycroft.
He did so hate giving police reports, but give them he did, with enough whining on Lestrade's part. Needless to say, it had been tedious and terribly dull, doting his I's and crossing his T's. Unfortunately, absolutely none of it had distracted his mind from the horrible sight
"Told you to drop the gun, you dunce." Colt almost sounded regretful as he yanked the cushion off the couch and used it to elevate Sherlock's injured leg. This close the scent of almond bitters was heady and strong in the air. Sherlock couldn't tell if it was his typical smell, or if it was stronger thanks to the stress of the moment.
There was reason to want this whole thing finalized. These people were sanctioning human trafficking of the worst kind. Omegas. Dozens unaccounted for. The cases of the missing went back five years. Five whole years of evidence lost thanks to poor detective work and weak evidence.
It all came down to the math in the end. His mind reminding him that if he said those three words aloud than there was at least a fifty percent chance that John would reject him. Take into account John’s general preference for alpha females, and his odds were closer to seventy-five percent chance of being rejected. If that were to happen Sherlock was certain it would ruin their friendship, there was no going back after a profession of love. It would stick in John’s mind and rip at Sherlock’s heart; poisoning their friendship and ruining the little slice of perfection that they had created together.
The sound of Colt's gun going off was followed by red hot pain shooting up his leg. Sherlock's leg buckled, and he cried out as bone crumbled from the blast, his femur and tibia going down in that order as first one, then the other met with relentless steel flying at high velocity.
Other than a fever and general aches, he was symptom-free up to this moment. Without the knowledge he'd just gained, he might have just chalked it up to a cold. Perhaps John had cleared out the wound enough to prevent further infection? That would depend on the virus's strength, which brought him to his next concern.
Sherlock’s phone chimes again, perhaps a little more persistent.
From there, everything had unraveled, a dark, dirty entanglement of kidnapping, breeding, and slavery. Or at least that was what Sherlock's research had shown. The fact that Sherlock had, up to this point, not found a single victim perhaps warranted the most concern. To his knowledge, no reports had surfaced mentioning botched kidnapping attempts. No families had come forward about their missing family members because, until a month ago, they'd taken those people who wouldn't be missed: the homeless and drug-addled.
Sherlock caught the box out of the air with a soft grunt. The package was new. They went through bandages far more often than most people, given their day jobs. He used his nails to work at the tape as John swiped the washcloth from the bed. Sherlock scowled down at the box, forcing himself not to watch what John was doing. His mood dampened considerably further at the thought of the other man washing away all the evidence of their coming together. He tried to force down those baser instincts but couldn't quite manage it.
John had never been the type to take no for an answer, and he wasn’t looking to start now, especially with one Mycroft Holmes. So for the first few days, he set out on his own, hoping by some stroke of dumb luck, that he’d get a clue dropped in his lap. He wasn’t disillusioned enough to believe he would get much further than Mycroft and his people had, but Sherlock took him along on his cases for a reason. He was the sensible one, the one who saw things like an average, ungifted, boring human.
Above him, Sherlock let out a deep rumble of a chuckle, obviously not feeling the same way. “Come now, John,” He purred, and John sighed as he felt lips descend onto the pale expanse of his neck, soft, warm breath brushing against his skin as the other man scented him lightly. Sherlock seemed pleased with what he smelled, given the sweet rumbling sound of approval that vibrated against John’s neck. John hummed back, still too drowsy to open his eyes, but more than happy to arch his neck and offer more of it for the other man to examine. Sherlock seemed to appreciate the display of submission, the alpha in him no doubt pleased by it. Plump lips trailed up John’s throat, warm and damp, then he pressed a kiss to John’s mouth. He smelled slightly of last night's brandy and morning breath.
The gentle smack of lips pressed to the top of his curls. Sherlock smiled against the swell of John's bicep, "You like that you've thoroughly debauched me, don't you?" John purred, his voice turning dark and sultry. "Smelling of nothing but sex and you."
In the end, he never had the chance to catch up with the mysterious man. He had stopped a block away from the warehouse, slightly out of breath and with a stitch in his side. Guided by instinct, he stopped to snap a photo of the man’s shoe treads where he had splashed through a grimy puddle of street sludge. It took only a moment to send the images off to Mycroft, though he could not be certain if it would be of any use to the other man.
he had to be here. The Keeper, the man running this whole show. Every piece of intelligence he'd gathered up to now had pointed here. This was where their leader was. It had to be! How could he be wrong?
“Yes, darling, I think so.” Pressing a kiss to John’s lips he shifted up to his elbows disconnecting from the other man enough to put some space between them. Stroking the soft skin of John’s belly he could feel the slowly deflating swell of his knot. “Are you uncomfortable?”
"He's pregnant. How the hell is he pregnant, Lestrade?" Sherlock deduced, laughing under his breath. Omegas, especially male omegas, needed to be very well cared for to bear children. A sick, terrified, captive male omegas did not become pregnant. One of those men in the house had been his mate. How had he not realized this sooner? It was brilliant!
In his arms, Sebastian took up that aching Omega Wail. Sherlock cringed, his instincts urging him to
Making a leap of logic Mycroft pulled up a visual of Texaco petrol stations in the area, and narrow his search down to those next to a CCTV camera. Accounting for the potential distance John had traveled on foot he narrowed down his parameters further. Clicking rapidly through his program, he pulled up the footage of each camera that met the criteria he had set. Flashing from one visual to the next, until he caught sight of what he was looking for. He wasn’t surprised to find the lens already pointed in John's direction. His unknown hacker was no doubt manipulating the camera from another location.
“What do you mean by dark business?” John questioned, sitting up straighter and drinking in every word Mycroft said. His heart hammered with the realization that he was finally getting answers. His voice was sharp and demanding, the military surgeon in him taking over.
“Ah…” The sound slipped out past John’s soft lips, a deep hum of understanding.“I forget how you alpha’s are sometimes.” John admitted, dropping the cloth to the table. Sherlock felt the bed dip and sighed as John kneeled beside him, wrapping strong arms around his shoulders and dragging Sherlock in for a tight embrace against his bare chest. Sherlock felt and heard the gently smack of lips as they pressed to the top of his curls. He smiled against the swell of Johns bicep, “You like that you’ve thoroughly debauched me, don’t you?” John purred, his voice turning dark and sultry. “Smelling of nothing but sex and you.”
This would work. It had to. He needed John more than any case, more than any other person.
- That damn cabby is a jerk and has screwed over both our boys, someone should think about running him over
This is an excerpt from a previous story I wrote. I don't honestly have any plans for completing that fic, but I thought I'd take my favorite tidbit from it and kinda flesh it out into its own personal short fic. Who knows, maybe someday I'll finish Until the End, but for now, maybe you'll enjoy this?

I'll give the link once I start posting the new story!
"What are you talking about?" Lestrade asked, moaning in annoyance.
His fingers flashed over the keys to his laptop as he attempted to regain access to the visual feeds from CCTV. His existing permissions had been incapacitated, and while that did make his job difficult, he had proxies in place for such situations.
“Hmmm…a romantic friend?” John asked, bringing his tea to his lips and taking a large gulp. The look on Mycroft’s face was well worth the question as he dropped his drink from his lips and leveled John with a disbelieving look. “Oh come on, even an asexual like you can get their romance on, don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it,” John questioned, peeling an orange slice from the rind and popping it into his mouth. Sure, Mycroft was a bit of a nit and had a tendency to be a little bit bossy, but he was more than capable of love, as long as it didn't bore him.
-We've seen, possibly for the second time, I can't recall, the emergence of secondary scent undertones. These overlay existing scents, and exist depending on how much our characters are feeling, or what they surround themselves with.  Also, they vary depending on the person, it's instinct for A/B/O genders to understand what those scents mean, probably through chemical traces or some BS science that I'll make up later. (EA: Sherlock's fear smells like lemons, but that same emotion on another person might smell like cut grass. Also, lemon's might just be someone's primary scent, it all just depends!)
Sherlock felt hands drag through the tangled, wet locks of his hair, and had the presence of mind to close his eyes fully, letting his jaw sag in a spot-on imitation of drug-induced lethargy. His head is yanked up, hair pulling painfully from the weight of it. He could feel the other man’s eyes on his face, examining him with a critical eye.
“Fucking finally!” John groaned against his lips, latching onto his mouth with an eager moan that went right down to Sherlock’s groin. Every cell in Sherlock’s brain sang out with pure joy. The scent of John warm honey, mixed with hints of ash and sun-soaked-wheat enveloped his senses, hot and warm, and so John that it took him higher than any drug ever had. He inhaled a desperate, gasp of air against John’s cheek, needing that scent deep in his sinuses. It felt so damn right, deep down into his core.
- Mrs. Hudson seriously needs to update her building, talk about safety hazards!
John chuckled, his elbows slipped out from underneath him as he slumped bonelessly on the table. His chest rose and fell in rapid gasps. Breathing in a calming breath he seemed to consider the ceiling for a moment, “Not before you buy a lad a drink, right?” He lifted his head from the table and gave Sherlock a mischievous raise of his eyebrow. The pale length of his foot lifted up and shoved at Sherlock playfully, taking away any sting the words might have had.
things.
His mind drew up detailed visions of the poor omega woman, overlaying them with young August. Symptoms had been similar: deranged action, sores, and pus, the blue veins at the neck and wrists. His lips felt fine, his hand and wrists unmarred by thickened veins. He certainly did not feel anymore crazed than usual. August had been bitey. He was an alpha, so the urge did tend to hit every once and a while, but it was no stronger than usual.
Against him John stirred, a soft groaning sigh sifting against the fabric of his shirt. Sherlock moaned, closing his eyes and shaking his head in denial as John twisted in his arms. Dragging John’s struggling limbs down with his hardened muscles, he tugged the other man it tight, forcing him close. “I know love, I know.”
“Ah yes, Mycroft Holmes’ dearest little brother.” Sherlock held back a snort at that,
“Hmm, do I want to know how you know what different tranquilizers smell like?” Mycroft questioned, his stupid, quick wit making John laugh despite the situation. “Where were you hit?” John had to hand it to the man, he didn’t sound half as worried as John felt.
of the young man with John Watson's face.
Take note:
Sherlock scowled at the phone as the message appeared. Cellphone service was spotty at best in these areas, but nothing could be done about it until he got back within tower range. Looking up from the screen he examined where they were heading. The rain-laden streets were becoming distinctly more low income. Up ahead the van’s brake lights flashed, Sherlock watched, intrigued as the van turned left. The cabby followed behind, inconspicuous in the rain.
“Fascinating, isn’t she?” Dark pressed trousers stepped into Sherlock’s line of sight, blocking his view of the women. For a moment Sherlock is certain he has been caught,  “What do you think of our progress so far Jacob?”  But no, the man was speaking to Sherlock’s captor. Jacob, a name to put to the face of the treacherous cabby.
Another awkward silence. "Did I say something wrong? Offensive?"
about me, just not in the same way? What you don't realise, John, is that before now I didn't give two damns whether you felt anything akin to what I apparently do, I would have been perfectly content to resume our friendship as it was and go on as if nothing had changed... but now the idea of pretending such a thing is categorically impossible. I can't do it. And neither can you. So what more is there that you could possibly say to me?"
John had to swallow thickly twice before he was able to get the words out without punctuating them with a colourful array of swear-words. "So far nothing could be further from the truth."
John allowed his eyes to flit up to meet Sherlock’s. “You’re sure?”
"Oooh, romantic! Sure, mate, no problem." He was laughing, but his support was genuine. "I'll find somewhere to go. Want me to stay out the whole night?"
"Yes. We'll both get... help. We'll both find someone to talk to. Not at the same time, don't worry, just... do it with me. Do it with me and maybe it'll feel a little easier to walk in there knowing I'm not the only one preparing to lay myself open to a complete stranger."
The chin-tilt; the tightening of fingers around the slender neck of the violin.
John's own lips twitched. "Mostly blood."
, the word 'handsome' completely wasted on him; handsome implied something far too linear, too narrow, too up-and-down and obvious... and nothing was even remotely linear about this. Him. He flowed like a towering waterfall and was so fluid and dynamic even in his stillness that it almost hurt John to look at him and know that he was real. He didn't look real – the porcelain of his skin, the razor-sharp cheekbones, the eyes of ice heightened in their mercury depths against the midnight contrast of his suit, startling above the dash of colour from his tie and waistcoat. He looked ethereal.
"He was such an imaginative child," Wanda had told him as she'd prodded at a lettuce and wrinkled her nose at it, moving on to the one above it. "He used to tell
Would he have kissed John?
“I'll work harder. I'll get it done. I'll bring my marks up.”
"Night."
"Well, no, not just that -"
Taking the little leather book from the waiter and flipping it open to check the bill, John pulled out his wallet and took out a ten pound note. "It's quarter to eight, the observatory's closed now. You owe twenty," he added, putting the bill down with his ten pounds underneath it. "The wine and your untouched meal, you know."
Lips pursing in a thin line John considered if running was the better priority over dealing with the tail. Another bullet clipping a sign just inches away from him made the decision for him. Rolling his eyes he spun in place, taking a moment widen his stance, aim his gun and shoot. The sound of the bullet exploding from the barrel had him flashing back to memories of sand and the blazing sun when someone had been shooting at him in a much different manner.
“I cook,” Mycroft protested, wiping his palms with a tea-towel.
“Stop here,” Sherlock commanded, watching as the van pulled onto the road ahead and turned to the left, disappearing around the corner. The brakes on the cab squeaked and Sherlock glowered at the necessity of having to pay the man himself, instead of just jumping out. John usually did the paying. Without saying anything further he tossed a couple of notes at the man over the partition and stepped out into the rain dashed road.
“It’s like that then?” He questioned.
Sherlock peaked his eyes open again in time to see Brody hitch himself up onto the desk and sit on it. The sound of his boots on expensive oak had Sherlock's head pounding. Squinting his eyes against the ache, he turned his attention to what had fallen on the floor. There were a few leaves of paper and a business card of some type. They held little importance, though. His eyes lit on an expensive-looking pen that had fallen on the floor, now that could be useful. It was one of those ugly statement pieces, something owned to hoist one's status to others. Mycroft had one just like it, entitled prat that he was.
“I should get that.” He mumbled against John’s lips, reaching for his phone with one hand, the other holding himself above John’s body with surprising ease.
John choked at the word mate, hands falling to his side, his fingers clenching into tight fists. For a moment, he eyed the plaster bust of Queen Elizabeth on the mantel and considered chucking it at the smug man's head. It took a monumental effort to push down that desire, but he managed. It seemed Mycroft was destined to bring out the worst in him. “It’s not like that. We were never... never that. Never mates.” John tried to explain, looking away from Mycroft's stormy eyes, so he did not have to see the look of disbelief that overcame the other man’s features.
John hissed out a sound of enraptured fascination, palming the stiff swell of his sex and dropping back against the pillows with a needy sigh.
If you get a chance check out my other fic, chapter two is up. It's a Deadpool/Peter Parker zombie fic!
The thought felt dreadfully close to admitting defeat. Mycroft straightened in place, locking his knees in an attempted to push back the malaise. In front of him Lestrade’s eyes narrowed and his brow furrowed with the telltale signs of concern. Leaning into Mycroft’s space he drew in a deep breath. Whatever he smelled most have answered his question since his eyes softened with sadness.
“Tell me what you have found.” He commanded, slipping into the back seat and waiting for her to follow suit.
“73823,” The words echoed through the phone lines as he watched a familiar stocky omega fumble with the handle of a taxi; those same numbers displayed in white vinyl on the back fender. The back of his jacket was stained with dark splotches of blood, as it had been earlier, confirming John’s identity.
Then he remembered the taste of Sherlock on his lips, the feel of their bodies intertwined together. Remembered the words they’d said to each other weeks ago.
John seemed to give in to some inner need and dropped his hold in Sherlock’s hair, instead using his palms as he hopped up onto the table, shimmying onto the wood with a roll of his hips. Sherlock moved with him, dropping his hands to grip the back of John’s legs and help him up. Moaning his approval John spread his legs to give Sherlock room to ease between them. Sherlock took the invitation for what it was, crowding the space between John’s legs until his aching hardness butted up against John’s eager erection. Both of them spurred into overeager excitement just from the shock of coming together. John whined low in his throat, one leg shifting up to latch around Sherlock’s hip so that he could grind them together, eager and wanton.
Sherlock chuckled in relief as he realized that John had the same fears of inadequacy and rejection he had.
Humming his approval he stood up and closed the door behind him. Turning he made his way to Sherlock’s flat. Maeve fell in stride beside him, leading the way across the narrow street. The neighborhood was quiet, but for his men and the cop cars that were only just arriving on the scene. A paramedic stepped out of an ambulance, followed by two others in a similar uniform. One of Mycroft’s men, Cedric, stepped up to the group, holding both his arms in a hold gesture, one hand holding his badge.
Nini's Rambles: Here we have another Sherlock chapter. This one's a bit of a filler, but it does need to be here, I need to clarify some of the background plot that he's been dealing with. We learn some important things during this chapter. I'm thinking there is going to be at least one more Sherlock chapter, than we get back to dear old John and how he's doing.  For now we get to see how Sherlock hands this sort of situation.
people? Puzzling over the conundrum he made his way down the pier, his cab was waiting around the corner, the cabby number 73823, telling him that is was the same alpha he’d paid a ride from earlier. He’d bribed the man an extra fifty euro’s to stick around and be discrete, with the promise of more if he was there when he came back.
Her pale brown eyes flickered between the two men. "Oh. Right. Can you not... rearrange something? Nate's only doing the set for an hour and I promised him we'd be there."
John sighed, suddenly irritated. "Told you

As he sat there on the eighth day, wearing a fresh hoodie (because he had literally found no clean clothes by the fifth day) and ratty jeans, he actually started to worry. So he picked up his phone, hesitating only for a moment, before calling him.
. I'm not a child."
“I promise. As soon as he calls me to let me know he’s here, I’ll wake you up.”
"Well excuuuuuse me for thinking my little brother might come to me for help. And if you're not in trouble and you don't know why you've called me, can I hang up now? Katie's got her hands busy and I rather want to join her."
“Hello?” Sherlock’s baritone reverberated against the empty walls as he stepped inside the cramped room. Goosebumps rose on the skin of his forearms as a light breeze dusted his skin. A glance upwards showed damaged and cracked ceiling tiles, which created the shivering draft. From the small man’s form came the keening sound of an omega in fear.  The sound tugged at his alpha instincts it was only past experience that stopped him from rushing to the unknown omega's side. Instead he took a calm step forward. “I won’t hurt you, can you tell me your name?” Slowly he walked towards the lone figure, hands up in an attempt to show he was no threat. The omega shifted and twisted at the sound of his voice, squeezing himself tighter into the corner of the wall he hid against.
Mud squelched under his boots as he paused to eye the monolithic brick building in front of him. He faced the back end, so there was no knowing, as of yet, what the front looked like. From the location he could see it was wrapped by a corroded chain-link fence, which seemed to be in place to stop the general public from getting to close. The buildings on either side were also vacant, looming in a protective square around the lot. He’d give it a five-star rating as far as villainous headquarters went, even the light seemed dimmer here, the clouds rolling to cover the sky in zealous swaths.
On his longer legs, Sherlock quickly caught up, reaching out with his good hand. He wrapped it around John's neck and yanked the other man against the wall. John laughed loud and clear as he followed Sherlock's demands, dropping back to throw one leg over Sherlock's hips, bracing himself against the wall and Sherlock.
Yet he did help. Every morning for the next five days, he drove to Baker Street to pick up John, and they went out hunting for clues. And while Mycroft was second best to John’s wayward alpha, he kept John just a little more grounded. It felt less like he was jumping into the frying pan every time he left 221B, and he found himself able to think past the overwhelming panic that losing Sherlock had created.
Ugh, it took a whole day to edit this thing. My mind is molasses.
At his chair, Mycroft seemed to dwell on John's question. His eyes studying the omega with no small amount of consideration. Finally, he sighed, leaning heavily on the arm of his chair and turning his head so his eyes didn't meet John's. His features were unreadable, as always.
John rolled his eyes, laughing and slapping at Sherlock's shoulder. "Don't be daft."
It was maddening! He was supposed to have been there
"Yeah, call an ambulance. I'm staying," Sherlock ordered, wrapping his arms around his chest. John or no John, his protective instinct wouldn't let him leave the omega alone.
The sound of moans and cries had his mind struggling back from its drug-addled haze. The scent even more so, an overwhelming smog of fear and death mixed with malaise and infection. He struggled to open his eyes, squinting through the slits of his eyelids to get his bearings. He was being dragged through a narrow corridor, on either side of him were large glass…tanks? Sherlock blinked, attempting to get his eyes to focus, the flop of his curled hair hiding his questing eyes from view.
“I’m an army man darling. But of course, you’re a romantic, shall I call it ‘making love’?” John questioned from Sherlock's room, his voice dropping down an octave as Sherlock stepped into the room. Sherlock stopped at the doorway, hip cocking against the wood frame, as he sucked in a breath of appreciation at the sight that waited for him. The shirt in his hand dropped to the floor in a spill of expensive silk.
Sherlock didn't mind, though, not now and most certainly not last night. Instead, he eyed John like he was one of his cases, something worthy of capturing all of his attention, a puzzle to be appreciated and examined. The heady scent of arousal tinged the air with the smell of thunder and cut grass, that, combined with Sherlock’s natural petrichor scent, made John feel as though he was in the middle of a storm.
It was a phrase ridiculously sentimental to the core. He was certain Mycroft would have a conniption at the very thought of him saying it aloud.
“That would be the two incompetent idiots Shirley enjoys discussing?” Mycroft crossed his arms. Honestly, he was aware the two detectives were above par compared to the rest of New Scotland Yard, they did their job well. It was hardly their fault that anyone would look like an idiot next to his brother. That was not the point, Lestrade was one of the only men he could trust, he would prefer all evidence be handled by the alpha.
The sound of the gun cocking echoed in the icy air. Sherlock didn't have but a moment to react, jerking back as the trigger was pulled. A sharp lance of pain jolted from his hand, the graze of the bullet to close for comfort as it slammed into the wall with a puff of dust. Sherlock jerked back behind the door, dropping into a crouch and cursing under his breath. Inside he could hear the omega scrambling around, looking for a way out perhaps.
The smell of lavender grew stronger as the younger of the two beta's moved in close, kicking at his shoe.
"Christ woman, take care. What happened to that damn oath you lot follow, do no harm!?" Sherlock squawked. Colt snickered from his place somewhere to the left of Tabitha's bag.
It didn't last long. The scent of pleased, comfortable omega lingered in Sherlock's nose, urging him forward. Sherlock crawled onto the bed, spreading John's legs and blanketing himself on top of the omega until they lined up hip to hip. They both gasped, eyes locking, as cock brushed against achingly hard cock. He dropped immediately to John's lips. Using his teeth to nibble along John's lower lip with aching slowness until the omega opened his mouth with a throaty groan and let Sherlock in.
"Like I'm one of your experiments or something. What part of my anatomy are you thinking about right now?" John mumbled drowsily, humming happily and nuzzling into Sherlock's neck, his legs and arms doing a good job of helping Sherlock tangle them together.
Stepping out into the hall, he felt John's eyes lingering on his bare backside as he headed to the linen closet and snatched up a couple of washcloths. He warmed one with heated water from the tap, glancing up into the mirror as he worked. His face was lit with a happy, content smile, all that earlier fear chased away. This was good, more than good.
John's hand slid down the lemonade bottle, desperately searching for something to hold onto – the edge of the work-surface was good enough, giving him something to lean on...
John gritted his teeth slightly. "Right. Fine. My point is that most people are too busy focusing on themselves or what's going on around them to really
"I'm not going to kiss him," John said patiently, forcing his eyes open as the unbidden image of Sherlock leaning down with impossible speed towards him flooded his brain, "and I'm not going to tell him I love him. With a red rose."
"Yeah? Well tell me this, little bro, does he make you smile?"
"Oh, come on, it's written all over your face." Sherlock knew that he was being irrational. Of course, that didn't mean he could necessarily stop. "You realised that it was going too far and it's brought you back to reality."
here.
"...yes."
He shook his head, irritated at the way his head was making things seem. He tapped out a reply perhaps a little harder than he should have:
Not looking wholly pleased with his answer, Wanda turned to stand beside him and gazed up at the house, pursing her lips. "Hmm. I'm not sure. Probably better to ask Tim – Tim!" Her husband was slowly making his way around to the other side of the car, handing his keys to the smiling valet. "Do you know how many bedrooms Brooke and Benedict have in this monstrosity?"
"I think it's fantastic," Wanda said warmly, eyes flashing up to offer him her trademark smile, "to be willing to put in the work for such a worthwhile career. Your parents must be very proud."
be a but of an over-exaggeration, Sherlock. It's not like they're sticking their tongues down each others throa-"
"I would prefer to play for an audience who is actually desirous to hear it rather than one who is asking out of good manners."
The man called Lewis walked towards him. "Ah, he's a nice one, Shez. Follows orders. I can see why you like 'im." In the dim light John could just about make out a round, craggy face, scars marring what looked to be at least half of his left cheek. Adrenaline helping along nicely, John's mind quickly processed 'Shezza', 'Shez' and the disturbingly Mycroftesque comment on his ability to follow orders; his jaw clenched again, though he was unsure whether it was to stop him from laughing or stop him from denying his willingness. "Didn't know you 'ad a boyfriend."
The genius took a small step towards the bed before hesitating. "You... you do mean now, don't you?"
"I assume a 'drink' is equal to a sip?" Sherlock asked no one in particular, picking up his glass, looking infinitely bored. "Very well, if I must..." He took the tiniest sip, grimacing as he did so.
The tiny, dangerous grin flickered to life once more as Sherlock glanced away and to the cards in front of them, calm, serene even. When he spoke, it was in his normal voice once more, loud enough for everyone else to hear.
John's eyes rolled of their own accord. "All right, calm down. Yes, there was a ball and, no, we didn't kiss
"He..." Greg sighed, suddenly looking as exhausted as John felt. "He's a bastard. If he'd just told you what I'd actually said none of this would have even happened and he -"
Fingers were suddenly briefly touching his wrist, warm and hesitant - he jerked roughly out of his head and found John standing directly in front of him, a look of concern worrying the edges of his lips; he felt his heart jump erratically to find John this close. "Ah."
"I don't," he continued to deny, shaking his head back and forth as he once again wished he'd just hung up and let them have sex, "I don't love Sherlock, I
"Nonsense, you're a village celebrity!" Whatever they were talking about it was clear that Wanda Holmes was not going to let it go without a fight. "They were
Nina was talking. "…twelve in the afternoon. Does that suit you?"
John grinned back, almost embarrassingly thrilled to be a part of their banter again. "Noted."
John put both of his hands out in the same gesture, shaking his head equally as hard. "Yeah, Greg, you know we're not
"Might regret that," the man said with a grin, instantly reaching out and grabbing a bottle of something green and inexplicably bright. "Have some of this with lemonade – it'll knock your
"Not that you two have to stay with us," Wanda interrupted, her eyes flitting between John and Sherlock with a familiar flame of determination within her pale eyes, "you can go about and do as you like, we won't mind."
A small breath of air left Sherlock. "Then... do you think that perhaps we shouldn't try?"
. If you refuse the dare now -" He hesitated for a moment, for the first time looking as if he wasn't too sure, " - well, this is Lauren's addendum, not mine, trust me on that...
“I was fifteen when I was first introduced to drugs. I was at boarding school, one where the mere mention of drugs was to bring shame on your entire family and so, in the end, it should have been a difficult process. It shouldn’t have been possible. But, needless to say, it was.
John paused in his lifting the glass to his lips. "Mm?"
"Well, there's no need to be coarse." The slamming of a car door, the rumble of an engine. "But I suppose I may as well bite; do you return his feelings, or hope to?"
Okay, I need your opinion guys! First of all, this is how I imagine John to be (and was one of the youngest looking pictures I could find:)
There was no response.
Sherlock's deep voice broke through his reverie like hot water; almost as if his vocal chords had unlocked, John's voice burst out into the darkness with words he had actually not been thinking at all:
Colt grunted, a man of many words. Sherlock didn't have the energy to think about these new developments, on being a guinea pig, or a lab result, or the fact that he was currently a hostage. Instead, he was fading rapidly into the shock Tabitha had been speaking of.
He could get used to this. John, bare, and undone, and so damn beautiful.
Eddington browsed through the photos. "Eh…looks a bit morbid with all the blood and such, but that'll do for a ransom shot." He declared. "You have Mycroft's number, I assume?"
Warnings for grief, eating problems, and Mycroft being a total dick.
“Why are you keeping me out of the loop? I can help.” John felt his voice break and attempted to take in a deep calming breath. “Please, Mycroft, I need something.” He hated the note of pleading in his tone, hated to beg, but he’d been scrambling for months, trying to find some connection, some clue as to Sherlock’s whereabouts. “All you will tell me is that you have it handled, but you don’t; if you did, I would have him back by now!”
By the time the omegas were cleared out, the rain had all but disappeared, leaving behind puddles and grease-stained asphalt. Lestrade, grim-faced and glowering, waved him over.
It's a rather pithy concept, but wouldn't be the most surprising motivation Sherlock has over heard of. And the man does smell something awful. Most beta's have a calming, half present scent, not this man. It's
“Well, whatever the reason, I'm offering you the chance to attempt to explain and – as we both know – oftentimes it makes it markedly easier to analyse and deconstruct ones difficulties in understanding something by voicing the matter at hand
He was also in his pyjamas. As was John. As it turned out, John's pyjamas consisted of a plain white t-shirt and boxer shorts. Sherlock wasn't wearing underwear.
“It’s quite funny, really - well, not funny. Doesn’t exactly make me want to laugh.”
God, he sounded so eager. John leaned his forehead against the heel of his hand, dreading what was to come next. "Yeah, about that... I've got such a lot on at the moment, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it."
"When you're the one he's having these feelings for? Don't think so. You know him better than that. He must be going fucking mad with all these thoughts shooting around his head, you know how much he thinks and how fast his mind works. It must be crazy in there right now."
Giving a genuine smile, John found himself relaxing a little more into his chair. "Good."
“Liar.”
If you'll excuse me." The taller man sidestepped around John and brushed past Greg as if he weren't even there, his eyes completely devoid of anything as he made his way out of the room and towards the door; John began to follow, pushing past Greg perhaps a little harder than he needed to and reaching once again for him. "Sherlock, please -"
Slowly John lifted his hands to his face and dragged his palms across the warm skin, trying to ground himself enough that he wouldn't fly out of the door and go running off in any direction in order to bring his best friend safely home. "Are we over-reacting? It's not like he's completely unstable."
"Very funny," John muttered, lifting his glass of water and lemon to his lips and taking a sip. "Let's keep those sorts of comments for Mycroft and Greg, though I admire your dedication to method-acting."
Sherlock shut the book with a 'snap', throwing it down in front of him and placing both hands flat on top of it. "I don't know, isn't it the sort of thing friends know about each other? Favourite colours, siblings, childhood pets? I've known you for a significant amount of time now, John, and I don't know any of these things. So... I'm asking them. Colour? Sibling? Pet?"
Instantly his head shot up, bypassing the heads in the room and instinctively swivelling to look out of the window and into the garden – sure enough there was a tall, slender figure leaning against the fence, face turned towards him; their eyes met.
Glancing at his watch and squeezing his eyes tightly shut, he wondered to himself how much longer he could put off talking to Mike about the party that evening; he couldn't avoid it forever, especially as Mike had been so enthusiastic in his texts about him going. Though he'd managed his first set of classes for the first time in a while that very day, he was so exhausted from the sheer effort of leaving his room that he had a sneaking suspicion that even if he were to attend he would manage to stay for a maximum of ten minutes before begging off and leaving early.
John was completely flummoxed. "I don't understand, when you asked me… or when I asked myself,
"John!" She briefly hugged him, her arms light, nowhere near gripping him with the same ferocity as a certain maternal figure of the Holmes household – then again, the Watson's (compared to the Holmes family, with the exception of both Sherlock and Mycroft) weren't exactly a touchy-feely family. As a result John himself had always been rather proprietary when exuding affection of any kind, even with girlfriends only tending to touch them when they were kissing or engaging in a sexual act; perhaps from time to time he would kiss his mother on the cheek or rest his hand upon her arm for a moment, but that tended to be in extreme circumstances and if he felt that words would not do what he was trying to express any justice. To this end he had found it incredibly difficult to adjust to Wanda at first – her hugs, her casual squeezing of his shoulder as she passed by, the first time she had swooped down upon him to brush something out of his hair. Eventually it had become less uncomfortable, less surprising; he had learned to stop flinching, instead allowing it and letting the moment pass without feeling as if someone had invaded his personal space without his permission. He understood that she was simply somehow treating him as a member of her family, a surrogate son – he should be honoured by the affection, not offended.
With a slight shrug, Mycroft allowed a small smile. “Perhaps I'm simply curious. Educating myself, you could say.”
