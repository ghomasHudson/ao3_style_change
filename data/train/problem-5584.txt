Steve grabbed him by the shoulders and shook. “Just listen! I am apologizing because I was being a terrible friend. Friends do not say things like that to each other. And yes, I am your friend, Tony. Stop giving me that look. I know we argue all the time and fight too much, but I’d like to think we’re friends. If that’s okay with you?” He sent Tony an imploring look.
Tony gripped her hand. “It was-” He scrunched his face and looked at her. “It was crazy. I was being chased by something in the Tower, and something was wrong, and there was something about an elevator?” He looked down at their hands. “That’s so weird. I could clearly remember everything when I woke up, but now I barely remember any details.” He didn’t mention that even if he suddenly forgot what the dream was about, he still felt visceral fear just thinking about it. He smiled at her uncertainly.
He looked around again and shrugged. He faced the direction he thought they came from and started walking. It would probably be safer and smarter to stay in one place and wait for Steve to find him, but Tony was never good at sitting still. Besides, he was fairly confident he was heading in the right direction.
Steve ran back to where he left Tony and fell to his knees beside the prone man. “Tony?” He turned him onto his back and Tony threw himself at him.
He squeezed his eyes shut. “Of course you’re not working. Nothing’s working except the elevator, which I’m very glad for.” He patted the wall with a shaking hand. “Nothing else except the elevator is working and I’m being hunted down by something or other in my own home. Great.”
“Yeah, but you still thought and meant it.” Tony muttered to himself. He stared hard at the unchanging readings to avoid looking at Steve.
With renewed strength, he ripped the offending appendage away and rolled to safety. He retrieved his shield and hacked at the branch. It thrashed and jerked back.
Steve quirked a tired grin at him and set a steady hand on Tony’s shoulder. “We’ll tell you guys all about it. In the infirmary.”
If Tony had the energy to spare, he’d be indignant at the thought of Steve escorting him everywhere. The guy probably thought it was his sworn duty to help everyone, including spoilt billionaires with no sense of direction. Steve was just nice like that. Expected the best of himself and everyone around him. No wonder he always seemed disappointed or irritated by Tony. Understandable, really.
He unhooked the shield from its harness and hefted it in his hand. He cast his eyes about and strained his ears to hear more. Another creak, fainter but longer than the last. Steve advanced silently, grip tight on the leather of his shield straps. The cheese trail in front of him became uneven, spotty. The cheese seemed to be running out, and Steve hoped that Tony had enough left to complete the trail, wherever he was going. He refused to imagine Tony hurt and compromised, stumbling about in the fog with no way out. Tony was fine. Tony was smart and clever, and knew how to get himself out of difficult situations if he put his mind to it.
The swordsman didn’t even look at him. “You crawl across this earth like locusts!” With a quick, vicious movement, he stumbled to his feet and drew a sharp circle in the air.
Psychiatrist, social care worker, SVU investigator, whatever - someone who’d know what to do with him.
He had a whole list of things that T'Challa could have been calling about, alright. But this was nowhere near the top. Had Rogers told T'Challa to contact him? Did he even know that this was what T'Challa was doing? What the hell was Rogers doing out of Wakanda anyway? "...what?" he managed finally, sounding more bewildered than he'd like.
“That he has an army at his disposal,” Tony murmured back. “That the whole lot of them are as fanatical as he is.”
Because whatever else Captain America might have done, Tony had thought of Steve Rogers as his friend once. (Even if it had not been mutual.)
Hill made space for Barnes to slide in next to her, Barton rounding out the square beside Tony and Steve. She paused for a moment, and then a small smile quirked her lips. “Francis. It’s been a while.”
it was. Without oversight, all he had to rely on was his own judgement, and he knew what lay down that road. And Tony’s oversight figured people like Pepper, like Rhodey, like T’Challa - capable, thoughtful people, people used to wielding power for the greater good, who would think long and hard about whether something was acceptable or not. Ethical, moral people who could be trusted to make those choices.
“Look.” Barton folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. “You have to know that there’s no risk, right? M’Baku would never have agreed to anything that would put his people - or a child - in danger. The trail leads to an uninhabited peak a little way from here; there’s a million tunnels in there and we should be able to contain your swordsman when he turns up. You - and Steve - were never in any danger. We’d never do that.
“But… things are complicated. We’re not quite sure how to undo the magic on you and send you back that way. And if we do -“ He hesitated again.
“How’s it looking?” He asked Barton, yawning and inching into the cockpit to peer out of the window. Barnes was already awake and getting himself ready in the back compartment.
The flight back was seemingly endless, although Tony could not have recounted how he spent a minute of his time, merely that it had dragged through him in pained increments. He had sharp shooting pains up both arms by the time they landed, as if by clenching his fists sufficiently hard he could pause time and keep Steve safe until his return. Steve was hurt. Steve was
“Well, he was right on the money on that front, but no, I’d already figured it out.” M’Baku’s comments had been the final bit of evidence, but he’d had quite a bit of the information laid out for him already. The others, ridiculously visible in Burkina Faso, almost jumping up and down yelling
He stared back at her for a long moment. “No, Agent Hill,” he said quietly, venomously, “no, I don’t need to ask that.”
Barnes didn’t really count - Tony trusted him about as far as he could throw the quinjet - and Barton was… well, things were still complicated with Barton. He wished that Rhodey could be there, or Pepper. He wished that he had someone he could discuss this with who wouldn’t have a personal stake in the answer falling one way or the other.
He was on his feet without remembering how he got there, and he was looking for the source of the voice. That voice… it was a threat, somehow. He had to… he had to…
In the hologram space, the arm schematic overlaps with the brace schematic and they tangle, helplessly.
He’d put them on all by himself, Tony realised belatedly. For all that Tony had been in charge of him, for the most part Steve hadn’t needed Tony for much other than getting him to safety and occasionally calming him down when he had a nightmare or anxiety attack. The nurses had dealt with the health aspects, and for everything else, Steve was a remarkably self-sufficient child.
The Stark Industries facility was heralded by retinal scans and voice-prints, which made Tony briefly wide-eyed with panic before he remembered that Pepper would have sorted all of that out for them in advance. In any case, only the adults were required to be passed through; Steve slept through the whole thing. Once inside, they pretty much had the run of the place, although obviously any secure areas such as the residences or the R&D labs had additional security in place.
They watched the children in silence for a little while. After a moment, Tony became aware of another presence and looked up, surprised. “What are you doing here?” He hadn’t noticed anyone else headed this way.
That was a bit surprising. Clearly someone had managed to get him changed out of the grotty pajamas he’d had on the call with Tony, and had given him a bath. But why was he wearing Tony’s T-shirt? He had plenty of other pajamas. Had Steve asked for it, or had one of the others offered? It didn’t seem like the sort of thing that either Vision or Natasha would have known to do. (Tony’s mom had done that for him when he wouldn’t quieten down.
“Oh, I do want to,” Steve said, his eyes wide, his words coming in a torrent, as if he couldn’t - quite - keep them all back. “I really tried, I swear I did, I tried really hard! But I
. I was worried he’d have to sedate him. Seemed to think you were a gonner, no matter how many times we tried to reassure him.” Barton bit his lip. “Before the med team arrived, before we could get you under, you were panicked, moving around a lot. We needed to restrain you to stop you from injuring yourself, and we couldn’t risk sedation with surgery looming. So Barnes and I were holding you down until they could get some restraints set up, and - you didn’t react well to that, or to the restraints -“ Barton’s lips were thin and white, his hand trembling as he rubbed slowly at his jaw.
They finally landed a little after 4pm the following day - although it was very much 6am where Tony’s sleep-deprived body was concerned - at the private airfield Tony customarily used for his red-eye commute.
“Yeah, but Wanda and Barnes are also here, so…” Barton shrugged. “The others don’t need me right now, they have it in hand. Dr Foster has a theory and we’re waiting to see if it pans out; there’s a whole lot of waiting until then. And I figured the two of you needed a friendly face.”
Tony nodded. “There you go. You hold on to Vision’s hand, OK? He’ll look after you until I come back.”
Another shrug. “I woke up in clothes that were a lot bigger than me. And - I wasn’t lying, before. I saw the b-bodies.” He breathed sharply as he said the word, almost hiccuping. “They looked like - like they were bigger, before, before they -”
“Is Rhodey OK?” he asked urgently. Why hadn’t Barton said anything? Christ, if he hadn’t said anything, that meant - “Rhodey, what happened to him -” He tried to push himself out of bed. His arms wouldn’t hold his weight, and his stomach dropped out from under him.
to social services and let them place him with strangers. (Because the one man who might place the child’s safety above the world’s was the one man that Tony didn’t trust around a helpless child,
Pepper had previously floated the idea of having the sub look at not-for-profit status, or possibly registering the whole kit and caboodle overseas as pocket subs scattered in key jurisdictions. That way, it wouldn’t be a case of American private actors rocking up on Mali’s doorstep - for instance - but would be more aligned with how NGOs such as the Red Cross operated. The alternative was to link it to the UN as an independent but quasi-aligned agency; this would have given them diplomatic immunity, access to pretty much everywhere, and would have been a totally awesome idea except for the whole Accords issue dropping into their laps at about the same time.
The walk across the Bashenga Ward and through to the Outpatients Clinic was a pleasant one, through a little courtyard with a small fountain and benches positioned around it. The location was carefully thought out, the tall building the courtyard bordered giving it shade from the strong tropical sun and sheltering it from the stiff breeze that whistled overhead.
So, that was it - Barton had put the two of them in touch, presumably around the time he’d gone to ground. “You did good.” Tony watched Steve sleeping, the gentle rise and fall of his chest.
Tony had not stopped weapons manufacturing because he had stopped believing in weapons. He had merely stopped believing in the effectiveness of the safeguards of the system. He would make the suits, and he would re-design the helicarriers, and he would make Barton better arrows, and Romanoff more effective electroshock bracelets, and he had not deluded himself that he was doing this because they could not be misused. All he had thought was,
It hurt, somehow. There wasn’t enough room in his head for everything, as if his skull had shrunk, or maybe his brain had swelled full of too many thoughts. It certainly felt like he had too much in there, too much presence for a single mind.
“I’ll check in with my contacts once I’m back in the US,” Tony said. “The residual radiation bears some resemblance to an Einstein-Rosen bridge, so Jane Foster may be useful here. I’ll talk to Hill, she has some pull with Dr Foster, she might be able to get her on board.”
He quirks his very best ‘I’m a bigger asshole than you’ smile. “One billion dollars. Half in advance, half on completion.”
The grey recedes a little, his vision creeping back in tiny increments. His grip on the worktop loosens. He can do this.
He put Steve back down to re-attach the boot and showed him how it joined back to the leg. “There, that’s all fixed, now.”
The door crashed open, Okoye and half a dozen similarly-uniformed women running in, Barnes and Maximoff hot on their heels. Maximoff’s eyes were glowing red.
- work together. All they’d have to do, is be able to turn their back and trust that there wouldn’t be a knife in it.
“So.” A couple of hours later Barton sat down next to Tony and looked across at where Steve was still sleeping quietly. It was an hour or so until dawn; not that they’d be seeing the sun, of course. But the artificial lighting would brighten automatically then to simulate it. That was, if D'Artagnan didn't choose this time to launch his big attack follow-up. “Was the big confab everything you dreamed it would be?”
“No. Well - his albuterol. But nothing to make him sleep. His breathing’s too tight for that. Anyway, this isn’t unusual for him, he sleeps a lot.” Tony had wondered about it a couple of times, but Steve had had so much disruption and trauma in his relatively short time with them that if the kid wanted to hibernated he wasn’t going to argue. There was nothing medically wrong with him - other than his lungs - and the Wakandan doctors had thought him well enough to stay outside the hospital. Tony was admittedly not going to feel settled about it until he had the opinion of his own doctor, Pepper, Rhodey’s mom and possibly a signed note from God, but he wasn’t about to make any of that public. “The doctors said it was normal.”
I've written other stories centred on Rhodey's injuries so I won't go into it all here again, but I can't imagine the
Barton shrugged. “The others are already tracking down all the available leads. Well, OK, in between helping out where needed - there’s this thing in northern Burkina Faso, near Gorom-Gorom, and - Anyway, neither one of you is in any fit state to defend yourselves, so…”
Rhodey eased himself back down for a minute, then back up again. “Yeah, that’s… thanks, that’s better.” He sounded surprised. (He still hadn’t turned to face Tony.)
Steve didn’t seem to hear him, finally letting go of the death-grip he had on his ribs to worm his cold hands around Tony’s neck instead, letting his head fall on Tony’s shoulder.
She shook her head, a small smile on her lips. “You’ll like this.” She pointed to the screen Wanda was sat in front of, which had a split-screen of the swordsman’s wrists, the bracelets still crackling with power. “Wanda?”
the Steve in Tony’s head said, and he was on the sofa in Stark Tower, and he was facing down the Chitauri, and he was in Siberia, and he was smashing his shield into Tony’s chest,
“Identify entries with all of the following keywords: ‘Tony’, ‘Bucky’, ‘Siberia’.” Four entries lit up. Tony stared at them for a long moment. The first was about a week after Siberia, near the start of the audio record. The other three came up a few days later. After a moment, he cleared his throat. “Remove keyword, ‘Siberia’.” Six more entries lit up, flashing
(This was probably not the place to snuff it. But maybe Okoye had trusted this guy for a reason; maybe he’d be able to protect Steve. That was the priority.)
T’Challa was waiting for them when they get back, his expression grim. There was a full medical team arrayed behind him - two gurneys, four nurses, and two doctors in medical smocks bearing the crest of Royal Hospital Birnin Zana - which immediately converged on Tony and Steve the moment they had disembarked, Barton and Romanoff bringing up the rear.
(He’d like to think that he hadn’t judged the others a threat, that he hadn’t put Peter in any danger, but he knows better. Wanda had been there, and Barnes. There was no way to explain that away.) That they’d both come away relatively unharmed was more luck than design.
“I rather think if you are desperate enough to come to Hong Kong from - Wakanda, is it?” She waved a hand apologetically at Okoye, who was still in her Dora uniform. “Yes - if you are desperate enough to come to Hong Kong to simply ask for a reference, you have acknowledged that you need his expertise.” Her smile twisted. “Mordo is… very capable. We do not agree on many things, but he will not steer you wrong when it counts.”
If you think I went through six drafts of this and am still not happy with the result, you'd be right. I think I got through close to 20k words to finally reach these 4k. Anyway, I'm moving the goalposts to claiming victory through posting it at all.
Tony looked back to see Steve peeping over the raised arm of the suit, his eyes wide. “I’m making a warm place. We’re going to have to wait for our lift back, and it will take a little while. So I’m just… making a warm place.”
“Is it a safe dosage for someone his age?” Tony asked, suddenly anxious. “I thought you weren’t supposed to give the adult stuff to kids.” He’d read that somewhere. Hadn’t he? Wouldn’t Barton know this stuff? He’d managed to raise three kids, surely that meant he knew what he was doing...
“Ow, quit it!” Rhodey pinched at his fingers, hurriedly grabbing the wheels and positioning himself out of reach. “You - you really have to stop doing that,” he said. His voice sounded oddly strained.
Well, he’d trusted Pepper on this so far and she hadn’t steered him wrong. Smile and offer cooperation, and then stall at every opportunity. The Accords weren’t going anywhere - especially not with 117 countries signed up to them - but a signature wasn’t ratification. And there was many a slip ‘twixt the cup and the lip, as the saying went. The Accords would hold, at least for the time being. Ross would hold. Even - God help him - Richard Smith would have to hold, probably frothing at the insult.
He rubbed at his face tiredly. He’d half-known what she was going to say; for all her cynicism, Nat had an annoying habit of expecting the best of them.
The look on Tony’s face did not seem to be reassuring; Barton frowned, expression growing more pinched, and looked away.
Tony's mouth was moving without any input from his brain. “Okay, how do you even -” he pointed an accusing finger. “Why is this a pop culture reference you’re familiar with? I was stuck with Captain
She nodded. “We’ll check just the same. And if you come with us as well…” She took hold of his arm and gently led him to the gurneys. “We can check on you while you keep him company, yes? Just to make sure you’re alright.”
Tony had been somewhat preoccupied at the time, what with the Accords and BARF and… everything. “What attacks?”
meant someone would observe Tony doing every single a human could be reasonably expected to do - three times - and would give him a pass/fail for complex tasks such as tying his shoelaces and spelling
“Should I ask for a poison taster?” Tony said, then immediately regretted it when Rhodey looked at him, his smile dropping. “Sorry. Habit.” He’d have to watch that. He didn’t know or especially like Wilson, but if he was in Rhodey’s life now… he’d have to figure things out.
He wonders what Peter would say if he finds out his mentor and teacher, Tony Carbonell, is actually Tony Stark. He would probably die, if his frequent monologues about how
“I love you,” Tony says quietly, because he has been afraid of saying it for so long, and now he can say it without any of the fear, or less of it at least, so he's just making up for lost time.
It’s good, he thinks, even as the expensive whiskey burns slightly. It’s good, because he can hold his alcohol well, but he needs
Tony smirks, sliding the money across the counter to him, along with a small piece of paper. His handwriting is neat, so unlike Steve’s own slanted mess.
But he's not fine. Or at least he wasn't. He thinks about the shouting they’d both done, Ty, Obadiah, Howard, the rain, everything that he had told Steve. He thinks about the weight that seems to have… not vanished. But lessened. He can breathe easily now.
He pulls him closer, hands coming up to cup his face, and he just touches him because he can, dragging a thumb along the curve of his cheekbones, memorising every line of his face with his fingers, and then with his lips.
Tony laughs quietly, loosening his hold on Steve’s hand. But he only grips tighter, his smile open and honest.
.” He sounds pissed, but not angry. “Listen to me. I need you to stay away from Obie. Yeah, I know what I sounds like, but I’m looking into something- yeah of course it’s dangerous. Just stay away from him if you can, and clear my schedule for the next two days. Then stay put. I need you to hold down the fort for the next few hours.” A beat. “Just try Pep. Thanks, I have to go. Bye.”
advanced. Especially as he’s always had problems with keeping his mouth shut around everyone other than his father. “No.” He finishes, anger coiling in his stomach, making him feel sick. It’s a game with Obie, always a power play. “Apologies.”
Howard had protested, his mother had cried, but surprisingly, Obie had taken his side, had said that he needed some space. It was one of the only things they had ever actually agreed on, and Tony had been grateful, is still grateful, though he suspects Obie has spies in the apartment block he lives in too.
Minutes later, Tony has put Steve's number into his phone, and he’s feeling lighter than he has since moving out when he was 15.
He closes his eyes, giving himself three seconds to pull it together. Get through the day, then call Rhodey, then go and get a drink.
of the apartment. Tony swallows, takes a breath in. Steve sees his hands before he tucks them into his pockets. They’re shaking badly.
Steve steps back, letting him get back into his room. Tony hears him go into the kitchen a minute later. He feels like he needs to take a shower. Three showers, and then another. When he pulls his shirt off, there are twin bruises on his hips. There’s a faint memory somewhere, a memory of someone gripping too hard. The rest is logic.
Obie laughs, flinging an arm around his shoulders and Tony forces himself to lean into it, to relax, to laugh with him.
“I’m not going to run.” Steve says softly, fingers carding through his hair. “I haven’t before, I won’t now. Do what you have to do, and I’m going to be there, every step of the way.”
“Steve?” Tony's voice is tinged with worry now, and god he doesn’t want to worry him, that’s the last thing he's
But they’re in public, however alone they may be right now. All it takes is one picture, one sighting, and then it’s an article, a video, then Obie will call, then his mother will call, and then and then and then.
“I have to go,” Rhodey says, and he sounds sad. His fault. It’s Tony’s fault that he sounds sad. “Call me if you need anything, promise?”
The energy around them is amazing, and so, so alive. There must be thousands of people in the square, despite the freezing weather.
Somehow, by some miracle, he manages to get Tony out of the hotel and into the car, pulling him into the backseat.
Fury rolls his eyes. “I’m sure I have. Let me know if you’re ever looking to go into my line of work Stark, we could do with someone like you on the team.”
“Drop it Maria,” says Howard, and there’s enough bite in his tone that Tony’s stomach lurches. His father is drunk, or has at least drunk enough to crack the composure a bit. He shifts closer to his mother, and instantly knows it's the wrong decision, because Howard’s eyes darken slightly.
As they make their way out of the tiny apartment, Steve considers leaving his phone behind. What good will it do anyway, apart from sending him right back to square one of this new fixation.
He doesn’t bother locking the door when he goes into his room. It’s not like Obie and Howard don’t have keys to it anyway. His brain works on autopilot as he changes, getting ready for bed.
If he tells it first, he doesn’t have to hear it. He can take it, god knows he takes it enough from Obie, from Howard, and from the rest of the world.
He lets out a laugh, shaking his head and hitting her gently on the shoulder as Clint grins, throwing his apron at him. He manages to catch it before it hits him in the face, and he’s grateful for that because he really doesn’t need to go any
He knows because when Tony had woken up alone in Ty’s hotel bed three years ago, he had called Rhodey first. It had been the first time he’d broken down in front of his friend, first time he’d reached out to him for help. Rhodey had come, and Tony had never really forgotten the look on his face when he had seen him. He had been convinced there and then that his friend was going to find Ty and kill him. He hadn’t, but if Ty had been there-
A hand taps the counter in front of him and a voice reaches his ears, low and smooth, snapping him out of his haze.
When Tony’s hands move down to his waist, fingers trailing across his chest, Steve stills for a second.
is not something he gets often. Like he doesn’t deserve it. He looks so young in the moment, and Steve feels his heart in his throat.
So Steve had given him the space to breathe, and a week later, there had been a knock at his door. He lets his mind wander back to the feeling of relief he'd felt when Tony had turned up at his apartment.
Also, Tony had mentioned something about a movie night. So his motivation to get to class and then get
“Tony.” Nat says quietly, warning low in her voice. He glances at her once, and there’s something in her gaze that makes him pause with a frown.
“Remind me why you like this place?” That’s Obie, his voice low and mocking. For a second, Tony’s anger is stronger than any other emotion, but he doesn’t speak. “You need to change up your coffee shops apparently.”
everything hurts, and he was so fucking stupid to think that he could be selfish with Steve, that he could have one thing to himself.
“Yeah, he’s a genius honestly. I took him on as a temporary intern, he reminds me of myself in college.”
For a second, there’s nothing but shocked silence. Tony has always been sarcastic with Obie, to a point. But he’s never said no with so little hesitation, not like this.
“Yes actually. Go and play nice with Ty Stone. His father is hours away from agreeing to a business deal, and I need them on side.”
“Me, if you want to be dramatic about it. Or dum-e, if you want to blame a robot for the entire thing.”
“I love you.” Steve says, leaning in again. Tony’s lips are warm despite the cold air, and he wants to stay here forever. “Thank you so much for this.”
They sit in silence for a while, and Tony marvels at the way the light catches the water. It really is beautiful, beautiful in an untouchable way.
Steve sighs, leaning into the touch. He can feel an ache in his bones, but there’s no IV, which is a good sign at least.
“So much. Too much. It scares me, and I’m scared of getting hurt, but I can’t walk away. I haven’t ever been able to walk away from you.”
“Yeah no shit.” His friend sighs, glancing at Ty before looking back to Tony. “I’m just worried about you.”
His father takes a step towards him, and he’s going to be sick, he’s going to throw up or his heart is going to burst out of his chest-
Another laugh, and Steve wonders how exactly he has ended up on a date with someone who has a laugh like this. A laugh that makes him feel an unfamiliar mix of proud and awed, and all he wants to do is make him laugh again.
He’s not- he’s not really sure what to say to that, not sure how to react to the knowledge that SHIELD’s most skilled agent is
He leaves soon after that, because something is aching in his chest, and he’s blinking harder than before. He misses her. He misses her. He misses her.
“If you’re going to ask me about the alcohol, or the slut thing, or the continuous public fuck ups, maybe wait until I’m on my third drink.”
hesitates to argue with. He just wants- he wants to tell him, and he wants Steve to protect him from it all. But how far does protection go when its from two of the most powerful men in the country.
He holds her gaze for a long time, and she holds it right back, unflinchingly. Seconds pass, and then Tony shakes his head, breaking eye contact and glancing away. “Fine, whatever. I’m not having this conversation with you in the middle of an alleyway. I’m guessing you’re not offering me a ride back to SHIELD?”
Tony’s lips quirk into a smile, the gentle amusement back. Everything seems to make Tony smile or laugh, whether that’s a new invention, one of Rhodey’s jokes, or Steve. He always seems to have that look of soft, almost contemplative amusement on his features when he looks at Steve, like he knows he’s supposed to be smiling, but can’t quite work out why.
He remembers the man who had walked into the coffee shop, had made Tony look so uncomfortable, had looked at Steve with such empty, emotionless eyes.
“Be quick,” Obadiah says, and then pulls out his phone, a clear dismissal. Swallowing the mix of anger and nausea, Tony walks inside, sliding his hands into his pockets.
“Uh huh,” Steve mumbled, cuddling into Tony’s chest. “But I’m tired now. Can we go home?” He reached up with sticky fingers to hold on to the edge of the suit’s collar, his head on Tony’s chest, lit up in blue by the glow of the arc reactor.
And that, it appeared, was that. T’Challa left, taking the scary general away with him, Barnes following with Maximoff at his heels. Presumably they’d be in contact later to arrange - oh
Was that why there was always someone with him, now? Why Romanoff had tried so hard to make him remember the older Steve, to think about him, to put
Cutting it close, evidently, as he put his body between Tony and the swordsman, and bore the latter backwards. He managed to sweep the guy’s legs out with a move that Tony wasn’t sure was physically possible, and pressed him down into the floor, trying to immobilise him. He had his flesh hand on the swordsman's throat, and his metal one on the wrist of the hand with the glowy shield. “Hurry up,” he hissed, trying to force the swordsman to stay still.
But Mordo hadn’t known they’d been aware of that little factoid, had he? That was surprise in his face. So what did that tell them?
“Oh,” Hill said, her lip curling in what might have been mistaken for a smile if Tony didn’t know enough to be fucking terrified. “I told him.”
Dhakiya excused herself after Tony and Rhodey had lunch delivered; evidently her babysitting duties did not extend to taking her meals with them. It was either that, or she had better things to do, which was clearly crazy talk. Tony had
No, Tony wasn’t father material. (No matter if he might have - once - wished otherwise.) It was probably for the best. Who’d trust him to raise a child, anyway? He smoothed Steve’s hair back from his face, smiling at the instinctive squirmy wriggle this prompted. “He’s not mine.”
Tony watched him go, noting the line of Barton’s shoulders and the slight stagger in his step. He’d been in a fight himself, he realised. The black eye, the stiffness in his movements… they must have run into some trouble out there before they’d been called back. He still didn't know what they'd found, where everyone was. Why hadn’t Barton gotten his injuries seen to? If the Wakandan medics could carry out keyhole neurosurgery in a fucking
When she smiled, it rather reminded Tony of a shark scenting prey. He wondered, suddenly, if she was as young as she appeared, or whether that, too, was another feint.
Maybe Barton was sticking around because he wanted to check that Steve was OK. Maybe he wanted to talk to Tony. Or maybe he just needed someone he didn’t need to smile for, just for a little while longer, before he went to his room and called his kids.
“Peachy. Glad you found time for the important things,” he said, his voice cold. Rhodey’s grip on his knee increased - in warning? In support?
A quick investigation of the supply pallets he’d passed on his way in through the base revealed cold weather survival kits clearly pilfered from UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (they even had the “funded by…” logos, including Stark Industries for one set - they must have been routed through the relief organisation). Survival blanket, one-size-fits-all blanket, a LifeStraw and Plumpy’nut packages. He grimaced at the latter but collected a stack of them, figuring that the kid could probably do with the emergency nutrition. Come to think of it, the adult Steve Rogers would have found the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food offerings a blessing in disguise; he’d always complained how he couldn’t get enough food post-battle. They’d tried nutrition bars (mostly sugar), protein shakes (impractical, and who the hell had the space to carry them around?) and even baby food (just… no); in the end they’d opted to follow up missions with a trip down to the nearest open restaurant. But something like the RUTFs could probably fill that niche, and get them stable enough to get back to base immediately after alien battles or similar.
“Sure,” Tony said, lying and not feeling even a little guilty about it. He had the kid, the magic de-aging doohikey, Rhodey’s treatment, his own R&D backlog, trying to get access to whoever had thought building Barnes a new murder-arm was a good idea… phone calls home were not gonna be top of the priority list. “Once a week, scout’s honour. Sorry again for waking you guys, go back to bed now, night night!”
“It’s just to keep you warm, okay? You need to trust me on this, we don’t want your toes falling off or anything. I don’t think I’d be able to explain turning up with you missing any digits.” He eyed the discarded uniform pants. He could probably tie them off at the knees or something, and clip them around the kid to keep them on. They’d help to preserve the heat a little, and would also give him something in the way of footwear (the boots were, of course, far too big to be of any use). But he needed to warm him up first, or there would be no temperature to preserve.
Mordo laughed, surprised. “Oh, no, Mr Stark.” He shook his head, wry amusement still clearly visible. “
- which meant that he’d be fine to be around the kid for the most part. T’Challa had also provided the services of a couple of the Dora Milaje - who were
His brains really must have been scrambled if he was this slow on the uptake. He remembered Maximoff and Barnes from his dreams, sort of - remembered trying to get away from them, anyway - and having a whole bunch of strangers around probably wouldn't have helped. With Rhodey still back at Birnin Zana, that left precious few people his brain wouldn’t count as a threat.
Barnes lay crumpled in the walkway, clearly having jumped out of his seat but managed no farther. His metal arm, black metal gleaming, was outstretched, his flesh arm folded awkwardly beneath his twisted body. He, too, was breathing.
the small part of Tony still endlessly impressed with the Wakandan tech noted. He was still trying to get to his feet, his ears ringing and his vision blurring. The fucker had managed to get a few good hits in there, and in between his bruised chest and his ringing ears, even the suit didn’t seem enough to keep him upright.
And Tony had fallen for it, of course; hell, he’d done half of it himself in rifling through the tagging. What’s to say that the first few times his name came up weren’t iterations of
2) Ross was only recently injured in the film, and they were able to operate immediately. Whereas Rhodey has had several weeks of his injury, and the damage would therefore be more permanent. Not to say that they can't help, and they will, at least a little, but it's not a magical "oh, and he's healed!" moment.
He marched out, barely able to keep a hold of his temper until he made it back inside the control room. “Goddamnit!” He slammed his fist into the table. Predictably, it buckled under the force of a gauntleted blow.
T’Challa was inside the containment cell. This did not strike Tony as the greatest plan ever. “I thought you were supposed to be in charge of him? Aren’t there rules in place, or does he go all James T Kirk on you whenever he pleases?” Admittedly it was probably a little tricky to babysit a king if he wanted to play at superhero, but he was surprised that Okoye had permitted it. Tony glanced back at Romanoff. “Did you know about this?”
Tony glanced up, surprised at the emotion there. T’Challa had said that the Wakandan group had dispersed pretty early on, but he hadn’t expected Wilson to be one of them, or to be on the outs with Rogers. If that was what it was, of course; Wilson certainly seemed to have a lot of emotion going on there, but it was difficult to read what exactly had him so wired up. Probably seeing Rogers as a kid wasn’t helping any, but Tony doubted this was the reason for why Wilson seemed to be the most hostile of the lot of them, given everything. He’d somehow expected Barton to be the one out for blood.
The briefing was mostly a rehash of stuff he already knew, with some added horrors thrown in. He’d already figured out that the likely scenario was that Rogers had interrupted the ritual killing, or had maybe not even reached the room before the whatever-it-was had happened. After all, other than being turned into a shrimp, he wasn’t injured. Unless the time pocket - or whatever it was - had healed him? It was a possibility, he supposed, but if that was the case, surely the time pocket would have healed the other soldiers as well? Unless…
” It was too loud. His hand was against the table, bracing him as he half-stood. “No,” he said, more quietly, and settled back down again. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Tony reached for the tea on the table; hot liquid sloshed over the side of the cup as he lifted it, trembling, into his lap. The hot weight of it was comforting against his chilled fingers.
"How the hell is unclenching supposed to prevent me shitting myself? Seriously, Legolas, your metaphors could do with some work," Tony snapped. He glared at Barton out of the corner of his eye. "Would you be relaxed if it was Cooper? If he was alone, and scared, and you could do nothing about it?"
“Whereas we’re all set,” Tony cut in. “Your majesty, not to put too fine a point on things, but we had two team members who knew their way around a glowy object. One’s on another planet right now, and the other can’t leave your borders. That doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence as to our ability to handle this - as Cap’s current state proves.”
“Hey, honey...” Tony mumbles and wraps his arms around his baby girl on reflex. He sighs a little and starts to doze again, but then he realises how hot Wanda feels in his arms. Tony nudges his husband awake. “Baby, you have a fever. You feeling icky?” Tony asks, sitting up on the bed to get a proper look at Wanda. When Steve does not immediately wake up, Tony nudges him again.
“Don't worry, we'll get to the arm.” Stephen says calmly. “I’ll arrange for an x-ray right after the head scan. Poor thing, they really shouldn't have left him like that for so long.” The doctor shakes his head, but then goes back to trying to be level headed. That is what Tony needs him to be right now.
“Baby, can you look at Thomas for me so he can talk to you? He’s gonna tell you all about how you’re going to get better here.”
“Good. We might check your temp later on, but if you feel okay, that’s good.” Steve pats his back. “Maybe you’ll both feel better soon. Now so you want a new story or TV or playtime?”
“You’re a mother hen, babe.” Steve chuckles, patting Tony’s ass teasingly while passing him in the kitchen. “He’s got the sling and he’s careful anyway, isn’t he? Pete’s not one to play rough normally, right?” He argues.
He wonders if anyone else notices the faint smell of the ocean that follows next, quickly blown away on a gentle breeze.
Steve pulls his hand away, and when Tony looks at him again, the calm expression has tightened slightly.
He knows as soon as he opens his eyes. It’s funny how snow works that way. It’s a silence in the air, like something in the world is holding its breath, afraid that it will all just
“But what would be the fun in that?” Obie says with a smirk, nodding at Steve again. “Hope those bruises heal soon.”
There’s still a lingering worry he can see in Tony’s eyes, and he knows that this problem won’t be easily solved.
Steve blushes again, throwing a pillow at his head. Tony dodges with a laugh, and Steve smiles too, shaking his head because Tony’s laugh will never
He’s no longer listening; all he can feel is dread. He would have thought that by the second month of being in New York after graduating, the dread and panic would have lessened.
“Why does Fury want me there?” He says, eyes narrowing. “Because last I checked I'm just the mechanic.”
He nods. “Yeah, at The Institute Of Art. I want to do something with art in life. Maybe teach kids, I’m not really sure.”
Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing anymore he’s so angry, and angry isn’t really appropriate anymore because Ty would be dead if Tony wasn’t drugged out of his mind in his arms right now.
Obie’s words filter back to him. His mother had been driving. An accident. But she was careful, too careful, never drank, never went over the speed limit, never slipped.
They’ve been spending most days together, even if it’s just for a few hours. Tony continues to go to the cafe for his coffee, and he’s heard nothing more from Obadiah about it. Dinner, movies, just spending time together. They haven’t had sex, and it’s a mix of Steve wanting to wait, and him wanting to wait, and the fact that Tony has only just gotten organised and hired someone yesterday to sweep his entire apartment for hidden cameras.
“I’m so sorry.” Steve says softly, touching his arm, grip on his hand tightening a little. “But at least we have the hard evidence now.”
“Please.” He says again, and his voice is barely louder than a whisper. This is the only goddamn thing he’ll
“That’s cool.” Steve sits down next to him, grabbing his laptop and pulling it open. “Is there anything you want to watch?”
“Nope.” Tony's grip tightens slightly, and Steve forces his eyes open. “Don’t you dare fall asleep right now. Steve? I’ve called an ambulance, you have to stay awake.”
“I’m with you.” Tony says, voice curling around the words as he smiles, and it’s not a camera smile, it’s not a flirting smile, it’s a real one. It’s honest. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
Tony’s hands are on his cheeks, running over his face. It’s so gentle. He leans into the touch, eyes closing.
There’s a large sketchbook on a stand in the middle, and as Tony gently turns the pages, he sees Steve’s life, his love, displayed on every single one.
Steve laughs, lacing their fingers together, and Tony leans into his warmth, putting everything else out of his mind.
He reads about Tony Stark, the son of the billionaire, the boy who’s been heir to Stark Industries for his whole life. There are countless of stories about him, and Steve is certain that at least half of them are bullshit. There are pictures of him with girls draped over him at fifteen, pictures of drinks in his hands, pictures of him with wide, unfocused eyes.
“Tony.” He says, kissing him, desperate to wipe away the confusion. “I love you. More than anything. I really want this. Plus, I literally spend most of my time at your place anyway, so it kind of isn’t a massive change.”
, he wants to say, but swallows down the words. Tony looks… surprised. Happy. But surprised. He gives Steve another smile, a little unsure maybe, but pleased.
Obie raises his eyebrows, and Tony fights not to take a step backwards as he stands up, coming round the side of the desk to stand in front of it. He’s not scared of Obadiah, he’s
It’s not an apology, and he doesn’t want to apologise anyway. He wants Steve to understand, he wants to explain, but not apologise. He would do it again, however much it made him hate himself. Obie is dangerous, and Tony refuses to let Steve get ruined by mistakes that aren’t his own.
“Never, Okay? That’s never an option. We can figure this out, and there’s always another option that isn't giving in to them.”
“I-” he feels frantic, jumpy. But he can’t have Rhodey here, because he can’t hide from Ty anymore. “I need you to leave.”
“Steve?” Tony’s previous anger has given way to shock, and Steve fights for breath as they face each other. The hallway is empty, and everything echoes a little in the quiet.
“GHB. The shit that Ty spiked my drink with. That’s what is was. I’ve had it before; it’s the same effects, especially with alcohol. It… I realised what it was too late.”
Steve looks at Tony, sees his eyes dancing with light for the first time in a while. And then he kisses him, because it’s impossible not to like this, surrounded by so much life.
Howard’s voice is low, soft. Tony doesn’t answer. Whatever he says, it won’t make a difference. He tugs slightly at his father's grip, and Howard releases him, turning back to Obadiah, who’s pretending he hasn’t heard all of that.
“Look into police records over the last ten years, anything linking to SI. We should be clean, so if there’s anything there, flag it.” Tony hands him his phone, typing in a string of code. “I cracked the firewalls, so it should be overridden. Tell me if you run into any problems.”
“I haven’t had a lot of interactions with Hydra,” he starts, voice carrying in the silence, “only indirectly. I used to work for Obadiah Stane under the name of Carbonell, and there was… an issue about five years ago. Someone on the inside had sold weapons to an international terrorist group.” He nods towards the file still sitting on the table. “Hydra. I didn’t stay long enough to watch the consequences of that pan out.”
Tony reacts to this, and Steve feels his hands clench a little tighter around the fabric of his shirt, a small sound forcing its way out of his throat.
He re-focuses his attention on Tony, watching as he starts to spin the fork between his middle and index fingers. “My mother is Italian. I don’t use it a lot, but I like coming here. It’s one of the only properly authentic Italian places in New York.
“Shit.” He mutters, yanking his sweatshirt over his head. “I have to go Cap, but come down about 7?”
He doesn’t try and stop the tears this time, and neither of them mention them. He feels like something in his chest is breaking, cracking wide open. There’s no defence to this, nothing he can do to stop it. He doesn’t know why it
Tony could have said it nicely, with a smile, but his parents are coming on Friday and he doesn’t have the brain space for this, because all he wants to do is kiss Steve and
Rhodey stays, and Tony is so beyond grateful. Less than twenty four hours later, Pepper is back, and she has donuts, just like that time so long ago.
He swallows hard, starting to make the coffee and praying that this guy, whoever he is, waits quietly. He looks familiar, almost scarily so, but Steve can’t place his face for the life of him.
Obadiah is late, and honestly Tony isn’t surprised. It’s the only thing he can rely on about the whole situation that he’s finding himself in increasingly often.
“Shut up.” Tony mutters, tugging Rhodey closer to an empty patch of grass at the back of the group and sitting down. He can
He just wants to take whatever pain is lingering in his eyes away, but he’s not really sure how to. Tony’s never been the most open, and he respects that he has his secrets, but sometimes… sometimes he wishes he could just read his mind.
“They would probably cut me from the company, leak it to the press, and then the New York tabloids would come and camp out on my doorstep for the next year. Then they’ll drag you into it, and you’ll have no privacy for… a long time.”
“I’m glad you like it so much.” He says quietly, and Steve realises that they’ve finished the song, and it’s immediately started to repeat. The lyrics start for the second time, and Steve feels himself relax.
He frowns, signalling to Nat to pause the music playing from the speakers in her room. He’s at her dorm, helping her with some random essay to pass time. After having classes for the rest of his day following his shift, he needs a break, but Nat helps him out too much, so the least he can do is try to repay her.
“Steve Rogers, correct? I’m so glad you’re going to make a speedy recovery. Awful, the amount of muggings that happen around this time of year, don’t you think?”
But he sees it click, sees it piece together in Steve’s eyes because he’s not stupid, he’s so far from stupid, and Tony’s face is still bruised. He wonders if Steve has known for a while, since even before the bruises and their conversation in the coffee shop, but just didn’t want to believe it.
He realises that they’ve gotten all the way to Happy’s car, and slides into the backseat, because he’s really not in the mood for small talk today.
“I've been good.” He says with a half smile, dragging his finger around the rim of his glass absentmindedly. “Teaching’s going well. You’d be surprised at how many of these kids are actually a lot smarter than they look.”
(He doesn’t think so, and Pepper agrees. She said as much when they drank too much at a college party once.)
Rhodey takes a step closer to him, and Tony sees Steve’s shoulders tense, like he’s bracing for impact. He supposes that he is, in a way.
Even he can understand that much, but for the second time, he see's Tony's face light up as the billionaire laughs with a nod
Because of course it’s his fault. It’s his fault for provoking his father, his fault for pushing, always his fault.
, and Tony has to look away, something in him unwilling to meet his gaze. Everything seems to have suddenly fallen away, and the teasing humour has vanished. It’s not a bad feeling, but it’s a quiet one. Like something is holding its breath.
He can’t see Tony’s face, but he can imagine what’s on it right now. Because Steve… he can guess. He can fucking
for Steve. He’s dangerous, because powerful people are dangerous people, and Obadiah, no matter how much Tony hates him, is
Howard makes him want to run and never stop running, but Steve is the first person who’s made him, even a tiny part of him, want to stay. And that won’t end well, not for anyone.
When they get to his apartment, Steve gets out of the car first, and Nat grabs his arm as she follows, dropping her voice to just above a whisper.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispers again, and Steve wants nothing more than to reach out, to brush away the anguish he knows written into every line of his face, to say something,
weapons to terrorists. And without the joy of knowing who… there had been no way he could’ve risked continuing to make them. So he’d left, walked away, not looked back. But somehow…
He catches Tony reaching for the fork, but then seemingly change his mind half way there and move his hand back to its original place. A second later, his fingers start tapping out a beat on the table cloth, and Steve realises that his hands are constantly in motion, constantly doing something. It's ridiculously captivating, and he knows that if Nat was here, she would be laughing at him. Somehow, he can't bring himself to care.
“Maybe I’m just full of surprises.” Steve says softly, because this song is a soft song, and Tony’s hand on his waist is gentle, and he thinks he’s imagining it, but it feels like Tony’s thumb is brushing over his palm.
Something in him aches at the way Tony's eyes light up, and he has to kiss him again, pulling him closer.
The drinking gets worse for a while, worse than when he'd come back from Siberia. Tony know's Rhodey is scared, he can hear it in his voice every time he talks to him. But then it gets better
“What? I do my research. He graduated from MIT last year, and he’s come to New York to help his father with work.” She frowns slightly. “Also, how do you know he’s not gay?”
Steve is the furthest thing from weak. He’s steady, a mix of a raging fire of emotions and the never-ending presence of the ocean. It’s almost infinite, how deep Steve’s loyalty goes, how good his heart is
tell her all of it. But he can’t because then she would give him such a sad look, and it’s a look he gets from her already when photos are leaked, or stories are sold, or she comes round to his apartment and sees the lack of things on the walls, the lack of any sort of personalisation.
Steve gets an almost overwhelming urge to hug him and never let go, but he doubts the billionaire would appreciate it.
“Baby I could never hate you,” Steve murmurs, fingers carding through his hair, and the soothing, constant rhythm is making him feel like he’s floating.
Nat just raises her eyebrows, but Steve doesn’t miss the hurt flickering in her eyes. He moved between them, turning to face Tony.
“All right.” Barton held up his hands in the classic ‘mea culpa’ gesture. “All right. Yes, you’re right. We definitely should have told you. But - OK, again, in my defence, you were concussed, and then, you know, with the whole having your brain all exposed like that -”
Tony bared his teeth at Mordo. “Lucy, looks like you’ve got some ‘splainin’ to do.” He stepped around them, visibly disregarding them both, and let himself into the still-cloaked jet.
He let her think it through, her brow furrowing. Happy glanced between them, but didn’t interrupt Pepper’s train of thought. “I’d prefer if we could keep him out of sight,” she said finally. “I think registering him for anything more elaborate than that will just lead to more trouble. Besides,” her eyes narrowed again, “I thought you weren’t going to do anything permanent?”
Rhodey brought his wheelchair around to the nearest bench and hesitated. “Let’s pause here,” he said, not looking at Tony.
Startled, Tony flailed awake before he’d managed to orient himself, lashing at whoever was hovering over him.
RE: Tony's priority list - I get a bit frustrated with portrayals of the whole of the Avengers as being uniformly at the top. Tony is human, and he would have his favourites just like anyone else. If it came down to choosing between Sam and Rhodey, he wouldn't hesitate. *shrug* Learning to accept and manage those limits is pretty important if you're planning on leading people into battle, though.
“Stand down, Stark,” M’Baku growled, and closed one large hand around Mordo’s bicep. “He is not going anywhere without a guard. We are in control, here. There is no need for panic.”
No serum, no war, no SHIELD betrayal… no mother and no Bucky, either, so it wasn’t all sunshine and roses, but at least the time displacement would be easier on a child.
He watched the cleaning bots clear the area. A hologram signaled the end of the session and queried if he would like to start a new one. Steve chose to end session and left the Dojo.
Twenty minutes later, Tony admitted defeat and stopped. The fog was still pressing in around him and visibility was still down to zero. Throwing caution to the wind, he called out. “Steve? Can you hear me?”
Picking over the past two days again in his head, Tony worried for his sense of direction. It wasn’t just the Tower that he had trouble with. It was any place at any given time. Almost walking past a classroom or the Archives before being shepherded through the door by Steve. Thinking he knew where he was heading before realizing that he was in fact going in a completely different direction. Tony was glad there were no cliffs on campus. He’d have walked off one without knowing.
Tony shrugged and headed into the Tower. “Talk to JARVIS about it. He has my schedule.” He called over his shoulder. “Thanks for the unnecessary escort, enjoy the rest of your night, don’t be a stalker, et cetera, bye.”
Jan smiled indulgently and squished his cheeks between her hands. “I know you’re Iron Man, Tony, but I also know how you are with your own health and safety, and that’s just as important as being Iron Man.”
The trail leaned left in an unsteady curve and Steve followed it cautiously. He suddenly wished he was wearing his stealth suit instead of his usual clothes. Another faint creak filtered through the fog and he tightened his grip on the shield. Ahead, the cheese trail grew more and more sparse until it finally petered out. He crouched by the last cheese crumb and surveyed the ground. The rocky terrain was not optimal for tracking but that did not deter him.
Tony crossed his arms. “I don’t need babysitting, Rogers. What are you going to do the entire time I’m here? Glare the Timefog into submission? Why don’t you go destroy a helicopter or two instead? That’ll be a much better use of time for everyone involved.”
Natasha studied Tony’s wounds and wan face with a critical eye. “You’re going immediately to the infirmary whether you like it or not, Stark. You look like you’ll fall over even before I taser you.”
At some point he’d lost Jan in the crowd, but it was okay because he was finally getting into the groove. It was second nature for him to navigate the teeming crowd to find the best places where it was just the right amount of packed. He made it through an indeterminable number of songs.
Steve choked and tried to loosen Tony’s grip. With a heave of his body, he rolled them closer to the fire and trapped Tony’s body beneath him. He grabbed Tony’s flailing hands and sat on him. “You have to fight it, Tony!”
Tony’s eyes flitted about, looking for something that wasn’t there. “It’s just the one scratch, Steve. Nothing to worry about. Let’s just go.”
In the two hour window, he managed to not only finish three projects for SI, but also get himself out of his funk. Tony always found tinkering and building things to be soothing. Just him and technology. That and blasting music at ear-splitting levels.
The taller man’s hand twitched where it rested on Tony’s shoulder. “I’m not-” He huffed. “I hate to say it, but Loki’s right. I’ll walk you back. If you’re so sleep deprived you can’t even walk in the right direction you need someone to be with you.”
Steve carefully laid Tony down on the ground and stood to stretch his stiff muscles. He kicked dirt over their fire. He shook Tony awake, and coaxed him to hang onto his back, and retrieved his shield.
The view from the penthouse was such that a large part of campus was visible. And what he could see was that it was deserted. Buildings were worn down, and the crumbling sidewalks had dead weeds coming out through the cracks. All the trees in Avengers Park were barren and the fountain was dry. The clock tower that was part of the Timeless Archives had a large crack running through the clock face, and the minute hand was missing.
Tony huffed weakly. “I hate to say it, but you’re right. I’m pretty sure it’s all gone, but the thing could just be playing tricks on my brain. Again.”
The silence was unnerving. Tony strained his eyes in vain to see past the swirling fog. “Steve!” His voice wavered. Taking a steadying breath, Tony willed himself to calm down.
He picked up the soldering iron and nearly fumbled. Tony shuddered as his mind connected the dots and furiously sorted everything out. Dread and fear washed over him and he opened his mouth to give JARVIS a word of warning.
“Teamwork.” Tony echoed. “You want to us to work together. When you know we can’t even be in the same room for five minutes before we start arguing. We’re never in the same team when we’re fighting bad guys. More like we’re never in the same team. Ever.”
Jan searched his face. “Is that how you got that cut on your cheek?” She gently pressed fingers around it. “It looks pretty inflamed. Maybe you should get it checked out.”
Tony looked down at the wrench held loosely in his hand. He was sitting in his lab, and he didn’t know how long he’d been zoning out for. A holographic image of something or other spun in the air above him. Even after careful consideration, he still wasn’t sure what it was supposed to be. Tony placed the wrench down on the workbench and crossed his arms. If he tilted his head just right and squinted, the contraption vaguely resembled an espresso machine mashed up with flight stabilizers and air conditioning.
“Yeah, he is,” Tony smiles and agrees. “I’m glad you like him. I know he thinks you’re a very good and very brave little boy. He was very proud of you, you know that? We all were so proud of you. You’ve been so good through all of this.”
“Okay. I’ll put it on. And...” Steve leans over and kisses Tony briefly to wake him up. “You wanna help me get some dinner for these two? I think someone needs a hug from Daddy too.” He nods at Peter, then sets up Paw Patrol on the TV. He grabs a blanket from off the couch and sets it on the floor in case Peter wants to watch from there. Tony stirs awake at the kiss and blinks a little blearily, but before he can wake properly, he has got Peter at his side demanding kisses.
Clearly, he’s hesitating for too long, because Nat releases a long suffering sigh, grabbing his phone out of his pocket, and the phone number left on the counter.
Steve sits down on the bed facing him, and for once, Tony is struggling to read his expression. Or maybe that’s just his panic, though he’s not sure why he’s panicking, since the entire situation is completely his fault. The silence is what’s getting to him. It’s always what gets to him before an argument. It’s what gets to him with Howard, and it’s what’s making his heart rate speed up now-
And then he’s gone, black coat sweeping out behind him as the door slams shut. Tony raises his eyebrows.
Obadiah just looks at him, small smile curving his lips, and Steve has never wanted to punch someone so badly in his life.
Rhodey had once told him that when he gets hurt, he lashes out at the people who are trying to help. Anything to stop them seeing the damage that the hurt has done.
“Thanks. But that’s not why I called-” He’s cut off for the second time, and some of the walls slip again. Steve sees it happen, sees the real depth of emotion flickering over his face. He’s struck with the thought that Tony
It’s the first time he acknowledged it out loud for years, since the one time Rhodey had refused to take his bullshit excuses as an answer.
There’s no noticeable change on Tony’s face, but his voice is edged with something dangerous when he speaks again, standing up.
Steve sees him, he can see him and he’s not turning and running. And even though he doesn’t know everything, he's not pushing and he’s not forcing him into anything he’s not comfortable with and
The other boy shrugs, letting go of Tony and giving him a hard shove. Steve barely moves in time to catch him as he stumbles, and this is wrong, this is so wrong, because Tony smells like alcohol but he’s more than drunk right now as he collapses into Steve’s arms.
Something about the nickname is doing a mix of making him feel hot all over, and annoyed. He decides to focus on annoyed. (Never mind the fact that he’s blushing again, and his pale skin is a real fucking giveaway.)
“You’re very welcome. Thank you for being such a brave boy for me.” Stephen tells the boy. “Now Peter, I want you to rest and drink lots and lots today, okay? And I’d like to talk to your Papa for just a moment.”
“You’re so sweet and considerate, princess.” Tony praises with a grin. After a quick ride up the elevator, Tony walks down the hall to Peter’s room and for a second he gets a mix of panic and relief at seeing Stephen in Peter’s room talking to Steve. “What’s going on? How’s Peter? Is he okay?” Tony blurts out.
“Me get pop.” Peter grins a little, knowing Stephen is generous with the sugar-free lollipops that he gives after exams and procedures.
While he gets changed, Peter continues to doze a little with Pooh tucked in his arm. But, the boy cannot rest for long as Stephen and Thomas start to talk in complicated terms that he does not understand.
“Not… Not really.” Steve admits. “I just told him he’d have to stay a little longer. I just didn’t want to upset him. I don’t know how to tell him. I guess it’s like ripping off a band aid.”
“Made a picture so Peter feels betters.” Wanda shows him. She used his favourite colours blue and purple and added lots of sparkles. “And played princess. And saw Frozen. I’m Elsa. Peter’s princess too.”
“No arm get better.” Peter giggles, reaching up for the bottle his Papa is holding. He does not see what the fuss is about and just wants his juice.
Picking up the pale pink pull-up, Steve comes over to help Wanda clean up. He has got some wet wipes as well and begins cleaning around Wanda’s privates and the top of her thighs. “The pool’s super fun, yeah, but I’m afraid your brother can’t swim with the cast on. We could go just the two of us though. Or would you rather wait for Pete?”
Peter looks back at Stephen. He knows he is supposed to be a big boy and he cannot stop himself from crying. But, he will go.
“Daddyyy!” Peter adds in helpfully and Tony bursts out of the bathroom in the middle of his shaving. There is no way he is letting Wanda out of the house so that she will need hospital treatment to cure her pneumonia.
“Ow! Feels bad. Right here.” He points to where it hurts the most. He hopes that the magic will make it feel better soon. “Kiss better, Stephen?”
“My head. All over.” Wanda says, referencing the shakes and chills she had a little earlier. “I want kisses and Cinderella. I want...goodnight. Goodnight.” She forced herself up in a daze and ambles away, tripping over her feet.
“Fell down. Magic makes all better. Right?” He wants them all to think he can be a brave boy too. “Daddy and Papa is outside. I get magic.”
“No, we play.” Peter says, taking Steve’s hand to try and tug him along to the play mat, but Papa is huge and strong, so the little boy can barely make him move. Stephen frowns softly as he considers Peter’s poor mood. It is obvious that the boy is feeling lonely and neglected, but his irritability could also be due to catching the same thing his sister has. The doctor turns to Steve.
“Pre OP meds are kicking in it seems.” Stephen comments to Thomas quietly. The nurse chuckles and nods before pausing by the elevator and pushes the button. Just a few seconds later it arrives and they all get in and ride up to the fourth floor, which is the surgical floor.
Wow, Tony thinks, sighing just a bit at finally having a Little who will not put up a fight about medication. He picks the girl up with a groan and sets her on his hip.
“I brought some little surprises for little ones that are good during checkups.” Stephen winks at Peter. “I promise I won’t hurt you, honey.”
“Wan’a and Da sleepy?” Peter asks in a loud whisper and eyes his sister and Daddy on the sofa from the kitchen doorway. They look really sleepy and the TV, which is still on, does not even seem to disturb their sleep. Peter pads back over to Steve, not at all caring that he is putting away groceries and walks right up to him.
“Hey, hey, sweet pea, it’s okay.” Steve shushes and squeezes Wanda a bit tighter to his side. “You can play with your brother a bit, but Daddy and I want you to rest and get better. You can lay in bed or on the sofa downstairs and watch movies all day. That’s fun, right?” Steve tries, taking another more positive perspective on the situation. But, before he can explain more, Tony returns to the bedroom with a thermometer in hand as well as Peter on his hip.
“I know, I know.” Stephen says soothingly. “Some of these hospitals are overworked and understaffed. It's a good thing you brought him here. He'll be top priority for me, I promise. Can't just ignore my favourite patient. Now since he hit his head I want to get a MRI scan done as soon as possible. I'm gonna need you to keep him calm. You can't cuddle with him when he's in the machine, so he might be scared.”
“How long?” Peter continues whining, getting a bit restless now and wants to move around. When he moves his arm, he yelps and freezes before wailing, more so out of fright and exhaustion than pain. Tony feels his heart break in two at how Peter’s crying and hugs him as carefully as he can.
“Papa stay.” Peter says again and lifts his hand up to hold onto his Papa’s sweater. “We play?” He asks, putting on the best puppy eyes he has got to finally play with his Papa after playing by himself the day before. Just when Peter thinks Steve is about to nod, Tony calls out from the stairs.
Wanda stiffens and bites her lip. Her first thought is to run away and hide, but she cannot think of a good spot where they would not find her, so instead she bursts into tears.
“He fell from the monkey bars and landed on his arm. He also lost consciousness, but I’m not sure if that was due to hitting his head or due to the pain and fright of falling.” She explains, her heart breaking in her chest at seeing the sweetest baby in the daycare get hurt so badly. Naturally, she blames herself for not keeping the baby away from the monkey bars meant for older Littles.
“Where’s your sling, bud?” Steve asks, but Peter just shrugs in response. “Peter, where's your sling?” Steve repeats again, keeping his tone firm, but gentle and kind. “I know that it's not fun to keep it on all the time, bud, but you have to if you want your arm to get better. Can you show Daddy where it is?” He wonders if maybe his little boy was in some kind of discomfort with it on, and if maybe the painkillers will help a little. Either way, he is worried that he just took it off.
“But, we are the knights, baby. Papa and I protect you and your sister from all danger.” Tony says, turning to look at Peter before grabbing the towel and helping Wanda up.
“Wanda, did you take off Peter’s sling?” Steve asks, coming over and crouching down by the little girl. Wanda crosses her arms and nods, looking down at her feet shamefully. She did not really think about it, but she knew that she really probably was not supposed to take it off without asking, if at all.
“It's okay, sweetheart. Daddy's here. I didn't go anywhere before, right? It's gonna be just the same this time. Just a quick picture of your owie and then you're all done.”
“I’ll do a quick neuro exam and look at his arm. The MRI should be free once I’m done.” The doctor says. Tony nods with a relieved smile. Finally, someone is actually taking care of his baby.
“Papa will be right back, baby boy.” Tony tells Peter. “Hey, is Pooh spending time in the hospital too? Maybe he got an owie somewhere, huh?”
Steve's heart just drops. He knows that Stephen is only telling them what they need to hear, but the thought of putting his little boy through anymore pain is just killing him. He has no idea on how to tell Peter that he will have to go through surgery.
Wanda actually has to go potty right then, but does not say anything and just presses her legs together while Tony brushes her hair. She shifts from foot to foot, trying and failing to keep still and humming to herself. She loves it when he brushes her hair. He never tugs hard and always hugs her afterward and it makes her look beautiful.
“It'll be okay, baby boy.” Tony runs a hand through Peter's hair. “Daddy’s gonna be right over there. You're being so, so brave for me right now. I am so proud of you. I just want you to close your eyes and let Stephen figure out how to help you, okay? You're gonna be just fine.”
“Yes, yes, I think we will do that. Could you- could you get us in touch with Greenwood hospital?” When the nurse nods, Steve adds. “Tell them it’s Steve Rogers and we’d like to see Doctor Stephen Strange.”
Oh God, third time in one month, Steve thinks to himself. Perhaps it is time for them to bring Wanda to see Stephen too.
“Thermo-meters, baby.” Tony corrects with a chuckle. “And that sounds like a beautiful life. If Peter and you are princesses, what does that make me and Papa? The fools who entertain the two of you while you sit on your thrones?” He suggests, making Wanda giggle and shake her head.
Wait, this does not make sense. Why does Peter need to be checked over if Wanda is the one sick? Grown ups can be so silly sometimes, Peter thinks with a huff. They were supposed to play already, but the promise of a surprise gets his attention.
