Sherlock studies every bit, looking like John is the most interesting thing he’s ever seen. It’s absurd how turned on John is by this, like feeling Sherlock’s eyes on him are just as good, if not better, than his hands. He would have assumed being so intently studied would make him nervous but in the face of Sherlock’s keen pleasure, it’s hard not to preen, just a bit.
“I’m sorry you think that,” John managed to reply. He fiddled with his comforter while Bill huffed. John’s phone buzzed at his hip but he ignored it.
Sherlock thought about slapping John and then kissing him and then slapping him again, consecutively.
“You’re in the Mojave,” a rumbling bass answers behind him. John whips around to find his mystery companion leaning casually in the doorway behind him. He goes on despite John’s gaping maw. “Annual rainfall is about five inches. Therefore unlikely.”
It made little difference. He’d heard the same from Mycroft just before men in white coats strapped him to a bed and left him to rot in agony for days at a time. Sherlock tuned anything else John said out for the remainder of the drive.
"Clara!" John takes the liberty of grasping her by the shoulders to steady her when she starts near panicking. He nods to her friend to say she's okay when the girl looks ready to step in. She hesitates but Clara waves her away.  "All right?"
Sherlock gave up trying to rush her away now that his reason for doing so was made pointless. John moved forward to take the box from her and set it in the kitchen.
Of course John would run straight back to the club scene, of course he would. That was the obvious answer, wasn’t it? Sherlock pulled the phone away from his head and groaned mournfully, doubling over in agony.
Sherlock’s arms crossed and he trudged along beside John, lacking the motivation to find the silly chit who’d stupidly tried to bring down a drug cartel by herself. She could be halfway to Columbia by now, like he cared.
“I ask because I think you’d make a fantastic surgeon. Hands-on work would be your forte, obviously.”
He grinned at them both, pleased with the developments. He had yet to knock two out of the park in one go and it sounded like his kind of challenge.
“I’ve an idea,” Sherlock whispered in his ear as soon as John’s back met his front, “do you trust me?”
John heaved a sigh and tugged him up and out of the car. They stumbled a bit but John got him around the middle and drug him into another waiting vehicle.
“Just a second,” he cut Scarlett off mid-rant to hobble over to the ticket taker at the front gate. “Excuse me, I’ve a question. Is readmission free if you have the stamp?” He held up his hand to show the man.
John cocked his head and frowned, that little line Sherlock both hated and adored appeared but he was too tired to smooth it. As if he would if he
Molly had Mary and Sherlock both in her sights from her vantage point near the patio. By her count Sherlock was his fifth flute of champagne and John had only just finished his first. It was not working out, John was the one that needed to be convinced, the one who needed to get  more drunk.
Sherlock hums his agreement as he keys open the door. It swings open to reveal… exactly what one would expect from a motel in the middle of nowhere - no better or worse. The decor probably hasn’t changed since nineteen seventy-three, and the mini-fridge doesn’t have a door on it, but other than that it looks serviceable. To John’s secret disappointment there are two beds, but the linens look relatively new, which is a plus.
John hung up on her, finger smashing the ‘end call’ button hard. He looked up at Sherlock for the first time, knowing full well his face was bright red. Sherlock looked like he might be ill, face paler than usual, eyes glassy, which superseded John’s embarrassment.
“Yeah, I’d love to,” he said sarcastically, “except my hand is broken and I don’t even know his number.”
He hadn’t gotten very far before he’d fallen to the floor in agony but he did remember the lamp had crashed to the floor with him and smashed quite nicely.
He heard Sherlock's yelp of surprise when John flipped them over so that he was on top. Later he'd feel guilty for forcing Sherlock onto his wounded back but in that moment all he could do was crash into him.
“John,” Laila softly drawled, “he crashed our date with a handsome bloke who clearly had no idea why he’d been called to action, and then ran out the back to avoid confrontation after it blew up in his face.” She looked away and took a deep breath, but the continued. “I know you like to think of him as this amazing, mysterious figure. A sort of avenging angel, all mighty and impervious, but… he’s still just a kid. Underneath all that blase attitude, he just wants you to like him. And you do! The lack of understanding between you two is unbelievably absurd.”
David is; meaty you could say.” The kid nodded sagely. “She had finally pressured me into switching majors, just last week in fact.” He received a grin for that. “Poli-sci, right again. I was to be the next Prime Minister.”
Mrs Hudson was in position at the top of 221C, just where he knew she would be, still hovering around nervously as Sherlock had loaded up the cedar crates labeled “‘Heather Hill Apiary” from the van outside. She caught John just as he came down to investigate, mumbling about ventilation and worries of escapees. He could hear them chatter, John questioning their landlady in confusion, until an exclamation of, “Bees?!” was heard. Immediately John was down the stairs and ready to put a stop to whatever Sherlock had gotten them into now.
?” John palmed the ridged outline of his partner’s erection. His reaction was textbook but also like nothing John had ever seen. His back bowed, showcasing his long torso and, as the two sides of his unzipped hoodie had fallen open, the strained buttons of his shirt underneath. His fingers dug into John’s muscled back, held on as if letting go was a death sentence. His hips tilted forward, forcing himself harder into John’s grasp. And his voice… Christ.
Sherlock tilts his head and whispers against his neck, “I’m sorry I ruined it. I just want…I can’t believe you…it’s-“ He huffs in frustration and John chuckles, which earns him a grunt.
“Yes. The sting wasn’t traumatic, the trauma stemmed from its death. I didn’t mean for it to happen. The bit that reminded me tonight,” he stops to collect his thoughts, “I felt honoured by its sacrifice. This magnificent creature had lived to serve, to be of use to a greater whole, and its last heroic deed was to leave a part of itself with me. I was
“It’s fine. You seemed pretty zoned out during class usually. I assumed it was hangovers but then you switched to pre-med…”
When Sherlock glanced down at his phone he immediately bent double and laughed himself silly. John laughed along with him, though he wasn’t sure yet why.
John’s eyes managed to flit back up to Sherlock’s and then he tore the whole drawer out and dumped it on the floor, pawing through it like a mad man.
“I can’t quite picture you all round the table for Christmas.” John thought, despite Sherlock’s assurance otherwise, he probably had grown up in a drafty manor house, lonely, left to his own devises.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed in agreement, trying like mad to play it cool. “I like the one with us handcuffed together.”
“Accident,” John answers, still riding the high of the inspection and Sherlock’s brilliance, despite the subject matter.
They dance around the loo, trading hooks and jabs. If John’s honest, he’s having the time of his life. The man even seems to enjoy it when John lands a particularly solid blow to his jaw, his smirk doing things to John’s stomach that he tries valiantly to ignore.
Words were beyond Sherlock. All he knew was John’s fist and John’s thick digit as it pushed gently inside. Seconds passed, that’s all it took.
The roommate scowled. “I know the Beatles,” she snapped at what she must have perceived as condescension. John held his hands up contritely. Sherlock felt a bit left out, but didn’t remark. He knew the band but not the song; best not to let that out.
Eventually he rolled to a sitting position and leant up against the sofa, knees up, patiently waiting for Sherlock to come back. What the hell was he doing, anyway?
Sherlock didn’t seem to expect that, though it seemed an obviously fair trade. Something about it bothered John, beyond what he already felt, and he realized what it was when Sherlock blinked in confusion.
John smiled, a feral thing, one he’d gotten smacked more than once for giving his sister. His index finger came up slowly, Sherlock tracking its progress as it came to a stop at his diaphragm. His eyes met John’s, pleadingly, but John wasn’t deterred.
“Now, what brings you to my table?” The man asked congenially, fingers steepled and held against his lips.
The walk to the tube was abysmal, just as cold and wet as it had been the hour before, but his mind was otherwise occupied with strengthening his mental strongholds, making sure every possible weakness was solidified against future attacks. Boxing lessons would need to be kept to regulation only. Lav time could under no circumstances overlap, not even to brush teeth. Any intimate activity must be kept separate, with the exception of eating or shared sitting room time. He’d already experienced Sherlock in his ridiculous silk dressing gowns, so that wouldn’t really be an issue. But what about catching Sherlock dressing? Or, god forbid he find evidence of actual masturbation happening! He already knew how he reacted to the mere idea of it, that morning’s misadventure had proven that, but what if he caught the odd moan from his room?
“He has control of my funds and monitors my allowance,” Sherlock went on, “which, I might add, is completely unnecessary.”
Sherlock palpated the sore area and grinned. John had done that. He was technically sporting John’s mark. How wonderful.
“Yes. The way you dispatched Oliver’s man might have been a calculated tactic to throw me off but you’ve been rubbing at your thigh absently, which means it is actually bothering you. I thought the cane was a ruse to throw me off, doubly so when you obviously didn’t need it while fighting,” John marvels at that bit of information, “but since you’ve come down from the rush of adrenaline, you’re more aware of it. Correct?”
He didn’t register anything again until he was well away, cradling his left hand to his chest and nearly tripping down the steps to the tube. It wasn’t the first time he’d lashed out in anger, possibly broken his hand. He flexed it as he pulled his wallet out to get at his Oyster Card. Maybe just a fracture. He was already mentally calculating how much money he had for a brace at Boots. He’d have to budget again, best get used to it now.
Molly shook her head, and then leant in to whisper, "He's livid. Told me last week he's protesting."
Sherlock weighed John seriousness and apparently found it solid. His bum shifted on the table, clearly antsy. “I’m sorry, John. I’ll… do better.”
“Jonn," she snapped. “Let me finish." He nodded, contrite, and she went on. “This situation is shit, all right, but I went into it anyway. Cause you're smart and sweet and quite fit honestly." John snorted and Laila let him sneak in a kiss for the compliments. “I just want to say… I went in with both eyes open. The least you could do is the same. Yeah?"
He was about to remind the man that he’d at least once invaded a small country but just then Mrs. Hudson flew out of her flat in a flurry of flour and indignation.
Sherlock felt as if he didn’t quite have enough air to breathe a response, as John’s question had sent warm air over the most sensitive bit of flesh in John’s reach. “I- If you- Yes…I suppose if you’d like…”
They’re staring at each other, taking in the sights with renewed appreciation. John is wondering if he should have started cycling to work like he’d been thinking about doing lately, but it must not matter because Sherlock falls upon him again and resumes snogging him breathless. Now, with the shirts out of the way, they seem to slither more snakelike than before. But it’s not enough.
He sat back down from his attempt at standing. “Just a… an acquaintance. But he’s malleable and you’re apparently not so if you’ll excuse me-“
Antoinette made an ‘Oh’ face and pulled the textbook and paper forward to rework the problem. While she was bent over the book, Sherlock clawed dramatically at his face.
“Do you know what it was like for me? I didn’t know you were in pain, Sherlock, I just thought you’d grown tired of me already. You made me feel special, and then...nothing. You ignored me for days on end, got snappy with me over nothing, basically shut me out at every turn. It was awful, I just missed my friend. Sometimes I’d come home with a funny story from the cafe and I couldn’t wait to tell you but you’d be on the sofa or at the table or locked in your room and you wouldn’t respond. I didn’t,” he stopped to swallow, his grip on Sherlock’s arms loosening, “I didn’t know what to do.”
“Thought you didn’t do this sort of thing,” he mumbled into Sherlock’s collarbone. He was enjoying this turn of events too much not to tease.
Sherlock looked down at him, not in anger or sadness, but in contemplation. A niggle of worry skittered down his spine. His eyes perused John's frame until he couldn't take it anymore, he pushed past Sherlock and walked away. Or tried at least. He found his arm in Sherlock's grasp and pulled backwards until he was right back where he started.
It’s such a random thought, but John can’t help but appreciate how much difference there is in sucking cock in a nightclub or just after a firefight, and now. Clean is the first thing John notices, basically.
“Did you just slap me?" His left cheek stung, giving evidence to the assault. He shoved her away and glanced around, absently working his tongue around inside his mouth, tasting the fresh welling of blood from John's initial punch. “Where the hell is John?"
John lit up like a firework. “Oh! Vera Lynn! Pink Floyd? Right?” He then surprised the hell out of everybody by singing the song for the roommate in a beautiful tenor. The song was unfamiliar to Sherlock, unsurprisingly, but John’s voice gave him a new appreciation for eighties rock music.
going to lecture me on lying, in any of its forms?” John retorted, voice clipped low, dangerous now.
“As I said, attempting.” He glanced over at Ms. McCurdy when she grunted at them. He kicked John’s feet out of the way so he could stand and then fished his lock-picking set from his pocket.
John left Sherlock downstairs and went to unpack his bag. The rumble of his stomach reminded him that they'd never gotten around to eating the Chinese, but he doubted he could bother now. More than anything he just wanted to lie down and pray sleep came easily. He’d been up nearly all day and what a day it had been.
Sherlock did some amalgamation of a nod and a shake of his head. “No! It could be, it could be that night.”
"Sherlock," he groaned and motioned helplessly at the plastic bottle at the end of the bed. When he bent back to reach for it, his torso arched in a way that was not only beautiful to behold, but also angled his arse in just a way that John's eyes rolled. "Hurry. Hurry up, c'mon. Gimme that," he panted in a rush and snatched the bottle as soon as Sherlock turned around with it.
He took his time going down and then dragging the ridiculous suitcase up the stairs, if only to give himself time to think. His heart-rate was up, and not just because the suitcase weighed a tonne.
As she watched, John spotted a guest as he arrived, a man in full military dress uniform, and made his apologies to Greg before he made his way to greet the man.
John’s version of their reunion was basically a tornado with arms, but still he included a few hearts, broken and whole both. He’d agree with that. Thankfully Mary was not included in the scene. He wasn’t so lucky with the next panel but it could hardly be helped, being the wedding and all. At least John managed to convey the hesitance he must have felt, the three of them standing side by side at the altar but with John looking at Sherlock instead of Mary. Sherlock wished he’d known then that John was wishing Sherlock had spoken up. If John only knew how close the words had been on his tongue that day.
“Wait, hold up,” he called out as he unlocked the front gate. “We go in pairs. We’ve no idea how dangerous this situation might be. You go with Sherlock.”
“Mmm, Romany Dagger. I do like the sound of that,” he admitted, palming said bit of flesh until Sherlock was panting.
John barely suppresses the urge to roll his eyes, doing his best to follow behind without looking like a hedgehog rolling over a log. They both make it over the top of the wall as the first assailant makes it around the corner.
“Molly,” John drawled in confusion. He took her hand but glanced up at the viper at the bar, now laughing full throated at something Sherlock had said, and back at the nondescript woman in front of him. “Molly Hooper who has the keys to the forensics lab?”
John swallowed the excess saliva and tried again. Bernard - he was fairly sure the bloke’s name was Bernard - groaned and let his head hit the back of the stall door. His hand cradled John’s head, stroking the fine hairs behind his ear.
The roar of an approaching vehicle throws John and Sherlock apart as they scramble to catch sight of the newcomer.
crazy," Mary told Janine. "I thought Jim was going to literally explode if you screamed at that computer monitor any more."
“Nothing for you to worry yourself over,” Sherlock responded as she tittered over John’s placement of the ice.
“Moving in? Yes. This is my room, right? I mean, did you want to switch or something? Cause I’ve got to say, I don’t like your redecorating.” He gave a good natured chuckle but Sherlock didn’t laugh with him. He stared up at John like John had offered him gold, frankincense and myrrh. Or maybe more appropriately, a triple homicide. It was so similar to the way he’d looked at John that first night that John’s smile died on his lips and he had to swallow and look away, lest he start blushing.
Like a child’s doll, he dressed and undressed John in the privacy of his mind. If he’d had a good day - the striped jumper. Over John’s head it went… If it had been stressful, though, he’d prefer the thick, navy blue one. Off went the striped jumper, peeled slowly up over his outstretched arms, revealing his taut stomach…
She spoke softly, in that rhythmic Arabic she knew damn well John couldn’t understand. What the hell was she up to now? He moved forward again but she scowled and shook her head once, warning him away, as she waited for an answer from the other side.
A slow smile spread as Sherlock imagined dominating John in a silly board game. The chance to make John laugh, to get him to tease, to see that confused pout. Brilliant.
Sherlock punched the pillow next to his head. "If you don't put your cock in me right this instant, I'm going to scream bloody murder. Mrs. Hudson will come to investigate and neither of us wants that."
Sherlock vacillated between ‘So what? Come back and touch my penis again’ and what he felt was his duty to fill John full to bursting with food. He, himself, could skip several meals before refueling became dire, but John, he was depressingly thin from not eating. Eventually Sherlock let him up, if only to see how long it would take before John was back at his Army weight.
“I don’t believe you need any help with your ground game, such as it is. If we could stick to hand to hand combat, that would be preferable.”
“Yeah, but I haven’t called yet. It looks small but I don’t mind. It could be… cozy.” He ran the back of his finger up the side of her neck.
“Oh, yeah. I mean, not for you, obviously, getting clocked for your troubles but… I mean the deductions and the way you just
“Either you share him or you don’t. This playing around shit isn’t fair,” Bernard eventually muttered.
John’s first instinct was to run up the stairs but he didn’t want to appear too eager. Sherlock had been a prat on the phone after all; no reason to reward bad behavior with obvious excitement. He took the stairs at a leisurely pace, each step a study in casual ease. It became apparent that Sherlock was playing his violin; at least, he
“So,” John drawls after a silent moment passes, “what’s the plan here? Sneak up on the gun wielding drug runner and simply ask him to hand over his boss?”
Sherlock grins but doesn’t answer. John scowls but doesn’t comment. He’s not really disappointed, just...oddly flat about the whole thing.
“No! It doesn’t matter what we want! Don’t you get that? It will never work! If it were simple and easy we would have had it by now.”
“Cause you pulled his hair like a girl,” he muttered to himself as he adjusted his cock to a more comfortable position in his trousers. It was still rock hard. “Blast.”
John groaned into the phone and walked further into the sitting room, further away from Sherlock. “Seriously, stop it.”
“You sure know how to make enemies, is all I’m saying. Perhaps you shouldn’t have outted that girl to her father, you ever think of that?”
She glances over at Bea. The girl smiles back, trying to convey support for whatever it is that's got her friend so upset. "Yeah, maybe." She sounds more hopeful now.
-and continued to watch him. “I have one around here somewhere. Yes, from the Pterios experiment, the case with the Japanese business man and his secretary. It would have to be- Oh.” His eyes widened and he looked around the room in confusion. “I forgot to feed the fish,” he mumbled.
John dodged the first swing but Sherlock connected with the follow up, snapping John’s head to the side. He didn’t wait for John to try again, Sherlock grabbed him by the jacket and swept him to the ground, intent on beating John until nothing hurt except his fists.
John sputtered when Mrs. Hudson let out a, "Pfft," and waved him off. He looked up at James with an incredulous laugh.
, Mr. Holmes, is none of your concern. I think somebody needs to teach you a lesson in keeping your blasted opinions to yourself.”
Sherlock’s smug face quickly morphed into one of surprise. It always felt good when he could outwit the smartest man he knew.
“Ta!” John clapped when Sherlock finished. He gave an uneven bow and placed his violin back in its case. “See? I knew you could play well.”
"I'm dull and I smell like disinfectant and yet here I am," John pointed out. He pinched the ends of the torn skin together, judging the severity of depth. As he first thought, not so bad, it wouldn't need stitches.
Scarlett squinted at him, that same judging-but-found-lacking stare, but didn’t comment again. John should have been concerned but, again, they were reaching the end of their time together, so it hardly mattered.
“Chemistry, yes.” Though he’d not be utilizing his degree the way John probably thought. More footwork than labwork, if all went according to plan. Which it would, because Sherlock was a genius.
They stared at each other until she cracked, and they both laughed. Irene really was quite lovely. White Oleander - beautiful but poisonous.
“Well yeah. What other kind-“ John’s eyes widened as the realization of what Sherlock had initially assumed became clear.
John went on to explain, “Not everyone would stick around after being threatened with a blowtorch, you know.”
“It’s like you said, I don’t let anyone close. Just. You.” He waited for John to respond, and when John couldn’t he went on. “If you can’t figure out what that means, you really are an idiot.”
Sherlock stood up suddenly, John following on his heels, turning to watch Sherlock pace into the sitting room, hand in his hair.
“I don’t know what I thought I was doing, coming here. You obviously haven’t forgiven me, not really.”
“It’s an experimental cocktail of drugs ensured to ‘show me a good time’. Or so he said.” He thumbed his nose casually but it was enough of a hint that it made John’s stomach drop. This kid was messing around with real shit.
It takes Sherlock a moment to answer. John starts a rhythmic brush of his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. It smells of his cheap, corner shop shampoo and he has to wonder what his hair smells like when he’s at home.
John grinned down at him, a look of supreme satisfaction as he whispered in Sherlock's ear. "Good luck finding your nicotine patches."
Sherlock couldn’t get up the stairs by himself just then but John decided to be the bigger man by not pointing that out.
Slowly, with gentle pressure on his shoulders and hip, John turned Sherlock onto his stomach. He reverently placed kisses in Sherlock’s hair, causing shivers to raise gooseflesh along Sherlock’s back and thighs. Down he went, next kissing wetly at Sherlock’s neck, nipping more gently now but still with that hint of teeth that curled Sherlock’s toes. Next he placed both hands across the span of Sherlock’s back and ran his thumbs deeply into the muscles along his spine, causing a pleased growl to escape from Sherlock.
Sherlock took the glass with hardly a second glance. His attention was on the kitchen staff, or seemed to be.
“That was one of the most dangerous men you’ll ever meet and not our problem anymore,” Sherlock growled as he scattered the parts with the toe of his shoe. “
Sherlock hesitated when they reached the crossroads. Left would take him back toward the tube line, and on to Baker Street. Right was toward the clinic where John was headed. He wasn’t sure of his welcome and didn’t want to intrude on the rest of John’s night uninvited and end up looking as pathetic as he felt.
Once it was clean as it was going to get, John chucked the rag under the sink, knowing full well Sherlock would never look under there since it was full of nothing but cleaning supplies. Mrs. Hudson on the other hand…
“Oh,” John chuckled despite himself. “You want me to rally some ex’s together to give testimony?” He shook his head and laughed again. “You’re ridiculous.”
He surreptitiously glanced up at Sherlock through his eyelashes as he sat as well. He didn’t look flushed, which would have been obvious on his pale face, but then again, he’d been hidden away for quite a while.
“Mmm, it wasn’t hard, really. Sort of a ballad actually. The band sounded familiar but I couldn’t tell you the name. I don’t know anyone who listens to that kind of music.”
“That thing we were discussing before I left… Still sound like a plan? Sherlock? Hey.” He flicked Sherlock in the nose.
“I’ll email you as soon as I hear back from him. Meanwhile, you’ve a paper due on Cell Regeneration,” he reminded with a look over top of his glasses.
"You know when he came to me to help with the stag do, he had an entire folder of notes on John. He'd glued a cut-out of John's head to Da vinci's Vitruvian Man," Molly informed them with barely restrained hysteria. "I nearly wet myself when I saw it. I might have if it hadn't been so sad."
John sat back against the sofa, deflated and drained. “She didn’t used to be like that,” he mumbled. He’d lost feeling in his lower jaw about four shots ago and his stomach was roiling in protest of the last one.
"I should think that was obvious," he stated dryly and then wedged his long thigh between John's legs.
“Sherlock,” John repeated, as if that were much better, “do you do palms or…” He let the question trail off, getting a lot more apprehensive by the second.
John fell into it, eyes closed, no real attempt at technique. Somewhere along the way he started feeling everything he’d worked hard not to these last few weeks. The way his stomach clenched when Sherlock shut him out, how hollow he felt when he heard Sherlock puttering on downstairs as John lay in bed, that ache when he thought of something he’d liked to have shared with Sherlock but was unsure of his welcome. He was so tired, so bloody tired of denying himself, holding his tongue, pulling back when he wanted to run headlong into oblivion. Did John not deserve love? Didn’t Sherlock? Maybe John should try harder to make his desires clear…
John’s nose scrunched up adorably. “Are you really hung up on the pronouns? For Christ’s sake, ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone, this house just ain’t no home.’ Who do I live with, Sherlock? C’mon, I thought you were a detective.”
When the couple got up, Sherlock dove for the floor and hoped his coat shrouded him from the soft lighting of the aisle way. Once the coast was clear, he followed behind, mixing with the heavy crowd outside, until they rounded the corner toward the trendy restaurants on Holly Hill. Sherlock nearly intervened when Laiya stopped at an expensive Greek eatery, and John’s fingers flexed against his jeans. Didn’t she know he hated Greek? Didn’t she care? And to have no concern for his budget, unforgivable!
John had a class today at eight, and despite only rolling into bed around four, he was already up for the day. Sherlock could hear him puttering around in the sitting room. He didn’t want to go out but his insatiable curiosity got the better of him, as always.
“I asked you to put away the… enlarged pancreas,” John guessed, to which Sherlock inclined his head, “since you know very well that Laila is on her way up for our study session. You were, oh-so-conveniently ignoring me.”
Sherlock blinked at him as if he'd been talking out of a second, much dumber head. "Is your self esteem really so bad you'd deny us both the pleasure simply to save yourself the imagined slight against you?"
“Yeah, unfortunately. It’s been worse though. Anytime you’ve climbed a fence in front of me in the summer it’s like my brain goes off line and has to reboot.” When a tiny line appears between Sherlock’s brows, John elaborates, “No coat on. You’re bum is just
John stared at Sherlock as if he’d suggested John chew up the book and ingest the information that way.
"Course I do. You didn't even need Sherlock and me to save you. Smart as a tack, hiding your mobile like you did." She waves John off with a chuckle. "You were much shorter then. What the hell has your mum been feeding you?" He teases.
“I would have thought you’d be happy to see me.” He brushed past John with a whisper of wool on silk. “You’ve been awaiting this day for years after all. All the paperwork is accounted for.” He slapped a briefcase down onto the table. Sherlock glanced at it but his attention was quickly back on John’s girlfriend.
John scowled, but it was a teasing thing, and Sherlock’s stomach flipped at the sight of it. He curbed his answering smirk and instead shuffled towards the untouched plate of biscuits, just for something to do with his hands.
"Are you kidding?" He looked down incredulously. "I couldn't be more prepared if a team of footballers had gone in before you."
“It is your forte after all, bravo, but a willing throat doesn’t need to stick around after I’m done with it.”
John crawled forward, planted a soft kiss to the nape of Sherlock’s sweaty neck, and then moved back down.
"You don't have to. It's not like you don't know what happened, you were there. Just thought you'd like a chance to critique. If you were bored."
“It would look bad on a housing application,” Sherlock mumbled. “Switching locations three times in one year.”
"One low life thug who won't be kidnapping girls and selling them on the sex slave market," Sally pointed out.
“Fine, but I still don’t understand and you know I don’t like not understanding, John.” He crossed his arms and huffed.
"It's obvious, now that I know what I'm looking at," Sherlock said. "Think John. Janine remind you of anyone? How many other Irish brunettes have we known who would want to see your scheming wife put a bullet in your head?"
That was it. Not even signed, the bastard. John didn’t care how he’d known about the break-up with Mary, it was probably obvious to a guy like that. John just wanted to know his damn name!  Was that so much to ask? If the bloke wasn’t interested that was fine, he supposed, but for him to know John’s name when he hadn’t shared the same courtesy, it galled.  And he’d broken into John’s room while he slept, which was… well, it was kind of impressive actually. Especially when he hadn’t his lock picking set at the time.
It was good he'd come to Sherlock now before he actually got his hands on a patient. The recitation was enough
“Though I’m sure you possess many fine qualities a serial killer would look for in a victim, I’m sorry to say, nobody will be killing anyone tonight. At least not here,” he allowed with a tip of his head.
Mary gets up from her chair and moves to sit in his lap. He takes her weight and tries not to frown when she goes into 'Mum Mode', with her stern frown and her 'take no attitude' voice.
Sherlock slunk back down, petulant to the end, and remained silent. There was a chance, John wasn’t sure, the lighting wasn’t the best in their corner of the room, but Sherlock might have been blushing. He stayed curled half away though, silent and sullen. John most assuredly did not use the time to study the curve of Sherlock’s waist to hip ratio.
Sherlock made a noise, a self-satisfied noise in John’s opinion, but when John looked up with a glare, Sherlock was glancing - flirtatiously - at Victor. It was possible John bent the handle of his fork with his thumb.
"What?" Sherlock asked and whipped his head to the side to see. His head fell as he noted the caller. "Ignore it."
to win, so Sherlock would give up the idea that he needed to train him. That way lay madness. Daily sparring matches? He’d never survive.
“Let's just worry about it tomorrow, yeah?" She ran a hand back into his hair and hummed some quiet song into John's ear. If he wasn't still incredibly drunk and emotionally exhausted, he probably would have protested the coddling. But it did feel nice, relaxing.
A part of John, the devious, selfish part, knew Sherlock was going to be brilliant at taking his cock, and most likely love every minute of it. Ever since he'd first found that bundle of nerves inside, Sherlock had been keen as could be. He wasn't shy, he rocked back, forcing John to accommodate the angle to the detective's specifications. And every time they ended up like this John came a little bit closer to giving in. It was hard not to, the way Sherlock was writhing like a damn cat in heat all over the bed. He could only imagine what it would be like, his prick enveloped inside while Sherlock rode out his orgasm, oblivious to anything but his own pleasure the way he did. Maybe that's why he hesitated to give Sherlock what he wanted. This had so far been mostly a 'my turn and then your turn' sort of affair, with the exception of the frotting incident 'The morning after', and hadn't that been the most emotional either one of them had gotten? They loved each other, he knew they did, but taking that last step felt like consummating it. You and me, forever more, no take backs. So why wasn't he rushing to lock it down? Maybe he still didn't believe Sherlock could want him forever. That was it really. There wasn't any practical reason not to, he'd had them both tested the day after they'd woken up on the floor together, and even if one of them hadn't been clean, it would have hardly mattered, they would have just worn condoms. He probably should have thought of that before he decided to gag himself on Sherlock's cock that first night, but in his defense, he'd been drunk and Sherlock did have one beautiful cock. It wasn't his fault.
“I can work with this,” he mused, toying the opening wider with a quick scissoring motion, one he knew Sherlock liked.
As Sherlock stood from the table, John noted Greg made to stand as well, but Molly put a hand to his arm and shook her head. He sat back down and they put their heads back together, as if conspiring. Conspiring towards what, John had no idea, but it seemed likely to end in John's embarrassment.
He stood from the table, wishing he didn’t have to use the cane to brace himself. “You shouldn’t have said those things.”
"As I was saying," Sherlock continued, "esteemed guests, thank you for coming together to celebrate the blessed union of Mary Elizabeth and John Hamish Watson."
Sherlock gave a great sigh and reluctantly let go. John immediately scrambled to the door and disappeared inside the loo. John did indeed evacuate his bladder, and Sherlock decided to use the time to parse how he felt about John staying the night, and the activities there in.  It didn’t take long.
Sherlock’s eyes go wide and then slam shut on a shocked cry. “Fuck!” He snarls and then John feels hot, liquid pulse against him, onto him, mixed between their bellies as they continue to writhe.
, I guess. But I like it." She shrugs and looks back down at her boots as she paws at the floor with her toe.
What would John be like as a romantic partner, with Sherlock particularly? Would they hold hands? Would John shy away from public kissing? Did Sherlock even
Scarlett helped him shuffle forward and sat heavily with him in the cold metal seat. “See? That wasn’t so bad.”
John shoved Sherlock’s arm away and marched toward the stairs. Instead of getting out the front door, as he’d intended, John found himself snatched up and shoved toward his bedroom. He tried to argue but one look at Laila’s face had him shuffling meekly upward.
Was he going for casual? If so, he was failing. Sherlock wasn’t meant to have remembered their first encounter, he had to keep that in mind. Apparently this was John Watson fishing for clues as to his welcome. So what did Sherlock do with this? He wanted to snatch John up right there and snog him senseless, but he hadn’t yet decided if that was a good idea. Being around John, it was thrilling and new and John was a delightful puzzle he’d yet to fully put together, but he was also terrified if he took that step again, they would consume each other. It would be so easy. Not to mention, though he hadn’t the slightest idea about relationships in general, he knew he’d never be satisfied with anything casual with John. And since that seemed to be all John was capable of recently, there was no question that’s all he’d receive. So what to do? What to say?
And that's all she wrote folks. For all you curious cats, there's a SMALL chance I could do a follow up to this story, I've got the bare bones of an idea, BUT I make no promises. I've got seven unfinished stories rn as it is, and several more ideas floating, so don't expect anything anytime soon.
With absolutely no thought on John’s part he snapped, “Look, I’m pissed, I’m angry and I’m horny, so why don’t you just shut up and finish your damn experiment already.”
John pulled the memory of Mary writhing in David’s lap and looked her in the eye when he stated, quite plainly, “If you love me at all, yeah, you should be worried.” Her eyes widened at that but he kept on. “Seeing as I don’t believe you’ve loved me for some time now, I’m not all that worried for you.”
Suddenly, Donovan burst through the front door. "Sir, he escaped. They lost him behind the refinery, somewhere in the ship yard."
“Afraid that’s it for you, mate.” He walked the thrashing man to the tent entrance, nodded at Bree to open for him and then launched the man forward with a shove. “Go on!” He yelled with a point, brooking no further arguments.
“Look,” John snapped, “if you wanted something else, someone else, you should have told me. We might have been able to work on it. It’s too late now. I’d like to say I’m sorry this happened but… the sad part is… I’m not.”
Before John could demand a teasing explanation, he found himself grasped about the side of the head by one Sherlock Holmes. The whole of his vision was taken up by pale skin and very blue eyes; John's own swam as he tried to focus on them.
She looked ready to throttle him and he had no idea if it was still an act or not. “I never want to see you again, John,” she repeated with a not-so-subtle head tilt toward Sherlock.
The tension seemed to bleed out of his body and he was left with a smiling Sherlock, patiently waiting for the next step. John had seen that smile before. On the tarmac as they’d waited to say goodbye. Just before everything had gone tits up with Mary, and then Mycroft’s scheming.
Slowly, cautiously, as if the man might bite, he slid his hand across the table. By the time Sherlock reached out for it, John was already annoyed at his knowing smirk, that small half smile that stated he was amused by John’s caution.
There was a cramp in John's stomach that refused to go away. He shoved his fist against it and took a few steadying breaths. Tears burned behind his eyes but he refused to let them fall. He’d be goddamned.
John was so caught up in his confusion he didn’t even ask why the restaurant was wary of Sherlock to begin with.
, he has Mrs. Hudson spying on me at all hours. Not that I have anything to hide but it’s the principle of the thing.”
John nipped at him and laughingly said, “You’d remember if they’d done a good job. Is it all right?”
“John! John, John, John,” Sherlock cried out, gripping John’s shoulders, head, neck, everywhere he could reach as he squirmed.
“Humble too,” John quipped, settling into his chair. “Anyway, that’s not what I meant. I was talking about you talking me into being your flatmate.”
“He’s not as bright as my mother,” John frowned at this, “but they compliment each other. He’s… lovable?”
“I don’t suppose you have the paper on Cell Regeneration,” Gregson drawled. It was clear he didn't hold out much hope.
“Never,” John struggled to voice despite his startling lack of air. He thrashed but it only caused Sherlock to pull back harder. John was starting to understand that Sherlock wasn’t going to let go until John either surrendered or passed out. So he surrendered his dignity instead, and snatched Sherlock by his hair.
With a Sherlockian growl, John rushed after them, slowing as he approached the darkened hall where they stood. John stopped at the corner, round the bend from the loos. There was a convenient alcove tucked into the outside wall and John made use of it, snuggling behind a potted plant. Whether consciously or not, the two men had stopped close enough to the main lobby for John to just make out their conversation.
John didn’t turn to look. “Is he drinking?” Dread coursed through his veins. Technically he couldn’t stop Sherlock from drinking if he chose, he could only stop him if he became belligerent.
He held up a hand, unable to even look at Sherlock in that moment. “I need time. Just… give me some time.”
"It didn't hurt. It tickled," he snapped, annoyed. He rubbed a hand over his leg as if rubbing the sensation away.
“Yeah, Andrei Bokarov, his prints were in the system for burglary and assault. Apparently there was no real love lost between the two men, he was just closer at the time Petrov’s call went out.”
The loo was empty by the time he followed behind, and John only briefly wondered at it. He splashed a bit of water on his face, lightly smacked himself in an attempt to sober up, and then quit the still hopping club.
to be if they were going to continue to have any sort of tutor/student relationship. He’d have to work on that.
“Um, sure, yeah, I guess,” John finally answered, just as Sherlock was about to pull the offer entirely.
John looked over at that and then saw fit to finish the rest of his ale. God, he couldn't be more transparent if he tried.
John scrunched his face up in frustration. “God damn you,” he growled. Sherlock gave him a ‘Well?’ look and John shoved him. “Go, before I sell
Guilt was a heavy stone in his gut, dragging him down further and further until he could barely breathe. Why had he thought tonight was a good idea? He knew Sherlock did drugs, hard drugs at that, and he still encouraged Sherlock to smoke with him. Obviously weed wasn’t the worst they could have done, but he’d still willingly forgotten that first night, knowing damn well that Sherlock had no qualms about partaking in even the shadiest of circumstances. John had not only encouraged, he’d
And why didn’t she believe the rest that came after? Possibly because he’d impugned her honor, but he’d actually not said anything that Bill hadn’t said that first night.
Greg's brain chugged along faster than one would assume, considering the amount of alcohol he'd already ingested before the reception and during, piecing an idea together in seconds of its inception.
“I know.” He could hear the smile in her statement. She ran a hand through his hair and hummed casually in thought. “So what did you think?”
John started shaking again. “You remember that night I got pissed and tried to make you watch that American film with the sharks in the tornados? That, probably.” Sherlock came in close and John started babbling. “Or why stop there? Could cause bears to descend en masse from the upper troposphere. The Plague will take out more of Europe than it did the last time, this time with zombies. Giant bats could mmmmffffff-”
Sherlock’s face did something almost feral, clearly not happy with the summons, but he broke eye contact to follow, stealing one more sausage before he walked away.
A thousand apologies if you were expecting more smut in this chapter. None to be found here, sorry. Sherlock is much more into keeping his wits about him around John. And impressing him with his intelligence, of course, which is why I included a tiny case. Hope you like.
“I count it as a plus, really,” he replied with a moan. He started undoing the buttons on his shirt, all the while staring John down like a freight train. “Now, what was all that about us becoming something more than fine?”
“Did you see these?” He flipped quickly, so fast Sherlock barely had time to see, but what he saw was enough. “The drunker I got, the more creative I got.”
John, without hesitation, snatched Sherlock’s arm and slapped his hand against the bulge in his trousers, molding his fingers around its girth. Sherlock couldn’t remember being so thrilled, except perhaps the night John, with even less prompting, had swallowed his cock like Sallementro.
“The roommate called about an hour ago, says Laila has skipped classes before, even called off work but never both and never without letting someone know why. The room looks clean but-“
“Um, no, I suppose not. I don’t know why, not much to tell, I guess.” He finished off his now cold tea and stood to put the mug up. Sherlock hadn’t finished his so John left it be.
“There,” John said as he set the last of it down, “that should be enough for now. Sit up a bit, drink some of this water.”
He leapt up, scrambling to pull himself from the floor, to reach the medicine cabinet. He pulled the mirror open so hard it hit the wall and bounced back. Snarling, he held it back until he could catalog the contents of the shelf.
They pull up to Sherlock’s rental, hidden behind a billboard a few miles down the road. John feels the inevitable separation coming like a solid weight in his stomach. He goes to open the door, at least shake Sherlock’s hand before he goes, but to his surprise, Sherlock stops him.
“Promise me you'll let me finish, without interrupting." John obviously didn't want to agree, in fact he opened his mouth to argue but Sherlock cut him off. “Please, I can't properly explain if you fight me at every turn."
“Hey,” some random bloke cried out when John snatched his shot and downed it. He continued on toward a red plastic cooler and grabbed the first can his hand touched. He cracked it open and downed it in one go. The bloke started to walk towards him but one look from John, as he wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, turned the kid round again.
“You’re half right. Your brother would scowl over my casket until I rose again, just to scold me for leaving you alone.”
Sherlock flipped though the cards, seeming to reject several parts. "John this, John that. Oh, here's another story about
“Harrow Boys Champion, four years running,” he answered, hand on his back, pipe in the air waving jovially.
“Apparently,” Sherlock replied absently, more aware of the sensation John caused, than the conversation.
After he failed to respond to John’s question, the man quit the room in a huff. Just as well. John was too distracting in his sleep attire anyway.
“Hey,” Miller steps forward, “I could blow those smart brains out right now, Lillian be damned, is that what you want? It’ll ruin that fancy hairdo for sure.”
Sherlock was wide awake. Terrifyingly awake. He looked down, even though he knew John was tucked up against him, his head pillowed against his ribs, just above the jut of his hip. His mouth gaped unattractively at John’s tufts of hair. He didn’t even remember falling asleep!
Again, they both groaned when John’s arse finally landed in Sherlock’s lap. He stayed there for a moment, clearly adjusting to the feeling of being totally filled, while Sherlock merely sat there like a stunned creature in the presence of a predator.
John scoffed and pulled back to look Sherlock in the eye. “I’ve been protecting you from the first, what makes you think that would ever change?”
“Good morning, dear,” Mrs. Hudson greeted John. Sherlock flinched even though he was well away from being caught out. “Oh, you didn’t sleep on the sofa, did you? Terrible for your back.”
He rushes John, backing him into the far wall, near the entrance, but John easily reverses their positions, ramming him right back. Curls shake as John rattles him, and he notes absently how completely incongruous they are with the rest of him. Long lines, sharp angles, snarls and scowls, but then those riotous, soft-looking ringlets edging his face. Ridiculous.
He’d been having so much fun, Sherlock had nearly forgotten the reason behind John sitting on top of him.
He’d have to get the name of that PC in Lestrade’s office. Perhaps send him a fruit basket. That was, if not the best sex they’d ever had, certainly the most memorable. John would come to agree in time.
John grins in fondness and looks away. When he looks back he answers, "It's Monday the eighth....of March."
He curled into himself on the sofa, knees tucked up close to his chest, and refused to breathe. It nearly worked, but the will to survive overrode his stubborn attempt at asphyxia, and he took an involuntary gasp. Blasted respiratory system. Desolation almost got the better of him, until pride broke through and demanded its fair share.
"But he hasn't taken a case in weeks," Greg concluded with a nod, making his point that something was wrong.
“You should probably go to hospital,” John mumbled absently. “Lord knows what else that stuff was laced with.”
Sherlock glared at John as if he’d committed high treason. The magazine went flying and Sherlock sat forward in his seat, weaving a bit, but staring John down.
“I mean it, Sherlock, not even a tie will be misplaced or any and all sexual activities will be rescinded indefinitely. I’m not putting up with whatever that brain of yours can come up with, especially if it’s malicious.”
Sherlock growled in frustration, apparently having had enough, and brought his knee up, hard, into John’s soft bits.
“Oh, all right, yes. I’ll…” He trailed off when it became apparent that Mycroft was leaving. “What the hell was that?” He asked Sherlock as soon as Mycroft’s lumbering arse passed the doorway.
“Sherlock, I’m not... I’m not straight.” He stared down at the table but when no response came he looked up.
John went above and beyond the call of duty when he swiftly knocked the owner to the ground with a shove to his sternum, and then off they went.
John blinks at the mad man on his bed. The practically-naked-except-for-the-laptop-in-his-lap mad man on his bed. Instead of indulging Sherlock’s lunacy, John instead ops to grab his bag and move it to the opposite bed, all the while he can practically feel Sherlock’s pout aimed at his back as he one-handed pulls his pants and vest from it.
“Oh, I know, dear, but I thought you could both enjoy it together. That’s safe enough, isn’t it?” She asked, innocence embodied.
John touched base with Lestrade, promising he’d get the details from Sherlock and pass them along, before marching at a quick clip after his infuriating flatmate.  He’d steadfastly ignored the twinkle in Sally’s eye as she’d nodded along to John’s words to Greg. Sergeant Donovan always had been waiting for a domestic to blow up at a crime scene, and Sherlock had finally delivered. Perhaps if Sherlock hadn’t seemed so personally invested in John’s perceived hetero status, Sally wouldn’t be biting back an ‘I-told-you-so’ grin.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums in agreement. “Enough that I wish it truly were 1992, if only for the shorter refractory period.”
“Speechless?” John teased. His mouth opened and closed comically and John laughed. “It’s all right, love. I can think of a better use for your lips than talking.”
He remembered the anger, the self-disgust, the blind rage that had him tearing up the stairs to what he had already deemed ‘John’s room’ in his mind so he could do physically to the room what he couldn’t do to his own mind, which was to tear it apart.
John’s eyebrow rose, a look Sherlock had never seen directed at him before. “Wouldn’t you like to find out.”
“You’re lucky you were smart enough to keep your finger off the trigger,” he said conversationally. “I could have broken it. Sherlock, tell him to get on the ground.”
“Nothing, dear. Did you decide on an appetizer?” She twirled a strand of hair around her finger innocently and smiled wide.
sister. Only I can call her a bitch. And she is, a bitch that is. Crazy as well, I don’t mind saying. I don’t mind a bitchy woman, you know, but she’s crazy too. It’s a bad combination, crazy and bitchy. Trust me.”
John pulled Laila closer and fell back into the bed with her. She didn't protest, she simply kicked her shoes off, tugged her coat off, and pulled the blanket over their heads.
“Um,” John nervously licked his lips, a trait Sherlock was coming to abhor, “Introduction to Biology.”
“Agh!” John heard Sherlock's cry, muffled against the sound of his own pulse, and then suddenly he was free to suck in great lungfuls of air. He was dizzy with the influx of oxygen, so he didn’t quite register that Sherlock had thrown him to the side and had scrambled away until he heard a door slam down the hall.
“Maybe,” Sherlock stopped and cleared his throat, tried again. “Perhaps just one glass. Would be a shame to waste such an expensive gift.”
"Oh, Christ," he called out when Sherlock started learning tricks. He'd applied John's head sensitivity when giving oral sex to their current activity and had risen up until his tightest muscles clamped John like a vise. He grinned like a fiend as John cursed him to perdition.
He had a bliss filled moment of observing that sight before his eyes closed on his own orgasm. He squeezed Sherlock in his grip for what seemed like hours before collapsing on top in a grunt. His face pressed into the crook of Sherlock's neck and he rubbed contently against sweaty curls. Neither moved, just learned to breath normally again, until Sherlock squirmed and John pulled out of him with a groan.
“I assure you, Lillian has contracted me to follow you and report back on anything I find. You’re a hard man to track,” Sherlock admits.
Nonetheless, he’d gotten his point across. Ms. Adler had been an interloper in their established dynamic and John was not as appreciative of her antics as Sherlock had been.
John sniffed. “I used to fight my sister over the telly remote. Watch out, I might pull your hair next.”
He'd expected immediate denial from John, considering his data was ill begotten and likely tainted by wishful thinking.
“Ah, dammit. I give up! Chemistry is bollocks!” Her voice broke and she sniffed pitifully. Another second went by in silence before she started gathering up her things.
“So,” John says conversationally as he works, “did you see the painted desert? I saw you at that exit just outside.”
Six weeks later, John found, despite his motivation to go Pre-Med and show Mary how wrong she was, he was failing Biology and his professors had started noticing his drinking. He’d already been reprimanded once that week for coming to class hung over and had his priorities questioned.
The kid looked like he didn’t believe him, so John proved his willingness by snatching the bloke by the front of his hooded zip-up and mashed their lips together in an intoxicated mess. It took some doing, but they found a rhythm that went from exploratory to heated to predatory in quick succession. John pushed and pulled until the boy was flat on his back on top of the coats. They were laying the wrong way in the bed but John couldn’t care less. Any apprehension John might have felt went out the window as soon as those full lips met his thin ones. His enthusiasm seemed to gain traction by the second.
Sherlock didn't miss a beat after John started to piston into him. His back arched in pleasure and he clawed at John in an attempt to pull him in closer, harder. He laced their fingers together and made damn sure Sherlock's cock was snuggly pressed between them as he shoved into him. He had moments left, bare seconds, before he finished, and he'd be damned if he went before Sherlock did. His lips found his lover's and he poured every bit of satisfied longing into his kiss, tried to say with skin what he couldn't say with words. It seemed to work, as Sherlock tore away on a gasp.
"Christ, Sherlock, you have to know. You're one of the smartest men in the world, how can you not know?"
Fingernails scraped fabric and Sherlock found his head tilting to the left to study John’s white-knuckled grip on the chair.
John yanked himself away, mumbled about Sherlock having a Mary Poppins bag for a coat and shuffled off, hands in his pockets.
“Nonsense. If you couldn’t breathe, you’d not be able to talk. You’re a doctor, I would have thought you’d know that.” He ran his nose into John’s hair and snuffled at the sensation.
Once the ride was over and they were let off, and John once again had his wretched cane in hand, they made their way toward the food vendors. Everything smelled amazing and his mouth watered at the decadent choices around them. But his stomach also gave a sick lurch, nausea mixed with hunger pains, reminding him that he hadn’t eaten properly in…well, a long time. Perhaps he’d hold off on the toffee apple; it would probably give him an upset stomach anyway.
“I never wanted to before,” Sherlock answers. Simplistic but to him it must have seemed good enough.
“I’m certain I can swing it,” he said after a beat, pen tapping the newly signed papers. “I’ll see that Molly gets the body. There won’t be anyone to dispute the desecration of the corpse, no family to speak of and as far as Bokarov tells it, not many within the group liked him to begin with. They were probably on their way to taking him out themselves to be honest. Sounds like he was messy, bound to get them caught sooner or later.”
The wait is finally over, it seems. Sherlock makes the first move before John can finish his thoughts and then new ones emerge in their place.
“This,” Sherlock whispered and then pulled John forward until their lips crashed together. Sometimes, if he wasn’t careful, Sherlock’s full lips would completely over power his own. John couldn’t have that. He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s coat and took over the kiss, hungry still, since leaving the flat without satisfaction. But, really, would he ever be truly finished kissing Sherlock Holmes?
Sherlock smiles down at him, softly, something he’s never seen before, and John’s heart swells. If he doubted Sherlock’s reciprocation before, he doesn’t now.
Sherlock follows the 'happy' couple to the pub, knowing fair well a showdown is going to happen. To the victor goes the spoils and Sherlock is prepared to win at all costs.
His head snapped down to stare at John, who immediately looked away. “Oh,” he huffed stupidly. “I suppose it’s not exactly a term of endearment, is it?”
He panted hard when Sherlock started pushing downward in earnest. "I'm not. I'm really not." His abdominals burned with the effort of keeping his hips still as Sherlock worked at easing him in.
“If you’re truly concerned, I wouldn’t pull up the carpets,” Sherlock announces, causing John to groan at the bedspread. “I’m going to study the local hyphae.”
John glanced back up from staring at Victor’s hands again to frown at Sherlock. “I’ll order for myself, thank you.”
Sally ignored him. "Says here he works the late shift at the refinery. He might not know we've found him yet."
"That didn't take long," Greg noted upon his return, over-riding Donovan’s “Some canvasing.” John glanced back then to see Sherlock trudging behind him, an aura of Charlie Brown-esque dejection around his shoulders. They made eye contact and he stiffened up.
“What the fuck?” Miller exclaims when Sherlock hands him the cuffs without looking, meeting Oliver halfway.
It was from Lestrade, the only Campus Security guard who allowed Sherlock in on campus business. He was actually a Metro police officer but he supplemented his income with weekend guard duty. His two year beat probation was nearly up and then he’d be promoted to detective. Sherlock was hedging his bets with the man, certain he’d let Sherlock in on cases,
“No,” John drawled, and then, moving to their chairs and tossing the bag on the table, continued, “I’m making you share with the class.”
“I have to… I’ll just be a minute.” He got up awkwardly, seemingly unwilling to leave after such a debacle. “You’ll still wait, right?”
Everyone, including John and the man he’d been subtly chatting up when Sherlock had heard John correct the man’s assumption, had gone silent and just stared.
Donovan answered the question while Greg started the car. "She gave us enough. They found the van she described just west of his last known location and we canvased the neighborhood but haven't found anything."
John squeezes the leg between his thighs and runs his thumb over the ridges of Sherlock’s ribs. “Oh, it isn’t?”
Greg scowled at the ground. "We know how Sherlock feels. I think we've all seen evidence of that since his return." He looked to the two women for conformation and they nodded solemnly.
Sherlock’s brain ran through several different scenarios in which he could get John to punish him sexually, seven of which had a high likelihood of being successful, three of which might cause permanent harm to the flat.
“Answer me now or I’ll assume you’re one of Oliver’s and I’ll collapse your windpipe and leave you here to suffocate.”
"Suppose he wanted to collect some sort of insurance check or something," John mumbles after the waitress checks on them and leaves again.
He continued to wipe at the blood that pooled in Sherlock's lower back. The cut looked shallow but Sherlock's blood was so thin it continued to drip from the wound at a steady pace, staining his white shirt and now the blue sheet of their bed as he flung himself to and fro. He glared up at his...whatever the hell Sherlock was...though he couldn't see it, and thought the next time Sherlock jumped a fence and landed on a piece of broken glass he'd leave him to his fate. John wiped gently at the surrounding area of the laceration, the abhorrent mark on his pristine white flesh, and shook his head.
“I think it’s cool, you know,” the kid muttered. “You being bi. Shattering stereotypes and that." He chuckled. "My ex, George McCall, said you broke his heart last night. I think you're my new hero.”
A half hour passed as he puzzled out John’s motives. The dorm had quieted for the night, and it had been a while since anyone had passed the hall. He uncurled from his perch on the stairs and risked walking forward toward John’s room again.
“The answer is zero. I had sucked exactly zero cocks before yours that night. If you ask me how many men I’d kissed before that night the answer would be the same. Or even how many men I’d wanted to kiss, how many men I’d ever been sexually attracted to - zero.”
“That moment where the girl you like, or bloke I suppose, finally asked you out. You know, you hang up the phone and then roll around on your bed having a fit.”
John didn’t know why he knew it was his friend’s, but he did. It was dramatic and posh and, most important, still here. Considering the rush the bloke had been in to escape last night that evidence alone was pretty telling.
John bit the inside of his cheek not to smirk at her morning after attire. Sweats, hair knotted at the nape of her neck, make-up smeared. He wasn’t laughing
Sherlock gave a wan smile. “Let’s just say my motivation for helping campus security has never been to make friends.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, unable to articulate how sorry he was, only able to pull him forward to squeeze him tight to his chest. “Is it better now? Are we okay?”
John chuckled at Sherlock’s blatant curiosity. “I wasn’t. Bill was. Or I should say, Bill was not, since not one of them would cross the threshold until the custodian cleared it all out. They weren’t even used.” He scoffed again at the fragile idiots.
Sherlock sat up fully at this, a concerned pucker to his brow as he stared John down “You’re right, John. Think of the ways a sniper could utilize such a vehicle!”
John knows his face is conveying just what being called out has done to him when Greg looks ready to backtrack, so he does the only thing he can and simply walks away.
"He's showing off, you great idiot. He's almost always sporting beard burn when I see you two, but does he cover it up to save me the embarrassment of seeing it? Hell no. Cause he wants people to see. He thinks everyone is as observant as he is in this. I might have noticed but apparently you didn't." Greg smiled like a proud parent.
“This is mad,” John mumbled. “I need to check for a pulse.” He moved to press two fingers to his wrist but Sherlock smacked his arm away.
Before he could summon a reply, John’s mobile rang out from his coat pocket. He fished it out, saw that it was Laila, and turned to mumble, “I’ve got to take this.”
She scrunched her nose in disgust at the goat idea. “No, thank you. If it’s fake it would be a waste of time and if it was real I’d just cry probably.”
Sherlock’s answering grin lights a fuse in John’s stomach. He really needs to get control of that, before he does something irreparable, like lean in and snog the man senseless. He doesn’t even know if Sherlock is single, let alone if he likes blokes. He could come out and ask but, from experience, John knows that can backfire. Is it even possible to be subtle with Sherlock? He very much doubts it.
“Yes,” he drawled in response, hand in the air for a taxi. John looked both hesitant and begrudgingly impressed by Sherlock’s London Magic when one appeared. “Still interested?”
subtle? He hadn’t meant to be; he’d been giving John a chance to get used to the idea, building familiarity before broaching the subject of a relationship. They wanted each other, he
Sherlock grinned happily as John got his trousers and pants down around his ankles. Luckily John couldn’t see it, smashed into the back of the sofa as Sherlock was, but he must have sensed it anyway.
John had, never in his life, he swore, ever been a jealous person, but, fuck, if Sherlock didn’t bring it out in him.
Sherlock glanced up and stopped mid-sentence, his eyes glued to the stranger leant against their front door. There was a pause in his step, John noted, and they slowed their approach; John mirroring Sherlock’s steps, not yet understanding the reason.
Sherlock hesitated, unsure why there was a tension between them now. “Thank you,” he eventually said again, for lack of anything better to say.
, looked very tempting indeed. He clamped down, harder than before, and immediately had to let go when Sherlock bucked up and away with a shout. John laughed at the affronted look sent his way.
Baker Street has stopped feeling like a tomb since Sherlock's return. One would almost venture to say it begins to feel a bit like coming home again when he crosses the threshold. Which in turn makes John a bit ill when he reminds himself this is no longer his home; that he's chosen to make a new home, with Mary.
Something had shifted in the silence, something John couldn’t see, because the next thing he heard, from startlingly near Sherlock’s seat, was Victor’s voice.
John hissed as he crossed the threshold and freezing rain hit him right in the face. He also had to be twice as careful stepping down from the stoop, as the pavement was covered in a fine coating of ice pellets.
John processed this, blinking around the room, possibly in embarrassment, Sherlock wasn’t sure, before moving to stand.
The teen in question looked on in inexplicable terror. Sherlock tilted his head, about to ask why, when the father stood from his seat. Sherlock had failed to note the rapidly engorging blood vessels in the man’s face.
“You left and all I knew was pain and regret. For never telling you exactly how much you meant to me. For calling you a machine in my anger. Can you comprehend how terrifying it is to think yourself in love with someone incapable of feeling? I know better, I knew better then, but believing you incapable then was easier than believing the problem lay with me. If you couldn’t feel, you were at fault, not some inadequacy in me.” John receives a blink at that, but still silence. “But it still hurt, the futility. After, I told myself if you’d known the truth, if I had just said something before Moriarty got to you, maybe you wouldn’t have… I don’t know. It’s pointless to speculate now. You were gone and I was gone with you. I died with you…do you understand that? You took away my reason to live.
They fall into an awkward silence, neither knowing how exactly to move on from the embarrassing moment. He knows she’s wishing they’ll move on but he doesn't want to end on this note, he can't seem to push it aside again with another diplomatic platitude. John thinks about what it must have been like for her, to have believed in them so hard, to want to emulate what she probably thought was the perfect relationship, only to have the rug pulled out from underneath her. How awful it must be for her to have the added strain of an awkward family situation weighing on her hopes as well. At least he hadn't had that to contend with. John glances at Sherlock and hopes the man isn't reading the situation as it is, though he knows it's a futile wish.
, apparently. But would it be worth it? John had come back once before, and he was perfect in all ways that Sherlock could see, but that didn’t mean he’d agree to stay once they got off.
“Sherlock…” He set his phone down on the coffee table and walked forward but Sherlock mirrored the steps backward. John stopped, his chest aching like he’d been punched in the sternum. Any enjoyment he’d gotten out of proving Sherlock wrong was wiped clean, in its place a shaking terror.
They laughed together at the absurd moment. John couldn’t help but flush at the way Sherlock’s curls rolled away from his face, showing the usually hidden plane of his forehead, and the way he looked as he tried to sit up, nose all scrunched up in annoyance. He filed the knowledge away and got an arm under Sherlock’s to help him stand.
