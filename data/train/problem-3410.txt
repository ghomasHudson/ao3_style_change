Oh. That voice.
He kisses Dean then. It’s a long, slow, passionate. Dean doesn’t usually kiss like this. Kissing for reassurance, to express caring, followed by gentle touches and lights the fire in Dean’s belly. Cas takes a step back.
Ramzey starts a poll: “What Cas should wear on his date”. The options are nothing and nothing. It’s a tie, Balt adds the “a smile” option.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean.” Cas shoving Dean out of the way and snapping the laptop shut.  “Are you implying that I’m not hot enough to fuck someone like Ramzey? You know Dean, just because you don’t want me like that, or whatever the fuck you feel for me. Doesn’t mean no one else does.”
“What do you want in a mate?” Deans says mustering far more confidence that he feels. Please say a pretty omega with green eyes.
“Hmmmm… might have to make an exception.”
“What’s his story?”
Bobby appareared and didn’t say anything. He just sat at Dean’s beside. Once it was clear that physically Dean would be ok, he finally said: “You were fucking lucky, boy. The bottle killed your dad, god help me if I let it kill you too. Once you get out of here, we’ll find you a place to dry out.” Bobby touched his arm and left the room. It’s only then that Dean allowed himself to cry.
“I am going to kill Charlie,” Dean says.
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Dean’s not in the mood. He’s jonesing for drink, watching Cas leave is making him restless. Normally, he loves having Charlie around, but right now, she’s saying all the things he’s been trying to avoid.
It’s been such a long long time since Dean has heard anyone say that, and with Cas, he feels that maybe he can let his guard down enough to allow it. “Please,” he hears himself say in a voice barely above a moan.
“Yeah for sure we can come and help.” He sticks his tongue out at Cas. “Bobby’s chainsaw is around here somewhere.”There is a dramatic pause.
But neither Cas nor Dean seem ready to go yet. They end up kissing lazily, indulging in finally being able to do this. Eventually they slowly find their way to shower and eventually get dressed.
“Oh it’s a mixtape of favourite tracks. Cassettes don’t sound nearly as good as vinyl and Baby’s not build for satellite radio, so I have to make do. But cassettes are getting harder and harder to find, I may have to consider retrofitting an MP3 player jack.”
“Yeah Sam. Lisa and I broke up.”
“I told you, they’re hideous.”
Castiel gives the question some consideration, putting his arms through the sleeves his shirt. Dean misses the skin-on-skin contact immediately and pulls him closer once again before Cas does up the buttons.
“Dean! Cas! Stop! Midnight.” They forgot about Charlie. Oops. “The countdown is about to start…”
“Dean, can you see my wings?”
“Cas look at me,” Dean says. “This is not your fault. You deserve someone loyal, who loves you and who goes weak in the knees when you say hello. Come on, let’s get you dried off. It’s late, we should get you back to bed. It'll do you some good.”
“Hi, we have a reservation under Solo,” Dean says with almost a straight face.
“Off,” Dean growled as he removed his hands and got to work on the top buttons of Cas’s shirt. Cas got impatient and pulled the offending shirt off over his head.
Whatever Dean expects to find when he opens the door, it’s definitely not this. In the middle of the stage stands a man with his back to him. He stretches, working his way through a series of standing yoga poses. Dean watches quietly, amused that he’s dressed in what appears to be dress pants, a shirt, and something that might be a tie. The dancer’s movements are graceful, smooth and sure -- beautiful in their apparent simplicity. Dean can’t bring himself to interrupt and so he stands there silently, watching the sequence of poses. He tracks the the strong shoulders and back muscles flexing under the shirt, the strong curve of his ass that gives way to strong powerful thighs as the man reaches his hand to the floor. Dean idly wonders if yoga might be something Zar would consider adding to their line-up. When the time he’s spent watching borders on creepy,Dean finally clears his throat to signal his arrival.
“Cas, you can’t stack the logs like that.” Dean is standing over the pile Cas just placed beside the house.
“Progressive of her. Did she mean me?”
“Did you want to reconsider?” Cas says with more levity that his scent would suggest. Dean snuggles closed to Castiel.
Cas looks up to lock eyes with Dean before they both quickly look away. Dean is still flirting with the blonde, Cas is sure they were just talking about something in his section.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dean?” He must be hallucinating. Dean is half-way across the country with Sam. Said he was leaving Lawrence for good and in so doing also leaving Cas behind. Not that Cas ever worked up the nerve to give Dean a reason to stay.
“Mmmmm…. not yet.”
Before eating pie the way it was meant to be eaten — directly off Dean’s chest.
Yet, two minutes later Missouri returns with two IPAs and basket of garlic bread.  “Your order will be up shortly.”
“I probably also have a safe word.”
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Cas moves his legs behind him in a move that seem anatomically impossible. Fucker is bendy. Before Dean realises it, lost in Jimmy Page’s screaming guitar solo, Cas is standing before Dean, as he languidly unzips his pants.
“You know what? 't figures,” Cas laughs to no one in particular. “I dump my cheatin’ boyfriend and my dumb brain dream up my gorgeous straight best friend taking care of me while I barf... “
“I’d normally get flowers or something, but we’re still a bit trapped,” Dean says a shyly.
With that dick and those lips, I’m unlikely to ever forget. Made it ok?
Cas is moving in closer, shivering a bit, the room is a bit cold. Dean picks up Cas’s shirt off the floor and wraps him in it, Cas smiles. Dean kisses his way up Cas’s neck.
With that Cas grabs the laptop and puts it in his room. He grabs his phone and his keys, and one of the raincoats by the door, then slams the door determined to find a way back to civilization.
Which is not to say it had been easy news to receive. Balt insisted on finding Lisa on social media, said he absolutely wanted to see what she looked like. Cas told him he didn’t want to know. But Balt couldn’t resist, then Cas couldn’t help but look himself. It somehow made it real. There was Dean down on one knee, with a ring in his hand in front of this beautiful, dark-haired, perfect woman. They looked like the epitome of the American dream, like the quarterback marrying the cheerleader. Everything Cas could never be, Dean’s spouse, mother to his children, confidant and friend. On some level he felt he should have been glad that Dean had someone to share his life with, but honestly, most of the time he just hoped lightning would take them both out.
“I don’t mind the smaller room. I’m the one intruding.”
“Hello, Dean.”  A very smiley totally fine Cas looks up. It’s only then Dean notices the kittens clambering to get onto Cas and the two adults tabbies wrapping themselves around his ankles.  “This is Mika and Bob. And this is their brood. I found this little family behind the dumpster.” Cas reaches out and  coaxes the shy little kitten hiding behind Bob. He brings it close to his bare chest. “Look at this little one, the way her paws are white. She’s the tiniest.”
“This is low, Winchester. Even for you. He’s not some chick you picked up in a bar.” For a moment, he’s afraid she might hit him. “You stupid, stubborn asshole.”
“But, you… “
Dean is saved by Ash. Apparently Kevin has lost yet another round of a very complicated drinking game. Experience has taught most of the gang to avoid Ash’s contests at any cost. Kevin, one of Sam’s new friends, has clearly not been warned.
“I would like to apologize for my brother. He is mostly harmless but often misguided.”
“To explain. No. You know what, Dean. Save it. I’m sorry you saw that. Just forget it, and forget me. I’m going to email UCLA and move there instead.”
“What’s going on in that head of yours? Come back to me.“
“I’m sorry, Cas. I’m sorry I wasn’t enough.”
The rhythm of the wipers is a weird counterpoint to the end of the NPR Tiny Desk Concert podcast playing in Cas’s car. He’s not sure who the singer is, but his voice is grating, and it’s making him anxious. He blames the music, but it could be the rain that hasn’t stopped since he left three days ago, or this unending journey back to Kansas, or the fact that every song from Ottawa, Ontario to Ottawa, Kansas reminds him of how he left things with Dean.
Cas,the fucker, chooses that moment to grind into him. God, he’d forgotten how much loves the feeling of a hard dick against his own. Cas in control is all kinds of sexy.
He turns on the radio. “Carry On…”  He loves this song. It’s a lie though, there is no peace. Still he wonders about the mechanics of this place. How does it work?  Could he drive to Hawaii? Are there walls he’ll suddenly find himself bumping up against? Can he just create things as he wants them? What about the souls, can he just call anyone up?
Cas turns back to Dean. “Muriel is fine, she’s still young and prefers screaming to meowing.” Dean shakes his head apparently Cas is the angel of screaming cats now too. “Muriel, come sit here. Dean needs a bit of comfort,” he taps Dean’s lap and Muriel snuggles right in. Dean finds himself petting her.
“Free Cocky Boys subscription.”
“I missed a lot of things about us, Cas. You making me try new things was one of them.”
“Just one moment, dear,” Zar says as he gestures to the bartender. “We need vodka, bring the bottle.”
“Here, let’s switch,” Dean says pulling off Cas as they switch positions so that Cas is now leaning against the counter and Dean is kneeling in front of him. “You’re going to want to watch this.” Dean gives a suggestive wink and swallows Cas nearly all the way down.
“You had better ways to spend your time than to pick up my pieces.”
“Say please.”
“You didn’t have to do that.” Cas says. Dean shrugs and puts the last of his food away.
“Hi, my name is Dean. And I’m an alcoholic.”
And the conversation goes on easily like that as they make up for lost time. They fall back into their old patterns. Cas is reminded again how much he likes Dean. It’s like old times,except for Cas’s foot resting against Dean’s calf. Cas knows it won’t always be this easy. It’s new they’re both still healing from the past two years.  But for now, it feels so good and so right.
Castiel laughs and it’s the most amazing thing Dean has ever heard. Their eyes lock once more, Dean bites his lower lip, wondering if perhaps he’s said too much.
“Dean, for god’s sake just grab it from her…” And Cas reaches down, plucks the rocket from Lyra, who, predictably, bursts into tears.
“Fuck… Dean…”
His mom hated Dean the moment she laid eyes on him. Dean was “from the wrong side of the tracks and nothing but trouble”, not good enough for her baby boy. Yeah, gorgeous, green-eyed, fucking beautiful trouble if the latest photos from Sam’s Facebook page are any indication. Cas really hates that his mean conservative witch of a mother was right.
“Oh sweetie, you ain’t seen nothing yet,” Dean winks. “There is a whole lot this fine piece of ass can do.”
“That’s good, Cas. Thanks. Do you need help?”
Charlie laughs. “Number One, I can tell you a lot of things about our fair handmaiden over there. For one, he’s most definitely bi. For two, he spends a lot of his time here looking at you like you’re the best thing since apple pie. And in Dean’s world, not much is better than pie. Check it out, he’s doing it now.”
Zar pours another round.
As he makes his way into her house, takes off his wet jackets and shoes. She may be a bit greyer in the temples, she has the same twinkle in her eye. She pulls him into one of her impossibly good hugs.
“Dude, do not get into Star Wars vs Star Trek with me.”
Dean’s almost disappointed to hear that but Cas rubbing him down through the towel feels so good.
“Wasn’t sure if you two were going to punch each other or rip each other’s clothes off,” Charlie says handing him a few more records to look over.
“Sure.” The lights are turned off, the bathroom lit only by the light of the hallway. “You ok here for a second? Your room stinks, you don’t smell so good yourself. I’m going to change your sheets. There’s water beside you here and another facecloth if you need it.” Cas nods. He instantly misses Dean’s warmth. If he’s honest, he’s missed Dean every day since he last saw him a year ago at Sam’s wedding, the texts and phone calls just aren’t enough.
Dean was pretty sure that when he finally saw Cas again, Cas was going to beat the living shit out of him, and Dean was fully prepared to let him. But now that Cas is here and seems to be giving him a second chance, and the one thing Cas wants to know about, is the one thing that will scare him away for good. But there isn’t much Dean wouldn’t do for Cas.
“Thank you, Dean. I may yet take you up on the offer of a kiss at midnight.”
“I met him once or twice. He was a good man.”
“Cas, I’d like you to meet Lyra’s mom, Chelsea.”
“This whole mating thing is antiquated and we can do better both as a society and as people. Gabriel, I know deep down you are a better man.”
Cas nods, another fantasy blown to shreds. A moment later, Dean joins him and helps Cas up. “Let’s do this,” Dean grabs the soap. “Ok?” Cas nods. “You aren’t really stable so you might want to hang on to me."
Glad you made it in one piece. I wonder if they have wifi in Oz.
While some things at the cabin have changed, the speed of the wifi isn’t one of them. The file is taking a long time to download. He walks to the kitchen and fills the kettle and sets it on the stove.
“Ah, sounds like the snarky bastard I know and love is still in there.”
Shit. What has he done.
Dean wonders if he’d have been one of those people. He tries to be happy with what he’s got.
“Probably third,” Dean says without skipping a beat. “We could go a bit more traditional.” Dean stops, makes as if he’s singing into a mic and croons:
“Good night, Dean.”
“But …”
“I said I don’t want to talk about it.” He raises his voice though he knows it’s not going to stop Charlie.
The answer comes in the form of a text -- praying is a one way communications system.
“I apologize if this mix-up has forced you to cut your vacation short.”
Cas nods. Dean slides the condom onto Cas’s dick, covers it with lube.  Dean lines himself up and starts to lower himself onto Cas.
“I don’t think that’s likely to happen. Maybe he is bi, but he’s just not into me. I just wish I’d been more prepared. I was hoping for more of a fuck-you moment. Liked dressed to kill with some hot guy on my arm. I mean I was in a soaking wet t-shirt with a mustard stain on it. And he just couldn’t stop staring at me in disgust.”
“I don’t want pretty, I want to understand. A lot has changed since I left. Please.”
He looks around the room. He’s surprised to see his old yoga mat is still there, until he remembers that Sam mentioned getting into it as well. It takes a moment but he moves the furniture around enough to lay it out. There isn’t a lot of room on the porch, but it’ll do for simple poses to ground him. He starts with a few sun salutations, taking extra time in downward dog enjoying the stretch in his hamstrings, followed by a few flow routines, all the warriors, tree, to end in Savasana, corpse pose. But the floor is damp and uncomfortable, so he grabs a pillow from one of the chairs, gently moves into half lotus and tries to still his mind.
“Cas? That really you?”
In the eye of Hurricane Charlie, neither Dean nor Cas know what to say. She hands Cas the tickets and Dean two condoms and a few packets of lube. Stunned into silence, they just keeping looking at each other, at Charlie, then the tickets, then the condoms, then back again.
“Some people use AA to prey on the new people in the group. They call it the 13th step. Looking back now, he may have been right.”
Memories flood in. Like the beating Cas gave him when he wanted to give himself over to Zachariah. He begged Cas to end it then and there. But Cas showed him mercy. At some point between being dragged into the alley and finding himself at Bobby’s, Cas--obviously still angry--pinned him one last time, Dean wasn’t sure if it was to kill or kiss. Dean went right to kill. Because no one falls in love with Dean Winchester. He’s too flawed, and filled with hate and anger.  Still. Now. Even in heaven.
Dean kisses him. “Yes. So much yes, but I want to be your only boyfriend.”
Cas and Lyra make their way to the couch. He plunks her down on the couch, cleans up the cushions. He picks up the remote and fixes it. Some jobs require mojo, some jobs require jiggling the batteries until they connect. With his grace, he manages to swipe the film.
“Then give him a reason to stay, Dean. But you have to stop assuming what he wants. Only he gets to decide what he wants, ask him. You deserve good things. And you two both deserve to be happy.”
“We’ll get you through this, Cas. I promise,” Dean whispers. Cas looks down. Dean is playing it cool but if the towel wrapped around his waist is any indication he’s not unaffected. “I hope you remember some of this in the morning.”
“Dunno, grace and celestial light?”
“How do we make sure, they don’t try something stupid.”
“Find something you like? ” Cas rolls up into Dean. “My place. I’ll put on Lady Gaga.”
“No clue what addiction has to do with cutting down trees. But making a cut here will make your life easier.”
“Well, your friends were worried. We called, texted. Nothing. I hadn’t heard from you in weeks so I called Gabe for an update. He told me about Michael. But when he couldn’t get through to you, I got on a plane.” Dean passes Cas a glass of water and some ibuprofen. “Why didn’t you tell me about Michael?”
Dean takes Cas’s hand in his, and guides the fork to his mouth. Cas swallows hard. Then Dean’s eyes roll back in his head, and he moans loudly again. Cas has a list of new life goals, one of them is to make Dean moan like that for him.
“I thought…” Cas vaguely recalls Dean’s earlier confession. “I can take care of that if you like,” Cas offers.
Cas is caught off guard, it’s not a question he expected. What is it to Dean if he’s got a man waiting for him?
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice, he climbs into bed and kisses Cas once again. There is so much skin to touch and Dean takes his time.
But Sam doesn’t hear, he doesn’t look too hard for Dean either. This is a good sign. Dean is ready for his next act. Part of him had hoped to see Cas when he died. Hoped he’d stand there in that stupid trenchcoat. “Hello, Dean. I’ve been waiting for you.” But no dice. Even death is disappointing.
Zar tops up everyone’s vodka as a stagehand sweeps the stray feathers off the floor. Dean wonders if somehow he’s gone from the lead dancer in a strip club to the punch line in some sort of third-rate sitcom.
“But I am not really one for small talk,” Castiel continues. “I find it difficult. My family say I’m strange.”
“Dean moved on. He was engaged.”
Dessert turns out to be a rather large piece of tiramisu with one fork.
“And too much Nickelback makes Dean’s knuckles drag,” Cas retorts.
“Thanks,” Dean croaks out, reaching out for the towel.
Seriously though, putting my counsellor hat on for a sec. Lawrence isn’t a big town and you guys know a lot of the same people, might be good to get some closure. Maybe have a conversation.
Dean rises, running his hand along Cas’s chest, to stand once more. He looks down to Cas’s lap then looks up and winks.
“Surprised you remembered.” Cas grabs the cup and smiles. “Thank you.”
If they wanted to send him to jail for a long, long time, this was what he deserved. He wouldn’t let the hospital call anyone, but Jody knew Bobby and did anyway.
Cas opens his wings a bit more but doesn’t say anything. Dean continues. “Please, let me do this for you. You know, Sam and me, we love you, right? You know, I love you.” Cas doesn’t say anything but allows Dean to start preening his wings.
****’
Dean just keeps staring out the window. Cas and Sam are placing the last of the boxes into the trunk. Charlie sends a text, probably to Sam because he’s looking at his phone, then Charlie’s phone buzzes.
“Hey little one, you know I won’t hurt you,” Cas says to the furball in his hand.
“God Dean, I thought we’d have more time. I hoped we could find a spot, you know. Get normal.”
--------
I have news. Dean and I talked. We are giving it a go. It’s been like 10 hours. But so far so good.
“Did you know him?”
She nods leaves the door open as she steps into the waiting area. “Gabriel Milton!”
Dean’s not sure what just happened. But Lisa can’t seem to get away fast enough. Whatever it is, it worked. Oh, and it sounds like Cas may not be opposed to kissing. Huh.
“Cas, it’s not brain surgery. She wants you to pick her up. She won’t bite.”
“What do you know, he does know his Zeppelin,” Dean seems impressed.  “When we were kids my brother Sammy stuck a toy soldier in one of the vents. My dad never bothered to get it out. I’ve rebuilt her nearly from scratch and well, I never bothered to take it out either. I figure a car like this should have a few stories like that.”
Dean is crushed. Yeah, this has got to be  hell.
“Cas, come here,” as she welcome him in for their usual hug.
“Tell you what Cas. You’re whole love ‘em and leave ‘em performance sucks ass. I need you. And you’re not here. Turns out, I was right the first time, all angels are dicks.”
“Cassie, baby! Come out, come out wherever you are!” Gabe’s shouts echo through Castiel’s house. It’s grating and making everything worse. Cas takes a chug from the bottle of Wild Turkey that’s become his best friend.
“Dean,” is all Cas could pant out as Cas reached down and peeled Dean out of his henley. They stared at each other for a moment, before Cas grabbed Dean by the belt and pulled him into another searing kiss. Dean moaned and pressed his leg between Cas’s thighs. His knees got a bit weak when he realized he could feel Dean’s erection pressing up against his own
There it is in a nutshell, Dean thinks.
For one his father is here. He’d hoped to be free from his father’s clutches for good. He might go see his mom, but his dad, well, there are issues and he needs to unpack first. He’ll avoid his dad for the next little while, until he can forgive. He hoped death would wipe the slate clean but it hasn’t. Guess, even in death nothing is tidy, nothing is resolved.
“You want to pretend the last two years didn’t happen.”
Settling onto the bed overlooking the lake, Cas fires up his computer and logs into the group chat. The guys have changed the chat name to
“I was really hoping for pie,” Dean says.
“I’ll call Dean but you’ll need to come along, it’ll be a two-person job.”
Dean didn’t really know leaving was still an option. Sure he’d heard Cas mention LA, but he couldn’t be serious. He just came back.“Don’t go,” is all Dean says. Cas looks over in surprise, but doesn’t say anything.
“Sit,” she says as if they are misbehaving puppies. And they do, stealing a glance at each other. This reminds Dean of the many times he ended up sitting outside the principal’s office. Cas usually with him to play the role of his defense attorney.
“Don’t you fucking dare. Cas, these are the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. Can I touch them?”
“Yes, but you’re still in love with Dean, that’s the problem.”
He pulls a blanket out of the trunk, lays it over Baby’s hood. It’s quite the light show tonight -- a meteor shower. Like the night the angels fell. He hopes it’s innocuous, and just a light show for his benefit. Cas said that good things do happen. Dean’s never really been on the receiving end of that.
This time, though Cas’s eyes are locked on Dean as he does. Sam calls this thing they do eye-fucking. Dean thinks Cas is just awkward and Dean likes to look into Cas’s baby blues. He also knows that if they hold it too long his stomach does a happy little flip flop. It is possible that Sam might be onto something.
“No more worrying about small things, Dean. Time for bigger things.”
“No… I …”
“If I ever gave you the impression, Dean, that what you do for a living matters to me or means that you are somehow lesser than me, then I owe you an apology. Benny is right. I get to decide what I want, and what I deserve. I think a date sounds like a good place to start. And for all this self-sacrificing you do Dean, I hope you know you deserve to be happy too.”
Indeed.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dean, do we have to listen to this again?”
Dean’s not sure what he expects but a gentle touch of lips is not it. It’s tender, and he feels the warm charge of healing energy coursing through him. He sighs happily, letting Cas taste him. The kiss is tender, gentle and kind. Dean is feeling things, emotional things,  and he’s not sure what to do about it. His relationship with Cas was always been tense, hard, and, passionate, all muscles and hard lines, it’s fucking to stave off the end of the world. Dean has tried to keep his heart out of it, but it’s always been more than a quick fuck or a one night stand. Obviously it is, Cas is his best friend. But this kiss, it’s healing but it’s saying so much more. It’s loving. If he’s honest, Dean would tell you that it’s the best kiss he’s ever had. But Dean is rarely honest about these things, especially not to himself.
The memories rush in. “Oh shit, I kind of threw myself at you.” Cas can’t help it, he blushes.
She stands in the open doorway. Looking exactly like her remembered her, she’s wiping her hands on a dishcloth, a warm smile on her face.
“Dean? She seems very quiet right now.”
Cas laughs. “I take it that’s a yes. We really need to clean up.” Cas says, rolling off Dean. “Stay.”
Castiel shakes his head. “No. I’ve never been to a club…like this. This is my first time here.”
Cas doesn’t like the label but it doesn’t matter what you call it. It is over now. As planned. over the last week, the group went their separate ways. First Carter and Ram found a place in LA, then a few days ago, Balt and Cas closed the house and returned the keys. Cas drove Balt to the airport, he was heading to Stanford. There were no tears, just a long hug and a promise to visit soon.
“Yeah, been a bit more than a year. I’ll have to keep at it forever. I usually go to AA meetings a few times a week. Helps keeps things in check. But we’re kind of stuck here right now. I tried online but it’s not quite the same. Ended up calling my sponsor, Benny, last night. Hot guy from Louisiana, straight as a rod sadly. But he’s there when I need him. We’ve spoken a lot the last few days.”
Cas has nothing to apologize for, but Dean doesn’t reply to that text either. A few drops of rain fall on his windshield as he starts his car, the only thing he has left, and drives himself to the nearest liquor store.
His phone pings.
“Castiel, seems you left civilization and are the wilderness. Are you ok? You have to give me all the juicy details. Why is Dean there?”
: Not an answer.
They’d taken care of Mildred since they first started coming up here, doing all the household stuff she couldn’t do herself. Bobby wouldn’t let them take money for it, so she started sending them home with pie, and various baked goods. She is in her late 70s now and apparently still has a soft spot for Cas and Dean.
“What? Why… I don’t need.”
He decided he would just not fight, and let the dice fall where they may.
He texts Sam.
In looking it over, Cas realizes that, after two years of communal living he has, in fact, purchased too much food.
“Not forever, Dean. Just for a little bit. The parents need a rest.” Cas hands Dean a kitten and kisses him gently on the forehead. “It’s going to be fine. Trust me. We have faced much greater enemies.”
“Daddy birb”  she reaches out and runs her hand around the edge of Cas’s wing. It runs a chill down Cas’s spine.
“He’s not wrong, Zar.” Gabe opines. “You best fill him in on the family situation.”
“I do believe you mentioned something about wanting to see me on my knees,” as he slips a teasing finger under the waist band of Cas's pants. "If you're up to the task." Cas gasps.
“Cas, I’m fine. I’ve been in much worse shape. It’s just a bit sore, it makes me think of you. It’s fine.”
“Our dear cousin, Castiel is in a bit of a bind. Our aunt caught him on his knees ‘enjoying’ her pool boy.” Zar explains over Gabriel’s eyebrow wiggle. “Apparently not done in polite homophobic society, so she kicked him out. He’s staying with Gabe for now, but he’ll need to pay for school and the like. I said we’d take him as a waiter, Gabe thinks he’d be a great dancer.”
“Charlie,” Dean grabs her into a tight hug. “Merry Christmas and all that.”
“A beautiful rare omega unicorn who is looking for a mate or a hot date.”
Dean picks up one of the bags he’s holding and places it on the island separating the kitchen from the living room.
There is the flutter of wings. Dean bolts up but it’s a blue heron taking off a few feet away from him.
“I love you, you stupid selfless asshole.” Dean pulls away and gently kisses Cas’s lips. “What took you so long?”
He claims his knot could satisfy any omega and that he has immeasurable wealth. Dean would be impressed but they all say that. The alpha lurches forward until he’s leaning on the arms of Dean’s chair.
“Man, I cannot believe they drive to work in that much snow. Ridiculous. Hey, Dean missed you, you know -- and that accident man. Wasn’t sure he’d ever fix that Impala. Heck, didn’t think we’d ever see him up here again. It was so good to see that big black car in the driveway a few days ago. Glad you’re back too, man. Just like old times.”
Cas takes a step forward, getting very close to Dean.
Cas should say something, but he can’t right now. He is too angry. He was supposed to be over Dean. That’s what Balt, Ramzey and Carter were about. But now that Dean is here in front of him, his heart aches every time Dean walks by. And good lord, he wishes it didn’t.
“I’m not sure, it’s something about the wings, they like to touch them.”
“Oh please, that was miles from coming to blows.”
“Yes.” Dean in a voice that certainly doesn't sound like a whimper.
“Dean, I was nice and warm!”
It’s not entirely Cas’s fault, he knows that, Dean’s the one who refused to talk to him. Cas has gone back and forth between righteous fury and heartbreak every day since it happened. He really thought he’d have moved on by now, really hates that he hasn’t.
He starts planning what retirement looks like. Figures out how to get a job, go legit. Find a small town somewhere that needs a gas station and a garage. A place that doesn’t ask too many questions. It keeps his mind busy. In the meantime, he and Sam take on a few inconsequential monsters. Easy ones: salt and burns, a possessed object or two. Nothing with teeth. Mostly.
He gets out of the car and runs back to Baby. More rain. He considers running in the get a jacket. But he’s already soaked, so there really isn’t much point. He opens the car door.
He hears the sounds of dishes from the kitchen. Dean’s still here, fucker said he’d be gone by now. Cas ponders lounging around in his room until Dean leaves. He stretches, still stiff from last night’s drive. Yeah, nature is calling and coffee is going to be a requirement. Mornings aren’t his favourite time of day, this one is looking to be harsher than most. He rips the blankets off himself, and after a bathroom break, pads into the common area.
“Depends, how does it feel?” Dean asks.
“Deal,” Cas says.
“How I spend my time is my decision to make.”
The only thing he knows no matter what the choice tomorrow is, tonight he needs off this road and out of his car.
“Again, he beat you up at the beginning of the year.”
“Oh, I just ran into someone in the hallway,” Sam said, trying for a casual tone.
“Oh,” Castiel said, trying to hide his disappointment. Since he was already here, there was no sense leaving without a drink. But he wasn’t going to linger when Dean was off duty.
“But they are no less desirable qualities,” Castiel hastened to assure him.”You are not just a pretty face, as the saying goes.”
“I would prefer it be mine,” Castiel said with a nod.
God, he was such an idiot. Why had he assumed Jimmy was gay? The impassioned speech he gave about Stonewall in their modern American history class didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe someone Jimmy knew was gay or he just got angry about all the injustice in the world. Hopefully Jimmy was just as nice as he seemed and wouldn’t get offended that Dean insinuate he was anything less than straight, but Dean knew for sure he’d never be able to look Jimmy in the eyes again.
Monday afternoon, Dean was late again. As the minutes ticked by, Sam got more and more nervous. What if Dean had said something really stupid and Castiel had punched him again? What if he was lying unconscious somewhere and bleeding out?
The peace was broken by a loud shriek that seemed to echo through the entire bunker.
“In his defense, I would have figured it out eventually,” Dean said. “After all, we’ve supposedly never had a class before and yet you walked right up to me.”
Sam leveled him with a look.
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Holy shit!” His eyes darted between the two of them. “Dude, this is wild.”
“Wait, really?”
Sam began to open the paper bag and stopped when he saw the envelope bearing Dean’s name stapled to the side.
“And who’s Lucifer? Don’t tell me Charlie picked up a wild bat, too.”
“I didn’t do a damn thing, Sam. I even stopped flirting with him.” Dean winced. “I mean…”
Huh. That was weird.
“Good.” Castiel thrust a small brown bag into Sam’s hands. “Give this to your brother,” he growled.
“Jesus, you’re paranoid. Here, I’ll prove it to you.” Jimmy tore a piece of paper out of his notebook scribbled something on it and passed it across the table. “This is Castiel’s number. Give him a call. Ask him something about one of the classes you think you’re taking with me.”
“You can go over and say hi if you want.”
“That sounds like an excellent idea,” Castiel said. “But I don’t think you need my help.”
Meg poked her head into the lobby. “Dean Winchester and Lucifer?”
“It’s an actual raccoon. Charlie hasn’t named it yet.”
Cas stared at the image intently. “I find your nipples to be a very aesthetically pleasing shade of pink.”
“I’m afraid so. But if he does have rabies, he’s suffering and all we can do is put him out of his misery.”
“I do not know,” Castiel said. “This photo was given to me by one of your friends. They said it would be effective blackmail material.”
And of course, Dean didn’t want to talk about it and he didn’t want Sam speaking up on his behalf. The last time Sam had pointed out John’s obvious favoritism, John had just laughed and mocked Dean the rest of the day for needing his little brother to fight his battles. And Dean had gotten mad at Sam, not John. It was a little sad. Even after all the shit John put him through, Dean still cared about his opinion.
Castiel grumbled and glanced at his watch. “I sure hope so.”
Sam gagged. Maybe he’d walk the rest of the way home.
Castiel frowned. “Why would you do something like that? We agreed not to tell too many people.”
Dean huffed and stalked off towards the parking lot.
Sam pulled the card out of the envelope.
Castiel sighed and poked a few keys on the computer.
“That’s a shame. It looks like he missed you.” Sam held up the paper bag in Dean’s line of vision.
Castiel sighed. “What is it this time?”
“It’s Cas,” Sam said, his eyes wide and wild. “He’s gone crazy.”
“You don’t know what it is yet. He could have given you a bag of dog shit.”
“Oh, Charlie’s bringing that one in,” Meg said around a mouthful of bagel.
Cas nodded. “I admire the play of your muscles as you work. And I can’t help but notice that the jeans you wore were slightly tighter than usual.”
Dean grabbed his arm. “Dude. Where’s the fire?”
He waited until Dean was enjoying his after dinner pie so Dean would have comfort food to cushion the blow. “I still don’t think Castiel meant you to take the whole thing this well. I’ve never heard anyone say ‘eat a bag of dicks’ and mean it as a compliment.”
“Holy hell,” Dean said. “I’m usually all for traumatizing Sam, but frankly this is a little weird for me too. What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”
“It’s alright, Mr. Winchester. Most animals are frightened in new situations. Especially if they’ve had prior traumatic experiences. You say you’ve recently acquired Lucifer? Do you know his history.”
It was just what Sam had been afraid of. Dean was punishing himself by giving up his favorite eye candy.
Call Sam crazy, but he didn’t consider getting his ass kicked foreplay.
Sam plopped down into the passenger’s seat. “So, run into Castiel at all today?”
Dean dropped heavily onto the chair.
Castiel flushed. “Can I buy him a drink?”
Dean’s brow furrowed. “And how come I’ve never had a class with Castiel on the roster as himself?”
Ah, so this was Castiel. The tall, dark and handsome Dean was always going on about. His eyes were definitely his most striking feature. He would give Dean that much.
Meg waved a hand dismissively. “Those pants had to have been poured on him, they’re so tight. It’s so disappointing they didn’t rip right down the crotch the second he sat down. But there’s holes in his knees so there’s still hope for you yet.”
“On your dick?” Dean asked hopefully.
“I’m just flirting with him.”
“That’s uh….very nice,” Dean said, shifting uncomfortably. This was getting a little too close to feelings territory. He had hoped the whole slideshow was compliments about his hunting skills and maybe a bit about his damn good burgers. He knew Cas cared about him, but he didn’t want to look too closely at that. And he especially didn’t want Sam to look too closely at that.
“Shut up.” He slammed Dean against the wall with an audible thud.
“Don’t worry. Your secret’s safe with me,” Dean said with a wink. “I’m sure if Sammy was actually my twin, I’d be making him take all the classes I hate too. Kid’s a freaking genius.”
“Oh no, there’s nothing wrong with him. As far as I can tell anyway. My brother said you do a new pet exam.” He frowned. “You do still have that, right?”
The woman in the seat next to him shot him a disapproving look and moved over another seat, tightening her grip on her purse. He didn’t seem to notice. He just leaned back in his chair and mouthed something to himself while rapidly drumming his fingers against his thighs. Probably one of the band’s songs.
“Yup. Sam Winchester.” He looked at Castiel expectantly, like that was supposed to mean something.
“And what is this?” he asked. On the top level was a tiny round disk that looked like it was attached to the floor of the cage.
“Don’t worry so much, Sammy. I’ll tell him how much I enjoyed the dicks when I see him Monday and clear things up. Now are you going to quit motherhenning me or are you actually going to finish your pie?”
Dean turned around slowly.
“I didn’t do anything,” Jimmy said with a lazy smile.
From the mischievous look on Dean’s face, Sam was sure Dean was going to disgust him with a very explicitly detailed play by play in the morning.
Sam blinked. “I stand corrected.”
“I don’t want to hear anything about you slacking off. If your grades start slipping, you won’t get to graduate. And high school dropouts have no future. Don’t plan on living here the rest of your life if you don’t get your diploma.”
“Fine. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Sam tugged his arm out of Dean’s grasp and headed in the direction of his bedroom.
“The shift will go much easer if all the opening preparations are done beforehand,” Castiel reminded her.
“Wait,” Castiel said. “You’re right. You do deserve to hear positive things about yourself. Quite often you sell yourself short and make disparaging comments. It will do you some good to hear how your honesty, kindness, loyalty, and steadfast perseverance have inspired me over the years.”
“Winchester, hey,” Jimmy said with a warm smile. “Need more physics help?”
Dean kept the volume on the radio turned up the entire drive home, as if he was afraid Sam would continue teasing him. Sam was definitely planning on it, but he was going to wait until Dean let his guard down.
Dean was very good at his job. He knew when Castiel needed a friendly smile and some teasing words, when he needed a sympathetic ear to listen to his woes, and when to simply set a glass of beer in front of him and make himself scarce.
“Very.” Sam took a moment to look at them, with their flushed cheeks and stupid grins. He was happy to see them happy. “Okay, you two have fun and be safe. I don’t want to hear any details tomorrow.”
“Damn,” Jimmy said with an appreciative whistle. “You didn’t tell me that. You’ve been holding out on me, Winchester.”
Charlie had to have had a menagerie by now. She was always finding and adopting stray animals. Castiel himself had treated two dogs, a cat, a guinea pig, and a chinchilla but he faintly remembered seeing her with a pair of cockatoos at some point.
“Of course Dean.” Cas says as he rubs his nose between the kitten’s ears. “Sit down, Dean. Get to know them.” Dean is not entirely sure how he feels about this turn of events. It’s not that he doesn’t like cats, it’s just that, well, he’s just never been given much of an opportunity. And on the whole, all of God’s creatures great and small includes a bunch of things he’d rather not come across in a dark alley -- like Leviathan.
“They do that, I’m due to molt soon. But it feels really good, please continue.”
“I should be heading home,” he says. “Whatever you’re looking for, I hope you found it here.”
Jody cleared her throat, giving Dean a stern look. “I can’t allow you to come with us, Dean. You’re not trained, or properly armed, or qualified in any way.”
Castiel swallows back his protests and looks up to meet Rufus’ eyes, giving him a small nod. “Thank you for your assistance,” he says, proud of the way he keeps his voice steady. “It means a great deal to the both of us.”
“Emmanuel.” It is the wrong name, but it still washes over Castiel like a caress. All he would need to do is lean forward, just a fraction of an inch, and Dean would meet him halfway.
One corner of Dean’s mouth curls up. “Can’t wait.”
The whisper of metal against itself was the only warning he had as an enemy soldier approached from his unguarded side. Swinging wildly with his blade, Castiel caught the Calornan against the side of their helmless head, dropping them immediately. He knew the rules of engagement, the ones Michael spoke before every battle: leave none alive. But he had never been very good at listening to his brother’s commands.
“How?”
“Right.” Dean lets out a deep breath and roots in his bag for the last of their flatbreads, breaking it in half and passing a piece to Castiel. “Can we keep the fire going just a little longer? It’ll help us dry off.”
“You really are persistent,” Castiel said again. “I suppose we both went into our date the other night with preconceived notions of how it would end.” He paused, a smile curling up one side of his mouth and giving Dean a glimpse of the seductive charm he’d been dripping with before. “And since we were robbed of that surely spectacular ending--”
“You’re a monster.”
“Is that like, a thing for you?”
He could resist it no longer. He wrapped one hand around his aching cock, head falling against the back of the chair in relief. Dean let out a shaky moan and did the same, both of them keeping their pace slow, watching each other. Castiel noted the way Dean twisted his wrist, the way he added an occasional faster stroke to jolt himself out of his rhythm. He could hear the slick slide of skin against skin and the increasing harshness of their breath.
From anyone else, that might not be the most confidence-inspiring statement. But from Castiel-- Dean thinks he might be getting a proper bath tonight after all.
“I will endeavour to cure you of it, then.” Castiel slides his hand up to rest it at the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder, fingers stroking gently over the short hairs at the nape of his neck. Dean shivers slightly, eyes wide as he looks at Castiel. “We have all made mistakes,” Castiel tells him. “Myself included. When I saw you fall from that tower--”
But he cannot abandon his mission so easily. Castiel takes a deep breath, feeling the air travel through the unfamiliar channels of his body, and raises his head as he enters the room.
It made a certain, terrible sense. Already, Castiel could feel the heat building in his body again, despite the thinness of the linen over him and--
“It has,” Balthazar agreed. “I look forward to many such conversations once we’re all together at Rexford. You’ll be going up early, I assume, to get the house ready?”
They rode out the next morning, after an endless series of council meetings and strategy sessions. Many of the courtiers and advisors had been in favour of re-forming the army and riding out in force, but Castiel had refused that suggestion. The castle needed to be protected against other potential threats, and Dean had sent to Calorna asking for a force to meet them at the foot of the mountains. Together, they would be enough.
It’s been almost two weeks, and he hasn’t heard from Cas at all. Dean figures that’s all the answer he’s going to get, and so he’s here, with Lisa, throwing himself back into one-time-only dates to remind himself what he’s good at. What he’s good for.
“Thank you.” He hesitates only a moment, then says, “And it’s Cas.”
Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes. As far as he knows, Kaia has never called herself anything like that, but the court loves a dramatic entrance, and he can admit it does sound quite impressive.
“Thank you for letting us know. I’ll pass the message along.” Other than Amelia’s funeral, Cas hasn’t set foot in a church in years. But if Jimmy wants to go, he’ll be right there beside him. “Goodbye, Hannah.”
“No.” Castiel shakes his head. “It is to your father’s castle that we must go. I cannot explain it, Sam, but my instincts have been guiding me south since the moment I left my forest behind. And now you tell me he hates angels with a passion strong enough to make his people afraid to even mention them? If I am to find answers anywhere, it is there.”
“Hello, Dean,” he says softly.
There’s a slight pause, and then Benny sighs. “Look, I’m real sorry. But I don’t think Andrea and I are going to make it over tonight.”
“I’m sorry.” This time, he’s the one to reach out, to brush his fingertips over Dean’s wrist. Dean meets his eyes and shrugs again, but doesn’t pull away from the contact.
“You chose to stay with us here,” Ellen reminds him. “And you’ve kept your walls up, Cas, and we’ve respected that. But you’re a part of this place now, and we look after our own.”
Sam appeared behind him, worry on his face. “Eileen and I were…” He cleared his throat. “We were thinking about getting away for a while.”
They paid for their coffee and picked it up, taking the travel cups across the room and towards Sam and Eileen.
“You should have said I was ‘John Bon Jovi.’” Cas said, smiling.
“They're arguing over coffee again.”
They laid there in silence, breathing in scents of comfort, coffee, and each other, until Cas eventually drifted off to sleep.
They walked into the building, immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of excessive amounts of flavoured syrup indoused coffee. Dean glanced around the well-lit building, taking note of the many different people there.
Part of him was afraid it would never come.
Hope sparked, kindling the flame.
“Sam started it.”
Cas walked in, wielding two mugs of coffee and a proud look shining in his eyes. “I made us coffee.” He said triumphantly, handing one of the mugs to Dean.
He thought he remembered Donna saying she was going to move up there and live with them.
Before either of them could respond, Cas shoved his mug into Dean's face. “You have to try this, Dean. It tastes like pumpkin pie.”
The worst part is, he’s probably right. Cas has accomplished nothing on this trip, except learning that Sam Winchester is fiercely protective of his brother despite the apparent estrangement between them. And becoming more convinced than ever that they’re both hiding something.
Cas raises an expectant eyebrow as Balthazar flips to the next page, where the man’s details are listed. His name is Dean, he’s thirty-one years old, and he lists himself as bisexual.
“So I should probably tell this part,” Claire interrupts. Kaia gives her a soft smile as she crosses the room and offers Dean a steaming mug of something that smells both sweet and sharp. The aroma brings back a flood of memories of standing in his family’s kitchen as his mother gave him something to cure his sniffles, and he accepts it with only a trace of hesitation.
“The king is well.” The messenger, young enough that Dean doesn’t recognize her, holds up her hands in a calming gesture. “As is the queen.” A smile breaks over her face, and she hands him a scroll sealed with the red and gold crest of the royal family of Carlisse.
The Mistress of the Wardrobe was a cheerful woman named Donna, who gave him a broad smile as he entered her suite of rooms, immediately putting him at ease. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Prince Castiel,” she said, dipping an elegant curtsey. “Oh, such wonderful colouring you have! You will be a delight to dress.”
It’s slow going, dragging himself back towards the truck. He’s shivering now, all his careful layers doing little to prevent the chill from seeping into his bones. He’s fairly confident he’s heading in the right direction, but the trees all look the same, and the pain is making him light-headed. Gasping for breath, he rests against a tree trunk and reaches into his pocket with shaking hands.
“Asshole,” Dean mutters, but he softens it by pressing a kiss to Cas’ cheek. “Well. We’d better hit the road.”
In the rearview mirror, Cas sees Claire’s shaky smile. “She has to work tomorrow, so it’s probably best if we drop her off.”
The streetlights were on by the time he pulled to a stop across from the church. Running a hand through his hair, Dean checked his reflection and grinned to himself before sliding out of the car. Knocking sharply on Castiel’s door, he shifted his weight from side to side as he waited for it to open.
Looking back at Castiel, Dean grins. It is an expression of such pure joy that Castiel’s heart gives an answering leap in his chest. “I look forward to it,” Dean says.
With a choked-off sob, Dean does, spilling hot over Cas’ hand. Cas smooths his hair away from his forehead with his clean hand, then presses a kiss there, holding him until his trembling subsides.
A squirrel. The enchanted stone turned him into a squirrel.
It’s a terrible thought. Cas swallows grimly, imagining the look of shock and betrayal on Ryan’s face at being attacked by someone he trusted. It doesn’t require a lot of imagination. He’s seen that look before.
Very neatly done. Tongues would have started wagging immediately, wondering if he had come to make a bid for the throne, and with one brief speech, Castiel silenced them. Competent as ever, Dean thinks fondly.
“Say hello for me,” she instructed with a smile.
Dean snorts with laughter. “Very true.” He starts to add that she might have to get used to it, but stops himself in time. He doesn’t know what plans Claire and Kaia have made, and frankly, it’s none of his business. But he’s come to like Kaia quite a bit, despite the fact that she turned him into a squirrel, and he hopes she and Claire can find some happy medium for their lives.
A deep rumble of laughter rose from Benny’s chest. “And is that why you’re so testy? Pining for your absent love?”
“It doesn’t matter.” Castiel pushes his chair away from the table and rises to his feet, pacing. “Whatever regard he might have for me, whatever I might”-- he breaks off, biting his lip--”feel for him, it doesn’t matter. It is nothing but another cage.”
“No.”
Castiel rises from his seat and crosses to the window. A moment later, he senses Dean’s presence behind him. “When all this is done,” Dean says, “will you tell me why?”
Dean finds him there as the last light of the sun disappears behind the tree tops. “Still at it?” he asks, a slight edge to his voice that pierces through Castiel’s despair. “I had hoped there might be a hot meal waiting for me, after the day I’ve had.”
Sam rolls his eyes again, but the dimples have made a reappearance. It’s clear that this is an old argument between them, if argument is even the right word. Their bickering is comfortable in a way that reminds Cas of his relationship with Balthazar, both of them long-used to each other’s barbs. It’s highly entertaining to observe, and Cas no longer has any regrets about going over to say hello to Dean.
“No, it’s fine.” Dean laughed, but there was still something tense in the set of his shoulders. “Your hands are just cold.”
A commotion in the opposite corner tore Dean’s gaze away. He saw Gadreel first, head and shoulders above most of the crowd. A smaller figure trailed in his wake, and Dean straightened up, taking his first look at Castiel’s opponent.
“A heavy responsibility,” Castiel murmured, though some of the tightness around his eyes began to ease.
She throws a wave over her shoulder before taking Balthazar’s hand and allowing herself to be led upstairs. Dean watches them go, smiling softly, then turns to Castiel with a raised eyebrow. “Well, my lord? We are in Paris, after all.”
“I will,” Dean answered, and was pleased to note his voice was steady despite the nervousness thrumming through his entire body.
“Oh, no,” Crowley cut in, stepping forward with a grin. He offered a smart bow to the woman in black. “Billie, how nice to see you.”
He has a sense of where this story is heading. Castiel shivers, and Dean wraps his arm more firmly around him. “One day, Sam was in the middle of a working, an attempt at a defensive spell that would help protect us despite our limited remaining guards. Father came down from the tower and saw what he was doing, and flew into a rage. ‘Protection?’ he shouted. ‘Where was your protection when your mother was taken from us?’”
“And there it is,” Sam said with a sigh.
Castiel lowered the lid. “Have you gotten a rabies vaccination yet?"
John nodded and took another bite of his pork. “You’re free to go, boys. Work quick, Sam. Dean will probably need your help with his homework after.”
Dean lowered the gun. “Uh, hey, buddy. What’s going on in here?”
Yeah, thankfully he had had the hots for the gay twin the whole time. It was a little embarrassing he had tried to put the moves on Jimmy, but now he knew better. And he wasn’t going to have to start over from the beginning getting to know Castiel. Castiel was practically a friend already. He just had to make the move to the next level.
Castiel’s cheeks flushed.
“She shouldn’t name it! It’s a wild animal, not a pet.”
“Thank you for your input,” Castiel said wearily. But he clutched the card a little tighter in his hands.
“Well, not every Tuesday.” She pointed and Castiel turned, spotting Dean slouched at one of the tables, a beer clutched in one hand and his boots propped up on the chair across from him. He clearly had the night off.
“You have to just go for it sometimes. This way I’ll know for sure how he feels about me because there’s no way you could misinterpret that kind of advance.”
“That’s all I can do. Garth has more resources than I do. He’s also better at recognizing the symptoms of rabies than I am. Best case scenario, he’ll be able to sedate the raccoon, remove the hook, and get him all stitched up. Worst case scenario…”
“Of course. Dean doesn’t give out his schedule to just anyone. You must be pretty special.”
“Hello, Dean. I don’t recall giving you my number.”
Becky was a great receptionist in most respects. She was friendly and enthusiastic. The clients loved her. But she tended to focus on unimportant details so sometimes instead of noting what species of pet or what ailment the animal was suffering, she left notes about what kind of person the owner was or what color the creature’s coat was.
Milton Family Veterinary Clinic was a small family practice. Castiel and his brothers had inherited it from their parents. Castiel specialized in mammals, Gabriel handled reptiles and amphibians, and Balthazar worked with birds. The practice was doing okay for itself. They had also inherited their parents’ loyal customer base when they retired, but they weren’t established enough to begin attracting many new clients.
“Uh-huh, sure.”
Dean would have told him if any of his teachers had paired him and Castiel for a project. He wouldn’t have been able to keep that kind of news to himself.
“Take care, Sam,” Mrs. Jones called after him. “Have a good weekend.”
“Holy shit. I’ve had seven classes with Castiel.” He stared at Castiel, silently reevaluating all the interactions he had thought he had with Jimmy.
“Why can’t you give it to him yourself?”
“I do. I prefer cherry.”
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel took Dean’s hand in his and gazed into his eyes earnestly. “Your penis is perfectly proportionate.”
“No, that’s ridiculous. I had to step in because Ketch didn’t know shit about rabbits. I mean, I don’t know shit either but even I could tell he was doing it all wrong.”
“Is this seat taken?”
Her eyes narrowed. “Did he tell you that?”
“Cool. See you soon.” He hung up the phone and leaned back in his seat.
“But he apparently still hates me,” Dean said with a weary sigh. “And I’ve been nothing but friendly ever since. I guess that saying about first impressions is pretty true.”
He would remember Dean, though. Dean was pretty memorable.
Dean waved a hand dismissively. “All a big misunderstanding. But hot damn can he throw a punch. Did you see how ripped he is?”
Sam shook his head. “Just don’t go in there.”
“Yeah, I told him all about our little scheme,” Jimmy said with an apologetic shrug.
“He’s not rabid,” Charlie insisted.
Dean somehow managed to tear himself away from Castiel’s mouth for a moment. “What? No. I’m not letting you take Baby. Then how am I supposed to get home?”
Dean immediately went for his gun. “Sam?” He proceeded down the hallway slowly, listening carefully for any further disturbance.
Immediately the image changed to one of Dean after a hunt, covered in the blood and guts of some monster. But it had to have been an easy hunt because the Dean in the picture was grinning widely, an arm slung around Sam’s shoulder and even Sam was smiling a little.
Castiel gave his twin a withering look. “Must you always do this?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said. “And Sam. Will you let me finish the rest of my presentation now?”
“You’re kidding me, Cas. It’s a classic!”
“You can’t say something like that. Now I’ve got to check it out..”
“Because Cas is nothing like him.”
“He’s a lot less scary than he looks. It’s all resting bitch face.” But Dean’s smile faltered just a little.
Sam huffed and shoved Dean’s hand away. “First of all, it’s Sam. Second of all, I have a really big project due next week and I don’t appreciate you wasting time making out with Castiel instead of getting me home on time.”
“Nope,” Jimmy said. “I’m staying right here and enjoying the show.”
“Okay, Dad left us a note on the fridge that we’re responsible for dinner tonight.” Dean rubbed his hands together. “I’m thinking pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes. Give me a hand with the potatoes, Sammy. We gotta hurry to get this done.”
“Course not. I’m also a great ass and a hot bod,” Dean said with a teasing smile. “But hey, you could always do a written presentation on how charming and hilarious and totally sexy I am.”
“I’m telling you,” Meg said. “You need to jump on that ass.”
“Nope. You want me to open it now or do you want to wait until we get home to do it yourself?”
“And you,” John said, turning his attention to Dean. “You’re passing all your classes, aren’t you?”
“No way.”
The man flashed Becky a charming smile and a wink as he signed himself in on the clipboard. His eyes slid over to Castiel, but Castiel quickly made himself busy rummaging around in his lunch pail until the man’s footsteps had faded to a safe distance.
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face. “Forget about that for now. Moving on.”
Sam sighed. “So you are antagonizing him.”
Well, that was maddeningly unhelpful. It looked like Castiel would just have to wait and see.
He was just finishing his peanut butter and jelly sandwich when a very interesting man walked in with a small animal carrier tucked under one arm.
Castiel hunched his shoulders. “I was giving Sam a presentation on your best attributes.”
“Not going to happen,” Dean assured him. “I’m right on track to graduate.”
“Oh hell yes,” Dean crowed. He grabbed the collar of Castiel’ coat and yanked him into a searing kiss.
“A likely story.”
Sam tore out the rest of the staples and pulled the bag open.
“Whatever, Sammy. He say what’s in that bag?”
“I’ve never met real life twins before,” Dean said. “It’s pretty surreal.”
“I rescued him from my friend Ketch. Well, friend might be too strong of a word. He’s a moron and an asshole. Can you believe he was calling this little guy Nicholas? It’s lame and doesn’t fit him at all.”
Castiel smiled. “Good. Have a seat, Dean. I have quite a lot to say and you need to hear all of it.”
The man rose from his seat. Just as Castiel had thought.
Sam crossed his arms over his chest. “Oh, it gets worse. Trust me.”
“Relax, Clarence. She just said something about the critter being tangled in something and no other place being open yet. She’s on her way over right now so she should be in and out before our first appointment even shows up.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Alright, fine. Cas, what’s this picture supposed to show anyway? Other than the fact that I like to drink.”
“I hope you also told her that we don’t treat raccoons.”
Castiel’s parents had been fairly conservative people and their clients were pretty much the same. Mostly middle-aged people with families, seniors, and the occasional student on a budget. They probably would have been horrified to have such an outlandish presence in their clinic. But Castiel could only stare in fascination.
The popularity was totally warranted, as far as Dan was concerned. Jimmy was not only ridiculously good looking, he was also incredibly smart. Maybe not quite as smart as Sam, but nobody really was. Still, Dean had never seen Jimmy struggle in any of the general ed classes they had shared. He seemed to be good at every subject and he could explain it all patiently in a way that anybody could understand. So yeah, Dean could see why so many people wanted to hang out with him.
By the time Castiel worked up the courage for another peek, the man had plopped down onto the nearest free seat, the carrier tucked under his chair.
“But you like him.”
Dean froze, his eyes wide. That totally sounded like a sterner, deeper version of Jimmy’s voice.
“She just put down “New pet” with a couple exclamation points and a smiley face.”
“No,” Sam said. “You really don’t.”
“I don’t see how this proves anything,” Dean said. But he dialed the number anyway.
“Hello, Dean,” a deep, husky voice said almost right in Dean’s ear.
Dean’s face split into a wide smile. “I might have a chance after all. He’s flirting with me.”
The mornings were always slow. Mrs. Tran was their first patient at 7:15 and no one else was scheduled to come in until 8. But Castiel made himself available for anyone picking up prescriptions for their pets on the way to work or interested in prescription-grade pet food or supplies. Becky took the time to call everyone with an appointment the next day as a courtesy reminder and Meg made her rounds to check on the two small dogs who had been boarded overnight after being spayed.
“Hey, Castiel. I’m Dean.”
Castiel stared down at it. “Winchester Woodworking and Metallurgy.”
“Castiel Novak. So what brings Lucifer in today? Any ailments?”
“Still, I can tell you two apart so clearly just looking at you. I don’t know how I didn’t see it before. You don’t even look completely identical. Cas is clearly the hotter twin.”
“By twenty minutes,” Castiel muttered under his breath.
Sam turned around and blinked at the dark-haired senior standing in front of him. “Can I help you?”
“I’m free right now,” Dean said, giving Jimmy a challenging look across the table. Jimmy just raised an eyebrow. “I’m eating lunch in the food court.”
“Kinda looks like you’re doing a Powerpoint presentation with this whole computer, projector set-up,” Dean said, gesturing to the equipment. “A presentation on…”
Charlie slumped. “Seriously? That’s all you’re going to do for the poor thing?”
“You’ll get over that squeamishness soon enough,” John said, decisively cutting into his pork chop. “You’re too smart to let something as stupid as a dead frog get in your way.”
“That’s your interpretation. You don’t tell someone to get lost and then get them a present.”
“I confess I haven’t gone quite that far in most of my relationships,” Castiel said. “But I am also eager to explore everything with you.”
Yes, they advertised that they treated exotic pets. But exotic was a veterinary term for pets that weren’t dogs or cats. It didn’t mean they treated every animal out there. Gabriel had already had to turn away a woman who wanted him to treat an octopus and Castiel had had to explain to a panicked vacationer that no, he was not an expert on deer and couldn’t tell him over the phone if the deer he had struck with his car was fatally injured.
Dean didn’t say anything else, just took a long drink from his glass. Castiel didn’t press him for more, content to simply sit beside him. He wasn’t as good at reading people as Dean, but he could tell that Dean needed the silence.
Castiel cleared his throat. “Let’s have a look at Lucifer then. Can you get him out of the carrier for me?”
Sam leaned against his locker and checked his watch for the fifth time. Dean had promised to meet him at his locker right after school, but the bell had rung twenty minutes ago and there was still no sign of him.
But it was finally Friday and John was going to be away on a business trip all weekend so Dean would have a chance to be himself again. On weekends without John, Dean liked to bake. He had a big book of pie recipes hidden in his room and he was working his way through the book. John had made an off-hand comment about how it was such a shame Dean spent more time working on pie recipes than on his homework so Dean only baked in secret now like it was something he should be ashamed of. And that was pretty fucked up. Their family never would have survived without Dean’s cooking. Why should baking be something to scoff at?
He didn’t know what he had been expecting to find, but it definitely wasn’t dozens of brightly-colored gummy penises.
No, Castiel came for the bartender.
Thankfully, Dean rushed up a minute later. “Sorry, Sammy,” he said with a sheepish smile. “I ran into Cas in the hallway.”
“Nothing of import,” Castiel said quickly. He fiddled with the laptop open on the table. “I was discussing something with Sam.”
“I will admit, I’m better with animals than people,” Castiel confessed.
Cas squinted at his screen. “I think that would be difficult to convey in images.”
Huh. He’d half-expected ‘Castiel’ to be conveniently unavailable to meet at the moment and pick a day later in the week so Jimmy could show up wearing a different outfit and play Castiel’s part.
Sam didn’t have the heart to tease him anymore.
“Me,” Dean said with a manic grin.
“Maybe so,” Dean said. “But I’m still grateful for the help. I’m not a big math guy, but you made everything make sense. And it would only make sense if I spent more time with you to see what else you could teach me.” He smiled winningly. “You want to go out for drinks sometime? It’ll be my treat.”
Dean shrugged. “Eh, I do what I can to keep our little evil overlord happy. Say, doc, do you do house calls? Sammy and I were thinking of building a hutch out in the backyard for when the weather warms up.”
He’s well-satisfied.
“No,” Castiel says softly. “Not against this.”
Dean opened his eyes and met his rueful gaze. “Give in to our passion?” he suggested.
With an eager chirp, Dean scrambles up the trunk of the nearest tree. It’s faster for him to climb over branches and leap from tree to tree than it is to continue along the ground, and there’s a certain thrill to exploring the capabilities of this new body.
“Technically,” Cas said, eyes roving over Dean’s face, “that was a declaration of intent, not of feeling.”
“Then I take a certain delight in informing you that you’re wrong.” Crowley passed the phone back to Dean and steepled his hands together, resting his chin on top of them. “I know this one. He came to see me, about two months back, seeking my permission to establish territory here in Lawrence.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says easily enough, tucking his hands into the pockets of his jeans. “Fancy meeting you here.”
Castiel holds up a hand to cut him off. “Please. I won’t sleep right now, so I might as well keep watch.”
“Right.” Cas nodded, running a hand through his hair and leaving it even more dishevelled than before. “The announcement said service would resume shortly. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about.”
With that, she marched off, Alicia casting an amused look over her shoulder as she followed. “Do you want to go back?” Cas asked, squeezing Dean’s hand through their gloves. “If you just want to be at normal altitude again, I’d understand completely.”
“Well?” Dean asks. “I believe her.”
The cold water is a shock, but only a momentary one. His body adjusts quickly, and the summer air is still warm on his torso despite the lateness of the hour. Once he gets over the immediate discomfort, Dean has to admit it’s really quite pleasant.
“I know.” Castiel smiled sadly at him. “As do I.”
“Baby?” Cas repeats, raising that damn eyebrow again.
A lump rising in his throat, Dean turns to Castiel, who has been waiting with surprising patience. “You have the flares?”
Someone cleared their throat behind Dean, and he spoke wearily without taking his eyes from his father. “Yes?”
Castiel frowned. “Am I considered such a bore that no one would ever dream I act with some spontaneity?”
“Thank you for your time, Mr. Winchester,” he manages. “If I have any further questions--”
Instead, he turns the conversation back to the weather. The safest, least controversial topic of conversation in the history of human communication.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. It’s bad timing.” Dean shrugged. “If we’re both going to be looking into this situation anyway, I don’t see the point in pretending we’re just working together. That wasn’t how this started and we both know it.”
Kaia stands and lays a gentle hand on Claire’s elbow, leaning in close to whisper in her ear. Claire closes her eyes and nods, resting her head on Kaia’s shoulder for a brief second before pulling away.
They had agreed to raise Aliette together during their discussion on the ship, but to hear him state it as a matter of fact--
“Dean--”
For the second time that day, Cas is confronted with the unsettling knowledge that as much as he cares about the pursuit of justice-- and more privately, ridding the world of one more monster-- he really doesn’t feel this investigation the way the others do. He never knew Ryan Garland. The loss, for him, is much more abstract.
“Are there any other children?” Aliette inquires shyly.
Groaning, Milton took a step forward, then another, until Dean’s back was pressed against the stone rail of the balcony. It offered some support for his trembling knees, for which he was grateful, and with nowhere else to go, it brought him flush against Milton’s body and the unmistakable press of his arousal. Dean gasped at the feel of it, insistent against his own leg, and shifted slightly, seeking relief. Milton was kissing his way down the side of Dean’s neck, murmuring something indecipherable, and Dean spared a giddy thought for the formerly perfect folds of his cravat, now surely destroyed.
“I know.” Softly, slowly, Cas comes closer. One warm hand settles on Dean’s head like a blessing. Like forgiveness.
And not just because he doesn’t do relationships. Because if there’s someone he wants to be that person for, it isn’t Lisa.
Hannah nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on Castiel’s face. “You do not look well, cousin,” she said bluntly. “I ask you now, with all those assembled here as witnesses: do you believe your suffering has been deliberate, or in any way influenced by the Calornans?”
Castiel can hear the smile in his voice as he continues. “He was only fourteen years old, gangly and awkward. I was out in the yard, practicing my swordplay with our old retainer, when Sam came bursting through the door, eyes wild. ‘Look,’ he cried. ‘Look at what I can do.’ He snapped his fingers, and a jet of flame appeared. I was so surprised, I dropped my guard, and got a sword across the back of the knee for my carelessness. I still have the scar.”
He was still wearing an amused look as a footman sprang hastily to open the door to the drawing room. Castiel entered first, immediately noting the new furnishings in the room, but refrained from commenting.
“So boring,” Dean whispers to Castiel. “Come on. Bobby and Rufus have been working on something I want to show you.”
Clad in only his boxer-briefs, he stands in front of Dean, who reaches out to touch the tattoo on his chest. “What is it?” he asks.
“For precisely that reason, I presume. It would make an excellent place to build an empire that could be expanded later, after power and status had been consolidated. You should know this, Castiel.”
There’s a brief, tense silence, and then Dean nods slowly. “And you think that’s me.”
That voice. That, he does recognize.
“Dean.” Sam snapped his fingers near his head, startling him. “Hey. Did you fall asleep standing up?”
Their kisses are lazy at first, both of them still soft and sweet from sleep. Castiel is so warm under Dean’s hands, smooth skin over hard muscle and bone, and he’s pliant in a way Dean has never seen him before, sighing as Dean pulls him closer into his embrace.
He keeps himself busy, and when Benny or Krissy or any of his other friends ask about Cas, he just gives a small, sad smile and shakes his head, letting them interpret that how they will. He refuses to say it--
Before Dean could reply, the doorbell rang. He exchanged an amused look with his mother. “How many times do we have to tell that girl,” she said, shaking her head fondly.
Fighting back a hysterical laugh, Dean manages a small smile. “Hey, Your Highness. Good to see you.” His smile fades as he glances around the clearing and sees only Castiel, Jack, and the dragon, who is now curled up like a giant, scaly cat. “But where’s--”
There was a click, and the line went dead. Castiel hung up the phone, then sat back on the couch, hands clasped neatly in his lap. He was surprised at how unafraid he felt. Maybe it was just the relief of knowing, of being able to name their enemy. Or maybe it was shock preventing him from accepting that he was a target.
The king inclines his head, but says nothing. His stare is cold, but something burns in the depths of his eyes, something that has Castiel instinctively taking a step back. He skirts the edge of the trapdoor and crosses to stand beside the king, looking out over their surroundings.
At that, Castiel sees Dean’s resolve falter, only if for a moment. “What do you mean?”
Dean drained the rest of the tea in one gulp, wondering how on earth he was going to survive his torturous anticipation of the evening to come.
If he met Gadreel or any of those working with him, they would not find Castiel unprepared.
“Yes.” Dean rested on gloved hand on Castiel’s thigh, the weight and warmth of it steadying. “Let me give you this, Castiel.”
“I hate it when you’re right,” he murmurs as he pulls away.
“Anyway.” Dean squares his shoulders and offers Cas a bright grin. “Sorry my temper got the better of me. I think it must have been the cabin fever settling in.”
“Can we please listen to something other than Bob Seger on the trip home?” Sam complained as he slammed shut the door to Baby’s backseat.
The sound of Dean typing filled the air. “So, I just looked it up, and do we have to go to Starbucks?”
Dean drew his attention away from the ghost-like figure of Cas, and turned back to Sam. “You said something about a book you found in the library.”
“I love you, Dean.”
Losing Cas again to the Empty had ripped him apart, but months of spending every night with his partner left him with less nightmares and waking in cold sweats then he had since before Hell.
Dean reached towards one of the table lamps, ready to use it as a weapon if he had to.
Dean choked on his coffee. “What?”
Cas pushed Dean’s protesting body into the line, looking pleased with the many different options written on the menu overhead.
“Uh.” Dean was still caught off-guard by Willie Wonka over there. “Sure Cas.” He took the coffee pot from his hand and muttered a thank you.
The barista just sighed. “How do you want me to differentiate the two of ‘em then?”
“Awesome. I've officially lost my mind.” He laughed hollowly to himself, before taking another swig of his drink.
The teenager working the cash register interrupted his train of thought. “What will it be for ya?”
Cas stood there, disheveled from stumbling out of his car and not bothering to straighten out his trenchcoat. He was a silhouette, the streetlamp from outside the bunker lighting him from behind.
“Uh...I don't know man. I drink my coffee black.”
Dean stepped out and closed Baby’s door in the parking lot of Starbucks an hour later, kicking the loose pieces of gravel on the asphalt for the third time in two days.
the figments of his imagination, he really was screwed in the head.
The smell of rotting flesh, corpses of ghosts which in turn made more corpses. The numbers climb until he can't count anymore, just a metaphorical pile in his mind.
“What?” Cas asked, turning to look at him with a soft smile resting on his face.
Aside from killing monsters, that’s what hunters did best. Sitting around and sharing stories. As tiring and dangerous as their lives were, some hunts were worth sharing exaggerated and hyperbolic versions of, especially over drinks.
“Do you want some of mine?” Cas asked. “There's a little bit left, and I held it next to the heater. It should still be lukewarm.”
“Leave.” The Empty growled, but it wasn't directed at him.
Dean laughed.
“Aw. You're in love.” Sam held his hands up, forming a heart and mocking his brother.
“Yeah it's been a while, but I remember him.” Dean was blatantly ignoring Cas’s burning stare from beside him, and the fact that he had stabbed Lee through the chest just last year.
Dean pressed his mouth into a thin line and glared at him. “Yes, sure, fine. But we're not making this a daily thing.”
Dean couldn’t believe he ever agreed to this, but still, he begrudgingly followed.
“I wouldn't make that offer if I were you, Cas looks like he’d be totally on board.” Sam laughed.
“Heh. I should put you in that thing, Cas.”
His blood ran cold.
The monster’s words felt like poison in his bloodstream as it made its way to his already broken heart.
Guilt curled in his stomach, and the familiar feeling made him sick.
About how he had told Sam he just fell on a hunt. “Don't worry kid, you should have seen the vamp when I was done with him.” He swung his fist around in slow motion, pretending to punch an invisible enemy as his little brother giggled in childish bliss.
Cas didn't answer the Shadow, only rewarding its efforts with a glare.
“Yes you do.”
He pulled out his phone, and moved slowly to unlock it.
“I want you here.” Dean whispered to the ghost-like version of Cas. “But I want the real you.”
“Oh, just drink your damn coffee.”
“This time we're ordering for four though.”
He was still wary about doing…
“Black coffee isn't boring it's-”
Sam glanced at both of them, before his eyes reached the two cups on the War Room table.
“You’re just mad you didn’t get shotgun.” Dean said, closing his own door. “Besides, driver picks the music, everyone else shuts their cakehole.” Sam mouthed the words along with Dean, having heard the speech a million times before.
“Well then we'll just have to go back, all four of us.” Eileen put simply.
“I love you.” He got in the passenger's seat, taking his coffee from Dean’s still frozen hand.
“What are you two reading?” Cas asked.
He held his own face in his hands, calling out in one last prayer, voice breaking along with the damn in his mind.
“That's us.” Dean spat the words out quickly, turning around to take them from the barista’s hand. He rushed out of the door, the small tinkling sound of the welcome bell and the blood rushing to his ears drowning out the sound of Cas’s call from behind.
(Ok it was
He realized belatedly he didn't have anything to defend himself with.
Dean sat up suddenly, startled, and the edge of the table dug into his chest as he reached across for it. His desperation didn't leave time for doubt to creep in.
“Right... John and John, how could I forget?”
“And I love you because of
He picked up his phone again, and wished he could laugh about it with Cas.
“I made iced coffee.”
Dean threw his arms up into the air. “I can't believe this is the man I love.” His voice cracked like he was holding in tears of anguish from listening to Cas order.
Dean heard soft padding noises as socked feet walked down the hall, and there was a knock on the bedroom door. "S'your room too, Cas. You don't have to knock." He laughed, words slightly slurred from just waking up
Dean lazily threw his arms into the air. “Victory.”
It hurt to see that expression on Cas, and it hurt to be the reason that expression was there, whether he was real or not.
The phone beeped, waiting for him to speak.
“I would like to try a…” Cas methodically scanned the menu again. “A ‘Passion Tango Iced Tea,’ please.” The barista took no mind to the excessive air quotes.
There were tears in his eyes again, but he just let them flow freely.
