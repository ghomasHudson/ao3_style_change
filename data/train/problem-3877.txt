Thinking back to his dream Dean felt the anger hit him full-on, it caused him to run to the bathroom and let his content from inside him spill into the toilet letting it all flush away as he slumped against the toilet listening to his breathing for a while. The light in the bathroom turned on Dean didn’t dare move from the toilet as he took a glance up, Castiel was looking down at him.
Cas had parked in front of a shopping mall, with Dean "so let's get you something that you can sit on and shit," Cas followed Dean slowly "you alright Cas?"
Dean wasn’t even allowed to enjoy the stuff he used to do, which was to go out and hang out with his friends, that even changed. All the friends that had presented as Alphas didn’t want to hang out with him. Only a few Omegas he befriended were allowed to hang with him if their partners agreed with it.
Chase didn't bother using anything in the kit he brought with him he just went straight to the place he should've gone too two weeks ago.
"Oh I wont make you but they might." Dean pointed at the two Knights, while enjoying the fear he felt coming from the weaker Demons.
Dean opened his eyes that he didn't know he had shut, seeing Castiel smiling "nice song Cas," Dean quickly shut his mouth as the last word left his mouth "Cas?" Dean looked away embarrassed but Cas let a hand touch his cheek "I like it." Dean turned seeing Cas smiling "oh, you do? but you a teacher and its weird right?" Cas looked around the park "Well are we in school?" Dean shook his head "then, we are friends in school I'm your teacher, outside school I'll be whatever you want." Deans body shook at Cas' words "Kiss me, fucking kiss me!"
"Well, patience is needed and respect is a high need. Which is something both you boys lack with." Castiel stated kicking his horse forward to walk, being growled at by Dean and Sam while they trotted past him.
Stopping at a set of stairs, that wasn't being used since the 'accident'. "Go on do your thing, I'll just go back to class now." Arrow started backing away from the brothers before a hand stopped him. "Hold on, did you know anything about both victims or not?" Sam talked quickly, causing Arrow to shake his head finally allowing him to go back to class.
Dean knew Cas was watching him from the door, but that wasn't helping him. "Cas if you don't fucking get here, I'm gon-" Dean was cut off with the slam of his door, and Cas' lips on his. "Finally..." Cas' hands were roaming Deans body, his Grace was tingling Dean, inside out. "Fuck, Cas!" Deans hands were above his head while Cas' Grace opened him up, Cas' mouth was over his cock.
Castiel smirked not letting up his job to eat Deans ass, his slick smelt good, but it tastes ten times better. Adding a few fingers making the Omega completely at his mercy, moan and whither around on the bed.
The door swung open as Castiel stood before Dean, in less clothing Dean was expecting. "Whoa, Cas whats with the missing layers man?" Cas looked down at himself and shrugged. "I wanted to try sleeping, and this was the only way to get slightly more comfortable, but why are you here Dean?"
"Lets just say Shay thought it was a good idea to storm into a private meeting of some Demons, on his own, they beat him up badly. And I'm Matthew an old friend of Shay, so nice to meet you." Matthew answered just as more hurried footsteps came, revealing the Winchesters who stopped at the sight before them.
"Mish.. can I.. could I try something?" Jensen looked down at the light blue eyes that belong to his boyfriend. "Do whatever you're comfortable with," Misha wriggled a bit as Jensen straddled Misha surprising him.
"If I can deal with being female, and feeding you.. then you can deal with being a teenage girl." Castiel put one of his hands on his hips, staring at Dean who was actually pretty attractive. Dean clearly noticed the looks he was getting from Cas feeling good about being looked at like that.
Dragging the shopping cart through the store, groaning as he looked at the badly written list his stepdad clear wrote. He couldn't quite figure out what one of the items on the list was, he guessed it was cheese or something stupid and not important so he skipped it. Connor looking down not looking where he was going ended up bumping into a guy in a trench coat? "S-Sorry!" Connor quickly apologised walking around the man who was standing with a taller one that just smiled at him. Overhearing a part of their conversation making Connor walk faster.
“Ah, Daddy harder,” Dean whimpered out he felt bad for the cushion under his hand, just as he was going to cum Castiel pulled out, Dean was left hanging, waiting for any movement from the older man.
Dean watched the back of Castiel walk out the door, he strangely missed the man and the warmth of his hand on his thigh, throwing his head back
Dean moaned louder "Fuck, you kinky son of a bitch!" Dean tried moving his hips up to get some movement going on, but Cas quickly caught on and stopped him from doing so. "Yes! I'll be a good boy! Fuck, I'll be Daddy's good boy, Fuck your naughty boys little pussy!" Dean gasped at Cas, as well as what came out of his mouth but he was to far gone, to care.
"Well, well, well isn't he just a pretty little thing, you did good Cas you did well." Lucifer patted his brothers should before circling Sam, as Gabriel got in Sams face poking at him. "He's a cutie, can we keep it?" Gabriel momentarily stopped poking at Sams small body to look over at Lucifer. "Well it would be a shame to say not take him, he is our gift after all Gabriel." Lucifer snapped, moving to untie Sam and dragging him by his hair out the room. "We'll see you soon Cassie! Hopefully, our boys will be able to have play dates, they are brothers after all."
Once Dean did get used to having Cas inside him, telling Cas to move slowly. "Cas... Could we try a little faster?" Cas only nodded trying hard not to hurt Dean.
Dean and Cas had fallen into their own little routines. Castiel stayed at home to work while Dean took Jimmy to school then worked. Deans new job was working for his family friends. Just catching fish to eat sometimes he'll get to serve the food to other mer-people.
"Oh, don't give me the whole puppy bullshit look.. Just take me somewhere, when I get have to find people I hate dead" Arrow eyes widen looking at the two, "wait... why is it the people I don't like die?" Dean just smirks, where Sam shrugs "who's the next person you don't like?"
Dean was taken out of his trance when the man, alpha, walked up to him placing a hand on his shoulder. “Are you ok?” There was a slight concern in the way he spoke making Dean feel all tingly.
"Fine, just tired." Chase answered which was true. "Sleep then, we ain't stoppin' ya," Dean smirked at Chase who just sighed and rolled away from Dean, lucky for him Dean didn't say anything.
As both Winchester boys grew quickly, Dean was a lot more adventurous than Sam always sneaking out to follow the guards where they'd hunt deer in the creepy forest, just at the edge of the forbidden forest, Dean was always caught by the commander of the guards, Bobby Singer; Ellens husband Dean enjoyed his company more then his own fathers, him stepping on a stick would always break his cover. Sam, on the other hand, would always prefer stayed beside the warm fire learning to read a book, or being taught how the town worked with one of the servants teaching him until his big brother challenged him with the wooden swords they were given as gifts.
Bringing out the light, dark blue and black shell he kept in his hand, giving it a little kiss before laying down on his rock. "I'm going to miss you Cas..."
Castiel was allowed to do things he couldn’t do before like actually have friends and be offered other jobs which he had to politely decline as he had the family business to keep running and working for.
Jensen whispered as he began walked towards the parking lot, seeing Dean, Sam and Cas in the car, confusing Jensen at first but that was pushed a side when Chris shouted him. "Winchester! Get your ass over here!"
"Alright, we'll ask when he wakes up, see if he wants to." Sam agreed with his brother. Watching over the boy passed out on a bed.
"Do I get to keep my phone?" he asks waveringly, fear edging into his voice. "And, uh, my books and stuff?"
In the week Dean’s been here, Cas has taken him down three times, and yet Dean has never hit subspace.
“Look, Novak,” Dean had said, his tone so full of ire. “He’s a kid. Kids make dumb mistakes. I’ll give you anything you want, just don’t hurt him. Leave him alone.” But there was a tremor to his voice, and fear behind his eyes. Dean looked ready to beg, and God, Cas wanted to let him. But his men were right there.
whew, okay. this has become an entire story in my head, and it's summer, so i decided to write it. stay tuned for our two favorite boys figuring out how to have feelings...
Dean swallows, feeling the fire come back in spades, but Castiel slaps him. It's gentle, but enough to shove it back down.
Reaching out, Cas runs the backside of his knuckle down Dean’s cock, and even the small touch causes him to cry out.
“Nothing you need to concern yourself with,” Castiel says, barely sparing Dean a glance as he gets out of bed. “Are you getting hungry?” Reeling from the sudden loss, Dean sits up straighter, confused.
Dean tries his best to move away, control his desperate tears, but his body hurts too much. Alastair reaches toward him and wraps a collar around his neck, bulky and heavy and nothing like Daddy’s- Castiel’s.
Dean moans as Cas plays gently with his nipples, softly teasing his cock with the other hand. Dean fights his tied wrists. His cock grows even more desperate, precome dripping off the tip as Cas teases him.
Gabriel has been trying to convince him to sleep, but with a steady stream of caffeine and enough determination, Castiel barely even felt tired.
Not just the whip marks, all over his body, but the dull, almost numb pain that came with the thought of losing Cas.
"I can't do this," he blurts out, slamming the papers down on the table. "I don't- I know there's legal shit, or whatever, but I can't do this. This is- It's too much, Dr. Novak. I'm not going to do it. It's stupid."
After Alastair, Dean was hurting. It wasn’t just his back, and his ass, because those were sore. Dean’s fairly certain Castiel tells them they aren’t allowed to leave permanent or long-term marks, because it never hurts for longer than a day or so, but Alastair had him for at least a few hours and he’s still in pain. But that wasn’t why he was hurting.
“There are a lot of things we need to discuss, Dean,” Cas says. “You have my sincerest apologies for entering a scene with you with no prior discussion. I hope you trust that I only did that because the situation was extremely dire. You needed a drop, and I still need to get you into subspace as soon as possible.”
Dean rolls his eyes. Cas never lets him touch his own cock, always ties him up whenever he needs to touch it. But Dean’s bladder is about to explode, so he puts his hands behind his back, and Cas reaches around him and secures his hands in cuffs.
Dean doesn’t have time to think beyond that, though, because all of a sudden there’s a burn on his neck and he gasps.
Turning back around, Cas is holding their soft white ropes in his left hand. Pushing Dean back into the chair, he takes Dean's legs and secures them up and around the chair arms, tied right behind the knee. When Dean looks at himself, a flush works its way up his neck when he sees how fucking exposed he is, cock, ball and hole all on display for Daddy.
Castiel pisses him off, frankly, with how quick he can switch up between the hot and cold. Sometimes he’s calling Dean his sweet boy, with soft touches and gentle kisses. But other times, the bad times, he’s practically ignoring him. Dean’s just a toy, one that Castiel has no use for right now, and Dean doubts that he ever cared at all.
“This is your warning,” Cas says, voice quiet and controlled. “Either fix your attitude or I’ll spank it out of you.”
Releasing him, Castiel passes him a small packet of paperwork. A finger in the ring of his collar, Castiel guides Dean up from his knees to sit on a chair next to Castiel at the desk.
They had also gotten used to each other's company, Dean was trying to figure Cas out but he had no idea.
“Yes, absolutely,” Castiel answered with a smile, “I would have done anything to come back to Earth, and this? Well, this was one of the better options.”
“Cas has done some shady things in the past, but never once has he deserved what I did to him, Sam, and he sure as hell didn’t deserve it after what he was saying to me.”
They just burned their mother. Mary Winchester was gone once again, at the hands of a boy he saw as his son. A brew of anguish, guilt, and anxiety filled his thoughts and stomach.
“Talk to me about something— anything besides the darkness. That’ll make time pass quicker and Sam will get here so we can get on it.”
“We figure out a way to get out of this place, and we finish saving this town,” Dean suggested and Cas nodded.
“Dean…” Cas whispered, knowing where this conversation was heading. He shook his head, unsure of what to say or do, but knowing in his heart that whatever Dean was feeling guilty over was not his fault.
“Well, yeah, you know, I asked him what his favorite color was—green, by the way, and then how he felt about me, and well, turns out…things aren’t as one-sided as I thought,” Dean answered.
“I don’t think things through, Cas. I trusted Crowley over my own brother and you. I should have told Sam I was wrong when I let Gadreel in— begged for his forgiveness— but I was so stubborn. Then maybe…you and him would have been around to prevent me from doing something stupid. Prevent me from going to Crowley. Prevent me from visiting Cain and taking on the mark. We could have found another way to take on Abaddon—hell, cut her up, scatter her across the whole universe for all I care…then maybe…maybe Jenna would still be alive”—
“No,” Dean whispered, shaking his head. He sighed shakily. He wanted to be strong, but he was slowly letting his guard down, and he was oddly okay with it. He never felt ashamed or embarrassed to be upset around Cas, even if it meant crying, but all the pain Dean was feeling and mistakes he had made were exploding in his mind and building up uncontrollably in this moment—trapped in a basement with an angel, his brother completely unaware of where he was or what had happened to him in a town that had faced genocide because of something he had unleashed and taken on because he hadn’t thought things through.
“You mean so much to me, too, Dean, and to your brother,” Cas spoke finally after a few moments of silence, and that ripped Dean apart more than anything else Cas had ever said. It was so simple, but meant so much. Dean hardly had any family left, but at least he still had Sam and Cas. Still, Dean remained silent and still. He didn’t know how to react to Cas’s kindness. The tears had halted, but the sadness lingered on his face. Cas wouldn’t have it. Cas watched him carefully.
“We drink,” Dean said simply, passing out beers. Sam drank until his eyes were heavy. Cas drank and felt nothing, mostly to satisfy Dean. Sam left to sleep, Cas left to think. Dean remained, neither drunk nor tired.
“Can you hear them? Are they nearby?” Dean whispered at the top of the staircase, as if the soulless people had super hearing.
“What bond could you possibly share with Dean that would prevent him from joining me?” Amara questioned suddenly, taking a few steps back.
“Yeah, I mean, I just bottle it all up and hope I can get through it all without exploding. It’s easier that way.”
“You lacked proper medicine in your bathroom cabinets and I didn’t want to be a bother, so I thought sleeping might cure the pain, which was an incredibly hard feat to achieve, even if I’m not a full capacity.”
“Jack had to ensure that I would not go to The Empty again upon my death,” Castiel began, “So...I am human.”
Cas nodded slowly, unsure of himself. He placed his hand against the door and pushed, closing his eyes to focus on the task in front of him. Dean was supportive, and Cas didn’t want to let him down. It was difficult, but with enough focus and force, the door busted open.
“No, it’s not,” Sam chuckled in disbelief at Dean’s justification, “I’m glad you are opening up about this to me, but that’s my advice. Talk to him about it.”
"It would make sense," Cas whispered, "I mean, how else could I have become a human when Metatron took my grace? Apparently a small part of my grace remained in my body, even after Metatron took it, and in an effort to keep me alive it shifted into becoming a human soul. After I regained my grace...I guess the soul is still there. It would explain why I can't fly and get headaches, and why I share characteristics of both."
“Okay, Dean,” Cas confirmed. Dean sighed and walked passed him but paused. He placed a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“Having souls is what kept us from doing what we’ve always wanted to do,” the woman, Doctor Woods, explained, “And we have no intentions of torturing you…well, not just for the fun of torture.”
“Don’t defend me,” Dean snapped, emotion boiling in his small voice, “I’m the reason we are in this mess.”
“You don’t, Cas,” Dean replied with finality. Castiel’s head perked up in interest, a curious look in his gaze.
“Well, I feel like you are a good person. A righteous man with a good heart—I feel like you have your best intentions, and you are always a little angry but you have every right to be”—
“I agree with Sam,” Cas chimed in, sitting across from the youngest brother, still wrapped in his blanket. “Any hunch is worth checking out if it comes to Metatron.”
“Dude, seriously? When we had Metatron and I was beating him up you literally knocked the whole door down when I wouldn’t open the door, and you weren’t at full power then, either. You’ve got this.”
“You know, the two of you made a great team back with the ghoulpires—or whatever. I’m glad we had him to help us.”
Just as Castiel had taken a step forward to Amara, a soulless woman with dark blonde hair knocked him out with one clean shot to his head using a shotgun. He fell to the ground and the woman exchanged looks with Amara.
“I...haven’t even really had time to explain it to myself, honestly,” Dean started, “Yet at the same time, it’s there, constantly, at the back of my head, those last few moments with Cas.”
“I don’t know, Sam,” Dean answered, “I know that Cas is the bestest friend I have ever had, and I want him here. I want him back here with me. I want him to know that he changed me, too. I want to have time to figure things out, now that I know how he feels and now that we can. We know that someone else isn’t writing our story.”
“Yeah, everything is fine,” Dean lied, not wanting to talk about what he was feeling. “What, do you not think he deserves the break I’m giving him?”
“I mean, it feels pretty right to me,” Dean said with a chuckle, his hand dropping from Castiel’s cheek to rest on his shoulder.
Dean was cautious as he reentered the contamination zone. Bodies lay around, seizing to death or already deceased. He approached where the angel and him had seen Amara, but he felt no uneasiness. He knew she was gone, but Castiel lay on the ground in the middle of the street—unconscious.
“Where are we?” Cas countered, ignoring Dean’s concerning question. He sat up, leaning against one of the pillars of the room.
“Sam, I can’t even look at the guy, I don’t know how you think I can handle talking to him about it.”
“I want you to know that this is your home. You are always welcomed here, or any of the crap hotel rooms Sam and I may be forced to stay in. We are your family, Sam and I, always. You can tell me anything, and we will work things out. I want to know about your problems, I want to help, and I want to listen, that is what families do. You can have your own room and everything.”
“He escaped,” Dean informed. “I didn’t think he would figure out how to escape—he hasn’t been human for very long.”
“And we will be here to fight for it with you, Dean,” Sam confirmed, looking at his brother with a small smile. Dean nodded at him before looking at the angel, who bowed his head shyly. They saved a total of two hundred and eighty seven people that day.
The three looked on as the people in front of them passed snacks around and chatted. Some slept, others were up walking around. Someone had cracked open the vending machine and one woman who worked at the office they were staying in had kept some supplies in her desk, which she now shared with strangers.
“Everyone in this damn town keeps disappearing,” the woman, who was also in scrubs, mentioned, “But these two should keep us occupied for a while.”
He spent the day doing the same as the day before. He watched movies, drunkenly texted Sam, who informed him it would be at least another two days before he came home. When he couldn’t handle the day drinking any longer, he wandered back into the library of the bunker with his laptop and sat down, hoping to find a case, but the world was quiet. The regular day-to-day politics continued, but no matter how hard he looked, no one was reporting on anything particularly weird. He fell asleep in his chair, slumped over the computer.
“We captured Metatron”—Dean spoke, heading back in to the building, but Metatron was nowhere to be found. “Dammit!”
“What?” Dean rebutted defensively, not because he didn’t hear what his brother said but because he wanted a justification for it.
“I know...we always do, Cas, we always do…” Dean sniffled, composing himself. He felt better after confronting Cas, like one burden had been lifted.
“Yeah, but he’s incredibly old and has done a lot to help us, I think he deserves a week or two of resting and Netflix watching. You ready?”
The car ride was long and quiet for the most part. Dean drove, but he didn’t bother playing music. Sam didn’t mind. He was lost in thought about incidents that had recently occurred to him, and truthfully Dean was thoughtful as well. They sat in silence, with no real destination. Dean wanted an excuse to get out into the night that didn’t involve hunting down monster hybrids or worrying about the darkness, but something normal with his brother. A food run was normal, right?
“Dean…” Cas whispered slowly, shaking his head. He was unsure of what to do at this point, but he felt like he needed to do something.
This time, the road trip was not quiet. Sam was hurling information at Dean, and Dean would listen and respond while Cas would chime in occasionally. Instantly, the three were a team again, and Dean and Cas pushed aside previous thoughts for the sake of their new mission, a feat Dean was not foreign to.
“Sure, should we ask Cas if he wants to come?” Sam questioned, shutting the lid of his laptop as he stood.
“Home is not a box built on this Earth. Home, to me…is you. You and Sam, you are my home, and wherever life takes us, no matter where we are, as long as I am with the two of you, I am home.”
“I don’t either, not really,” Cas admitted, “I’m still very new to this experience, these…feelings, but I know for certain that I have never in all of my existence felt this way about anyone but you. How I feel towards your brother…it’s similar, but not quite the same. It’s easy to differentiate, but I’m unsure what you would call how I feel, other than a profound bond, but that seems to make you uncomfortable, which is mainly why I’ve never brought it up again…”
“Doesn’t mean I want them to kill anyone—I was just hungry, what their secret desires are has nothing to do with me, it’s all simply what they wanted to really do that was kept from them because of their conscious…whatever that is,” Amara explained, taking a step towards Dean. Cas interfered, stepping in front of the man next to him. She paused, staring at him.
“No, I don’t, really,” Cas opposed, “My trust lies with you, Dean, because you have shown me family. I tried to trust the angels, and they hurt me. You’re stubborn and you make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t trust you or follow you. You showed me something no one else has ever showed me, not even my own family.”
The process of trapping and curing the infected people was tedious and difficult, but they were naturally lured to the purity of the brothers and the angel. Their only desire was to infect the three but they failed every time. They had set up a system where Sam barricaded an empty office building where the cured people would go after being escorted by Dean and Castiel and would stay until everyone was cured or dead. Several times infected people had attempted to break through the barricade, but Sam had back up holy oil to cure those people.
“You can’t take all the blame, Dean,” Cas defended, placing a gentle on top of Dean’s, which caused Dean to immediately tense up but Cas ignored it. He knew Dean needed comfort and reassurance, whether he wanted it or not. “If you really think about it, I’m the one to blame.”
“Like how I used to look at Jess,” Sam answered quietly. Dean grew quiet, sinking in this new piece of information. He swallowed hard, unsure of how to react.    “All I am saying Dean is…talk to Cas about what happened, and ask him how he feels about you. I feel like the two of you never really talk, it’s just about the case. Do you even know what his favorite color is? I just feel like there is a lot you two can talk about—get off your chest, and it would be best to go ahead and do it now.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Cas objected, “Dean—I hold no grudge or hatred of you for what happened. I just want things to go back to the way they were before—for you to stop hating yourself for it and for everything you do. You couldn’t kill me, because something deep inside you prevented it, and that is enough for me. Do not compare yourself to the angels, who feel no companionship or compassion, when you are so full of it that you hate yourself the instant you think something you are doing is the slightest bit wrong. You couldn’t kill me, Dean, and that in itself is more devotion than I have ever received from any of my brothers and sisters.”
“Well, never mind him, bigger fish and he’s just one of us now. Are we heading to that town where those people are infected?” Dean questioned, shaking his head.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved?” Cas declared, the familiarity of the words forced a small smile on Dean’s lips. He bowed his head for a moment in remembrance, temporarily speechless by words so simple yet so thoughtful.
“Cas…” Dean smiled affectionately. The two watched each other with little smiles on their faces for several moments before more words were finally spoken.
“You have no bond with Dean,” Cas snapped, “You are just using that—you’re using him, putting him under a spell. I know that when I see it.”
“Just trying to save some time—if Metatron shows back up where he was then you two will be there. Amber also has some information on The Darkness.”
“Dean, you were doing what you thought was best—and your mind was being completely irrational from the mark, no one blames you for what you did or what you thought you needed to do,” Sam defended him, “Yes, what you did was terrible, but not something you would have done if you were in your right mind.”
“What’s happening?” Sam yelled form the other line as Dean panicked, running up to the seat where Metatron had been, the ropes that bound him cut.
“Yes! Of course! I would have called sooner but, well, we were caught up in that. They had a whole nest—hoarding bodies, they were talking about farming bodies for them to eat. They were kidnapping couples, forcing them to reproduce, well—you get the gist, they thought we were a couple, which is why they attacked us.”
“But he can die, can’t he?” the man pointed his gun to Dean’s lifeless body and suddenly Castiel was still. “Come with me or I’ll shoot him.”
“I-I don’t know, there isn’t one defining moment. I just thought...I am happy being your friend, Dean, and how I feel. Well I thought how I feel doesn’t matter, so long as you are still in my life.”
“Thank you, Cas,” Dean whispered, his face still full of pain despite no longer feeling it. His expression worried Cas, who positioned himself away from Dean now that he was healed; sitting in front of him so he could see his face.
"No," Cas admitted, "Dean, she said something that made me question things. She informed me that I was wrong - that apparently I do have some kind of soul, and that she can feel it."
A pause. What was he asking for? Dean swallowed hard. He swallowed the tears and he swallowed the fear. He wasn’t hiding anything. Jack knew. Sam knew. It was all out there now.
“Chuck said Cas rebelling was not part of the story, Dean,” Sam said, “If Cas did this because he loved you...Dean, that was real. That wasn’t Chuck writing.”
“I don’t know, basement maybe? Can you try zapping out and getting help?” Dean asked hopefully and Cas shook his head.
“Yeah, but you knew what taking on the mark meant,” Dean reminded, “That look you gave me when you saw it on my arm for the first time—you knew it was something dark, and if I had went to you first without jumping the gun and taking it on, we would never be in this situation.”
“Yeah, what do you mean?” Dean answered, slightly offended at the concern that he believed he didn’t deserve.
Dean had saved the people he had been accompanying. Sam frantically asked him where Castiel was, and when Dean informed him that they had spotted Amara and she had aged, Sam became worried.
“I do want to get out of the bunker,” Dean admitted, “But not for a case. Want to go grab something to eat?”
“I mean, come on, Cas, I think you and I have been keeping some serious secrets from each other. This thing that we have—whatever it is, I don’t know, but to be honest I don’t know how I feel, but maybe…what just happened… it was something right in this whole world of wrong. I’m just saying…I’ve been kissed by way worse, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want it, but I’ve always been too big of a coward myself to do it, and, well, I’ll try anything once.”
“You do?” Dean asked with relief. Cas nodded and turned his hand over, squeezing Dean’s lightly, lifting the two of them in the air.
“I did,” a small voice spoke from the corner of the room. She blended in—a shadow, but she was still there. She stepped forward; looking down at the bodies she had butchered and then up at the angel and man in front of her. It was Amara—still a young adult, a small satisfied smile on her face. Dean stared at her, overwhelmed by her presence. “They were going to kill you, and while I wouldn’t mind them killing you, angel, I can’t have them kill Dean.”
“I was so caught up, Sammy. I was so lost and angry, and he just got in the way,” his voice cracked slightly as he talked, his words slow as he tried to settle his emotions, “I learned that day that there are two people in the world that I can’t kill no matter what, you and him, but I came so damn close to killing Cas. I saw it. I wanted to. Every part of me told me to kill him, to take out all my anger on him, but something stopped me and I thank god or whoever-the-hell for that. He was saying how I had turned into a monster, and how eventually everyone would die and that he didn’t want to be the person to watch me destroy the world, because only he would stay alive long enough to see it,” he paused to glance at his brother, who stared at him with attentive eyes and an open mind, “He didn’t want to fight me. He didn’t fight back, but when I threw that first punch at him I was gone. He kept talking and I hated him for it. I hated how he wouldn’t swing at me, and how he kept coming back to me trying to calm me down. I just wanted him to stay away from me. I don’t know if it was because I wanted to hurt him or if I wanted to push him away, but he kept trying to calm me down, even after I had hit him so many times. He was bleeding and on the ground. I grabbed his angel blade and I raised it. I had every intention of killing him, and that scares the crap out of me, but I didn’t. I couldn’t, and I can’t look at him because I almost killed him and he still wants to heal me. He’s still putting me before himself. He still wants to stick around even though every part of me wanted to rip him apart when we were together in the bunker, just because he was worried about me. I don’t know why he puts me first. I don’t deserve it.”
But Dean was getting distracted by his hair, it was all over the place like he's had sex "nice hair Cas," Dean smiled at him.
"Damn, that pretty deep." Sam lifted Arrows shirt once he was laid on the bed. "Mhmm, Scarlet wanted me to tell you bout you guys and where you're staying, but I don't know you so she did this." Arrow didn't let go of Dean while Sam had to do whatever it is. It was painful, to say the least.
"Well, I'm happy I helped you would you like to stay?" Castiel offered wanting to wrap the small omega in his arms and hold him.
Before Dean even put a finger near his ass the door swung open, as the alpha walked in stopping short as Dean was sat in the chair with his legs on the desk still. "Uh oh.." Dean squeaked as Cas walked over. "Dean? Why are you in my chair?" Castiel looked at Dean his icy blue eyes were set on Deans green eyes. "It's comfy, and I got bored. I'm sorry Daddy." Dean lowered his legs and head as he stood in front of Castiel.
Dean glances up from Castiel and the girl he just saw and frowned tugging on his sleeve. “She got a baby, Cas.” Dean looked up to Castiel who just lets out a sigh pulling him along towards an alley, pinning him to the wall. “I need to stick my blade in something either her or you, Boy.” Castiel pressed real close to Deans body making his breath pick up.
"It's ok Sam, I'll be spending time with Dean today, so I hope you two will behave while we're out?" Castiel made two cups of coffee while Gabriel and Sam shuffled awkwardly around the kitchen. "Sure, I and Gabe can be good, right?" Sam looked towards Gabriel who was looking through the kitchen cupboards. "Oh yes, Gabriel and Sam can behave for brother Cassie."
"I'm fine Sammy.. can someone please tell me why I'm feeling so hot and shit?" Dean saw Sam, look at Cas while Cas looked back to Sam. "you were hit by a spell.." Dean groaned but he ended up moaning as he felt another shock of heat going through him. "W-what kinda spell?"
Dean knew Cas was in control, Dean was thankful for it. Dean always liked it when Cas would take control, no matter how hard he tried to hide it, Dean loved somebody taking control over him, his body, and Cas was just perfect.
" Dean slowly opened his eyes, lifting his head that was on Castiels chest. "Morning baby boy, how'd you sleep?" Cas stroked Deans cheek. "Good, better then a long time," Dean spoke while yawning.
"He was treating me like a bitch should be treated, cuz omegas are just useless toys for alphas.." Dean heard his Daddy growl. "That's not even the right thing to do, clearly your father has beaten the wrong information into you." Dean walked closer to his alpha rubbing against him.
Castiel couldn’t help but let out a laugh at the little boy covered head to toe in his father's blood, “well, it was kinky now let’s get this mess cleaned up, then it’s shower time.” Castiel picked Dean up since he did the gesture to Castiel. “Ok, Daddy.” Dean replied with a yawn.
Moments later, the car drove by a sign that informed them that they were in the town where Metatron had been spotted. It was bigger than a town, really, but lacked the hustle of a city. Dean turned to poke his brother who was still snoozing in the back seat.
“I guess I am just trying to say…I’m sorry. For everything. For attacking you, for leaving you here, for threatening you, for getting so angry when you were just trying to help. I’m sorry, Cas. I don’t want to feel guilty about this any more, I want to move on and for you to fight with us. Help us clean up this mess. Truthfully, there are only two people left in the world who really care about me— one is my brother, who is kind of stuck with me because we are family, and you…which is funny, really. An angel of the lord, so bent on saving someone like me. Why though, Cas? Why do you care about me so much?” Dean questioned.
Dean closed his eyes after a few moments, accepting and embracing what Cas was offering him. He loosened up. He let Cas in. It was odd as any first kiss—as if neither of them had ever kissed anyone before, but Dean found comfort in it. He kissed back, but softly, after realizing what was happening. The closeness lasted only a few seconds before Cas pulled away slowly. Dean was caught up in the surprise that he barely had time to think about what was going on before Cas moved away.
“No, no!” Dean was desperate to make Cas understand. He leaned closer, tightening his grip of Cas’s hand. Cas looked up at Dean with hurt and confusion. “I’m not explaining myself very good, am I? I am terrible at this kind of thing.”
“Yes, I do. We can’t just shake that off, Cas. What I did to you, back when Charlie was killed—that was uncalled for.” Dean spoke genuinely with self-hatred in his voice. “I shouldn’t have attacked you…that was the last thing in the world I wanted to do, but I was so angry and confused. Hyped up on The Mark, but that’s no excuse. You were doing what you thought was right, and it was all to save me. Hell, Cas, everything you do is to save me, and honestly…I don’t know why you and Sammy try so hard.”
“Shut up,” Dean snapped and Sam just laughed. Dean glanced at his brother, who was as happy as he was and he couldn’t help but smile. The two rode off, and when they got home after eating Dean crashed on his bed and rested better than he had in a very long time.
Dean nodded to his brother who shut and locked the door to the building. They had saved nearly two hundred people and they were all piled up in the office building, terrified but grateful. They formed community and chatted with each other. They demanded explanation, and Sam reassured them that he would explain everything as soon as the town was exterminated form the sickness.
“No, of course he deserves it!” Sam snapped, offended, “I mean, you have been acting awkward around him. Did something happen that you’re not telling me?”
“Y-yeah!” Sam answered with a chuckle, “I-I can’t believe it. She says she’s okay, she’s using her neighbor’s phone because I have hers. She’s probably so confused, I have so much I need to tell her.”
“Of course,” Dean mouthed grouchily, pulling up to the closest hotel he could find. The three men got out of the car and Sam checked them in as Cas and Dean remained outside by the car. Cas had begun to walk inside with Sam when Dean pulled him back.
“The man who attacked you—he’s a doctor, I think. He had a tag. Henry. He said his name was James Henry. I think he was one of the doctors sent here to diagnose the outbreak.”
“Yeah, and he revealed to the angels that he cares more about you than he could ever care about them. Doesn’t really go well for any political platform—that he’s fallen in love with a lesser kind. Although I must say, you do make good waffles.”
“Just eat your damn food,” the woman snapped at Cas before she darted upstairs with the men, “It’ll be over with soon.”
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas questioned softly upon seeing Dean’s expression, “Did I not heal you properly?”
When it was over, Cas was dizzy. He leaned over a chair, nearly toppling over it. He was greeted by Sam and Dean, who held him up and supported him.
“Dean…” Castiel interrupted, his eyes dropping, “We don’t have to talk about it. I...I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“Okay,” Dean agreed with a nod, “Just, Cas, don’t run off anywhere while we are asleep and not tell us, okay?”
“Y-yeah, I’m sure,” Dean reassured him with a smile. Cas smiled softly, bowing his head shyly. He didn’t know what to say or do. The two sat in silence for a few moments, Dean staring at Cas.
“Enough talking about it! Where is the demon tablet?” he demanded but his phone began to ring. Sam calling. Dean stared at his phone for a few moments before he answered, walking away from the man tied to the chair and outside to get privacy.
“Yes,” Dean confirmed, hastily interrupting Sam. He knew what he was going to ask, “Admitting this to me made him so damn happy it summoned The Empty, Sam. He didn’t mean it in a brotherly way. He made it pretty damn clear what he meant, and it worked. He tossed me aside, out of the way, and The Empty took him and it took Billie. I was saved, and now he’s gone.”
Dean informed Castiel of the situation as soon as he opened the driver’s door. Castiel was unhappy about Metatron’s escape, but he was eager to find out more about Amara and the darkness and help in any way he could. Back at the hotel, Dean shoved their belongings into the duffle bags and tossed them into the car. He was worked up and ready to get to the bottom of their problem, but Sam was taking longer than he had hoped. Dean paced the floor as Castiel sat, watching him.
Dean, on the other hand, was aloof and out of it. His mind was everywhere—on Amara, on Cas, on Sam, worried and feeling guilty over everything. Seeing Castiel’s healing progress made him feel slightly better about the situation that had happened only weeks before, but he still couldn’t forgive himself for how he had lost control.
“I was just so overwhelmed with emotion—I didn’t know how to react. I’ve never done that before, I just know sometimes humans find comfort in that so I just thought”—
“You’re right,” Dean agreed, averting his eyes. The more he talked, the more he had subtly closed the gap between him and Castiel, taking tiny steps towards the other man. His hand tapped the wooden table as he thought, watching his fingers rise and fall as Castiel’s remained motionless, a clenched fist placed on top of the wood. More silence. More uncertainty. More glances, looks, and unanswered questions. Castiel’s eyes remained focused on Dean.
“My own room?” Cas chuckled a bit, the concept seeming childish. “Well, I’ve never had my own room before.”
“No, Cas,” Dean interrupted again, shaking his head. Cas’s lips hung open, ready to protest, but his expression softened, waiting to hear what Dean had to say. “You didn’t know this would happen, and you were just trying to save me. I should be apologizing to you.”
“You’re human?” Dean said with a smile, a chuckle of disbelief in his words. At that point, Castiel could have come back as a ghost and he would have been happy.
“I…I don’t understand why you aren’t angry with me. Running through it in my head—I feel like this shouldn’t be your reaction.”
“Daddy—don’t be so mean! At least we have one, right? And he healed me!” the girl defended Castiel, tugging on her Dad’s hand. The man smiled and nodded.
“Good friends read in to all the warnings before they do something irrational, but Dean…I just wanted you back,” Castiel admitted, lowering his eyes shyly, “I was selfish, I suppose. I hated seeing you that way, so I went through with it regardless of the consequences.”
“I’ve always kind of known that I don’t see you the same way I see my brother—but that’s not a bad thing, it doesn’t mean we aren’t family, it just means…I feel…something more towards you that I’m unfamiliar with and it scares the crap out of me because I feel like everyone I care about gets hurt, and I don’t want to ever see you hurt,” Dean bowed his head, breaking his stare with the angel. He felt ashamed and scared, “I’m not used to letting my guard down like this.”
“No, Cas, it’s okay,” Dean smiled. “You can tell me anything. Secrets haven’t exactly been good for this family, so it’s okay.”
“Dean,” Cas whispered, tapping Dean on the arm. His attention instantly turned to the angel, who pointed at three bloody dead bodies on the ground. Dean recognized their faces—two of the men, and one woman, butchered from who knows what. Doctor Woods was not among the dead.
“I didn’t know angels were capable of feeling this way either, Dean. I have been around for an extraordinarily long time, and I didn’t know. I didn’t know I could feel this way, until I met you.” Castiel explained, shaking his head, “What I do know, is I have felt friendship before, and I have felt brotherhood and fatherhood, but how I feel about you as opposed to Sam, or Eileen, or Jack...it is just different, Dean. It...it makes me scared, in ways I have never feared before. It makes my chest hurt, and palpitate, and makes me nervous.”
“Yeah, well, guess even the good doc can’t hide form the darkness,” Dean spoke. "I'm guessing things with Amara didn't go over so well with you?"
Cas bent down to meet Dean just as the door slammed shut from on top of the stairs. Dean hunched over, his face to the ground and his arms cradling his hurting stomach.
“What do you mean?” Cas asked softly, “Dean, we are way stronger than these people, we can get out of this mess.”
At some point during the drive, Dean pulled over and Sam switched spots with Cas. Sam wanted to sleep, and since Dean wasn’t tired and Cas didn’t sleep, he agreed that Sam should get some rest. They continued their drive with Cas in the passenger seat, Sam stretched out in the back, and Dean driving. The ride was silent for nearly half an hour, Sam’s gentle sounds of slumber echoing from the backseat. Cas stared out the window. Dean stared out on the dark highway.
“Yeah, this job will do that to you,” Sam laughed, “We’re going to have to get him off of that eventually.”
“Dean...what happened?” Sam spoke, demanding a straight answer, “Cas was my friend. I want to know what happened to him.”
“I care about you. Some of the things I have said, didn’t say, done, didn’t do…you didn’t deserve that. Truthfully, I didn’t understand it—how I feel, and I still don’t. The people who I care about…they die, maybe that is why I have always pushed you away, or maybe because you and I aren’t just friends. I once told you that you and I were family, and that you were like a brother to me. You and I are family, Cas, but I don’t feel the same way about you that I do about Sam. I tried, but I just can’t, and I’m done lying to you and I am done lying to myself. Secrets tear this family apart, so this is me confessing to you that I care about you…that I, I need you, and I want you here…no more guilt, no more secrets, no more lies, from both of us. I am being honest right now, and damn is it hard, but it is better than keeping it inside and regretting it later.”
“He’s okay,” Dean answered automatically. “He’s binge watched at least five shows on Netflix by now. I guess not sleeping has its perks.”
“Uh, she said she won’t be able to meet us until morning,” Sam informed, looking at text messages exchanged between him and Amber. “So, hotel?”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas answered softly and the two turned to watch Sam as he returned with their room keys.
“Let me help you,” Cas whispered, sitting Dean up. He helped him back up against the pillar and the two sat down, Dean leaning on Cas for support, his face scrunched in pain and his body hunched over in an attempt to ease the throbbing in his stomach. Without permission, Cas pressed his index and middle finger against Dean’s forehead and Dean could feel the pain drain away, relief pouring in as Cas healed him, “We need you at full strength if we want to get out of this.”
“Dean,” Cas spoke, gesturing to a table in the kitchen that conveniently contained their belongingness scattered out along with other objects that didn’t belong to them—blood splattered pictures, cell phones, little personal belongings. Dean grabbed his shirt and put it on under his jacket, stuffing his pockets full of the knives he carried and the gun. Cas stood by, his eyes searching the place. They finally landed on the floor a few yards away from them.
“You know your use, Metatron,” Cas interjected aggressively. Dean stared at the angel next to him, unaccustomed to seeing such behavior. “The demon tablet—you stole it.”
“Enough with your games, Metatron!” Cas yelled, stepping forward. Dean pulled him back, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Worse than bad, Sammy,” Dean admitted, shaking his head with shame as he recollected the events that had happened.
Swallowing heavily, Dean’s eyes roam over the many pairs of panties in his underwear drawer, eventually choosing a flimsy, lacey thong that had proven to be one of Castiel’s favorite. Dean wanted to laugh at how pathetic he felt. Even choosing his panties in an attempt to please the man.
Cas pushes something in front of Dean, and Dean tries to figure out what he’s looking at when something is pushing into his hole. Dean gasps, torn between pushing his hips down to meet it or pull away and make it easier for his caged cock.
“Mr. Winchester?” Dean looks up, momentarily forgetting where he is. His secretary looks in from his office door, a pleasant, patient smile on her face.
“Two weeks,” Cas says. “The cage goes on when you get home. And yes, I’ll be teasing you the entire time.”
“On my-“ Dean stumbles, pushing against Cas’s hands, but Cas doesn’t budge. “My cock, please, spank my cock, Daddy?”
“You’re so good for me, sweet boy,” Cas whispers. “So tight and hot, fuck-“ Cas fucks Dean fast and rough, chasing his pleasure and showing no interest at all in Dean’s. And, Dean thinks sluggishly once Cas has finally come inside of him, he won’t drag it out because it makes it worse for Dean. Not that they’d ever admit it, but Dean and Cas do care about each other. In the sad, angry way two broken people can. That might be messed up, but all Dean can think about as Cas slowly bathes him and wipes away his tears, ties his wrists behind his back and buckles his collar into place, is that even if he could leave he doesn’t think he’d want to.
Dean drives home as fast as he can, and sighs when he smells his Mom's soup simmering on the stove. Dumping his bag in his room, he goes into the kitchen. Mary is stirring something in the pot, checking the heat, but she turns and smiles at her son when he comes in.
With that, Cas steps away again, pushing Dean’s head back onto the bench and disappearing behind him, Dean hears the snick of his belt, the cap of a bottle of lube, the soft whisper of Cas’s hand when he’s touching himself. Dean doesn’t know how much time passes, but it’s enough for the machine to change settings again, going faster and harder and deeper and for the cage to become almost painfully tight, the pleasure boiling in his stomach and the need building to a point where it’s almost unbearable.
Cas practically has to carry the omega downstairs, because his legs can’t properly support him anymore. His entire body is aching for a knot, and he says everything he can think of that might convince Cas to give it to him.
Castiel's hand speeds up, and Dean pants, trying his best to push his hips forward and hump into Castiel's hand.
“Aren’t you going to thank me, toy?” Alastair asks smugly, his eyebrows raised, tone suggestive and hungry.
From that whole experience, he learned that he couldn’t have any emotional connections, especially not the romantic kind. Castiel Novak fought for everything he has. He was birthed by shitty, druggy parents, who pawned him off on shitty, druggy relatives, and he had to crawl and drag himself out of the hole that his parents had dumped him in. His past fucked him up.
Fairly nonplussed, Dean rolls over to watch Castiel talk to whoever it is called him, because his serious face is seriously sexy. One eyebrow raised, piercing eyes even more scary.
“Next time, you’ll beg better, won’t you?” Castiel asks lowly. “You’ll try much, much harder to earn my permission, won’t you? Because you don’t get to come today. No matter how much I touch you, you don’t come.”
“Daddy,” Dean begs, cheek stinging. “Daddy, please, I wanna come so bad, please touch me. I’ll do anything. I’ll be your slut, your good boy-“
But all of them stuck in the same house, even for a few days, can be a lot, so Cas and Dean enjoy the silence on the short drive over to the mansion.
Without another word, Cas pushes the ice pack onto Dean’s cock, groaning when his boy yelps, panting desperately.
Dean feels pretty pathetic for being so upset about it. In his current situation, this shouldn’t be his biggest concern.
His own instincts were screaming to take care of Dean. He’s never seen a submissive so obviously in need of care. Maybe that’s why he’s so attached to him already? He isn’t sure.
“What do you want me to do to you?” Cas asks, back turned to him. Dean wants to get up and look at what Cas is doing, but he isn't sure if he's already in trouble.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel pushes past him and walks as fast as he can to the office most of his men use dean in, taking sight of his boy still shackled to the desk. His legs are spread wide apart, arms tied behind his back, and he’s shaking with tears. When Castiel looks closer, he can see whip marks all up and down his back, cruel bruises on his ass and on his inner thighs. There’s a tight cock ring on his boy’s cock.
Rolling his eyes, Dean starts to take his shirt off, and all of a sudden Cas is behind him. Wrapping his arms around him, Cas starts to kiss up Dean's neck, and his breath catches as he struggles to keep unbuttoning and get the rest of his clothes off.
“I don’t want to,” Dean says, trying to pull out of Cas’s grip. “I don’t- I don’t have to tell you anything."
Cas’s fingers are threading through Dean’s hair, and then yanking so hard that Dean’s entire upper body comes off of the bed.
Castiel pushes the gag back into his mouth, kissing his forehead before sitting back down. He edges him a few more times, his own arousal bubbling in his stomach, cock so hard it hurt.
Cas catches him on the way down, Dean holding on to him like he’s the only things tethering him back to reality, whispering filth into his ear.
“Oh my God,” Dean whines, his knees completely buckling, because Cas just turned on the vibrator on the plug up his ass.
The hard chairs also make Dean hyperaware of his accessories. The stupid things stupid Cas put on him hours ago, refusing to take them off before leaving for this party. Every time he shifts, he has to bite back a panicked moan at the stupid plug up his ass, then a groan at the squeeze of the stupid cage on his cock, and the stupid sound Cas just had to include in there.
Dean can almost feel the air in the room get a whole hell of a lot thicker. The tension in Castiel’s shoulders only grows, the worry in his eyes and reproach tearing Dean apart.
Dean almost completely collapses when Cas goes down to his knees and swallows down his entire cock, cage and all.
Dean groans, Cas’s rough voice in his ear, going straight to his cock that for some reason, Cas never locked back into his cage. Dean barely processes his Master’s words. Master kisses down his neck, hands wandering down his chest, down to his cock. Dean gasps as Cas teases the tip between his fingers, the other squeezing his balls.
Ice runs through Dean’s veins, stopping him cold when he realizes that Sam wasn’t present in his thought process. Not even a little bit. Stupid, he thinks. It’s a job, not a relationship. You’re here for your brother, don’t be fucking stupid.
“Sam has asked me to come to Stanford and guest lecture for their forensic linguistics program this summer,” he says. “And I was wondering if you would like to join me for a bit of a vacation. It’s in two weeks. I’ll be on break, and I figured you could take a week or so off, considering all the time off you’ve been saving.”
Then he’s kissing his neck, sucking and biting gently, kissing all the way up, soft lips on his forehead, and Dean never stood a chance.
Dean had forgotten about the door, and he feels a flush of embarrassment at the thought of any of his co-workers seeing him like this. Dirty, debauched and filthy. And Cas tells him constantly that it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and that he doesn’t need to think about why he likes it so much, but that doesn’t matter.
i am gonna say that i think that if any of you guys ever have those issues, with depression and anxiety etc, 100% of what you're feeling is valid, and you're super not alone in this world, and it does get better. i struggled some, and i feel like i can say this because i don't have any irl friends here - but i've decided that i and whoever is reading this are now automatically besties - but it does get better. i'm feeling better than i have in a while. don't be afraid to reach out to people, because i couldn't have done it alone.
“I’m sure you have some things you want to ask me,” he says gently, and Dean blinks, suddenly irrationally terrified that Castiel can read his mind.
“What the fuck did you do, slut?” Michael asks, walking up to him and grabbing his collar. “What did you fucking do?”
"Jesus fuck, fine, whatever," Dean huffs, staring out the window. "You don't have to be a dick about it."
He just has to sleep. He only feels like shit because he hasn't slept well in weeks. If he takes a nap, then the screaming inside his head will go away.
whew. okay, sorry, we're going to ignore the fact that i was gone for forever. i'm still here, i was just having depression issues lol
“I’m hungry,” Cas says, and Dean blinks. “I think we need some breakfast. But first, I’ve got to do something about this.”
“But-“ Dean struggles for words, trying to figure out a way to explain to Cas that he needs it on. He needs to feel something that tells him Cas still wants him, even if it’s for something like sex. Dean can be useful. He can be good.
Dean doesn't understand. Castiel can see it in him, despite the fact that he nods quickly, opening his mouth for more food.
Dean doesn't waste any time, so much pent up frustration and arousal from the last month that it barely takes any time at all before he finally comes, pulling in gasping lungfuls of air, coming down from his orgasm to Cas's sweet touches and hands running through his hair. Cas pulls his gag out, and the second Dean has any breath, he turns to Cas with an eyebrow raised.
Bad timing. Today was a very important meeting. They had a possible contact from Michael's side who was willing to share information on the leak in Castiel's hierarchy, but nothing they seemed to offer him swayed him. Gabriel had been trading emails with this guy for a week, and their tech expert, Charlie, couldn't seem to track him.
Desperately, he tries to look up, face him as much as he can with how tight Cas has tied him up. With the last shred of mercy he has left, in his dark, twisted soul, Cas moves over, reaches out and threads his hand back through Dean’s hair, the smallest, gentle tug. Dean leans into his touch, turning his head as best he can to nuzzle Cas’s hand.
Castiel nods, although on the inside he’s thrilled at the prospect of watching his boy struggle. Dean started out feisty. Always fighting, and it just made the moment when he finally broke into Cas’s sweet boy so much sweeter.
The room looks like a study. There are bookshelves absolutely stuffed, and Castiel sits at a desk amidst the mess, brow furrowed in concentration.
“I’m glad you did, Dean,” Castiel says, and that smile is genuine. “Now, a discussion. Submission, while typically sexual in nature, under no circumstances requires any kind of intercourse. Intimacy, yes, but not necessarily sexual. That being said, you responded beautifully to what we did yesterday and I think you enjoyed it.”
“Where is he?” Castiel asks, standing up from behind his desk, looking behind Alastair. “He’s a little tied up at the moment.”
It’s not enough. Castiel needs to drop him further, but Dr. Novak knows that he can’t push Dean any further.
“You will,” he says seriously, eyes shiny and determined. “I’m not going to let you go through any of this alone, I promise.”
“There’s this… incredible place in Palo Alto,” he says. “My sister owns it, and typically rents it out but she’s amenable to letting us to stay for a week.”
“Fuck off,” Castiel had growled into the phone. Frankly, Dean finds it hot. Worry starts to mar Castiel’s expression, and his grip gets tighter where he’s still holding Dean’s hand.
“Such a slut,” Castiel murmurs, almost to himself, adding another finger. Dean’s cock is leaking precise, and Castiel swipes his unlubed fingers through it, unstrapping Dean’s gag and pushing his fingers into Dean’s mouth.
Looking up at the clock, Dean realizes he only has ten minutes left before they have to leave, and he’s not ready to take even more of Master’s disappointment.
“And miss the chance to see you all decorated and pretty for me?” Cas rumbles from over his shoulder. “I don’t think so, boy. Watch your tone.”
Cas’s hand on Dean's cock, he pulls Dean up, who rushes and struggles to follow him, yelping in pain when he’s just a little too slow. Cas grabs Dean’s boxers from where they were thrown onto the floor.
Dean isn’t sure how much longer he can deal with the dildo fucking him, the fingers prying and pinching and spanking. It all feels so good, it’s all too much.
Dean’s hips stutter, but he can’t help it. He pushes out again, trying to get some purchase on something. The couch, Cas’s leg, something.
Sure, he had played around with a kinky partner a time or two before, but that was maybe a few spankings and a pair of panties, both of which he’d never admit to. Nothing compared to what he does with Cas, or what Cas does to Dean.
“He called me from a cell phone that he found, and I can figure out how to get his location from that, but I can’t exactly just walk in there and grab him.”
excuse on his mom one too many times. She passes him a bowl of the soup, and he can't eat more than a few bites without his stomach turning.
“You’re going to be spending most of the day with me,” Castiel says. “I have several meetings, and you’re going to be keeping my cock warm for most of that time. You’ll get breaks, though, as long as you’re good.”
"Just-" Dean waves his hand around. "Okay, if you don't let him in here, I'm gonna get out of bed and go find him myself."
“Um,” he says, a flush slowly creeping up his neck, eyes glued on Cas’s hand. “It’s- I don’t know. You should know. You were there.”
He makes his way down the stairs, swallowing his humiliation and meeting his alpha in the kitchen, kneeling down and trying not to disturb his aching bladder.
“If you choose to have our relationship be nonsexual, I can train you in service submission and other similar dynamics,” Castiel says. “And whatever you choose is okay. Do what you want, not what you think I want for you.”
Dean already knows Cas has been hard since the beginning of this whole thing, so he’s only a little surprised when he feels Cas start to press in, a low groan coming from his Master’s throat, the weight of his body laying over him.
Castiel can’t even begin to describe the rage he feels at the thought of losing Dean. Dean is his. And he’s lost him. Castiel doesn’t even realize he’s seething until he realizes he’s shattered his coffee mug, thrown it clear across the room.
"Are you..." Castiel cuts himself off. "Are you sure, Dean? I- I won't be gentle. I'm too rough. With the people I'm attracted to, and you're so beautiful, I-"
Dean can almost feel the air in the room get a whole hell of a lot thicker. The tension in Castiel’s shoulders only grows, the worry in his eyes and reproach tearing Dean apart.
“Open,” Cas says, giving him some more waffle. There are times like these, with the teasing words and the soft feelings between the two of them where Castiel can trick himself into thinking this is real. Whatever he and Dean has, it’s by choice, not because Dean’s brother’s life is on the line here. What Castiel hasn’t told Dean is that even if Dean did screw up, Castiel wouldn’t kill Sam. In fact, he’s grown to like the boy. But he couldn’t imagine the pain his beautiful boy would be in, and after hearing him speak of Sam, Castiel couldn’t. He reaches out to cup Dean’s face, run a thumb along his adam’s apple, smiling softly at the thought of his boy missing him.
Dean didn’t know which one would be worse. If he got the cage off, then he could come, but knowing Cas it wouldn’t be that simple. But if Cas just turned the machine off, it would take him a long time to get over how desperate he’s feeling. There wasn’t much Dean wouldn’t give for an orgasm at this point, after an hour on the stupid machine.
“Before we get started, I wanted to ask how you were feeling about this,” he says seriously. “Do you still want this?”
For a second, Dean thinks Castiel is actually going to deny him, but then he feels a hand reaching into his pants and Castiel is pulling him over his knee, unbuckling his belt.
“Too bad,” Cas says. “Tell me.” Dean still stubbornly refuses to respond, so Cas sighs, tipping his chin up with a finger before reaching across to slap him. Dean yelps, cringing, and then looks up to Castiel.
When his mom leaves the room, he quickly puts the rest of his bowl down the disposal and drags himself up the stairs to his room, not even bothering to shower before crawling under the covers.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whimpers, his ass throbbing, the fight bleeding out of him. “Please, Daddy, no more.”
“It’ll hurt,” he says. “And I know you like that, but I won’t let you come. I won’t touch you, won’t give you permission and I’ll ice you down and lock you up after. Do you want that?”
Almost falling over himself, Dean gets ready in record time, running past his Dad out the door, ignoring his growling stomach.
"So soon?" Cas asks mockingly, pulling the rest of Dean's clothes off. "What a needy little slut you are. That's okay. Daddy will take care of you."
"Ma'am, would you please give us a second?" Castiel says, addressing the principal, who nods and walks out of the room. As soon as the door closes, Dean startles when he feels Castiel's hand on his shirt. Manhandling him up and over his knee, Dean tries his best to fight him way out of Castiel's grip, but his hands are being tied behind his back with Dr. Novak's tie and he can't get away.
Annoyed, Dean turns away from Cas, putting his bag down and pretending to look through the file cabinets just so he didn’t have to look at him.
“Every time you look away from yourself in the mirror, that’s a day in the cage,” he says, right before he swallows down Dean's entire cock.
The first time Cas fucked Dean, he had spent close to an hour opening him up with his tongue and his fingers, filth spewing from his mouth. Cas waited until he was so desperate that he was begging for it, just like the slut and the whore Cas kept referring to him as. And then Cas never stopped.
Dean groans, his cock rubbing against Cas's thigh, leaking all over his pants. Once Cas reaches 10, Dean is gasping, trying desperately to keep himself from humping his leg.
After they had grown closer and more comfortable with each other in the Dominant/submissive dynamic, Cas’s order and control extended into their daily life after countless conversations Dean didn’t want to have. He trusted Castiel. Always has, and he knows that he wouldn’t ever truly harm him. He couldn’t.
Dean looks down at his half-hard dick, unable to ignore how hot he was for this whole thing. Ever since Cas brought it up three weeks ago, Dean’s been dreaming all about what Cas is going to do to him. How it was going to feel, what he’d have to do.
Slowly, Castiel moves his finger in and out of Dean’s hole, pushing up against his prostate and reveling in the sub’s beautiful desperate moans.
Desperately, he looks around for Cas, and his eyes land on his Alpha, who was desperately aroused and staring straight at him. Standing up, the Alpha went down on his knee next to the chair, kissing the omega’s forehead and pushing his sweaty hair back.
The first thing Dean notices when he wakes up is the dull throb in his head. It’s a low ache, like a band wrapped around his head. Groaning, he tries to sit up, his brain sluggish.
“Really?” Cas says, his voice some mockery of surprise. “Because I seem to recall a certain naughty boy having an extremely rough morning, refusing to eat breakfast, and swearing at me just now.”
“It’s been a week, Dean,” Cas muses. “Are you that much of a slut? You don't come for a week, and then I barely touch you, and you're dripping?"
These last few nights haven't been awkward, per se, but it had been a week so Dean was in his own bedroom again, and Castiel practically ached of loneliness. At night, when he most wants his baby boy, he doesn't have him and the bed feels entirely too big. Needless to say, he hadn't gotten much sleep last night, and is having a hard time focusing at work today.
"You look so beautiful with your mouth stuffed with dildo and tears running down your face," Cas murmurs. "So open and exposed for me. I like this."
Swallowing, Dean tries to ignore how good it felt when he turned over and his cock dragged across the sheets. Whimpering, he pushes his hips one more time, desperate for some kind of friction. Cas hasn’t touched his cock in days, instead playing only with his hole.
He won't hurt me, Dean thinks, his brain a little fuzzy but more sure of the words than anything else in the moment.
"When you're gagged, you safeword through snapping your fingers," Castiel instructs him, opening a drawer on the side and picking up a penis gag long enough to fill his mouth but not his throat. "Twice for yellow, and rapid snaps for red. I will always listen to and respect your safewords, Dean. Use them."
Dean looks down at his half-hard dick, unable to ignore how hot he was for this whole thing. Ever since Cas brought it up three weeks ago, Dean’s been dreaming all about what Cas is going to do to him. How it was going to feel, what he’d have to do.
In a weird way, the two of them have been connected since high school,  Cas found Dean cutting class out behind the library. John had gotten drunk again the night before, and Dean had spent the better part of an hour listening to how ugly he was, and useless, and worthless and how much John wished he had never been born.
"You don't touch without permission, boy," Cas says, unknotting his tie and wrapping it around Dean's wrists, looping it through the headboard.
“You know how to safe word,” Castiel says, trying to act as unbothered as possible and not let his bratty boy see how much he’s affected.
"And I love you," Dean says. "And you know what two people who love each other do? They don't kick each other out. They work through crap and hold hands and all that shit. You didn't let me have that before, but I want it now."
All in a rush, Cas’s finger pulls at Dean’s belt loops until he stumbles backward. Cas catches him, leading him over to the couch then puts him over his knee, one hand holding both Dean’s wrists.
He wants to snap at her, tell her to leave him alone but his stupid subby biology would barely even let him make direct eye contact with her, not when she's using her stupid Dom voice.
Gabriel sighs. "It seems he's heard about your boy from the leak. And he wants you to give him Dean."
Retreating into his office, he shuts the door behind him with a sigh, shrugging his jacket off and running through the things he had to do before leaving. Cas says leave at 7, but he might not be able to swing that today.
Connor woke up at the end on the bed, not knowing when he fell asleep but was covered in a coat. The men were chatting in the room about him.
Cas added two of his finger as well as his tongue, Dean was a moaning mess while Cas was doing this. "Cas, fuck i need you... please?" Dean whimpered as Cas pulled away.
"If that's what you want," Dean smiled up at the boy on him, placing a hand from his hip to his ass his middle finger slipped inside his ass slowly, Dean watched the reaction from Jesse who sighed and leaked more slick as he moved his finger slowly, adding more as he loosened.
Dean shook his head of the memory of his friend, he should've been there for him, Dean could've saved him.
"Hmm, didn't know John had another son?" Deans face flushed, but looking up he saw he had walked into the wrong office as well. "I should probably leave, John will get mad.." With that said Dean quickly left, this time going into the right office.
It wasn’t when Castiel was driving back one afternoon that something felt different returning home, wasn’t parked in the usual spot waiting for him.
"Sam, of course I miss him, but missing him won't bring him back, but don't worry Sammy." Dean gave Sam a smile as they shut the trunk of the car, before getting in and driving off.
Jensen just nodded looking down. "I-I didn't mean to, Chris pinned me down and I saw Misha being held by his friends and I just..." Jensen held his head in his hands, leaning into Dean when he felt his arms around him.
But he every time he thought there was something strange happening, it always turned out that it was just kids messing around or the person had just died.
Dean had noticed the stranger - Castiel - had blue eyes, but Dean didn't get to look long before the alpha left the car, but he was at Deans side within seconds picking him up to take him inside the house.
The baby was male to Johns sigh of relief holding his son in his arms sitting next to his wife allowing the small being in his arms to smell the scent of his father and mother for the first time. They announced the baby as Dean Winchester, the whole town was excited to hear the child was healthy as well as the Queen. Dean grew spending most of the time running across the halls giggling as he always caused trouble for the many servants in the castle, taking an interest in Ellen instantly as she would bath, teach him to read and write as well as be the one to shout at him while he ran through the halls demanding Dean to put his little weapon away.
John stepping closer to Dean. "What have you been telling him you useless bitch!?" John went to grab Dean who had frozen on the spot, but moved his hands to cover his face.
"Might wanna watch, also may wanna back your car up a little," Jack ordered Dean while pointing to the ball of light that was heading straight for the car. Dean hurried to turn the car on just before the light exploded onto the ground. "It has wings." Sam whispered into the dark.
"Ok, fine he asked me if I would mind fucking or being fucked, and I could pick a guy out... so.. uhh.." Dean looking at the floor as they headed out the door towards where their cars parked at. "Aww, you were thinking about getting pounded from behind!"
"Dean, what do you want?" Shay demanded, making Dean whine. "Let me fuck you." Dean rolled his hips towards Shay who pinned them down, tilting his head. "Fuck me?" Shay looked towards Castiel, who had taken a seat behind Deans head, back at Dean. "Yes, we need to switch around, if you don't mind." Dean made a move to sit up causing the confused angel move off the couch so they could switch.
Castiel had seen the old man Crowley snooping around the place, he was looking for more men to accept his deal, Castiel had accepted the deal but once Crowley mentioned Castiels name other men turned their noses away. When Castiels back was turned for more then ten minutes getting another glass Crowley had strutted back to the seat next to him.
"Oh nothing, want to pretend this never happened?" Dean teased but expected Connor to swat at him. "Not funny! let me hit you!" Connor ended up being cuddled up to Dean, he could feel his hand on his hip. Wiggling backwards testing to see what Dean would do, nothing at first until he got closer the grip on his hip got tighter. "This isn't something we should be doing boy," Dean whispered into Connors' ear. "I don't care, I want you Dad, please?" Connor looked over his shoulder seeing Deans eyes darken pulling Connors hips closer to him.
"That's the fastest you have ever been, what's on your mind?" Dean blushes as she passed Dean his boxers and shirt as they walked back to the small room, where their bags were.
"Wow... Seriously.." Arrow sighed dragging his feet hearing the two men chuckling. "What? Enjoy watching a teenage boy?" Arrow glared at the two who glared right back. "Well, apparently this teenage boy told a friend of ours about a ghost problem?" Arrow looked at the man tilting his head slightly.
Sam gasped falling back on Gabriel's chest closing his eyes, after hearing his brother groan as he released over Castiel's hand.
"So good my Sweet Omega." Castiel mumbled bottoming out listening to every whine, whimper and moan coming from the boy under him. "P-Please Daddy.." Dean didn't quite know what he was pleading for, but whatever it was Castiel seemed to know since he set a brutal pace.
Shay groaned as Castiel touched his wings. "Sorry, but how do you fix this?" Castiel gave Shay a look. "I heal it just takes a while, I'll be up and ready to go in a few days, Matt won't."
When arriving at the house Castiel still carried the omega who hadn’t said a word to him inside the house setting him down on one of the couches in his living room as he starts getting up to leave the room to give him some space. Only a small voice stops him in his tracks.
Dean woke a few hours after, making himself jump which cause him to wake up looking around he saw he was now in a bedroom, still with the same blanket wrapped around him. Sniffing the air he smelt the familiar smell of bacon so he followed the smell.
"You boys up and re- Please don't tell me you've just finished something that's probably sex-related." Dean said as he looked at the two boys who just glared at him, but Misha thought it was a good idea to kick off the covers revealing them naked. "Okay! I got it! Now get dressed and ready for school!" Dean covered his eyes as he left the room.
"I like it when you call me that." Dean smiled cuddling up to Cas' side falling asleep, oddly feeling safe.
Cas' week was hell, Dean would sway his hips more, open his legs slightly wider, he even started wearing panties!
Dean screamed inside his mind, he knew Guardian Angels answered when their Human was praying, but would his come?
“G-good... Uh-um, I’ll just… yeah.” Dean does a quite awkward nod of his head, but he made quick work of getting himself out of the situation, by walking away with a mumble of the word ‘bye’.
Shit, the dude is hot. Deans mind went wild trying to tear his gaze away from the bluest eyes he had ever seen, closing his mouth and shaking his head to stop his thoughts.
"Ugh! Several hunts and still nothing from you!" Dean exclaimed from the stairs, Shay had been silent around Dean for the last eight months, Dean was beginning to get frustrated. With only a grunt from Shay before him and his wings disappeared around the corner. "What the fuck, Cas thought you talked to him!?" Dean dropped himself in a chair with a sigh. "I did, and he's still upset over the wing incident."
Humming to himself as he stripped off waiting for the water to get warm, before stepping under the spray letting out a content sigh as the water hit his body. Washing himself trying to avoid waking up his lower parts as it would be an awkward situation to get his way out of.
He pushed his cock in you slowly, you only showed discomfort on your face for a second before it went back to your neutral expression while you slept. Castiel began moving slowly you only shifted slightly as he did, what you didn’t know was the promise he kept was one slowly breaking within.
“Yes, yes it was Dean.” Castiel just agrees with Dean, just to lift him up startling the Winchester a little until he was put down laying on top of the alpha still with his knot inside his ass.
“Cas was there, Sam. He made it just in time for me to shoot that kid. He tried talking to me, told me how far off the deep end I had gone. I was so blinded by the mark that I didn’t believe him. I thought what I had done was right and that I was no different for doing it, but he was right.”
“I’ll get him,” Dean offered with slight dread, rolling the taco wrapper into a ball as he stood and made his way to Sam’s room, which is where Castiel had been occupying himself during his binge. He tossed the wrapper into the trashcan when he passed it and slowly made his way to the door. He contemplated knocking first, but what could the angel possibly be doing that he would need to knock? Instead he leaned his head against the door, muffled sounds of the television reaching his ear.  He opened the door slowly.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said finally, his voice shaking slightly. His words were hard, as if they struggled to come out, not because he didn’t mean it but because he felt guilty and ashamed for what he had said.
“Yeah, right before all the light of day is gone, but after the colors of the sunset have settled. Sammy and I, when we were younger we used to watch the sunset a lot and his favorite part was of course the colors, but I always liked the calmness that came with that dark blue.”
“Humor me, please,” Dean pleaded more than he had anticipated, but he was really curious to know now that not only Sam had brought it up but Metatron as well.
“When I had The Mark,” Dean began, finally looking back up at Cas, “I thought I was going to die. I was giving up, I was accepting that I could never escape it. I was already gone, as far as I was concerned. Do you know what kept me going—what motivated me to keep trying?”
“Okay,” Cas agreed, taking his stuff off of the table. The two left the house, which had been located only a few miles away from the street they had been abducted at. By now, the town was eerily quiet and calm in the night. Fresh bodies laid here and there, some infected and others not. It was apocalyptic, but Dean and Cas made their way through it and to the office where Sam was held.
“You should try to rest,” Cas suggested, “Sam is asleep. It’s been a long day. I will try to think of some solutions while you rest.”
Dean instantly knew the owner of the voice, but the sound of it among all the emptiness he was experiencing rattled him sober. He quickly turned, meeting Castiel’s eyes. He stood before him in the same attire he always wore, a look of amazement and subtle fear on his face. Even so, Castiel smiled softly, unable to hide his happiness at the sight of Dean.
“Of course,” Cas answered, lifting himself up into a sitting position next to Dean. He held his head, which was still throbbing. His eyes met Dean’s before darting to the side, realizing that there was a short, round man standing behind Dean with a gun lifted to his head.
“Look,” the man with glasses spoke, “We don’t know what happened here, but I know the look in my son’s eye when he came after me before I was infected—he wasn’t himself. I don’t know if he will get better, but I don’t want him to hurt anyone. This town has suffered enough.”
“You know, Cas, I’m not good at just saying it, like you are, I’m not good with words, I’m not good at speaking my mind or talking about how I feel. That has always been something I have buried because that’s what I was taught. I never got to be a kid, I always had to take care of Sam, and to Dad...well, to Dad, talking about how you felt was a weakness. Being sad was a weakness. Allowing yourself to feel anything other than anger and revenge was a weakness.”
“I think I may have found something on Metatron,” Sam declared the next day over supper, his eyes wide with discovery. Dean sat with his legs propped up on another chair, eating leftover tacos from the night before. He shifted in his seat upon hearing this information, sitting up and leaning over the table to listen to his brother.
“We need to lure them out somehow—use the holy oil,” Sam informed his brother and the angel as they stood in front of the open trunk of the impala.
“Well, you were pretty messed up, Dean,” Cas defended him, “But you still found your way back enough to stop yourself form doing anything worse, and your prolonged guilt over this incident makes you more compassionate than any angel and the majority of mankind.”
“What about the soulless ones? Amara’s been busy,” Dean spoke. “Crowley killed Jenna, it seemed to be the only thing that worked or are you still in to saving all the people?”
“I guess I have,” Cas concluded honestly, “But not until recently have I had a real reason to fight for it. Old me was more sympathetic, now I’m…I can empathize. I’ve seen struggling up close, and I’ve struggled myself. I guess what the other angels don’t realize is once you get close to someone—to humanity—and really care for them, it’s hard not to see things differently, its hard not to want to help them, to not choose them over any of our corrupt siblings.”
Dean was shaking the bitch he went out with was now lying lifeless on the table, he didn't know whether to feel good or sick. "Dean. You did good, don't worry." Castiel crouched in front of him petting his hair. "Not again, please. Daddy?" Dean looked up tears had run down his face, Castiel almost felt sorry for him, but then again he had to pretend he didn't. "I'll clean this up, can I trust you to get that blood off you by yourself?"
10 months in, Connors difficult feelings grew, the more time he spent with Dean the more demanding the feelings were. Sleeping in Deans room most nights didn't help, Hell he shouldn't even be in Deans room he's a seventeen-year-old that doesn't need to be in his dad's bed whenever he has a nightmare. So Connor laid wide awake the first night he decided to sleep in his own bed.
But all Dean wanted right now was a nice shower to get rid of the sticky feeling on his body. When Dean stepped out, wrapping a towel around his waist as he walked out seeing his father. "Ah finally!" Dean didn't get to say a word before his father picked him up and out the door to the car.
Dean was almost in tears when Cas' lips travelled down his back closer, and closer to his dripping hole. A smack on his right ass cheek, a squeal from the boy, and a pleased groan from Cas. "Such a nice little ass," Cas smirked kissing right above the entrance that his cock would destroy, with his little boy whining.
“Dean, what is wrong?” Castiel was reading in bed next to Dean who was tossing and turning in every possible direction. “Nothing is wrong Cas, leave it.” Dean snapped, making Castiel lower his book.
The pressure in Deans jeans was getting worse every time he moved. The movie still continued to play but Dean couldn't pay any attention to what was happening on the TV screen, just what was happening in his pants.
Castiel pushed his top half up making sure he wasn’t crushing the Omega under him who was beaming. “That was fucking awesome!” Dean exclaimed making Cas chuckle at kiss the omega.
The only person he wanted to see for the last time was his best friend, who he had a major crush on.
"Ah, uh, yes! I'm here to ask questions about your missing daughter?" Sam struggled getting his badge from his pocket, but he managed. "Oh! Yes come on in!" Sam was let in by the woman who showed him to the kitchen where he could take Cas from his shirt. "May I ask why you have brought a kitten? I understand the puppy but why a kitten?" The woman asked politely to Sam.
"How? Why do you want me here, isn't there any other omegas?" The alpha chuckles "well there are others, but you smell so much better then any other omega. Now what's your name, I'm Castiel." Dean was starting to feel safe and relaxed around this alpha.
“If you don’t fuck me now, I’ll get someone who will.” Dean gritted out glaring at Cas who smirked, Dean, let out a gasp before fully registering that he had the alphas cock right up his ass, and when he noticed he moaned. “Move... Alpha move.” Dean whined again, happy that Cas listened and moved.
As Dean was just about to go out John stopped him "Dean, when are you going to actually talk to another Alpha? You can't keep swimming around in circles, because you're not going to get anywhere. Be more like Sam." Dean clenched his fists but just nodded at his father, who had an old family friend round. Which Dean used to call him his uncle Bobby, obviously Dean told Bobby what John did to Cas, which didn't do the situation any better as it made John lash out more at Dean. Making Dean feel like the useless Omega he actually was meant to be.
"Fffuck!" Jensen groaned as he fell forward, footsteps came towards him. "Jay!? You alright?" Dean was kneeling in front of him holding his shoulders. "Y-Yeah, just hurts... also am I supposed to be able to throw people off me or at walls?" Jensen looked at Dean who sighed, "did that happen today?"
"Arrow! Two laps before you go in!" Arrow kicked the fake grass, taking off around the edge of the field. Panting as he finished both laps walking inside with the rest of the boys, who thankfully ignored him. Arrow never liked sharing the showers, so he always waited until there was barely anyone, only one or two who had the same idea.
Taking twenty minutes to reach the park seeing Misha standing with his phone. "Hey, Mish!" Jensen walked closer laughing as seeing he made Misha jump. "Jesus Christ, warn me!" Misha chuckled in the cool air.
Dean mouth went dry as he sat up, he didn't think that Cas' voice could go any deeper. as well as noticing that the Angel had taken off his pants and white shirt, leaving the Angel just in white boxers, leaving Dean to see that the Angel will now experience what morning wood was. "Dean? You do know that you're experiencing 'morning wood' too, right now?" Dean looked down at himself noticing that Cas was right.
"Hmm, taste good baby." Castiel moaned diving back in for more, as a hand snaked between Deans legs wrapping around the tiny cock that was leaking just as much as his hole.
"Dean? You going to work today?" Dean looked up at Castiel who was looking at him, shaking his head slowly. "I don't want to, so fuck off," Dean went straight back into his defensive mode, which meant being a cocky little shit. "Dean, work or else!" Castiel gave Dean a look which scared Dean slightly but he brushed it off. Giving Cas the finger, as well as another few curses.
"Sooo... now what, I gonna stay in this room with you, while you brother and the Angel guy are out finishing the case off?" Jesse asked only to get a hum from Dean. "Seriously, I just get a hmm, that's it. Stupid Alphas." he accidentally spat out with a low growl surprising the older man for the second time but he quickly let out his own growl stomping his way to the bed.
Dean shook off his shirts and pants, leaving him in his pink panties, handing the clothes over to Castiel to place so they wouldn't ruin anything, Dean looked over the blade of the knife looking disappointed. "This not sharp?" Castiel and Lucifer both chuckled, being Deans attention to the table with more knives for use.
“Saaam, fuck off!” Dean would whine out rubbing his head against the warmth under his head. “You’ve been napping for over an hour! Get up!” Sam bounced on his brother's stomach, Castiel just watched the brothers carefully knowing that Dean would snap eventually but didn’t know it would happen so sudden.
"Oh yes, I'm fine if you don't mind me asking but what is your job?" Dean was about to speak until he saw somebody he knew walking towards his direction "shit, uh I just star in a few things.."
A few more minutes past, Dean and Castiel finally spilt apart with Dean running after Cas around the room for ten minutes.
"Fine lets find a demon and take its blood then." Dean instantly made a plan in his mind without telling anyone he got into his car, being followed by a confused brother and two confused angels, a King of Hell, Satan, the King of Hells mother, and the arch angel Gabriel.
Sam blinked in surprise, but he watched Dean whither in Castiel's lap. "Caaas!" Dean tried to get away from the hand that was now invading his panties.
Castiel moodily threw is clothed on walking towards the living room, his grumpy look left his face when he saw Dean decorating the tree, with their children, they had picked the tree out with their little girl. "Starting without me?" Cas lent against the doorframe with a soft smile.
"Little boy enjoying himself?" Castiel whispered into Deans ear who nodded and moaned but it wasn't enough for Cas. "Yes, Daddy! So good, your cock is so big, filling my cunt so much!" Dean panted as Cas made out a satisfied noise. "Good, think you can come untouched on my knot?" Castiel didn't care when he got a nod from the Omega under him, speeding up the pace.
Castiel was just as confused as the Demon in front of him, he also broke a rule that Guardian Angels have, he'd touched Dean and almost hurt him. "Whats your name then Angel?" Dean brushed himself off as he got up from the floor. "Castiel." Castiel saw Dean nod slowly moving around him.
"Wait... What!?" Arrow moved his hand to cross them but quickly covered his dick after seeing Castiel make a movement. "Let's talk about this, in the safety of Deans room." Castiel didn't let Arrow make a move to escape as he was pulled to Deans room, this wasn't anything new to Arrow he knew about Dean and Cas occasionally screwing around, thanks to one unfortunate night, but he never thought he'd be sitting in Deans room on the bed naked in front of the hunter and fallen angel.
"I... I thought I could watch you. Y-You did say I could be your assistant. Right?" Dean looked up hoping he was out of trouble, but the look on Castiel face said he wasn't.
"Jensen, Misha and Cas, ya wanna be my Daddies??" Dean got a giddy when Jensen agreed to being his Daddy. "Okay, then," nodding as he waited for the second rule.
"DEAN!!" Cas stormed into Deans room, in the evening throwing him his dirty panties he had left on Cas' pillow.
After a long week of dealing with Castiel’s brothers mostly Lucifer since he dragged Sam and Gabriel around constantly. Castiel was currently sitting on the sofa with Dean, who was peacefully napping while resting his head on Cas’s thigh when Sam came charging into the room jumping on his older brother who wasn’t pleased with him at all.
Arriving at the street where his new apartment was on, the building looked nice on the outside but as soon as Castiel walked into the door the inside was even better!
"Ok, T or D! Dean and Cas!" Dean instantly gave Misha and Jensen a glare. "whats T or D?" Cas was sat confused "it means Truth or Dare, pick one!" Dean snapped at Cas who quietly said Dare which Dean picked as well. "Kiss for five minutes!" Jensen laughed out when Misha finished. "Why do I have a feeling that this turned into a couples T or D?" Dean got a smack on the ass which he totally didn't moan or blush after. "ok, so you do like rough sex!" Jensen tapped Deans ass again making him move off the couch quicker standing in front of Cas. "You sure you wanna do this dare Cas?" Cas pulled Dean in crashing his lips with Deans. "Holy shit..."
You jumped at the feeling of a cool blade ripping open the shirt covering you as your shorts that were also torn away from your body, leaving you very much exposed to the eyes of the two. “Damn, pretty little girl, can I fuck it?” You hear the younger man speak so you look seeing him looking to the older one who silently nods while undoing one strap at a time on your legs as he removed the one layer stopping anything from entering you. You couldn’t help but seem quite intrigued by what they were doing but you also felt disgusted with yourself for wanting to watch what they were doing to your body without your permission.
"I see you've turned him into one of us when he's down here at least." Lucifer watched Dean pick from the many knives before he was satisfied with one to use glancing from his knife to the girl then to Lucifer who just nodded. "He enjoys it, was hard to get him going tho." Castiel smiled as he watched Dean, almost like a proud parent whenever their child does something great.
"Can we make a good memory in this room?" Dean sat on the bed watching the Alpha. "Dean, not here. Come with me, now." Castiels eyes had gotten darker as he turned and walked out the door, Dean followed quickly as Castiel open the master bedroom.
All thoughts went away quickly as the Angel began to do sinful things to his body, kissing his chest, flicking his tongue over his sensitive parts.
"Thanks?" Cas looked confused but he shrugged it off as Dean took him inside the house, as soon as he walked in there was moaning of a female.
Castiel was woken up with a crash from downstairs, rushing out from his bed running into the kitchen seeing Dean standing in the middle and a mess on the floor. "I-I tried to make breakfast for us." Dean stuttered out. "Well, most people make their breakfast on the counter, not in the middle of the floor." Castiel sarcastically added. "Wanna make breakfast together!?" Dean totally didn't start bouncing on the spot when Castiel agreed.
"Get your sweaty ass off," Dean grunted as Arrow crawled up towards him, sitting on his waist. "Why? It annoys you," Arrow laughed as he was pushed off landing on the empty side of the bed, ignored the rush of heat shoot downward. "Alright, Sam sent you on a run now go take a fucking show, you stink!" Dean rolled out his bed pulling on the dead man's robe as everyone liked to call it.
Hope ya enjoyed this chapter, feedback is appreciated.. and letting me know if I did anything wrong.
"I can do so much more," Arrow was about to question what before a mouth covered his cock, making him make the strangest sound to ever come out of him just for Dean to cover his mouth with his own. "Fuck.. wait wait wait!" Arrow pulled away quick Dean tapped Cas' head. "Umm... y-you guys will go easy right?" Arrow looked at them both his nerves got in the way again.
Misha pinned Jensen to the bed as he leaned down to kiss him. "Misha, come on!" Jensen growled to Misha who was using his mouth anywhere other than where he wanted it. "Misha, I swear to G-" Jensen was cut off by his moan when Misha took him into his mouth. "Oh.. fuck me." Jensen rested his hand on Misha's head as he bobbed his head.
"Move or I'll fucking hurt you." Dean spread his wings out trying to act like the alpha, even if he was flowing slick from his ass and his dick hard. "Do you need to be bred? or to breed?" Castiel took one step closer to Dean.
It was a few good hours before there was a small voice in the room, "Daddy, her eyes are closing." Dean poked the girl who was slowly slipping away from them. Lucifer had completely ruined her body with the knife almost treated her like a pig going to the butchers. "It's ok Dean, we can always find another." Castiel patted Deans back gently biting his lip as he looked at the boys little bottom. Standing so he was behind Dean pulling him to his chest.
" Dean was the first to cum over him and Jensen, Sam came undone after seeing Dean coming undone, while Jensen came a few seconds after them both.
"No Alpha. Your chair is really comfy, but I'm sorry Daddy." Dean lowered his head as he was now on the floor. Castiel just stroked Deans hair gently as he watched the omegas eyes shut slowly, and leaning into his touch. "Hmm Daddy, please?" Dean sighed as his Daddys hand removed from his hair.
Jensen and Krissy were both drunk so they both didn't care about using the damn condoms that were somewhere placed in the room. "Jen, come on baby fuck me," Krissy gasped when Jensen lifted his head from in between her legs, just to slam his cock into her.
"Well, sounds pretty badass whatever you did." Shay shivered at Deans touch, his body reacting the same when Dean touched his wings of the first time. "Dean.." Dean only brought himself closer, the warmth of his body caused Shay to lean in. "What is that?" Deans hand went wondering to the base of the wings where Shay realised he was touching his oil glands. "Dean! Do not.. fucking touch tha-ahh!" Shay arched his back panting, as Dean did what he was told not to do.
Dean didn’t realise he was tearing up until it was too late. “I-i wanna s-save you a-as well.” He stuttered just before he let the dam break, hiding his face in the alphas shoulder as he cried.
Until a short man approached the table, Dean instantly got up to head for the bar to get a drink of whiskey, for himself and for Sam.
"She's... Dead, she died. Can I hold him, he's adorable by the way." Dani offered with a smile, Castiel happily handed him over sighing as the small bundle of Hell was taken from him, "thank you, and do you know how she died, or where your friend might've gone?" Castiel asked Dani who was bouncing Dean on her hip, with him giggling.
"Arrow? Do you need to go to the nurse?" The principle was at his side, with Arrow shaking his head. "No, I'm fine. I'm... fine." Arrow whispered. "Arrow, your mother told me to ta-"
It had been a week since Shay lost control, him and Matthew caught up with each other as the Winchesters read up on everything Matthew wrote down for them. "All the other Angels told me you died, but they kicked you out, why?" Matthew asked Shay as they were eating human food to help them heal. "Because they found out I'm not a pure Angel so they got mad and threw a little fit and kicked me out."
Once Shay was clothed he answered every single question Sam had, until Dean had to tell Sam to leave him alone and give him a break. Shay was mostly interested in Castiel and Dean.
"Dean, come here." Castiel put a hand on Deans shoulder guiding him closer to the table as the girl's arm was freed, grabbing a hold of her arm as Lucifer passed the blade over while resting his arms on the table.
Dean looked down at Chase who was right next to him, he saw and felt his hand moving in his boxers, all while he got closer and closer until his head was resting on Dean. Dean was hoping Chase wouldn't open his eyes, but he felt a hand over the covers over his dick. "Chay?" Dean whispered as Chase moved away sitting up with his hands covering his lap, Dean sitting up to face him.
"Are you two fucking yet?" Dean smirked when Jensen's head shot up "No, we aren't fucking and we wont fuck any time soon!" Jensen out up and stormed out of the trailer. "I didn't mean to upset him, I was just doing what you did..." Dean looked at Misha who only nods. "its alright, Dean I know. Wanna go after him?" Misha stood up with Dean, leaving Jared to do what Jared does. "So, you play Cas? Hows that going, cuz Cas needs to get the stick out his ass," Misha chuckles "yeah, Cas is really fun to act, but I wish him and Dean would at least fuck. Well you and Cas to fuck.."
Sam allowed Gabriel to pull him around, walking through the door before Gabriel even let go of Sams' arm. Sam was forcefully pulled into a hug by his brother. "Thank you Castiel and Gabriel." Sam heard Dean whisper into his hair, while Sam held back his tears. "Come on Sammy, we only got a few weeks to catch up!"
"Just sh-shut up and f-fuck me." Chase got out between kisses, getting a groan from Dean as he pushed in deeper, then back out only to slam back into Chase pushing a high pitched moan into Deans' mouth. They seem to be the moans that got Dean moving. "Fuck, oh fuck! you're so tight, baby." Chase could only nod and hold on to Dean. As well as hearing the motel door slam shut, but they barely paid attention to that.
"Alright I'm good.. Umm, you do have your own house don't you?" Dean heard the Alpha chuckle out a quiet 'yes', as they drove off with Dean bouncing his legs up and down out of nervousness.
There were three white couches one facing the wall that had the biggest tv Dean had ever seen. "C-Can I please look around, Daddy?" Dean asked as innocent as he could.
Castiel quickly went to his knees to help the crying omega, “come on.” He’d whisper pulling up the boys pants before carrying him out to his car.
Shay disappearing from the bunker telling Sam he was doing a hunt that wouldn't take long, Sam just let him go alone without a question. So that's why Shay is standing outside in the cold weather watching a few stinky demons. Hiding himself in the shadows Shay watched them talk, it was a pointless conversation until Shay over heard a name he remembered.
"I'm Misha and that's Ryder." Jensen sits down next to Misha as Ryder was sorting out his clothes. "So Misha? How long have you been here for? Not the school." Jensen looked away as he rambled to Misha, who was silently chuckling. "Yeah, yeah laugh at my rambling, bud." Jensen smiled at himself while Misha told him how long he's been living in this town before, even talked when walked back to classes, meeting up at the entrance of the school.
Castiel was being reckless with his killings, Dean stayed out of his way most nights, only being there for his Master to slide into his tight waiting hole, no matter how many times they fucked he was still tight.
"That's ok," Dean let out a shaky breath as he felt like he was going to throw up any second "You're the second person to know, but I don't know why.." Castiel had given Dean a soft look "well, I'm glad you did. If anything is bothering you don't be scared to find me ok?" Dean nods after saying a small thank you.
Reaching the boys changing room, Arrow was thankful nobody was in there. Pointing to the showers as Arrow took a seat on one of the benches in the room, allowing Dean and Sam to investigate.
Castiel only stood back shamelessly palming his semi-hard cock head turning towards the door seeing it slightly open as well as a shadow, moving slightly looking closer he huffed seeing the familiar shape of Dean. "Dean! Come here!" Castiel stood with his arms folded as Lucifer glanced up a blade was halfway down the girl's chest barely cutting her.
Dean gasped at the contact between Cas' hand and his dick, but he arched into it anyway. Cas clearly had one thing in his mind,
.” He purred and pounced on Castiel's chest looking down at him, “can i watch you kill her daddy?” Dean tilts his head at him, faking an innocent little boy look which lets a rumble from Castiel.
"So what's the place you want us to steal from?" Sam asked quietly as Crowley smiled "Ever heard of the train called Comet, the richest train. I'll give you a third of what it's worth."
"W-Wait, you mean the one where I'm your sub? I thought that was just on the break," Dean had a moment to breath when Cas backed up. "Oh, no. I meant the entire time, you know, in college, anywhere. You obey me Dean, anytime, anywhere, got that, boy." Dean shuddered again when he felt Cas press his body against him. "Yes, yes sir..."
It didn't take long to get back on the road again. Sam and Dean were meeting up with a few people who they thought might be able to help, Matthew and Shay were against the idea of going with them but they had to go.
Dean was withering under Shay as he moved lower, his shirt and pants had been removed leaving him with only his boxers that wasn't hiding how aroused he was. "Shay!" Dean gasped as Shays tongue flicked over his nipples making Dean arch up to his mouth. "Dean, what do you want me to do?" Shay looked up his bright crystal blue eyes shining Dean only moved his hips up.
Dean and Sam were waiting in the car while Shay and Cas wondered around the building for a way in. Castiel signalling them to move, they climbed through a window fallen ever so gracefully onto the floor. "So now what, and what the hell is that smell?" Dean covered his nose with his sleeve.
Castiel was strapped to a table, a gag in his mouth, meaning his two older brothers wanted something.  "Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. Its been a too long little brother!" Gabriel cheered in the quiet room.
"Can I have another one, Cas?" Dean looked at Cas, who just smiled. pressing his lips to Dean, just as gently as the first one, but it lasted longer then the first. "Cas, you better keep kissing me or you're gonna have a horny little shit, all night!" Cas pulled back just as Dean saw him roll his eyes.
"All three, please Daddy, all three!" Dean whined his body wasn't use to this treatment before, but it got him what he wanted. Castiel leaned forward his clothes thrown on the floor his naked chest on Deans back making the boy under him submit. "Daddy, please!"
Jensen groaned out in pain as he took the last hits from Chris in his sides. Chris grabbing hold of the front of Jensens shirt bring Jensen closer.
"Where's my brother?" Sam was trying to sound confident but he failed as Castiel crowded him. "Well I would show you, but you won't follow me so we have two ways of doing this so you get to see Dean. The easy way is to calmly follow me to the parking lot and get in my car like a good boy, or the hard way where I forcefully gag you and drag you there against your will. So Sam, what shall it be the easy way or the slightly hard way?" Castiel threatened Sam still standing quite close, so he could grab the boy if he did attempt to run from him.
Dean didn't mean to start crying in front of the older man. "I'm sorry, Si - er - Daddy?" Dean wasn't used to calling another person daddy, but the word seems to please his teacher, making Dean feel fuzzy. "You're going to have to get used to that, but for now put these on pretty boy." Dean blushes at the words leaving his Daddy's mouth. "But Daddy, these are for girls right?" Dean lifted up a pair of pink lace panties from the clothes in his hands.
"Let the boy do it, gonna be teaching it to him anyway ain't ya?" Sam and Dean thought for a moment they got everything out the demon, he was just any other demon ruining everything, looking at Cas who only shrugged then at Connor who was standing beside Dean. "You sure?" Dean asked holding the knife in his hand. "You'll be teaching me how to hunt monsters right? Let me kill this one." Dean passed over the knife to Connor who stood with it confused at first, only took Dean to nudge him forward towards the demon smirking at him.
"Well, can stay in there if it makes you more comfortable, I've seen you sleep in my bed more then yours when you go to nap." Dean patted Connors shoulder.
Dean was pretty sure he was dying, breathing picked up when he felt Cas move from his mouth downward, he let out a small moan and giggle when he felt the alpha kiss his belly which the alpha decides to keep doing. “Caaas, come on!” he’d try to roll his hips but was stopped by the grip the alpha used.
Gabriel released first, followed by Sam then Lucifer who pulled out turning Sam around for Gabriel to eat him out causing small little hics and whines from Sam but the look on his face was pure bliss.
"I'm not dressed, and where are we going?" Dean was looking out the window watching everything pass by. "I'm going to work, and you don't need clothes, trust me." Dean fell back on the seat making himself smaller.
"Whatever, at least I'm open about shit." Chase didn't dare to look at Dean, but he ended up making eye contact with him anyway. Sam was the one who stepped in getting Dean before he attacked Chase.
"Well that's Dean, and that's Castiel. They're dogs, Gabriel did this." Sam spoke as Dean jumped off the bed seeing the familiar face of Bobby. "Oh great, he's a bitch. Castiel and him had sex yet? Or they still running around chasing their tails?" Dean growled at both Sam and Bobby.
, we'll fuck your little virgin hole." Jensen moved his hand faster over Sam, making the boy squirm on the sheets while Dean was frantically thrusting him and Jensens cocks together.
So Jesse thought it was a smart idea to wonder around in the dark, he knew he nailed his shifting into a wolf down when he needed to run away from something, but he didn't actually know what the hell he was doing, all this just to see what the two Alpha brothers were talking about.
"I can't believe you're making me do this to make guys jealous," Jay whispered into Arrows ear, before kissing his jawline down to his neck. "Yeah, well they teased and ignored me for two weeks so I want payback, now take me somewhere so I can wreck your ass," Arrow slumped against the wall, as Jay backed up holding his hand dragging him to his car.
Castiel always kept the underwear of his victims, male or female, he kept them away in his bedroom in a box. Walking up the stairs from his basement to his small kitchen, opening the fridge getting out some leftover pizza from last night. Taking a seat in his living room after heating up his pizza the panties still in his right hand, while thinking of his next target.
"Well hey Arrow, and girl?" Dean eyed the two seeing blush rise of Arrows face. "Oh, we aren't a thing! Aero into dick." Arrow made an odd noise. "Wait no! What makes you say that?"
"Well, fuck." Chase laughed out, as Dean came out of the bathroom with something to clean themselves up. "You think we scarred Sam?" Chase heard Dean chuckle, "I'm thinking he might not look at us tomorrow." Dean replies getting back into bed, as Chase hummed, eyes getting heavy. "Sleep, I'll still be here tomorrow," Dean whispered. "Thanks. Goodnight Dean." Chase places his head on Deans chest as Dean wraps an arm around him, falling asleep together.
“Good, this will never end with us both here,” Castiel drags the boy up to meet his lips it's the most gentle he’s ever been with him, he also really enjoyed it.
"L-Lucifer? As in Satan?" Chase coughed out. "Also can I know your names or do I just have to make up names in my head for you?" Chase added. "Yes, Lucifer as in Satan. And that's Sam and Dean, and that Castiel, he's in and out so don't worry about him. You'll just be going on cases with Sam and Dean." Bobby pointed out. "Fine, when will that happen?"
The last ten minutes Dean, decided to act up again but Cas gave up, just to wait until the class was over to deal with Dean. "Okay, See all you tomorrow!"
Castiel shifted them both so Dean was tucked into his side. They both slept peacefully, well as peacefully as a killer and a teenager could get.
done "Yah, cheers Cas can we do that more often?" Dean heard Cas laugh as he agreed to it, making Dean light up more.
Basically someone gave me five words and I picked one word out of those five to write about, so yeah.
"What? What are you doing?" Dean glances at the Angel the first thing standing out are his eyes, the cold icy stare he's getting is uncomfortable. "I'm your Guardian Angel." The Angel stands taller but he's only a inch shorter then Dean.
Dean felt like he was in heaven, being filled with Cas' cock, for a minute he forgot about the camera in the room.
Cas placed Dean on his changing table, lifting Deans legs up as he undid the diaper. Dean had in fact wet the diaper, it didn't take long for Dean to get used to wearing a diaper, or relieving himself in one. Cas quickly changed Dean pulling up his tiger onesie, doing up the buttons. Placing Dean back on the floor who went back to playing with his toy truck and cars. Leaving Cas to work for another peaceful hour.
They rode up the gravel pathway, over to the stable. Ellen or Ash must have seen them coming, since Jo was waiting for them to help with their horses.
Which is what he was doing now, laying outside on the front porch he didn't want to wonder too far as there was something up in the street he was living at. As last night Jesse was woken with a ear piercing scream, only for a young female to show up dead. Obviously Jesse didn't know the whole story but apparently it was bad.
Sam, Castiel and Dean were all chilling out inside the bunker, there wasn't that much to do as the big threats to the world had calmed down for a while. A few monsters still roamed the earth, the brothers went out doing a few quick cases just to keep them on their feet. "So whats going on in the world today?" Dean threw a book on the table he had his feet resting on.
“Yeah, Cas, Castiel's a mouthful,” Dean winked at the alpha who shook his head at him again. “But Cas seems to fit,” Dean couldn’t help but start giggling at himself again and close his eyes as he felt Cas’s fingers through his hair, almost petting him like a cat.
“Dean? What are you doing?” Castiel crouched down to his level, placing a hand on his sweaty forehead, getting a hand towel to wipe the remainder of what left Deans mouth a moment before. “I-I had a bad dream, the-then I-I got angry and threw up…” Dean felt ashamed with himself letting a small simple tear fall free down his pale face. “Well, what were you dreaming about?” Castiel gently picked Dean up holding him close returning them both back to the bedroom.
Krissy looked up at him when he finished, she wasn't sad or angry or maybe she was. "Jen, can we still fuck, I don't mind breaking up."
“Oh, my sweet little boy, making Daddy so very hard.” Castiel slapped the boys rear once again before pulling the panties to the side exposing him even more, the pink flesh fluttered as Castiel blew on it taking a second more to look only to bring his mouth closer, tapping the boys' ass lightly which Dean thankfully understood spreading his cheeks for Castiel. Both Castiel’s hands quickly went to the boy's chest holding him up once his mouth made contact Dean keeping his noises quiet but Castiel enjoyed every one of the ones that escaped him.
"And what time do you call this?" Dean put a hand on Arrows back. "A good time?" Arrow tested a few rolls of his hips against Dean making him grip his hips, just as the door was opened forcefully, showing Cas. "Uh... heyyy... Cas." Arrow stayed on Dean who huffed in annoyance. "Cas... don't you punish him now or I'll kill you." Dean pushed Arrow off.
“She tastes sweet,” You hear them whisper before you scream when the knife gets inserted into your left side below your ribs, “oooh, fuck Daddy I gave you a good one.” You would’ve looked over at them but the pain was forcing you to keep your eyes shut. You had never felt so much pain before it was only going to get worse when the blade was removed slowly.
"Alright, where were we?" Castiel perched Dean on his hip while looking over the information Sam had gotten the first day he and Dean changed.
Cas' hand shivered. This was Dean a small voice shouted, getting louder at Dean's words. We love him, we can't do this.
Castiel woke the next morning with a sigh and a jolt, sitting upright he smelt the omega next to him, surely he went in the room he places him in last night? Right?
Dean couldn't believe he was deep inside a powerful being, besides Cas. "Shay? You ok?" Dean was stroking Shays wings. "Move, you won't hurt me Dean." Shay somehow managed to get out. "Alright, just don't kill me or anything." Dean joked as he bottomed out, grabbing at a few of Shays feathers making him fall forward.
Sam shook his head "well lets just see what happens, maybe he won't have control over his body very well, so lets see what he does.." Cas nods leaving the room, as Sam used the bathroom to get ready for bed. Hopefully he wont have Dean moaning all night.
Tossing and turning he just couldn't get to sleep, kicking off his bed covers stomping towards the door. Not going to his dad's room Connor went to get a drink hoping that would help him. While walking into the kitchen Connor walked in seeing Dean sat on the floor leaning against the counter on his laptop. "What are you doing?" Connor asked seeing Deans head snap up. "Oh, just looking up some stuff, what are you doing up?" Dean didn't look up from his laptop.
"Well your two little Angels juts bailed boys," Rowena smirked as Sam and Dean just saw two angels run out the door. "Shit. Come on!" Dean ran after the angels who had stopped beside the car. "What the hell happened!?" Sam questioned. "Him, again." Matthew pointed at Shay who groaned on the floor. "Blood." Shay whispered to the floor.
"Well, there was one here, mind showing the other place? Is your head ok?" Sam came by the side of Arrow surprising him slightly. "Wh-What yeah I can show you. And it's just a headache." Arrow pushed himself to his feet being followed by the brothers.
Jimmy moved away from Dean, giggling at him. "What?" Dean looked around seeing that Cas was back home, looking at Dean with a sad expression on his face. "Cas, what happened?"
Dean shrugging walking into the war room to disappear towards the kitchen, leave Jensen and Misha alone. "You gonna tell them or am I gonna tell them?" Misha backed Jensen to the table pressing himself into Jensen. "I'll tell them, probably better if I did it now rather then later." Jensen looked at Misha who was playing with the buttons on his shirt.
It was four hours until Jensen and Misha were being woken up by Sam and Dean making too much noise. Misha groaned as his arms went around Jensen who was making a move to get out the bed. "Misha get off." Jensen slapped Misha's hands away, trying to get away but it didn't work as Misha grabbed his shirt pulling him backwards down to the bed.
"It's okay, Dean, I'm watching over you." Castiel whispered as Dean stared up at the blue eyes that were looking down. Dean lost the fight for staying awake as soon as his eyes closed he was out. Castiel still held him, smiling at the small body in his arms, he liked keeping Dean in his arms because Cas knew he was safe, but he knew after this baby stage Dean will go back to being well, Dean.
Dean began rocking, holding his head while whispering to himself as his thoughts went wild running around in his mind.
Biting his lips and blushing Arrow widened his legs two both men, Dean stepped closer closing them, "No. We're gonna do this properly." He winked at Arrow who pouted, crossing his arms Castiel still had a lustful look causing Arrow to want to lie back and open himself up again.
Misha did as Jensen asked, not knowing how sensitive Jensen was to the touch, Misha gently pushed his finger inside brushing against Jensens prostate once, just to watch Jensen spurt cum from his cock, all over Mishas chest, Misha came at the sight of Jensen throwing his head back, and the feeling of Jensens cum landing on his chest.
Shooting off the bed to the bathroom just as the door opened. "Chase?" Dean called out "What!? Can a guy not piss in peace?" Chase called back that ended up making Dean and Sam laugh. Walking out the bathroom once he thought his boner was less noticeable, sighing as he flopped back down on the bed while Dean just looked at him. "Ya alright?"
Dean ended up just lay there looking at the wall, he still couldn't get the screams from his mind, he had one idea but he didn't know if he would get in trouble. But it would be worth risking it.
"Yes, you have to have him, he's been assigned especially for you Castiel!" Castiel dropped his head and wings, only he had to put with a Demon.
