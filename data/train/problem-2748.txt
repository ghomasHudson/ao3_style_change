“Let me know if it gets too bad, yeah?” he says softly, feeling like his words are disturbing some sort of thick dust that has settled over the room.
“Pregnancy isn’t kind to anyone, but least of all me, it seems. You’re lucky I love you so much.”
It didn’t take more than a few minutes of fucking Sherlock’s tits for John to come, frozen in place as his cock painted Sherlock’s chest and neck with hot ropes of come. He grunted inelegantly as he finished, but stayed put for a little while, watching some of it drip down Sherlock’s throat. “Fuck, that’s hot,” he said, bending double to kiss Sherlock.
“The contractions are coming closer to one another,” John offered, putting the kettle on - it was an automatic response to a visitor in the flat. “About seven minutes apart now, down from twenty. And they’re lasting a little longer almost every time. He seems to be making progress if you’re measuring that way.” Sherlock begrudgingly offered a confirmatory nod to the midwife.
John was testing the hot water when another contraction came on, followed by the unmistakeable sound of spilled water and an abrupt change in Sherlock’s tone. When John rushed out into the hallway he found Sherlock in a deep squat, his back arched and a panicked look in his eyes as a puddle slowly spread on the tile floor. John kissed Sherlock’s sweaty temple and ran to grab a towel, dropping it between Sherlock’s legs. He kneaded Sherlock’s shoulders until Sherlock sagged forward, and then helped him stand and wiped the fluid from his thighs.
“I can feel her head,” the midwife said, her voice muzzy in Sherlock’s ears. “Keep going, you’re just right. Push with the contraction and stop when it stops.”
John did, starting off slow to get the right angle and then moving faster, watching his cock slide in and out of the shallow but terribly hot space between Sherlock’s breasts. The head of his cock appeared and disappeared with every thrust of his hips as his foreskin rolled over it, making the sensation even more intense.
"Your baby's moving, would you like to feel?"
“You’ll have that back before long,” John assured, standing up on his tiptoes to kiss Sherlock’s full lips. “For now, I’m happy to enjoy your body exactly the way it is.”
Sherlock looked up at John and managed a smile. “Thank you,” he said, kissing John’s wrist.
With tears of indignant fury rising behind his eyes, John swung one leg over the calf's neck and pinned him in place. He petted the calf and tried to soothe his pained noises when the hot burner touched his head, burning a copper ring in his white hair as the machine killed the horn bud. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," John murmured, stroking the fighting calf's neck as Sherlock grimaced and switched sides. "It's for your own good, Gladstone, it's okay."
Sherlock shrugged a little. “I think he’ll start to look more like a person in a few weeks. He’s not even a day old yet. Give it time.”
"Do—"
...and breathe. Little by little, he brings their daughter closer to the world, until with a gasp and a sudden fierce flare of pain—
Sherlock-in-the-mirror bit his lip and let out a little whimper, snatching John’s attention back. Something had changed. Sherlock pried an eye open and met John’s gaze, drawing in a hitching breath. “I need to push,” he said, shivering like even the words were turning him on.
Sherlock rises onto all fours, crawls up John's body, and pins him to the mattress at his shoulders. "Why won't you do this?"
He lets Greg Lestrade pull him aside, away from the bulk of well-wishers, and wrap him up in a strong hug. When they break apart, Greg’s eyes are wet.
Sherlock had almost forgotten about their holiday trip until he turned the wall calendar to December and saw the three days he’d blocked off - Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. They had tickets booked for the train ride to and from their rented cottage in Wareham, and a receipt for the rental itself, which they’d booked more than a year in advance.
“Well, I don’t think I’d help anything if I said what we’re both thinking right now, so let me try to reassure you because at least that won’t hurt.” John smiled into Sherlock’s shoulder.
He set John’s re-filled glass down on the table but kept hold of his, standing right next to John. He made eye contact with his partner and then put his hand on his stomach, drawing John’s attention down. “Look how full we are,” he said, rubbing over the top of his stomach where he was the fullest. His t-shirt was tight now, stretching across his middle. He took a drink of his water, feeling the weight of it move into his stomach now that he was standing. He drank half the glass standing in front of John, who was watching Sherlock’s stomach with rapt attention. “I believe that means you need to drink,” Sherlock said, wiping his mouth.
He leant forward and pushed himself up to stand. Using the bed post to steady himself, he stretched as much as he could, the muscles in his back straining to support the weight on his front. He took a few slow, waddling steps toward the en-suite, both hands rubbing the low curve of his belly. He waited until the door was closed to turn on the light. He ran himself a glass of water from the sink and sipped it slowly, trying to figure out what had woken him in the first place. Usually it was the need to pee, but not this time - perhaps something in the flat had made a sound. He used the loo anyway, just in case, and headed out to the kitchen instead of going back to bed. Something told him he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep now.
The world gradually narrowed down to Sherlock’s body, shutting out all the noise and atmosphere around him. All that he knew was the pull, the pain, the ache, and John’s voice and hands on him. He bit out his mate’s name as a fierce contraction dragged him down, and he was barely able to cling onto John’s shoulders. “Got you,” came John’s voice in his ear, and strong arms under his shoulders holding him up.
"I am going to need your help," he ground out, legs shaking as a contraction rippled through his belly. "I need you with me."
The appointment was over soon after that, and Sherlock re-dressed, pulling a pair of elastic waist trousers up over his growing belly. “We’re going to have to think of names, now that we know just who we’ve got in there.” He laid a hand gently on his middle, feeling the baby flutter inside him.
Sherlock slants him a blank look. “Arrangements?”
John smells the smoke before he sees it, seeping from upstairs and dissipating into a fine gray cloud permeating the flat. As soon as it registers, he is springing into action, bounding up the stairs and throwing open the door.
The last month of Sherlock's pregnancy passed slowly, and Sherlock was open with his discomfort. His back ached, his feet hurt after any amount of time standing, any kicks the baby gave were borderline painful. They both waited anxiously for the day Sherlock went into labour.
Tenderly, John took Sherlock by the hips and lifted him. Sherlock tried to help, but his muscles had given up. He held the baby as steady as he could while John manipulated him into something of a controlled collapse, and he held back his noise of pain as John stretched his legs out into place. Tess burbled sleepily against his chest, and he tried to focus on her while John did his work to settle Sherlock into place.
Sherlock let John strip him out of his clothes and help him into the shower, where he stood under the hot water trying not to cry. John dimmed the lights to give Sherlock some sense of privacy and peace. Before long he let out another high wail and reached out for John, dragging him half under the spray of water to cling tight to him. John, mindless of the water, held Sherlock close and murmured soothing things to him, rocking back and forth.
He isn't done yet. He hasn't finished with her yet.
John returned a few minutes later with a pair of gloves and a disposable scalpel - he’d found an emergency medical kit in a kitchen cupboard. “Not well-stocked, but it’ll do. I’ll tie her off with some gauze and then use the scalpel for the cord,” he said, cutting a length of gauze from the roll and tying off her umbilical cord in two places. She started to pink up as soon as the cord was cut, and her cries gradually quieted until she was resting peacefully on Sherlock’s belly, halfway in the still-warm water.
Sherlock rolls onto his back again. He’s looking at the ceiling, not at John, but it’s a start. John’s eyes fall down to the heavily bound swells over his chest, and his own chest throbs in sympathy.
Sherlock was happy. It took a few days of ignoring the emptiness between his hips for him to feel normal again, but by the time Joanna and Cameron arrived that weekend, Sherlock betrayed no sign of his breakdown. She was pregnant, of course she was, just gone ten weeks and wanted to tell you first, and she was glowing. As she and Cameron sat hand-in-hand on the couch, telling John all the details of their obstetrician’s appointment, Sherlock tried not to see himself in her. He did not succeed. She had always been his shadow.
The day before the funeral, Mycroft visits for the first time. Mrs. Hudson lets him up, which is for the best. John's not entirely sure he would have. When he gives it a moment's thought, though, he's relieved to have him there. If anyone can rouse Sherlock from the state he's in, his brother can.
Interrupting John's thoughtful silence, Sherlock tossed a pair of keys at his mate. "Under the sheet, in the shed beside Gladstone's stall. Take the car to town. Fuel it up while you're there. Money in the glovebox."
Sherlock turned with a frankly pissed off expression on his face, glaring at John. "Now is not the time for jokes, John."
He felt John’s hand on him, on the sore, swollen flesh between his legs, pressing down as if to give resistance. He took another breath and pushed, and felt himself spread wide against John’s hand. Pain, white-hot, burned through that flesh, and he stopped pushing even as his womb continued to contract. “It hurts,” he whimpered, his chest jerking with irregular breaths as he looked up, worried, at John.
Sherlock awoke later that night to a strange, almost sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He struggled to sit up and blew out a long breath when he did, pressing both hands to his belly. He closed his eyes and kept his breathing regular, trying to figure out what had woken him up. It wasn’t a practice contraction, or any kind of pain - just a deep, unsettling discomfort in the bowl of his pelvis.
“I’m not much of one for walking, at the moment, but I’ll do my level best,” Sherlock said. The idea of taking a trip was an intriguing one, at least. “Am I to assume you’ve already booked said cottage?”
He heard little feet at the bedroom door and he turned, feeling not unlike a barge fighting the current to move. “Yes?” he asked Cara, who was looking curiously at her mother. She walked forward and held her arms up, and Sherlock shook his head sadly. “I can’t hold you right now,” he said, patting his bump. “She’s in the way.”
"Banding, John, not surgery. No need to fear for your genitals." John let out a breath, chuckling.
Sherlock, too, stopped, hands on his hips and surveying the land. "I never tire of this view."
John doesn’t say.
“God,” he rasped, roaching his back and pushing again. The contractions didn’t seem to stop now, his body clearly eager to see the last of this pregnancy, and before he could contemplate what was happening, the second baby’s body slid from his own and came to rest on the mattress. John moved quickly, scooping the baby up and bringing it to rest halfway on top of their firstborn. Sherlock’s hold fumbled a little but he was able to figure out how to hold both of them at once, cradled against his chest. In the back of his mind he realized he hadn’t come again, but he didn’t think he’d have been able to if he’d tried. His body was too exhausted to manage all of the strain and pleasure again.
"Nah, mate, haven't the cash to cover it." The bartend nodded understandingly and snagged a glass of water for John, setting it down as John tucked back in.
They made it as far as the edge of Paddington Park Gardens before Sherlock got winded and had to sit down. He slumped on the bench, rubbing his belly slowly. Cara jumped in a pile of leaves that had just been raked, and John got up to go catch her before she did any more damage. “So, Tess,” Sherlock said ponderously. “What do you think?”
John almost forgot there were more kittens to come. Sherlock got up from his position and started moving around again, licking his vulva and curling up and straining once more. Within a quarter hour John saw their second kitten’s head crown, followed almost immediately by the rest of its wet body. Like its older sibling, this kitten was stumbling and mewling around the box, bumping into Sherlock’s legs and its older sibling blindly as Sherlock licked it clean and severed the cord.
, they’re amazing.
“There’s going to be no shortage of jokes about ‘moving quickly,’” John agreed. He finished buttoning his shirt and looked at Sherlock in the mirror. “But I think you look as handsome today as you did a year ago. More, even. A bit of a belly looks good on you.”
“Kristin?”
"So, er, what do you do with the wool, then? Collect it?"
Sherlock sighed and put down his fork. "It
John helped pick him up and set him down in a deep squat on the bed. Some of the pressure ebbed, but he couldn’t move out of this position on his own, either. He held onto the headboard for support and tried to concentrate on what he needed to do to bring their daughter forth.
Their third kitten was a boy, and by no means the runt of the litter. Each kitten seemed to weigh just over half a pound, with the boy kitten perhaps a little bigger than his older sisters. All three kittens were nursing from Sherlock, making contented little grunts. Sherlock allowed John to pet and stroke him, appreciating the attention after all his hard work.
That night marked the last night that John spent in the box stall. While he was out tending to the sheep with Victor, Sherlock moved all his things back inside, and although it worried John to have his…mate…doing manual labour while he was pregnant, he was inwardly overjoyed that Sherlock had cared enough to do something so sentimental.
John’s tongue circled the head of his cock and Sherlock cried out, pushing up into John’s mouth. The movement made his stuffed belly cramp and he cried out again, holding his distended belly, so close to coming that he was shaking now. Another long burst of pressure had his fingers scratching over his stomach, sure he’d pop open. John’s fingers dug into his belly, so pained and stuffed and crammed tight that it felt like John was going to pop him like a balloon. Sherlock howled and came, his stomach cramping as John pushed down and emptied the last of the whipped cream and gas into his ballooned body.
her in his hands; he pulled her out and up and laid her on his swollen belly where she’d been only moments before and she opened her mouth wide and sucked in a big breath and cried so loud for them that Sherlock started crying too.
"The name's Sherlock Holmes, and I'll be in my rooms. See you tomorrow, John." And with that, the man was gone.
Sue me for wanting to be sure.”
Six weeks later, Sherlock takes a test. He isn’t sure if it’s relief or terror that knocks his knees out from under him, but John is there to help him back up and hold him and tell him Sherlock he loves him, he loves
“The signal is really poor,” John said, flicking through another channel that was half static. “Cell service is bad, too. It’s still snowing out, I think it must be interfering with the signal.”
Two days after they come home, Sherlock's milk comes in.
It was only another minute until the next contraction came, as strong as the last. He tucked his chin to his chest and grunted, curling his spine and shoving hard. He felt her move, this time, felt her body shifting within him. He stopped when John told him to, before the contraction was quite over, and fought with trembling effort to keep from pushing again.
John plucked at Sherlock’s nipple, earning a little whine and halfhearted jerk of Sherlock’s hips. “Good,” he murmured, kissing the top of Sherlock’s head. “Keep going, then.”
“So is this it, then? Are you two finally going to make me a mum?” he asked his belly, dragging a finger up from his navel as the weak spasm skittered from his back around to the front of his belly, gripping weakly for twenty seconds before ebbing away. “It sure feels like it. Perhaps I should walk around some, see if I can get those pesky contractions to get a bit stronger.” He was considering putting on his shoes and sneaking outside when he felt something dampen the seat of his trousers. He frowned. Not his waters, surely not yet…
Bite by bite, they ate what was left of the mashed potatoes. John had to get up and re-fill both of their water glasses partway through, and getting up was a laborious effort. Sherlock noticed John cupping his middle as he walked to the sink, and was sure he would have had to do the same if he had gotten up.
“Nothing to worry about, darling. You’re doing very well with your puzzle,” he said, redirecting. He took a few slow, swaying steps closer to Soren, looking down at the half-finished puzzle on the carpet. “The missing edge piece is just over there.” He pointed at a piece that had gotten kicked off to Soren’s right.
"How long?" His voice is barely louder than a whisper. John remembers why: the long, awful scream of pain just before Sherlock fell terribly, awfully silent, and the room filled immediately with people.
is so small,
. Sherlock moans around the soft weight of John's cock in his mouth and redoubles his efforts. For a minute, John manages to convince himself it's okay. This is alright. It's just a little hair-pulling, a little cocksucking. But it's plain from the sinewy twist of Sherlock's body that he's interested in more. And John...can't do that for him. He just can't stomach it.
"Er…yeah. Shearing?" John inquired, looking at the fluffy animals.
"I can see why." John spent a few minutes just looking around, watching how the waves of grass changed colour as the wind blew through them, how the landscape seemed to melt with the passing clouds.
One night, after Sherlock has gone to bed, John is watching something—he’s not sure what anymore—on the telly when he hears a quiet knock on the door. He stiffens, knowing it’s Mrs. Hudson. She’d left them alone for a few days, but it was time to talk, John supposed. A tear grows fat on his lower eyelid as he remembers—Mrs. Hudson was going to be the baby’s godmother, her honorary grandmother.
He heard John’s breathy laugh as the roaring in his ears dulled, and reached to pull John against him as his head cleared. “Now you,” he said, grabbing a handful of John’s arse and kneading it as he guided John to rut against the damp crease of his arse. John complied, back rigid and hips rolling, and with a gasp and a familiar shudder, the Alpha came. The warmth of his spend painted Sherlock’s thighs, and he squeezed around the hard length of John’s cock, pulling a few last throbs from the thick organ before John collapsed back against the bed.
“Get in,” John said after a few moments. When Sherlock didn’t reply, John turned around and must have seen the pain writ on his face, because he stood up and gathered Sherlock in his arms. “Too long a day, too little rest and relief,” he murmured, his strong arms wrapping around Sherlock’s shoulders. “In the bath with you, and then sleep.”
John groaned and rubbed his stomach. “Fine, but if I actually burst it’ll be your fault.”
Gladstone got a rather rude gift for his three-month birthday: A tight rubber band.
The hot water did ease his pain, but not enough. He stayed in only long enough for the bubbles to dissipate before he was itching to get out again, to do anything to try and relieve the tightness in his lower back. John dried him and dressed him and led him to the bed. Sherlock got in without complaint, and fell asleep.
"You're very warm. A more effective heater than the one in the stall, anyway," John commented, but Sherlock stiffened in his arms and John drew back.
He waited in the stall, watching John watch the calf. His mate helped it when it lurched to wobbly feet, trying to stand, steadying it and holding it in place, hands on damp hair, as Marjorie encouraged her baby to walk around. He managed to keep quiet, riding crests of increasing pain as his body worked to birth his baby. Even after all this time waiting, Sherlock wasn't sure he was ready.
In the cab, he rests his head against the cool glass of the window and lets the silence envelop him.
Sherlock looked up at John as he bent to plug in the dehorner. "Cattle are
Sherlock’s milk dries out in a few weeks.
That thought scared John too; what would happen if Sherlock's labour didn't go smoothly? If the baby was breech, or if he needed a caesarean? In a pinch, John could do the work, but he would need to get to a hospital as soon as possible afterwards, to make sure everything was okay. But for now, it was nearly Christmastime, and they had a few more months to go before any of the risks became reality.
John picks up his laptop and sits it on the kitchen table. Meanwhile, Mycroft goes to the sofa and kneels down next to his brother.
John moved behind Sherlock and rubbed his thighs and buttocks and lower back, waiting. “I can see you stretching,” he said, Sherlock’s body gone wide in preparation. It took two more hard pushes for him to see the shadow of her head emerging, just centimeters inside his canal but coming down slowly. “I can touch her,” came the words, shaky. “She’s right here.”
Sherlock smiled and let his eyes fall shut, and he was asleep within moments. John and Joanna rocked quietly beside his bed. “Not so terrible, is it?” John murmured, kissing Joanna’s forehead and inhaling the fresh, newborn-baby smell that she had. “No, not too bad at all. I think you’ll do just fine with us, my love. You’ll do just fine.”
“I bet you’ll feel it a lot, the more you drink,” John said, and Sherlock knew what that meant, so he kept drinking.
"What do you mean by that?"
Sherlock opens his eyes and looks down at John.
Sherlock, the poor thing, was growing uncomfortable. As it stretched, his womb started tugging at muscles that really weren’t designed to stretch far distances, and as a result his spine smarted when he spent any amount of time on his feet. At the same time, laying down didn’t bring much relief, because his sheer size pulled at his spine until it was curved past the point of comfort. Looking at his mate, John really wasn’t sure if he had four weeks left in him.
John thinks, and feels suddenly, achingly sad.
John rolled his eyes. “A Holmes child through and through.”
in,” Sherlock said, tossing another shirt to the side in search of one that could cover his bump. “I want to move her around some, see if she decides she can come out already. I
Sherlock put one hand on his aching belly and stood in front of the mirror. Facing the front at first, he could tell how full he was - his stomach was pouting, his pants slung low between the overfull curve of it and barely clinging to his bony hips. The shadow on the underside of his belly was unusually pronounced, thanks to the amount of food John had stuffed him with. As he straightened up - slowly, and with noises of pain and discomfort, he could see the strain his body was under.
a show.”
Sherlock sighed and got in on the driver’s side, snapping his buckle and waiting for John to get in before starting up the car. “We could eat it.”
“A boy,” Sherlock repeated, squeezing Joanna’s shoulder with a hand that was absolutely not shaking. “Well, let’s see him then,” he said, bending down to look at the baby in Joanna’s arms.
“You did really well. No sign of tearing, which is impressive considering how big he is.” Sherlock looked up inquisitively. “Nine pounds, eight ounces. And you got him out in about twenty minutes of pushing, about fifteen hours of labor total. Depending on when you started counting.” John grinned.
Sherlock nodded in agreement and stroked his baby's dark hair as she made small, contented noises against his breast. "I can't say I disagree. But worth it, on both counts."
“That’s pretty much textbook labor, love,” John said, taking Sherlock’s hand and squeezing it. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better, but she’s almost here now. Our little girl.” He took Sherlock’s other hand and laid it on the hard, tight skin of his belly, reminding him what all of this was for.
John laid down, closed his eyes, and went to sleep.
A spike of something hot and happy shot through John's heart at the words 'your baby', and he pushed his chair back and made his way around the table to drop to his knees in front of Sherlock. He pushed the man's shirt up over the swell of his stomach and laid his hands on Sherlock's sides, feeling the baby -
She is dazzling. She is perfect. Sherlock wants to be so much better than he is,
Later, curled around each other in the twilight of pre-sleep, John murmurs, “I love you. Enough for Violet and me both.”
There was no answer, but he hadn’t expected one. He could only hope that the walk would spur something to happen soon. He sat for a little while longer and then hauled himself up to stand. He straightened up and pressed a hand to his lower back to ease a crick, and then felt a sickening swoop of nausea that had him almost doubled over. He was braced against the park bench when a cramp grabbed at his spine and held on tight, leaving him panting. He was still trying to catch his breath when John ran back over. “Sherlock?”
“It’s starting to settle a bit, love,” John remarked as he scraped the plate clean and gave the fork to Sherlock to hold. “How’re you feeling?”
Sherlock squawked. “Even if I
Sherlock’s fingers slid down to touch the area in question, pressing in briefly. “A shoulder,” he said, then found John’s hand and dragged it just right of center. “Her spine, here. Bum up here. Heels up in my ribs,” he grimaced.
He was braced against the wall when a strong contraction came along, and rippled from his lower back clear around his pendulous belly. He could feel his muscles drawing up, his uterus contracting inward to expel the fetus it had housed for more than nine months. Tess’s head, which had rested in his pelvic cradle for more than a week, ground bluntly against his cervix, pushing it open even as his body’s hormones dilated it. His thighs were already quaking with the effort of standing up, reminiscent of the way they’d felt so many weeks ago when he was on top of John.
- had her fists balled up and was wailing loudly. “Hey there, you,” John said, his voice tearful as he reached out to touch her face.
Sherlock nodded. He did - not much room, granted, but he didn’t feel as full as before, without the pressure from his trousers digging into his middle. He let out another burp that had bubbled up and said, “You can keep going.”
Sherlock protested, but John sat him down, and now that their heights were evened out Sherlock could lean heavily on John's shoulder to recover. John held him close, wrapping his arms around the man's shaking body - one around his shoulders, the other around his thickening waist. Sherlock's breathing was heavy and uneven, but it gradually shallowed until his breathing matched John's inhale for inhale. "Better now?" John asked quietly, rocking Sherlock gently back and forth.
After a few moments of stunned silence from John, Sherlock looked up. The ex-soldier had set his coffee cup down heavily on the tabletop and was holding his head in his hands, shoulders heaving with great inhalations of breath. "John?"
Sherlock’s thighs were burning, his round ligament was aching with strain. He knew he’d barely be able to move the next day, but he didn’t want to stop. “Hha, aah, oh - god, ow, John,” he panted, trying to force his legs to move again though they’d all but given up. “Aah, please - just -“ he let out a whimper and gripped the headboard tighter, letting John bounce him on his lap and ignoring the strain on his legs as he let his partner fuck him harder and faster.
According to the sheet their rental host had tacked onto their fridge, there was a Christmas Eve lunch at a cafe in town the next day, and a Christmas cookie tasting at the local town hall. “Everyone invited,” was what the paper said, and after double-checking the town’s website to confirm, John and Sherlock decided they would attend.
There was no relief from his discomfort. What he’d hoped would release some of the strain had only added to it, and now he had no support to keep his back from jarring at any of the subsequent potholes and loose bricks the carriage trundled across. The pain in his back was only growing worse the closer they got to their home on Baker Street. With a frustrated cry he urged the horse to go faster, needing the warmth of their home, the freedom from constricting clothes and his soft mattress for relief from this ache.
"No, nothing. Having trouble with this hoof, is all." Sherlock did manage to slip the chain around and pull it tight, tugging a few times to make sure it was secure. "Okay, John, hold the middle of the chain taut while I try and hook the other hoof. This is where it gets difficult."
Tears gathered again in Sherlock’s eyes. He let them fall on his nightgown, blinking them away to see his daughter in his arms. She wailed, her eyes tight shut and fists waving in protest. She was wet and her head and shoulders were streaked with blood, but her skin was lightening to a healthy pink as her lungs worked to draw in air for the first time. A few wisps of dark hair were messy on her head.
John looked down at him, his eyes bright. Sherlock saw no grey hair, no wrinkles - he saw John, as he’d always seen him, strong and beautiful and full of light. He made a noise of need and dragged John down by the neck, kissing him deeply and desperately. “Please,” he gasped, his heel digging into John’s thigh. “Please, John, I - I need...”
. It’s not like the last time, the splitting-in-two, coming-off-the-bed agony that no drug could so much as make a dent in. The pain is gradual—at first, like strong muscle cramps in his stomach and back—but they grow, in length and in severity.
“Mm.”
"Here, he's done."
The creak of the door wakes John immediately. It’s hardly the first time that Sherlock has crept into their room hours after John has gone to bed. After the first few times, John had stopped reacting, in the interest of more quickly getting back to sleep. This time, though, his stillness has a different quality, as if he’s afraid he’ll spook Sherlock into flight.
“You can touch me from the waist up. Nothing below,” Sherlock said, drawing an imaginary line above his groin and hips going the whole way around. “And I want the mirror at the foot of the bed so we can watch.” If he was going to have a pleasurable birth, he was going to get as much out of it as he could.
Over the top of the screen, John watches Mycroft lean in towards Sherlock, as if listening for something, then hesitate, pull away, and get to his feet. He tugs his jacket into place and sighs deeply.
” Sherlock insisted, “It’s
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "You've no objections to bonding for life with an Omega who has a history of drug abuse, is pregnant with a stranger's child, and doesn't take social cues?"
The sharp shifting must have jarred him more than he thought, as the corset was digging in again. He could almost feel his abdomen straining against the bottom hem of it, the boning clutching at an expanse of flesh that wanted freedom. He tried to pull it back into place, but the attempt only resulted in even more discomfort and more strain on his back.
Sherlock yowled and strained again, then collapsed back against the box. John’s heart went cold. “Are you okay? Is it going to come?” he asked, unsure of what to do. Sherlock twisted, pushed fruitlessly, and let out another yowl before looking to John and nodding toward the yet unborn kitten. John got to his knees immediately and leaned into the box, gripping impossibly fragile rear legs between his thumbs and forefingers. “Push, Sherlock, and I’ll help you.”
"Overexertion. I didn't…eat enough, for lunch. Brought more sandwiches, they're in the satchel. Get…get one for me, please?" Sherlock exhaled, his eyes closed tightly and still breathing hard.
“It’s snowing,” Sherlock said, watching as flurries fell outside the window. “You know, if I weren’t so enormously pregnant, I think I’d like to take a walk in that snow, but as it stands I’m much happier being off my feet and inside where it’s warm.”
John shuts his eyes. He bites his lip. He nods. Anger pulses hot in his chest.
“They don’t look like they hurt as much,” John says. He isn’t sure what he’s supposed to say.
fault. I’m not calling the shots here, she is. But I’m not in labor,” he said definitively. “And I won’t be until we’re safe back in London, even if I have to hold her in by myself.” John made an affirmative noise and put a DVD in the player, abandoning the fading TV signal.
The twenty-first day of April dawned bright and sunny, albeit more than a little damp from the storms the night before. Marjorie's baby calf, Maisie, met John eagerly at the gate for her bottle, and John fed her happily, eager himself to finish chores and go back to the house to spend time with his mate and their newborn baby. Sherlock had decided to name her Mary, as she was his 'little lamb', and John had chuckled and kissed little Mary on the forehead as she snuffled in sleep.
"I want you to believe me on this. I already love your baby, Sherlock, and even though part of me wishes it was mine, another part tells me that it doesn't matter genetically whose DNA combined to make the baby. It's who raises it that matters."
“Why, to fill you up even more, beautiful,” John replied, dropping a kiss to that taut skin before rising and moving to the fridge. His eyes flickered back to Sherlock as if evaluating his capacity, and he pulled out a covered dish. “I’m going to put this in the oven for you, and in the meantime, I’ll give you a little something to drink,” he said, putting the pan in the oven to heat up. A few minutes later, he returned to Sherlock with a tall glass and a straw. “Dessert,” he pronounced, popping the straw in and handing it to Sherlock. “Then some lasagna for you; you know it’s always better re-heated.”
“Nothing!” Sherlock said quickly. “Nothing, it’s just that I don’t much like the idea of being stranded with no cell signal in an unfamiliar place
The urgency in Sherlock’s voice chilled John to the bone, and he ran to the hospital entrance and grabbed a wheelchair. He brought it back to Sherlock and put him in it, wondering where in the hell the nurses were just as two of them ran out of the hospital and toward them. Sherlock whined and spread his knees wide, trying to ease the pain in his hips, and squirmed in the chair.
"This is Marjorie and this is Agnes. Names were not my choosing," Sherlock said with a sneer, and pointed to the two brown spotted cows standing happily in the cow stable, chewing their cuds. "They have to be fed and milked twice daily."
Father and son turned as John entered the room, Soren’s duffel on one shoulder and Sherlock’s hospital bag rolling next to him. “Family hug time, is it?” he asked, and crossed the room to gather their family together in a big, tight hug. “That’s it. We’re going to be just fine, my loves. Let’s get daddy to the doctor to have the baby, alright, Soren?” he asked, ruffling Soren’s messy curls. Soren nodded in agreement, smiling widely, and ran to put on his shoes. John gave Sherlock an extra hug and laid a hand on his low belly. “We’re gonna be just fine.”
He'd forgotten to take off the stool.
“And that’s okay,” John soothed, rubbing a little more firmly. Those muscles would give sooner or later, he knew. “You know how much I like to see your tummy. Let it out for me?”
Sherlock picks up a spoon and meditatively stirs his tea. “Whatever you like.”
“I’m pinned,” Sherlock said after a long beat of silence. “Help me up.”
“What’s wrong?” he asks again.
It took a few moments for John to come down and realise that he hadn't knotted. Sherlock, panting beneath him, gave a somewhat disappointed huff as he apparently came to the same realization, and John couldn't help but laugh as he pulled out and sank down next to Sherlock.
"What's that look for?" John quirked a brow.
Sighing and rubbing his sore shoulder, John looked around to survey the room. It was relatively well-lit, borderline crowded and just noisy enough that he couldn't overhear much conversation. Not quite what he'd been expecting from a run-down pub in a such a remote village in the badlands of Scotland, but it was a pleasant surprise.
“Not unbearable. Worst when she stretches. Hasn’t done much of that the past few days, though. I think she’s realized it’s not really getting her anywhere.” He caressed his bump softly, a gentle smile on his lips.
“What’s that?” John asked, curious.
"I have a box stall prepared in the barn. There's electricity, a space heater, a bed and spare blankets. You would've slept there last night, but for the lateness of the hour at which you arrived and the inclement weather." Sherlock paused, looking John up and down. "Is that okay?"
He stood in the shower, water pounding down over his back, and held his stomach with both hands as the baby moved. "I don't want you," he whispered. "Stop moving, for christ's sake, stop moving." He nearly broke down and cried when the foetus kicked him.
“Are you?”
dog came bounding up beside Sherlock.
“Her,” Sherlock agreed, smoothing his hand over his round belly. He didn’t bother masking the smile that curled his lips at the mention of their daughter. “She’s as good a reason as one could hope for to miss out on autopsies and liver samples.”
“A little more, then I’ll feed you the cake,” John said, his voice brooking no argument. Sherlock took another swallow, grimaced against a wave of pain, and rubbed the top of his aching belly as he set down the glass.
A newborn’s cry.
Sherlock’s smile eased the look of concentration from his face and the pace slowed a little, really luxurious now. “I don’t have the figure I used to,” he said, but there was no sense of loss to his words.
The anger in his chest evaporates as Sherlock sways to the side and throws one hand out to catch himself on a table. He knocks into something. Reflexively, he reaches out to catch it, and looks at what it was.
“I’m sorry,” John breathes, and stops himself from reaching out to take Sherlock’s free hand. “Is this why you left?”
IN LABOR
somehow. He shifted experimentally on the sofa, back and forth a little, and he was surprised when a frisson of heat sparked up his spine and pulled a moan from his throat.
Late pregnancy was not particularly kind to Sherlock. The maternity corset he wore was on the last of its laces, as it were, and barely fit well enough to provide the support he needed. Even with it on, he looked and felt enormous.
But instead, Sherlock rolls back over onto his side again. He doesn’t say anything, but John knows that his invitation into Sherlock’s space has been withdrawn. Stinging, he gets up and goes.
He padded quietly to the en suite, leaving the light turned off and feeling his way to the toilet. He sank down onto the porcelain seat with a quiet groan, leaning forward as much as he could given the bulk of his middle. With one hand he rubbed at the folded skin where his belly rested on his thigh. He could feel how the weight of her inside him had shifted - he felt fuller now, somehow. Slower. More ready.
Fact: John was inside, probably thinking that he'd just lost his job.
---------
Sherlock grinned. “John…I think…it’s time.”
“Happy Christmas,” he replied, his hands warm on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I think it’s stopped snowing, so hopefully the plows will be out soon and we can go into town.”
They laid there, John on top of Sherlock, Sherlock’s emission cooling between them and John’s knot tugging
John shushed him gently and finally gave him what he was looking for, taking Sherlock’s cock in his hand and stroking it long and firm and slow. His first stroke drew a long moan from Sherlock’s throat and he went limp in the bed, staring up at the ceiling, chest heaving. John felt his full-body shudder when he bent down and took the head of Sherlock’s cock in his mouth, still stroking his shaft while sucking at the head of it. It didn’t take long for Sherlock to shiver from head to toe and spill into John’s mouth, sighing his name as his cock pulsed in John’s hand.
John smiled. "Oh yeah? What is it, then?"
“A daughter,” Sherlock breathed, his chest heaving and arms shaking. “I’ve borne us a
Sherlock took John’s hand in his own and slid it under his shirt, pressing his palm against his firm, warm skin. “You’re full of shit,” he said lovingly. “But I appreciate you trying to calm me down. It’s not working, but I appreciate it anyway.”
Now, John sits in the rocking chair, where he should be holding his baby as she falls asleep, and goes through the memory box one piece at a time. He touches his fingertips to the stamped image of her tiny toes and remembers how soft her skin was. He doesn’t dare open the little bag holding the lock of hair, because it’s still in the shape of one perfectly formed curl and he doesn’t want to break it apart. He looks at the photographs they took of her face and marvels at how she looks as if she were just sleeping. She felt like it, too, still warm from Sherlock’s body, although that warmth ebbed away so fast. John remembers trying to hold her closer, to give her what little life and heat he could for what little time they had.
John chokes back a sob, resists the urge to slap Sherlock, to grab his shoulders and shake him until he’s got sense again, rises clumsily to his feet and leaves the bathroom, unable to hold back the hot tears that run down his cheeks.
John leant down and kissed Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock could feel the heat of John’s happy tears radiating from his cheeks, and he squeezed John’s hand tight. “That’s our daughter in there,” he said, glancing up at the screen and then down at Sherlock’s rounded middle.
“About twenty minutes between,” Sherlock said, and winced at John’s sigh.
John picked up the worn T framed stool, and after a few attempts managed to balance on it and clumsily positioned himself to Marjorie's right. "So there, girl. Go easy on me, okay? It's my first time." John chuckled and fumbled for one long teat, trying not to manhandle it.
“I know,” Sherlock said morosely. “Smaller meals, more often. I’m going to have to change soon.”
That night, with Cara in bed sound asleep, Sherlock purred and rocked slowly on John’s lap. John’s hands were on his hips to keep him steady, letting Sherlock set the pace. The younger man was half out of breath as he moved up and down, baby’s bulk making their coupling more taxing than usual.
worry,” he said, slightly cross.
"I know," John replied, equally as deliberately. "I'm well aware, Sherlock."
Sherlock took John’s hand and laid it over his stomach, mostly flat now, decades after he’d borne their daughter. Some of his stretch marks were dark around his navel - those would never fully fade, he knew. Reminders, always, of Joanna and the time he’d carried her. Reminders of the one they’d lost. This body, over half a century old, marked from bullets and knives and fists and, in the most tender way, from creating new life. John’s fingers curled around Sherlock’s there, in the space between his hips, and Sherlock didn’t feel empty at all.
"it's fine," John replied defensively, hand subconsciously grasping his upper arm on his injured side. "Look, I don't know how you know all this, but I'll leave if you're not going to give me the job, it's not that far back to the village-"
There was a knock at the door and the sound of a tray being sat down. “Yoo-hoo,” Mrs. Hudson called. “Boys, I brought some leftovers from Christmas dinner. Help yourselves,” she said, and then retreated down the stairs.
He didn't even realise John had left to do chores until an urgent tapping on his shoulder rousted him. "Uh, Sherlock? I think Marjorie's in labour, um, I don't know what to do."
They set up a nursery in John’s old bedroom. Sherlock sits on the floor, belly prominent on his middle, and watches John set up twin bassinets. They don’t know yet how many there are - something about Sherlock’s condition defies diagnosis with human technology - but they know there are at least two, maybe three. They can’t estimate by his size, either, because they don’t know whether the kittens are more like Sherlock or more like John, or are entirely serval as Sherlock was when he was born. It’s hard to predict anything. Regardless, they’ll be able to double up in bassinets for a short time if they need to.
"Hey Sherlock, where am I sleeping? The couch again?" Sherlock stopped and turned around, silhouetted a little by the setting sun.
"One can never be too wary." Chop, chop, chop. "Don't take offence, John. I'm merely being cautious. You weren't what I was expecting when I placed the ad." At John's look of confusion, Sherlock elaborated. "I was nearly certain that some local half-arsed teenager would show up and do the bare minimum to get by, and demand breaks and recompense for work he didn't do. Forgive me if I'm a cynic. I simply never choose to believe that everyone is what they seem on first glance." Chop, chop, chop. "Would you like scallions in your soup?"
Warm tears wetted John’s hair, and he felt the rumbling of Sherlock’s chest before he heard his voice, that voice he’d missed almost more than the man himself. “I missed you too,” Sherlock replied, and John’s sobs grew stronger. “Alice turned today, just for a few minutes. She seemed confused to be a human, and turned back as soon as she could figure out how. She looked just like you, John. Just like you.”
on the sofa. The only time he’s not on the sofa is when he’s in the shower. The pipes aren’t running, and the flat isn’t humid. Where else could he be.?
He had a few more bites of cake left, and a quarter glass of milk. He was breathing so shallowly that he was almost lightheaded, and his stomach looked like it had become a being of its own, so round and full that it didn’t seem like it could be part of him.
Sherlock does not answer for a long while.
“It hurts,” Sherlock whispers hoarsely. “I had her, she was here, she was with me, and she's gone, and it's so empty. You can't—you can't imagine how much it hurts."
are limited, but the options are still numerous,” John countered, helping Sherlock out of his trousers and pants before stripping off his own. “I could blow you, I could straddle you and you could blow
He combs his fingers through those dark curls and really
The chickens were squawking when John came round the corner, and he could see Sherlock standing in the center of the small flock and tossing kernels of corn out onto the ground. "These are simple to care for; I'll do them for awhile longer. Just throwing feed at them once a day suffices. Come here, I'll show you how to gather eggs."
The smell of burning flesh and the sound of Gladstone's agonised bellows followed him around all day.
With John’s help he moved to lie on his side, and John moved in kind to lie behind him. Their daughter was pulled to Sherlock’s chest, Sherlock lending her his warmth and taking comfort from the closeness of their firstborn. It took only a few minutes for strong contractions to come again, and though this time the pleasure was more muted, it was still there.
Fondness bubbles up and demands to be acted upon. Sherlock rolls over and kisses John, and kisses him, and kisses him.
“Just so,” Maggie said, patting Sherlock’s thigh. “Shoulders next, and she’ll be born. You’ll have your baby. Give us another good push, Sherlock, I know you have it in you.”
“Reuben?” Soren asked, and Sherlock nodded. “Reuben. Little brother. Can I get up and see him?” he asked, and at Sherlock’s nod the little boy was already scrambling up onto the mattress. Oh…oh, man,” he breathed, looking down at the baby, who was now awake. “Daddy, he’s really little.”
John quirked an eyebrow and shrugged again. "I said I didn't see any reason to argue, didn't I? It doesn't bother me as much as you seem to want it to, Sherlock. Are you sure you're not the one creating the problems here?"
"Don't - get pis, pissy, John, it was a gr-great joke. I d-did get you something, just…" Sherlock dissolved into giggles and John chucked a throw pillow at him. Sherlock deflected and slid down on the couch, his shirt riding up over his stomach as he chuckled.
John nodded. "Fine. Mind if I shower first?"
The room was dimly-lit and quiet when Sherlock and John walked in. They had gotten the call a few hours ago, but the hospital was several hours’ drive from their home in Sussex, and by the time they’d arrived, all the excitement and fuss was over.
“Yes, I magically grew a second baby. Surprise,” Sherlock said drily.
No, definitely not.
“Leah.”
He throws himself forward, backs Sherlock against the wall, grabs his wrist tightly, and drags it downward. Sherlock snarls and resists, but John is stronger just now. He presses Sherlock's hand against his stomach, over where their baby grew. Sherlock turns his head away, the muscles in his jaw flexing.
Now John opens his eyes. “Pardon?”
John was right, of course. Sherlock started to feel the pressure of the gas building after a few more swallows, tight at the top of his stomach. Had he been sitting up, he would have responded to it naturally by letting it out, but lying down kept it trapped there. The pressure of the gas was different than that of a liquid, more urgent, harder somehow. He drank more, a little urgently, wanting to feel the pressure build.
"Male, mid thirties," Sherlock mumbled, and swept across the room to open the door. There stood a short man, dripping wet and chilled to the bone, and
“It’s almost over, love, it’s almost over. You’re almost there.” John kissed his cheek.
"No," he rasps out, then louder: "John!"
“Hot water should be built back up by the time you’re ready to push,” John said, nodding in agreement. “Things will keep moving faster if you’re up walking, though.”
“A daughter,” Sherlock breathed tearfully, clutching John’s hand. “A little girl. We need some estrogen in the flat,” he said, looking up at John. “A daughter, John.”
The baby was moving.
“Just get me indoors and in the bath,” Sherlock said, with no mind for should-haves.
John looked at Sherlock quizzically. "Well," he said slowly, "I don't make a habit of lying, and I've been told I'm a pretty obvious liar, so I guess if you can't tell I'm lying you can assume that I'm telling the truth. Sorry to be an anomaly."
“I think you have enough room,” John said cheerily, pushing the glass of milk back into Sherlock’s hand. “Stand in front of the mirror and drink it.”
"Gonna take you, gonna fuck you, gonna bond and make a ba-" John cut himself off, stopping just before he realised his error, and shook his head. "Gonna make you mine." He positioned himself at Sherlock's entrance, breached the man's hole, and sank in deep.
The heat is like every other, and like no other they’ve ever spent together before. Sherlock has always found himself embarrassingly unable to modulate his emotions in the throes of the fever, though it has never presented too much of a problem before. But this time, it is overwhelming. The longing and the terror swell up until they are almost unbearable. Sherlock is grasping and needy, the lust tangled with something more tender and profound. He clutches at John and says “please,” and John, his John, his wonderful John, gives him what he needs.
The night air was bitterly cold and nipped at Sherlock’s nose and cheeks as their carriage trundled over rough brick roads. It would be an hour and a quarter in the daylight, which meant it would take more like two hours to get home in the cold and snow and dark. Just what Sherlock needed, he thought sourly - a long, cold, rough carriage ride with a poorly-fitting support garment and a due date of yesterday.
It says something about the two of them that "unbelievable," when said by John, in that voice, in this context, does more to bolster Sherlock's spirits than any intravenous drug could.
This man was an enigma if he'd ever met one. A quick learner, eager to please, uncomplaining and untiringly helpful. Something of a rough past, apparently, blatantly readable at times and unflappably impossible to read at others.
John swallowed hard and arched into Sherlock’s hand. “Better put on some comfortable clothes, then. We’ve got...a lot of eating to do.”
Fact: Though Sherlock didn't care for the child's well-being after its birth, he loathed the idea of going through pregnancy and labour to bring a dead baby into the world.
“Right, that. If we’re prepared down to the hair bows, I think we’re about as prepared as we can be.”
But then, there is the hollow, desperate ache to be considered, and the burning, terrible want. Eyes closed, Sherlock wraps his arms around his own body and remembers when it was fruitful, and what it was to be “us” and “we.”
“Sorry we haven’t been by more often,” Sherlock said, genuinely apologetic that he hadn’t been to the lab in some time. He missed it, rather keenly.
It was just beginning to get dark outside when Sherlock squatted clumsily for another contraction. This time, he didn’t make any noise, just breathed harshly and shook hard enough for John to feel. It took a moment for John to figure out what was happening, but he gasped when he realised that Sherlock was pushing. “That’s it,” John said, dropping to his knees next to Sherlock and rubbing his shoulder. “That’s it, she’s coming. She’s on her way.”
"You're welcome, love," John replied, and leaned down to peck a kiss to Sherlock's cheek. "Glad you like it."
Sherlock's pulse was beating wildly beneath his chest, but as he held on, John could feel it start to steady. When it felt like Sherlock was steadier, John led him carefully to the couch.
He just lies very still, breathing shallowly and eyes shut, letting out not so much as a twitch to betray the pain he must be in. He could have fallen asleep again.
“M-my waters,” Sherlock said, shaking through a contraction. He reached out for John for support. Amniotic fluid dripped down onto the pavement between his feet and darkened the fabric of his pajamas. “Hurry, ooh, oh hurry, oh she’s coming now. She’s coming
"Your little baby," John said, nodding and crawling up the bed to sit beside an exhausted Sherlock. "Your little baby girl."
“Oh, trust me, I am well aware. Practically the instant that happened, these started to prickle.” He lifted his shirt the rest of the way to expose two puffy, filling breasts with darkening areolas. They were big enough now that they had a distinctive curve to them, resting just slightly on the top of Sherlock’s bump. “Feels like I’m being electrocuted very, very lovingly.”
John’s brow furrowed and he looked up at Sherlock, sipping at his coffee. “Thanks for that tidbit,” he said. “What, are we expecting a litter?”
what to do, I don't want you up and moving around."
"Congratulations?" John scrubbed more sleep from his eyes and looked up, eyes hazy, over his first cup of coffee.
Marjorie dried up in mid-February, just as Sherlock started to produce milk. His breasts were puffy and tender for a few days, and one evening as they were sat on the sofa, Sherlock nearly dozing off as John stroked his swollen stomach, that he felt his shirt dampen. "John," Sherlock murmured, and sat up on John's lap, palms brushing his chest and coming away wet. "Oh."
He'd find some way to rationalise his feelings. His body's hormonal nature, his mind's unwitting choice. And when he did, John would understand.
“She’s got you as a father. How could she be anything other than amazing?” Sherlock looked up when he felt something hot and damp fall on his shoulder, and saw John trying to conceal a fresh wave of tears. “Oh, John, don’t tell me you’re crying over that.”
“The next one?” John asked, running his hand over the curve of Sherlock’s swollen middle.
John blinks. “Um. No. I’m...fine. Are...are you? Sure, that is.”
“Another little someone to love,” Sherlock said, drawing a breath and letting it out. “I can...be happy for that. Happy for our daughter.” Of course he could be.
“She wants to make sure she doesn’t have to share a day with our anniversary, clearly,” John said, reaching up to rub the bottom of Sherlock’s belly.
Sherlock accepts his second-best pajamas without a word and pulls them on carefully. John catches a glimpse of the angry, stapled wound before Sherlock’s shirt falls over it.
“Bite for bite,” John and Sherlock said in unison.
of snow last night, Sherlock. The car’s half-buried, and the roads were hilly on the way in. I’m nervous to try and drive to town only to get stuck partway there...we’re not in great shape here, but we’d be worse off stranded on the road.”
"I have my ways-"
“You’re going to ruin our trip if you decide to come tomorrow, you know,” Sherlock told her, looking at his reflection in the mirror. “Even I don’t have the constitution to go on holiday the day after giving birth. You’ve waited this long, wait a few more days until we’re back home. Your father has nearly had a stroke worrying about what we’ll do if you come whilst we’re on holiday.” Sherlock, for his part, refused to consider it. They were going to go on holiday, celebrate Christmas, come home and
Was this what he'd expected, when he showed up at Sherlock's door? No, definitely not.
She’s huge and my bladder is not.” He stepped past John and out into the aisle, heading once more for the tiny toilet at the back of the train car. It was a tight squeeze when one wasn’t enormously pregnant, he thought, maneuvering into the little closet and closing the door behind himself. He hated the sigh of relief he let out, having made the same noise not forty minutes ago for the same reason, but felt marginally better once he was finished. They only had another thirty minutes to go before they reached Wareham, and Sherlock hoped that was the last trip he’d need to the loo until they got there.
Sherlock merely grunted and moved toward the sofa, eager to sit down. The carriage ride over had not been easy on him, and his back felt a shambles. John kissed Violet’s cheeks in delayed greeting and, shrugging off his own coat and hat, followed through to the sitting room.
Sherlock looked up, confused, when John burst through the door. "Thought you were going to town?"
The hollow pain in John's chest melts into something more fond. Greg Lestrade, he's realizing, is really a first-class friend. Probably the best friend he's got.
