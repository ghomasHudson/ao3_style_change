You froze, "He's not-" you began, but you knew 'Anthea' wouldn't care and arguing with your kidnapper might not be such a good idea. She wasn't even listening and had already started walking, so you took a deep breath and started following her.
"She'd have to move in with us, obviously. It would be nonsense to drive from her place to ours 3 times a day." Sherlock said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
You looked up from your shirt and saw the person you bumped into. It was a tall man, you estimated in his thirties, with chocolate brown curls and beautiful green eyes. He had the highest cheekbones you had ever seen. He wore a dark grey trench coat, from which he had turned up the collar to look cool, and a blue scarf. He looked mysterious and rather hot.
“Can I come? I do really want to find out what a ‘consulting detective’ is exactly.” You said, hoping you could come. John seemed to like the idea, but Sherlock was doubting.
As you stood on the street, ready to hail a cab, a black car stopped in front of you. A girl in a black dress got out and walked towards you.
"Okay this is... confusing." John said, still a tad shocked. You smiled, that was usually the reaction you got after a deduction. There were also 'wow's , 'fantastic's and 'how??'s. You always took those as compliments, but when you were small, kids sometimes called you a freak, which made you cry. It was both a blessing and a curse to notice everything...
// sorry this was short, but I'm going to write another chapter today. also sorry for not writing in a few months, I was very busy and completely forgot that this existed.... woops//
“Well if you think it’s so important who is to blame, I’m sorry, but it’s no reason to behave like a huge jerk!” you snapped at ‘Sherlock’ about his comment earlier.
"I am willing to offer you a weekly amount of money, if you will keep "working" with Sherlock Holmes and doctor John Watson."
You noticed he had a firm handshake, which proved your conclusion; he served in the army, probably as a doctor. He hadn't been back for very long. You noticed that ‘Sherlock’ sighed as you introduced yourself and gave him an angry stare which he pretended not to notice. He was behaving like a jerk so you decided to give him a piece of your mind.
“My name is John by the way, nice to meet you.” He said, still smiling. He held his hand out for you to shake.
"So I'm guessing the woman he was having an affair with had a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend who wanted our victim out of the way, or the wife found out that he was cheating on her. Either way we need to check if the boyfriend or ex-boyfriend is in the picture and whether he is, or knows, a butcher."You concluded. There was an awkward silence for five seconds.
"Yes, obviously, you'd need your stuff. Toothbrush, clothes, books, whatever you need in life." He said, as if we were really stupid and missing the point (which we were).
"Would you like to help us solve crimes?" Your heart almost exploded of happiness! Finally something interesting and fun in life! Something you were good at. You looked at John for his approval. He was still a bit stunned but pulled himself together and silently nodded at you.
"Hello, I'm Anthea, I need you to come with me." She said. You noticed in the way she said 'Anthea' that it wasn't her real name.
"For what it's worth, I like Greg way better than Graham." You said, giving Sherlock a teasing wink. John had been silently enjoying watching the three of you and you saw that he could nearly contain himself when you winked at Sherlock, because his reaction was priceless. He had rolled his eyes so dramatically and looked like a enormous drama queen. Even Lestrade couldn't keep a straight face.
"Hé." John said, as a reflex. You wondered if Sherlock did this a lot. "Sorry, I thought you were Sherlock." Yep. You were right.
You were worried about the fact that he knew where Sherlock, John and you (soon) lived. 'Anthea' walked back to where the car was parked and you followed. The entire trip to the apartment was silent. When the car stopped you stepped out and mumbled a "Goodbye" to 'Anthea', who, to be honest, you hoped you'd never see again.
John looked at ‘Sherlock’ angrily, making him clear he should apologize. It was funny how the two looked like brothers or just really close friends, which you guessed they were. ‘Sherlock' sighed, and turned to you with an irritated look.
"So, you're telling me... I JUST MET SHERLOCK'S BROTHER??!!" You said, screaming. "I knew I recognized his facial features!" you said. You heard footsteps coming up the stairs and found a frightened Mrs. Hudson on the doorstep.
"Sherlock, you have to stop taking people to crime scenes! Last time that guy puked over the evidence and I'm still blaming you for that." He said. You were fighting the urge to laugh, but his strict face made clear that he was
----------------------Time skip brought to you by Taylor Swift----------------------------------------------------
"I thought you'd never ask." You said, with a smirk on your face. Through all this happiness you hadn't noticed that Lestrade had walked away. You saw him standing a few meters away, talking on the phone. He ended the call and walked towards the three of you.
“Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and yes, I did.” He said, trying to sound cool while saying his name.
You had been growing closer to John and Sherlock every day, and you couldn't imagine life without them. Greg ('Gavin' according to Sherlock) was a bit negative towards you at the beginning, because he thought you'd be as irritating as Sherlock, but that didn't last very long. Your smiles, kindness and happiness had soon changed the detective inspector's view of you. You and Greg had thought of a way to irritate Sherlock: Greg would always text you first when there had been a murder. You'd put your coat on and called Sherlock to come to the scene. This all made the consulting detective very confused and after a few times, he got frustrated. When you arrived at the crime scene, you would share a look with Greg and just burst into laughter, which only made Sherlock more confused than he already was.
“It’s not like I deliberately ruined my own shirt, so I think you should apologize even if you think it’s not 'your fault'.” You said.
"Thank you, that's very nice. You're a good roomie." you said to him, and he had a very proud look on his face. You wanted to sit on the couch but you were greeted by the look of a sleeping detective. You laughed at him, he was laying on his back with one hand dangling of the couch and he looked hilarious. John told you where the plates and cutlery were, so you took them and placed them on the table. You sat down, and John filled your plate with delicious scenting scrambled eggs. They were the best you'd ever eaten and you declared John 'The Cook Of Baker Street™' and you laughed (silently, not wanting to wake Sherlock).
/////hahahaha cliffhanger (sorry) I'm still working on ch 4 and I didn't want to leave you guys waiting for ch 3, so I decided to make a cliffhanger (*evil laugh*) okay bye////
Your thoughts got interrupted by both men getting a text, at the same time. They looked at each other, and smiled. They looked like two little kids who just heard that they would get some candy or whatever.
. You got a little nauseous because of the amount of blood. The body belonged to a man, you estimated in his early thirties, judging by his posture and face. He had been stabbed multiple times in his stomach, with a butcher-knife, which was laying about a meter away from the body. Sherlock walked around the body and weapon for a few times and walked towards you, John and Lestrade.
“Yes, thank you.” You said and hold out your hand for him to shake. “I’m (Y/N), but I’m guessing you already picked that up from my conversation with John.” You said, still waiting for him to shake your hand. He considered for a second, but then shook your hand. He had big hands, which were slightly warm and very soft.
"I'm so sorry Mrs. Hudson, It's just that the boys just told me that I met Sherlock's brother!" you said. You noticed that Sherlock rolled his eyes when you said, 'the boys'.
"Yeah!" You said happily. "I will forgive you for the accident, IF I can come." you said with a devilish grin on your face.
You needed an excuse for coming with them, because you knew it would be a lot more interesting than shopping!
"I was making you breakfast." he said, smiling, you could see that he was proud of being such a great roommate. You smiled, John had grown to be one of your favourite people in the world in the short amount of time that you'd known each other.
John had taught you how to make his delicious scrambled eggs and Sherlock had told you some more deduction tricks. You and the detective had often competed in who could solve the murder the quickest. You'd split up and do the investigating by yourselves, and when one of you knew who did it, they'd send the other a text. Sometimes the two of you solved the case at the same time! It was always a lot of fun and it really helped improving your deductions.
"Why would I be kidding." Sherlock said. He walked towards the street to get a cab and left you and John stunned. You looked at John and he met your stare with a surprised face. A cab stopped and Sherlock got in. You started walking towards the cab but it drove away. In confusion you watched the cab disappear.
After exactly 7.47 minutes of silence the taxi stopped and Sherlock, John and you got out. The cold London air made you shiver. You walked towards the scene and were greeted by a man who didn't look that happy to see you. You estimated he was in his fifties, judging by his eyes, wrinkles and posture. He had short, grey hair and a slightly irritated look on his face.
////Hey guys! I hope you like this. If you have any cool ideas of what could happen to the reader, comment please, cause then I can see them and maybe use them (you'll get credit)////
You thought. Standing next to him was a shorter guy, who looked sweeter and softer, wearing ordinary jeans and a grey-ish sweater. He looked nice.
You arrived at the apartment, where Sherlock had already turned the couch into a comfortable bed. You didn't mind sleeping on the couch, it was so soft and nice. As you dropped your pyjamas on the couch, Sherlock said, "What are you doing?" in an irritated tone.
"Alright, see you in a few minutes." He walked to the cab and you quickly hid the letter in your suitcase.
Your eyes turned back to the coffee-spiller, who was looking at you like you were a 5-year-old child.
Sherlock hailed a cab and the three of you got in. You were staring out of the window when you noticed that Sherlock was looking at you. You could see his reflection in the window, he furrowed his brow and looked at you with a slightly confused look in his eyes. The moment lasted a second, he had noticed you saw him staring and looked away.
You slowly opened your eyes. You felt your hear being supported by a soft pillow. The world was still blurry, but things were slowly becoming sharp again. You tried to sit up, but there was a sharp pain in your head, so you let you head fall back onto the pillow.
Not really surprised, you found yourself standing in an abandoned parking garage. 'Anthea' gave you a blank stare and said, "Follow me, and don't even think about texting your boyfriend again, there's no signal here."
You were in your apartment, packing your suitcase. You were looking forward to seeing 221B Baker Street and living with Sherlock and John. You took your old teddy bear and a picture of your family and stuffed them in the (already full) suitcase. Of course, you couldn't forget your Doctor Who TARDIS necklace so you took that one too. With all your stuff packed, you walked out of your apartment, ready for the next stage of your life.
Credit to one of my best friends, Kim, for the idea that I should make it 92,8% instead of 92%, because it’s Sherlock-ish.
“Fine, but I can't see how taking her to a crime scene would make up for that.” He said, looking slightly confused.
This was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for you. You were already looking forward to it. Sherlock led you to his room and you started unpacking. Afterwards, you jumped into the bed and rested. Everything had been washed, but it still smelled a bit like Sherlock. You decided you weren't really hungry, but very tired, so you went to sleep. It was the most comfortable bed you had ever slept in, and when you woke up, you felt great. You walked into the living room and saw that John was making scrambled eggs. The smell had filled the apartment and you couldn't resist grabbing a piece from the pan.
The short guy punched the ass in his side and said angrily “For god’s sake Sherlock, be nice!” You made a mental note that the weirdo’s name was Sherlock.
“If I were an ordinary, stupid person, I would probably apologize, but this accident is 92,8% your fault, so I will not.” He snapped at you.
"I don't know how you did this, but you were right. We found his lover's phone number on the victims phone and she did have a crazy ex-boyfriend. And guess what, he's a butcher in training." He said. You did it! You were so proud of yourself and you were fighting the urge to hug Lestrade. You looked at John and Sherlock. John had a very proud look on his face,
It was a normal Sunday morning. You were enjoying the day even though you hated Sundays. You were just taking a walk and were about to enter a shop when you looked to your right. And that’s where you went wrong. Because you were walking without looking where you were going, you bumped into someone, who spilled the remains of his morning coffee on your new, white t-shirt. That’s when your good mood disappeared quicker than a bullet from a gun.
You ended up walking for a few minutes (you were too tensed to time it). 'Anthea' took a left and you followed. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw a tall man waiting for you. He was wearing a black suit, which you could see he had tailored specially for today, and a red tie with a pattern. He was very intimidating. 'Anthea' walked towards the stranger and whispered something in his ear, afterwards she continued to walk past him and walked away. You were alone now (not that 'Anthea' was on your side). The man looked like he thought he was the king. He was leaning on a black umbrella with a wooden handle. Some of his facial features seemed familiar, but because of your fright you skipped the thought. He had a pocket watch, of around 65 years old in his vest pocket, you guessed a family treasure. His hair was turning slightly grey, but he'd been using hair-dye to cover it up. You noticed that he cut his nails and had a thin layer of transparent nailpolish on them (you smiled in your head). You also saw that he'd try to remove crumbs of donuts of his suit, but they were still slightly visible. He didn't want people to know, so you guessed he'd been dieting. You looked at his eyes and noticed that he was watching you do your deduction. He was a bit surprised, but hid it well.
"Don't try to be brave, it doesn't suit you." he said, slowly and meanly. You blinked a few times, scared of what this strange man wanted.
Days passed, murders were solved, walls were shot, and you were having the time of your life. Living with Sherlock and John was an adventure every day. You hadn't heard anything from the mysterious 'M', but that would soon change...
John walked into the room and you hid the letter behind your back. You wanted to sort this one out on your own, and you feared that you might bring Sherlock and John into danger if you involved them in this.
You were confused, but then the images of the night before slowly came back to you. The sound, the ally, the man in the suit. Your horror was interrupted by a voice.
“Come on Sherlock, it’ll be fun! And you have to make up for ruining her clothes.” John said, looking up to Sherlock.
I hope you guys enjoy this! English is my second language so I will probably make mistakes, please don’t blame me too much and just let me know. Also, this is my very first fanfiction EVER so don’t be too harsh on me please. ///
"You can sleep in my room until we cleaned 221C, it needs renewal and we don't have an extra room here. It's a small place, you can just use it as a bedroom and live at our place." he explained. You were thrilled, the idea of having an entire apartment
"Someone wants to meet you..." She said a bit threatening. You decided to go with her not to cause any trouble. Also you were curious who this 'someone' was, so you got into the car...
Today, you had gone to the mall to get some more seasonal clothes, when you heard a loud 'BANG'. You looked to the direction of the sound, and your curious side got the better of you. You walked towards where the sound came from, and found a narrower and darker ally. You shivered, scared of what might be hiding in the dark, but you were still very curious. You slowly padded into the alley and continued your little 'adventure'. Following the path though the alley, you turned left, and that was when you saw him. In the middle of the path stood a man. It appeared as if he had been waiting for you, and your heartbeat was rising. The man was wearing a black suit and a black tie with little white marks. He had short, black-brown hair and very intimating eyes, which had an evil shine. He took a step towards you, and you stepped backwards. You now noticed that the white marks on his tie were little skulls. He smiled evilly and your stomach lurched. He took another step towards your direction, and you took one away from him. He just laughed. You were visibly shaking now.
After the bottle, they’re shown proper burping position and the tiny creature drops into a milk-fed slumber on Sherlock’s chest. John pulls out a soft blanket from the bag and tucks it around them.
Sherlock smiled at the thought of biscuits. There had been few opportunities in the circus to satisfy his sweet-tooth. He quickly traded his rumpled shirt for the soft, blue linen one she had given him, wondering if he’d soon be able to change his appearance as easily as pulling on a shirt. “I’ve never been able to manage a glamor, but always wanted to understand how…” His words caught in his throat. Mrs. Hudson’s cheery demeanor had crumpled into a watery frown as she caught sight of his bare torso.
But as he walks back to the main road, the rain soaking into his Haversack, he doesn’t go down to the tube. That magnetic repulsion keeps his feet moving. He walks back to Baker Street. And then, using his key, slips into the entryway of 221B. He pauses, noticing his wet footprints on the hall floor. With a quick look up the stairwell and toward Mrs. Hudson’s door, he quickly crouches and rubs them out with his coat sleeve, then ducks into 221C to wait.
Sherlock resists the urge to stand and push the wayward hair behind her ear, but she’s in serious scientist mode and wouldn’t appreciate the coddling gesture.
The lake holds memories of a time when his violin was not available to soothe John’s nightmares, when a simple luggage omission changed the course of his life.
is on edge. Five halfbloods murdered in less than a month, and no clue as to who is behind it, or when they’ll strike again.”
“Debatable,” John muttered. “Sherlock nearly drowned. That we’re here at all is thanks to William, but you can see the state he’s in. I
“Excellent, good detective work, General.” With a sigh, he made a small gesture to Tobi who sprang up from where she’d been leaning sullenly against a brightly-painted wagon, as far from the Netters as she could professionally be.
“No m’not,” Sherlock leans in too fast to kiss him at the exact same moment as John, their trajectories all wrong.
“Every few days, another one would hit me. I’d be standing on the corner waiting to cross with a bag of shopping. And
Rubbing his hands roughly over his face to focus his attention, he pulls out weathered maps and navigation charts from the chest, each one a key to some moment he saw something in John’s behavior and wondered,
As a pan filled, John was dimly aware that Mrs. Hudson would float it down the hall to clean it in the bath. Occasionally, she renewed Sherlock’s deep sleep or patted at his forehead with a cool flannel. John felt anchored by her calm presence as nurse.
has the best.” His voice grows rough. “Yet still two died that day. Because I insisted, yet again, to reach you against all advisement. The papers reported it as a robbery on your street that ended rather badly.” John’s eyes widen with recollection.
With a swirl of wake Sherlock is back, pulling John above the surface, pulling him close against his chest to rest his chin on his shoulder again and let him float and breathe, giving him warmth. Despite his dire circumstances, John is vividly aware of how tightly they are twined together, though surely it’s just to keep him warm.
, then, if you’re so keen to drag us into it,” John chuckles. “I like Leander. And that one, from the wood elves…”
The ache of his bruises faded from his thoughts as he basked in the warm energy moving through his hands, uniting the fibers. It almost felt like they were happy to be rejoined. The ghost of a smile reached his lips. The bold, yellow-eyed starling hopped closer.
He steps away to fetch John’s light pack, extracting the small, silver camera and thumbing on the power. Standing in the middle of the room, he scrolls quickly through the photos when he feels a light touch on his bare back. John has joined him, standing close and peering over his shoulder.
The panther’s mistress, however, still seemed in doubt. John felt very small as she scrutinized them with a steady, grey-eyed glare, tapping her teeth with a blunt fingernail. “You’re not what I expected at all.”
Sherlock whirls, itching for another, but of course, they’re already done. John is crouching next to Chen and his boyfriend, soothing them, but catches his eye. They grin at each other like Cheshire cats.
Sherlock shoves a scone into his mouth, but finds he hardly has the saliva to chew. He ducks his head and pretends to seriously consider Sherrin’s latest draft of the formula he’d been reviewing before they’d knocked off for tea.
“Mr. Holmes, sir,” Chen says through the window of the dusty, sky-blue Mini, “my sister says you must come by for tea. You
John returned the empty bowl to the tray and helped him settle back onto the cushions. “You’re starting to perk up. Remarkable concoction, isn’t it?”
At first, John tried to be helpful and make some sense of it, but frankly the tracks all look alike to him. They’ve been at this for hours and the thrill of the chase has sputtered out. Sherlock is absorbed and hasn’t said a word to him for ages. The sun’s about to set and he seems no closer to cracking the code. What a wasted day. If he’d thought to grab some gloves on his way out the door, maybe John wouldn’t feel so sour. He wishes he hadn’t realized what day it is. Just makes it worse.
“Yes, yes, fine,” she grumbled, plopping the book into Sherlock’s lap as she walked past, then settled onto the sofa cushions with a groan.
“Where’d you find blankets?” he asks thickly, incredulous. Sherlock is wrapping his dry suit jacket around John’s feet.
John wakes to the insistent insect buzzing of Sherlock’s mobile on the bedside table. It’s early dawn, pale light just beginning to turn the shadows of the bedroom into soft greys and purples.
Angelo appears beside them, beaming with his usual rosy warmth.                “Always so good to see you, my friends, it has been some time, yes? Anything you like, free, free…” His dark eyes flicker to their intertwined hands and he gives Sherlock the tiniest of secret smiles, which Sherlock gratefully returns. “I’ll bring wine, yes?”
“When his successor chose him, he was a brilliant theoretical physicist. His mental acuity was, as you so intimately know, accounting for variables and discerning their interconnectedness, determining the most ideal outcome and following the circuitous path needed achieve the goal.
Tallack’s human eye caught Lestrade’s and he strode toward him with feline grace on his multi-jointed metal legs. He’d been powerfully built even before the alterations and the effect was intimidating, even to Lestrade who had known the man since their early days in the Academy, long before his
“Thank you,” John pants quietly against his shoulder. Then, because he might explode from the fierce emotion, “What took you so bloody long to get here?”
“Sherlock’s given up so much to make this new life of ours work. I’d like to rent out 221C to convert into a lab for him.”
Sherlock grins. “I’ll be right up. Let me stack these papers. I don’t want them drawn on again in the morning.”
“I had no choice, Mycroft. He has snipers on all of them. Once I understood Moriarty was the only variable that could call them off, he… simply removed that possibility.”
He rolled over, hurt. “No. That has never happened to me before. I did not seek it out. I am as surprised as you.” He couldn’t keep the defensiveness out of his voice.
They stroll toward the tree, set in a quiet patch of park with few people around. Sherlock stares at it, awed.
He’d found his way to the Underground. No place in mind, he just needed to go. Anywhere. He’d done that a lot as a student at Bart’s when he was new to London with little money. The rocking of the cars and anonymity of the crowd had eased the strain of uni. He found he studied better on the trains, though the graphic medical texts did raise eyebrows. It had also been a safe way to look at other young men he wasn’t likely to stumble into again at Bart’s – he’d met more than a few that way.
“That Sherlock,” he says, suddenly quiet, “had not spent two years keeping the love of his life from being murdered every time he so much as looked his way.”
“Get some rest, doctor. I’ll be able to fly us again soon…” Sherlock yawned enormously, trailing off, his eyes fluttering closed.
John peered at him closely and prodded him with his finger. “You feel solid. This is bloody strange.”
Sherlock studies John’s right hand resting on the sheet, the one with no IV or wires. And no ring. He scowls. Did the hospital staff remove it? No… he thinks back to the confrontation with Mary at the flat two days ago, plays the memory in his mind.
Seeing it all with Sherlock, John could see how multiple voices could increase the strength of the spell’s vibrations.
John watched her with a small grin. “It smells delicious, but will it really work? Couldn’t I just, you know, carry him out into the garden?”
John scowled, confused. “We studied that in school. That was when they outlawed killing halfbloods.”
“I saw it from below on our walk out!” John gasps. “I don’t remember seeing it on the ridge, though–”
Sherlock has been so focused on the kissing and the slow journey of John’s fingertips that he’s been unaware of the rest of himself. His body has acted of its own accord. His legs grip John’s torso. His hands are tugging up his own soft t-shirt that he dressed John in not ten hours ago, when he was lost to him.
John could hear the crazed snap of the Scutter’s Dome behind them. Sherlock stared at him imploringly, trusting him. John gritted his teeth, holding Sherlock’s eyes in the last moments of their freedom. He was going to fail him
When finally the blast faded away, Sherlock blinked rapidly as the bedraggled form of John melted into a solid, jowly fellow in workman’s trousers and scuffed boots with a tanned, mustachioed face, his hands large and freckled. He was so utterly different that Sherlock burst out laughing again.
Sherrin suddenly clacks the knife down onto the counter. Sherlock looks up startled to find him glaring at him.
The surgeon had led him through an enormous workroom where the hulking skeletons of one-day gyrocopters were being built. They'd gone through three sets of thick quartz-stone doors inlaid with intricate copper wiring, flanked by increasingly-armed, increasingly clockwork guards. Once within, the surgeon had told Lestrade everything he needed to know to support their Queen in her campaign against the Heathen Faerie.
Sherlock’s lips dip to press against the soft pulse at John’s collarbone, then wander along his neck and rough jaw.
Sherlock smiles, closing the door. Before he’s even reached the top of the stairs he’s looked up the school’s night class schedule and determined
at these kinds of exchanges, the mating rituals and proper banter. I panicked when it seemed you might be interested in me.”
John breaks their kiss apart long enough to coat his palm with their saliva, then grips them both in his hands, tugging rhythmically. Sherlock’s fingers dig into his back, keeping him securely planted in his lap while they roll together. Grinning into John’s mouth, a bubble of brilliant laughter suddenly wells up from him, spilling out.
Sherlock gives him a lopsided grin, then, seemingly satisfied with his makeshift cocoon, sits closely behind him, wrapping his long limbs around John for maximum contact. Sherlock drops his chin to John’s shoulder wearily, his voice rumbling in his ear.
Thank you for your immense patience! With school underway, writing, beta'ing and revising are going at a steady – but slow! – clip.
John blinked awake and flinched away from him, sitting up abruptly. Sherlock’s heartbeat pounded in his ears.
The elderly woman stared at them critically. John watched her cautiously, Sherlock slumped against him, barely conscious.
John’s first instinct was to ease the cough, but he hesitated. The Netters would be on the lookout for any pair of men, especially if one was a healer. The courtyard was empty, but could someone be watching through a window?
“Because either I’m about to brutalize you in an alley, or I’m simply offering you a space to be that
It brings them closer together, in a sense. The mark at the top of the paper, circled in red, tells them what they already believed to be the case – they make a great team. The mark is proof that they work well together, which makes them want to continue to work together (even when it's not mandatory – which is saying a lot given that Sherlock has never
"See?" John says as they pack up their things after their final planning session. "I'm not as bad a partner as you expected, am I?"
They work well together, which is bizarre in and of itself. Sherlock does not recall ever working well with anyone, at any point in his life. John is patient and polite, a good listener but also a contributor. He does not openly reject any of Sherlock's ideas, but instead expands on them, adding his own thoughts to develop a better project plan. John's ideas, as it turns out, are actually quite good. John is smarter than he looks, and he is also able to contribute to the development of the project from a different standpoint to Sherlock. Where Sherlock's ideas are based off interest, and a desire to learn how things work or to try things just because he thinks they sound like fun, John's ideas are based off practicality. John can see where the results of a certain experiment might be relevant, for instance, in the field of medical science.
They go down for dinner, because there is no escape (save faking a heart attack, which Sherlock briefly considers but decides against because it might only lead his mother to fuss). They take a seat, help themselves to food, and then the conversation starts.
Sherlock's mother answers all the questions openly, and she does not re-take control of the conversation for the entire duration of dinner. It's only when they are loading their plates into the dishwasher that Sherlock realises that none of his fears had come true.
"Of course not." A beat, and then Sherlock continues, "You sit at the front of the class, and take notes even when this is not a requirement. This shows that you are a dedicated student and that you are determined to achieve good results, at least in this class, if not in all of your classes. You're motivated and ambitious, which is likely related to your desire to become a doctor. Based on the classes you're taking, I presume your intentions are to study medicine. You know that a medicine degree will be costly, both in terms of time and money, and you're not well-off financially. So, your best chance of succeeding involves you getting a scholarship. This is why you are so motivated to get good grades, especially on a project that is worth the majority of your final grade in this class. So, you see, I was never concerned that you would be a bad partner. You are undoubtedly one of the few in the class who would be willing to put in as much time and effort as a project of this complexity would require."
His head feels like it's spinning. In his mind, he's having a conversation with John – albeit a disjointed one.
Sherlock has never been inside John's house before. He's walked home with John a couple of times, because they do not live far from each other, but he has never had the opportunity to step inside. He wishes his eyes weren't so swollen so he could actually take it in properly. He does what he can under the circumstances, looking around as John leads him into the living room. John's house is smaller than Sherlock's. It's quaint, really. They pass the kitchen on the way to the living room, and Sherlock notices an empty bottle of some sort of alcohol sitting in the sink.
Sherlock lowers the book to glare at his brother, and then immediately raises it again. "I have a major project due and my professor insists that I work on it with someone else," he states. "So, naturally, I have been spending a lot of time with my partner in the interest of getting the project done and ensuring it is of a high quality. I'm not sure why mother believes that this is an important enough topic to discuss with you. I'm sure you have far more important things to do, like run the country."
"I wasn't sure," John says after a pause, quietly. "I couldn't get what you said out of my head when we were texting – about the formal. You're really hard to read sometimes, and it sounded like maybe you did actually have feelings for someone. And I wasn't sure that it was me, but I know you, and I know you're not really close to anyone else. You don't strike me as the sort of person who would have feelings for someone you weren't close to. And when I think about the way you treat me, compared to the way you treat everyone else – well, I couldn't know for sure, because you don't really have any other close friends and maybe the way that you treat me is just because we're friends, but sometimes it almost, almost seemed like you were flirting with me. Well, not flirting, exactly, because I can't imagine you flirting with anyone, but there was something. I thought there was something, anyway."
John, however, is not used to hearing such words, even though the words in question are not directed towards him. It does not matter to John that Sherlock does not care what other people say. John cares what other people say about Sherlock, even though Sherlock does not really understand why.
"You're acting as though I need cheering up," Sherlock says. When John looks up at him questioningly, he continues, "It's hardly as though I'm here as some clichéd, heartbroken teenager who didn't get a date to formal. I'm not at formal out of my own choice, and I was not disappointed to be home by myself. This is hardly necessary."
"Still," John says. "I'm not going to be able to get any sleep knowing you're up finishing the project anyway. I don't mind pulling an all-nighter every now and again if I need to."
Sherlock expects that he will need to make a strong argument. He expects his mother to insist that the party was supposed to be for family only. Sherlock expects to need to explain that that is exactly why he wants John to come.
Sherlock cannot bring himself to speak. He cannot bring himself to shift or even to look up at John's face, let alone meet his eyes. He wishes the sofa would swallow him whole. He wishes he could go back in time and not open the door, or to go back further and not say anything while they were texting, or to go back further still and stop himself from ever falling this far.
Sherlock regrets ever bringing up anything even remotely related to sentiment. He regrets ever giving any indication that he might feel this way. He wonders how he thought he could get away with this at all. John can be so marvellously unobservant at times, but of course he would be observant about the one thing that matters.
Sherlock frowns, because this certainly does not seem to be the case. There is a problem, there has to be a problem. Why else would John be behaving like this?
So, Sherlock cannot see what John sees when John looks at girls. He doesn't understand how it must feel for John, what John experiences when he decides that he want to date one of the girls in their class. Sherlock has tried looking at boys, instead, but that's little different. There's a part of Sherlock that might feel a little more drawn to boys than he is to girls, that much is true, but Sherlock can hardly be drawn to the boys at school when their behaviour towards him is so unpleasant to experience.
To his surprise, his mother meets his suggestion with no argument whatsoever. If anything, she seems thrilled with the idea.
He dreams of John feeling the way he feels. He dreams of John telling him as much – sometimes with words, sometimes without. Sometimes he dreams that they are together – he never knows when or how it started, but in the dreams, it feels right. Sometimes he dreams of the way it might feel if John were to kiss him.
Sherlock tips his head to the side, peering up at John through swollen eyes. "Don't you have some sort of moral compass thing that stops you from hurting people?" he asks.
Right. Well, why can't you just do university degrees that would help you get a regular detective job? Surely then you can branch out into "consulting detective". Whatever that is.
"Well, at least you don't call people freaks behind their backs. Look, why don't we just give it a try? I promise I'm not a terrible partner." When Sherlock does not respond, the boy continues, "And you know your options are limited. You have to work with someone, even if you don't want to."
Sherlock hates the look that Mycroft gives him, because he has the strangest idea that Mycroft might know how Sherlock is feeling better than Sherlock himself.
More likely, going to formal will be a waste of my time and result in absolutely no fond memories to look back on. I'd rather stay home and use my time more productively.
"We're going to study upstairs," Sherlock says, and immediately he turns to lead the way, eager to end this conversation before it can properly start.
Everyone else will be at formal. Everyone else will be dancing and kissing and acting like normal people, nothing like Sherlock himself. Sherlock is glad that he's not there.
When they reach the front door, Sherlock turns to face John, who is smiling brightly. John says, "Thank your mum again for me. It was really nice of her to let me stay."
"None at all," Sherlock's mother says. "You two go upstairs and work on your project, and I'll let you know when dinner is ready."
After another cup of coffee, another discussion of whether John's current level of consciousness can be classified as 'awake', and a brief debate about the correct way to use in-text citations, they manage to finish the project. It's about three o'clock in the morning.
"I'm going to make a deduction, and if I'm wrong, we're going to put on another movie and we'll never talk about this again. But if I'm not wrong, then you need to promise me you'll be honest."
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders in response, both because he doesn't know for sure and because he doesn't want to keep talking.
Pretending to not be home is clearly not working – the person behind the door must know that Sherlock is in here. Maybe they caught sight of one of the lights turning on through the window. Letting out a loud sigh, Sherlock gets to his feet and storms over to the door, prepared to tell whatever salesperson is behind it to piss off in no polite terms.
Obviously, I do not want you to choose a uni based solely on the fact that I'm there, and I wouldn't expect you to anyway, but if you did happen to get into Cambridge, I'd be very happy.
You text me at almost every available opportunity, and you spend entire weekends with me whenever I come back home.
He tells her he's not going to formal before she properly gets the words out. It makes her deflate, and her eyes drop to the floor.
"Sherlock," John says, his voice soft and gentle but firm at the same time. "Sit. And just... hear me out, okay?"
He wonders if their professor will be more willing to let Sherlock work alone now that Sherlock has tried to work with someone else and has proven that it does not work.
It had taken Sherlock's teachers a while to realise that he needed to be moved into a more advanced class. The issue was that when Sherlock first started high school, he was not excelling at his class work in the way that a particularly gifted student should have been. In fact, he was failing, simply because he was refusing to put in the effort, oftentimes not even submitting assignments. It made him look stupid to his teachers, who took a while to realise that Sherlock's grades and his intelligence did not line up. At first, they tried to give him easier work, treating him like he was one of the slower students who needed a little extra help to learn, but this did not improve his grades. It was only when one of the teachers caught Sherlock in one of the science labs during his lunch hour, conducting an experiment for his own enjoyment that was far more complicated than anything that they had covered in class – and, importantly, far more complicated for someone who was not intelligent – that they realised what was really happening.
"That's good," says the boy, "but still, it wouldn't be nice for you to end up being forced to work with him, or someone like him."
"All right," Sherlock says at last. "You can come back to my house. I'm sure you'd be welcome to stay the night if need be – my mother adores you."
Sherlock's face hurts. His left eye is swollen shut; he cannot see out of it. He can taste blood on his lip and he knows that there is more pooling out of his nostrils.
More accurately, Sherlock does the experiment and John sits and occasionally passes Sherlock things and once or twice puts out a minor fire.
It starts as Sherlock predicted it would, with his mother chatting away as though she has to make up for the silence coming from both Sherlock and Sherlock's father. She asks about John, about his interests, his studies, his plans for the future. She praises him when he speaks of his plans to become a doctor, and Sherlock can see the path that this conversation could take. His mind is already racing ahead; he can already hear his mother saying something about how she wishes that Sherlock would do something so important with his life, and then Sherlock will be the focus of conversation and everything Sherlock does not want to hear tonight will be said.
Mycroft complains vocally, and Sherlock, while not so vocal, certainly doesn't make it seem like he's thrilled. However, his mother has her mind set on having this party and when Sherlock's mother has her mind set on something, there's no stopping her.
John – who had glanced over at Sherlock when he spoke – turns his attention once more to the path in front of him. "I just think you don't deserve that kind of treatment," he says.
Mycroft gives him a sceptical look, and Sherlock immediately wants to make another argument. It's true, he wants to say. He did try to convince his professor to let him work alone at first. He would not have partnered with John if he had had another option. He's only John's partner because his professor enforced it.
Sherlock opens his mouth, preparing himself to speak even though he doesn't have the faintest idea of what he is going to say. John is the only person who has ever managed to do this to him – actually render him speechless. Sherlock always, always gets the last word, except when John is around, and when John does something like this.
I have to do no such thing. It's not mandated, it has no bearing on my graduation, and there are no negative repercussions for not going.
John – completely unsurprisingly – shakes his head. "No, I wouldn't want to pin that on you and leave you without help," he says.
They are rarely linear, but more often consist of fragments, bits and piece she that don't make a perfect story but that make sense while he is asleep. They're innocent, undoubtedly far more so than the dreams that many of his classmates would have had throughout their teenage years, but all the same, they make Sherlock feel warm.
They pull away, but not far. They're close enough for Sherlock to feel John's breath against his skin. It's almost too close for Sherlock to be able to see John clearly, but he can see the bright smile on John's face and the bright look in his eyes. John's palm is on Sherlock's cheek, cupping his jaw (Sherlock has no recollection of when it got there) and he gently strokes his thumb over Sherlock's cheekbone.
They curl up on the sofa, and John puts the movie on. The sofa is easily large enough for the two of them to sit side-by-side without touching, but Sherlock knows how to position himself so that he takes up a little bit more space than necessary without making it obvious that he is doing so. His knee brushes against John's, and he savours the warmth he can feel at that small point of contact between them.
Sherlock is grateful that the teacher then proceeds to call on him to answer a question, because he isn't sure how he could have responded to that.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock," his professor says, cutting off Sherlock's next argument before he has even had the chance to make it. "If you're going to be in this class, you're going to do exactly the same sort of work as everyone else, which includes doing this assignment in pairs. Now, you can either find yourself a partner, or I will assign you one."
Sherlock knows that he should keep his mouth shut, because anything he says will further this conversation, and he really, really wants it to stop, but he finds he can't help himself. "He's not with his family," he says tightly. "He's with his girlfriend."
“Sherlock…” John gently pulls Sherlock off of his shoulder, presses their foreheads together. “I know my mind’s been toyed with a lot. I’ve been half-mad trying to make sense of things lately. But you need to know what I have never lost. What has never once faded from my mind.”
John’s eyes held his for a simmering moment before dropping again. He cleared his throat. “Mrs. Hudson, you are a miracle worker,” he said too-brightly. “Sherlock up and breakfasting by the fire was not something I expected to see this morning.”
“I… didn’t want to bring up the fear we both seemed to be living with. There is another, in the kitchen, is there not?”
Sherlock huffed, his words coming in a clipped rush. “By directing magic through the fingertips, molecules are manipulated in five specific manners, resulting in five specific Skills. No human possesses more than one.”
Mrs. Hudson clucked her tongue. “Goodness, that just isn’t how it’s done. You saw how difficult it was for me to know you properly, even up close.” She chuckled softly. “The keeper of the Northern Haven is more dryad than human. Spends most of her days in tree-form. Can you imagine how disruptive it would have been for you, having a tree stroll out of the woods to have a chat about your wild blood?”
“I think I’m finally ready to share this with you. I thought of giving it to you to read on your own, but it feels better this way, reading it out. We can experience it together.”
. We’d probably just be a stupid, sad memorial about now if it weren’t for Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.” Avery’s chest heaves.
There have been more of these friendly touches of late. Sherlock has an ever-lengthening list of instances: a quick, companionable squeeze of shoulder from John; a light press to the small of the back from Sherlock... though nothing resembling a hug since John’s tears at 221B several months ago.
When the doorbell rings, he leaps up and thunders down the stairs before Mrs. Hudson can answer. He opens the door to find…
Rosamund is crumpled on the bedroom floor, her weapon – heavy, security-guard issue – loosely held in her fingers. Her body is limp.
“Yes, I am. Of course I am. You couldn’t possibly get rid of me. I don’t care how many heads you dissect on the kitchen table, you’re absolutely stuck with me.”
“Text him back. I’ll cook. Hang on,” his own phone is buzzing. John pauses mid-stride as he reads the message. “Oh. Oh my god.”
As Sherlock’s lungs cleared, John’s logic caught up with him. He watched the algae-slick wall of the starling slide past with each upward lurch, the fog swirling in around them.
this week, or so he texted me.” He grins wickedly. “Didn’t expect that marriage to last a New York minute.”
Myrcoft shrugs. The noncommittal gesture twists Sherlock’s stomach. The candy, the cigarette, the inclusion and complete lack of rancor.
Sherlock barely has time to brush a last kiss on Melissa’s head before Molly gives him a look and shuts the door in his face. He and John stand on the landing, bewildered.
“John. You have been removed from certain truths for… for such a long time. It was horrible, keeping them from you. But the alternative was unbearable. Unacceptable.” He turns away, hands balling into fists. “All I have done, John, I have done to keep you safe. But it is quite possible and even justifiable that when I have told you everything, and I intend to tell you everything, you will want nothing to do with me. Not ever again.”
“I wouldn’t say no to a neck massage later,” he says over his shoulder as he walks stiffly to the stairs.
“I was just thinking about it,” John said, startled. “Am I not blocking well, and you’re just being polite?”
As Sherlock turns, John sees his eyes are red, cheeks wet. He catches John’s eyes and a bolt passes between them. John’s own eyes well up and his throat tightens too much for speech. He just smiles at him, and hopes the pride and love are clear.
Before Sherlock could utter a proper thanks, the bottom fell out from under him as he and John were flung bodily into the air, high over the bridge. Sherlock gasped, certain they'd be dashed against the road, but their fall was suddenly slowed as he felt a gust of warm, cinnamon-scented wind catch him in its current, settling them onto the cobbles of the bridge as gently as two falling leaves.
“Oh, we knew exactly what we were doing. Your little e-mails were ever so fun to read. So informative.” Sherlock scowls as his theory is challenged. “We’re very clever. And we know
“John, pass me the camera, will you?” Without turning, he holds his hand out, expecting the camera to materialize there, not taking his eyes from the disturbing set of footprints. “I’ve found something in the victim’s tracks–”
“Wouldn’t believe the messes I stumble on. Near-overdoses, babies about to be born, couples at each other’s throats. And there I am with the Peking duck and my kit, faster than any ambulance. They usually wouldn’t call one, anyway. Like you. But this is the first time I’ve ever been
It troubled him. Dreams full of vivid sensation were usually premonitions, like the one that had warned him of John’s coming, and more danger ahead. But
He’d nearly forgotten Kinsey, but now the young private’s shock and hasty retreat made sense. John had literally shoved the ‘crackshot halfblood-finder’ right in front of Sherlock.
Feeling like he’s just swum the English Channel, John squints into the brightness and turns his head toward his friend. The tiny motion sends a terrific drumbeat of pain across his temple. From close by, Sherlock’s voice is sympathetic, though he’s grinning so hard his glittering eyes are almost lost in the folds.
Several minutes later, he stills. The echoes reverberate into silence. The water has risen almost to his knees.
60% success. I’d dance if I wasn’t so exhausted. Thanks for the tip (I thought you weren’t interested anymore…) Stay tuned.
“Oh. Right. You didn’t get trained. Well, a person’s magic pushes away from itself. It’s like trying to press two magnets together…” John trailed off, focusing on the information he was receiving through his fingertips. “Your blood pressure and sugar are dangerously low. Your core magical energy is practically nonexistent. I’ve never seen a state of magical exhaustion this advanced. Why didn’t you land if you were feeling worn out?”
good. Perhaps we should bring them into custody, perform a thorough examination to be sure they aren’t halfbloods.”
Huge thanks to my beta, shirleycarlton, who endured a LOT of rewrites to this chapter and gave excellent guidance.
Still fully clothed, John flops next to Sherlock, pulls the blankets over them both, and burrows against his soft, warm skin.
John has even had the walls decorated with a few framed pieces – a degree Sherlock had hidden away in the closet, several photos of Melissa as a baby and a more recent one of the three of them on the shore. And, most prominently, a photo Mycroft had found of Sherlock, aged fourteen, grinning into the camera next to their handsome, somewhat scruffy eldest brother, their arms around the other’s shoulders, clearly laughing at some private joke.
“I feared you would remain that way.” He looks away, suddenly shy. “We switched to alternative methods of waking you. It was Molly’s idea, actually. I made an arrangement with Mycroft. He wasn’t in favor of our plan at all, but I was… convincing.”
Strange coincidence, that. He cracks a smile as Sherlock disappears into the polished silver elevator.
he bursts out. Sherlock hears the panic in his own voice, tries to squash it down into the catacombs.
“Might want to get a doc to have a look at you while you’re here.” Lestrade grips his shoulder. “Don’t expect you’ll be going home anytime soon.”
The lab rat in the epilogue, Lyra, is a teeny tiny shout-out to Phill Pullman’s Lyra, my other most favorite love story of all time... even though he sundered them so painfully (as he tends to do. Sally Lockhart anyone?) This injustice catapulted me into my very first fanfic over a decade ago, when I didn't even know what fanfic was, reuiniting Will and Lyra at the end of their lives in the land of the dead. I should clean it up and post it someday.
Sherlock’s face crumples and he presses John’s hand to his forehead, breathing raggedly. “I heard you. But when I woke, when it looked like I’d pull through, you had forgotten everything that happened the night I was shot. Forgot who did it, forgot your bedside confession. And it was entirely my fault. Again.”
“John, this is remarkable,” he whispers reverently, eyes locked on the bee. “This beauty was unique to our fair isle from the Ice Age until 1919 when every single bee was thought to have been obliterated by the Spanish Flu.”
Perhaps John will be asleep before it’s even an issue – he’d dozed off on the drive down from Pen y Pass. But it’s too risky. If John realizes, it will crumble the already-shaky foundation they’ve rebuilt since Sherlock’s return.
made it difficult for my childhood assassin to hold a job in the family business. But she’s industrious. I imagined she just went off and started a civil war somewhere to vent her frustrations. What has she done now?”
Sherlock stands in a nice little restaurant, prim and proper, and alive but John Watson finds he does not want anymore. The love is still there, but the passion, the desire, the dreams of happiness have faded like the man he once was. They died slowly, with every loading of the gun pressed to his head and every drink on lonely nights when he begged for miracles. They died in Mary Morstan’s bed, when John had not wanted to lie there but stood helpless to the touch of a woman who only wanted to love him. Who whispered in his ear that she deserved this, and only her, who said that he was worthless and helpless and could only be loved by her.
John Watson is home from a war he was sure would kill him and nearly did. The wound in his shoulder throbs painfully like he is sure Harry’s heart would ache if he had come home to be buried and aches ever since Clara left her. She is fresh out of a divorce that has killed her emotionally, and the pain is different but it is pain all the same. Perhaps they could each benefit from the other, like they had once before, in the days of forts under covers and games in the fields. John remembers the days of their childhood, of their closeness and ability to tell each other everything. Back when they’d hid from their father’s rages together even when Mummy screamed.
John Watson knows he should call his sister. It is a recurring thought in his mind. He knows he could just as easily do it tomorrow but the call of the gun in his drawer is too much and the ache in his shoulder subsides to the ache in his heart.
No matter what he drinks or finds in alleys, no matter what he steals from stores in the hospital, he closes his eyes and he can see Sherlock’s corpse on the ground. He can feel the splatters of blood that lingered on his clothes when he shook the cadaver of his greatest friend and found it empty and wanting.
Their parents are dead, their cousins are inconsequential, and in the entirety of England the Watson’s have only themselves. Regardless of their differences, despite Harry’s alcoholism, they are family and family does not forget itself.
John Watson chases after a boy he knows will never be his; he follows him through hallways of learning, dances around bookshelves and tea sets. He examines the cut of Sherlock’s cheekbones, dreams of the blue of his eyes. He waxes poetic about the greatest man he knows though a bit challenged in societal interaction. Poor, worthless John Watson falls in love as best as a boy who was never taught love can. Sherlock fixes him without even trying. But love is never easy, and Sherlock was never one for keeping things he fixed.
John Watson dies in a pool of his own blood but for the first time loved by the man he always wanted.
The tragedy is this, the material does not matter, the physical is inconsequential, and truthfully John Watson would always be able to love Sherlock Holmes regardless of financial circumstance or legal declarations of insanity. But in this world, Robin and Batman walk down two different paths.
In 2010, John Watson is asked where he would like to be dropped off. He looks at the map of England and his heart yearns for London but his mind says no, and demands they travel up north to meet his sister.
He looks at his past from the point of view of an observer, a historian examining what was happened and ended and can never be changed again. The events of his pathetic excuse of an existence are less painful and poignant this way. They become shadows, mere fragments of who he was strewn against the wall behind him.
Four years into their relationship, John finds him pressed against the wall by a man named Jim Moriarty.
He does not meet Sherlock Holmes at a laboratory in St. Bart’s. He does not witness a drug bust or the ravings of a mad violinist. He does not chase after a man through the streets of London as if he hung the stars or sit across from him and laugh in little Italian bistros.
But really he cares little for a man he never met and he ignores the tugs on his red string of fate.
And now three years later, John Watson returns to the beginning and he stands on a ledge and he remembers.
John Watson smiles. They know. But by the time they think of the beginning, by the time they realize he did not mean the end, it will be too late.
When his daughter is a woman almost grown, a little thing with no other family but her father and terrified of her mother, John Watson kisses the bruises on her arms, tells her he loves her, writes a will with explicit instructions, raises a gun and shoots Mary first before throwing himself off the nearest balcony.
He does not know Stephen Strange, has never met him, will never see him again, so why does it feel like he’s known him all his life?
Khan Noonien Singh will commit atrocities. He will attempt to raze planets and peoples, he will tangle with the best of them, and die for nothing.
John Watson is all of eighteen years of age when he meets Sherlock Holmes. He is nineteen when he realizes there story is not one of love but of hatred and bitterness.
John storms out of the doctor’s office three steps ahead of Sherlock, shoving at the glass-plate door harder than necessary.
But it’s all been transformed—tables cluttered with lab equipment, an IV standing nearby. His eyes goggle.
“John, the proximity to this much of your skin is going to render sleep impossible,” he says, stepping close to kiss his temple.
“You always do.” Sherlock takes John’s hand, trembling less now, and brings it to his lips to brush with a kiss.
They cling together, feeling one another’s heart beat. Sherlock marvels at this metamorphosis, at bodies entwined, the slickness between them something primordial, the musk of their lovemaking a scent that now occupies a sacred space in his mind palace. Sherlock gently nibbles an earlobe.
It was better, he admits to himself, when this seemed nefarious and clever, something for him to fight. Now, it’s just horrible, mindless chaos and he feels adrift in it.
If you're curious, I often write while listening to Zoe Keating's Into the Trees, which you can sample on youtube and download from Bandcamp. She is an epic cellist who tells such vivid stories with her music. To me, it is the perfect soundtrack to this story. <3
Despite Sherlock’s concerns, they settle beneath the blankets, chest pressed to back, Johns arms around him.
. I tested Pearl and Simon today. Pearl lost her memory after six hours, Simon never did, likely won’t. It’s too early to think we’re really on to something.”
It opens quite suddenly onto a mountainside. He strides through the doorway with a grin that crinkles his eyes. The crunching gravel track leads him to a valley surrounded by towering, blue-green mountains. In the bowl at their feet he finds a long, deep lake - likely bottomless -  reflecting a summer sky scudded with cumulus clouds.
just hang on,” John quickly snakes his arms back around Sherlock to keep him from bolting. “You’re a hundred paces ahead of me, as usual. Okay. So. Pretend I haven’t been sitting in your mind listening to your internal dialog the past many days.”
A complicated expression crossed Sherlock’s face, resolving in a pained scowl. “No, that was not an option. Halfbloods are not welcome there.”
He barks one dark, dry laugh that makes Sherlock frown, eyes flicking to the IV. A lance of sun burns through the mist and he sees what he needed to find in the fog, can’t let it slip away before sleep hides it from him again.
“Yes, Sherlock,” she replies impatiently. “I will uphold my portion of our deal. I will make the necessary adjustments to my
“Aye, has been for many years,” the troll said, puffing up his chest. “I come from a long line of London Bridge trolls. Name’s William.”
monitor the man’s vitals more closely during flight. How much rest would he need to fly again? John had no idea. As a
When Sherlock finally reached them, John was holding Lissa, a heavy armful, snuggled close to his jumpered-chest as she bubbled with her story of Anura.
The dancing firelight drew his eyes to a green feline statuette perched on the table by the sofa. John picked it up, finding it heavier than he'd expected, noticing a small card had been set next to it, as if in a museum. He read the flowing, handwritten script:
The weight pushes him into the earth – he’s been lying in the forest for hours each day to avoid it. No one bothers him out here, and the proximity to trees makes it easier to visualize his garden.
He rests his ear against the wood of the door for several heartbeats, then turns the knob very slowly to prevent the old metal from creaking.
A shiver of fear goes up his spine. Is it the truth, or a power play? He can’t tell – it’s like she’s wearing an impenetrable mask. His stomach drops. The
interesting.” The medium’s eyes sparkled. “Unlike your fellow acolytes, you chose to further your study in the forbidden manipulation of base elements.
appropriate summer reading, young man,” Sherrinford mock-scolds. “Brush up on your German when it isn’t a beautiful day outside.”
They left London Bridge behind, following the bounding blaze of the fire cat into a warren of twisting streets. Sparks paused to sniff overflowing dustbins, swirled up lamp-posts, and leaped between awnings. Sleeping tenements and silent shops crowded closely on either side, rising up several stories and casting the narrow street in shadow.
Sherlock looks up guiltily from the ingredients he’s been meticulously measuring into Lestrade’s tumbler with a pipette. “What?”
“My employer! The Magpie Collective! Jesus Billy, we have to act fast. How long have I been out of it?” He suddenly growls with frustration and begins to pace. “God
“Yes, but I was still feeling incomplete.” He pressed a kiss to John’s temple as they walked through the dripping garden toward the warm glow of the cottage. “My day was missing ginger nuts, too.”
“Then, yes,” Sherlock whispers into the crook of John’s shoulder. “I want you to come back to Baker Street. Very badly.”
“Don’t,” John says, with heat. “You didn’t. Sherlock.” He pulls the book from Sherlock’s hands and sets it firmly on the table, swivels to face him. Sherlock’s eyes dart to his, wary. He forces his voice to be calm. “Look. Things have been… more than confusing. And. We’re in a new place, you and I. So let me be perfectly clear. This,” he gently touches Sherlock’s chin, “is not okay.” John bites his lip. “It’s not like it’s the first time. When you came back...”
John patted his coat pockets, feeling the familiar shape of his fire kit. He shook his head, grinning. “Okay, well done, but the answer is no. A fire’s a bad idea. It’s just too risky in your state. If your shield pops, a fire would attract all kinds of unwanted attention.”
how utterly different you appear,” Sherlock rumbled, the deep voice at odds with the new body. It was bewildering to be looking at this bland stranger, but
Domestic life with Mary had been a horror, not because it was mundane, but because they had made no sense together. If he is honest with himself, the long, quiet mornings at 221B with Sherlock were some of his happiest, but they were made all the more interesting when a day’s pent up desire could be expelled chasing a thief or a murderer together, watching Sherlock’s mind leap and dole out justice.
he thought loudly. He strained to hear anything in the thick silence of the water. His mind did not fill with Sherlock’s deep rumble. Lungs aching for air, heart pounding in his ears, John pushed for the surface. Bubbles erupted from his mouth as he collided with a solid shape.
John was unnerved to see genuine surprise on the old woman’s face. “Well, yea, quite a few times. No idea why. Could be something about his wild magic.”
Sherlock, shivering a little in his own damp clothes, tucks his chin against John’s shoulder and doesn’t respond. He tightens his grip on him, as if he could squeeze away the cold that’s sunk deep into John’s bones.
“Just Geoffrey,” he replies without missing a beat. “He’s been assigned to us as my personal bodyguard while I’m on sabbatical, maybe after.”
Please note that things (finally) heat up in this chapter. After waffling back and forth between mature/explicit ratings, I've made some subtle changes to the scene that feel right to me and drift it back closer to the borderlands of mature. This is new territory for me as a writer - I hope you enjoy!
The strangeness is too much. John folds his knees into his chest and buries his head, raking at his hair. Sherlock blinks rapidly as he absorbs this information.
Sherlock shrugs. “I thought I had. My interviews clearly indicated the death was an accident, I didn’t give them further thought. There were no physical manifestations of guilt, no tangled facts to raise any flags. The brother was grieving deeply, alarmed and hurt at the accusation against him. But. He said he understood why his sister-in-law would be looking for some tangible reason or the death, someone to blame – not just a stupid accident. The widow was equally grief-stricken. She had nothing to base her accusation on – no previous sign that the brothers had been after one another’s inheritance. It wasn’t even that large.”
“Not really. I was lightly asleep. When I heard you playing I wanted to check on her, too. You had it covered. So… I just enjoyed the show.”
Two nurses bustle off and return wheeling in a second bed and some linens. They wedge them together, make up a modest bed, and quietly slip away as Sherlock strips off his shirt, unbuttoning John’s as he gingerly holds their baby.
John marveled at her remarkable, seemingly effortless magic, but suddenly stiffened as the panther sauntered past him. A faint musky, peppery scent followed the great cat. Lune sniffed Sherlock as he padded by, then stretched out before the fire, the tip of his tail flicking.
“Sherlock,” he asks gently several minutes later, staring at a few sentences on the screen. “Are we still under surveillance?”
He wonders with a little jolt what could be waiting for them outside the well. His eyelids feel leaden, his thoughts sluggish.
“The last happened a few days ago, on the new moon. A famous aerialist from the London Circus, known for never using nets. Of course, with her subtle magic she hadn’t needed them. She fell in a terrible spectacle during a performance. They found heavy iron weights around her wrists and ankles.”
Frozen, he watches as John’s slide stops and the camera lurches backwards, recording Sherlock’s frantic attempts to tug John back up onto the ridge. He can hear their heaving breath, sees pieces of shoulders and torsos, dusty and slightly blood-smeared. His voice, cracking and strained, repeats “I’ve got you,” over and over, the lens pitched up at the sky.
The damp brickwork of a nearby building was plastered with peeling adverts, heroic illustrations of the golden, half-human Netters.
Feeling a little foolish, John experimentally tossed a stick over the stones, hearing it land uneventfully on the other side in the bracken. He held up a shaky hand and pushed it over the boundary – but again, absolutely nothing happened. Of course, this was the Wall, not a breach. But somehow, through this barrier lay a world he could scarcely imagine – where some ancestor of his had once lived, perhaps
Sherlock gave him a long, considering look. “While I cannot claim the full blood of the Faerie, I do hope I haven’t arrived too late.”
Instinctively, Sherlock turns to their suitcase dropped in the corner, but his heart sinks. He’d been so careful to think of everything – from John’s soft pajamas to his phone charger – but he hadn’t anticipated
He’s brushing his teeth and planning a pot of tea (if he can find the kettle in the wreckage of the kitchen), when he notices the mark on his shoulder’s reflection. Toothbrush dangling, he twists to examine it in the mirror, realizing with a sudden warm flush that it’s a little rosette-shaped kiss mark from the night before. Then he spots two others, closer to his neck.
The coming-home kisses. In all his years away, aching for him, Sherlock had not factored in the sweetness and relief of these kisses. He stops the charade and fills his hands with John, pulling him down with a creak of couch springs.
Huge thanks to my beta shirleycarlton for wading through an unexpected flood of writing so we can get this story clicking along after a long hibernation!
“I bet it’s his mum,” Byrum mused. “Is that it, Johnny-boy? Your Mum’s really a troll who snuck over the Wall?”
His mobile pings a pre-set alarm, jolting him out of his thoughts. Running his hands over his face, he scrubs at his eyes and sniffs loudly.
John notices a light kindling in Sherlock’s eyes as they drive through crowded London toward Baker Street. The hum and bustle of the city is a little alarming to him at first, and he feels Sherlock’s eyes on him more often, assessing his state.
John sat up carefully, his fear shifting to awe as the creature grinned at them with gentle eyes. “Th–thank you, that was very kind,” John stuttered toward the huge, shadowy face. “We would have drowned for certain.”
you did that, but if you’re going to toss my name about, at least have the decency to tell me yours.”
Several minutes pass, Sherlock holding the phone to his lips and tapping a sonata at 7 times its speed on the plastic casing. When Mycroft finally responds, he smiles, grimly triumphant.
Red t-shirt is joined by three others carrying a trim stretcher. He quickly steps out of the way, watching them shift Rosamund onto the board and attach more restraints. On a quick command, the four lift her up and carry her briskly through the kitchen and out the back door where no neighbors will notice the unusual goings-on as she is spirited into an unmarked vehicle.
This secret, shady organization run by Moran & Daughter handles development work for The League and introduces the crippling events that will emotionally scar Sherlock for years. Magpies appear in the subtext of the show, connected to Moriarty – like his wax seal - and used frequently as imagery during John’s wedding (weird...). As collectors and thieves of shiny things, magpies seemed like an appropriate namesake for a group that collects brilliant scientists and researchers for their own nefarious purposes.
“But see, that’s the fun. Dinner out is like a game. Shaking up a bottle of seltzer, but you can’t take off the cap til you’re safely behind closed doors again.”
“Watson-Holmes,” Sherlock absently corrects, feeding a sleepy Melissa her second bottle. John’s mobile says 6:47am, but it feels like they’ve been in a weirdly timeless cocoon since she arrived.
Lestrade dismissed most of his agents for the afternoon, scowling when he noticed the Netters had taken it upon themselves to re-question the circus rabble. Tobi followed his eye and frowned.
So, if you prefer not to wait on a bit of a cliff, save this chapter for a bit. I hope to have the next one to you much sooner than later. Kudos to my hard-working beta, shirleycarlton!
John reflexively takes Sherlock’s hand, puffing up his chest a little to speed along her assumptions. To his surprise, the woman grins at him, giving him a shy little thumbs-up as she gets off at the next floor down. He smiles a little, then sighs into the silence.
John thumps past him quickly to the bedroom, eyeing him approvingly in a new dark suit. He’d had to buy it one size larger than usual to accommodate an increase in flesh John says is still only a half-step above
The steamer trunk is consumed in flame. Sherlock swiftly closes the distance between their faces and John gives a surprised little gasp against his mouth. Sherlock folds his arms around him, slides his hands up John’s back, over the nape of his neck. He cups the curve of his skull and pulls him closer. John runs his hands into Sherlock’s tangled, unkempt curls and melts into him.
Sherlock’s breath comes raggedly as he paces. John, he is somewhat relieved to see, looks appropriately startled by this information.
They tuck in, their plates and cups crowding the small table between open files and grisly autopsy photos. Sherlock stays riveted to his laptop, digging again through the brothers’ public records, hacking into their social media accounts. The footprints clearly indicate a confrontation on the ridge, but he can find no sign of animosity between the two, no record of miscreant behavior, no money squabbles or comments tinted with jealousy. Grabbing for more chips, he stabs at the keyboard in frustration.
When Sherlock and John share their first kiss, Sherlock creates a tree for John in his mind palace to store all of his love and memories of him. This rapidly growing, intertwining tree of life is from the Ghibli movie
Sherlock feels the thrill percolating in his belly, sees the starling-cluster of compounds ripple and cascade through his mind. He raises one eyebrow.
Sherlock studied him seriously. “Cumbria made up the earliest fabric of your reality. A fire would have left marks of trauma. It would usually be quite apparent.”
Sherlock wakes at 4:47am to find a small bare foot pressed against his face. Their tiny daughter, as predicted, is taking up the majority of the mattress between them, head resting on John’s blanket-covered calves. Not daring to move too much, Sherlock hugs her feet to his chest and nestles his face against John’s shoulder, his breath deep and even with peaceful, dreamless sleep.
Kinsey gave him a sly wink. “Not a word, though. Can’t have a rush of cadets taking up all the good spots. But I’ll let
“Couldn’t find you,” Sherlock rumbles against his ear. John can feel his big hands clench on his back. His voice is muffled and strained, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry it took me so long, John. Please forgive me.” Sherlock sucks in a few long, shuddering breaths, but then a wave of shivering hits them both. “Let’s get out of here.”
Sherlock nods, trying not to feel too hopeful that Sherrin’s recalled some of their old game, wondering if he’ll even remember this conversation in an hour.
at his side. They dawdle in the foyer waiting for a server. Sherlock feels an effervescent ripple pulse up his arm as John casually twines his fingers into his own.
“I do not dabble in the sentimental nor do I say anything to uphold a social script. I simply relate the facts, which you are painfully disregarding, much to your detriment.”
Curled into their cocoon, Sherlock matches the rhythm of John’s breathing, a trick that usually helps him stay focused on the present… but finds he’s wandering along the cool corridors of his mind palace to the library. He scolds himself for resuming The Work and turns to leave, but finds he’s facing a door he hadn’t even realized he was searching for.
John rolls over to face him, their noses lightly touching, and whispers coyly, “Oh, I remember being spirited off to Northern Wales on a case one weekend. I remember how excited you were to drag me up that god-forsaken ridge. You were so absorbed looking for clues that you almost didn’t notice when I very nearly toppled off to join the victim.”
When nothing appeared in his hand, Lestrade turned toward the messenger boy, glowering. Here was another puffy-face recruit barely past puberty, his severe crewcut showing the tan lines of a summer laboring on the family farm before coming of age and high-tailing it to join the Queen’s Men. The Wall Division would be a brief stop for him, like so many others before, eager to line up for the glory of Netter assimilation. The boy shrank back from Lestrade.
“Just hang onto the rope, John. Keep breathing.” Sherlock stops abruptly, eyeing him critically, and seems to come to a quick conclusion. Holding onto the rope, he uses his free hand to rapidly unbutton his own sodden shirt. John squints at him with confusion, feeling his face warm.
She held up a hand to stop his outburst. “You must understand the history. After the Wall was built, captured halfbloods were simply destroyed – hunted for sport, burned at the stake. A horrific era. Then came the Secret Seas Peace Agreement of 1201.”
John’s smile faded, his face becoming fierce and thoughtful. “Don’t be an idiot. No way I’d let them catch you.”
The heavy jumble of rope unwinds down the well shaft and hits the water with a slap. Though he tries to unravel it, John’s hands are too stiff, his limbs too sluggish to make sense of it. Sherlock sees and quickly shimmies back down the rope, splashing into the water next to him. He utters a small gasp as the cold hits him anew.
His stomach twisted as he took in the freshly uncovered skin of Sherlock's throat. Ignoring his embarrassment, he gently pressed his fingertips to the sores and scabs that had chafed beneath the iron, deftly regenerating the distressed cells into smooth skin.
But it was too late. Sherlock pushed off and soared into the darkness, gripping John so hard it hurt his ribs. The wind buffeted their faces and snapped at Sherlock’s cloak. In a moment, they’d risen above the thick smoke and into clean, cold air. John frantically looked below them as they climbed. The fire was oddly contained in a circle near the clearing. He saw no sign of their pursuers.
“And not a moment too soon,” Mrs. Hudson says patting his hand. “Would have been dreadful if you had to be carted off somewhere far from home to keep you safe. Sherlock, that bit still isn’t clear to me. Why did you only have the three days? Where was he to be taken?”
The day is a royal wash. First the row with Mary. God, pregnancy hormones are a bloody nightmare. He’d stormed out of that one, too. Should have gone back right away, apologized, made her that thing with the mushrooms that settles her stomach, given her a damn foot rub in front of the telly. But the very thought had repelled him like the push of reversed magnets. This had troubled him so deeply that he’d just kept walking.
It was always difficult to tell with Netters, but Lestrade liked to imagine that the grimace and silence indicated Tallack’s embarrassed surprise. The Netters had become so reliant on their mechanical sensors and halfblood-tracking gadgets that they often overlooked vital, humble evidence
“Good sign you’re movin’. Movin’ usually means alive,” rumbled the voice. It sniffed deeply at them, it’s bulbous nose easily the size of John’s head.
“Wait,” Sherlock grimaces. “I’ll get to that.” His face falls, radiating guilt. “I wish you’d woken first, with your medical instincts. I should have noticed right away you were in distress. We rushed you to Bart’s–”
At the sound of his voice, Sherrin’s head snaps up. He runs to Sherlock. Bracing himself for fists and a roar of rage, he gives a choked cry when he’s seized into a hug.
He felt a release of tension he hadn’t even known he was holding. “What happened to the halfbloods who escaped?”
“You’re going to need antibiotics for that. I’m not any kind of real doctor these days, so you’d best get it looked at tomorrow and get a proper prescription. And I’m going to text you in the morning to make sure you do, Sherlock,” he says with a stern tone that makes Sherlock’s soft gaze snap into focus. “Because I can tell you’re the kind of idiot who would ignore himself in favor of something more interesting.”
Sherlock sets the carton of mango sticky rice onto the table with a decisive slap. John, sucking noodles off of his soup spoon, looks up with wary expectation. Now that it’s here, really here, his mouth goes dry. Sherlock looks down into his lap. John groans with exasperation.
“Fine, alright,” John relented, deflating with a sigh. “Mrs. Hudson told me that before Toria’s reign, the royalty had a sort of deal with a Faerie called Our Lady.
“Of course I did.” Relief washes over John at this incredible information, stirring his mind into wakefulness. “But it’s been a while since I’ve picked a lock in the dark, underwater, upside down.”
“John! John, I’m here!” Sherlock suddenly leans over the side of the well, his voice bouncing around the walls as he lowers a bulky bundle from another rope.
Sorry I’ve been so quiet. Things have been bloody awful. Sherrinford fell ill suddenly. A coma, from a virus. He was dying, but the doctors found a cure. He’s home now, getting better. Sort of.
“She may disagree as the elimination of Brook’s most influential second in command meant the dissolution of The Magpies, her life’s work and haven.”
The nurse comes in to change John’s IV. Sherlock deduced her yesterday and found her trustworthy. He’s oddly comforted by her quiet black eyes, her arms strong from a decade of healthcare work and raising five children on two continents. He also finds it endearing that she enjoys needlepoint and horsemanship, the clues evident on her fingertips and eyelids and in the musculature of her shoulders and legs. Giving him a little nod, the nurse goes about her work. Sherlock studies her intently, carefully recording everything she does. When he speaks in her native Farsi, she jumps.
“John, your currently compromised state is the only excuse for your lack of observation. This is not a
Sherlock stops, lightly affronted, and studies John with a scowl. His attention snaps to the street. He blinks rapidly, a slow grin growing on his face.
What will become of it? Will Mary terminate the pregnancy? There’s still time. Or will she keep it as the spoils of her conquest? Retain it for future blackmail? He fumbles with the tapes, frowning. He can postulate all he likes about the child’s position in his game of chess with Mary, but the simple realization sits firmly in his mind, shocking him.
“This morning, while watching the street through the window, I noticed the push-carts splashing through a considerable puddle by the curb as they passed. It must have rained either while I was asleep yesterday, or during the night.”
Sherlock, for his part, tries to contain his astonishment. The new serum is completely different from the version he’d used on Sherrin so many years ago, following a line of research he’d read about last summer at the Cottage, kindling his curiosity and, bit by bit, pulling him out of his stubborn fear.
“I’ve been interested to learn what makes these bees so different that they could survive an epidemic.” He is quiet a moment, then says soberly, “The bees are disappearing, John. It could be catastrophic to every ecosystem their pollination sustains if we lose them, not to mention our own food system. I’ve found the subject fascinating – no one knows quite why they’re dying, though theories point toward the weakening impact of pesticides to their immune systems. Did you know they can be trained to detect bombs and can distinguish human faces? There’s actually a Knightsbridge bee walk I’d like to do one day, if you’d like to come along.”
“Well,” Sherlock breathes. “Glad we’ve finally cleared that up.” He begins to giggle. John’s composure cracks and he leans his forehead against Sherlock chest, wheezing with laughter.
John eases away and places a hand onto Sherlock’s chest, over his healing scar. He can feel Sherlock’s heartbeat drumming against his palm, eyes shining, burning into him. John’s voice is rough, quiet, the breath of his words soft on Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock turns back, obeying, perches awkwardly on the edge of the narrow bed, piercing eyes reading him, eyebrows puzzled. “Yes, sorry. I’m here.”
“Now, as I was saying. No two methods will be identical. The glamor relies on your unique magical acumen – a combination of the wild magic from your Faerie ancestors and the singular skill you inherited from your human brethren. You first need to….”
Sherlock feels himself blush, but the quills don’t rise to protect. He finds he actually wants Sherrin to know. It would be such a relief, to share what had been possibly the best thing to ever happen to him,
After packing a small bag of his belongings, all scrutinized by an operative, they are released from the house.
of course, strictly to advise.” He leaps to his feet and pulls John into a classic ballroom spin, hugging him to his chest. “Oh love,” he sighs, “it’s Christmas.”
Sherlock stands guard over the three aggressors lying in a defeated, semi-conscious heap at his feet. One struggles to stand, but he roughly kicks the boy’s legs out from under him.
“Of course,” Lestrade smiled politely, his stomach turning at the sight. “You’ve brought a Skutter’s Dome? We’ll need to track them on foot with a wide range.”
The utterance does something alchemical to Sherlock’s blood. His throat constricts and tears sting his eyes. He knows. God, how he finally knows. John’s body has been chanting this to him like a mantra - and not just tonight, with their naked flesh. Sherlock’s known for years, but was never allowed to admit it if John wouldn’t say it. How many exposed looks had John averted, how many fierce scowls of jealousy? It doesn’t matter anymore. He hugs John’s solid warmth to him, every cell singing.
“Sherlock,” she interrupts, “I want you to start comparing the t-cell count of fresh blood samples again. We may have overlooked something.”
He scrunched up his face in disgust. “She surgically combines them with machines. Replaces whole limbs and organs with clockwork.”
"Hold on, let me just–" He tugs at Sherlock’s pajamas. Sherlock lets him go and obligingly tilts his pelvis for John to pull them off and toss onto the floor. "Yes, much better." John sits back on his heels, briefly enjoying the sight of him sprawled and breathless on the bed in just his shirt. With a startle, he suddenly jumps up, stumbling for a step, and locks the door. “Just in case.”
“Tea would be. Good. Ta.” He hugs the union jack pillow to his chest, watching with a sleepy, fond grin as Sherlock putters around the kitchen, uncovering the kettle from a disorderly pile of lab equipment on the counter. The trip to and from the bathroom has drained him. As he listens vaguely to the sounds of Sherlock filling the kettle, the traffic on Baker Street, and Mrs. Hudson’s hoovering below, his eyelids droop.
Sherlock’s own personal storm cloud shifts and he grins, changing course to meet him. His smile slips when his brother’s features become clear. Bloody lip, bruised eye, swelling around the left cheek, his left arm held close to his torso. His stomach clenches with worry.
John stares hard at him, a pulse of anger and grief warring on his face, fists clenching. He bites out his words in a barely restrained roar. “I watched you
“We’ve got to keep moving,” Sherlock muttered, giving John’s arm a small tug as he weakly trudged on. John matched his slow step shoulder to shoulder, watching from the corner of his eye for any sudden dizziness.
Sherlock grins. “Clifton’s was the only fruit market I could find carrying passion fruit within a tube ride, and I had to go quickly lest they sold out. I… couldn’t help thinking a great deal about what you’d said the other day about the oddness of the baby growing
“You’re monsters,” he whispers, shaking, the emotion crowding out of the catacombs and threatening to overwhelm him. “Making these drugs, doing this to him, just to get to me.”
“Went anyway. Right, ‘course. Not like Sherlock to leave you behind.” Greg leans against the wall, arms crossed, eyebrows knit. “Can you remember anything from when you were at Magnusson’s?”
“I hope I’ve set up the sofa according to your needs. The bathtub is just down the hall for fresh water and disposal. If you will permit it, I will assist.”
The lift pauses to admit an elderly woman in a blue cardigan. They budge over to give her space and smile politely as she coos at the baby, then studies the two fathers with a too-curious look they are becoming very familiar with.
“Mr. Holmes, evening.” Immune to his sour tone, the willowy young half-Scottish-half-Japanese youth gives him a lopsided grin full of braces. He holds out the bag. “Your usual, sir.
“Bit big for one, assuming–” he seems to remember himself and blusters, “assuming it’s just you, which, again, is none of my business.”
Sherlock was standing in a shabby sitting room, empty of furniture. A cold wood stove crouched in the corner. Bluish daylight filtered in through a single dusty window. He flexed his fingers. They were large and pale and moved when he wanted them to.
Herself a Mundane, the young Queen’s reputation as a brilliant clockworks engineer was well-known. At her coronation, she astounded the crowd with a small army of modified clockwork men demonstrating their feats of speed, leaping onto balconies with spring-loaded legs and scaling buildings with silver claws, primitive compared to today’s Netters, but still impressive.
“Course, Sir. Be a blessed relief after this horror.” She irritably slapped the copper flank of her steed. “London, is it? You really think they flew that far?”
himself to look like a different person had never resulted in any change to his appearance. Now he understood why. He had to tap into his mundane magic as well.
“The trace John, oh, don’t you see?” He’s suddenly flushed with excitement. “She’s like a caged predator testing the bars for weakness. She knows we can follow her moves, so she makes erratic jumps. When we’re there to intercept her, she knows we’re still tracking her. By now she’ll have determined that her trace was ingested, will probably have isolated it to the tea and knows it’s only a matter of time before she makes a move and we can’t follow her.”
Sherlock nods, easing back up to his feet. “I wouldn’t have fallen. But your reflexes, Doctor, are admirable as always.”
Sherlock shrugged. “He didn’t give me a lot of details – it can be very damaging knowing the particulars of a prophecy. She seems to think we’re here to help her end the halfblood murders.”
“Yes,” she said simply, taking a sip of her liqueur. “Sherlock and he have been having a nice long chat in the dreamstate. Lune tells me the important bits.”
“The things you do for your jollies…” John says with warmth. “So, you evade my attention. You want to be getting somewhere in the same direction as the clinic, but you don’t want me to know. And you want to get there bright and early. But why Clifton Green’s market? The bag is in the kitchen bin on top.”
“Just keep some on you, always. You never know when your next prince charming’s going to waltz into your path and destroy your better judgement. You’re smart, Billy, but we all get stupid in the heat of the moment.”
shots. There is a terrible roar in the room as he scrabbles on the floor, his head colliding with the mattress. He realizes what he’s hearing is his own voice, a growling rage spilling from him that he can’t stop. He feels hands grip him in the dark, John –
As Sherlock and John move in, one of the bullies shoves at Chen, knocking him to the ground. Another winds up to kick, but in the time it takes him to shift his balance to the other foot and aim, John has tackled him to the ground, spinning him onto his stomach in a quick, clean wrestling maneuver. He twists the bully’s arm sharply, making him howl. In a flash, before the others can recover from their surprise, John is back on is feet, flexing his fingers, eyes shining.
Sherlock grins widely and pulls John to him, hugging him with a fervor, then kisses him on the path amidst the crowd.
“Look, it’s not what you think. I hardly contributed anything, I just helped him think it through a bit.”
interns pulling their weight, gathering lots of data, and compiling it all into reports for you to review. This is what senior researchers do, love.”
“We can vouch for you, mate,” he stage whispers as John thumbs her speed contact, then walks to a far corner of the small hospital room, fumbling through a lame apology.
“Well then,” Lestrade said mildly, rolling up the playbill and pushing it into Tallack’s hands. “I imagine we’ll need to pay extra attention to that hostage of his.”
“For starters, she had inherited some unfinished business her father and I had been conducting. Long ago.”
Despite the forewarning, or perhaps because of it, the door explodes open and Sherlock charges in, hair sleep-mussed and dressing-gown flapping, eyes wild. He slams his hand on the light switch, blinding them.
“Incredible… so, if you kept walking through those trees, would you stumble into the streets, or hit the Wall, or what?”
As he stands in the hot water, an uncomfortable thought crystallizes. Eventually, John will find a girlfriend. John will get married, as people do, and he and Rosie will leave. Rosie will have a step-mum. He’ll be relegated to
