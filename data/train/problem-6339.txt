“I’m sorry,” he said, reaching down and touching Tony’s leg with featherlight fingertips. He leaned up to pull the covers away and see the slightly bruised, hand-shaped marks and memories of too-tight grips. Steve sucked in a breath and felt a little sick to his stomach. “Shit,” he swore under his breath. He’d promised Tony so many months ago to never lay a wrong hand on him. Sure this was not the usual circumstances that Tony got bruises from but still, it felt so wrong to see them on him again and because of Steve, no less.
Clint nodded slowly. Thinking about the day he was taken made him angry. Angry with himself for being stupid and putting James through all of this because he didn’t think he needed the protection.
The next day it was time for Tony to meet up with Pepper. During the last few weeks of healing and spending most of his time with Steve, Clint, or Benni, Tony didn’t get to spend much time with her. Never before had he had that many people to socialize with and it was a nice change of pace.
He hummed at the kiss, reaching out blindly to rest a hand on his shoulder. “No, please don’t go. Even if I sleep, please stay.”
“Nothing to thank me for but you’re, of course, more than welcome,” Steve said, lifting Tony’s hand to his lips and pressing gentle kisses to each of his knuckles.
Falsworth laughed. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll never be accepted. You’ll always have to carry on your unnaturalness in the shadows. Doesn’t it bother you? Knowing you weren’t made right? That you’re a fucking
Steve chuckled. “We went back to his place and then I left around midnight.”
However, Clint wasn’t really the sitting around type. Not when he was forced into a situation. He could most definitely spend a few days in bed with James doing nothing but he had never been the lay down and roll over type. He wasn’t sure about Tony but he decided to test the waters anyway with an idea he had been thinking about since the last time they had brought the food.
Steve nodded, listening and processing. And then he said, quiet but honest, his eyes intense, “Howard aside, it’s a damn shame you think anyone could not see you.” He smiled softly. “I had you come every week to keep an eye on your marks and bruises, but apart from that I did it because seeing you relaxed me.”
“I take it your visit isn’t social?”
I promised you I’d give you a proper hug once you were all healed,” she told him, her voice soft, soothing. “Since it’s been a while since you’ve been out of that cast, I figured I owed you more than one lousy hug.” She held him tighter, laying her head on the side so her cheek was pressed against his soft hair.
“That’s not true. It’s not true and you know it. You’ve given him love.”
,” he added, his eyes on the door again, “this isn’t the first time they’ve come after me. They tried in the summer, too. I think if we got you out, they’ll search but at least they won’t kill me.”
“Went to see James,” she said casually.
“Hi, love,” Steve answered, his grin impossible to stop and it spread wide across his entire face. He brushed Tony’s hair away from his forehead and pressed a kiss there. “You’re safe. I’ve got you.”
“They were talking. Didn’t want to eavesdrop,” Tony said simply and it seemed to be enough for Sarah.
“Repeat it again and you’ll be on bathroom duty for a week, Barton. Don’t test me,” Rhodey threatened. Clint promptly shut up and put his head down. Rhodey turned back to Tony, glaring daggers at his best friend.
The door closed and James was left in the room with Dmitri and Monet. Steve had made his purchase for Tony and left but James still had some decisions to make.
The water was sat down more carefully and this time it was two glass bottles of water instead of two glasses. Clint got up to get the water first, handing Tony his and then bringing his tray over to join him on his mattress so they could eat together.
. Steve moved his hand, doing his best to make sure Tony was enjoying it, and then before he even realized what was happening he was picking Tony up and carrying him out of the study, kissing him softly.
He squeezed Benni’s hand and watched him leave the kitchen. “Sorry. I’ll go clean up my hands.” With a small kiss on Sarah’s cheek and a nod to James, he got up to go upstairs.
Phil led James and Steve through the back to Clint’s office, opening the door for them.
Sarah moved forward towards him and ran her fingers through his hair, standing on the other side of the bed to Tony and James remained at the foot. She kissed his hair.
Never have I ever thought of you to be cruel.” He considered getting up to look at him, to look him in the eyes so he knew that Tony was serious. In the end he decided against it because Steve and he were in such a comfortable, intimate position.
“What is it?”
“Just talking to Tony today about marriage, is all.” That melancholy note was still there in his tone, in the soft way he formed his words.
“Top of the mornin’ to ya,” she said with a grin, teasing her sleepy son with the phrase.
“Platypus?” Clint asked, his mouth full of donut.
Steve nodded, processing that. “And you’re sure you can trust Phil?”
“Steve is the best. He cares a lot and doesn’t always think before he acts but he always means well,” he whispered. If the men who were holding him heard him talk about Steve they probably wouldn’t like it. “If we ever get out of here, you should give him another chance.”
Tony smiled in response, still resting against Steve and not wanting to pull away, not even for the food right in front of him.
“You got everything?” Steve asked, looking at the two suitcases sitting at the front door. They hadn’t packed much and occasionally James would go back home to bring something either of them wanted anyway.
He took the bread and water and went back to his cot, sitting with his hearing-enabled ear towards the door and folding his legs underneath him and eating. His stomach was growling which unfortunately for him wasn’t any kind of useful indication of the passage of time because he was always hungry. He closed his eyes and listened carefully for anything.
“You were sleeping when I came home.
Behind the pictures he saw three books lying in front of the other books and they looked as if they had been read over and over again, much like the books Tony had from his mother. Never would he have thought that Steve liked
Tony chuckled and leaned in to kiss Steve sweetly. “Now go back to resting. Everything’s taken care of and you’re paler than a glass of milk.” He was honestly worried about him. Not his safety but his well-being.
He went back to the store but couldn’t find the strength to open up again and welcome customers. Instead he went upstairs and lied down on his bed and curled up to sleep the hunger away. Feeling the bitter cold around him he remembered the warm touch on his knee, on his back, and chest. If he had thought that he was pathetic back then, he’d rather not have Mr Rogers see him in his situation now.
“For showing up at my door with a bag of greasy burgers determined to not let me be alone.” He pressed a kiss to the side of Clint’s head.
Tony’s eyes lingered for a moment on the blood on James’ shirt, wondering if the other person was still alive. There was no judgement in his thoughts but simple and honest curiosity. Though the Russians had a reputation for being more prone to violence when something wasn’t going their way.
Tony turned to look at him and answered without hesitation, “More than I could ever say.”
“Ouch,” Clint said, sarcastically. “Break my heart why don’t you?” He repositioned himself, his left side where he had recently been hit was aching. “You’re not my first choice either, pal. In fact, I’d easily trade you for an Oreo right about now.”
Steve removed his hat and ran a hand over his hair to smooth it down. He looked around the room and then said, “I’m here to see Monet St. Croix. She’s expecting me.”
“I’m glad you have him. I’ll treat it with honor until I can give it back to you. Thanks for sharing it with me.”
“You have better things to do than to talk to me about these things.” Tony shook his head and in any other situation he might have gotten up to leave Steve but somehow he couldn’t find it in him to do that. “
. He pulled Tony onto his lap, wrapping his arms around him, and burying his face in between his shoulder blades. He raised his head but only enough that now his nose was pressed against the silky soft baby hair on the back of his neck. He pressed a kiss there.
Steve popped the button on Tony’s pants and tugged them down, easily lifting his legs to completely discard them onto the floor and then he leaned down and planted more kisses on the inside of Tony’s thighs, the skin there burning hot and Tony writhed under Steve’s touch. He held a thigh in each hand, squeezing, his fingers digging in but he released a little when he thought about what he was doing. Perhaps rough sex wasn’t for someone just getting away from years of physical abuse.
There that touch was again. The gentle warmth that spread throughout his body, making his stomach flutter in the most unusual way.
Bucky walked in barely awake and yawning, rubbing his tired eyes only to stop dead in his tracks when he saw Steve sitting at the table with his cup of coffee and breakfast. He scratched his head, looking around for any sign of Tony and then back to Steve.
Steve hesitated, not sure where she was going with this and quite frankly, not liking it. He didn’t say anything, just kept his eyes focused on the wall in front of him, shutting down his face.
They chatted for a while longer until Clint’s conversation was finally coming to an end and he was making his way back to the bar. It took him all of five seconds to notice the man leaning against the bar beside Natalia and then his face lit up like the Rockefeller Christmas Tree.
“I know,” Clint said, watching Lucky sleep. “I really wish I could explain to him that I’m not leaving him for good and that I’ll be back.”
“What’s the yellow stuff that looks like candy?” Falsworth asked.
While he waited for Pepper to arrive, Tony brought Steve fresh coffee and muffins where he was standing in front of an empty canvas.
Steve gave him a tired smile. “Like it so far?” He was going to take James’ advice. Well not advice,
Steve stood in the hallway, wondering which room Tony was in since the doors were closed. He knocked on Benni’s but the boy was already asleep so he closed it softly and when he turned, Tony was peeking his head out of Steve’s bedroom and Steve went in, shutting the door behind him.
“I would not,” he said, smiling again, and Clint felt some tightening in his chest release as the smile touched his eyes.
“Pet, come on. I saw you when you were pining after James and I’m watching this and I just
Despite the exhaustion from traveling, cleaning the more important parts of the house, and cooking a meal with Steve, Tony couldn’t stay asleep. Everything was different here and even though he had his one constant right next to him he felt restless. Knowing that Steve was fast asleep and that nothing could wake him at this stage, Tony turned on the light on the nightstand next to him. In New York there was light coming in from the street lamps. Ever since Tony had been back he needed some light when he woke up. Here it was completely dark and that scared him.
“Not bothered. Worried. She doesn’t need to worry about me more than she does.” Steve held Tony closer, not sure what he meant. “I am enjoying this too.”
James laughed, reaching over to pull Clint’s face closer to kiss him slowly, James feeling himself relax and sink into the bed.
“Tony?” Steve asked and Tony turned his attention back to Steve who was looking at him intensely. “Are you sure?”
but he also knew those negative thoughts and feelings weren’t gone just yet. Even now he wanted to ask Tony if anything Steve had done had hurt him but he didn’t want to ruin the mood and, more importantly, Tony’s mood. “Feeling sleepy now.”
“I understand,” she told him, moving in closer to pull him into a hug. “I’m not judging you. Hearts are fickle and complicated. I know you’re helping in the best way you can.”
James nodded, kissed him, and disappeared. Clint turned to Natalia, intertwining their fingers and she raised his hand to kiss the back of it, talking to him while they waited for James to return.
“I could tell he never felt the same and I didn’t want him with me just because I was the only option of that sort,” he explained. “So I broke it off. Started dating some girl. Don’t even remember her name. Steve and I never revisited it and then we started building, well, this,” he said, gesturing to the room around him. “It became more difficult even just to see each other for a drink as friends. More was near impossible and now? Now it’s too late.”
Steve went to the piano and thought about playing, standing there, arms crossed, staring at the keys but no inspiration came, no real desire. So he left the living room and didn’t bother with the study because he knew he couldn’t focus on a book.
He wondered if he had waited too long. It
“Ah, my favorite customer returns,” Tony said with a smile and poured Steve a cup of coffee, adding a spoonful of sugar and stirring it in as he walked over to him. “And here I was thinking I wouldn’t get to talk to him while we were away. Thanks.” He kissed Steve’s cheek and grabbed his second cup of coffee before sitting down next to him. “I’m nervous but also excited to see what you planned.”
James walked up to him—he was heavily sedated—and pushed his hair out of his face, pressing a kiss to his forehead, whispering something too quiet for the others to hear, and then stepping back to make way for Sarah and Tony.
“What?”
“I—oh. Could you do Saturday?”
“Would be nice,” he agreed.
The next few days were uneventful but also very lonely. Tony hesitated many times before he reached out to Clint just to talk to him every now and then. Other than that he spent a lot of time reading and making bread or pasta, especially all of his little brother’s the favorites.
Steve made a mental note of Tony’s words. He would
“Her something borrowed for her wedding.” Tony looked at Steve with a warm smile, still holding the record against his chest. This had been the song they had first danced to together and it held a precious place in his heart. That was part of the reason why he wanted to give it to her in the first place. Maybe it would make her feel the same closeness if she danced with her husband to it.
“Rogers!” Falsworth yelled. The neighborhood was silent. It had been a while since their last shoot out but not long enough that they forgot how to behave. The windows shut up tight, the streets cleared, lights out. Another shot from a different direction, a handgun, not the machine Falsworth was sporting.
“He’s mayor now. He’s busy during the day and surrounded by security detail,” James explained.
“Two fractures and the rest are just bruised. You’ll be able to laugh at your own jokes soon enough,” James reassured him with a gentle smile, his fingers still on Clint’s face just in case James blinked too long and he disappeared. He needed the constant contact to convince himself Clint was back and real.
“At least they’re together,” James said, the only comforting piece of information they had received in weeks. “Seems like they like each other too.”
She sipped her tea and returned the cup to its saucer. James did the same, waiting patiently but slowly losing his patience as he continued to think about what Clint was going through. It made his heart ache. He desperately wanted to hold him. And he hoped Tony was alright.
“So what?”
“I’m not. I’m just sayin’ what I’m feeling.”
“Sure thing.”
James chuckled. “What friends?”
Afterwards, Benni and Sarah went to the living room. Sarah really didn’t have to worry about anything but her son for once, so Tony helped James with the dishes silently.
“Of course. I don’t hold a grudge because Steve chose Tony. It’s hard, yes, but I hope he’s happy.”
“Brock,” was all Cap said.
“Your mother’s home by the way,” James said, having heard her heels come down the hallway a little while ago.
Steve smiled, looking down at the sidewalk while they waited to cross the street. He raised his head and met Bucky’s eyes.
Steve chuckled, and started pressing kisses on his chest again. “I’m your boss, huh?” he asked, his voice low and breath hot against Tony’s skin.
James struggled a little more to get his own reaction under control. The pure rage and hatred that washed over him when he realized he could feel all of Clint’s ribs so easily was almost overwhelming.
He dove back into his work which didn’t make his mother particularly happy but at least he wasn’t at home oversleeping and not eating so she could deal with the lesser of two evils.
Steve turned to him, rubbing his back comfortingly. “What’s wrong?”
. Tony hated how bitter he sounded in his own head. “They better. Sarah misses you like crazy.” Though Sarah wasn’t, of course, the only one who missed Steve. “Benni does too…” he added, softer.
“Oh,” Rhodey said, raising his eyebrows, “then maybe the porno fit
At the three hour mark, a solid, satisfying plan had been formed including individual duties and responsibilities. It would be an initial four man team—Steve, James, Dugan and Dmitri. There would be others—Jones, Alexei, Vitaly and a few more of James’ men—stationed around the perimeter. No one else in and no one else out. In fact, they were instructed to shoot to kill any of Bakuto’s men that they spotted trying to get away.
“Did I wake you?” Steve finally asked after a long silence and much mental debate over what to do.
“How are you with research and the process of elimination? I have some new recruits and I’m supposed to look through them and weed out the bad and keep the good. Can you do it for me? I have a few calls to make this morning first and you’d be doing me a favor.” Tony seemed hesitant at first but he accepted. Steve had already done this and he’d already given Jones his answers but he was curious to see if he and Tony would share the same opinions.
Saturday unless scheduling ahead of time when to see each other is a part of your dating process,” Tony teased, relieved when Steve laughed.
Tony mumbled and went back to looking through the sheets again. His ideas actually made sense. Some time later, Tony couldn’t say how much time had passed, the door swung open again and he saw Steve dragging someone in. Someone who looked unhappy when they probably should have been scared. He didn’t know whether or not he could speak openly with Steve so he decided to stay quiet and get up, straightening his shirt and waistcoat.
I do then?” His Italian accent was thicker when he was upset, like he was then. There was the frustration about Benni who should know better, the frustration that he didn’t have anything productive to do, and the frustration about the confusing things his body was up to lately.
“Fine.” Rhodey motioned for him to follow but Tony stopped in front of Steve. “Tony,” Rhodey nearly hissed. Tony considered inviting Steve on the tour to keep things civil—in other words, to stop Rhodey from choking him and throwing him out—but he figured Rhodey was angry enough for the time being.
“You and me both,” Steve said, eating the food but not really tasting it. His mind had since moved on to other things. Well, moved
“What is this supposed to mean, huh?” He pressed the paper into Tony’s face, making it impossible for him to read it. “Strike one?! What have you done?”
James’ wrath—but if she were to get caught in the crossfire of an attempt on his life, he’d never forgive himself.
Tony held Steve in his arms, combing through his hair as he listened, whispering how much he loved Steve in Italian. There was nothing he could say or do that would help Steve, nothing that would change the world or situation they were in. The world wasn’t kind but Tony promised Steve he would find a way to make it up to him.
Steve came in, angry and annoyed, and was grateful for it because then he wouldn’t make the stupid mistake of grinning up at Tony who looked absolutely wonderful in his suit. He wouldn’t wink at Tony or try to kiss him or hug him like he wanted because he was pissed.
But not for Bakuto. In fact, they were his target demographic. Young girls he brought over to America only to sell them like cattle and never look back. Too often James’ men brought back reports of young girls no older than fifteen being forced onto street corners to earn their keep. Other times, his men would report bodies found left in alleyways, dumpsters, and every other conceivable place and all the girls always fit Bakuto’s usual type selection. James and Steve found it despicable.
Tony felt Sarah’s relief, knowing how tense she had been the past few hours. Whenever he felt the same way, like it was hopeless and taking too long and that there was a real possibility he would never see Steve again, he thought back to the night he spent with Steve and the promise he had given Tony.
He sat down on the chair left of James and Sarah and stared at the painting on the wall. A flower bouquet on a table next to a cup of coffee and a candle on the small table as well. He would be fine. Soon someone would come in and tell them that the operation went well and they could see Steve, who would be out of here in a matter of days tops. And while Tony stared at the picture, he waited for that someone to come and tell them exactly that.
He dropped his eyes to the floor. He didn’t want to talk about Tony right now. He was at his limits.
“What? What did I do? I brought goodies, asked for a tour,
“I checked them myself. Some had torn,” he told him. “But I’m fine. Dugan and Jones are staying with me, you know. They’re taking good care of me.”
“Probably,” Steve said.
A good twenty minutes later the can was filled with fresh coffee. “It’s not ideal but better than the batch before. You should get the coffee machine from the deli. There are one or two small sacks of coffee beans in the pantry.” He had sat down across the table from Steve and leaned back in his chair. He was proud of himself that he remembered to unbutton his jacket before sitting down. Suits weren't that bad after all.
“Eighteen, sir,” he answered. “Turning nineteen in May.”
Tony was irritated to say the least. Why was Clint like this? Only someone who wasn’t really in danger would make light of their situation, right? And only an affiliate of the Asian men wouldn’t be in real danger, which meant he must be one of them! For now Tony decided to ignore him and focus on nothing but Steve. Luckily he had more than enough memories to revisit.
“Is there food? I’m famished,” Steve said, bending to plant a kiss to Tony’s head and then going over to the fridge to investigate.
“Yeah. Have been for a few years now.”
“How do I look?”
Tony nodded in response and that was that.
When Benni was changed and tucked in, Tony sat on his bed to run his fingers through Benni’s soft hair. His little face was still red and puffy from crying as much as he did. Not wanting to be rude, Tony kissed Benni a last time and headed back downstairs to wish the others a good night. For a moment he stood there and looked at Steve and smiled. Just looking at him made Tony feel better, at least a little.
Tony exhaled loudly, not realizing he had been holding his breath, and slumped against Sam who did the same, a hand over his face as he caught his own breath.
“Hungry?” he asked Clint who was wearing his hearing aids despite having been asleep. He refused to remove them.
likes fellas.”
“Please, tell me,” Tony said. “Better yet. Let me see him.”
“Uh, I don’t really know the rules for this,” Steve said at full volume and the man’s eyes flew open and he sat up, a hand coming up to his head as he did and his eyes closing again. “At the very least, you don’t
“That’s not it,” he said slowly. He couldn’t tell her why. There was no way he could. Or should, for that matter. Who knew who was listening. Suddenly he felt scared again. Scared Howard would find him. He couldn’t and Tony knew that. He had shot Howard in his face. Howard was as dead as they got.
James got off on the fifth floor, said there was something he needed to do, didn’t give specifics, and left them, his men following him out of the elevator. That left Steve, Dugan and Tony heading down to the ground floor.
Monet moved to the other table and pulled out a velvet box, opening it to reveal seven rings inside, all varying in thickness, color and, he assumed, karat. He quickly dismissed the silver ones. He thought silver would look nice with Tony’s complexion but at the same time, he wanted gold. It would look better.
“There you are,” Tony smiled, immediately making himself comfortable next to Steve. “Business all taken care of?” he asked, one hand on Steve’s thigh.
“Good morning, lad,” Steve said, sure that if Tony wasn’t already awake, he was now. Benni came over and crawled into Steve’s lap.
“My men are coming with the ambulance,” James said reassuringly, dropping his tough-as-hell facade when only in the presence of his friend. “You know he will get the best possible care.”
But soon.
Once they had all filled themselves, James and Clint helped clean up. Clint gathering plates and cutlery into a pile for James to take to the sink. Steve stayed beside Tony, gently stroking his hair, wanting him to sleep some more.
“So you support it?”
sì, andiamo (Italian) - yes, let's go
“I heard you stopped by Stark’s today again. That’s what? The third time this week?”
“I know,” Benni said. “But it’s warm here and safe and our home.” There was that unexpected maturity in his little brother.
” He was frozen in his current position, unable to even lean in to give his brother a kiss or a hug. It took too much effort, too much energy. He couldn’t risk that.
The phone was pressed to Clint’s ear forcefully and he winced, the cold, hard plastic slamming against his head. Clint looked up at the man and then said, “Hello?” He assumed it was James on the other end but how the hell was he supposed to hear? Did they really not know?
On top of that all, Steve and James had been paying him bi-weekly visits just to remind him how monumentally he had screwed up and because they had promised Loki that whatever was done to Clint and Tony would be done to him. Unfortunately for Bakuto but fortunately for Loki, they couldn’t have the mayor of New York City walking around with a broken leg, couple broken ribs, and enough bruises to make people think he had dyed his skin blue. But no one was ever going to see the leader of the Hand again, so it absolutely did not matter.
“Feeling better too,” Tony answered Dugan and nodded. It was true. Never before had he gotten this much sleep and rest. “Thanks for this.” He held the bear up, smiling when the man turned around with a small scoff.
“I still have a hard time believing this is all happening, you know?” He exhaled deeply and closed his eyes before remembering the question he had. “Hey, that name you called me earlier? In my office. What does it mean?”
“Don’t maybe me, Steve. He likes being around you.” That was the second time someone had told him as much so why couldn’t he believe it? Why was it so much easier to think that Tony would want to get away as soon as possible? “Speak.”
The guy winked and said, “Nah, on the house. You guys were the first responders two weeks ago to my cousin’s car accident. He’s alive because of you.”
“Who’s acting lieutenant with you gone all morning?” Steve asked, rolling to a stop at the light.
Dugan looked out the window and then said, “More letters came.”
When he could, he moved again to Tony’s leg and inspected the damage, knowing he had gotten caught up. He pressed kisses to the redder places and breathed quiet “I’m sorrys” against his leg, finally resting his head on Tony’s thigh, too comfortable and too tired to move again.
“Dugan! Jones!” He called, just loud enough for them to hear, but neither of them moved. He reached up, thankful to feel a pulse on both of them, strong and steady but they were out.
man—care about him and his home life? But especially Steve, the Irish mob boss who was not known for being kind and gentle.
“I do. A lot.”
Slowly, so slowly and reluctantly, Steve began sliding out of the bed. He needed to get ready for work. He had an actual thing to do this morning. He turned to Tony. “You mind if I tell ma?”
James nodded, groaning and knocking back the rest of his whiskey. “So we started discussing a problem with a more obvious solution: Bakuto.”
“You know mine?” He asked in surprise, tilting his head to the side. “August 10th.”
“No, just thinking about it. What it’ll be like.”
Loki cut himself off as James stood and straightened his waistcoat, taking the two steps to get to the other couch and then just standing over Loki, his hands in his pocket. He looked down at him like someone might look down at a rat on the ground.
“Looking good, kiddo,” Dugan told him with the world’s smallest smile. A smile that Tony might have missed had he not been looking at him.
Tony pulled away while still smiling even though his heart was breaking. Steve would never want him. And why should he? Tony of all people? He wanted to laugh. Cry. Yell. But instead he smiled.
Tony couldn’t help but look at the hand on his shoulder and think to himself,
“How do you learn to manage it?” Tony asked, needing a lot more information. Or rather yet, a solution. Something he could do immediately. Get it over and done with. Tony turned to Steve to look at him and shook his head. “
“Hello,” the doctor said as he came out and it felt as if everyone stopped breathing, waiting nervously for the news. “Lieutenant Rhodes, amazingly, is fine. A little smoke inhalation damage to his throat but otherwise, right as rain. Captain Rogers,” he continued, pausing to look at his chart.
“I might, yes. Apparently, we get a curtain for privacy. Some kisses might be in order as well if we encounter turbulence,” James said innocently.
“I’ll leave the curtains open while you nap.” He nodded, closing his eyes and already drifting off to sleep.
, had been what Tony replied to that for the past few days but he found it didn’t really work at all. So he moved half the office to the hospital room, which Sarah didn’t like either, but between Sarah and Steve and his own boredom, Tony chose what would make the majority of them somewhat happy.
So James was at his office now, trying to busy himself with any other last minute paperwork before their trip in a few days. Steve and Tony should have arrived in Ireland by now. He wondered how they were doing and hoped it was a positive answer.
“Did you sleep much?”
The next morning at breakfast Sarah let Tony know that Steve had given Falsworth some work for him to do at the office if he wanted. She explained that Steve had left early that morning around five and wouldn’t be at the office today.
Dmitri stayed downstairs in the living room doing a crossword while the bosses were upstairs.
“Is Winter with him? My boss wants to know.” He didn’t—well he didn’t specifically ask Dugan to find this out—but that usually did the trick when he needed information.
me from having two slices,” Tony countered.
“I know, pet. Now you’re part of our family. This is not something I would have suggested if it hadn’t been the case already.” She rubbed his arm and kissed the side of his head.
“James?” He asked the man who was now standing behind Sarah. “Are Dugan and Jones awake?”
,” he pleaded, pushing himself up to start compressions. Thirty seconds later and Steve gasped, more blood dripping out of his mouth but at least he was awake again. “Steve, please,” James begged. “I can’t lose you. For so many reasons, I can’t.”
“Pepper, we’re gonna make a delivery today around noon,” Tony told her and started cutting the bread, holding it with the injured hand and using the bread knife in his left. He wasn’t used to cutting with his left hand and it ended up injuring his right hand even further but that didn’t matter.
James turned around and tucked in his shirt, grabbing a tie. His expression was its usual blank default and he nodded in agreement with Steve’s last statement and then he smiled.
After they had placed their orders and she had gone, Tony lowered his menu and waited patiently for Steve’s response.
She walked outside and was immediately greeted by Dugan who opened the car door for her.
“Whipped cream,” Clint said at the same time that James answered, tasting Tony’s food, “Vanilla sauce.” They turned to look at each other but didn’t get to start bickering playfully because they were interrupted.
Steve listened, his hand moving high up on Tony’s thigh, squeezing. Tony had put on weight since living with Steve but even still, he could almost get his hand around his thigh and there was something about that that really got to Steve.
Benni agreed to stay and yawned in the middle of his sentence which made Steve chuckle. When Benni sent a look his way for laughing, Steve pretended like he was coughing and took another cookie.
Steve pushed his chair back and pulled Tony over to sit in his lap and he hugged him, burying his face against Tony’s upper arm. “I ever tell you how good you look in a suit?”
“Yes, Cap?”
vacation?” Tony did his best to sound convincingly offended.
“I’ll do what I damn well please but thanks a bunch for the update,” James said coldly, flipping through a book. There were no guards at Steve’s door, he’d sent them away, knowing what kinds of things were likely to come from Steve’s mouth and he wouldn’t be letting anyone hear that. Steve’s private life was just that—private.
Steve went upstairs with James to his bedroom while the other man got changed for their evening out. He sat on the end of his bed, sipping the drink Dmitri had made for him. They wouldn’t leave until Dugan was back to accompany them.
“Not gonna leave him alone again,” Tony mumbled. It was actually amusing to watch stern James check on Steve while Steve was grinning and not taking it seriously. It was better than having a sad and broken Steve even if it was only the drugs. “Do you want me to get a nurse or a doctor?”
“Not a wink.” James nodded at Steve’s bruised knuckles. “What did that poor sandbag ever do to you?”
When the men left and the door was locked again, Tony dared to move again. His face was throbbing. There was the all too familiar taste of blood on his tongue. With that came the memories and flashbacks that made everything even worse.
“Rhodey! James! Rhodes!” Tony called the next morning. Steve had left around midnight and Tony was pleasantly surprised to find that Rhodey still wasn’t home. Good, he needed a win on the dating front.
“It’s because I care that I’m telling you one more time to come downstairs and eat with us.” He nodded and got up. She took his hand and he let her, leading him down to the table where he saw Benni only waiting patiently, staring at the cooked duck in front of him sending a heavenly smell his way.
Clint laughed. “You’ll get used to them. She’s scary but just as soft. Softer actually. You should see her around her girlfriend. She turns into a pile of mush,” he said fondly, missing Natalia. He hadn’t seen her in a couple days. “Alright, I’ll give him some time and no, but I’d assume it’s about their, uh, prisoner.”
,” he said, incredibly impressed. “That’s
they did it and not just ‘tell me about the scary stories’ like most people asked—and this story was the quintessential firefighter tale: he saved a cat from a tree.
“I feel good.” James extended a hand and Steve looked at it, considering slapping it away and hugging him but he chose instead to respect what he was offered and he shook James’ hand. “Thank you.”
Hearing Tony’s voice rise so suddenly, Steve sat up and pulled him into his arms. It took a try first but he got him over and held him, pressing kisses into his hair. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Okay. You’ll be here with me.” He pressed another kiss to his hair. He knew it was a long shot but he wanted to at least try. Like before, having Tony somewhere Steve knew was safe would give him peace of mind but if it only made Tony’s anxiety greater, it was out of the question.
“You coming to dinner?” Clint called out to Dmitri.
When it was time for Tony to get up and bring the deliveries inside, Howard came up the stairs. Tony quickly rushed back to bed, covering Benni’s mouth when the boy woke up and gesturing for him to be silent. His father came into the room and Tony hid his brother’s body from sight. Howard huffed and left the room, leaving Tony to wonder if he hadn’t noticed or if he finally stopped caring.
, Steve wanted to say but kept that to himself as well. He finished one half of his sandwich and sat back, one hand resting on his chin, the other across his chest, and his eyes focused on Tony. He finally removed his hat and set it on the table away from their food and drinks. “How old are you?”
“Well then, find someplace you like and take me there. I’m free again this Friday, if that works for you.”
“You saying that because it was my idea, Jimmy?” Sarah said, coming around the corner with a box of muffins she had baked. They were Clint’s favorite, lemon poppyseed.
“Where—do you know what room we would be in?”
“Yeah, that’s what they call Steve. Did you know he fought in the war?” He imitated guns. “They told me stories about his plans!”
The week after the two usual men came to pick-up the money like they did every two weeks, only this time it was Tony who had to pay them while Howard was taking a nap in the back office. Unsure of how Howard usually treated them he gave each a sandwich and then tended to the customers who came in.
“Like this,” he breathed against his collar, nipping lightly.
“What are you waiting for?” he asked instead, unwilling to ruin the moment. It was finally just them together and both on the same page with their feelings and plans.
Steve gets a letter. Tony tells Benni. Steve tells Sarah.
He shrugged out of his jacket and shoes and into comfortable slippers, unbuttoning his waistcoat and rolling up his shirt sleeves. He found Tony in the living room with Benni and Sarah and he leaned against the entrance with a smile, just watching his family.
Tony couldn’t remember much after that. The next thing he knew he was getting changed in his and Steve’s bedroom. He was alone but he knew where he was. One glance at the bedside table and the clock there told him that dinner would be served soon.
“You still not planning on telling then?”
He’d already asked Phil about taking on the role of manager while Clint was away. He had prepared a whole speech and everything, ready to offer Phil a large raise in return for his work but Phil shut him down before he could even get to talk of payment.
“Were you always fine with it?”
“Hi there,” Tony greeted him with a cheeky grin. He knew he would find Steve there. “You should’ve helped your mother rather than waiting for me in the dark hallway.”
“I actually prefer spring and autumn. Winter’s a definite no—it’s just too cold here for anyone’s good—and summer, well… this Irish skin,” he said, lifting his forearms, his shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows, “does not do well in the sunlight.” He chuckled. “I don’t tan, I just burn. What about you?”
“Course I do, Rhodey-boo,” he said and then recited the schedule off by heart much to Rhodey’s apparent surprise. “See? I’ve been listening and also noticing,” he told him, stabbing his fork at him and then down into the tortellini on his plate. “I just thought the ranks might change things up.”
That was Clint’s voice.
“As for the gun, let’s start tomorrow with the actual shooting. You sure your arm is up for it?” Steve asked, looking him over.
Clint breathed a quiet laugh. “For what?”
She tilted her head up to look at him, her green eyes sad and her expression almost innocent with the amount of vulnerability she was allowing. “You’ll come back?”
“No, no you can’t and I won’t let you.” Tony got up and took the can with him to dump the contents. Seeing Steve laugh as wholeheartedly as he did was simply beautiful. Tony would love to give him all the reasons to make him laugh like that all the time. For now his priority was proper joe. Falsworth was grumbling under his breath but Tony didn’t pay any attention to it while he inspected the coffee machine. “First of all, when did you last clean this? It looks disgusting. And that’s not nearly enough coffee in there.” With only one good hand he couldn’t do much so he ordered Falsworth around, telling him what to do. While he did so his Italian accent came through a lot more as it usually did when he was getting worked up.
, what are you doing? I don’t have any money,” Tony whispered, not liking this one bit.
“I’ll just go grab it,” he said and turned to get it before either of the men could go with him. It was on another aisle and they had just spent half an hour inside the same store without anything happening which meant it was safe and that meant Tony could quickly grab the canned fruit they would need and be back in a minute. Or so he thought.
he whispered softly, squeezing his brother. “
. But using
“My home is not public knowledge for safety reasons,” he explained to Tony, now just the two of them. They walked the long corridor and came into another basement. This one was more of a gameroom complete with a pool table, dart boards, comfortable-looking couches and a shelf with books and board games. There was a chess table in the other corner that looked well-used. It was Steve’s favorite game.
The man sighed and squinted up at Steve, digging through his jacket pockets until he found his sunglasses and slipped them on. “That’s so much better. I’m so hungover,” he whined, looking around. “Nice place.”
“They did not specify either.” Dugan hummed.
Tony had also given Douggie McLaughlin a sure yes. Steve had only given Seàn Murphy a pass and everyone else to the trash. The first three that Tony got rid of Steve completely agreed, they were too young and didn’t look like they could hurt a butterfly if it had a knife. The middle one couldn’t be trusted. Douggie, well… Steve had grown up with him in the neighborhood. He was a year younger but he’d always been a bully. A real asshat. He’d beat someone black and blue just for looking at him funny. He was an Irish Howard so
“I understand all those words separately but not worrying about Tony as a complete concept?” Rhodey shook his head and laughed. “He’s a work-in-progress.”
Steve ate a couple bites while Sarah asked Benni about his school day and what he’d learned and what he hadn’t understood so well. She normally made a point of going over the things he didn’t understand with him so he never fell back in class. She’d done the same with Steve.
Maria was still looking around the room, her lips parted slightly as Natalia sat on the couch where Clint normally lounged when he spent the day at James’ office.
“Where’s Clint? Is he okay?”
“We’ll find ‘em. You know we will,” Steve said with a certainty James couldn’t quite muster up at that moment. There was no doubt in Steve’s mind that he would get Tony back one way or another. That simply wasn’t an option for him. Having Tony in his future was just a given.
“What’s on your mind, pet?”
Natalia shook her head, brushing a ginger curl away from her face.
Benni gasped, excited. “Natalia! Can she visit soon?”
He laughed and shook his head, quickly wiping his eyes. “I’m sorry. It’s just…” He trailed off and shrugged. It’s just what? That he couldn’t quite handle the thought of not getting out of there? Of dying sickly thin, bruised, filthy and in torn clothes?
“Yeah, Sarah doesn’t know.” Tony smiled and kissed his cheek softly. “You’re not ungrateful, I get that you’re bored. I’m just at a loss here, okay?”
“He’s fine. Malnourished and dehydrated, like you, a few bruises and a fractured rib too but otherwise fine.”
“I can’t believe you made me do all of that on a full stomach,” Tony said, his eyes closed and head resting on Steve’s chest. His fingers were trailing up and down the side of Steve’s torso, his skin so soft and warm.
Around noon he arrived at the address that he was given. Two men were standing outside the bar in front of the door, having a smoke and at first Tony didn’t think they had anything to do with where he was going. That was until he reached the door and they stood right in front of him, making him flinch at the sudden movement.
“Put whatever covers the bottle into the register and what’s left, take for yourself. Clint told me you had a baby girl not too long ago,” James said, pressing a roll of cash into Phil’s hand that he removed from his jacket pocket. Even though, when he thought about it, it made no sense—because Clint’s finances were covered by James and that included the bar—something in him felt wrong about taking without paying. Maybe it was just because it was Clint’s.
Once a year every year on the first Monday of the last week of March, all the mob heads met to discuss territory, product, and price. Normally it was the head and their next in charge, which meant Steve and Dugan. Steve, being head of the second largest mob in all of New York, sat nearest the head of the table normally. With James away and not seeming to be coming back even for this meeting, Steve looked to the empty seat at the head of the table where the most feared man in the North East normally sat.
“Welcome home, both of you. How did it go?” Tony asked them, raising his cup of coffee to his lips with his free hand.
“I love you,” Clint breathed, his forehead pressed against James’, their breath mingling from the closeness. He felt James sigh, it gently swept across his face.
James listed off the number and Steve made a note of it on a separate piece of paper so he wouldn’t accidentally forget and hand Tony the number with the jewelers’ information.
“Thank you,” Steve said, standing outside the room now as a few of James’ men wheeled in a gurney to take the body to the morgue and schedule it for cremation.
Steve reached over with his good hand and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, feeling the moment when he woke. He lifted his head and his eyes were red-rimmed and sad and Steve
Steve hummed happily at the kisses and Tony’s words about Benni. He didn’t often think of himself as someone anyone would look up to, so that was nice.
Tony would drop by the firehouse on the way to work in the mornings and bring baked goods or just hang out in Steve’s office or the communal area with everyone else. Steve used every opportunity for a refuel to spend whatever minutes he had in Tony’s garage. He had even gotten to know Pepper and Bruce quite well. Reed was still an unknown but Tony assured him it was better that way.
Dmitri came back in, his eyes going to Jones for a moment where he could see his shoulders shaking and then back to Tony, “Steve’s waking up. Go now and you’ll be there before he opens his eyes,” he told him, moving to point at Dugan’s untouched bread roll. “Eat.”
Steve laughed outright, dropping a shell in the pan and having to dig it out. “After ‘you need sleep’ and ‘you work too much’ that’s probably the third most common thing ma reminds me of.” And he did forget often. He and James both. They felt like older men, perhaps in their fifties when in reality there was a reason why Sarah called them her ‘boys’, though he doubted she’d ever stop that.
“Nothing to say you’re sorry about,” Steve told him, standing. He checked his pocket watch and sighed internally. He was not ready to leave Tony’s bedside but he figured if he was tired it would be alright to go now.
“I have eaten but I will eat again and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop me,” Dugan said, patting his stomach. Steve chuckled.
Steve moved all the way back and told Tony to put the gun down and turn around to face him. When he did, Steve held up his hands, palms facing Tony, and fingers straight.
or touch his hand gently. While Tony watched his little-but-not-so-little brother he realized how much he looked like their mother. How had he never seen that before?
“My bar?” Clint asked, looking at James for confirmation and he nodded. “Uh, thanks, Steve.” Why did it feel weird to call him Steve? That was his name, right? Not Rogers. Well, that was too but Clint shouldn’t be using last names. It was too formal for what their setting should be.
On the far end underneath the windows was a big wooden desk and behind that a record player and a stand full of records.
“June 10th,” Steve answered, slicing bread fresh from the bakery. He wasn’t sure when she’d brought it back but Sarah must’ve gone out and come back in. “Why?”
Steve looked up from his phone where he was checking the news and weather forecast, not having heard Bucky come in.
“And—wait, what?”
One hand resting in Steve’s big, strong hand, the other still holding on to Clint—this was ideal and put Tony at ease, the tension in his body falling away. He heard Benni coming down the stairs, practicing Irish with Sarah. He was absolutely delighted to see everyone in the same room. Sarah gently pulled him into the kitchen and Tony waved to his brother with the hand still in Steve’s.
Steve passed James’ door. It was shut. He stood outside it for a minute, hand raised to knock but he decided against it at the last minute. If James was finally sleeping, good for him.
Steve let out a breath. “A little of both.”
He leaned over and rested a hand firmly on the back of Tony’s neck, guiding him closer until Steve could kiss him. He tasted like coffee and Steve found himself sighing into it. He hadn’t been taking the time to truly appreciate kissing Tony lately. His other hand rested on Tony’s leg, squeezing gently until he finally broke the kiss, pressing one more light peck to his slightly swollen lips.
It was almost an hour later that Steve rolled away from Tony, breathless, exhausted, sore and his wounds just a little achy.
“He’s a good kid. Bad situation.”
Tony rested his hands on top of Steve’s, looking into those blue eyes of his. “I see,” he said and kissed the tip of Steve’s nose. “He’ll tell you sooner or later. Or did you do something he might think was dramatic?”
“I have just the room for you, my friend,” he said with a grin, his grey eyes bright and mischievous. He led Steve to the back to what he called his own private section of the brothel. It was even cleaner and luxurious. He opened the second door and told Steve to wait.
to know everything about the holiday, I’ll tell you,” he said tiredly. He wanted it to be a surprise, he wanted to get to experience firsthand Tony’s excitement in the moment, and he wished he didn’t have such an adverse reaction to change and surprises but if it was only going to stress him out, then it wouldn’t be fun for either of them.
It was three days later that Steve was caught off guard again. In the gym, he was heading for the door to his home when someone came out of one of the dark corners. He didn’t recognize the face, some youngster again, no older than twenty.
Tony gasped and almost dropped his phone as Steve went back to the kitchen and poured both of them a mug of coffee. He brought it back for Tony and sat it on the table in front of him.
“Dancing?” He asked surprised. “I never learned how to dance. Pepper took me to a dance once but I refused to ask anyone to dance.” How often did he have to say that word? It was embarrassing.
Tony held onto Clint’s hand and shook his head. “I forgot you couldn’t hear my voice. It’s nice to meet you properly.” He shook Clint’s hand, suddenly feeling weird with all the people around them. “Well, not really because you still need a shave.”
“Are you sure it wasn’t a lie?” Jones, who had stayed behind at the house, asked.
” he finished in Russian. James pardoned himself and… was that a smile on his face? Sarah would find out more later.
Steve lifted up the copy of Alice in Wonderland and shook it. “I’ll read. Thanks for bringing this.” He opened it to his bookmark and started reading.
James was leaning outside the door nibbling on a piece of gingerbread one of the babushkas near him had given him. You see, James’ home
“What is it?”
“He doesn’t even know your name, Steve. Or who Sarah is. What else does he not know? Does he know you're blond?”
” Tony panted.
Sarah had given Tony the extra set of keys in case of emergency. If this didn’t count as an emergency, Tony didn’t know what would. He took the keys and left the house, nearly jumping when a man stood right in front of him. It was one of the men James had introduced earlier.
Steve looked confused. “But I told you I’d come.” He sipped the hot coffee now put down in front of him. It was as delicious as he remembered it. “We’re taking some of this with us,” he told Dugan and Jones. “It’s much better than that piss water Falsworth makes.” Both men chuckled.
“As I recall, you were dating Maria
“Oh, love” she said, moving to hug him.
He stood and made his way downstairs, grabbing an apple as he passed, and going into the basement and through the passageway. Somedays he truly valued the protection afforded him by keeping his home a secret. Other days, he wished he could walk out as freely as his mother did.
She removed the cast, brought in nurses to clean his leg and then she inspected it further, checking for any painful points or visible irregularities. When she found none, she ordered a final x-ray which she explained wasn’t standard procedure but ‘only the most thorough check-ups for my best patient.’ Clint knew she likely meant she was thorough so James wouldn’t have her fired from his hospital but he smiled at her all the same.
“Ready?”
“What is this I’m eating?” He asked after taking a bite. Sarah explained it to him and he nodded. He wanted to tell Steve about Pepper. Why? That he didn’t know. He just wanted to talk to him.
Steve growled. “I won’t ask again.”
Clint nodded. That was the name he remembered and it made him feel better about the guy sitting beside him.
Steve turned and unlocked the basement door, walking through with Tony.
Moments later Steve was back in his bed and James checked for blood on the bandages while Steve grinned.
“Tony already picked up on it.”
He heated the milk up on the stove—it was quieter than using the microwave—and poured himself a glass, washing the pot out quietly and leaving it to dry. He considered staying in the kitchen but wanted somewhere more comfortable so he ventured out towards the living room.
“Was that supposed to be me?”
Tony flinched violently but braced himself for whatever was going to happen. When nothing did, he turned around slowly to see Clint standing there.
Steve felt the change in Tony’s movements, his hand moved to his knee and he turned to him, trying to sober up his mind so he could more easily figure out the problem. He raised an eyebrow as if to say, ‘all good?’
offended that it apparently never even occurred to you to tell me you work at the hot guy factory,” Tony said, pushing his vegetables to the side of his plate and focusing on the pasta in the middle.
“But thank you for coming to check on me. I appreciate it.” He kissed his forehead again.
possible caring for.” He kept his hand on his knee since Tony didn’t oppose it being there and Mary handed him what he needed. He looked up at Tony with a raised eyebrow, a silent question of ‘may I?’
. So James knew it was only a matter of time before Clint felt he could no longer let what happened keep him from his bar. James
Tony kept the letter hidden with the money under the bed. Not even his brother knew about the box there and he would keep it that way until it was finally time to go far away from there. That thought was the only thing keeping him going. The threat against Howard also helped to deal with the mood swings, yelling, and beatings. Even though things had gotten worse since his last delivery, Tony could handle it.
Clint shrugged. “I dunno. Hadn’t thought to interrogate him about that. Besides, he now refuses to tell me anything else. I don’t even know which house. Or if there’s more I don’t know about.” He threw his arms up in exasperation, plopping back down onto the counter and propping his head up on his hands.
Clint blushed again, hearing aids in, as James repeated himself. “It’s just that… I’m not what you signed up for. Not right now. It's true, you can’t deny that.”
“Don’t play stupid, Rogers, although with you it may not be playing,” Bakuto said and Steve had to walk away from the phone to keep himself from throwing it at a wall. That certainly wouldn’t help get Tony and Clint back. “Everyone knows information is power. Especially in the times we’re living in. ‘Loose lips sink ships’ and all that.”
The drive back was fun. They were loud and more than a little tipsy from all the alcohol, though they had kept up appearances of perfect sobriety until Dmitri closed the door and pulled away from the restaurant. As soon as they had turned the corner, the first round of laughter happened. They weren’t even sure why.
“I don’t think I tell you often enough how nice it is to see you happy with her, you know,” Clint told her, lowering his voice a little.
“No,” he said immediately, “Steve and I don’t do business the same way.” What he really meant was
Tony sipped his water slowly, holding onto Steve’s hand. He told him about his rather uneventful afternoon but he kept finding something to talk about. At one point he even talked about the chapter Benni and he read. All he did was wait until Steve gave him a sign that it was enough or that he wanted something else. For him, Tony would always find something to say.
“Mm-hmm?”
“Should still be having lunch with Jones and Falsworth.” They’d taken Tony out with them seeing as Steve wanted him to be able to be productive without getting caught up in Steve’s bad mood.
“Don’t wake up,” he whispered softly. “I’m just going to get rid of your shirt or you’ll be uncomfortable and kick me during the night. No one wants that.” Slowly he pushed the shirt up, got one arm out of it and then the other. The only problem was that thick head of his. And even though it was just a joke Tony had told himself, he chuckled. Steve would sigh and give him one of his signature looks if he ever told him.
Tony tried to remember the last time he had seen Steve. Was it when Steve went to the office after breakfast? No. Just before Sarah and Tony headed out to order food for Thanksgiving, he made sure to stop by, kiss Steve on the cheek while he was talking on the phone, and scribble an ‘I love you’ on a blank page in Steve’s private notebook.
“Because any earlier and I won’t have calmed down enough to not stab you,” James warned him and Steve decided not to poke at his angry friend any longer. Sure James was withholding seemingly important information but Steve had overstepped by going after Clint.
“I haven’t given it that much thought, to be honest. First, I had to heal and then I started working for you. And now I simply take one day after the other.” He looked down to Steve’s hand on the pillow. He was sure it would be more comfortable where Tony’s hands were. “I’m open to suggestions.”
“Why wouldn’t I want to stick around?” He asked, confused. “I love it here.” It was the best thing that ever happened to him and as long as Steve wanted him around, Tony would stay with his brother.
“Two to the left, one to the right,” Steve said later that night, pulling his head back around to be hidden from view.
“Yeah, I didn’t think it would happen overnight and I’d picked up that me seeing James wasn’t his favorite thing in the world.” He sighed deeply, still picking at the roll but not eating it. Right now he even missed the way James got annoyed when he drank straight from the milk bottle. “Never thought a mob boss would be the person I get butterflies over. Not complaining, just didn’t see it coming.”
“You okay?” he asked after a moment, unable to stop himself from asking. Tony looked so young and evil spy or not, he had taken a beating.
Steve looked out the window. They were almost to Pinky’s home.
“I do,” Steve said. He remembered thinking the same thing when he got back from fighting. He knew exactly what Tony meant. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead and patted his chest softly. “Get some sleep, love. I’ll be right here.”
“No, thank
“You got ‘em all pretty well. What about me?” Benni scrunched up his nose and grabbed a white crayon and held it up to compare to Steve’s skin and he laughed. A real laugh, one that made his eyes go small and he tilted back his head.
“Good thing you hired him as your accountant because your math skills are severely lacking. He’s got at least four reasons—you, Sarah, a home, a job—or five, if I may be so bold and assume he has any thoughts towards me other than ‘scary’.”
Steve registered the movement, about to protest Tony leaving. He thought he was leaving because of Steve being there but then he felt a warm, gentle hand in his hair and he sighed happily, a sleepy smile on his face. “Thas luv’ly,” he barely managed, sleep threatening to win out. How he didn’t want to sleep! He wanted to keep talking to Tony. Tony who was right there! Tony who was playing with his hair! And… and…
“No, we would stay here. You and me. For a while. If that’s something you both would want,” James clarified, his gaze focused on Clint, watching for any subtle nuances in his expression.
“If you really
It was logical to Tony that he fell in love with Steve and that they were together now. Even the thought that they would grow old together didn’t seem illogical since he didn’t expect anything else for his life. Knowing how his brain seemed to work differently from the others around him, he simply felt the need to make sure it was okay to feel this way.
The way his lips twitched, the way his eyes seemed to grow colder, the way his jaw clenched sometimes. And then other times when he looked at Tony for just a second and their eyes met.
“Me too. You know, I gotta thank you.”
“It’s okay, I get what you mean. Thank you,” Clint said, squeezing Tony’s hand one last time and then standing and going back to his mattress. “Goodnight, Tony.”
Was this it? They were tired of waiting and that’s why they were going to kill him?
I’m alright, I promise.” He pressed another kiss on his brother’s forehead. “I’m sorry you can’t come with us this time but I promise we’ll go on a proper vacation.”
“No. I like being needed. I like helping. Gives me purpose.” He sat up a little more so he could look at James properly. “Maybe, since you can’t seem to agree that you’ve improved my life in so many ways already, it’s still to come. Maybe it’ll happen next week. Next month. When we finally go to France.
“Yes, ma’am,” James and Steve said at the same time. James disappeared to remove his jacket, tie and waistcoat, coming back in a light grey shirt that made his eyes even more intense. He moved to help Steve set the table.
you.” He moved closer, taking Tony’s hand with both of his now. “You’re strong and you’re loyal and you’re smart. And despite me deserving no less, you didn’t treat me like some heartless, bloodthirsty person. You were respectful but not fearful, kind not superficial, and you were concerned
“No.” He smiled and nuzzled back against him. “You’re a good leader.” It was true. Tony had no idea what he was doing. Following Steve’s lead was easy though.
Honestly, Clint had been expecting Sarah. With Steve and Tony gone, her house was much emptier and she kept finding herself cooking more than she and Benni could eat before it spoiled, so lately she’d visited more often. At times just to say hello and let Benni see Lucky or to drop off food but this was a surprise.
Tony wanted to answer but decided against it because he didn’t want to discuss it right now. He just wanted to get to Steve. “I hope you’ll enjoy it. It’s been a minute.” He hung her coat up and headed to the basement to find Steve.
“Like screaming,” James said with a smile, stabbing the blade into a new, more sensitive spot.
James smiled. “Soon. They’re some amazing people.”
“Be civil, you two. Fightin’s fine but I draw the line at wasting my cookin’,” Sarah warned them. Not another piece of food was used as a weapon that night.
“That’s what I want to hear.”
“Yes. He’s the only person that doesn’t live or work with us who knows about Clint and I.”
“So you’ve really been able to sing this entire time and this is the first time I hear it?” James asked, watching a happy smile spread across Clint’s face. James plopped back down onto his chest, tapping his arm. “Sing, sing,” he demanded.
Tony leaned against him. “It has now. You know I get disoriented when I wake up.” His hands were throbbing and he knew it would continue for a while until it healed. “Could I open the curtains to let some light in during the night?”
Once outside the hospital Tony didn’t get in the car immediately but stayed outside in the cold and breathed in the fresh air with his eyes closed. Sarah waited patiently for him to get in and didn’t ask him was he was doing and he was grateful for it.
“Never made a coffee drink. Always up for a challenge,” Clint told him, his stomach growling at the mere mention of food. He ate another piece of his stale bread roll and let out another sigh, dragging a hand down his face.
“Where was he shot? How bad?” Tony couldn’t say who it was that asked questions at a time like this.
Steve cleared his throat and moved on. “I didn’t.” Or did he? He couldn’t remember right then. “Clint tell you about it?”
Sam, being without Steve or Bucky, was beside Tony, their shoulders touching but neither of them saying a word. Both were just staring at the doors the doctors had taken the men through, silent and anxious.
“James…
Now that he was in a comfortable position in life and had the money to splurge on a special occasion like a wedding, why wouldn’t he? Who was going to stop him? His supportive fella, who was now coming downstairs with his empty dishes in hand? His equally supportive mother who wanted to do even more for this girl, who reminded her too much of herself?
,” he said with more force than he intended. “So,
Tony put the potato down, his appetite gone. Nothing was the same without him. Tony would gladly not eat, sleep, or shower and he would endure it all, if he could only be with Steve.
At the sound of the doorbell, which Steve only assumed was rang out of respect for their privacy and not because James forgot his key, Steve closed his sketchbook, reaching down to card his fingers through Tony’s hair.
And now as the phone rang a third time, he felt his pulse race and he had to swallow a few times before his throat felt clear. His free hand clenched into a fist, only relaxing again when the receiver was finally picked up and he could hear the sounds of the bar in the background.
“No,” Steve said firmly, placing his hand on top of Tony’s. “No, you’re still on holiday from work. Boss’ orders. Dugan and Jones have got it.” He leaned forward and kissed him, running his fingers through his hair and away from his forehead. “I hope you’ll like it.”
, who was mean to you?” he asked sweetly, one hand on Steve’s thigh and the other in his hair. This was normal too. Being able to touch Steve, call him sweet nicknames, and kiss him. It was his favorite part of his new-normal.
been with Clint from the start. He’d been understanding with Clint even when it put himself in a negative light, like when Clint was afraid to stay the night at his house during the snowstorm. James hadn’t been happy about Clint’s presumptions about him, obviously, but he hadn’t been angry with Clint either.
,” he replied softly. “Steve?” He asked and continued after a moment. “If there’s anything I can do to help you with your work, you’ll let me know, right?”
James snorted, very unimpressed. “All of it? Alright, sure. What’s next? Think I should tell him to leave me too?”
It was another huge, open space with one large photograph on the wall of Sarah and Steve when he was much younger—perhaps in his teens, thin but grinning—and otherwise lots and lots of rural landscape paintings all chosen by Sarah who loved them because they reminded her of home.
Steve tilted his head to the side in mild confusion, not sure where James was going with this. He opened his mouth to ask but James continued.
“Falsworth leave, Tony can explain these to me on his own. I’ll send him down later.” Falsworth did as he was told, more than sensing Steve’s bad mood, and closed the door behind him.
“They don’t work together but they have been friends since they were wee babbies and remained that way.” She rolled up her sleeves and started washing the dishes and handed them to Tony slowly for him to dry and stack next to him on a clean towel. “James is head of the Russian mob,” Sarah said casually and Tony almost dropped the plate she gave him.
“That’s lovely. Let’s eat together? Steve is running late for some business.” He took the envelope and offered his arm to Sarah.
“He’s so soft!” he exclaimed and sat down on the floor.
“He’s a great nap buddy. Just a little bit better than you, I would say,” Clint told Tony with a smile, looking up when he noticed movement to see James and Steve coming into the room. James was wearing the sweater Clint bought him. “Hey, sweetheart, lookin’ good.”
,” James said in a quiet sort of awe after swallowing a mouthful. Steve was on his fifth mouthful, not even bothering to speak until his plate was clean and he was going for seconds. Steve stood and James held his plate out for him to refill it as well. “Such a well-behaved young man you’ve raised,” he told Sarah with a teasing look.
“Good morning,” James told him, smiling and then pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“Dammit, James.
The next day was the same. Steve left at an ungodly hour and returned at one, seeing no one but his mother and sometimes just leaving her a note.
Clint nodded, listening. “So why identify as Jewish at all?”
“Looks delicious,” he said, in a ‘what do I care’ kind of tone. He got up, took his own plate and left.
“That depends on a lot of factors.” Tony decided to stay as vague as he could but still answer the questions he was asked. “My mom used to run the deli, he did the heavy lifting. Now it's mostly me and Pepper.”
The documents also contained details of partnerships he had with individuals he was less friendly with like Reed Richards, Matt Murdock (his lawyer), and Scott Lang (a man James knew could get anything he needed and wouldn’t ask any questions) and many others. James didn’t go into too much detail with each of them because Dmitri had met them all and knew what they all did for James but he didn’t always know
He liked Tony. A lot. But he still couldn’t help but wonder if this date hadn’t been just the slightest bit boring.
“I don’t think he can stand Howard,” Tony stated. Knowing that a man in his position had even noticed these kind of things when others didn’t even notice a bandage. He noticed that Tony wasn’t using his good hand and asked. He even remembered the thing with his wrist. Sometimes Tony himself forgot about his most recent injuries until something happened and the pain reminded him. Pepper started clearing the tables and Tony went back to the kitchen to do the dishes, all the while thinking of Mr Rogers.
He picked up the rest of his food and slowly ate it, thinking about all the things he wanted to do when he was back with James. First and foremost, leave the city behind for a while and go to that house in the countryside in France.
that?
Only moments after he started reading the second chapter of this new book, Tony noticed that Benni was fast asleep already. He shifted the little body so he would be more comfortable and rested a hand over his stomach while watching him sleep for a while. Even in his sleep his little brother was now smiling and it was truly the best thing Tony had ever seen.
“Sorry. I said I’m sick of feeling cold. It’s always toasty warm in Steve’s, well, in
!” he whined, sounding much weaker than he intended to. “Save some for later,” he whispered, raising Steve’s hand to kiss his palm. “Whipped cream or vanilla sauce?”
happened to him, it was all James’ fault. It was James’ fault anyway for dragging him into his ridiculous lifestyle but this? This James should have dealt with better. He had to find him.
Dmitri laughed. “Anytime,
he said quickly in Russian, needing to speak to undo the tightness in his chest.
Steve met his eyes when Tony looked down and Steve moaned around him, making Tony almost convulse. He did it again and Tony’s fingers dug into the bedding. Steve was helping himself almost as much as he was Tony, unable to remember a time when he was this turned on.
said.”
He removed them and tossed them back into the corner. “If you‘d like, because it’ll help build your upper body strength for shooting, I can give you boxing lessons. If you’re more comfortable not hitting me,” he said, realizing this might be something Tony wouldn’t want to do with Steve, “Falsworth used to be a trainer.”
Steve rounded the corner into the living room first to find Tony waking up at the sound, his head on Clint’s shoulder and their hands still intertwined. Clint was still asleep, his head tilted back and a soft snore coming from him.
“Say that again?”
“No harm done,” he managed to say and nodded.
“It’s good to see you, ma.”
“This is different. It feels different from… what happened before.” Tony barely managed to say the words out loud. It wasn’t like he didn’t know that being with Steve was going to involve a lot of worrying. “Are we… are we going to be okay?”
“No way.” Steve nodded. “Oh my god. That’s so great! That’s—
Steve chewed his lip. “He was
“Sounds nice. Really worked up an appetite,” Steve said and then, as if on cue, his stomach growled and he chuckled softly, running his hand through Tony’s hair as he spoke. “And yes, business is all done. Dammit. I forgot the strawberries. Do you still need them?” He had been so excited about finding the perfect ring that strawberries had been completely knocked off the to-do list.
He looked over at James who was carefully inspecting a fourth watch.
“Thank you,” he said and smiled at Dugan. “I’ll be back later. Oh and Dmitri could you look after Benni maybe pick him up?”
“Tea, please,” James said as they headed for the door.
Plus he knew Clint already wore a wedding ring—partly for his public appearance and partly because Natalia still wore hers and it was more a friendship ring than anything else—so he wanted him to have something that was from James, just as James wore his dog tags every day.
As silently as possible he headed out of the bedroom and closed the door, spotting Steve waiting for him in the hallway.
“Don’t be an
Tony was shaky on his legs, unable to let go of the pieces until Sarah slowly unwrapped one finger after the other and got them out of his hand.
upper body.
There wasn’t a single thought left in Tony when Steve kissed him and wrapped his lips around him. He gasped and moaned, moving into the heat. All he could do was moan, his hands in Steve’s hair as he moaned his name. When he managed to open his eyes a little—curiosity winning as he wanted to see Steve—he felt even more overwhelmed by his feelings and the heat.
“Clint seems to bring him peace that nothing else has yet,” Sarah said, her eyes darting to her son who looked away.
Tony gently rested a hand on the back of Steve’s hand, his thumb rubbing over the bruised knuckles. “Still…” he mumbled. Steve was strong enough to take care of himself but Tony couldn’t help it. “You’re with me now. I worry about those I love.”
“But you weren’t! You told me to run! You told me to go!” Benni cried and punched his brother weakly. Normally it wouldn’t have hurt but Tony’s whole body was aching and so it did. Yes, he had told him that because he thought that, if he didn’t, Howard would not only kill Tony but also Benni and he wasn’t about to let that happen.
Clint wasn’t really a fan of the crime show, it sounded too much like his teenage years for his liking but he enjoyed the company. He didn’t smirk at Tony like he wanted to, not after seeing the way he responded to the wink, but he did softly knock his knee against Tony’s when he sat, giving him a grin and thanking him for the dessert.
Clint snorted softly, smiling down at his breakfast now and James could have done a song and dance number with how relieved he felt.
When he was somewhat cleaner and had eaten all he could manage of a meal, James turned to Clint and asked, “Do you still want to see him?” Clint nodded again. “Would you mind asking Steve if that’s alright?”
“Of course I did, love,” he said and then felt bad for lying to him. Honesty. Complete transparency. “It was nothing. Just an overeager eejit with a knife. I got to him before he got to me.”
He stayed where he was, not touching him. “Wanna talk? Doesn’t matter what about.”
is our home now. We’re not going back ever again.”
They enjoyed a companionable silence for about five minutes before James spoke again.
“It’ll be the one downside to having him here,” Steve said, pointing to James, “it’s easy to fall into work. Sorry, love.”
James waved his hand dismissively. “We’ve got nothing.”
“Who’re they?”
For the first time since he could remember, Steve felt shame and he dropped his eyes, no longer able to keep the contact. Yes, Howard was a monster and yes, he deserved what he got but that didn’t mean Tony wanted that for him. He and James had taken matters into their own hands and never even stopped to consider what Tony might’ve wanted. This was twice that Steve had done that to him.
Clint followed, linking their arms together and waiting for James and Maria. Maria came next and then James last. The valet had only offered unemotional greetings to the other three but when James stepped out, he startled, fixing his posture and tipping his hat.
“No, can we
“I think that would be a grand idea, though, maybe we should come to you. What with his leg and all. Would you be up for that? I’ll wheel you over,” Steve asked Tony.
. Your food is delicious. I eat a lot but in small portions.” That wasn’t entirely true but eating a little every now and then was easier for him than eating three big meals.
“Clint helped me. You’ve been doing so much lately, it’s the least I can do,” Tony replied to Sarah and kissed her cheek after setting the empty plate down in front of her. Together with Steve and Benni they finished quickly, then said grace, and Tony started serving the food.
“Smells like Sarah’s cooking,” Natalia observed.
“Cap, we—”
He moved to kiss Steve’s forehead in response. “Got some stuff done. Falsworth managed to make disgusting coffee even though he did everything I told him to do.” He tried to tell Steve something that would make him smile. “Done with the numbers for the week. That’s it…”
Tony turned and looked at the whole room again. That was him. All this was Steve and what meant most to him. And oddly enough, if anyone had asked Tony to describe his room, it would have been exactly this. Slowly he opened the curtains, letting in the soft winter light. With Steve’s name on his lips he turned around to wake him but upon seeing Steve lying there he froze.
And then he saw James who was also paler and even he looked worried. Sarah rushed to him and they hugged and talked. Tony
Phil did as he was told, moving swiftly over to the side of the desk where James sat and making a point of not making eye contact with Steve. Phil was not an easily scared man but if he thought too hard about being in a room alone with two of New York’s deadliest men, it didn’t do wonders for his nerves.
During their conversation—Steve and his mother—they’d finally got onto the subject of Tony and it was a long and brutal talk. It wasn’t all they talked about but it was enough that Steve had decided he was going to do what was best for everyone. Put his feelings for Tony aside. He and Benni needed looking after and love and affection in the familial way. Anything else was just another burden to add to their already heavy shoulders.
And that was only the tip of Bakuto’s monstrous iceberg. A part of James and Steve wanted it to be Bakuto because better the devil you know than the one you don’t but it didn’t make the confirmation any easier because they knew exactly the type of person who was holding their beloveds captive and the thought of either of them having even a single finger laid on them—
“Not a cop but, uh... I’m looking for Tony Stark.”
“Thank goodness,” he said quietly.
“It’s a shame that we won’t be able to sleep in the same bed. It wouldn’t be a problem if you weren’t built like a wardrobe,
“I know,” she said with a smug grin and then her expression grew more serious. “I’m glad I did too. Sure, Lucky’s going to miss you but what am
Dmitri and Dugan came over to look as well, all of them standing around the desk studying the map.
“No, I most certainly do not. And I never said you were using him, you inferred that.” James leaned against the counter, done with the dishes. He did not normally do them, he’d recently picked up the habit along with a few new friends.
He broke the kiss but rested his forehead against Tony’s, his eyes closed, breathing slowly, deeply. “I’m so happy to have you back.” He pressed their lips together once more and then told Tony to get some sleep.
James came to Steve’s home because Steve had said Tony had not been keen on leaving the house and Clint was starting to get cabin fever and was desperate for a change of scenery. James had a feeling he meant more than another neighborhood in Brooklyn but they would talk more about what that could be once Clint was feeling up to it.
“Abusive drunk.” When Steve raised his eyebrows, James continued. “One of my men lives not far from him. He has complained about the yelling. Stark told him in no uncertain terms to go fuck himself. Only reason he’s still alive is because I know he's on your payment route.” Steve snorted.
“Mmm, sounds delicious and that meal plan did wonders for my figure,” he joked, because if he didn’t laugh he might tear up. He stroked his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand, reluctant to let go although he knew he had to. “Yeah, see you soon. Get home safe, both of you.”
Uncertain of how much time had passed since Howard had once again lost his temper, Tony was crawling to his bedroom and simply laid on the floor, holding his aching stomach. Howard had stuffed the letter into his shirt and he slowly unwrapped the wrinkled up paper to read what it said.
“There you go.” He sat down next to Clint, shoulder to shoulder. “I missed you.”
“Thanks, Tony,” Clint said, hoping that
“That’s fair.”
Since that day Tony only ever took the dog tags off when he was taking a shower. More and more frequently he found himself fidgeting with the tags when he was deep in thought or trying to focus on something. It was his very own piece of Steve and that was what made it so incredibly special.
“James, it’s fine. I eat there all the time. Everyone knows I work for you. Sam knows. He’s seen us together at Clint’s bar. Besides, not
James’ hands came up to hold Clint, one hand fisted in his hair and the other pressing on his back between his shoulder blades to keep him close. The cigar fell to the balcony floor, forgotten.
“Howard was a wrongly made human but taking any life doesn’t leave you the same,” James commented. He remembered the first time he’d killed someone and it still haunted him in his dreams from time to time. No one seemed to have noticed, but Steve had a trick every time. He always killed them mid-sentence. If they weren’t talking he made them talk. Hearing them declare their wrongs and try to justify them made it easier somehow.
He took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself down. What the hell was he supposed to do now? He was so panicked and scared that he didn’t even notice the tray with water and food in the corner of his room. There was no way he would touch that as long as he didn’t know it was safe.
The most annoying part was that Clint couldn’t even explain to himself why he had such a hard time talking to James about it. He could talk to Tony about it because the shared trauma meant instant understanding, he could talk to Nat because, hell, he’d known her since they were teenagers, and not that he thought James
“You want me to whine how bad my life is?” He asked, his eyes still closed while the man tended to his wounds. Tony had stopped putting ice packs on any of his bruises or wounds long ago because he hated feeling cold. “I don’t know what your endgame is with me and, sir, with all due respect, I don’t care. I just want to go home and protect my brother. Because if I’m not there, Howard will hurt him and he’s just a boy. He can’t take any of this. So, whatever you want me to do, I
Dinner was ready not long after, the conversations and bickering making the time fly by. James and Steve fought the entire way into the kitchen. Steve kept finding reasons to bump into Tony however or brush their arms together, anything.
Clint watched him hesitate, watched him work through something in his head, and then he came further into the room and Clint flinched, cursing himself internally when Steve noticed that too.
“Tony Stark,” he said, reaching his hand up for Steve to shake, which he did. “Thanks for the coffee.” He took a sip and then wrinkled his nose because had he wanted brown water he would’ve drank New York tap water but he figured he should be a polite, uninvited guest.
“Nat, I’m really glad you came over.”
“None taken,” Tony said, tapping away on his phone, irritated that he didn’t have coffee anymore, even if Bucky had been right about the taste.
Clint watched him speak and nodded. “Yeah, thanks again.” He reached under the blanket and pulled out the bread roll. “Gross, I know, but want some?”
“—they’re together?”
Upstairs, Steve was passing by Clint and James’ room when he heard a sharp gasp and then,
“Yeah but if you like him why move on to someone else? Or am I missing something? Was there something you
of Tony, “in my quiet zone.”
“Yeah,” he chuckled. “He had a strict ‘no Lucky on the furniture’ rule and now he gets annoyed if Lucky doesn’t sit beside him when he’s on the couch.” He smiled even though it hurt to think about James and Lucky and Dmitri. He wondered how Natalia was doing. And Maria. Phil. So many people he wanted to see.
“Hello, love,” Steve said, sitting the briefcase down on the floor. He came over to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist from behind and press kisses to his neck. “Just had a nice chat with Benni. He told me he’s going to miss me.” Steve smiled into the next kiss he pressed onto Tony’s neck, still feeling warmed by Benni’s obvious affection for him.
“But Clint and I? His life was fine. He had friends, this bar, a safe home. There’s nothing I’ve done that he couldn’t have done for himself. The only thing I’ve done for Clint is put his life in danger,” James confessed, his voice tight from the effort it took to keep it from breaking.
“It’s alright. I was being annoying. You’ve been through a lot. I’m surprised you didn’t snap at me sooner.”
Steve stared intently into Tony’s eyes, so wide and honest. They made him feel warm, loved, and even though no, this wasn’t what his biggest worry was, he loved that Tony was so passionate about fixing it.
Tony woke up to Steve’s voice, which made it impossible to doubt where he was. Usually he always had at least a few seconds of panic upon waking. What if getting out of there had just been a dream?
At home, James led him upstairs and helped him change into warm, comfortable clothes. The fact that Clint didn’t swat him away or crack a joke about getting him naked worried James more than anything else. He simply lifted his arms when James pulled on his sweater and silently did as he was asked, his eyes focused on the floor. James carefully checked Clint’s cast and Clint didn’t even react when he gently moved his leg. Either that meant it really was almost healed or Clint had completely zoned out.
“Good to see ya,” Steve told him, clapping a hand on his back. He had been doing all the driving lately seeing as Dugan’s arm was still in a cast for another week.
“Mr Delmonico,” James greeted him with a cursory nod of his head, no smile, and that chilling gaze Clint knew only too well despite it never having been directed at him.
Steve chuckled, suddenly feeling too warm for his jacket and pressing more kisses to Tony’s neck. His hands traveled down Tony’s slender frame and fiddled with the fastening on his pants.
Steve startled, not expecting that. “Um, I, uh,” he began, stammering. Tony regretted putting him on the spot like that but only slightly. He really wanted an answer. “I mean, you’re very attractive, for one, and since you are Rhodes’ roommate I figured you must be a decent guy and I enjoyed our short conversation during the tour the other day.”
The sudden change in Steve startled Tony. More than that he worried because Steve not only didn't go for seconds but he didn’t even finish his first portion of food. It took a lot not to get up and run after Steve and ask him what the matter was. He knew what it was. Not all of it but more than enough to know it wasn’t his place.
it happen the first time around.
Steve motioned for them to continue downstairs into the living room and he shut the doors to it like he had the other night while he played piano. They sat on the couch facing one another and he thought about carrying on their conversation but he just didn’t have it in him to talk about Tony. So he changed the topic slightly.
Steve tried to sit up. “
“Not feeling up to your home bar?” James asked, straightening his tie.
“It is but not if you work different trucks or jobs within the firehouse. I mean, it still kind of is but it isn’t outright banned in that case. Barnes is the Squad lieutenant. Sam’s on truck with me.”
Steve nodded. “James, I’m in love with him.”
“Imagine a world where we could actually have weddings like normal couples. I bet Steve would go all out and make it as special as possible on every possible level.” He moved the cup between his hands and got up to top it up again. “Which reminds me that my only other friend is getting married soon. Hmmm.”
“What?” Steve asked, laughing. “Don’t think I could be in the insurance business?” He grinned, looking over at Tony.
“What’re you gonna do without me?”
“Clint’s bar,” James said simply. “And that was Clint’s bartender and friend, Phil.”
“Sorry, guys, Fury and I had to talk to the Commissioner about that last call.” Bucky threw him his bag and he jerked his head towards the exit. “Let’s go. I need four days of sleep.”
When the explosion sounded, his first instinct was to scan the crowd of civilians who had gathered around to watch and his eyes fell on one man who immediately turned and started to leave. Bucky didn’t hesitate, he took after him and there was more than enough incriminating evidence in the man’s backpack to support his actions and his immediate arrest.
Tony was still holding onto Steve’s wrists and he swallowed hard to get his own emotions under control. This had nothing to do with him. He needed to be there for Steve. Work through these things. He told James he could do it and he would. Even if it was the last thing he did.
“Thanks, we think so too,” he said, twisting the ring and then sipping the rest of his coffee. “I know. I love Nat but I’d divorce her and marry James in a heartbeat if I could. Though, I’m sure she’s already told Maria the same thing.” He laughed because he knew it was true and could hear Nat saying it. “Maybe one day it’ll be a possibility for us. Never know.”
rather. He definitely wasn’t making progress. He was back on missing James and wondering when he would be back whilst simultaneously wondering if Tony secretly knew how he felt. He tried to keep it where it belonged and cracked a joke instead, “We can go play with Benni’s action figures if you need to feel young again.”
“You finally got my letters, sweetheart?”
James stirred but for once he didn’t wake or at least didn’t comment on Clint being awake. As carefully as possible, Clint got out of bed and wrapped himself up in a robe, heading out of the bedroom.
Tony’s gaze softened and he cupped Steve’s face between his hands.
“They’re together now, I’m assuming.” Sarah nodded. “How long?”
“I’m not used to this much food,
Without saying a word the other men entered, turned on the lights and looked around while waiting for Tony to come in after them. Tony was surprised to see the store clean and tidy. Then again it wasn’t much of a surprise since Steve had been here last. This was probably his doing. Or at least someone he paid to do it.
The fact that it was him who made Steve curse in Gaelic turned Tony on even more. Just when he thought that wasn’t possible. He leaned up to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck to pull him closer as he moved himself against Steve, trying to silently encourage him to thrust. Well, not silently but without actual words. It didn’t take much for him to feel close and he hated and loved it at the same time.
“You know I’m not fond of loose ends or half-assed work,” Steve said, his voice dangerously low. He would never hurt Dugan, he couldn’t imagine it, but friends or not, Dugan worked for him and he needed to do his job right.
“Good afternoon, Mr Rogers, how can we help you?” a young man said, clasping his hands together to keep them from trembling as Steve had noticed.
“It’s not me who said those things,” he answered, hating how he had given in to Steve. “He’s in no position to judge us. All I want,
“Aren’t we all?” Steve said, walking again on his way to Chief Fury’s office. Bucky came from the bathrooms and joined them on their walk, a lieutenant flanking Steve on either side. “Perfect, I was just about to come look for you,” Steve told Bucky, “that diner fire we put out yesterday was flagged by OFI. They found a timer embedded near the exposed wiring. I need you too, Rhodes.”
He took a bite of his bread roll and said, “Let’s wait a night. We’ll try it tomorrow. That way we give James and Steve another day,” Clint said, hoping it would ease Tony’s worries at least a little, “and I’ve already agitated them enough for one day.”
“Fifty-left-twenty-left-down-thirty,” Clint said aloud, asking Tony to repeat it. “When they dragged me out, we passed the exit. Those numbers aren’t certain because our strides are different so start feeling for walls around five steps before, maybe less.” He worked his jaw, feeling the soreness setting in. “I know I can get the keys off the guard without him noticing.”
James wiped his own face and sat up with him, a hand sliding onto Clint’s back and rubbing in slow circles.
Tony stayed close to Steve after Dugan had promised his loyalty, feeling how Steve was holding him tighter as well. How could anyone ever betray him? The betrayal of Falsworth hurt Tony and he couldn't even begin to imagine what it must’ve done to Steve.
“I thought this was a bit extravagant for your living room,” Natalia laughed. “And where exactly would you have us go?”
“Has Tony said anything to you? About their time with Bakuto?” James’ hand went to the dog tags around his neck while he spoke.
the right one.” Tony gave him and a look that made him laugh. “You look fine, Tones. Really.”
Howard was being held against the wall by a familiar face, a knife to his throat. James turned to Steve.
“Tony!” The boy squealed and started crying almost immediately. Despite his pain and everything else, Tony moved to pull his brother into his arms and hug him tightly.
Tony smiled at Steve’s Italian. He loved the way he pronounced the words. A part of him wanted to teach Steve Italian until he was fluent. Another wanted him to keep his beautiful accent forever.
He was crouched down in between the gravestones and smiled softly. “
Just when he had managed to distract himself he saw the door opening and there were James and Sarah. They didn’t have to say anything for Tony to put his jacket on and follow them to James’ car. Tony sat next to Sarah and held her hand. It had been months since he had last seen James and now he was simply back? Had he been gone? Had he something to do with this? What happened? Tony forced himself to continue breathing calmly, helping Sarah to the hospital. A man who looked familiar to Tony walked towards them as soon as he saw them. What was his name again? He couldn’t remember.
Clint looked up away from James who had been practicing a new word in ASL while Steve alternated between watching on curiously and watching Tony. Clint knew a ‘please leave’ when he heard it and so did James.
It’s not over yet.
Clint laughed and continued,
Steve got to the restaurant at exactly six-forty-five. He was wearing a nice pair of slate-grey trousers and a light blue button down—all clothes picked out for him with Sam’s help. If it were up to Bucky, he would have arrived in just his turnout pants, helmet, and no shirt because “that’s how you get laid, Steve.”
James cracked a half-smile and confessed, “It scares me.” Clint’s fingers froze where they were and James opened his eyes to see complete and utter shock on Clint’s face.
Sarah sat silently, listening, watching the exchanges and how they worked together. It reminded her of a very young James and Steve and made her smile. When she looked up next, Tony’s eyes were half-closed and he was starting to drift. She knew Benni wasn’t ready to leave his brother and she had nowhere to go. It wasn’t even late yet so she’d let him fall asleep and carry him out later.
“No, second desk drawer,” he clarified and then turned to Tony, “He wants something stronger than wine.” He was about to change the subject when he realized. “Is that going to be alright? Him drinking while we talk?” Wine was one thing but a bottle of scotch was another.
James answered, turning his attention now to Natalia who waved at him from her spot on the couch beside Clint. “Natalia,” he added warmly.
“Don’t do it again, alright? I told you before and I’ll tell you again: I have no problem chaining you to this bed,” he said with a small smile. “I’d rather not have to do that.” His voice was softer that time.
However, not all of Bakuto’s dealings were so unpalatable to Steve and James. His arms trafficking wasn’t too shabby, neither was the money he raked in from his real estate and construction kickback schemes. Steve and James were sharing the profits from the three of those equally and the way their bank accounts were growing was nothing to sniff at.
“It’s…. it just… it was terrifying. And I felt powerless,” Clint admitted. That wasn’t a way he often felt. He was no James but that didn’t mean he let others take advantage of him. Clint was a fighter and a survivor but being held by Bakuto was one of the few times in his life when he had doubted that he was really either of those things and suddenly finding himself plunged back into that feeling hit him like a bag of bricks.
“James?” Clint croaked, his eyes stinging with the threat of tears and then they fell down his cheeks. “James?” he asked again, trying to stand but too weak and hurt to do so.
he said between a smile and a sigh, “I just get scared. Not because I don’t trust you. I don’t mean to upset you.” He knew Steve wasn’t being mean about it but at the same time it felt like that was exactly what was happening. “Just tell me this: did I pack enough or are you planning to buy clothes over there?”
“Oh, I do want to stay here but I’m greedy and I want it all for myself. Imagine all the bread I could have without you here. So scram,” he said, making shooing motions with his hands. “So my theory for testing it out… yeah, you’re not gonna like it. It involves me yelling in the middle of the night to see what happens. Surprise!” he said, doing jazz hands.
“Aw he kissed you first,” Clint said quietly, smiling. Hearing about Steve from James’ point of view helped him prepare himself for what he would be like. Hearing him from Tony’s made him like him a bit more.
He was officially tired of trying to sleep so he dragged himself out of bed, found the house slippers Steve had brought them and tied a robe around himself, heading out.
When he finally realized what he was doing, thinking, and feeling, Tony nearly jumped. Not wanting to wake Steve, he slowly moved away from him and got up.
,” Steve asked, breathless. He moved away from him to sit on the bed and James sighed and joined him. Steve didn’t protest how closely he sat to him. It was normal. Or was it?
Steve tilted his head back, looking up at the ceiling. This was all a lot to process. He’d never been more grateful for Dugan in his life and once this was all over he was getting a fat raise and invites to their family dinners. Steve would also be paying for his wedding if he married the girl he was courting.
me. That’s… you’re just…” He trailed off, too much to say about Tony and too little time. He reached out with one hand to cup his cheek, his thumb stroking across his face. “I love you, Tony.”
James hummed in approval, nodding his head and looking at Steve as if to say ‘see? Much better.’ Steve ignored him and instead put more gravy on Benni’s plate when he asked and then grabbed a new roll since he’d given his to that jerk down there.
“Well, before ol’ Bessy here, which is what I’ve named my cast, I was a pretty quiet dude. Clumsiness aside,” he said, sipping his milk. It had just reached the perfect temperature. “Uh, no, thanks. I’m all talked out. Company’s nice though and I’ll listen if you’d like to. Milk?” he asked, offering the glass.
From outside in the hall, Steve listened in. He never entered but just stood outside and it broke his heart but if anyone was going to help, it would be his mother.
“You’re not getting rid of me, Steve. I’m going to stay, whether you like it or not.” He let go of his wrists. There was no point in trying to talk some sense into him and Tony knew that, so he wouldn’t waste his breath. Instead he stared right back at Steve who looked like he was talking to a business partner who dared to talk back to him. Steve didn’t scare him. He didn’t break eye contact while wondering which of them was the more stubborn one.
Steve nodded, his way of saying thanks, and then he stood, kissed Sarah’s cheek, the top of Benni’s head, and then squeezed James’ shoulder, offering Clint a nod. He took Tony’s hand and they disappeared around the corner heading for the stairs.
Tony looked over at Steve who was drinking a glass of water and watching him from the kitchen. What would their wedding look like, if they could have one? As if he had sensed Tony’s dark and self-deprecating thoughts, Steve came over, simply standing next to Tony but not saying anything.
“Should’ve taken him out, done the world a favor.”
Steve and James also had very different ways of—well, there was no sugarcoating it—torturing. Steve preferred the kicks and punches route with a dash of non-fatal gunshot wounds to spice things up.
“You threw up on
“We’ll have privacy,” James assured him. “No one will ask questions or bother us.”
He wasn’t broken, they hadn’t
“Just like it wasn’t right for you to tell me about Rumlow and his threats to expose you
Sarah cleared her throat and Steve realized he was supposed to be carving the chicken. He stood and began cutting slices for everyone. James chuckled and spoke to Tony in the meantime.
“Well, as your friend I tell you that I kind of live in a building that belongs to Steve.”
Steve approached slowly, unsure, and crouched down in front of Tony, keeping his voice low and speaking slowly. “What do you need?” he asked him.
“Thank you. It’s just… we don’t have any other family. I know we’re not family. Not that I don’t appreciate—I’ll just stop talking.” She gave his shoulders a squeeze and pressed a kiss on top of his head.
He went back to the door, lifting his knuckles to knock. If there wasn’t a problem, James would curse him out and he knew it but better safe than sorry.
“Cap, he’s here,” he called out over the sound of a punch. Steve turned and saw him and sucked in a sharp, furious breath. Falsworth swung at him, about to remind him of the importance of not letting anything distract you, when Steve turned and caught the fist in a hand. Falsworth’s face was the equivalent of ‘uh-oh’ and Dugan just laughed and kept eating.
Steve blushed. “Well, you’re not wrong. He was really good. Best I’ve had in a long while,” he admitted, sipping his coffee calmly and trying to hide his grin. Bucky reached over and smacked his arm, almost making him spill his drink.
He came further into the living room and over to them both, bending first to press a kiss to Natalia’s cheek and then one to Clint’s forehead. James
Steve startled. “I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t it be?”
“He's over there, more pathetic than the last time you visited,” James told him, pointing vaguely towards Howard with the least amount of effort possible, taking another piece of ginger bread out of his pocket and moving away from Steve this time. “We should put him in a proper holding cell.”
“You give fair chances.” He knew that his father had been kept in a prison not unlike his own the past few weeks. He had been starved, kept awake just like his father had been back then. “What he did, he did out of greed. You’re not a greedy man, Steve.”
“Love?” Steve said at the same time that James said,
Clint’s tired expression cleared and made way for that lopsided smile that had first taken James’ breath away. “I haven’t brushed my teeth in weeks. I taste bad.”
O’Shea eyes widened in panic and he began confessing how he was siphoning money out of the accounts, trying to keep it all level so it would go virtually undetected. Steve was an incredibly intelligent man but he also trusted O’Shea so he never looked into the files himself. Dugan had brought to his attention what was happening with the others but this?
“These young men need to be fitted for clothing. Underwear, undershirts, both winter and summer, one suit each, and casual clothing. Something for the little man to grow into. Nothing too tight for either of them. I plan on feeding them properly.” The man nodded and went to get another person to help him take measurements.
“Is everything to your liking?” He asked. “I can change whatever’s not.”
“What are you talking about?” he asked, his pen hovering over the documents in front of him as a deep dread began to set in.
Steve knew he found Tony physically appealing but what had initially attracted him in a noticeable way was that unwavering strength. That ability to keep going despite seeing no way out, making one for himself and even with the situation removed, Tony still had that air about him.
But he wasn’t sure. Maybe this was a one time thing for Steve. It would be embarrassing to text him if it was. But if it wasn’t and Steve didn’t text, how would he know?
From far away, he heard the grandfather clock chime 2am. He had at least five more hours alone. As silently as possible Tony headed to the library in the dark, trying not to disturb anyone if he could help it. Once inside he closed the door just as silently and turned on the lights, heading straight for the record player and turning on some soft music on the lowest volume possible. Just something that wasn’t silence. That’s all he wanted.
there with them. Not only that but he also had the audacity to act as if he hadn’t just given Tony all kinds of ideas.
That same morning, Clint was at work despite James repeatedly asking him to schedule one of the others instead. Clint understood the danger, mind you, he just didn’t like anyone thinking they had made him back down in fear. Was it stubborn and prideful and stemmed from childhood trauma? Yes. Was
Benni thought about this and then leaned over to Steve, gesturing for him to come closer. Steve leaned down and Benni cupped his hands around his ear, whispering something. Steve chuckled until he realized what doing it would imply but he had to, right?
“You want me to head to the usual spot, Cap?” Natasha asked, hesitating to put her left turn blinker on until she got a confirmation.
“Shit, sorry,” Steve said to a wide awake, nervous Tony.
The movie started and he leaned back, getting more comfortable and so did Steve. Although it seemed impossible for him because he was simply too tall and too broad. Whenever he adjusted himself he ended up touching Tony in one way or the other. At first their elbows, then their arms, even their hands brushed together at one point. Then Steve bumped his foot into Tony’s, hitting their knees once.
James nodded, wondering how this relationship—or whatever it was—had gone on for so long without Tony knowing Steve’s first name. “Yes, him.”
“Manhattan but I’ve been in Brooklyn since I was a teenager. When my father bought the garage, he moved us out here. Is your family here too?”
“I was thinking about it and I can’t say I’ve seen you this tipsy before. I’m not counting the painkillers.” He watched Steve’s face while he wrapped the bandages around the clean cloth. “Do you want to lay down and tell me?”
“And I’m glad you have them. I like what they do to you,” she said, kissing each of their cheeks. “Now go get some sleep so I can have all my boys back again.”
. Especially if it matters to you.”
Natalia nodded, gently chewing the inside of her cheek as she thought.
And then he spoke and Steve didn’t know what to do. Steve knew Tony was aware of at least the physical aspect of what had happened that evening between himself and James. Sarah had told him it didn’t bother him but a part of Steve still wondered if Tony wasn’t at least a little bit disgusted.
Steve just wanted to crawl in bed but he ate because he knew he was hungry and because it would make Tony happy.
But not this guy.
Basic human requirement. Tony looked down at the towel in his hands. Basic. Essential. Normal. Human. What he was. What everyone around him was. Requirement. A thing that is needed or wanted. A necessary condition. Tony furrowed his brows, deep in thought as he went through those words again. James needed it. Steve needed it. Sarah knew that. Men who were older and stronger than him. Who had seen more, done more.
“Oh, that’s lovely. And you don’t want to go? I mean, I understand, love, but she was also your closest friend,” Steve said, happy for the complete change of topic. “Dugan? Oh, yeah. He and Julie have a date set for March sometime.”
With all of that in mind, Steve shrugged and said, “I don’t think we need it. At this point, we’re just being greedy.”
Ten minutes later they were led to Steve’s room. He looked awful but he was alive and breathing and that’s all that mattered.
She was wiping tears from her eyes. “If you think I don’t know, then you must think I’m
Steve dropped his head but never raised his arms to touch Tony. They stayed on his legs because he would not take advantage of Tony trying to comfort him.
Tony rested against him unsure of what to say or what to do. Steve was warm and big and right there. His heart was beating faster but at the same time it hurt. Ever so slightly Tony leaned against Steve’s side
“I won’t. You know I only do it to keep you safe,” Steve said, gently reclining them both down onto the bed again, keeping Tony in his arms. “That’s all I have to tell you for now. Let’s end the night on a lighter note. I don’t know if she told you but ma wants your help with Thanksgiving dinner. James and his guy are going to join us.”
+   +
“I am,” he told him, turning to Tony and Steve. “Besides, Lucky doesn’t like the car. He’ll need someone to hold him and he can’t do that
For a second longer Tony hesitated but decided against asking James anything and closed the door behind him. Inside he helped the nurse with the bandages and holding Steve. He was completely out of it. And when the nurse asked if Tony knew how much morphine he had taken, Tony shrugged. There was a limit, which Steve luckily hadn’t reached yet. It was still enough to keep him sleeping while the nurse was injecting numbing medicine and stitching him up again. It was only then that Tony noticed that he was dressed in his casual wear that he only wore around the house. If that didn’t describe how fast everything went, he didn’t know what would.
As soon as he felt how Steve was kissing him, he all but forgot about hitting his head. For a second he wanted to stop him because they needed to go somewhere more private but that thought was quickly dismissed when he heard a seagull screaming. No, they weren’t in New York. They were in Ireland, somewhere private.
“See?” Tony responded with a small smirk, now feeling much more comfortable with Steve next to him. “I don’t know what he said but he’s right. Is there anything you want me to bring you back?”
Steve lifted both hands to his face, his coffee back on the table again. “I
James helped Clint into the car and then sat Lucky in his lap, who seemed very excited to be going on a road trip. James got into the driver’s seat and started the engine.
Steve watched Tony process his words and he nodded before realizing what it meant. Steve had already gone back to kissing him, his lips on Tony’s neck when Tony tried to sit up, horror clear on his face.
“Mr Rogers sure doesn’t talk a lot,” Pepper said, making Tony turn around and look at her. “Did he want something in particular?”
With that as the last thought on his mind Tony finally passed out, breathing getting more difficult with every ragged inhale, not able to keep his eyes open from all the swelling. Something warm was running down his forehead and over his lips, there was the taste of metal on his tongue. At least he wasn’t cold anymore.
“Big day ahead of you tomorrow?” Sarah asked her son before stepping out of the room. Steve shook his head and yawned.
“Any idea where?” Steve asked.
James remembered Clint couldn’t hear him. Did Bakuto not know? Or was this all just some extraordinarily cruel form of torture for them both—James could hear Clint but Clint couldn’t hear him and, if James knew anything about Bakuto, he probably hadn’t even told Clint who was on the other end of the call.
“You really don’t need to thank me for that.”
Steve didn’t want to pull away but eventually he did. Slowly though, slow enough that he could stop first and hold Tony by his arms and look down at him with a soft smile.
He sheathed his knife into the holder he kept on his right hip and said, “That’s what I’m going to find out.”
“If you’d like I can bring you fresh clothes and some proper food,” she said and Tony knew it was less about him and more about her seeing Steve. Tony looked back to Steve who looked uncomfortable. Given his reaction from earlier he decided against it for now.
Tony hummed, enjoying Steve’s hands on his body. He moved his hands over Steve’s back. He had no idea what he was supposed to do or what would make Steve happy but that was a worry for another day. He would ask him.
“It’s more than I could have ever hoped for,” Tony answered honestly. He would have accepted a lot less if it only meant staying away from that building he had spent his whole life in. If it meant that Benni would be safe and never go to bed hungry or cold again. “Thank you.”
It was less than a week before the paperwork arrived in the mail. In that time, Steve had been working with Dugan and Jones, plus their new trainee Jim Morita (Dugan’s new brother-in-law) to whom Steve offered a job as a result of Dugan’s sterling recommendation. Steve wasn’t all that worried about business going smoothly. For one, he knew it would. He knew Dugan was capable of handling anything he threw at him. And for two, the only thing Steve was worried about going smoothly was his holiday with Tony. Everything else be damned.
“Steve tells me you would like to finish it after all?” James asked, wanting to see Tony’s face and hear it for himself.
“Wow,” Clint said, letting out a low whistle. Lucky padded over to the girls, doing figure-eights around them. “You two look swell. More than swell. You look—Sweetheart, give us a sophisticated word.”
” Before Tony could answer, Benni left again and closed the door. Tony couldn’t help but notice how his mother and Benni were so alike. For a second he could have sworn that it was Maria who had smiled at him. And just like their mother, Benni was endlessly kind and loving, despite everything.
James hesitated before answering. “Yes. He took someone from me. I have no intention of showing mercy.” He waited, wondering if this would mean she would not do him the favor. He wanted to lie but Gao could smell a lie from a hundred miles away. The only way was the truth.
Natalia’s answering expression was incredibly gentle and warm. “I know,” she said, resting her hand on top of Clint’s. “Why do you think I like him? Now, I need a pen and paper.”
“I do. It’s weird. Emotions and all that. You know it’s not my strong suit.”
“Nothing good.”
Tony’s eyes finally made it back up to meet Steve’s who gave him a knowing smile.
“Here we are,” the man said, knocking on an unmarked white door at the back of the room. Steve had given Dugan a look when they’d passed all those cases and not stopped at even one of them.
Steve shrugged and said, “It’s his call,” indicating to Tony.
They’d explored a few spots in the station and then Tony was bored and had had enough. He was behaving so well—Rhodey should be proud—but for real now, he wanted to talk to Steve.
James normally would have rolled his eyes or grinned but he was in public so he just gave Clint a small smile. Clint didn’t mind. He could read those eyes now; he saw what James couldn’t show.
stay the night in their home.
“Cap,” Rhodey said the next day back at work, jogging to meet him. Steve slowed, his head down looking at paperwork. He was thumbing through a file and stopped on a particular report before turning to Rhodey.
“Alright,” Clint said, grateful to not have to talk about abusive fathers, even if it wasn’t his own. “New topic. Sandwiches. What’s your favorite and when will you be making it for me?”
At the hospital he was led straight to Steve’s room and no one followed him in. It was quite the service to be treated like that, though Tony preferred to do things his way and not be followed everywhere he went.
“And all my focus will be on worrying about
He looked him in his eyes and said, keeping his voice steady, “Sometimes. Sometimes you can forget but it never truly goes away. There are some I’ve forgotten but that tends to happen when your body count is where mine is,” he said. He came over and sat down on the couch next to Tony. He reached out, putting a hand on Tony’s knee very lightly, just as an added bit of comfort. “But I still remember the first one.”
he can ask me whatever question pops into that adorable head of his.” Steve stretched, cracking his joints as Tony spoke again and then he laughed but it was shy and his face went red. “She, uh, she’s known for a while how I feel about you. I think she’ll be more relieved than anything else.” He smiled at Tony. “And it goes without saying that she loves you too.”
“Black hoodie and blue jeans. Male build, approximately 5’9” or 10, white,” Bucky rattled off and Steve was impressed because he hadn’t even seen the clothing but Bucky was ahead of him.
doing was annoying Tony who was being so good about it and so patient with him. Steve knew he was being childish. He just needed to grow up and accept that he would be in that hospital bed for another month.
“I feel like there are thoughts
these days she doesn’t go too far without her girl, Maria.”
Steve did not wait for the car. It would’ve been useless in the snow anyway. Instead he ran down the street. It wasn’t dignified but he wasn’t worried about dignity right then and there. All he could see was Tony lying dead on the ground and killing Howard would never be as satisfying as finding the boy alive.
“Can you be more specific? Will I still be cold?” Clint asked, staring up at James.
important thing in the world but Clint would definitely like to have it. Or forms of it because he was very limited with his leg. Little movements were enough to have it throbbing for the next few hours.
“Absolutely
“Oh,” he said, not having expected to actually get asked out by Tony. Not today or any other day really. He’d mainly said it and joined their tour to get Bucky to leave him alone.
He sighed deeply and leaned in to kiss Steve who let him. He pulled back and patted his leg. “I’m going to go.”
“What? And why not?”
He opened his eyes and looked over at the door when he heard them come in, trying to sit up.
“No,” Clint protested softly and James pulled away immediately, terrified that he had hurt Clint more.
Clint was about to stop Tony by explaining that James had his pain meds—because he had special ones that were very strong —but he didn’t because they also made him super drowsy.
“And, not that it really matters,” Steve continued, “but it would make a good cover for why the two of us are staying together when we get to Ireland.”
. “You’re good company. Keep being good company and wouldja look at that? You’ve got something to give.” He kept checking the door to make sure it was closed. He meant everything he said but that didn’t mean he meant for everyone to hear it. He knew he was inching too close to truths that weren’t allowed.
Tony wondered just how much of this Steve felt himself. What was his reason for playing this piece? He listened for as long as it continued, enjoying the soothing tones and the moderate tempo but also the sincerity.
Instead he went to change into one of his two suits. That was who he was now. Owner of not one but
Tony looked to Pepper then back to him and shook his head. “No, sir. She’s a fine bird, if that's what you're asking.”
The next thing Tony remembered was hearing the clock again, now louder than before. He found himself on the couch, curled up and hugging a cushion. It was quite comfortable and he dared to close his eyes, stretch a little but where there should have been more of the couch and more room for Tony, he hit someone while stretching. His immediate reaction was to jump up and get ready to run. Then he recognized Steve.
“What?”
+  ~  +
“Come eat,” she said simply and it was most definitely a command, not a suggestion. He sighed and pushed himself up, moving to sit on the side of his bed and drag a hand down his tired face.
When he wasn’t at home with Sarah and Benni, who had taken to him better than he expected, he was at the hospital with Tony. When he wasn’t in either of those places and also not working, he was with Howard and James. James was mainly there to keep Steve from killing him. James was very familiar with what the human body looked like on the brink of death.
Steve stood and Tony sat up, staring at him blankly, not sure what he was supposed to do. Obviously he didn’t mean to do it. Probably expected someone else, Tony thought. He wasn't a morning person so it took him extra time to process everything.
“Certainly,” James said, following Clint to his office and locking the door behind them.
Hospital breakfast was nothing he actually wanted to eat after weeks of dry, tasteless food but Sarah’s rich and colorful soup full of vegetables and
“I’ll do my best,” Steve promised, nodding and feeling appreciative for Clint and the things he’d done for Tony. He’d have to remember to thank him for it. “Whenever you’re ready, love. But uh… how did you two talk? James was really broken up when he found Clint’s hearing aids.”
An hour later, Sarah came home from a day out with her friends at the salon and she searched for someone in the big house. It was quiet. The dishes in the kitchen were still there. At least, one plate was. Everything else was neat and tidy as it should be and she figured the only person in this house so bold as to leave a plate out was her son.
Sarah told me to let you sleep. Are you better?”
Twenty left to get to the stairs and he was halfway out of there. His heart was pounding in his chest when he reached the top of the stairs. Soon he would be out of there!
“—and the one with a goatee almost as nice as mine—”
“Are you circumcised?”
“This is great. Good choice,” Steve told him, his steak cutting like butter and practically melting in his mouth.
“You don’t and it
“Here. As in, move away and not come back and leave her here?”
“Thank you. That was nice,” he said as sincere as possible. “I... should probably go try to catch up on sleep.” Without waiting for an answer he headed for the door and opened it. In the hallway he turned back to look at Steve. “Thank you for the dance,” he said again and he meant it. Oh how he meant it.
“Name one good thing that’s come out of me being with you.”
Tony, who was left all alone suddenly, was honestly anxious about Clint getting dragged out of the room like that. He spent even more anxious minutes hoping that he would be alright. Not only because he was in this with him and it was bearable now that they were together, but because he didn’t want James to suffer.
Dmitri said, looking at his new watch as his hands rested on the steering wheel.

“Don’t push your luck.” Tony laughed and leaned back.
you want. So maybe snatch a spare outfit from here and we’ll see what happens.” Because he would be home. There was no other way this would go. Soon enough they’d be back together at home.
“Because you act without thinking. Going to see Clint at that diner is case in point. If whoever this is has eyes on Clint, now he knows there’s some connection between the two of you. And now there’s a
He helped Steve to drink his water and set down the empty glass next to him. “Doesn’t matter,
Used to be my father’s—
“True but when I met him, he was… different. Eventually, I used my special brand of charm and dumbassery to win him over.” He let his head drop for a moment, his chest aching with how much he missed him. He lifted his head again to see Tony’s reply. He really missed his hearing aids too.
Natalia would meet Clint at the bar soon so in the meantime he cleaned and restocked things like he always did, took inventory, nothing special. He checked his watch after what felt like an hour of boring tasks—it had actually been twenty minutes—and then glanced at the door but still no Natalia. She had said she would be there around eleven, so she still had time and he knew that getting to the bar from her new place in the Village wasn’t as easy as the commute from their old apartment in Midtown.
“Firstly, I have a contact at Bergdorf Goodman who has a ring you might be interested in,” James said, eating something as he spoke. “When you go in, ask for Monet St. Croix and tell her Winter sent you. She’s holding a few items for you that she thinks you might like. I told her what you were looking for.”
“It means ‘you are my pulse,” he explained, remembering hearing Tony’s name as Falsworth stood over him, each heartbeat ‘To-ny’. He didn’t wince at the memory but it did make him hold Tony even tighter. “And it’s true. As vital to my existence as it is, so are you.”
“But why can’t I come to Ireland too?” Benni was starting to get upset, even though he tried not to show it. The little quiver in his voice gave him away.
“You’re an idiot sometimes, Steve,” Tony said with a small chuckle and took Steve’s hand. “And you’re mine. I don’t... with or without the money, the house and everything else. I’d stay. Because I love
“Like you could pop someone and they’d thank you,” Dugan laughed. Cap’s grin widened and he walked over to his friend, patting his shoulder.
“So nice of you to take time out of your day to spend it with me and not your handsome fella,” Pepper said without smiling at first. For a split second it made Tony anxious and unsure if she meant it. “Relax. I’m just pulling your leg.”
“I’ll text you.”
“Rats?” Steve asked.
After work Tony and Pepper walked to Benni’s school and picked him up and Pepper’s siblings to take them to a nearby playground. Tony didn’t forget that Steve wanted to spend time with Benni but he also wanted his brother to have more friends.
…” He pulled him close again, his arms around Tony. He kissed his forehead.
Pepper told him about the wedding preparations, described her wedding dress she had gotten from one of her aunts—the veil that her mom had worn on her wedding day, the bouquet of dried flowers she had from her grandmother. It reminded him of the small chest of things his own mother had collected for his sister for her wedding day. After his sister had died, his mother had burnt everything in the fire in the living room. Howard had complained about the smell but his mother hadn’t said anything.
Steve obeyed easily and soon but slowly, Tony was taking all of Steve. Even Steve had to pause when that happened, seeing stars in his vision, his body hit with an intense wave of pleasure. He swore in Gaelic, positioning himself better again, finding where to hold his hands on either side of Tony’s thighs and even slower than before, he began to move.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some time later they got to the cinema and walked right in without having to wait in line. The same thing happened when they were getting snacks and the man who assigned the seats gave them the best ones in the showroom.
While Steve slept, Tony walked around the room to keep himself from falling asleep. He looked outside, sat on the one couch and then on the other. He got more terrible coffee and walked around some more. There was nothing he could do.
For the duration of the drive he focused all his energy and thoughts on Steve. It was either that or panic about a situation he couldn’t change. Steve would find him. He would get him out no matter where it was they were taking him. That was all he could think of and that was all that mattered.
