“I imagine that the magical community can’t be that big, how long as Sherlock been one?”
John’s soul gem whose color was already clouded became completely black and collapsed in itself, releasing a dark smoke like energy above them. John stopped moving and the energy turned into a witch right before his very eyes.
“I wish…”
“You don’t understand! What happened the other day with me and Sebastian was more than just a fight. With every blow we were really trying to kill each other. Don’t you get it?! He was trying to kill me! How could I ever work with someone like that?”
“John Watson, do you know what wish you want to make now?” asked Kyubey.
“You just leave him to me. I’ll deal with him alone.”
“You really understand nothing. You have magic now and if you wanted the girl you could bend her to your will. You could take away her family and make her completely dependent on you.”
“You and your fucking vague answers. Why are you hanging around me so much? I’ll start shooting you on site again, you’re starting to annoy me.”
An unlikely alliance is formed and a terrible truth is revealed.
John ran down the street in the direction he thought the voice was coming from. It wasn’t until he turned into an ally that he saw not a person but a small animal, cat like thing but it wasn’t like any cat he had ever seen. It was badly wounded and john looked around for an owner or a person who had to be the one calling for help. Getting on his knees he tried to get a better look at the creature, hoping that it hadn’t already died.
“Yeah but what did it do specifically?”
“That’s not Lestrade,” said Sebastian gritting through his teeth.
“What are you talking about? Kyubey chose them and they are a part of this now.”
Instead of stopping Greg began to laugh. It wasn’t one filled with joy but more of a hollow noise that made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand on edge.
It was all so terrible, John was surrounded by a London in ruin but all he could focus on was the boy. Off in the distance he was fighting some sort of creature. He couldn’t quite understand what was going on but he knew one thing.
John did feel a little bad for Greg since he knew how much he liked Molly but the less she knew about what was actually going on, the better it really was. What John was anxious for though was whether or not Sherlock was going to show up to school or not. He didn’t know if he should confront him about what happened last night or if he should say anything at all. Sherlock came in at the last second, much to John’s relief. Greg however sent a challenging look to him. John just hoped that Greg wouldn’t start a fight and that nothing too strange could happen today. Still life would never be the same after yesterday.
“Wait, I came to tell you something important.”
“Have you been doing some criminal activities that you’ve been keeping from us,” Molly jokingly asked.
John was walking by himself, having said goodbye to Molly and Greg at school. He couldn’t go home right now, especially because Harry knew something was up with him and didn’t want to be pressed. He didn’t even know what he would say to her if asked.
Sebastian frowned but John was tired of putting up with other people’s bullshit.
At school Kyubey rested on John’s desk as Greg and John whispered to each other.
Holding Greg’s limp body John tried to get a pulse.
“I know your way is not going to work so I’m going to take care of him myself. Always preaching about being the righteous guy when he doesn’t even know what’s actually going on.”
Irene smirked as she came a step closer too.
“Don’t follow me!” he called back effectively making John stop in his track.
“I’m going to lose Molly to Tom and she was never even really mine. I just can’t ask her now… now that I’m like this. I can’t even hold her now that I’m just some corpse walking around. Just some empty body that’s still moving. Oh god John, what do I do?”
“What do you think you’re doing?! Don’t you know you’ll die!?!”
“Well I would’ve believed you.” Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly and for once he didn’t know what to say to John’s sincere words. “Also how could Kyubey just manipulate souls as if they’re nothing?”
This one is a bit shorter but it has a lot more Irene and I really do love her.
His hand was in a tight fist and he was ready to hit Sebastian at any moment.
Greg grabbed Kyubey out of frustration and began yelling at him.
“A labyrinth?”
Mr. Anderson walked over to them with a displeased look.
“I just thought, maybe…,” John began dejectedly. He knew now that there was no saving Greg.
The absurd world began to fade away until they were back in London.
“Shut up!” Greg yelled as he closed the distance between him and Sebastian.
“Do you have any regrets?”
“My plan?”
Irene went over to where the witch once stood and picked up a small object that was left behind. Transforming back into her school uniform she walked back to John and Greg whose swords reverted back into metal poles.
“Greg!” John called out through the barrier, frustrated that he couldn’t get past it. Then addressing Sebastian he yelled, “What are you doing? You’re both on the same side aren’t you? Stop fighting each other!”
“Maybe we can call Irene. Do you have her number?” asked John
Sebastian was hit and flew against hitting one of the cells hard
“What did you do?” asked John.
“I am. What about her do you need to talk to me about?” inquired Greg.
“Well she does factor into it a lot but I’m telling you mate, it was the best thing I could wish for. Now are you going to let me finish talking or what?”
“Maybe he’s right. All this time I’ve stood back and watched and it’s not like me at all. I’ve been so useless and I could do something about it. If Kyubey’s right I could be helping him out but I haven’t been. If I just wished to be a con-“
“Kyubey was there and of course Molly couldn’t see him. So after I saw her get on the bus back to her house I went to a place where no one would see me with Kyubey. He told me he could grant my wish and so we formed a contract.”
“John?!”
“Honestly I don’t know.”
Also everything is only going to get worst for the poor dear.
John forced himself up into a sitting position shocked by Sebastian’s sudden voice in his head.
Sebastian’s whole body was now rippling with anger and his once calm expression was turning into a vicious sneer. After a moment Sebastian carried on.
“So that’s the rookie. He’s seems pretty young and innocent. There’s that glint of righteousness in his eyes. That kind of ticks me off.”
Greg’s face turned into a scowl.
The world was just so unfair.
John could only give half a chuckle, thinking that they were going to die by murderous freakish flowers in who knows wherever the hell they were and the last words spoken were done so sarcastically. Out of nowhere a girl dropped down from the sky in front of them.
He pulled the trigger.
“Don’t tell me you actually believe in that stuff,” said John.
Mike continued to walk, giving no acknowledgment towards John. He ran across the street until he was right in Mike’s way, stopping him from moving forward.
The three left behind watched Greg run away surprisingly fast for someone who looked like he was about to collapse. Sebastian gave a sigh of discontent.
“What is going on,” said Sherlock on the edge of losing it because none of what was happening should be possible.
“Greg?” asked Tom worried that he might’ve angered him.
“What the hell was that?” asked John, concerned for Greg.
“You’re right. I honestly don’t care about you but I do care about John and the way you’re acting hurts him. Anything that causes John Watson pain I will remove.”
“That’s what it said,” replied John.
“I’m sorry, Greg. I should’ve killed you when we first met and saved everyone all this misery. I shouldn’t have gone soft. Forgive me for that weakness. It won’t happen again.”
“A moment later and it might’ve been too late. Are you okay?” asked John
Once again Sherlock was right, Kyubey didn’t think like humans do.
After a little while longer, Molly came out of the room not speaking. It wasn’t until they left the hospital that Greg tried talking to her.
“Why did you…” began Greg before he collapsed onto the ground.
“Oh Sherlock this is Irene Adler,” John said motioning to her.
“You can have this city,” said Sherlock.
“That wasn’t good,” said a voice behind Sherlock.
Happiness is still not to be found though.
As he fell he thought,
Thank you Sherlock. You said that you weren’t going to help but you still came. I knew you-“
“Time to finish this,” Greg said.
“Were you… born this way?”
“Your overreaction every time you see me is pointless and it doesn’t seem to calm your wasted anger. I don’t understand why you keep up with it. Also ever since you’ve arrived you haven’t shot me. Mainly because I’ve been giving you useful information.”
“I guess now that you’re on the same page as Sebastian and Sherlock you guys can-“
“I don’t understand how he’s alright,” murmured John, happy that his friend was still alive.
“And what would that be exactly?” “I know that you and Irene didn’t get along for whatever reason but Greg is my best mate and he’s a good person. He’s brave, kind hearted and will definitely help out someone who needs it. So I was hoping that with him you wouldn’t fight. If perhaps you would kind of look out for him too.”
“I’ll follow shortly but you can’t fight and hold him at the same time.”
“I don’t believe you!” They both stopped walking at John’s outburst. “I know I haven’t known you for very long but I can tell that you do care. Even with Irene you wanted to save her. Then there’s me. For some reason you’ve been hell bent on keeping me from making a contract. Tell me have you seen lots of people die horribly?”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked in a venomous tone as he appeared next to Sebastian out of nowhere.
“John? Are you serious?”
“Sherlock really is quite smart. He can look at a person and tell you their whole life story,” said Greg.
“Yes. I’ve liked Molly for a long time and she’s always said that she can’t be in a relationship with her dad being sick but now he’s better. I think that there might be something between us but if you’re dating her than I’ll leave her alone.”
“Sherlock Holmes, could it be that the reason John Watson has so much potential is because of you?” Sherlock remained silent but the tightening of his fist betrayed him. “I thought so. You’re a time traveler so each time you’ve rewritten the current events, you’ve increased the power of his Karmic Destiny.”
John was at a loss for words. He had heard and seen a lot of weird things today, more than he could ever want in a life time but this was just the cherry on top of the really freaking weird sundae. This was all just too unbelievable.
“Well it’s nice to meet you, I’m Tom. Molly’s boyfriend.”
“Well I would like to believe you but I can never take a person who thinks space is a waste of time seriously.”
Molly’s dad had passed away and it had been a hard year on her. She had only recently been dating Tom but everything seemed to be going well, though Sherlock believed it wouldn’t last because he was a bit mundane for her and she liked a bit of danger. Greg was sad that Molly only saw him as a friend but after moping around for a couple of weeks, he threatened Tom with bodily harm if he ever hurt Molly and was on the mend. Unfortunately this mend might be speeding up because he met Mycroft one day when he had accompanied John to Sherlock’s flat the exact moment Mycroft decided to make a surprise and unwanted visit. They were actually on their way to meeting the elder Holmes at some sort of show where he got tickets for all of Sherlock’s “friends” but really it was just a ploy to see Greg again.
“You must know I don’t make promises I can’t keep and I’m saying this because it’s the truth, you should forget about Lestrade.”
“We can think about this right? It’s not a now or never situation?” asked John.
Sherlock stepped in front of Sebastian.
“What’s in the bag?” asked John.
The aftermath of Irene's death has John and Greg rethinking being a Magical Boy.
“Sherlock!” John yelled.
Sebastian face darkened, his eyes narrowing dangerously down at the creature. Quickly materializing a hand gun he aimed it at Kyubey.
“That wish, it would rewrite history! Do you understand the gravity of your wish?”
“When we get back,” Sherlock hesitated, breathing a bit, “I want to.”
” Sherlock repeated.
“No,” John promised, eyes shining
“You’re a wonder, kid,” Lestrade marveled as the goons were handcuffed and led away.
“God, save us all.”
“Sherlock-“
“I made him a promise Harry.”
He lost count of the kisses John left trailing down his stomach towards his crotch as his fingers tangled in John’s hair, left blonde by the afternoon sun casting shadows on the two teens. Then John’s breath was above him and Sherlock felt faint.
“I’ll count the minutes,” Sherlock drawled sarcastically, but John understood him all the same. And then John opened the door and walked into the pitch-black cabin, leaving the taller teen alone on the gravel road.
as it was, was now undressing a Sherlock in his mind and slamming her violently into a wall. With his dick.
“I love you.”
“Come and dance?” he asked and Sherlock nodded, throat suddenly dry.
“Sorry, I’ll make sure to let the serial killers know you’re bored.”
“Hello, Chloe,” Sherlock said, sitting down across from her.
The office was silent as both pairs of eyes came to rest on her. “Excuse me?” Richards coughed out but she’d seen enough in his eyes to know her initial guess was right. Good, she didn’t need Joan to know she’d barged in only half-confident she’d figured it out.
Sherlock, being Sherlock, read his mind and swept him up into a bone-crushing hug. He smelled like rainwater and smoke and woods and dirt and that same vivid Sherlock smell that John had smelt in the tent and he never wanted to let him go. He had the unexpected premonition that their lives would be full of these hugs, desperate hugs on the cusps of goodbyes, and he held the boy tighter.
I will be posting my next story which is a third of the way done probably by the end of the moth. I hope you have enjoyed the story despite it taking forever to post it for no real good reason.
“Oh really, and you say you’re a man of logic and reason? More so then the average person?”
“Hey fuck you I know what I’m doing I don’t need to talk to Steve,” retorted the first man while chuckling.
Just as she was going to deal the killing blow, there was a gun shot and Irene fell to the ground. Her soul gem shattered. The bindings around Sherlock disintegrated and John collapsed to the ground, trying not to cry. Sherlock went over to him and held him tightly.
Greg was definitely in no shape to even try to defend himself or to start anything.
“Look,” Sebastian sighed, ”Sherlock wanted me to talk to you and you wanted to listen before so you can come along with me now or you can just go back in your house and mope.”
“John!” called Kyubey from his window.
“I’m not asking you to fix my relationship with John.”
“I’m not interested in power, if I can help people then I will.”
Magnussen had brought the familiar maelstrom with him. Not needing to hide in a labyrinth it hung fearlessly in the sky destroying more and more of London with each passing moment. Even with stopping time and getting direct hits on him, still nothing worked.
Far out of the two friends sight was Sebastian watching through a magically enhanced telescope. Standing on the roof of another building with Kyubey by his side.
“So do you actually have a plan?” asked Sebastian as they stood before the opening of the labyrinth.
John would be lying if he didn’t think Greg was actually pretty cool with his new outfit.
Also awesome fav character makes a cameo at the end of the chapter!
“I didn’t necessarily trick you. You simply never asked. Most of you don’t even believe you have souls since you can never feel them. Honestly most Magical Boys and Girls go through their lives never even realizing it. Take Irene for example she never knew about it, even in the end.”
“Then I’ll stay here with the seed while you find her. We can’t leave it alone.”
“I really can’t feel anything! It’s just like that thing said, I don’t even feel the pain anymore!”
“Well you do have some time, it’s best to think these things through if you can. You know get the best deal,” she added with a grin.
They did defeat Magnussen but they were dying.
“What are you talking about? What’s wrong with him?!”
The witch along with everyone in the room were confused as to what had just happened. It tried again to eat Sherlock and then again but each time it took a bite, he would appear in another area of the tent. Finally it tried one more time but this time a small sequence of explosions took place inside of it until a massive explosion from within destroyed it all together. Sherlock landed in front of them as the labyrinth faded away. A grief seed appeared and Sherlock picked it up.
How could this be happening again? Three days later and they were exactly where they were before. With an empty body in front of them again.
“Yep it’s one of my duties to take care of them after they’re used. You know it’s important to keep your soul gem clear. The more grief seeds you have the more magic you can use.”
“That’s what you’re here for isn’t it? Well you can take it and leave. After today, I’m done with you,” said Greg.
“Moran?” Sebastian held his soul gem in his hand and John could see that there was a curse growing inside of it just like Greg. “There’s been a small curse growing ever since Jim died and I know that no amount of grief seeds can prevent it anymore. So next time-“
Sebastian could read the surprise all over John’s face and giving another sigh he continued, “This isn’t a little pow wow. You’re boyfriend asked me to do this and we’re partners. At least for now.”
“I guess not.”
Sherlock nodded and was still very much confused about everything that happened.
Lestrade came around and both of the men jumped at his sudden appearance.
“Fine then, I’ll fight him. You sit back like I already told you to.”
“Hey go back to talking about your girlfriend,” he said.
John didn’t want to go to school. He didn’t want the pitying glances and people asking him questions. He didn’t want to go see the counselor and he certainly didn’t want to talk about it, with anyone. Kyubey came by the day before and he raged against the lying creature. How could it allow people to become witches? What gave it the right to mess with people’s lives? Kyubey true to his nature did not see anything wrong with what it did but revealed another truth on why it was doing all of this.
Also character list is still the same
“Quick John make a contract with me! Only another contractor can save Greg now and put a stop to it!” said Kyubey.
John was surprised to say the least, not only was he coming in at a random time of the school year but his first day was going to be a Wednesday? He saw Mrs. Hudson motion for the boy who was standing in the hall to come in. Everyone tilted their necks to get a good look at the new guy. John’s eyes widened in surprise. The boy who walked in wore a cold, disinterested expression on his face and was tall with dark curly hair. But John knew the boy from his dream! He didn’t know why his brain made the connection but he knew that whatever happened in his dream last night, the boy in it and the one standing in front of him where the same. If only he could remember what it was about.
“You know my purpose here and the truth of it all don’t you?” Sherlock remained silent and began to pull the trigger before Kyubey continued. “Then you know what it means for Greg Lestrade’s soul gem to contain a curse.”
“Well you should know that there’s another Magical Boy in the city too.”
“No, I can’t think of what to wish for.”
“It’s ultimately not up to you. One day he’s going to be in a situation and he’ll make a contract with me.”
Standing up and lighting a cigarette, he grinned.
Sherlock Holmes really hated the idea of starting at a new school. He had gotten in a bit of trouble in the last one with some of the other students. Simply put they were being idiots and Sherlock wasn’t going to take it lying down so a couple of stolen chemicals and a bit of time, the three boys no longer have any hair on their face and only patches on the rest of their head. His parents were disappointed and were able to deal with the matter quietly, though it was mainly Mycroft who didn’t want to be tied to a small time arsonist who got the records sealed. So now he was living in London, alone. All thanks to Mycroft. Sherlock had barely gotten use to the idea of having a small flat to himself which Mycroft stressed that if he were to ruin, he would make him live in a squalor. Still it had been a week that he moved to London and tomorrow he was going to his new school. Hopefully the people would leave him alone. That was the only thing he could really ask for.
“No family?” Irene pressed and Sherlock shrugged. “Oh, that’s interesting,” she mused.
John beamed at him. “Alright then. That’s sorted.”
pat her arm sympathetically after Joan recanted the latest headache associated with the forming soccer team, the blonde would just lean in and rest her head on Sherlock’s shoulder with an almighty sigh. Joan, she was coming to realize, expected absolutely nothing from her but her presence.
“We need to call-“ John tried but Hamish silenced him with a raised hand.
“What kind of restaurant is this?” he asked, eyes wide.
“Yeah, and I’m the queen of England,” Harry muttered, eyeing Sherlock carefully who had by now tried to crawl as far under John’s covers as he could manage.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In any case, you need to stay healthy. You need to be able to treat him tomorrow; it won’t due for you to come down with what he has,” Sherlock cut him off. “I wasn’t planning on sleeping tonight anyway.”
They all go to dinner, both families, and for a moment everything fades into stills of black and white of people laughing and smiling. John’s hand is warm on his thigh, tracing small circles on his trousers leaving a heavy fire burning in the pit of his stomach.
In response, Sherlock only held it closer and Jim shrugged.
“I didn’t have to be told,” he said, but he was anyway, by children on the playground and adults in doctor’s coats calling themselves psychologists. “I just know.”
“Maybe it’s only for other people,” John suggested and Sherlock shot him a withering look.
“Right so,” Joan was still talking when Sherlock tuned back in, “we were thinking the club could like organize and do marches with other groups. But maybe we could also run events here? We could do sit ins and put up fliers-
“I display all the scientific signs,” Sherlock offers. “Elevated heart rate, increased pulse, dilated pupils.”
“I meant something his teachers might approve of,” John laughed.
Sherlock let out a deep breath. “And you’re Romeo which gives us another good seven minutes until you appear onstage,” he calculated and Hamish was not surprised his father knew Shakespeare by heart. “We just need to-“
“This is a very serious question,” he validated and the toddler preened. “I will construct an answer for you that will assuage your fears. But until then, you do not have to go swimming.”
on a piece of paper and sticking it under the phone before racing back down to find Joan waiting for her right where she’d left her, one eyebrow raised in the universal sign for impressed.
Joan peeked her head around the curtain to look at her, her hair plastered to her face, cheeks red from the hot water. “You stay late anyway. Why not just practice with us?”
” Sherlock urged and John did, letting out a gasp of his own.
“You’re right,” Sherlock smirked as he sat down and John spun on him in the near-darkness.
had hugged him.
John stared at him and blinked, slowly. Sherlock readied himself for the rebuff but all John did was let out a breath he hadn’t noticed the boy was holding.
had small, warm ‘cuddle-piles’ every now and again with his husband and son. Never had his bed seemed so vast and cold.
“I know, it’s awfully drafty,” Sherlock smiled and Chloe giggled, a rare sound. “We’ll have to come back tomorrow, but for now you need a place to sleep. John and I wanted to know if you’d like to stay at our house.”
idea you’ve had-“ Sherlock tried again as John unceremoniously pulled down Sherlock’s trousers and Sherlock stopped breathing.
John never felt like a particularly

Sherlock laughed quietly. “Yes.”
“Agent Clarkson,” he greeted cordially. “Any news?”
to see someone else?”
“No, no, it’s fine,” Sherlock blushed harder and for a moment it was just the two of them, alone in an office in the middle of the night, no longer high on adrenaline but Sherlock’s hands were still shaking. And then Joan coughed, shattering it all.
Make me.
“We had a career fair today.”
Sherlock asked, incredulous.
Hamish was deathly silent through John’s restrained tirade and he didn’t so much as flinch when John stood from the kitchen table. “Do you want to maybe tell your father what the fight was about, since you won’t tell me?” he prompted but the boy didn’t answer. John let out a huff and ran his left hand through his hair.
And then John was gone in a haze of tires and asphalt and the rope inside of Sherlock coiled so tightly he couldn’t breathe and he sunk to the ground.
“Oh, alright,” the woman said amiably. “Have a nice night.”
To: Here’sJonny@email.com
“But I don’t have any jammies or a toothbrush or my stuffed rabbit Paulie Peters Smith the Third,” the child complained and for all his brilliance, Mycroft had not one single answer to give.
“It’s true I have.”
“You’re really pissing me off. So I think the first thing I’ll do is get rid of that self-righteous attitude.”
Sherlock ran over to him while Sebastian was beating off figures in prison uniforms who had no faces but had batons. They were slowly coming out of the cells and soon they would be surrounded.
“What that satanic cat is trying to say is that that body you’re holding is only an empty vessel. Everything that is actually your friend is that soul gem you just threw,” answered Sebastian.
Greg had turned into a witch, soon after the arrival of a fifth contractor named Sebastian Moran who also knew the truth about witches. He was surprisingly on Sherlock’s side and Greg didn’t trust him very much either. Sherlock had asked Kyubey to invite him thinking that they had strength in numbers. What he ended up causing was just another tragedy. After Greg had turned into a witch from despair of the truths of the soul gems. Irene who didn’t seem to care or believe Sherlock or Sebastian had a sudden break down and in that moment after they all had to kill the witch Greg had become, she caught Sebastian off guard and destroyed his soul gem.
During lunch, Greg and John went to a more secluded part of the school while they ate. Molly who was still upset at them had decided to eat with Tom and the others inside while they snuck onto the roof.
Then he could see that the bound almost formless figure they had become began to disperse like little starlights, and Sherlock closed his eyes hoping that if he woke up again, John would be there too.
“I told you this was going to happen but you didn’t listen to me,” Sebastian said.
John went over to Greg who changed back into his civilian clothes.
“I can’t be with anyone right now Greg and you know that I just don’t… my dad is dying and it would either a miracle or magic to save him and that’s not going to happen. So please stop trying to be cheerful with me, don’t you know that it’s only causing me even more pain?!”
“It has to be that way. We’re the only one here that know about the whole magical contracts and witches nonsense. Who is going to save everyone from the witches now?”
“Put it down and leave this place,” Sherlock said taking a step forward.
Spinning around he saw Kyubey who was probably watching the whole exchange go down.
“Not at all. How about you John?”
“You don’t have any faily that notice you’ve been fighting witches?” John asked, worried about the time Sherlock must have spent fighting alone.
“I already told you that you got to fucking wait awhile longer before you can kill it. Are you stupid?” I thought that bitch would’ve at least taught you that.”
I am so so sorry, Greg Lestrade. I do love you but this just isn't your story for good things to happen to you. Original title to this was, "I'm sorry for inflicting a lot of damage onto a character who doesn't deserve it."
“Greg! Please Stop! Greg! Do you Remember?-
“You weren’t at school today,” John began, immediately hating himself for making that his opening line.
John shook his head no.
John began to let go and Harry did too, only clinging to his hand as he got up.
“Is this what you’ve been trying so hard not to say? Why didn’t you say anything!? This is vital information that we needed to know.”
John thought for a moment that Harry would still put up a fight but she released his hand. They didn’t say anything as he left.
“Of course. This city just can’t go to some idealistic child like him. He’ll end up dying a lot quicker that way if I don’t educate him.”
He wanted to go to him and help somehow but it seemed that there was just too much space between them. The urge to call out to him was strong but he couldn’t do anything but stand and watch in dismay as the boy was hurt once again. If there was only something he could do.
“Yes, you two were in a labyrinth yesterday. It’s always some type of distorted reality that the witch hides in as to defend itself and disorient its victims. Are you sure you want to go in?”
“That’s the problem, you’re always saying you won’t allow me to do things but it’s never been up to you. It’s time I take things into my own hands.”
“Right here,” John laughed, taking Hamish from Sherlock’s arms so the madman could pace the room.
“Oh for god’s sake, alright!” Sherlock gave up, turning around and walking to the front door. “You can come in and make sure I don’t drown in the shower. Stubborn, idiotic- where are my keys-“
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry bout that,” John excused and then Sherlock kissed him, all teeth and tongue. Sherlock never
“Oh my knickknacks,” he breathed out as he stared at the body. Mr. Humperdink, his fourth-favourite teddy-bear, was lying on the living room floor with a knife embedded deep in his soft, fluffy tummy. There were faint red smears on his fur by the knife and his glass eyes stared back eerily.
Sherlock was alone for a minute before John’s hands were on his wrist and he was being dragged through the lobby and up into an abandoned bathroom.
Hamish was silent a minute, most likely explaining it to himself, and then nodded. “I understand. May I have a train set instead?”
“Oh shut up,” he beamed and then kissed her again.
He never talked to anyone more than he could help it and John wondered if he might be lonely. But then one day he saw Sherlock clambering up to the top of the playground jungle-gym and standing there like a small bird and he realized Sherlock wasn’t just odd. He was
“Look at you,” he gasped out, pupils dilated, “I taught you so well.” And then with one smooth push Sherlock was hurtling into the open water.
“I’ll be outside,” he pledged. “But I’m not allowed in. You should feel very special.” In truth, Sherlock had refused to be present in the room. John knew it was because he couldn’t bear to hear her story.
“I’ll come in a minute, I wanna finish my project,” Hamish explained and Sherlock stood, stopping to brush a kiss across the boy’s forehead before retreating downstairs. John was ladling food out and looked up as Sherlock came in.
“So my mother always said,” Sherlock shrugged, aware this was the first time she’d ever mentioned her mother in front of Joan. “We came to Newport back in the early 1800s, though.”
Sherlock stood in the center of Joan’s living room and let Joan hold her body because she loved her, and that love was her choice to make, her gift to give.
There were an awkward few minutes as the goons sat complicity on the couch and Hamish tried to make stilted conversation. Armchair-goon tried to rush him at minute three but Hamish neatly fired at him. He’d been aiming for his leg but he went ridiculously wide. Recoil was unexpected but Hamish held himself through it and armchair-goon jumped appropriately.
“Fine. I just wanted to hear your voice was all.”
“So are you,” Joan added gently, and Sherlock almost believed her as she fell asleep.
How are you settling in?
“It’s beautiful,” Sherlock agreed.
“I don’t want you to be alone, okay?”
“Anything,” she said, as her left hand made contact with Joan’s breast beneath her bra. “Any of the- whatever we talked about. You can go down on me-”
“No,” John insisted, turning to help Harry redo his bandages. “Now, will you be okay?”
“Last night, after you left, Jamie tried to hook up with Sherlock,” she said.
“Out,” he ordered Sherlock and for a second Sherlock was terrified but then John shot him a grin and Sherlock felt his insides warm, felt his whole body warm.
“How much do we have?” John asks, frantic.
Alone is miserable.
John held back a laugh. “It could’ve been worse,” he reminded him, slinging an arm over the taller boy’s shoulder. “Scotland Yard could have seen the hickeys you left
John realized and that was it.
I think so. I’m not even sure, that’s part of why it hurts so much. But we haven’t talked in two weeks now. He says he needs space. Well actually he told me never to talk to him again but I’m pretending he just said he needs space.
“No I- my brother will worry,” she said, realizing just how true that was. “But, a different time?”
, she reminded herself in a stunned sort of voice.
“Yeah?” John asked, confused.
with Lestrade,” Sherlock insisted.
“She wants me to be happy,” he said and John reached out to squeeze his hand.
“You’re the only thing I’ve ever had worth having,” Sherlock confesses, kissing him, and that’s enough. It’s more than enough.
to where I shot and there’s this man-“
Sherlock sighed, burrowing deeper into John’s shoulder, and closed his eyes. “I don’t exactly fit in, John. Cocaine had an odd way of making me more…normal, if you’ll believe it.”
like she’d been praying Sherlock would say something. Instead she’d taken Sherlock’s hand and said,
He didn’t belong here and it felt like everyone around him knew it. He was, for a moment, deeply grateful for the costume he wore.
“Hey,” he smiled back. “You look so beautiful.”
“Do you remember,” Sherlock whispers, dangerously close, “the last time we danced like this?”
“So deduce her. Right now, with me,” he instructed and Hamish sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Dilated pupils?”
Hamish couldn’t speak. He’d come here with millions of questions but now he couldn’t find a single one in the mangled mess of his heart. Annemarie seemed to understand his silence perfectly though, like a true mother.
Sherlock shook his head and John went on. “Didn’t think so. I wasn’t gonna go, you know, cause of the dad thing, but it’s perfect. House parties are the perfect place for a first kiss. We’ll find you a perfect girl, sound good?”
“We have a medicine cupboard?” Sherlock asked, tilting his head the way he did sometimes when he was befuddled. It would have been adorable save the warm child in his arms.
“I can’t…give you…that,” he tried and it was the most inarticulate John had ever heard him. “But here-“
“Joan I- thank you,” Sherlock said later, as she sat on her customary locker room bench and the water rushed behind the yellow, plastic curtain. Joan poked her head out and grinned through the stream.
“A fish doesn’t know it’s in water until it’s not,” Sherlock said, his eyes pleading. “I never realized just how
John let out an almighty sigh and then turned to beam at his son. "Come here love, let me hug my baby," he ordered and Hamish came to sit next to him, handing off his daughter. She seemed to enjoy the toy treatment and crinkled her eyes endearingly at her grandfather.
“I don’t need to understand anything,” Sherlock growls and John turns to him.

“Your
“Hullo Hamish; nice scarf,” he greeted but Hamish merely waved him away.
Sherlock kept laughing and it was making John unreasonably angry, the sight of Sherlock flushed and laughing, black hair leaving ink stains on the carpet, that he rolled over and grabbed Sherlock by his open collar and kissed him, dragging him up to meet his lips.
, Sherlock thought before she could stop herself, never more grateful there was at least some kind of filter between her mind and her mouth. “No one will notice,” she smirked and it was Joan’s turn to push her.
This is just my fluffiness dump, hope that's cool with y'all :)
until the eleven-year old came in to tell a story at the edge of her bed. When she was eleven, Mycroft rarely ever found her sleeping, instead playing with test tubes and fires or reading some tome or another, and she’d greet him with a
“Eton doesn’t exactly take us on holidays,” Sherlock shrugged.
“Get me a pencil,” he ordered and Hamish stood.
“For your knees,” John explained and Sherlock just eyed him.
“Do you like them?” John asked and Sherlock chuckled, a low and soft sort of sound that made John’s heart hurt for indiscernible reasons.
The second goodbye is harder than the first was. They hold each other for a long moment at the airport, John rubbing soothing circles on Sherlock’s back. And then it’s just Sherlock, all alone. Alone protects him, he reminds himself. Alone is good.
He’s dimly aware that John is crying as he comes, Sherlock fingers wrapped around him, and he takes his shaking soldier into his arms and holds him, arms and legs forming a protective enclosure as John sobs against his chest and it’s Sherlock’s turn to card his fingers through John’s hair, rub circles on his back, murmur nonsense words in his ear until John draws in desperate gasps, lungs seeking air and Sherlock can breathe again.
Sherlock realized as John’s fingers traced patterns on his ankle.
“She just-“ Sherlock spluttered and John glanced around quickly before kissing Sherlock quickly on the stairs.
“That may be the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“Sally-“ John started softly and a look of complete betrayal and pain flashed across the lifeguard’s face before it was replaced with a self-deprecating smirk and those same angry eyes, clouded by rolling waves of pure hate. John had seen Sherlock direct that gaze at people rarely. He’d never thought it would be directed at him.
“Did everyone have a good time?” Cynthia asked and the four kids nodded, slumped on each other.
This was so cathartic to write, you have no idea.  I know these are supposed to be fluffy and this is! There is definite fluff in there- you just need to look very, very hard.
“It’s Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes,” she filled in, finally reaching out to shake Joan’s hand.
Subject: Bored
Cynthia and Harry were going with John, driving him to base, and as they loaded up the car, Sherlock felt like a failure. Harry and Mycroft hugged, and Cynthia and Victoria held hands. But John and Sherlock were passed all that.
“Well that’s sorted then,” John said, picking up a pair of sweatpants. He turned them over and then held them out. “Here, you want them back?” he offered, holding out Sherlock’s sweatpants.
They sit on her couch, pale white leather, and eat biscuits she made. The living room is the very picture of a happy family; photographs hang on the walls showing Jane with a smiling man, kissing, swimming, standing on beaches. Happy.
“Can you walk?” he checked and Harry nodded, face pained. Sherlock helped the boy limp into the shack. John turned to Mike and, after a wordless conversation, John ran after Sherlock into the shed while Mike stayed by the dock.
voice Daddy reminded him.
Sherlock comes home at twelve and John’s bedroom door is locked.
“You did say you have all night, yes?” he checked and Hamish’s own mouth split into a wide grin, reaching up to his eyes.
"Pa-" Hamish tried again but his father took mercy on him.
“Will you stay for Christmas dinner?” John asked but Sherlock shook his head.
Mycroft sighed, stirring the chocolate. “Your father believes I am lazy,” he confessed, glancing over at Hamish’s pot. “Check and see if that’s lukewarm yet,” he ordered and Hamish obeyed immediately. “We have similar gifts, mine are actually rather better than his, and he feels I am misusing mine.”
“Thanks! Sorry, it’s a bit loud in here, I can barely hear you. But I see you just fine!”
“Jesus. Got it, not allowed.”
John bent down lower to ease himself deeper, searching carefully for what the books he'd battered for and read told him he'd find. It took a while, Sherlock trying to keep still beneath him, but finally he found it and Sherlock’s eyes shot wide open as he arched up against John’s finger.
“He drew a lot, my father,” he said and John never faltered in his breathing against Sherlock’s ear. “We still have the canvasses upstairs in the attic somewhere.”
“No sorry, afraid I don’t see anything,” he said, his face impassive.
“Who says I type slowly?” John laughed as they waited at the corner for the light to change.
“I got you a coke,” she bribed and Chloe’s mouth twitched upwards in a hesitant smile. “Come, you’ll sit next to me. They brought you pillows so you can see over the table, just like a princess.”
“And remember how that ended,” John winked at him and Sherlock shut up.
When he was suitably clean, Violet led her grandson to the living room and sat him down on the sofa while she reached for a leather album. “Did you know that when your father was your age, he and your Uncle lived all alone up here?”
Third activity rolled around sooner than John had expected, and the sun was shining mercilessly as the B221 boys ran down the hill to the lake. John and Mike followed close behind, and John could see the lifeguards coming out to take the kids to get lifejackets and swimming out to take spots in the lake.
“My brother’s here,” he said gently and John glanced behind him to where a sleek black car sat. By the car lounged a tall, ginger-haired man, who was far skinner than John had expected, watching them avidly.

“Well then,” Sherlock urged, dusting himself off. “Shall we?”
“You want to come to mine?” Joan offered and Sherlock promptly shut up. “My mom’s out of town all week so I’ve got the whole place to myself.”
“You killed Mr. Humperdink!” he informed his uncle. “I found your fingerprint.”
“Bad?” Sherlock asked, quickly sliding off and John glared at him.
“Don’t lie to me,” Mycroft cautioned. “My job is to spot lies. I know you love Cambridge. What’s really going on?”
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” he offered uselessly, redundantly, but it loosened something in her. “It seems absurd to call that weakness though; wanting to take care of yourself. To feel safe.”
Wordlessly he padded over and let his hands ghost over the younger boy’s thin arms and chest, turning medical, looking for bruises, for track marks, for cigarette burns. Sherlock’s breath came out in a puff and John stopped, turning his attention to Sherlock’s face, his hair, his mouth, his eyes, before settling his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face.
“We managed okay,” Hamish pointed out and Chloe smacked his arm.
“Partner,” he explains as she lets him in. “He’s been back almost a year, and he’s still having-“ he struggles to quantify.

I'm so sorry this is late, my butterflies <3
That shouldn’t have been the least bit romantic and yet Sherlock found it warmed him a bit. He really was all cross-wired.
“Oh love,” he whispered, inches from Sherlock. “You composed something for me?”
Harry looked around. “Jesus, this place is big. Sure you can,” she breathed and let Mycroft take her hand and lead her down the garden paths.
“Because you cheated, Sherlock!” John’s furious now, and Sherlock can’t help how happy that makes him. “I didn’t.”
“What does feminism have to do with the war?”
,” John groaned, smiling up at Sherlock and the younger boy grinned back, a soft haziness filling the air around them.
Hamish stared entranced at the performance, his eyes wide in wonderment. Sherlock looked over proudly. Hamish was by far the youngest in the audience and perhaps the most well behaved, his back perfectly straight as he watched.
“Hey Shulamith!” Sherlock called and before Joan could properly hit her, or even properly react at all, Shulamith had turned around and smiling, detached from her friend and pushed her way over to them.
“Hamish? I have the results,” Greg said loudly over the phone.
Sherlock shrugged, the very picture of indifference. “We’ll figure something out,” he offered and then approached the counter and asked for two tickets. John reached for his wallet but Sherlock shot him such a glare that he gently slid it back into his pocket. That answered that question.
“Well Mr. Starship commander, do you think we can fix this?” Hamish said in his deepest voice, moving his spaceman action figure up and down.
Oh, that’s obvious. He’s texting a crush.
fell short.
Sally looked distinctly uncomfortable. “Boss,” she whispered, inching closer, as Hamish grew more and more upset.
Bushwick was not the sort of neighborhood you went wandering around in at just past 2 am but, here they were, dressed in black and sneaking around the back of the chain-link fence. Sherlock glanced behind her, where she was dropped in a crouch by the wire, to glare at her partner in crime.

“Sounds lovely.”
Now it’s John’s turn to look offended. “I think it’s rather good,” he mumbles and Sherlock’s laugh rumbles against his chest.
, he said the words he’d been thinking since the day he’d opened that package at Eton.
It was barely a kiss at all, just a moment of pressure, a note of softness, before Joan was pulling back- wide-eyed and gaping, trying uselessly to form words.
, his brain, ever the voice of reason, reminded him.
“And me. Oh, you think you’re so clever, sitting over there deducing things about me. You’re wrong of course, wrong on all counts. You’re eyeing the bruises on my collar, think I’m abused. You’re considering calling child services. Don’t bother, they’re not bruises, and you’d know what they were if you had had sex in the last four months. But you don’t because you haven’t and you’re a shite detective who thinks I’m just a “kid”.”
Sherlock stared at him. “Okay?” he repeated stupidly, not expecting it.
“I don’t think he’ll mind,” she promised, and Sherlock looked at her, still a bit dizzy. Joan was stood by the toilet, running her hands up and down Sherlock’s arm underneath the towel to try and dry her, as she stood herself in sopping wet clothes. Joan had jumped into the shower in her jeans and flannel and they clung to her as she struggled to warm Sherlock up. She must be uncomfortable, Sherlock thought, but Joan was only watching her and smiling a little and Sherlock didn’t have the energy to hate her, as much as she wanted to. Maybe she would tomorrow, but not tonight.
“You just came to my dirty talk,” John muttered, shaking his head and following the blushing teen out. “You really are a kinky bastard.”
There was dinner, Chinese, and after they ate, Lestrade went home. John spent a bit of time touching Hamish’s arm and shoulders and kissed him on the forehead before he went up to bed, which he hadn’t done in a while.
“I just want to
“It’s hot,” Hamish noted as they walked out of the airport and towards the parking lot. “And sunny.”
“Bitchin,” Joan beamed. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go put some clothes on.”
“She’s happy, Daddy,” Hamish explained in an eight-year-old’s version of a whisper and Sherlock swallowed.
Sally had the decency to blush, up to the roots of her hair. “I didn’t mean it badly you know,” she offered, looking down. “I was just worried about you.”
She needed space; she needed distance to gain some impartiality in her diagnostic. And yet, the thought of not seeing Joan for a few hours- let alone a few days- made her feel close to actual, physical illness. Whatever this was, she’d have to figure it out moment to moment, in the heat and thickness of things.
“Bored,” he groaned hair in his eyes.
Which is why John was fully unprepared for Sherlock showing up at the door to his cabin at 10pm two weeks after the blowjob in the bathroom.
And then fireworks went off behind them and they both let out honest, incredulous laughs. “No,” Chloe giggled, shaking her head, as bright colored explosions lit up the night sky. “That did not just happen.”
Neither was surprised as they turned down the path that led to the lake and when they reached the rocky shore, they both crashed down on the soft grass.
Hamish stared unrelentingly. “Because that’s your instrument. I want to play something else.”
“Hear me Sherlock, we will get you your first kiss if it’s that last thing we do,” John laughed from behind him.
John sighed, tugging down Sherlock’s rumpled shirt. “He’s six, Sherlock. He has more energy now than he will for the rest of his life.” He let go, glancing upstairs worriedly.  “Maybe I should take them to the park.”
“So what did you do during thunderstorms?” Hamish asked. Lighting took that very moment to strike and the clap of accompanying thunder sent a jump through the small child.
“Course I blame myself,” John said, turning on the boy.
“To quote the pig, I’m just going to be myself,” he finished and Hamish looked ready to burst into tears.
“All children must grow up, John,” his mum told him after he’d confided in her his dream. She took a long drag on her cigarette before she continued, clutching the small white thing between her fingers. She had worn hands, with pink chipped nail-polish and nicotine stains.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock called back. ‘I just-“ he was cut off by the sound of retching.
John ran a hand through his hair, let himself have one more look at Sherlock naked and silken across his bed, and then shuffled off to have a very cold shower.
"Back at work and happy to escape," Hamish joked. "This one's
Use your imagination, you berk
“Never mind, wait till your father comes home,” Sherlock cut him off, shivering internally.
“This is my mobile number, okay?” John instructed and Hamish took it with careful hands. “You call me if you need me and I’ll always pick up for you. Promise. Now give your Papa a hug.”
her mind insisted and Sherlock let out an almighty sigh. It wasn’t general at all. It was very Joan-specific.
. I just-“
Victor turns white and Sherlock comes back in, bearing penguins and staring in utter confusion at the practically domineering look on John’s face.
“We can take her,” Sherlock said suddenly, speaking up for the first time since they’d found the girl, hog-tied, in the basement of an abandoned cellar. They’d been hunting down a ring of child traffickers for weeks now and she was the first lucky break they’d had.
,” Sherlock teased, holding his voice low and steady, and it was John’s turn to lick his lower lip.
John spun around. “Christ Sherlock, don’t point that at me,” John cried, stepping back.
Love that one
“Amazing, isn’t it?” Chloe smiled, watching his face. “Now let’s go. We gotta get you a wand.”
“This is lovely,” John smiled at him softly as the waiter walked off to get their food. “We haven’t had dinner together like this in-“
“Yeah, I think, he’s just throwing up in the bathroom is all,” Mike said and John found his shirt on the floor, pulling it on.
“Oh fuck, we better go, it’ll take us ages to get the train out there,” Joan cursed and they were off, arms brushing, the same excitement about them and who needed marches and Washington when they could have
I suggested it. I didn’t think he’d actually do it.
“Absolutely perfect,” John smiled, examining his work. Sherlock quickly stripped into pajamas and John followed, pulling on sweatpants before climbing into the mega-sleeping bag alongside Sherlock.
I sent you the letter.
Sherlock was fond of calling people idiots. It had always been a passion of his, but ever since he’d had Hamish, he’d taken greater pleasure in it. Mostly because now he could say they spoke with less wisdom than his eight-year-old.
Sherlock looked to Joan on her right, and the blonde smiled at her that same, nervous smile. Surprising herself, Sherlock reached out and took Joan’s hand. Joan looked shocked but didn’t let go, turning her palm to better grasp Sherlock’s own. Their hands were cold from the walk but began to warm quickly as the women quieted down and the woman leading this meeting began to speak.
in him. It felt more intimate than sex had.
“Speaking of grades, congratulations on Cambridge," Mycroft smiled knowingly. "Accepted as long as you get, was it all A*?”
“No,” Sherlock said, taking it back from John’s hands. “I can get more, that won’t do anything. I like to keep it though. Remind myself-“
“I don’t like it,” he repeated. “I just don’t want to spend my last year before uni stuck in a class I hate.”
“I’ll go shower,” Hamish smiled, turning to walk towards the lockers, but stopped at the call of his Dad.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I promise,” he said and he let his mind delete the list, let it delete everything that didn’t matter until there was enough space in his mind for John to have his own room, his own floor,
Of course. John should have realized he couldn’t even hold a candle to a burn victim. With a resigned sigh, he sticks his hands in his pocket and walks home.
“Sherlock, stop it!”
“Unbelievable,” he ground out. “I keep you from getting expelled and now
“It makes perfect sense,” he said, speaking over Donovan. “We’re all set up to take care of an eight-year-old; Hamish’s room has a trundle bed. John and I are perfectly capable of keeping a child safe and if you’re worried, I can have my brother increase surveillance on our flat.”
Close enough.
Chloe considered this question for a minute. “I think I’d wanna be a carrot,” she offered.
“I don’t think he was scared,” Sherlock pointed out.
You slay me
“Shit,” he whispered as he took out his mobile to call Sarah. “Shit shit shit.”
“Yes?” she teased, all hard angles and soft skin and god, he wanted to
or one day you might need his help.”
“I mean, we all suspected but Christ-“
“Did the posh Sherlock Holmes just curse?” he laughed but Sherlock was so incredibly blissed out he could barely reply.
“They look like you and John,” she continued, as if he hadn’t spoken. “Little blonde helplessly following the dashing raven-haired boy. But only one is yours, unless I missed something.”
Joan and Mary had gone back to kissing, sloppy now that Joan was properly drunk, with Mary’s hand in her hair and both their eyes closed. And yet, still, Joan kept hold of her hand tight in her small one, their fingers interlocked since they’d left the bar. There was probably something
“You don’t let up, do you?” John laughed. He sighed, rolling his shoulders, and Sherlock heard them pop.
“We could… stay here a while,” Sherlock suggested, crawling up to rest his head against John’s chest.
“Perhaps I should invest more time in learning the names of plants,” Sherlock puzzled and then stopped as John reached up to put something in his hair.
“I’m sorry,” she says again, silent tears running down her face. “I shouldn’t have, I know, I’m sorry. I just-“
“Bushwhick,” Joan replied. “It’s only like a half-hour on the M.”
John finds an advertisement for work at a surgery and goes in, taking his cane along. He needs something to do, anything at all. Anything to escape his prison.
The lifeguard gazed at John with what could only be described as fondness. “I live in Windsor ten months out of the year,” he reminded John but John only smiled.
“All wonderful things begin tragically,” Sherlock mused softly, face leaning in gently towards John’s, like a plant reaching for the sun.
John smiled. “I try,” he said and the lifeguard gazed at him, face unreadable. Finally, he stuck out a hand.
“I’m not really a drinker-“ she started to protest but Marcie waved her off.
for last night, please don’t-“
“You’re right, I don’t have friends,” Sherlock said softly, not looking down. “Just the one.”
he reminded himself
Sherlock couldn’t breathe. “No,” he protested softly and John laughed, reaching out to ruffle his hair. Sherlock held still through the whole of it, not quite believing the warm pressure on his skull was real.
“It is both those things.”
Hamish nodded and then looked aghast as he placed his father’s earlier anger, at coming home to the flat he shared with the loving family he’d built painstakingly for himself only to hear a reminder of just how lonely he’d once been.
But they had to let go and Harry was tugging at John’s jeans and with a soft wave, Sherlock in his black car sped away.
John didn’t have anywhere particularly to stay, so he stayed in Sherlock’s apartment, sleeping on the ridiculously expensive and ridiculously uncomfortable couch. He was strikingly aware of how pathetic this was, the fact that he couldn’t even raise any sort of response from his family, and if Sherlock heard him yelling into his pillow late at night, he never mentioned it over breakfast tea.
“You,” Richards hissed, face a deep red and eyes hot, “are making some seriously disturbed accusations.”
That's it. We update Fridays, it's official.
“We still have time,” John insisted.
“Of course,” Sherlock promises, sucking at tanned flesh, and John moans against him, hips digging deeper.
It was an absolute dream. John held Sherlock’s hand as they went from booth to booth. John was a crack shot, it appeared, and an hour in, he won Sherlock an oversized bear.
“Hamish,” Mycroft called gently, laying a hand on the child’s back and the boy stirred, opening his eyes. “Your father is one the phone.”
“I have his name you know,” John said softly and Sherlock looked up.
he wanted to ask.
That was not at all the reaction Hamish had planned in his head so he decided to just stick to the script he’d prepared. “Hello ma’am, my name is-“
“Never say goodbye because goodbye means going away,” the genius murmured into John’s coat as they hugged in the backseat, “and going away means forgetting.”
They were lying in John’s bed, Sherlock’s head on John’s chest and John’s fingers running patterns through Sherlock’s hair as rain pounded outside the Manor windows.
“Never is an awfully long time.”
“Irrelevant,” John shot back and Sherlock beamed at him in utter surprise at the use of his favorite word. “You hardly need to seduce me. I love you.”
“That’s it, I’m getting the monsters spray,” John conceded, walking to the kitchen.
“Oh, I remember that,” a voice spoke up from behind them and Hamish turned to squeal and jump from the couch into his Uncle’s arms. Mycroft hefted him up, as easy with him as though he’d always held the boy.
“Watch your language; my son is on the phone,” his Pa ground out and Hamish grinned. “Tell him we love him and he’ll do marvelous!”
“You’re still perfect, Daddy,” he promised and Violet looked at her boys and wondered when this had become her life.
Mycroft struggled to remember the boy’s monikers for his parents. “Your…Papa,” he said hesitantly and Hamish reached out for the phone. Mycroft handed it to him and he held it to his ear, lodged between his cheek and the pillow.
“We could do a ‘speriment! Or make tea! Can we make tea?” Hamish called out over Sherlock’s shoulder as the taller man carried him up to bed. He was back a minute later, flopping back on top of John with reckless abandon.
“Yeah, while you were still at Eton, that’s three years ago now, right?”
“And, what do you think?”
“Oi, git,” John laughed, landing on top of Sherlock. “Get out of my face.
“Hamish, people can’t belong to other people,” John said pointedly, ignoring the look Sherlock gave him. “Chloe is not ours. She was staying with us while she needed us. But now she needs to go back to her family.”
“I forgot how amazing this is,” John panted, struggling to sit up and lean back against a tree. “Indoor pushups are not nearly this taxing.”
“Just put them in my room if you must,” she sighed finally, going back to her newspaper and John fled the room as fast as he could without being entirely too suspicious.
“Of course I called Mycroft on you. I was worried sick, I thought you hurt yourself, I thought-“
they were and a sudden terror gripped him.
Cynthia flushed, the very picture of her son, and Grimsbey pulled the car up and held the door open as they piled in.  Sherlock fell asleep on the ride back to the hotel and John helped him climb the stairs, sleep-heavy and disorientated.
“Okay, love.”
Later, much later after Mycroft had pulled them both into his study and locked the door and placed the thick, mahogany desk against it. Once Sherlock had sat down on the floor, garbage pail between her knees, and Mycroft sat with his back against the desk leg, facing her. Then they began to scheme.
“Hamish,” John demanded in his no-nonsense voice and Hamish relented.
“I know, I
, we’re busy!”
"Okay, okay," Hamish begged off and John smirked at him. A menace indeed.
But the enthusiasm of fifteen fourth-graders was a hard thing to tap down and every good counselor knew you practically mimicked your kids’ energy. So John enjoyed his bus ride, with Jordan in the seat next to him, Chris singing The Most Annoying Song behind him with Harry and Jason and Sam telling jokes to the G221 girls and being abominable flirts. Sherlock hadn’t gotten on the bus with them; the lifeguards were riding in the camp van with the rest of the staff, like a nurse and two “wilderness experts.” John didn’t know if he was relieved or upset.
“Suit yourself,” he huffed and then turned around, not even bothering to look if Sherlock was following. “Let’s go then.
“Which one?” Cynthia asked, smiling at her friend.
was the one being fucked, even though
“Not a child,” Sherlock reminded him.
“She just said you’d…used,” John tried softly, hoping the violent boy would calm down. “I didn’t believe her until I-“
“Perfect,” Sherlock said and Joan looked back to smile softly at her. Sherlock settled herself at the small wooden table and finished the letter as Joan threw various things in a pot and hummed to herself. She set a cup of tea in front of Sherlock at some point and Sherlock hummed back and soon enough the letter was sealed and addressed and Joan was spooning out two bowls and bringing them over to the table.
“Have a nice day,’ he said pleasantly and they left.
-call disconnected-
“Sorry about that kiddo, but we can’t have you screaming on us,” the man shrugged and Hamish screamed useless around his muffle. He felt himself start to cry and the man clucked his tongue. “Oh, now don’t cry little one. You’ll be back with your dads quick as a wink,” the man hushed and Hamish started to panic.
“When did you realize you were bisexual?” Sherlock asked clinically, tracing patterns on John’s stomach through his shirt. It bothered Sherlock how many layers of clothes there were between them but he wasn’t going to be the first to remove anything. John made all the first moves, it was safer that way.
“I discovered narcotics when I was fourteen,” Sherlock confessed and John realized suddenly that Sherlock, professional ice-man and deferrer, was
“He is,” he promised. “And he loves having people over. Would you like to stay with him for a few days?”
“Not to assume, but in the spirit of full disclosure,” he tells her as they walk down the stairs, “I’m taken.”
“I’m fine, it was nice,” Sherlock pacified. “What about you, you sober enough for this?”
John seemed to deflate like a balloon. “Where’s Hamish?” he asked, unconcerned. The boy had had the run of this building since he was three; he wasn’t about to get lost. “The vending machine is just downstairs.”
now and that was what mattered. But Sherlock was Sherlock and he liked answers to all his questions, even ones not deemed necessary.
“I need to go.”

Ever since her deep think that night after the botched meeting and the investigation in Long Island, she’d started paying more attention to Joan, if such a thing were possible. What
“Hm,” Sherlock mused, aware of vibrations under his hand as a car approached. “I wanted to re-construct the third Ripper murder.”
“I didn’t understand it,” Sherlock admitted and that was hard, admitted his lack of knowledge. “But I do now and I know that I want you, I want you to be a
“Pretty ugly, isn’t it,” John said stiffly at Sherlock’s lingering stare and Sherlock suddenly noticed the scar, red and jagged, that graced John’s shoulder.
“Do you know what he told me?” Mycroft informed the boys. “Once, when our paths crossed in person. He told me he’d burn the heart out of me.”
of camp drifted in through the bunk’s open windows. Groaning, he got up and stretched, padding down in his flip-flops and towel to the tiny showers in the back of the bunk. The water was cold, naturally, and John sighed as he set to sponging out soap and cleaning his body in the miniscule stall.
A soft noise at his door woke him slowly but he still wasn’t very cognizant as a warm body crawled across his bed and struggled to curl into him. Still half-asleep, he let go of John and moved to curve his body to accommodate the new visitor.
“John!” Sherlock called desperately, and John paused with his hand on the door handle. But Sherlock had nothing to say. He just didn’t want John to leave.
Joan had said all that in an even tone, not a raised word or hidden battle cry within it. Still, when she finished, the room burst into applause and snaps and cries of “totally boss.” Sherlock felt like applauding herself, honestly, and nodded quickly to show she understood. Joan was a red mess but smiling and waited for the room to calm down.
He dressed Hamish slowly, running large hands down his sides and through his hair. Hamish’s tears slowed to a mere trickle and then a standstill, silent as Sherlock repeated his mantra.
That was, until, just past 7pm as they stood happily helping each other root through garbage, when Joan glanced at her watch and jumped right out of the neat pile they’d created.
Sherlock blinked. Slightly overcome, she nodded and Joan smiled gently. “See, was that so hard?” she encouraged, reaching up on tip-toe to retrieve the first-aid kit from atop the lockers and Sherlock was afforded a bloody
“Sherlock!” John yells as he tries to ignore the utterly crippling pain that shoots through him from his balls as he’s suddenly cut off seconds before orgasm. “Where the hell are you going?”
“Why are you saying thank you?” Sherlock asked in shock.
“I would not go mental,” Sherlock objected, coming closer at a more sedate pace. He took in Hamish with a quick glance as if to assure himself his son was safe and then went back to sulking. Typical.
It’s just kind of hard to talk about really. Yeah, it’s about Sherlock. How did you even guess that?
She was still caught in the doorway so she took the finals steps into the apartment and closed the door behind her. Signs of Mycroft’s worrying were everywhere, tread-marks in the worn carpet, unfolded button-up on the arm of the sofa, telephone at an angle from where he’d picked it up and set it down and picked it up again before realizing there was no one he could even call.
“You close your eyes and sleep, Daddy and I will be right here,” he eased, brushing back his son’s hair and Hamish blinked sleepily at him.
John wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, holding each other, but eventually he opened his eyes and they were in Sherlock’s bed, Sherlock head on his chest and John’s fingers in his hair and everything was exactly as it was supposed to be.
The surgery had been a fucking nightmare, flu season was in bloody swing, and he’d had to pick up milk on the way back after Sherlock texted him to. So it took him a good two minutes to notice Sherlock’s birth control sitting in its circular container in the middle of the mess that was their table.
But Sherlock doesn’t have long to wonder before John is getting off the bed and moving towards his drawers.
Hamish shook his head. “Grammy?” he asked, skeptical.
John’s eyes rake him up and down and for some reason it warmed him, instead of scaring him as it should have.
“Shut up,” and, just like that, it felt like everything was going to be okay.
Mike’s eyebrows shot up. “Are you hooking up with someone?” he asked, voice low and glancing around to make sure none of the smaller children had heard.
“You’re better off without me,” she said, picking on herself good-naturedly. “You have enough to worry about without trying to get me to be coordinated. As it is, you guys are almost good.”
“Puppy love,” Sherlock sneered disgustedly at his brother’s back. “Utterly horrid.”
“You had better,” she threatened and then Sherlock watched her run away into the retreating darkness, waist-deep in garbage. Some metaphors were too obvious for even her to make.
of it.”
Sherlock was standing by the flat door with a duffle bag containing the body of the late Mr. Humperdink and a small box. “Your Papa thought you might need this now that it’s getting colder,” his father explained and Hamish took the box in excited hands to unveil a small, blue scarf.
“I’m so sorry,” she brushed as he bent to get her phone. “Thank you so much.”
“Mugging,” John said softly and Sherlock unconsciously leaned in close to hear. He could
. “Is he okay?”
“Then we clearly do not get together enough,” the pale boy resolved and John grinned back.
Beneath him, Sherlock was looking mutinous. “Oh yes! I have a really ‘portant question and I woulda asked Uncle Mycroft only he couldn’t answer on account of how he’s having a meeting with a really nice man named David Camcorder I think but he told me I could just call him David and they’re in the study and I'm not ‘posed to bother them so I had to call you and you said I could call you if I needed to and-“
Just as predicted, alarms began to sound in her head.
John looked him dead in the eye. “It’s Portuguese for “Love me, my darling.””
It turned out having a six-year-old in house was not a particularly challenging task at all, provided you had skynet. Honestly, he had no idea why his brother complained about it so much. Hamish had been content to sit on his couch mindlessly watching telly for the past three hours, pausing only to eat some pasta the housekeeper sent up.
“What are you doing here?” John gaped, still having the good sense to whisper. “I thought the lifeguards went back to camp?”
“Because you’re too bossy,” Hamish informed him honestly. He then turned back to John, eyes expectant. “Okay partner. Where do we start?”
“Did you post it? I hadded to ask Mrs. Teacher how to spell ‘fuel efficient’ and also how to spell ‘personable,’” he explained, his legs swinging enthusiastically.
“I want eat with Papa,” Hamish decided, refusing to be moved.
“I’m walking back to camp John,” Sherlock sighed and John could have hit him. “You might want to figure out a ride because if you attempt to follow me, I will poison you.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said quickly and then thought about it a minute. For all its ridiculousness and falsity, there was something…good about people thinking she and Joan were together. About people assuming that she, Sherlock, was not just capable and worthy of love but of star-student, captain, school hero Joan Watson’s love. “I don’t mind, really.”
Did you tell them it was your incredibly sexy, hunk of a boyfriend?
“What is that, three this month?” he asks her, drinking.
” John asked in wonderment.
“No you’re not.”
is what Sherlock had said, and Joan- who was good and right and the very best thing Sherlock had ever had- had been perfect about this too. She hadn’t said
John flushed instinctively; immensely grateful the observant genius was not paying attention. “Sherlock, I’m not leaving your STI results on the table,” he demanded and Sherlock finally looked up, a faint smile playing at the corner of her lips. She looked like she always did on days when she didn’t plan on leaving the house; her black hair up in a mess of a bun, pyjama bottoms and tee-shirt hanging loose and unflatteringly on her thin frame. And yet all John could imagine was
John was silent. He wanted to ask to take it back, to make excuses, to beg
“Many reasons,” he confessed. “Most I would never tell you about, because I am your father and you are my son and you should not know everything about my life. But mostly because I had not yet found my calling and I was lost. I did not have the…support system your father and I have tried to create for you. I was rather alone.”
*phone call 12:34 am*
Sherlock woke with a pounding in his head, cotton in his mouth, and a sinking feeling in his gut that took him a moment to place.
“Sure thing,” John said, swimming back a pace to watch. At the mention of John, Sherlock’s head swiveled towards the water and stayed rooted there. John could feel his cheeks go hot, despite the cool water, as Sherlock’s gaze never wavered.
"And still, the greatest thing we ever did was raise you."
John leaned in so the two could bump noses and Hamish giggled against his cheek. “Because you won’t let us sleep in the house,” he chided, laughing as he smothered the boy’s face in kisses. “And you and Uncle Mycroft will have your own sleepover, yeah?”
Hamish’s first thought was that his father was not going to be happy about someone rifling through his things. The second thought was that he was in very big trouble.
“I only worry, I should walk in and find you two, so warnings would be nice-“
“Was Washington like this?” Sherlock asked, curious.
John sighed. “My second time was with this girl Sarah, she’s in my year. It was quite nice actually, but we didn’t really work out. Still good friends though,” he confessed and it didn’t take a genius to put the pieces together.
” he moaned as Sherlock’s tongue, generally reserved for the scathing of small children, idiots, and Mycroft, made John’s nerve endings light on fire.
There was quiet in the room, the two girls lost in Sherlock’s memories, as the final pieces came together. Sherlock started school at Bushwick High that September, almost nine months after they fled.  She kept her head down for a full year. Let herself be pushed around in the halls and didn’t say anything to anyone in class. Took a summer job at a convenience store where they paid her in cash and didn’t ask for any forms of ID. And then came Joan Watson.
“Bloody hell, that was nearly the equivalent of you throwing yourself naked at me,” he wondered, eyes bright and Sherlock shrugged, a bit put out.
“You just don’t like her because she takes me from you,” John laughed. He reached out and took Sherlock’s hand from where it angrily gripped the chains and squeezed it. “Don’t worry,” he promised. “You’ll always be my best mate, no matter what happens.”
, because it was particularly challenging and they needed more practice.) But finally,

“You did.”
“Alright,” John agreed and then he began to

John looked like he wanted to punch him, and if not for his small children, Sherlock was sure he would have. Instead, he snarled, “You let me believe you were dead all these years.”
“Sorry, right,” he said flustered and took John back in, that tiny pink mouth stretched out so sinfully just for him and the image alone drove John to the edge.
"The cottage might have to wait, seeing as we'd like to stay in London for a little bit longer," he filled in, winking at his granddaughter who watched him with rapt, large eyes. "But maybe we'll buy it anyway and go up during the summers. Although if we do invest in the bees, I'll want to be with them year-round to monitor hive development. Maybe weekends? I'll have to talk it over with your father- you'll act surprised when we finally tell you, yes?"
“Christ,” John swore and the older boy turned to stare at him. “I just- I don’t want you getting hurt Mycroft.”
As his father fished out his wallet to hand him a few quid, John turned back to his uncle. “Yes alright. But we’re ordering takeout from the yard; Sherlock hasn’t eaten since last night.”
“Christ, I shouldn’t have yelled at you both,” he said softly, running a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry.”
Well, all my teachers said I was incredibly creative.
She flushed, pushing back a loose strand of hair. “I brought some wine-“ she offered and then John’s voice rang down.
-“ Sherlock begged and then he shuddered as he came, his body going limp in the water and John’s eyes widened. Once Sherlock had calmed down, John spoke hesitantly.
Hamish smiled. “Thanks,” he said again and then he left, closing the door behind him. There was a warm feeling in Sherlock chest that felt like his heart was breaking and growing simultaneously. He wasn’t sure how to classify it so he stuck in his mind palace under “being a parent.”
“Let’s-” Joan said, once they’d managed to stop kissing, and by some negotiation they helped each other off the couch.
“I love you,” John whispered.
too, like a flood. It was glorious. You were glorious,” he confessed. “I thought I was going to lose you.”
John’s heart nearly burst with the weight of that kind of trust. “Thank you,” he said earnestly. “I’d tell you about me, but you already know everything.”
“Well you certainly get your brains from your fathers,” she chuckled and Hamish laughed along. “Just turned eighteen last month, yeah?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg reddened. “Just the end of it, sorry. But what I saw was fantastic,” he confessed. “I actually came to collect your parents. We need their statements on the two men they pulled in.”
. “It’ll be hard yeah but I don’t want to break up? Is that was we call this?”
"What?"
Victoria Holmes didn’t quite know what to make of the change in her youngest son, who now walked as though he was on clouds, who slept and ate without being asked, who
Did he
“And you believed him?” Mycroft laughed bitterly and John’s heart felt like it was shattering.
“You too?” Victoria said in the voice John called
He stood there, shivering and shaking in Mycroft’s own t-shirt and so the man strode over and did the thing he’d been absolutely petrified of doing since the boy had been born. He picked Hamish up.
“How are you not excited?” John crowed, smiling at the younger boy. “Waterparks are the best.”
“Yeah Sherlock?”
“You’re not lazy,” Hamish objected, fishing out the electric mixer and plugging it in. “You run a government.”
“Sure,” he called back before he had a chance to think about it. And then a thought hit him, later than it should have
Sherlock looked at him, turning his head so their eyes could meet over waves of carpet. “But you must be Wendy,” Sherlock told him seriously. “You will always be Wendy and I will always be Peter. That’s how it’s supposed to be.”
” John muttered, his pupils getting wide at the mental image, even though it was much too soon.
(See the end of the chapter for
The brothers glanced at each other in silent conversation before getting up and finding their respective instruments. There was a moment of pure tension as Mycroft looked up from the piano and Sherlock looked over his violin and then they began to play.
“What?” he asked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said loudly. “Papa’s coming home,” and it was like a marionette having its strings cut. Hamish still sobbed, great heaving things, but he no longer kicked back against his father but relaxed nearly boneless in his arms.
“Back in Rhode Island,” Joan asked pleasantly, did
“John,” Sherlock whispered and moved no closer.
She must have known, Sherlock thought, what she looked like down there and in fact Joan was meeting her eyes with the barest hint of a smirk but it was tempered with so much love and patient devotion, and with her pupils blown black, barely a sliver of blue even visible. Sherlock nodded and together they worked her underwear off, setting it to the side of the bed before Joan leaned in and set a small kiss at the top of the mound of wiry curls.
“Hello pot, have you met kettle?” Sherlock whispered back but Mycroft was already striding out to meet the girl, his intended “playmate.” She was tall with a mess of brown hair, in torn jeans and a shirt that showed a taunt stomach and a pierced bellybutton. But Mycroft didn’t falter for a moment
John stood, stretching. “We really need to work on your censoring,” he muttered, shuffling into the kitchen to make dinner.
“Brilliant,” John repeated, marveling at the teen.
They stay to wave Clara and Harry off as they head to the airport in a car. Then they get a cab of their own and go home, back to Sherlock’s flat in London. Mycroft’s staying with them for the night and they share Sherlock’s room, not at all considerate about their noise levels.
-disconnected-
"Sherlock-" John tried, his heart not even close to in it, and Hamish felt like his was floating, like there was a balloon beneath his ribcage keeping his feet from touching the ground, like he was the boy who'd gotten everything he'd ever wanted. And in the end, that was all it took.
He never expected, not in a million years, to look out into the audience at graduation and find, nestled between his Mummy and Harry, a blonde haired boy with tanned skin and bright eyes shining with pride. It takes everything he has not sod Eton and jump off stage.
“I’ll be
He was just taking the thermometer out as Sherlock strode back in, a child’s mug full of tea in his hands. “38 and a half,” John noted, lifting it under the lamp. “He’s running a fever is all.”
and it certainly wasn’t fair.
Sherlock folded into John like a piece of paper, weightless and boneless, begging to be absorbed. He didn’t ask John to stay, John deserved to be happy. But that was all he
Sherlock may have been abrupt, but he was gentle, John had to give him that. He worked John slowly, stretching and, after he’d added a second finger, scissoring the muscle open. He was murmuring things as he worked and it took John a while to realize they were
“We’ll get through it. Couples do all the time. We’ll get through it,” John says, mostly to himself than to Sherlock.
“Friend of mine,” Sherlock said and the boys laughed.
wouldn’t have wanted to kiss that.
“Yes! Oh John!” he started and then stopped himself.
“Why do I have to be Wendy Darling?” he complained, clutching at the metal chains, rocking back and forth on his toes, sending the swing inches in place.
“Why?” Hamish asked, unnaturally perceptive, and Sherlock would have bristled with pride if he hadn’t been so uncomfortable.
“I might just come right now,” he groaned and John took that as a challenge accepted. He reached down, fumbling in the darkness for a minute, before he popped Sherlock’s ridiculously tight pants open, and let his fingers brush against Sherlock’s clothed erection, prompting a small sob from the teen.
“You look ridiculous,” she said instead as Joan spun in a circle and fully ignored her. “He knows I’m gonna stay, California dreamin’ on such a winter’s day.”
Hamish shook his head. “It’s cold outside,” he grumbled. “And rainy.”
“I would never bother with something as useless as love unless I was sure,” Sherlock says dryly, scared of where this is going.
“Sounds like a fancy way of saying you’re gonna go watch some submarine racing,” Kelsie said and the pack of girls erupted into howls as Joan kept walking forward, the middle finger of her free hand waving goodbye. She waited until they’d turned the corner before releasing Sherlock and the genius resolutely stamped out the thought that she missed the warmth.
“Alright then, baby. I’m going to go, okay?”
“Please shut up,” Hamish begged and mercifully, they both complied. “Fathers, I love you,” Hamish said, starting over. “You have both been the most wonderful parents any child could ask for. I have never wanted anything more than you two; I need that to be clear. This has nothing to do with your parenting; god can only imagine what kind of person I’d be if I hadn’t grown up in the perfectly insane house.
Don't worry. There's plenty of time for proper drunk sex before the summer's over ;)
“I need to get you home,” he said instead, because it was all he could do. “Can you walk?”
“You are in very big trouble, little man,” John informed him as Sherlock bent down to pick the boy up. He cut a skinny figure in green train pyjamas with his hair still wet from his bath and he stared at John with big brown eyes.
“My my, what do we have here? Two handsome boys in need of some rescuing?” she said with a teasing grin.
The strangers were stunned because the boy’s appearance in front of them began to change and a strange and suffocating atmosphere enveloped them.
“You did but there’s something called timing do you understand? There was no way they would’ve wanted to listen to me when he was fucking moping all over the place, that would have just led to another fight and I didn’t think that would make you happy. And I can’t just show up at your school because what if a fight broke out there too? Did you fucking think about that?”
“Definitely not. Kyubey here made it happened,” she answered motioning to the creature who she finished healing.
“I didn’t want to fight you but you leave me no choice.”
Sherlock was crying over John’s body, Magnussen was destroyed but at what cost?
Yep unlike Kyouko in the anime, Sebastian does know about soul gems containing your actual soul.
“It’s okay, I’m just a little tired. I’ll be fine,” he said as he forced himself to stand up again pushing John away.
“Well he had the greatest potential of all Contractors so it only makes sense that he would turn into the wickedest witch of them all. I estimate that he’ll destroy the world in 10 days. Are you going to fight him?”
“Why… why are you always like this? Why do you always have to be so damn mysterious? There’s something you’re not telling me Sherlock and I think I deserve to know since it somehow involves me.”
“Then I’ll go and find her,” said John.
The heads whipped to the window when they heard storms sirens go off outside and the emergency broad cast system announcing a storm. Little did the masses know that it was really announcing Magnussen.
“What are you talking about? Are you threatening me?” John angrily questioned. He couldn’t understand what on earth Sherlock was getting at.
“It’s alright mate, it’s for the better right now,” said John placing a hand on Greg’s shoulder to stop him from going.
added John.
“John Watson will do just fine,” answered Sherlock who without looking at John, was already heading out of the classroom.
“You know is this world even really worth saving?” asked Greg in a hollow voice.
Maybe it would be better..
“Still so hostile? I came because I thought John was going to make a contract with me.”
Sherlock nodded his head as Greg and Molly watched with curious gazes giving John suggestive looks.
“I’m sorry if I wasted your time. Still take my words to heart.”
“John Watson, yes I know,” Sherlock said cutting off John.
“Really? I didn’t know that.”
John didn’t know why or when Sebastian and Sherlock had teamed up but everything was getting so much worse. He didn’t want Greg to fight, he didn’t want any of them to fight but there seemed to be nothing he could do to stop it.
John looked to the ground a little ashamed. Rolling his eyes Sebastian sat down taking out the food and motioned for John to join him. He brought fish and chips.
After all this was a dream.
“Moran are you…”
Sherlock’s heart fluttered at that smile but his composure didn’t betray him, he simply extended his hand and said, “I know.”
This is mostly about Sebastian and I do hope I was true to his character. Also slight mormor in this chapter too! Original title was "Everything is depressing and Sebasitan's (sad) BACKSTORY TIME"
“I’m not one to really judge another person who I’ve never spoken to but I think I have to agree with Greg,” added Molly.
John tried to rush forward but Mike grabbed him.
He could hear the destruction and the felt the wind blow wildly around them. Getting up slowly he began to walk away.
“What? Of course I wouldn’t harm them.”
Greg started to get up again, breathing heavily as he materialized another sword.
John was trying to stay calm. Becoming frantic like Greg wasn’t going to help the situation.
Please leave kudos or a comment!
“You’re just still upset about my cat scratching you up when we were five,” said Molly.
When John saw Greg’s face looking at Molly, everything made sense and he knew exactly what the wish was for.
While at the shop John was looking through some of the new vinyl when he heard a voice cry out,
John nodded fully comprehending finally everything that was going on.
“Well look who showed up. The witch escaped, you can follow and take care of it. I’ll let it go this time.”
Greg didn’t appreciate that with the last witch they had killed Sherlock almost got him too. Irene and John agreed that Sherlock needed to hone different skills to combat witches. So that’s what Sherlock did. Using his ability he stole weapons from criminals and raided some police armories. It didn’t matter though.
“It was your kill, so you can keep it.”
“Yes,” he replied unashamed.
John tilted his head in agitation of her remark.
“Who is with you?”
Does it really matter? If we’re together here and now it doesn’t matter if we’re not in any other possible future.”
Maybe this was all some sort of cruel ploy to a huge humiliation they were planning. Nobody has ever liked him. Nobody has ever called him ‘incredible’ and ‘amazing’. That’s right nobody has ever wanted him around.
“Are you guys going to keep talking or are we going to fight?” mocked Greg who was tired of waiting.
“Well fuck that. I’m not about to hand over prime territory to some newbie that you suckered into making a deal with.”
John was throwing pebbles at Greg’s window and wishing that he didn’t have to do something so childish but no one was answering the door and he knew for a fact that Greg was home. John was hoping that Greg would look outside before he had to throw a rock through his bedroom window but maybe the shock would do him some good.
“I know what I have to do now.”
“Hold on to me.”
“I told you the next time we would meet that we would really have it out,” Irene said glaring at Sherlock.
Truth be told Greg was a little concerned about John being able to protect himself. But if he really was going to think about it, keeping John by his side made him think more clearly and not do anything reckless because there was John to consider.
It was as they were leaving the hospital, John spotted it. It looked very similar to a grief seed but it was attached to a column of the building and pulsing with energy.
“If you’re talking about school don’t worry, I’ll definitely go tomorrow. I just needed to recuperate a little today. Everything will be okay John, you’ll see.”
Sebastian stopped talking again and John could hear him take shallow breaths.
“Well isn’t it obvious? I’m going to put his dumb rookie ass out of commission. Permenantly.”
“I see now, I know your technique,” said Kyubey who also appeared in front of the group of boys not at all bothered with how distressed John was or the fact they had Greg’s body. “You have the ability to stop time. I think I understand who you are now.”
It was with that action, did John realize Greg’s soul gem was no longer the clear blue it was before. Instead it was almost black with some small object glowing in the center.
"It’s only never happened before and that doesn’t make it impossible. Kyubey even said so.”
“What?”” “I’m going to try to save Greg and I need your help.”
John didn’t know what to say which seemed to be his default mode in these last couple weeks. He wished that he wasn’t so useless and that he could do more to comfort his fiend. All he could do was stand there and comfort Greg to the best of his abilities which honestly could never be enough.
“Mycroft, Sherlock,” Victoria summoned and her two boys looked to her. “Why don’t you play something for us?”
“I am going to kill our son,” John nodded in the cab home, remarkably calm. “This is your fault, you know. That kid has no filter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John paused to gape at him. “No,” he said incredulously.
“Pick your jaw up off the floor whenever you’re ready and let’s go drink,” Joan giggled in her ear and then dragged her, past the dancefloor and a pool table where a woman with heavy eye-makeup seemed to be raking in bets, to a bar on the other side.
Sherlock froze a moment, unsure of himself, before he reached back to touch his own long index to his son’s nose. “Boop,” he rumbled, in the most dignified of ways, and Hamish was still giggling as he watched his father run towards danger.
“Jesus, Sherlock, we’ve talked about topic transitions,” Joan swore. “Ease into new topics, make a bridge; it’s like writing an essay.”
“It’s cause I’m really smart,” Sherlock explained and that made sense. John didn’t know a lot of smart people. His mum always said his dad was an idiot and Harry did bad in school. Suddenly, he really, really wanted a smart friend.
“Erm, why?” John asked.
Sherlock glanced up, obviously puzzled. “Why? That limits us terribly.”
John took a moment to close his own eyes before answering. “He meant there’s no
“So you keep saying, but yet we-“
Inside the tent, John turned over and clutched at the sleeping bag. “Too early,” he muttered, covering his face.
“I’m going to sit on that bench over there,” he pointed. “If you need me, you’re wise enough to know what to do. Do we comprehend each other?”
“You bloody, insufferable, twisted-“ Sherlock rants, sliding out of John to chase after his brother, stark naked, and John sighs. He knows exactly what Mycroft is doing and he loves him for it. The man is rather good at providing something stable for his fragile brother.
“Sherlock-“
“Well then why are we still here?” she shouted, already halfway to the door. “The game, Watson, is on!”
“Are you aware that Sarah likes you?” Sherlock asked him as they drove up the bumpy road to camp.
“Are you analyzing the bear?” John whisper-yelled. “It didn’t commit a murder, Sherlock. Or did it? Please tell me it didn’t.”
“Yes, Yes, what a large step for mankind,” Sherlock drawled, packing up her backpack and leading them out of the building. Kelsie and some of the dyke squad were perched on the steps outside, smoking in the cool air and laughing about something. At the sight of the two of them, someone wolf-whistled and Kelsie let out a cry of “Sherly!”
Sherlock looked at John as though he’d much like to punch him, but the B221 boys were taking up the cheer.
“No one has ever said they loved me before,” Sherlock said softly and John couldn’t imagine it, a childhood where no parent ever stooped low over a cot and whispered
“Make me,” Sherlock challenged and because they were teens and they were wet and it was hot and loud, they kissed. It wasn’t a messy kiss, or even one of their too-hot-to-look-at kisses. It was just a kiss and both boys were still laughing into each other’s open mouths when someone snarled,
“No,” he said honestly, finally figuring out what felt wrong. He was acting like he was ashamed of his parents when really, nothing could be further from the truth. “They’re my Da’s. He’s a scientist; he does all kinds of amazing experiments,” he bragged and he felt rather than saw Sherlock puff up proudly behind him.
Sherlock bit back a laugh but Chloe seemed very convinced by this. “I could be corn too. Then we could be corn friends,” she suggested shyly.
“We stopped because, well,” John had never seen anyone look so uncomfortable and it twisted his stomach into knots. “Sherlock got involved in drugs. I mean, a lot of drugs. Cocaine mostly, but I think there might’ve been some heroin too.”
“No need to get so excited, Sherlock,” Cynthia smiled at him and he spared her a fond look. “I’ll tell it anyway.
“Motherfu-“ Bossman started to wheeze but Hamish held the gun straight and unshaking with the kind of accuracy he’d envied in his fathers. John had never agreed to teach him how to shoot but he knew how to wield a gun and boxing did a lot to build strong arms.
“Oh shut up,” John smiled widely, pushing him. “You’ll love it.”
“Go on, tell me how you figured it,” Joan said, even-toned and Sherlock did- the mail, the unwashed sheets on the living room bed, the bone-dry shoes by the door just for show and, of course, “-I’ve been coming here nearly every night for three weeks and I’ve yet to see her.”
He meets Brendan on the way out and the man studies him carefully before shaking his hand.
The girl, Chloe, was sitting at the metal table, dwarfed in her large chair. Her blonde locks were a ragged, muddy mess and purple bruises highlighted her cheeks. She looked up as they entered, her gaze immediately fixing to Sherlock.
Okay, maybe not
“Don’t tell Mummy anything,” Mycroft ordered, his eyes on the road.
“Daddy!” Hamish cried, rushing into the den, and Sherlock stood to lift the boy into his arms, submitting to a horrendously sticky kiss. “I got an A on my project and Mrs. Teacher said I showed expectional process!”
“That sounds utterly stimulating.”
“Hm, I rather hoped we’d wait a bit, but if you’d like to forge so far ahead,” Sherlock teased and
“Christ, Sherlock-“
“Hamish-“ John nearly exploded and then Sherlock slid neatly in.
“Soccer,” Joan correctly automatically but Sherlock interrupted before they could get sidetracked.
-call disconnected-
“And you want to kiss all of the girls?” Sherlock checked and Hamish looked appalled.
Sherlock did, their noses touching, and Sherlock bent the centimeter to rub them against each other and it was so intimate, John nearly cried.
“Yeah, about a half hour after our mums left,” Sherlock explained and then froze. The house was utterly empty. And if generally Victoria liked to stop for lunch and Harry was planning on introducing Mycroft to Clara, then it would be so for a good three hours.
My gratuitous use slang isn't exhausting- yours is!
Hamish listened carefully to his Papa. “He wants to talk to you,” he told Mycroft and the man took his mobile back.
Hamish took a deep breath. “I don’t feel unsafe,” he confessed. “Yeah, it’s a little unnerving, all these goons, but I’ve got a madman and an adrenaline junkie for fathers. I was raised to enjoy this bit.”
Oh god, I have been terrible. Expect more updates now that I'm on break again. I swear though, this story is getting finished. I have it all planned out in my head and everything!
“Chicken,” he accused and she leveled her eyes at him, blue and piercing.
“Or,” she offered, her voice giving her away with its lilt of excitement, “we figure out where the money actually went and then engage in some good, clean, blackmail.”
If his shower took an extra ten minutes that night as he slammed his head against the tile and shoved a fist in his mouth as he tried not to think about Sherlock and condoms…well no one said anything about it.
“Friend of mine, army buddy,” Lestrade says. “Talk to his wife.”
He knew immediately it was a stupid decision, the waves were freezing as they soaked him to the bone and near impossible to swim in; but luckily all he wanted was to swim with the current and in a moment he was clambering onto the back of Sherlock’s raft and Sherlock was helping him up, the unmistakable sign of laughter hiding in his eyes.

“We’re not friends!” Sherlock said quickly as Mycroft moved to leave.
Love, John
So it appears we've decided to screw the rules. Let's not panic people- we get one summer of utter fluff and abandon first. And let me tell you. There will be so much fluff and angst in that summer, y'all will start loving and hating me at the same time. And it will be glorious.
"I love you both, so much," he choked out and John had a brief second to whisper, "Oh love-" before Sherlock coughed.
“I’m moving back to Baker Street,” Sherlock said and the implications were obvious.
Sherlock took to a demonstration. “I love you like this,” he said, and leaned forward to kiss Hamish’s forehead, right against the soft, dark curls. “And I love Papa like this,” he contrasted, tugging John forward an inch to kiss him chastely on the lips, a smile curving at the end of it.
“You took an interest in Sherlock,” Sarah said casually. “And we all know you don’t just let your interests go.”
Cynthia leaned back in her chair and smiled. “You’re rather the star of the story, Harry,” she reminded her daughter and Harry suddenly backed down, looking the other way.
to me.”
“John I don’t think-“ Sherlock started and John laughed.
“Shit.”
"And still not bulletproof!" his son argued. "And Pa, with his hip now, it's a wonder he didn't break anything from that fall-"
“That’s the hard part,” Sherlock soothed. “You have to figure it out. Start with that white house.”
“Okay!” Hamish cheered. “I love you, Papa.”
Two chapters in four hours? Hells yeah!
As if to confirm John’s line of thought, Sherlock drew back with a shudder, his hands still dug deep into John’s hips, his mouth inches from John’s, their foreheads touching, keeping each other upright.
“Sherlock, I didn’t see you this morning, I thought we should-“ John stammered but Sherlock cut him off.
“Of course you are,” Joan chuckled, handing over a fork and the two ate in silence for a few beats before Joan set her bowl down on the floor and stood up to wander over to the record player in the corner. “I have been neglecting this for too long,” she said decisively, crouching down to rifle through the records underneath.
John threaded his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and pulled up so that the genius was forced to meet his eye. “First thing’s first,” John growled and then kissed Sherlock, hard, insistent and incredibly filthy.
“Burn in hell, Mycroft,” Sherlock hissed, hunching lower in his dressing gown.
“We are going into town right now,” John said, jumping down from the tree and glaring up at Sherlock. “And you will have some Peri-Peri.”
“Do you wanna talk it out?” Joan offered and with any other problem, Sherlock would’ve taken her up in a heartbeat. She found talking out her issues to Joan incredibly helpful. Joan very rarely managed to offer any intentionally helpful insights but she often accidentally stumbled onto the solutions. Even when she didn’t, Joan somehow served as a…conductor of light, helping her rearrange the puzzle till it fit.
“I think my mum had a few words with her,” John suggested to Sherlock’s comically shocked face. “Now come, before I collapse on the stairs.” And with that John dragged Sherlock to his room
“Welcome,” she said, smiling. “Sorry it’s a bit messy.”
“I wasn’t insulted.”
One kiss turned to two turned to several long moments that stretched out like pulling taffy before Joan was the one to lean back. “I really want to see you eat,” Joan whispered against her mouth and it was so utterly in-character that Sherlock had to laugh, hard enough to break the spell. Joan swatted at her and tried to look offended but couldn’t stop smiling and it was so endearing that Sherlock found herself agreeing to eat three entire pancakes.
and leaned in to kiss her back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You bastard,” Sherlock choked out and John only laughed again, diving down to tug at Sherlock’s feet before surfacing.
“It did,” Hamish gasped out. The rest of the park goers were fixed on the sky, watching the end-of-the-day fireworks show, but the two teenagers could only see each other.
“I just want to hold you,” Sherlock says softly, just a whisper in the London silence.
After dinner, John climbs the stairs to his bedroom. Sherlock waits a minute before following him upstairs, toeing into bed. John stirs in his arms, not yet asleep.
“Look, we’re kicking him out. Is there something-“ the officer tried but John just smiled.
“Three had scattered by the time someone came to break up the fight. By the time we got to the office, it was just me and Jack, that’s the boy-“ Hamish tripped over the words.
Perhaps Mycroft was as much a genius as everyone said.
“You’re alive,” John said quietly, not quite believing it.
The first patient John ever treated on his own grabbed at the thimble with spasming hands and John let him grasp it as he performed surgery. He spent the next night painstakingly cleaning the blood out of the small holes and grooves where it had accumulated. After that, he stopped cleaning it altogether and let the baby blue color fade to a dusty red.
“Look kid-“ Lestrade said but that’s the wrong thing to say and Sherlock isn’t mad anymore, he’s furious.
“Doctor,” John told him, squeezing his hand, “or soldier. Maybe both. What about you?”
Ignoring the statement, Sherlock trekked upstairs into the kitchen. “Let’s feed you supper,” he announced, opening the fridge to pull out a container of leftover lo-mien. He dumped it in a ceramic bowl and shoved it in the microwave before turning back to his son.
“This is Captain Sarah Sawyer, of The Lancashire Fusiliers. She’ll be assisting you after Captain Harrows reassignment,” he tells him and John puts down his sutures to shake her hand.
“Well,” Sherlock drawled, back suddenly feeling better. “Just because bathtub sex is out, does that mean sex is out in general?”
“Good morning,” he murmured, leaning up to kiss the genius. “How are you feeling?”
John wasn’t sure how one could get mushrooms from meters but he smiled back anyway. “That’s lovely, Hamish. Are parents invited to sports day?”
“I love this song!” she yelled, although she was already right next to Sherlock’s ear. “You have to dance with me Sherly, come on.”
Harry reaches up one hand to wipe her face as Sherlock glances quickly at Mycroft Holmes. The self-professed iceman has a napkin to his face and it takes the genius a minute to realize his older brother is actually
“Come off it,” John laughed, applauding with everyone else. “You’re just good at everything, you utter berk.”
“Inspector Lestrade,” the detective said, shaking the offered hand.
John was going out of his mind. After the first hour Sherlock was gone, he’d broken down and called Mycroft. He’d spent the next hour in a rest station with Mycroft, going over every bit of information he remembered from the fair. It wasn’t until the third hour after Sherlock had disappeared that Mycroft finally got a call.
“At the protest?” Sherlock asked and Joan only reached out to ruffle her hair. It was a demeaning gesture and Sherlock should have been annoyed but she only felt herself shiver a bit in the warmth of the touch. If Joan noticed, she didn’t say a word.
“Oh,” Hamish said. He’d quite possibly forgotten he’d even had a question. “Right. So, in the winter when the pond freezes, where do the fish go?”
“You can talk to me,” John said suddenly, getting up. “During the day. You can talk to me, I won’t mind.”
Has he noticed you’re happy to see him?
Cynthia’s eyes held tears and John’s heart stopped for a second until he realized she was smiling, crying softly that her son had found someone to love. But Victoria’s face was unreadable, and Sherlock stared at her, hands clutching nervously at John.
“If we do not choose to· perform these ego services,” Anne had kept going, some words getting lost in the middle, “but instead assert ourselves as primary to ourselves, we are denied the necessary access to alternatives wherein we can manifest our self- assertion. It is not only through denying women human alternatives that men are able to maintain their positions of power. It is politically necessary for any oppressive group to convince the oppressed that they are in fact inferior, and therefore deserve their situation. So, that’s where we all come from tonight.”
Sherlock takes him apart slowly. He kisses the fold of his elbow, runs his tongue up his forearm, bruised and marred even though it’s been four years. He kisses down his chest, licking at dusty nipples until their hard under his tongue, until John’s arching up into him, making soft begging noises.
Mycroft would have to collect his jaw from the floor at some point but for now all he could do was nod and switch on the telly, handing the remote back to the six-year-old who was now staring wide-eyed and relaxed as two cartoon animals chased each other around a kitchen.
“How was it?”
“I don’t wanna go in!” the toddler had screamed from the side of the pool just that afternoon.
“Squeeze my hand,” John ordered and Sherlock did as John reached his other hand down to maneuver himself into Sherlock. He pushed in and Sherlock let out a sudden scream, squeezing John’s hand white and dragging scratches down John’s back and John kissed him firmly, warmly, to hold back the sobs.
“Fucking hell,” John cursed, pushing into Sherlock’s tongue, as the younger boy did his best to slick the area, tongue sliding in and out to taste John, a strange combination of sweat and honey.
“It would certainly make for a more interesting weekend,” Sherlock grumbled and Joan only slurped her soup in reply.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock cut him off, inspecting John carefully.
“ I tried to warn you,” Sherlock pointed out dryly, swimming to the edge and climbing out.
“Sherlock?”
“John, I am currently on top of you,” he noted and John laughed, the vibrations rumbling against Sherlock’s back.
This chapter is based off of a Junie B. Jones book I was once forced to read aloud six times. In a row. May my suffering have been good for something
Sherlock's hands were on his hips drawing the same patterns John could draw in his sleep, could see in his dreams. Sherlock's teeth were grazing the skin on his neck, and he couldn't help but let out a small moan.
John uncrumpled the ball to realize it was swimming trunks. “We’re going night swimming?” he near squeaked out.
Banquet always ended with a great deal of singing and dancing, the boys jumping up on the tables and benches to sing the camp song and dance the ridiculous dances they’d made up to go along with it. John and Mike were the first one’s up, cheering their’ kids off the benches, and making elaborate movements. John caught Sherlock out of the corner of his eye watching him, covering his mouth to keep from laughing, and John winked back, grinning as saucily as he could manage. The boy even blushed.
And there it was, on the TV, a man lost in the folds of a white marshmallow of a suit but still very much a man, stepping foot on the surface of the moon. She remembered the first moon landing, now three years ago and oh god was it possible to have such different nights.
“Oh god yes,” John promised and Mary spared him a smile. And then he rushed out of the bedroom and downstairs with Mike.
“I still need to finish this,” Sherlock said once they’d found themselves on the already-dark street outside, gesturing with the half-finished letter. “And then run it down to the station. Or maybe it’s better to mail it- don’t really foresee going to the Bushwhick police holding a knife, even if it is in a bag-“
“Sir,” Anthea was suddenly next to him and he brushed her off.
“Fair point,” Sherlock conceded and he followed John down the street, careful to stay a fair distance from the young couple.
“…and so the Queen awarded Oliver a medal of distinction for his valor and Oliver retired to marry Ingrid and have four children in Bath. The end,” John finished and the boys burst into applause, hooting and hollering as they did. John blushed adorably and then glanced at his watch.
“Well there’s no point in faking inadequacy, is there?” she huffed but Joan only gave her a knowing look.
Sherlock said nothing, only moved to make a space for the boy, and Hamish scrambled up onto the bed to fit himself between them in a makeshift cuddlepile. He buried his face in Sherlock’s chest and John wrapped his arm gently around Hamish’s waist as Sherlock did the same to John’s, the three of them falling into an overwarm, protected sleep.
They come downstairs shagged out and dewy, dressed in comfortable and tight clothes respectively. John settles on the couch, holding a box in his hands.
“Don’t see why not,” Sherlock agreed against her better judgement as Joan took the loudest sip of coffee she’d ever heard. She had no desire to go; the night would be spent mostly in planning for the march on Washington the following month and she couldn’t afford to have another public panic attack but there didn’t seem to be a way out of it that wouldn’t come off as suspicious.
I touch you,” John lavished and Sherlock felt something utterly hot and scalding pool at the bottom of his stomach-
“That’s quite enough,” Mycroft hushed him and Sherlock could remember a time when he thought the sun rose and set on Mycroft. That had been years ago, years before Father had-
“There’s a thunderstorm,” the boy explained and Mycroft sat in silence, waiting for the normally chatty boy to go on. “When there’s a thunderstorm, Daddy and Papa let me sleep in their bed. Papa says cuddle-piles protect people from thunder and lightning.”
Mycroft laughed. It wasn’t a good look on him, one of utter merriment, and John hoped he’d go back to his impassive face soon. “I’m actually trying to be nice, John.”
“So, what did happen to your face?” she asked, moving to start putting away the first aid kit, and the tension broke.
“I kissed you first,” Chloe assured him, their hands swinging between them as the last of the fireworks died out and they followed the crowd out of the park. “Still corn-friends?”
“In a minute,” John promised, kissing the inside of his thigh. “I’m going to add another finger. If it feels like too much, we stop this, right here, right now. Okay?”
“So you’ll always have someone to keep you safe,” he explained and Chloe hugged it tightly to her chest, eyes shining,
“I’m going to speed up, okay?” John asked,
“Why did your father kill himself?”
Hamish paused before speaking. “It’s just so lonely in my room, without her,” he confessed, voice faint. “You both have each other but I’m all by myself-“
“What?” Sherlock asked, innocently, his hand traveling higher, stopping to stroke the inside of John’s thigh, and the older boy shuddered.
“I won’t help you,” Sherlock hissed, backing up.
“A kiss,” Sherlock explained, as if they didn’t both understand, and John held it tight, letting it make marks into the inside of his palm.
John’s flooded with shame. “No, god no! Love no, I would never- I know you wouldn’t,” he explains frantically, kissing Sherlock’s temple in apology. “I just- I wouldn’t blame you if you did.”
“It got a manicure,” John suggested angrily. “I have no idea, Sherlock, but we’re about to be eaten-“
“Not your fault I drank too much,” Sherlock muttered, falling asleep.
“No clarinet, no piano and no violin!” he resisted. “I want something different.”
“He turned Jamie Kurith down?” John repeated, shocked. There were guys at camp who would have easily given their left arms to hook up with Jamie Kurith.
They sat down in the dining hall, pulling out benches and pouring cereal. John took a schedule from a passing counselor and scanned it quickly. He couldn’t pretend his heart didn’t lodge itself in his throat when he saw the word
John gave up and left, shuddering as another explosion rocked the house behind him.
Was John asking if, after years of people telling him he would die alone and hated, he would
Hamish was uncomforted. “Yeah but Sammy Pete Spencer’s older brother said that there are too monsters and he’s in fourth year plus he’s super smart. He even knows how to spell incorrigible so I would think he knowses a lot about monsters.”
“Okay, we talked a little bit about this at the last meeting but we’re planning for the march on Washington in January, that’s two months from now so not that much time to decide.”
“Why don’t you hate me?” Sherlock murmured and John hugged him with a tenderness that made Sherlock want to bury his face in John’s shoulder and sob. He didn’t, of course. Holmeses did not cry in public. Or anywhere for that matter but this-
“It’s 102 days.”
John turned back to Sarah, noting the smirk on her face. “Did he say why?” John pressed, unsure of why he cared so much.
“Hello?” he snapped and the voice at the other end froze.
“Make it fifteen,” he cautioned and Sherlock nodded as he closed the bunk door. “Alright boys, it is time for bed!” he yelled, walking back into the bunk and he could’ve sworn he heard a snicker from the other side of the wooden door.
The hug lasted maybe four seconds before all three parties cleared their throats and went their separate ways. Mycroft went back to Harry, who hugged him tightly and murmured soft words of praise, and Sherlock had just rejoined John when Victoria snapped her fingers and two waiters walked out, picked up the instruments, and began playing.
He pulled Sherlock down into him, fingers digging into sharp hipbones. “Move,” he ordered and Sherlock kissed his knee before slowly rocking in, drawing out and easing back in in slow, lazy motions.
“Don’t open it at the dining hall table.”
“Which shoulder?” Sherlock asks.
“That’s incredibly romantic.”
“No?” Sherlock repeated,
“Get out,” she giggled and, both laughing, they made their way up to the Chemistry labs.
I’m hugging you.
“Hello?” he said groggily, answering his phone at three a.m. in the middle of Upper Sixth.
As Sherlock clenched and vibrated beneath John, the older boy fell apart, coming with a harsh groan, the headboard leaving imprints in the wall, as he filled the condom. He saw white, he saw stars, he saw wastelands of grey with specks of green and when John could finally open his eyes, he collapsed onto Sherlock’s chest, breathing in tandem.
Yes. The man was a manipulative bastard.
Mycroft.”
“Watson?” he calls out and John turns, covered in blood from the leg wound he’s stitching.
“You don’t have enough data.”
“Sherlock?” John called and the genius put his son down and they retreated into the cab, waving madly out the window as they pulled away.
“Not so high, Hamish,” he called out and Hamish looked at him, surprised. Chloe was soaring through the air like some sort of bird and Sherlock looked up to see her holding on to the chains  with her eyes closed, the first true blissful expression on her face he’d seen since she’d come to them.
Sherlock gets up to go to the bathroom. John has to take a call outside. They meet in the alley behind the restaurant and Sherlock’s back is up against a brick wall, John’s hands insistent and firm on his hips. Their foreheads touch and their breath intermingles, a simple exchange of out in.
And then Seb’s voice came back, tauntingly honest.
“Where should I touch you?” Sherlock asked, already reaching and Joan let her head fall back as she did something with her own fingers.
Sherlock. That meant something. “It wasn’t bad or anything. But the next morning we found him. He said in his note he didn’t trust himself not to hurt us anymore, no matter where he went.”
“Oh John,” he smiled, a mouse in each hand. “Perfect. I was just about to put my experiment away.”
“Why not? She only wastes your time and energy this way,” Sherlock says and it’s because he doesn’t
“That’s rather undisputed.”
He took a necessary breath. “Are you…seeing someone?” he asked finally and he could have sworn he saw Sherlock’s face fall. “Not that you have to tell me if you are, or that I care, or that it’s my business…” he stammered, unsure of himself suddenly. “I mean, you’re perfectly welcome to see people and not tell me, I only wondered, since we’re flatmates and all-“
John looks at him warningly. “Sherlock-“
Probably wondering how you get your abs considering you don’t work out
“I get it,” she agreed. “It’s tough. But we can change things. That march, this past June, you should’ve seen how many people were there. Women- and men- all just there to fight for basic equality. It takes a long time but things can get better if we keep trying. I believe that with my whole heart.”
came out from the other room and clapped John on the back in a hug.
thought he might be more comfortable with a relative. We told him you both were very busy with a case rather than worry him.”
Sherlock considered it a minute. “I mean, technically the skull is a -“ he tried and John looked ready to punch him. “Nope,” he quickly said, backpedalling furiously. “John is correct; there are no severed heads in our home.”
“Which means I’m good for the next three days. Now let me sit with him,” he demanded and John stood silently, yielding the chair. Sherlock sat and immediately took up Hamish’s relinquished hand, rubbing tiny circles into it with his thumb.
Awards were given: best at sports, most camp spirit, best bunk, and John’s boys cheered like lunatics when the best bunk of the fourth grade division went to B221. John ran up to accept their prize, fifteen key chains with the award inscribed, and set to handing them out. And then the camp song was sung one more time, followed by two line dances and Gangnam Style, and then it was off to bed.
“Well you can’t bloody eat with Papa!” Sherlock shouted, sinking to the kitchen floor as the whole day just caught up with him. He fisted his hands in his hair, pulling it painfully to ward off tears of his own. “Papa’s not here, Papa’s not coming home today.”
As Chloe and her aunt were leaving, Chloe hugging her foster uncles tighter than she’d ever hugged them before, Hamish shouted “Wait!” before bolting upstairs.
“They were kissing,” Angie whispered to her mother, breaking Sherlock’s train of thought and leaving John flustered.
Mycroft let his gaze rest on his younger brother for a long time before answering. “Broken things attract each other Sherlock. Always looking for their missing pieces.”
Hamish tried to recall. “There was a car in the parkway. Which means someone is home!”
“Pressure, tongue, no teeth. Anything else?” Sherlock asked, looking up and John nearly lost it.
“She invited us back, I guess she can’t disapprove of me that much,” John offered and Sherlock shook his head lightly.
to delete things Sherlock,” Mycroft reminded him. “What’s going on?”
“Sherlock," the voice whispered and Sherlock blinked his eyes open to find John standing there in the early morning dawn, fully dressed. “Wake up.”
The garden was draped in lanterns and flower leis and a table was set up just big enough for the six of them. A piano and violin stand were set in the corner with obvious intentions and the whole place seemed to glow in the twilight with an almost fairy light.
“Where?” John cried, as they ran out to the car.
Joan smirked right back at her. “I never told you I got an aunt down in Kentucky?” she drawled and Sherlock felt that curl again in the pit of her, as she jumped off the wooden benches and snatched up both their bags.
“Hey, so, I was thinking,” Joan started, fixing her hair behind her ear- a nervous habit Sherlock only ever saw her do in bars, “do you want to maybe come over tonight and watch the moon landing?”
“Oh John,” Sherlock laughed softly, “you don’t get a
“We’ve only known each other a month, bit premature, don’t you think?” Sherlock slid off as he nestled into their tighter position. “You don’t even know my favorite colour.”
Hamish spun around to face him. “Wait. So, I’m not in trouble?” he asked, bewildered and Sherlock let out a soft laugh.
“Hamish-” Sherlock tried but the boy was standing up and nearly running to the open door of their bedroom. Weak, Sherlock followed him to find him standing by their bed, too short to climb on, clutching desperately to the crumpled duvet they’d left in their rush to get to the crime scene this morning.
Establish facts. This meeting was about the experience of rape. Joan had brought them here, which meant that Joan-
The food was dumped in the center of the bunk and the boys sat in a crocked circle around it, laughing as they stuffed their faces. John and Mike shot each other equally resigned faces. They knew this much sugar was ensuring their kids would never go to sleep, but it
“You’re terrible at dirty talk.”
“And your father?” Lestrade asked.
“And is no one going to congratulate me on disarming and holding up two paid assailants?” Hamish finally caved and it was Sherlock who answered that.
. This wasn’t something he was used to. Empathy. He was empathizing, sympathizing, and he suddenly wanted to see the scar again, see the way the knife must have dug in deep and pulled at the flesh, tugging it into its own scar. He wanted a piece of it for his microscope and maybe just a piece for himself. It was getting harder, these days, to tell the two sides of his brain apart.
“Not yet, but there’s no doubt my Mycroft will marry a lovely woman and continue the Holmes family, isn’t that so?” Victoria smiled and Mycroft smiled back, the picture of the perfect son.
John didn’t even question it. “Come here,” he ordered, sitting up, and Sherlock leaned forward obligingly, letting John kiss him open. It was ridiculous how fast their kisses had become familiar, they’d only been doing this for a month for Christ’s sake, and yet John already felt like he knew Sherlock’s mouth by heart, like a map laid open and clean before his eyes. It didn’t make the whole situation any less arousing though.
Hamish nodded. “Yep. He wasn’t upset about the chemistry,” he clarified, anticipating his father’s next question. He walked a little father before turning back, unable to resist. “He was more upset that I was keeping Drama.”
John nodded. “Bit personal,” he said and Sherlock noted it. So John wouldn’t talk about his father with him. He filled that in on the chart he was constructing on John Watson deep in the West Wing.
“I know,” Sherlock smiled and John wanted nothing more than to jump back into that sleeping bag and kiss that smug face. “Isn’t it glorious?”
“La Bohème,” Mycroft said, proud of himself for deducing.
Sherlock glared at him a long minute before finally nodding.
“Not soon enough,” Sherlock cried quietly, his teeth reaching for John’s lip and John let him suck at it for a minute before detaching and holding Sherlock against his chest.
Greg took a serious pause before answering.
“Was?”
Sherlock could feel the blood rush through his veins and like the devil seducing an unwitting mortal, Sherlock sold his soul.
Hearing footsteps coming, Greg stood waiting to see Molly with a smile on her face and good news but instead he saw her in tears. Rushing forward he caught her as she collapsed to the ground.
She began sobbing again, her whole body trembling with anger and sadness.
He thought he should take his new duties seriously and was going to be patrolling the hotspots that Irene had talked about and shown them before. It wasn’t that long until he ran into John who had been looking for him.
“I came to talk to you, let’s walk.”
“John, please we can run away from all this. I don’t want you to…”
“Your friend dropped you off saying to take care of you. I tried to offer him shelter but he refused. He told me not to let you do anything stupid and I promised I would try.”
“Well it was after I went to the hospital with Molly. She was just really torn up about her dad. Mr. Hooper doesn’t deserve that, none of the Hoopers deserve what they were going through."
His heart had stopped all together. This couldn’t be happening first Irene then Sherlock! His attention was diverted though by the fact that Sherlock was actually still alive and standing on one of the swinging trapezes that were moving on their own.
“Those characteristics in a contractor have no real purpose. A person who is too brace will be careless, and when you are kind you end up becoming naïve. Also there is never any gratitude no matter how much you sacrifice to save others. Irene died because she became careless.”
,” he thought happily to himself as he settled down in his bed again.
“I guess you’re doing better since you came to school today,” said Greg.
Greg’s fists tightened and his face contorted to one of pure hatred, shoving John off his arm.
“Please help me.”
Harry gave a small frown but didn’t comment. As she began leaving his room she called back saying, “If you want to make it to school on time I suggest you hurry the hell up or else you’re going to be late.”
Finally after throwing countless blades and spilling enough blood that his clothes began to look a little more red than blue, Greg had finally gotten Sebastian in the right position to strike at him. But Greg didn’t know that he was being fooled by Sebastian until it was too late. At such close proximity Greg swung his blade, striking the bayonet clean off the musket and when he saw Sebastian smile he knew he had fucked up. Sebastian swiftly moved the gun to the hand holding the sword and at point blank range fired. Then without any hesitation he moved the gun over each of his knee caps and shot right through them. Greg collapsed and screamed in agony. He felt bone of his knee caps shatter and the blood staining his clothes as he crumpled to the ground.
“I’m sorry but this territory has been claimed by another Magical Boy. I just made a contract with Him not too long ago,” said Kyubey.
“I just thought maybe after all this time you liked her too. Thanks a lot for clearing things up. I didn’t want to look like a complete idiot asking out a girl who is already dating. She can still turn me down but at least I know she’s available and can try. I’ll talk to you later.”
John finally understood the last mystery.
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg slowly released Kyubey. He wanted to rant and rave at it but there was just no arguing those facts. Still there was just no way he could go to school. Go see Molly while he was this non-human thing. There was no future for them. He pulled his cover close to him, wishing all of this was a bad dream.
I am so sorry, this isn't even that great of an update I should have posted this months ago. But I am posting both final chapters tonight.
He was fighting the inevitable.
John was supposed to be hanging out with Greg but their outing turned into them coming along with Molly to the hospital. John didn’t mind coming to visit Molly’s father or lend any support he could. He did mind however being tricked into thinking that he was going to some shops with Greg and not dwell on the whole wish business and instead they picked up some flowers and magazines to give to Molly for her father and subsequently having to wait over an hour for her. He would have eaten breakfast if he knew they were going to wait so long but instead he was waiting outside for Greg to come out after saying goodbye to the Hoopers. They weren’t even going out with Molly, as she was going to spend the day with her family but apparently Greg had made a promise to Mr. Hooper about some magazine and neglected to tell John about it. John would’ve just liked to be prepared is all. Also it didn’t help that Kyubey was attached to him, following them around. It didn’t help with trying to forget about the craziness that was actually going on.
“Don’t interrupt. His name was James Moriarty but to me he was just Jim.”
“Why do you come?” she asked.
“We’ll see about that,” Greg said as he spat out some blood.
“Sherlock isn’t like that. What happened with Irene wasn’t his fault. If they were working together from the start, maybe she would have lived. Please, Sherlock, Sebastian, and you are all after the same thing right? You want to kill witches. Why can’t you all work together?”
Sherlock’s face a myriad of emotions before his face once again settled into the usual somber expression.
“Who are you and what do you want?!”
“What are you guys whispering about?” Molly mockingly whispered as she stood next to them.
Sherlock learned to make bombs and different chemical reactions that could give them an upper hand in fighting the witches. He was grateful that he had the flat to himself in this time.
Sherlock wondered why he did bring the empty vessel with him. It could cause serious problems it wasn’t deal with correctly. But looking at John who had his head between his knees while hyperventilating, he knew why he had done such an irrational act.
“Well it’s better than the selfish greedy view you have.”
The witch had gotten over its initial shock and went straight at him. Greg materialized a sword in his hand and lunged forward. John could only sit on the ground in awe of his friend. He was now impossibly fast.
“You idiot!” yelled Sebastian as he pushed John out of the way to see where the gem had gone.
“I don’t think you understand. I said I’m willing to overlook what happened earlier.”
Irene gave a short laugh.
“Yes?” he replied removing his wet jacket.
John was surprised by Irene. She had been trying to make it clear to them that she was only doing this for Kyubey. But he thought that deep inside Irene might actually care a little.
“Hear what?”
“Well you’re were sweating so it must’ve been some dream.”
“Wait no Molly, it’s not like that!” Greg tried calling after her as she walked away from them.
John then went forward to meet his fate as Sherlock lunged forward trying to keep him from going. His hand barely missed John’s as he cried out.
“I wouldn’t do anything that would cause trouble.”
“I don’t know but there is something definitely up with him. He’s pretty intense but I think and just hear me out, I think he was actually concerned for me,” John said before taking a bite out of his sandwich.
“I’m only saying what your fucking wish implies. You won’t ever get what you actually want by pussyfooting it. A girl can be given everything in this shitty world but it won’t change how she how she feels about you.”
“I came to enlighten you about what it means to be a contractor but if that’s what you want to fucking do then fine. Let’s go somewhere more private.”
Sebastian was confused but didn’t hesitate. The rest of the world came to a stop and only the three of them were still moving.
“Him?”
“John! Greg! Oh hi Mike I heard what happened I hope you’re okay. GUESS what happened!” she exclaimed to them only taking a second to quickly acknowledge Mike and his grievances. Before any of them could try to hazard a guess she continued in another burst of joy. “It’s my dad! You won’t believe it, I can hardly believe it myself but my dad he’s going to be okay! Oh Greg, I’m so sorry for the things I said yesterday I was in such a mood and I shouldn’t have taken it out on you. But you were right! Miracles do exist!”
Irene as Mami
Bringing out a grief seed he brought it to his soul gem and with a surge of new magic he healed himself. Then he went to save John since he was also falling after the collapse of the floor. It turned out that it was needless because when a damsel is in distress, her knight comes and true to fashion Sherlock came and caught John.
“Because he’s alone right now and he’s my… I have to go.”
Taking out his own soul gem, Greg was about to change when he heard John.
“Greg!” yelled John who was about to chase after him.
“Kyubey is the name of the cat?” asked John.
“Definitely.”
Greg as Sayaka
“Greg! Maybe we should leave!” John yelled out.
“Um, where are you going?”
The body crumpled to the ground and Irene smiled victoriously.
“Don’t tell me you actually believe that crap. You really aren’t going to last long if you have that attitude.”
"All this time… and you knew. All of you knew.”
“No! Not until Sebastian leaves too.”
I hope you have enjoyed the story, thank you for reading.
“Where have you been?” asked Sherlock.
“Okay then,” he replied awkwardly.
“Holmes get Watson out of here I’ll take care of this,” said Sebastian.
“Then don’t think about a wish at all, just ask for something. It can be a fancy cake or perhaps you want to help out a friend too.”
“What? No I’m here for Greg. Greg!” called out John.
“How can you say that?!”
“Did you know?” asked Sherlock.
He was-
“You could wish for anything?” Greg repeated.
“The name is Sebastian Moran and I’ve come to take this territory over.”
After hailing a cab they left the city until they were on a dirt road. They got out of the cab after awhile when they reached an open field. The strange thing about the field was that there was a giant circular area where grass refused to grow. John left the cab first so that Sebastian
“It’s a witch’s seed and it looks like it’s going to hatch soon,” said Kyubey.
“Yeah I know I said I wasn’t going to make a contract but in the end I couldn’t help it.”
“But you must’ve known that if you would have told us up front-”
“You can’t, it’s impossible.”
A labyrinth was still opening up, this time it had the appearance similar to a jungle. The trees were distorted and the reality was taking the typical warped look it got. There was something hiding amongst the trees and it was trying to escape once it realized that Greg was in labyrinth. Finally getting a good glimpse of it, the best way John could put it was it being a plush monkey, if a toy monkey was overly robust with sharp fangs.
Later that night Sebastian found Sherlock watching Greg fight a witch down below from the building he was standing.
“You don’t know anything about Greg’s death, right? You didn’t know he was going to commit suicide?”
Quickly shutting the door and hoping that the lock wasn’t so old that it would break at the slightest pressure he sat back against door. Something was off though, even inside the small dark room John could feel the strange yet familiar sensation that was beginning to run through him. This was the worst moment to be trapped in a labyrinth without Irene or even Sherlock. The edges of reality were being consumed by a blue haze that slowly started to swirl and consume his surroundings. It felt like fog started to fill the air making it hard to breathe and John felt like he was disintegrating into the mist.
The game screen lighted up with the words “Perfect Score” illuminated across it. Turning to face Sherlock, Sebastian’s face took a serious expression.
Molly as Hitomi/Kyosuke
“Most definitely. You have the strongest potential so no matter what, you wish should be able to overcome entropy.”
“So what are you going to do, Sebastian?”
“So only we can see it?” asked Greg.
While John was trying to berate Sherlock, the dark haired boy kept his icey demeanor never betraying his true feelings.
Tossing the seed to Kyubey, the creature swallowed it whole.
Sherlock failed to get out of Magnussen’s immediate range and was slammed into the ground, a familiar position. He could only watch as the witch continued his destruction as his vision settled. He could feel blood trickle down his face, he needed to heal himself. Probably a cracked skull, but he couldn’t focus on the pain. This body was just an empty vessel, it could take more. But still he didn’t get up.
“I had a weird dream.”
“That’s it? You’re going to talk to him?” he asked incredulously.
Perhaps Mike was on something but that was so completely out of character for him. He was acting very strange though and as they continued to walk John noticed a peculiar mark on his neck. Recognizing it as a witch’s kiss just like the one they saw on the woman from the abandoned hospital, John began to panic.
“If you make a contract with me you could destroy it before it even hatches,” said Kyubey.
“Come on John, how long are you going to stay in bed? It’s not like you to miss school,” nagged Harry as she stood at the side of his bed.
“Yes, you see now that Greg has made a contract I was hoping you could do something.”
“Better than taking on Magnussen?” John said with a sad smile.
“What’s happening?” asked Greg who finally stopped and noticed that they were no longer running in the streets of London.
“If you continue to refuse to listen to reason then I’m going to take more drastic measures.”
“Kyubey isn’t a cat, to tell you the truth I don’t really know what Kyubey is but I guess if I have to call myself a Magical girl then that makes Kyubey the Magical animal companion. Kyubey can grant any wish and after you make one, it seals a contract between you two and you gain magical powers. In exchange for your wish though, you have to fight witches. Some would say it’s a small price to pay for having anything you wanted being given to you. Fighting witches is very dangerous and life threatening and before you decide about making a wish, you should decide what you want.”
“John? What’s wrong?”
John felt a chill run down his spine with the way Greg was talking. This could only spell disaster if Greg was going to have no sense of self care.
“I’m sorry Holmes. I can’t help you out but I’m not going to cause you more trouble either. You’re going to have to save your strength. I was hoping though that there was one thing you could do for me?”
The next day at school, Sherlock was underwhelmed to say the least. The teacher was an older woman who was clearly widowed but continued to wear her wedding ring. Introducing himself he could also see the many curious stares he was receiving for transferring in the middle of the semester. He had to devise a strategy to avoid any of their tedious questions. Still the truth of the matter was that he was incredibly nervous about what these classmates were going to eventually start calling him or worse try to do to him. He wanted to be alone but really he just didn’t want to be lonely.
“Left,” Mycroft says and he charts the space between the left shoulder and the heart. Too little
Alex’s face seemed to screw up as he attempted to connect puzzle pieces. “Is he the Hamish-“

The second John was sure Cesare was gone, he ran to Sherlock grabbing him in a crushing hug.

“Bloody hell Sherlock,” John cried, landing against the younger boy. “We can kiss in the car if you-“
Sherlock had some idea where that tip might have come from. “With all due respect Agent,” he began but she cut him off.
Sherlock leaves him at a crime scene two weeks later. This time, John doesn’t bother complaining.
John dug the balls of his feet into the floor to keep from thrusting into Sherlock’s mouth and then Sherlock went deeper and John
Go with purple. Makes you look edible.
“Sherl-“
Sherlock awoke to the sound of shuffling outside the tent. He rolled back over into John’s arms, snuggling away from the cold morning air, but the noise continued. Annoyed, Sherlock carefully detangled himself from the bag and crept out of the tent before stopping dead.
“It’s a dual program,” John tried to explain, as Sherlock laced his fingers through John’s under the table. The older boy squeezed back with a smile and went on. “It’s like my residency, only for much longer.”
“Ibuprofen,” John explained to Sherlock’s wide eyes. “You’ll thank me tomorrow. One more,” he said and Sherlock caught John’s finger in his lips this time, holding it a minute as John stared at him. Sherlock didn’t mean to, he
Sherlock kissed him nice and clean for a total of five seconds before he nipped at John’s bottom lip, demanding entrance, and John opened for him, moaning slightly as Sherlock’s tongue slipped inside, rubbing against his own and sending chills down his spine.
Hamish pulled a face. “Is Papa gonna be your Valentine this year, Daddy?” he checked.
“Alright, let’s go,” they sighed and dragged the boy out, kicking and screaming.
“You were just violently sick,” she insisted as they stood at a stalemate on the front steps of Sherlock’s building. “What if you’re sick again, or pass out, and there’s no one home? I’m coming in with you.”
, before John is everywhere. Legs on either side of his thin frame, pulling off clothing fast enough to leave burns along their arms and legs, slotting their cocks in line so as John rocks against him in an endless source of friction Sherlock is moaning, luscious and rich and so loud they can probably hear them in Notting Hill.
“You are such a wonderful father,” he praised and was rewarded with a slight flush on those sharp cheekbones. “You want to come with us?”
“Fuck you,” John forced out as Sherlock’s ridiculously skilled fingers skimmed over the tip of his cock and he jolted, back pressed painfully into the handle.
“I do try,” Mycroft said modestly, accepting their food as it was set down.
“It’s a beautiful drawing, baby,” he encouraged and Hamish glowed. “You too, Casey,” he told the other boy and Casey grinned up at him.
“Death cannot stop true love,” he quoted, holding Sherlock close. “All ir can do is delay it for a while.”
The sun had nearly set as John helped his kids assemble their tents and start pathetically adorable fires on which they were supposed to cook something mostly edible. He was still dripping, both figuratively and literally, from his little stint in the river and the looks the other counselors were giving him were nothing short of leering.
“What?” John asked, his hand rubbing Sherlock’s back.
, a world Sherlock had spent his whole life preparing for but which John had no experience dealing with.
“Joan started ours,” Sherlock spoke up and Joan blushed.
“Sherlock?” John asked, noticing his stillness. “Is everything alright?”
John doesn’t have even a moment to stutter before Harry is standing up and tapping at her glass.
“Don’t be embarrassed. You are a rather good writer,” he said and then brushed past John, walking down the gravel road. “Now keep up and follow me.”
“Sherlock, I see the way you look at him,” Mycroft said and Sherlock felt himself turn red.
It was hardly a game when they stood by the side of a pool, semtex anchoring John to the ground, a gun pointed at Jim Moriarty.
John groaned. “We’re not seriously having sex in a tent,” he protested, meekly mind you, because the thought of Sherlock sucking him off in the small structure was frighteningly appealing.
And then Sherlock ran down to the lake, rescue tube under his arms, and John settled on the counselor benches with Mike to watch their kids laugh and push each other off lake toys and John promptly forgot about the electrical current that had run through him at the mere touch of Sherlock. Well, he tried to.
“Yeah,” John smiled, bending down to kiss him again and again and again until Sherlock couldn’t see and all the pain was so worth it for
“Good,” John finished, dropping the boy and turning back to Sherlock. They started to walk away when the boy caught up to them from behind and tackled John to the ground.
“Is there somewhere we could talk?” he asked and Sherlock eyed him carefully.
“Self-medicating,” John filled in the blanks and Sherlock blinked at him, surprised.
He had to stand on tiptoe to twist open the door handle but he smiled to himself as he got the glass door open. The hallways were chaotic, with police men and women running around holding files. Hamish felt himself growing more and more anxious and he bit his lip.
Hamish sauntered in, still in his school uniform, and dropped his rucksack on the wood floor. “Well hello there my darling, most favoritist uncle,” he grinned cheekily, reaching across the papers to snag an apple from the fruit bowl.
Sherlock came bounding up the stairs of 221B to the sight of John and Hamish huddled around an explosion of colored paper.
All the adults on the scene stood frozen until Harry unfroze enough to reach for his belt where presumably a gun sat holstered.
and this was important here. “Never met anybody who just couldn’t figure out when to shut up.”
“I thought- I knew it
“I’m not upset,” Sherlock said shortly before slipping his glove back on and turning back to his bag. Hamish sighed.
“We’re gonna be here awhile,” John speculated and Sherlock took a pillow from the bed and set it down in front of John’s feet.
“Weird,” she tutted and Hamish turned on her.
“We’re going on an overnight Friday,” Mike told him, leaning against a clothes’ cubby. “Rafting Friday, camp out that night and come back Saturday. Then a whole bunch of packing Sunday and the boys leave Monday morning.”
“We could eat something,” John suggested and Sherlock swung up, a wicked grin spreading across his face and John flushed.
“You posh motherfucker,” John said incredulously. “Who doesn’t know what Nando’s is?”
“John,” he tried to get out calmly but it came out as a moan, luscious and wet and John grinned at him.
Hamish shook his head dutifully. “No but I thoughted it’d be okay cause it was for artistic persession. Mrs. Hudson said that was very ‘portant and are you saying Mrs. Hudson is a stinky liar like Beth?”
“She just got a bit turned around was all,” John brushed off, sticking out his hand. “John.”
“It is, actually,” she smiled softly, touching her hair. “Nice of you to notice, Hamish.”
“I know. She wrote to tell me and ask when my next leave was so they can schedule the wedding.”
“You’re not going to win this,” Sherlock informed his husband gently. “And you don’t want to.”
“I came with my school’s feminist group,” Joan said simply and Shulamith nodded. “We were trying to join up with NYRF-“
“Who told you?” he asked sharply, like a knife cutting glass. “You wouldn’t have figured it out on your own. Someone told you.”
“Hey,” she whispered and Hamish leaned in to kiss her quickly.
Joan was already leaning forward with ideas but Sherlock squeezed her hand to call her back. “Roe v Wade?” she whispered, unsure, but Ruth heard her and reached out to pat her hand.
“No Harry, everything’s shit and I’ve made a mess of everything.”
“Quite right. Where was I?” he checked.
“Sweet girl, Jeanette. My second kiss was better though.”
“Wonderful,” Sherlock said, smiling now, and that smile made John shiver despite the heat. “See you then.” And then, without any pomp or ceremony, he pushed John down the slide.
Margaret blushed and hushed her daughter. “We don’t talk about other people’s business, Angie,” she tried to explain and glanced at the boys.
“You mean exceptional progress Hamish,” Sherlock corrected, setting the small boy down. “Try and say it again.”
“Oh, I’m quite aware of that,” John grinned lewdly and Sherlock grumbled behind him something about being a “disgusting pervert,” but he put the flower back in his hair anyway.
“I’m gonna go on the slide,” John shouted over to Mike, who was heading out to the trampoline. His co-counselor nodded, swimming out, and John swam over to the slide ladder.
“Swimming is a very useful skill, Hamish,” he tried to explain. “You need to know it for your life. Just last week, Papa got thrown off the side of a boat by two drug smugglers. What would have happened if he couldn’t swim?”
“Wonderful observation Hamish; it is in fact pig’s intestine,” he congratulated, his hands full of the stuff. Across the room his husband was helping spool out the long, pink length. “Your father and I are testing to see if one could be strangled with it- a man’s life depends on it!”
“Let me look at you. Please. I’ve been so worried-“ he couldn’t talk, couldn’t explain to Sherlock the dreams of a thin, starved Sherlock, high and strung out.
“I was there when they picked those names!” Annemarie giggled and Hamish felt himself drawn in to her good humour. “It was a big fight. Your Pa wanted to be Dad and for Sherlock to be Father. But he refused; said that no son of his was ever going to call him Father like a title. So I suggested Papa and Sherlock decided John would have it.  He claimed it was a ‘cuddly’ name and John was the ‘cuddliest’ of the pair.”
it that it gets John.
John’s eyes widened a bit, glowing bright blue in the firelight. “Sherlock, there’s no pressure. It’s not a race to do it before I leave-“
“Has the crisis in Morocco escalated yet?” he asked briskly, not pausing in his writing.
“We don’t have lube, I’m sorry,” John murmured against Sherlock’s neck as he stroked them together.
“Help me with this, would you?” John asked, unrolling the two sleeping bags and unzipping them down the side. Sherlock held the seams together as John popped off the zipper and used the second one to zip the two bags back together until the formed one giant sleeping bag.
John didn’t think he could even bring himself to explain that he didn’t trust his body not to betray him in the night with some graphic dream, or worse, to wake up curled around the genius. So he swallowed and agreed.
“Thank god,” she breathed, squeezing their interlocked hands. “Cause that did jack-shit for me.”
“Much too cold-“Sherlock started and stopped at a noise from above them.
“I am capable of handling myself John,” he said and winced. Of course he wasn’t, he’d gotten so drunk he had to be carried out. The memory of it still made him cringe, made the phantom taste of sick fill his mouth.
“Are you suggesting we swim in questionable water, utterly naked?” Sherlock choked out as John’s thin fingers pulled his belt out from its loops.
“Joan,” Sherlock cut her off, even as her own thoughts were racing. Yes, she hadn’t signed up for any of this and yes, maybe she still didn’t know how she felt about any of this. Whether she believed that anything they were doing would change things, whether this more equal future Joan kept fantasizing about could even exist. But she believed in Joan, with everything in her, and for now that seemed enough to be going on.
I’ll be there at four
Sherlock stared at him. “You…do?” he asked hesitantly.
John moaned softly as Sherlock pulled at John’s lower lip and held it between his teeth before letting it snap back. His hand never left the older boy’s crotch and he massaged at it as he stole kisses up and down John’s neck.

Greg looked down at the thirteen-year-old and then nodded, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Wordlessly, he followed the rest out. When they heard the front door close, Sherlock slammed the flat door shut, vibrating with repressed rage.
I know, you berk. I expect a letter back.
“I want them to look at you and know you’re not unlovable,” John murmured against his cold skin. “I want them to have proof that somebody cares about you.”
“I don’t,” Mycroft objected, testing the chocolate with his pinkie and determining it hot enough. “Your father was the person I loved most in the world for many years.” He looked up to find Hamish staring at him, mouth slightly open.
He settled for taking her hand and squeezing. “Mary, you are brilliant,” he grinned and she smiled back, eyes twinkling mischievously.
“I will never get over how posh you all are,” John said in wonder, pulling up his trunks.
“Both of you, that’s enough.”
Sherlock was the first one to speak. “It would appear that you really are a detective,” he acknowledged and Hamish only shook his head at his father.
“Mycroft figured it out first. Told me not to tell anyone. When you dorm at an all-boys school, it’s not exactly easy if your roommates know you’re gay. Especially when they don’t like you much to begin with,” Sherlock added with a laugh instead of a sob.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft’s voice said, followed by a knock on the bathroom door. Sherlock paused in brushing her teeth but said nothing.
-“ Sherlock moaned like a terrible porn star and John laughed around him.
“See anything?” a voice called out and another voice, closer to the lake, shouted back, “No.”
“Promise,” John said, his hands pressing down roughly on Sherlock’s shoulders.
Amelia looked surprised and then pleased. “I’ll be there, “she confirmed. “This might be exactly what Chloe needs.”
“John,” she calls and he knows what she’ll say.
Sherlock rides out John’s orgasm until he comes inside him, sobbing and letting John’s name tumble from his lips. A prayer, of sorts. The only prayer he’s ever believed him.
Sherlock doubled back, finding himself face-to-face with the child. Hamish reached out and with total impunity, touched Sherlock’s nose with his first two fingers. “Boop!” he cackled and Sally and Greg looked nothing short of stunned.
Kelsie, along with Marcie, Jeana, and two other dy-
On the first Saturday of December, the Bushwhick girls soccer team won their very first soccer game against a prep school from Midwood. They made uniforms out of repurposed football jerseys from two seasons previous, invented hand-signs to mask Joan’s more colorful swears, took careful sips from a flask Marcie smuggled in to stay warm between plays and trounced the prep-school girls 3-1.
“I don’t-“ he tried and then it all began to come together in his mind. John was not stupid, by any means, but Sherlock did not exactly make her puzzles easy for the people around her and this one had taken so long precisely because John had solved it right off and then dismissed the answer immediately as impossible. “Oh.”
“You should come!” Joan grinned and Sherlock remembered suddenly that they were talking about a sign. She was having an actual conversation with Joan Watson. Granted, she hadn’t said anything yet but when she did, it’d be memorable. “We’re meeting tomorrow after school in room 408. I’m Joan, by the way,” she said, offering her left hand for a shake.
"We started crawling today," he informed his father.
“No,” he said, watching Sherlock as he flushed the bag of cocaine down the toilet. “Don’t you ever do that again.”
him, but it’s marks of ownership and Sherlock belongs to John, utterly and completely.
John glanced back at his cabin. James was standing on the top of a bunk bed, raining down pillow feathers on Sam who was beating Harry mercilessly with his still-wet toothbrush.
Sherlock really was by the side of the highway, sitting not in a police car as John had expected, but with a man of about thirty, with thick hair and a suit not unlike Mycroft’s.
that Sherlock couldn’t name, waved them over to their lunch table and Joan took her arm and stopped there for a moment on their way to the lunch counter.
Christ Sherlock, I think I lo-
One more day
“Need a job,” he excuses and she grins, overjoyed.
Sherlock practically
Sherlock thought, for the first time, how grateful she was to be alive and not a mother, as Joan watched her and smiled at her as if she knew exactly what Sherlock was thinking and loved her still. Loved her despite, and regardless, and because.
“Um,” he tried, struggling to form complete sentences, or even words.
Guess who’s finished all their A levels?
“You need a good seeing-to, Baby,” she threatened with a smile. “Why don’t you invite me over sometime, yeah?”
“She definitely likes me,” he decided and Mycroft only rolled his eyes.
“I’ll buy you a new one,” Sherlock counters and he twists and John’s coming all over his nice
Subject: I’m not
“Shut up,” Sherlock
“As if I was stupid enough to get high when John needs me,” Sherlock says angrily and Mycroft doesn’t respond. He gets in the car anyway. It was never really an argument.
“You’re the only person who knows beside Mycroft,” Sherlock told him. “And Mummy, probably. Never told her, but she has a way of figuring things out. She is a Holmes after all.”
Sherlock never made eye contact and, each time Joan opened her mouth to say something, she got up and walked away. It’d gotten so bad she’d taken to eating her lunch in the bathroom or skipping it altogether. Never had she met someone so pigheadedly determined in her life.
He didn’t take it, not at first. At first he fired her.
John turned around at that and Sherlock started. John’s eyes were wide like Sherlock had just shown him the holy grail and he was smiling and something in Sherlock shifted and he felt as if the floor was coming up to meet him.
“Well Paulie Peters Smith can protect you,” John apologized.
“I promised Sherlock a girl, Mike,” John laughed and Mike grinned. Sherlock suddenly felt exposed, like a pig on dissection.
It was like trying to hold on to a blurry picture as things started to fade in increments, leaving only John and his fingers in John’s hair and his mouth and the sounds Sherlock was trying not to make, moaning softly around every syllable.
Merry Christmas love
“Shit,” John swore. “Did you know?”
John was cleaning the damn thing, trying against all logical evidence to get it back to living order when he stumbled across the strip of paper. He skimmed it, doctor instincts taking over, and it wasn’t until his brain had processed the fact that Sherlock, it seemed, had a clean bill of health that he started and dropped the paper.
“Sherlock!” John yelled after him, holding the letter in his hands, but the boy simply walked upstairs and the sound of the bedroom door reverberated through the kitchen.
Sherlock sighed. “Because I’m Peter, obviously,” he explained. He’d taught John what that word meant, which was good because he liked to say it whenever John was being stupid, which was often. “Also, you tell stories.”
“Why rush?” Sherlock said, picking up a pile of signs. “It’s not as if it’s our first time breaking out of the school.”
“Nevertheless, I do hope you’ll consider it,” Mycroft sighed, standing up. Sherlock glared at him from the opposite armchair. He stepped carefully around the mess of the floor, which had once been papers and cups and was now toys and train sets.
“Harry came out.”
The blonde paused obligingly as the table erupted into shrieks and then went on. “-and she invited us to the NYRF meeting this Sunday. It’s at the Women’s center over by West 20

“The kind for people who don’t have their own team of chefs,” John explained, biting at the chicken.

“No love, that’s fine.”
and lit up like a Christmas tree. “Mary?” he called out.
“Must you always be so melodramatic?” Mycroft hissed at him, his smile never wavering.
They ran between Olivanders and Madame Malkins, buying wands and house scarves. There were pygmy puffs to pet at Wizarding Wheezes and butterbeer to drink at The Hopping Pot. It was like they were children again, running around London hand-in-hand, and it felt like taking a step back in time.
It was August. Neither of them realized as the calendar pages turned but suddenly it was a week into August and John had three weeks left in England.
“Shirt off,” Sherlock said, before she remembered she hadn’t worn a bra that day. But they’d covered her feelings around her breasts, hadn’t they, and it wasn’t as if Sherlock was shy about nudity, only about touch, so before Joan could do it, Sherlock reached down and tugged her shirt over her head, her head popping through the other side of the fabric in time to watch Joan clench her hand on her own thigh, staring at Sherlock in wonderment.
Sherlock grins, unbearably happy. “I invited some of our friends over tonight. I already cooked, last night while you slept.”
“Don’t worry,” he eased, settling her on his hip. “I’m sure she’s right outside. I’m John, this is Sherlock,” he introduced as Sherlock came over from the wall to join them.
“Sherlock, was it?” she asks, shaking his hand. “I’m Jane. Brendan’s at work, do you want to wait?”
“And where was the little rat pack you so enjoy traveling with?” he pressed.
Do you remember that time we drove out to the mountains and you had me teach you the names of the stars? You promised me you’d never delete that. Have you?
From her seat in the bleachers, hunched over her math homework, Sherlock hid a smirk in her coat collar. Joan was always at her most entertaining when she got swear-y. A whistle blew and the field was alive again with girls’ shouts and calls in the stiff wind. Sherlock scribbled out an answer, forcing herself to jot down ‘her work’ and cursed school as an institution. Back in her private school, she hadn’t touched homework with a ten-foot pole but, then things changed. Now the less her teachers noticed her existence, the better for her and Mycroft.
“I love you.”
CW: Non-graphic discussions of rape and abortion.
“Up until now it had always been enough,” Sherlock admitted and John let him burrow deeper.
“What are you doing?” he demanded.
“Dad, Pa!” Hamish moved towards the door and John immediately extended a hand to him, glancing quickly at the policemen in his home.
