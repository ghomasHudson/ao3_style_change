“It’s kind of like a prayer.  I can’t attend to each person’s every whim, so Heaven picks up on things people want and need and just kind of builds it for you.”
Dean finally dares himself to look up again, and sees Jack’s eyes light up.  He looks to Sam suspiciously, who seems equally confused.
Sam sighs.  “Well, how does the whole manifestation thing work?  Is it something you have to do individually?  Or is it just part of what you built?”
An angel is at the front door, angel blade at the ready.  “Dean Winchester,” she says coldly.
he got there.
Dean waits for something, anything to fight Duma to become available to him.  But so far, nothing.  “Run,” he tells Jack, Sam, and Eileen.  They sprint to the back door as Duma stalks behind closely.
He’d pasted on a smile and forced himself into acting normal today while they worked, teaming up with Sam this time to make sure he wasn’t pushing himself. Sam’s been stubborn about taking breaks, and Dean’s not about to let his bull-headed pride take him down after everything else.
“Yeah,” Dean replies, equally breathless.
Cas stares at him for a moment, looks down at the table, then back at Sam. When he speaks, it’s slow and uncertain, like he’s not sure he’s got the right response. “You’re… welcome?”
“Thank you. You look rather… festive as well,” Cas says, staring down at the motley quilt-work style of Dean’s sweater.
The boys glance at each other, the elder Winchester giving his brother a look of constipated frustration, which earns half an eye roll in response. Interesting.
Dean splutters, then scowls. “Do I look like I’m hiding?”
Of course, Dean had mixed feelings about the case, most of them negative.
Sam shrugs. “We haven’t exactly got a lot of alternatives. And for what it’s worth, I
Happy New Year folks!
Just as the coffee machine finally beeps, Sam feels something tugging at his pant leg. He looks down, into a pair of sleepy green eyes.
“You wanna get that one?” Sam asks him patiently, biting back a smile. Dean as a kid could be kinda adorable as it turned out.
, Dean.”
He sets the plates down in front of the kids before heading back to the counter. Dean reaches for one and digs in immediately. Mouth half-full, he says, “Fanks, Kefin.”
Castiel’s lips purse. “I can’t imagine it’ll do much good.”
Coloring slightly at the reminder, he grabs up a plate and utensils from the dryer rack before helping himself to a hefty serving of cheesy, chicken-y goodness.
Sam snickers into his eggnog.
It’s mostly a rhetorical question; he’s half hoping she’ll do the bad guy spiel and brag. If he’s lucky, it’ll be long enough for Sam or Cas to get their asses in gear and get the drop on her from wherever the hell they were. She has the gall to look pleased by the question.
He rubs at his forehead, eyes closed as he mutters to himself, “C’mon Sam, think. Where would she hide her spellbook and hex bags?”
It’s also a science. One that he has only just begun to grasp. It fascinates him how different food tastes when it’s made with love and care. It tastes better somehow, richer.
Dean stands stiffly nearby, watching Crowley with a narrow-eyed look as he hovers his hand briefly above each object. He doesn’t really
Having polished off his dinner, Dean extricates himself from the dining table while Sam and Cas keep talking. Depositing his plate in the sink, he nabs a clean plate from the dryer rack, piling on a few of the remaining slices.
Cas shrugs agreeably.
He hurriedly gets in, grimacing as the water soaks into the seat. Dean would kill him for this. Well, the adult one would, if he ever found out.
Dean leans back, reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes with a thoughtful frown. “Not really? Cas’d been yammering about a bunch of things while we were sorting, same as when we’d first started. Dude’s like a damn encyclopedia.”
Dean doesn't say anything.
“Stay here,” he orders the kids, heading for the windows at the front of the house to peer outside.
“Funny. You’ll need more than just one shirt though. You wanna show me where you found this?” Sam asks, dumping the Batman t-shirt into the cart.
Dean aggressively side-eyes the radio and skips through a few channels.
“An exquisitely handsome specimen of humanity, then.”
“I did,” Sam agrees, smiling wider. “Figured you’d like to have one that was all yours.”
Kevin bristles a little at that; Cheetos
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas’ arms come up, one going up into his hair as he takes control of the kiss and the other reaching to grip at Dean’s sweater. He can feel Cas smiling into the kiss, so he draws it out a little longer, just so he can enjoy the feel of Cas’ smile pressed against his own mouth.
Sam sighs, rubbing at his eyes with one hand while he closes the book. He hears a quiet
the one who did the damn spell.
Taking the cue, Cas responds in kind, taking charge of the kiss. It’s not as clumsy or fumbling as Dean was expecting the dozens of times he’s imagined it before, it’s
Tall, blond, and grumpy wasn’t all that different from the more sullen guys passing through, often tired of being on the road for who-knows-how-many hours.
Sam’s still frowning at the contents of the fridge, wondering if maybe he should have another talk with Dean when he opens his mouth to respond and finds himself saying, “Like I barely survived being roadkill some days, but… good.”
“What, got bored watching cartoons?” Sam asks, turning to face him. It’d been a little over two weeks since Dean and Cas had been turned into kids. He and Kevin had been managing well enough, even if the last few days of downpour put the brakes on anyone leaving the bunker. It’s not much of a surprise that Dean was starting to get antsy being stuck in the bunker, though Sam’s surprised he managed to hold out for this long.
Before he can say anything to calm them down in case they’re in the mood to scream, the younger one – a scrawny kid who’s maybe four years old at best, with an unruly mop of dirty blond hair and a smattering of freckles on his face – decides to speak.
“I might be a dozen different kinds of stupid sometimes, but I’ve got enough sense to not screw up one of the few friendships I’ve still got.”
Dean huffs, glancing away as he mutters quietly to himself, “Dunno if this is worse than actual therapy.”
Castiel shakes his head. He isn’t about to let Dean unnecessarily redirect his anger onto Sam. “He was reluctant to talk about it but I inevitably gleaned some details from him. It wasn’t difficult to put it all together after that.”
“About two days. Thought I was imagining it at first, ‘s why I didn’t bother telling you about it before.”
“Well,” Dean hems, “it’s not like there’s anyone else around here to teach you, so why not."
“Yeah, roadside tchotchke given by a kid with a huge crush is a real treasure, ain’t it?” It takes him only a second to realize what he let slip, and he freezes.
“There’s a bright side?” Dean says skeptically.
He stops abruptly as he enters the kitchen, staring around in confusion. There’s a casserole dish of something or other cooling on top of the stove, and a giant closed pot of something cooking away on the burner beside it. Across from it, the kitchen island is practically covered in a mess of ingredients and utensils.
Cas frowns down at his hands where he’s fidgeting with them absentmindedly. “He was frustrated afterwards,” he says, more to himself than to Sam, “I suppose he hadn’t managed the joke the way he intended.”
“You wanna come with?” Sam nods to where Dean’s wandered off and waiting impatiently for them to follow. Cas gives the rack in front of him an assessing look, before turning back to Sam with a shrug.
They spend the next few minutes combing the grounds, shouting Dean's name, the raining drowning out their cries. They’re both sweeping their torchlights in wide swathes, hoping to find something when Sam’s light suddenly passes over a dark, child-sized lump under a tree. Before he can even train his torch back on the location, Cas drops his torch and runs.
. This level of sappiness has been heretofore unprecedented in his brother, but hell if finding out about it doesn’t tickle Sam’s funny bone something major. He’s definitely going to store this up as blackmail material for years if only to watch Dean squirm.
Cas doesn’t respond.
He really needs coffee.
“What?” Dean says, loudly. Castiel looks up at the interruption, taking in the confusion on his features. “I dunno what she did playing with your noggin, Cas, but you never killed me.”
is why I tell you to be careful.”
“You’ve got no experience with kids,” Kevin points out, just in case Sam had forgotten, “so I’m just covering my bases. Figure you’ll learn something out of it before we get them back to normal.”
Dean very nearly jumps out of his skin at the sound of Cas’ voice. Instead, he ends up knocking the can of blueberry compote off the island and onto his foot before it rolls onto the floor with a dull
Sam steps down into the kitchen, eyeing the brownies cooling on top of the stove, before sliding over to the ingredients corralled together on one corner of the island, to the dirty dishes and utensils in the sink.
“No,” Cas answers solemnly.
It takes a few minutes before a disgruntled reply comes back from the hall at the far end of the library, followed closely by the sound of approaching footsteps. “There’s no need to shout, jeez. Tablet reading is enough of a headache without you screaming my head off.”
Sam coughs quietly, clearing his throat to get rid of the uncomfortable, scratchy feeling and takes a moment to think it over. He clears his throat again when the feeling persists, and says, “I’m not much of a fan of hangovers either, so I don’t usually drink much. Water usually helps with getting the headache to go down a bit. Can’t really help with the nausea though; people have different things that work for them, so I can’t really suggest anything.”
“You think?” Sam asks, amused.
Sam's ears go red as he mutters, “I’m sure.”
He’s not sure he’s ready for this, never thought this would be a possibility even though everything Cas has done for him over the years should have given him some idea of how much he means to the guy. He doesn’t know how to deal with being that important to someone; it’s not like with Sam because it’s different, he’s always needed Sam more than Sam’s ever needed him. His life has proved that over and over again. He might not survive needing someone else as much and then losing them, and losing Cas would
“Well, I’m beat,” Dean says, faking a yawn and a stretch. “Don’t forget to clean up and feed Crowley.”
to come so close to touching them, but it’s something of an old habit now, and the closeness helps him focus while trying to pick out nuances in the magical signature of the objects, if they had any. He takes longer than he normally would, allowing himself a moment to muse over the possibility of whether Dean could get any stiffer if he had a curtain rod shoved up his arse.
The twink grins. “The sexy kind.”
Dean can’t even finish the thought, face growing hot as he mentally splutters.
“Mmm, what’s that smell?” Dean asks, following the scent to the kitchen.
“Nice moves you got there, Elvis.”
“You remember,” Dean says softly, both question and statement, voice barely loud enough for him to hear. Cas purses his lips, before giving him a slow, stiff nod.
“Ask the little half-angel brat,” the Empty cuts in flatly. “I’m not staying in this stupid dimension any longer than I have to.”
“Evening, Feathers,” Crowley says, setting down his book as Castiel wanders in with dinner. He doesn’t react to the nickname with his usual frown, just stops at the door, and stares at Crowley blankly.
. “Yeah, alright. It’s a date.”
And that, that hurts. As if Dean would try to hurt him, just to make a point. He resolutely pushes that thought down, because now is not the time. Cas is still upset, that much is obvious, but not as much as he when he’d started. Looking at him now, he just looked sad and tired.
“Benny and his nest used to haunt the seas down south for their hunts before they Shanghai’d his ass to Purgatory.” He glances away then, feeling an unsurprising mix of guilt and regret as he thought of the last time they’d been on decent terms. “They ran a tight operation until we kiboshed it.”
“She’s gonna help read the weird scwibbles?” Dean asks, staring at her curiously.
“What’re you tugging at my shirt for?”
“I-” Sam sighs. “Yeah, okay.”
Rick glances out the window out of habit, doing a double-take as he catches sight of the shiny, black, beast of a car parked by one of the self-service pumps outside. Not many people drove classic cars like that these days. He’s almost certain he’s seen it around town a couple of times over the past few months though he’d never caught sight of the owner. He can see a guy sitting slouched in the passenger seat, but it’s too far for him to make out any details. In any case, he’s more interested in getting a better look at the driver than at his buddy.
though?” She nods at Dean. “Thought you had better taste, old man.”
“You didn’t think to ask me first?” Dean says. “Also, 4AM? Really, dude?”
“I can no longer imagine interacting with the world any other way. Losing it would be like losing a limb,” Anna says, paling at the very thought. “But I understand your fear. Change is never easy, especially when you have to be the one to take the first step.”
There are sounds coming from the corridor and Dean knows what’s about to happen. Sam will come in, first, and right behind him the creature wearing Cas’s face. Dean’s not sure he’ll be able to look at that face, but he has to act before Sam, too, ends up in chains and Dean—well, Dean’s probably next in line for becoming a human torch.
Though the paint is black on dark rock, its glistening makes the writing clear. It looks fresh—too fresh. Almost alive, with the thick layers of paint streaming down in thick drops.
“Pamela. I don’t have a familiar.”
He sets to it as he always does. Clear head, deep breath. Cas says soon it will become a reflex. Then he reaches to the flame, palms cupped around it, just on the edge of its warmth. It reaches back. The tiny flame, instead of dying, wants to grow in his hands. Dean forces it down but it fights back. Must be easier to create than to destroy.
Including the graffiti sprawled across the floor.
Dean turns around, light shining deep into the narrowing corridor. There’s something there, a dark shape, hidden right outside the reach of the light. Is it a person? The monster? Or is it just a tall rock that’s blocking the path?
Saving people, taking care of Sam and Cas, that's damn job and he couldn't even do that right.
The smile he gets in return feels electric, but in a good, pleasant way — as Cas’s smiles tend to feel these days.
"Hi, Castiel-for-now," Dean greets him with a smile on his face he can't hold back.
With a thundering
“Is it ‘cause I’m a firefighter? Because I don’t expect to put out fires any time soon, with my mind, I mean,” he explains. “I’m way behind Cas and even he looked rough dousing out the fire, so I doubt I will ever get anywhere close,” he adds with a light chuckle.
When he opens his eyes, Bobby is gone. So is the water mixed with the goo that Dean was kneeling in. There's something hot trailing down Dean's face. He touches it; it's blood. His own, this time.
“You’re not vegan, are you?” he asks, trying to be cool about it.
Dean jumps out. Aiming straight for the monster. For just a second he’s taken aback: it’s not Cas’s face that’s hiding behind Sam. It’s his own. His own posture, his own clothes. Except for the movements—those betray the thing. Just a little crooked as the thing tumbles backwards to dodge Dean’s punch.
“Wow, that was—”
"That's it?"
That’s how the ritual goes: the binding spell, the chain to forge the bond. The chain that Dean’s been preparing for the last six months, carving sigils into the metal and imbuing it with his magic. He poured his heart into it to make sure the bond between him and his familiar would be as strong as can be.
“Oh.” Of course, Benny died. He had to go somewhere. Or perish. “I suppose there aren’t that many options to choose from.”
Others have gone all out. He can see from the corner of his eye fruits that he doesn’t recognize; red meat still vibrant and bloody; someone even pushes a live bird in a cage towards the flame. Dean winces when the flames swallow it up and it screams. He tries not to think about it as he pushes his basket and lets it be consumed by the fire, too. His is not full like those of the other witches, and it doesn’t contain anything of value. It’s just vegetables and fruits from Bobby’s garden, and black cat bones for the sacrifice part—not even a real sacrifice. The cat had belonged to Bobby years ago and died of old age. Dean just dug up her bones.
Dead or alive, Cas can't hear his prayers. He's just a human now. But in case there's still some sliver of the angel radio left in him, Dean's gotta try.
He never heard the Kellers' voices but he knows it's them. And Kevin's mom and Sarah Blake.
But then, here they are. A bunch of guns and knives between the three of them, zero information on what nasty can be hiding here, and no plan. Dean might not like research but he likes going in blindly into what for all intents and purposes is a deadly trap even less.
“It’s...unrealistic,” Cas decides, to which Dean huffs out a laugh.
Cas is gonna die. Sam is gonna die. Dean might as well rot away in here. All that he'll have left of Cas is this stupid, precious rag. He roots around for it in his pocket, but as he pulls it out, the scrap slips out of his fingers.
“Sammy?!” Dean shouts into the darkness. His voice tumbles around the walls and comes back to him. “Sammy!”
On the day that Cas saved his life.
Dean cracks an eye open but he’s not looking at the unchanging flame. He spies Anna’s eyes wandering through the window into the landscape of the town stretching below. A perfect moment — he blows on the candle, quickly, quietly so that Anna doesn’t notice.
“It takes time, Dean. Don’t get discouraged.”
It’s coarse and solid, made of the same rock as the rest of the corridor. Dean presses his hand to it, as if he had to make sure he’s not just seeing things. He must be seeing things because there used to be an exit here, he should be looking out into the stupid chamber, not staring at the wall.
The panther jumps on the ground, graceful and silent, and Dean stops breathing.
The extra workload helps, somewhat. He knows he’s gonna get over Cas eventually. He might have a huge crush, but it’s just that, really. He barely knows the guy.
Nothing matters as long as Cas is here. His shirt smells of sweat and dust and soap, its fabric soft in Dean's grasp.
“Wow,” Dean blurts out, a little out of breath. And a little nervous too. “Didn’t expect that.”
On his knees, Dean rushes to the other corpse. It's not the right shirt, now that he can see it up close. It's plain white, without blue, crossing lines on the fabric. Dean gets a grip on the man's shoulder to turn him over and by touch alone he knows it's not Cas. It doesn't feel like Cas.
“Pamela,” she corrects him.
“Castiel?” he breathes out, and the huge cat roars in response. Something like a shiver traces its fingertips up Dean’s spine. This is his familiar. He knows it. Can feel it deep in his bones.
Dean keeps scraping, uncovering more of the paleness, its round shape. The trails of goo from the wall keeps pouring over it and Dean reaches to wipe it away. The moment he touches it, he knows he's touching skin. Then two eyes open and Dean jumps back.
His clothes melt into his skin and his skin melts off his bones. The stench of burning meat becomes unbearable but it hardly even registers to Dean.
Cas was real. He was there, in that crawlspace. His anchor. Cas has been the only real thing all along.
Dean doesn't really have an answer to that, or to the self-content smile on Castiel's face.
"Can you see him?"
“I’ve been thinking a lot. I know you offered me your friendship because you don’t think we could work as something more. Because you’re asexual and I like sex.” The words keep coming all too fast, but Dean can’t hold back now. “And these months of your friendship have been amazing. But I can’t stop thinking about you as more than a friend.”
It doesn’t take more than a minute of stillness between them, but Dean knows exactly when he can open his eyes again, when he can let his hand down and pull away.
He let everyone he loves die, anyway. This is mercy.
Pamela reaches for something under her stall. Metal flashes under the light of the candles. With a swift motion, a sharp pain shoots up Dean’s arm, and blood blossoms from the cut on his palm.
As if to underline that though, the main pyre flares higher for a split second, and then a dove flies out of it.
Dean inspects the flame for a moment, then he closes his eyes, and the flame is still there. He takes a deep breath and moves his hand closer to the flame, just on the edge of its warmth.
Still, every now and then, his muscles tense up, his spine itches and he can't stop himself. He whips his body around, ready to shoot, ready to fight whatever monstrosity has been creeping up to him. But there's still nothing. An empty corridor, the same walls ad nauseam.
whether or not one answers him. And that’s without thinking about the fact that Dean has to bind it. All by himself. Using his weak ass magic.
The red blossoms on Sam’s skin. The swelling grows as they watch it in the beam of Cas’s flashlight. The gigantor was bound to go tumbling down some stairs and break an ankle sooner or later. He just had to pick the worst possible moment for that: in the middle of a case, down in this shithole of a tunnel.
Instead of pushing himself away, he finds footing on the opposite wall. Putting all his strength into his arm and his leg, he thrusts to move his pelvis closer to the wall.
He'd never have to drop to his knees, scared and alone and not significant enough for this fucking tunnel to have some goddamn respect.
Dean doesn't mind.
She must have been surprised to hear from Dean yesterday, a message out of nowhere, asking for a huge favor. A huge time commitment, that’s for sure. He’s not expecting to succeed any time soon.
Has he noticed something new in Dean that Anna forgot to warn Dean about — something that a magic user can see in another?
How could he live through this? How can he still be clinging to life—be trapped in it?
Was it Cas's throaty scream for help? Was it Sam's furious bellow?
Not a hole into a passage. Something pale. Right outside the ring of light.
Of course, Cas isn't there because Cas won't wait for him. Won't save him this time.
The date saved, for now. And Dean’s got another great idea.
“Hey, lovebirds!” comes Benny’s voice from the common room. “Bets are over, we’re waiting for you.”
“I’m your what now?”
No such luck, though. If there are still any bodies to speak of, they’re rotting in the monster’s lair. Hopefully, the Kellers aren’t among them.
He feels it.
“It’s just a sprain,” he reminds Cas, under his breath, nuzzling Cas’s ear. The words and the caress can’t take away Cas’s frustration but it helps ease him a little, or at least makes his fist loosen. “A couple days and Sam’ll be good as new. Well,” he adds louder because he wouldn’t be himself if he didn’t—the legendary hunter Sam Winchester defeated by a bunch of stairs—he’s never gonna let him live that one down, once everyone’s safely out of here, “except for his pride.”
It just hurts, knowing he will never see Dean again. How can he sleep if he can’t stop thinking about him? About the terror on Dean’s face as the Empty was taking him. About every moment, good or bad, ever since he pulled Dean out of hell.
He feels for the flashlight that went out as it hit the ground. Instead, his palm lands on something slick, squishy and long, almost snake-like.
No—he can't just die here like that, he cannot. He didn't go through the shit that his life has been just to die here like a dog, with this tunnel as his tomb.
Cas is not wrong. Dean would never try. Not if it wasn’t for Cas. But that’s good, Cas will never expect what Dean’s cooking for him.
With a craned neck, Dean keeps moving. Cas's name spills again and again through his clenched teeth. It took Dean months to find Cas the last time they played this game of cat and mouse. And then he lost him anyway.
“I think you’re just afraid.”
Nerves thrumming with anticipation, Dean runs to secure his place just as the sound of drums accompanies the beginning of the ceremony. He’s rehearsed this part endlessly for the last year or so, but his fingers feel sweaty, the words clumsy as he chants the summoning along with everyone else. Did he kneel in front of the fire too fast? Or was the girl next to him too slow? Is his offering enough?
Dean snaps his head around to look at Anna, grateful for the distraction. "Uh, coffee would be nice."
"Go ahead," he lets out through a clenched throat. "Kill me, please."
No, no, he didn't. There was no blood. Or was there? Dean closes his eyes, presses his hands to his head as if that could help him make sense of his thoughts.
It couldn't have been Cas because Dean's seen Cas be many things but not a simpering dog cramped in a filthy hole like this. Cas is the size of a skyscraper. Being stuffed into a tiny, human body must be humiliating enough.
“Benny?”
He walks. 'Cause what else is there to do? At every turn he seems to be chasing another intangible shape, another echo.
He's got less than ten minutes until his shift begins. But that's enough. The one thing he knows about the farmer's market is that it's not far from the firehouse—he passes by it every time he goes to check on Sam and Eileen after work. Two minutes each way, less if he sprints. Which he's totally not going to do.
Dean steps closer to Cas, shoulder to shoulder. He finds his free hand in the darkness. The tension’s there, as expected. He knows Cas all too well. He wraps his fingers around Cas’s wrist, the thumb brushing the soft skin covering his veins.
It works. Oh God, it works and Dean gives out a relieved noise, as his body’s set free.
To that, with a smirk, Cas waves his hand, he sends the bees away, towards the field of colorful flowers coating the remainder of Cas’s estate, where they can grab themselves some good, good nectar and come back to turn it into honey. Or however that works.
Whether it’s the confession or the words written in magic, or Dean practically conspiring with the bees, a huge smile blooms on Cas’s face.
Dean doesn’t miss the hesitation in Cas’s voice before the last word.
“What if she’s the real deal?”
There isn’t a sliver of proof she’s trustworthy at all. Her prophecy could have been a flux. Could have even been a set up, somehow, though Dean can’t imagine why anyone would go through the trouble of setting up a joke between two worlds just to make fun of someone as unimportant as him.
It's like dragging himself across big Lego blocks. Whoever bore this shithole, did a piss poor job of it. The rough, poking edges, grate across his ribs, bite again the bones of his forearms. His shirt is thick enough to protect his skin from tearing, luckily.
They stop at a few, admiring the collection of exotic stuff they can’t find in their local shops, and Sam turns on his puppy eyes until Dean caves and buys him a book on crystals and their magic properties—the kid is a certified nerd!
But he feels different. Narrow and thin. Dean knows by heart the way holding Sam feels. Embracing him alive, cradling him dead.
The ritual hasn’t stopped. The familiars are still coming through one by one, choosing their partner to be bonded with for life. The circle around the pyre keeps thinning as the witches leave with their new familiars and go back to their tents to get to know each other and to prepare for the festivities.
Three thousand and seventy two, three thousand and seventy three. How much further does he have to go?
“No, thank you,” he says. A beat. He clears his throat. “I’m good.”
As the blood seeps out of the wound and into Dean's eye, something else pours in.
He slides the light up the stone to examine it. If it's a loose rock, maybe he can lift it. Just a little bit would be enough.
Something glistens on the ground right before his face. A few drops of a liquid, flickering orange. When Dean touches it, it doesn't feel like blood or water. More like oil.
“What?”
Retracing his steps—again—is his only way to go. Annoying as fuck, but still.
Dean levers his shoulder against the wall. Though his muscles are all fired up, he gives all that he's got, pushing himself away. His hip doesn't budge even a hairbreadth.
Cas swings the light to the other side of the corridor. The gray shade of the back wall hardly shows in the light, but at least they know this section doesn’t veer off forever. It’s not a deadend, though, there are still the crossing paths Dean can see by the way the light breaks.
it, he could swear. If he tries, now, he can pull it, he can reshape the flame any way he wants it.
"Wake up, Sammy." Dean's voice is small and broken. He can't even hear himself above the pounding in his ears. "Cas, please."
But then from among all of that, the low electricity of Cas emerges, the energy Dean knows well and gets to taste every day. It grounds him. Cas is there for him, supporting him. Then, taking over from him.
Somehow, without his permission, his own magic seems to be guiding him. And so he follows.
"Well then, if you ever change your mind, come find me, I'll get you in right away," Dean says, for some reason finding himself loath to say goodbye. "See you around, Castiel. And thanks again."
Except he won’t get the chance.
the hail of voices says.
"The farmer's market?” Dean doesn’t like the way it sounds. “When did you turn into my brother?"
He has to go through the whole check up and promise he's gonna show up at the hospital today for further exams, then he's finally free to find the guy who saved him.
Or maybe Cas is back with Sam and they’re waiting for him, debating whether to go in to look. At this freakin’ pace, they’re all gonna get lost. Mystery solved, and there ain’t even any monsters needed.
Dean turns around. Now that he takes a proper look at the path he left behind, the change is there, gradual but steady.
“You know I can’t do that, it’d ruin the surprise,” Dean says, stupidly.
He pulls away, gives Dean some space. Could it be really Cas?  After all this, can it be Cas who finds him?
With a flicker, the flame goes out, a trail of smoke rising in its wake. Benny and Charlie cheer, while the rest of the traitors that bet against Dean, sound a little more begrudgingly.
“It’s the monster, Sammy!” Dean shouts, as Sam paves a way for him. Dean has no time to check if Sam registered his words, if he is on Dean’s side. That's fine, he’ll take the thing down on his own.
And then in the silence left in the wake of Cas’s scream, comes the quietest sound.
This isn’t gonna work, is it?
Instead, there's a mess of black hair on his head sticking out in all directions. He's wearing nothing but a white undershirt and boxers.
Dean’s hair brushes against the rock. He slams his palm to the ceiling. When did it get so low? Just what Dean fucking needs. Explains why Cas’s form appears so twisted and small, before disappearing beyond a turn.
“Really, just give me a moment and I’m good to go.”
“Yeah. I have greatly expanded it in recent years. To think that I started with one hive about a decade ago,” Cas muses, lifting up a finger for one of the bees to sit on it. Soon another bee joins it.
, passes through his mind. She wouldn’t want that for him, but it’s a fitting death.
How could he ever want to enter a burning house, in the waking world, again? Yes, there was a concern of Dean freaking out once inside, going into a full-on panic attack. Childhood traumas can be like that, catch you off guard even if you don’t plan to let them.
“I told you it wasn’t your fault. It was me, I— “
Still, Dean's calves tense, stupidly, his toes curl in his boots. He feels like a child whose feet poke out from under the blanket. He wants to pull his legs up and hide them from sight before the monster can reach out and grab him with his claws. But there's nowhere for him to hide. If anything's creeping behind him, it's got him on a silver plate.
Until nothing changes into something. Cas blinks. It’s just a shadow in the darkness, he could be seeing things. But he’s sure it’s there, though it can’t be. With each step closer taking in more shape, more solidity.
Admittedly it would be cool, even on a small scale, with fire little help is still help. But he's not here to become a wizard. He’s got a very clear concept in his mind and blowing out candles with his mind — or worse, setting them ablaze — isn’t gonna get him any closer.
wants a familiar.
It only moves down as the candle melts away, all too fast until Anna needs to replace it. Because imagination doesn’t do shit to matter. Touch does, muscles do. Not the mind.
“Dates.” The word tumbles out before Dean can stop himself.
Though Dean could swear—
But the shape moves again, farther away from him.
Dean slows down; his legs threaten to give in with each step. With one hand pressed to the wall, he manages to make it to Sam.
Dean drives his fist into the low ceiling. Something comes off it, falls on his face, and he squeezes his eyelids shut to avoid the debris: dust, crusty pebbles, soil. No, not soil.
“Oh, I do,” Dean barks back. “How about we not make it three, huh?”
This can't be happening.
A part of Dean wants to flee. Another part, namely, the freaking butterflies in his stomach, can't wait to see Castiel again. And that part easily wins.
Cas opens his mouth to say something, but closes it when he looks at Dean. His eyes widen with concern.
that slashes right through Dean’s thoughts, the main pyre flares, an unstoppable blaze that curls up towards the sky in an explosion of light and heat.
Cas is dying a death so painful—Dean knows too well the agony of it, after all these years, he remembers. Hell.
"Castiel.”
He doesn't even move, as Cas’s lips slide down his jaw, down his neck, as Cas’s fist yanks down the collar of Dean’s shirt to free his collarbone.
"It was close but then— Well, actually, what the hell?"
There’s space for Cas, there, but Cas doesn’t follow suit. Instead, he sweeps the area with his flashlight to make sure no toothy dweller is coming for them. Beyond the stairs, there’s a solid wall, half-covered with graffiti. Whichever of the kids gone missing in the last decade or so painted it, it was the last thing they’ve ever created.
Just like love, doesn’t it?
He’s given some thought to the message. Finding something age-appropriate was tough. “Will you be my boyfriend?” sounded way too much like middle school. So was “I
As he fought for his life that his big brother choked out of him.
Dean lifts his hand to his helmet, the only thing keeping him from sucking in the thick, scolding smoke right into his lungs. Suffocating has to hurt less than becoming a human torch.
He doesn’t put his gun away this time. There’s still something in these tunnels. It might jump him any moment and he’s gotta be prepared for that. But it’s not behind him, it couldn’t be. So he gets a little better at ignoring the raised hairs on the back of his neck.
“But you told me upfront that you like sex. I shouldn’t have led you on, cuddling, kissing when I knew—”
"Thank you. I was sure I was toast there."
“I’m glad too. I hope you took good care of Dean,” Benny says in a tone that won’t accept no.
Or dead.
Dean met Anna exactly once, at an impromptu tea party on Cas’s patio — just the three of them. Not even close to an awkward meet my family dinner they might have had if the circumstances were any different.
“What do you—?” No, that’s not relevant. “How are you here?”
It’s only their third session, sure.
"No, no, no!"
He scoops himself up to his feet, ignoring his quaking knees. At least he doesn't have to play trial and error this time. Especially since he might not have too much of it.
What do angels have to do with this whole thing?
“I’m happy for you.”
“I saved your ass twice now and you’re calling me a show-off?” he says, the lightness back in his voice as he pretends to be offended and fails.
“Too many if you ask me. I miss Purgatory. This? This is cruel.”
“We should go,” Castiel says, getting up. “We have your honor to rescue.”
“It’s been seven years since we met,” Cas says. Met with a silence, he adds, “Do you still think about him?”
He's not fucking crawling in. If he does, he's sitting ducks. Besides even if this hole leads anywhere, it's not somewhere he wants to be.
“Sounds good,” Cas says without hesitation.
More blood comes off with each gentle stroke. Dean doesn't stop even as it becomes apparent—the face beneath is soft and round, smeared with traces of pink lipstick along the purple jaw and the noise is pierced with a silver stud.
in gold loopy letters.
“Uh-huh, we’ll see about that,” Dean mutters, lifting Sam’s foot as gently as possible and resting it on his lap. The hissing sounds escaping Sam’s lips on every touch vouch for Sam’s words. If it was broken, it wouldn’t be hurting like this, right away. But a sprain doesn’t make things any better.
“You’re never gonna believe who I met at the farmer’s market today, Dean!” Charlie says in lieu of hello, two weeks or so after Dean nearly burned to a crisp.
Whenever he reaches that damned chamber again, he is going to pick the middle tunnel. For all he knows, it might lead him even deeper under the town, and he doesn't have to like it, but he has to try and find Cas. Besides, isn’t it always like this? The only way out is through and all that?
“I don’t know. You feel lighter.”
Has Bobby gathered up a search party to come looking for him?
His fingers curl into a fist. He drives a punch to his side to force his hip to move. He hits his stomach, his thigh, but nothing gives. All that it gets him are a couple more bruises in the making.
"A chance for?"
No, no, it can't be. It's just a shadow. His skin is pressed tight to the bone. The bone won't move, as his fingers try to pry it every which way.
But that’s not what Cas is saying.
Dean shifts his focus back to the field of flowers ahead of them. He pulls and the flowers give. The pollen and the pure scent carry up and move toward them, past the hives, luring the bees out. Forming the letters is the hardest part, leading the bees perfectly, making sure they don’t descent into chaos or get hurt.
It doesn’t matter, though. Once he focuses all his power on casting the binding spell, the lights will disappear anyway. He needs to stay focused on Castiel, convince him to not run away again as he’s trying to bind him.
“Hello?” he calls. If it’s a monster, it knows Dean’s here, anyway. “Who are you?”
“Did you miss the part where we’re in a friggin’ Bermuda tunnel?”
how you feel about
“Okay,” Cas says. He looks like he’d rather get eaten by a snake, but he’s moving finally, away from prying eyes.
“At least I found you, Cas,” Dean says, a hundred years and ten inches away from the asset’s broken nose. “I never stopped looking, you know that?”
“Why not?” Dean says. Cas can start to feel a headache brewing behind his eyes. Dean, among all his better qualities, has always been stubborn. “I’m a super soldier, Cas. And hell, I’ve beat you when you were in Soldier Mode before.”
“See you soon, Cas. Bring Mr. Handsome in here next time, I want to trade recipes,” Ellie says, winking a long-lashed eye at him. The doorbell chimes behind him, and the mother of the town auto mechanic comes bustling in. Dean talks to her sometimes when they’re both in line at the Family Dollar. She and Ellie start talking rapid fire about Thanksgiving, something about stuffing preparation.
The subs, piled high with deli meats, Dean’s homemade giardiniera, and four different kinds of cheese, are delicious. They have seconds, spilling lettuce on the floor and giggling until Jack, awake from the noise, shuffles in for his too.
“What is this?” Cas asks quietly.
“It’s okay,” Dean is saying. Hears himself saying. It takes a second for them both to get their feet sturdy. Dean just wants to clutch Cas to his chest, make sure he’s breathing still. That this is real.
“Me neither,” Castiel says simply. Dean leans forward to rest his sticky mouth on Castiel’s cheek, and then breaks away like he can’t bear it. Castiel is barely conscious, and he further sways into Dean’s arms. He is confident Dean can hold his weight.
This time, he knows where he’s going. And despite how far away it is, how unlikely his
“Whatever that means,” Dean says. Cas is more adventurous with his cooking than Dean is, who prefers the burger/casserole/sandwich/steak side of the culinary arts. Cas has done tiny, delicate tea cakes, to earth-shatteringly hot curries, to somehow getting fresh salmon in the middle of a landlocked state, to generally good reviews.  Dean sometimes sits and watches him cook when he can, although Cas doesn’t do it very often. Cas cooks very carefully, like the bowls he uses will crack if he looks at them too hard. Dean guesses it’s a remnant of his angel sensibilities. He touches everything like it might break.
“Dean,” Cas says again. Dean comes above the cupboards with a dented baguette pan in his hands. He places it on the counter and slaps his hands together, turning toward Cas’ direction.
“Let’s make some better memories, huh?” Dean says, mouth firm. Dean wants to put all of his love and care into that shoulder pat, but he is just a man, and a shoulder pat is just a shoulder pat.
“I will be there,” Castiel says, his mouth overtaking his mind with his decision. Dean looks immeasurably relieved and in that moment, Castiel cannot find it in himself to berate his choices. His mind 一 always running, always cautious 一 is finally quiet. Jack and Sam round the corner a second later, obvious surprise on both of their faces at Castiel’s appearance.
He stretches his arms out in a yawn and watches the side of Cas’ face as he looks out into the darkness. He really is a handsome sonuvabitch. He could be the talk of the town at any bar he ever went to, but he’s here with Dean in a gazebo, watching the stars with him.
“No problem,” Ellie says. She throws away her dirty plastic gloves and puts on new ones as she waits for Cas’ order. Her tattoo of Snoopy crunches inward as she flexes her arm. “Dean send you here for something special?”
Jack is behind Dean, gleefully peeling potatoes on the dining room table. Sam is reading a book and waiting for the jalapeño poppers to bake, and Dean gave Cas a wink and asked very nicely, so Cas is staring at a bowl of romaine and croutons, trying to remember what goes in the Cobb salad at Applebee’s. Surely there are too many ingredients in this bowl, he thinks.
“I know you’re nervous. Hell, you’ve got a lot of reasons to be, Cas. But-” Dean says, inching forward. In this kitchen, it feels like a mile. He points a finger at Castiel’s chest. “You’re lying.”
Cas hums next to him, pulling his trenchcoat over his thighs like he’s cold. Dean stands up, and after a second of thought, sheds his outer layer too. Now he’s only down to his undershirt, his t-shirt, and his plaid shirt. He rolls up his sleeves too, because Cas did it and it looked good.
Cas is frequently overwhelmed with his love for humanity. That feeling has been filtered through his human synapses and through his hands and he suddenly feels, more than ever, like he’s done the right thing. That there could be nothing in Heaven like this. That he doesn’t really mind the small talk. That humanity has been extended to him like a gift, and he has taken it, and it always feels like he doesn’t deserve it. That someone will take it away from him at any moment. He wants to live and fuck and die. He wants it so bad.
“Uh, there’s a big story behind it, which we can get into later. But the gist is,” Dean says, grabbing Cas’ hand from where it rests on the table. “Uh. We. Cas and I.”
Castiel makes the deal and refuses to think about it for a year.
“I’ll show you another way,” Cas says gently. Dean lets Cas’ gentle hands move him around until he’s swinging with his back instead of gathering momentum with his arms. Cas digs his hand into Dean’s hip and moves the right side back slightly, his other hand on his shoulder. Cas’ face is warm next to his. If Dean closes his eyes, he could imagine Cas was about to dip him.
“I wasn’t joking before,” Dean says, breaking the silence. He slides his eyes from Cas’ face to his sensible boots. They’re scuffed. It’s nice that there is something about Cas that is moldable, that can be touched by time. He can lean down and slash a mark in Cas’ shoes and it’ll stay there. Cas would bitch at him, sure, but it’s proof Dean was there, and that he touched him.
“Alright, we’ll take ten,” Dean decides. With some rest, the ankle should get better before it gets worse, “then we’re heading back.”
But that’s not the part that offends Castiel. “Waste?” he echoes, eyes narrowed.
“Sorry, Cas. I didn’t mean to—”
There's no answer.
But it's just 'cause he's stuck in this crawl hole, that's all. There's no hungry creature following him.
Because having him in eyesight will do much when something much faster than any of them jumps Cas and tears his throat to ribbons before Dean can even get up off the floor.
The flames crawl along the gray streets on a play-carpet of the children's bedroom towards his feet and he scoots away, but will soon run out of space to escape to. The fire will reach him, encase him and he'll burn, burn, burn alive here.
There’s no judgement in his tone, but his eyes are fixed on his plate.
There's no sea of blood. His arms and clothes are clean, so is the path that led him here, there are no gleaming reflections when he casts the light behind him.
“Now, pull out your hand and slowly move it toward the fire, until you feel it on your skin and stop there. Right there, at the very edge of its warmth.”
It's too much, there's too much blood. Cas couldn't have survived it. He's dead and his body’s been dragged away. Ahead, the puddle stretches into a smear.
Castiel pushes himself off the table, his teeth bared as if he forgot he’s not a panther right now.
Dean runs his hand across his face. He hates to be a whiny brat, but this aimless trodding is beginning to take its toll on his legs. He can’t slump down on the ground and take a rest, though. He has to keep moving, or retreat and find the right way out.
“I’ll go check the corridor,” Cas announces. “You two stay here.”
Dean reaches to it before he can stop himself and touches the paint with the tips of his fingers.
As Anna leads him to the living room, his brain fully begins to process her words and an odd feeling overcomes him, a warm feeling: Cas talked about him to his sister. It shouldn’t be a surprise, of course Cas talked about him — they’ve been friends for months now. You talk about your friends to your siblings. Dean for sure mentioned Cas to Sam once or twice. Or ten times.
Just a final push, one kick to get his pelvis through and he'll be out of this hell.
The man raises his head, eyes finding Dean's, and moans out Dean's name.
The light. It comes from the entrance, shaky and growing with each moment. Its source is obscured from Dean's view at first, but he can almost recognize it from the terror on Cas's face.
He knows the way to the Paradise Bee-Gained stand by heart.
He can’t blame her — he didn’t think he’d come. But there’s no way he’s letting on his hesitation and unease. He’s here so he’s doing this. Though hopefully, today is just a theory lesson.
"We're here," Cas says, at last. There must be something different about the sweeping strikes of his marks that told him, because Dean couldn't tell this corridor apart from all the rest.
Warmth flushes over Dean, the pleasant kind. His whole life he’s been dreaming of having someone he’ll call his familiar. He never thought about how it’ll make him someone’s witch.
But there’s something more than that, right here, right now.
Cas lies down on nothing. It’s neither soft nor hard, it just—isn’t. But he knows where the up is and where the down is, so at least he’s got that. And there’s more of nothing above him.
Dean doesn’t want to dwell on that — on feeling objects without touching them, however that’s supposed to work. But the words stick with him anyway. Is that what Cas was talking about? About the entire world shifting, the profound change in perception? Will he begin to feel things even though they’re far away from him?
Cas is burning.
Dean shrugs innocently and slumps onto the couch next to Cas. A little too close to Cas, because now their thighs are touching. Neither of them moves away, though.
He tightens his grip on his gun. It's a faux comfort; it would be nearly impossible to shift his arm back to shoot when he's got barely enough wiggle-room to grovel.
“Listen, Cas, about that night — I shouldn’t have rushed. Guess I got a little rusty on the dating front.”
“You hesitate,” Pamela says, her voice honey-sweet and kind. “You don’t trust me. That’s okay. I’m used to it. But give me a chance. I’ll read your palm for free if you want, and you can choose to purchase one of my other services after.”
Any loose movement Cas has he uses to get as far from the slithering fire as possible, but it only buys him a few inches.
It’s unsettling that she knows his name, but that doesn’t mean that she knows what she’s talking about. Reading someone’s aura is easy. Communicating with the otherworld on the other hand is a rare ability, almost unheard of.
He was building something, at last. Maybe in the end he could have had a life. But this? Not a demon, not the apocalypse. Just some freakin' hole, stupid, lifeless piece of rock trapping him. It can't end like this.
“What?” Dean’s eyes widen. “The hell you’re not! We’re not splitting up.”
When Dean told Sam that he was gonna be a firefighter, Sam looked at him in that odd way, like Dean just told the joke, but the joke wasn’t funny. Like the joke qualified Dean for a temperature check, because maybe he was feverish. How could Dean possibly want to be a firefighter, if he still woke up at night drenched in sweat, the night their mom died still plaguing his dreams, decades later.
They turn to move to the next stall when a small hand closes around Dean’s wrist and stops him.
Instead of entering the clearing, Dean slips behind a tree. He needs a plan, something that could use the element of surprise to his favor. His magic could reach Castiel from there, barely, but it should. Except it doesn’t feel right; sneaking up on his potential familiar, hitting him, sleeping, with the spell—it’s almost like an attack. Not a good way to begin a long-lasting relationship, or any relationship for that matter. Dean’s got more honor and decency than that, even if it means he’ll lose him.
There’s the freaking fork and there’s the way to the chamber. The design of the walls lends itself perfectly to illusions. Dean followed the curves of the tunnel right where it wanted him to go, back and forth.
Dean never felt guilty for loving and leaving. All parties involved were always on the same page and he made sure of that upfront. No heartbreaks, no hard goodbyes. And he doesn’t feel guilty now, just afraid he’s losing Cas there.
“Need help?” Cas asks and doesn’t wait for the response.
“I thought you wanted to bond with me.”
But Sam’s far more vulnerable than Cas, right now. He couldn’t defend himself, couldn’t run. So Dean stays, though still fuming at both his companions.
And most of all—
In just the two weeks, Cas already got some fiery action — one minor house fire and the burning forest that they managed to save for the most part — it should be back to its former glory within a few years, with a little help.
All too soon, Anna’s back with two cups of steaming coffee in her hands. She sets them down on the table and takes a seat on the opposite side.
“Good,” Anna decides. “So you know what you’re in for. And that once you’re in, you’re in.”
No. No, no, no, this isn’t Sam.
Pamela takes a deep breath, inhales the smoke, and throws her head back.
Going back is the only thing he can do. He doesn’t run this time. His legs could use a break, in case there’s something to chase after, or something to run away from. There’s hardly a point, anymore. He’s wasted too much time, put too much distance between Cas and him. His chance to catch him is blown: by now, Cas might as well be in the very heart of this maze. Dean’s gotta be smart, not fast.
At the end of the tunnel, Cas takes a careful look to the side passage before turning back around. He gives Dean a small nod, as he begins walking towards them again. His face is a little too far to read it—too far to see it, really—at the edge of the light.
Now Dean can’t help but scoff. “Lady—”
The flames go out.
There must be better ways of approaching this. Cas doesn’t put out wildfires by letting them grow — but those lessons are still ahead of Dean if he chooses to keep pursuing magic. He hasn’t decided yet because right now, he’s got everything he needs.
This isn’t a proposal, but it stresses Dean out like one, as he spreads the blanket down on the grass in Cas’s garden. A few yards away, thousands of bees swirl in their happy dance, sendinding the vibrations into the air. Their buzzing is like music, like an old song Dean’s heard before but can’t quite recall.
“That’s enough for today,” Anna says, putting the candle away. “You have some thinking to do and decisions to make.”
This is so unlike it, so passionate and born of need, born of fear. This is gonna leave bruises but it's worth that price.
The Empty promised Castiel sleep. An endless, peaceful slumber. So why are Cas’s eyes open? Staring ahead into the darkness, anything that extends outside of his body is just darkness and darkness and nothing. It’s a strain, having nothing to fix his gaze on; his human eyes and his angel eyes still trying to, against his will, looking outwards and outwards, reaching as far as they can. There’s nothing. All is empty.
“You know, magic.”
“Looks like that wasn’t in the cards for me,” Benny muses. A curious smile plays on his face. “I’ll keep falling asleep then wake up. Too much going on in my head to fall asleep again. So I took a trip. You’re the first person I found.”
Dean tries real damn hard not to let his disappointment show. He must have just missed Castiel. Or maybe Charlie was messing with him—no, impossible, pranks are one thing, being this cruel? That’s just not Charlie. She knows the matters of the heart are not to be joked about.
"Come on, Sammy."
His suffering is over.
They’ve only done it once before, in the comfort of Dean’s bed. Cas wanted to take it slow. Dean wanted to teach him of every inch of his body, of closeness and of pleasure.
He misses the sound of Cas’s steps. At least then, he knew he was going the right way. That he was going toward Cas, not farther away from him. Now all he’s got is the sound of his own breathing, the rocks scraping beneath his boots.
Dean closes his eyes and slows down his breathing. He needs to be quiet if he wants to listen, he needs his heart to quiet down too. With enough focus, a few soundless steps to the mouth of the right tunnel, maybe he’ll get a clue. Or maybe he’ll get all three of them lost for good.
They’ve been friends for long enough.
Dean’s not even capable of noticing the cruel irony. He rushes to Cas's side, but he can’t even touch him.
He reaches to Sam's face. Brushes away his hair—stiffened with blood and sticking to his skin. With his sleeve, he begins to wipe away the blood that must have come from the cut on the forehead.
“Good luck, rookie.”
And Cas didn’t even give him the whole alien-like apiary attire to protect him. He said he doesn’t even own one. What kind of beekeeper doesn’t have one anyway?
Before Dean can think of anything to say, Cas beats him to it.
"Not really," the kid says. "It's me and Muriel in sales. Castiel takes care of the lil guys. The bees, I mean. Production."
“Maybe I’m just not cut out for this,” he grumbles.
“Oh,” Dean lets out. He blinks at the writing. That wasn’t the plan. BE Mine. It was supposed to say BE, but the focus on the bees with two e’s must have crossed Dean’s wires and there he is and he didn’t even manage to play it cool and pretend that was the plan all along. Still he tries. “Yeah, like the bees, you know…”
Dean furrows his brow and turns his head back only for a moment. "You know this tells me absolutely nothing, right?"
It's a head, chopped off. With a hat, beard and Benny's blue eyes staring right through him.
Oh God, not this, not this again.
Cas shrugs.
The coffee smells better than anything Dean could manage to squeeze out of the crappy coffee maker at the firehouse, but he’s a little too anxious to get on with it to taste it first — and not in a good way.
As if charmed — or rather actually charmed, Dean realizes — all the bees outside the hives shift their routes and fly up, all in one direction, then they split to form spirals and the swirl into different shapes as the gentle movement of Cas’s fingers seem to lead them, like a conductor leads an orchestra.
But maybe Sam is right. And he is a little curious.
Everything goes black.
Is it trying to tire him out? So that when the boss fight comes, he rolls over and takes the hits like a meatsack?
It's not so bad at first. Dean knows how to crawl. There's still some stamina left in his arms and legs. Little by little he pulls himself deeper.
“Please, Cas, wait for me!” he pleads, but Cas doesn’t even flinch.
As a few chuckles break out from the crowd, a hot wave washes over Dean’s body. He should have never even come here. Now he’s gonna be on tongues of everyone, a funny story to tell for all years to come. A cautionary tale for young witches when they’re not too keen on practicing their spells.
Oh, Dean’s got it bad. And he’s nearly certain his face is now the same color as Anna’s hair.
So that’s as solid a plan as any. And he can only hope that by now, Sam’s ankle got better and, as agreed, he hauled his ass out of here.
Another step and Dean's foot slips from under him. He drops his flashlight and lands on his ass with a disgusting squelch on something wet, thick and chunky. It can't be blood, not just blood.
"What are you—?"
That’s when a thought occurs to Dean. “Are you controlling them?”
The thing will die, it’ll die right now for what it did to Cas, for what it did to him, earlier, in that tunnel, wearing Cas’s body, wearing every inch of it.
Well, a magic one, apparently.
Sam looks equally as terrified. “Tell him what?” he asks.
“But what if she is?” Sam insists. He glances in her direction, mouth opening and closing in quick succession. Finally, he swallows. “It’s at least worth a try.”
Screw the flashlight, Dean's running out of there. But when he turns he can't take more than a few steps until another figure appears in the darkness. There's a bandage on its head but blood keeps seeping out of it anyway.
Dean bites his lip. He didn’t expect the question. And he doesn’t really have a good answer, one that wouldn’t make him sound like some huge player. Not the best impression on the first day with a guy he’d like more than have sex with. But it’s true. Most of Dean’s life he spent in motion, never more than a few weeks in one place, until he settled down in Lebanon. The habit remained.
Dean blinks.
There's fire, creeping up on the oily trail stretching from the doorway to the tight circle surrounding Cas.
he thinks, running his fingers through his hair. The gun is cold as it touches his scalp.
But it doesn’t matter, it’s close enough for Dean’s surprise.
And when Cas breaks the kiss, it’s only for a moment. With a waves of his hand, he overpowers Dean’s hold and sends the bees towards the field where they can savor the real deal like Dean can savor Cas.
“What?” Dean opens his mouth to say, but the word dies before it makes it past his lips.
That’s how Dean ended up with roast beef with mashed potatoes and just in case Castiel, with this whole farmer’s market thing and bees and all, is a health freak Sam somehow grew up to be — he’s got a chicken salad prepared too. And then an awesome blackberry pie for dessert. He did pretty good and the food smells great, so at least that part he doesn’t have to be too nervous about.
He bends his neck back, sends a wistful glance at the exit. He was so close. Now he's gonna rot here.
When has the tunnel become this narrow? A few steps forward and his shoulders can hardly fit in.
He’s handsome; strong jawline covered with a shadow of a stubble, straight nose, big eyes, almost black in this light but Dean can’t help thinking about them as anything other than radiant blue.
There’s a dark figure emerging through the flames, lithe body moving at complete ease inside the heart of the fire. The black, velvety shadow stands out against the orange glow of the pyre, as do the bright blue eyes that are fixed on Dean and Dean alone.
“Us,” Castiel finishes for him, once again in his human form.
No, no he wasn't. Cas is here.
He jerks back, holding the injured hand close to his chest. “What the hell, lady?”
And then Cas leans forward to kiss him, in case the words weren’t enough. Oh, how Dean missed it, how he craved it.
A shiver goes down Dean’s spine. Not the best of omens to start his Samhain Feast.
Luckily, he's still there, helping the rest of the guys put the fire out. He looks more than a little pale, Dean would venture a guess even paler than him though Dean was the one threading through the actual fire.
Dean’s eyes snap open. He jumps off the windowsill and nearly dashes to the kitchen. He digs through the drawers until he finds a few spare candles from Sam’s birthday cake.
“Easy,” she says, setting down her cup. “Before we get to it, first tell me what you even know about magic.”
Dean’s not even being smooth when he shifts closer and throws his arm around Cas’s shoulders. He doesn’t miss the slight tension that appears in them, but it eases just as quickly.
Except for one thing, the plaid scrap grasped in his fist; his little anchor. It's here, so Cas was here and Dean can find him. Dean puts the piece of fabric back in his pocket to avoid losing it. He can’t lose his one connection to Cas.
"For now," he says and Dean can't help thinking that he's teasing him. Because for now means there's gonna be a later. And Dean wouldn't mind. Castiel's deep, gravelly voice might be doing things to him.
It's Cas's face. They're his eyes. But they're not his eyes. The figure frees himself from the wall: the pale coat, the twisted tie, and it moves towards Dean. The goo flows down, no longer from the wall but from Cas's dark hairline, from his eyes, nose and mouth.
Castiel.
“Well,” Dean starts, hoping a joke will brighten things up, not make them even worse, “it’s ‘cause you’re a show-off.”
"Trust me," Cas says, dropping it to the floor.
It’s too late to halt fully. His feet tangle as he tries to slow down, but he’s not fast enough and, with impetus, he slams into the wall, his left shoulder taking the brunt of it. A grunt slips out of his mouth. That’ll leave a bruise, nothing more. He’s fine.
“What about it?”
With quick precision, Dean checks his arms, his torso, his head for wounds he's too buzzed to feel hurting yet. He finds nothing but for a few scratches.
There’s Dean’s face again. In the broad daylight, it’s still brighter than the sun. He’s talking to Cas and his words don’t really matter, it was one of those days when he’d talk about beers and burgers and the last vamp nest he and Sam slain.
“I’m joking, Dean,” Castiel says, showing absolutely no remorse for almost giving Dean a heart attack. “I tend to pick meat from farmers that treat their animals well but I’m not going to refuse it now that it’s done.”
Just a few months ago, Cas could have fixed that major setback of a minor injury with a touch of his fingers—now he can’t so much as ease Sam’s pain.
Because this cannot be the end.
Why the hell is Cas letting himself bleed out?
“So what
He drops his eyes to his own hands, his knees, the frayed hems of his coat. Those are real, solid things. Only real things in the vastness of here.
“No, I, uh, I was thinking about something specific.” He flicks his wrist half-mindedly, the way he saw telekinetics work on TV,  the way he saw Cas do sometimes. “Maybe we should start with a feather? Or specs of dust,” he adds hopefully. The tinier the thing he’s supposed to move with nothing but his mind, the better.
“You’re not putting that on me.”
He gives Cas an innocent smile. “It’s almost fall, kind of the last chance.”
Benny laughs. “Why am I not surprised?”
“This is nice,” Cas says, lifting his face to the sun.
He sits back up, as if it changed a thing, wraps his arms around his knees. Eyes ahead, again, stuck on nothing and nothing and nothing.
It’s not going for a bite. It’s meant to graze along Castiel’s sternum and slither through the space between his ribs. Once the spell is wrapped around Castiel’s heart, the connection will be opened between the two of them and Dean will be able to build the bond from there.
This is gonna be a long walk. How long has it been? Half an hour, at best? And he’s so fucking done already. The only thing he wants is to grab Cas and Sam on his way out and be done with this place.
If he had a sharp object on him, he’d go full Saw on his leg and he wouldn’t care, as long as he could save Cas. But all his weapons are gone.
With each step he’s getting closer, it’s almost a relief. But Dean won’t be truly calm until Cas is safe within his arm’s reach.
“Awesome,” Dean decides. “But for now, dessert.”
"Alright, let's find Sam and get the hell out of here. I'm beyond done with this place."
Sage Honey.
"Did you see it? All of that?"
It’s so out of place, isn’t it? He’s probably being rude or at least annoying. But Castiel doesn’t seem annoyed. On his face appears an enigmatic smile.
No. He can't be dead. He can't.
Dean lifts his head to look at Cas, confused.
Dean preferred the amateur art and tag practice by the stairs.
"What the—"
As if he didn’t notice there will be no surprise. This is the end of it, isn’t it? She’s not telling him to ask for advice. She’s telling him to
Pamela frowns at him. “Making fun of the blind witch is not very nice.”
It's near damn impossible to squat with his thighs stacked together, let alone keep moving like this. At last, it's zero to one for the fucked up game of Limbo as Dean's knees buckle and hit the ground with a concerning creak.
But a glance across tells Dean why. It's not much further before the light spills into a wider space, another corridor, for sure, but anything's better than this.
It doesn’t work with his eyes open, with the brightness of the flame burning its afterimage into Dean’s retinas and threatening to give him nightmares hardly any house fire ever did, after their house fire, at least.
There's a hold on Dean's shoulders, shaking him until his eyes open.
Could the bonding work without it?
He shines the light into the opening; sighs in relief that it's a door to a chamber, not another tight corridor.
If anything, he expected one of those long, slender candles you stick into candelabres, but he might have some prejudices there coming from a lifetime of only seeing magic practitioners in the movies, so he keeps his mouth shut.
Dean drags himself across the floor. There is no one around him. No Bobby, no Cas, no other people he left for dead.
How can he be here?
But there’s nothing they can do about that now—about Sam’s leg, about Cas’s fizzled out grace—so what’s the point of getting angry? Cas’s fall wasn’t his fault nor his choice, though since Heaven’s Gate closed, that was pretty much a given. Sure, it had been nice to have an angel on their team, able to save their asses and kiss their every boo-boo better. But in the end, no one’s gotten
"I thought the same about you, Dean," Cas says. "I'm sorry I ran, I was sure—"
From the moment he found Dean. When they—
"Firefighter Dean," Castiel says, evenly. "I almost didn't recognize you without the soot on your face."
Dean guides the beam of light, back inside. Back to the gleam of white that caught his eye. It's lodged just a few feet deep. He should be able to reach it without crawling all the way in. And so he does, dragging himself in on his elbows.
Castiel crosses his arms. "Did you come here to offend my brand?"
Benny lets out a chuckle. “So that’s why the Empty is asleep, at last.”
The crawlspace narrows rapidly. The bulging blocks protrude from every side. Like someone got tired of their tedious job.
“There exist people powerful enough to put out fires with a snap of their fingers,” Cas muses, setting the empty cup. “But I’m not one of them.”
Dean beams, sending a tiny tuft of air to tickle Cas’s cheek in thanks. Who cares that he cheated if no one but the two of them will ever know?
But Dean can’t reach him. All he has to do is to stop the fire from getting to Cas, but Cas is too far away.
A soul-tearing cry echoes in the distance. Then more screams, inhuman almost, and crunching and thumping. Like a losing fight.
No—why would he do that? Why would he wanna abandon Dean, alone, in this place? They should be finding each other—they have fought for it so hard, before.
"If you chose me then why did you run?"
Dean scrambles off the ground, shoots forward. The yank at his ankle makes his legs slip from underneath him and slams him back on the floor.
If he only got to them a few seconds earlier.
How long has it been anyway? Dean cats a long look around, as if he could find a point of reference, anything familiar about the surroundings. But every inch of the wall looks the same to him, it’s impossible to tell how much of it he’s put behind and how much left there is to cross.
He can’t back out now.
The only red present is bright, dried paint. Its squiggles curling around the stone paved floor.
Right now, he doesn’t care about the birds, though. It’s early afternoon and the only sounds coming in are the buzz of a distant traffic and the shrilling laughter of the neighbor’s kids playing in their garden.
He merely glances at the candles — their wicks sizzle as tongues of fire grow on them, out of thin air. Dean’s breath catches for just a moment. He nearly forgot the things Cas can do.
Dean keeps on chasing, calling Cas’s name. He couldn’t have gotten that far. He only had a few seconds of a head start and Dean’s still a faster runner than him.
And then it stops.
“Bee mine?” Cas reads aloud and Dean turns to look at him, shily. “With two e’s that’s so—”
He walks until the muscles in his calves begin to ache. And then he keeps walking, still. How long has it been? He can’t even count on the stars to help him tell the time, perfectly obscured as they are. The ritual surely ended by now. His chances of finding another familiar are gone. Have the festivities afterwards begun yet? Or are they nearing their end?
“Come on—”
Cas doesn't seem to notice anything wrong. "I didn't exactly find you on the third turn left."
With a sigh, Castiel moves his eyes in what must be a panther equivalent of an eyeroll. He climbs to his hind legs, stretching his spine up and with a smooth motion transforms into a man. He looks to be around Dean’s age, though the familiar’s looks might be deceiving. His messy hair, in this light, is as black as his fur was. His clothes, elegant and festive, are also black but for the tan vest with darker markings along the hems.
"Cas."
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," he says, wiping the blood away from her chin. He can't clean it all, there's so much more blood. In her hair, on her jacket, deep under her fingernails. "I should have been faster. I should have saved you."
The hand slips from Dean's grasp and as Dean turns around, all he can see is a rock swinging right at his face.
No, right now, Dean sits on the heated wood of his windowsill, curls up his legs, and gives the tree a good look instead. He counts the roots poking above the ground, then he counts it’s thick, wide branches. But it’s the contours of the leaves, gently trembling in the wind, that have him mesmerized. With his twenty-twenty eyesight, can he really try to count them up?
"I want to bond with you,” Castiel answers. “With you, not with the chain."
He shifts his eyes to the stand right behind Bess's as his fingers lift to his hair half-mindedly. He's not exactly gonna preen, but still gotta make sure that he looks better than the first time they met—though that's probably not hard since as it turned out later, there was soot on his face that neither of his so-called friends informed him about. Assholes.
It’s Cas and it’s magic and it’s
It's not paint at all. He knows the texture of it all too well. Black goo. Dean winces in disgust but doesn't pull his hand away. The wall beneath the goo is soft. It's not rock, more like clay.
He must have walked a mile or more by now. Half of it testing the limits of his spine and he's getting way too old for this. But he can only be mad at himself. For believing his eyes when he shouldn't have. Did he want to see Cas so desperately that he made up his presence?
Dean twists around just in time to see the crowd part before the panther’s roar, letting him through and into the open path.
“Dean, please,” Cas cries out. He can't hide the horror in his voice. "You have to save me!"
“All the time.” Benny lets out a heavy sigh, but there’s no regret in it. His voice is soft and Cas could swear he’s smiling. “All the damn time.”
"Looked pretty badass, came here to see if he could help and did. Rolled up his sleeves and went all—" Charlie lifts her palm and makes an intense face to present the supposedly badass look of Dean’s savior in action which only looks dorky on her.
to Cas instead of learning tricks to win his heart.
“Doesn’t it hurt them?” Dean asks, a little concerned for the tiny beasties.
With every step he has to suppress his long-honed instinct telling him there's something wrong, there's something there behind him.
So Dean learned to cook and Sam learned to stop fussing over most things; at time was even impressed, though impressing a ten year old ain’t that hard. For a date, though, not one of his innovative one hundred and one ways of making mac and cheese would be considered impressive or sane — especially not the version with marshmallows.
“So it’s not, like, a family business?”
Dean plows on, shoulders hunched to fit into the corridor. If he can only get the light to shine on them—
"I thought we were gonna lose you, brother. Don't scare me like that again."
Threading through is a challenge: the tree trunks, older than Dean’s people, leave little space to meander between, the roots and bushes are relentless in their attempts to trip Dean. But even if he has to risk falling on his face, Dean presses on.
"I'm so sorry, Cas."
There’s no time to hesitate or doubt himself now. Dean’s got a gamut of spells at his disposal and he’s trained them back and forth over the last year. Whether those, when cast by his hand, are anywhere near strong enough to bind a familiar this big, this emanating with power, Dean’s about to find out.
Dean almost laughs. There’s no way a familiar could be interested in him before he’s even made his offering. Even then, it’s a big
He knows exactly where he left Cas, without looking, he lands the beam of light at Cas’s leather shoes, their polished tips softly reflecting the light.
Sometimes in the summer’s early mornings, Dean likes to open the window, climb onto the windowsill and listen to the birds chirping in its branches (he doesn’t like those birds half as much when they wake him up hours before the alarm goes off).
Dean doesn’t see what the red-haired witch does next. He’s too busy watching as more familiars rise from the flames. Birds and cats. Dogs and lizards. There’s a monkey among them. All of them spring out of the fire to face one of the witches waiting around the pyre. Soon, spells are flying all over the place, witches and familiars sizing each other up, the former trying to prove themselves worthy and the latter trying to judge the potential of their prospective witch.
"Dean, it's me."
“I really had fun on our date, but I think it’ll be better if we remain friends.”
Dean’s watched Cas die before, but never like this. It’s almost worse than just losing him forever. And God better fucking bring him back, like he did before.
“I don’t know, man,” Dean tells Sam, quietly. “There’s something about this place—”
He yanks his hand away, and kicks his legs to get as far from it as possible, but the slippery ground makes it difficult. He finds the flashlight by sheer luck and almost twists his wrist on it.
It’s all going so wrong.
Dean leads Castiel to the table and just as his eyes fall down on the meal before him, a terrifying thought occurs to Dean. He’s a bicycle-riding eco-friendly bee guy. What if—
“You’ve been different lately.”
Is it? A date? Or is it just what they agreed to — a thank you for saving my life dinner? He doesn’t even know if Cas is into guys. Let alone into him.
He deserved it, for not saving Cas from his awful end. After Dean saves Sam, come what may. But he has to save Sam first.
Dean jolts up, back to his feet. This can't be— He buried him. He cradled Benny's head gently, tucked it in the ground in that forest in Maine and buried it with the rest of his body. He can't be here.
What about people — will he feel them too? Their presence in their absence, their voice in their silence? Doesn’t sound like fun, either.
He can’t let him slip away, again.
Cas steps even closer, pushing Dean until his back hits the wall. Dean swallows hard. This isn't that crawlspace, he reminds himself. It's just a wall and Cas is right here. Nothing bad can happen to him.
“It would certainly seem so,” Dr. Kerubin says after a moment. “The arm is putting immense amounts of strain on your spine, Mr. Novak. I imagine it is because of HYDRA freezing you so often that it hasn’t started impacting your spinal cord.”
All-in-all, for all of Dean’s constant changes, not much actually does. Dean and Cas still fight over the Brita filter. Miracle still chases rabbits outside the bunker. Sam, when he learns that Dean said something, has his thoughts confirmed and doesn’t give them shit when he finds them leaning against each other in the kitchen.
Not waiting for Sam to reply, Kevin directs him to get the eggs and bread while he searches the cabinets for pans and a spatula.
He freezes halfway up the steps when he catches sight of Cas at one of the tables, cheek propped up on an open palm, head tilted down to read a thick, old tome with yellowing pages propped open in front of him.
, I promise I don't bite :P
Sam runs a frustrated hand through his hair.
cry before.
Sam raises a brow at the admission, though the skeptical look still remains. “Like what?”
It explains a lot about the last few days. He’d been convincing himself that he was reading too much into things, but apparently he’d been reading a few chapters behind everyone else.
“What I’ve found so far’s entirely guesswork, in case you forgot. I could ask Cas if he remembers what he set off-”
“She didn’t let me go that far in being an idiot on the few dates we had, couldn’t go back home to Ben completely sloshed.”
He fumbles for his torch, switching it on before looking down at Cas. “Stay close.”
you can call me Charlie.”
The few times they’d managed to find themselves across from each other in the library usually ended up with them stuck in a semi-awkward silence limbo that Dean’s got no clue how to break. The ghost of their last argument still seemed to hang between them; back when he’d been faced with the possibility of Cas leaving them for good, he’d decided it wasn’t worth staying mad over. He’s just… never gotten around to saying as much to Cas.
expression. He darts a glance at Cas before clapping him on the shoulder. “You still like burgers, right, Cas?”
Noticing the look, Dean says, “Don’t pretend you ain’t got things you don’t wanna be forced to air out, even to Cas.”
He runs a hand over his mouth. “I’m not sitting here waiting for you to heal up so we can jump onto the next hunt we can find. I’m friggin

as Gabriel had decided to call Dean. At least this way he gets paid while doing it.
“Doesn't matter, I’m coming over. Bye, Sam!” Charlie says cheerily, hanging up.
Sam raises a brow. “I’ve been asking you if you wanted to come with me and the kids to the park since last week. You keep shooting me down.”
“Hey, thanks. You didn’t have to get me anything y’know.”
He’s never danced before and doesn't know how, but he’s seen Dean dancing around sometimes, singing along to whatever song is playing. There was usually a lot of hip movement involved and some kind of coherence to his corresponding arm movements.
“What?” Sam says, confused.
Dean snorts.
Dean’s eyes dart to him, perking up at the mention of food.
“Y’know, I think I might be able to help you with that,” Garth says. “I have an ol’ buddy who runs a hunter’s shop, trades in stuff required in our trade if you know what I mean. I’ll call her up and see if she has any in stock. If she does, I’ll get it FedEx’d to you overnight.”
Cas frowns down at the pie, waiting impatiently for it to cool.
Dean stares at Cas quietly for a long moment, lips pursed.
“Sam told you,” he grits out.
Dean scoffs, shoulders dropping, unable to stop himself from briefly darting a glance at Cas. “Seriously? I ain’t exactly a fan of your brothers, but being a human isn’t really a good trade-off for everything you gave up.”
“I can do it,” Cas offers, starting to get up.
“I feel… dissatisfied leaving things like this.”
He’s still not entirely adjusted to the Cas-is-human thing.
“Hungwy, Sammy,” Dean mumbles, knuckling sleepily at one eye.
“You’ll be going back to the storeroom after this I’m guessing?” Cas asks, watching a thrush fly overhead.
“I wasn’t asking.”
Cas interrupts with a confused, “That doesn’t explain why you’ve been avoiding me, I’ve ‘stuck around’.”
Cas stares at him.
When he meets Castiel’s eyes then, though his expression looks a little lost, it feels like some of the distance between them has lessened.
Cas blinks, glancing away. “Not very well,” he admits, voice wavering slightly.
“You think maybe the witch’s spellbook had something that could reverse this?” At Sam’s angry frown, he raises his hands. “I know, I know. It’s already burned. I was just tossing it out there.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “You make me sound like some kind of life coach. Besides, late-night snacking is a pretty human thing at any stage of life; don’t pretend like you don’t do it.”
“Dude, just rip it up. No one cares about the wrapping.” Dean groans. Cas ignores him and continues to open it methodically. He’s almost certain Cas is going slower now just to irritate him.
He decides to test a theory that’s beginning to take shape in his mind. “Is something compelling you to speak your mind?”
“I can’t stop telling the truth,” Dean says, running his hand through his hair agitatedly. Sam’s giving him a look like he’s gone insane, so this is going like he’d expected it to so far. Maybe he has, or maybe this is just some weird new strain of hangover-influenced nightmare which is eerily, uncomfortably realistic.
“It’s a bad book,” Sam reassures him, watching the fire eat up the spellbook and hex bags. “Bad books are supposed to be burned.”
“Look, just because I cured you doesn’t mean any of us suddenly trust you to behave out there or that we’ve become friends.”
“Honest,” Sam replies earnestly. “You’re my brother, Dean, and I’ll always love having you around.”
Crowley just barely manages to hide his surprise at his own words, just as Castiel straightens up, staring at him expectantly.
“I call dibs on having your first child named after me!” Gabriel says enthusiastically, turning to the latest customer with a big grin on his face. “Did you hear? Little Castiel finally found the balls to score a date with his childhood crush. Isn't young love so sweet?”
“I see,” Castiel replies, mostly to the floor. He needs- he needs space, to think, or what he doesn’t know yet. He takes a few steps backwards, bumping into the shelf behind him.  Sam winces. “Wait, Cas-”
Sam rolls his eyes. “You asked. Wait, is this why you’ve been acting weird?”
Sam sighs. “I don’t know why I expected something different.” With a shake of his head, he sets Crowley’s lunch down and makes to leave. “I need to get back to work, those negating spells you gave me were useless.”
As promised, Charlie arrives sometime late in the afternoon the following day, yammering excitedly as Sam guides her back to the bunker. The kids are busy poring over an old storybook Cas had found when Sam calls out to them.
be sorry for that.”
There’s a question in Cas’ eyes. Heart racing wildly now, Dean gives a small nod.
“This is it. This is the cause of this entire fucking joke. It has to be.”
“Well, since it looks like you guys have got everything set up without me I’m gonna go shed a few layers. I’m starting to sweat like a pig under all this.” Dean says, heading for his room only to be halted by Sam shoving a bag into his hands.
to sit next to Cas all the time.
Straightening up in surprise, he hastily tries to paste on a neutral expression as he turns to see Cas’ reaction.
“Don’t be too mad at him, he’s just not feeling well. It’s probably for the best since we don’t want you catching it too,” Sam says eventually, figuring he might as well attempt to console him before his mood spirals even more. It doesn't particularly work considering Cas is still glaring at him like all of this is his fault – which it kinda is. Sam sighs quietly, knowing it's up to him to fix the problem he made.
Cas catches Dean’s eye and pauses. He says, “Yes,” very delicately. Dean looks away, shy like he hasn’t been in a while. Like Cas is the hot quarterback bringing him home from their date at the friggin’ soda pop shop.
The bottom falls out. Dean Winchester hits the water at mach speed and is unconscious as soon as he breaks the surface. The Winter Soldier drags him to the shore and leaves him there.
“Hey Cas,” Claire says, breaking their deliberation. She’s wearing all black, which is familiar, and her hair is in a ponytail, which isn’t. She doesn’t look as grumpy as usual, which Cas views with a warm buzz in his chest. She grabs him in a hug, and he hugs her back, unsure of the backslap protocol but deciding to stay safe with none.
“What’s going on?” Cas said. In the dark of the bunker, Dean’s eyes were wide and shining. “Dean?”
He tries to imagine what he’s going to say to Jack, what his face will look like when Dean tells him.
Sam comes wandering in just as Dean teaches Cas how to crack open a crab. Cas is wearing a bib and is holding a crab knife with trepidation.
“Does anybody remember what the hell Kaia is allergic to?” Dean shouts into the room at large, his hands full of marinating short-rib. “Peanuts?”
Dean wants to bury his whole being into Cas’ body and zip it around himself. He has a sneaking suspicion that Cas would say the same thing about him, and tries to imagine them curled up together in a grave like those poor fuckers in Pompeii. To see the end coming and be cradled even in death.
Knowing where he’s going is also a struggle. He remembers the Empty: how vast it was, how his eyes tried to make sense of all that darkness, how futile it was. Despite what the Empty’s figurehead said, there were
They both throw the ball, Cas controlling Dean’s swing with his own arms and his own legs, strong and firm at his back.
Dean nods, and the Uber in front of them unloads the last of its passengers, and they slowly slide past Doll’s Saloon. Dean watches the sign get smaller behind them.
Dean thinks, and stays put right where he is. He releases the ball and they both watch as the ball travels straight towards the pins, hitting them with a good amount of force and knocking them all down.
“Cute bunny,” Dean says over his shoulder. Castiel resolutely does not flinch, even though his true form shudders in his vessel at the sound of his voice. The nearest trees sway despite no wind.
“Hey, help put that away,” Dean warns, and Jack sighs before straightening up and grabbing a package of toilet paper to put in the bathroom. Jack had requested chocolate ice cream, Spaghetti-Os, and chicken nuggets on the weekly shopping list, and Dean had begrudgingly agreed, even though he knew he could make better nuggets than that if Jack had asked. “Cas is cooking tonight? I thought it was leftovers today.”
“Nothing’s wrong, Dean,” Cas lies. He closes his eyes as a warm breeze comes off the water. “I’m just savoring the Earth’s pleasures as long as I can.”
Dean sat up then, his upper body naked and covered in goosebumps. Cas leaned back to look at him, propping his head on his hand. He watched as Dean massaged his fingers, one by one. He didn’t make eye contact.
“Bowling?” Dean says, caught off guard. “I think Sammy got invited to go for a birthday party once. Why?”
“It’s not because of you,” Cas says carefully. He resolutely does not look at Dean, and Dean suddenly feels like he’s being coddled.
They leave the bowling alley in pleasant silence, letting the night swallow the chatter and liveliness behind them, and they get back into the car.
Dean pastes on a smile when the conversation stalls as they both turn to look at him.
Castiel glances down at the tiled floor guiltily.
Cas tips his head in acknowledgment. “He’s gotten rather bored.”
every so often to prove I’m still on the straight and narrow and all that. Well, in a manner of speaking of course.”
“Well, he’s stress cooking,” Sam says, eyes widening slightly before his jaw snaps shut. “Forget I said that.”
people."
“What do you remember about those old Egyptian myths I was obsessed with when I was a kid?”
“You've got a little…” Dean starts to say, moving closer to brush the flour out of his hair. Cas squints at him, reaching up to brush at his hair and looking down at his hand in mild surprise.
Caught off-guard, he blurts out, “You,” before immediately squeezing his eyes shut.
Cas sleeps in and misses breakfast, which is a surprise to no one at all. Sam volunteers to wash up the breakfast dishes and shoos Dean away to get started on work. Dean would
Uncomfortably aware of Sam watching them, Dean’s careful not to stand too close to Cas as he explains how the game’s played. He gets the gist of it pretty quickly but keeps holding onto the cue like he’s planning to hit someone with it.
“She’s got a basement,” Sam interrupts. “Saw it when we turned the corner.”
need to go to bed,” he says, indicating himself and Sam. “So how’s about you guys brush your teeth and get changed, and I’ll let you stay up in your room.”
He flicks a glance at Sam who’s leaning back against the kitchen island and trying his best to not radiate smug satisfaction at having caught him and Cas under the mistletoe together. Charlie’s standing next to him, not even trying to hide how pleased she is by this. Kevin’s the only one who doesn’t seem to care – he rolls his eyes and goes back to pouring himself a cup of eggnog once he realizes what’s going on.
Fuck.
Dean sees red. Completely ignorant to the impending explosion of Dean’s powder-keg brain, Cas responds, “I’m too old for you.” Like that was the only reason to turn him down.
He hates what he’s about to do, but it’s for the best - for both of them. It’s the coward’s way out, but it’s better if he just denies it and allows Cas the opportunity to find someone better suited for him. Someone who deserves the love and undying loyalty the guy has to give, without being shit scared about being the focus of it.
He grunts in surprise at the impact, which distracts Cas and sends his shot wild, sinking the cue ball instead of whatever he’d been aiming at.
(See the end of the chapter for
to be a pretty standard hunt. Find the witch and make some half-assed effort to convince her to stop (Sam would want to try and Dean’s never been that good at saying no to his bleeding heart brother). Failing that, gank her. End of story.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
“Again, that helps us how?” Dean asks. Sam dips his head in agreement, glancing at Crowley expectantly.
Sam huffs. “No, but I think I know someone who might be able to help.”
Kevin stares at him for a long moment before sighing and leaning back. “How am I the only normal one around here?”
Dean turns to glare at him, only to find Cas already watching him, trademark stare firmly in place. His blush turns deeper, spreading down to his chest.
Kevin frowns. “What do you mean, ‘you can’t find Dean’?”
“You’re not exactly careful handling artifacts, Dean. Maybe you set something off.”
Sam hunches over, head bowed and hair falling into his face. “Kev,” he says, voice small and plaintive, “what if they’re stuck like this?”
“Moose. Squirrel. To what do I owe the pleasure?” He glances at the small clock on the shelf. “It isn’t quite feeding time yet.”
Dean grunts in acknowledgment. Depositing the spilled flour into the trash, he carelessly drops the dustpan aside, brushing his hands off on his jeans.
Dean stops, half crouched with an outstretched arm, frozen in place by an invisible force. He tries to struggle against it but he might as well be a statue for all the good it's doing.
“It’s not about whether or not you can heal me, it's-” Sam sighs. He’s not sure what he’s trying to say here, honestly.
The scarf paired with his ridiculous red sweater makes him look a bit like an idiot honestly, but Dean doesn’t doubt that he probably looks much the same since his own sweater looks like Christmas threw up on it without the scarf on top of it.
Sam catches it with ease, pulling the wrapping apart to find a soft red turtleneck sweater with a large golden reindeer on the front. Dean smirks at him. “Thought your Christmas wardrobe could use an upgrade.”
He leans back with a sigh, rubbing at his jaw. “Seeing as these old codgers have a grand load of bupkis on what to actually do now, any bright ideas? The truth ain’t pretty and no one's gonna like the stuff I’ll end up saying, least of all me,” Dean says.
He’s never had a need to consider the prospect before, but now that Dean has set it before him… He ponders aloud. “Heaven’s not made for angelic retirement, so I’m not sure where I would go. I suppose I could travel again-”
“Food for thought,” Crowley says with a shrug, going back to his dinner. He looks back up just in time to see the door closing.
“What about you?”
“I’m gonna go back to my office, act like the adult I actually am and go through some order forms,” Jody says, turning around to go back into the kitchen. “You okay by yourself until Balthazar gets here?”
Charlie latches onto Cas, dragging him away to sit next to her so that she can grill him. He shoots Dean an amused look as he allows himself to be manhandled and interrogated.
“Why?” he asks, before he realizes he sounds like an asshole.
Dean sighs, half-rolling his eyes. "Bout as over it as I can get."
Cas’ expression clears up then, like he’s figured out what Dean must’ve been thinking even if he doesn’t quite understand it.
Cas briefly glances up from where he’s staring down at his mug of coffee thoughtfully (‘communing with his coffee’ as Dean calls it) when Sam wanders back into the kitchen.
Feel free to come say hi to me on
“I’d like that.”
Dean’s about to call out to them when he hears the soft strains of Christmas music coming down the hall that leads to the kitchen. He follows it to the kitchen and finds Sam, Cas, Charlie, and Kevin seated around the dining table, decked out in their own Christmas sweaters, chatting and laughing as they dig into the fried chicken and mashed potatoes they’d braved the storm to get.
“Yes,” he answers immediately and then remembers himself. “Please.”
“It’s... possible I guess,” he concedes, rolling his eyes at the smug look on Dean’s face. He shakes his head with a huff. “We’ll need to find the rest of the files they kept of the storeroom items, see if anything matches the effects you’ve described. You can-”
Hesitantly, like he half-expects Dean to try something, he edges slowly over to the stove, ensnared by the smell of cheesy goodness wafting from it.
The click of a latch breaks Sam’s attention from his papers sometime later. He looks up in time to see Dean reaching for-
“Yup.”
“Nah,” Dean says hastily, briefly darting a significant look at Sam and hoping that
“Fine,” he says reluctantly, turning his back on Cas as he shoves the half-kneaded pie dough into the fridge. He needs to get changed before they head out, considering there’s blueberry paste dotting his jeans and shoes. “Go get your coat and meet me in the war room in ten minutes or I’m leaving without you.”
Catching him staring, Dean gives him a look. “Got something you wanna share with the class?”
They hobble down the hall, Cas bearing the brunt of Dean’s weight as he struggles to walk from the pain.
He makes his way to Cas on unsteady legs, not even looking at anything else except Cas’ face. If this is a dream, he’s holding onto the sight of that face till the very last second.
“Nah.” Charlie waves her hand. “Queen’s rules. Anyone I choose can be handmaiden.”
“I didn’t even say anything,” Sam objects, setting the eggs aside on the counter.
Dean’s busy texting Sam for updates on the survivor relocation efforts when there’s a sudden palpable shift to the room.
was strongly implied, his tone of voice insinuating that Sam wasn’t about to be privy to any more examples. Sam couldn’t recall being part of any awkwardly truthful conversations with Dean, so either he was having them with complete strangers or mostly just Cas.
Sam double-checks his watch as he heads in the direction of Dean’s room; it was getting close to dinner time and he’d rather know now instead of later if Dean was going to play a one-sided hide and seek game with Cas for the rest of the day.
Dean stares at him blankly.
He tries to sneak quietly into the kitchen, a plan that’s immediately nixed when the floorboards creak under his weight before he’s even set foot into the room.
blinks up at him.
Yeah, not so much.
The main door groans noisily indicating Sam’s return before Dean has a chance to answer. He casts a quick side glance towards the door before turning back to Cas with an apologetic expression. “How ‘bout a rain check on that?”
Sam takes a moment to admire the picture, pleased to realize that he can still recognize some of the more major gods on sight alone. He pauses when his eyes land on Bast. The stern expression on her catlike face niggles at a memory. The conversation with Cas earlier, still fresh in his mind, comes back with sudden sharpness and Sam has to slap a hand over his mouth to cut off the laugh that wants to escape. Cas had decided to get back to work after their walk, and humanity hasn’t dulled his hearing any; Sam’s never been bad at lying but there’s little use of hoping to get away with it right now.
to say anything, to even begin grasping all that Cas was dropping on him, but he should’ve said something, any of the thousand things he’s bit back over the years.
Dean sighs loudly. “I’m over it, alright?” Catching Castiel’s doubtful look, Dean crosses his arms and glares. “What d’you want me to say?”
He inclines his head towards the radio.
“Gabriel!” Castiel hisses indignantly.
Dean doesn’t respond.
“Um, hi. I’m guessing you’re Gabriel?”
“That’s not-” Dean cuts himself off. “Listen, you don’t want to have this conversation right now.”
“Not really,” Kevin agrees, “but it’d’ve been hilarious to watch.” He glances back at the kids.
“Sammy, lez’ play somethin’,” Dean says, trudging into the library.
The quiet lasts until Dean pulls up at the gas station near the edge of town. “Gotta refill Baby,” he mumbles, not looking at Cas. He doesn’t wait for a reply as he gets out and sets up to get the tank filled.
stuff her in the trunk of the Impala until he could find a good place to burn and bury the body. It’s not a terrible idea.
The Empty rolls its eyes and cuts Dean off. “I’m here for Castiel. Figured I’d hedge my bets, just in case.” At his confused expression, it snorts. “Oh that’s cute. You didn’t even tell him.”
“Right behind you, Sam,” Kevin says, hightailing it out of the room behind them. They don’t get very far before they burst into laughter.
Sam’s nowhere near as much of a flirt as Dean, but the answer for a question like this comes easy to him without needing to be forced out. “A lot of how people flirt is usually just complimenting the other person.”
“You just did,” Kevin says, just as he’s reached the door. Sam stops in front of the hall, fists clenched.
"Sammy?" the little kid inquires.
Cas tenses up at the question. He’s clearly nervous and uncomfortable, looking everywhere but at Dean himself. Of course, this would be the one conversation he has with the guy where they both want to run for the hills to avoid the topic.
“And who’d keep an eye on Crowley while we’re out celebrating? Unless you’re planning on inviting him to join us.”
Nice to see some things didn’t change with age.
Dean opens his mouth, ready to spout off the half-dozen times his loose tongue got ahead of him just last night, then pauses. Most of the stuff that comes to mind were things that happened with Cas and he feels like breaking out into hives at the thought of actually having to repeat even one of those to Sam.
“I don’t really have a good answer for that,” Sam admits. “I didn’t even know about it till Dean told me. I didn’t entirely believe him at first, and by the time we confirmed it we’d already been dragging it out.”
The bunker feels cavernously large and empty with no one around, so he turns on the old radio Dean had set up on one of the tables to banish the quiet of the library.
He forces himself to relax, if only so that he doesn’t tip her off to the fact that they’ve been clued into her master plan.
Things changed once Sam got better.
Crowley rolls his eyes towards the ceiling. Always impatient, these two. “I can confirm that two of the items
“You coming?”
“Not that I really need to explain anything to you, but let’s just say some people need to learn to grow up a bit. I was giving them a nudge in the right direction.”
Cas doesn't say anything, just pulls Dean up into a bone-crushing hug. He holds him close for a few seconds before pulling back.
“Nuh-uh,” Dean says, turning to look at Cas, who shakes his head.
Dean looks around, trying to think of something to do when his eyes land on a mud puddle nearby. “Wanna make mud pies?”
“Excuse me if I’d like to have something different once in a while,” Crowley replies drolly.
It takes a few moments, but then the door opens a crack, enough for Kevin to eye Dean narrowly. The light from the hall plays along his tired, mistrustful expression. “What about Crowley?”
From time to time Dean mentions a brother named Sammy, mostly to recall certain antics he’s gotten up to at college, but it’s clear in how he speaks about him that Dean is very fond of his brother.
“Cas, I didn’t- ”
“The body I’m in, the clothes I’m wearing,” Cas says, indicating his body, “they don’t belong to me. But at least these things – what you call junk – are
There’s a gnawing feeling of guilt growing in Dean’s gut. Cas is trying to salvage this somehow by
By the time they have Colorado in their rearview, the sun’s already setting.
“No, Cas, you gotta-” Dean moves to correct him for what must be the fourth or fifth time and ends up getting hit in the gut with the butt-end of the cue as Cas gears up to take a shot.
He can’t say this kind of thing will happen often – regardless of the outcome of whether they can undo the spell or not – but he wouldn't complain if it happened once in a while. It’s nice to be able to enjoy the simple things they fought and died to save.
Dean sighs, palms pressed against the counter as he considers Kevin.
“You sure you weren’t trying to find new ways to force-exorcize demons?”
“Holy sh- crap!” Kevin bites back a curse, backpedaling away. “My clothes aren't food! Shoo! Get lost!”
Dean’s proud of how well he’s taken care of her over the years for her to still purr as smoothly as she does when he takes her out on the road. But times like these, when there’s nothing really requiring him to be elbow deep in her guts beyond a perfunctory check to make sure everything’s as it’s supposed to be, he learns he can stand to be a little annoyed at himself for his efficiency.
Jack doesn’t respond. Still holding on tight to Jack’s shoulder, he searches the crowd more frantically. Just as he finally finds Sam, his brother notices him and the panicked expression on his face and starts making his way through the crowd.
