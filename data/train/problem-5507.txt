Determination flashed in Cas’s eyes and he grabbed Dean’s hand, pulling himself to his feet. “Let’s go again.”
“I hate you both,” he grumbled.
Cas felt Dean’s breathing pick up and he leaned back a bit, releasing his grip and watching Dean with concern. “Are you alright? Did I hurt you?”
Dean winked. “‘Course I will.”
He nodded and she ran back inside, and then he was alone with his thoughts again. With a lot more to think about. He couldn’t use Robin, hurting her, as an excuse anymore. She actually wanted him to go for it with Cas. That was one he didn’t see coming.
“I tried, but Balthazar answered the door.”
Dean noticed Cas seemed distracted. Or at least that he didn’t feel like talking. Dean understood that.
Dean reached out to help Castiel to his feet, not believing him for a second. “No way. You’re not climbing up there again after that fall. You need to rest up, Cas.”
“Well he doesn’t need to know that,” Balthazar told him. “We’re gonna go to the dance and you’re gonna have an outstanding time and Dean can go screw himself.”
Cas nodded slowly, taking in a deep breath and letting it out unsteadily. “You’re right,” he whispered. “I’m scared, Bal. What if he doesn’t love me back?”
Cas opened the bedroom door and startled when he found that the room wasn’t empty. Dean was there, lying on his bed and twirling his pocket knife around his fingers, staring at it.
Cas blinked, slightly relieved. He pushed himself up into a sitting position, immediately regretting the quick movement, and carefully swung his legs over so he was facing Dean. He leaned in closer to get a better look at the carvings. “Huh,” he said. “These are… really intense anti-demonic Latin symbols. Where did you learn these?”
“Dean?” Cas choked out. “What… what the hell was that? How did you…”
“We have to go,” Cas said again, whispering it to himself a few times after that. Okay, so maybe Cas was freaking out, Dean realized.
“I just… he…” Balthazar couldn’t form the words. It wasn’t like he was jealous, he just saw through Dean’s act. He didn’t want his best friend to get hurt. That’s all. “I just don’t want you to get hurt,” he repeated in a whisper, looking down at the ground.
“You can’t save anyone, Dean. You couldn’t even protect your own brother.”
He shoved that thought into the back of his mind. Not arousing, Novak. Definitely not arousing.
Dean startled a bit and looked up when Benny sat down beside him, clapping his shoulder roughly. “Hey man,” he said with a light laugh.
“Never in a million years,” Charlie said, giggling.
Sonny chose that moment to enter the living room, smiling when he saw Robin. “Hey there, Robin. Uh boys, have any of you seen Gordon?”
Dean couldn’t believe it. He had only stolen food for Sammy. He was trying to take care of his brother. It wasn’t his fault dad didn’t leave them enough food for a whole week. And he said he’d only be gone four days.
They sat in silence for a while, except for Benny nudging him and pointing at the cheerleaders when they started their routine. “If you don’t got a girlfriend or a boyfriend, then maybe what you need is a distraction.”
“I can take care of myself,” Cas said slowly. “What are you so worried about? Dean and I are just talking. We’re friends.”
“No,” Dean told him, bringing himself to his feet. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Still, she reminded herself, Dean was here, talking to her, flirting with her, smiling at her. And Cas was pushing him away, hell he was pushing her away too. Maybe they could find something in each other in all this mess.
“Cassie?”
“Bal,” Charlie cut in softly, putting her hand on his shoulder to keep him from lunging at Dean.
“Well howdy, newbie,” said one of the boys. He looked about seventeen and he had an awful mullet.
He sauntered into the living room with his best charming smile. “Hey,” he said, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “You know, I’ve always wanted to learn how to play guitar. Think you could teach me a few things?”
“Let me handle him,” Cas said. “Please. I can watch him, make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else. Please, promise me you’ll let me handle it.”
“No, not at all--”
Besides, Cas didn’t know the first thing about being in love. The whole idea was terrifying, especially with Dean. And Charlie was right, it wasn’t because of his dad or religion or guilt or anything like that. Cas had never felt like this about anyone before, and something about Dean made him feel like he could lose him at any second. And if he could lose him, then it was far too risky to love him. It didn’t even matter if Dean had any kind of feelings for him, it was just too big a risk. Cas wasn’t ready to take that on.
“Don’t you talk smart with me, Castiel!” Zachariah snapped, his voice only raising for the first and last word he spoke. That was more terrifying than yelling to Cas. “You know damn well what I mean. Giving you ideas of individuality and that other nonsense people are spouting these days.”
“You comin’ in?” he asked with a boyish smile.
“So that’s why you feel like you’ve gotta protect him,” Cas said softly, understanding even though he didn’t even know the half of it. Dean looked back at him, and he couldn’t say a word. He simply nodded, swallowed hard, watched as Cas looked at him. Dean didn’t recognize that look. He couldn’t quite place it.
Thinking back to the carnival, Dean felt sick. Maybe Cas was more afraid of him than he’d let on after what had happened. Dean had tried to make things go back to normal but maybe that was wishful thinking. Cas had seen the darkness in him and it was too much.
Cas shook out of his daze and looked at Charlie like a deer in headlights. “Uh, nothing. Not looking at anything.”
She let out a shaky sob and pulled her pants up, grabbing her jacket and heading towards the door.
...right into the other deputy.
“My dad is an obsessed bastard,” Dean said gruffly, shaking his head. “Not a lot of people like him. A lot more people wanna beat his head in.”
“Uh huh?”
“Oh, yeah,” Sonny said with a low chuckle. “I remember that age. Too cool for school, right?”
Cas went to school smiling the next day, something he didn’t usually do. He was talking to Dean and Dean was talking to him, and he couldn’t help but kick himself for wasting so much effort pushing Dean away. It was good, and Cas was happy.
They both went quiet for a bit, not really sure where to go from there. After a while, Dean couldn’t take the silence anymore. He sat up with a grunt and smiled at Cas. “Alright, enough of this depressing crap. Wanna play some cards?”
Cas startled, flinching away and looking up at Dean with an expression that Dean couldn’t place. He could only assume it was fear, and his heart sunk. He backed away. “I… I’m sorry.” Dean turned and rushed out of the gymnasium, busying himself at the drinking fountain.
Dean nodded, taking a breath to calm down but still glaring at Gordon.
“Oh! Hey, Castiel,” the girl said, blushing.
(The only thing that would make it more perfect was if Sammy could also have this normal, happy life, but Dean didn’t want to think about that right now. He was enjoying being a little selfish.)
“Not exactly,” Dean said. “Not because of my dad. It’s just… I was supposed to look after him. I was supposed to be there to protect him no matter what. And I failed. I couldn’t even get food for him. Dad was right to be disappointed, honestly.”
Deep down, he knew it was a foolish hope, going home. His father would never allow it. But he just kept hoping that if he tried hard enough, that part of him would go away and his father would love him again. Like he loved Michael, and like he loved Anna.
Benny’s face paled and Dean smirked. “I-I, no, I just meant--”
Robin’s eyes widened a bit in surprise. “Never?”
“Cas,” Balthazar urged gently. “I don’t know what you’re saying. Start from the beginning.”
“Hey stop that kid!”
He was cut off when he heard yelling outside and he instinctively jumped up. He followed when Sonny and the other boys ran outside to see what was wrong.
Dean choked on a breath and shook his head. Coming back to reality, he prayed his… excitement wasn’t too visible through his shorts.
Dean also got all flustered around him. Cas couldn’t figure out why, but he did notice that he acted differently when others were around. He flirted with Robin like it was as easy as breathing, and he joked around with Benny, Chuck, and Ash like they’d been childhood buds. But for some reason, when he was talking to Cas, Dean’s smooth and careful demeanor seemed to slip away.
“Aw, don’t you love me too?” Balthazar whined.
Dean frowned, confused. “You… you don’t? But you… You ran away after…”
Dean watched Cas for a moment after he closed his eyes, then stood and headed downstairs for dinner. He knew it was stupid to get attached, but… he couldn’t seem to help it. Cas had some sort of effect on him and he’d never experienced anything like it before. Sure, he was attractive and nice and funny and smart, but Dean didn’t get it. His first instinct had always been to close off, build up walls, lie, stay safe. But with Cas he struggled to do that. He wanted to tell him all sorts of stuff about his life and why he was really here, but he knew he couldn’t. He could never tell anyone.
Pushing thoughts of his dad away, Dean found his way to his last class. He was late because the office screwed up his schedule somehow, and this was the only class with an opening. “Sorry I’m late…” Dean trailed off, noticing Cas sitting in the back of the room. He gulped and looked at the teacher. “Last minute schedule change,” he finished.
“Mr. Winchester,” the teacher said, annoyed, pausing in his lecturing. “Please, stop daydreaming and start taking notes. This will be on the test.”
He was really trying. He was going to school, doing his homework, flirting with a pretty girl who he was pretty sure was flirting back. How much more normal could he get? Then again, Dean didn’t really know the first thing about normal. His only idea of normal was vengeful spirits and werewolves and crappy motel rooms.
“So you like picking on people, huh?” he growled. “Maybe you should try picking on me, see how that works out for ya. Come on, do it,” he shoved Gordon again. “Do it! Unless you’re scared,” he challenged, eyeing Gordon fiercely.
Cas did his best to follow Dean’s lead and match his breathing. After a few minutes, he had calmed down just a little.
He heard Gordon shout, panicked and fearful, and Dean ran faster to catch up to them. He followed a trail of drops of blood to the bathrooms, approaching cautiously as he heard Gordon’s voice echoing scared and shaking. He was going for the element of surprise. And it would’ve worked if Gordon didn’t look right at him as soon as he rounded the corner. So much for that.
Cas almost puked. Seeing red, he shoved through the door.
The thought of it was too much.
Anger bubbling up at the thought, Gordon picked up the pace and grabbed the boy by the shoulder, shoving him roughly to the ground and kicking him in the side. Again, then again.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Well, first of all, it’s Robin and you know she still has a thing for you. And second of all, I didn’t see him flirting with anyone but you during class today.”
“Believe what you want, but I can see it,” Charlie cut him off. “He likes you. He probably doesn’t even realize it yet but he does. And you like him.”
Dean actually won a medal at the meet. He hadn’t even realized it was a big deal kind of event but he won all but one match and apparently it was some sort of tournament. Dean actually allowed himself a moment to feel proud of his achievement. He wondered if his dad would be proud of him.
Charlie smiled at him. Her smile faltered a bit when she noticed Balthazar’s demeanor. She could tell he was uncomfortable with the topic, but she had to be happy for Cas. Ugh, she hated secrets.
“He doesn’t seem to be pushing those two away,” Dean said, gesturing in the general direction of the cafeteria. Robin knew who he meant.
Cas watched him go, sitting there in confusion. That was… weird. Dean hadn’t spoken to him all week, and now, he tried to make small talk only to disappear immediately after. Just when Cas thought he had figured out the mystery of Dean Winchester, the boy threw him another curve ball.
They had also agreed that kissing was awkward and not really something they should do with each other anymore. Dean was relieved as soon as Robin admitted that it felt forced to her, too.
“What?” Dean flinched away, startled, and Cas reached up to touch his face. His throat was ripped out, he should be dead, but he was talking to Dean.
“Cassie!”
So he decided to keep trying for normal, and he actually found himself enjoying hanging out with the boys from Sonny’s. He’d never really had any real friends before, at least not outside of the hunting world. Sure he loved Bobby and some of the others like family, but no one ever talked about anything normal. Sure Dean loved hunting with his dad, but maybe he only thought that because he’d never seen what anything normal looked like. Maybe… maybe his dad was wrong to keep him from that.
“Physics teacher gave us a pop quiz,” Charlie groaned, grabbing a water and two cream sodas from the fridge. “On the first day!”
Cas didn’t say anything for a while. He wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to agree to that. Just because he never knew how to respond, didn’t mean he didn’t like the way he felt when Dean flirted with him, even accidentally. Still… if Dean didn’t want that, then Cas would respect it. If it meant they could still be friends, he could be okay with that.
Cas was gonna get what he deserved. Everyone would finally see him for what he was… a coward.
“Um, sure,” he said eloquently. “How ‘bout tomorrow? I’m pretty beat.”
The cashier gave him an odd look and Dean swallowed thickly but kept walking. He saw the cashier wave over the cop standing by the door and his stomach dropped. How had he not seen him there before?
“It looks that way, yes,” Cas nodded.
Sonny ran through the open field, stopping to kneel next to Cas. “Hey, buddy, you all right? What happened?” The man didn’t believe Gordon’s concern for a second, nor did anyone else. They all knew him better than that. But Sonny was more focused on making sure Cas was okay than punishing Gordon.
Cas nodded and they climbed out of the truck, going to help Sonny unload the kayaks. There were two, and Benny called dibs on the first one before anyone could even think about it. While Ash and Chuck were fighting for the second seat, Dean laughed and looked at Cas, nodding towards the other kayak.
“I like it,” Dean said honestly. He looked around at the pure white decorations, the fake staircase which served as the photoshoot backdrop, and the banner reading ‘Stairway to Heaven’ that hung above the stage. “Do you have a minute?” he asked after a moment of hesitation. She gave him a worried look but nodded, following him outside.
“Told ya, today’s a new day,” Dean said with a grin, letting him up. “That’s two-zero me.”
“God, get a room,” Balthazar mumbled, and Charlie kicked him under the table. “Ow!”
Cas wanted to scream that no, no that wasn’t it, not at all. He wanted to grab Dean’s hand and tell him everything, the reason why he couldn’t make himself talk to Dean like a normal human being. The reason why he had to push him away. He wished he could… but instead he just sighed softly and laid down on his side with his back to Dean. He figured this was easier. Not exactly a clean break, but as close as he could manage.
Dammit.
Cas smiled and took his hand, and they continued towards Sonny’s. As they walked, Cas couldn’t help himself. “Why tonight? I mean, why… I thought you were into Robin, not me. What made you stay away for so long?”
Cas’s eyes widened a bit and he cleared his throat. “Pardon?”
“Yeah, well, you’re gay,” Balthazar shot back, and Charlie punched his shoulder.
Dean huffed out a sigh and laid down on his back. “Don’t apologize,” he said. “Don’t pretend we’re friends, either. I can take a hint.”
Dean sighed, looking away. “Fine. I get it. I’ll ask for a different lab partner.”
Cas smiled, a bit disappointed. “Okay,” he said softly. “Goodnight, Dean.”
“Alright, I guess,” he said, sniffling. “But only if you wear a tux” he added with a tiny smile.
Cas barely listened to his response as he pulled The Princess Bride from the cabinet and held it up with a grin. Charlie and Balthazar groaned and he laughed. “What? You guys love this movie.”
I’ll always protect you, Cas, he thought, closing his eyes and hiding his face so Cas couldn’t see the tears threatening to fall.
“No, that’s alright,” Cas said lightly. “I can handle myself.”
Dean actually felt his heart skip when Cas’s lips touched his, gentle at first and then more insistent, curious. Dean’s hand moved to Cas’s hair and he let out a soft, surprised noise when Cas grazed his tongue over Dean’s bottom lip.
Balthazar let out a soft, choked laugh. “I’m just making shit up as I go, Cassie,” he said, shaking his head as tears spilled from his eyes. “I don’t have a goddamn clue.” Pausing, he looked at Cas and he knew he had to say something, even if he didn’t know what. “But Cas…” he began, taking a shaky breath. “If you really love Dean… Maybe you should tell him. He might surprise you. And you can’t let it eat you up inside.”
Cas groaned. “I… I mean he did. He definitely did. I… I’ve never had a kiss like that. But…”
Quickly shaking that train of thought, Balthazar smiled fondly at Cas. He couldn’t help the swell of hope in his chest at Cas’s excitement for movie night. Yeah, Charlie was there too, but movie night had been a thing for Cas and Balthazar since they were kids. It usually ended with the two of them sitting way too close on the couch until Cas was basically curled up in Balthazar’s lap. He knew Cas just liked being comfortable, but to Balthazar it was so much more than that.
They both laughed softly, relieved to have the tension broken.
Cas was walking home from Charlie’s house after they finished studying for the day, and he couldn’t stop thinking about his father. Despite himself, he actually missed him. He missed having a family.
Dean shifted in his seat, pulling his jacket down and attempting to hide the evidence of his train of thought. He couldn’t help himself, though, he kept sneaking glances at Cas. Even when Cas wasn’t looking at him, he could see the slight drawing together of his eyebrows as he concentrated, and the tiny frown on his face as he subtly mouthed the words he was writing. He was wearing a dark blue shirt that brought out his eyes, topped with a black hoodie, and his hair was sticking out in every which way.
Cas shrugged. “Not exactly. That was a nail in the coffin but not really what sealed the deal. I told you that Gordon was part of the reason I ended up at Sonny’s.” He paused, studying Dean’s expression. It was a mix of outrage and intrigue, he thought. “There was a party, and Gordon was being his usual self, and I kinda lost it on him… and one of his friends.”
He did as Cas said, lying on the grass face down. He felt Cas come up behind him, grab his arm and pull it around so he had Cas in a headlock and Dean was propped up on his side. Cas slid his arm underneath Dean and around his waist, and Dean felt warmth spread from the touch. He cleared his throat and tried to focus. He was trying to get things back to normal. He couldn’t get distracted, even if Cas was warm and solid and strong behind him...
He was immediately met with the pungent mixture of pizza, sweat, and--dammit--alcohol.
She smiled, satisfied. “I know. And you know I have to give you shit.”
“Dean!”
“I…” Dean hesitated. He knew he’d fucked up, but he couldn’t figure out exactly what Balthazar was referring to. He shook his head and met Balthazar’s eyes seriously. “Please, I need him to know that I--”
Cas smiled, genuinely smiled, when he saw his friends walking towards Sonny’s porch.
“I…” Cas exhaled shakily, staring into Dean’s eyes. He didn’t know what he was waiting for. Maybe Dean would be okay with a chick flick moment just this once…
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said politely. He wasn’t one to be completely rude. Not when Dean was speaking directly to him. Still, that didn’t mean he had to keep up a conversation. If they talked Cas was worried his feelings would spiral out of control and he couldn’t risk that.
“If that makes you feel better.”
Dean soaked that in. Everyone kept saying that Cas looked at him like… well, he didn’t know what. He wished he could see whatever it was that everyone else saw on Cas’s face. If it was anything like the way Dean thought he looked at Cas, then it really must have been something.
“Awww,” Charlie cooed, punching his shoulder lightly. “I knew he liked you.”
Dean flipped over so he was on his back, and he gasped when he realized how close Cas’s face was. “I, uh…”
A familiarly loud engine rumbled from about a block away, back at Sonny’s, and Dean’s heart sank as his words trailed off. All thoughts of telling Cas that he… well, telling him how he felt, flew out the window. His dad was back, and Sammy…
“I…” The word got caught in Cas’s throat. Of course he’d noticed. But Dean wouldn’t… well, Cas realized, he didn’t really know what Dean would or wouldn’t do. He didn’t actually know him. But the way he talked to Cas, it sure didn’t seem like he was playing him.
Without a word, Dean led Cas out of the fun house. He silently noted that he was totally right and that fun houses are never a good idea, but it wasn’t the time.
They went silent for a few moments except to thank the waitress when she brought them their coffee and apple pie. Dean was so relieved to finally be talking to Cas. He wasn’t really sure why, but Cas made him want to open up about every dark and evil bit of his past. He made him want to tell him all of it and then leave it all behind to start fresh. He made Dean wish he never had to go back. Maybe I don’t, he thought hopefully.
“I could kill you for what you did to Anna,” Balthazar growled, getting in Gordon’s face.
Cas shrugged. “It’s not my fault the cast is full of people who look good in spandex.”
She sighed and turned to the boy with a polite smile. “You must be the new kid Cas mentioned. I’m Robin,” she told him, shrugging the guitar off her shoulders and sitting on the couch.
Meanwhile, Robin continued to watch from the porch as the boys started heading back inside. She couldn’t help but admire the way Dean stood up for Castiel like that. And how he was being so kind to the boy. Honestly, it was extremely attractive. And Dean wasn’t exactly hard on the eyes either, so that helped.
Cas never stopped smiling as he walked. He couldn’t believe he’d wasted his time ignoring Dean when he could’ve been enjoying his friendship. Dean had such a nice smile, and an even nicer laugh. His eyes lit up and for a moment he didn’t look so… weighed down. Cas could tell he carried some sort of weight on his shoulders, but he couldn’t quite figure out what it was. But when he was around Cas, that weight seemed to disappear, or at least lighten a bit. It made Cas feel warm and giddy that he could chase Dean’s demons away, even if just for a while.
He didn’t notice Cas watching him. He didn’t see the hurt in his eyes or the hope… or the love. And he didn’t know that Cas was still awake long after everyone else had fallen asleep, just watching Dean. Wishing. Hoping. He had no idea that all Cas wanted to do was go to him and hold him close and never let him go.
“After the way that son of a bitch choked you out last season, it’s a miracle he wasn’t expelled,” Balthazar chimed in, shifting uncomfortably. He was trying not to let his temper flare again. Thankfully Gordon wasn’t in the lunch room today, he noticed as they found a table and sat down.
Robin gently touched his knee, watching the boy carefully. “Castiel, you could always take him in a fight. You did before.”
“Dean--”
All thoughts of being selfish and staying -- because fuck did he want to stay -- left his mind when he thought of his brother. Sam needed him, and it was Dean’s responsibility to take care of him. Nothing that Dean wanted was as important as that.
“Looks like you might have some competition here, Cas,” said the coach as he approached them. “Winchester, right?”
“I might’ve heard that somewhere,” Dean nodded, looking away and huffing out half of a laugh. “So what made you change your mind about me?”
Dean laughed. “I could warm you up if you want,” he said flirtatiously, without really thinking about it.
Dean looked up at the man and nodded. “Yes, sir. Dean Winchester.”
Cas’s eyes widened and he stumbled over his words for a moment, staring at Dean. That’s when Dean realized what he’d said.
“That chem teacher is kind of a hardass,” Dean chimed in, and Ash groaned.
“But he’s been through a lot,” she told him. “Sometimes he forgets that not everyone sees the worst in him and he pushes people away. He forgets that we’re not all judgmental jerks.”
Cas laughed too, then winced when he felt a sharp pain in his ribs. He made a pained noise and groaned, “I think I’m going to be dark and mysterious in my bed, if you don’t mind.” Cas protested but ultimately gave in when Dean rushed to help him stand and walk down the hall. “Uh, thanks,” he said. “For everything. And don’t worry about Gordon. He’s got me as a target and won’t let me go, which is good. It means he spends less time hurting anyone else. I can handle him.”
The words echoed through Dean’s mind as he walked through the little convenience store, taking long deep breaths and trying to act normal. He saw the shelf with cans of ravioli and smiled a little. Sammy loved the mini ravioli. Almost as much as he loved mac and cheese.
“Nothing,” Balthazar told him, slipping into a cool smile. “Happy for you, Cassie.”
Dean didn’t even have a chance to speak before Chuck was dashing out of the room again. Strange kid, he thought.
He looked at Robin, suddenly wondering if he shouldn’t be saying this to her. But she didn’t look hurt or upset. She was actually smiling. Dean swallowed thickly and continued.
Dean took a steadying breath and shook his head. It was now or never, he thought. “No. It’s not.” Cas’s face was confused so Dean continued. “Can we go outside where it’s a little more… private?”
“It was me, sir,” Cas said, and Dean coughed. “I, uh… I went out to get some fresh air. He followed me. I thought he was going to hurt me.”
“Oh, remember how crazy she went last year?” Robin laughed. “She painted her whole face bright blue. You and Balthazar ended up in the school newspaper just for sitting next to her.”
He couldn’t read what that expression even was, but it wasn’t good. He knew that for sure when Cas practically flinched away from him, scrambling to his feet and backing away.
“Cassie, what happened?” Balthazar asked again, rubbing his back. He felt a strong sense of protectiveness set in and he shifted closer to Cas. “Just breathe. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“I dunno,” he told Cas, shrugging. “I guess I just like you more than the rest of these idiots,” he added with a smirk, nodding his head towards Chuck.
Cas smiled a bit. “Are you sure? It’s the sixth branch up.”
Balthazar inched closer until their knees touched. His heart was pounding in his chest. “Just, um… here, put your hand on my shoulder or something and, uh…” Balthazar trailed off, looking at Cas. His heart caught in his throat at the way Cas was staring at him with wide, innocent eyes. “Like this…” Balthazar closed his eyes and leaned in, touching his lips to Cas’s ever so lightly. He slotted his bottom lip between Castiel’s slightly parted lips and just… stayed there. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.
Dean’s temper flared. He’d had enough of this. Cas could ignore him and freeze him out and refuse to talk at Sonny’s but lying to Dean’s face? Hell no.
Dean shrugged, a half smile tugging at his lips. “Ah, Cassie, I can’t tell you all my secrets. What’s the fun in that?”
Dean followed Cas up the stairs, and he definitely didn’t notice the way his ass looked in those jeans, goddamn--
“Go to your room, Castiel, I have work to do.”
He looked out the window and saw Cas struggling to climb up to the ledge. “Cas? What the hell are you doing?”
“Cas has been through a lot,” Benny told him quietly, and Dean didn’t think he’d seen Benny’s expression so serious in the two weeks he’d been there.
“Cas!”
When the team went out for burgers afterwards, Cas chose not to join them. Robin and Dean were still standing way too close and Cas could only take so much. So after the bus took the team back to the school, Cas walked back to Sonny’s by himself. Once again, he felt stupid for allowing himself even a moment to hope that Dean would choose him.
He had thought their last class of every day was going to be their time together. Walk to class together, share inside jokes in knowing glances across the room, walk home together after the bell rang. But Dean had to barge in and ruin the whole deal.
“Dean,” Sonny said pointedly. “You really think I haven’t noticed something’s going on between you two? I may be getting old but I haven’t lost all my marbles yet.”
“Don’t call me son,” Dean spat. “My dad’s coming back. He’s just pissed off, he’ll be back.” Dean wasn’t even sure he believed it, especially with that sad look the sheriff was giving him. He hated pity.
“What’s that, Cassie?”
“And what good would that do?”
“You’ll never take me alive!” Ash cried out, voice cracking at the end.
Cas shared his last class before lunch with Charlie, a fact that he was beyond grateful for. If it wasn’t for her, he would spend a lot more time completely lost, especially since their computer tech teacher was 60 years old and could barely turn her computer on. But Charlie was a natural. She was so good that, in 8th grade, she was nearly expelled when she wrote her final paper on how it was actually super easy to hack into the school records system. Of course, she had to provide a demonstration to prove her point.
“I can kick his face in.”
Then again, his dad wasn’t around anymore. He left. So what did it matter if Dean told someone? What did it matter what his dad thought of it? It didn’t matter, Dean decided. And what the hell, if he was gonna have an apple pie life, that involved caring about people right? Getting attached, making friends, finding someone who would understand and wouldn’t leave him when they found out the truth. He wanted it. He wanted it more than he could even admit to himself.
Robin giggled and Dean looked at her with a smile. He watched the way she tucked her hair behind her ears. It was kind of adorable.
“Told you,” Cas said, grinning at Dean as they both erupted in uncontrollable laughter.
“Dean!”
“Dean, help me!”
“Cas!”
“Shut up,” Dean muttered as he tried to calm his breathing. “Just, um… distract me or something.”
The thought of wearing Cas’s clothes, his swim shorts no less, had Dean speechless for a solid minute. It felt… Well, Dean didn’t really know what it felt like. He did know that it sent his stomach twisting up into knots; whether that was good or bad, he didn’t know.
“I’m sure he will, but you can’t stay here in any case,” said the sheriff. “For now, we’ve got a nice boys home ‘round here where you can stay. A warm bed’s better than a jail cell.”
“Who’s that?” Charlie asked, nudging him knowingly.
He knew he was lying to himself for even thinking that was a possibility.
Dean stumbled a bit as she shoved him, but once he was moving he couldn’t stop his feet from taking him to Cas. Swallowing nervously, Dean walked up to Cas and cleared his throat softly.
“Ahem,” Charlie uttered pointedly. “Let’s get our tickets before the lines get too long!”
The man lunged at him and Dean couldn’t move out of the way fast enough. He was knocked to the ground, and he struggled against the man for almost a minute before the knife sunk into the old man’s gut. He went limp above Dean and Dean pushed the man off of him, laying there in shock for he didn’t know how long.
That got everyone’s attention.
“No,” Cas blurted out before he could stop himself, looking at Dean with wide eyes. Shit. “I mean…” Dean frowned at him, confused.
“Aye aye, captain!” Dean exclaimed, laughing like he was a little boy again.
The game was nearly over by the time Dean had cleaned up the blood and disposed of the body, and Dean was exhausted. He decided to head back to Sonny’s and call it a night.
“What happened?” John asked, looking over at Dean, disappointment in his eyes. Dean swallowed hard, but he couldn’t speak. He deserved that look. He’d been caught. That was one of the number one rules. Be smart, don’t get caught.
Balthazar hated the crushed look on Cas’s face. “Hey,” he said softly, moving to sit by Cas on the couch. He grabbed his shoulder and squeezed lightly. “At least he’s trying.”
Even if, and that was if, Anna was okay, they would still get in so much trouble with their father for this.
“What does your dad do?” Cas asked, leaning in a bit closer to Dean, intrigued.
“I did say that,” Dean said, smiling and grabbing his deck of cards from the nightstand drawer. He sat cross-legged at the head of his bed and gestured for Cas to sit in the empty space across from him, to which Cas obliged. “Really it just comes down to practice. And learning how to read people.”
He startled and looked back at Charlie. He didn’t even realize they had stopped walking. He was leaning against a wall for support and his breathing was shaky.
Dean huffed out a bitter, dark laugh. Gordon had a point. He pushed away from him and glared at the boy. “Good. You try running your mouth and I swear to god you’ll regret it.”
Dean frowned. The other boys shrugged and said they hadn’t seen him, and Sonny sighed and walked out the front door.
Dean watched Cas and he couldn’t help but grin. Of all the animals that he could’ve chosen on the merry-go-round, of all the ones that actually belonged on a merry-go-round as far as Dean was concerned, Cas picked a bumble bee. It was way too adorable.
Dean shook his head, pulling his focus back to Robin. Cas didn’t want him around. Robin did. It was that simple.
Gordon smiled smugly and hopped down from the tree, landing inches from Castiel’s head. Cas glared up at him. “Nice catch, bird boy,” Gordon sneered, then turned and shifed his expression into one of panic. “Hey!” he shouted. “Someone help! Cas is hurt!”
Charlie shrugged. “He’s just a flirt. But he’s different with you, I can tell.”
“So Dean, you might be carrying our asses to the tournament this year,” one of the boys said, and some others piped up in agreement.
“It wasn’t pity,” Cas told Dean, holding open the door for him as they entered the diner. “I just got tired of lying to myself.”
Nodding, Dean followed Sonny outside and hopped in the truck.
Still, Dean couldn’t get him out of his head. He couldn’t forget the way Cas’s hands had touched him oh, so gently as they kissed. He couldn’t forget the heated, dazed look in Cas’s eyes when he pulled away, or how it was almost instantly replaced with panic. And he most definitely couldn’t forget the Cas’s body had felt against his own…
Balthazar laughed. “Yes, that’s generally how the game is played.” He couldn’t help but grin at how adorable Cas was. “Well go on now.”
“Just a dizzy spell,” Charlie spoke up, smiling tightly.
Balthazar used two fingers to tilt Cas’s chin up and met his eyes. “You’re not stupid,” he said fiercely. “He is. He’s an idiot not to see what he’s got.” Cas didn’t say anything, so Balthazar sighed and continued. “Who needs that bullshit, anyways? Hell, I’ll take you to the dance, and you can show Dean that you could give a damn.”
As they drove away, Dean could only think of Sam, and how he had failed him.
Balthazar wanted to be happy for Cas, really, but he didn’t understand how Cas couldn’t see Dean for the two-timing player he was. He saw the way he flirted with Robin in first period, only to turn it around and flirt with Cas all through last. It was disgusting. It wasn’t right. He was only going to break Cassie’s heart, and who would be there to pick up the pieces? Balthazar would. He always was.
Dean huffed out a surprised laugh. “You have no idea.” He turned and strapped the oar to the back of the kayak, then leaned back against the side of the plastic vessel. “I never got to do anything like this as a kid,” he admitted.
They parted ways and Dean noticed Cas leaving the cafeteria, holding hands with Balthazar. His stomach turned and he felt sick. He had noticed before that Balthazar’s feelings for Cas were maybe a little more than platonic, but he didn’t think that Cas…
“Listen son, I know--”
Cas sang to Dean until his voice was barely even a whisper and Dean was asleep in his arms. He didn’t dare move and wake him. He was grateful that the other boys were sound sleepers.
Cas choked out a laugh. “Are you serious? He doesn’t like me, he likes Robin.”
“Aha, take that!” Ash exclaimed triumphantly.
“Ready to watch some babes in tiny skirts do cartwheels?” Benny asked with a wide grin, which quickly turned to amusement. “Oh right, I forgot, Winchester’s got a girlfriend now.”
Dean obliged, because Cas seemed to calm down as he focused his energy on taking care of Dean. Cas grabbed the first aid kit and grabbed what he needed. The cut wasn’t too deep, so he wouldn’t need stitches, but he did need to stop the bleeding.
Cas ignored him and swam out to where Dean was treading water. Benny waved them off and helped Ash get their kayak flipped over.
Balthazar rolled his eyes. “Cas has been doing trig for like three years. He won’t let you fail.”
“I actually thought…” Cas looked down at his hands in his lap. “I thought the kiss meant that he loved me too. I was stupid…”
“That motherfucker,” Balthazar growled. “This is his fault. And Anna… that son of a bitch hurt Anna.”
Cas was kicking himself. He couldn’t make up his damn mind. He knew he needed to push Dean away, but every time Dean obliged and let him be, he couldn’t seem to let him go. What the hell was wrong with him?
Though he still didn’t know why that was, he did know one thing: he was in trouble. He was in a deep, sparkling blue ocean of trouble that, really, far too closely resembled the color of Cas’s eyes. And Dean could only keep himself afloat for so long.
“Well, that’s why I stayed,” Dean told him quietly. “Because… Because I wanted to.”
Dean looked at Cas, then back at Sonny, opening his mouth--
“No,” Cas stopped him, choking on a sob. “Dean. I love Dean.”
He faltered, however, when he saw Cas was walking towards Balthazar and Charlie. He wasn’t stupid. He could tell Balthazar was protective and he could tell he didn’t like Dean. “Cas, maybe I should--”
Cas looked like he was going to say something but he just nodded silently. He looked back at Balthazar and Charlie and smiled a bit. It’s okay, he told them without words. Balthazar relaxed a bit, but he wasn’t happy about it.
Cas’s face flushed and he laughed. “You’re incorrigible,” he scoffed. “But fine. I’ll go. If only because I love the popcorn they sell at the concessions booth.”
Neither of them could move for a while, as if they were afraid if they did it would all be over. Dean almost believed Cas would vanish as soon as he let him out of his sight.
“Yeah, I know,” Cas laughed. “That’s why you’re my best friend.”
Sonny stepped in the middle of them before Gordon could throw a fist. “Hey, knock it off, both of you. Gordon, get in the house, now! Dean, help me get Cas inside.”
Dean swallowed thickly, running his fingers through his hair. “What if he doesn’t wanna talk to me? I’m pretty sure he hates me by now.”
“I want to…” Cas admitted, not meeting her eyes. “Last night, he… I had a nightmare and… He hugged me and sang to me until I fell asleep.”
Cas smiled at him, though he was both thrilled and panicked when he realized that Dean’s bed was right next to his. It was obvious he had formed some kind of attraction to Dean, and it needed to be quelled. But… Cas swallowed.
“Sammy?”
“I have an extra,” Cas blurted out before he could stop himself. “You, uh… You can borrow it. If you want.” Cas tried really hard not to think about Dean wearing his clothes. It made his stomach all fluttery and warm in a way he wasn’t used to.
“Dean!” Cas gasped, and the knife fell from Dean’s shaking hand.
“That’s great, Cassie,” Charlie said, snapping Balthazar out of his thoughts.
“You’ve got some fucking nerve--”
“Gabe?” he choked out, slowly standing up and then practically running across the room to grab the older boy in a tight hug. Gabriel chuckled softly and wrapped his arms around his brother.
“Ready to go?” Dean asked.
“Have you seen my sister, Anna?” Cas asked.
“I didn’t really take you for a contortionist,” Dean said softly, glancing at him with a nervous smile. Ash and Chuck were too busy fighting for personal space to notice them.
Dean looked up at him, shocked. “But I thought--”
He tried not to get too distracted by Dean in his uniform. And he thought gym shorts were bad. That was nothing compared to how incredibly revealing those unitards were.
Well, that was safe enough, Dean figured. Nothing nasty could possibly be hiding on a ferris wheel.
Maybe Dean wasn’t like the others. Maybe he didn’t think he was a monster. Maybe…
“He didn’t buy anything… yeah, he was just wandering around…”
“He mentioned Saturday,” Dean added, swallowing and meeting Cas’s eyes. Then it occurred to him. “Damn, I don’t have a swimsuit,” he said. “The lake is a lot less fun if I’m stuck on the beach the whole time…”
“Uh, yes sir. I’d like that.”
Dean watched Cas and his friends from the back of the room, trying to quell the jealousy he felt. He couldn’t deny that it hurt that Cas still wouldn’t talk to him. And seeing him so happy and open with his friends made Dean long to have that with Cas.
Cas didn’t move or say a word, just stared at Dean. Dean couldn’t tell if the fear in his eyes was just fear of what was happening or if it was fear of Dean. He hoped it wasn’t the latter, though he wouldn’t blame him.
“Thank you,” Cas mumbled. “Dean, I want to say sorry. I’ve been a jerk.”
“Oh my god, Cas! Robin told me what happened, are you okay? Do you need me to destroy someone?”
Dean was sitting up against his headboard, twirling his knife between his fingers, when he heard something outside. He pocketed his knife and padded over to the window to see Cas and Balthazar standing on the grass.
He was still lost in thought by the time he got to his first class. The teacher was the only one in the room but she didn’t mind Cas taking his seat early. He used to do it all the time when he didn’t want to be at home. He’d known Miss Larsen since he had her for math in 8th grade, and she was one of the few people who knew about his situation at home.
If Dean kept touching him all the time like he just had, Cas was going to lose his fucking mind.
Dean refused to expose Cas to his life, to the darkness. No matter how badly he wished he could tell him everything and no matter how much he hoped Cas would pull him close and tell him he loved him anyway.
“Bunch of idiots,” Dean said, earning a shy laugh from her. “Any guy’d be lucky to have you on his arm.”
“Sure,” Dean said, then cleared his throat when it came out a little too enthusiastic. “I mean, yeah… I, uh… Sure.” Wow. Very smooth. Doing his best to school his features, he smirked at Cas. “If you’re gonna learn, might as well learn from the best.”
Cas shrugged. “It was only the first day.”
Cas quirked his eyebrow. “I didn’t know you could think.”
The vampire let out a shriek and jumped at him, and Dean side-stepped. He used her momentum to shove her towards the stalls, opening the door and then slamming it shut with expert timing. The head rolled out from the stall and Dean made a face, breathing heavily. “Don’t lose your head or anything,” he muttered, smiling to himself.
Robin sighed sullenly, watching him go. She only took a moment to feel sorry for herself, though, quickly schooling her features and stepping through the front door. “Knock knock!” she announced cheerfully.
Dean slapped on his trademark cocky grin, straightening his collar and standing up. “Watch and learn, boys.”
One girl shrugged and shook her head. “Nope.”
“Hey!” Dean laughed, and Robin followed suit.
The vamp made a sound that resembled a laugh and Dean glared. “You won’t be laughing in a minute, you blood-sucking bitch.”
The fun house wasn’t very busy, so it was just Dean and Cas going through. Animatronics and sound effects meant to make them jump were scattered around the place, and Dean barely even flinched. He noticed with some amusement and fond admiration that Cas startled every single time, clutching his stuffed bee tightly. He also noticed, of course he did, that Cas was gripping his hand and refusing to let go the entire time.
“Mm, thank you, Dean,” Cas said. “Hey, Dean?”
Dean’s eyes widened. He thought one brother was a lot to handle. “Damn. How was that growing up?” Suddenly, he noticed Cas seemed uncomfortable with this topic and he frowned. “What’s wrong? I’m sorry if that was too personal--”
“That’s alright by me, son.”
“Don’t be like that, beautiful, I just wanna see you.”
“Yeah, looks that way,” Dean said. “It’s nice. It’s… relaxing.”
Cas tried to keep an eye roll at bay.
“Anna,” Cas cut in. “It’s Anna, she’s not home, I think she snuck out.”
“Ouch,” Balthazar said, turning to her and putting his hand on his heart. “Hurtful.”
The sheriff was interrupted by a door slamming shut, and John Winchester was gone. The man sighed. “Officers, take these cuffs off. I’ll call Sonny.” Grunting a bit in protest, the officer with the shiner on his eye, courtesy of Dean, unlocked the cuffs from Dean’s wrists. Dean winced a little as they came off, rubbing his sore wrists.
Cas grinned and looked at Dean. “Well, I guess you’re not bad for a rookie.”
Cas laughed. “Yeah, sure.”
Cas thought about it. The idea of going to the dance and watching Dean with Robin made him want to curl into a ball and cry, but maybe Balthazar had a point. If Dean saw him having fun and dancing with Balthazar, maybe… Well, maybe he’d be jealous. That thought was enough for Cas to agree to Balthazar’s insane plan.
“I… I told dad I was sick. I wanted to see Cas.”
Dean found Sonny after the winners all received their awards, unable to contain his bright grin.
Dean nodded, swallowing thickly as he felt warmth spread from where Cas touched him. “Good to know.” They continued walking to their room, and Dean helped Cas to his bed before sitting down on his own. “Get some rest,” he told Cas. “You’ve earned it, hero.”
Benny nudged him with his shoulder, gently, offering a warm smile. “Trust me, man, he looks at you, same way you look at him. Whatever you did, you can’t fuck that up. Not so easy, anyway.”
“I’ve been looking for dear old dad,” the man said, staring Dean down. “But I can make him come right to me now that I found you.”
“Damn, did you see that shiner?” Ash whispered. “Looks like someone beat his ass.”
Letting out a groan that was verging on a sob, he skidded to a stop and turned on his heels. How was it behind him now?
Cas laughed. “You said ass,” he muttered, bursting into more giggles.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. “I get it.” And Dean thought that was that, but Robin continued, speaking carefully.
Cas nodded. “For Anna,” he agreed.
Cas shrugged, smiling. “It’s called a hustle, Dean.”
Yeah, it was decided. He was definitely trying out for the team.
Cas looked up at her and smiled. “Thank you, Robin.”
“Cassie? Hello, earth to Cas?”
“Hey, cut that out,” Balthazar said fiercely, finally getting Cas to look at him. “It’s not your fault. The only one to blame is your dick of a father.”
Balthazar could hear the way his voice shook and it was terrifying. He swallowed hard and nodded. “I called Charlie,” he told Cas. “She’s going to take her home. Come on, kid.”
Cas tensed and instinctively looked to where Charlie was nodding to. He accidentally met eyes with the one and only Meg Masters and his heart clenched painfully. Meg glared daggers at him and Cas looked away,
They all went silent when Gordon entered the room, grabbing a plate of food and leaving without a word.
“Cas,” he started hesitantly.
“Whatever,” Cas laughed. “Now shut up and put on a movie or something. I’ve got some time before curfew.”
“Yeah, you should go,” Gordon said, smiling smugly. “Listen to your friends, Bal--”
“Dean, you have no idea,” Cas breathed out, shaking his head and staring down at the ground.
“Because I’m asking you,” Dean stated with a shrug. Pausing, he added, “I wanna get your side of the story, not some bullshit rumors.”
Dean hated this. He had never been one to become so fixated on any one person. They kissed, Cas wasn’t into it, that should’ve been that. This wasn’t the first time Dean had been rejected, so why the hell did he even care so much? It wasn’t like he was in love with Cas or anything.
Cas grinned, and Balthazar knew he’d do anything to see that beaming bright smile any day of the week.
“Who’s different?” she asked.
“Need me to walk you?” Balthazar asked, standing up.
As he walked into the cafeteria after having grabbed a tray of food, he could feel everyone staring at him. Even Cas was staring, he noticed, and Dean couldn’t meet his eyes. He’d thought they had made progress in chemistry class, but Cas barely spoke a word to him once school was out.
When they made their way to the ticket booth and Cas saw Dean standing there with that cocky grin of his, Cas couldn’t contain his excitement. He ran up and hugged the boy, grinning ear to ear when Dean hugged him back and laughed softly.
“This is war now,” Dean told him with a laugh, and soon enough they were both giggling and splashing water at each other mercilessly.
Outside, Castiel had wandered into the small patch of forest that sat behind the property. He looked up into one of the trees and smiled when he saw a small nest with three baby birds and their mother. He began climbing the tree, settling in with his back against the trunk a few branches below the nest. He watched them with a small smile, leaning back against the tree and enjoying the time alone.
“How did you--”
Dean rode behind him on a zebra, smiling and laughing as they went around and around.
“Try not to think about it, okay? You’re safe, that’s all that matters,” he whispered, leading her to Charlie’s sister’s car.
Other than wrestling practice, Dean doesn’t see much of Cas before Saturday. He’d decided to keep his going to the carnival a surprise. He could already imagine the adorable, shocked smile on Cas’s face when he saw him there.
Dean felt an odd sense of protectiveness at the idea of someone bullying Castiel. He couldn’t quite place it. But he knew what it was like to be different, to be treated like a freak. He wouldn’t wish that on anyone. “Sounds to me like someone needs to teach Gordon a little common decency,” he told Robin fiercely, and she scoffed, pausing her strumming to look at him.
“That’s an understatement,” Dean scoffed. “I mean, I guess I get why he hates me.”
Cas met his eyes for the first time in about 3 hours, and Dean held his breath.
Then (again, simply because he wanted to), Dean brought his free hand up to cup Cas’s barely stubbled cheek. He slid his hand around until his thumb rested just below Cas’s ear and his fingers disappeared into thick black hair.
Cas paused and looked up at Anna, eyes wide. He shook his head and brought himself to his feet, the realization of what he’d just done hitting him like a ton of bricks. Alastair was unconscious, Gordon had run out, and Anna had tears streaming down her face. Cas stumbled back a few feet, looking at his bloodied hands and then at Alastair. He was in deep shit.
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean responded softly. He had no idea what he was doing, he just knew that he wanted to. He knew that he was doing what made him happy. He was just waiting for confirmation that Cas wanted it too…
Dean got back to Sonny’s and walked up the stairs without a word, tense and alert when he walked in the bedroom to find Cas sitting on his bed in the corner. Dean gulped and took a seat on his own bed, grabbing his knife from his pocket. He began twirling it around in his fingers, staring at it in somewhat of a daze.
Dean had busied himself with his pocket knife and the wooden bed posts, carving protective symbols into each one. He startled when Cas spoke, trying to pretend he wasn’t just distracting himself from the very distracting image of Cas with no shirt.
Dean and Cas pulled the kayak up onto shore, then Dean started wading into the water. “Up for a swim?” he asked Cas with a cocky smile. On the inside he was still kinda freaking out, but he didn’t let it show. “It’s only cold until you go numb.”
Fuck.
“Charlie’s right,” Cas said quietly. “Let’s go. He’s not worth it.”
“Dad--”
Balthazar’s jealousy and suspicious of Dean were momentarily forgotten. He grabbed Cas by the shoulders and met his eyes. “Hey,” he said insistently. “Forget about your dad. He’s a self-righteous bastard and he never deserved an amazing son like you. There’s nothing wrong with the way you are. Absolutely nothing.”
“Yeah, Cas?” Balthazar met his eyes, which was a mistake.
“Hey!” Balthazar came through the door and grabbed Gordon, shoving him away from Cas. “Get the fuck away from him, you son of a bitch!”
“Maybe an hour,” Gabriel told him, smiling and taking a seat beside his brother. “Dad’s at the church until eleven.” He paused, then looked at Cas excitedly. “So I heard you made the wrestling team again this year. I’m proud of you, Cas.”
“But I…” Dean trailed off, averting his gaze.
Gordon had opted to stay home, a fact that both Dean and Cas were grateful for. Still, it was a tight fit with Benny sitting in the front seat and the other 4 boys crammed in the back seat of Sonny’s truck. Dean sat between Cas and the door, with Chuck and Ash sitting on Cas’s other side. As uncomfortable as the arrangement was, Dean couldn’t complain much that he was damn near sitting in Cas’s lap. Cas was warm and sturdy and Dean couldn’t help but notice that this was the most physical contact they’d shared since the day they met. It was… well, Dean felt like he was going crazy, but it was nice.
Cas laughed. “It’s alright, Dean. I like it,” he told him with a small smile.
Dean’s heart was still pounding in his ears, and his skin was buzzing and warm all over. He never even knew kissing could feel that good. Sure, Dean had thought about kissing Cas, but he never thought he’d actually go through with it. He definitely never thought that Cas would kiss him. The whole thing made Dean’s head spin.
Gordon grunted and tried to push Dean away but it became pretty clear that Dean was stronger than him. He’d been holding back before. “No, you crazy freak,” he snapped. “You think anyone would believe me?”
“Cas,” he choked out. “Cas! Stay with me, don’t you die on me.”
“Just speaking the truth.”
He saw her looking at Cas and his friends and smile at them, but luckily for Dean the seats closest to them had already been taken. She took a seat a few rows behind them, and that just so happened to mean she was sitting right in front of Dean. She was obviously still trying to be close to Cas, but Dean could work with that.
The only reason she wasn’t expelled was because the essay won some sort of scholarly award and the school didn’t want a controversy on their hands. She was given a very stern warning and that was that.
They made their way towards the other boys and as soon as they were within striking distance, they were met by a squirt gun attack like none that anyone had ever witnessed before. Ash, Benny, and Chuck were all piled into the kayak, armed with water pistols and going absolutely nuts.
It took him a minute or two to find the will to get up. He climbed out of bed, rubbing his eyes and putting on his sweats and a t-shirt. He walked down the hall and frowned when he noticed Anna’s door was open. He peeked inside and felt his heart drop when her bed was empty. Shit.
“Sounds like a yes to me,” Dean grinned. She bit her lip and turned to walk towards the lunch room.
He heard a couple of girls talking behind him and he couldn’t help but listen in.
Cas nodded weakly and closed his eyes, gripping Dean’s shirt with trembling fingers. Dean held him like that until Cas’s breaths evened out and his shoulders slumped. When he was finally asleep, Dean went to lay him down but Cas’s fingers still clung to his shirt. He wasn’t letting go. Dean sighed, smiling and shaking his head. He carefully settled in beside Cas, wrapping his arms around him and holding the boy to his chest. His back would hurt and his arms would be numb in the morning, but at that moment, he didn’t really care. All that mattered was that Cas was okay.
“Whatever you say, Cas,” she drawled, rolling her eyes.
When Cas finally got to the house he stopped running, catching his breath for a moment. He saw some girls sitting on the porch steps, and he approached them. They were very drunk, and that only worried Cas more.
Cas eyed him, contemplative. Then he smiled. “Sure, I can show you some moves.”
“Well,” he said, giggling softly. “I guess now I know what all the fuss is about.”
“I’m sorry,” he eventually said, quiet. “I guess I was just afraid you’d think I was some sort of freak. Everyone else does.”
Cas gave him an odd look but accepted his answer.
Dean laughed, shaking his head. “Maybe,” he said. He smiled at Cas, momentarily pausing his card shuffling. He kinda loved that teasing glint in Cas’s eyes, playful and mischievous.
“Cas…” Dean exhaled, his chest heaving as he struggled to compose himself. He could feel heat coiling in his gut and he swallowed thickly, opening his eyes to look at Cas. He smiled hesitantly when Cas opened his eyes to look at him, but his smile just as soon fell when he saw Cas’s expression shift.
Dean nodded, letting Cas help him to his feet. “I’m fine, Cas, I promise. I’ve had worse.”
Dean handed Cas one of the oars and attempted to steer the boat away from the shore, but he was struggling. Cas laughed and pushed his oar through the water a few times until they were drifting on the gentle waves a few feet out from the beach.
“Wait, you’re not bird boy,” the other boy said, and Dean realized it was Gordon. Then, with smugness in his tone, “Oh well, just as well I kick the shit out of you.” And he was about to do just that when he suddenly hit the ground hard, groaning. “What the--”
“Could’ve fooled me.”
“It’s just that I know the type,” Balthazar said, getting frustrated. Why couldn’t Cas see it?
Dean looked up at him with a defeated expression. There was really no getting around it after that. “You want the truth?”
Cas smiled. “That feels like forever ago.” Robin nodded, smiling softly at him. “I’ll see you later, Robin. Thanks for the flier.”
She smiled at him. “Yeah. It was.”
Dean scratched the back of his head nervously, huffing out a shaky laugh. “Well, uh… I told you about my brother. I just didn’t like the idea of leaving him alone with our dad.” He was surprised at himself for being so honest, but it felt good.
Cas couldn’t help but feel disappointed, but he smiled at Dean. “Okay. I’ll see you later.”
“Confident, huh?” Cas asked with a laugh, standing beside him.
Dean nodded, not quite believing Cas but deciding not to push it too much. “Well, whatever it was, I wouldn’t think less of you for it. Anything that ends with Gordon getting his face kicked in is alright in my book.” Smiling, he finished putting one last band-aid on Cas’s forehead. “There. Good as new.” Then, smirking a little, he said, “You know, you look pretty badass for someone who just fell out of a tree. Might get some nice battle scars.”
“Hey there, chief!”
“I did until you picked it for ten movie nights in a row,” Charlie whined. “How many times are you going to watch it before you get bored?”
No. Cas didn’t want to think about it. The thought made his skin crawl… or maybe it made him buzz. Either way, he decided right then that he would have to stay as far away from Dean Winchester as possible.
He was sitting so close and it was simply intoxicating. But Dean couldn’t look away.
A broken, desperate breath fell from Dean’s lips and then he was grabbing Cas’s face and kissing him with everything he had. Cas melted against him and his hands landed on Dean’s hips, fingers curling into his shirt. Dean moaned into his mouth, soft and wanting and heart-wrenchingly sad.
“Fine,” he sighed. “We can play spin the bottle… with two people. What the hell?”
Dean nodded. Some part of him felt relieved to hear that, but he shoved that thought away. “Well, that explains it, I guess.”
He got Dean wrapped up with some gauze and medical tape, then they both changed into fresh shirts. They sat side-by-side on Cas’s bed, Dean’s arm wrapped around Cas’s shoulders. Cas snuggled in against his chest and sighed shakily.
“Yeah, well don’t get used to it, cuz I’m not staying,” Dean snapped. “I’ll be gone before you know it so take a good look.”
“My point exactly.”
He finally made his legs move and ran out of the gymnasium before Dean could see him. He found Balthazar at the drinking fountains and grabbed his arm, pulling him into an empty classroom and closing the door.
“Hey, Dean!” she said with a smile as she bounced over to him, pecking his cheek. “What do you think? The theme is Stairway to Heaven. I know it’s cliche, but…”
“Yeah, that seems to be his deal,” Dean said, frowning. “Complicated.” He paused, processing what she’d said and smiling. “So… You said you… well, I mean, I like you too.”
“Of course you do, he’s your dad, but--”
“Gabe, w-what’s a homo?” Cas gasped out in between sobs. “Daddy said he doesn’t want me to be one.”
He grabbed two cans of mini ravioli and stuffed them into his jacket. After closing his eyes for a second to steel his nerves, he started walking as casually as he could towards the exit.
“I won’t bite,” Dean told him after a moment, nodding to Cas’s bed. “Don’t worry, you don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to.”
Cas looked up at her and shook his head. “No. I… that’s not a good idea.” After what had happened before… Well, Cas couldn’t let that happen again. His father would… Cas closed his eyes. No. His dad had disowned him. What he thought shouldn’t matter. Besides, Castiel didn’t want to hurt anyone. Not again. Not even Gordon.
The next morning, Sonny asked questions about what had happened to Dean, why he’d found a blood shirt in the trash, why he’d heard Cas crying in the bathroom, etc. Dean didn’t know what to tell him. He just said he got into a fight with some guy and that was that. Sonny clearly didn’t believe him but he told him to stay home and rest while the other boys helped out at the church.
“Dean, wait!” Cas pleaded, “Where are you… Dean!”
Dean didn’t know how to explain this. He had no fucking clue.
