"Mycroft..."
No, clearly the renegade leprechaun had responded to some supernatural call, and if magic was involved how was Sherlock to find his missing lover?
"Nothing! I'm fine!" said John almost, but-not-quite to the squeaking stage.
''This is preposterous. I am a genius. Surely I can manage sex AND mind-work...hmmmm…Normally, I would simply delete distractions, however I refuse to ever delete John. Besides, I tried once, and he is undeletable...BUT, I could enlarge John's annex, making more room to store memories away until their presence is required. It will be John's boudoir, decorated in opulent blue and gold, quite unlike the camouflage design prevalent in most of his annex, and I will store our more intimate moments in there after each instance. That way, they will not interfere with clear thinking.' The tall brunet smirked. 'Now every day can be a sex holiday. Every day...except when we're on a case, obviously... Well, that stricture is unnecessary on the simple, waste-my-time cases that Gavin keeps yammering on about. Every day will be a sex holiday, except when we're on important cases...except when we're on cases over a...four. No, over a five.'
The detective looked down at the blissed-out blond, who sprawled half onto his lap, with a vague half-smile adorning his face. The doctor was so dazed that he hadn't even noticed that Sherlock was smoking, not only smoking, but smoking in bed. Normally this would have had the doctor frothing at the mouth, but then John's mouth was probably a bit tired and sore.
"Of course not. That would be rude, and it never pays to be rude to a werewolf."
"You, you killed her? But that's, that's too drastic. No..."
"Then what?"
"John, what about the tea? And the sugar?" asked Sherlock.
'Oh, oh my God. Just... HIS skin is soft, but prickly, where he missed a spot shaving-GOD! Oh God! That’s HOT!' And back to those lips of One-Thousand-and-One Nights of fantasy. More kissing-nothing gentle now-just the hard forceful meeting of two men, who had been starving for one another for too damn long. 'Fuck, I sound like a bad romance novel,' thought John. 'Must be lack of oxygen from too much kissing. Who cares, I don't care!'
“Falling for me?” Sherlock asked irritated. That hurt and not in a good way.
“So pathetic. Needy bitch. Open your mouth.”
much. Admitting to suffer from withdrawal symptoms irrevocably revealed to John, a medical student nonetheless, how much of a junkie he truly was. Sherlock ducked his head and hunched his shoulders.
The hook-up in the club had sported inky dark hair similar to his own. That´s why blond was wrong.
facts, period.
“Morning, you.” John´s voice was raspy and a bit slurred but he smiled.
But when someone shouted, “Oi, Greg, do the pole yourself. Test if it´s slick enough!” and raucous laughter swept through the rapt audience he quickly announced the pole dancing duo and clambered off the stage with an awkward smile and fully flushed cheeks.
With a possessive glare at the audience, daring them to object, he loosened one arm and put his now free hand firmly onto one of Sherlock´s arse cheeks which peeked out of the obscenely slinky panty and groped it hard.
On stage, Sherlock grabbed the pole again and finally stopped spreading his legs. He closed his knees around the pole and gracefully slid down in a Fireman´s Spin, coming to a halt on his high heels beside the pole, breathing hard.
Definitely showing nerves, John thought. “I´ll be frank.” Sherlock flinched. “Of course, I want you to stay sober and quit the drugs. But I know that it´s you yourself who has to take the first step. I only offer my help if you´d accept it. And, by the way, I still like you.”
What if John kicked him out after waking up nonetheless? Coming to his senses and bereft of the post-coital bliss, figuring out he would rather not share his bed with the punk whose personality was as dissolute as the ripped clothes he wore? Seeing John´s disgust would be really painful.
All eyes were trained on him. Sherlock wore an ankle-length silver cloak with a large hood that nearly concealed his face and also hid his body completely. John matched his partner with a golden one. Sherlock started speaking and the audience quieted down even more. Only Sally loudly hooted “Strip already” but her neighbours shushed her, annoyed, sending her into a sulk.
Then John´s face had shifted from an angry to a very sad expression.
“You´re impossible!” Tutting fondly, John successfully shut him up with pressing his mouth onto Sherlock´s, suffocating all protest effectively with a ferocious kiss.
“No, you git! Me falling for the age-old trope of “the soap fell down”. I can´t believe you did something as corny as that.”
“Me too,” Sherlock surprised himself by saying, no traces left of his usual acerbity.
“It´s been shot from backstage where she´d helped us with putting on the costumes and just look at the username, John. MissMiami221. It´s ridiculously obvious,” he stated not bothered about the content at all before he returned to dissecting a hedgehog brain. Clearly, it must have been vital for solving Sherlock´s current case. Whatever.
Sherlock was determined to nail the pole dancing part and eagerly planned their training. John was a bit reluctant at first and did not quite see reason why he should put so much effort into a stupid bet made up by the rude officer Donovan. Why should he relent to a whim of that bad-mouthing bitch?
The yearning for love was always found on the losing side. Sherlock did not need sentiments. They made him vulnerable in a way he was actually afraid of. Mere carnal pleasure was safer. No regrets. No remorse. No need to justify his needs and no need to change his obnoxious behaviour. No need to fight for being accepted like he was. He had long ago quit the pointless endeavour trying to act nice.
Sherlock knew a tailor who owed him a favour for solving the Puzzle of the Poisoned Pincushion (of course he did) and the man expertly made them replicas of the costumes which were sturdy enough to endure a pole dance. He had to minimise the wings, of course.
John´s arms came around his midsection, hugging him tightly. A stubbly chin rested on his spine and he could feel John´s exhales warming his skin. It was tender and intimate. The physical proximity was exhilarating. It made Sherlock feel welcomed and loved.
Which had reminded Sherlock of a cat bringing a captured mouse to its owner as a sort of love gift. Sherlock liked dead bodies, so it had been a perfect present. The dating had quickly evolved into a relationship which also quickly included all kinds of sexual acts and resulted in John and Sherlock falling deeply in love with each other. Both were really happy.
, I'll light you up like a Samhain bonfire."
"Yes, John?"
The tempest overtook them, knocking the brothers to the ground. Looking up from under the hand, shielding his eyes, Sherlock saw leaves and branches flying past. He shook his head; in the roiling clouds it almost seemed as if he saw dark warriors on black steeds; he almost thought that he heard their cries and the sound of hooves thundering past.
No, 'Eggs or waffles, John?'
John blinked and slowly turned toward Sherlock, seeming to look past the consulting detective. Sherlock hated this. He was used to being the center of John's world. Why wasn't he the focus of John's attention now?
"…you are not going to clinic tomorrow," continued Sherlock. "I myself will call to let them know you are too sick to see patients. I will not mention that you might make some patients uncomfortable with your untoward symptoms, especially the emesis, not to mention, they’d have difficulty understanding your speech since you can’t properly produce liquid consonants. Furthermore, I intend to make you tea and toast, before setting to work on some cold cases that I shall obtain from Lestrade. You needn’t worry about being left to fend for yourself, I shall also ensure that Mrs. Hudson provides you with additional tea, sustenance and tedious conversation.”
Of course, the logical explanation for John's absence from Sherlock's bed was that Elizabeth must have woken up, and John was upstairs caring for her. Obvious.
Sherlock nibbled and sucked on the shorter man's lips, as if they were gourmet delicacies. Which they were, decided the detective. They were his gourmet delicacies.
He intercepted some angry looks sent his way by Cousin Avaril. He added her to the list of Beings Who Wanted to Shag John. If she wasn't careful, Miss Avaril might even get on to the detective's Need To Kill List.
"And you were frightened? Of me?" scoffed Sherlock. "Even if I was a vampire, that seems a bit ridiculous.”
"Mycroft, keep an eye on the bloodsucker in the corner," said Sherlock loudly. "I have to go change John's clothes."
"John!" shouted Sherlock, hurrying to the bathroom door, which swung open to reveal John's swollen, pale, sweaty face.
Sherlock snatched the battered old Tilley hat off of his own head to shield John's face from the storm. In another flash of lightning, the detective observed a long, bleeding slash that cut across John's face from temple to chin. Fortunately it missed John's beautiful eyes, eyes that stared at the sky and not at Sherlock.
Despite the poor visibility due to falling rain and oncoming nightfall, Mycroft, Sherlock and John were immediately spotted by Father when they rounded the shrubbery. So much for subterfuge.
see the light welling up from John's fingers, confirming that Richard either had fairy sight too, or else he was another supernatural. Sherlock was prepared to wager on the latter.
"John, we are discussing Elizabeth's new bedroom, obviously. I took the liberty of painting it blue, like her eyes, which are just like your eyes, you know… ...but we could paint it pink, if you insist." This last was said with contempt, because Sherlock hated pink, as did Elizabeth.
John shivered and remained stubbornly stiff, which paradoxically only made him more adorable. The stoic and resolutely not-cute blond held out for almost two minutes before snuggling into Sherlock's broad chest.
('Of course, strong, silent, repressed John would be vocal, once he's pleasured by someone who understands him, like me. And of course, John is a natural bottom. I knew he was a bottom...and a tiny bit submissive too,) deduced the domineering detective. (Just look how well he takes orders. Look how well suited he was to the army. Look how beautifully he pushes back against my finger. My beautiful, gorgeous John would fuck himself against my finger until he ejaculates without any manipulation of his phallus... if I let him. But will I let him? Should I let him?)
John swallowed, licking his lips. (As always, Sherlock found John's pink tongue a bit distracting.) Then the leprechaun attempted to clarify. "They already
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, even though no one could appreciate his grimace in the dark.
Of course, John.
"It's Fionn mac Cumhaill. You have to come when he calls!" shouted John, jutting his chin out. "But…" he paused, poking Sherlock with his finger for emphasis, "but he never forces anyone to join the hunt or his bed. Never!"
John's mouth twisted in a strange facsimile of a smile, and then held his finger up again. Sherlock assumed that the finger meant 'got it in one' again.
"Why? Why did you leave? Did she hurt you?" Sherlock demanded angrily. "Did she threaten Elizabeth? Did she cut you with that knife? I swear ..."
Sherlock had deduced the solution to his Watsons' problems, although he had required a spark from his conductor of light.
Mummy planted her hands gently but firmly on John's shoulders, bringing the leprechaun's attention back to the matriarch. Sherlock privately admitted that this was a shrewd maneuver on Mummy's part, because even at the best of times, the leprechaun was very distractible.
"I did wonder that, but I decided that if you...died, I probably wouldn't want tea anymore anyway. I wouldn't want anything anymore without you."
"Wait!” called Mummy. "Mycroft, you must help your brother find John."
"The hell he is!" snapped Sherlock. No one was going to take John. Besides, the detective had enough of this talking duo that said nothing important and yet uttered it in such a ridiculous fashion.
"John, we've already covered that, but yes. I wish you to move back in to your home here with me. And by the way, you should say, 'me and Elizabeth' not' Lizzy and me'. I realize that society has all but forsaken the finer points of proper language and grammar..."
Sherlock glared at the man's cool overfamiliarity. Then he recalled John's description of the Grim Reaper. This man was tall (taller even than Mycroft). He was clearly more cool than Sherlock and more handsome. (Well, maybe not
John received the infamous sideways glare.
"You are shivering. You are always cold, and it gets worse when you are sick," said Sherlock. "Not to mention, this room is always cold. I shall complain to the management."
had a history, moving Richard to the top of Sherlock's To Kill List. "...bloody upper-class vampire," muttered John furiously, still rubbing his cheek. "...thinks he can feed on whomever he likes…"
"Maybe I can show you later, when I'm not sick and disgusting," said John, rolling over. "G'nite She’wock."
And like any good leprechaun, John was ready to protest that it wasn't a miracle but rather luck, which had protected everyone. Indeed, he probably wanted to argue that it wasn’t a storm at all but rather a sign of some supernatural visitation. Sherlock didn't give his boyfriend the opportunity to make either protest, because Sherlock shoved a cup of tea up to his leprechaun's lips. It was either drink, choke or spill the tea. As Sherlock had predicted, John was loath to waste tea, and he swallowed it while sparing a side-eyed glare with his partner.
Suddenly the closeness felt too much, threatening even. Sherlock broke the bubble by wriggling his hips and turned around to face John. Once again, he put on his seductive and shameless attitude. Sherlock pinched John´s nipple softly while his other hand flicked the tip of John´s cock. His own erection aligned with John´s belly.
Straining his memory to recall the last night was hard. Sherlock had always deleted the who, where and when of his latest fuck to only memorise the what. There was nothing more to it. A quick shag to alleviate the constant lack of interesting input and to stave off the mind-numbing boredom of his life in between shooting up.
Called out, Sherlock snapped out of his own pensive state, feeling actually bad and ashamed of his drug habit. That was a first. Heat was rising in his cheekbones and Sherlock knew he was blushing on top of it all to make his current humiliation complete.
“Yes, my Captain,” Sherlock smiled broadly. He turned to open the front door and grinning mischievously before he left, Sherlock added that smug wink John had come to love already.
“Make me.” Sherlock rasped, proud of his ability to resist.
Shaking himself and disgusted about his own weakness, Sherlock stripped quickly and stepped under the lukewarm spray. He shivered and waited for the water to turn hot, to reach a temperature able to melt away all his tainted skin and cleanse the shrunken soul he called his own.
Sally Donovan and Philip Anderson also secretly downloaded the video and salivated every time over watching it, focussing on John´s six-pack or Sherlock´s over-knee boots respectively.
“Look at me,” John growled, seeing how Sherlock had temporarily zoned out and making him nod eagerly in return, “and listen closely,” changing the nods to slightly desperate.
John softly punched Sherlock´s shoulder. “Not going to happen. I´m keeping you. You´re quickly becoming my favourite jumper.”
Instead, he had just so managed to pull on his discarded clothes, cursing when his foot got caught in one of the numerous holes of the ripped black jeans. He stumbled out of Chris´ room into the hallway which connected the rooms of the shared flat. Sherlock vaguely remembered that apart from Chris two other students lived here. He brazenly opened an adjoining door and found the room behind unoccupied. There was a freshly made bed inside, smelling of fabric softener and with meticulously folded blankets.
Ogling Sherlock disdainfully, Chris stated, “You´re filthy and reek of sweat and cum.”
They agreed to continue working out at the pole, starting the next day. Without mentioning it any further, Sherlock showed up in the Barbarella costume and John as the angel. Neither was surprised.
had four black ribbons adorning the front of this shiny excuse for a piece of clothing and two sleek black straps along its sides made Sherlock´s slender body look even longer.
And now he had woken up beside John.
“Hmm, I diagnose a severe state of hard-on,” John tutted, “but on the plus side it´s curable.”
None of them were ashamed of being gay or bisexual respectively but they agreed to keep their relationship a secret from the always prying eyes of the Yarders. Both just felt that the berks (maybe except Greg Lestrade) did not deserve knowing of their happy and sexually very fulfilling relationship.
Strangely, John had been angry when Sherlock confessed the unusualness of him staying over at the hook-up´s place afterwards because they simply were interested in using his body. And that Sherlock was okay with it and not expecting anything different.
This evening over dinner, Sherlock deigned to eat a full plate because John made “the thing with the peas”, he suspiciously casually mentioned “It would be a real shame to let the pole fall into disuse now the bet is over, with all the work we put into refurbishing 221c.”
Sherlock hopped down the stairs to the ground floor, bare footed and shirtless, his mind still lingering on the adorable face John had made when he flaunted his arse and entered the kitchen. A large table was positioned in the middle, surrounded by six chairs, all in a different type and colour. Two of the walls were occupied by cupboards and electrical appliances and the third sported a curtained window.
“My bed, my rules,” John growled quietly into Sherlock´s ear, “submit,
“Sounds good to me.” John started stripping the bed but became severely distracted when he watched Sherlock prancing around starkers to pick up the black skinny jeans he had worn yesterday. Sherlock bent down dramatically and wriggled his hips much more than necessary to slide into the ridiculously ripped fabric, without any pants beneath, making an Oscar-worthy show of putting himself away before he deliberately fumbled with closing the zip.
covered his groin area and exposed his long sinewy arms and lean thighs. And, when Sherlock performed a deliberately slow spin, also exposed the lower part of his taut arse cheeks in such a lewd way that the audience, men and women alike, just freaked out and visibly recoiled in steamrollered shock.
John instantly wanted to see Sherlock in that glittering bodice which exposed his mile-long lean thighs. Thighs that would be dressed in silvery over knee high heeled boots, too. He was not so sure about putting on that golden Tarzan-style piece of fabric himself but seeing Sherlock secretly salivating and swallowing at the movie poster confirmed that his lover must have the same daydreams about John in that golden… whatever you would call that.
Sherlock´s cock gave a longing twitch. “Or what?”
“You may not like me when I´m sober. When the fire of the high dies down I´m usually even more acerbic, obnoxious and rude.”
More fragments of last night came back. Sex with Chris had been rather disappointing. It had been over quickly and consisted of uninspired pounding into Sherlock´s hole. Chris had simply shoved his dick into Sherlock and had worked himself into a sloppy orgasm while grunting non-verbally. Sherlock nearly had missed to get off himself and so therefore had been deeply unsatisfied. A wasted night, rather.
Did they date or not? (They had had their first date right after John had shot that awful cabbie for Sherlock.)
https://meetinginsamarra.tumblr.com/post/650879048946499584
When it was time to say goodbye and part ways until their evening date at Angelo´s, John hugged Sherlock tenderly, feeling how his muscles trembled under the clothes. Sherlock´s hands on John´s hips shook with tremors, too.
Sherlock was completely unfazed because he never listened to popular music. When John asked him about that he stated that popular came from the Latin word “populus” which not only meant “folk” but also meant lower folk such as in “riffraff” which made the whole music genre abhorrent to him.
It was a miracle. A conundrum.
A game. A
A hot wave of happiness made Sherlock´s heart miss a beat. Miss several beats. “Does that mean you´ll have me again? Overnight? Here?” Incredulity flooded his brain.
“Hmm. Surely a tease but sadly not fucking yet.”
After The Second Incident happened, Sherlock became very industrious. He bought a pole, he ordered flat 221c to be cleared and cleaned, he had the pole installed in the basement together with mirrors on the wall and a nice wooden parquet floor on the ground. He had a sound system built in. He had the heating fixed. For preparation, he acquired 56 books on the techniques of pole dancing, 41 of them including a DVD. Sherlock watched them all. Multiple times.
My dear beta peageetibbs immediately pointed out that the ending screams for another sequel... I know. (sigh) Don´t know if it will happen (yet). (deeper sigh)
So, no cocaine bugs. At least not yet. That was good.
Back on the stage the choreography continued.
Meaning that they had be not been secretly kissing at crime scenes. No secret cuddling in presence of the officers. No arse-groping (which both liked very much because their partner would always squeal undignified when being surprised) while on the premises of New Scotland Yard. No physical contact whatsoever at all.
John laughed, delighted by Sherlock´s put-upon indignant air. “So modest for someone who looks like dragged out of a skip.”
“Whatever floats your boat to deny being fucking turned on by wearing that,” John thought and did not complain, of course. He was fucking turned on as well.
The Yarders stared. This was not what they´d expected. What John just did was an example of perfect body control, beautiful and simple-looking but everyone who´d done pull-ups before knew that it was hard.
Maybe.
That provoked another firm slap. John´s free hand smacked against Sherlock´s pierced nipple causing the small metal spikes of the ring to poke into tender flesh.
Bono Vox of U2 sang the lines “One love, one life, It's one need, In the night” in the background with a sultry voice.
“And yet it turns you on.” Sherlock gestured pointedly below towards John´s erection. Without any further ado he reached for one condom package lying on top the towels, opened it and nimbly slipped the latex over John´s cock. Giving it an appreciative pad, he shot John a questioning glance with a raised eyebrow, prompting him to disagree.
“Ha, I knew you couldn´t keep your mouths off each other,” Donovan hooted triumphantly, “you just lost the bet.”
How much of the conversation had John heard? Would it all end now? Wide-eyed and shaking, Sherlock watched a very angry looking John step up towards the table. The hand at his side clenched and unclenched rhythmically, ready to throw a punch.
Chris… topher. Yes.
Enough!
Time flew by in gigantic strides and so the party day arrived.
Usually, it went like this:  After having used Sherlock´s body and hopefully satisfied both of them, the other not-so-horny-anymore guy would kick Sherlock out after the shagging part was done. No one wanted him to stay the night. After all, they had gotten what they wanted in the first place. Namely to thoroughly fuck the useless punk, the promiscuous slut who really had it had coming by his obnoxious behaviour. Apart from his body Sherlock had nothing left to be liked.
Yet, Sally could not really begrudge them failing to screw up. The show had been nothing but spectacular, especially for two men who had never put a hand on a pole ever before.
Sherlock noticed that Anderson´s knees were in a bad shape the days following after the mysterious posters had popped up. He asked Philip if he was currently doing the floor-scrubbing at Sally´s flat and earned himself a death glare. Nothing new under the sun, really.
John on the other hand found out that he did not like wearing a loincloth. He exchanged the stupid thing with red boxer briefs for practicing. Sherlock did not mind.
They flinched and instantly jumped apart. Anderson´s face was flushed in shame and he turned away to fiddle with an evidence bag. Donovan´s face was flushed in radiant anger and she turned to confront a gaping Sherlock.
He looks away again, scratching short nails against his skin. He'd rather not, actually. Because if he does, if he does provide his answer to that question, then he answers it with
All feedback is welcome and appreciated!!! Thank you so much for reading, and stay healthy! <3
He settled in the seat next to his mad genius, grinning and the knot in his stomach loosened for the first time in a week, and knew that this was going to go well.
It's silent still. The whole flat is so damn
Yep. Definitely alarming.
Sherlock, I said this means you can't be texting me to come pass you a pen or meet you at Barts or water your bloody plant. I'll be in Dublin, yeah? For five days. I won't come, not even if the world's on fire.
Sherlock wisely refrained from pointing out that he’d uttered two sentences and therefore had ‘gotten it’ in two.
One hour and fifty-seven minutes: Sherlock was still thirsty. The flat was cold because John hadn't lit the fire yet. The sitting room was depressingly dark, because John should have been home one hour and fifty-seven minutes ago to turn on the lights.
"Oh god, yes," murmured the mesmerized medico.
"No. No more sex for a few years, or at least not for a few hours. What was this operation called," asked the stubborn doctor.
Of course, he suspected Mycroft that Mycroft had drugged the tea, because Mycroft would naturally be jealous of Sherlock's loyal, loving and very sexy goldfish.
"M'fine," said John, returning back to the matter at hand. "Okay so you want us, Lizzy and me, to move in with you?"
John responded with his index finger again. The 'got it in one' finger was becoming annoyingly tedious already, and Sherlock sighed (both because of John’s repetitious and amateurish sign language and because his tea had no sugar).
"Yes," said Sherlock, "I thought a joke might break the tension. She's only made two hits, plus the one she did while she was carrying Elizabeth. You know, no one suspects that a pregnant woman could be dangerous. I think she may use that as a cover rather more frequently now."
(Brilliant!) thought the detective, trying to hide his glee.
"I hate you," Sherlock muttered to his insufferable sibling.
John shuddered at the memory of that grizzly episode, all that foul, nasty, smelly stuff melting and then leaking into his hair, and over his wound and finally staining his trousers too.
"Ahm not cute," said John, looking fiercely adorable in the dim light that crept in from the hallway.
John couldn't die. John was too important. He was much more important than Sherlock. John saved lives both as a doctor and as a former soldier with a slightly illegal sidearm...but mostly as a doctor. John was good and kind and compassionate. John deserved to live more than anyone.  Besides, John loved the World's Only Consulting Detective. And the World's Only Consulting Detective felt a bit of sentiment for John.
"Delicious," muttered Sherlock, his voice low and sinful. His lips moved over John's face-ever so slightly rough even after his morning shave. He traveled over to an ear (which had also been teasing him for quite some time.) He breathed his voice into his doctor's perfect ear, murmuring a deduction and feeling John shudder and moan under his skillful ministrations. Of course, John's ear was also perfect for nibbling on, just like the doctor's perfect lips.
'Ah…no, not sexy. Remember, we do NOT go there,' John chided himself sternly. 'Remember HE'S married to his work, which is fine; it's all fine.'
"Let you sweep?" repeated Sherlock with a chuckle. "And She'wock? Your speech impediment is rather amus..."
"You need to see a dentist," offered Sherlock, experiencing that sinking feeling that he always got when John was sick.
Oh yes, John was very irritated with the twins. Sherlock bounced on his toes to celebrate having been right.
"Yes, obviously."
, so Sherlock stood there like a disgruntled statue until Mummy finished playing with his curls.
…Sherlock deduced that the long healing cut on John's side was a knife wound, and Mary caused it, and Sherlock had a plan for Mary.
"Very good. Which. Night?"
"It huwts, She'wock," said John, who never admitted to feeling pain.
Ah! The front door finally opened. There was a brief delay (to hang up his coat). And there was the tread of the doctor's feet coming up the stories—bit slower than usual. John was probably cold and tired. Today's small talk would be about the foul weather AND some tedious incident in the clinic.
John would go out in the rain, even if he did hear a car horn. And just as the scones were done, too. He said
In the deepening dusk, the detective could see John slowly shaking his head no.
"I do wonder, John; how is it that
"But how..." began John.
'God, he'll see that I'm lusting after him. Now I really will have to go to New Jersey,' thought the doctor.
"Well, now just a moment, son. I don't see how your young man could just sneak out the back door," said Father. "I mean we were all right here. Even with Leonora playing with the lights, we would have noticed if your John stepped out. He must still be in the house."
"Yes. Certainly," John said with a nod. "But your brother’s already figured out that I wasn't completely human.”
"...to anyone."
Sherlock found this extremely distracting.
"I hate you," Sherlock muttered to his insufferable sibling.
'Might as well enjoy it while I can ', thought the doctor, sighing and telling himself it was fine.
"Yes, but…"
"I know what you meant," scoffed the World's Only Consulting Detective, tousling his lover's hair, because he knew that John hated having his hair mussed—except during sex, which is why Sherlock had an almost Pavlovian arousal when he saw John's hair sticking up in all directions.
"And you didn't think to mention it to me?" cried Sherlock, stepping in front of the shorter man and stopping him cold.
"Ummm. 'Til tonight…maybe."
'No, no, no!' thought Sherlock. 'You cannot leave me!'
"I didn't hear a horn," said Mycroft, nodding at Sherlock as if they were on the same team, which was preposterous. Sherlock repositioned himself to hover over his leprechaun, so that there would be no doubt that he was on John's team.
(Perhaps, he is quiet, because he is actually deleting what I said?) thought the detective hopefully.
'It would seem that a dangerous sociopathic part-time assassin has been deemed better and probably safer, than a dangerous, sociopathic, part-time consulting detective,' thought Sherlock sadly.
Her voice was temporarily lost in the racket of everyone trying to talk above everyone else. Concerned and nosy relatives blocked the door, leaving Sherlock no choice but to push his way in, jostling everyone and earning his usual complement of disapproving comments and thinly veiled insults. Somewhere along the line, Cousin Avaril attached herself to John, leaving the consulting detective to trail behind his leprechaun. The warm kitchen smelled of scones, ham and too many damp Holmeses. Not surprisingly, Sherlock vented his irritation and frazzled nerves by slamming the door shut with a loud bang followed by pouting.
Still, the potential for disaster was high.
that he was looking forward to tasting my scones."
"Oh. My. God," said John repetitiously. It was dull hearing John repeat himself, but Sherlock would put up with even more repetition for John's sake. Besides, suddenly the robe slipped open again and that was decidedly not dull.
"Bah!" grumbled the detective. "You were being an unobservant idiot. You did not observe the missing button. But you were not a bother. Neither you nor your daughter will ever be a bother to me."
"Why?" asked the taller man again.
back into our house," said Mycroft.
Oh all right, he loved John Watson—more than anything in the whole world.
"I really think I should stay and keep an eye on Richard," John said. "Not only is he a bloodsucker, but he's a confidence man—you just can't trust him."
"But Mummy,” Mycroft protested, “It's raining, and I won’t be able to use my umbrella in all that wind. Besides, the scones are ready."
"…and dreadful weather…
"Obviously, but Elizabeth is a miniature female you, so that doesn't count," said the younger man. "You will both be mine, to not share with anyone."
"And..."
"No but...her employers...they might come and..."
"No, don't botha Mrs. Hudson with it!" said John.
"Fine, then let's get you out of those wet clothes."
"Sherlock, I have it all worked out what I want to say...so just, just listen. First of all, I'm sorry..."
"You were! You don't get
"Well, he isn't here! I'm in my dressing gown, Sherlock," she said, stating the obvious and raising her voice at the end of his name, which also indicated displeasure in his behavior.
"It was ghastly…"
In fact, Sherlock took a moment's pause, to place a notice in the foyer of his mind palace recommending that Sherlock prevent any potential rivals from coming within a within a six foot radius of John's very talented mouth. In addition, potential rivals would be defined as all persons between the ages of twenty and sixty unless they were comatose or Tibetan hermits…upon further deliberation, the detective decided that practicing Tibetan hermits would not considered threats, but former hermits might be potential rivals and were therefore subject to the restriction...Then he added, trespassers to be removed without prejudice.
Normally, John was eager remove his clothing with Sherlock, but the leprechaun continued his unpleasant, out-of-character behavior, planting his feet firmly on the floor, while glaring daggers at the tall, dark stranger.
"...made clear…"
"Coffee?" Cousin Avaril interrupted brightly, handing John and Sherlock each a mug of coffee. "Luckily," she gushed like a hormonal geyser, "the gas stove is working, so the coffee is hot and fresh, unlike that tea, Sherlock gave you, John."
'It's not so much their affair," thought the good doctor. 'It's all the lying and cheating. And it's more Mary than James. And dammit, it's the shooting of Sherlock-that was unforgivable. And then there were the threats and...'
"Very well. You rest here, and I will return with paracetamol and copious amounts of water," said Sherlock.
John nodded, still looking troubled as he bit his lip.
Uninvited Guests crash Mummy"s tea party. Someone might want John for dinner…or did he want Sherlock? And was it for dinner or something else?
John rushed from the room with a hand covering his mouth.
"Like father, like daughter," murmured Sherlock.
"You can see it," deduced Mycroft.
"Some supernatural person named Finn, who lusts after my boyfriend, signals with a horn, and
"No! You git!" exclaimed John. "Ah toad you this mo’ning! Ah hab an abscess. Bad tooth! Second mower on the left."
"Just look at the two of you!" said Mummy accusingly. She abandoned Mycroft to Father’s.
The human infant in question sucked on her dummy, resolutely not sleeping yet not opening her eyes. Dwarfed by her godfather's long limbs and large hands, she nuzzled her head against his chest.
John dropped his red face into his hands with a groan. He was so embarrassed that he didn't even wonder how Sherlock read his mind-again.
Still no kiss.
"Maybe he's coming for you, John. You do bear the mark of Fionn," said Mycroft heartlessly.
"Sherlock," sputtered John angrily, but quietly, " if you wake that baby..."
"Yes."
Sherlock sighed in relief. His brother didn't know that John actually did possess the ability to bewitch someone—or at least cast his glamour on them.
"I'm goin' back to bed," said the man who probably should be in hospital, not heading back to Sherlock's bedroom.
To begin with, he'd use simple words and short sentences, suitable to someone with traumatic brain damage. "Did you go to the pub? Did you get into a fight? Do you have a concussion?" (Wait that's not a short word) "Do you have a head injury?" (Mm, still too long.) "Show me your head!"
He'd wanted to say that body parts aside, he trusted Sherlock a hell of lot more than her. John had found himself wanting to punch the woman, who pretended to be his wife. He'd never punched a woman before, but she tempted him. Sometimes it was just very hard not to clock her just once, but so far, John had managed to restrain himself. He was a bit proud of that restraint actually, especially since she herself exercised no restraint at all.
Of course John had had second thoughts. He'd probably gone running back to Mary.
Sherlock growled; Mycroft was not supposed to smile at John. He turned away from the food in John's hand, but then John pushed out his lower lip in a fetching pout, licking it for good measure. The detective sighed and took the offered bit of sandwich; it was ham and cheese with mustard. John smiled at Sherlock. The room seemed so much brighter when John smiled.
"How. Is. Your. Breathing?" said Sherlock, keeping the words slow and simple, in case the mental confusion was severe.
"I see. And who is after him? Did he steal from a criminal organization? Or is it worse; is he a deserter? Has he betrayed a governmental agency—perhaps the CIA?"
Which was more than fine.
"...a vampire? Yes," finished John.
"I still think you should let me threaten him a little," said the sullen consulting detective. "I know where he lives."
Sherlock slapped his hands over his ears as soon as he heard the sound of retching emanating from the loo. He hated that sound. Why did John have to be sick tonight? If he’d become ill last Monday, Sherlock would have been on that case at Harrods. It was only a six, but at least the thieves had made an effort to be interesting. If it had been Monday, then Sherlock would have been out of the flat, and wouldn't have been forced to listen to those wretched, sick, choking sounds.
John smiled gently, "No, not at all." He yawned hugely. "She just had a very messy nappy, and then she decided that she needed a bottle. Then, she had a bit of gas..."
"...we can only tell you that he's coming…"
"Oh, the usual reasons," said John, scowling down into the mud.
"Sherlock?" said John.
Happy Shamrock Day!!!
"It's right where you left it. It's fine, except the electricity seems to be broken," said John, who appeared as if out of nowhere. Indeed, the house could be seen, if only just, as a darker hulk standing against the dark and weeping sky. A bolt of lightning briefly illuminated the house before rain and fog concealed it once more.
amounts. Sherlock could actually breathe again, and he sucked in deep draughts of the ozone-tainted air.
John blinked; he'd never seen his best friend blush. Not even when that dreadful Woman tried to seduce him. Of course, Sherlock's dreadful Woman wasn't as dreadful as John's dreadful wife...but, soon to be ex-wife, thank God.
"I did it. I did it!" cried Cousin Phillip. He was pudgy, twenty-seven and fancied himself a magician. There was another round of polite applause from the assembled family members.
He yawned and considered his own weariness, which was undoubtedly caused by the drugged tea. And because of the drugged tea, his mind was ever so slightly sluggish, which made it difficult to deduce who actually had drugged the tea. It was all a bit circuitous.
"Still…I don't want you to think that you have to mind Lizzy for me," said John quietly. "I don't expect you..."
"My goodness, John, look at this cut!" exclaimed Mummy, shaking her head at the long cut on John's cheek.
The brunet leaned forward, wearing a predatory grin.
Finding it difficult to face down his foe with a mouthful of hot, buttery scone, John was forced to back down, although he continued to send dark scowls at everyone—including Sherlock.
(No, I mean doctor. I had plans for Lestrade, as you well know. And now that fool of a doctor is going to abscond to New Jersey with my goldfish,) spat mind palace Mycroft.
"I suppose...you couldn't find any sugar?" suggested Sherlock.
"For God's sake, Sherlock, it's obvious! He was struck by debris, just as we were." Mycroft gathered his soggy dignity and his outrage and lashed out at his brother's boyfriend. "As for you, Mr. Watson, you're a fool. You could have gotten yourself killed. You could have gotten Sherlock killed!"
"Cake, Mycroft?" interrupted Sherlock, proffering a slice of carrot cake. Mycroft curled his lip into a sneer and shook his head, before returning his glance to John with a smile.
"How about,” said John, interrupting Sherlock’s train of thought. “How about we shawe pwobwems and work on them as a team, one day at a time? Yeah?”
"Nonsense, her middle-of-the-night meals will be no inconvenience to me, for, as you know, I require little sleep," he said, toning down his baritone, so as not to alarm the almost, but-not-quite, sleeping baby. "Indeed, it will be a benefit to you since you are clearly not getting sufficient sleep."
"Ah can wiv with that,” said John, throwing a leg and arm around his detective in order to capture more body heat. He might also have wanted a hug, which Sherlock provided.
Of course John was having second thoughts.
"Sherlock, you're making me dizzy."
Sherlock's mind palace went dark and utterly silent, as his neurons ceased to function, because he didn't
THE END
Still, normal humans couldn't see the faint light that emanated from John whenever he performed magic, so perhaps Mycroft wouldn't notice it either.
"Ohhhh, st, sto...uhhnnn," groaned John, clinging to Sherlock. "Oh, G,g,god...ohhhhhhuhhhnnn"
Sherlock stretched out a long arm. No John. The sheets were just barely warm.
"Who's Finn?" demanded Sherlock who disliked not knowing anything—especially when Mycroft so clearly
"Oh God!" choked John. Even if Sherlock didn't care who saw the mess in his hair, John did care. "Oh dear, God."
"...but at least the meals were tasty…"
Sherlock shook his head. Thunder sounded yet again, though it was now moving away, leaving Sherlock to call for his lover in vain.
"Yes, he
Oddly, John's grin broadened, lighting up the gloomy sitting room as only John could do (aside from John's infant daughter of course, because she had inherited John's ability to conduct light.)
John smiled faintly, dropping his head back and relaxing for the first time in ages, because from where he sat in this red, over-stuffed chair (his red, over-stuffed chair) life was finally back to what it was supposed to be.
Phillip tapped the wand against the pantry door three times. The lights flickered mysteriously, courtesy of young Leonora, who lurked next to the light switch. Phillip grinned conspiratorially and opened the door with a flourish. The pantry remained jam-packed with tins and sundries but did not contain a short blond man.
"Do you take me for a fool?" Mycroft almost snarled. "If you were a leprechaun you'd be guarding fairy treasure."
Sitting in the dark with John's head on his chest was comforting, because now he could monitor his lover for any life-threatening complications.
"Well, it's about time you showed up, John Watson," began Mycroft sourly.
The room was quiet aside from the sleet hitting the window and the shuffling of the doctor’s feet as he slowly collected the tea...and then the milk.
"That's the problem when you make unsuitable alliances outside your
Sherlock was impressed. Because John was incandescent. After the first few minutes, when John (his John) was doing a very good impression of a deer-in-the-headlights, the former soldier, known as 'Three Continents' Watson, had suddenly rejoined the game, illustrating with his mouth some of the reasons why he'd been so popular among the ladies.
Sherlock puffed on the second to last cigarette that he would ever smoke in the flat, now that little Elizabeth Shirley was moving in.
John couldn't have run back to Mary, because she was on a plane headed to Eastern Europe. Obvious.
"Except me," John amended quickly.
!" said the brunet scathingly.
"I should, but I don't," said John, running his foot up and down Sherlock's long stretched out leg. "How long do we have before people come to gloat over me coming to my senses?"
"I feel faint," squeaked Aunt Penelope.
"Manddibuwar." As expected from his slurred speech, John mangled the word mandibular, which was fairly amusing. It was the reason why Sherlock had asked the question in the first place. Naturally, he had already observed that the swelling overlaid the left mandible.
"And that message was?" prompted Sherlock.
John was out there in that blasted storm? And what was this business with a horn? The detective had a bad feeling about all this, and while he generally didn't base any of his actions on some ill-defined sentiment, he would make an exception for John. He reached for his coat but was stopped by his father, who laid a hand on his arm.
And then guilt, in the shape of a tiny, John-shaped angel, reared its affectionately smiling, self-righteous little head. No, a good partner did not abandon his partner post operatively said the little blond angel and Sherlock’s conscience in unison.
John twisted his head, afraid for a moment to admit it, then he gave a little nod, "Yes. Yes, I do," affirmed the doctor with another nod for emphasis. "I love you, Sherlock."
'Yes! Once more John's idiocy leads me to the light!' thought the detective.
Mycroft as usual, had to interfere, grabbing Sherlock’s arm. "It would help if we knew the nature of the threat," said Mycroft, turning first to the leprechaun and then to the twins.
"What?" asked John. "What territory?"
"Sorry, I shouldn't have...no. Um...sorry" mumbled John backing slowly away. "It was my mistake...um...um..." John licked his lip nervously and then bit it.
John's answer to the last question was doubly correct. It made up for not correctly naming the day, or night, of the week, which was a comfort. Perhaps the ambulance was unnecessary for now.
John smiled hopefully at his best friend and waited for Sherlock to deduce everything (except THAT, well, maybe even THAT, because then John won't have to say anything at all about THAT).
She finally opened the door, wearing her purple, lilac and red floral print dressing gown. It was hideous as always, but Sherlock didn’t tell her so, because finding his fugaitve physician took precedence.
"Wrong! He's a fine man…"
"...just heavenly," said twin number two.
"Since you brought it up, John, I have questions concerning your time in Afgha…"
Wait was that an actual tear forming?
John moaned loudly as his tongue battled with Sherlock's; there was no question that the moans had all come from John. But this time his moan drew a low, nearly subsonic rumble of need from his partner.
“As if you’d recognize my Aunt Prudence,” Sherlock scoffed.
And so it was Mycroft and not Sherlock who finally captured John's full attention.
And then John found himself caught in a solar flare; John was being burnt alive, because, 'OH MY GOD! He's touching me THERE. No one's touched me THERE in years...years, and years, and years...and I'm going to come right here, all over his expensive suit, unless I stop this. Oh God...I...should stop...him. Ohhhh.'
"Which I did for two hundred years, until Sherlock freed me from the curse," said John crossing his arms with a huff.
"Dabid Camewon...and Mycwoft Homes," said John. "She'wock, Ah weawy don't feel good. Can Ah pwease, go back to sweep?"
"He called me to the hunt with the horn like always," said John answering Mycroft first (which was hateful to Sherlock).
"She'wock? The shuga?" said John, his face suddenly only inches from Sherlock's.
"And the only name for this mission that anyone could come up with was Operation: John-Comes-To-His-Senses?" asked John.
John was one hour and fifty-six minutes late, and Sherlock fingers drummed on the table almost as if they were nervous.
John tried to spontaneously combust but only managed to achieve a brilliant crimson color.
"Who. Is. The. Prime. Minister?" asked Sherlock.
"I don't care. I don't..." muttered John in between kissing biting, sucking. 'I don't care if I ever breathe again. I don't care if I DIE from kissing. biting. sucking..."
'This is ridiculous,' thought Sherlock, growling in frustration at his own indecisiveness.
John Watson felt rather than saw the consulting detective rush past like an express train. Looking up, he saw the express come to come to an abrupt stop, as if someone had pulled the emergency break. In slow motion, the train crashed into his chair, leaving his endless legs stretched out in front of him. His long fingered hands rose to his chin, no doubt praying to the god of endless cognition.
"Well obviously! I hate that house you live in, almost as much as you do," said Sherlock, foregoing his second to the last sanctioned smoke, in favor of kissing his boyfriend (soon to be husband...Although I should probably wait to tell him that we're getting married. The poor man is already confused over the obvious. Probably still high on endorphins and oxytocin and cortisol on top of the fact that he's an idiot. My beautiful,) Kissing. (handsome,) Snogging. (lovely idiot). More kissing.
“I don’t understand.”
Thank God. Even if the rest of the night involves John watching bad telly while Sherlock pokes at body parts, it would still be better than going back to an empty house.
John and Sherlock maintained eye contact for a few moments longer than strictly platonic friends probably should. He was sure they were both thinking about the new information they have both learned about each other.
Sherlock’s cheeks are warm and he’s feeling a bit lightheaded (in a pleasant way), but his mind is still firing at full speed. Wait. Is that how the saying goes? Or is it… firing on all cylinders? Something like that. Anyway. Doesn’t matter. Brain’s in tip-top shape. Still smarter than these bozos. Sherlock chuckles at the thought and takes a sip from the glass of scotch John just deposited in his hand mere minutes ago, licking a drop that managed to run down his lip.
“And sex doesn’t alarm you?”
Obvious. John intends to take this opportunity to abandon responsibility for the evening and behave as a free man, no doubt an attempt to regain the sense of individuality he has lost in his role as dad. Sherlock can see the appeal, but it’s not going to end well. John’s tolerance has been reduced since becoming a father and he will consume more than he should. Alcohol lowers inhibitions and John is easily embarrassed. He will certainly wake up feeling ill and ashamed. No, no, this will be disastrous. Best to talk him out of it, or at very least monitor his volume and –
Sherlock smiles and fires back a message.
He can tell they’re both holding on by a thread, trying not to completely lose it right away. Sherlock bites back a sob as John pushes in until he’s fully seated. John stops and lets Sherlock adjust to the sensation.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock smiles, and then turns over to curl into John and kiss him tenderly, trying to convey the love he feels with the caress of his lips. After a minute of delicious snogging, Sherlock can’t help but ask, “Did you mean it? What you said, during…”
John moans and begins thrusting with enthusiasm. “
John leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees. “When I said every capacity, I meant it. I want everything.”
“I can’t believe it took Irene Adler, weed, and whiskey to get here.”
Sherlock sat up straight and began absently plucking the violin in his lap. “Tea.”
“Just the night. I’ll be gone in the morning.”
Sherlock let out a moan and at that, John had to start thinking of things to cool him down.
Sherlock grinned and looked seductively at John. “Enjoy the show, Captain?”
John wondered the same thing more than he’d care to admit. Sherlock’s love life had always been a mystery to him – even more so now that he knows that Sherlock was never romantically involved with Irene.
John headed upstairs in search of the beret, finding the box tucked far back in the closet. Jesus, he forgot how much stuff he had left in 221B. He brushed off some of the dust and quickly returned downstairs, wondering what Sherlock was going to have him do.
– just have to do it slower next time.” After a few more moments Sherlock pleads, “I need more, John.”
John began moving again and found that his feet were carrying him faster than before, with a prickle of jealousy he would never admit to. Who the hell would Sherlock have over? His heart rate picked up at the thought, but he dismissed the worrying quickly. Must be someone they know. Molly? Mrs. Hudson?
Sherlock and John spent God knows how long with Mrs. Hudson, drinking tea and shoveling biscuits into their mouths. Mrs. Hudson was probably talking the whole time, but John was mostly zoned out or sneaking peeks at Sherlock. Each time they made eye contact they started laughing and had to look away again to regain their composure. John and Sherlock have gotten into lots of ridiculous situations, but this was turning out to be one for the books.
“Once I began taking cases, the work became my top priority. The needs of my body became unimportant. I still have impulses, of course, I
“I was never exclusive; never had a long-term partner. People are idiots and, even then, I didn’t care to waste my time with most of them. While many of my experiences were satisfactory, there are some I’d like to forget. I’m extremely fortunate that protection was always used – I’m clean – however, it wasn’t always nice and there were times that my consent was questionable, at best. Some of the men were rough with me, but I suppose I’ve always been one to push my limits.”
“I’ve been in hiding, but it’s been awfully boring, as I’m sure you understand – living in the suburbs and all.” John was pretty sure his eye started twitching. “I needed some fun.”
“I’m afraid I must insist, John. I will not rest until this mystery is solved.”
your area of expertise.”
“So how long are you, uh, staying?”
I hope you do – but not tonight.” John stopped once he was practically touching Sherlock, faces just inches apart. “Tonight, we’re going to go back into your bedroom and fall asleep next to each other. And when you wake up in the morning with my body pressed against you, you’re going to tell me if you still want me. And I should probably warn you,” John began running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, “that you really got me keyed up tonight, so I’m going to rock hard in the morning.”
“Fine. But I’m gonna need a few stiff drinks if I have to put up with both of you all night.”
Irene looked at Sherlock and then back to John. “Ooh, yes, I think Sherlock will look remarkably good in this.”
Sherlock woke with a feeling of apprehension. He could tell from the light peering through his bedroom window that it was late afternoon, which meant the annual Christmas party at 221B was in just a few hours. He had spent the last few days fretting over how events would play out, denying himself the sleep that he apparently needed, until his body failed him in his efforts to stay awake.
Sherlock let out a breath of smoke through the window and turned back to John. “I believe you have something to ask Irene,
They fumbled their way downstairs and knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door, giggling the whole way. Mrs. Hudson opened the door and looked concerned at first, but then took a whiff and started chuckling. “Oh dear. You two must be hungry. Come in. I’ve got plenty of treats.”
“Not anymore, you’re not. In fact, I don’t suspect you’ll be stepping out of this flat for the next few days.”
“I’ll start,” Irene said with a mischievous smile, “We’ll go the right.” She turned to Sherlock and narrowed her eyes. “I want to be the one asking you questions. Let’s find out if that nickname of yours suits you.”
know John and has explicitly been told time and time again that John is not gay. No confirmed male-male relationships in his history. Nothing to back up that John may have bisexual tendencies.
“And don’t you forget it.”
“Then we’ll –
Sherlock feels blood rushing from his head and stands dumbfounded for a moment. He always made a habit of being covered with clothing (or at very least, a sheet) during the time John lived with him, so this was undoubtedly the most of Sherlock’s skin John has ever been exposed to. Even his incident in Buckingham Palace didn’t reveal as much.
He was just about to Baker Street when his mobile buzzed again.
“So here’s what’s going to happen.” John began prowling closer to Sherlock. “I’m not going to take anything from you. Not tonight. Another time, if you still want me to – and
It takes all of his willpower to stay seated and not running into John’s arms, but he can’t. Not yet. He needs more data.
John considers lying for a moment, Sherlock can see it and narrows his eyes at him, but then John seems to accept that he’s been caught and he lets his face fall into his hands. “Don’t make me say it, Sherlock.”
The next time he notices John glancing at him, Sherlock turns in his direction and for a split-second catches John’s eyes roaming over his body. When John meets Sherlock’s eyes, his face blushes and he quickly looks back at Mrs. Hudson, clearly attempting to catch up on what she was saying as he was preoccupied with staring at Sherlock.
John tenses for a split second, then tries to cover it up. “Like what?”
He leans forward and points at John. “
“If you
At that Sherlock lazily waved his hand in the air. “Please, John. Stay as long as you’d like. Don’t let this little devil scare you away.”
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock bellows as he emerges from his bedroom.
Sherlock knows that their relationship isn’t the highest item on John’s priority list and accepts that Rosie comes first. John is still living in the home he shared with Mary and recently began working part time at the clinic (insisting that he needs the money even though Sherlock has offered help financially) but spends the other days of the week working cases with Sherlock. John had asked Sherlock to help find a nanny for Rosie, knowing that he would be able to distinguish the good candidates from the bad, and with the assistance of Mycroft they had left no stone unturned in selecting the ideal caretaker for Rosie.
“Yes, well, that
“For how long?”
Sherlock set down the bottle and looked over at John. “I’m not as inexperienced as you might think.” He gave John a smug look before placing a hand on John’s thigh and bringing his head down towards John’s stomach. John looked up to the ceiling and took a few deep breaths.
He heard Irene begin counting down, “five, four, three, two…”
Irene looked at John from across the room and hummed appreciatively. “I love a man in uniform. So sexy. Sherlock, doesn’t John look sexy?”
He knew he would have to explain himself, but he didn’t expect Sherlock to change gears so quickly.
The admission felt like a stab to John’s gut. It was so painful he couldn’t help but laugh.
Sherlock didn’t say a word, but he let his eyes roam down John’s body and then back up to lock eyes with him. He held John’s gaze as he slowly brought the cigarette to his perfectly shaped mouth. The look was heated and John was sure it was as close to a “yes” as he could ever expect to get from Sherlock Holmes.
They stumble toward the bedroom, never breaking apart, and John nudges Sherlock down onto the bed. He climbs on top of Sherlock and pulls his shirt and vest off. Sherlock sighs at the sight of John’s naked chest, reaching out and letting his fingers roam up his stomach, brushing lightly over his scar, and stopping to caress his nipples. John moans and rolls his head back. After a moment, John closes the distance and moves his mouth across Sherlock’s jaw and down his throat as he begins unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt. “You’re a menace, you know that?”
John turned to Irene, who was fiddling with her dressing gown, giving John an idea.
Sherlock scoffed. “Really?
John doesn’t even hesitate this time. “Any way I can have you.”
John Watson has developed an earth-shattering desire for?
“I can’t,” Sherlock pouted. “It’s too much work.”
John looked down at the floor. “Turns out, he wouldn’t be the only man I’d feel attracted to. So, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m mostly straight,” John risked a glance at Sherlock and found his icy blue eyes piercing into him, “but with a few exceptions.”
The uncertainty is hateful.
. It was all he could do to avoid moaning. His body was tingling, and he suddenly felt light headed.
He rubbed his hands over his eyes and chuckled. “Christ, so we’ve both been in love with each other all this time?”
“On the contrary. You mystify me.”
Sherlock forgets about the bee book, letting Rosie take over, and steeples his fingers under his chin, shifting his focus entirely to John Watson. He was embarrassed when Sherlock caught him staring just now. Why?
Just then, Gavin and Molly stand up and walk toward their coats. “We’d better be off,” Lestrade announces. “I’ve gotta work tomorrow and if I stay any longer I’m on the fast track to nursing a headache in the morning.”
“The rules are easy, Sherlock,” Irene said, as she lazily pulled a chair over, “We take turns asking the person next to us ‘truth or dare.’ Pick a truth and you have to answer the question honestly. Pick dare, and, well, I think you get it.” She placed herself in between the men and sat down straddling the chair. Her gown ran up her thighs and John quickly looked away, trying to turn off the automatic urge to sneak a peek. He glanced at Sherlock to see what kind of reaction he had, but he seemed oblivious.
Lestrade, Molly and John are talking about… something – involves a celebrity (how pedestrian) – which is maddening because there are more important things to talk about. LIKE WHY JOHN IS ACTING SO STRANGELY. Hasn’t anyone else noticed??? He can’t be the only one. Anyone with two functioning eyeballs should have been able to pick up on it by now. And really, John is barely talking. He’s been zoned out most of the evening. Granted, the conversation has been dull, but usually John is better at faking interest.
John decided this was the night to find out. He spent too many goddam years filled with regret over what could have been. Things were already so unstable between them that he figured it would be worth the risk.
human, but I simply ignore them for as long as possible – much as I do with hunger or fatigue. I considered myself married to my work and the brain was the only thing that mattered. Everything else was just transport.”
John saw the heat leave Sherlock’s eyes and in a split second, the cold, untouchable version of Sherlock returned. “I see.” Sherlock got up and walked hastily to the kitchen.
of his mobile and pushes the covers away to reach over to his bedside table, flicking on the display to see that he had missed two calls from John and a text message.
Sherlock looked John up and down before biting his bottom lip and muttering, “I won’t say anything about that boring personal trainer with two poodles and a family at home. Did you know before the date that she was married?”
John closes his right hand over Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock’s entire body jerks at the shock of pleasure. He begins stroking slowly and soon enough Sherlock feels John’s left hand graze down Sherlock’s bollocks, against his perineum, and then begin kneading at Sherlock’s entrance. Sherlock moans as John begins pushing a finger inside, digging his nails into John’s knees.
“Sherlock, look at me.”
John growls and pounces back on Sherlock, sliding their bodies together and Sherlock gasps when their cocks touch.
John tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, chuckling. “Never again.”
“Quite the opposite, when it comes to you.”
John took a deep breath and made his way to the kitchen. Sherlock was standing facing the opposite wall, looking down and leaning against the countertop.
John grinned and let his hands run down Sherlock’s bare chest, desire coursing through his body. “I don’t know, at least a few hours.”
Sherlock hesitates for a moment but then crosses the room to sit in his chair across from John. They let silence fill the air for full two minutes as they stare at the fire and consume more scotch.
Sherlock just smiled in response and it was all John needed. He brought the joint to his lips and inhaled, feeling the smoke burn in his lungs. He just barely choked on the exhale, but it was enough to throw him into a fit of coughs. Sherlock chuckled and patted his back until the coughs subsided.
"Sherlock, Sherlock, listen to me--" Sherlock clearly does not want John to see his face so he stays behind him instead, but he speaks loudly, giving him no choice but to hear. "Sherlock. I know this all feels extremely overwhelming but you really, really need to slow down. Mycroft is gone and I'm not going anywhere, not unless you want me to, and Mycroft's
"Then I'll actually repay this one. As long as whatever you want is reasonable-- come on, Sherlock, you two are bored silly. Even John's bored, look at him!"
A bit of explanation: like the tags say, this'll be non-linear. The chapter titles will tell you how many months it's been, since Sherlock lost his voice (last chapter was month six, this chapter is month two). Everything is outlined so it will hopefully flow well and make sense, but just wanted to mention that, so you wouldn't be confused why the timeline seemed to jump!
Francis smiles again, undeterred. "It's a process, Scott. As I said, I'd actually be somewhat worried, if you had walked in here today completely back to your old self. I know you don't like it, but you're not going to find any magic trick, shortcut, or easy answer, to be the solution that you want." He breaks off for another moment, one finger stroking down the other, clearly still searching for stable ground. "Why were you so reluctant to tell John what happened?"
It's an obvious dismissal, and John couldn't be more grateful. He understands Greg needs to allow certain latitudes from her-- she
John doesn't complain.
He stops, furiously racking through his brain for the required sign, then just gives up and spells it out instead.
He wrenches in another breath, deep and shaking and stricken. He looks terrified; he's barely even
"Sherlock?" he calls, feeling a little useless and stupid. He's just
He loves this table. It's also a unquantified disaster that isn't serviceable for anything more than being decontaminated and set on fire. But it's still here. He died, and John hates this table because he hates to eat off what he calls a toxic waste dump, but John didn't get rid of it. It's still here.
Mycroft had snipped, and, well, there had gone whatever bits of peace there'd still been left in the flat. John made him eat, sit down and mechanically lift up bites of food and put them in his mouth, he made him go through it all at least
Whose bed was this anyway?
John glanced sideways at Sherlock to see a light blush creeping along his cheekbones. Catching up quickly, John forced a thoughtful expression onto his face. He nodded, “Yes, yes. Also, it would be… stupid to let all the muscle and coordination skills we trained
The transparent plastic shower curtain gave John a nearly undistorted view of Sherlock´s divine body, gloriously naked and glistening wet with pearly drops of water running down smooth marble skin, emphasizing all the ridges and sharp bony structures of a very lean but delicately defined torso. John stared, rapt and wondering what kind of benign god of fate had brought this ethereal creature into his bed to capture his heart in a storm of lust and want and adoration.
Time stood still for a moment. While Sherlock grunted, John screamed bloody murder at the culprit and nearly shot him into the head.
The pockets of Sherlock´s studded black leather jacket were empty and the knowledge that he had nothing left of the 7% solution made him feel queasy. He squirmed uneasily and caused John to stir on his chest, wrapping his arm tighter around Sherlock´s ribs in order to pull him closer. Sherlock immediately froze while a wave of guilt threatened to drown him.
He scratched at the squirming sensation under his skin, leaving raw tissue in his wake and some spots even started to bleed shallowly. He hated feeling like his. Damaged and broken and ready for everyone to come and tear him apart. Ripping out his heart and burning the miniscule fragments in the embers of a fire which had died long ago.
, could that lanky git Holmes do a graceful ballet-like spin in this orthopaedic abhorrence of footwear without breaking an ankle?
This lanky git was not only flexible and graceful but also strong as fuck!
“Are you crashing hard?”
behind Sherlock´s closed eyes. He felt his cock swelling and small beads of sweat formed on his forehead.
Another problem was that Sherlock had
“This is insulting, Chris.” John admonished.
“Hey John,” Chris mumbled and added a tad louder, “this is awkward.”
The audience just freaked out!
Sherlock found out that he really liked wearing a bodice and panties. He told John about that, blushing severely. John found it adorable and confessed he was fucking turned on by seeing Sherlock in these. Over the course of time Sherlock would amass several dozen sets. John would always choose the one his partner should wear.
Sherlock turned sideways and bent down. Deep down. His butt pointed upwards, with one hand supporting himself on the bathtub while his other groped unsuccessfully for the missing soap, making his bottom wriggle lasciviously. He grunted in much more than the effort should make him do.
“I will help you through the comedown, distract you.” A curt nod emphasized John´s resolve.
John liked them a lot though and secretly stole a pair. He put them up on the bison´s head in the flat, letting them dangle from the horns. The sight sent Sherlock into a delightful laughing fit.
your mobile!”
“Me too. Ergo, no need to be ashamed. Just let go and enjoy the game.” Switching back into his role, Sherlock exclaimed shocked “Doctor, the tip of my cock is getting more swollen still. Where would I find release?”
Yet, when Sherlock absent-mindedly started to scratch at his elbow right over the inflamed skin where the track marks were located, John could not help to slip out of his reverie and feel a pang of concern.
Where did he learn that? Was that something they taught in medical school, too?
“…going to…” sliding his mouth downwards to sink teeth into a delicate collarbone,
Probably?
There was no resistance encountered on its way inside. Pliant tissue, soft and so hot. Moreover, Sherlock´s hole seemingly sucked him right in as if there was a vacuum needed to be filled with
“Don´t stare like a creep, just come into the shower with me.” Sherlock´s voice was husky and John felt his cock twitching hard.
Sherlock shuddered but this time it was with subliminal fear. What was John going to do? Was he angry at Sherlock? Had he done something wrong? Why did John stop? Would it all end now?
“Fuuuuuuuuck,” Sherlock breathed.
“Like that, don´t you?” John whispered into Sherlock´s ear, sending hot shivers along his spine. When had John slid upwards to,
Without further ado, Sherlock stepped towards John and took off his partner´s golden cloak. “Here is my angel”, he said.
And that did it for John. All of his resolve to procrastinate further was thrown onto the blazing pile of his violently deceased restraint and John mounted Sherlock instantaneously. He grabbed the hipbones, anchoring Sherlock´s thin body firmly against his sturdy thighs and without further ado he shoved his cock right in up to the hilt.
“Tonight, John and I will perform a duo choreography on the pole. We should be costumed as a famous movie couple and since you are all bumbling morons (insulted protest ensued) we have a screenshot of the movie in question projected in the background so you´ll know who we represent.”
Suddenly Sherlock remembered more and he hated the way memory came back in these tiny bits and fragmented pieces for him to put them together, forming the events of how they, they, had had sex last night. He and… John. Right. JOHN!
Had now the moment arrived when John finally would be fed up with him?
His hands were shoved away and the grip around his throat vanished “You´re not allowed to come yet.” Sherlock´s vision cleared with oxygen returning. The beginning orgasm was pushed back, too. “John!” He whined. “How could you know…”
Who said those garments could only be worn for the show? Why not have some additional fun with fancy dressing at home as foreplay? Using these as a perk of the whole stupid bet affair?
John´s teasing brought up a lopsided smirk. “You have no idea what I´m capable of. Don´t complain later I did not warn you.”
Sherlock never actively remembered the men he had hooked up with. Another nameless, soulless body in the dark, sweaty and panting and treating Sherlock like the shit that he was. He never went back to have a second encounter. No one wanted him to. And Sherlock himself knew with certainty that he deserved nothing more than that.
“I won´t lie and not say I´d really wish you´d stop destroying yourself. If I could help you with sobering up, I will.”
“You won´t succeed to coerce me into not liking you.”
Sherlock shouted, “I´m NOT a jumper!” at Chris´ disappearing back.
John also felt the sharp spikes of the vertebrae, a strong reminder of Sherlock´s unhealthy skinniness. John knew Sherlock had reached withdrawal in the meantime and also knew that Sherlock would most likely shoot up as soon as he had left the flat.
As always, Sherlock covered up his insecurity with an air of obnoxiousness and, becoming quite catty, he snapped, “I´ve been too tired to go home last night. So, I´ve found myself another bed to sleep in when you kicked me out of yours.” He added a haughty sniff just to spite Chris. Leaving “and another man to sleep with, too” unsaid.
“I´m not easily likable,” Sherlock mumbled, “or likeable at all.”
Which made Sherlock confused, “What?”
How could Sherlock have deserved someone so intuitively brilliant at the bittersweet game of promise and denial? Of reward and punishment?
The sight was close to causing John a heart attack due to shock. To be fair, Sherlock had been actually suffering of shock symptoms himself because he had been expecting to feel a blade slicing his guts and bleeding out. Leaving John behind.
“Shut up.” John commanded and removed the finger. “You´ve no permission to speak.”
John also realized that he did very much like the feeling of the wings´ straps against his torso. Resulting in John amassing an impressive collection of leather harnesses adorned with various knick-knacks like metal rings, chains or studs. Sherlock did mind a lot. He always chose for John to wear a piece matching his bodice.
Falling seamlessly back into his dominant role, John continued. “Do you want to be owned?”
Chris shrugged, “I don´t give a shit.”
,” at this John waggled his eyebrows in an ultimately not subtle innuendo, “I´ll expect it to be hot.”
, a fellow chemistry student. They had danced in the “Tech Noir” and Sherlock had pounced on Chris like the always hungry sexual predator he was. Chris had been handsome and drunk and more than willing to let Sherlock be bottom in his bed.
“Oh, is that even possible?”
Sherlock had stopped the spinning and hooked his upper foot behind the pole. He planted the sole of his lower foot firmly onto the metal before he released both hands and extended his arms wide to the side. His body formed now a perfect “X” and was only held by the tensed toes of his upper foot.
on keeping your man more entertained then.” John opened his mouth to say… something but Mrs Hudson slyly winked at him “Also, I wanted the world to know how talented my boys are.”
John playfully shoved at Sherlock´s hip, bringing forth a mutinous squeal. “Just do it, you prick.”
Lost in thought, Sherlock hovered a bit, looking out of the window onto to the street in front of the house. He felt elated and the yearning for a next dose of cocaine had been thoroughly pushed into the background of his mind. John seemed to be the cure for his constant itch to be distracted.
Delighted, John clapped his hands. “Brilliant. Now shove your lazy arse into the shower and get the water running. I´ll fetch fresh towels and when I
Yet, the gods of fate must have been smiling down benevolently at Sherlock this day. Because the blade which would have caused at least a severe injury (if not a lethal one) only hit Sherlock´s magnifier which had been crammed into a pocket of the greatcoat. The knife slipped off the lens, shattering it but otherwise only damaged the fabric of the Belstaff.
“Is waking up beside you always like this?” Sherlock forced out between lips being sucked into John´s mouth.
“You´re close now,” Sherlock sent John a heated gaze under beautifully curved eyelashes, “so squeeze already!”
Sherlock carefully wriggled his torso a little bit so that he could angle his head. That way he got a better view of the man whose face was pressed flush against his bony chest without waking said man. He would rather indulge in the unusual feeling of being
The gym situated closest to NSY´s registered an inexplicable onslaught of new members after Christmas. Even more strange, several of the newbies asked for the availability of a pole to train on.
“Or I´ll not let you
A delicate smile tugged Sherlock´s mouth upwards when he contemplated the truly baffling fact that John still had wanted him around, had in fact been glad about his lingering presence. After all of the attitude he had shown, his unabashed sluttiness and wanton lust John had still not become sick of him and kicked him out.
“Then get your dirty fingers off me, lewd slut.” This time John pushed Sherlock away until his back hit the cool tiles on the back wall of the shower cabin. The sudden contact and difference in temperature made Sherlock hiss. John grabbed Sherlock´s throat, holding him tight and keeping him against the wall but without strangulating his breathing. Feeling helpless and at John´s mercy, being just a second away from getting cut off the vital air if John wanted to brought Sherlock onto another level of heady arousal. Adrenaline rushed into his bloodstream and his cock bobbed hopefully, searching for friction, yearning for touch.
“Well, it worked out fine, didn´t it? Also, it was actually “the soap flew away”. Quite innovative, I suppose.”
Sherlock really knew how to make him randy. As if he had not been horny as fuck already before. John grunted when a heavy shudder coursed through him. He shivered, not only because he was getting cold having stepped back out the warm spray seemingly ages ago but also with the desire flooding him to
Sherlock obliged eagerly and a finger was pushed into his mouth, rubbing firmly on his tongue.
Sherlock nodded more eagerly this time.
The cheeky bodice-panty
“You did not. Captain.” Jesus, John was a natural at the domination game.
“I´m dating you this evening. Dinner?”
John ducked through below Sherlock´s leg, leant his back against the pole and grabbed it both-handed above his head. With an enormous effort John pulled his body upwards in a deadlift until his body formed a perfect 90° angle to the pole and was parallel to the ground. He turned his head to look at the gaping audience and winked.
“Actually, Harry has Rosie all weekend, so I’m free for the next few days. But if you two want some alone time…”
“No.”
“I know, and I appreciate that – more than I can say – but it doesn’t magically take the guilt away. So I’m not in a hurry to feel any more guilt when it comes to you, Sherlock. We’ve been smoking and drinking and your consent is muddled, and mine is too. And as much as I know this is what I want and I didn’t think I’d ever get this chance, I want to be fully present and remember every second of my first time with you. And I want that for you, too. If we’ve waited this long, we can certainly wait one more night.
“Tell me what’s going on, John.”
Irene roll her eyes. “Oh for the love of – look, I didn’t come here just to watch two men fall asleep together on the sofa together. At least not fully clothed. C’mon, let’s
John stopped in his tracks. Who else would be there with him?
Sherlock rests his elbow on the chair and props his chin onto his hand, letting his fingers trail lazily over his lips as he’s lost in thought. That’s when he notices John looking at his mouth and fingers and he sees John swallow hard.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open and he grabbed John’s hand, pulling him towards the bedroom. “Then we need to fall asleep as quickly as possible.”
When they were done, they all settled further into the couch, John surrounded on each side by Sherlock and Irene, and they seemed to let a few minutes (or an hour, who knows) tick by while simply feeling the sensations running through their bodies. John’s mind was slowed down to a blissful state and he started thinking about the fact that they had all just smoked pot together, which made John start giggling. Then his laughter made Sherlock start laughing, and then Irene joined in and they were all just laughing at each other. He’s too old to be acting like this, he thought, but it did feel pretty great. He needed this. He needed to loosen up a bit.
“And what about you, John? Are you planning to stay the night?” He was sure she asked the question with as much innuendo as possible, but he tried his best to ignore it.
“But Sherlock,” he continued, “I thought you said-“
Sherlock uncovers his face and despite the heady sensations, gives John his
Sherlock rolled off the sofa and they started heading towards the stairs. Irene waved them away. “Good Lord, your poor landlady… I’ll wait here. Don’t be too long!”
“This might not last long,” John rasps after a few minutes, removing his hand from around Sherlock’s cock to pull Sherlock’s hand off of his before returning to stroke Sherlock again.
Mycroft is still an idiot and Sherlock feels slightly bitter about the manipulation Mycroft put him through over the years, but if he’s really being honest with himself, he knows that Mycroft was trying to protect him and their family. His brother went about it completely the wrong way, as ever, but what can you do.
Besides, John’s always had a hard time saying no to this man.
“I said I
He looked past Sherlock at Irene, who was currently running her tongue against the rolling paper of a fresh joint and locking eyes with John. “Or, you could join us.” When she was done, she swayed over to John and whispered, “What do you say, Doctor? Care to have a little fun?”
“Oh my god, yes, that’s brilliant, Sherlock.”
Just then, Sherlock hears the
, John remembered.
. Sherlock reaches to his bedside table and grabs the lube and a condom from the drawer. They’re rutting against each other in a frenzy and the feeling is exquisite. Sherlock needs more. He tears open the packaging and John takes the condom, rolling the latex on as he moves down to lick at Sherlock’s nipple. Sherlock throws his arm over his eyes and moans loudly. He feels John smile into Sherlock’s skin. “That’s it. Let me hear you.” John bites down and Sherlock moans again, groping for the bottle of lube and flipping the cap open, dousing John’s hand.
Jesus, no wonder the man has so much pent up energy, John thought. He’s probably in a constant state of sexual frustration.
When they sat back down, Irene was grinning so wide she looked positively wicked. “Well that was fun, wasn’t it?” She started fanning herself with her hand. “It certainly met my expectations.”
John bites his bottom lip. “In every capacity.”
John pulled off the jumper as he moved across the room and laid down on the sofa, pulling his shirt up above his stomach. “I’ve taken lots of body shots, but can’t say I’ve ever given one.” John rested his hands behind his head and watched as Sherlock took the cap off the bottle and leaned closer.
John was suddenly feeling very out of place, so he stood up and said, “Yeah, you know what, I’d better leave you-“
In that moment John realized how dry his mouth was. Tea sounded perfect. He got up and made his way to the kitchen.
“Okay Sherlock,” he said, standing up. “Where do you want me?”
Just then he hears footsteps on the other side of the wall. Not Mrs. Hudson’s. John’s? (How long had he been in the shower?) With a knock on the door, John shouts, “Sherlock, you’re not still in bed are you?”
