Molly glanced at him, seeming rather shy. It appeared neither had expected to be left alone so abruptly.
He heads off, and Sherlock grapples with a strange combination of anxiety and relief as he watches him go.
“Let me start over,” John said, more gently this time. He took a breath and then launched into speech again. “Sherlock, you didn’t ask for Sebastian to do this. I know I got really angry at you the other day, but… I don’t know, I realized that was wrong. You didn’t want him to threaten you.”
They parted far enough to look into one another’s eyes, and in Sherlock’s, John found burning desire, a low flame slowly being stoked to an inferno with every instant, every touch.
“She need not be so eager. I would not send her away because she cannot do her duties at this time.”
“Thank you,” he murmurs, and John grins and moves in to kiss him. When he pulls back, he leans down to pick up his bag, then steps close again and grabs Sherlock hand.
“Hello, pet,” she said without looking up. John frowned at her word choice. It seemed rather fond, perhaps intimate, especially for a lieutenant addressing the captain. “What do you need?”
Fighting broke out all across the deck, and John was buffeted to the side. His hip slammed into the railing, and he crumpled once again. As he gripped the wood to steady himself, he caught sight of someone he never thought he would see again.
Greg understood she was not referring to notes on the actual subject, but on Watson's behaviour. He nodded, and she and Mike departed.
must be destroyed. We will destroy them, but we cannot do so with their cannons operational. Thus, they need to be sabotaged. I have the ability-”
“Well, tell me!” John swats at his arm lightly, making Sherlock giggle. He reaches out and catches John’s hand, squeezing it.
That evening, after the ropes had been untangled, a torn sail had been repaired, and the sun had retreated to the edge of the world, John leaned on the mast that had been his only friend the whole day. He had eaten, keeping to himself the entire meal, even as the crew of the
“But you didn’t have vital information about me,” Sherlock insists. “I’m so much worse than what you’ve seen.”
John staggered to the side, hand flying to his hip, though he had no weapon. A man appeared, having been standing in a side street. John stiffened.
That was a definite improvement. The breeze no longer pressed the sticky cloth to him, but instead cooled his skin. He sighed and swept his damp fringe back, then turned back to Sherlock.
Sherlock bowed in an almost playful manner, arms out to the sides. John watched, amused. Sherlock tilted his head up, body still bent in his bow, to meet John’s eyes.
“Like me, they have spies everywhere,” Sherlock said, waving a hand. “But it meant they discovered he joined the
He took a moment to scan the deck. The only men left on board now were prone, bleeding. John felt his heart crack at the sight.
1. Kitty and Adelbert are names borrowed from “The Adventure of the Illustrious Client”: Kitty Winter and Adelbert Gruner. However, they bear little resemblance to their canonical counterparts, beyond the fact that they don’t get along.
John cups Sherlock’s face. “I didn’t write to become famous. But… yeah, I do like that I’m being read.” His smile widens. “Of course, I’ve got all the fanbase I need right here, with you.”
"Hey," John said, dragging himself back to the present a few moments later. "How about some tea or coffee, or... I don't know, maybe hot cocoa?"
Sherlock lay still, listening to the sounds of John moving about the flat: he removed his coat and shoes, stumbled into the bathroom and rinsed up, then entered the bedroom on cat’s paws, obviously under the impression Sherlock was asleep. Not wanting to disabuse him of this idea - John learning otherwise would probably lead to questions about whether Sherlock was feeling alright or something - Sherlock remained still and breathed slow and deep.
Sherlock clambered in next to him, nuzzling into the crook of his neck. “Thank you for today. Even if it’s partly Irene’s fault.”
made forward movement difficult, but he dreaded the alternative of allowing himself to continue to scrape along the ship’s underside. The rope around his ankles seemed a vice, numbing his foot.
“Then what is it?” Sherlock demanded. His voice was sharp, but something in the brightness of his eyes and the tightness of his mouth betrayed the hurt he attempted to hide. “Talk to me, John. I have been waiting three years to speak with you again.”
By the time Molly reached the top of the stairs, she felt humiliatingly winded. Lucky for her, the corridor was deserted so no one witnessed her laboured inhales. Four flights of stairs should not be so taxing, and yet…
Moriarty grinned, the light and shadows on his face giving him a rather haunted, gaunt, sickly look. “Bravo, darling! You’re right, of course. I took up the mantle of head of the NOTP, and got this pretty ship to boot.” He spread his free arm out wide. “You assumed something terrible had happened to me, and isn’t that just so adorable?
Kicking to keep himself upright in the water, John tied the rope around his own waist, then extracted the man from the seaweed and driftwood bundle in which he had entangled himself. He dragged him out, grunting and gasping from exertion, and felt the man stir.
Sherlock felt as if, were he given the opportunity, he would be willing and eager to look at John Watson asleep in his bed for years. His eyes roved over the older boy’s handsome face, from his gold-blond hair sprinkled with honey tones to his oh-so-kissable lips and the light dusting of stubble on his chin.
John’s eyes widen. “You heard…?” He seems to have not realized Sherlock was within earshot while John was speaking with Ethan and his sister.
Lestrade sighed and took a long pull, then set the mug down with a thump. “We left India a while back, and everything seemed fine. But then we had a bad encounter with a bolt of lightning,” he rolled his eyes in typical casual Greg fashion, always downplaying his own sufferings. “So we had to make an unscheduled stop at the Cape to make repairs. Then we ended up staying a bit longer,” he added, a touch sheepish now, and John smirked. It seemed a bit of revelry—probably for making it that far alive—had been in order. Lestrade had a weakness for indulging his crew’s indulgences.
“Definitely not,” John shakes his head ruefully. “I scrapped that entire story, actually. Moved onto other things. In fact...” he muses. “That was the story I worked on before coming up with Sherrinford.”
He stared out at the city of Lisbon, fists clenched on the railing in front of him. Perhaps he was wrong in his estimation of Sherlock’s character. He had only been on the
Sherlock nodded. That had been one thing he’d been able to decide on definitively during John’s absence. He had to stop Sebastian and try to salvage this mess.
The elevator seemed to take ages, but it probably only seemed that way because John was irritated, he rationalized. He took a breath.
Before replying, John glances up and down Sherlock, who immediately looks down at himself too. Has he spilled something on his clothes or something? No. He couldn’t have; he had changed just before coming here, realizing he couldn’t very well go to a book signing wearing a ratty t-shirt and his oldest pair of jeans. So why is John looking at him like that…?
Sherlock bites his lip, but the action cannot fully disguise his smile. Encouraged, John continues. “Sherlock, er… I feel I should tell you. He offered me money to keep him informed of how you are,” John admits, shuffling his feet. He leaves out the rest, about Mycroft both admiring John’s loyalty and doubting his tendency to remain so. Sherlock seems upset enough without knowing that.
“I know,” he said instead. “If I weren’t already pretty sure about them, I’d be way more convinced by that.”
, gazing at him in surprise. He feels an unexpected surge of affection for this woman and moves to kiss her cheek; after all, without her and her book recommendations, he would never have met John.
John swallowed hard. Victor’s absence felt like an omen, though he could not decide why. There was something afoot here, something neither he nor Sherlock, nor indeed anyone else aboard the pirate ship, had foreseen.
“I can’t help it,” John added in a small voice, almost against his will. He studied Sherlock’s impassive face that he knew was only a mask for some kind of inner turmoil, and he felt that perhaps he meant that in more ways than what they were talking about.
John sighed sharply at the window. He sounded angrier now. Perhaps Sherlock had been mistaken in his assessment. “I tried to keep something of yours alive, goddammit,” John muttered. “Of course I could never do your insane genius justice,” he said, his head lowered. “But I thought it would be a shame if your method died with you, all right? I guess it became a habit.”
John couldn’t help it as he let out a scream of agony at the impact and white-hot pain pierced through him in a way he’d never felt before. In a matter of seconds a couple of Yarders had pulled the man off John who now lay writhing on the ground, fisting his left shoulder in a tight grip, his eyes clenched shut in a pained expression and teeth clenched so tightly together his jaw started aching. Sherlock was over him the second the man was removed, his eyes filled with worry, fear, anger, sadness and a mixture of many other emotions. His hands hovered over John’s form a few seconds, clearly afraid that any contact at this moment would only cause his lover even more hurt. In the end, he settled one of his hands behind John’s head in support and the other resting on top of John’s right hand where it still fisted his left shoulder forcefully, being very careful not to put any pressure on it.
This didn’t calm Sherlock at all. On the contrary, the detective almost leaped to his feet and started to pace in a tight circle. Something he usually only did when a case, in which time was of the essence, put him under extreme pressure. “I don’t understand.. Sam and Frodo have been best friends for centuries! How can this Gollum creature undo all that by just a few calculated, manipulative moves? Sam has his flaws sure, but..” Sherlock paused, a single tear making its way down one of his cheeks before continuing; “Sam and Frodo belong together, they work
Sherlock huffed; “Yes well.. It didn’t do him much good now did it? If only I.. No, no matter it will do him no good for me to wallow in what-if’s. Show me the video, I need to see it.” He said with renewed focus.
“Whatever happened love it’s alright, I’ll make everything alright again I promise. Just tell me what happened. Please tell me.” John whispered softly into the soft, brown curls and caressed the long back with his left hand. As he did this another thought hit him and he held Sherlock back out at arm length, looking him up and down worried.
“A minor setback merely John, but I can assure you I knew all along it was the lawyer that was the culprit.” The tall curly haired detective said confidently to the smaller man at his side, but with a small smile on his face.
“Is that so, you’ve got no idea how happy I am to hear that. A talent as great as his would have been a tragic waste if otherwise.” The conductor said with obvious joy.
. He isn’t a heartless machine that people can push around and hurt, assuming it doesn’t affect him. But John knew the truth.. He could see how Sherlock’s eyes would flash hurt and sadness whenever he had to take yet another insult or accusation straight to his face, but just as fast it would disappear behind the wall Sherlock had put between himself and the world. A wall only a chosen few had ever been allowed and able to breach and John being the first and only one that Sherlock no longer bothered to keep a wall between. Sherlock had allowed John access to his heart, allowed him to love him and love John back in return and John would make sure Sherlock would never forget how loved he was ever again.
Sally lead the way into the crime scene where Sherlock were already scrutinizing every surface of the room with his pocket magnifying glass. Several officers and forensics were busy working the scene and in the middle of the room, popped up in a sitting position in a big armchair, sat the body of Mrs. Chester. A cascade of dried blood ran down the front of her fine, pastel blue dress from a large gash in her throat.  Besides the body stood Greg, talking to a bloke John had never seen before. The man was very tall, John would guess 6.2 feet at least and had light brown, short and well-groomed hair. He started to make his was over to the two men to get an update from Greg and to greet the mystery man.
Sherlock bent down to help John up where he lay on his back, still slightly out of breath, but feeling more like himself again. It wasn’t until Sherlock helped him into a sitting position that he had to grit his teeth and clench his eyes shut when a sharp pain shot through the left side of his ribcage.
He should’ve been there. He should’ve prevented this all together, why hadn’t he noticed Sherlock missing from his side immediately? Could he ever forgive himself for letting this happen? All these thoughts raced through the doctor’s mind as he quickly stripped off his own jacket and draped it across Sherlock’s thin frame to shield him from the cold and once again hiding his alabaster skin from the view of the filth laying behind them. “Oh God, Sherlock what did he do to you?” John whispered sadly as he pulled his detective closer to him.
“I don’t care that you are bored Sherlock!! Boredom is not an excuse to start shooting the wall or keeping organs in the fridge!! I’m sick and tired of coming home after a long day of work to deal with these kinds of things I.. Arrg!!”  John threw his hands up in frustration only to slump down into his own chair and buried his face in his hands. The heart now left on the coffee table.
Anderson couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this happy. Sofia seemed genuinely interested in him. When he talked about his job ‘Oh a forensic how exciting! Tell me more.’, his hobbies ‘That’s really fascinating, maybe you could show me your collection some day?’, his travels ‘I’ve always wanted to see Venice, it sounds wonderful.’. As he sat and listened to Sofia’s story about her own trip to Barcelona he caught a quick glimpse of John at the other end of the bar. John flashed him a thumb up and lifted his new beer in salute. Anderson returned with a quick smile before returning his full attention to this beautiful and intriguing woman in front of him. All thoughts of his heartbreak over Sally were already fading. Part of him felt like he didn’t deserve a friend such as John Watson, especially since he’d never treated him or Sherlock as he should have. His bitterness and low self-esteem had made it hard for him to make connections to other people. But right now, he had a blooming sense of hope, that Sofia might be the one to change all that and he owed it all to John Watson.
“Oh,” Sherlock’s eyes dart between her and John. “Right. John, this is my lab partner, Molly Hooper. Molly, this is… John.” There is a brief hesitation before his name, and John wonders if Sherlock considered elaborating. He wonders what title he might have been given.
Sherlock fixes him with a stare that would have made anyone unused to him cower. “Why else do you think he was so short with me? And his body language when he interacted with you… Well, it was an elementary deduction, really.”
John gave him a curt nod back. “Good. After that though, we need to talk. About us,” he added in response to Sherlock’s nonplussed look. “You’ve lied to me for a month. So don’t bother pretending we’re okay while we work this case, okay?”
Sherlock pulled a slight grimace, and John felt his lip tug upward in a small smile. “Well, okay, maybe you’re not quite to
“Good,” Sherlock said. He sagged into John’s touch with a sigh. But then, an instant later, he stiffened again. “I… erm, I don’t know how to do any of this.”
If only he had been able to avoid convalescence of such a duration, then things might have felt less miserable. But he had thus far been unable to return to work on a Royal Navy ship due to his injured shoulder. Instead, he was forced to stay here, on solid ground. John had hated every minute of it.
“And what?” John prompted. He edged closer and knocked his shoulder against Sherlock’s. “Go on, tell me.”
“You know perfectly well we are making for Jakarta!” Sherlock snapped. “Now leave us be, Irene, unless the world is coming to an end!”
Yet when the harbor master, an old acquaintance of John’s, had sent his son for him this morning with reports of something he needed to see, John had leaped at the chance.
“Impromptu press conference,” Sherlock quipped. John felt, once again, like he wanted to throttle him. “Get us to the door,” Sherlock told the cabbie, who barked a short laugh and obliged.
That evening, the mood was tense in the Holmes household. John couldn’t help feeling a little gloomy after Sherlock’s hasty retreat earlier in the shed. Once again, he’d come so close, only to miss his chance again. The problem was that he wasn’t one hundred percent sure what he should do. He dithered between too close and too far away; he didn’t know which was more advisable – should he simply jump Sherlock, profess his undying love to him, snog him senseless and risk putting him off? Or should he give him more time, more space… and risk letting him drift away? Either way, it all felt wrong. Everything between them was off-kilter, unnatural, out of balance. This thing, this decision, stood between them like a massive wall, barring them from returning to some semblance of normalcy until it was resolved.
John said, thinking that of course, Sherlock must have said something, didn’t he? John was absolutely convinced that Sherlock had somehow, at some point, told him that he felt the same, so what was happening now?
Mary was fuming now. And Sherlock was convinced his train of thought was correct. However, just this once, John wasn’t so sure he was right. He sounded off his game.
That night, Sherlock slept. He wasn’t officially back alive yet, and Mycroft still hadn’t gotten back to him about the assassination attempt on John and Mary. No news from his sources on the street. And Mary hadn’t done anything yet that gave her away, so Sherlock kept her secret, for now. Seeing as there was no case to occupy his mind, Sherlock figured he could use the free time to actually catch up on sleep. He hadn’t gotten much during his time away, and – surprising as it was to himself – it was comforting to be back at Baker Street, in his own bed.
’, which she pointedly ignored. He dug into his briefcase and brought out a file. “Whilst I do enjoy the game of cat and mouse the two of us have going, I think on this one we ought to combine our efforts. Share our resources, such as they are.”
John rubbed his neck a little sheepishly as they strolled past more paintings. “It’s not that. It’s just… uh. Sherlock had a habit of… interrupting my dates,” he finally admitted.
Sherlock hummed. Their bodies brushed against one another in the cramped space, and John was at least reassured by the solid presence next to him. “Jesus,” John murmured, shaking his head. “Right. Daring escape, then?” He tried to carry on, adrenaline still coursing through his veins. His hands strained against the bindings.
Mary stumbled into him and they both went down, just by the edge of the small grove. Sherlock lay on his side, Mary almost in his arms, and he felt something warm and sticky on his hand, running down his arm. There was pain somewhere, but he didn’t immediately know how bad it was and what had happened. “Mary,” he whispered, and then the crunched footsteps came closer on the grass and he knew he had only one chance to get this right.
In all the excitement he had completely forgotten to think about the simplest fact: he was getting his life back. He had been dead for six months and evidently could still count as John’s
For all John could tell, New Scotland Yard was a maze. He cursed Sherlock’s long legs as he dashed up a flight of stairs and down a corridor, barely keeping the flying coat in sight. Sherlock and his unseen prey turned corners and barrelled through fire doors, upset the calm of random offices and dashed through meetings to the cries and complaints of a multitude of Met employees.
John looked back up, a smile tugging at his mouth. He cleared his throat again. “You know, I wasn’t fishing,” he met Sherlock’s eyes steadily. “But it sure is nice to hear you say these things. Thank you.”
Sherlock waited a moment before he spoke. “Yes,” he said. “You were under close surveillance for at least a month, probably longer.”
“Let’s give the fire door a try first, shall we?” Mary’s eyes widened a bit as he lifted his lock picks. He swiftly ducked across the alley. “Keep a lookout,” he whispered and went to work on the lock.
John swallowed again and felt a certain lightness invade his belly. This was the closest in days they’d come to actually discussing what had happened. He wondered how far Sherlock had played out the scene in his head.
Sherlock was focussing on the footsteps coming closer. Of course the only bloody guard they had patrolling would chose this moment to saunter by and ruin—well, whatever was happening right in this incredibly strange moment. Because John, for some insane reason, was threading their fingers together and his hand was warm and comforting and familiar and suddenly it was very difficult to focus on
“For once, they seem to have gotten it right,” Sherlock replied evenly. He was curiously aware of her way of putting things. Of course Moran had been an
But Sherlock was already on his way downstairs, not listening any more. He had to talk to Helen. After a small, rounded staircase, the cellar opened up into a well-proportioned laundry room, at the end of which was a closed door. In front of it sat the Labrador, looking as if he was guarding a treasury. Sherlock moved past him, and the dog sniffed him a little before it decided he posed no threat. Sherlock tried the handle, but it was locked. A startled gasp came from the other side.
She laughed a little. “You’re probably right.” She turned back to him. “So what did you want to know?”
He carefully stepped over towards the large dining table that Mycroft was using as an impromptu office for the night. There were no papers scattered on the polished dark wood surface. Mycroft was a much more orderly note keeper than he was. However, Sherlock quickly spotted what he was looking for: Mycroft’s laptop.
It may have been hours later when Mrs Hudson finally found him. She walked through the front door and hesitated only a moment. She took John upstairs, put away his groceries and made him some tea. It all passed in a bit of a blurry haze, and John was sure that he was meant to make polite conversation or at least thank her properly, but he was completely spent. She left at some point, and he just lay on the couch, his legs propped up and covered with a blanket, his tea growing on the sofa table. He stared at the ceiling and thought of nothing.
“What did you say to them?” Sherlock’s eyebrow quirked upwards and for once, he looked actually curious. It was simply too tempting.
“But then her sister said that the dog was gone and she’d assumed Caroline had taken it,” John continued to summarise. “So she was lying.”
Sherlock pulled in a sharp breath and took in as many details as he could. John was staring at his forehead with undisguised panic.
“Still... here,” John muttered, pulling a faint smile despite the throbbing in his arm. “Cold though.”
Sherlock, currently puttering around in his bedroom, sorting through boxes of his belongings left there by John. Boxes that had, it turned out, waited for him to come back.
“I neglected you,” John said softly as he came to a halt at the end of the bed. “And then I yelled at you for not talking to me. It’s not fair, I realized that last night. It’s just not fair to you…”
“Please,” Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “Your prose is much more polished, and your characters are scores better.”
“No, but he clearly adores you. I’ve never seen him look like that before, and I knew him when we were young and full of emotions. Back then, he always pushed them back, hid away from them in favor of logic. But with you, he lets them out. He seems… happy.”
“Cannot be a priority right now,” Sherlock cut him off. “Your survival is most important. Sentiment, you must understand, is a liability. A defect found in the losing side.”
They fell silent again, and Molly decided it was time to go. She was practically vibrating out of her own skin in excitement, anyway. So she darted down the hallway away from Watson's office, down the stairs, and out onto the pavement.
“Yes it is!” Sherlock bursts out. And something in his tone, in the look on his face, stops John from barking a reply. He can’t pinpoint exactly why, but he can tell Sherlock needs to keep talking. So he backs off, lets him sit there and breathe a moment, hopes he will break the silence before John feels compelled to do it.
John blinked at him a moment, countenance caught between something like pity and something like fury.
“I don’t know what you’ve heard of pirates,” the captain sighed. “But you appear to have an uninformed idea of how
“He saved your life,” she snapped. “It was his decision to stay back and help your crew. We could have given chase, but instead he ordered us to drop the longboats and fish you lot out of the water. So. Talk to him.”
John dozed for a while longer, but found he could not reach deep sleep again. He was too distracted by the soft stroking Sherlock had begun across his torso. Finally, as the sky was beginning to lighten, he rolled over again and faced the pirate.
He helped the boy clean off the wound again, then clapped his shoulder as he left, head bowed. Sherlock watched, tense.
The pirate’s eyebrow crept higher. “Believe me, I did not intend to have you aboard. Your men left you behind.”
With that, Sherlock spins on his heel and departs, leaving John alone with nothing but the women’s babbling and transparent flattery to occupy him.
“Agreed,” Molly said. “They’re both… different. Watson seems, I dunno, sadder. And Holmes is about ten times more willing to bite people’s heads off. He’s been awful in lab.”
, which had at last caught a favourable wind, were happy. John could almost see himself making a home here, thanks in no small part to the pirate who now occupied his bed and thoughts.
It is a testament to how much Sherlock cares about him that he actually sets the galley aside in favor of kissing John.
He swooped in for a kiss then, one that Sherlock quickly - and unexpectedly - took over without hesitation. John let out a soft moan as he was pressed back into the mound of pillows and had his mouth plundered by Sherlock's enterprising tongue.
romantic moment in the world, John realizes with a faint jolt that he cannot fathom anywhere he would rather be. He cannot remember a time he has felt this infatuated, especially after just a handful of dates. But when Sherlock had walked into that bookstore, it had felt like something special, something extraordinary. Right away, John had wanted to know him. Of course now, John mostly just wants to stand here and hold him close.
Irene dashed by. She called to him as she passed. “What are you doing up here, Watson? Get back below!” He just watched her go, unable to muster a reply.
“Just what you would suspect,” Sherlock’s head was lowered. “His reputation was more tattered than a sail after a storm. He spent a year in prison before a few sympathetic merchant friends lobbied to free him. But no one would work with him anymore. He had lost his livelihood, his social circle, his honour, all at once. It broke him. He was never the same. Only months after he returned home to us, he died.
So he tugs Sherlock close, kissing him. Sherlock returns it, and John laughs against his soft mouth as his boyfriend pushes the dressing gown off his shoulders.
He made his way down the steps and over to Sholto. The man glanced up and raised the bottle in greeting. John took it and swallowed a swig.
“The EIC likely will think I’m dead once our ship fails to arrive in port,” Victor was saying. “Which is rather inconvenient for what I’ve been trying to do. But on the other hand…” he smirked. “I managed to fake my death.”
Relief flooded through John, a balm and a shot of adrenaline all at once. “Yes,” he breathed, grasping at Sherlock’s hand. “Yes, of course. And I agree with you, there’s a lot to unpack together. And separately too. We can just… have fun, with this part of it, if you want.” He gestured between them, and Sherlock nodded even as he lifted an eyebrow at the mess on his stomach.
Sherlock considers for a moment, analyzing what he has personally seen of Moriarty, what John has told him, and what he can deduce from Kitty’s email. “Not enough data,” he says finally.
"Where did this come from?" Sherlock asked, trying to keep the pleading tone out of his voice. "We were having a perfectly good time earlier..."
John chuckles as they turn to head back in unison. “Yeah, I’m sure you could find something to occupy yourself.”
Sherlock freezes in place. His heart plummets into his stomach, and he swallows hard. This is it—he's lost his chance, he let himself get distracted by books too long. And now John will let this man flirt with him, and take
Besides, he had a feeling if he simply ignored this issue, Janine would never let it go. Well, since he appeared to be in this, at least for the time being, he was
Sherlock steps back, glancing around at John. Behind him stands a man, a few years older than John. He raises his eyebrows as he sees John.
“I’ve got all the help I need at the moment right here. If I haven’t worked it out by next week, I’ll send it to you. And I should have the full draft done by the deadline next month.” He winces inwardly as he says this; that promise likely will necessitate several sleepless nights in the coming weeks.
“Hmm. Very well, I’ll help, but only if you pipe down and let me read this.” And with that, Sherlock shifts away from John and opens the galley of
had seemed to come out of nowhere, but that was only an illusion. Somehow, the crew—or perhaps, Sherlock suspected, wonderful, brilliant John—had angled their travel path so they moved in on the
Wiggins nodded, and he dashed off. The other pirates on deck, now that the threat to Winter had been neutralized, seemed frozen with uncertainty. Only Sherlock moved. He slipped his arms under her limp form and lifted her, adjusting so her head was on his shoulder. Whispering soft reassurances to her, he disappeared below-decks once more.
Especially early on John had to fight a bit to make progress, had to claw with some desperation through Sherlock’s defenses. The detective was often still caustic and stubborn and kept his emotions at arm’s length out of fear. But John reminded himself constantly, trying hard to believe it, that change did not occur overnight.
“They are coming from the wrong direction.” Water droplets flew in all directions as Sherlock shook his head. “They needed to come from farther south. Ekene said there are reefs-”
“Good.” Her gaze was softer, until she fixed Sherlock with a half-concerned, half-stern look. “Eat,” she ordered. Once he took another bite, she strode from the room.
That evening, Sherlock leaps across the sofa when he hears the ping of the Skype alert. Grinning when he sees John’s name, he clicks the green button.
Sherlock sighed. Well, there was nothing he could do about that problem from here in bed. He struggled out from under the tangled sheets and crossed to the closet. In the midst of his rather mechanical dressing, however, his phone buzzed.
He looked down, finger tracing around and around the edge of the mug. “I know you’re probably going to reiterate that I should have told you,” he began, feeling a bit of anger seep in with the sadness. Good. It would help him say this. “I know you think this is my fault. But it’s not as if you’ve exactly been the perfect boyfriend lately.”
Sherlock rounds the corner, wearing striped pyjama pants and an old, inside-out t-shirt under a navy dressing gown. His still-damp hair sticks a bit to his forehead and the nape of his neck, and his curls are even wilder than usual. When he sees John, his expression softens. However, when he sees Mrs. Hudson, he rolls his eyes and huffs in amusement and exasperation.
Sherlock accepted it and looked it over curiously. “You brought me.. Nailpolish? Ehrm.. Thanks Molly, but I’m.. I’m not sure it’s something for me.” Sherlock offered.
Sherlock felt an immense relief wash over him and even managed a soft smile at his doctor. “You got to me in time then.” He simply declared.
“Thank you John.. I.. I really needed to hear that.” Sherlock mumbled tiredly into the warm chest in front of him.
The doctor asks annoyed, but happy that he finally seems to get Sherlock’s attention as the consulting detective finally looks up from the display of his phone.
Sherlock smiled. He may never admit it, but he loved it when John would bestow so many praises on him and John continued;
and placed his phone back in his pocket before practically diving for his coat and scarf. He was grateful for an opportunity to go on a case and at least make John spend the rest of the day with him instead of the goons at the gym. He
“Give it to me.” John demanded. Mycroft immediately handed over the weapon. John’s eyes had already adapted somewhat to the darkness and he quickly noted he was holding a small 0.380 caliber Glock 42 gun in hand. He then checked how many bullets the magazine held (6 bullets) and undid the safety. John took a firm hold on Mycroft’s shoulder, holding the expensive jacket tightly in his fist.
His right eye was swollen shut, a busted lip and a badly bruised left cheek. A dried steam of blood fell from his left temple down his face, presumably from when he was knocked out. His usual blazer was nowhere to be seen, but his dress shirt was ripped mostly opened, showing more severe bruises on his upper torso as well as a few cigarettes burns near his right shoulder.
Thank you so much once again – and I hope this fic will bring a smile and joy to its’ future readers! :)
Sherlock eyed her a few seconds before he too pulled off his Belstaff coat and placed it on top of John’s form to shield him from the cold as much as possible.
John groaned. “Ah, you’re probably right Sally. Alright cheers and remember to give him a slap on the wrist from me, he knows I hate how he taste after he’s been smoking.” The doctor said, still not happy about Sherlock’s seemingly inability to quit the smokes completely, but he supposed it was preferable the git now only smoked when he’d had a couple of drinks and not on an everyday basis anymore.
Sherlock looked up at Lestrade. “I think that ambulance would be a splendid idea after all detective inspector.” He said curtly in an attempt to hide his worry for his doctor.
“Damn, I’m so sorry!” The doctor apologized as the quickly fished the offending device out of his pocket.
John laughed before gently taking his detective by the arm, forcing him to stand and started to make his way towards the front door.
"You're not normal Sherlock - you're amazing, brilliant, gorgeous and Unique. Don’t ever listen to them, they don’t know what they’re talking about.” John said determined and gently rubbed lover's tense back.
Also I couldn’t help myself but adding a tiny, tiny bit of subtext Mystrade, but it is very minor and not a big part of the story since I wanted it to focus on the relationship between Sherlock and Lestrade.
In a sudden fit of hopelessness John lashed out and smashed his left fit against the wall besides him, but immediately regretted it as it sent a piercing pain all the way up his arm and settled in his already throbbing shoulder.
Sherlock couldn't help smiling a little sad smile. This was so typical John, believing he was weak when it actually it the exact opposite.
45 minutes later all three occupants of 221 Bakerstreet sat together at Mrs. Hudson’s small dinnertable and enjoyed, what indeed was a lovely homecooked meal by Sherlock Holmes. They shared the rest of the wine while John and Sherlock caught Mrs. Hudson up on their latest cases. A round of laughter escaped them all as Sherlock described how a suspect had been caught by John when the man had actually slipped in a bananapeel during his escape.
The doctor had spent the last three weeks sheltered in 221B with little to no contact with the outside. Sherlock hadn’t even allowed him to do the shopping and Sherlock hated to do that. John had always been an active person and he felt like being held up for so long had slowly started to make him insane. So when Lestrade had called John earlier that day to hear how he was doing and inviting both John and Sherlock to join the division for drinks at a local bar a few block away from Bakerstreet, John had happily accepted, thrilled at the prospect of getting out and actually being able to socialise a bit.
Lestrade honestly didn’t know if John would listen to Sherlock. John was known in the entire Scotland Yard as being as patience as a saint and at the same time conveying such authority and bravery that he had rightfully earned an absolute level of admiration and respect from all the men in the department. John had endured war, injury and horrors far beyond what most men could even imagine and until now Lestrade and all others would have guessed the doctor was as good as unbreakable. But John had looked so wrecked and damaged when the DI had picked him up. In the end it hadn’t been the war, wound or terrors that had made the great John H. Watson crumble, but just a few spite words from Sherlock Holmes and that may just proof how much John valued the detective in his life. But God, Lestrade had never seen Sherlock look this helplessly sad and guilty. Sociopath his ass! Right now Lestrade was sure of one thing, which was that Sherlock Holmes loved John Watson and that John Watson loved Sherlock Holmes. A duo of two remarkable individuals that worked so much better together than either of them did alone. Lestrade nodded in understanding and patted his friend on the back in an attempt to reassure him a little. He sure as hell hoped this would work out for the better.
John finished the set with a final groan of power and placed the bar back on the hinges above his head. He sat up, grabbed his towel to dry off the sweat around his brow and neck and took a big swipe of his water bottle beside the bench. The doctor could already feel the workout endorphins starting to take over. He couldn’t help but feel a bit proud of himself for his progress these past few months as he could tell his intensive workout regime had already payed of in several areas. His stamina had already increased significantly (which would no doubt help him keeping up with Sherlock on their chases across London), but his strength and core training had definitely also paid off substantially. He’d been able to complete more and more repetitions and slowly adding more weight these past months, in all his daily exercises and by now the results were starting to show for real. His arms had gotten bigger and more toned, his chest had gotten more defined, his thighs and calves had become much tighter and hard with muscles and slowly but surely he’d finally been able to regain his six-pack like in army days. John had by no means any plans on starting up a bodybuilder lifestyle, but six months ago he’d looked himself over and not being very pleased with the sight. Of course it was only natural he’d lost a lot of muscle mass since being invalided home from service. He hadn’t been able to keep up a normal workout routine with his bad shoulder and limp like he had when he was still in the military. But since Sherlock had cured his limp and his shoulder finally seemed to have improved, with a lot of help from his physiotherapist and daily exercises, John couldn’t find any excuse not to get back into shape. Despite all his running around with Sherlock he’d gained quite a few extra pounds from their bad habit of ordering takeout. Unlike Sherlock John couldn’t just eat whatever he wanted without it showing. So John had set a goal to work himself into shape like in his military days, a goal he was now close to completing. He figured a few weeks further intensive training and it’d be like he’d never even been shot. Afterwards he’d of course have to keep up a regular training schedule to keep up his current physic, but with a healthy, well balanced diet and with the right programs he’d easily be able keep his visits to the gym two or three times a week tops and hopefully spend a little more time with his boyfriend. John knew he’d might overlooked Sherlock’s needs a bit much these past few months and he felt bad for doing so, but this had been something John needed to do for himself. He felt like the old John Watson again, confident with his own self-image and abilities, he’d missed that feeling and it felt great to have it back.
“A crack shot.” Sherlock’s voice tasted bitter on his own tongue. “As good as you, probably better with a rifle.” At that, he saw Mary’s eyes snap up to look at John in surprise. There was probably a lot she didn’t know about him.
“Sherlock,” Mary warned, and raised hers as well. Slowly but surely, the two of them were facing each other down, hands outstretched. Sherlock looked close to panicking, whereas Mary seemed rather collected. Her eyes flittered to John for a moment, and he hoped she could see what was going on and would help him defuse the situation.
By the time they reached Baker Street, John was pretty sure he had progressed beyond conscious thought and now consisted only of needs: get warm, get dry, be close to Sherlock. They shuffled along the pavement and stepped inside 221B, and John took a moment to let the warm comfort of home wash over him. They went up to their flat, John’s tiredness ever so gently evaporating the last of his defences. Once they were upstairs, Sherlock carefully closed the door and removed his coat and sodden jacket.
“When it comes to my firstborn’s shenanigans, I’ve learned not to ask.” Mr. Holmes pulled a rueful grimace. John immediately decided that he liked the man immensely.
Sherlock sighed. The jazz song came to a halt and the CD stopped playing. There was a shaky breath in the silence. “But why now,” Sherlock whispered, sounding miserable and worried.
“Well,” Sherlock bristled and put his tea down with more force than was necessary. He looked away. “You have been on six dates with Mary so far, and yet you still haven’t... It never usually takes you this long.”
John froze. Then, he slowly, deliberately stacked the last wood pieces. He brushed his hands off on his trousers and turned around, an indescribable expression on his face. He slowly came closer, almost as if he was being pulled. Sherlock felt a lump rise in his throat, his heart beat faster under his ribs. Suddenly he felt dizzy for entirely different reasons.
“No. Pretty much figured you out right away,” John said quietly, his eyes glancing up briefly, still smirking. “And you’re not selfish,” he added. Sherlock didn’t know how to respond to that, so he stuffed his hands in the pockets of his coat and they walked in silence for a bit.
And just like that, the seriousness of the moment was broken and Sherlock laughed. “You’re getting cocky. I don’t think soldiers are as accomplished dancers as you think they are.”
John groaned a little. He quickly assessed his options. He didn’t fancy slinking past a client, coming from Sherlock’s bedroom, looking as ruffled as he did in last night’s clothes – people already talked, didn’t they? He may not mind, but it was still a bit too much out of his comfort zone. Perhaps a shower was a better idea for the moment. John sneaked into the bathroom and was immediately assaulted by the smell of Sherlock having had a shower before him.
John found himself simply sitting to one side; Molly was perched on a stool next to him, watching, a stack of papers forgotten on her lap. At first, he wasn’t even thinking about it, he just
Mr Blanchard’s body was draped at an unnatural angle over one of the sofas. “Nobody touched anything,” Lestrade said as they came in. “We did preliminary evidence and DNA swipes, but so far there’s not much to be found.” He nodded to a single forensics team member who was carefully scratching a few fibres of the rug into a plastic bag, looking a little forlorn without the rest of the team.
Mary chuckled. “Physical qualities? You can be thankful you’re not interested in women, then, because one of us would have slapped you for that kind of remark eventually,” she muttered at him.
you for something… is he?” He had no idea what was in that file on Mary, he realised. She’d probably done some fairly off-the-records things. She’d probably killed a few people. But then again, so had John.
“I know,” she said, and finally opened the door properly. At once, she was covered by an armful of dog, Abby slobbering happily all over her face and wagging her tail. John gave a little laugh.
“Floor plans.” Sherlock swanned in with a decidedly smug air. “I did spend considerable time on those real estate websites, you know.”
and cold. He hummed a small sigh of content as a little of Sherlock’s body heat seeped into him. He noticed Sherlock was smiling, his face now quite close. John studied his pale eyes, dancing with the firelight.
, he thought, but then Sherlock’s hand wandered upwards and he threaded his fingers into John’s hair. “But you were here, and somehow you talked her out of it,” he commented, sounding pleased. “Jim Moriarty continues to underestimate John Watson.” Sherlock sounded incredibly proud at that, as if John was something he had that Moriarty didn’t. And John supposed, well, that was kind of the truth. He felt a pleasant flush creep into his cheeks at the praise, bringing him back to his senses a little.
, he shouldn’t presume he was allowed to touch Sherlock now. Come to think of it, he probably shouldn’t presume
“Hmmyes…” Mycroft drawled. “They did seem to be a little bit stuck at some point. I tried giving both of them a few hints in that direction, but they are very stubborn men.”
John eyed them with some trepidation, but there was nothing to it. He zipped up his jacket against the cold, put on his gloves and steadied the torch. He nodded once. Sherlock turned and they carefully made their way onwards.
The door fell heavily into its lock. For a moment, silence descended on them in the unlit hallway. John took a deep breath and leaned against the wall. After a moment, he saw that Sherlock was standing by the door, very still, almost like a statue in his heavy coat. John let his gaze fall to the ground again. Sherlock had retreated for his sake. He was always observant, yet usually, he didn’t act on it like this.
, not Mary, remember?” He flushed when he realised what he’d said. “I mean…” He stalled. His words came out all garbled. That wasn’t what he’d wanted to say at all, but his lips seemed to no longer obey him. He frowned, tried to sort out his thoughts, but then…
The late Mr Montgomery Blanchard lay in the small conservatory at the back of the house. Half the room was a tastefully furnished sitting room that opened up into a wall and curved roof of large windows. Outside, the spacious garden was tucked away for the winter, with a few busy birdhouses and tarpaulins covering assorted furniture.
“If he shows up, if there’s a case, then yes, I will solve it,” Sherlock interrupted, his eyes blazing intently, the mask forgotten.
"Get in," Mycroft snapped and Sherlock obliged him. This was no time to indulge in brotherly rivalries.
When he started to hail a cab, John grabbed his arm and pulled it back down. “Wait,” he suddenly sobered. “Are we—I mean, can we just go out like this now? People will see you! Isn’t this all still under wraps?” John looked around, eyeing the people in Baker Street suspiciously.
Sherlock Holmes was curled up on the bed and, for want of a better word, snuggling up to John Watson. His arm was draped casually over the doctor’s body, his head resting on his good shoulder. John had his arm around him and his fingers were resting lightly in Sherlock’s dark curls. They looked peaceful. Greg felt a sudden affection for his friends. Not so puzzling after all, he thought. He glanced at Mycroft, trying to gauge the man’s opinions on this development. “Bloody finally,” he said, always the blunt policeman.
“Yes,” John grinned. He decided the confused look on Sherlock’s face was more than enough reason not to mention the fact that he’d just stated the obvious.
, so it may have just been his normal, every-day disregard for personal boundaries? On the other hand…
“Yes,” John mumbled. “Well done.” His eyes started drooping closed. “You’d make a great... assistant.”
After a while the playing stopped. John opened his eyes – when had he closed them? – and watched Sherlock standing by the window, staring out into the street, watching the rain. John felt a pang of emotion, something tugging in his chest, something that made him want to go over there and wrap his arms around him to make sure he knew John was still there.
He looked back at Sherlock, who had shifted a fraction... but it was enough. Their faces were close, close enough to feel the faint breath tickling his skin. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, the long, dark lashes delicately resting on his cheekbones. A few messy curls stuck out everywhere, ruffled by sleep and... another image popped up in John’s head, of his own hands running repeatedly through Sherlock’s hair, trying to pull him closer...
What he didn’t expect was to hear the creaking of the stairs again. John stepped in and closed the door. Sherlock looked backwards and frowned; John (currently upside down in his vision) was carrying a spare pillow and blanket.
“No. You can’t.” John demonstratively, if a little clumsily, grabbed Sherlock’s hand and held on to it firmly. He saw a flicker of a smile on Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock cocked a half-smile and began peeling away John’s cardigan, which was soaked in water and blood. “I’ll make you a deal, doctor,” he rumbled quietly with a raised eyebrow. “You stay with me and I’ll buy you as many drinks as you like.”
. It was suddenly as natural as breathing to him (yet not half as boring). Now that Sherlock had acknowledged and identified what it was that plagued him, he knew that this was no simple matter to deal with. No, this was probably the hardest case he’d ever try to solve.
as you’d say. She thought she had to put on a spectacle for them I think. There was some resentment over her marrying my father, who was too
“No.” Mycroft’s eyes flickered for a moment to Sherlock. “He doesn’t. But we do have a theory. The timing is hardly a coincidence.”
Frederick twitched and looked hurt. He shook his head at Sherlock and tears began spilling down his cheeks again. They were clearly both out of their element.
And just when he thought he couldn’t take it anymore, Sherlock finally leaned in and pressed his lips to John’s. Relief flooded through him, like a man dying of thirst finally allowed a drink. John melted under Sherlock’s touch, his lips responding without conscious thought. Sherlock’s mouth was warm against him and he felt light-headed with the sensation of soft lips caressing his. He finally drew in a shaky breath through his nose, his senses filled with Sherlock. John’s hands wandered tentatively to Sherlock’s waist, slowly encircling his body and drawing him closer. The kiss began slowly, testing, learning, no inebriation diluting the experience this time. John felt as if his heart could burst.
He pushed his barely gained breath into his friend. He counted, then placed his hands in practised movements on Sherlock’s chest. Compress. Count. Breathe. The CPR and the surrounding smoke aggravated his own lightheadedness but he didn’t slow down. Finally, after a forever during which John’s mind went blank except for his movements, Sherlock suddenly sputtered and coughed. John sighed in relief and quickly rolled him to the side, allowing him to expell the excess water.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, but in the dark he could hardly make out his face. “Don’t count on it. He’d probably be mad and lock us up without a trial just to spite me.”
A sudden frustrated groan escaped his lips and he rubbed his hands over his face and rubbed them through his curls for what seemed the hundredth time that night. The image of John and him clung together underwater, sharing their breath, was seared into his brain, pushing away most other things. It was certainly the most intimate thing they’d ever done, and, come to think of it, the most intimate thing
Sherlock frowned. “What, when I got stabbed?” Oh, it hurt to talk. He winced, trying to clear his throat, and the man handed him a cup of water.
For the moment, though, John contented himself with kissing him. “Come on, you darling, daft thing. Rosie will be awake soon. How about some breakfast?”
Sherlock chuckles and acquiesces, returning to the bed. He pulls out his notebook and jots down a few thoughts while inhaling the scent of bacon and toast. Soon, John arrives with a tray bearing a plate of food and two cups of steaming tea. He hands it to Sherlock to hold, then climbs back into bed and props himself up on the headboard. Sherlock sits up cross-legged, facing John, and situates the tray between them.
He shifted forward. John tugged his shirt collar out of the way so Sherlock could gain access to the wound. The next few minutes passed in silence while Sherlock worked, pulling back the bandages, wiping off the wound, and retying everything. All the while, John wondered at the strangeness of the situation, at how he was allowing a pirate to touch his bare skin. He really should have insisted he do this himself, but somehow he had not thought to stop Sherlock.
The blush has returned, John notices when he looks back up. The man’s hands are dug deep into the pockets of his long coat, and he bites down on his lip.
laid anchor, and most of the crew filed off, faces showing their relief at arriving in one piece Several shook John’s hand or nodded to him; most, it seemed, were aware he would not be returning. Rumours spread quickly on a small ship.
Sherlock returned to consciousness slowly, sluggishly. Where was he? Why… why did his brain feel as if it were made of cotton and discomfort?
“Well, I’ve never met a landlady who pulls double duty taking care of a genius science student before,” he winks back. “He seems like the type to be a bit disorganized.”
“The nobles, who for so long had admired and respected my father, turned on him without question. I suspect money may have exchanged hands in some more extreme cases, but most believed the Programme without question. They are a persuasive group.”
“Several minutes at least. Major case just landed on his desk, so to speak. He’s being filled in now by the Chief Superintendent, I expect. Still, you’d better watch the door.”
“You are no such thing,” Sherlock says. “Your writing is strong, your characters well-formed, and your plots detailed.”
were healing well. Most of the gashes and cuts had faded, though the burn on his forearm was still bright and shiny. Molly and John had developed a salve, but the damage was deep; it would be several more weeks before the injury would heal fully. He no longer wore the headscarf, having lost it to the sea when Moriarty had thrown him overboard, and the pale scar on his head gleamed unobscured in the sunlight. However, John thought it might be fading. He hoped it would; sometimes he would catch Sherlock touching it and frowning. The scar needed to disappear, John thought, so every bit of Moriarty’s hold on Sherlock would be at last removed.
John had always favored the flintlock pistol, so it was the weapon he chose to carry at all times. The sword, on the other hand, he found more unwieldy, and he viewed combat with such weapons as too flowery. War should not be a dramatic, performative act, so why keep up the façade?
They broke apart after just a few seconds, though, and Sherlock grinned breathlessly down at John. “Come to bed,” he murmured.
Little did he know his day was just about to get worse as DI Dimmock walked towards him, a huge stack of files in his arms, that were unceremoniously dumped on his desk.
“Come on now, why would a gorgeous girl like you be sitting here all alone? You should come with me, I promise I’ll show you a good time.” John gave her a wide smile, but was careful not to touch her or get any closer. He didn’t want to make her more uneasy than necessary.
John shifted his gaze to sergeant Donovan who was pacing impatiently back and forth by the ledge of the sidewalk, isolated a good distance from the rest of the group. Her body language showing a mix of anger, sadness and frustration.  John felt for her. Donovan, as a coloured woman herself, had been affected by this case more than usual and no doubt more than was professionally recommended, but who could blame her.
Sherlock blinked a few times. John and he had been together, in the romantic sense of the word, for almost 4 months now and he was still amazed of how good John was at understanding his intensions and feelings without any explanations. Where others had always brushed him off as being rude and cold John met him with understanding and patience. He was truly lucky to have found such a great man as John Watson to share his life and love.
But John never allowed his stares or thoughts to linger for long. Sherlock was after all ‘married to his work’ and he wouldn’t risk the friendship they had built together. He knew Sherlock hardly ever opened up to people, as he had been burnt by other people’s betrayals so many times all throughout his youth and early adulthood. John still had to suppress the burning anger that always threatened to overcome him when he thought of all those horrible stories Sherlock had shared a night they’d both dived a little too deep into a shared whiskey bottle. John had learned that nearly all his life, Sherlock had been the victim of mockery because of his eccentric nature and people who’d used and manipulated him for his abilities and looks, only to discard him when he’d served his purpose. Sherlock had been like any other teenager in those days, desperate to fit in and willing to do whatever it took to be accepted. He’d given up so many pieces of himself until there was nothing left to give. This had been the cause that’d made Sherlock label himself as a sociopath and building up his walls of emotionlessness indifference to the rest of the world, never allowing anyone to get that close to him again.
Sherlock’s eyes were ablaze and filled with a mixture of emotions; sorrow, guilt, hurt, despair, determination.. Love? John had never seen Sherlock’s eyes so emotive ever before and couldn't bring himself to look away from them as Sherlock opened his mouth to speak once again.
Charlie grasped the steal pipe with both his hands once again. “They’re. Just. Like. The. Others. Fucking. WANKERS!” He grunted out harshly and punctuated each word by striking everything in reach with the pipe. He was gasping for his breath when he finished and frustrated tears had gathered in the boy’s eyes.
Sally’s stomach had twisted into a tighter and tighter knot as the boy talked, a horrible dread settling in the pit of her gut. She tried to keep her voice as steady as she asked her next question.
“Hmm, seems like this might take a while Robertson. We better get back to work and return later when she leans how to behave.” Jackson said with clear amusement in his voice.
“I know you don’t wanna go home mate but enough is enough. See, you’ve even lost your bloody jacket somewhere. Let’s see if we can’t find a cap for you.” Christian announced to the room and managed to pull his own jacket on while still keeping a firm grip on Sherlock, making it impossible to escape even if he could. He then wrapped one of Sherlock’s arms around his broad shoulders and half carried the detective towards the exit. Sherlock could do nothing more than moan soft complaints, but even in his drugged induced haze he knew it was no use. From every onlookers’ point of view, it looked like Christian was the noble, responsible friend helping his way too drunk mate home from the pup. No one would be coming to help him now…
Half an hour passed which Sherlock spent in front of the window, torturing his violin in an attempt to vent his frustrations. The brain in the fridge forgotten, there was no fun in dissecting a brain without John around, who’d spend the first ten minutes complaining about Sherlock’s need to carry out gory experiments in the kitchen where they prepare their food. Still, whenever it happened it usually ended with the doctor coming around and not being able to stop himself from grapping a scalpel to show Sherlock the correct dissecting methods. Sherlock couldn’t keep a small smile off this face as he thought back to a couple of those moments. This was just one of the many reasons John Watson was the perfect partner for Sherlock in every sense of the word. He couldn’t imagine anyone else ever putting up with his constant curiosity, need to learn new things and mood swings.
John went over to introduce himself and briefed the paramedics while they exanimated Daniel. “He’s been sick and started treatment with penicillin two days ago, which caused an anaphylactic shock. No history of any other allergies of receiving other kinds of antibiotics in the past. I injected him with an EpiPen with 0,15mg about four minutes ago. His reaction was immediate, his breathing evened fast and the swelling of his throat went down.”
“Hmmpf, it was child’s play, next time you have a case for me please make sure it’s actually worth my time.”
Sherlock’s brows frowned a bit and it made him look even sadder with unshed tears still in his eyes. John’s heart almost broke at the sight and he quickly closed the gap between them and held Sherlock tightly in his arms and pressed the detective’s head softly into his neck. That always seemed to have a calming effect on his lover. It had seemed like Sherlock had started a sentence just as he did this, but John didn’t catch it.
By now a number of people in the room, including Sherlock, Lestrade and Ethan seemed to have noticed John’s slightly strange behaviour as he chased the invisible.
At those words Charlie broke altogether and threw himself into the arms of his parents while sobbing joyfully; “Yes! Yes I want that!! Thank you, yes!!!”
"Hey love, you want some earl grey?" John called from the kitchen in greeting as he reached for the teabags.
Sherlock shrugged. “You can’t expect me to take an interest in everything I’m a genius at John, I’d have no time left for you then.” The detective answered with a wink.
“Yeah I know I’m all sweaty, sorry. Let me just take a quick shower in the changing room and we can be on our way.” John said, about to turn around to head for the shower, but before he could go Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
John’s eyes widened with the realisation. He hadn’t even noticed the onions until now. He looked down at the countertop with the book Sherlock and been engrossed in when he first entered. It was a cooking book.
John was sitting in his armchair, with his Union Jack pillow popped up and supporting his back while sipping a nice cuppa and enjoying the warmth emerging from the roaring fireplace. Outside the wind was howling, rattling the windows, the noise mixing with the soft drumming of rain that was falling steadily.
Right now though, John and Sherlock looked on worriedly as they stood standby in cover, with several other officers outside the old warehouse holding the DI. Both men had initially insisting on going along inside, but had reluctantly agreed not to in the end.
John looked up worriedly from his paper once again throwing a glance at the kitchen where Sherlock sat bent over his microscope, engaged in yet another of his experiments. He couldn’t help his brow from furrowing with concern as he heard Sherlock groan and rubbing his eyes fiercely for the fifth time in a span of only 15 minutes. Unable to ignore his growing concern, John softly folded his paper and rose from his seat in his chair and approached the kitchen.
Sherlock was released from the hospital in the evening into the care of John and with the promise he’d take it easy for a few days. Besides feeling a bit weak and faint from the whole ordeal he felt surprisingly okay. John had told him everything.. About how Charlie had handled the situation brilliantly when he’d first spotted Sherlock in the arms of that vile man and manged to get to Sally and the others in time to come to his aid. If it hadn’t been for that young boy Sherlock wouldn’t even dare to imagine what would have happened. He’d make sure to visit the boy some time in the next couple of days to thank him probably.
“Don’t tell me, there’s a case isn’t there. That’s the real reason we’re here. It’s okay Sherlock you could just have told me. You know I’ll always follow you.” John started a little disappointed that this wasn’t going to turn out as the date night he’d hoped for.
Lestrade jumped out of his patrol car and walked at a brisk pace towards Sherlock’s brother. “Give me a status Mycroft! Have you heard any additional gunshots being fired?” The DI asked.
Mycroft shuffled a bit on the spot before locking eyes with John once again, his eyes serious and portraying a great deal of protectiveness. “If you break my brother’s heart John Watson, no one will be able to pick the pieces back up. Sherlock has already suffered through more betrayals than most because of society’s judgement of his eccentric character and from people who used or manipulated him for his abilities.” Mycroft paused before continuing. “That’s the reason Sherlock build up his emotionless detachment to the rest of the world and labelled himself as a sociopath. He choose a life of loneliness and drugs to protect himself from ever being hurt like that again. That was until you came along. Sherlock’s walls have crumbled John and for some unexplainable reason decided you of all people are worth that risk.  If he were to suffer the same fate from you as he did back then.. It will surely be the end of my brother…” Mycroft finished grimly.
At the mention of Sherlock John immediately jumped off the man and scrambled to get to his lover who was laying a few feet away. Lestrade immediately took over John’s place and planted his own firm knee on the attacker’s chest making him moan out further in discomfort, but not earning any mercy from the DI. Sally had arrived too and had made her way directly to Sherlock and was currently supporting the detective’s head while she tried to get in contact by calling his name out, asking if he could hear her. She immediately gave up her spot for John when the doctor came running. John cradled Sherlock’s head gently and called out himself.
“Thanks, but don’t underestimate your own skills Sally. Without you and the Yard we wouldn’t be half as successful as we are.” He said in his honest opinion.
John wasted no time in sprinting past the young boy. He almost fell as he skidded slightly making the sharp turn into the dark alleyway. It didn’t take long as he ran down the narrow pathway that he could start to make out two figures at the end, huddled close against the wall. He slid to an abrupt halt, his breaths coming out in harsh puffs from running so hard. He squinted his eyes and ears as to try and make out what was going on in the darkness, willing his eyes to adjust to the gloom.
Sherlock grew a bit worried of his own at his lover’s sudden sorrow and silence. “What? Have we been on a case? Did I do something not good?” Sherlock asked hurriedly, afraid he might once again have done something to upset John.
The sound of sprinting footsteps was heard and the punishing pressure against the detective’s back eased for a brief moment as the faceless attacker was caught by surprise. Then suddenly the pressure disappeared altogether and the sound of two bodies colliding with high speed and force resounded in the darkness followed by a pained grunt, presumably coming from the attacker as he was brutally tackled to the ground.
“Yes,” Sherlock said after a beat. “This is… I never dreamed…” He swallowed, glancing down. “Well, perhaps I did
They share a laugh, and John is suddenly reminded of his own gran, nearly five years gone now. But Mrs. Hudson has the same kind manner undercut with a core of steel. Her obvious affection for Sherlock, not to mention her protective manner, sends relief through John. He is glad his boyfriend has had her to care for him.
The words were so unexpected, and John was so exhausted and relieved that he burst out laughing. He bundled the man up in his arms, feeling Sherlock chuckle in the embrace. “Sherlock,” John whispered as his laughter faded. “It’s alright, darling. It’s over.”
He glanced to the other side of the bed, where John slept on, unaware anything was wrong, blissfully oblivious of the fact that a vengeful drug dealer had them on his radar again. His arm was slung lazily across Sherlock’s waist, not gripping but more like a touch to assure himself, even in sleep, that Sherlock was still there.
Sherlock turned away and closed his eyes. His goal was so close to being in his grasp. He could not let it slip from his fingers now, not after all the years he had dedicated to tracking it down and getting revenge. His family had been torn apart because of the NOTP, and this breakthrough could mean ending them at last.
He slows his frantic pacing in favour of leaning against the windowpane, gazing out dejectedly at the sight of London before him. He wants to resent those he sees down on the street, how their lives cannot be as awful as his this evening. Those people down there on their phones or hurrying to catch buses or walking arm in arm with significant others… none of them have driven away the best man in their lives.
Instead of replying aloud, John stroked a hand down Sherlock’s back, feeling smooth warm skin beneath his fingers. Sherlock arched into the touch with a soft groan. He lifted his head, meeting John’s gaze, oceanic eyes framed by sleep-mussed black curls.
“John,” he gasped. His voice had somehow dropped an octave, vibrating right down to John’s very bones.
He barely resists the urge to jump and whips his gaze toward the window above him. Standing silhouetted by a light behind him is John, who has pushed back the curtain and is watching Sherlock with a grin on his face. He catches Sherlock’s eye and waves.
Sherlock shook himself. "Yes, sorry, I was just..." he smirked at John. "We should have done this ages ago.”
“Well,” Sherlock’s eyes glinted in that way they always did when he teased John. “I can’t exactly answer something that hasn’t been asked.”
Sherlock sat up, frowning. “... Breakfast?” He turned and eyed the clock; it was half past eight in the morning.
Wiggins quailed under his gaze. “Clean it off and keep it from getting dirty.” His gaze flicked between Sherlock to John and back. “I’m sorry, Cap, I-”
Sherlock inclined his head and fell silent, watching with an expectant expression. Reclining one hip on the railing, arms crossed, he looked comfortable, handsome. But John saw only a criminal, smug in his domain.
Sherlock tilts his head. His heart pounds, but he knows this is the right decision. A small step toward really, truly letting John in. “I am. I can’t promise the poetry is of high quality, but—”
Random observation I thought of while writing this… why are they called the high seas? Are there low seas? What does it mean??
Sherlock finishes reading, then looks up at John, who realizes he has been holding his breath. He lets it out as Sherlock beams at him, stands in a single swift motion, and leans over to peck John’s cheek.
“Then why?” Sherlock tilted his head, and John was absurdly reminded of an inquisitive puppy. This time, unable to stop himself, he kissed Sherlock’s forehead.
“Shush, I’ve got the list.” John skims it, and freezes. Sherlock sits bolt upright, apparently sensing his alarm, and takes the phone.
They end up huddled together under the awning, as the shower continues on. John moans as he takes the first bite of fish.
“Doubtful. I only left a letter with a trusted contact in the Cape three months ago. I felt it was valuable to remain 'dead' as long as possible lest the NOTP hear of my survival. However, I needed information from him. I do wish I had seen his reaction when he read it, though…”
all over now," he corrected, and when Sherlock opened an eye to peer up at him, he continued. "Lestrade called a while ago. Couldn't get hold of you because you were in your exam so he had to try me. Not that he was overly thrilled about that."
“At least for a while. I have a novel to finish reading, after all,” he says with a smirk and twinkling eyes.
A pause. Molly crawled across the floor, snatching up pens, pencils, and highlighters as slowly as she dared. She knew she shouldn't be listening to this, but she was so curious... she would leave in a few minutes. Yes, if in three... (actually five was a nicer number) five minutes they were still talking, she would leave. Even if they had not confirmed their relationship. Holmes’ visit to Watson's office alone was suspicious enough to confirm things for Molly.
