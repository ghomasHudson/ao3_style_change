Steve shrugs in response: “Yeah, I guess.”
“I hate you,” Tony says, and begins noisily eating his noodles. “Do you want some,” he asks, tone flat.
Steve gestures at them and Tony ducks his head and laughs. Steve can’t say what comes over him, but he can’t bear the thought of not looking at Tony now that he can, so he reaches over, cups Tony’s jaw, and pulls him into a kiss.
It takes a few minutes until Steve feels some semblance of normal, and he sinks down to the floor, cradles his head in his hands.
Steve scans the page, then finds where he left off. He clears his throat before he begins.
“That’s lovely,” Pepper says, sliding her toes from under Tony’s. “Maybe we can all grab dinner, if your schedule isn’t too full.”
Tony leans back into his chair and stretches his legs out under him, and continues to slide down the seat until his chest is flush against the table and he can comfortably scoop food into his mouth. Steve watches him, confused. “Are you trying to be gross on purpose?”
“Maybe I just wanted to be found.”
“If I do sleep then I’ll just feel even more tired when I wake up three hours from now,” Tony says, seriously making a case for sleeplessness.
“I just can’t, okay?” Tony covers his face with his hands again. “I can’t.”
The agent, back when he could talk, kept repeating:
In his chair, seated across from his wife, the President of the United States is weeping.
Steve starts up from his desk. “Hi,” he says with a bit of a quiver, and he hates himself for it, and he hates himself for hating himself for it. Everything’s so fucking messed up.
“But how about we cut through all the mistakes I made before—” Tony stops, considers his next words, then says: “Before where I am now. See? I QA’ed it for you. No more self-destructive behavior, how about that?”
Steve stops, runs a shaky hand through his hair. “It sounds awfully pigheaded of me to say these things out loud,” he says.
“I shouldn’t have to tell you this,” Tony says, and his shoulders, initially squared for a fight, sag. “But you don’t have to ask.”
Natasha sighs. It annoys Steve.
He flicks on his tablet and continues to read through the packet as he waits for Tony to fall asleep. Tony shifts around, trying to get comfortable, all while grumbling under his breath.
“I was trying to show you,” Tony’s voice shifts, becomes softer, gentler. “I wanted to show you how much I care,” he says. “I’m sorry if that didn’t come across.”
Steve feels annoyance flare in his stomach, but stays silent. He doesn’t know why the conversation has taken this turn. Tony was just talking to him kindly, which was admittedly strange but certainly not unwelcome, given that Steve is pretty sure there’s still a bullet hole healing somewhere near his stomach.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. He almost asks the man to sit, but remembers that he works here. “Thanks for the directions.”
It’s been two days since I’d snuck out of Steve’s apartment, gathering my clothes and getting dressed in the living room before tiptoeing out. We didn’t speak, after, didn’t text or anything.
“Thanks.” He feels Tony’s gaze on him.
He’s glad that of all the people in Salamanca, he’d asked Tony for directions.
Steve scratches the back of his neck, feeling incredibly shy. “Well, I don’t think it’ll happen again. Still, I’m sorry for being a bother.”
They sink back into quiet for a while, but the air is thick around them. Steve feels uncomfortable, but doesn’t know what to do about it, anxiety tying knots in his stomach. He doesn’t know why he feels the need to do anything about it.
The others agree to go ahead to the debrief, leaving Steve to aid Tony towards the workshop. Steve has a feeling that they’d planned it, which brings a small smile to his lips.
So he keeps his mouth shut. He doesn’t say thank you, doesn’t apologize. There’s no reason for either sentiment. They’re back where they started, and Steve is alive. Steve bites down on his tongue and doesn’t talk about how everything they’ve done has been worth nothing so far, about how he expected to have something other than smoke and mirrors. Stops himself from sneering:
“Well, someone’s impatient,” he says, voice rough. “I was a day away from breaking out of here.”
“Nice to meet you,” Steve says, grinning. “So what brings you to the gallery?”
Steve stifles a yawn and leans his hip against the counter. “You know,” he starts. Tony’s head tilts to his phone, which buzzes with a notification. Steve very gently lays his hand over it, making Tony look up at him. “You know, you don’t have to do everything.”
“I’m—maybe we shouldn’t be in this position if we’re going to talk like this,” Tony says, suddenly cautious.
“I mean,” Steve continues, as if Tony hasn’t said anything, because it’s easier to pretend he’s talking to a cardboard cut-out of Tony (the first of which he’d seen on a window display of a toy store, alongside the rest of the team. Steve had taken a photo and sent it to the group with the message “If the rest of the 21st century is like this then maybe we shouldn’t have stopped Loki.”). Steve shakes his head to clear it of these meanderings, focuses instead on imagining that none of this is real, because it makes it easier. “What I’m saying is, I think I’m in love with you,” Steve finishes lamely.
It’s thing like this that’re incomparable to anything else: to have Tony leaning against his chest, the both of them stoned enough to be happy but not too stoned to be stupid, licking a popsicle as the sun sets over the water, is one of the greatest moments in Steve’s life.
It’s another ungodly hour in the morning when Steve finds Tony working in the kitchen. When Tony sees him, he turns away and stifles a sniffle.
Tony cracks an eye open and grabs a fistful of Steve’s shirt. “Come,” he grumbles, tugging Steve down. Steve bites back a grin, and moves Tony around so there’s enough space for the both of them. Tony lifts his head, and Steve extends his arm, offering it up as a pillow.
Steve is silent as the words settle. He wants to vomit, lash out, or cry, or all of the above at the same time, wants to ask Tony why, and also wants to go back to the moment before he ever said anything.
“Tony,” Steve stands now, too, tries to reach out and touch Tony’s elbow, to disentangle Tony’s arms that have crossed over his chest on their own volition. “He’s my best friend. I’m worried about him. I just thought it was something I should do myself.”
“Sorry,” Tony says, sliding onto the seat opposite Steve and almost slamming his phone, face down, onto the table.
Steve lets out a small, wet laugh, self-conscious at the memory.
They’re about an hour away from the base when JARVIS says, “Captain Rogers, Agent Romanoff,” and Tony wakes up almost immediately at the sound of JARVIS’ voice. “There’s chatter about what the agents are referring to as ‘an asset.’”
They’re quiet, tonight. Tired, drunk, ready to lie down. They say nothing as they lean against each other and wait for the elevator to bring them up to Steve’s room.
Steve rolls his eyes and sighs. “For god’s sake, Tony. Come back inside and put your shoes on there.”
“Oh, no, that. Tell me about the suit!” Steve says, leaning forward. He’s never really learned much about it, other than the dossier he was handed all those months ago. Thankfully, this gets the conversation going: Tony talks about the latest upgrades, about aerodynamics, the repulsors. He lights up when he talks, and Steve can’t help grinning and nodding along as he listens. It’s a different side of Tony, and Steve can’t help but feel his heart swell, knowing that tonight, he’s seen two new parts of Tony.
Tony pouts, so Steve knows he’s won.
Steve gives him a small wave as he leaves, a tiny part of him reveling in the pain that registers at the movement.
“Okay,” Steve said. “I think I’ll join you.”
that, anyway? Steve takes a sip of his beer, enjoying the idea that he could be that kind of person, maybe. The kind who just jumped someone’s bones, didn’t worry what other people would think.
Now Steve and Thor are looking through after action reports, talking in muted tones and wondering aloud if there’s a possibility they’d missed something.
He shakes away the thought, finishes his meal, and leaves a large tip before the man can come back out again.
This is despite the fear that I was making it all up in my head, inventing intention where there was none. After all the romantic failures in my life, it seemed safer to accept that I couldn’t read Steve, even if it was
Steve wants to ask; how could Tony have pinpointed anything when Steve himself can’t figure out his emotions?
“No, I,” Steve shuts his notebook with an air of finality. Maybe later, he’ll try harder at writing out how he feels, and why. But for now: “I was heading out anyway. What’s up?”
“Is this a fight?”
Tony laughs, then moves so his head is once again on Steve’s lap, grinning up at him devilishly.
A pint of beer is placed in front of him and Steve looks up at the waiter, intent on saying thank you, and startles when he sees the man from earlier.
“Let’s just talk in the morning,” Tony says, almost at the door of the lab now. He hasn’t turned to look at Steve at all.
Fifth and final, draw a conclusion.
to have meant it. He’s not an idiot, after all. At least, not all the time.
Steve wakes up to an empty bed, but it’s still warm, so it wasn’t empty for too long. Steve opens his eyes to confirm, and they land immediately upon a familiar shock of dark hair far enough from him that Steve is treated to the sight of Tony’s muscular back, Steve’s blanket draped over his hips artfully.
“Excited?” Tony asks, smiling up at him.
“Hey, come on.” Someone is tugging his sleeve so Steve opens his eyes a bit, if only to inspect. “Wha?” he mumbles.
“I’m no good at this, you know,” Tony says, after a while. Steve looks at Tony, watches as Tony’s eyes track the movement of a plane making its way over the city.
“It is morning, but okay,” Steve says, and he tries not to sound too happy. Tony flops down onto the couch.
Steve’s desperately trying to get his thoughts in order, trying to figure out how to confess everything in a way that makes sense. Or at least in a way that will make Tony consider, in the same way Steve did when he first saw pictures of them together, that they’d be good together.
There are two quick knocks on his door, and then Steve hears footsteps leading away. Steve opens the door and finds his pencils and sketchbook placed neatly on the floor. It registers somewhere in the back of his mind that Tony had picked all of these things up and brought it over, but he doesn’t care, doesn’t want to.
Tony lifts his hand, rests it on Steve’s knee. “Come here.”
“Thanks,” he says.
“Is that all you remember?” Tony asks, turning a little in Steve’s embrace to meet his gaze.
“I’m open to negotiation,” Tony says.
“We have to look like we’re having a meaningful conversation,” Steve says, glancing around. By the door, Janet is watching them, evaluating.
Steve sucks in a breath, trying to steady himself against the desire curling in his belly. He thought he was past it, but seeing Tony again, in
Of course, these thoughts are all isolated to the moments before Steve descended upon the captain of the base.
“You’re sure you want this,” Tony says, finally settling in and pushing his nose against Steve’s chest.
“Tony,” Steve scolds gently.
Steve’s mouth works, and he looks genuinely shocked. “You said I could talk to JARVIS.”
“It’s okay,” Tony says, and Steve sees him begin to reach out, but stop. Steve feels an ache awaken in him, the want to be touched. But he can’t bear to ask, so he nods and continues.
Steve blushes again and looks away. “I
“Steve.” Tony sounds close to whining. He bites Steve’s lower lip, making Steve moan. “
“Yup,” Tony says, and okay. Maybe he needs to spend a day or two really figuring out who the problem is, here. (It’s him. He knows this. He’s always the problem.)
Tony’s frown shifts to a small smile of understanding. It’s heartening. Steve thinks it’s a good start.
Steve pulls him up to sit beside him, and Tony follows bonelessly. Steve swallows, feeling faint.
They're sitting on the balcony adjacent to the helipad again.
“Please repeat that, JARVIS,” Steve says, once everyone is fully alert.
“Hi,” Steve says, experimentally.
There are some days when the team just gravitates toward each other, not really seeking to do anything other than bask in each other’s company.
“It’s been five years, Tones,” Rhodey says, rubbing his shoulder. “Guess we figured you’d be over it.”
“Well maybe they’d be right!” Steve snaps, at the end of his rope. He’s never been comfortable with things like this, romance and dating and—and
“Don’t start,” Tony warns.
“My eyes are up here,” Tony teases, but his voice is softer, too.
Maybe they could just try and be friends. Like Rhodey said, it’s been five years. Besides, he’s probably married already anyway, or at least dating someone; it’s unfathomable that no one would snap him up.
“I—” Steve starts, stops. “That’s a good question,” he finishes, smiling sheepishly. He remembers the fight, the explosion, but that’s it. He didn’t even know about the water.
Message from the universe certainly received.
Steve bites his lip. This shouldn’t be a difficult question to answer, but everything he can think of sounds boring. “Well, what do you like to do?” Steve asks, instead.
Steve looks up from his food and cocks his head. “Fine. Working on a new painting.”
“That’s fair.”
Steve inches closer to him and rests his hand on Tony’s knee. Tony doesn’t open his eyes.
“And we hate him, yes?”
“I—I didn’t,” Steve says haltingly. “I wasn’t thinking. I just wanted to know if JARVIS could find him, but I knew it was almost impossible anyway, so there was no real point—”
Steve makes his way to his small kitchenette, sets out a pan, some eggs, and pulls meatloaf out of the cupboard. His brain continues to throb as he waits for the pan to heat up and for the oil to sizzle, and when he cracks open the egg to fry, he runs to the toilet, dry heaving from the smell.
okay and we bumped into him at an exhibit and Pepper made googly eyes at him and said we should all catch up over dinner.” Tony takes a deep breath after his tirade, then deflates. He sips on his whisky sullenly.
Steve huffs, rolls his eyes.
Steve bites his lip, turns back to look at Peter. “What can I say,” he says, honest for the first time in months. “He’s right.”
“So you’re coming?” Tony pushes himself off the door frame gracefully.
moment, maybe that way he’d have had some practice.
Steve laughs, feels his cheeks color. “Oh god, I didn’t,” he says, covering his face and laughing.
Tony looks up at him, eyes bright. “Okay, Steve.”
, which in itself feels like a failure, because Tony stark
“Thank you, Thor,” Steve says self-consciously, noticing how no one’s actually verbally expressed their gratitude. “This is a great gift.”
“Hey,” Steve rasps, his throat dry from a mix of arousal and disbelief.
It’s things like this, when it’s people that matter to him (and Steve had stared wide-eyed at his reflection as he realized this while brushing his teeth:
have anything else to wear, and he felt a little unhinged by virtue of his outfit: Steve’s hoodie and a pair of very old jorts, fraying at the hem.
It seems to punch the air out of Tony. “See?” Tony says, regrouping and brushing it off with a laugh. “He’s enamored.”
“Please don’t tell me you want to stop.”
“Just trust me, Steve, you’ll love it. I’ll even pay attention,” he smirks at Steve, “Which is more than what I was going to do for Gene Kelly.”
thing in the 60s,” Tony says, and then touches two fingers to Steve’s forehead, smoothing out his eyebrows. “And it’s supposed to be fun, too.” He smiles. Steve lets out a huff of laughter.
Tony blushes and tries to tug his hand away, but Steve tightens his grip, kisses the inside of Tony’s wrist, then up his arm. “What is it?”
Tony huffs out a laugh, his breath warm against Steve’s skin. “I know, I know.” Tony shifts a bit, presses a soft kiss against Steve’s neck. They hug in silence for what feels like forever, and Steve relishes every second of it.
It makes Steve feel young, the way he reminisces about the first film they’d shot together, all those years ago.
His lips curled into a small smile. “Good.”
“Yeah?” Bruce looks up just in time to see Steve scratch the back of his neck, looking vaguely embarrassed and a bit flushed. “I’d like that. If you’re not too busy.”
“This—this feelings conversation over breakfast.”
“I’m fine,” Tony says, taking another sip from his coffee. As he wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, Natasha flicks Tony’s forehead. “Go lie down,” she says.
Steve takes a deep breath, adjusts the settings to just far enough to span the Old City, and what he figures to be close enough to where the man lives. He can’t explain why he’s doing this, or what he hopes to achieve. He hopes he finds the man on the app, and if he does, by some miracle, then maybe it’ll be a blessing enough that they match. Besides, he’s leaving two days from now, has a plane ticket to Barcelona, and this feels like a last ditch effort of pleading with the universe.
Tony raises a hand to caress Steve’s face. “What do you mean, what do I want?” He laughs warily.
Tony pulls out a beach towel from his bag and lays it out before plopping down on it and cracking open the cooler.
, his brain supplies, continuously unhelpful.
, he tries again.
“Right,” Steve says, suddenly embarrassed. He tries to think of something else to say but his brain fails to supply anything else. He tries not to feel like this is already a disaster.
Tony remains slumped over the coffee machine, making a sad sound as it slowly whirs to life.
Tony raises his hand and traces the curve of Steve’s ear. “I want to be able to kiss you whenever I want,” he says, eyes following the movements of his hands. Steve stares, and stares, and stares, too dumbstruck to do anything else.
“J? Did you just
Steve rests his hands on his hips as he stands in front of his closet, looking at his options. Something casual? Something… not casual?
At that moment, I thought about how easy it would be to spoil it all, to kiss him and ruin the years of friendship between us. I didn’t know what I wanted. What I did know is that it felt good, and that was enough.
“Oh,” Tony says, looking shocked. “Thanks.”
“I’m going to go.”
“Yeah. He just doesn’t seem all that bad.” Pepper rests her head on Tony’s shoulder, and Rhodey playfully tugs on her ponytail after she speaks.
Steve holds the paper, then looks up at Tony, smiling a little.
“It’s four in the morning.”
Steve follows and leans against the marble counter as Tony presses some buttons on what Steve assumes to be the coffee machine. The rest of the kitchen is done in light wood and acrylic. It looks, in Steve’s opinion, too clean to be a kitchen.
Under the starlight, everything looks subdued and light, except for Tony’s eyes. The wind picks up and ruffles his hair. The waves crash against the shore, bearing witness as Steve kisses Tony.
Clint thinks to himself.
Steve frowns. “I mean, what do you want?”
“Says the man who was literally frozen in ice,” Tony smirks. “I think we’re way past the point of ever using that word anymore, Steve.”
He checks his phone. There’s one message from an unregistered number.
Tony opens his mouth and Steve’s entire body goes rigid with the visceral need not to be here, not to hear what Tony has to say, not anymore.
, and Pepper was going to get to the bottom of it.
Tony’s lying in bed, reading a report on his tablet, when Steve peeks in.
His fingers catch on something, and he pulls it out with a sigh of relief—only to yelp and drop the shirt when he sees it.
Steve gets up, walks to his room, and puts on some sunblock. The house feels so big, and he’s never been on a beach trip with just another person, and it’s—it’s a lot, maybe. In the car, earlier, it was easy, talking to Tony and teasing him by playing his music instead of Tony’s “beach trip playlist.” But now, here, Steve realizes that it’s so real all of the sudden, like something could happen at any moment. Wasn’t it just last week that they hated each other, wasn’t it just yesterday that they’d finally spoken properly?
It’s a surprise, to have Tony mention his father so casually. Steve takes it as an invitation for conversation and hopes he’s right.
Tony bites his lip, and Steve smiles up at him, beatific.
Steve feels the sharp stab of want in his belly, and he wishes he’d had the same resolve all those nights ago when Tony had pulled away. He wishes he’d told Tony he wouldn’t take no for an answer, and kept kissing him, and kissing him, and kissing him.
Who was I to say no? Kindness was always few and far between. Then again, I knew I was fooling myself; I wanted to be alone with him. It thrilled me that he’d wanted the same.
The realization dawns on Tony just as quickly; his laugh stops midway and he peers closer at Steve. “You’re kidding, right? I thought earlier—” Tony drags a hand across his face, clearly frustrated. “Steve,” he says, looking at Steve again.
Tony leans back against his chair. “FRI,” he says.
He’s about to nod off when Steve speaks. Thor cracks an eye open to look at Steve talking to Tony.
“Always a pleasure, Captain.”
Tony sags against him, letting out a deep breath. They fall into silence, again, and the next thing Steve knows he jolts awake because his head was falling forward.
The man huffs out a laugh, a look of surprise and relief on his face. “It’s you,” he says, and Steve feels his heart soar.
“Hello to you too, you overgrown labrador,” Tony laughs, pushing Steve away a little lest he be crushed under all combined weight of supersoldier and three bowls of pasta that Clint prepared for dinner.
It was a normal Tuesday between the two of them, stressed and under duress and Tony needing a drink. Tony had escaped his office to work with Steve, using the excuse that a change of scenery made him more productive.
, so normal after all the kisses they’d shared in the tower, that Steve doesn’t even register the noise from the reporters.
Steve tilts his head at Tony, waiting for him to speak. Instead, Tony shakes his head and laugh softly.
Tony crowds up against Steve, pressing their bodies together. “I made you feel like I didn’t want you,” he continues to whisper, and Steve’s having trouble focusing on the words, his mind short circuiting at the feel of Tony flush against him.
?” He asks.
Steve looks up at Tony. “Me too.”
Tony leans in and presses his lips against Steve’s, and Steve very nearly jumps back in surprise.
“You can go put on some sunblock if you’re so intent on activity,” Tony says, laughing as he rolls his eyes. “Honestly, chill.”
Steve laughs, stopping his attack and resting his forehead against Tony’s chest. They’re quiet for a moment, and Tony strokes the back of Steve’s hair.
I said, “What the fuck is going on,” because it was
Nothing about that night was different. Another battle, another debrief, another blasé invitation to unwind. Always, against my better judgment, I’d agreed: what about tonight could be different? Nothing, nothing at all.
It’s been years since Steve has felt this aware of his body, the size of it and the way he takes up space, and the way Tony, somehow, always finds space beside him.
He took my hands and pressed them against the bed, pinned my hips down with his. I would’ve been embarrassed by how hard I was, except he was, too, and I didn’t know what to do, but I knew, too, that I didn’t want it to stop. I didn’t want us to pretend, like all the other times, that this didn’t happen. It was happening. Something was happening and one of us was going to break.
—and reaches blindly for the first door he sees and throws himself inside.
“Fuck you, Stark.” The line clicks off.
Steve’s train of thought is interrupted by Tony moving to stand in front of him, sleeveless shirt in hand. “Something tells me this won’t fit you,” Tony says, holding it up against Steve’s chest.
Thor sits up a little straighter. “Indeed, Anthony,” he says. Tony stops in his tracks. “Even I, for all I’ve seen, am amazed at your abilities.”
“Wanna get a snack?” Tony asks. “It’s been a minute.”
No one brings up how Tony had to pull Steve away when he was dangerously close to smashing the agent’s face in, shouting in Spanish about the asset.
Tony doesn’t mind him as he gulps down his coffee. “We’re on vacation.”
I looked at him, then looked away. I couldn’t stomach it. With one look at him my fears were confirmed. Something was wrong, and I was on the losing end.
“What if you were right?”
“I don’t think I can do this,” Steve says, dumping his bowl into the sink and walking out the room.
He should have known better, really. Nothing about him, his work, his
of the thing.”
A little less than an hour later, Tony stands beside him, holding his phone. “Steve,” he says, his tone verging on laughter. “I think we really did break the internet this time.”
This isn’t how a hypothesis is meant to sound. Tony’s a terrible scientist.
“Too late, J has it on video now,” Tony grins.
“Why not, Tony?” Steve asks, and this is it, this is the culmination of every single fragile moment in Steve’s life.
“Tony?” Steve murmurs, sliding his hand up Tony’s side.
want?” he asks. He’s afraid for the answer, and honestly doesn’t know what he wants to hear, anyway.
“I know, why would they, right? But then again, looking at everything we have right now. What if they did?”
“There’s no need to raise your tone—”
“Yeah, if you could,” Steve says.
“Enough,” Steve says, and at that, Tony deflates slightly.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “I could be giving you the best head of your life, but you’re the one who wants to talk.”
“So he
“Tell me what you want,” he said.
Steve nods dumbly, turns the lock in the knob, and goes.
“So what are we going to do?” Steve asks, fiddling with the bag Tony kept all his paraphernalia in.
Steve raises his eyebrows, waiting.
The interview with the counselors of the couples retreat goes the same; thankfully all their planning was worth it, and Steve answers the questions without second thought. Tony must have done the same, because now they’re standing outside a large wooden cabin along Lake Placid.
“No,” Steve says, assessing and casting all his thoughts aside. “Maybe not.”
“I don’t
“I—no!” Steve says, standing up. “Not
“You were terrible at hiding.” Steve tightens his grip on Tony’s hand, and Tony looks up.
Steve’s throat feels tight, and he chalks it up to the strange feeling of being caught. He slings the gun over his shoulder and runs down the stairs. His phone buzzes in his pocket, and by the time he gets to the ground floor, Stark’s car is zooming out of the compound. Steve swears and slams his fist into the doorframe in frustration.
“And then I woke up in the hospital, and you know the rest,” Steve finishes.
This, at least, brings a small smile to Steve’s lips. “However,” Tony starts again, “I am told, that just talking helps. Is this helping?”
Steve cups Tony’s cheek, rubs their noses together. “No,” he says. “I remember being over there,” he lifts his hand to point at the spot under the tree. Then, he rests his hand once again on Tony’s face. “I remember how bright the sun was, and the shorts you wore were red…” he trails off, smiling as he sees Tony’s face crinkle up with fondness.
“Where did you get cake?” Steve asks, bewildered and still shaking off the last remnants of sleep. “Why is cake always involved?”
Steve stops in his tracks when he sees him, doesn’t even think when he shouts across the set: “Tony!”
I let out a shaky breath. Steve seemed to feel it, and tightened his embrace around me.
“Thanks, Tony.”
“I should—something of yours?” Steve tries, feeling out of his depth. He digs into his bag and tosses a shirt at Tony, who slips it on. It’s a bit big on his shoulders, and it takes Steve’s breath away. Stupid, how something so simple could elicit such a reaction, but that’s been the case since they first started this whole charade. It awakens something in Steve, something primal and possessive that makes him want to pull Tony close, kiss him, cover Tony’s body with his—
When they finally get to the door of Tony’s apartment, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist as Tony punches in his code. He smiles to himself as he peppers Tony’s nape with kisses, still in a mild state of disbelief that only a few days ago he’d chanced upon meeting Tony.
Steve turns to Tony to say thank you, but Tony’s already back by the window, adjusting measurements.
?” Clint says, in a tone reserved for playground mockery.
“Seriously Tony, thank you. It means a lot that you keep working on upgrades for us.”
“You’re welcome,” Steve grins, and they tuck in. “You still have work to do?”
Tony turns to look up at Steve, his features highlighted by the glow of dusk. “You happy?” He asks. He asks these questions periodically, as if Steve hasn’t given him enough proof, or maybe (more likely) that he doesn’t believe it.
“I don’t think so,” Tony turns to Steve, smiles. “Not really my scene.”
Pepper nods and smiles. “It was really nice meeting you, Steve.”
She finds them first; surrounded by rubble and quiet. The tenderness of the scene almost takes her breath away. “Is he—” she starts. Tony looks up, startled, his hand stopping mid-motion from stroking Steve’s hair away from his face.
“But it is,” Steve adds, quietly, wrenched open and completely unravelled. He couldn’t stop himself from talking even if he wanted to, and he doesn’t want to, admissions continuing to tumble from his lips. “I didn’t try hard enough to find him, after he fell, and even now—I just, I didn’t do enough, Tony. I could’ve done more,” Steve closes his eyes and breathes deeply through his nose, trying to calm himself.
Still, Tony’s hand in his is warm, solid, and a reminder that despite everything, at least he has his small, physical comfort.
”Fury has
“Strange says he was looking for his father. That’s all I know,” Tony replies.
“See you around,” he mutters, turning his back, leaving Bucky to slumber.
he has to remind himself. They had an outsider to blame ‒ partly. How easy would it be to decide it was all Zemo’s fault. Only that wasn’t true.
Steve gives a stern sharp look at Bucky, who grimaces.
“Sure,” Steve snort.
Which brings him back to the five seconds that slowly crawl by.
Steve nods.
Tony notices something is wrong and his angered expression turns to worry.
“You look good,” Steve says. A corner of Tony’s mouth twitches at that.
”You're leaving, aren't you,” Tony says, clearly trying to hold back the tremor creeping into his voice.
Then, Tony hangs up.
”Steve,” Tony repeats, ”You alright there?”
Steve takes Tony’s face in his hands, smiles at him softly. The wondrous look in Tony’s eyes is beautiful. “We aren’t weird,” Steve says, “We’re just meant to be, sweetheart.”
Time ticks by. The five seconds could be up any moment, but Steve consciously forgets about them. Of course, the future still worries him. The only comfort and hope he has is that Fury has contacted him, informing him that Carol Danvers is looking into Thanos – it doesn't look good. Next time Thor swings by tower, Steve needs to send him Fury's way.
“Come on,” Steve chuckles, “Thor would have sided with me.”
It’s then when Sam returns, throwing the phone back to Steve. “He almost hung up on me,” Sam states, “but let me talk with some assistant. They’ll come and pick up Wanda tomorrow, from the gas station we visited.”
After Tony soon finds out Shuri excels in the medical field as well, he immediately takes her to Rhodey. Some new guy called “Strange” had apparently been treating Rhodey, and Rhodey was gradually gaining mobility, but Tony still waited for a miracle.
“I was just trying to be considerate,” mutters Tony, sitting on the couch Steve and Wanda had occupied a couple of hours ago. He takes a generous sip, and proceeds to stare at the bottom of the glass, undeniably some expensive crystal collectable left from Howard and Maria.
With a gasp, Tony disconnects their lips. ”S- Steve,” he sighs, voice filled with raw desire.
“Good,” Steve says, wondering if leaning in for a kiss would ruin everything.
Steve’s heart flutters.
Tony comes back two hours later, throws himself in Steve's arms.
“Yes,” Steve says. It’s only fair.
Tony lets go off Steve's hand he had been holding in his lap. ”I need time to think,” he says glumly, ”I just wish you'd told me sooner, you know?”
Steve grins and flips them over, swallowing the surprised sound Tony lets out by collapsing their lips together.
“We’ll be fine,” Steve says, trying not make his voice tremble. Tony’s eyes are wide and startled. It looks like he’s not entirely there. “Go back to your room, Wanda.”
“I don’t want to,” says Sam gruffly, “And what about you?” Then, something dawns on him. He turns to Steve, gasping,
When Steve turns around, he's not quite prepared for what he sees - it's Carol Danvers, floating in the air, arms crossed across her chest, a playful smirk on her face.
Placing his hand on Tony's arm, squeezing it reassuringly, Steve says, ”I'm here.”
Sharon shakes her head, saying, “No, in New York,” she pauses, seeming nervous. “Her name is Lisa-Marie.”
As Pepper walks away to find Tony, Steve stares after her. If he wants to have Tony, he needs to sweep in soon.
Natasha squints at Steve, a little too long for Steve's comfort. ”I thought you and Sam were going to look for him?”
There's ugly bruising on Tony's side. The same spot where he had been pierced in Steve's timeline. Steve hovers his lips there over Tony’s skin. He makes sure to kiss every scar he finds on Tony's body.
Not about the time travel – that will remain a secret forever, that the
”Both of them.”
There's that again.
“Right,” Bucky says, gritting his teeth, “Like he will ever forgive the man who murdered his parents.”
Wanda chews on her granola bar. Her cheeks are slowly gaining some color.
Steve had looked into Peggy's fierce eyes and found himself not holding back.
“Very safe,” Steve says.
So Steve tells Tony that, getting a nonchalant shrug in response.
”Jeeze, alright. I just came to tell you Barnes has been sighted in Europe,” Natasha says, hopping to sit on an empty table in front of Steve.
“I have nowhere to go,” she says, speaking for the first time since their escape. Her voice is hoarse. Steve rubs the back of his neck. Technically she’s right.
”Huh,” says Tony. He looks like he hasn't have a good night's sleep, even though he had been dozing off when Steve had left the room, brushing his lips lightly against Tony's forehead, barely getting to feel the heat of his skin. ”Well, Natasha, if you want a better mattress or a bigger room that can be arranged. I mean, you can switch with Thor or maybe not, he's going to throw a tantrum because he's used to everything grandeur and getting what he wants…”
“I’d like to head off this evening,” Steve says, “Would that be possible?”
”Yes,” Natasha says, leaning back on her chair. Every time Steve hears her speak, he thinks of her last words to them.
“Bucky,” Steve coughs up.
Wanda’s gaze bores into him, making Steve squirm. Steve thinks she’s discreet, not invading anyone’s mind without consent, but Steve suspects his feelings can be read from his face.
”Why are you looking at me all funny?” she confronts Steve.
Steve fidgets with the phone in his pocket. There’s always that option. There’s no guarantee Tony will pick up ‒ and Steve won’t be the one to call him. It’s Tony choice, Steve can’t force himself on him.
”Anything you need, let me know!” Tony shouts after her.
“Most definitely,” he says, pulling back. His eyes are warm, but a little glazed.
Still not quite convinced, Tony asks next, ”What do you want?”
Shuri stays.
”I- I tried to blame him, but I couldn't, in the end. He was just a brainwashed weapon to HYDRA. It – it wasn't
Steve had only wanted Tony. He had only wanted Tony for years, even when things got ugly.
“No, I have business to do,” Steve says. He couldn’t let his team be locked up even one more day. “Thanks for the heads up, Shuri. You’re truly miraculous.”
”What?”
She's alive.
“Steve,” she squeals, throwing the phone on the couch cushion, rushing forward to embrace him warmly.
”You can't stay,” Peggy whispered as the song came to its end.
Steve recalls the broken state Thor had been in after Thanos and swallows thickly. Maybe Thor should have returned the stones. He had deserved a second chance.
younger, this is almost ten years ago – and beautiful, always so beautiful.
A sudden noise makes them drift quickly apart. They both lift they’re heads, lips reddened by the kiss, to see Wanda and Shuri standing by the doorway. Shuri has her hand pressed against Wanda’s mouth, but she has been too late. It was Wanda’s sudden gasp that had broken them out of the kiss-haze.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Her name is FRIDAY,” he says to Shuri, who knows that perfectly well, but has fun calling FRIDAY “ceiling lady”. “And she’s totally getting reprogrammed. JARVIS would have never betrayed me.” Tony glares at the ceiling.
Steve is used to Tony calling him Cap or Rogers, but he rarely goes for plain ‘Steve’. Suddenly, Steve’s heart beats a little faster. “Might be,” he says, locking eyes with Tony. He then realizes how close they are. Steve could count Tony’s eyelashes. He leans forward, sees the confused, slightly unsure look appear in Tony’s eyes…
His breath catches in his throat as he looks at Tony in the wan light.
First, he’s going to help out his team. Then, he’s going to hide somewhere and build up the courage to face Tony ‒ hopefully by the time his phone stops being mute. And if that happened, he’d run ‒ he’d run to Tony.
An inkling of worry bothers him as he hesitantly enters the tower. But then, Vision's – no – Jarvis's voices comes,
”I'm not lying. And I'm not going anywhere,” Steve says. He wants to grab Tony and pull him against him, kiss his hair and make him believe he's wanted.
Tony looks the same. A little more worry lines on his face, a little less light in eyes, but otherwise, the same.
Steve leaves Wakanda. A week later, he helps his team break out of their prison. No one comes to stop them, so Steve suspects maybe Tony has something to do about that. Maybe he’s letting it happen. Warmth spreads through Steve’s chest at the thought, but he also knows that they’re Tony’s friends too ‒ well, he may not be that acquainted with Sam and Scott ‒ to be honest Steve himself doesn’t know Scott at all ‒ but Tony understands. Locking them up in the Raft is just cruel.
Steve doesn't have a home. Not anymore.
Peggy had suspected. Peggy had listened. Peggy had believed.
In this world, Tony Stark hasn't born yet. In this world, Steve Rogers has a breakdown in front of the house of the woman he had once been in love with, not ready to face his own harsh reality.
“I know you and Stark have a complicated past, but I didn’t know you could be this pathetic. What’s stopping you from going ahead and confronting him? Kissing his brains out? Don’t bullshit me, Rogers, I know you have feelings. I can even hear them from the way you say the guys name.” Sam rolls his eyes. “
And it isn’t. Clint is a man with a wife and a handful of kids. Natasha is his best little spy friend. Steve and Tony, however ‒ it had felt more like a painful divorce than an ugly spat between two friends.
“I’m sorry, Tony.” Steve tries not to squeeze the phone too hard, so that it doesn’t shatter in his desperate grasp.
Steve.
Steve actually
”Don't worry about him,” Steve whispers against Tony's lips, ”He's gone, sweetheart. He's gone. You're safe.”
“Well, how was it?” Steve asks, almost bursting.
home.
”Thank you, Nat,” Steve says, ”I would go, but…”
“Take care,” he says to Scott, who nods, a little dazed, salutes at Sam and then runs off until he shrinks himself, disappearing into the world.
ask Wilson to join us. I have nothing against the guy, sure, our natures don’t exactly match, but he’s proven himself an adept avenger. I do respect the guy.”
”You can't just come here and expect to sweep me up in your arms. Shit- Steve, what's happening?”
Sam comes to their rescue ‒ apparently his cousin owns a cottage somewhere in Minnesota, deep in the middle of the woods.
“Who?” Steve frowns, but Wanda merely shrugs.
“I’m a princess!” Shuri insists, but she’s smiling.
The window slides open and Carol enters the room gracefully.
has been busy for the past few days, dealing with the aftermath of everything, as well as preparing for his new duties as the ruler of his country.
“With you? See, Wanda doesn’t really speak to me.”
”Occupied? With Stark?” Natasha says. Steve stares into her incredulous face.
him.”
”Aren't we talking now?” he huffs.
”Where
T’Challa nods, and Steve leaves the room to gather the little belongings he has.
Wasting no time, Steve is on his way. He half-jogs to Tony and his breath is caught in his throat as he sees
Natasha comments. Steve has to use all his willpower not to crush her into a tight hug. Although not the same, she's still
And he's pushing Steve away.
”Steve,” Tony insists and there's only one way to make him stop. Steve rushes forward and grabs Tony in his arms, crashing his lips against Tony’s in a searing kiss that makes butterflies explode in Steve's stomach. Tony tastes like heaven and he's so
“What’s your plan? Are you just going to sulk and pine here, maybe grow a beard?” Sam tries to tease.
He wouldn’t hate Tony, not even over this. There had been much at stake, but Steve had realized long ago that Tony was the one who had been hurt the most. Sure, Steve didn’t agree with the Accords and sure, Tony shouldn’t have went after Bucky, but‒
Tony seems genuinely surprised to see Natasha.
And maybe Steve was filled with false hope, but he couldn’t let it go.
”I- I promised you a dance. We never got that,” Steve said to Peggy to steer the subject away from Tony. His voice was rough. He didn't sound like himself.
“But he was?”
Steve touches his beard self-consciously. It was something that Sharon constantly teased him about, but it was a necessity. With facial hair, he’s harder to recognize. Captain America was always clean shaven.
“Have you heard of Thor?” he asks.
”Home?” Natasha repeats, confused. ”What exactly is home to you? That miserable apartment of yours?”
“I miss you,” Steve says, almost choking on the words.
“Wanda, how are you?” Steve asks. At the same time, Lisa-Marie’s phone starts to ring.
“You should call Stark. I think he misses you,” she says, something Steve hadn’t expected at all.
“So, care to explain what are we doing in Stark’s house?” Bucky asks as he enters Steve’s room later in the evening. He leans on the doorway, crossing his arms, staring at Steve quizzically.
As he caresses the face of the sleeping love of his life, free from all the worries, Steve remembers the grim place he has come from.
Gosh, what has Tony had to go through… First, he and Pepper end their romantic relationship, then the Accords, the fight, Siberia…
“Come on, Tony,” Steve says gently. He’s aching to comfort Tony with a touch, but keeps his hands firmly around the coffee cup. “He fought well. Let’s not dwell on the mistakes we’ve made. What’s happened won’t be undone.”
“Sad to see you go,” says Shuri. Her youth is even more striking than T’Challa’s, who’s a grown man, after all. Shuri has the posture of a true princess, and the keen eyes of a prodigy. Still, she can’t be more than a couple years older than that spider boy Tony had recruited. For a fleeting moment, Steve can only see a young girl in a Star Wars t-shirt.
“Take care of Bucky for me? Promise?” Steve insists.
At first, Tony's face is blank. Then, there's disbelief and finally, the tiniest of smiles.
“T’Challa,” says Steve.
He finally does, and Tony is completely silent after that. The hurt in his eyes mirrors the hurt Steve had seen in Siberia. But Bucky isn't present and Steve doesn't have to choose.
“Do you think we beat Vision and Wanda in the weirdest couple competition?” Tony laughs as their part.
Nat has cut her hair. That’s the first thing Steve notices as she struts towards them. It’s still bright red, but reaches her chin now.
Steve doesn't say anything, just stares at Tony who looks so beautiful in the morning light.
Tony doesn’t reply anything, and Steve doesn’t open his mouth, but it still feels like they’re communicating.
Steve thinks. He thinks about Bucky and Sam, and their constant bickering. He’ll be glad if Bucky ever gets to that stage with Tony.
”Nothing. Just good to be home, I guess,” Steve sighs. Laughs. He wants to scoop Tony up in his arms and…
“I’m sorry, I have to get this,” she excuses herself. Steve hears her talking to the phone as she walks away, “Yes, Mr. Parker? No, he’s in a meeting. I don’t know…”
”Just for me to sign some things,” answers Tony with a wave of his hand.
Steve wishes he was as brave as Wanda. Seeing Tony is something Steve wants badly, but he can’t do it. Not just yet. He is not ready to see that hurt cloud Tony’s eyes again.
“Promise.” Shuri smiles softly. “Sergeant Barnes will be safe in my hands,” she says, “Actually, that’s why I’m here. My brother told me you were leaving and I had to let you know that I’m close to a breakthrough.”
Steve tells Thor Nick Fury wants to speak with him, gives Thor all the needed information to find Fury. Soon, Thor is on his way.
That leaves the two of them alone in the kitchen.
Sharon Carter is a great ally. It amazes Steve how effortlessly she seems to arrange everything, even though she’s merely an agent.
They fall into silence, trying to get back into the film. “I kind of lied. I am seeing someone,” Sharon says quietly after a while.
And he can’t go to Tony without him needing Steve. But Sam can.
“Can we meet?” Steve has never sounded so timid, so vulnerable.
Steve loves Tony. Has yet to realize how much, is confused.
Wanda sighs in relief.
“No,” Steve says, the word so silent it can barely be heard.
”Who's the little girl?” he asks, eyeing the unfinished sketch decorating the paper.
“It wasn’t him, Tony,” Steve says softly, placing his hand on Tony’s knee. “It was HYDRA. Bucky was just their weapon.”
Noticing how keenly Steve is looking at the door through which Tony left, Natasha offers, ”I can go with him. If you are… occupied.”
“Oh,” Steve says.
”I need to talk to you,” Steve says to him solemnly. Steve can see Fury's eye swift behind his glasses.
He's going to take care of Tony. Nothing bad will ever happen to him again.
only. But don’t assume I’ll be nice to him.”
Steve’s broken out of his thoughts when Tony smiles at him, his whole face shining with utter joy. Steve finds himself thinking,
“Steve,” Steve corrects, “I’m alright, Princess. Glad to go home, actually.”
“Yeah,” Tony breathes. It’s only a faint whisper. “Don’t worry. I got her. How’s the rest of the team?”
But no.
Steve exhales and speaks, ”I need to talk to you.”
“Yeah, I don’t know who,” Sam admits.
Tony starts to walk away, and like a magnet, Steve follows him twenty feet behind.
Tony frowns.
“I’m sorry,” he repeats, like a broken record.
Out of every possible genius on the planet Earth and outer space, it was Shuri who was the most likely to decode Bucky. If Tony Stark had one breakthrough a day, Shuri had two.
Wanda still doesn’t look satisfied, eyeing Tony with mistrust.
“Ceiling lady?” Shuri says, “When was the last time he had problems with at least one of his suits?”
Currently, Steve’s standing in a small studio apartment in Philadelphia. Sharon is shuffling through some documents, checking if there’s any mistakes. Steve looks around in the shabby place. It’s most likely one of those SHIELD hiding spots he’s already familiar with. Sam has a similar one in Long Island.
“Wakanda,” Steve answers shortly.
Right now, he's wondering, how would Tony react if Steve reached over with his foot and ran it up and down Tony's shin.
“Jesus,” Bucky chuckles, “I get it Steve. I leave you deal with your feelings in peace. But don’t pretend they don’t exist! You should go for it, by the way. You two would be a literal power couple.”
Tony squints at them. He’s squeezing Steve’s hand in both of his, as a promise for more.
Lisa-Marie’s smile is understanding. “It’s fine. Perhaps not, but I assume you know a certain Sharon Carter?”
“And, then you apparently
Humorlessly, Steve laughs.
So he doesn’t. He’s going to fix what is broken ‒  that what can be fixed. He’s going to paint over the cracks, start a new page.
Steve shudders, listening to Fury talking. He wonders how much he should intervene, how peaceful he should make this timeline. Ultron is a start and Steve knows it cannot happen again. That leads to the accords and that leads to the rift between him and Tony. Steve wants to keep Tony.
Tony. Six feet under.
Jarvis must alert Tony of Steve's presence, as Tony is suddenly looking up, eyes locking with Steve's.
Steve envelops Tony in his arms, hushing him as he whimpers softly. ”I won't,” he assures Tony, thumb stroking the nape of Tony's neck, feeling the soft baby hairs there. Tony is shivering, pressing his face onto Steve's shoulder. ”Tony, don't think for a second I'm leaving you. Yes, Bucky has to be dealt with, but Natasha and Sam are going to handle it. I think it's better that way, in any case. I want to stay here with you. I
He counts, one, two, three, four, five.
”You'll find your quarters ready for you. I've informed Sir of your presence. How long do you plan on staying?”
Sighing, Sharon continues, “I really miss her, though.” She places her head on Steve’s shoulder, something that Steve knows can be totally friendly in today’s context.
“Anyway, Parker is only fifteen. Fifteen! I sent a fifteen year old kid to fight Captain America…”
he’s signaling, realizing what he had just interrupted.
Steve doesn't know if Tony’s ever going to feel the same Steve feels. It doesn't matter: Steve takes what he can get. Tony – warm and alive, heart beating. Holding him in his arms had felt heavenly. If that’s what he's going to get, he'd work with that.
haunts him.
Bucky snort. “Don’t try to act all innocent, Stevie. I’m perceptive. Why else would you hurry away from Wakanda, even leaving me behind?”
“I bet I could make him a better arm!” Tony calls after her.
This time, the kiss lands on Tony’s lips, and it’s everything and more. Steve closes his eyes in the bliss, let’s himself be surrounded by Tony, and only Tony. Everything tunes out ‒ not only the noise of the TV, but the worries of the future and past.
Peggy understood. With a pained smile, she got up and walked over to the record machine to put on some music.
The evening of that same day, Steve and Tony end up alone in the living room. Tony’s had a long day ‒ meeting after meeting, and he’s had to deal with Pepper, and Steve suspects the break up still stings.
Steve doesn’t go with Sam and Wanda. He stays sulking in the cabin, unable to let go of the silent phone. Not even Shuri has texted him an update on Bucky. Frustrated, Steve huffs and throws himself on the bed, stares at the stained ceiling.
”Sam won't be here till Tuesday, so I have a couple of days to kill,” Natasha continues speaking.
Steve nods glumly.
Soon, he can't stand up anymore, collapsing on the curb. The suppressed sobs strangle his throat. Steve wipes is face, the snot mingling with the tears.
Tony sips his coffee. For a long moment, silence presses around them. Steve is just about to resort to talking about the weather,
She had. Steve knew she had gotten married, had had children. As she should have, as was her right. To move on. Be happy.
However, this is another level. If Sharon gets caught, it’s another life Steve has indirectly ruined. He sighs.
“Seriously doubt that, old man!” Shuri chirps with a sing-song tone, making Tony splutter.
Tony makes his way to the cabinet, grabbing a bottle of whiskey, and pouring himself a fair amount. He inclines the bottle towards Steve, and asks, “You want some?”
As if Steve didn't half-carry him into his bedroom, constantly assuring Tony that he wasn't leaving.
“He hates me for sure,” Bucky states.
“Hello?” Steve answers. His voice is shaking, his hands are shaking, his legs are shaking. He feels weak, collapsing on the bathroom floor, leaning on the washing machine. His heartbeat is in his throat.
Those moments in the 70s, when he had gotten to be with Tony alone, had been the last happy moments of his life.
but Steve wishes she'd realize sooner how lonely Tony has been. How much he needs the team.
”Tony, are you even listening to me?” Steve says, taking a stride forward. He raises his hands, places them so gently on Tony's cheeks, caressing the paled skin with his thumbs, the touch feather-light.
It’s silent, until Tony says softly, “I would have answered. I did ‒ when you made Wilson call. Gosh, I was so mad when I heard his voice. I was so disappointed it was him.”
”How- How did this happen?” Tony stutters out, his voice an octave higher. His fingers have come up to trace the remnants of the kiss on his lower lip. ”
When Wanda is gone, Steve turns his full attention back to Tony. “Are you alright?” he asks gently.
“Tony, he… I think he asked Vision to stop you from leaving, but Vision hit Rhodes instead. He fell… before Tony or I could reach him.” Sam looks grim, chewing on his lips.
Shuri’s words die on her lips.
Screw that, maybe they
Tony's kiss takes Steve's thoughts away from the things to come. They kiss like they're each other's oxygen, Steve pulling Tony flush against him by his waist.
”Oh, Steve,” she finally said, ”I'm sorry. Do you… Do you want to talk about him?”
had Pepper said. Tony has lived alone in the tower.
Sharon shushes him, pushing her forefinger playfully against Steve’s lips. “I know. We weren’t meant to be, meant to last,” she says, “It’s just a cover up. So that no one suspects why I come to Philly so often.” She seems to hesitate, then asks, not daring to actually look at Steve, “Did our kiss mean anything to you?”
“She fought in a war in Wakanda. And she’s super smart. She’s got all the ingredients. How is Parker, by the way?”
the words get stuck in his throat, trying to choke him.
Steve can only nod again.
“Are you sure you don’t want to redesign your suits? I really have some good ideas,” Shuri is saying while peeling an orange.
”Both of them?”
To Steve's surprise, Tony does that. His eyes look vulnerable.
Clint is squinting at him like Steve is a puzzle is trying to figure out. “You have that blind faith in him again,” he comments, “I thought you hated his guts.”
through the glass.
Even thinking of
“When I joined the Avengers, I never knew it’d come to this. Sam Wilson, the Falcon, now an outlaw… With Captain America of all people… What are we going to do now?”
“So, how was your day?” Tony asks suddenly, throwing the empty carton on the table. He turns towards Steve, unintentionally shuffling a bit closer so that his leg hits Steve’s hand. Steve retreats his hand as if it had been burned.
”Yes,” Steve softly agrees. He know that as of now, Tony and Pepper are broken up. Steve remembers their relationship was on-off for years until they finally worked it out.
There's only one thing Steve cannot tell to Tony, besides the grim future that doesn't even exist in this place and time – not if Steve can do something about it.
“You have a visitor, Ms. Maximoff,” Lisa-Marie announces. Wanda’s head snaps up faster than lightspeed, her eyes hopeful. The hope in her eyes die for a nanosecond, then it’s replaced by joy.
Steve has been slowly inching his hand towards Tony, not sure if he wants to grab his hand or place it on his thigh.
she writes, and that cheers Steve up a little bit. He hopes everything’s alright in Wakanda. He wonders if he could have helped.
When they part, Steve can see the changes in him. Bucky’s face is a little more relaxed ‒ and he has a new arm, the latest Wakandan technology, probably produced by Shuri.
“I doubt he wants anything more… I doubt he even wants to be friends anymore… I kept a heavy secret from him, and then beat him with my shield…”
If Tony had thought that as well, Steve was even more angry at himself for participating in destroying all they had built.
rest. Not before he acquires some peace of mind. “Besides, I’m an outsider.”
Natasha glances at Steve.
Hours later, Sam comes back without Wanda, carrying two bags of McDonalds.
”But you are,” Tony states. A bead of sweat trickles down his temple. ”Aren't you? You're leaving with Natasha to chase your old buddy.”
”I've come to stay.”
Steve watches Bucky walk into the woods. He’ll deal with Bucky later because right now, he yearns for something else.
Steve pushes the thoughts away.
Every time Steve tries to say it –
It was decided quickly. There was no other option for Steve than to say ‘yes’ when Tony hesitantly asks Steve if he wants to come stay with Tony.
Steve wants to pull Tony close, hold and caress him. Instead, they sit with a space between them. Tony is forking leftover noodles into his mouth, eyes on the TV where a movie is playing.
”It's fine,” Tony says, his smile a little broken. ”I mean, Bruce comes to stay sometimes, quite often, actually. And Thor swung by just last week. Hilarious guy.”
”Let her in. I know her,” he says to Tony.
The truth is – Steve has completely entwined himself with Tony. The world he came from fades into the background. Just a nightmare, a nightmare he wakes up from almost every week, Tony's name on his lips, the image of his charred body underneath Steve's eyelids.
Tony merely raises a brow at that. Steve is glad they can lightly joke about what happened.
“I feel no resentment towards him. Not anymore,” Wanda admits, “ I’ll go live with him. I have no fear to face him. Do you think he’ll take me in?”
“Yeah,” Tony smirks. He hasn’t let go of Steve’s hand. Leaning forward, he gives Steve a chaste and unsure kiss, which Steve returns eagerly.
In confusion, Tony scrubs his face as if something was wrong with him. There's nothing wrong with him. He's perfect to Steve. Tony being merely alive makes him perfect to Steve.
”Tony, look at me."
“Vision,” Wanda says. Her cheeks flush a bit as she takes the phone. Steve shakes his head fondly. There’s a relationship he hadn’t seen coming.
“Good,” Steve says, “Hiding.”
”I'm Carol,” she says, ”I have to tell you, Nick didn't mention you two were involved.”
“Lisa-Marie Rhodes,” she says, offering her hand. As Steve shakes it, he wonders why her name strikes a familiarity in him. He shakes her hand a little too long, so that she starts to look a bit uncomfortable, her smile freezing on her face as Steve analyzes her features, trying to figure her out. She has dark brown skin, similar cornrows as Shuri ‒ same intelligent glint in her eyes as well ‒ and she’s wearing bright pink lipstick, but nothing in her is a familiar as her name.
Steve is in the lounge, reading news, some of which he remembers, some of which he doesn't, when Pepper walks in. Steve recognizes the pattern of her heels clicking before he even sees her.
The next evening, a Wakandan ship lands near Tony’s estate. Steve, Tony, and Wanda stand waiting like the world’s oddest reception committee. Steve can feel the anxiety come off from Tony in waves, but Wanda is calm as the night.
Tony nods, trying to stand up.
“Now we have to figure out what to do with you,” Sam says with a sigh, “I’m not actually keen on spending any more time in this rotting rathole. And there’s always the danger that my cousin will come to check his property.”
Steve’s lips are burning.
“I-,” Tony falters, “No.”
”Everything’s fine, now. Just… been having a rough time. It's alright, now.”
Tony chuckles. It sounds ugly, heartless, and morbid. “I thought you’d already forgotten you gave me the phone.”
“Unless…” Wanda continues before Steve can propose any desperate solution. He’d take the girl with him if it came to it. Or send her to Wakanda. “I could go back to… You know. Vision will be there. I think he could understand me ‒ I like him, even though he took the other side.” She licks her lips, turns to gaze at her feet.
“Oh,” Steve says, “Look, Sharon-“
Not that T’Challa wouldn’t have been busy either way. But he does afford a sliver of time for Steve.
“Alright,” Tony breathes, “I’ll do this for you, and
“Bucky!” he says, as he hugs him. Bucky goes rigid for a while, but returns the hug.
With longing, Steve stares after Tony. Natasha sighs, ”Well, that was awkward.”
”Yes,” Carol says to Tony and then turns back to Steve. ”He told me to let you know that Thanos is dead.”
“Oh, so you don’t have to stress about it anymore? You’re welcome,” Tony says bitterly.
As if nothing happened last night.
And pines.
”The others- They don't come here?” Steve asks quietly.
The A.I. doesn’t suspect a thing, which at the same time soothes and worries Steve.
“I’m not going to apologize anymore,” he begins, searching eye contact. Tony’s eyes are defiant, but he’s listening. “I’m sure we can agree that we both did some grave mistakes. Let’s not discuss whose were more weighty. That’s irrelevant, as of now. What’s happened won’t be undone. All we can do is rip off the messed up pages, and start a new chapter. Can we do that?”
He jumps all around time. Truly becomes the man out of time.
“Me too,” he says longingly.
Steve grasps her shoulder, offering her comfort. He knows well enough how it feels like to be kept apart from people he cares about.
Her eyes glisten with excitement, the way Tony’s do when he rambles on about his inventions.
He’s a man with a plan. A vague a plan, but a plan nonetheless.
“Because… I didn’t want to push. It was me who hurt you. If I called, you wouldn’t have answered,” Steve explains. His face is sticky with tears.
Now, all the infinity stones, plus Mjörnir, rest in their right times and places. Steve has completed his mission, the only thing he has left to do is to go home.
Sighing, Steve hands the phone to Sam. “You call him,” he says with a strained voice.
He sits alone in Tony's room –
“Give it time,” Steve repeats. He trust Tony will grow to grant Bucky forgiveness. It’ll happen when the pain and the betrayal doesn’t sting so sharp anymore.
“Love?” Bucky says quietly.
”I thought you were my only chance,” he said, ”Then I had another. I screwed it up. And I lost him, for good.” His voice broke, then. ”Peggy, I lost him. He's
He’s staring at Tony, who’s stepped back so that he’s standing half behind Wanda. Tony’s eyes hold a cold defiance in them. He’s fiddling with his wristband, as if he’s readying for calling a suit.
Finally. “How are you?”
And that’s what Tony actually does.
“Steve,” T’Challa smiles at Steve.
”No.”
”Yes,” Carol says, ”I was there. Thor cut his head off. He is dead. The Black Order are dead. His daughters – they have leaped side.”
“I knew,” Steve whispers, “And I never told him, until it was too late.”
”For how long? Until you find yourself your own place?” Tony's fingers fiddle with a tool. Steve wants to take those fingers and kiss them. He wants…
Steve automatically answers, without a thought.
He takes the battered phone from his pocket. Sam and Wanda lean closer to look at it.
Wanda smirks. “No, you know I don’t do that. Besides, you’d know.” The smile dies from her face, turning into a slightly worried expression. “I’m pretty good at reading people without invading their heads. And your emotions are clear on your face. Plus the fact that you made Sam call Tony instead of grabbing the phone yourself.”
And now, he's where he's meant to be. At Tony Stark’s doorstep, ready to be home and
Tony hangs up, and Steve drops the phone on the bathroom carpet, draws his knees closer to his body and puts his head between them.
“What are you up to?” Bucky asks, looking from Wanda and Shuri to Steve and Tony, slowly raising his eyebrows.
”It happened,” Steve replies, ”It happened and it's all I have.
“Is everything alright?” a soft voice interrupts them. The both turn their heads towards it, and see Wanda, hesitantly standing at the doorway.
“All should be fine now,” Sharon announces, handing the documents to Steve, who glances at his new identity. Apparently, he’s legally called Mathew Cavanaugh, for now.
The five seconds haunt him.
Shuri snickers, and leaves the room.
“America’s national dish,” he announces, handing Steve a Big Mac.
He doesn't know what Tony's working on, head bowed, lips moving as he talks to Dum-E. Steve can do nothing but stand there, looking, looking at the love he lost and the chance he has.
Tony hums, “Yes, but my bed is bigger.”
“Then you might as well call me T’Challa,” T’Challa answers, gesturing Steve to take a seat next to him. “Now, tell me, what’s on your mind?”
“Are we on the same page now?” Steve whispers, lightly caressing Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “You’re not lingering in the past?”
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. Sometimes it still looks like Tony wants to flinch when he’s in Steve’s company.
Steve realizes. He’s lost his father, and a whole nation is relying on him. Steve wishes him some peace of mind. When Steve leaves, at least T’Challa will have one less of a headache. He doesn’t say anything out loud, though. He just smiles back at T’Challa, hoping he’ll know how grateful Steve is.
“Where are you going?” Tony asks accusingly.
Only then Steve notices a relatively young woman, maybe in her early 30s, standing a little further. He frowns nervously, but then Tony steps forward ‒ he’s intoxicating close, so close that Steve can smell his faint aftershave ‒ and says, “Don’t bother worrying, we can trust her. She’s Rhodey’s niece, or second cousin, or something, I don’t really remember. The main point is that Rhodey trusts her and so do I.”
After Tony and Shuri come back, the little tension they had between them is gone, replaced by gentler teasing. They’re speaking in fluent science jargon that makes Steve’s head spin. It reminds Steve of the times in the tower, of Tony and Bruce, and his heart aches for the past.
He thinks of Carol then, the ally he had barely known, and her unquestionable loyalty to Fury. Their friendship that made Fury seem like a completely different person.
“Please sit down and stay,” Steve pleads.
Of course she had. Time travel wasn't a hard concept to wrap one's head around for a woman who had been there to witness the creation of Captain America.
had T’Challa mentioned to him and Bucky. Those words had stuck with Steve, but there was more.
He knows he needs to tell Tony about how his parents died. The sooner the better. But should he warn Thor about Loki soon ruling Asgard in disguise, T'Challa about his cousin wanting to take over Wakanda? Perhaps he should, but Steve has no idea how to contact the men.
”Ah, Agent Romanoff!” he says, making a beeline to the coffeemaker. ”You decided to stick around.”
Except he feels so connected to Tony it actually is. It’s cracking his heart in half.
He still hasn't told Tony.
“No, lighter is better,” had Bucky said, surprised that Tony was actually speaking to him. “The previous one felt
“If a weapon destroyed something important to you, wouldn’t you want to destroy the weapon?” Tony whispers hoarsely. His eyes look conflicted.
“Yeah,” Steve says, rubbing his eyes.
Steve cannot stop the steady flow of tears running down his face. He doesn't know why exactly he is crying: if it's because of Peggy or because of…
Steve runs to meet him, unable to contain the broad smile spreading on his features.
“I’ll…” Sam says clutching the phone, “Go to the other room.” The bedroom door shuts behind him, and Steve and Wanda are left alone in silence. Sam speaks so quietly, maybe on purpose, that not even Steve’s enhanced hearing can make out the words.
Steve realizes Tony has returned when he hears the man talking on the phone with Rhodey near Steve’s bedroom.
“He cares about you,” Steve interrupts, “All of you.”
“Tell Bucky what?” says Bucky, suddenly appearing behind the girls. He has that habit ‒ emerging from nowhere.
Wanda blinks at him slowly. She looks miserable ‒ pale, thin, and exhausted. Steve had seen how they’d treated her in the Raft. He recognizes Wanda is a
Bucky is going to have to run for his life with barely any rest.
And suddenly, Tony is leaning forward, holding himself up against the table. His shoulders shake, Steve can practically sense his heartrate going up.
Wanda trails off, shrugging and smiling sadly.
The glint in T’Challa’s eyes tells Steve that he understands exactly what he means. “Very well,” T’Challa says, leaning forward, patting Steve’s shoulder. “We’ll ready you a ship.”
“Wakanda?” Wanda repeats, tilting her head.
No, Steve needs to tell Tony about his parents.
”Steve?” Nat asks. She sounds worried. She was always such a good friend.
“Sam, I’m out of ideas,” Steve admits. He’s tired. He can’t grovel back to Wakanda, it’s too far. He needs to be near Tony in case of him
”Because I wanted to.”
Steve does pay a visit to Bucky before making his way to his ship, tapping the glass in front of his friend’s tranquil face, unable to resist a sad smile.
He stays quiet. All the time.
That had felt like only a second. The silence between him and Tony feels more like the 70 years.
he had written in the letter, pouring his heart out, but not the amount he would have wanted to.
“No,” Steve says gruffly.
Steve and Tony have been circling around each other the whole day. Actually, Tony had been gone most of the day, visiting Rhodey, hopefully giving him Steve’s regards. Steve had mostly spent the day playing chess with Wanda, which as an afterthought was not very wise since Wanda could see what moves Steve was about to make in advance, and thus ended up winning every time.
Steve puts away the sketchbook, hating the way Tony's smile stiffens on his face. Natasha notices that too, shuffling her feet awkwardly. ”But I can stay for a couple of days,” she hastily adds.
“I will,” Steve says, and means it. He turns back to the kettle that’s beginning to sing, and they both walk back to the team together. Steve feels the beginnings of doubt (fear) niggling somewhere below his heart. So, maybe, fine:
Steve tuts. “Step four, experimentation. Small gestures, date nights.” Steve rubs Tony’s back as he speaks, and stops to tilt Tony’s head up to face him. “Am I getting this right?”
“Steve,” Tony’s voice is tentative, and it’s been a long time since Steve has felt this scared, butterflies fluttering all over the caverns of his body.
He resolves that he’ll try and smooth things over with Tony tomorrow (once the buzz of confusion and stress in his brain has stopped), and it’ll all just go back to normal and Steve—Steve will just have no romantic feelings ever again.
“He’s just so nice, Tony! I want to get to know him,” Pepper says. She has the good sense to look chastened, but Rhodey wonders how much of it is sincere.
“I love you,” Steve whispers fiercely into Tony’s skin.
“Did you hear me? You. You’re the love of my life. Please don’t make me compare,” Steve huffs out a small laugh, and it warms Tony all over, like sunshine peeking through the clouds after a strong rain. “And maybe you don’t believe me just yet,” Steve touches their foreheads together, then rubs his nose against Tony’s, the affection plain and chaste. It makes Tony feel more loved than he’s ever felt in his life—not that there were many moments to compare against, but still.
Steve sighs.
“Steve!”
He walks them back slowly toward the bedroom, their knees knocking against each other, hips bumping into tables and chairs.
“Or not!” And at that, Tony stomps away.
“Ever?”
“I know, I know,” Tony says harshly. He pushes himself off Steve’s chest and looks up at him. “But I know that I can, too.”
Tony turns his wrist, checks his watch. Three AM? Figures.
“Sorry mom,” Tony says as he plops down beside Steve. He takes a long drink of the coffee he’d left on the table and holds out a hand. Steve gives him the tablet and rubs his eyes, tired from the exposure to the screen.
Steve takes a deep breath. “I said, me too,” he repeats, louder now.
“Why are you acting surprised, honestly,” Tony says, not looking at Steve as he tears open a foil flavor packet with his teeth and dunks its powdery contents into a steaming bowl.
It’s barely acting anymore when Tony moans as Steve kisses his way down Tony’s chest. Tony feels alight, feels
Once I was in the safety of the elevator, I formed my hand into a fist, bit into it, and screamed.
On Steve’s right, Thor had moved around and eventually found (and eaten) most of the spilled popcorn. Now, his toes were tucked snugly under Steve’s legs, seeking warmth.
“No.”
“No, I’m fine,” Steve answers, words backed up by the stubborn belief that if he says it enough, it’ll eventually be true.
Going to sleep that night is an awkward affair. For all their touching and pretend sweetness, they’ve never had to sleep beside each other.
“Of course, Captain. Shall I announce them?”
“Steve?”
Instead, he watches, cock twitching in his pajamas as he watches himself manhandle Steve. He clicks to the start of the video, pushes his pants down and takes his cock in his hand, stroking slowly as he watches the way Steve moves under him, remembering the way Steve felt under his hands, breathing hard, eyes trained on Tony’s as he came. Tony has proof, sees it in the video, and at that moment, he lets out a strangled cry.
“Fine,” Tony says, steepling his fingers over his stomach. “Tell me, Steve. How can we make our relationship more open to communication?”
Twelve miles later and Steve still can’t think. It’s as if his mind has just erected a wall around the memory and refuses to access it, either out of self-defense or shame.
“Don’t worry, I’m forcing myself enough for the both of us,” he says, laughing a little.
I hate that I wanted him to.
Tony closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, as if offended. Steve, at this point, is used to the reaction.
“I’m worried about what’ll happen between us, when this weekend is over.”
Above them, JARVIS coughs delicately.
He remembers when Steve first leant it to him, months into their relationship. They’d gone out for a walk, and despite Tony’s own jacket he was shivering. The leaves had turned gold and red, and the breeze brought the reminder that winter was on its way.
“It’s me,” Steve says, laughing a little. The man gestures to the seat in front of him from behind the bar.
“I like it when you call me that,” Steve realizes and says out loud at the same time.
Tony looks over his shoulder and regards Steve for a moment, then his eyes flick to the rest of the team, behind Steve and catching up to them.
Tony lets out a growl of frustration and crosses the room towards Steve. Steve doesn’t mean to, but only realizes he’s been backing away until his back hits the wall. Tony makes a move to touch Steve, to reach out, but stops, balling his hand into a fist and biting into it.
,” Tony says, anger once again coloring his words. “God, it’s like you don’t know who you’re talking to. Hasn’t anyone told you? Don’t bullshit the bullshitter.”
“What do you want?” Tony asks.
excited to work with Tony again, even if he’s seen Tony around fairly often.
Still, Steve fell into a fitful sleep.
Steve spreads the sketchbook flat on his bed, eyes drawn immediately to the name signed on the bottom of the page.
Then, the man scratches the side of his head, shaking it a little as he mumbles to himself. “Er, go straight there,” he says, using his hand to direct Steve’s gaze. “Then you turn right at the first. Then after two…” The man pauses, and bites on his lip as he thinks. It’s absolutely adorable.
Tony smiles, pained and tight. “So,” he says, sitting at the foot of the bed. “Bucky.”
“Yeah.”
“Why?”
, it startled a laugh out of Steve.
Beside him, Natasha stretches out like a cat and yawns. “That was fun,” she says, untangling her legs from under her and getting up gracefully. “Good night, nerds.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, mostly just to say something. He glances at Tony, who’s wrapped in a gray cable-knit sweater.
“I—I read your note,” Steve adds, hesitant even if he’s the one who wanted to come here, wanted to talk in the first place.
, he thinks. Couldn’t hurt. There are worse ways to deal with your feelings.
“Do you want me to tell you what I want?” Tony asks, and he sounds shy, and Steve furrows his brow at Tony:
, Steve says to himself, because he’s a fucking idiot.
They were good together. Great, even, now that Tony has had a fair share of relationships to be able to compare. Still, the years he spent with Steve were some of the happiest in his life, but the way they ended only served as proof that maybe the best things weren’t meant to last.
“The first time I worked with Tony Stark, I had barely started my career. We were both really young, and well, for me…” Steve pauses and runs a hand through his hair before smiling at the camera. “I wasn’t too experienced yet. But he was so gentle, and sweet, and he really helped with my nerves.”
“You know how I like my coffee,” Tony says, voice filled with slight wonder.
Tony doesn’t miss the way Steve’s cheeks redden. “Oh, I know I just—“
“Can’t have you feeling left out,” Tony says, smiling down at Steve and offering his hand.
“Signs point to no, boss. But I can pull up recent results on the search engines?”
Steve wakes up very, very slowly. His legs are splayed out in front of him. His eyelids are heavy. Beside him, a weight. Dark hair, scuffed loafers.
He ambles out of his bedroom to look for a snack, but finds his refrigerator empty. Cupboards, too. Why is there an empty Doritos bag on the floor? Steve pockets the flask and exits his apartment, telling JARVIS to bring him to the communal floor. For sure they have some chocolate in there.
“Don’t touch me,” Steve grinds out, his whole body feels both on fire and trapped in ice all at once.
Steve reaches over Tony to pick up his tablet, and flicks it on to scan through the report. He turns to kiss Tony’s shoulder.
“Okay.” Steve says, his tone much stronger than he feels.
He stands up with a jolt, pencils and notebooks clattering on the floor. Steve’s movements are jerky, imprecise—all he’s thinking is,
Step three: if that was a sign, then there was a problem.
Steve rolls his eyes and sighs. “Well, Tony, how about you buy me dinner first?”
“Okay.” Rhodey leans back and pats his lap, and Tony lies back down. “But promise me that if he did hurt you, you’ll let me punch him.”
Steve lets out a small, relieved sigh. “Thank you, Tony. Really.”
, or the time that he and Tony had sat down and gone through (in excruciating detail) their story for the couple’s retreat counselors who would be interviewing them separately for admission. It was an exhausting conversation, but Steve had broken down their main agreements succinctly. On the margins of the page were his notes:
“It is four in the morning.” As if sensing Steve’s next question, JARVIS adds, “Sir is currently in the workshop.”
you. I think you’re cute.”
Tony is standing by the window, looking out into the night.
They arrive just before noon, and Steve begins to sweat as soon as Tony kills the engine. Tony’s parents’ beach house is an expansive Spanish-style bungalow, all bleached white walls and wood. Before Tony, Steve had only ever seen things like this in magazines and Pinterest. The caretaker, Jojo, comes out to greet them and take their bags. From the front door, the house opens up with a view of the sea. It takes Steve’s breath away, the sight of the bright blue water glittering in the sunlight. Then he wonders how safe it is, to just have all the doors thrown open like this, but then realizes that this is a private beach.
“I can’t wait,” Steve says, right before nipping at the skin above Tony’s collarbone.
,” Steve says, fumbling already with the little Spanish he knows.
After a while—probably, a long while—JARVIS pipes up: “Captain Rogers, Sir is inquiring about your status.”
Even if he’s all alone, he can’t say why he hasn’t thrown out Steve’s favorite jacket. It didn’t even fit him properly, and stopped smelling like Steve years ago. He does remember—quite shamefully—that it’s the one thing of Steve’s he didn’t give back. After what had happened he’d packed up everything that reminded him of Steve and given it to him, except this.
Steve remembers the pride swelling in his chest as the team took down the base quickly and efficiently, like a well-oiled machine; he’d write the op up for a case study, but there’s no SHIELD anymore that could make use of it.
“Why didn’t you want me,” Steve asks, and he knows he sounds pitiful and he hates it, but he can’t bring himself to stop, either.
Steve can’t sleep. Again. He oscillates between his sketchbook, the TV, the reports on his tablet but nothing keeps his attention, and nothing helps him feel any less keyed up. Steve sits on his bed and surveys his room, and his eyes land on the small flask of mead Thor had given each of them.
Steve frowns. “You know, no one’s forcing you to watch movies with me,” he says.
Tony’s laugh cuts out abruptly into a soft moan, and he tugs Steve closer until they’re pressed against each other, hip to shoulder.
Steve waves Tony away, walking briskly back to the elevator. He realizes, once inside, that he’s still holding his empty glass.
“Steve,” he says, as he gently pushes away Steve’s hand, “I—I was afraid to find out how you’d react. And this is what I—” Tony sighs again. “I can’t. I can’t just stand by and watch you lie to yourself about Bucky.”
Tony pushes himself up to sit properly on the chair. “Shit. Steve,” he reaches over the table to wrap a hand around Steve’s wrist.
“How was your day?” Steve doesn’t even turn to look when Tony enters the apartment, can tell who it is from the heavy sigh that follows once the door clicks shut.
Tony lets out a string of curses in Spanish, and Steve groans against Tony’s neck, feeling himself getting hard.
Steve smirks at Tony. “Thanks for the tip,” he says as he pockets Tony’s phone and runs to Tony’s room. Tony realizes what he’s done a second too late, and he fumbles around the furniture as he tries to beat Steve to his room.
Tony looks up from his phone, doing his best impression to look disinterested. “Pepper didn’t leave me much choice,” he says, which isn’t actually a lie. Pepper had pulled the best friend card and offered to pay for lunch, and Tony had only agreed when she had promised to stand up and protect him from his ex, whose art was being displayed.
“More than all the other times you’ve said that?” Steve teased, lying down beside him but propping himself up on his elbow so he could look at Tony.
There’s a knock on the door.
“If Howard did remake the serum, then how come there aren’t more… super soldiers?” Steve pauses at the phrase. It still feels strange to refer to people (himself) that way.
“Oh, yeah, you’re right,” Tony says, orienting himself by looking up at the buildings around them.
“After two corners,” the man resumes, “you turn left, and then you will see—” another pause. “Many people,” he finishes with a grin.
“Who’d have thought,” Steve muses, “Tony Stark likes belly rubs.”
“No,” Tony grumbles.
“Just, just tell me if you don’t want this. Tell me if it’s just me, if you don’t feel the same, just tell me and I’ll drop it,” Steve says, because it might as well just come from him. Tony moves his hand back onto his lap, and Steve finally manages the courage to look up at Tony. He’s momentarily shocked by the sadness in Tony’s eyes.
Rhodey nods sagely, and smooths down Tony’s hair. “Yes, always. My apologies.”
“Maybe next time,” I said, giving Steve a small smile and a wave before I turned away and walked to the door.
“No more mead for you.” Tony holds out his hand, motioning for Steve to hand over the flask. Steve feels his jaw tighten with the renewed flush of irritation, but fights it down. This time, Tony’s right, he reminds himself. He hands over the flask and reaches behind Tony to press the exit button to the workshop.
Tony rolls his eyes and turns back to his noodles. “No, I don’t,” he murmurs under his breath.
“Speak for yourself,” Tony scoffs.
“Hello?”
It’s not in the script, but Tony flips them over so he hovers over Steve, desperate to feel in control after losing himself so much under Steve’s touch.
“Natasha—”
Tony bites his lip, but Steve can still see him smiling. He looks like he’s about to say something and Steve finds himself holding his breath, and then Tony shakes his head and bends down to press a quick kiss on Steve’s lips.
Steve reaches over again, this time to tilt Tony’s head up to meet his gaze. “Of course not.”
“I’m not laughing,” Steve says soothingly, rubbing a hand up and down Tony’s back. He’s never seen Tony cry before, and it makes a lump form in his throat, but he pushes past it.
“That’s not the
Steve smiles down at Tony, tips his chin up, and kisses him.
Only Tony’s awake (of course it’s Tony, Steve thinks, shaking his head at Tony’s sheer disregard for his health, and at that, Steve realizes the irony of the sentiment), so Steve takes the elevator down to the workshop and spends around a minute staring through the glass walls.
“Just want to make sure that you know what you’re really getting into,” Tony teases, but continues to keep his posture.
“Frankly, Tones, I’m surprised you even know the meaning of the word.”
“You’re driving me crazy,” he says, his voice muffled by his fist.
Sometimes, Steve tells him the truth:
Tony jolts up and backs away so quickly he almost falls off the bed.
“I can do it.”
Sometimes, Steve plays back everything that happened, the truth of it. How he never got to say what he wanted to out loud. But in those dreams Steve doesn’t lose sight of Tony. Then, in those dreams, he lifts up the face plate and says, “I got you,” and Tony smiles and says, “that you do, soldier.”
Tony arches his eyebrow, unimpressed. “So not at all.”
“Come on, it’s your turn. You talk, I cook. Should be easy enough,” he says, unpeeling a shallot.
“I do,” Steve says, his voice muffled.
Natasha raises her eyebrow at him and smirks as she pointedly looks at his hand on Tony’s lower back. Steve frowns, and drops his hand to his side. Natasha rolls her eyes, then turns back to the cockpit.
Steve looks pointedly away, feeling incredibly self-conscious. He doesn’t know why he said what he did, but he’d said it. “I mean, it’s true,” he huffs.
“You’re unbelievable,” Tony finally says. He raises his hands and plants them squarely on either side of Steve’s face, tilting his head gently so now they’re nose-to-nose. “Are you sure about this?”
Natasha sighs again, moves her hand away from Steve’s back to hold his hand. “I know it might not come off that way, but he does feel the same.”
Steve grins, reaches over and shakes his hand. “I’m Steve.”
That’s how they end up in Steve’s room, and Steve fidgets, discomfited under Tony’s gaze.
Behind him, Bruce sighs audibly. “Lock it, will you?” he says, trying for humor, now.
At one point during the interview, Tony rests his hand on Steve’s knee. Steve immediately responds by taking Tony’s hand in his, and Tony turns to him, a small smile on his face.
“Yes.”
This isn’t new, either. Lying awake on each other’s beds, sometimes talking, but most of the time, not. What is new is Tony turning towards Steve and sliding an arm under his neck, pulling him close.
Tony’s tapping the tip of a screwdriver against his bottom lip as he thinks, and then two strong arms wrap around his waist and just like that, the problem has identified itself.
They’re silent for a moment, and Rhodey leaves to set the table.
There’s something different about the new guy. Tony has said as much as soon as he’d laid eyes on him, blonde and blue eyed and impossibly shy, even as they made him strip so they could shave him and oil him up. Tony has told them all before, that he didn’t like working with inexperienced boys, boys who would freeze at his touch, worry clear in their eyes and even clearer on camera. But there’s no fear in the new guy’s eyes—quite the opposite. Something about him makes Tony jumpy, but he can’t explain why. So instead, he pesters everyone else until they can give them a satisfying answer.
Steve makes an annoyed sound, but opens the book back up and rests it on Tony’s forehead.
“Are you serious?” Bruce unscrews the cap and takes an experimental sniff just as Tony unscrews the cap of his and takes a shot.
“Well darling, so are you, and that’s what we pay for,” Jan says, meeting Tony’s eyes in the reflection of the mirror. She tilts her head, assessing him, before she runs a hand through Tony’s hair.
Thor huffs, brings his bowl of cereal, and goes into the kitchen as well.
Clearly, I’m a simpleton, easily wiled. But then again, it’s not as if Steve meant for this, I cannot imagine him to be the type to have
Tony kisses him hungrily, and lets out a gleeful “Yay!” when Steve pushes him away gently as he removes his own shirt.
“Doesn’t mean I have to like it,” Tony says, and leans down for a kiss. “But since you keep asking,” Tony trails off, raising a finger to his chin.
None of it is fair. It was never fair. I should have seen from the start that I was always going to be on the losing team—but then again, I did know. I always knew, but I thought that I was strong enough not to care.
So, now, a hand around his back, valiantly trying to make its way across his shoulders. He has broad shoulders. Tony said so. Steve knows so. Not just because Tony said, but Tony said so too, so, it’s doubly true, possibly. Anyway. Just a few minutes. He’s so tired. He’s been so, so tired. He’ll rest for a few minutes, and then he’ll get up.
Steve smiles to himself, settling into the couch and tightening his embrace around Tony. If this is what it takes to get Tony to sleep, then he doesn’t mind at all.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to roll his eyes. Steve sets down his tablet and walks up to the two of them, surprising Tony has he claps him on the back. “Come on,” Steve says.
Steve pulls away to rest his chin against Tony’s sternum, lifts his eyes to meet Tony’s. “I thought you’d be used to my stubbornness by now.” he says, smiling up at him.
The man blinks at him. “Sí?” he prompts.
Bruce is leaning against Clint, tablet still glowing bright in his hands, as his head lolls to the side and lands against Clint’s shoulder.
Tony frowns, furrowing his eyebrow at Steve, and Steve winks at him just as the rest of the team arrives.
He lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding when the wire connects.
In the elevator, Tony reaches out and holds Steve’s hand. There’s a part of Steve that’s still afraid that he’ll say something and all of this will go away, so he smiles at Tony tentatively, and notices a slight dusting of pink on Tony’s cheeks.
“I’m happy you came back,” he says. “I was worried.”
—no. He was considerate, and kind, as he has always been.
Steve is
“No,” Steve says, leaning back and then: ouch. “Ouch,” he says, helpfully.
Tony blinks at him.
Tony sighs. “Look. It’s what’s in the plan!” He points at the paper, a bit rumpled now. He’s very helpfully highlighted the words:
At least he has a nice memory to tie to this place, on top of everything else. It’s as good a souvenir as any.
Their next date has them arriving together at a Maria Stark Foundation gala. At this point it’s old hat to see them together. Still, the media do shout over the din of camera shutter clicks: “Are you an item?” “How long have you been dating?”
Steve stares at his notebook, the messy scrawl of his handwriting, and squeezes his eyes shut. Then, he scratches it all out.
, he’s
We’d ordered Chinese and watched a rerun of Golden Girls, and now they were just passing time. (As always been a waiting game.)
Tony looked up from typing on his laptop, surprised. “Really?”
Steve sighs in frustration then looks around the almost empty street—it’s lunchtime, and there aren’t many people milling about, having settled on a restaurant or gone home. Steve’s gaze lands on a man ostensibly doing just that. Steve walks toward the man as he pulls off his glove and punches in the code to his building.
“God answered my prayers!” Tony says, jumping to life and taking the cup. He takes a sip, then turns to Steve, surprised.
So Steve had waited on the balcony, and now Tony is starting a conversation.
“Great.”
Chapter seven:
Tony continues to weld, and continues to remain shoeless.
From here, Steve can see all the way to Brooklyn, and he feels a bit funny, to be standing in a high rise with all this expensive furniture, when a few years ago, his apartment could’ve fit inside his current bedroom. Steve scrunches up his face and looks around the room again.
Steve threads their fingers together, squeezes Tony’s palms. “Hey.”
Steve sucks in a breath.
thing—about going on dates with Tony is how surprisingly pleasant their conversations were. After the initial awkwardness of their first, Steve had made an effort to open up, too. He talked about drawing, art, and music.
“Or whatever. I’m here now so I might as well. I figure I’ll leave you free reign over the tower for a bit.” There are words scratched out.
Steve remembers furrowing his brow, hugging one of the oversized pillows to his chest in an act of defiance and saying, “You are the most opulent man I have ever met.”
Steve takes a deep breath, takes Tony’s face in his hands. “Here’s a constant,” he whispers, breath warm on Tony’s cheek. “I love you. I love you. You, Tony Stark. I love you.” He kisses Tony, hard and close lipped, more aggressive reminder than affection.
“Oh.” Steve deflates. “Okay.”
Steve sucks in a breath, surprised. “Is that so?”
His new AI chirps to life. “Boss?”
Steve snorts. “Join the club.” Despite his words, he wants to touch Tony so badly it feels like an ache, but it doesn’t feel very appropriate.
“I don’t understand where you’re going with this,” Steve admits, and realizes that he’s instinctively taken a more guarded stance, arms crossed over his chest. He puts them down and rests his hands against the workbench.
“I—” he starts, wishing he had more time, that he’d thought about this sooner. “I wanted to talk to you.”
Tony's hand is placed on the couch, those beautiful calloused fingers that work miracles tapping the cushion. Steve wants to hold that hand, but he can't. He's left wanting.
“You’ve got a bad timing, Rogers,” Tony says, and he doesn’t quite sound like himself. He refuses to meet Steve’s eyes, for start. “I’m needed in a meeting. My assistant will show you around.”
Steve expects to see disgust in Tony's eyes but he sees only confusion.
”And Thanos?”
“Come on, Wanda,” Tony says, making his voice even gentler. “I’ll ask Vision to drop by tomorrow.”
A soft patting of feet snaps Steve out of his spiraling thoughts. He glances at the digital clock – time has ran by and it's nearly midnight.
Rejection? Hatred? Silence?
He wants.
“I know.” Shuri’s smile is smug, but not arrogant.
Wearing the other Steve's uniform, he leaves, glancing back at the river, knowing he had just let Captain America die.
”Tony,” Steve says. That's all he can say, all he can
No. Steve couldn't. Even thinking about his name or his otherworldly beautiful face was too painful. Yet, Steve couldn’t stop. Tony wouldn't leave him alone.
“Do you want to?”
“Do I?”
“Loverboy?”
“Yeah, alright,” Steve replied, moving to grab Tony’s hand, their fingers curling together. “Lead the way.”
“You wanna head downstairs?”
Instead of just ignoring Tony and trying to get back to sleeping, he forced his eyes open and croaked out, “I’m this close to kicking you off the bed, what do you want?”
Tony hummed, “Yeah, exactly. But, 26? Isn’t it too early? I mean, I need Rhodey for at least a little bit more, ya know? Like, next thing you know, he’s popping out babies at 27.”
There were regulations that came with dating Tony Stark. Things that were clear and things that they needed to work through.
Steve was always pudding in Tony’s hands.
“Nah, let's give it a few minutes.”
“Ya know, loverboy. You love me, I love you, we love each other.”
“Everyone fucking believes me; you’re not exactly scary,” Tony said, a little snort escaping his lips.
Tony laughed and pushed away from Steve’s armpit, pressing a messy kiss to Steve’s cheek in return. ”Baby, I dare say, I’m delighted you accepted such an offer.”
“You’re fucking right about that,” Steve said, pressing a light kiss to Tony’s cheek and looking back out to the view.
“So, you don’t?” Tony asked, placing his hand under Steve’s elbow and dragging him towards himself, their eyes finally meeting. “You don’t love this whole mess that’s known as a Stark?”
Steve sighed, looking at the mess of Tony’s curls that was pressed against his chest, Tony’s face hidden.
“Of course it is,” Steve said, leaning his head back on Tony’s shoulder. He sighed. “Why wouldn’t it be? It’s Carol, isn’t it?”
“Sounds good,” Tony said, furrowing himself more into the blanket and more into Steve’s chest.
It was gross, but it was Tony; plus, no matter how much Steve wanted to sleep, he couldn’t say no. “Where?”
“Cut it out, Tony. Do you want to get married by the age of 26?”
“Let’s sit down, yeah?” Tony asked once they got on the roof, making his way towards the spot where they always sat - a tattered old mattress.
“Right now? I don’t think so. Sucks though, since I really was going to come up with you and stargaze.” Steve drawled out, burrowing himself a little more into the covers.
“You know, the more you talk, the urge to just sleep and ignore you grows,” Steve said, closing his eyes and pushing away from Tony.
“No,” Tony said, quietly, his gaze on the sky.
But there was also love. Love when Steve would press himself to Tony, soaking in his smell, his body, and his lips; love when Tony would present a little origami to Steve when he was bored and love when Tony would place a soft kiss to Steve’s shoulder whenever he left the apartment to go to his lab.
Tony pouted, “Come on now, Steve, Stevey, cap, capsicle, loverboy-“
“Yeah,” Steve sighed out in return once he felt Tony’s lips softly graze the spot, “I do.”
“Is it?”
“Don’t you think the mattress would be cold? It’s freezing tonight,” Steve said, tightening the hold on the blanket.
Besides, even if it was cold, the stars did look as beautiful as ever.
“Why do you want to go up there? It’s freezing,” Steve murmured out, grabbing his sweater hastily from the ground next to the bed and putting it on.
Tony was using one of his accents again, and Steve just raised his eyebrows in return.
“Rhodey’s invitation came in the mail today. He’s getting married,” Tony said.
“Huh,” Steve said, “that’s good for him.”
“Nope, it’s terrible. You think you would be a bit better at it considering we see Jarvis every Sunday,” Steve said, a small smile setting on his lips as well.
Instead, he says, “You’re cute when you blush. Make sure you learn to use it well.”
“No, thanks,” I said. “I’ll go ahead.”
“What, like it’s hard?” Steve sasses.
anything, is all. His mind settles into a pleasant hum of emptiness, savoring the simple physical act of closeness. He tips his head up a little. He misjudges the angle, and their noses brush. Steve looks up at Tony, a little startled, and sucks in a breath when he sees Tony looking back at him, an intense, unreadable look in his gaze.
So Steve does. Tells him about Fury, his apartment, about seeing Bucky, the fights, finding out about Hydra. Tony plays the perfect audience, listening in rapt attention and asking questions when Steve pauses. Steve isn’t used to this, at least not from Tony, who barely gives conversations enough attention to finish a sentence. Steve talks, and talks, and talks, and Tony nods along as he reaches into a cupboard to pull out a bag of chips or pour cups of coffee for them both.
Steve hates that he blushes even more. “I am,” he murmurs.
In front of them, Fury rolls his eyes, but the small smirk on his lips betrays him.
“Yeah,” Steve tries to smile. He’s not sure if he actually achieves it. “Anyway. You said you wanted to talk?”
“I haven’t been here,” he says.
“I need a drink,” Tony said over their laptops.The sun was beginning to set outside the cafe they frequented when they needed to get work done.
Still, on the quinjet, Natasha turns to Clint and tilts her head toward Tony and Steve’s general area, her eyebrows raised.
