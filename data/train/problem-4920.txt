Pepper embraced him and held him tightly. Her crisp, white suit was instantly ruined but she didn’t seem to care. Tony melted into her hold and buried his face into Pepper’s red hair. He inhaled the flowery perfume of her shampoo and relaxed into the familiarity of its scent.
The priest didn’t get a chance to finish what he was saying as Steve pulled him into a hug. He never before felt so blessed until he heard a priest from his very religion say that he was normal despite knowing his once most heinous secret.
“Stop fighting!” Peter screamed, stamping his feet. Everyone froze and slowly looked over to the little boy.
Venom tried to trick him but the shadow of the boy’s adoptive parent stood up in his host’s mind and battled Venom in wits and mocked his trickery.
Steve’s face pinched just as Tony touched it and Tony tensed, expecting to be caught in the act. With his phone in hand, he slipped back into Steve’s side and Steve relaxed. Tony waited until he was sure Steve was under before he pulled out his phone and took a picture of the adorable face of sleeping virtue that was his boyfriend.
That fear evolved into fascination. There was someone like him an equal in all rights. She could match him in strength, skill, and wit. She was perfect. Natasha came to the same conclusion and… they easily fell in love.
Clint and Natasha disappeared after the attack, joining SHIELD in their search for Bucky. Steve wanted to help too but everyone was adamantly opposed to it. They all believed the shot was meant for him or Tony. It could have hit Tony if he was not bent over Steve at the time.
“Good morning, Cinderella,” Tony murmured from the doorway. His voice was scratchy with sleep and, when Steve turned around, he found his fiancé leaning against the frame, wrapped up in a thick blanket, and watching him with a small smile.
Ben and May were taken aback by his proclamation. Out of everyone, Steve feared old fashioned predigests from them. Yet they surprised him. May had hugged him and Ben had grasped his arm during her embrace. Ben whispered hoarsely, “You were born to a difficult era for men like you. I’m glad you are here now, Steve. Now you have a chance to be yourself.”
“Sir, Agent May said he jumped ship in New York Harbor. I already have Barton searching Cap’s old haunts.”
Steve smiled at him again and cupped Tony’s jaw, running his thumb over the hard line of the bone. Steve’s eyes slowly trailed over Tony’s features, like he was ingraining this moment into memory.
The memory of the sting had him jolting up in bed and he touched his bottom lip as the pain lingered.
When he saw that man start to strangle Tony…His throat was already turning a ugly color and was probably going to be spouting some nasty bruises later. What worried Steve most was a deep cut in his neck left by one of the hooked fingers of the robot tentacles. The nanobots were already on it, stifling the bleeding and frantically crawling all over it.
It brought more proof that he was alive to Tony as he felt Steve’s warmth sink into his skin and his heart hammer against Tony’s chest. Tony let go of Steve’s neck to explore the rest of him and remember his body but also make sure he was whole.
Tony stared at the zeroes on his implant as he wracked his brain for possible solutions. When one came to him, his heart seized and he covered his implant, as if to hide his decision from Steve. He whispered, “Me.”
Tony turned on his repulsors and raised into the air to keep his distance. It caused a commotion among the people gathered in the room, they obviously were not used to flying robotic men, but none of them tried to attack him…yet.
He wore only the white towel around his waist since he did not pause to get dressed as he took care of Steve. He choose some loose clothing for Steve to wear, sweatpants and a large tank. Steve had teased Tony about how easy it would be for Tony to strip him, making Tony groan.
And then Steve began to run...In cheap Hollywood flip-flops that loudly smacked the cement with every footfall. While wearing a neon blue muscle shirt that said, “I Love LA!”
Peter clutched his chest tightly as if the pressure might dull the pain. It only worsened. He looked to his dad and saw him collapse. His pops fell to his knees beside him, calling out to him.
Steve flushed happily and tried to hide his smile by taking a bite of the French onion soup he got. Tony mirrored his actions, smiling slyly as he took a bite of his sandwich.
Steve’s heart all but burst out of his chest and he sprinted the rest of the way to the lab. What was Peter doing in there? What did the Chameleon do to him??
"No," Steve said his voice breaking a little. "It hasn't been that long. Where are you? Why aren't you back at the transporter?"
“I have SHIELD telling your man that you had died and that you were in SHIELD…I had thought that would be enough…” Cable grumbled, “What more does he need? What am I missing…”
SI Online was an instant success. Soulmates were meting years before their original times and Tony was praised for his program. He turned from a rich nobody who’d inherited his father’s company to one of the most celebrated people on the planet. He was made Time Magazine’s Man of the Year and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but none of that mattered to Tony…
Steve had originally held off on running but the need to burn off his anxiety became too much. He had thought running away from Tony’s house would be alright…clearly he was wrong.
Tony’s anxiety was rising with every passing moment of being unable to see his son. His heart nearly stopped when the body impacted the wall.
With his chest still tight from anxiety, Tony stepped into the unit and it closed around him. In his ear, Jarvis stated, “Charge commencing.”
Natasha was the first to go back to sleep. She breathed lightly with her head nestled on his chest. She felt like she belonged there with his arm wrapped securely around her.
It was vastly different from Gwen. Her body had been light and soft with curves and breasts. But Wade…Wade was heavy and hot and his skin was rough with scars and tough with thick muscles. Instead of breasts, he had a broad chest that was flat and Peter was better able to feel Wade’s heart beat frantically faster than his.
“Where is Peter?” The beast demanded with a growl. Steve inhaled sharply upon the mentioning of his son’s name and a shiver ran down his spine.
He wasn’t worried about watching the old monster movie. The movie’s alien and the symbiotic alien that had attached itself to Peter were vastly different…More importantly, Wade and his father were interacting favorably. There was no tension and they were all relaxed.
Tony was smiling widely as they all moved in unison. It was the same big, happy smile he wore when Steve first suggested he join the Commandos and it made Steve’s chest burst with pride. Being with Steve and his team made Tony look like that. A similar smile split Steve’s lips and he purposely didn’t look over to Bucky, knowing he’d probably be making a face in response to Steve’s smile.
“If you told me this story last year I would have thought you were pulling my leg but with Hydra, that thing in New Mexico, and, well, I just looked up a picture of you on my phone and there’s no denying it…You’re Captain America.” The priest said it with a revered tone.
His home at Aunt May’s was once his safe harbor. Did the alien really think Peter would feel safe here
“There is so much more to art, like animation, and 3d imaging, and…I want to learn it all. I think I want to go back to art school.”
They lay in bed silent for a few minutes, sleepily cuddling. Wade checked him over as covertly as he could but Peter still noticed when Wade ran his hands over his arms. His skin was still puffy and red, especially in the spots where the worst of the burns had been. He looked like he had a really weird, splotchey sunburn and, when Wade ran his gentle fingers over it, he still felt a sudden, sharp twinge of pain. Peter purposely did not react to the pain, not wanting to worry Wade.
Did the symbiote come here by chance? No, it was not possible. It had to know he was the Goblin. But how? And why was it here? Did it want to restart the fight that had begun in the sewers? Was it staking out territory and saw him as a threat?
Steve embraced Bucky tightly and pressed his face into Bucky's chest. He did not let go because, as soon as he did, he knew it'd be the beginning of the end.
Peter hit the wall of a building and stuck to its side with his fingertips. He looked up to Tony with his glass eyes and Tony asked, “Are we going to see you for dinner or what?”
The prosecution were shushing the young woman, trying to get her to calm down, but she was screeching like a wild animal and would not stop as she tried to claw her way to Steve. She stared at Steve with eyes that were mad with rage and need.
Steve covered his face to stifle the heat coming off his face. He was surprised he hadn’t caught fire yet.
“You don’t need it. They still love you and they’re excited you’re back, Cap,” Natasha promised. Steve smiled in thanks and stepped out.
“Inside, May,” Ben whispered. He pushed his wife inside and waved them inside. Steve and Tony exchanged glances then Tony shrugged and stepped up the stairs. Steve followed, his gut felt heavy as he lifted his legs to ascend the stairs.
The time limit he set for himself came and went and Steve did not notice. Steve fell asleep on the empty mattress, exhausted by both his grief for Tony and exhilaration for Bucky.
Peter stared at that smile, remembering his earlier thoughts about kissing him. Both of them still had their masks half on. He could do it. He could easily lean forward and kiss him. It would be so simple,
Tony sighed, “We’re safe here. You don’t have to worry about anyone coming after me. You saw the news, everyone is too distracted by Hydra and SHIELD to wonder what I’m up to.”
Steve flinched and he saw Tony regret the words as soon as he said them. They stared at each other desolately. Both of them were hurt but still too angry to apologize. Steve reflected on Tony’s words and wondered how much Tony truly believed them. Did he really blame Steve for what happened to Peter?
Peter picked up his head and met Tony’s eyes and he reached out to Tony as he gasped in a broken voice, “
If he couldn't run, his only other option was to spend years locked away and forever considered a rapist by the rest of the world.
“Did I fall asleep and am dreaming I’m in a sci-fi comic?” Steve whispered under his breath to his best friend.
The Soldier redirected his gaze at the camera in the corner of his cell and stated, “I am ready to help.”
‘That is exactly what I want it to be,’ Wade countered. It was quickly followed by a second text, ‘Unless you say otherwise. Because bros before bro hoes.’
The Soldier had gotten a hold of Steve by the neck from behind and, when Tony faced them, the assassin flipped a knife in his hand and plunged it into Steve’s shoulder. Steve yelled out and then swung his shield back to knock the Soldier off him and dislodge the knife.
A young Tony suddenly appeared on screen and Howard rounded on the boy, saying, “Tony? What are you doing back there? What is that? Put that back! Put that back where you got it from! Where’s your mother? Maria! Go!  Go!”
Steve nodded and murmured, “I’ll also have a word with the Colonel and see if we can move out any faster.” Steve paused and then added, “And thank you, Howard, I know this must be crazy to you.”
“Sir, Dr. Banner found a solution to freeing Master Parker but he is unwilling to use it because it is a dangerous and martyrish one…”
“Pops,” Peter whispered, touching Steve’s arm and stilling the limb. Peter looked exhausted and he was not trying to fight off the symbiote like he had when it originally took him. Peter met his gaze with eyes that were welling up with tears. He saw the defeat in Peter’s face and it broke Steve.
They rose into the air and the boosters on the robot’s feet blasted with more power. The air thinned and the speed was too much for Peter, knocking him out before he could even guess where the android was taking him.
“Don’t make my mistake, Cap,” she stated, finally raising her gaze to his. Maybe it was thanks to the Asgardian liquor, but Steve was able to see pain in her usually stoic face.
“They have strawberry,” Steve murmured excitedly after quickly scanning the available flavors. “You haven’t tried strawberry yet!”
Thor acted without prompting and swooped down upon the Goblin. The Thunder God moved as quick as lightening and struck the Goblin across the head with his mighty hammer. The Goblin was large and strong but it was no match for Mjölnir. It was hit clear across the room and its grip grew lax as it flew and he dropped Tony.
“We are one,” Venom reminded him and he felt an internal shudder from his host. The boy no longer objected and it made the symbiote smile.
Steve hesitated and he felt as if Hulk had ripped his heart out as he considered letting go of Tony to save the very woman who had maliciously attacked him.
“He's still asleep?” Pepper murmured gently, as if Peter could hear her from where he was holed up in his room.
Steve moaned and he excitedly rubbed his erection into Tony’s. Tony laughed and grasped his boyfriend’s cock and helped line him up. Despite the water hitting them, Tony could feel the lube he had used to stretch himself still inside of him and knew he could take the super soldier. They had already made love that morning and Tony stretched himself out before they flew over.
The street his reading led him to was practically empty. Tony stepped out of the car and called out to his son, “Peter?”
, it was driving him mad. He pushed her against the wall with a growl and she snickered when he sucked marks onto her neck too. Her snickers turned into groans when he palmed her breast and rolled his hips into hers.
Bucky broke their embrace and grumbled, “Fucking Hydra happened…They – They made me the Winter Soldier…”
Wade shook his head and his insides bubbled nicely at the memory of Peter’s voice. He knew Peter and he loved Wade despite
His body was warm and lay on a soft mattress. Legs were tangled with his and another body was pressed against his front. He'd recognize that body anywhere.
Steve smiled and nodded but he could not help but ironically think that Tony had said the same thing for the preliminary hearing. He pushed the thought away but he could feel it festering in the back of his mind.
Pepper nodded and said, “He doesn't have to do anything. I'll write up statements on his behalf and all he’ll have to do is okay them. They’ll basically explain that Peter doesn't want to give out any interviews as of yet.”
Tony dropped his blueberries from the sudden surge of emotions that flared from Fury’s statement and then his eyes heated up from joy and upset.
“Nat, it’s not that bad…” Steve began. Part five of the plan was already crumbling around him. He tried to salvage what he could and hoped it would not make things worse. “It’s just that Bucky remembers you and he misses you…”
Steve’s wild eyes frantically searched the dark room before they settled on Tony. His fear broke down into a shattered relief.
Instead of repeating himself, he reminisced. He talked about Steve. He told himself he was doing it to get the Winter Solider to talk but Tony knew it was more for himself…he had to keep Steve alive one way or another…
Tony did not reply with another ode of love. He lets his actions do the talking as he slowly rubbed his hips into Steve’s, slid his hand under his shirt, and grasped his jaw tightly in order to kiss him as filthily as possible.
Tony was standing as still as a statue but his eyes were wildly jumping to Steve to Bucky to the hand that held the syringe. His throat bobbed as he gulped and the syringe shifted deeper into his neck, making Tony hiss. He said nothing, probably fearing what speaking may do to the syringe.
He had his shield, for which he was thankful for. He had given it to Coulson but he could easily imagine the agent giving up the rare shield without a second thought. Now if only he had thought to leave him his uniform as well… He pulled himself out of the ground and frowned at his nudity. Even with the shield, no one would believe he was Steve Rogers. SHIELD could not hide his death from the world at large and he knew his death had to have been a highly publicized event. He would be arrested for public nudity and probably be sent to a mental institution for claiming to be Steve Rogers, back from the dead…
He expected another rebuttal from Steve. Instead, his husband’s hold grew lax and he pulled away from Tony. Tony moved with him, fearing losing his touch but Steve separated himself from him all the same.
Gabe chuckled and pulled a small flashlight from his bag and held it up to Tony’s eyes. He flashed it back and forth a few times and then murmured, “Your pupils seem fine…”
Bucky took Steve’s old floor and had even started to add his own personal touch to it (a larger television with a gaming system and Peter’s old room now housed Bucky’s artillery collection). Bucky had become a lesser Avenger and was allowed to help in fights to an extent. After a few months with the Avengers, Bucky was on track to recovering all of his memories and stopped slipping into his dangerous Winter Soldier state. Bucky and Tony avoided each other at first, Bucky’s old feelings toward Steve and vice versa had created tension between the three of them.
May reached out and greedily grasped the phone and brought it between her and Ben. They stared avidly at the picture.
Wade jerked under Peter’s hold and he pulled back, whispering, “I…Peter, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…we don’t have to kiss anymore –.”
Grinning excitedly, Tony leaned back against the bench, pulling Steve down with him, and stated, “You may proceed.”
What was he doing? Why was he playing dress up? Who was he kidding? He could not be a superhero. So many had died because of him…
Steve always believed that to be the case. No matter what evils he faced or the wrongs in the world, he thought it was all going to be alright because Bucky was going to be with him to the end.
Cable was quick and held what looked like a scrap of paper in his grip. When he ran back to Steve’s side, he handed him the paper and, as Steve accepted it, he realized it was a photograph.
Steve would be a little tougher. He’d be in a plummeting plane and facing off against the Red Skull…but it was still possible for Tony to swoop in.
Tony looked questionably at him as all these thoughts filtered through Steve’s mind. He smiled at Tony then leaned forward. He kissed Tony’s forehead then the top of Peter’s head and whispered, “I love you both.”
Tony touched the glow and replied, “This is an arc reactor. It keeps me alive. Without it, I’d be dead within an hour.”
. He made Tony feel like he was the most important being in the universe. He was Tony's anchor. He was the best thing he'd ever had in his life because he made sure Tony was happy. And it was obvious his next goal in the helping Tony list...
“Wilson?” Vision questioned his sudden fear, unable to see her despite her standing in front of him.
It hurt thinking they were strangers again on Tony’s end…but the hurt was overshadowed by the overwhelming joy he felt knowing Tony was alive.
Howard knew only one man that could put that look on her face and felt his heart fall into his stomach. He grasped the door handle as if to catch himself from falling and gasped, “No, not Cap too.”
“Steve!” Bruce gasped. “Thank God! Are you guys done fighting that bank robber? The power went out and I have been trying to get a hold of someone to help us! The door to my lab is electronically locked and Hulk proof so even Peter can’t break it!”
Tony slipped off his work gloves and tossed them on the counter next to him. He walked over to the bathroom and pulled his shirt off over his head. Steve merely glimpsed Tony’s structured back muscles before he dropped his gaze. He heard enter the bathroom and the shower turn on. Tony yelled out, “Hey Cap! Can you grab one of my suits out of the closet? It’s by the bots’ charge-stations. Open the door, will you Jarvis?”
He incapacitated the men and was jumping out of the hole he created in the wall in less than thirty seconds.
The plane was tipped at a slight downward angle and light was leaking from the back of the plane so Steve made the long trek to the other end of the aircraft. A few steps in, he came across his shield.
“Yeah, just my ego’s damaged,” Tony retorted. “This was not how I imagined my first outing with the Commandos…”
Outside, he stepped into an alley to more discreetly change into his new shirt and then he gently placed the older shirt on top of a box someone was sleeping in. That person would put better use to the shirt than Steve would.
Steve had been quiet at first, but Tony drew sounds out of the man that made Tony’s own desires curl and his heart quicken.
kiss! Instead they acted out a low budget porno and made each other come! Steve lightly banged his head against the door and repeated, “Stupid!”
Steve’s emotions overwhelmed him in a rush. Shame and dread washed through him and he wanted nothing more to scream. Bucky’s fall replayed in his mind. All these years and Bucky had been victimized because Steve never thought he survived. He pretty much handed him to the Red Skull on a silver platter.
Steve chuckled and dropped his drawers and Tony didn’t feel so cocky as Steve’s cock was literally out on display for a moment before he pulled on his new pants.
“You aren’t involved. You were never here. Go back to Brooklyn and continue your search,” she whispered. “I’ll keep an eye on Stark and his guest here. I'll make sure they don’t get into any trouble."
Tony had a workshop there and he constructed manacles for the super soldier. The military grade metal seemed to be enough to contain and hold him down so far…
Steve kissed him again with one hand on the back of Tony’s neck and the other grabbing his hip to draw him closer. They were skin to skin, but it didn’t feel like enough. He wanted more,
“He’ll be fine, Steve,” Father Michael promised him. “A lot has changed since your era. The news media are more concerned about ratings over events and currently the Hydra scandal is the hot ticket. Tony Stark feeling better and going home would be the last thing in their cycle…”
Jarvis drove them in the Bentley so the entire family was able to pile in the back and Maria dozed off on his shoulder while Tony continued to sleep on his lap.
Peter reached into his pocket to check his messages on his phone. He felt it buzz a few times as he was webbing through the city but never got the chance to check it. Most were from Wade, sending him photos from his brunch with Aunt May and then later ones with memes about sex. Peter laughed and did a quick web search to reply with a few of his own. He was looking down at his phone as he did this but kept walking, which was how he nearly missed his teammates as he cut through the connected gym.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest with an angry huff and speared his glare into the ground. Hurt and sadness churned within Steve and he had the awful feeling of wanting to throttle Tony or push him against the wall and hold him.
“That is not how we are going to announce to the world you two are together,” Pepper groaned, closing the door behind her.
Tony returned to his seat on stage and buried his face in his hands. World leaders, noble prize winners, and such from around the world came up to speak next but Tony did not listen. They could all go on and on about how great Steve was but no matter how much they said it, it would never bring his husband back.
May was a gracious host so she hustled everyone to the table and refused their offers of help with the food. She put a pitcher of orange juice on the table and hurried back to the kitchen, leaving them alone.
“Going to see my lawyers, ladies,” Tony stated. There was a raised counter in front of their desk, on it was a cup of pens and the sign-in book. Tony grabbed one of the pens and quickly wrote out his name and sprawled his illegible signature beside it. Tony turned to Steve and smiled warmly at him. He leaned into him as he held out the pen and murmured, “Here, your turn.”
“I meet the new man, myself, Pep…I-I need to go,” Tony turned to the balcony but stopped when Pepper grabbed his arm and Tony turned to her.
Steve closed his eyes right before the impact. It was jarring but nothing like he expected because he felt
Steve was one of the few people she could actually call a good person and one out of a handful whom she could call friend. She didn’t want to shoulder another death that shouldn’t have happened but she already felt herself preparing for it.
was breaking down the camp around him like nothing was amiss. Yet Steve wasn’t a part of it like he usually was. Bucky easily found him at Tony’s side. He had probably been with him all night.
“It’s strange to remember you used to sneer when they were close like that,” Steve whispered. Tony turned to see his husband was leaning back in a chair beside his bed with some reports sitting on his lap. Steve straightened and put the reports down beside him as Tony turned to him.
The smoke eventually cleared revealing a man wearing a full body red suit with black accents and two large samurai swords strapped to his back. He stopped coughing and straightened with a loud groan. The fact that he was masked alone unnerved Tony but throw in the samurai swords and Tony felt both anxious and angry all at once.
Instead of acknowledging the pet name, Peter replied: ‘They both call each other “babe” a lot but my Dad calls Steve “Beloved” sometimes and Steve says “Honey.”’
“No, no…Why Sharon again?” Steve asked about Sharon, looking beyond confused. He smiled bashfully at Tony and said, “I-It’s perfect…I – Yes, let’s do it.”
“About damn time!” His dad replied immediately, drawing a smile to Peter’s face. “I was thinking Steve and I were going to be getting married by the time you got here!”
They laid back down, this time closer, with their chests pressed so tightly together that they could feel each other’s heartbeats. Peter nestled his face against Wade’s and closed his eyes as he listened to him breathe.
Steve’s hips trembled as he fought to keep himself from thrusting deeper into his mouth. Desire fogged his mind and words slipped out of his mouth with abandon. He told Tony how amazing he felt, how great he was, how much he loved his tongue… He would have blushed upon how freely he spoke but at that moment it did not matter, especially when Tony started to use that tongue. As he sucked, his tongue began to move around Steve’s shaft, exploring it and totally destroying Steve’s control.
Coulson’s mouth dropped and he stared at Tony with an openly shocked face. Natasha was able to keep her expression blank, but her eyes did grow large as she looked at the list too.
“Wait!” Steve hissed. He punched back the Goblin and ordered, “Thor! Take my place. I am going with Iron Man!”
Before the Ten Rings, he used to come in a few days every week…but he hadn’t been back in weeks – no, months.
He reached out to her but she dodged his touch. She turned to him and hissed, “Do not try to stop me or I
“Hold on, Tony,” Steve whispered, clutching him closer to him. He pressed his face into Tony’s hair and closed his eyes, trying to shut out the encroaching darkness.
He could not help but remember that he had ironically made these same steps before, when Tony had nearly died after falling out of the void in their first battle with the Chitauri nearly two decades ago. They had shared a kiss when Tony was still laying on the ground and laughed in elation when Steve helped him to his feet.
“So much,” Peter replied seriously with a smile that rivaled Wade’s in its ability to get any bigger. He leaned in and kissed Wade deeply. Wade drew his arms around Peter again, feeling at home. All his nerves and fears evaporated as Peter’s love surrounded him.
“The media doesn’t know that. All they know is the eccentric billionaire and now he’s been spotted going out with a ‘male model.’ They’re going to think Steve is just another notch in your bedpost.”
His target was not gifting him with an easy kill but a riddle. Why would she want him to remember these things?
“Well maybe not out-out with that insane horde of reporters outside,” Tony quickly reiterated. “Maybe in, on my floor, we could do a dinner date?”
one of those people. When he is with someone, he’s with them 100%. You two might be ‘faking it’ but he’s still putting his heart on the line, so don’t you dare crush it.”
Steve blanched then instantly cast his gaze back down to Peter. His mind was spinning from blood loss and he could not focus properly on his son.
“Sir…I have located more information on the Winter Soldier you will want to see,” Jarvis stated, its voice serious.
After their make out session, they leaned back into the pillows and each other as they looked through the photos.
His throat sealed with that silence. He opened his mouth to call out to Steve but no noise came out.
Tony was fully jerked awake and he sat up sharply, spilling the last of his coffee on the ground. He jumped to his feet and then into his car. He tossed the empty coffee mug onto the passenger seat and sped out of there.
“The man would need to tolerate my touch to be my lover,” Tony spat and took off. His words speared themselves into Steve’s chest and unexplainable guilt rushed through him.
Tony sparred the far-left screen one last glance. He'd left that screen dedicated to Jarvis keeping him updated on the intruder but, when he saw nothing new about the stranger, he leaned forward and put all of his focus back into the Mark III.
There were only two people who had access to Peter in SHIELD Medical and had been there when Venom first took him when Peter lost the dog-tag…
Peter’s chest clenched painfully. He did not want to hear that. He wanted to hear some outlandish truth that explained the entire situation in a way that ended with a happy fairytale ending. He did not want to admit it he wanted to believe that maybe…just maybe, he could have a father again.
Peter smiled again. His outright joy made Wade smile and his insides feel like gooey, hot, fresh-baked cookies.
Steve unbuttoned Tony’s jeans next and Tony presses his face into Steve’s shoulder as it was conveniently there. He then kissed it and then pressed another kiss closer to his neck and then another actually on his neck. His pants dropped and Steve put his hands on his hips and pulled their bodies closer together. Steve also kissed Tony’s neck and then they lifted their heads and looked at each other. This was the first time they were alone since the Battle of New York. The fact that they both nearly died seemed to occur them both in that moment because both of them surged toward the other and they met in a needy, desperate kiss.
The only thing that assured him was, if they succeeded, then he’d be back in Tony’s arms and they’d be going on that date they talked about like nothing had ever happened.
“What you said…earlier,” Steve began. His gaze flickered uneasily and he murmured, “You said being gay is frowned upon in
He carefully positioned himself on the bed next to Tony and embraced him the best he could without breaking their mouths. Tony readily moved aside and wrapped one of his arms around Steve’s torso while keeping the other hand threaded in his hair. They put their all into it, pouring their very souls into every touch.
It felt like he held Tony for an eternity until…Tony finally showed signs of life. The body in his arms grew warm and pressed weight into his.
Steve’s stupidly foolish heart flipped in his chest. Tony had thought similarly as Steve. He had thought they’d end up together in the end too.
Still feeling bitter from Steve’s betrayal, Tony reluctantly explained, “It…It’s a self-sustaining electromagnet. The output is three gigajoules per second which is the chemical energy equivalent of 30 barrels of oil a minute.”
Bucky was making pancakes and, by the stack he already had done, he was clearly making enough for all of them.
“Please, don’t,” Peter sighed. Happy was eccentric when it came to Tony’s protection but with Peter he took it to much higher levels.
Steve thrust up into Tony, humping his face with no abandon. He knew he would not be able to control his strength and tore his hands from Tony's scalp. He dug his hands into the mattress and punctured the bed with ten finger sized holes.
“Yes! Okay!” Tony replied, his mind already racing with ideas. He wanted to do everything with Steve but he also wanted it to be special. In the past, they had to keep their relationship a secret so all their flirting and time together was short and fugitive. This would be the first time they would actually go out with the intention of it being a public date.
Tony was still angry, Steve could tell by his frown, but as soon as his eyes latched on Steve the frown broke as his lips parted and all the blood drained from his face.
Clint still looked uneasy and she said, “Cap needs some time and, as strange as it sounds, Stark might just be the best thing for him.”
Peter narrowed his eyes in suspicion. These two were obviously concealing their identities. Peter’s Spidey-Sense was not going off so they were not an immediate danger to him but that did not mean he had to trust them.
“…What could she want?” Bruce wondered aloud. He did not mention Steve’s near martyrdom which Steve was immensely thankful for.
“See ya,” Steve replied and she nodded one more time before stepping onto the elevator and disappearing behind the sealing doors.
As Natasha carried Tony away, Steve heard him begin to wake. Despite the ringing of the alarm, he heard Tony start to moan which quickly evolved as he fully awaked and he began to scream Steve’s name. Steve curled his fingers tightly around the shell of his ears to block out the sound.
“And he called his companion, Solo. As these are the names to popular Star Wars characters, and not on the generic name Sensis list for their estimated age brackets, there is a very good possibility that these are not their birth names.”
“Good job,” Steve said, he was still mastering the simulator, he couldn’t imagine flying the real deal, especially under such stressful conditions. Bruce smiled sadly and they exited the quinjet.
His mother glanced to the other woman in the room. Peter, never got her name but she wore a white coat matching his mother’s and had dark hair. She was pulling a sealed cylinder out of what looked like a freezer.
"I'll take care of the rest," Tony said, once Bucky filled the first plate. Bucky nodded and he and Natasha slipped away, leaving Steve and Tony alone. Tony picked off the last of the hot dogs and stated, “You had that look again.”
After becoming Iron Man, and more so after the Avengers formed, Tony started getting his act together. He only drank when appropriate and made sure no one was around on August 20
It was at that moment Kilian decided to step out of the fire again. Tony cleared the distance between himself and Steve. He tore the pipe from his clutches. He stepped in front of Steve and raised it like a bat, drawing a chuckle from Kilian.
Or the way they were almost in constant contact with his wrist where a black wristwatch with no face was fastened.
“Friday, has it shown the ability to speak before?” Bruce asked the AI, furiously turning through his notes.
“No,” Steve whispered and gently ran his hand through Peter’s hair. He instantly felt guilty. He should have worded it differently.
By Tony’s reaction...he clearly didn’t feel as strongly toward him as Steve did. It didn’t lessen Steve’s love, but it certainly made it feel tragic like Peggy suggested.
“His…spider-sense,” she explained. “He knew something bad was going to happen and instead of running away and saving himself, he ran to me and tried to save me.”
Steve’s voice dwindled to a stop and Tony consciously noticed that scotch he had spilled last night had soaked into his clothes and his shirt was still damp from it. With sudden dread, he also realized Steve's voice was not a part of his fading dreams.
Steve felt his heart leap into his throat and desperately looked around him. A large pipe, as tall as he was, lay a foot away. He dragged himself over to it and used it to pick himself up. Using the pipe more like another leg than a cane, he made his way over to the triad of tense people.
Steve chuckled and leaned into Tony. He whispered wishfully, “He actually remembered it. For a while there, I thought he forgot about it.”
The world around them seemed to slow down but Steve’s mind remained quick. He knew what the General was going to do. Ross pulled the trigger and Steve threw his shield.
Unlike with Peter, these agents had no qualm with hurting Eddie. Eddie couldn’t use the tricks to escape like Venom had done with the threat to Peter’s life. Eddie was insignificant.
“More than a little! She was fuming! What the hell changed?? She originally wanted nothing to do with Peter!” Tony asked him with a scandalized look.
Steve ran his fingers through Tony's hair, trying to fix it most likely, and murmured, “Good, can't have you falling asleep on your son’s birthday!”
Regardless of whatever happened between you two, he knew it. Treasure what you had, do not lament it, otherwise your memories will be tarnished.”
“…The future is so bizarre,” he murmured, opening a circular tin which looked like it was filled with soap that had melted flat. He got out another empty tin bowl and then poured a little water from his canteen into. Tony watched mystified as Cap, the super soldier responsible for bringing down Hydra, then dampened his brush with that same water and then scrubbed at the soap until he attained a fine foam
Steve stumbled after him, his mind twirling with this new information. They originally were going to sneak in after Osborn sneaked out…but the Goblin had felt no need for deception, leaving Steve and Cable having to clean up the future in his destructive wake.
“Well, since it occupies the top four floors, I’d like to think of it more as a penthouse than an apartment,” Tony stated, leaning against one of the support pillars. He couldn’t help but smirk as he added, “Or we can call it home, if you’d like?”
Clint was smiling as he slipped his phone out of his pocket, but that smile melted off his face as soon as he opened the message. It was replaced by a look of such horror, Tony’s stomach dropped and he didn’t even know what it was his friend saw.
Steve had been fighting to desperately stop his boyfriend from killing his best friend and, in the end, his best friend managed to kill his boyfriend.
He leaned heavily into the tile with one hand and with his other hand he cupped himself and began to rub. He closed his eyes and thought of Peggy: young and laid out in his bed.
Tony chuckled, “That is Cap Bear and -OH MY GOD. STEVE!” Further down by the more popular toys was an Iron Man bear, dressed in the same old-fashioned way as the other two bears to replicate the old-fashioned toys. Tony pulled his fiancé over to it and gasped, “We have to get all three!”
He went back to the bedroom he was sharing with his family. He got a hotel suite with three rooms, but Howard and Maria didn’t think twice about letting Tony sleep in their bed and Jarvis had camped himself out in the living room with the shotgun still at his side.
When the doors opened, Peter and Harry’s laughter became louder and Steve’s smirk became an all-encompassing grin. He heard the familiar buzz of Peter’s toys and knew where to find the boys.
Solo’s long nails cut his arm and Solo’s attitude instantly changed. He gasped, “Chewie! I’m so sorry! I thought you were one of them! I-I…Your arm…”
Steve was the cook so he did not have to clean and was currently poolside on a lounge chair. Tony kept glancing in his direction as if he was expecting Steve to bolt.
He had shooed Harry away, wanting to see his mother alone, but now that he was alone, he was scared. What if she did not like him?
The green monster grabbed Tony in its powerful grip and tore him away from Venom. Smoke was trickling from its mouth and the Goblin roared, “I WILL NOT BE MADE A FOOL OF!”
Tony expected their photos to pop up online within the hour. When they did not, he began to worry. However, they did not worry him half as much as Steve’s suddenly leaving him after giving him an
Tony had worried over Coulson’s presence for a good hour before he worried over more pressing matters…like his empty coffee cup.
“I brought lunch and Pepper told me she bought all of this from your favorite places,” Steve said, pointing to the disposable coffee cup sitting on the counter beside a takeout box of food.
“We’re cool!” Tony assured them. To Fury, he continued, “Bucky did not do that. Hydra did. He was their puppet. You probably read the same files that I did. He was brainwashed but he’s getting better! Guns to the face, however, are a very, very bad treatment.
Steve asked him how he slept and it somehow led Monty into the topic of tea quality and how the American Army needed to get “proper” kettles. This was when Bucky stepped in to join them. He too packed up before settling at the fire and, as soon as he was level with them, he glared at Steve.
Cable’s back was to him so he figured the man didn’t notice his upset. However, he had been too focused on Tony’s image to see Cable glance over his shoulder at him. The deep-set frown that seemed chiseled into his face lessened slightly and he thoughtfully looked back to the reactor.
The bullets bounced off his Vibranium shield, saving their lives. Steve exhaled heavily. He had stopped the bullets just in time. The shield flew far but was beginning to come arching back to him and Ross growled, “You got in the way for the last time.”
He glanced around him and grimly noted the fine layer of grass growing over his grave. A lot of time must have passed since he was laid to rest. His thoughts immediately turned to his husband and son. He could not imagine the pain they had been through. Just thinking of losing either one of them was horrifying. He had to find them! He had to let them know he was fine!
“No,” Bucky growled into his neck, baring his teeth in a snarl. Bucky dug his fingers into Steve’s torso as if daring him to ask him to stop again.
Howard surged forward and embraced him tightly before Tony could finish. Tony’s lips trembled as he tried to hold back the surge of emotion that filled him from being in his father's arms again. He couldn’t remember the last time he had held his father.
Tony informed Pepper that he needed the next couple of weeks to work on extremely intricate matters. Pepper was suspicious at first but then he promised to stay in the tower the entire time and she was pacified enough that he was not going to create a ruckus.
“What I did with Bucky was wrong and I knew it the instant it happened. It was a mistake and I was an ass. I swear from the bottom of my heart that it will never happen again.”
They parted ways with Stark as soon as the elevator opened, the man cited a need for a shower after working so long in his lab. He left them with a nod and Wade knew to not say anything, even in parting, because as soon as he opened his mouth, the wrong thing would come out and give Stark a reason to hate him even more. So Wade nodded too and silently followed Peter to the kitchen.
At the moment, however, he wondered who the hell was throwing explosives at them right before Tony got his hands in Steve’s pants.
Steve passed the new missives along and each man read the information as they ate. Even Tony looked at the information and his expression hardened from whatever was relayed. Bucky was dying with curiosity to ask him what he thought. Was the information good? How soon were they going to get their hands on Zola?
“No,” the Goblin hissed. “Last year, when I broke into Stark’s lab to get samples of the boy’s DNA, I was promised to see results in a matter of months but here we are…No, closer than we had started. I want what I paid for…”
Tony’s eyes flickered over to the nearly empty scotch bottle at his side then to the 2/3s full bottle of vodka on the workbench then back to Steve. He had half wished he drank enough to not remember putting away the incriminating evidence but his fantasy did not come to pass.
He mutely made up his mind. He left the duffel bags on the floor and headed out of the room, dragging the thick blanket behind him in his wake.
Tony grabbed the circular clasp attaching Thor’s cap to his armor and pulled the God forward, excitedly gasping, “Come on!”
Tony decided to surprise them all with a project he had already in the works. Stark Enterprises was building a second HQ in New York and, Tony stepped in and made a few quirks to the design by adding living quarters.
Steve gave him a look. The doctor said he needed a lot of rest and Steve had just gotten Tony off his tablet maybe ten minutes ago. Yet, one look at those sparkling hazel eyes, and Steve was won over. He loved this man too much and humored him by asking Tony, “Who?”
The park was in an uproar as soon as the gunshots rang out and people ran from the area screaming. Police sirens could already be heard echoing off the tall skyscrapers around the park. One figure stood out among all the scrambling others and Steve knew this man to be Peter’s would-be murderer.
Hello! Another hiatus has passed! Thank you for your patience. Due to the long length of this chapter, the holidays, and bout of writer's block (A whole new fic was born from this, check it out
“So I take it that you did not sleep either…” Steve said with a sigh, drawing another grin from Tony.
“Yeah,” Tony whispered, his eyes unable to look away from the face. His heart was aching again as he remembered Steve’s easy smiles and how his eyes warmed as soon as they met Tony’s. Out of all the photos he’d pulled out of the archives…none of them could capture the way Steve used to look at him.
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair slowly and cautiously, as if he were afraid he’d break. Tony slowly wound his arms around him and then Steve lightly kissed his forehead and whispered with awe, “I’m here. I’m actually here.”
It was chaste but sweet and tender. She held him like he was the only thing keeping her standing and he grasped her shoulders and held onto her like she was the only thing keeping him anchored in this world.
He saw the understanding dawn in Steve’s eyes and the super soldier wordlessly got out of his chair and slid into the bed beside him. Tony moved to give him more room and Steve molded into him. He lay his head on Steve’s arm with a heavy sigh and Steve wrapped his other arm around his torso with a chuckle. Their eyes met and they obliterated what little distance there was between them and kissed.
“He can be passionate about only so much…” Tony sighed. Tony stood up and kicked ash and dirt over the fire until the flames withered and died. With only the embers to faintly illuminate them now, Tony turned back to Steve and said, “My dad has always been a sore subject for me…It’s been made worse by the fact that I can run into an overly energetic, younger version of him at any moment…Let’s stop talking about him. Let’s go back to us and flirting and barely resisting touching each other.” Tony stepped back and murmured, “Better yet, why don’t I go to bed and you hang out here for another few minutes before going to bed yourself…And maybe tonight you’ll get just as good of sleep as you did last night.”
He didn’t have to deny himself with Steve other than keeping their relationship a secret from the others. They had a chance at a future together and Tony could open his ridiculously shut in heart to the man.
Coulson nodded and said, “Alright but we are going to need a report about what happened. We also need to know what you want your next steps to be with the media. The public is demanding answers and you will have to decide how much you are willing to share…”
Steve looked down praying to God that he was mistaken but his worst fears were confirmed. Peter had disappeared with Loki.
“You saw what I did. Those trigger words totally disabled me. I am dangerous. I should be put back into cryo until we find a way to fix my brain,” he stated grimly, not looking at her.
Peter quickly picked up the tablet and snuggled into Wade’s side. He chided, “You should have told me what you were planning sooner, meanie! We need to choose one together! I’ll pull up my favorites! Peter opened a separate file and it opened up to pictures of them or just of Wade. There were a few others of the team or his parents but most of the pictures involved Wade. Wade flushed happily and settled into his boyfriend’s side as Peter excitedly pointed out his favorite pictures of them together.
Tony picked up his head to see Steve smiling at him with a pleased expression. Tony held his hand out to Steve and asked, “So, friends?”
! And I’m going to be a superhero one day too! When I get famous from that everyone would know my name anyways!”
transferred that foam to the empty tin. He churned that lather until it became a think foam and held it out to Tony saying, “Ta da!”
Tony was frowning but he nodded and quickly embraced Steve tightly before running to the elevator. As soon as he disappeared, Steve stumbled back and collapsed onto the couch. He caught his head in his hands and internally battled with a hurricane of emotions.
Steve refolded the photo carefully, making sure not to create anymore creases and then put it back into his pocket. He looked around the room again, his body still restless from the events of the far-off future.
Jarvis probably would not approve but Tony needed help. So, like Marty McFly, he needed someone to share the secret with.
Steve inhaled deeply then made himself snap into form. He commanded, “Tony get into your armor and get out there. I need to know what we’re facing. Bruce, we’re going to need the Hulk, if these are really the SHIELD escapees then there are some heavy hitters out there. And Jarvis please let us know as soon as Peter is in the safe room.
Steve’s full weight pushed into Tony as he gave into sleep and Tony hurriedly shook him awake. Steve sat up and sleepily murmured, “Hmm?”
“It’s alright,” Tony reassured him, his brow knotted with pain. White bandages had already been wrapped around his torso on the flight back in the quinjet. He was currently slouched over in his seat and didn’t rise to great Steve like he usually did. It was too painful for him to rise and he stubbornly refused any pain medication. His brows were knotted tightly together as he roughly stated, “It’s all a part of the job.”
“The weapons’ test –,” Tony gasped, shakily putting his hands over Steve’s. Blood gushed between their fingers. “We were attacked on the way back – There was a bomb – A fucking Stark Industries bomb –!”
He thanked her either way and scrolled through his other contacts. He outright deleted a few, knowing his new status as Tony Stark’s son would change certain relationships for the worse. Others, like MJ, he didn't even have to think twice about. She was his best friend and would remain so for the rest of their lives, no matter who his father was.
Steve’s eyes snapped up as his anxiety spiked into a near panic attack. Tony stood in front of him alive and whole. The future wasn’t written yet. He had the evidence of that with their future wedding photo back at the apartment. Steve wasn’t going to lose Tony again. He’d die before he watched him die again. Steve breathlessly continued, “I’ve been trying to revise my future since then…”
He contorted his body in odd ways as he worked on his machinery. It was why Steve first started to sketch him. He was used to sketching people in relaxed positions, either sitting down or standing in place. While Tony worked, he was like a contortionist, moving around his inventions in odd angles to get to a piece from a certain vantage point. Steve quickly had his sketchbook filled with various images of Tony contorting his body in ways he did not think possible.
James slept on the couch. Natasha did not ask him to but she also did not ask him to return to the bedroom.
!” Venom shrieked, its voice was so much like Peter’s that it made the acid from his stomach rise into his throat. He did not think it could talk. Was this a sign that they were losing Peter??
“What kind of weapons do I have on this thing, Friday?” Tony asked, pulling a full 360 under his opponent before trying to get back up to his level. Below him, the ground fighting was just starting. Tony spared a nervous glance to Steve but he seemed to be handling his own against the massive sand monster.
Three soldiers rounded the corner and saluted Steve. He nodded to them and they stood down and joined them at the pile, grabbing some coals for themselves. Tony added another scoop and Steve murmured, “That’s enough.”
Peter sat up and put his feet on the floor. Wade reached out and lightly touched his back, his fingers just barely grazing his shirt. He whispered, “I’m sorry, Peter… That was insensitive…”
Her soulmate blinked in confusion and then nodded sternly in affirmation. He picked up his spoon and went back to eating his oatmeal, however, he was doing it one handed. His other hand remained clasped in hers on the tabletop and it didn’t seem he was planning on letting her go anytime soon.
He shouldered the pain the best he could and forced himself to focus elsewhere. If he survived this he knew he was going to have horrible nightmares about burning alive.
The second wasn’t bad. Actually, it made Peter laugh. Someone had taken several pictures of Tony and Peter from the internet and photoshopped them onto Mufasa and Simba’s faces from the
As soon as the door opened, Peter exploded with questions. “Did you see her? Was it really her? What’s she like? Was she nice? Did she ask about me? Does she want to see me?”
Ben continued to lead him even in his apartment and sat him down on the couch. Steve flinched as he touched the soft cushions. He and Tony sat on the same sofa and held each other innumerable times. He almost lost his virginity to Tony on this couch. He will never again cuddle with him on the couch, kiss him on the couch, or even see him simply lounge on the couch. He felt his heart break all over again.
They made love slowly like they usually did when one or both were half awake. Tony came first and he watched Steve as he fell apart next. Steve collapsed on top of him and then rolled off with a breathless chuckle.
“Hi, Uncle Tony,” Peter said with a mouthful of food. He was more awake now kicking his feet over the edge of the counter.
Steve sighed lightly and adjusted the blanket on Tony one last time before standing up. He crossed the lab with a light tread and, when he exited, he made sure to close the door just as silently behind him.
“Am I a bad person?” Tony asked. He kept staring at the ceiling. He could not look at Bruce; Tony could tell he was upset by the sound of his voice.
He remembered the burning shame and embarrassment he used to feel whenever he caught someone looking at his bare face. Now…he still felt a little uneasy knowing the mask wasn’t there but…it was tolerable. He didn’t even notice the looks of disgust anymore. Just one look from Peter made everything all better.
Peter made his days bearable but, sometimes, looking into the blue eyes, he had inherited from Steve, wretched his heart out of his chest all over again.
Wade's place was an older home that didn't look like it got much upkeep, with its peeling paint and overgrown lawn. A few gnomes and plastic flamingoes were braving the wild weeds in the yard and there was a cheerful welcome sign nailed to the door.
Steve had just rubbed him off and solicited him for sex but, upon Tony’s suggestion, he turned beet red. Tony laughed and humped his hips under Steve’s teasingly.
Rogers snorted and said, “Tony usually does the opposite of what SHIELD tells him to do.” He suddenly grinned widely and said, “Nick Fury told him not to flirt with me and he turned around and did just that. Both Tony and the Director thought I would die from mortification but I surprised them both when I flirted back.”
Steve shook his head and said, “You didn’t see his face after I…I kissed him. He looked so shocked. I think he suspects I was more than practicing and was creeped out…”
Tony’s brows rose with the new information. So they were going to find a way to get the shrapnel out of him, eh? Still, so soon after recovering from the palladium poisoning, he felt a little relieved by this.
“Are you alright, Peter?” Steve murmured worriedly, placing his hand on the other side of Peter’s head.
Iron Man’s eyes flashed and Jarvis darkly murmured, “I see…We need to try to fix this immediately. What it is the most distinguishable change?”
A number of police officers and firemen were already getting fed. Several people called out to Tony as he landed beside Steve and a handful more came over to clap his back and thank him. Tony accepted the thanks and turned the thanks back onto the same men and women who had been working tirelessly all day.
Tony led them the short distance from the elevator to the couches and fell down onto the nearest sofa.
His father talked to him and tried to get him to mess up and reveal something about the future, his maker, or the tech of his suit. Tony caught it every time and chided his dad for every try.
“I was right,” Steve chuckled sadly with a forced smile. “When we first started this, I joked about me not changing personally despite forming a relationship with you…but that obviously is the case now, isn’t it?”
Steve turned in the direction of the priest’s point and they went flying down the road. Father Michael provided more directions and led Steve to another church. As soon as the car rolled to a stop, the priest jumped out and Steve quickly followed.
“That I love you,” Steve finished for him and kissed the grin that blossomed on Tony’s face when he finished his sentence. Their gentle kiss quickly evolved into a passionate one. Tony pulled at his hair and Steve dug his fingertips into his back. One of them moaned and their bodies began to move, pressing into each other and remembering the other’s rhythm.
Tony swallowed this information calmly and put the reactor back in his chest. It clicked in and then he flinched. A wave of sharp, tingling flowed over the majority of his chest as a fresh dose of palladium pushed into him.
“Hey, now,” Tony angrily interrupted and then turned to Steve with a serious expression. “Babe,” Tony said and then grasped his arm and flirted, “You don’t look a day over thirty.”
“Err….” Peter said, feeling awkward. A shadow of the video he watched earlier came to mind and the Youtuber mockingly whispered in his ear, “He’s just doing this for attention.” Peter’s stomach flipped. He didn’t want this.
Tony scrabbled back, clutching the back of his head, and saw the car two down from his was on fire. He bumped into Peggy as he stepped back and saw she had already drawn her pistol.
Steve gave him a level look, but did not press Tony for any more details and, a few moments later, announced, “Done! And it works pretty well!”
survive this,” Steve pressed. “You are Tony Stark. You are amazing. A little shrapnel can’t keep you down!”
“Thank you,” he gasped. He hugged Bucky, not caring how Natasha and Clint will construe it and repeated, “Thank you.”
Venom twisted unpleasantly. It wanted him to run from the Avengers but Steve was in control and Steve stood his ground.
It only had one ring left before it went to voicemail so he quickly answered it with a breathless, "Hello?"
“We’ll call you when it’s lunchtime,” Natasha replied. Stark nodded curtly and spared Steve one last, longing glance before leaving.
“It is really him, Miss Potts. I scanned his facial features and compared him to the ones in the national database.”
Steve squeezed his hand with a small smile before pulling away and seating himself on the opposite side of the workbench.
“This is almost just as important,” Steve murmured indignantly, running his hands over Tony’s chest to rid his suit of any invisible wrinkles.
Steve sat down on the couch and instantly loved it. It must have been the most comfortable thing he ever sat on. He leaned back into the cushions then propped the sketchbook up on his lap. He let his head fall back and he closed his eyes for a moment.
“I’m not going to miss the moopy you,” Cable countered and activated his time glove. Steve smiled brightly at the time traveler and then transferred that smile back to Tony. Steve's tears glistened in the light of the portal opened by the glove. As the bright light surrounded them, Tony whipped those tears away and Steve leaned into his touch with a content sigh. Tony gently pulled him the rest of the way into his arms and closed his eyes.
Tony stared long and hard at the information streaming in on the hologram in front of him and every new piece of information made him feel more numb and detached from his body.
“Of course,” Tony replied. “Take your time. We can customize it however you want. Just let me know, okay?”
From the corner of his eye, he saw a flash of pain cross Steve’s face. Steve dropped his head and whispered, “I wanted to talk to someone about it and I immediately thought of you…”
Natasha curled her fingers into his but was silent for a long time before she finally stated, “Leaving the Academy isn’t so simple.”
With everything he’d seen, the time machine, the Iron Man suit, the arc reactor…the only thing he wanted to know about was what had happened between him and Tony to make his son barely tolerate his presence.
Steve was sitting on the tiled seat in the shower, unable to stand as Tony kneeled between his legs. Steve’s hands were both in his hair and he was holding him like he was the most precious thing on Earth. That alone blew Tony’s mind but adding in the mewling gasps Steve was making…Tony’s brain was just putty at this point.
Norman’s eyes focused on the black mass that he originally thought to be his son’s shadow. The answered dawned on him and he smiled.
Bucky looked around them nervously as Steve explained. With his heart beating anxiously for his friend, Bucky needed Steve to confirm what he was indirectly telling him and asked in a hushed tone, “You a fruit, Stevie?”
“Okay, okay, you’re blushing, it’s something a little more embarrassing… Hmm….were you looking for a picture to put in a locket?” Peter teased and wiggled his rear into Wade’s lap to further torment Wade physically.
Peter touched his chest. It felt silky soft but was so durable he couldn't even feel his heartbeat through it.
Unlike Tony, he had waited behind and listened to the questions that were being asked. The press wanted to know all the intimate details of their relationship, even their sex life. Pepper answered all of the questions diplomatically or avoided them with a masterful redirect.
“Don’t get too close?” Steve repeated, quirking an eyebrow. He walked toward the glass door and quickly opened it. Before anyone could react, Steve threw his shield and sent Mysterio flying back into the smoke. The shield flew back like a boomerang and he held up his arm and the magnets drew it back and caught it.
Steve chuckled as he imagined the sight and rested his head on top of Tony’s. He whispered into his lover’s hair, “No, this is fine…It’s perfect.”
"So, Tony where do you come from?" Monty asked. The British man leaned forward with interest and his background with British Intelligence showed when he observed, "I don't think I've ever seen you around camp before."
. He has nothing to do with us.” Steve’s eyes trailed to Bucky and his impersonal gaze. Bucky was acting like he didn’t even know him and it hurt. What happened to him? Steve’s heart broke and he stated, “Neither of them do.”
Bucky wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and his tiny friend curled into his side. He had never displayed such vulnerability to Bucky before and he kept his lips sealed tight about it.
“B-Brooklyn,” Steve replied, flinching a little as he shined the light in his other eye. “Brooklyn, New York…My head feels fine, Dr. Pavlov.”
Wade nibbled on Peter's skin on the side of his inner thigh and teased, “You're wearing a watch that is broken.”
She twisted the broken arc reactor from his chest and pulled out the internal wiring with a quick jerk. Tony hissed from the sharp burst of pain and Pepper whispered, “Sorry, sorry. Okay, ew, here I go.” With the new unit in hand, Pepper used her tiny hands to reach into his chest cavity and plugged in the new reactor. The instant it was connected, Tony’s chest pain lessened by half and he felt renewed. He inhaled sharply and felt like he was getting sufficient oxygen for the first in years. His chest ached reminding him that he shouldn’t abuse his lungs too much.
Steve rubbed his arms and whispered, “There is nothing to be sorry about. You went through an ordeal…we all did. Hell, I’m probably a little bit I’m shock too, that’s why I can’t stop touching you…I need to assure myself you’re here...”
When Steve took the lead back to base, Tony followed him close behind and then stared at Steve as if he was seeing him for the first time.
Steve wordlessly grasped the clasp to Tony’s jeans and then dragged him closer to the edge. Tony laughed as Steve drew him nearer but then he bit down on his lips as Steve bent down and lightly kissed the exposed skin just below his navel.
Tony continued, “Ben came as soon as he found out what happened. He’s been with Peter ever since but he’s scared. Pete saw you get hurt. He didn’t understand why you left…I don’t understand why you left,” Tony added gruffly, his last two statements bordered on anger.
Steve would not try anything risky with Peter so he went for the direct approach. He stepped out of his room and walked only a few feet before getting stopped by one of the personnel.
Tony murmured, “It was a dream, Steve. C’mere.” He pulled Steve into an embrace and sighed contently when Steve lay his head on Tony’s chest. “No boogeyman is gonna pull me out of your arms,” Tony promised. “No one is strong enough to pull me away from you, super soldier. You’re stuck with me for life.”
How did that get here? Had he put it there before the Ten Rings? Or maybe Pepper or Rhodey had found it when he was in captivity and, over time, had forgotten to tell him about it?
or what it did to Tony. On that exact date, every year, Tony could not hold back and was usually piss-ass drunk by the end of the night...
Wade smiled, loving the nerd showing in his baby boy even at this moment, and he whispered, “No, remember the night of your birthday, the night before Venom…” Peter’s smile shrunk a little and he nodded. Wade continued, “You brought up coming out…to the world… and we decided to wait…” Wade felt Peter tense beneath him as his words were finally making sense to him.
“My birth?” Peter asked, raising a single brow in confusion. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you are talking about…Was I born under a symbolic heroic eclipse or something?”
Pepper hit the button in front of her and the enormous reactor in front of them started to shoot off lightening and rumbled.
There was a small vibration in the floor as the bay doors opened for Steve’s ship. He wouldn’t have noticed it if he had been paying attention to it.
Out of spite, Tony was so tempted to shoot Howard down like he had done to Tony time and time again. Growing up, it’d been Tony’s dream to work with his father but the man never gave him a chance, stating the work was too important for Tony to help.
“Don't stop-,” Peter breathlessly gasped into his ear. The sound went straight to Wade’s dick along with the rest of the blood in his body.
Steve’s other blue eye appeared as Steve slowly dropped his hands. Steve murmured, “I’m sorry…I didn’t realize. This – with you Tony – I’m fine with it. I’m obviously more than fine with it,” Steve added with a roll of his eyes as he waved in the direction of his erection. He smiled diminutively at Tony and said, “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me. Promise to tell me if anything is bothering you, alright?”
Wade continued to sleep and breathe evenly, completely unaware that Peter was being strangled right next to him.
“Do you remember when we first met? When our soul implants went off? We were going to kill each other but you stopped us. You wanted a soulmate. You wanted something for yourself. You want us, to love, to be happy…and we were.”
“He has work to do far away,” Steve whispered to his son. He closed his sketchbook and gently reached out to touch the side of Peter’s face. His cheek was round and soft beneath his fingers.
They brought Howard over to a workbench and reassured his workers he was fine. Steve used the clipboard to fan him and Bucky paced behind him.
Schmidt’s other foot rose and slammed between Steve’s shoulder blades, pressing him deeper down onto the shoe. Schmidt murmured, “Like you mean it, Captain. You do want your soulmate to survive this, don’t you?”
Steve timidly removed his shield with numb fingers. Over the communicator, Tony yelled, “DO NOT GO WITH HIM!”
Tony nodded and grasped Steve’s hand to lead him outside. He wore an easy smile and held Steve close. In his head, the song had lodged itself inside and was playing on repeat almost mockingly.
A Latin American, middle aged woman and her son stepped out of the deli with a stuffed brown bag. With the serum, Steve’s sense of smell was extraordinary and he could scent the sandwiches they had ordered. He smelled the crisp lettuce, the ripe tomatoes, the rich sausage, fresh turkey and ham, and the various condiments sprinkled on with an odd assortment of smells. His stomach gurgled.
Wade had been worried how Peter was going to react to morning after such a disaster of a dinner. But, after Peter’s eyes slowly trailed up his body and finally latched onto to his eyes with full blown lust in his gaze, well, Wade’s fear quickly evaporated.
Behind the chair was a huge circular tower that had many wires and bulbs and things that looked like solar panels and Tony could only guess at its purpose. Wires from all of the terminals fed into this machine.
“We’re fine! Thanks for asking!” Steve retorted and he felt Tony’s body shake as he chuckled. Steve gulped and paused to get a handle on his physical reaction and then continued, “Everyone else good?”
Steve jumped in front of the Tyler’s swing and shifted over Tony to block him from further attack with his own body. She sliced his cheek and then immediately flinched back, shocked to having cut Steve. She probably never intended on hurting him as she was so enamored with him.
. Jarvis would have probably been a little more sarcastic in the retort but Tony knew if he asked Vision that the android’s reply would be just as rational and would do nothing to distract Tony from his nerves.
His brows pinched together tightly as he held back more tears and Tony gasped, “I love you so much.”
“I should go back,” Tony murmured to himself as he paced in Steve’s apartment in Washington D.C. SHIELD had given him the place to have while on call in the district.
Peter urged and tugged on his leg. Now that he was done kissing Tony, Peter clearly saw it as his turn for affection. Steve chuckled and picked him up. Both he and Tony pressed a kiss onto either side of his face and Peter giggled madly.
“What!?” Howard whined, “They need to expand the group’s abilities, not their numbers! I’m just trying to ascertain Edwards’ worth!”
He only broke his eyes from Tony’s when the detective grabbed his arm and began to pull him down the hill of rubble. Reporters swarmed in and Steve held his head high as they captured his disgrace and bombarded him with questions.
Forget this new AI being secretive, their future was laid out before them in a collage of framed photos on the wall.
Together, the three of them went to where the rest of the Commandos were. Bucky wasn’t too thrilled to see Steve awake. Unsurprisingly, Steve and Tony’s eyes locked and stayed so as the distance dwindled between them.
Tony was usually quiet when someone came up to Steve but, as soon as they were alone, Tony was chattering away again. Steve found himself leaning closer to Tony as he talked, enjoying his company and easy candor.
“Kissing my soulmate, isn’t it obvious?” Tony retorted, angrily. “We were meant to be together! I don’t see the point in denying it any longer!”
Tony had created the time traveling devices in order to save their son, a son they had adopted to create a family, a family that wouldn’t have been possible if they hadn’t fallen in love, and…they’d never had fallen in love if Tony hadn’t been thrown back into the past…and that was only possible because Tony had invented time travel to save their son!
Peter was rubbing the tears from his eyes. A light smile was on his lips as he watched his family banter.
“We can’t,” Steve agreed in a hushed whispered. He would not let that happen again to himself or anyone else. Knowing the machine Tony had used was still out there was frightening enough. That was at least in SHIELD’s hands.
Tony sighed overdramatically and said, “I guess I can forgive you. A genius like myself is used to dealing with idiots all the time…" He paused and his expression became serious as he asked, "But if Bucky shows up tomorrow and confesses his undying love for you, are you going to leave me? Because if that’s the case I do not want to become anymore emotionally invested than I already am.” Tony kept up his bravado until the last statement when his voice quavered just a bit at the end. He cleared his throat and said, “I’m a businessman. I need to know I’m making a solid investment here. I’m no longer the blasé playboy I used to be.”
“We’ll do it again and again and again, in whatever way you want,” Wade promised. “You have me, baby boy.”
With an amused smile, Steve watched Tony as he wildly waved his arms around, trying to speak to Jacques with the basic French he knew.
It turned to Tony, a second before impact, and shrieked defiantly at him. Yet when Tony turned his thrusters on the monster its shrieks of defiance quickly turned into shrieks of agony.
His target looked from Iron Man and then back to the Soldier. Her light green eyes focused on him and he felt the sudden urge to wrap his hands around her throat again.
In one ear, she had a direct line of the police feed running nonstop. She heard the call for backup on the hostage situation and, when Stark did not appear on stage several seconds later, she rolled her eyes and swung her rifle around and pointed it down the street with the action.
Tony made a scoffing noise and snuggled deeper into his husband’s side to show him how smothering he could be.
Steve and Tony leaned onto the boxing ring’s cord railing, both slumping into each other’s sides. Their eyes were as focused as Peter’s on the couple. Steve reached out and tightly grasped Tony’s forearm. He hoped this would work…
The VIP section was roped off and the entrance to the private room was guarded by two big burly men. Peter walked straight up to the door and they immediately blocked his way.
His heart felt too heavy to beat and only felt heavier as he thought of his boyfriend. How was he going to explain this to him??
Bucky sat up and craned his neck to see what it was Natasha was threatening to expose. Upon seeing the box, he grinned and asked Natasha, “When did you find it? I came across it last Wednesday.”
The imposter dropped his head and his entire form began to change. His body shrunk and his face paled and became a light silver. Steve’s face turned into a featureless metal mask, two dark blue eyes glared at them from slits in the mask.
Steve flinched again and bit down on his lips. He could not lie to Tony but he could not hurt him either...
I will not be posting a chapter title this time because I don't know if I will be able to get it all into one chapter! XD
He felt like he was being crushed by the same oppressive force that caught him. He could barely breathe. Tony felt like he took what he thought would be his last breaths being forcibly pushed out of his lungs…
Steve surged forward, pushed the mad woman away, took the few steps needed to reach Tony’s side, and collapsed to his knees beside his prone body. Hot blood soaked into his trousers in seconds and the breath constricted in his chest upon the feeling.
“Got it,” the President replied. He and the agent buckled themselves into their seats and went right back to their discussion.
“Your honeymoon isn’t coming soon enough,” Peter sighed. After being married for over a year the two decided they were ready to finally go. They were waiting until January which was statistically the slowest month for the Avengers for some reason. Peter hypothesized it was because villains’ New-Year’s Resolution must be to be good and they only last the month before they go back to their old ways…
At the moment, his dad was sitting across from him, wearing a worried expression and making no moves to touch the food Aunt May put in front of him.
Sorry for all the delay for this last chapter! It is finally here and it's HUGE! So much time continuum to squeeze in...so little time.
Pepper went to bed after that and Tony showed Bucky to the room that would be his from now on. Bucky had already seen the room on the tour but, when Tony told him it was his, Bucky walked around the room, taking it all in again. All of the bedrooms were on the second floor, overlooking the infinity pool and the ocean but the shutters were still down so the room seemed very locked in to Tony. He assured Bucky, “Once you feel comfortable enough, we’ll raise the shutters and you’ll have a great view…”
Steve was ready to throw himself between them if they got physical or jump in to stop the eventual argument.
Tony’s eyes pinched in sorrow and he needed a moment to collect himself. Steve held him and patiently waited. Tony pressed himself closer into Steve’s embrace and buried his face into the crook of Steve’s neck. His fever burned hotly into Steve’s flesh and Steve drew the blanket off of both of them, hoping to cool him down.
Peter and Steve laughed and the small family turned to the rest of the gathered party in the room. Peter greeted the gathered Avengers and Pepper. His dad was glued to his side and shared in all the conversations Peter had with his teammates and extended family.
“Jarvis, please take Captain Rogers to his floor and deny him access to my apartment and the workshop,” Tony stated, his back to Steve.
– is he doing here?” Steve gasped, taking several steps back to separate himself from his son. Venom moved with renewed interest against his skin and Steve felt all its attentions focus on Peter.
Tony’s heart hurt a little at the thought but he pushed it aside as he was escorted into the building. They ended up in an empty service hallway and his escort came to a halt.
They hadn’t left each other’s sides since the first meeting. Steve never felt so happy and ecstatic in his life. It had been over a month since that faithful day and he couldn’t believe how much they had changed since then. Steve could actually imagine starting to construct a future with the man beside him.
Steve gently grasped his chin and turned Tony’s heard toward him. Steve’s bright blue eyes searched his and he finally murmured, “You’re in shock still.”
“Bed,” Steve agreed, his hands shaking. He could not believe they were finally going to do this. For all his strength, he felt helpless in Tony’s arms. Tony had dozens of partners already and Steve was totally inexperienced and was totally oblivious to the secrets of making love to a man. He had an idea about doing so with a woman, in the army it was all men seemed to talk about, but having sex with a man was something completely different. He wanted to do it but he feared disappointing Tony.
Taking the cue, Steve said to Gibbons, “I have to confirm some things with Sneaky. Why don’t you find the rest of the guys in your battalion and see how they’re doing? I’ll catch up with you later.”
Steve shrugged and murmured, “All we knew was we were going to have a son…we didn’t know when it was going to happen or how…His parents died in the attack.”
Steve rubbed his eyes and took several deep breaths to get his emotions under control. When the doors opened, Steve squared his shoulders and put on a brave face.
Fury shook his head and said, “You were going to be brought in for questioning for suspected terrorism.”
A gear shuddered then stopped without the support of the shell. The computer screen went black and a sudden shrill sound emulated from the console.
When Steve finally pulled back, he sniffed loudly and lightly pressed a few kisses on top of Tony’s head.
As Steve was catching his breath with deep ragged gasps, his cock sprang back up with renewed attention.
Steve’s head bounced from the shaking but he continued to slumber. Tony dropped his head on Steve’s chest with a groan, “I can’t believe I’m going to do this…” He lifted his head and cupped Steve’s jaw. He stated, “Alright, princess, I’m going to kiss you and, if it wakes you up, I will forever call you Sleeping Beauty.” He paused to see if the threat was enough to stir Steve but the man remained inert so Tony pressed a kiss into his mouth. Steve’s lips were lax but Tony tried several different angles and even licked the bottom of his top lip the way Steve liked. Steve didn’t move and Tony eventually stopped kissing him and pulled back. He hopefully peered at Steve’s face but nothing had changed.
Steve said to Tony and Pepper, “I’ll explain everything that’s happened while they were gone, how about you two continue where we left off?”
“All the tests show that, the protoplasm, our DNA, and VENOM have all synthesized almost perfectly!” Eddie whispered, smiling giddily at the beaker containing their solution.
Nervously fiddling with the buttons on his shirt, the Hydra agent glanced uneasily at the Americans and then looked to Tony. He stated, “The Red Skull invested in many new technologies that could be used to expand our influence which was why we created this machine. We wanted to be able to alter the outcome of past battles to our favor or snatch superior weapons from the
He did not have much time left so sleeping seemed like a waste of time…but he couldn’t bring himself to leave Tony’s side.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and he assured her, “I’ve only changed for the better. With the Avengers, I am saving the world and helping people more often than I used to with charities. It’s what Peter aspires to do too.”
Steve sighed heavily, taking her words to heart. This had gone too far. They should have stopped at part one but…Steve just wanted his friends to be happy. But maybe somethings were not meant to be. He agreed, “You’re right. I promise, Natasha. We will stop.”
Tony turned to his husband, about to argue the fact that Peter was with Deadpool, but stopped himself. Steve didn't know he had Friday keeping tabs on Peter. He had even pushed for Tony to let Peter have his space…but, with all Peter was going through, and now with Deadpool in the mix, how was he supposed to not be involved??
Dear God, yes. Yes, he was. It was like a hollow feeling inside him that grew every time they paced him inside the machine. Not that he’d ever admit it to the Red Skull.
"But we made do..." Natasha said. "We returned the last stone in 1965, but were out of juice. We played house for a couple of weeks and imagined we might end up living the rest of our lives from that point."
Steve looked up to Tony and using his eyes he pleaded to let him take care of his addled friend. Tony threw back his head with a groan and clutched Peter tighter to his chest as he murmured, “God, those eyes and to top it off with the injuries…
Bruce went back to analyzing his data and Tony drew Steve to his lab as they awaited any results their friend could come up with. They cuddled on the couch and both of them actively avoided looking at Peter’s workstation.
Tony punched him and then drew back his fist to punch the bastard again but Natasha grabbed his arm.
Jacques grinned and must have understood enough of what Tony said as he reached across the table and said, "
“Thank you,” Clint said and hung up. He frowned at the phone as he felt guilty for what he had to do. He swallowed it and called back Coulson.
Primarily, its timer counts down to the moment soulmates first make eye contact. If their eyes don’t meet, then the timer will not stop or go off. Soulmates can unknowingly be in communication for years before their eyes meet. Some of the top romantic comedies use this prompt in their movies.
Steve and Tony broke apart and Steve shot a glare to his best friend. With a smile, he retorted, “I will but you just ruined our moment, you jerk!”
Short chapter tonight but tomorrow y'all will get a mega chapter and a new relationship tag. I wonder who it could be? :D
Tony stooped his head to kiss Peter’s scalp. He was planning on only a single kiss but kept kissing the top of his head, unable to stop giving him affection.
“Fine,” he groaned and sat up. He rubbed his eyes and yawned. As soon as his hands were free, Pepper shoved her paperwork into them.
Natasha and Bucky faced off and began to circle one another. For a few tense moments, they only looked at each other. Then Bucky’s finger twitched and they flew at each other in a blink of an eye.
“Guess who’s made it to the party,” Peter announced in a light voice to not draw attention to himself.
“What are we waiting for?” Peter asked with a husky voice. Wade’s entire body shuddered and Peter grinned wickedly at him. Peter proceeded to crawl down Wade’s body, pressing kisses into his skin every time one of his legs scooted back. Wade watched breathlessly as Peter got closer and closer to his bulging crotch. Peter's fingers undid the top button and he kissed the patch of skin beneath.
All he knew was that the Iron Man suit would be waiting for them here. From the little Tony had told him, he knew it had been sent here to conserve power, but they never discussed how to turn it back on. He always assumed Tony would be awake to do it…
Steve exited the elevator looking extremely amused and asked, “Are we really going to dance because I feel like we are one step away from having sex.” He motioned to their both being half dressed.
Tony seemed to get what was up and murmured, “Hey, hey, big guy, I…I’m grateful too. No need to hide it.” Steve picked up his head and tucked his face next to Tony’s. Tony’s eyes were so warm and loving and it was all directed at Steve. This was all so unreal and amazing that it had to be a dream. Tony flushed and murmured, “Can you be any more remarkable?”
“Did you forget the bit when I told you there is no other element I could use for my core?” Tony asked dryly, referring to their conversation right before he pulled out the arc reactor.
But, most importantly, after getting to know him these past ten days, Tony could call him a friend and Steve did the same of him.
“We just got him,” Natasha replied, lightly touching the communicator to activate it. “But we have to get out now. Does it look like they have most of their forces out there still?”
started to play over the speakers. Peter picked up his head with a furrowed brow and loud sniffles. Tony gently swayed the boy the song’s beat and gently crooned the song to Peter. Peter quietened down and lay his head against Tony’s chest.
Peter’s lips upturned into a coy smile against Wade’s lips. The younger man shifted wantonly beneath him and then grasped Wade’s hips before driving his own hips up and pressing their sexes together with repeated thrusts.
He foggily remembered a fall and reaching out to Steve but, even though he barely remembered it, he was positive that Steve had no fault in it. Either way, Schmidt probably tormented Steve about what had happened to James.
“Peter!” Dad gasped in suprise, grabbing onto Peter’s waist with his good hand. Peter flinched under his touch and pushed him away. In his half-awake state, Peter thought it was Venom who was grabbing him.
He could feel Venom in his mind, listening to his thoughts. Peter’s thoughts eventually dwindled and turned inward to focus on Venom. The symbiote was waiting for him and when he had Peter’s attention, murmured, “You wanted to save people like your sire. We can do that.”
"I wished that Clint received the soul stone no matter what. I had planned on using the Mind Stone like Loki had and make Clint believe he saw a dead Natasha..." Bucky sighed heavily and whispered, "I thought I could handle the snap....but I was in so much pain that I couldn't save her...so I had to go back again. But then the Red Skull tried to stop me and well...It took a few tries. But I eventually caught her and Clint was transported clear away with the stone and the Red Skull was too busy dealing with my past self to stop me."
Steve would bring it up again later and be adorably nervous about it because they had never discussed marriage before but Steve was right. They
Two pots later, Steve was sipping on what he decided would be his final mug as the father tapped his chin and stared at Steve with assessing eyes.
“I’m going to get better,” Steve soothed. He gently touched Peter’s leg and his boy flinched from the texture of the bandages.
“Tony, Natasha attacked him for complementing her eyes. What do you think she will do if he tried to kiss her!?” Steve gasped and Bucky grunted in agreement.
The others had their codenames as headers for their files. Dr. Banner’s had been “Hulk” and Buck’s was “Captain America.”
Tony wanted to get the scan over with before Steve got home. After the whole Mandarin fiasco, he and Steve had gotten into their first real fight since they’d reunited. Steve had obviously been upset that mercenaries tried to kidnap their son, had managed to destroy their home, and then very nearly kill his fiancé all in one day. Both of them were actively trying to fix it and every day it got a little better.
Tony watched them go uneasily. Watching them was a constant reminder of what Schmidt was doing to Steve…and that his soulmate may very well be like Barnes by the time they reached him.
Bucky nodded and Tony murmured, “I need to take the arm off to finish it.” Bucky nodded again and held his arm out to Tony to remove.
“What kind of drugs are they pumping in me?” Tony asked. He felt pretty good, better than he had in weeks.
Steve tried to stay by Tony’s side but he kept getting involved in side conversations or being pulled away. One moment he’d be standing next to Tony, talking to some of the firefighters and, the next, he’d suddenly note Tony was on the other side of the room with hundreds of people between them.
“It is made with alien components,” Peter retorted. “They must be skewing the scent… Now, Logan, not that I don’t appreciate your lovely demeanor this early in the morning nor your interest in my suit, but I was very comfortable in Wade’s arms a moment ago and would very much like to return to that position…”
“Pep, take a seat and drink some coffee. We’ve got quite the story to tell you,” Tony stated as he clapped her shoulder. He smiled at Steve with his eyes dancing and Steve could not help but return the smile.
Jarvis must have been watching him again. Tony flushed to himself, knowing why Jarvis chose to make his appearance now of all times.
called Steve “beloved” or any other sweet name. His heart skipped a beat and he could not stop the smile that instantly grew on his face. He wanted to kiss Tony right there again and make Tony’s legs feel as shaky as Steve’s were.
A flush grew on Steve’s cheeks and he said, “I just found you lying in a pool of alcohol and found out you have a nineteen-year-old son. We are
Peter chuckled and shook his head before replying, “I support them. In fact, I’m very happy for them.”
Natasha relaxed slightly and said, “Good. You will need to help me convince Tony, it’s going to take a lot more than my lecture to stop him.”
He smiled at his suit and then asked Jarvis, “How likely do you think Rhodey would make me a Captain?”
“I’m twenty-one,” Peter said and pulled his ID out of his breast pocket. He put it there for easy access, knowing this would happen.
The Tesseract was in the machine and it was on and glowing. Howard had everyone sitting at stations that read levels of input and output and they’d notify him if anything looked wrong. Howard himself simply stood in front of the machine and watched his son climb up the ledge and onto the gaudy chair. He practically fell into it and then glanced around him. He turned the numbered dials on the dias in front of him to the proper year and then paused. He looked around him, probably looking for where to go from there. His bulky, gauntleted arm luckily bumped into the lever beside the chair and Tony was thrown back into the seat by an unseen force.
“There’s a photo of us from last night,” his dad explained with a sad sigh. “When we left together. Someone must have been in the garage. We’re both smiling and, according to Steve, when we do that we look like twins, which I think is ridiculous because I am clearly the more handsome between the two of us.”
“Not here, it’s rare and costs a pretty penny. The Russians used to be the go to guys for the metal, but supplies have dwindled since the war started…Why do you need it, Cap? Want to make your shield shinier?”
Tony picked up the prints when they were done and held them between them so both of them could inspect their work.
“Mmm,” Wade moaned. He reached for his lover, wanting him back in his embrace but Peter was already out of the bed. His boyfriend probably had to piss so Wade took the chance to stretch and readjust himself on the bed.
Tony turned his head and lightly kissed the side of Steve’s jaw. He murmured, “Time to go to bed, my beloved husband.”
Tony made a face, wishing Peter had chosen to skip work. How much longer was Peter going to go there? The whole point of the internship was as a cover for him to see Tony without raising any questions. He could start working in the real labs now and no one would question it. He’d talk to Peter about it later…and maybe he’d find a way to bring up Deadpool, but, for now he had time on his hands and a new husband waiting for him at home.
His uncle groaned and whispered to himself, “Why couldn’t I have lost a leg and been given a robotic engine turbine for a limb?”
Wanda had a fine sheen of sweat on her forehead by the time she was done. She grinned despite her exhaustions and turned to the camera she knew they were watching her from and announced, “We’re good to go!”
“Let’s go, Steve,” Tony grumbled and placed his hand on Steve’s back to guide him away. Steve went compliantly, with his head drooped.
Blood immediately filled her mouth and she grinned up at him as her white teeth turned pink. It struck him dumb as memories flooded him.
“Guys, we sorta have a tiny glove sized problem,” Wade said as he slowed to a stop in the gathering.
Steve was too shocked to speak or move. Just a moment ago, he was ecstatic. Tony confessed to loving him. And now…He dumbly repeated, “R-Rape?”
“Speak with our psychiatrist, let us draw some blood, and get a full workup on you,” Coulson said, the Captain’s reply was encouraging. The Captain nodded and Coulson jumped to his feet and before he could change his mind, stated, “Alright, we’ll bring in the psychiatrist right now.”
Wade’s mouth tasted of sharp, bitter metal. It was another reminder of the pain he put him through. He gasped into Wade’s mouth, “I’m so sorry.”
“What mask? I don’t see any mask,” Wade retorted, tossing his mask aside and pushing Peter down onto the full length of the backseat. “I just see one very sexy spider with a tarantula sized dick.”
“We’re hugging and leaning side to side,” Steve replied dryly but his smile remained. The dancing was nice and created a bubbly, happy feeling within him.
Tony suddenly encased Peter in a tight hug, knocking the words and breath right out of him. Peter tensed in his hold and started to shake as he became overcome by emotion.
“I was just hit by an EMP, it fried my suit but didn’t hurt me. I couldn’t move because the suit was too heavy.”
“It’s time,” he stated, feeling…numb? No, there was fear. He could sense it, but it was enough to just tighten his throat. He had time to acclimate to the knowledge.
“I know,” Steve said, smiling widely at Tony. He smoothed out the shoulders of Tony’s suit again and Tony chuckled.
“We can't just not doing anything!” Tony yelled. “We should rush in there and try to stop it before it starts strangling Peter again!”
“What am I, a child??” Peter demanded, “What’s with the parental control? Why can’t I go on the internet??”
Steve was the world’s perfect super soldier and scientists still vied for a sample to study. Upon his death, he had been sent several communications asking to donate the remainder of his husband’s body to science from both reputable and unreputable sources. He destroyed every single message. He knew it was a very good possibility that someone would be desperate enough to dig up Steve but he could not believe they had done it
Bucky cleaned up the mess with the broom and dust pan and then returned to the couch with his perplexed expression still in place. Pepper gathered all the fragile art pieces she could and stored them in her room for safekeeping before returning to the couch and grabbing a slice of pizza.
Deep into the building, behind many layers of personal and security, they came upon the defrosting chamber of Captain Steven G. Rogers.
There was a long pause as the robot regarded his question. He and Bucky traded glances. What was the machine contemplating?
Tony shivered and Steve moved into action. He gently pulled himself from Tony’s side and then sprinted across the room and dug an emergency blanket out of the closet. He then ran back to Tony and carefully settled next to him. He draped the blanket over both of them and then snuggled close to his boyfriend.
Steve broke the kiss and drew back from Tony. He left his hands in his hair and kept his back bent so he could keep looking at him in the eyes. In the days since the disaster of their first date, Steve and Tony had been stealing kisses and fleeting touches in between the mayhem of the search for Bucky. Steve was tempted to throw Tony on the couch and take off where they left off and forget about the madness surrounding them. The buzzing noises from Peter's workstation was deterrent enough to stop him from doing that in front of his son.
Steve shook his head and murmured, “Nothing…Unless you can bring me back to life…absolutely nothing.”
Tony’s heart leapt into his throat and it remained lodged there as he lifted both his hands and pointed them at the Soldier. His repulsors whined loudly as he charged them as quickly as possible to full power.
Tony sat beside him on the tiny couch, his leg pressing into Steve’s thigh, and he lightly rubbed circles into Steve’s back. He wanted it too but he easily accepted they could not tell it. It did not bother him to the extent it was bothering Steve. Perhaps it was because he was used to always using a different face with the media. Steve never before lied to them. He was always open and honest and having to lie, especially about their relationship, must have been taxing. Tony whispered, “Just a little longer, baby…”
“I've been feeling like the third wheel for like an hour now. I think it's time for me to turn in. Goodnight fellas.”
Steve snorted and a relaxed silence fell between them. Steve's hands were gentle as they spread the bandages and smoothed them down in a nearly never-ending touch.
“Do we have any intel on who breached the building?” Steve asked as he followed the rest of the team to the elevator.
“…Then I’m lucky you haven’t pulled the trigger,” Natasha replied evenly. Her outward countenance was indifferent but, internally, she was berating herself for such a rookie mistake and was trying to formulate a way to get out of this. The man behind her was a professional. He’d snuck behind her without alerting her to his presence until he wanted her to know. He was either a contract killer or…
“CONGRATULATIONS CAPTAIN!” Thor exclaimed joyfully and picked up Steve in a constricting hug that tucked Steve’s arms into his sides, lifted his feet off the ground, and left him with no avenue of escape.
“Okay,” he whispered to Tony. Steve looked to Peter, still on the wall, and said, “I’m going to leave my card here, call anytime.” He slid a business card out of his pocket and put it on the sofa.
“I can connect Master Rogers to the same feed I am connected to in your suit, Sir. He will be aware of the battle at all times and will be able to communicate with you.”
Steve ran his hand through his hair and replied, “Yeah, Tony wanted a few more words with him…What will you be teaching him today?”
Steve turned to Tony and said, “Thanks, Tony, but you did not have to do this. The old couch was fine.”
Gasping and panting in each other’s air. They were staring at each other like they had never really seen each other until that moment.
