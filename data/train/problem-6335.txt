Sure they use to date, but Tony knows it was too much for her to handle with him being iron man and she thought if he broke up with him maybe just being back to friends would be easier to handle. He wished things have gone better between them, but they are still friends just not as close as they use to be and Tony knows it’s his fault maybe he should be the one to reach out first.
“You don’t like that Stark is in your team, whys that doesn’t he provide the weaponry and security that you need” he ask calmly.
Why does Rogers have to be a pain in Tony’s ass, why couldn’t he be thankful that beat the bad guys quickly, why does he have to shout at him.
But, even though he does feel guilt, he doesn’t however feel any regret. When him and Stark had sex, Steve never felt anything like that before, the rush, lust,  the passion. It wasn’t like he had before not with those girls he slept with before and after the serum. And back in the 40s he did had a quickie with a couple of the men who were also in the army, who just wanted to feel something other than pain. And this was different when he slept with Peggy. With Peggy it was passion they made love and he definitely loved her more than anything.
Tobias was up about an hour ago, he had a shower, got dressed and then went to the kitchen expecting his dad to be there, which wasn’t a surprise as his dad was more of a night owl than a early bird. But for some reason something was odd, since last night when his dad came over looking terrified and that scared Him as well.
But Steve didn’t seem to understand the meaning of just shutting up, “oh come on Natasha what I said was true” he spat and by saying that Tobias was ready to strike him again “don’t you dare!” He growled as he lunges forward but Tony manages to stop him, by holding on to his arm. “Don’t Toby it’s not worth it, please stop before you get hurt” He pleas with sad eyes.
Sorry it took so long been very busy at work and stuff but I finally finish this chapter so I hope you like it
Please feel free to comment or kudos
“Sorry to interrupt, but I’m gladly to inform you that Agent Barton, Romanoff and Master Thor are on there way back from the hospital” Jarvis tells them and everyone sighs in relief.
Steve thoughts about the incident with stark and how will it affect them in the future.
Bruce was shock and terrified “how’s Natasha is she alright and what about Clint?” He quickly asks, “I have received a message from Master Thor and Agent Barton, he and Agent Romanoff are fine and are headed at the hospital and nothing of major concern” Jarvis informs everyone.
Steve took a deep breath, then he opens the door. As he walks in, he could see thor sitting on the couch eating some pop tarts.
So many thoughts was going through his mind, what will Fury say to them? What should he say to his mom? Why did Natasha defend him? What will the avengers say to him now? Too many questions, too many thoughts. Too many, too many, too many, too....
~~~~~~~~~
Thor gave him a serious look “don’t think that finding your soul is easy Anthony, it might weeks even years to find your soul. Not only that if you go too deep into your safe place then you might lose yourself and stay there forever, it is dangerous doing this, but your different and I believe that you can do this. So are you sure you still want to do this?” Thor ask
Lily stepped closer to him like she didn’t want anyone else to hear her words “it’s Daniel, he somehow escape prison” she bluntly said. Tony whole body stop, what it-it can’t be how?, why didn’t no one tell him? This has to be a lie, “your lying” He sneer, grab her shoulders tightly and yelled “YOUR LYING” He panic. Lily was crying again “I’m telling you the truth, he came to me a few days ago, trying to convince me to join his side again I told him no and he threatened to kill me if I didn’t. He said he killed the other men who raped you that night too as they didn’t join his cause, but I manage to get away from him as my husband was near by and we were in a public place before he could do anything to me” she cried in pain as Tony squeeze her shoulders even tighter.
Wait, what tony thought, “um Thor, buddy What do you mean by training?” Tony nervously ask.
“Bucky... bucky were are you”
“Please Steve just stop being an asshole ok, look I know you hate me and you think Im disgusting, but can you honestly say that I’m capable of murder” he plead hoping Steve would just back off.
(See the end of the chapter for
A slut even. Since I gave you some pleasure now it’s my turn” Rogers thrust  into tony as soon a finished his sentence.
~~~~~~~~
“STARK”
Tony chuckled with no humour in it “Yeah no shit, that’s what you keep saying but yet I’m not improving maybe because I can’t connect with my soul” he spoke bitterly looking away from Thor you was opposite him in the forest of rebirth.
(Few hours later)
“Of course sir”
Thor does like Anthony, he likes to think they are brothers in arms. He knows that Anthony is hurting in some way and he will make sure that he will get to the heart of Anthony’s pain and vanquished it.
Rogers gave him a cruel smirk “you never suffer, you don’t know what it’s like to be a person, your just an outsider. you look down on people while the rest of us come together and help each others pain, you think your special but your not” Rogers spat.
Pepper froze in shock from Tony’s outburst, Tony felt a little guilty to shout at Pepper like that so he quickly explain why he’s leaving “It’s Tobias, I need to go” he said with worry. Peppers eyes widen and nodded as knew that Tobias is the most important person in Tony’s life and he always comes first.
This was bad, was this an attack from Daniels part? What were they planning? “Right thanks J we go now” He said and was ready to suit up. But Thor and Steve stop him “Tony wait this could be a trap thy might want you there or even worse they might come to the tower and hurt your family” Steve spoke with haste. Tony didn’t want to hear this he needed to help “Look I should be there if Daniel was going to ambush us there I’ll be in my suit I’ll be ready” he tried to argue “and what about your family Anthony hey need here” Thor counters.
“You call your ability a different name, well everyone around earth calls it differently it’s hard to determine what was the original, but you named it wolf sense, ulvfølelse. You know were im from wolves have a variety of different meanings like chaos or warrior depends what you read I guess” Thor informed him.
Hope you all are having a great day 😊
Tony didn’t know what to say to that, his soul, tranquility what was thor on about. But Tony’s wants to learn so he sat down on the grass floor as well.
~~~~~~~
“I gotta go mom, but I’ll se you in a few days so you won’t miss me too much” he joke. Peggy gave a small chuckle at her sons attempt, “Darling I know you don’t like your birthdays but I like to give you something that you might like to have, I get someone to send it to you” she said.
What do you think? How do you think that they know Tony’s abilities?
Clint quickly followed “Wait Nat shouldn’t we wait for cap?” He asked her. But she didn’t stop and kept on going “No we don’t, beside I don’t think Steve came here for the same reason we were, come on let’s go” she said. Clint wanted to wait for Cap, but Natasha was right in a way he did notice that Cap was quiet whilst they were in there, so he’s definitely came here for a different reason. Without continuing to ponder Clint rush up to Natasha and he hope that Steve gets the answer that he wanted.
Natasha was looking around the burned car, to what the two spies were told, the Marks were killed before the car was burned, so someone wanted to burn any evidence.
“ sorry guys but I need to think over some stuff and I need to go and speak with fury I need to clear up some things” he announces.
(Sigh) “Jarvis” steve spoke
(See the end of the chapter for
“An explosion happen at the crime scene were currently Agent Barton and Agent Romanoff are located, there’s hasn’t been an word on there condition or what caused the explosion Director Fury has send more agents to the seen but no word as of yet” JARVIS spoke quickly.
“You were never a good father, I remember everything. The cold shoulder, the disapproval looks, the drunken shouts, hell the damn time you almost hit me but lucky for you Fury was there before you did it. But worst of all you left me, when I needed you the most, I was fucking ganged raped and you left me for HIM!!” Tony shouts knowing who he meant.
Without warning Rogers pulled out and carefully uncurled Tony’s legs off his waist and placed them down on the ground. Tony can feel Rogers cum leaking out of him he doesn’t if he should turned on by it or be disgusted.
Bruce in the end guides Steve to the conference room where the meeting was held. As Steve opens the door, he sees Fury standing by the screen projecting blue prints, whilst the other Avengers and including Peggy, Tobias and Davis sitting around the table.
Tony smiled to himself and turned around to look at the view again. He was on thought about the recent event with Steve, maybe this is the time to set things right with him and hopefully with the rest of the team too.
Tony let him go and looks at him at his green and brown eyes, “Bambi your leaving and coming home with me to the avenger tower” he said to his son which shock, “wait what? why dad, why the tower won’t your team be wondering why I’m there?” He ask with concern.
No! That can’t be right, right?.
Daniel smirk at him “Why you ask, Well it’s simple really I want you. Ever since we first met as kids I’d loved you from that moment, I wanted to be with every step of the way” he said with just sincerity and Tony believe once upon a time that they could have been together Tony had similar feeling towards his once best friend, but now Daniel has become monster that Tony could never forgive. Daniel continues “But unfortunately you had to open your big mouth tell your daddy about it and i had to move away.” Daniel frowns at him with anger. “ Look Daniel I didn’t know that would happen” Tony pleas and Daniel chuckles darkly “ oh I know and I really don’t care if he knew that we kissed but what I’m more pissed off of your father than anything. You see my dad was a double agent and when I was at your house that time I had a little mission to complete but I failed and Howard found out and did some digging and sent my father away, whilst I had to be separated from you” Daniel finishes. Tony realise in that moment that being in Hydra was a family run business for Daniel “your father was in Hydra?” He ask and Daniel gives a patronising clap “correct, well done darling , yes both my parents are from Hydra luckily your dad didn’t figure out my mother was Hydra so she and some family showed me a few things and I have to say I love working here” he smirks.
Tony felt tears running down his face, once he finished his story about the last serval months. His mother was in tears but also has a angry look across his face , Davis didn’t look to please either. And his beautiful boy, his Bambi looks enrage about the whole “my team hate me” situation. God it was such a mess and didn’t know how to fix this.
Apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar
“But come on, that Rogers guy was horrible towards dad. what he said to him and things they done before it just makes me sick okay. And if he’s following dad everywhere he might hurt him again” Tobias said with sadness and worry in his voice.
~~~~~~~~
Tony was slowly came too, he felt an ach all over his body. He wanted to move an stretch out his body to hopefully relief some of the aches, but as he was trying to do so he notice something was very wrong.
“There you are” a frustrated sounded Pepper walk up to them, well mainly to Tony. Now, don’t get Tony wrong he loves Pepper and he sure knows that feels the same about him. But recently him and pepper haven’t been speaking much, as CEO Pepper been travelling a lot to do international business meetings and deals and not to mention the boards meeting in the states which Tony knows is quite challenging, so she in a lot of stress and he understands that. But due Tony’s reckless behaviour with the Avengers during the missions and all Pepper had been getting more stress due and kept sending him angry voicemails and emails saying to cut it out or else kinda thing.
Stark looked at him for a while like he was considering his options, then he nodded in agreement “ close the door cap it’s gonna be a long night” he said.
Tony put his phone down and sighed, today was too exhausting. But he can’t rest he needs to prepare himself before Daniel comes out of the shadows, he needs to train.
“Don’t run away Tony, you feel so good I can’t wait to be inside you again Tony. After all you owe me Tony, after what you did” the man sneered.
“THOR” he shouted and a blue light engulfed him, then....
“So what are those blue prints?” Steve asks Fury. “These are what appears to be the Hydra base that most likely were Tony is being kept” Fury told Steve, this confuses Steve, as to how did Fury get those blue prints. But luckily Peggy saw Steve’s confused and explain, “It was Jarvis when he was back online he managed to hack into the server that interfered his system. However he only manage to spot this before Hydra figure it out”. “Right thank you and thank you Jarvis that’s great” Steve compliments the AI, “Thank you Captain Rogers, after all it is my duty to do everything I can to get back Sirs to safety” The AI explained. And Jarvis was right with this blue print they might be able to locate where they are keeping Tony and hopefully he can rescue him without any harm to him, “Ok so what is the plan Director?” Steve ask Fury, and Fury gave Steve a small smirk but also a serious look in his eyes. “Well sit down Cap, and let’s get to work”
What do you think? What would you like to happen next?
Please feel free to comment or kudos
“You got some things to say about Stark, well what has he done now?” Fury asked trying to sound neutral to the trio.
Stark roll his eyes and that grind Steve’s gears. Stark sighed “ I did sleep fuck You very much, but I couldn’t sleep for long so I decided to have some hot chocolate my mom said it helps with sleep” tony was surprise he even mention that part he must be exhausted if he’s talking about his mom. “Anyway you can talk spangles why are you here in ‘my’ kitchen?” He teased.
Tony just burst out laughing, which confused Thor, “are you insane me and Rogers aren’t romantic, we have this thing which helps us relieve stress. Anyways how did you know ?”.
His dad was pissed to say the least, once they got home, they argued to the point it became a screaming match. Then it all came crashing down when Tobias ask one more time why no one would tell him about his mom, then his dad just snap and scream she was a rapist.
Tony thought for a moment but his parent instincts kick in and decide to physically go and his Bambi. “No thanks J , I’ll just check myself” he said as he walks out of his room.
Ok so Stark is looking at him weirdly now so he should abort this like right now. He was about to speak again but Stark spoke first.
“Your training begins now, the first step is to find your inner soul, to connect with it. Once you find it then the next steps will be easier, your soul is the one that holds the energy the most, the one that protects you from yourself and others. By connecting with it you’ll become one and you will feel tranquility” Thor explains.
As the other agents arrived to exam the scene, the two spies where ready to leave in the ambulance, until they heard thunder. “I can only guess who that would be” Clint said, then thunder and bright light came crashing down and Thor appears from the thunder.
“Yes Sir I’ll do that right away” she said as she went back on to the computer.
Tony had a slight panic about the situation, on how much Tobias had heard, how much did his mom and Davis heard. And Steve been punch not once but twice.
Then there was the team, you could say that all of them were surprised by the revaluation. It was Steve who spoke up out of all of them, “Tony, is this true?” He said with some hesitation in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was an awkward silence between them, but it was Steve who crack first. “Listen, Tony I think we’ve been misunderstanding each other and I just to try I mean really try, this is what I want to talk to you about for tomorrow. Hell l always wanted to talk you you about this but I keep getting side track by...” your dick up my ass” Tony interrupted with a grin on his face trying to get a rise at off Rogers.
“WHAT DID YOU SAY” the creature roared which brought Tony out of his thoughts. Tony grins at the creature “you heard me, but since you’re too fucking stupid let me break it down for you. I’m.. Tony Stark the genius, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist would like you the gross creature to kindly disappear from my mind forever” he said on his usual snark.
Finally finish this chapter hope you like it and sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
“I’m sorry and your right I didn’t mean to think I was apart of his life, but I really do hope he’s doing well” she said quietly. Tony sighed “yes he’s doing well, he’s the best thing that’s ever happen to me he’s a good kid better than me” he said to try and give this woman comfort but also feeling a little sweet revenge that having his Bambi didn’t ruin his life, god that’s just fucked up.
Natasha heavily sighs “Clint that’s enough” she barks at him, but Clint didn’t seem to take the hint “No way Tash you got to admit this is crazy. Like who the fuck are you kid, is the Cap right that you’re some sort of toy boy for this Asshole? He insults and at that Tobias finally snaps.
“Well, you boys seem to have this under control,” Tony said in a forced casual voice. “I have to go. JARVIS?” The suit re-formed itself around him, and he took off as soon as it was on.
“Scott, too,” he found himself saying. “Someone should call him. And -”
“I know I have a lot to explain,” said Steve. He could have been there explaining for the
Steve just shook his head. “Have you ever seen the way that kid looks at you?”
Valkyrie and Thor started plotting. No one knew exactly what they were talking about, and even if you tried to eavesdrop, you would only hear snippets about planets no one had heard of and potential solutions that involved mechanical stars. After a few days of this, everyone decided it was best to leave them alone. If they came up with a solid plan, they would share it with them.
70 years, but someone needed to get this situation back under control.
“Arguing like an old married couple,” Sam chimed in without hesitation.
They had stolen moments together after that, sleeping fitfully as one or the other fought off nightmares, but it was never more than platonic. They were caught somewhere between friends and lovers, an abyss that grew so wide that except for in his wildest dreams, Steve had talked himself out of any hope of ever crossing it.
“How can we help?” He asked. Tony had to refrain from rolling his eyes. Steve was a soldier, even in times of tragedy. It was in his blood.
But Tony was insistent, as Steve had suspected he would be. “Come on. I know your resume. Tell me more.” He nudged Steve with his shoulder, leaning back against the bar now, looking out at the crowd. “I’m curious.” He took a sip of his drink. He was well on his way to drunk, but Steve didn’t doubt his ability to recount every detail of this conversation if he accidentally let something slip.
The walkway lowered to the ground, and -
“I didn’t know that,” said Steve, again honestly. His heart was pounding loudly in his ears; he knew he was flying way too close to the sun. He wanted so badly to ask about Howard, to learn more about Tony, but he forced that urge down and changed the subject instead. “Do you think he’ll ever get the courage to ask her to dance?” He gestured with his glass to indicate Peter and MJ, who were awkwardly hovering at the edge of the dance floor. MJ had her arms crossed, and Peter was nervously taking a sip of his soda. They both looked completely out of place.
For some reason, it felt significant that Tony was asking. Steve found himself telling Tony about Brooklyn, and going to baseball games and growing up poor, and it was mostly the truth with some crucial details left out, like the fact that it had been the 1920’s and not the 1980’s. A lie of omission was not as bad as outright making up facts, though, or so Steve convinced himself as he kept talking. He surprised himself with how much he wanted to share with Tony, even mentioning that he had been in the Army.
Above it all stood Tony Stark, leaning on the seventh floor balcony and observing the chaos of the floors below as everyone he employed got to work. It was nine on a Tuesday morning. Tony was usually in his lab at this time or fast asleep, but he was expecting someone, and so he’d taken the opportunity to stop and observe. He didn’t often take the time to appreciate the immensity of what went on inside Stark Tower every day on the first five floors. The sixth and seventh floors contained conference rooms, the eighth through tenth guest rooms for visiting scientists and other guests, and Tony had renovated the remaining sixteen highest floors for Avengers only. He knew it was excessive but he told them he didn’t know how to do it any other way. It was mostly the truth. Pepper said it was because Tony wanted them to stay. He would neither confirm nor deny that statement.
It took longer than he thought and also no time at all to reach Loki.
It wasn’t much. Their plans weren’t great. Making plans after Thanos felt like drawing a map as they went along, not knowing what lay ahead. They were lost. They were clutching at their last, desperate hopes, and clinging to each other because there was no one else left.
“I don’t think that’s a coincidence, and neither do you,” MJ continued, ignoring him. She stepped into his apartment like she owned the place, settling on the arm of the couch and crossing her arms across her chest with a determined look on her face. “The kidnappers said on TV that they didn’t want Iron Man or the police to come looking for him.” Steve closed the door, a sort of anticipatory dread coming over him. How long had she known?
After three weeks of mostly watching Tony work, Peter started making suggestions.
“That kitten needed to be rescued,” Peter argued. Tony rolled his eyes and handed the kid another band-aid. Peter obediently stuck it to his arm, adding to a collection of colorful bandages covering a series of scrapes and cuts.
That illusion shattered when Peter brushed by Tony to get to MJ, and he remembered why it was so important that he didn’t fall for Steve. He had to protect Peter.
Loki smiled halfway, almost indulgently.
He could feel Steve glancing over his shoulder. Somehow, his
Steve simultaneously felt like he was close to figuring all of this out and putting the pieces together, and miles away from an answer. The mysterious Spider-Man, Tony’s secrecy, the incident at Science and Tech Day - it was all connected somehow, but he couldn’t quite see how. And he was running out of time. He’d told Peter and MJ that he would need to conduct three interviews with each of them, and he was already running out of things to ask about that seemed plausible. It was a stretch to imagine that Tony wouldn’t grow suspicious if Steve tried to stick around any longer.
things are around here. We don’t need any rumors spreading that we’re secretive and anti-social. It makes it seem like we’re hiding something.”
“What do you know?” Wanda demanded. “And don’t think we won’t leave you here to rot if we find out you’re lying.”
Valkyrie took a drink from the flask that always seemed to be in her hand, then wiped her mouth. “It will take a miracle to defeat Thanos,” she said. She didn’t seem sad, exactly, just defeated - but, Steve supposed, Asgard had been dealing with loss for months now. “I’d like to believe it can be done, but unless this Stark is some sort of genius -”
“Well, not necessarily. We don’t know where the radioactive spiders were being kept
“Everything’s fine,” Peter had mumbled into her shoulder. “Just a long day.” He did sound tired, but she wasn’t convinced. He pulled back to pick up his bag and head for his room. “I’ve got a lot of homework so I’d better get started.”
with three boxes of pizza (two were just for Steve) and a few glasses of wine. It was nice. Steve wouldn’t have been able to have this kind of friendship with a woman 70 years ago, and his friendship with Nat was invaluable to him, even if it meant a ribbing from Sam or Clint every once in a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, I wouldn’t -”
Tony had a lot of questions. A lot. Like, when did they find him? How was he not a popsicle? Was the government aware that technically, Captain America was a trademark registered to Stark Industries and therefore, someone should have told Tony that he was now the proud owner of one brand new Steve, unfrozen and handsome as ever? Why was he pretending to be a reporter? But Tony’s mind was whirring, theories being formed and dismissed and re-formed in a matter of seconds, and what came out of his mouth wasn’t
“I’m afraid so.”
Nebula, who had kept to herself since her arrival with Tony, turned out to be the most valuable resource they had.
“So you helped develop something completely pointless that will never work in the real world,” said MJ dryly. “Big deal.”
Peter was still in his Spider-Man suit, but the sleeve had been partly burned off. Due to Tony’s recent upgrades, it had dissolved instead of melting into Peter’s skin. He was lucky it hadn’t been worse.
I appreciate all of your comments and kudos!
“Call me May, please," May insisted.
Not his best plan.
“Tony Stark,” said a low, gravelly voice on the other end of the line. He didn’t recognize it, but it made his stomach drop to his toes. “We have Spider-Man,” said then the voice, and then nothing for a heart-stopping moment of silence, and then, through static: “...not look for him. Just make the announcement, send the money, and then arrangements will be made.” The line went dead.
And of course, the arc reactor. That, Steve drew with careful attention. He didn’t know what it was at first, but he could tell easily enough that it was a replacement for a heart. It wasn’t difficult to assume that the technology was keeping Tony alive.
Peter Parker, who was just some nerdy kid from Queens with an affinity for Star Wars, who got starstruck around Tony even though he saw him every day.
His shoulders stiffened as the familiar, lead-heavy weight of betrayal sank into his stomach. He was prepared to hear anything -
“Go fix your face,” Tony retorted, and having cheered Peter up a little bit, he sent him on his way and turned back to -
Tony held up a hand. “Wait, slow down. Invitation?” He put down what he was working on and turned in his swivel chair to face the kid, who had way too much energy for a Tuesday afternoon. He genuinely had no idea what Peter was referring to, but he quickly changed his tone when Peter’s face fell slightly, like he thought maybe his invitation had been a mistake. “Uh - I mean, of course you should go,” he added, and Peter brightened. Finally, it clicked. “Oh, the holiday party,” he remembered. “Yeah, it will be fun. Sort of. I mean, just don’t talk to any reporters.”
Later that same day, when the interview was over, Peter came bounding into the lab like an excited puppy.
The sound of people screaming behind him made Peter come to his senses, and he ran for the stairs along with everybody else. He had no idea what was going on, but clearly someone had let loose an army of giant spiders on them and he was not about to stick around and see how that turned out. He didn't even like regular sized spiders. These were something out of a nightmare, or a weird version of Harry Potter.
“You don’t think I know that?” Pepper asked him, looking almost disappointed. “Tony, I like Peter too. I don’t want him to get hurt. I know it would be incredibly dangerous if anyone found out about what he can do. But I also know that it looks way more suspicious to refuse a normal interview about internships than it does to just let the man do his work and leave.” She lowered her voice even though they were alone in the lab. “This is actually a good chance for us to publicize just how
“Thanks. I’ll tell Pepper. She planned it. Speak of the devil…” Pepper appeared at Tony’s shoulder, eyes a little wide. She was wearing a golden gown that shimmered in the dim light and she looked a little flushed. “Steve!” She said excitedly, ignoring Tony entirely. “Oh, I’m so glad you made it. I was just telling our friend from the New Yorker that he should meet you.”
to the wall.
They weren’t sure when to expect Tony, and Steve arrived a few days too early. For every hour he was there, he wondered if something had happened to Tony on the way there. Was he hurt? Or had he changed his mind?
It was Steve who initiated it because he was so sure of this thing between them, more sure than he had ever been about anything in his life, in the past or now. He knew Tony was holding back because he was afraid of coming on too strong, or offending Steve’s 1940’s sensibilities. It was Steve who sought out Tony one night after a particularly hard battle, finding him alone and halfway to drunk on the couch. It was Steve who wrapped a blanket around Tony and let him fall asleep in his arms, Steve who kissed his forehead as he drifted off.
“Hello? Hello? Tony, it’s Bruce, where are you?” A beat of frustrating silence passed, then another.
All three of them jumped and Peter slid off the lab bench, knocking aside a sterile needle on the way. They tried and completely failed to look nonchalant.
“Oh, there you are,” she said with a slightly hysterical edge to her voice. She looked - well, she always looked beautiful, but she had dark circles under her eyes and her hair was frizzy, and she was wearing her glasses, which she normally didn’t do out in public. “Is Peter here?” She looked around like he might just appear out of a corner somewhere. “Your -” she gestured to the ceiling - “voice thing said he wasn’t, but -”
“Mr. Stark! I got your invitation,” he said eagerly. “I’ll definitely go, except I’m not sure how late I can stay. Does it really not start until 9:00? I mean, not that I go to bed at 9:00, it’s just that my aunt usually wants me home by 11 and -”
“Oh – it’s nothing,” Steve said as Tony, not known for his patience, snatched it out of his lap. Steve didn’t protest, and he only half-smiled when Tony glanced at him for confirmation that it was okay for him to look at it. “Really, it’s nothing. Just a hobby,” he said.
“Tony? What was that all about?” Pepper came up behind him, voice gentle even though he knew she, too, was shaken by this whole thing.
“Peter’s not here,” Tony said, and his stomach dropped as her eyes widened. Suddenly, his issues with Steve didn’t seem so important anymore. “When was the last time you saw him? I dropped him off at your place yesterday afternoon.”
“No,” Steve said, and for some reason, his heart skipped a beat when he saw the way Tony was looking at him. “No, there’s no one.”
“I’m on it,” said Tony abruptly. “I appreciate your concern but there’s nothing you can do and -”
A hand landed on his shoulder.
“It’s the real thing,” Steve confirmed, and Jesus, even his voice was deeper. The glasses were gone, his expression serious, and it all seemed so obvious in hindsight that Tony took a precious few seconds out of worrying about Peter to feel like a complete and utter idiot, and then he was back to worrying about Peter.
Then Peter was pulled away by May, who wanted him to be checked for injuries. Before he left, though, he sent a meaningful look between Steve and Tony that was difficult to misinterpret.
They were on Tony’s personal floor, with Peter sitting on the kitchen counter eating leftover pizza. Ever since he got his powers, the kid had twice the appetite of a normal teenage boy.
an artist?”
Being away from Tony for the last two years was not dissimilar to waking up in the 21st century: He felt lost, a bit hopeless, and in his worst moments, utterly desperate. He asked himself over and over again if there was something, anything he could have done differently, if there was any way he could have prevented this. The only answer he could come up with was
“Do you mean every two weeks or twice a week?” Peter asked as he obediently hopped up on top of a lab bench, which was not something he was supposed to do and also not a formal way to conduct a checkup, but Bruce wasn’t a real medical doctor either, so they were making do with what that had.
“How do you even know that?” Peter muttered.
May shook her head in confusion. “Wait, back up. He was with you?” Her expression changed subtly from fearful to concerned. “He seemed upset when he came home,” she said, her tone not exactly accusatory, but not blameless either.
Tony only confirmed Steve’s suspicion that he was overwrought when he approached and said by way of greeting, “You look too sober. Have a drink. Let loose a little.” It was a transparent tactic to make sure Steve was here just to enjoy the party, not to get the scoop on the inevitable mess that was sure to hit all of New York’s papers tomorrow.
“Then maybe he had some club to get to, or maybe he was just hanging out with his friends?” Bruce shrugged. “Could be that his aunt wanted him home earlier. Why don’t you just ask him?”
There was a pause during which Peter realized that they all looked really tired and helpless. He felt the same way, his stomach churning, which was why he couldn’t stop babbling.
JARVIS finished traced Norman Osborne’s movements through surveillance cameras and his cell phone, and it led them to a series of storage units by the Hudson. Osborne had visited the area twice in the past week, but there was no record of him taking anything there or renting a unit. It certainly looked like he was scoping out the area.
Steve wasn’t sure what he was feeling. He thought it might be a strange, stomach-churning combination of shock and a sneaking suspicion that he should have known. It was the feeling that he’d missed something, that his own willingness to look past Tony’s odd behavior was what had caused him to overlook this crucial detail, that made him dial Coulson right then and there.
“So you’re saying that if we stay here too long, we will… move on?” Wanda asked warily.
“And - here’s the best part - Peter won’t have to reveal his identity because the media is going to be all over the fact that Captain America is back.”
“Exactly. But first of all, we need to figure out just who Spider-Man is and where he came from.” Fury dropped another two files on the desk. These two were even thinner than the one with the photos, containing just a resume and a photo each. One was a wide-eyed boy who looked about twelve, the other a girl with curly hair who looked about the same age.
After staying up all night promising himself he would be a better co-parent to Peter, Tony broke his one promise to the kid.
Natasha’s hand landed on his arm, and he tore his gaze away to find her eyes, searching.
“You think?” Sam was a little breathless from running almost four miles, but still matching Steve stride for stride. “I was just saying, that Spider-Man kid has been out on the streets again. Saw him myself.”
At that point, the remaining students started yelling and running for the stairs. Peter had fallen against the wall, clutching his leg where it had been burned, but was still attached, which was good. Students rushed past him and only one of them stopped. MJ helped him up and he realized belatedly that in the confusion, she had killed Spider 3 after it got him.
And just like that, Peter was tearing up. He always wanted to do things himself, and this was no exception - it was incredibly frustrating to be told by Strange to just wait - but at the same time, Peter would give anything to have Tony burst in and save the day right now. What if Tony couldn’t save him this time? What if Tony just thought they were dead, and right now he was alone and scared in space?
Before, it was a hole in space and Loki haunting his dreams, and then it was the visions that Wanda had put in his head, of death and destruction and nothing he could do to stop it. After Ultron, Tony was different. He was just scared, so scared, and Steve knew it, but he couldn’t help but grow frustrated when Tony would pretend otherwise: It was never fear making decisions for him; it was for Pepper. It wasn’t paranoia; it was just an experiment. It wasn’t guilt; it was only logical to sign the Accords.
Just as he had made up his mind not to give up entirely, the surreal noise of a cell phone buzzing broke through the deathly silence.
There was a pause.
It was there, in the elevator, it occurred to Tony that he didn’t want this to be a one-night stand. Tonight was different. It felt different. He wasn’t going to forget Steve’s name in the morning, because Steve had already stuck around much longer than originally expected. No, he was going to remember his name, and the hands gripping his waist, and the lips on his neck. And the way they both laughed breathlessly when the elevator doors opened on Tony’s floor, realizing that they looked ridiculously disheveled.
Eventually, it was the quiet that alerted him to the fact that something was off.
“Actually, I’m not doing anything,” Peter piped up, stepping around Tony so that Steve could see him better. “I’m free for an interview right now if you want.”
I literally forgot I was writing this fic so, apologies for the delay on the last chapter. I did warn you that it would be an unsatisfying ending. And I didn't tag Major Character Death because... I feel like you had a lot of warning. This is also another warning. It's a short and angsty chapter. Read away!
This chapter requires some suspension of disbelief to imagine that Tony, for some reason, doesn't know what Captain America looks like... let's just imagine that Tony resented Captain America for a long time, so he avoided even looking at pictures of him. Sure. (I made this up for fun. Bear with me.)
“No,” Tony cut him off, standing to face him. “I didn’t tell her anything. I wouldn’t do that. Because you’re a good kid and I trust you. Or at least, I thought I could trust you.”
“Remember when we met?”
Maybe, Pepper thought, this group wouldn’t turn out to be so bad after all.
He carefully put Tony’s file back along with Howard’s, and he left the room with more questions than answers.
by his shirt, pushed him up against the wall, and kissed him like his life depended on it.
Fortunately, there was a stroke of luck coming his way.
“What about him?” Peter whispered, glancing over Tony’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark, I didn’t realize - wait, what is he even doing here?” His tone shifted from apologetic to suspicious. “It’s like, one in the morning.”
He looked at his phone.
Peter blinked, then blinked again. His thoughts were fuzzy as he tried to remember - what day was it, again?
They stumbled into Tony’s kitchen, both a little drunk, both literally and from the sudden turn of events that had led to them kissing in an elevator. Tony was afraid that breaking the kiss would bring them back to reality, and this whole night would just turn out to be a mistake, but then Steve looked at him hungrily and before he knew it, Tony pushed up against the counter on his tiptoes - since when had Steve been so tall? - kissing him at a perfect angle and pushing his suit jacket off of his shoulders and tugging at his tie.
"Hey, Nat." Clint whispered, she was taken aback by the nickname but didn't question it. "I've been thinking, should I apologize?" he asked, his tone showing signs of distress.
With a sigh he stood up and walked around the room. “In that time, helping her opened my eyes to something bigger than humanity.” He crossed his arms and looked Captain America in the eyes when he lifted up his head at last.
“I do too.” Sam spoke up and Steve felt a kind of understanding between them. “Well, we gotta get to the playground. But maybe we’ll meet again, I’m guessing you’re the Steve, Ashely couldn’t shut up about.” Sam smiled, he was the first person around Steve's age he really met outside of the agency, not counting the bullies.
“Hey, Mrs. Wilson!” A girl spoke from the doorway.  Steve saw a little of her through the window, trying to see if she was a girl scout or should he worry. The girl left after exchanging words with Mrs. Wilson, but the two smaller figures stayed.
After three boxes and too many files, Natasha found herself sitting on the floor as well. She looked up at Clint across from her while the sorted paper piles separated them. He was really focused to do his job right. He was at his second box and looked at the papers for a long time before deciding where they go, she wondered if he had trouble reading them.
“I’m just being a good friend here, Peps!” he told her like he was heartbroken.
“I had some free time and wanted to see if you were a rotten corpse yet.”
"And just mingle." Fury shrugged casually, to answer the confused looks aimed at him he added. "There will be a lot of influential people attending, we shall get the most out of it."
“We’re taking Captain America out sightseeing, Fury’s orders.” Natasha said out loud to the agent.
“Agent Wilson, you stay. The rest of you are excused, ya’ll stink like my mother’s summer shoes.” Fury ordered and they walked out, Agent Hill and Coulson leaving the other way.
“Your handwriting can’t be that neat, like the notes you’ve sent me.” She explained. “And now it makes sense.” Clint was trying to avoid eye contact, so he decided lightly kicking the floor was the most interesting thing in the world. “Agent Dylon wrote those, you would have wrote more, cause you can’t keep your mouth from rambling, but there wasn’t enough time for her to write your whole day down.” She analyzed him, her voice smooth and kind, a smile tugging on her lips.
“One, trust me you’d understand hieroglyphs better and two about what?” he asked looking back up at her.
“Hi, Jim.” She waved, leaning on the counter waiting for the stove-top to warm up.
"Well, yeah. This music sucks." he downed the rest of his wine and in that little time Natasha decided to make her leave.
“Yeah, forget I can’t leave?” Steve's voice sounded defeated.
Natasha waited as Clint started reading one of the papers or if not reading at least considering the general information on it. He made a comically impressed face. “Yeah, I see why. I couldn’t care less.” He agreed.
“You remember yesterday I really wanted some gummy worms.” Clint started to ramble. “And in my dream they ate me!!” he exclaimed, he looked quite offended.
The boys found Natasha sitting on a bench at the playground, looking at the empty space.
“I’m glad.” Fury sat down in his chair and encouraged Steve to take a seat as well. “I’m sorry to hear, you’re finishing your sessions with Mrs. Wilson.” Fury leaned on his desk.
“But why no other records…” Tony asked himself and crossed his arms, standing up to pace around the room. “Give me something about this mission.” Tony told Jarvis looking out of the windows.
“I’d argue normal, but we are teenagers in a secret agency and having tea with Captain America every Monday.” Clint nodded to himself.
Agent Hill waited for her to elaborate, but Natasha didn’t say anymore of her thoughts. “Then I’ll tell Agent Robin to go on with the normal initiation then.” Maria nodded, peeking back at the girl then looking back at Natasha.
“You thought I couldn’t even write.” Clint deadpanned.
“There’s no such thing going on.” She wasn’t defensive against the accusation and her voice even had a bit of playful tone to it.
Clint hesitated, but there was only one way out and that was through Natasha and when he looked at her for help she didn’t look impressed. He sighed and sat down beside Steve. Putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder he smiled awkwardly.
"Those aren't the important numbers when I'd like a drink." he explained and leaned closer.
“This ain’t that bad.” Clint whispered to Nat as they followed Steve.
“We should go I need to pick up a dead bird from the sidewalk.” She turned to Steve and he nodded. He looked back at Sam, who was looking back and forth between them.
“Hey! Give that back to her!” he looked at the source of the shout and noticed Ashely with older boys around her. He started running straight towards trouble without thinking twice about it. Coulson’s shout after him couldn’t even guilt trip him into stopping.
“I’m surprised you got him out of his cave.” Rhodey commented and sat down next to Tony.
"Your main target is Mr. Serafin Tudor." Fury got to the point and the old man's picture appeared on the screen. "He's an upcoming influential business man."
“Come on sit down!” Sam told the three of them plopping down on the couch himself.
They both shook their heads and waited silently for Tony to elaborate on this spark of idea. “Great, then we’re going!” Tony clapped his hands together.
“You know, I—“ she was interrupted by the door opening. Natasha turned to Nick Fury immediately straightening herself with her hands behind her hand. He stepped aside and she walked in.
His therapy was with a confidential woman called Beth Wilson. He had met her at Shield HQ already, but the woman deemed the atmosphere not ideal for the sessions. So she offered her home with her office out of question due to her colleagues.
“That’s why you didn’t argue my idea.” Steve voiced his thoughts. A few seconds passed and the elevator dinged.
Natasha got in her pilot seat. She set everything ready for takeoff. She'd learnt it a few months ago, but now it was like second nature for her. She could easily operate any Shield aircraft if she needed to. She might not had been the best pilot at the agency, but she could fly steadily.
She had to get a few floors down but needed the young Stark's fingerprint or find a pass lying around somewhere. She looked around, this floor was private where Howard lived, the probability of finding a pass was close to zero.
“Charming.” Natasha commented.
"So, where are we going?" he asked casually, keeping up with her quick strides. She looked at him and furrowed her eyebrows.
Tony just swayed from side to side on the rest of the ride, staring at the ceiling, while his stomach filled with warmth when they hit the remaining stops, the lift managed to hit, before annoying Happy till a snapping point. Happy little victories.
“Thank you, you really are a hero!” Ashely gave him a hug and then proceeded to hug her retrieved backpack.
“When?” Pepper asked.
“Natasha, this is Sam. Sam, Natasha.” Steve introduced them and they nodded at each other, Sam trying to compose himself.
They sat down in the living room, Mrs. Wilson brought some chocolate and made some tea, while telling Steve about how she needed to do the groceries and the laundry. She had a soothing voice, so Steve didn’t mind, he was also interested in how different people lived now with all the technology.
“I’m glad Captain America inspires people.” Steve said with a small smile.
The next day Steve and Clint walked through corridors to the exit, Clint like it was an everyday stroll while Steve a little on edge, looking around continuously.
He unbuttoned the top buttons on his red shirt first thing after he closed the door. His black jacket landed on one of the beds while he chucked his watch on the other. He did his best to roll up his sleeves although it looked kind of wanky.
"You  are not going anywhere after what happened tonight." Tony raised an eyebrow, was his father actually worried about him or he was mishearing things?
Natasha hated waking up, especially to the morning sun creeping through the blinds. She liked the night much more, it was in the darkness when she thrived, she hid in the shadows, calculating, waiting for the right moment to strike. The mornings were always the same before she joined S.H.I.E.L.D, before she was rescued by Shield. Everything was scheduled for her, decided for her and her thoughts weren't even hers.
“Samuel Wilson, age 17, High School Student.” Jarvis read aloud while Tony poured into his glass of the alcohol. He opened his mouth to ask about what was this weird Shield agent lineup, but he decided against it.
“Where?” Pepper at least wanted to know something about what she's getting herself into.
“They don’t make these anymore, but the name is still dear to adults and children alike.” Mrs. Wilson explained.
“Well, then I feel honored.” He said softly, it was a tone she hadn’t heard from him before. His eyes lingered on hers, but then he focused back down at the paper and looked for the pile where it belonged.
"Wha--!" Clint was about to shout, when Maria Hill stepped into the canteen.
“Not a fast reader?” she asked and he looked up with a menacing look. Natasha raised an eyebrow she didn’t intend it as an insult.
They were still looking up at him with hope and undying interest though, he couldn’t leave them hanging without an answer. Mrs. Wilson looked ready to intervene anytime and shoo her kids away.
Natasha could imagine as the gears turning in his head, slowly processing the information thrown at him.  "Yeah..." He huffed out, still looking around with wide eyes. "Yeah... Just... I had a date.." he murmured.
He knew New York; but as he stood there, his Tsum letting out worried cheeps where it tried to climb onto his shoulder, he found he didn’t recognize his own home.
Everyone set about doing their jobs, maybe more than with a bit of pleasure in some cases.
“It’s not my fault that they translated the text wrong; this is the Chalice of ‘Hot Drink Of Poverty’; they thought it was the Chalice of ‘Blood of Fiery Death’!” Tony said gleefully, kissing Steve’s cheek when he walked into the kitchen and standing up to grab another mug for him.
This is one of the reasons why he couldn’t be around Steve; all of his defense just… fell apart.
For all of Tony’s, Bruce’s, and Hank’s genius, they could never quite manage to get it right for how
And for all that he thought his younger years, living in that empty, lonely mansion under Howard’s thumb and nail was what hell was like, he’s never been more wrong.
After that Steve was feeling pretty good about his Soulmate and his Tsum.
If he couldn’t offer anything else (money wasn’t going to fix anything here) then he at least had this.
Right outside the conveniently large bush that disguised the entire team, one of the Masters of Evil’s henchmen stopped, grunting as he turned his head suspiciously, before continuing right on. The entire team waited till he was out of hearing range before letting out a collective sigh of relief.
- face with breaking the least skin contact as possible.
Tony let out a long breath, rubbing a hand over his eyes.
be dead, too?
He would remember watching Thor’s lightning light up the sky, taking out an entire squad of aliens with one strike.
Tony’s face had turned redder as Steve talked. He still didn’t say anything, just staring up at him with something like shock in his large eyes.
wouldn’t last if they kept going like this. Distantly he wondered how the only real good thing he had gotten from being in a war besides his ability to strategize under fire was his ability to compartmentalize. He could think about losses later; now he had to make sure his remaining men made it through this alive.
That, more than anything, made Steve relax a bit.
“You almost got us caught! Again!” Bucky hissed at him. Clint chuckled nervously, shrugging.
But then Steve started hanging out in the workshop, and Tony started to ‘educate’ him via movie nights on the common floor, and somehow along the way they became close friends. After a month it was clear both on the field and off, to everyone else, that Cap and Iron Man were something else when they were together.
Not that he had expected anything less; he had no Soulmate, and had always been destined to die alone. Most of his life was spent alone, before Howard and Mama died, before Jarvis and Ana passed away, before everyone left.
“Hi,” he answered, helpless to say anything else.
Steve silently cursed, all but jamming the elevator button.
“I can’t promise that he won’t return your love, sir,” Tony flushed a bit brighter at the
wanted to hurt him) he easily pulled him up, delighting in the way Tony let out a startled sound, face turning a charming pink.
Later, when he was on the helicarrier, striding into the main deck with all the suave ego he had mastered decades ago, he would forever deny (at least, to anyone else) that seeing his long-time hero alive and in uniform made his heart beat faster, and he had to keep from acting like a middle school girl meeting her idol. That would have just been embarrassing is what that was. (Thankfully Fury never picked up on that detail… at least he doesn’t think he did, anyways.)
Then, weeks later after the repairs had finished on the Tower and the floors were prepared (again, he never thought much would come of his invitation, but he was man that stood by his word) Bruce showed up, smiling awkwardly in the foyer with a small backpack in hand.
“Uh, you know that’s booby-” Tony didn’t get to finish.
for being born with his Tsum fully developed as it was, for his Soulmate being dead. Soulmates had exactly the same life span; shouldn’t
It was only after JARVIS talked him down from the attack and he called Rhodey that he calmed enough to think rationally. Or as rationally as being Tony Stark could be.
Where he and Steve did almost everything together (a fact he only realized after how lonely he was eating breakfast by himself in the penthouse instead of being on the common floor as he normally did) now it became where it was a rarity if Tony saw him once at all that day.
And… Tony’s brain broke, like the rest of him.
“What’s the thing for, anyways?” Probably should have asked earlier, but whatever.
Steve didn’t say it in favor of kissing his boyfriend some more. Worrying thoughts like that could be handled later. For now, he was just content in knowing everyone was alive, and Tony warm in his arms.
He was nervous, scared, anxious, brimming with energy, on the cusp of just
And when they ended up all cuddling together on the couch, with Tony snuggled right in the middle? Honestly, Tony swore he had everything he needed right there.
So, Tony did what he did best when faced with things like this: avoidance.
Tony was far too young to feel this old, to feel the cold causing creaking bones to ache and the heat to wear him down to sluggish exhaustion.
- the water splashing onto the car battery that was keeping you alive and simultaneously electrocuting you from inside through a metal disk in your chest.
He never fit in, no matter what he did; his views on the world were different, his views on society, and… his views on other people.
Tony hummed happily, tapping the side of the Chalice.
He wasn’t sure what he expected when he told Father that, with his Tsum cuddled tight in his arms like a plushie - it was already big, like one of his teddy bears; yet another oddity - but he shouldn’t have expected anything less than the furious outrage Father fell into; for even daring to not take the blame of having a Soulmate who was not only gone, but one that was far more important than he would ever be.
For giving him a chance to be even a little bit ‘normal’, even just the once.
- but didn’t seem to be getting much bigger.
It wasn’t like anyone else would notice, would care.
If Steve started smiling like a besotted fool, well, it was
And at the same time, his mind was running faster than it had since Obadiah had taken his reactor.
“I generally don’t like magic, but this? This is a whole different creature,” Tony said happily, smirking at all the surprised looks everyone gave him; it was well known how much he hated magic.
Tony had - mostly - finished his salad, but was now staring up at him, bright eyes showing his clear concern.
“Tony.” Tony blinked, watching Steve shift on his feet before taking a deep breath, looking Tony right in the eyes. Wow, his eyes were beautiful like the sky, he knew that, but right now they were like sapphires… He always wondered where poets got their inspiration from, but like this, he thinks he could understand. “Tony, did you mean it?”
He knew what would happen with his actions; he was an expert at pushing others away, after all, didn’t even really have to try.
His Tsum - still as tiny and bright red and gold as ze always had been - let out a mournful chirp, cuddling close against his neck where ze rested on his shoulder.
And then Steve was rumbling softly, more soft words that he couldn’t hear, and then his scent was just warm again and it was soft cuddles again and everything was right in the world.
Catching the shield on instinct, he felt his lips tilt up as he watched Tony swoop back around, aiming a few repulsor blasts at zombies that still staggered down the street. He waited, walking forwards when the Iron Man armor slowed to a stop, hovering in front of him; he couldn’t stop the grin blooming on his face when the faceplate lifted up, revealing a haggard, tired, yet smiling Tony.
“You really don’t know, do you?”
Of course he didn’t think much would come of it.
For someone as tactile (and touch-starved, though only Rhodey said that… and Pepper… and Happy…) as Tony, he was over the moon, with even those small touches.
needs - before shushing him with murmured words he couldn’t understand for the life of him, continuing the gentle stroking.
And he would remember guiding the nuke up into the portal, how he quickly lost oxygen, and how his last thoughts were, as the alien armada blew up like a supernova, how he never told Pepper thank you.
Natasha had taken a liking to Sam he was determined to become a valuable part of the team, so when she asked him to run one more hour on the treadmill or do one more box routine, he did it with his teeth gritted.
“I guess then you’ll have to watch out when you go to bed at night.” Natasha warned him and pushed the button for her floor in the elevator.
He looked around the room full of flower patterns and decorative pillows. There were a lot of family pictures, his gaze gliding over most of them he determined she had three children. He saw a few photos of her husband, but they were not recent ones, Steve made a mental note not to ask, he knew how these things went.
"Fucking Captain America!" he mouthed to her and she huffed a laugh.
Clint hadn't seen Natasha for two days when he got called into Nick Fury's office. That man was the scariest, after Natasha, but he was the boss, so naturally Clint was a bit nervous going to meet him. He got no response when he knocked, so he opened the door cautiously.
"Tony, we'll talk after." Howard said.
“So, there was a small white dog called, Molly. She knew tricks and she was pretty good.” Natasha silently made notes in her head about the grammar mistakes. “But her friends were better, she trained and tried her best.” She squinted every time a word was less comprehensible.
“Why are you so happy?” she asked, after a few second, because curiosity got the best of her.
“The fact that that is your biggest accomplishment at a healthy, normal life says a lot about you.” Pepper deadpanned. Tony leaned against his desk, his hip connecting with the glass surface.
“Have I mentioned how much I love you?” Tony made a dramatic face, making grabby hands for his food, but before Rhodey gave him the whole box, he took out a piece himself. Tony showed utter betrayal and mouthed “You traitor!”.  But he was happy to dig into his box when he got a hold of it. Tony groaned at the taste of freshly melted, soft cheese, every time he thought he got to taste a bit of heaven on Earth, because he’ll end up in hell either way.
“And look where that got you..” Pepper teased and took a bite from her dinner.
“Okay! You’ll chose something and it’s a gift from me!” Tony said in defeat.
"Sue me, but I'm not interested in pop-culture. He wasn't our target, why should I know how he looks like?" she remained calm while answering, trying to shoot down anymore teasing from the blond with her eyes.
“No way!” Sam straightened in his seat, his brain obviously working fast, adding one and one together, jumping to conclusions, trying to solve the puzzle. “I knew you were familiar… Are you..?” Sam asked and stood up, shock mixing with his expression. “Of course you are! That’s insane!” he tugged on his short hair.
"You just have to play your part and let him be in a comfortable environment before we throw the truth bomb at him." Fury spoke up, not taking off his eyes of the screen.
“Your first mission is next Friday, you’re going to accompany Agent Romanoff and the two of you will go undercover.” Fury talked loud and clear.
"Well then. Shall we head back?" Fury asked and the captain nodded, still trying to get his head around the situation. To be honest, even they didn't understand how such thing happened, must had been worse for the guy it was happening to.
She plopped back onto the bed and stared at the piece of paper for who knows how long, then she decided to take a shower. She scrubbed her skin, feeling dirty with too much blood on her hands.
Clint narrowed his eyes, sensing a catch. But couldn’t think of one. He grinned and when Natasha tilted her head in confusion, he spat in his palm. “Deal.” He extended his hand and was met with Natasha’s judging gaze.
“Steve!” Ashely smiled.
He heard the bell ring and lifted his head looking toward the door than at Pepper over the kitchen counter.
“Natasha?” he asked after the girl turned to leave.
“Oh, yeah, seems like you needed a lot of air.” Sam said still panting.
Fury asked them to wait at the door, while he walked inside his office with Captain America. They leaned onto the wall different sides of the door and Natasha tried to read his mind, like she usually did with people when she had nothing else to do. She got tired of the silence and now that they were together outside the quarantine, she might as well try to get to know him a tad better.
"The party's only in the evening. Don't worry." Fury put his hands up in defense. "You'll know everything you need to by then."
“You could have called.” Tony shrugged, but one of his mischievous little smile was already playing on his lips.
"If this man's really involved in unusual activities, no doubt we'll hear about him in the future and then we'll get everything we need." Steve smiled at her through the rear-view mirror.
He looked around the artificial room with furrowed brows. Natasha stepped closer to the bedside, the captain was sitting up and looked at her, awaiting answers. "Maybe you should have some water." she said and took the opportunity to pour some water into a cup at the bedside table. She held it for the captain, but he didn't take it.
He played with a packet of cookies, throwing from hand to hand. “And what does dear daddy want from me?” he asked, taking the cup when it was done and raised it to his lips to blow on it.
“I warned you, just give the bag back and leave the little one alone.” He gestured with a tip of his head toward Ashely and her purple backpack.
Sam noticed them standing at the corner, looking oh-so-shady. He just showed a thumbs up that the guys could also see.
"Let's roll Stark Squad." He exited the vehicle, the unamused looks shared between Pepper and Rhodey unknown to him.
“I’m afraid there isn’t any record of her.” Jarvis answered after running a world wide scan for her face.
"I just wanted to speak about your magnificent breakthrough with clean energy. It's quite the difference from the company's..." she looked for the right word. "Orientation." She smiled endearingly so it didn't sound offensive.
"You're walking into Stark Tower, the guy who probably has the most enemies on Earth." Fury looked at Sam with a stern gaze. "You always have to be on guard on a mission!"
Steve felt bittersweet about all this as he read a line from this Bucky character and sighed. This wasn’t his life and that wasn’t his best friend, but everybody thought this was their friendship, Steve wondered if some people even forgot he had been a real person.
The silence was broken when Natasha absentmindedly found a game and decided to try it. She was making a pineapple pizza for an old grumpy lady when Clint sighed heavily and threw his pencil on the desk, slumping back in his chair in defeat.
Natasha waited circling, like if a feline was playing with its prey, but Clint didn’t let the space between them get smaller. She wondered about asking if he was scared, but she hadn’t the time. Clint stepped toward her the slightest bit and her instincts kicked in.
“So, tell me about your day.” Mrs. Wilson sat down in the armchair so she could face him.
"I'm not a good dancer." she refused and made sure to keep an eye on the leaving men.
The hangar doors closed fully and Shield agents ran to their rescue. Clint and Natasha banged their heads on the back of their seat, both of them earning a minor concussion. They groaned as they came to their senses, undoing their seatbelts.
Natasha drank a bit as well, she wasn't a big fan of any alcoholic beverage but she wasn't backing down.
“I’m coming!” he heard an annoyed shout, which was not Mrs. Wilson’s.
The helmet disappeared from the girl’s head and she grinned at all of them. “Sorry, I’m late.” She told them with a little sigh.
“Cause I wasn’t invited.” Tony shrugged like it was obvious, like the reason didn’t matter. “You said yourself, you had no news from dad. It’s been months! As a responsible son, I should say hi, right?” Pepper sighed of course this was about questioning authority.
I can't write mission explanations for the life of me, so I gave up a few times... but then weeks went by and now we're here ._.
Steve had therapy on every Friday and usually Maria took him or Coulson at rare occasions. He knew the way by heart now and could had gone by himself, but that wasn’t happening anytime soon. He watched the people pass by the car, the playground, they got a red light at almost every time, was packed with kids running around or playing with their phones. The New York suburbs were awesome, but he couldn’t help but wonder if they were going to let him visit Brooklyn.
"I hope you didn't dream on becoming a spelling bee champion." She continued teasing him and Clint grabbed the letter from her grasp.
James grabbed two bottles of beer. “Yass!! Gimme!” Tony reached in his direction.
"Don't worry, I've been informed the building is intact, but you should probably leave."  he added and Tony nodded.
She moved as lightning, Clint had no time to react, only a prophet could predict those moves. He was easily pinned against a nearby crate with Natasha's arm across his chest keeping him in place. He could study her face from close, but no muscle moved in her face, but her eyes still shot daggers at Clint.
They were sitting in the limousine Tony had ordered to pick them up. Rhodey made sure to sit somewhere between the buttons and Tony so the music wasn't blasting their heads off. Pepper sat next to Tony and watched as he played with some stupid game on his phone.
They arrived at the Information Branch and headed for the main room. It had the main computer and the smartest people aiding the missions with whatever they can dig up. They usually had a lot of work to do, so they should benefit from some helping hands or at least that was Natasha’s plan.
Captain America was sitting in one of the two armchairs facing Fury’s desk with his hands clasped together and leaning on his thighs. He looked deep in thought, Natasha didn’t know what to say so she just sat down in the other armchair and Clint leaned on the back of it.
“I had breakfast with Clint and Natasha as always, then worked out.” He smiled softly, he had this tiny bit of a routine now, he was proud of. He really enjoyed the other two’s company, it made everything easier. They didn’t look at him as Captain America, he was beginning to believe himself that he could be just Steve, at least to them. “Then watched a movie with Clint, he started a list of what I should catch up on. I’m accepting recommendations.” He added, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
“Hey, Tucker.” She nodded at the guard and he smiled. “We’re taking the captain out.”
“It’s a meeting, my dad has at Stark Industries yearly for a lot of big brains.” He explained briefly, using his hands as always. “Usually for new, upcoming scientists to meet the big dogs.”
Natasha pushed a duffel bag into Clint’s arms. “At last.”
“It’s been a while since I wore a suit.” Rhodey shrugged nonchalantly.
"I'm not-- Wait, what..." he looked at the lever and stepped to pull it.
“Well, I knew you for longer and I thought you’d appreciate another girl on the team.” Maria explained and Natasha hadn’t even thought of being the only female on the team, maybe a fellow girl would be nice to get a taste of normalcy like with Sam.
"It's not hero time, Captain! Look!" the explosion happened halfway it wasn't that big, only the sound scared the guests. Drones flew out from the upper floors and started to extinguish the fire. Sirens could be heard in the distance which meant the firefighters were on the way as well.
Natasha and Sam had watched the opening speech and now were only wandering around. She told Sam that they should split up and when that reached his mind he made his way to the desserts, keeping his anxiety at bay with food.
He arrived at the hangar shortly, panicking as he looked around to catch a glimpse of  Natasha's redhead. He calmed his body as he scanned the area and spotted her easily. She was walking towards an aircraft with a big sports bag. He jogged up beside her.
She located Serafin Tudor at the end of the room, near the podium when one of the professors started to give a speech. She looked at Sam who was enjoying himself with other teens his age, so she decided not to panic him.
“Babysitting a super soldier.” Clint interrupted, he was not wrong, but Natasha doubted the captain needed to be reminded of curfew or be put to bed and read a bedtime story.
His stomach dropped from the pent house to the basement, though, when they stepped into the living room.  Tony felt lightheaded, while he waited for the men to disperse from his father's company. He looked around the room, head held high as the smart looking guys in suits passed him. They weren't worth his eye contact.
The footage didn’t just show another person, but two at the corner of the next building. Tony watched as Agent Romanoff and Wilson rushed to the two figures dressed in black, obviously basic Shield attire.
“Somehow being frozen for decades seems almost nothing now.” Steve answered Sam, his own jaw somewhere on the floor also.
“Jarvis, I have to sober up, I’ll be back.” Tony scampered up from the floor and rushed into a wall after steadying himself. He tripped into the bathroom and let the shower flow over him.
“Boys?” Steve furrowed his eyebrows.
“Agent Hill, the captain is in charge, why don’t you talk to him?” Natasha stood with her hands behind her back.
He stared out of his head his pupils diluted, his head heavy until the magic alcoholic liquid disappeared from the bottle. His brain turned numb finally and the questions and doubts had all left him. He just stared at the old picture and the camera footage, not comparing anymore, just entranced by the whole situation.
“What do you have planned for the day?” he asked casually walking back to his desk to look at numbers and sketches on the screens.
Happy sighed when he saw Tony's 'name', he clipped it onto his suit proudly and excused them to head for the elevator.
Agent Coulson ushered her down, keeping a protective hand on her back. He was one of the agents getting her out of that hellhole, she knew him well. "We are on lock down, nobody knows more." he informed her while she looked around at the rushing people. "Are you okay enough to get to your room?" he asked and let go of her, she looked around, but lost Clint in the big chaos.
Occasionally he had movie nights with Clint, they sat in their pajamas in one of their rooms and watched whatever Clint could think of that day. He told Steve he always wanted to watch some of these movies and now Steve was the perfect reason to make those dreams come true. There were a few that left Clint snoring on his shoulder though.
The elevator ride up to the pent house wasn’t just long, but Tony felt more uncomfortable with every second. It wasn’t about Happy, no, he had met the head of security more times he likes to admit. They had history, the man had probably dragged his drunk ass to his room almost as many times as Rhodey and that said something.
“I’ll get you something nice.” Tony offered.
Steve gave him a disapproving look and turned toward Sam with an easy smile. Natasha stood up and everybody's attention targeted her. She just started pacing around with nothing better to do, unbothered by the expectant looks.
Steve couldn’t find a reason not to, so he took a seat beside him. Sam decided on watching a cartoon about some colorful world and its hero. He didn’t pay more attention to it though, he didn’t know the story, so he probably wouldn’t understand much.
“Not much.”
“Would you stand there forever if I wasn’t even here?” Fury asked and neared the captain with a travel cup in his hand.
The two boys' attention was averted from each other when with a deafening bang some floors went up in flames. The explosion caused chaos. People started running out of the building and Steve was about to run in when Clint grabbed his arm.
“I see.” She smiled sincerely when the bell rang. “Well, I guess our session is over for the day.” She stood up to get the door. Steve got up as well and took a last glance around the living room, looking at the stairs he wondered about Sam. He noticed a head poking out from the top fencing. Upon being noticed Sam disappeared, but Steve’s heart already ached for a friend he might never get to have.
He jogged back to the Wilson siblings and gave Ashely her back pack. Ignoring the muttered “Jesus, this guy has some speed.” From the eldest sibling, Steve assumed.
“I told you he’s not in the mood.” Clint whispered to Natasha who hung back leaning onto the door frame.
She was so focused on maintaining eye contact before, she covertly checked his nametag. When she read the words she had to take a double take. 'You know who I am'
“I know. I really am sorry, son, but we have no choice.” He spread his hands.
"It's so dry! Like.. I was so excited the first time I saw it! I was just like, 'Yes! Chocolate cake!' and then I bit down and urghh..." Clint imitated like he was throwing up.
"Sir, was that an explosion?" she asked, trying to hide her focused mode and act like a scared girl.
Steve Rogers stood up, close at the same height as the director. “This is insane, Mr. Fury.” He said matter-of-factly.
The little team was sitting in a meeting room, by now just silently waiting. Clint was playing with a pen, he's found in the half hour they had been sitting there. Steve seemed to be getting impatient judging by his expression growing more annoyed by the minute. Then there was Sam fidgeting, his leg tapping on the floor and scratching his nails.
“Shield records…” He mumbled, his voice weak and uncertain.
“Just a little… But I want to sober up, help me!” He grabbed her hand dragging her to the kitchen. “I need some painkillers.” He looked at her expectantly, she just shook her head.
“Your name is Steve! You run faster than a fricking race car!” Sam yelled. “That’s insane! You’re Captain America!”
Weeks went by, he trained, occasionally with Natasha and Clint, but Clint left him every time after a while, whining. He listened to the new music while drawing the New York landscape or the new people in his life or Mrs. Wilson’s plants.
Natasha was reading the news on a tablet while sitting on her bed cross-legged. There were only the usual topics, nothing interesting, but she needed something to occupy herself.
“R-right.” He was still baffled when he shook his head. “No?... I mean there are lots of pretty girls, but I assume you meant one I’m interested in.”
"Tony, what are you doing here?" Howard asked as he got closer to his son.
Between letting Sam beat up Clint as his personal punching bag and watching Steve use a phone like a grandpa, she forgot about the unsuccessful mission two weeks ago. She spent most of her free time in the shooting range hitting bullseyes.
"Good try." a voice behind her said. She looked at the intruder immediately. It was the same guy from the bar. He had his hands in his pocket and didn't seem affected by the situation.
"Good morning." he greeted them politely, Natasha sipped her coffee, while maintaining eye contact with Clint.
“Hey, there. I’m Steve.” He extended his hand kindly, dealing with her like if she was an adult.
“Another person? Can you show me the street view again?” He asked and stood next to the bed occasionally sipping from his drink.
“So you’ve never learned to write?” It was more of a statement than a question, even though her tone was question like.
“I give up!” Clint groaned and turned to lay on his back. “You win!”
She let it go and spent time with Steve in the training room. He had a lot to learn and Clint made fun of him continuously, it was funny, but Natasha didn’t show her amusement.
“Romanoff, would you?” Fury asked, getting Natasha out of her daze.
His gaze glided away from the messy pile and he read the title of the book laying on the table with a pair of glasses on top of it. His heart skipped a beat while he leaned forward. It was like the world ceased to exist as he lifted the book. ‘The Serum’ written by Margaret Carter. His hands were shaking when he caressed the cover with a broken vile.
He found himself sitting on the floor and leaning against the bed, confused and his brain hurt, logic hurt. “Shield records…” He said again more sloppily.
“I’ll just talk to him.” She answered, her voice unwavering. Steve waited for a ‘it was just a joke’, but Natasha just turned on her heels and walked up to the agent with confidence.
"You should probably rest and calm down, you've experienced major trauma." She encouraged him to lie down.
"Are you sure you're okay?" she asked Sam.
They ate together every meal of everyday. Clint talked about his dream of tasting every pizza in New York City, he talked about his new sitcom he started watching and every piece of story that occurred to him. Natasha ate in silence, Clint didn't ask. Days went by and she saw no sign of that hidden piece of him, which slipped most minds. They didn't talk or see each other at all any other time.
Tobias just chuckles “I’m well aware of your independence grandma, but you always say to me that sometimes you need to swallow your pride and expect when someone kind is offering you help” he teases and Peggy just chuckled at that.
“ I told you all if you hurt him I’ll throw you of this team and by what I saw I should make that call” he spoke, Steve was devastated he didn’t mean for this to happen, “ Sir no please give us a chance to make this right” he spoke, the other two agreed as well but Fury was not convince.
TBC..........
Then Rogers clears his throat, “um did you want a drink and we can talk some more out here?” He ask.
It shook him out of his thoughts, his eyes are wet and blurry. Tony rubs him face and turned towards the people he cares about the most, they all looked worried and that’s when he realise he might just had a panic attack in front of them, damn that is embarrassing.
“That’s different point break, at least your abilities are more useful than mine, and besides your liked here and also cap and Bruce are like as well it’s just me” tony tried to explain
Then stark face change into a different mask, the press mask Natasha likes to call it.
So hears a new chapter and apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar
“That’s good J keep going at it the sooner the better” Tobias relaxes a little bit, finally some good news he thought to himself. Steve thought the same as well he has his chance to make up for his mistake he won’t let Tony down this time.
As they about to leave Thor made his appearance at the entrance, “are you okay Lady Natasha?” He ask. “Yes nothing to serious my shoulder is a bit sore and my burns are just minor I just need to put cream on them” she replies.
So what do you think, what will steve do?
So now it’s come to this, Tobias wonders if the reason his dad brought him here was because of those monsters who hurt him. Could it be that his mom came back to find him by confronting his dad that’s the only thing that could explain his dad reaction.
Hope you all have a good day.
Enjoy 😊
Tony shook his head “I don’t care what they think, you might be endanger Bambi, I need you there as I know my tower is safest place for you right now” he said with tears threatening to come out his eyes.
“Of course sir” Jarvis replied
Before the mission, Rogers ordered him to stay by Clint side, to always catch him when needed to and to be his eyes. But instead, tony, whist Rogers was blabbered on, Tony got Jarvis to scan the swaps and find there weakness, well it turns out according to Jarvis they had very sensitive hearing. So what did tony do, he got Jarvis to hack into any loud speaker, any radio, tv and anything else that could produce high volume sound. He also ordered Jarvis to tell anyone in a 10 mile radius to leave the area after all he doesn’t want innocent people to get hurt, he orders Jarvis to turn everything on to its highest volume and what do you know it work and the so the mission was done and dusted, sure there were loads of broken glass from shops, cars and apartments but who cares tony can easily replace it. And it also cause people to have a massive headaches but at least the killer swaps are gone.
“We made it to the end, huh, Cap?”
“Live and die this day, live and die this day.”
Whatever he had been thinking about saying, the swirling thoughts that had been on his mind for the past week, all but left him. He thoughtlessly gave Tony’s hand a gentle squeeze, and his heart sped up when Tony squeezed back.
0o0o0o0o0
Walking over to said hole, Tony cautiously leaned over and peeked down. There was orange light coming from somewhere down there - fire, maybe? Who lights the torches in a sealed abandoned temple, anyways? - and he saw it wasn’t that deep.
Tony let out a drunk giggle; wasn’t there a song about that? Something about love being the most important thing you live for but also killing you at the same time…
Tony had always been sure he was ‘broken’.
“It’s- It’s fine if you don’t-” he didn’t get much farther than that.
Pepper made him feel things he never felt before; and it was months after working with her that, late one night when he was on day two of a working binge and was zoning out with his thoughts (again) lingering on Pepper, he wondered if he wasn’t quite as ace as he thought.
After they got past the awkward stage, dating someone as amazing as Pepper was… well. Honestly he never had as much fun except when Rhodey came around and they managed to convince Happy to drive them to somewhere ridiculous. (Which has happened more than a few times.)
and for
Of course, for the sake of appearances, he kept up the ‘act’.
Because Tony was kissing him.
It had to be enough.
Steve was feeling… not old, but not young -
He knew they had lost.
Steve just took a moment and breathed, closing his eyes.
Instead, he did what Tony Stark did best: talk.
And that was enough.
Like a broken spell, Steve felt his nerves settle, leaving him with nothing but love and determination.
He grimaced at the thought of his friends, curling even closer against the warm, soft fluff of his Tsum.
Pure warmth was one of them.
“Yes. And if it wasn’t clear…” Tony began, hesitating as he fidgeted; he never felt this nervous before, and yet- “I love you, too.”
“I can’t believe you went all that way for a Chalice that makes coffee.” The bland yet impressed tone Bruce used made Tony smile, even though Bruce had turned him down for his bitter tea.
“Good?”
That was the day he met his first real friend, best friend for life, and brother in all but blood.
Taking a deep, shaky breath, he closed his eyes, gripping the special pokeball to his chest even tighter.
“Oh hell, no-” Sam said, jumping right after with his wings folded up to fit, Redwing following close behind.
With a firm but gentle grip (he didn’t want to hurt Tony, he
For all of how true those words were and how sincerely they were said (by Captain America, because it was only right that someone as good as him would hate someone like Tony) Tony had learned long ago to never let them see your reactions; they always did enjoy it when they saw you hurting.
But if this was all he got, then that was fine. He would live and deal.
And that was…
Much later, Tony would remember the battle in bits and pieces, starting with watching an army fly down from a hole in the sky that had appeared right over his newly built tower, and including when Loki knocked him out of his tower after his failed attempt to mind control him.
“I’m glad you like it, but you didn’t answer the question, honey.”
Not that Tony would ever want to shoulder Rhodey with the mess that was him and all his baggage - it was a miracle that he even wanted to be his friend - but… sometimes he still did wonder.
What was he supposed to say to his Soulmate that he thought was dead his whole life?
The thought of how touch-starved his husband was always brought forth a fierce protectiveness that would have scared Steve if he hadn’t known it was inevitable with falling for the soft genius, and a wish Howard was still around to give him a
“Mean what?”
He glanced down at his Tsum, who was desperately cuddling against his side and refused to budge even when Tony prodded zir. Being as large as a medium sized dog now, the details on zir Captain America impression were uncanny.
- honestly made him reconsider, and sometimes when he was tired after a work binge, at his most vulnerable, he would trace the perfectly designed shield on his Tsum’s back, wishing it was Rhodey’s MIT sweatshirt or airforce uniform instead; wishing the colorful Tsum Rhodey had, gold dividing matte red and blue, was instead his stained white tee and jeans.
At least, it looked kind of like a robot; it was takin’ it’s time growing and changing colors, but it was pink-ish and had weird armor-like parts to it with what looked like a mask...
The workshop was locked down much more often now, with Tony holed up as he worked on important SI or SHIELD business. (Wasn’t a lie, but…)
Simultaneously, a tiny Tsum - no bigger than his thumb, he would guess, ran right over to Tony, letting out a series of excited chirps as ze hopped around his shoes.
But honestly? He was scared.
Turning back around, the small Iron Man Tsum - because he would recognize his armor anywhere, even on a Tsum - still cradled against his chest.
, Legalos,
Everyone had a Soulmate; the other half of their Soul, the energy of it imprinted by their matching Tsums so they took on their appearance as they grew.
Just as he was about to retort something snarky, or tell Hank to come over and break the door down, a rumbling in the ground caused him to turn. The door slowly slid open, revealing… a hole. Straight into the ground.
Tony continued to pace, as he had been for a good - he glanced at his grandfather clock - half an hour or so. (Distantly he wondered at how he hasn’t worn down the polish of the floor yet.) He chewed his lip, continuously glancing between the clock and the pink pokeball in his hand.
“How am I overthinking this? There’s no way Steve’s going to accept!” Tony all but cried out, his poor fraying nerves pushed to the limit. In his panic, he let go of the phone, letting Jarvis hover on his own.
After all, his Tsum had some strange but cool clothing, like a soldier, which was pretty awesome, and was almost completely developed by now! Which was cool, and… normal. Unlike Steve's.
He would remember watching the Hulk stop one of the monster whale creatures in its tracks.
Thankfully it was a short flight to the bar, Tony easily maneuvering them through the largest hole in the roof to the room below. The reason the team had chosen it as their base, after all, was that it was both one of the more intact buildings left with four walls, making it also one of the most defensible.
“We’re in the kitchen.” She informed Tony of an important fact for looking for medicine.
They walked a few steps when Steve felt a hand on his arm. He stopped and turned, ignoring Coulson’s stressed sigh. It was the eldest son, Sam, was it? “Thanks, for the help.” He smiled, there was a tad confusion written on his face, which Steve couldn’t quite place.
"Tony, what are you doing here? I didn't know you'll show up." Howard waltzed to the mini bar, choosing a bottle of whiskey and pouring a glass after inspecting the label.
“Nice to meet you and please call me Steve.” He forced a small smile.
Nick walked to his chair and sat down, leaning forward on his desk like he was telling them a secret, but he spoke like that no matter what, so that was nothing new for Natasha. He looked the agents up and down, calculating. He decided to lean back in his chair, relaxing. “Years ago,“ he started with his voice raised. “I met a girl just about your age, believe it or not she came from another planet.” He continued the story, while watching the reaction of his audience.
